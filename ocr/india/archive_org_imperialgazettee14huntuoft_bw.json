A new Province, larger than France, has been added to the Indian Empire; the long contemplated railway which will traverse inner India direct from Calcutta to Bombay, has been commenced; the Lusitanian schism, which during two centuries rent the Roman Catholic Church in India, has been closed. Less conspicuous local changes\u2014administrative, legislative, educational, and economic\u2014have occurred in every Province. Their bare enumeration would involve a supplement quite beyond the scope of this work. In the Preface to the present edition I put forward the view that, 'so far from representing the \"stationary stage\" of civilisation, according to a former school of English economists, India is now one of the most rapidly progressive countries of the earth.' The onward movements in India,\nduring the brief period which has since elapsed, justify these words.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn order, however, to prevent misconceptions, it is expedient to narrate very briefly the events which render the lengthy articles on British and Independent Burma in volume iii., and various lesser notices throughout the other twelve volumes dealing with the same territories, no longer a correct representation of the actual state of things. The aggressive attitude of the King of Upper Burma, and his obstinate refusal to redress the wrongs done by his servants to British subjects, compelled Lord Dufferin at the close of 1885 to send an expeditionary force to Mandalay. The King was dethroned, and deported for safe custody to British India. After an attempt to administer the country through the Central Council of Burmese Ministers, an attempt frustrated by the old corrupt officials in the Districts, and by the dynastic discords of the pretenders to the throne, Upper Burma was annexed to British India by proclamation on the 1st January 1886. In February 1886, Lord Dufferin proceeded to Burma to organise the administration of the new Province. The disorders incident to the dis-\n\n\\(^1\\) The considerations which would have pointed to the expediency of amplifying this Postscript have been anticipated by a recent remarkable essay on India by Sir Henry Sumner Maine. 'From 1858 to 1887,' he says, 'India has been governed by the Crown under the control of Parliament, and the facts and figures which I have given seem to me to show that, taking the standards of advance which are employed to test the progress of Western countries, there is no country in Europe which, according to these criteria, and regard being had to the point of departure, has advanced during the same period more rapidly and farther than British India.'\u2014*The Reign of Queen Victoria*, vol. i. p. 518. (Smith, Elder, & Co., 1887.)\nbanding of the royal troops, and the struggles of various party leaders and pretenders to the sovereignty, gave rise to numerous marauding bands known as dacoits. These plunderers were active throughout the hot months and the malarious rainy season of 1886; sometimes as petty gang-robbers, sometimes as bodies of well-armed banditti, and in certain localities as an organised array, operating on a scale which might almost be dignified with the name of guerilla war.\n\nThe close of the unhealthy season, and the approach of the cold weather of 1886-87, enabled the British authorities to deal with these depredators. In November 1886 a force of troops and armed police was gradually spread over Upper Burma in such numbers as to render plunder a very perilous livelihood. The peasantry began to array themselves more actively on the side of order; in many cases taking their protection into their own hands, and slaughtering or capturing the dacoits. The Buddhist clergy were almost from the first on our side, and they made their influence decisively felt as the country settled down. Meanwhile, the annexed territories had been divided into British Districts of more convenient size, and placed under a carefully selected staff of civil administrators. By the end of the cold weather of 1886-87 order was fairly established; and during the ensuing hot weather (1887) the work of pacification went forward. Satisfactory relations were also established with the adjoining States and hill tribes to the North and East. The new Districts are now firmly united with Lower Burma into\na single British Province under a Chief Commissioner. So far as can be foreseen at present (August 1887), the period of conquest in Upper Burma is over, and the task of consolidation is being accomplished by rapid strides.\\(^1\\)\n\nWhile dealing with recent changes in Upper Burma, I take the opportunity of correcting an oversight in regard to the educational system in Lower Burma. Sixteen years ago, when I was collecting materials for the first edition of this work, it seemed to me a subject of regret that the British authorities had not availed themselves more heartily of the system of indigenous instruction given in the monasteries and religious houses by the Buddhist clergy. During the interval which has since elapsed, the system of public instruction in British Burma may almost be said to have been reconstituted on the basis of indigenous monastic teaching. I have mentioned the function assigned to such native agency at page 207 of volume iii. and in other places. But there are also passages in which I\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In the Preface to this edition I regretted that the necessity of printing in England, while the author was in India, unavoidably led to errors in the press. An unfortunate example of this class occurs in my account of recent transactions in Burma at page 430 of volume vi. I had kept back the sheet in order to incorporate the facts of the Proclamation of Annexation and of Lord Dufferin's visit to Burma. But the new sentences, when forwarded to England, got transposed; and the events of January and February 1886 are made to precede the expeditionary force and occupation of Mandalay in November 1885. A clerical error, also due to the insertion of a new sentence in the proof, and more likely to lead to confusion, had escaped me in the same volume. In line 5 of footnote 2, page 230 of volume vi., for 'The latter' please read, 'The former.' Again, in lines 22 and 24 of p. 471 of volume v., the words 'right' and 'left' have been inadvertently transposed.\nomit to notice or to sufficiently emphasize the change. I gladly therefore take this occasion to again acknowledge the educational work done by the monastic institutions and the Buddhist clergy in Burma, and also the wise use which the English authorities in the Province have, for years past, made of this indigenous basis of public instruction.\n\nThe ancient schism between the Catholic Priests and Bishops appointed under the jurisdiction of the King of Portugal or his representative, the Archbishop of Goa, and the Vicars-Apostolic sent to India under the direct authority of the Pope, has been narrated in volume vi.\\(^1\\) Since that volume was written, the provisional arrangement therein mentioned has been matured into a permanent settlement of the long-conflicting claims. The local jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Goa, as representing the King of Portugal, has been respected. But, generally speaking, the Roman Catholic Church in India has now been brought under the authority of the Pope. His Holiness has issued an instrument setting forth the new settlement of the Indian Catholic Church; and a hierarchy of Archbishops and Bishops, under the direct regulation of Rome, has taken the place of the Vicars and Prefects Apostolic in partibus infidelium.\n\nDuring the printing of the fourteen volumes, much new information has come into my possession, some-\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Vol. vi. pp. 255, 256.\ntimes too late to be used. Thus, while I correctly state\\(^1\\) that the style of 'the Governor-General-in-Council' was first authorized by the statute of 33 Geo. III., I elsewhere mention, on the authority of an official Report on the Old Records of the India Office, that the title of Governor-General had occurred incidentally a century before.\\(^2\\) A personal examination of the original manuscripts has since convinced me that this is erroneous; and that the official reporter probably misread the title of 'Captain-General' for 'Governor-General.' I am indebted to Colonel Yule, C.B., for materials, also derived from the India Office MSS., which throw grave doubts on the popular derivation of Chanak (or Achanak), the native name for Barrackpur, from its supposed founder, Job Charnock. The name seems to have existed before that worthy could have given it his patronymic.\n\nFor these and other deficiencies I respectfully plead the necessity imposed upon me to finish the undertaking within stringent limits as to time. The present fourteen volumes endeavour to truthfully condense the data which I have been able, during sixteen years, to collect concerning an Empire nearly equal in size to all Europe, less Russia. They were intended to subserve the purposes of administration, and the Government wisely declined to permit of leisure for literary completeness, at the cost of delays which would have impaired the practical utility of the work. Every year adds new\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. vi. p. 431.\n\n\\(^2\\) Vol. vi. p. 370 (footnote).\nstores to our information regarding India; and each decennial Census enables the economist and the administrator to handle Indian problems with a surer grasp. It may perhaps be my privilege, at some future time, to bring out a further edition of these volumes, with ampler knowledge and clearer lights. If this be not granted, I leave with confidence to the servants of the Crown in India who come after me, the task of perfecting the work which I have begun.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to express my obligations to Mr. J. S. Cotton, late Fellow of Queen's College, Oxford, and Mr. H. Morse Stephens, B.A. of Balliol College, for the Index which forms this volume. That Index is a careful expansion of the one to the first edition. It brings to a point, and renders available at a glance, the masses of local information collected throughout the 250 Districts of India during the past sixteen years. Its plan, general outline, and major headings, are necessarily my own: but to Mr. Cotton and Mr. Stephens belongs the merit of its execution.\n\nW. W.

This is nothing less than a complete Statistical Survey of the entire British Empire in Hindustan, which Dr. Hunter has condensed into the practical form of an Imperial* Gazetteer of India. . . . The article INDIA, in Volume IV., is the touchstone of the work, and proves clearly enough the sterling metal of which it is wrought. It represents the essence of the 100 volumes which contain the results of the Statistical Survey conducted by Dr. Hunter throughout each of the 240 Districts of India. It is, moreover, the only attempt that has ever been made to show how the Indian people have been built up, and the evidence from the original materials has been for the first time sifted and examined by the light\nof the local researches in which the author was for so long engaged. . . . In treating of ancient India, the author has made no use of Mill's work, but has written the history afresh from original translations of the Sanskrit literature of the period. The story of medieval India could scarcely be told without the aid of Elphinstone's well-known work, but Dr. Hunter has gone back in every case to the original sources, from Elphinstone to Ferishta, and from him to the Arab geographers and Persian historians contained in Sir Henry Elliot's nine volumes on the same subject. In the accounts both of ancient and medieval India, use has been made of the latest discoveries of the Archaeological Survey, which is still being carried on. The great feature of this remarkable article, and that in which its chief usefulness consists, is, perhaps, the constructive account of the Indian people, and the synthesis of Hinduism from the actually existing facts, as revealed by Dr. Hunter's survey and by the first Indian census.'\n\n\u2014The Times (first notice, May 26, 1881).\n\n'The publication of the Imperial Gazetteer of India marks the completion of the largest national enterprise in statistics which has ever been undertaken. This gigantic work has been carried out under the uninterrupted direction of Dr. Hunter, its original designer, from the initial stage of local inquiry in each of the 240 Districts of India to the final arrangement of the results in an alphabetical form. . . . The great value of this work is not only that it gives for the first time a complete account of India, and places in a clear light before our eyes the political, social, and physical condition of millions of our fellow-subjects, of whom before we had no accurate conception; but that it also breaks the long spell of disappointment and failure, which has hitherto hung over the efforts of the Indian Government towards an elucidation of the country it governs. Hitherto no one has believed in Indian statistics. Every official statement made on any Indian subject has been contradicted point-blank. . . . The volumes supply, for the first time, materials by means of which British statesmen at home, and the British public at large, can criticise the actions of our Proconsuls in the East. Both Englishmen and native Indians will be thankful for a work, the accuracy, fulness of detail, completeness of information, and masterly arrangement of which constitute it a real and invaluable help to all who do honest work in India, and to all who honestly judge of Indian work at home. . . . It is one of the grandest works of administrative statistics which have ever been issued by any nation, and should earn for its author and designer the gratitude of every one who has the welfare and good government of our Indian Empire at heart.'\n\n\u2014The Times (second notice).\n\n'The Statistical Survey of India marks an epoch in the approximation of Indian rule to our English ideas of good government, and forms the necessary complement to the transfer of India from a Commercial Company to the direct administration of the Crown. That transfer placed the authority over the Indian Government in the hands of the Imperial Parliament, but it supplied no data by which the people of England, through their constitutional representatives, could safely wield their newly acquired authority. . . . Of the obstructions and difficulties which such a work was sure to encounter, Dr. Hunter says not a word. . . . This masterful silence as to difficulties thrust on one side, obstacles beaten down, unjust jealousies and just susceptibilities conciliated, and individual wills controlled, is the finest characteristic of the body of Englishmen who administer India; and is a distinctive trait of our countrymen, wherever they are called upon to rule in the colonies and outlying dependencies which form the mighty aggregate of the wide-scattered British Empire. . . . No nation has ever attempted so comprehensive, so detailed, and so stupendous a statistical enterprise, and the whole has been planned and executed with a smoothness and a certainty which are truly marvellous.'\u2014The Athen\u00e6um.\n\n'England has brought India for the first time under one empire; and Mr. Hunter, also for the first time, has exhibited before us on a panoramic scale the vastness of our responsibility, and has afforded us the means of performing our trust under the guidance of full knowledge.'\u2014The Pall Mall Gazette.\n\n'The Imperial Gazetteer is the crowning work which brings the results of the great Statistical Survey within reach of the general public. It represents twelve years of incessant labour, demanding many high qualities for its efficient execution, and natural gifts such as are rarely combined in one man. Learning, experience, and scholarly research were no less essential than habits of accurate\nthought, administrative talent, and orderly, methodical arrangement. Above all, imagination was needed\u2014that quality without which work cannot be endowed with life and movement, but remains dead, a mere receptacle of lifeless facts. It is to the rare combination of literary skill and the imaginative faculty, with the qualifications of an able and energetic administrator, that we owe the completion of this great and difficult task. It is no ordinary service that Dr. Hunter has done to India and to England; and, for his hard and admirably performed achievement, he has earned the gratitude of his countrymen.'\u2014Clements R. Markham in the 'Academy.'\n\n'A model of combined lucidity, conciseness, and comprehensiveness. . . . Emphatically a great work\u2014great in its magnitude, and still greater in the beneficial results it is calculated to produce.'\u2014The Economist.\n\n'The Imperial Gazetteer of India, which, without exaggeration, may be called a magnificent work, alike in its conception and execution, will go far to supply the present and future guardians of our great dependency with the accurate and systematized knowledge of the countries and peoples under their rule, without which the highest political ability and the very best intentions are condemned to work in the dark. If Dr. Hunter had no other claim\u2014and he has many\u2014to the gratitude of all interested in the welfare of the inhabitants of India, and the efficiency of the machine of government on which much of their happiness and prosperity depends, this splendid memorial of his ability, industry, and perseverance would have been sufficient to give him a place among those who have worthily performed great and useful tasks.'\u2014The Statist.\n\n'Hitherto the cardinal defect in our administration of India, keenly felt and bitterly deplored by all earnest men in the country, has been lack of adequate continuous trustworthy information. It is clearly not too much to say of Dr. Hunter's magnum opus, that it has changed all that; the system and method of Indian administration take a new departure from the date of its publication. . . . No one undertaking that we have yet accomplished in India, or for India, has promised such far-reaching benefits. Dr. Hunter, handing over to a successor the easy task of keeping his work serviceable and in good repair, will doubtless receive, from the Government which he has served so well, promotion commensurate with the importance of his labours; but he will have the far higher satisfaction of feeling that in the Imperial Gazetteer he has left a monument of his ability and industry more lasting than brass.'\u2014Allen's Indian Mail.\n\n'Between 1769 and 1855, the East India Company set on foot many attempts towards the production of a comprehensive description of its possessions. The only result was a storehouse of important materials in a fragmentary state. With the transference of the government to the Crown in 1858, the need of information became more and more urgently felt. The half-personal, half-traditional knowledge possessed by the Company's officers disclosed many deficiencies from its isolated character; while they also held far too lightly the English responsibility of governing in a constitutional manner the subjugated States. Lord Mayo, as Viceroy, appointed Dr. Hunter to the head of the Indian Statistical Department, and entrusted to him the descriptive survey of this great country inhabited by 240 millions of men. . . . In nine volumes he presents an exposition of the Indian Empire. The Imperial Gazetteer of India is an example of clearness and comprehensiveness with the concise treatment of all the essential features of a country. Although alphabetically arranged, the Gazetteer is no bare survey of the matters dealt with. It sets forth the fruits of the author's personal and long-protracted researches, and forms a monument of Dr. Hunter's knowledge of the topography, agriculture, administration, and health-aspects of the whole Empire of India.'\u2014K\u00f6lnische Zeitung.\n\nPRICE ONE SHILLING.\n\nENGLAND'S WORK IN INDIA.\n\n'The fruit and condensation of Mr. Hunter's labours.'\nPRICE THREE AND SIXPENCE.\n\nA BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INDIAN PEOPLE.\n\nSEVENTH EDITION.

What we require is a book which shall be accurate as to facts, but not overloaded with them; written in a style which shall interest, attract, and guide uncultivated readers; and short, because it must be sold at a reasonable price. These conditions have never, in my opinion, been realized previous to the introduction of this book.'\n\n'The publication of the Hon. W. W. Hunter's School History of India is an event in literary history.' \u2014Reis & Raynet (Calcutta).\n\n'We have not come across a single work on Indian History which we have read with greater pleasure and greater pride. As a historian, Dr. Hunter has done full justice to the people of India. He has succeeded in writing a history of India, not only in such a way that it will be read, but also in a way which we hope will lead young Englishmen and young natives of India to think more kindly of each other. The Calcutta University has done wisely in prescribing this brief history as a text-book for the Entrance Examination.' \u2014The Hindoo Patriot (Calcutta).\n\nLONDON: TR\u00dcBNER & CO., LUDGATE
