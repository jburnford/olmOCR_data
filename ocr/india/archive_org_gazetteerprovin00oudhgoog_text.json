Haidarabad is a part of the old pargana Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, belonging to the Ahbans and P\u00e1s\u00eds; it was afterwards seized by the Sayyads, and then probably occupied by the Gaurs. A zamindari settlement was made with them at the expulsion of the Sayyads about 1,200 Fasli. Various branches of the old Ahban family have recovered possession since 1,200 Fasli; the rest of the zamindars are retainers or followers of the Sayyads and the chakladars, and none boast more than four generations of proprietary possession except the q\u00e1n\u00fangos. It may be mentioned that the pargana owes its prosperity to Mansa R\u00e1m, chakladar, who settled Kurmis all over the pargana, bestowing on them a proprietary right which many of them have preserved, and their struggles with the restored Ahbans form the prominent feature of the settlement.\n\nThe surface along the Kathna lies very low, and is covered at a little distance from the river with mixed jungle containing a good proportion of s\u00e1l. It slowly rises, and the border of cultivation commences at about two miles from the bank on the average. This jungle has not been broken up, partly because the grantees expect more profit from growing s\u00e1l timber, partly because the zamindars defer making any increase to their cultivated area till assessment shall be over; where they were more eager for immediate profit, as in Paraili, the land has turned out most productive. Where cultivation commences the soil is a rather light dum\u00e1t, becoming at the south-west corner even bh\u00far; it rapidly improves, and about half a mile from the edge of the cultivation is of the very highest quality, yielding every crop and very high rents. \"It is nearly level.\" Where there is a slight depression the mat\u00ed\u00e1r yields fine crops of r\u00edc\u00e9, and the dum\u00e1t magnificent sugarcane, but the centre is swampy in places.\n\nFrom some unexplained reason, the belt of villages which lies along the centre of the pargana\u2014Bilwa, Chitsunia, Dh\u00e1riw\u00e1n, Garthenia\u2014most of which are the property of Government, yield a sugar of so great purity that it requires hardly any refining to make the clearest candy, and it bears a considerably higher price than any other in the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur market. As a result of this the rent of sugarcane land in these villages was formerly Rs. 2-8-0 per local bigha, or Rs. 15 per acre.\n\nBeyond these villages the level rises, the soil becomes lighter as the eastern boundary is approached, and along the old course of the now van-\nished river Ganga sandy hillocks are found. On the very highest of these mud wells are made freely, but only used with earthen pots.\n\nThe pargana is covered with singularly fine groves; towards the east the great sal forest of the tarai crowns the high bluff which borders the ancient river's channel, in which a succession of small lakes appear, where the current has worn the deepest. This river is considered sacred; its old banks therefore are crowned with the fanes and shrines of many sects, some lately erected, many in all stages of decay. At the great fair of Gola Gokaranath some 200,000 people assemble in April each year to bathe in the sacred tank of Mahadeo. The stranger ascending one of the hills behind the town will see to the north, as far as the eye can reach, nothing but a sea of tree-tops waving densely as the corn in the harvest field; this is the vanguard of the great forest of the Himalayan Tarai. To the south he will see a high plateau stretching far away to the horizon, following the course of the river, generally covered with sal forest, but here and there rising into bare mounds of dun sand crowned with hoary ruins. To the east and west he will see a champaign country, sparkling with lakes embosomed in many groves, and during the continuance of the fair the prospect is made up mainly by vast numbers of pilgrims, their tents, shops, horses, and elephants all glistening with bright colours, the crowd gathering thicker and thicker round the sacred tank. This last is lined with masonry, and is surrounded with temples, and the yet more numerous tombs of the Gosha\u00e9ins, high priests, each of whom is honoured with a separate mausoleum. The object of worship is a large stone which bears the mark of a heavy blow with an iron mace. Tradition reports that the Emperor Aurangzeb ordered the stone to be pulled up, but that the effort of many elephants was of no avail, and when the emperor approached the spot to discover the obstacle, flames burst forth from the ground, and the dismayed monarch retreating, made a grant to the shrine of the offended deity.\n\nThe present pargana of Haidarabad covers an area of 98 square miles, of which 41 are cultivated; it has a population of 35,703, at the rate of 317 to the square mile, but a portion of the area is reserved forest.; of them 4,711 are Musalmans. The above area includes the little pargana of Sikandrabad at the south-east corner. The population consists largely of Kurmis. The landlords are nearly all resident; the estates compact and manageable: the principal are Kotwara, Gola, Sikandrabad, all owned by connected sheikhs (see Kheri article).\n\nTo the south near the Rapti, are the ruins of the jungle fort of Muhammadabad; another is found at Ahmadnagar. Both attest the former greatness of the Sayyids of Pithani by whom they were erected. Their time-worn walls are now overgrown with dense jungle. Everywhere throughout the pargana are found the curious fluted cupolas which mark the burial places of the Gosha\u00e9ins. There are all the elements of prosperity in Haidarabad if the usurers do not acquire the mastery.\n\nHAIDARABAD Town\u2014Pargana ASHWAN\u2014Tahsil MOHAN\u2014District UNAO\u2014This town lies 12 miles west of the tahsil station Mohan, and 19 miles north of the sadr station Unao. Two miles west of Ashwan there is an unmetalled road to Unao. This town was founded by one Haidar\nKhan, by order of the king of Delhi about 180 years ago, and called Haidarabad after his name. It was formerly called Gandhw\u00e1ra Haidarabad, but now the two places have been separately demarcated. There are two markets weekly, and one fair in the month of May, at which about 1,000 people assemble. The average sales amount to about Rs. 24,000 a year. There are 788 mud-built houses, and one temple dedicated to Debi.\n\nThe population is as follows:\n\n| Brahmins | Hindus | Musalmans | Total |\n|----------|--------|-----------|-------|\n| Chattris | 397    | 766       | 3,809 |\n| Kayaths  |        |           |       |\n| P\u00e1ris    |        |           |       |\n| Ahirs    |        |           |       |\n| Bani\u00e1ns  |        |           |       |\n| Other tribes | 1,951 |           |       |\n\n3,043\n\nLatitude ... ... ... ... 28\u00b0 55' north.\nLongitude ... ... ... ... 80\u00b0 17' east.\n\nHAIDARGARH Pargana\u2014Tahsil HAIDARGARH\u2014District BARA BANKI.\n\nThis pargana derives its name from the principal town which was founded in 1194 Fasli by Haidar Beg Khan, n\u00e1zim, afterwards prime minister of \u00c1sif-ud-daula. Like other neighbouring parganas, it was in the possession of the Bhars, but they were deprived of it by Sayyad M\u00edr\u00e1n, and afterwards entirely extirpated by Sultan Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur. This pargana formerly belonged to the il\u00e1qa of Nagr\u00e1m (a town founded by a Bhar named Nal) in the district of Lucknow, and was once under the rule of the Amethia r\u00e1jas. The origin of the term Amethia is thus narrated: About five hundred and fifty years ago one R\u00e9e B\u00e1\u00ed Singh, the son of R\u00e1ja Pirthi Chand, by order of the reigning emperor, conquered the insurgent taluqdar of Amethi, who had neglected or refused to pay his revenue. In reward for this the emperor conferred upon him the title of \"Amethia R\u00e1ja.\"\n\nDuring the reign of Akbar it was called Nagr\u00e1m, as belonging to that estate. H\u00e1ider Beg Khan, the n\u00e1zim of the place, transferred the headquarters of the pargana to Fatehgarh, and founded a katra or mart close to Fatehgarh, which latter place so flourished that thenceforward the name of Haidargarh pargana became common to both and in official use.\n\nThis pargana comprises 118 villages, its area is 103 square miles, the breadth from north to south is 10 miles, and length from east to west 13 miles. It is bounded on the north by pargana Siddhaur, on the south by pargana Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n of the Rae Bareli district, on the west by the Lucknow district, and on the east by pargana Subeha. The proprietary body of this pargana chiefly belongs to the Amethia clan of Rajputs. The proprietary system is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdar | Zamindari | Pattidari | Bhayyach\u00e1ra |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n\nVillages.\n\n| Taluqdar | Zamindari | Pattidari | Bhayyach\u00e1ra |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n|          |           |           |             |\n\n118\nThe area is 66,017 acres, and the Government revenue is Rs. 1,500,000, the rate per acre being Rs. 2-13-6. The population consists of almost all classes of Hindus and Muhammadans; the former belong for the most part to the Shaivi, and the latter to the Sunni sects. Amethia Chhattris are the principal high caste Hindus in the pargana. The law of primogeniture prevails with them. The population amounts to 65,765,* of which there are 61,573 Hindus and 4,192 Muhammadans.\n\nThe river Gumti waters the western part of this pargana and flows eastward into the Sultanpur district. The villages through which this river passes are Jaur\u00e1s, Bhilwal, Dhaurahra, Bhaseri, Jask\u00e1pur, and Robi. This river is of no service to the pargana, but on the contrary does much damage to the crops when it overflows its banks during the rainy season. There are four rivulets, viz., Loni, Siunam, Kori, and Kalenda Pachhimpur. The last three join the first, and fall into the Gumti at a spot near village Akhi\u00e1pur.\n\nThe climate is tolerably healthy. The soil is generally of two kinds, loam and clay; sandy soil is found in a smaller proportion in the villages of this pargana than in those adjoining the banks of the river Gumti. The irrigation is mostly carried on from tanks, and the principal products are:\n\nKhar\u00edf (autumn)\u2014rice, cotton, hemp, millet, vetch, moth, makra, and m\u00e1sh; maize, b\u00e1jra, and k\u00e1kun are not much seen, excepting in villages which lie immediately near the river. The rabi (spring) crops are, wheat, barley, gram, linseed, peas, sugar, tobacco, and poppy. The pargana produces the best kind of paddy. Grain grown in this pargana is exported to Lucknow, Sultanpur, Daryabad, and Cawnpore; it amounts in all to about 27,550 maunds annually. The principal articles imported into this pargana from the Cawnpore district are cotton and salt.\n\nThere are seven markets, viz., Haidargarh, N\u00e1ra, Tirbed\u00edganj, Mahona, Bhilwal, Kara Asw\u00e1npur, and L\u00e1hi. Of these the market of Haidargarh is the principal one, in which the largest sales are effected; corn, cloth, and salt are the chief articles of sale. In the market of L\u00e1hi cattle are also sold.\n\nBut one fair is held; in the village of Robi, on the bank of the Gumti, in honour of Aus\u00e1neswar Mah\u00e1deo; it takes place every Monday, but the most noted occasion is on the day of Shiur\u00e1tri, in the month of Ph\u00e1gun (February-March), when the gathering of people amounts to 10,000. It lasts only for one day.\n\nIn eight villages of this pargana on the border of the river Gumti are quarries of kankar, which is used in constructing and repairing the imperial roads. In the time of the kings salt was manufactured in eleven villages to the value of Rs. 600, but since annexation this has been prohibited. Saltpetre is manufactured in four villages to the amount of\n\n* 71,558 according to census of 1869.\nabout 35,000 maunds; it is purchased on the spot by dealers at the rate of from Rs. 3-8-0 to Rs. 4-8-0 per maund.\n\nThere are two Hindu temples in honour of Shiva, and one Muhammadan tomb, that of Shah H\u00e1mid Abd\u00e1l. There are two sar\u00e1es, one in Haidargarh Kh\u00e1s, and the other on the road leading to Kithu and Sultanpur, in the village Allahd\u00e1dpur. In this village is also a bridge over the Loni, constructed in the time of Amjad Ali Shah, at a cost of Rs. 15,000, by R\u00e1ja Jw\u00e1la Parsh\u00e1d, a K\u00e1yath noble of Lucknow, and a member of the king's council.\n\nHAIDARGARH Town\u2014Pargana HAIDARGARH\u2014Tahsil HAIDARGARH\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This town lies 25 miles east of Nawabganj, Bara Banki. It was founded in 1194 Fasli by Amr-ud-daula Haidar Beg Khan, the then chakladar, afterwards prime minister of Nawab Asif-ud-daula, who made it the headquarters of the pargana. It is now the seat of the tahsil, but is a place of no great importance. A bazar is held for supply of necessary articles. The pargana has been long known as a seat of the Amethia Rajputs, and particularly in connexion with Sahajr\u00e1m Bakhsh of Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri, who used to resist the chakladars of the nawabi, and was a terror to the country round.\n\nHAJIPUR Town\u2014Pargana MANGALSI\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014The foundation of this town is lost in obscurity; it is situated on the metalled road from Fyzabad to Lucknow, 18 miles from the former station. The population consists of 3,083 Hindus and 89 Musalmans. A fight occurred here between the Chauh\u00e1n zamindars, in which some lives were lost. The river Gogra runs two miles to the north.\nHAR:\n\nHARDOI DISTRICT ARTICLE.\n\nABSTRACT OF CHAPTERS.\n\nI.\u2014Natural Features. II.\u2014Agriculture, Commerce. III.\u2014The People.

At the extreme north-west the little river Sendha separates it from the district of Shahjahanpur down to its junction with the Ramganga. The boundary then crosses the latter river and proceeds direct south, till at the ferry of Sangrampur it strikes the Ganges, which forms the rest of its western limit. Artificial lines of demarcation separate it on the north from Kheri, on the south from the Lucknow and Unao districts. The district forms an irregular parallelogram running between the Gumti and the Ganges. Its greatest length from north-west to south-east is 78 miles, its average breadth is 46. It lies between 26\u00b0 54' and 27\u00b0 47' north latitude, and between 79\u00b0 42' and 80\u00b0 53' east longitude; its population is 931,517, being at the rate of 406 to the square mile. The entire area of the district is 2,292 square miles, somewhat less than Perthshire; the area in acres is 1,457,114, of which 844,560 are cultivated. Exclusive of grants\u2014\n\n| Percentage | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| 59         | is under crop |\n| 2          | in groves |\n| 5\u00bd         | is barren |\n| 5\u00bd         | is covered with water in the shape of rivers, lakes, and ponds |\n| 25         | is arable waste |\n| 3          | consists of roads or sites of villages |\n\nThe above have been altered from the official figures by a distribution among all the headings of the 2-9 percentage of rent-free lands. It is to be feared, however, that the barren lands are considerably more extensive than is here set forth. One feature of Hardoi is the series of great tusar or saline plains which run through the middle of the district on each side of the railway from Sandila to Shahabad: they are almost wholly unculturable. Hardoi is a level district; there are no mountains; the highest point is north of Pihani, near the Gumti, and is 490 feet above the level of the sea. The country continues high along the Gumti, with a breadth of from 3 to 8 miles, the soil sandy, water at a distance of from 25 to 40 feet; this elevated belt then sinks eastward into the central plain, which is from 10 to 20 miles broad. Down its centre runs the river Sai, which rises in Pihani, the elevation of which stream\nvaries from 437 feet at Hardoi to 420 feet when it crosses the railway between Sandila and Hardoi. Beyond this plain the country again rises, forming the watershed between the Sai and Garra with other tributaries of the Ganges; proceeding west the elevation reaches 480 feet between Hardoi and S\u00e1ndi, and sinks to about 470 between M\u00e1dhoganj and Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n. The main portion of the district is then the valley of the Sai river: a valley, however, whose slopes are almost imperceptible in places. For instance, Hardoi the headquarters, two miles from the Sai, is only two feet above it. Beyond the river Garra the valley of the Ganges is met; the elevation is low, the Ganges itself being only 396 feet above the sea opposite S\u00e1ndi. The drainage follows the levels above indicated. The rivers Garra and R\u00e1mganga were probably much larger formerly than they are now, a portion of the waters of the Ganges having probably in former times passed down their channels. As remarked concerning the Chauka, the general tendency of the Himalayan rivers has been to abandon lateral channels and concentrate their volume in the central and most depressed one. Many think that the main channel of the Ganges was formerly that of the present Garra, but this is, I think, impossible, there having been no recent changes of note in the river-bed.\n\nThe general aspect of the country, except towards the Ganges, is hardly so pleasing as in the rest of Oudh. There are fewer groves, and more hard grey plains. Towards the Ganges, near S\u00e1ndi and Bilgr\u00e1m, the land is more uneven, and often rises into hillocks of sand cultivated at the basis, but the summits of pure white silica rippled all over with every eddy of wind. These elevations are often obscured with whirling drifts of sand-like clouds on the tops, while the atmosphere below is quite clear. Generally these hills are covered with the lofty m\u00fanj grass, whose stalks are twelve feet high, and topped with huge plumes of flossy filaments; in some places this grass forms hedges for the fields in which scanty crops of barley are raised, but on the sand hills above Gopamanu and S\u00e1ndi the arid soil raises nothing else. The gigantic tufts of reed-like grass are a most graceful feature in the landscape; they cover with their swaying plumes the numerous sandy knolls which some great river or lake has left behind, and if any one, mounted on an elephant, surveys the scene from the highest point, it is one of strange and weird beauty as far as the eye can reach. When they are very thick they resist the wind, which only dimples the serried mass; at other places the reeds bend their silky glories to the earth in great swathes, and toss them about in every gust till they present the appearance of waves in a chopping sea. These sand hills and their grassy brakes are the haunt of herds of deer, besides sand grouse and pigeons.\n\nSoil and subterranean formations.\u2014The soil of Hardoi is lighter than that of perhaps any other district, twenty-seven per cent. being sand, fifty-six per cent. loam, and seventeen per cent. clay. So much for the surface soil. As for the subterranean formations, a section* along the railway cutting for sixty-five miles through this district has been obtained in the process of sinking wells. It reveals most interesting facts. Everywhere grey,\n\nFurnished by Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nwhite, or yellow sand wholly unmixed with clay is met with at a depth of from twelve to thirty-five feet. For the first twenty miles from the border of the Lucknow district, proceeding north, the sand is met at an average distance of twenty feet, the extremes being seventeen feet, and for about two miles on each side the river Baita thirty feet. Above the sand is first a stratum of black clay from two to ten feet thick, above that again sandy clay averaging about six feet, and above that the surface soil, a red clay averaging about eight feet thick. Throughout this tract, the wells can generally be dug without masonry linings. From Kachhona to Hardoi, about twenty miles further, forming the basin of the Sai, the sand comes nearer the surface, averaging about fifteen feet beneath the upper soil, which consists of sandy clay with a thin topping of yellow clay, while for about three miles on each side of the Sai the floods have deposited a surface-dressing of pure sand. Throughout this area wells cannot last without a masonry lining, unless they merely collect the surface percolations. Beyond Hardoi the bottom sand sinks somewhat, and when the series of jhils round Pipri, half-way between Hardoi and Shahabad, is reached, the sand gives place to a blue sandy clay; this break was apparently caused by the channel of some ancient river. The sand again approaches the surface for the last six miles before reaching Shahabad. Throughout half of this section these wells should stand without a masonry lining.\n\nLakes.\u2014There are a number of large jhils or lakes in the district; those of Sandi, Rodamau, and several near Kachhona and Bawan are the most remarkable. That of Sandi is three miles long and one to two broad, the land on either side rising high above the water; one or two large groves add their sombre shades to the light tints of the spring crops, and the emerald gloss of the lotus leaves covers large expanses of the lake. In the inner recess of the valley the waters are still and of a deep-blue, but where the surrounding eminences widen out, the wind moves the surface into sheets of grey rippling wavelets, and often in the centre of the lake sudden gusts drive the water before it in green billows and bursts of white foam. None of the other lakes are so large or deep. That at Rodamau is a fine sheet of water, specially interesting because from its waters rise the ruined walls of an old mud fort, the scene of one of the most mournful tragedies of the Indian struggle in 1857, and in a little grove near at hand rest the remains of Brigadier-General Adrian Hope and his brave companions in arms. The jhils are largely used for purposes of irrigation, no less than 126,000 acres being watered from them. Nearly all produce the singh\u00e1ra or waternut in abundance. The Hardoi wild-fowl shootings are famous.\n\nForests.\u2014There are a number of great jungles still in existence. All along the Sai, past Tandiaon and Pih\u00e1ni, dense jungle is still found, coming down from pargana Kasta, through which it joins the woods which skirt the river Kathna, and along its banks blends with the great forest of the tar\u00e1i. Down these promontories of the primeval woods, stretching far into the cultivated lands, came down robber bands, the B\u00e9chhils of Atwa, Piparia, the P\u00e1sis of the Bangar, Mituli, and Ahrori in Gopamau, too.\nKatahria of Palia, the Chamar Gaurs of Sara. By day they marched secretly through the forests, stopping at noon beneath some vast pipal or banian to cook the midday meal and offer an oblation of meal and flowers to their patron goddess Bhaw\u00e1ni, who is partial to these umbrageous shrines. At night they would come forth from the jungle, move swiftly and silently on some village in which dwelt a village banker, a wealthy grain merchant, some Government civil or military officer retired with his savings to his native village; before daylight they would dive back into the forests, leaving mangled and tortured bodies over the holes whence their treasures had been rifled. Even now in the Bangar the P\u00e1s\u00eds pride themselves on taking some evidence of their prowess, a penknife, a handkerchief from the tents of the English officers who visit their jungles for sport, and with whom they are generally on the best of terms.\n\nThere are other forests between Sand\u00edla and M\u00e1dhoganj, between Hardoi and B\u00e1wan; but the main jungle tract is that which extends along both banks of the Sai almost continuously for about fifteen miles from its source, while on either side detached patches of jungle are scattered here and there, gradually getting more and more sparse further east and west from that river. These jungles were formerly inhabited; in one patch of about three thousand acres, granted as a reward for loyalty to Munshi Fazl Ras\u00fal, the owner's ploughs have already revealed fifteen ancient wells in perfect order, covered with a light coating of loam from the decay of fallen leaves during many centuries. There is hardly any sal forest, dh\u00e1k is the most common; and nowhere is the glorious bloom of that tree a more striking feature of the March and April landscape than in Hardoi. Karaunda is common, but the banian tree is more abundant in Hardoi than in any other part of Oudh.\n\nRivers.\u2014The rivers of Hardoi are, commencing from the west, the Ganges, R\u00e1mganga, Garra, Sukheta, Sai, Baita, and Gumti, most of which are noticed separately; their aggregate cold weather discharge is nearly 4,000 feet per second. Few of them are of any use for purposes of irrigation. The Garra is perhaps most largely applied to that object. The Gumti during the winter and summer is here a gentle stream whose dry weather discharge is not more than 300 cubic feet; it has high sandy banks on each side, is easily fordable at all places, and at certain spots is not more than two feet deep. It is nowhere bridged in this district. The Sai, which during the rains has an enormous torrent of water, is here an insignificant river, with a channel hardly sunk below the general surface till it gets beyond the latitude of Hardoi opposite Sand\u00edla. There it has cut a channel some twenty-five feet below the surrounding country; its dry weather discharge is only thirty feet at Partabgarh; it is a mere rivulet in Hardoi. The Ganges, the R\u00e1mganga, and the Garra are navigable by boats of 500 maunds; the banks of all are sandy, the bottoms never rocky, though ridges of kankar occur. The fords are mentioned in the accompanying table.\n### Register of deaths for Hardoi district for the year 1870.\n\n| No. of group | Christians | Muhammadans | Hindus | Other classes |\n|--------------|------------|-------------|--------|--------------|\n|              | Cholera    | Small pox   | Fever | Bowel complaints | Wounds | Accident | All other causes | Total deaths |\n| 1            | 1,309      | 9,110       | 2,131 | 33           | 534    | 9,939    | 480     | 31         | 399     | 1,135   | 12,651 |\n\nTotal ... 1 1,309 9,110 2,131 33 534 9,939 480 31 399 1,135 12,651\n\n### Register of deaths for Hardoi district for the year 1871.\n\n| Class | Cause of Death |\n|-------|----------------|\n|       | Cholera | Small-pox | Fevers | Bowel complaints | Injuries | Snake-bite killed by wild beasts | All other causes | Total deaths in group |\n|       | Suicide | Wounds | Accident | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female | Total |\n| 1871 | 1,418   | 15,440 | 15       | 18   | 569   | 489   | 6,890 | 4,939 | 196   | 183   | 83    | 37    | 29    | 67    | 90    | 33    | 47    | 181   | 151   | 7,929 | 6,937 | 15,868 |\nCHAPTER II.\n\nAGRICULTURE, COMMERCE.\n\nCrops\u2014Agricultural statistics\u2014Prices\u2014Droughts\u2014Hailstorms\u2014Food of the people\u2014Fish\u2014Manufacture\u2014Trade\u2014Commerce\u2014Railway traffic\u2014Fairs\u2014Roads and communications\u2014Weights and measures\u2014Interest.\n\nIn all points connected with the condition of the people, the size of farms, the houses, clothing, agricultural implements, wages of labourers, of coolies, of artizans, crops, times of sowing and reaping, rent, &c., the Lucknow and Kheri district accounts may be consulted.\n\nThe official returns of crop areas are apparently incorrect; they are as follows in the revenue report for 1872:\n\n| Staple          | Acreage |\n|-----------------|---------|\n| Wheat           | 314,182 |\n| Rice            | 74,680  |\n| Other edible grains | 858,650 |\n| Oilseeds        | 17,560  |\n| Sugar           | 23,306  |\n| Cotton          | 18,040  |\n| Opium           | 522     |\n| Indigo          | 1,432   |\n| Fibres          | 6,430   |\n| Tobacco         | 15,260  |\n| Vegetables      | 24,762  |\n\n1,329,764\n\nThe total area under crop in the year of survey was 844,560 acres, nor is it likely that much land has been brought under the plough in recent years. If so, even allowing for dufasli crops, the area in the above table must be exaggerated. Further, the table exhibits Hardoi as the greatest wheat-producing district in Oudh, although, according to the soil returns already quoted, it has a very large proportion of sandy soil which is unfitted for growing wheat. Hardoi produces very little rice, and that only of the common kinds, transplantation is not applied, and fine rice lands are often allowed to lie fallow. This is probably owing to the exceptional dryness of the district. In Bilgr\u00e1m, Mallanw\u00e1n, and Sandila cultivation has attained a high pitch, and the rents paid by the K\u00e1chhis for the potato and yam land near the towns reach Rs. 50 per acre. The latest official returns of rents are not trustworthy; they mention sugarcane and cotton lands as renting at Rs. 6-8-0 and 5-2-0 per acre, which is under the truth. The ordinary crops and trees of Kheri as described under that district are found in Hardoi; the large garden grounds of the latter district, 24,762 acres, are sown largely with pepper; the groves consist of excellent mango and j\u00e1mun trees; ajwadin is grown near the Ganges, and kusum or safflower is sown on the borders of the cereal crops. Descriptions of the above and of their uses are subjoined.\n\n\"Capsicum annum (Mirch).\u2014This is a native of South America. There are several varieties of it, distinguished by the shape of the fruit. Cayenne pepper is the produce of many of the smaller species of capsicum, the fruits being dried and pounded small, and mixed with salt. When gathered and eaten fresh, they are excellent promoters of digestion and are\nmade into pickles, and otherwise used for seasoning food. There are two distinct principles in the pods, one of which is an ethereal oil, and which constitutes the real stimulating principle. The bruised capsules are employed as powerful rubefacients, being reckoned preferable to sinapisms in sore-throats. They are also given, with the best results, as a gargle. Mixed with Peruvian bark, they are given internally in typhus and intermittent fevers, and dropsy. Chillies are a principal ingredient in all curries in India. By pouring hot vinegar upon the fruits, all the essential qualities are preserved, which cannot be effected by drying them, owing to their oleaginous properties. This chillie vinegar is an excellent stomachic, imparting a fine flavour to fish and meats. A great quantity is exported to England, especially from the West Indies, the price of chillies in London being from 15s. to 25s. the cwt.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 3.\n\n\"The Cayenne pepper is prepared in the following manner in the West Indies: the ripe fruits are dried in the sun, and then in an oven, after bread is baked, in an earthen or stone pot, with flour between the strata of pods. When quite dry they are cleaned from the flour and beaten or ground to fine powder. To every ounce of this a pound of wheat-flour is added, and it is made into small cakes with leaven. These are baked again that they may be as dry and hard as biscuit, and then are beaten into powder and sifted. It is then fit for use as pepper, or for being packed in a compressed state, and so as to exclude air, for exportation.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 112.\n\n\"Carthamus tinctorius (Kusum Barre).\u2014Description: annual, 1-2 feet; stem erect, cylindrical, branching near the summit; leaves oval, sessile, much animated, somewhat spiny; heads of flowers enclosed in a roundish spiny involucre; flowers large, deep orange. Flowers in November, December.\u2014(Roxb. Fl. Ind., iii. 409. Peninsula, cultivated).\n\n\"Economic uses.\u2014The dried flowers, which are very like saffron in appearance, have been employed to adulterate that drug. They contain a colouring principle called carthamitic acid, used by dyers, and constituting the basis of rouge. The flowers are used by the Chinese to give rose, scarlet, purple, and violet colours to their silks. They are thrown into an infusion of alkali and left to macerate. The colours are afterwards drawn out by the addition of lemon juice in various proportions, or of any other vegetable acid.\n\n\"The flowers are imported to England from many parts of Europe and from Egypt for dyeing and painting. They are also used for cakes and toys; but if used too much they have purgative qualities. Poultry fatten on the seeds. An oil of a light-yellow colour is procured from the seeds. It is used for lamps and for culinary purposes. The seeds contain about 28 per cent. of oil. The dried florets yield a beautiful colouring matter which attaches itself without a mordant. It is chiefly used for colouring cotton, and produces various shades of pink, rose, crimson, scarlet, &c. In Bangalore silk is dyed with it; but the dye is fugitive, and will not bear washing. An alkaline extract precipitated by an acid will give a\nfine rose colour to silks or cotton. The flower is gathered and rubbed down into powder, and sold in this state. When used for dyeing it is put into a cloth and washed in cold water for a long time, to remove a yellow colouring matter. It is then boiled, and yields the pink dyeing liquid. The Chinese safflower is considered superior to the Indian one. In Assam, Dacca, and Rajputana it is cultivated for exportation. About 300 tons are annually shipped from Calcutta, valued in England from \u00a36 to \u00a37-10 per cwt. That from Bombay is least esteemed.\n\n\"The mode of collecting the flowers and preparing the dye, as practised in Europe, where the plant is much cultivated, is as follows:\u2014The moment the florets which form the compound flowers begin to open, they are gathered in succession without waiting for the whole to expand, since, when allowed to remain till fully blown, the beauty of the colour is very much faded. As the flowers are collected they are dried in the shade. This work must be carefully performed, for if gathered in wet weather, or badly dried, the colour will be much deteriorated. These flowers contain two kinds of colouring matter\u2014the one yellow, which is soluble in water; the other red, which, being of a resinous nature, is insoluble in water, but soluble in alkaline carbonates. The first is never converted to any use, as it dyes only dull shades of colour; the other is a beautiful rose-red, capable of dyeing every shade, from the palest rose to a cherry-red. It is therefore requisite, before these flowers can be made available, to separate the valueless from the valuable colour; and since the former only is soluble in water, this operation is matter of little difficulty.\n\n\"The flowers are tied in a sack and laid in a trough, through which a slender stream of water is constantly flowing; while, still further to promote the solution of the yellow colouring matter, a man in the trough treads the sack, and subjects every part to the action of the water. When this flows without receiving any yellow tinge in its passage, the washing is discontinued, and the safflower, if not wanted for immediate use, is made into cakes, which are known in commerce under the name of stripped safflower.\n\n\"It is principally used for dyeing silk, producing poppy-red, bright orange, cherry, rose, or flesh colour, according to the alternative employed in combination. These are alum, potash, tartaric acid, or sulphuric acid. The fixed oil which the plant yields is used by the native practitioners in rheumatic and paralytic complaints. The seeds are reckoned laxative, and have been employed in dropsy, and the dried flowers in Jamaica are given in jaundice.\u2014Vegetable Substances, Jury Rept., Simmonds.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, pages 116-17.\n\n\"Ptychotis ajowan (Ajwain). Medical uses.\u2014The seeds have an aromatic smell and a warm pungent taste; they are much used by the natives for medicinal and culinary purposes. They are small plants of the umbelliferous order, and are to be met with in every market of India.\u2014(Roxb.)\n\n\"The virtues of the seeds reside in a volatile oil. They are stimulant, carminative, and antispasmodic, and are of much value in atonic dyspepsia.\"\nand diarrhoea. The preparation known as omum-water is a valuable carminative, useful in disguising the taste of nauseous drugs, and obviating their tendency to cause griping. The fruits of the *Ptychotis Roxburghianum* are valued by the natives as a stomachic and carmanative. They partake of the properties of the former, but in aroma are undoubtedly inferior.\u2014(Pharm. of Indian.) The wild plant is said to be poisonous. It probably contains apiol, an oily liquid used as a substitute for quinine.\u2014Powell's Punj. Prod.\u201d\u2014Drugs Useful Plants of India, page 360,\n\n\u201cSyzygium jambolanum (Jamun). Economic uses.\u2014The timber is fine, hard, and close-grained. The bark dyes excellent durable browns of various shades according to the mordant employed, or the strength of the decoction (Roxb. Wright). The tree attains its full size in forty years. The wood is dark-red, slightly liable to warp, but not subject to worms. It is used for agricultural implements (Balfour). It does not rot in water, and hence is used everywhere to line wells (Fleming). A communication was made to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Bengal, (January 1874), stating that with the fruit called jamun the writer had made in Rampur Bauleah a wine that, for its qualities and taste, was almost similar to the wine made from the grape. The wine was very cheap, as from two maunds of the fruit collected about one maund of wine was made, which cost altogether three rupees.\u201d\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 410.\n\nAgricultural statistics.\u2014A plough with two oxen will cultivate six acres of loam or clay soil, but eight acres of sand. The capital required to cultivate a plough of land will be Rs. 30 for a pair bullocks, Rs. 15 for the necessary implements, including a sugar-mill, Rs. 12 for the purchase of seed corn, Rs. 18 for the family maintenance for three and a half months till the first of the kharif crops comes in September: total Rs. 75. A plough costs about Re. 1-8-0, including the share, the harrow, a log of wood, eight annas. The capital is a trifle; the profits of cultivation are just enough to cover the wage of labour.\n\nPrices.\u2014I attach a list of the grain prices since 1835 at the principal mart in the district Madhoganj. The average price of wheat and Bajra in the last three decennial periods has been as follows in sers per rupee:\n\n| Year Range | Wheat | Bajra |\n|------------|-------|-------|\n| 1841\u20131850  | ...   | 34\u00b74  | 34\u00b79  |\n| 1851\u20131860  | ...   | 35\u00b70  | 35\u00b78  |\n| 1861\u20131870  | ...   | 26\u00b79  | 26\u00b74  |\n\nThe average prices for the last ten years 1866\u20131870 are in sers per rupee:\n\n| Grain     | Price |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Wheat     | 26\u00b79  |\n| Bajra     | 26\u00b74  |\n| Barley    | 32\u00b76  |\n| Gram      | 30\u00b78  |\n| Black paddy | 48\u00b76 |\n\nThese returns also show the remarkable fact commented on in the Kheri report, that bajra and the millet series are often sold to the poor by the\ngrain dealers at prices actually exceeding the rates at which the wealthy purchase wheat. A similar return quoted in the Etawah Settlement Report is as follows, the prices being in sers per rupee:\n\n|        | 1840-50 | 1850-60 | 1860-70 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Wheat  | ...     | 31\u00bd     | 28      | 24      |\n| Gram   | ...     | 44\u00bd     | 39      | 21      |\n| Bajra  | ...     | 60      | 44      | 26\u00bd     |\n| Gur    | ...     | 12\u00bd     | 13      | 7\u00bd      |\n\nI am not disposed to place implicit confidence in this return. There is always a danger that in one year the prices are those of harvest, in another those of seed time. It can hardly be, for instance, that in 1863 wheat was one maund per rupee, and bajra thirty sers\u2014one quarter dearer. But the broad fact remains borne out by this return that the food of the poor is increasing in price with greater rapidity than the food of the rich. The average harvest prices during the last two years are in sers per rupee:\n\n|        | Wheat | Barley | Rice | Gram |\n|--------|-------|--------|------|------|\n| May, 1872 | 23\u00b79  | 34\u00b75   | 9\u00b78  | 30\u00b72 |\n| \" 1873  | 16\u00b76  | 24\u00b72   | 12\u00b72 | 24\u00b72 |\n\nAccording to this return the prices of wheat, &c., in the years of scarcity were in sers per rupee:\n\n|        | Wheat | Bajra | Gram |\n|--------|-------|-------|------|\n| 1837   | 15    | 17    | 16   |\n| 1861   | 20    | 38    | 23   |\n| 1865   | 25    | 22    | 25   |\n| 1869   | 17    | 22    | 20   |\n\nBut this matter is referred to elsewhere in detail. Bajra was certainly not to be had at 38 sers the rupee during any considerable portion of the year 1868, and in September, 1869, bajra was at 9 sers for the rupee; but it is strange how this could be if arhar and Indian-corn were at 22 sers.\nPrice current of the M\u0101dhoganj Basar from the year 1835 A.D. to the year 1870 A.D., district Hardoi.\n\n| Year | Wheat | Barley | Gram | Bajra | Linseed

same as in the rest of Oudh. They take two meals a day, one at noon, the second at sun-down. The food-grains are mainly maize, kodo; b\u00e1jra, ju\u00e1r made into bread, barley, and gram parched and eaten dry, pottage of peas, moth and urd. Fish ought to be abundant, owing to the number of rivers and lakes, but on account of the dearness of salt they are, as appears from the following extracts, used as manure at one time of the year, while there is a scarcity during the remaining months:\n\nThe Collector of Hardoi reports\u2014\"Breeding and very young fish are destroyed without discrimination and to a great extent. They are caught in nets and baskets in jhils, tanks, and rivers at all seasons, but in greater quantity during the rainy season, and especially at its close. The smallest size of the mesh of nets employed is one-sixth of an inch. Traps are also used to collect fish of the smallest size, and are made of reeds. Were it politic, there would be no difficulty in regulating the size of the mesh of nets, but as he does not consider such a time has arrived, he refrains from suggesting what size of meshes he should consider advisable in his district. When fish are scarce in hilly districts, and as well elsewhere, there appears to be no objection against prohibiting their capture for a limited period when they are breeding.\"\n\nThe settlement officer of Hardoi in 1868 complained \"that there is no close season for fish here; they are caught every day of the year. Further, the meshes of the nets are made of any size, and occasionally fish are intoxicated or half-poisoned by a jungle fruit termed mainphal; but this can only be done in still water ponds and the like. Some land-\n### List of gh\u00e1ts or fords under Government management in the Hardoi district.\n\n| Hardoi | Name of village in which the gh\u00e1t is situate. | Name of gh\u00e1t. | Name of river. | Remarks. |\n|--------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------|\n| 1      | Bhatpur, pargana and tahsil Sandila           | Bhatpur-gh\u00e1t.  | Gumti          | This road goes from Bareli to Lucknow via Bhatpur. Carts of grain are taken from Sitapur and Lakhimpur (northerly districts), and sometimes carts go to Cawnpore via Sandila, Aur\u00e1s, and Ras\u00falabad. This gh\u00e1t lies on the road going from Khairigarh via Nimkh\u00e1r and Sandila to Lucknow, and another from Sandila via Kachbona and M\u00e1dhoganj goes to Mehndigh\u00e1t, and the third goes straight via Ghausganj to Mehndigh\u00e1t. On these roads, too, grain, &c., are abundantly exported. Generally grain is sold at M\u00e1dhoganj. The Hatia Haran mela concourse goes through this gh\u00e1t. The passage of carts daily amounts to 650 during the fair. This gh\u00e1t is near Nimkh\u00e1r. |\n| 2      | Ben\u00edganj, pargana Sandila                     | R\u00e9jgh\u00e1t.       | Gumti          | This gh\u00e1t is on the road to Fatehgarh N\u00e1np\u00e1ra, and as it is on the Sitapur road travellers are passing daily in great numbers.

In ordinary monsoons the highest discharge is about a quarter less than this. The river is crossed by the railway with a girder bridge with 3 openings, each of 56 feet. The flood discharges of the only other river, the Sukheta, of which the information has been obtained are given below. The Ganges, which borders the district, is elsewhere noticed:\n\n| River. | Waterway, linear feet. | Height. | Mean velocity. | Flood discharge per second in cubic feet. |\n|--------|-------------------------|---------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Sukheta.| 120                     | 18\u00b73    | 3\u00b752           | 11,856                                   |\n\nThere is no timber traffic on the rivers, except on the Garra.\n\nThere are no river-side towns of any kind; Sandila, Shahabad, Bilgr\u00e1m, Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, Hardoi are all far from any river, S\u00e1ndi is the only\nplace of any importance which is near a river (the Garra), but its population is not engaged in either trading or fishing. In fact no water traffic or fisheries worthy of note are met with in the district. Fine rohu are to be had in the Garra and R\u00e1mganga. None of the rivers or marshes have been embanked. Hardoi is worse off for wood than any other district; its jungles cannot be called woods, and less than two per cent. of its area has been planted with groves, which is perhaps the reason its rainfall is so much below the provincial average.\n\nFauna.\u2014There is nothing peculiar in the fauna of Hardoi; its features are similar to those of Partabgarh and Lucknow. No tigers have been seen for twenty years, but leopards are still found in the jungles near Pih\u00e1n\u00ed. Black buck are very numerous in Gopamau, and everywhere along the sandy banks of the Gumti herds of fifty are found. On the Ganges, near Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, they are not so common, but have much longer horns\u201424 inches are not infrequent. Nil-g\u00e1e are found in herds of forty in the jh\u00e1u jungle around Dharmpur between the Ganges and R\u00e1mganga, also near Pih\u00e1n\u00ed and Tandiaon in the jungles around the Sai. Spotted deer are found in the bamboo brakes near the villages in Gopamau and near Atwa, the residence of Th\u00e1kur Bh\u00e1rath Singh, half-way between Sand\u00edla and Hardoi. The four-horned deer has recently disappeared. The writer shot one in 1865. Hares have become unaccountably scarce since 1868; the floods are supposed to be the cause. The mallard, teal, grey duck, and common goose are more abundant in Hardoi than in any other district of Oudh. The range of jh\u00edls which dot the lower levels of the Sai valley abound in all kinds of water-fowl.\n\nClimate and sanitary conditions.\u2014The following account of the climate and sanitary conditions of Hardoi has been communicated by Dr. McReddie, the late civil surgeon.\n\nThe climate of Hardoi does not differ materially from that of Oudh generally. Hailstorms and tornadoes are perhaps more common and destructive; one in March 1868 destroyed crops to the value of Rs. 2,00,000. The average rainfall is said to have been 28 inches from 1862 to 1865, 28 inches in 1866, 55 inches in 1867, 14 in 1868, and this report gives the rainfall for years 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872 at 27, 47, 40, and 51 inches. The total rainfall will then average for the last ten years about 32 inches, that of the province being about 42. There is no doubt that Hardoi is perhaps the driest district in Oudh, even although the returns for the years before 1866 may not be strictly accurate. The average for the last five years in the adjoining district Sitapur is 34 inches. In the revenue report for 1872 the average rainfall for the last five years is given at 39 inches, as follows:\n\n| Year | Rainfall |\n|------|----------|\n| 1867 | 67\u00b78     |\n| 1868 | 24\u00b72     |\n| 1869 | 28\u00b71     |\n| 1870 | 46\u00b74     |\n| 1871 | 44\u00b78     |\n| 1872 | 33\u00b72     |\n\nIn 1873 the rainfall was only 21 inches, being considerably the lowest in Oudh, and again in 1874 the recorded rainfall in Bilgr\u00e1m has been only 31 inches, the lowest in Oudh.\nThe following statement gives the result of thermometric observations and rainfall of the Hardoi district as recorded in the sadr station. The statement is compiled from the records of the three years 1869, 1870, and 1871. Previous observations are not reliable. The second table gives the thermometrical observations for 1871 somewhat more in detail:\n\n| Months     | Mean daily range | Approximate mean of month | Rainfall |\n|------------|------------------|---------------------------|----------|\n| January    |                  |                           |          |\n| February   |                  |                           |          |\n| March      |                  |                           |          |\n| April      |                  |                           |          |\n| May        |                  |                           |          |\n| June       |                  |                           |          |\n| July       |                  |                           |          |\n| August     |                  |                           |          |\n| September  |                  |                           |          |\n| October    |                  |                           |          |\n| November   |                  |                           |          |\n| December   |                  |                           |          |\n\nChange abstract of meteorological register for 1871.\n\n| Months     | Standard Thermometer in Sadr. |\n|------------|--------------------------------|\n|            | Mean.                          |\n|            | Highest and dates.             |\n|            | Lowest and dates.              |\n| January    | 67\u00b72                           |\n|            | 1st 15th                       |\n|            | 77\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 13th and 14th 16th             |\n| February   | 75\u00b72                           |\n|            | 80\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 30th 3rd and 4th               |\n| March      | 85\u00b72                           |\n|            | 79\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 18th 23rd                      |\n| April      | 96\u00b70                           |\n|            | 102\u00b74.                         |\n|            | 20th 22nd                      |\n| May        | 94\u00b71                           |\n|            | 105\u00b74.                         |\n|            | 2nd and 3rd 29th               |\n| June       | 91\u00b73                           |\n|            | 104\u00b76.                         |\n|            | 2nd 23rd                       |\n| July       | 85\u00b73                           |\n|            | 93\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 7th and 14th 24th and 31st     |\n| August     | 85\u00b79                           |\n|            | 92\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 2nd 17th                       |\n| September  | 85\u00b77                           |\n|            | 93\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 4th 31st                       |\n| October    | 88\u00b77                           |\n|            | 92\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 1st 19th and 20th              |\n| November   | 79\u00b74                           |\n|            | 86\u00b74.                          |\n|            | 5th 27th and 29th              |\n| December   | 69\u00b71                           |\n|            | 87\u00b74.                          |\n\nHardoi is more subject to drought, hailstorms, and destructive tornadoes than other districts. In Kachhandan and Bilgram the lowlands are often flooded. No embankments or drainage schemes have been carried\nout. A plan has been submitted for draining the station. Locusts have occasionally been destructive over small areas. None of the rivers flood their banks to a serious extent, but the jhils in B\u00e1wan and Sandila sometimes cover a large extent of ground with their overflow.\n\nAnother table is appended showing the rainfalls of previous years, which are given for what they are worth; they were taken at the Hardoi dispensary:\n\n**Average fall of rain in Hardoi district, according to the revenue report taken at Hardoi, Bilgram, Shahding town Sandila.**\n\n| Years | Inches | Remarks |\n|-------|--------|---------|\n| 1865  | 30\u00b70   |         |\n| 1866  | 28\u00b70   |         |\n| 1867  | 67\u00b73   |         |\n| 1868  | 24\u00b72   |         |\n| 1869  | 28\u00b71   |         |\n| 1870  | 46\u00b74   |         |\n| 1871  | 44\u00b78   |         |\n| 1872  | 33\u00b72   |         |\n| 1873  | 21\u00b70   |         |\n| 1874  | 41\u00b76   |         |\n| 1875  | 28\u00b76   |         |\n\nAverage for 11 years, 35\u00b77\n\nThe accompanying table exhibits the rainfall for the last two years of drought, 1868 and 1873, each of which was followed in 1869 and 1874 respectively by considerable scarcity. It will be noted that the entire rainfall was scanty, the distribution capricious and unusual, and there was no rain during individual months in which it is much needed for agricultural purposes.\n\nThere are four rainfalls, each of which must be propitious to secure a good harvest.\n\n1st.\u2014The June rains, the former rains as they may be called. In 1873 they came only to one-third of an inch, quite insufficient to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice.\n\n2nd.\u2014The main monsoon, which commences in July and ends at the commencement of October. This was barely sufficient in either year, but the fall in September, 1868, was only 1\u00b78 inches, and it ceased too soon, viz., on September 20th.\n\n3rd.\u2014The latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice and moisten the land for the winter ploughings. These were wholly deficient in both years.\n\n4th.\u2014The January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869, and in 1874 were only one-third of an inch.\nSpeaking broadly then, the rains commenced well in 1868, badly in 1873. They ended with slight showers in 1868, and too soon; in 1873 they were scanty for the last month, and ended still earlier\u2014in September. So far 1873 was about equally bad with 1868; there was absolutely no rain in either year from October till January, but in February there was no rain in 1869, and a-third of an inch in 1874.\n\n| Total rainfall. | 1868. | 1873. |\n|-----------------|-------|-------|\n| From June 1st to October 1st | ... | 11\u00b720 | 18\u00b73 |\n| From October 1st to December 31st | ... | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b70 |\n| In June | ... | 2\u00b73 | 0\u00b73 |\n| \" September | ... | 1\u00b78 | 5\u00b78 |\n| \" October | ... | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b70 |\n| Date of rain commencing | ... | June 17th. | June 16th. |\n| \" of rain ending | ... | September 20th. | September 15th. |\n| Rain in January, February of ensuing year | ... | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b73 |\n\nTwo severe storms passed over the district in the hot seasons of 1865 and 1868. They did considerable damage to houses, trees, &c. The wind blew from the west, and travelled with considerable velocity. Slight shocks of earthquake have been occasionally felt, but they were not phenomena demanding special mention.\n\nMedical aspects.*\u2014Statistics of births have been discontinued from July, 1870. The records of deaths are given in the accompanying tabular statements for the years 1870 and 1871. Deaths are recorded by the agency of village chaukidars. The totals are probably correct, or at least an approximation to truth, but the causes of deaths given are quite unreliable.\n\nMalarian fevers are the only prevailing endemic diseases of the district, and they are to be attributed to the extensive marshes which abound. These diseases prevail to a small extent in the dry weather of the year, but subsequent to the close of every rainy season, i.e., from October to December (for about 2\u00bd months), the deaths from these causes are very large. No attempt has been made at drainage of swamps, but increased cultivation and the clearing of jungles have no doubt lessened sickness and mortality due to disease of malarious origin. No statistics, however, exist to institute a comparison between the mortality now and that sixteen years ago, at least none worthy of confidence. Sanitary efforts are very limited, and have not in the least tended to reduce the death-rate in any part of the district.\n\n* By the Civil Surgeon.\nCholera has never had a wide epidemicity in this district; the waves of epidemics which have passed over have caused small mortality, and the disease has quickly disappeared. It has presented no specific character, and its ravages did not appear confined to any particular classes of the population. It has generally prevailed in the rainy season. The mortality may be estimated at fifty per cent. of those attacked.\n\nSmall-pox prevails annually in the district, generally in the cold season, and it is to be feared causes a considerable number of deaths amongst the infant population. Few adults die of the disease, as they have all been protected by having had the eruption in early life. It is impossible to calculate the proportion of deaths to the number attacked. The return of deaths from this cause given in the statement includes those from measles and any other disease in which an eruption on the skin happens to be present; hence the figures barely give an approximation to the actual fact. Small-pox is not equally fatal every year. In 1867 it caused a very large mortality. Probably it would not be far from the truth to say that 80 per cent. of the young children died from this cause during the cold season of 1867-68. No other epidemics prevail in the district.\n\nCattle disease has unfortunately prevailed largely for several years; the two descriptions of disease which call for notice are those fully described in Dr. K. McLeod's communication, and denominated respectively \"parchina\" or \"barrie\" and \"kura\" (Digest of Chief Commissioner's Circulars, page 50, &c.) The former is a constitutional disease, the latter primarily local, but which destroys cattle by its effects; they are induced by neglect, filth, &c. The prominent symptoms in parchina are fever, looseness of the bowels, sore-throat, ulceration of the mouth and fauces, no eruption on the skin; in kura, ulceration and swelling of the foot. The natives make no attempt at treatment. It is impossible to state the approximate rate of mortality amongst the cattle attacked, probably 50 per cent. in parchina and 10 or 15 per cent. in kura. I hardly think that the extension of cultivation has anything to do with the prevalence of cattle disease. Pasture lands seem to be abundant.\n\nThe following drugs are known to be indigenous to the district:\n\n**Mineral.**\n1. Nitre or saltpetre (shora).\n2. Sal Ammonia (nausadar).\n\n**Vegetable.**\n3.

agricultural implements, wages of labourers, of coolies, of artizans, crops, times of sowing and reaping, rent, &c., the Lucknow and Kheri district accounts may be consulted.\n\nThe official returns of crop areas are apparently incorrect; they are as follows in the revenue report for 1872:\n\n| Staple       | Acres |\n|--------------|-------|\n| Wheat        | 314,183 |\n| Rice         | 74,630 |\n| Other edible grains | 858,650 |\n| Oilseeds     | 17,560 |\n| Sugar        | 23,306 |\n| Cotton       | 18,040 |\n| Opium        | 522    |\n| Indigo       | 1,422  |\n| Fibres       | 6,430  |\n| Tobacco      | 15,260 |\n| Vegetables   | 24,762 |\n\nTotal: 1,329,764 acres\n\nThe total area under crop in the year of survey was 844,560 acres, nor is it likely that much land has been brought under the plough in recent years. If so, even allowing for dufasli crops, the area in the above table must be exaggerated. Further, the table exhibits Hardoi as the greatest wheat-producing district in Oudh, although, according to the soil returns already quoted, it has a very large proportion of sandy soil which is unfitted for growing wheat. Hardoi produces very little rice, and that only of the common kinds, transplantation is not applied, and fine rice lands are often allowed to lie fallow. This is probably owing to the exceptional dryness of the district. In Bilgram, Mallanwan, and Sandila cultivation has attained a high pitch, and the rents paid by the Kachhis for the potato and yam land near the towns reach Rs. 50 per acre. The latest official returns of rents are not trustworthy; they mention sugarcane and cotton lands as renting at Rs. 6-8-0 and 5-2-0 per acre, which is under the truth. The ordinary crops and trees of Kheri as described under that district are found in Hardoi; the large garden grounds of the latter district, 24,762 acres, are sown largely with pepper; the groves consist of excellent mango and jamun trees; ajwain is grown near the Ganges, and kusum or safflower is sown on the borders of the cereal crops. Descriptions of the above and of their uses are subjoined.\n\n\"Capsicum annum (Mirch).\u2014This is a native of South America. There are several varieties of it, distinguished by the shape of the fruit. Cayenne pepper is the produce of many of the smaller species of capsicum, the fruits being dried and pounded small, and mixed with salt. When gathered and eaten fresh, they are excellent promoters of digestion and are\nmade into pickles, and otherwise used for seasoning food. There are two distinct principles in the pods, one of which is an ethereal oil, and which constitutes the real stimulating principle. The bruised capsules are employed as powerful rubefacients, being reckoned preferable to sinapisms in sore-throats. They are also given, with the best results, as a gargle. Mixed with Peruvian bark, they are given internally in typhus and intermittent fevers, and dropsy. Chillies are a principal ingredient in all curries in India. By pouring hot vinegar upon the fruits, all the essential qualities are preserved, which cannot be effected by drying them, owing to their oleaginous properties. This chillie vinegar is an excellent stomachic, imparting a fine flavour to fish and meats. A great quantity is exported to England, especially from the West Indies, the price of chillies in London being from 15s. to 25s. the cwt.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 3.\n\n\"The Cayenne pepper is prepared in the following manner in the West Indies: the ripe fruits are dried in the sun, and then in an oven, after bread is baked, in an earthen or stone pot, with flour between the strata of pods. When quite dry they are cleaned from the flour and beaten or ground to fine powder. To every ounce of this a pound of wheat-flour is added, and it is made into small cakes with leaven. These are baked again that they may be as dry and hard as biscuit, and then are beaten into powder and sifted. It is then fit for use as pepper, or for being packed in a compressed state, and so as to exclude air, for exportation.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 112.\n\n\"Carthamus tinctorius (Kusum Barre).\u2014Description: annual, 1-2 feet; stem erect, cylindrical, branching near the summit; leaves oval, sessile, much animated, somewhat spiny; heads of flowers enclosed in a roundish spiny involucre; flowers large, deep orange. Flowers in November, December.\u2014(Roxb. Fl. Ind., iii. 409. Peninsula, cultivated).\n\n\"Economic uses.\u2014The dried flowers, which are very like saffron in appearance, have been employed to adulterate that drug. They contain a colouring principle called carthamitic acid, used by dyers, and constituting the basis of rouge. The flowers are used by the Chinese to give rose, scarlet, purple, and violet colours to their silks. They are thrown into an infusion of alkali and left to macerate. The colours are afterwards drawn out by the addition of lemon juice in various proportions, or of any other vegetable acid.\n\n\"The flowers are imported to England from many parts of Europe and from Egypt for dyeing and painting. They are also used for cakes and toys; but if used too much they have purgative qualities. Poultry fatten on the seeds. An oil of a light-yellow colour is procured from the seeds. It is used for lamps and for culinary purposes. The seeds contain about 28 per cent. of oil. The dried florets yield a beautiful colouring matter which attaches itself without a mordant. It is chiefly used for colouring cotton, and produces various shades of pink, rose, crimson, scarlet, &c. In Bangalore silk is dyed with it; but the dye is fugitive, and will not bear washing. An alkaline extract precipitated by an acid will give a\nfine rose colour to silks or cotton. The flower is gathered and rubbed down into powder, and sold in this state. When used for dyeing it is put into a cloth and washed in cold water for a long time, to remove a yellow colouring matter. It is then boiled, and yields the pink dyeing liquid. The Chinese safflower is considered superior to the Indian one. In Assam, Dacca, and Rajputana it is cultivated for exportation. About 300 tons are annually shipped from Calcutta, valued in England from \u00a36 to \u00a37-10 per cwt. That from Bombay is least esteemed.\n\n\"The mode of collecting the flowers and preparing the dye, as practised in Europe, where the plant is much cultivated, is as follows:\u2014The moment the florets which form the compound flowers begin to open, they are gathered in succession without waiting for the whole to expand, since, when allowed to remain till fully blown, the beauty of the colour is very much faded. As the flowers are collected they are dried in the shade. This work must be carefully performed, for if gathered in wet weather, or badly dried, the colour will be much deteriorated. These flowers contain two kinds of colouring matter\u2014the one yellow, which is soluble in water; the other red, which, being of a resinous nature, is insoluble in water, but soluble in alkaline carbonates. The first is never converted to any use, as it dyes only dull shades of colour; the other is a beautiful rose-red, capable of dyeing every shade, from the palest rose to a cherry-red. It is therefore requisite, before these flowers can be made available, to separate the valueless from the valuable colour; and since the former only is soluble in water, this operation is matter of little difficulty.\n\n\"The flowers are tied in a sack and laid in a trough, through which a slender stream of water is constantly flowing; while, still further to promote the solution of the yellow colouring matter, a man in the trough treads the sack, and subjects every part to the action of the water. When this flows without receiving any yellow tinge in its passage, the washing is discontinued, and the safflower, if not wanted for immediate use, is made into cakes, which are known in commerce under the name of stripped safflower.\n\n\"It is principally used for dyeing silk, producing poppy-red, bright orange, cherry, rose, or flesh colour, according to the alterative employed in combination. These are alum, potash, tartaric acid, or sulphuric acid. The fixed oil which the plant yields is used by the native practitioners in rheumatic and paralytic complaints. The seeds are reckoned laxative, and have been employed in dropsy, and the dried flowers in Jamaica are given in jaundice.\u2014Vegetable Substances, Jury Rept., Simmonds.\"\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, pages 116-17.\n\n\"Ptychotis ajowan (Ajwain). Medical uses.\u2014The seeds have an aromatic smell and a warm pungent taste; they are much used by the natives for medicinal and culinary purposes. They are small plants of the umbelliferous order, and are to be met with in every market of India.\u2014(Roxb.)\n\n\"The virtues of the seeds reside in a volatile oil. They are stimulant, carminative, and antispasmodic, and are of much value in atonic dyspepsia;\"\nand diarrhoea. The preparation known as omum-water is a valuable carminative, useful in disguising the taste of nauseous drugs, and obviating their tendency to cause griping. The fruits of the *Ptychotis Roxburghianum* are valued by the natives as a stomachic and carmanative. They partake of the properties of the former, but in aroma are undoubtedly inferior.\u2014(Pharm. of Indian.) The wild plant is said to be poisonous. It probably contains apiol, an oily liquid used as a substitute for quinine.\u2014Powell's Punj. Prod.\u201d\u2014Drugs Useful Plants of India, page 360,\n\n\u201cSyzygium jambolanum (Jamun). Economic uses.\u2014The timber is fine, hard, and close-grained. The bark dyes excellent durable browns of various shades according to the mordant employed, or the strength of the decoction (Roxb. Wright). The tree attains its full size in forty years. The wood is dark-red, slightly liable to warp, but not subject to worms. It is used for agricultural implements (Balfour). It does not rot in water, and hence is used everywhere to line wells (Fleming). A communication was made to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of Bengal, (January 1874), stating that with the fruit called jamun the writer had made in Rampur Bauleah a wine that, for its qualities and taste, was almost similar to the wine made from the grape. The wine was very cheap, as from two maunds of the fruit collected about one maund of wine was made, which cost altogether three rupees.\u201d\u2014Drury's Useful Plants of India, page 410.\n\nAgricultural statistics.\u2014A plough with two oxen will cultivate six acres of loam or clay soil, but eight acres of sand. The capital required to cultivate a plough of land will be Rs. 30 for a pair bullocks, Rs. 15 for the necessary implements, including a sugar-mill, Rs. 12 for the purchase of seed corn, Rs. 18 for the family maintenance for three and a half months till the first of the kharif crops comes in September: total Rs. 75. A plough costs about Re. 1-8-0, including the share, the harrow, a log of wood, eight annas. The capital is a trifle; the profits of cultivation are just enough to cover the wage of labour.\n\nPrices.\u2014I attach a list of the grain prices since 1835 at the principal mart in the district Madhoganj. The average price of wheat and Bajra in the last three decennial periods has been as follows in sers per rupee:\n\n| Year Range | Wheat | Bajra |\n|------------|-------|-------|\n| 1841\u20131850  | ...   | ...   |\n| 1851\u20131860  | ...   | ...   |\n| 1861\u20131870  | ...   | ...   |\n\nThe average prices for the last ten years 1866\u20131870 are in sers per rupee:\n\n| Grain     | Price |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Wheat     | 26-9  |\n| Bajra     | 26-4  |\n| Barley    | 32-6  |\n| Gram      | 30-8  |\n| Black paddy | 43-6 |\n\nThese returns also show the remarkable fact commented on in the Kheri report, that bajra and the millet series are often sold to the poor by the\ngrain dealers at prices actually exceeding the rates at which the wealthy purchase wheat. A similar return quoted in the Etawah Settlement Report is as follows, the prices being in sers per rupee:\n\n|                | 1840-50 | 1850-60 | 1860-70 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Wheat          | ...     | 31\u00bd    | 28      | 24      |\n| Gram           | ...     | 44\u00bd    | 39      | 21      |\n| Bajra          | ...     | 60      | 44      | 26\u00bd     |\n| Gur            | ...     | 12\u00bd    | 13      | 7\u00bd      |\n\nI am not disposed to place implicit confidence in this return. There is always a danger that in one year the prices are those of harvest, in another those of seed time. It can hardly be, for instance, that in 1863 wheat was one maund per rupee, and bajra thirty sers\u2014one quarter dearer. But the broad fact remains borne out by this return that the food of the poor is increasing in price with greater rapidity than the food of the rich. The average harvest prices during the last two years are in sers per rupee:\n\n|                | Wheat | Barley | Rice | Gram |\n|----------------|-------|--------|------|------|\n| May, 1872      | 23\u00b79  | 36\u00b75   | 9\u00b78  | 30\u00b72 |\n| \" 1873         | 16\u00b76  | 24\u00b72   | 12\u00b72 | 24\u00b72 |\n\nAccording to this return the prices of wheat, &c., in the years of scarcity were in sers per rupee:\n\n|                | Wheat | Bajra | Gram |\n|----------------|-------|-------|------|\n| 1837           | 15    | 17    | 16   |\n| 1861           | 20    | 38    | 28   |\n| 1865           | 25    | 22    | 25   |\n| 1869           | 17    | 22    | 20   |\n\nBut this matter is referred to elsewhere in detail. Bajra was certainly not to be had at 38 sers the rupee during any considerable portion of the year 1868, and in September, 1869, bajra was at 9 sers for the rupee; but it is strange how this could be if arhar and Indian-corn were at 22 sers.\nPrice current of the M\u0101dhoganj Bazar from the year 1835 A.D. to the year 1870 A.D., district Hardoi.\n\n| Year | Wheat | Barley | Gram | Bajra | Linseed

They take two meals a day, one at noon, the second at sun-down. The food-grains are mainly maize, kodo; b\u00e1jra, ju\u00e1r made into bread, barley, and gram parched and eaten dry, pottage of peas, moth and urd. Fish ought to be abundant, owing to the number of rivers and lakes, but on account of the dearness of salt they are, as appears from the following extracts, used as manure at one time of the year, while there is a scarcity during the remaining months:\n\nThe Collector of Hardoi reports\u2014\"Breeding and very young fish are destroyed without discrimination and to a great extent. They are caught in nets and baskets in jhils, tanks, and rivers at all seasons, but in greater quantity during the rainy season, and especially at its close. The smallest size of the mesh of nets employed is one-sixth of an inch. Traps are also used to collect fish of the smallest size, and are made of reeds. Were it politic, there would be no difficulty in regulating the size of the mesh of nets, but as he does not consider such a time has arrived, he refrains from suggesting what size of meshes he should consider advisable in his district. When fish are scarce in hilly districts, and as well elsewhere, there appears to be no objection against prohibiting their capture for a limited period when they are breeding.\"\n\nThe settlement officer of Hardoi in 1868 complained \"that there is no close season for fish here; they are caught every day of the year. Further, the meshes of the nets are made of any size, and occasionally fish are intoxicated or half-poisoned by a jungle fruit termed mainphal; but this can only be done in still water ponds and the like. Some land-\nowners preserve fish and guard them, but the bulk of the proprietary bodies certainly do destroy fish wantonly. They take every fish they can catch at all seasons, whether the females are breeding or not, and whether the males are what is called spent fish or are in full condition.\"\u2014Francis Day's Fresh-Water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma, para. 284.\n\n\"The tahsildar of Hardoi gives the fishermen at 2,000, all of whom are said to also follow other occupations; their castes are Kah\u00e1rs and Baurias, especially the latter. The local markets are insufficiently supplied with fish; more, it is observed, could be sold. The large sorts realize from one to one and a half anna a ser, the small from six to nine pies a ser, and mutton two annas for the same quantity. Two-thirds of the population are stated to be fish consumers. The supply is asserted to have increased; very small ones are taken in large numbers, in nets and baskets of various sorts, whilst the minimum size of the mesh of the nets will not allow a grain of gram to pass. Fish are also trapped in inundated fields during the rains. The nets employed are tapa, dhundhi, katia, and khanchas.\"\n\n\"The tahsildar of Bilgram reports that fish are often used as manure; the other tahsildars that the nets will not allow grains of wheat or barley to pass. All state that the market is insufficiently supplied.\"\u2014Francis Day's Fresh-Water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma, para. 302.\n\nCultivation in Hardoi is backward compared to the adjoining district of Fatehgarh. Opium culture is a fair test of this. The districts do not differ materially in size, but in 1873-74 opium cultivation in Hardoi averaged 7,383 acres; in Fatehgarh 16,012 acres; the outturn in Hardoi averaged 7\u00b72 sers; in Farukhabad 8\u00b74 sers; the imperial income from opium in the one district vastly exceeded that of the other. In these two years the Farukhabad opium amounted to 6,803 maunds 29 sers, that of Hardoi to 2,652 maunds 22 sers. As the average weight of each opium chest is one maund 28 sers, and the net profit to Government Rs. 834 per chest, it will appear that the imperial revenue in Farukhabad was Rs. 33,37,668, and in Hardoi Rs. 13,01,040; but, indeed, this condition of things is general throughout the province.\n\nIt appears from tables supplied by the opium agent, Gh\u00e1zipur, that in the twelve districts of Oudh the acreage and outturn of opium were as follows:\n\n| Acreage | Outturn in maunds |\n|---------|------------------|\n| 1873    | 1874             |\n| 64,406  | 63,026           |\n|         |                  |\n| Sers.   | Sers.            |\n| 8,614   | 11,523           |\n\nAverage produce per acre ... ... { 1873 ... 5\u00b734 } mean 6\u00b732.\n\nAverage acreage per district, 5,859.\n\nIn the four bordering districts of the North-Western Provinces\u2014Azamgarh, Jaunpur, Fatehpur, Farukhabad\u2014the results are as follows:\n\n| Acreage | Outturn in maunds |\n|---------|------------------|\n| 1873    | 1874             |\n| 33,315  | 33,016           |\n|         |                  |\n| Sers.   | Sers.            |\n| 5,902   | 7,219            |\n\nAverage produce per acre ... ... { 1873 ... 7\u00b708 } mean 7\u00b793.\n\nAverage acreage per district, 8,291.\nIt would appear then that in similar and adjoining districts the acreage under opium is 40 per cent. larger in the North-Western Provinces than in Oudh, and the produce per acre 25 per cent. better.\n\nTrade, commerce, and manufactures.\u2014Mahm\u00fadi, a muslin, is still produced at Shahabad, but there are no other manufactures of any note in Hardoi; even such local industries as the weaving of T\u00e1nda, Nawabganj, and Baisw\u00e1ra, the cotton printing of Kheri do not flourish in Hardoi. Swords of good temper were formerly made at Pihi\u00e1ni, also turbans; the latter craft is declining, the former has expired. It has a considerable transit trade in importing English fabrics from Fatehgarh, and exporting grain and sugar. There are no European establishments, except an indigo manufactory which was started in 1873.\n\nThe fairs are given in the following table, they all are for religious purposes; none are of any importance as commercial centres:\n\n| Date of fair | Name of fair | Place where held | Object of fair | Number of days it lasts | Estimated number of people who attend it from first to last | Extreme distance from which numbers of people come to it |\n|--------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Ku\u00e1r Sudi, Dasami, 18th September. | Dasabra ... | Bilgr\u00e1m ... | R\u00e1ml\u00edla ... | 10 | 40,000 | 30 |\n| K\u00e1rtik P\u00faranm\u00e1shi Sudi, 15th October. | K\u00e1tki ... | Neoragh\u00e1t, pargana Bilgr\u00e1m. | Bathing in the Ganges. | 3 | 7,000 | 50 |\n| Do. do., do. ... | Ditto ... | Majhuriagh\u00e1t ... | Ditto ... | 3 | 7,000 | 40 |\n| Do. do., do. ... | Ditto ... | Bir\u00edagh\u00e1t, pargana Kachhandan. | Ditto ... | 3 | 5,000 | 20 |\n| Jeth, 10th May, | Charso ... | Asauli, pargana Bangar. | Visiting the tomb of a saint (Pir). | 1 | 1,500 | 10 |\n| 9th and 10th of the moon in September, 9th and 10th of the moon in March. | B\u00e1b\u00e1ji ... | Hardoi ... | Worship of Hardeo B\u00e1b\u00e1. | 4 | 2,000 | 10 |\n| Agban Badi ... | Dhanuk Jagg, Bandan ... | Celebration of R\u00e1n\u2019s marriage. | 3 | 2,000 | 12 |\n| 7th and 8th of moon in September. | Debij\u00ed ... | Bahur, pargana Gopamau. | Offering made to Debl. | 2 | 4,000 | 10 |\n| Date of fair | Name of fair | Place where held | Object of fair | Number of days it lasts | Estimated number of people who attend it from first to last | Extreme distance from which numbers of people come to it |\n|-------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n| Ashmi, May and June, 14th May. | Mah\u00e1deo ... | N\u00edr, pargana Gopamau. | Offering made to Mah\u00e1deo. | 1 | 1,000 | 8 |\n| 10th Jeth, May and June, 11th May. | L\u00e1l P\u00edr ... | Gopamau ... | Offering made at the tomb of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, a saint. | 2 | 4,000 | 8 |\n| 6th November ... | Tirath Debl, | Ditto ... | Visitors bathe in a sacred pond or tank. | 2 | 3,000 | 20 |\n| Ku\u00e1r Sudi Daemi | Dasahra ... | Umr\u00e1oli, pargana Sara ... | Sacred tank at Narbada, pargana Shahanbad. | 3 | 3,000 | 10 |\n| K\u00e1rtik Sudi Ek\u00e1dashi ... | Deoth\u00e1n Ek\u00e1dashi ... | Bathing at the sacred tank. | 2 | 10,000 | 24 |\n| Jeth or As\u00e1rh | Chari ... | Narbada, pargana Shahanbad. | Offering made to Debl. | 1 | 2,000 | 2 |\n| 29th November | Prambhans-k\u00ed-sam\u00e1dh ... | Bar\u00e1gya, pargana Shahanbad. | Do. to Sam\u00e1d. | 1 | 15,000 | 40 |\n| 7th April ... | Ditto ... | Hattia Haran ... | Ditto ditto ...

The gatherings at all except the last two are small. None are of any commercial importance, and none have either given rise to, or favoured the attacks of, epidemic disease. They are all, those at Bilgr\u00e1m and Neoragh\u00e1t excepted, strictly local gatherings.\n\nIn 1872 the imports from the adjoining districts of Cawnpore, Sh\u00e1h-jah\u00e1npur, Fatehgarh came to Rs. 7,21,000, the exports to Rs. 3,19,000.\n\nThe principal imports were\u2014\n\n| Maunds | Rs. |\n|--------|-----|\n| Cotton | 6,462 | 1,17,608 |\n| Salt | 22,554 | 1,28,387 |\n| Country cloth | 1,86,728 | 1,55,728 |\n| English piece-goods | 1,63,683 |\nThe principal exports were\u2014\n\n| Maunds | Rs.   |\n|--------|-------|\n| Gur (coarse sugar) | 14,850 | 46,838 |\n| Tobacco | 5,748 | 23,256 |\n| Edible grains | 81,606 | 60,920 |\n| Horned cattle (No.) | 5,937 | 1,16,592 |\n| Hides | ... | 20,149 |\n\nTobacco is much undervalued in the above table.\n\nThe railway has given a great impetus to trade; it passes through the district for 62 miles. In 1873 the outward traffic amounted to 7,399 tons, nearly all grain, the inward to 1,324 tons. None of this has been noted in the official report given above. In 1874, as the accompanying table will show, there was a still greater advance of the grain traffic, and the little station of Hardoi, whose population is 6,415, has as much grain traffic as great cities of Bareli and Shahjahanpur combined, whose population amounts to 180,000. This is shown in the annexed table:\n\n**Statement showing the weight of grain traffic in maunds during the undermentioned months.**\n\n| Stations       | December, 1873 | January, 1874 | February, 1874 | Total |\n|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|-------|\n| Bareli         | 4,248          | 3,610         | 12,039         | 19,897|\n| Hardoi         | 4,369          | 12,704        | 8,093          | 25,166|\n| Sitapur road   | 1,557          | 1,997         | 2,993          | 6,557 |\n| Sandila        | 7,463          | 9,012         | 5,733          | 22,208|\n| Cawnpore       | 5,836          | 8,326         | 17,211         | 30,773|\n| Shahjahanpur   | 1,994          | 3,724         | 16             | 5,734 |\n| **Total**      |                |               |                | **1,10,385**|\n\nThis is in great measure due to the emancipation of buyers and sellers from the system of local cesses imposed by the landed proprietors. The railway company has wisely established a free market beside the station, in which dealings are conducted, and no charge made.\n\nIn 1873 the traffic at the various stations on the railway within the boundaries of the Hardoi district was as follows:\n\n| Stations     | Outward | Inward |\n|--------------|---------|--------|\n|              | Passenger | Total amount | Merchandise | Total amount | Passenger | Total amount | Merchandise | Total amount |\n| Sandila      | No. 28,241 | \u00a3887 | Tons. 1,175 | \u00a3832 | No. 22,803 | \u00a3834 | Tons. 510 | \u00a3159 |\n| Balamau      | No. 6,115 | \u00a3226 | Tons. 136 | \u00a334 | No. 6,829 | \u00a3228 | Tons. 67 | \u00a324 |\n| Sitapur Road | No. 5,219 | \u00a3179 | Tons. 842 | \u00a3118 | No. 4,751 | \u00a3158 | Tons. 188 | \u00a377 |\n| Hardoi       | No. 31,735 | \u00a31,515 | Tons. 4,887 | \u00a31,555 | No. 32,573 | \u00a31,604 | Tons. 514 | \u00a3284 |\n| Chandpur     | No. 2,318 | \u00a3100 | Tons. 51 | \u00a316 | No. 3,978 | \u00a382 | Tons. 45 | \u00a322 |\n| Ajji         | No. 11,322 | \u00a3384 | Tons. 308 | \u00a3200 | No. 10,784 | \u00a3361 | Tons. 45 | \u00a322 |\n| **Total**    | No. 79,945 | \u00a33,390 | Tons. 7,399 | \u00a32,255 | No. 81,918 | \u00a33,268 | Tons. 1,324 | \u00a3566 |\nRoads and communications.\u2014There are no metalled roads in the district. The railway runs through from Lucknow to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, trains stopping at six stations in the district in a length of sixty-two miles; it was opened at different times in 1871-72. There are also 329 miles of roads raised and bridged. The principal are:\u2014\n\nFrom Lucknow to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur.\n- Hardoi to Sitapur.\n- \" to Fatehgarh (only partially bridged).\n- \" to Bilgr\u00e1m, thence to Mehndigh\u00e1t.\n- Sandila to M\u00e1dhoganj, Bilgr\u00e1m, and S\u00e1ndi.\n- Hardoi to Pih\u00e1n\u00ed.\n\nNone of these are imperial roads. None of the stations in the line of railway have as yet become centres of traffic. Sandila, the centre of a fertile grain-producing tract, and a town with a population of 15,500, only contributed about Rs. 1,600 in fares and traffic receipts to the railway in 1871. But in 1874 Hardoi and Sandila have developed a very large trade in supplying Lucknow with bread-stuffs; the former sends 500 tons a month of grain alone. Sheds have been erected by the company, and as many roads converge on Hardoi, a fine traffic may reasonably be expected. The passengers arriving at and leaving Hardoi in the first half-year of 1873 were 30,340, at Sandila 24,376\u2014vide table under heading \u201cCommerce and Manufactures.\u201d\n\nThe minor district roads are:\u2014\n\n1. From Hardoi via Bargadiagh\u00e1t to Sitapur. This is twenty-two miles long within this district. The stages are\u2014\u00cdtauli, six miles from Hardoi; Bharail, five miles further; Kinau, five miles, and N\u00edms\u00e1r, six miles. The only river is the Gumti.\n\n2. Sitapur and Mehndigh\u00e1t road, i.e., from Bargadiagh\u00e1t in this district to the border of the district (banks of the Ganges). Total length of this road is thirty-three miles. The stages are\u2014Besia, six miles from N\u00edms\u00e1r; Lodhia, seven miles from Besia; M\u00e1dhoganj, eight miles; Matiamau, six miles; and the bank of the Ganges, six miles. The rivers are the Gumti and the Kaly\u00e1ni.\n\n3. Gop\u00e1mau to Pih\u00e1n\u00ed. The stages are only Gopamau and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed at the distance of eight miles from each other.\n\n4. Pih\u00e1n\u00ed to Kul\u00e1bhargh\u00e1t on the Gumti. The length of this road is ten miles. The stages are Ballheri and Kul\u00e1bhargh\u00e1t, the latter at the distance of six miles from the former.\n\nLocal weights and measures.\u2014The tahsildars of Hardoi and Shahabad report as follows:\u2014A local kachcha bigha is twenty qadams long by twenty broad, the qadam being fifty-two anguls or finger\u2019s breadth. The angul is three-quarters of an inch, therefore the qadam is thirty-nine inches; the bigha will then be a square of sixty-five feet, or an area of 469 square yards. But the bigha in general use is much larger than this. In Bangar, Shahabad, Pachhoha, Pali, and Gopamau three local bighas go to the regulation bigha of 3,025 square yards; in Pindarwa, Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, Mansurnagar two and a half;\nin B\u00e1wan, Sara three bigha fifteen biswa local bighas are included in the regulation bigha. The subject is treated in detail in Kheri. The table of linear distance is as follows\u2014\n\n\\[8 \\text{ barleycorns} = 1 \\text{ angul}\\]\n\\[22 \\text{ ,,} = 1 \\text{ d\u00e1nd}\\]\n\\[1000 \\text{ ,,} = 1 \\text{ kos.}\\]\n\nPrinsep\u2019s useful tables, page 130.\n\nThe kos will then equal one mile and a half and twenty-six yards.\n\nThere is a local pakka ser in use, or rather in reputed use, weighing Rs. 96; these of course were the Lucknow Machhlish\u00e1hi rupees of 172 grains, the sers now in use being eighty tolas of 180 grains. The two sers then weigh respectively Rs. 16,512 and Rs. 14,400. There is also a small local ser and maund in general use, as everywhere, throughout Oudh. Their weight differs in different markets; on the average the local maund equals eighteen regulation sers. The theory is that the local ser should weigh Rs. 32, or exactly one-third of the larger or pakka ser. But, as we have seen with reference to the land measure, theory and practice differ widely.\n\n**Interest.**\u2014Ordinary interest is 15 per cent. on security of landed property, or 24 per cent. on small transactions, but money can be got at 12 per cent. in very large sums; if jewellery is pledged, interest at Re. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2 per month is charged; if the lien is on clothes or other perishable article, interest reaches Rs. 3-8-0. Advances made to tenants for subsistence by the grain dealers are repaid at market prices, sometimes with the addition of two annas in the rupee. In this way the money-lender, on transactions covering a brief space of time, often gets 80 per cent. for his money. The special custom called *up* is described elsewhere.\nCHAPTER III.\n\nPOPULATION.\n\nThe people\u2014Population\u2014Castes\u2014Towns with their population\u2014Distribution of landed property

Muhammadans number 85,824, Hindus 845,293. The principal castes and sects of both are given in the following table. There is nothing particularly worthy of note in it, except the great number of the Chamars, who form 15 per cent. of the whole. It is also worthy of remark that the Chamar Gaurs, said to be connected with the Chamars, have their principal settlement in this district, where they have no less than 217 villages. Of the Hindus in Hardoi 54\u00b71 per cent. are males and 45\u00b79 are females. Of the Musalmans 51 per cent. are males and 49 per cent. are females. There is no immigration or emigration to any extent. During the first year after annexation there was a considerable reflux wave of persons who had fled to avoid the oppression of the Nawabi; that has ceased, and there are indications that in time emigration will commence, but it has not assumed any dimensions.\n\n### Caste Statement of Hardoi district.\n\n#### Musalmans.\n\n| Name       | Population |\n|------------|------------|\n| Mewati     | 122        |\n| Iraqi      | 155        |\n| Sayyad     | 5,360      |\n| Shekh      | 11,926     |\n| Pathan     | 15,584     |\n| Mughal     | 809        |\n| Bhatia     | 509        |\n| Jalaha     | 11,144     |\n| Ghosi      | 9,747      |\n| Kunjra     | 1,510      |\n| Qasai      | 2,127      |\n| Bhend      | 234        |\n| Dhari      | 343        |\n| Mujawir    | 124        |\n| Paturia    | 1,310      |\n| Saqqa      | 175        |\n| Dafali     | 197        |\n| Ranki      | 540        |\n| Bangrez    | 351        |\n| Salagalar  | 130        |\n| Other Musalmans | 9,645 |\n\n#### Hindus.\n\n| Name       | Population |\n|------------|------------|\n| Brahman    | 112,101    |\n| Chhattiri  | 75,708     |\n| Vaishya    | 25,681     |\n| Kayaith    | 9,479      |\n| Jat        | 902        |\n| Sikh       | 129        |\n| Khatri     | 2,812      |\n| Arak       | 15,005     |\n| Ahir       | 65,814     |\n| Bhunjwa    | 12,491     |\n| Bhait      | 3,834      |\n| Banjara    | 244        |\n| Bahelia    | 605        |\n| Barhi      | 667        |\n| Barhi      | 12,574     |\n| Beldar     | 441        |\n| Baddri     | 795        |\n| Bhangi     | 4,291      |\n| Pasi       | 62,367     |\n| Patwa      | 953        |\n| Tamoli     | 6,862      |\n| Teli       | 21,579     |\n| Thathera   | 1,651      |\n| Jaga       | 152        |\n| Cham\u00e1r     | 144,208    |\n| Chhipi     | 361        |\n| Hialwai    | 1,958      |\n| Dhobi      | 14,817     |\n| Dharkar    | 9,701      |\n| Bansphor   |            |\n| Dh\u00e1nuk     |            |\n| Dhunia     | 9,456      |\n| Dom        | 256        |\n| Dasandh    | 167        |\n| Darzi      | 6,141      |\n| Raj        | 645        |\n| Sun\u00e1r      | 3,660      |\n| Kumh\u00e1r     | 8,616      |\n| Kurmi      | 19,975     |\n| Kah\u00e1r      | 26,613     |\n| Kalv\u00e1r     | 7,658      |\n| Kanjar     | 149        |\n| Korl       | 6,894      |\n| Gareria    | 30,815     |\n| G\u00fajar      | 372        |\n| Kisan      | 14,086     |\n| Gandhi     | 164        |\n| Lodha      | 12,876     |\n| Lonia      | 2,097      |\n| Loh\u00e1r      | 9,671      |\n| Mur\u00edo      | 49,460     |\n| M\u00e1nh\u00ed      | 1,151      |\n| Mall\u00e1n     |            |\n| M\u00e1l\u00ed       | 2,919      |\n| Mochi      | 676        |\n| Manih\u00e1r    | 2,965      |\n| N\u00e1o        | 15,306     |\n| Nat        | 1,618      |\n| Goah\u00e1in    | 1,036      |\n| Other Faqirs| 8,625      |\n| Jog\u00ed       | 838        |\n| Bairagi    | 477        |\n| S\u00e1dhu      | 551        |\n| Persons whose caste is not known | 11,195 |\n| Travellers | 1,242      |\nThe Musalmans reside principally in the large towns, such as Bilgr\u00e1m, Sand\u00edla, Shahabad, and S\u00e1ndi, but even in these they form the minority. As in the Bara Banki district, they have in some places inhibited the building of temples, and recently, when they protested against a temple being erected by a Hindu r\u00e1ja on his own land in the town of Sand\u00edla, it appeared on inquiry that no temples ever had been built in the town by the Hindus, owing to the bigotry of their Musalman neighbours. But such instances are not common in Oudh. On the other hand, the Musalmans often join in the R\u00e1ml\u00edla and other celebrations of the Hindus; their love of pomp and ceremony induces them to adopt occasions for their display, even from the ritual of the idolater, while pride rather than bigotry induces them to keep out of sight the temples of a rival faith. Kanjars, a predatory tribe, are very numerous in this district; they apparently were absent when the census was taken; their habits are nomad.\n\nThe other tribes of the district call for no notice. I need only mention here the principal clan of the Chhattirs in order according to their numbers:\n\n| Clans     | Number | Number of villages owned |\n|-----------|--------|--------------------------|\n| Gaur      | ...    | 11,000                   | 232                      |\n| Panw\u00e1r    | ...    | 10,000                   | 66                       |\n| Chauh\u00e1n   | ...    | 9,000                    | 30                       |\n| Sombansi  | ...    | 8,000                    | 178                      |\n| Bais      | ...    | 6,000                    | 94                       |\n| Chandel   | ...    | 3,000                    | 51                       |\n| Janw\u00e1r    | ...    | 3,000                    | 32                       |\n| Sakarw\u00e1r  | ...    | 2,000                    | 73                       |\n| Belw\u00e1r    | ...    | 2,000                    | 5                        |\n| Kati\u00e1r    | ...    | 1,500                    | 112                      |\n| Bhadsuria | ...    | 1,500                    | 1                        |\n| Rathor    | ...    | 1,500                    | 3                        |\n\nIn all there are forty-four clans of Chhattirs numbering 75,078. They and the Brahmans are mostly cultivators or yeomen proprietors. There are no hill tribes or distinctively aboriginal castes in the district, although there is little doubt that the P\u00e1s\u00eds and Dh\u00e1nuks, with the Lodhs, probably belong to a layer of population anterior to the Aryan colonization.\n\nTowns.\u2014There are no less than five towns in Hardoi with a population above 10,000, there being only 18 such in the entire province. It is not easy to say what is the reason of this. None of them are places of any trade; not one of them, except S\u00e1ndi, is even situated on a navigable river. The railroad has not succeeded in attracting much trade to or from the\nthree towns which it passes\u2014Hardoi, Sandila, and Shahabad. The principal towns and their population are:\n\n| Town          | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Shahabad     | 18,254     |\n| Sandila      | 16,511     |\n| Bilgram      | 11,534     |\n| Mallanwan    | 11,670     |\n| Sandi        | 11,123     |\n| Pihani       | 7,583      |\n| Hardoi       | 6,415      |\n| Gopamau      | 5,949      |\n| Pali         | 5,132      |\n\nOf these the first seven have been subjected to local taxation for the maintenance of police, but in Hardoi alone has a municipal committee been appointed under Act XV. of 1867; its revenue from taxation in 1871 was Rs. 15,675, almost entirely from octroi; its expenditure was Rs. 16,657.\n\nThe following are the Chhatri clans which possess most property in the district:\n\n| Name of clan | Number of villages | Parganas in which situated |\n|--------------|--------------------|----------------------------|\n| Sombansi     | 178                | Bawan 68, Sandi 17, Pali 52, Saromannagar 20. |\n| Nikumbh      | 114                | Sandila 50, Alamnagar 22, Pihani 19, Mallanwan 14. |\n| Katiar       | 112                | Sandi 35, Katiari 61. |\n| Gaur         | 232                | Sara 63, Barwan 42, Shahabad 14, Gopamau 28, Saromannagar 15, Bangar 36. |\n| Bais         | 94                 | Gundwa 81. |\n| Sakawar      | 73                 | Kalyanmal 68. |\n| Panwar       | 66                 | Mallanwan 64. |\n| Chandel      | 51                 | Gopamau 26, Keshhandan 16. |\n| Gahilwar     | 45                 | Gopamau 24, Bangar 10. |\n| Abban        | 39                 | Gopamau 33. |\n| Janwar       | 38                 | Sandila 13. |\n| Chanhan      | 30                 | Gopamau 11. |\n| Raiwar       | 28                 | Mallanwan 13, Balamau 8. |\n| Kachhwaha    | 13                 | |\n| Rathor       | 4                  | |\n| Banteli      | 14                 | |\n| Raghubansi   | 7                  | |\n| Gautam       | 4                  | |\n| Kachria      | 7                  | |\n| Bachhil      | 9                  | |\n| Bhadwaria    | 1                  | |\n| Banaphar     | 1                  | |\n\nNo other district in Oudh can present such a distribution of property\u2014twenty-four clans instead of the five or six which are found in Rae Bareli or Partabgarh. This is to be accounted for partly by the proximity of the district to Kanauj, the king of which place would naturally settle his retainers indiscriminately over the country, and would not allow any clan to acquire exclusive authority over a large tract; partly it was due to the fact that Hardoi was a sort of border land between the Abbans to the north-east, the Gaurs to the south-west, the Bais to the south and east, the Sombansi to the west.\nNo less than thirteen of the twenty-four clans have large landed interests. The Raikw\u0101rs lost 64 villages in B\u0101lamau after the mutiny through the confiscation of the property of their leader Narpat Singh. There is a great Kati\u0101r colony in the extreme north-west of the district; passing east we find an ancient Sombansi settlement; south of it a Raikw\u0101r and Chandel colony; still further east we find the Gauurs holding the centre of the district; the greater part of several parganas to the south forms the settlement of Sakarw\u0101rs, Nikumbhs, and Bais; to the east Gopamau, formerly belonging to the Ahban kingdom (vide Kheri article), now broken up among a number of clans; while to the north the Panw\u0101rs hold most of Pachhoha.\n\nThe tribes in some cases acquired such exclusive possession of the land that the parganas were made coterminous with their boundary, or nearly so. Vide following table:\n\n| Name of pargana | No. of villages | Leading clan | No. of villages held by it |\n|-----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|\n| Gundwa          | 117            | Bais         | 81                        |\n| K\u0101ly\u0101nmal       | 72             | Sakarw\u0101r     | 63                        |\n| Sara            | 85             | Gaur         | 68                        |\n| Kati\u0101r          | 80             | Kati\u0101r       | 81                        |\n| Alamnagar       | 43             | Nikumbh      | 22                        |\n| P\u0101li            | 92             | Sombansi     | 59                        |\n| Barwan          | 69             | Ditto        | 68                        |\n\nIn other cases parganas were formed from the lands surrounding or within easy reach of some Musalman town, like Shahabad, Bilgr\u0101m, Sand\u012bla, Mansurnagar; in other cases again, as in that of Gopamau, the pargana represents, not the possessions of a clan, but the ancient dominion of a chief. In Hardoi, unlike Partabgarh, no one clan acquired predominance over such an extensive tract of country that it now constitutes a tahsil. The point will be dwelt on in connexion with the comparative absence of the feudal or r\u0101ja element in Hardoi society.\n\n**Division of landed property.**\u2014The landed property in this district is more evenly divided under the different tenures than is usual in Oudh. The distribution is as follows:\n\n- Taluqdari: 39\u00bd\n- Zamindari: 795\u00bd\n- Pattidari: 758\n\nThe following is the distribution among the different clans and castes:\n\n- Chhatt\u012b: 1,157\n- Musalm\u0101n: 406\u00bd\n- Brahman: 150\u00bd\n- K\u0101yath: 157\u00bd\n- Gosh\u0101\u012bn: 4\n- Ahir: 6\u00bd\n- Kurmi: 16\nKalw\u00e1r ... ... ... ... ... 2\nBagg\u00e1l ... ... ... ... ... 2\nLodh ... ... ... ... ... 6\u00bd\nBh\u00e1t ... ... ... ... ... 1\nM\u00e1li ... ... ... ... ... 1\nEuropean ... ... ... ... ... 2\nNative Christian ... ... ... ... ... 8\nMixed ownership ... ... ... ... ... 3\nGovernment ... ... ... ... ... 45\n\nTotal ... ... ... ... ... 1,961\n\nDistribution of property in Akbar's time 1590 A.D.\u2014The following list of the proprietors, as given in the Ain-i-Akbari, may be of interest. The district was then divided between the two Sarkars of Khairabad and Lucknow:\n\nKhairabad Sark\u00e1r.\n\n| Name of pargana. | Proprietors. |\n|------------------|-------------|\n| P\u00fall.            | \u00c1sas or Ah\u00edrs.

Allowing for errors in the manuscript, the stability of property among Hindus is very remarkable. The parganas of Gopamau, S\u00e1ndi, Bilgr\u00e1m, Kachhand\u00e1n are held now, as they were held in Akbar's time, by the same Chhattri clans. The Chauh\u00e1ns, Bais, and B\u00e1chhils have apparently lost ground, also the Brahmins, while the Gaurs, Raikw\u00e1rs, Nikumbhs, who are really Kachhw\u00e1has, have established themselves since Akbar's time. On the whole the Rajputs have held their ground, one tribe giving place to another. The change which has been mainly effected is the aggrandizement of the Musalmans and the decline of the Brahmins. Musalmans now hold great part of Sandl\u00e1 and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed and Shahabad; they are only mentioned in Akbar's time as the part owners of Bilgr\u00e1m. The Kunwars who are recorded as owners of Gopamau are the Abbans, still the largest proprietors. The word is either a clerical error for Ch\u00e1wars, the original name of the Abbans, or it is applied to them as a younger branch. It is only in Hardoi that Brahman zamindars still have any considerable number of villages; in other districts which boast a considerable Brahman ownership the proprietors are all taluqdars.\n\nThe larger proprietors in the district are mentioned in the following table:\u2014\n**Return illustrating the ownership and rental of taluqas in the Hardoi district.**\n\n| Name of taluqa. | Name of

often referred to elsewhere in these pages. Dip Singh of Saw\u00e1jpur and possibly R\u00e1ja Hardeo Bakhsh of Kati\u00e1ri are the only acknowledged chiefs of clans, the only men whose taluqdari title does represent and embody a real feudal power and influence over their subjects. One or two of the smaller estates, however, are very old and real alodial properties. The Sayyads of Bilgr\u00e1m acquired their estates by purchase about two hundred years ago for the most part. Colonel Sleeman mentions the Sand\u00edla landlords in the following terms:\u2014\n\n\"The baronial proprietors in the Sundeela district are Murdan Sing. of Dhurawun, with a rent-roll of Rs. 88,000; Gunga Buksh, of Atwa, with\none of Rs. 25,000; Chundeeka Buksh, of Birwa, with one of Rs. 25,000; and Somere Singh, of Rodamow, with one of Rs. 34,000. This is the rent-roll declared and entered in the accounts; but it is much below the real one. The Government officers are afraid to measure their lands, or to make any inquiries on the estates into their value, lest they should turn robbers and plunder the country, as they are always prepared to do. They have always a number of armed and brave retainers, ready to support them in any enterprise, and can always add to their number on emergency. There is never any want of loose characters ready to fight for the sake of plunder alone. A talookdar, however, when opposed to his government, does not venture to attack another talookdar or his tenants, stands too much in need of his aid, or at least of his neutrality and forbearance.\"\n\nIt is rather curious that the large proprietors of Sandila as it at present stands\u2014Chaudhri Hashmat Ali, Fatehchand, Dhanpat Rae\u2014are not even mentioned. Theirs were chakladari estates, and apparently it was not considered that their farms represented property at all, otherwise it seems difficult to account for Colonel Sleeman's omission to mention men actually in his camp. The history of the Hardoi taluqdars will be referred to further on. Here it is only necessary to state that they are above the average in intelligence and enterprise. The present owners of Sandila and Bilgram are men of considerable ability. Raja Hardeo Bakhsh of Katiai is as fine a specimen of a feudal chief as Oudh can present. A just and kind landlord, an upright and truthful man, a soldier of approved courage, an adept in all manly exercises, he has also shown himself to be within his small range a statesman of prescience and broad views. He temporised with the rebels during the first months of the mutiny of 1857: he pretended submission to the usurper at Lucknow, knowing that if a sudden attack were made upon him in May or June he could not protect either himself or Messrs. Edwards and Probyn who had taken shelter with him. With the first fall of the rains, when his dominion became an island in the middle of pathless fens and girt by swift deep rivers, he threw off the mask and bade defiance to the rebels. He has been rewarded as he deserved for his unswerving loyalty. The good service which he rendered in war he continues in more peaceful times. His advice is always sound and unselfish, and no one's aid and society are more welcome in Hardoi, whether to those who follow the chase of the boar or to those who administer justice in the courts. His stalwart form and frank face are well known throughout. Unlike most of his class, his active habits induce him to be constantly on horseback. Noblemen of such high character are really a most important and beneficial power in the state. They are loved by their dependants with that fond fidelity which sterling goodness attracts, and which this primitive society is ready to tender. A wise good Hindu chief who belongs to the soldier caste, who was trained in a harsh school, whose religion still guides him to justice and benevolence, but not to bigotry, deserves to have his portrait drawn in these pages. He and his estate are to a certain extent self-made. He is not the hereditary chief of his clan, being descended from a younger son, and had many struggles with the former sovereigns of Oudh to preserve his property and liberty.\nThe small proprietors.\u2014The principal feature of the Hardoi proprietary body is the enormous number of small owners. There are in Hardoi 1,569 villages not belonging to taluqdars; these cover 1,105,000 acres, and are owned by 21,758 proprietors, giving an average of fifty acres to each proprietor, of which two-thirds will be arable. Many of these proprietors, however, have brothers and cousins whose separate shares are not recorded. There are 823 zamindari villages, 728 pattidari, and 18 bhayach\u00e1ra. It is very strange why the r\u00e1j or the feudal chiefship system should not have gained ground in Hardoi. It almost seems as if it was owing to the climate that a bolder and more independent spirit animated the inhabitants of Unao, Hardoi, Lucknow, and southern Kheri than in eastern and Northern Oudh, the Tar\u00e1i, and the trans-Gogra districts.\n\nSuch large estates as do exist in Hardoi are purely the result of revenue arrangements, even when the owners belong to powerful clans. A younger scion of the Nikumbhs accumulated the estate of Atwa, another of the Chamar Gaurs that of Khajurahra, another of the Kat\u00ed\u00e1rs that of Dharmpur, another the Raikw\u00e1r estate of Ruia; none of these men were r\u00e1jas or considered their property as indivisible.\n\nThe paucity of feudal lordships in Hardoi accounted for.\u2014The reasons of this are obscure. It only removes the inquiry a stage further back to urge that the Chhattri clans were too numerous and too much intermingled in Hardoi to admit of continuous domination by any one member of a single clan. It is quite true that in some cases the present proprietary bodies represent the Chhattri retainers who were settled indiscriminately over the territory by the Moslem lords of Bilgr\u00e1m, Shahabad, and Pih\u00e1n\u00ed. When a mixed body of Brahman and Chhattri retainers has been scattered sporadically over a territory it is impossible to establish a r\u00e1j which shall have in itself any of the elements of cohesion or permanence; such are only the attributes of a feudal chiefship which is coterminous with the allodial property of a numerous and powerful clan. Blood relationship to the chief supplies the place of military discipline and preserves the principality from external foes and internal dissensions. Another solvent of feudal estates was the presence of large Musalman towns, such as Bilgr\u00e1m, Sand\u00edla, Shahabad, and S\u00e1ndi; the existence of these Moslem military stations with their republican policy, fanaticism, and soldiery instincts was incompatible with the neighbourhood of a great Hindu r\u00e1j like that of Partabgarh, Gonda, Mitauli, or Mor\u00e1mau. Moslems, as soldiers of fortune, and as possessors of a faith which made all men equal, were bound to attack all whose wealth, Hindu faith, and noble station gave them a fatal prominence. Just as the Sayyads of Bilgr\u00e1m overturned the Sombansi r\u00e1ja of that ilk, those of Sand\u00edla the P\u00e1s\u00ed chiefs, so did the Malihabad Path\u00e1ns drive the Bais from their borders. Further, Hardoi was on the great highway from Delhi to Jaunpur and Bengal. Tall poppies do not grow by the roadside. These things account for large principalities never having flourished in Hardoi; they do not account for large clans like the Nikumbhs, Chamar Gaurs, Sakarw\u00e1rs, Panw\u00e1rs never having elected a r\u00e1ja. They show that even when a clan had mastered a compact estate, the r\u00e1ja was regarded as an ornamental appendage which might or might not be added.\nThe great mistake made by those who assume that in Western Oudh a r\u00e1j or a taluqa was the natural form which landed property assumed, the first crystallization from chaos, so to speak, is an historical one. They assume that a Rajput clan headed by its chief invaded Oudh from Mangi P\u00e1tan or some other P\u00e1tan in Western India; that this chief conquered a principality for himself, and that he maintained in peace the same absolute power over the persons and property of his clan which was necessary in war. Now the traditions of no clan, not even the Bais, the Ahban, the Kanhpuria, the Sombansi, the Bachgoti, which number hundreds of thousands of members, point to any such wholesale immigration and conquest. What took place was as follows:\u2014A single individual, or three brothers at most settle in the country and prosper; they commence in all cases by dividing the property equally among all the sons, showing that the idea of a r\u00e1j, one and indivisible, had not entered their minds; they succeed by some process of natural selection or freak of fortune; other families give place to them; they multiply and continue subdividing their property. If it happens that any call is made on the military prowess of the family now become a clan, if they have constantly to fight for their property, or are successful in seizing that of others, it is not unlikely that their natural leader, the head of the elder branch, may either be nominated a r\u00e1ja by his clan, or be granted the title by the supreme authority. Once granted or admitted, there is no doubt that the title, and the power which accrues to it, are apt to be permanent. Custom and hereditary names are all-powerful in Oudh; but the writer's point is that r\u00e1j is not the natural form which property takes in Western Oudh at all. R\u00e1j has hardly anything to do with landed property; it represents sovereignty, military control, and will only develop into allodial property as a military usurpation in troublous times for the good of the commonwealth. The r\u00e1ja will call in war time for a war contribution from all the subjects of the state; he does that, not for his personal gain, but as the head of the commonwealth and for its weal. Nor does it by any means follow that a clan will see the necessity of having a r\u00e1ja even for military matters; there are clans in Hardoi who have their untitled chiefs to whom in all times of turmoil their obedience is absolute.\n\nOn the banks of the Ganges in Kachhandan there lived a Chandel, a yeoman chief of this kind; he was the master of only one village, but his power and influence over the whole clan was unbounded. When R\u00e9ja Hardeo Bakhsh of Kati\u00e1ri had no power to protect the Fatehpur fugitives, he secured the good offices of this old man, who pledged his word for the Englishmen's safety; he embarked in their boat, and his answer to the hoarse challenges from the river bank was always received and obeyed as a command not to use hostile measures; for many a mile down the Ganges his presence secured absolute safety. Very probably, if the Oudh anarchy had continued a few generations, this man's grandson might have become a r\u00e1ja, got the whole property of the clan into his clutches, and antedated his r\u00e1j, as having come in with the conquerors. It is very true that when a r\u00e1j was once established, the power of the clan under its new head would be directed to conquest from other clans, and the new acquisitions so made would very probably be regarded mainly as the allodial property of the\nr\u00e1ja alone, with which he might reward his retainers; but here again the r\u00e1j arose as the result of war and military aggression. We have instances (see articles Sikandarpur and Kheri district) of the establishment or re-establishment of a r\u00e1j by the voluntary election of the people in order to further the common interests or protect them from the common enemy, the supreme government.\n\nThe r\u00e1ja's titles are generally most modern inventions; there was no r\u00e1ja of the Bisens before Hanwant Singh none of the Janw\u00e1rs till two generations ago, none of the Ahbans, the oldest clan in Oudh, till R\u00e1ja Lone Singh's time; they never had a r\u00e1ja in Hardoi; there is none of the Kalhans, of the Chamar Gaurs, of the B\u00e1hman Gaurs; there was none of the J\u00e1ngres till Jodha Singh conquered Dhaurahra. In point of fact, in times of ordinary tranquillity, even of such tranquillity as was common in Oudh, there was no necessity for a r\u00e1ja, and no Indian Government, unless in the last stage of decay, would have tolerated the existence of any r\u00e1ja within its dominions whom it could possibly or safely reduce to subjection.\n\nNo doubt, at the break up of each empire, a number of able men started into local greatness; when the Jaunpur kingdom was broken up, the Bais, the Kanhpuria, the Sombansi, the Bachgoti clans found it convenient to have r\u00e1jas; with the establishment of settled order and the Mughal empire, the unity of the r\u00e1j vanished, and property was divided according to the ordinary Hindu law. Again, when the Mughal empire broke up, were established the Muhamdi, Kaimahra, K\u00e1la K\u00e1nkar, the Dhaurahra, the Kati\u00e1ri, the Dera principalities. Again, when the Oudh kings had lost all real power and devoted themselves to sensuality, there arose the great principalities of Oel, Sh\u00e1hganj, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrabad, Mahmudabad, Mau-r\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Sissaindi. On what did these principalities rise? Not on the ruins of others; if so, there would be numerous traces left. The Bil-kharia r\u00e1ja, for instance, was dispossessed six hundred years ago, but he has maintained his title and honours on a petty principality of eight villages, compared to which Monaco is an empire. But I have met with no other banished princes; in fact the r\u00e1j rose on the wrecks of village proprietary communities, and no other opinion can be formed by those who take care to extend their inquiries beyond the mere family trees of the r\u00e1jas.\n\nThat r\u00e1jas were not congenial to the soil of Hardoi, that the people resisted the outward pressure of the Lucknow Government, and the temptation to raise a strong barrier against foreign oppression, goes to show that r\u00e1jas, far from being the natural outcome of rural life, the natural political result of the Hindu economy, were a lien, if not distasteful to the people, only accepted as a means of escape from greater evils, from more distant and harsher tyrants. At any rate there were no r\u00e1jas in Hardoi, in the sense of hereditary chiefs of great clans, and lords of their lands. D\u00edp Singh* of Siw\u00e1jpur is possibly an exception, and it is expressly re-\n\n---\n\n* He is believed with truth to be a descendant of the R\u00e1ja Sr\u00ed, whose town of Sr\u00edngar, now Bilgr\u00e1m, was captured by the Moslems in or about 803 N., 1400 A.D.\u2014Vide Elliot's History of India, vol. IV., pp. 37-38.\ncorded about him that as fast as younger branches of the family came into existence they were provided for independently. The mode in which R\u00e1ja Randh\u00edr Singh acquired his title is related in pargana Malihabad.\n\nI have elsewhere pointed out (Kheri) that when the community was a mingled one, where any one Chhattir clan acquired ascendancy over a large body of aliens, either of other Chhattirs or of lower castes, their position was that of a military colony among a hostile subject race; there was always risk of a revolt; discipline and prompt action were a necessity of their position, so they yielded ready obedience to a single chief who became their r\u00e1ja. When, on the other hand, a clan was really numerous and occupied a compact territory, so that it had little to fear from internal risings, it found no necessity for a r\u00e1ja; the whole body fought together for the common interest; each component village was known and entitled to the assistance of all if attacked. It was customary to divide the estate into particular numbers of villages, either chaurdsi; 84 or baydis, 42, or 52, bawan; a solidity and unity were thus given to the aggregation of atoms which was useful as a rallying cry in stirring up patriotism, and in impressing the extent of the clan's rights and interests upon strangers.\n\nIn fine, the original internal polity was always republican, unless where any one small clan had acquired a political supremacy or military dominion over numerous subjects. If there arose dangers of oppression from without, or invasion by Moslem aliens, the frequent habit of military obedience became in time permanent feudal dependence, and the r\u00e1ja became the natural and chosen protector of the people; when again the Musalman soldier tax-gatherer was warlike and near at hand in some walled city, the r\u00e1ja was often killed, the taluqa broken up, and very oppressive exactions and imposts taken from the people.\n\nThose r\u00e1jas who survived compromised with the Government, paid tribute, and became mere tax-gatherers. In time also the Oudh Government found that it would be more convenient to have resident middlemen who could collect their dues everywhere, and the policy of introducing such was largely carried out during the last twenty years prior to annexation. In Hardoi there were never any r\u00e1jas except one, of Sew\u00e1jpur; but many large talugas were either formed for the first time or aggrandized from mere zamindaris during the thirty years preceding annexation.\n\nThere is a very considerable difference between the two kinds of taluqa. In the one case the r\u00e1ja is either the descendant of some ancient independent chieftain who ruled the people prior to the advent of Musalman authority, or he is a chief chosen by the people as a protector and a lord, when internal dissensions or external dangers demonstrated their need of a wise head and a single hand at the helm. In the other case the false taluqdar was not chosen by the people as a ruler, but was imposed upon them by the Government, not to perform the functions of a ruler or judge, but simply those of a tax-gatherer. In India the tax-gatherer under native rulers has always been the most powerful element in the state; where there were no courts or police, he was the only authority; and if localized, his existence determined the political and, in a great measure, the social system.\nThe yeomen proprietors; their difficulties.\u2014The body of yeomen proprietors in Hardoi is sensibly diminishing; the rains are more precarious there than in most parts of Oudh; what was only scarcity in the province became famine in Hardoi in 1865 and 1869; the proprietors find it difficult to collect rents and pay the land tax. Under any circumstances, it is almost impossible for a body of small proprietors whose lands are intermingled to abstain from quarrelling, and when once litigation commences it is almost certain that whoever is worsted will mortgage and ultimately sell his few ancestral acres. In fact it is almost impossible that the majority of these communities of proprietors will survive; they could resist the storms of oppression from without, but internal dissensions and discord commence at once when they have received from the justice and moderation of the British Government a fixed and definite property. One-nineteenth of the entire property in Hardoi was transferred from the hands of the yeomen proprietors during the year 1871, and was mostly purchased by bankers and bani\u00e1ns, sugar-boilers, usurers, distillers, and skin-dealers\u2014men of little political power or value to the state. The difficulty which attends any effort to improve the circumstances of the Oudh military class is a complex one. On the one hands it is considered undesirable in a military sense to increase the high caste element at present in the army, lest it return to the state of things which preceded and brought on the mutiny of 1857. It is no longer an object of ambition to place Brahmans and Chhattis side by side in a regiment of tall and stately P\u00e1ndes, from which all low castes are to be excluded. Further, it would be an advantage gradually to wean the fighting yeomanry from their ancient pursuits, and induce them to beat their swords into ploughshares; their caste pride now forbids them to plough with their own hands, and it would only encourage such folly if military service were kept before them as an employment, to which all or many of them could aspire. On the other hand, if they are granted any favours, not personal, anything in the shape of a low assessment upon their lands, it is difficult to hinder them from selling the lands, and nothing is gained by transferring the favour to others for whom it is not intended. Distinctions of this kind are also regarded as invidious and unfair by other classes, who urge that there is no reason why they should be taxed more heavily because they are industrious and willing to labour with their hands.\n\nThis is very true, and yet something apparently must be done. There are 21,000 recorded proprietors of land, nearly all high caste Brahmans and Chhattis, in Hardoi alone; there are 14,000 in Lucknow; altogether there are at least 100,000 adult male proprietors of patches of land varying in size from 10 acres to 200. The vast majority of these have less than 50 acres each, the average* is about 22 acres. It is not desirable to withdraw men of this class from their field and make soldiers of them; it is very difficult to lower the Government demand upon their lands; yet, unless something is done, many out of this enormous body of pauper yeomen will lose the one bond which unites them to the state, will see their ancestral acres pass into the hands of men whose birth and profession they scorn,\n\n* See article Rae Bareli.\nthey will become a body of needy desperadoes, natural enemies to peace and social order, the elements of agrarian anarchy, and a serious weakness politically.\n\nThe transfers of landed and immoveable property, complete or inchoate, amounted to 5,361 during the years 1873-74; the amount to Rs. 15,05,818. Now the revenue of the great estates which practically have not been mortgaged amounts to Rs. 3,53,089, that of the numerous smaller proprietors to Rs. 11,00,341; in two years then they involved themselves and their properties to the extent of much more than a year's income. The value of their properties at twelve times the Government revenue\u2014a fair valuation\u2014will be only Rs. 1,82,00,092; at this rate they should all be sold out in 8\u00bd years. But many of these mortgages are not the first transaction, the sums entered include loans of previous years; still, after making every allowance the prospect is alarming.\n\nStatement showing the aggregate value of property transferred by documents registered in 1873 and 1874.\n\n| Description of deeds | Number of deeds | Amount |\n|----------------------|----------------|--------|\n|                      | 1873 | 1874 | Total | 1873 | 1874 | Total |\n| Deeds of sale of Rs. 100 and upwards | 297 | 229 | 526 | 1,92,649 | 1,29,710 | 3,22,359 |\n| Do. less than Rs. 100 | 3,0 | 258 | 438 | 13,189 | 12,423 | 25,604 |\n| Do. of mortgage of Rs. 100 and upwards | 2,383 | 980 | 3,363 | 6,64,010 | 4,16,408 | 1,080,918 |\n| Do. do less than Rs. 100 | 1,015 | 1,015 | ... | 75,800 | 75,806 | ... |\n| Do. of gift | 9 | 10 | 19 | ... | 1,137 | 1,187 |\n| **Total** | **2,969** | **2,492** | **5,361** | **870,341** | **635,477** | **1505,818** |\nCHAPTER IV.\nADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES.\n\nAdministrative divisions\u2014Th\u00e1sas\u2014Administration\u2014Police\u2014Income-tax\u2014Revenue\u2014Expenditure\u2014Local taxation\u2014Crime and criminal classes\u2014Education\u2014Post-office.\n\nAdministrative divisions.\u2014Hardoi is divided into four tahsils and twenty-one parganas, (see preliminary table).

There is one policeman to every four square miles, and to every 1,700 of the inhabitants.

It will be observed that the imperial expenditure is only 12 per cent. of the income, even excluding from the latter the receipts from salt and opium which enter the imperial exchequer. The land revenue constitutes 90 per cent. of the income; it has been increased 42 per cent. at the recent settlement. The assessment commenced in 1864 and terminated in 1868.\n\nThe incidence of the Government demand is:\n\n| Per acre of cultivation | Rs. as p. |\n|-------------------------|-----------|\n| Per arable acre         | Rs. as p. |\n\nThe revenue derived from the income-tax is given in the table, but it is not now exacted. It will appear that the landowners contributed Rs. 6,804 out of Rs. 7,607, or 85 per cent. of the whole; yet, undoubtedly, much of the wealth of the country is in the hands of the banking and trading classes.\n\nRevenue.\n\n|                      | 1871. | 1872. | Remarks |\n|----------------------|-------|-------|---------|\n| 1.

The local fund receipts will then be Rs. 85,956. It appears therefore that the imperial and local expenditure amounts to Rs. 1,87,052 + 1,10,881 = 2,97,933, and the taxation to Rs. 16,12,999 + 85,956 = 16,98,955.\n\nThe district therefore is educated, governed, and improved; apart from the cost of external superintendence, for about Rs. 0-6-0 per head; and the expenditure is only 17 per cent. of the revenue. The above revenue does not include that derived from opium, salt, or sea customs.\n\nReceipts.\n\n| Description                          | Rs.   |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|\n| One per cent. road cess             | 14,558|\n| Ditto school cess                   | 14,605|\n| One-quarter per cent. district d\u0101k  | 3,724 |\n| 2\u00bd ditto local rates and margin cess| 41,834|\n| Education fund                      | 1,789 |\n| Dispensary ditto                    | 2,948 |\n| Pound ditto                         | 5,498 |\n| Nazul ditto                         | 1,800 |\n| Provincial allotment                |       |\n| Total Rs.                           | 85,956|\n| Provincial allotment                | 24,646|\n\nGrand total.

Cattle theft flourishes, but still there must be some reason for the comparative immunity of Hardoi from crime. In 1872 there were only 5,251 cases reported to the police and cognizable by them. Fyzabad, with the same population, had 11,178, Pattabgarh, with a much smaller population, had 6,307. Perhaps the fact that there are a great number of resident landholders in Hardoi to watch their tenantry and be responsible for them may account for this. Unao, which is similarly situated in this respect, had only 5,458 crimes reported. Kanjars and P\u0101s\u012bs are the most criminal. Accidental deaths are shown in a separate table, but probably some of them are murders.\nCrime statistics for Hardoi district.\n\n|                                | Cases reported | Cases convicted |\n|--------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|\n|                                | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 |\n| Murders and attempts           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Culpable homicide              |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Dacoity                        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Robbery                        |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Rioting and unlawful assembly  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Theft by house-breaking or    |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| house-trespass                 |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Theft, simple                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Theft of cattle                |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Offences against coin and      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| stamps                         |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n\nComparative memorandum of accidental deaths for the years 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, and 1872 in district Hardoi.\n\n|                                | Suicides | By drowning | By snake-bites | By wild quadrupeds | By fall of buildings | By other causes | Total |\n|--------------------------------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|\n|                                | Males    | Females     | Males          | Females            | Males               | Females        |       |\n|                                |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1867                           | 92       | 97          | 58             | 89                 | 7                   | 14             | 10    |\n| 1868                           | 85       | 63          | 57             | 70                 | 7                   | 9              | 10    |\n| 1869                           | 96       | 89          | 68             | 63                 | 8                   | 10             | 14    |\n| 1870                           | 19       | 44          | 108            | 113                | 49                  | 60             | 4     |\n| 1871                           | 25       | 48          | 92             | 93                 | 49                  | 101            |       |\n| 1872                           | 29       | 47          | 135            | 106                | 65                  | 70             | 2     |\n\nEducation.\u2014Education has made very good progress in Hardoi. There are 4,762 children attending the schools, there are 13 female schools, and the central school at Hardoi has turned out some very creditable pupils. Education seems appreciated by the yeomen, who are aware of their own deficiencies; still the subscriptions in aid of education in 1871 were only Rs. 1,746. In the zila school at the central station the fees were Rs. 426, and the Government expenditure was Rs. 4,331. There are no newspapers, literary or educational societies in the district, nor are there any poor-houses, such as exist in Sitapur and Lucknow, nor charitable endowments.\nStatement showing where the

The most remote concern themselves, not, as is usual, with the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana cycle, but with that of the Mah\u00e1bharata. BalaR\u00e1ma, the brother of Krishna, in one of his visits to the shrine of N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, in Sitapur, received complaints from the Brahmans against Bil of Bilgr\u00e1m, a local giant or chieftain who used to throw dirt at the worshippers at N\u00edmkh\u00e1r. The details are given under Bilgr\u00e1m, and it need only be remarked here that a distinct conflict of several faiths is referred to. BalaR\u00e1ma came to N\u00edmkh\u00e1r with the Brahmans; then he found the Rishis, the holy men of the aboriginal faith; he struck off the head of one who would not rise to pay him respect with a blade of kusa grass; the Brahmans disapproved the action as unseemly, but evidently regarded it as a very menial offence compared with slaying a Brahman. Bil, or his son Ill\u00e1l, seems, however, to have been a very profane wretch who cared for no rites of any kind, so BalaR\u00e1ma slew him with a ploughshare. Bilgr\u00e1m, at any rate, was an ancient aboriginal town situated on a bluff over the Ganges which then flowed beneath it.*\n\nThe next facts concerning Hardoi history are connected with the Musalman colonization. B\u00e1wan was occupied by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r in 1028. The Shekhs declare that they conquered Bilgr\u00e1m in 1013, but the permanent Moslem occupation did not commence till 1217 A.D. Gopamau was occupied somewhere about the time of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r; indeed it was the earliest conquest in Oudh effected by that prince. One of his captains, Sayyad Makhd\u00fam Az\u00edz-ud-d\u00edn, Shekh, commonly known as L\u00e1l P\u00edr, was despatched across the Ganges from Kanauj; he was slain at Gopamau, and was of course canonized; but Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r left two new candidates for martyrdom in that town, Nusrat Khan and J\u00e1far Khan, who survived, and whose descendants are still extant. The settlement of Pali by a P\u00e1nde Brahman, a Ris\u00e1l-d\u00e1r, and a Shekh, all of whom are represented at this day by men of property in the neighbourhood, is a curious instance of the stability of oriental families. Isauli, in Bangar, was also conquered by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, in 1030 A.D., and the tomb of a martyr there killed is still to be seen. S\u00e1ndi and Sandfla were not occupied by the Moslems till long after the events above referred to. The latter was the capital of a P\u00e1s\u00ed kingdom which seems to have spread over the country down both banks of the Gumti and the Sai, extending from its original seat at Dhaurahra and Mitauli. The P\u00e1s\u00eds, it may be remarked, are still very powerful in Hardoi. The histories of the Musalman colonization, when properly studied, may be expected to throw more light upon the aboriginal inhabitants; at present all is very dim and dubious; there is little to be\n\n* See article Bilgr\u00e1m.\ngathered from their descendants, and, except the mere names of P\u00e1si and Thathera, there is no link apparent between the mand the races of the present day.\n\nModern.\u2014It were easy to write an elaborate chronicle of events which have happened on the soil of Hardoi, of armies which have passed over it, of kings who have fled through it, of great battles fought within its borders, but such chronicles would not constitute the history of Hardoi. Owing to its geographical situation, on the eastern side of the Ganges, and covering the fords near the great city of Kanauj, over which lay the road from Delhi and K\u00e1b\u00fal to Jaunpur, Patna, and Bengal, many great armies of the eastern and western empires were at different times marshalled against each other in Hardoi. There the Sharqi kings of Jaunpur mustered their forces and bid defiance to the Lodi lords of Delhi; here again the Khilji for a brief space rallied his forces against the Mughals and placed the seat of his empire at Bilgr\u00e1m; between Bilgr\u00e1m and S\u00e1ndi again was fought the great battle between Hum\u00e1y\u00fan and Sher Sh\u00e1h, which drove the Mughals from India. In after times again, Hardoi was the border land between the Waz\u00edr of Oudh and the Rohilla Afgh\u00e1ns. Here the gallant Newal R\u00e1e perished, and Ahmad Khan Bangash forced his way into Oudh. It was this constant passage of successive armies which rendered the formation of any organized government in Hardoi impossible till after the accession of Akbar.\n\nThe whole of north Hardoi was a jungle in his time. In this forest Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, which means the place of concealment, was founded by Sadr Jah\u00e1n. Prior to this Bilgr\u00e1m had been founded in the reign of Altamsh (1217 A.D.) by Shekh Muhammad Faqih. Sandila had been conquered from the P\u00e1s\u00eds in the reign of All\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, but till Akbar\u2019s reign these settlements had been mere outposts\u2014military garrisons. With the Mughals, as I have elsewhere pointed out, cannon came into general use, and the fords of the Ganges lost their strategical importance because the crossing of troops could always be protected by the new engine of warfare. Hardoi then ceased to be the natural meeting place of east and west India, the jungles were cleared, new colonies were founded at Gopamau in the reign of Akbar, at Shahabad and at S\u00e1ndi in the reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n. It is not clear what were the precise relations of these Musalman lords to their Hindu neighbours. Those of Bilgr\u00e1m pretend to have had authority over parganas B\u00e1wan, S\u00e1ndi, and Hardoi, yet we find that they purchased the few villages which constitute their present estate one by one at different times extending over a long period; in fact their estate is not the conquest of an invader, but the slow accumulation of thrift and diplomacy exercised upon more simple and rustic neighbours. Similarly the Sandila Musalmans are not even mentioned by Sleeman as landlords, and the major part of their property was acquired at a very recent date. The country was probably thinly peopled by Hindus, mostly covered with jungles, dotted here and there by the red brick forts of the Musalmans in military occupation. The annals of Bilgr\u00e1m are epitomized as follows. An account of the various battles of Bilgr\u00e1m, including the last great fight which took place on Hardoi soil, may also fitly be given here.\nFrom the Junaidia and Shajra-e-Saihab (family histories of the Bilgr\u00e1m Sayyads) I learn that in the same year (1217 A.D.) Sayyad Muhammad, fourth in descent from Abdul Fazl, a Sayyad* of W\u00e1sit in Ir\u00e1q, whom political troubles had forced to leave his country and to flee into Hindustan, marched to Bilgr\u00e1m with a large force of Firshauri Shekhs, drove out the Hindus (Sri R\u00e1m and the Raikw\u00e1rs), and settled there. The services of the Sayyads were rewarded with a rent-free grant of one-tenth of the tract afterwards known as pargana Bilgr\u00e1m. For three hundred years, or till the accession of B\u00e1bar (1526 A.D.), this grant is said to have been upheld. Then B\u00e1bar, to punish the Sayyads for their opposition, here as elsewhere, to his conquest of India, resumed their grant, but conferred on Sayyad Bh\u00edkhbh\u00edr\u00e1n the chaudhriship of the tract. It may, I think, be inferred that the special cause of the resumption of the j\u00e1g\u00edr of the Bilgr\u00e1m Sayyads was their complicity in the rebellion of the eastern Afgh\u00e1n chiefs of Jaunpur and Oudh during the last two years of the reign of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi. \"At this time (just after the battle of Panipet) the North of India still retained much of its original Hindu organization; its system of village and district administration and government, its division into numerous little chieftainships or petty local governments, and in political revolutions the people looked much more to their own immediate rulers than to the prince who governed in the capital. Except at Delhi and Agra the inhabitants everywhere fortified their towns and prepared to resist. The invasion was regarded as a temporary inundation that would speedily pass off. Every man in authority raised troops and put himself in a condition to act. Those who held delegated authority or j\u00e1g\u00edrs, being generally Afgh\u00e1ns, were consequently hostile to the new state of things. They soon came to an understanding among themselves and took measures for mutual co-operation.\" (Erskine, India under B\u00e1bar and Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, I., 442.)\n\n\"In the eastern provinces of Jaunpur and Oudh the opposition (to B\u00e1bar's progress) presented even a more regular form. There the confederacy of Afgh\u00e1n chiefs who had been in open rebellion against Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm (Lodi) for two years before his death still continued. The insurgents now possessed (in 1526) not only Behar but nearly the whole territories of the old Sharqi monarchy, especially the country on the left bank of the Ganges; and had even crossed to the right bank of the river and taken possession of Kanauj, and advanced into the Du\u00e1b.\n\n\"It was clear that the Afgh\u00e1n chiefs who till now had ruled with nearly unlimited authority both in Delhi and Behar must be ruined if B\u00e1bar settled in Hindustan. But it was no sooner known that his invasion was not to be a temporary inroad like those of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni and the great Taim\u00far, but that he was to remain in the country and to govern it on the spot, than new fears and new hopes began to operate both on the natives and the Afgh\u00e1ns. His affairs began to brighten; he was acknowledged by the Afgh\u00e1n army of Sult\u00e1n Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm (Lodi), which under Shekh Bay\u00e1z\u00edd Farmuli and F\u00edroz Khan had been successfully employed\n\n* \"From him are descended the most renowned Musulman families in Northern India, the Barhall and Bilgrami Syeds, and in Khyrabad, Futtehpore, Haswa, and many other places branches of the same stem are found.\" (Chronicles of Oonso, page 93.)\nagainst Sultan Muhammad Shah, of Behar and the revolted chiefs of the east. Both Bayazid Farmuli and Firoz Khan now submitted to Babar, who bestowed on them and the leading officers of their army large assignments, chiefly in Jaunpur and Oudh, out of the revenue of the territories that were still in the hands of the insurgents to whom they were opposed.\"\n\nIn 1527 A.D. the country beyond the Ganges being still disturbed by the Afghan chief Baban who had occupied Lucknow and forced Sultan Muhammad, Babar's governor to abandon Kanauj, Babar \"bestowed the government of these countries on Muhammad Sultan Mirza, a grandson of the great Sultan Husen Mirza of Khorasan and one of the Emperor's favourite officers, and sent him with a strong army to recover the lost territory. Baban no sooner heard that Muhammad Sultan had crossed the Ganges than be deserted Lucknow and retired once more into the upper country\" (477).\n\nThe Sharif Usmani mentions a farman of Babar of this date, addressed to this Muhammad Sultan, upholding a previous grant of mauza Auhadpur to the Sheikh Qazi of Bilgram, Abdul Daim.\n\nIn 1528 A.D. Muhammad Sultan having been attacked and defeated by the Afghan insurgents \"was forced to abandon Lucknow, to recross the Ganges, and fall back on Kanauj\" (482), and at last to evacuate Kanauj and retire on Raberi. The revolt had been strengthened by the accession of Shekh Bayazid with his whole army. At Babar's approach the Afghans abandoned Kanauj \"and retreating across the Ganges took up a position on its left bank opposite to that city, determined to dispute the passage of the river.\"\n\nThey must have crossed close to Bilgram. Babar bridged the Ganges lower down at Namanau Gh\u00e1t near Bangarmau, re-occupied Lucknow, and pursued and routed the Afghans near Ajodhya.\n\nIn 1534 A.D., in the reign of Humayun, Muhammad Sultan Mirza rebelled and raised an army of six thousand Afghans and Rajputs at Kanauj. In two years he had made himself master of the country from Kanauj to Jaunpur, and caused the khutba to be read in his own name. \"He fixed the seat of his Government at Bilgram, opposite to Kanauj, and had gained sufficient strength to send his son Ulugh Mirza with a large force to besiege Jaunpur, while Shah Mirza, another of his sons, reduced Karra-Manikpur. Kanauj too had fallen into his hands.\" (Erskine, II., 89.) The Emperor's brother, Hindal Mirza, headed a successful campaign against the insurgents and defeated them in the neighbourhood of Bilgram. \"Hindal Mirza, whom the Emperor had left in command at Agra, marched to quell this revolt, and soon retook Kanauj. As soon as Muhammad Sultan Mirza heard of his approach, he called in all his detachments and was joined by Shah Mirza, while Ulugh Mirza, wrote to say that he would hasten with all possible speed to meet him; at the same time urging him not to hazard a battle till his arrival. Muhammad Sultan Mirza and Shah Mirza encamping on the left (the Bilgram) bank of the river, used every exertion to obstruct the passage of the imperial army. Hindal, however, eager to engage the enemy before Ulugh\nMirza could join them, having discovered a ford ten miles above Kanauj left his camp standing and effected a passage unobserved with all his troops. The two armies soon met face to face, but when they were on the point of engaging, a strong nor-wester rising blew such clouds of dust right in the eyes of the insurgents that they could not keep their position. The imperial troops who had the wind on their backs availing themselves of their advantage, pressed hard upon the enemy, whose retreat was soon converted into a flight. Hindal, after taking possession of Bilgram and the surrounding country, pursued the remainder of their army as they marched to form a junction with Ulugh Mirza. He overtook them at Aud.\u201d (Erskine, II., page 90.) Here, two months later, another action was fought in which the rebels were finally dispersed; this was in 1537 A.D.\n\nBut the country from Jaunpur to Kanauj was still in a very unsettled state. \u201cAll the materials of revolt and resistance were amply scattered over the eastern provinces. They had for many years been the theatre of war, the minds of the inhabitants were unsettled, had become familiarized to change, and were almost strangers to regular government. Though the old Sharqi and the more recent Lohani dynasty had disappeared, and though the attempts of Mahmud Lodi and of Muhammad Sultan Mirza to revive the kingdom had failed, Sher Khan Sur, a new candidate for distinction and power, had started up, was extending and consolidating his influence in Behar, and on the side of Bengal; and by his valour in the field and the equity of his financial administration was gaining the admiration and the affection of his subjects. The Afghans in every part of India began to turn their eyes to him as the leader who at some future time might be destined to restore to them that proud ascendancy of their nation, the loss of which every man of them so deeply deplored.\u201d (Erskine, II. 109.)\n\nBefore marching against Sher Khan, Humayun entrusted Kanauj and the adjoining country to Nur-ud-din Muhammad Mirza, who had married the Emperor\u2019s sister. During Humayun\u2019s absence in Bengal (1538) this officer joined prince Hindal in his rebellion at Agra. Meanwhile Sher Khan had possessed himself of Behar and the country from thence to Kanauj. In 1539 the disaster of Chausar occurred. Sher Khan recovered Bengal. \u201cHe crossed the Ganges to renew the siege of Jaunpur, which, with the whole territory dependent on it, surrendered with little resistance. In like manner he overran the rest of the country east of the Ganges as far as Kanauj.\u201d (Erskine, II., 176.) \u201cIn 1540 Humayun once more marched against Sher Shah, who by this time had recrossed the Ganges lying opposite Kanauj.\u201d\n\nMore detailed accounts of the battles which then took place, and of that which preceded it almost on the same spot, have been extracted from the native chronicles, Erskine\u2019s Baber and other sources. The author of the life of Humayun writes as follows:\n\n\u201cI must now revert to the insurrection which took place during his majesty\u2019s expedition to Gujerat. Muhammed Zeman Sultan (a descendant of Timur, and favourite of the late Emperor), taking advantage of his\nmajesty's absence, gained possession of the countries situated on the north-east side of the Ganges, and fixed his own residence at Belgram, but despatched his son Aleg Myrza with a considerable force to seize on the provinces of Joanpur, Kurra, and Manikpur. As soon as this intelligence reached the prince Hindal, the king's youngest brother and representative at Agra, he collected an army and marched to Canouge; in consequence of this event Sultan Muhammed recalled his divisions and encamped with all his force on the northern bank of the Ganges to oppose the royal troops; in this situation the contending armies remained for some time. At length the emissaries of Hindal discovered a ford about ten miles above Canouge. The prince immediately took advantage of this circumstance, and having ordered that his camp should remain standing, marched quietly in the night, and without being perceived by the rebels crossed the river with all his troops.\n\n\"As soon as the day broke the two armies drew up in order of battle; but just as the engagement was about to commence a very violent storm from the north-west arose, and raised such a dust that the sky was obscured, and blew with so much force in the faces of the rebels that they could not distinguish friend from foe, in consequence of which they took to flight, and proceeded towards Joanpur. The prince Hindal having thus gained possession of the district of Belgram followed the enemy, and again came up with them in the vicinity of Oudh; but as the forces of the two armies were now nearly equal, a considerable time was lost in skirmishing, and endeavouring to gain the advantage of each other. At length Muhammed Sultan, having received information that the king had returned in health and safety to his capital, was afraid to contend any longer, and fled with all his family towards Couch Behar, which adjoins the territory of Bengal. The prince Hindal then proceeded to Joapnur and took possession of that district.\" (Pages 7-8 of Memoirs of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan.)\n\n\"The following day the king,* attended by the whole army, left the city and encamped on the plains of Allypur; he then reviewed and mustered the troops, the number of which amounted to 90,000 cavalry, but as some of them were not properly equipped his majesty ordered them to be well supplied from the arsenal. He also conferred honorary dresses and other marks of distinction on all the principal officers, and omitted nothing to rouse the spirits and encourage the soldiers for the ensuing campaign. After a few days' march the army reached Canouge, which is situated on the western bank of the Ganges, and here learned that Shyr Khan was encamped on the other side of the river; at this time an express arrived from Raja Perb\u00e9han of Aroul offering to join him with troops, provided the king would meet him at Pute. His majesty, however, would not agree to this measure, but gave orders for the army to cross the river at Canouge.\" (Pages 20-21 of Memoirs of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan.)\n\nThe battle of Bilgr\u00e1m.\u2014Hum\u00e1y\u00fan had raised an enormous army consisting of 100,000 men, with nearly 800 guns, including swivels. He moved down to Mehnd\u00edgh\u00e1t near Kanauj; Sher Shah encamping opposite;\n\n* Hum\u00e1y\u00fan.\nhere Muhammad Mirza and Ulugh Mirza, who had been received into favour again by Humayun, deserted. Whether the scene of their former defeat embittered rankling memories, or whether they thought that their opium-eating monarch had no chance against Sher Shah, we know not, but their ingratitude was black and fatal to the Mughal cause. On the other hand the chivalrous Raja of Arol, Partab Singh,* wrote offering to join the Emperor with all his forces. Desertions occurred daily, and merely to stop them the Mughal force crossed the river and encamped with the Ganges, at its rear\u2014a fatal tactical error. The battle which occurred is one of the most remarkable in the history of the world, and has yet its lessons for Indian strategists.\n\nIt is perfectly clear that fourteen years in the Indian plains and unlimited indulgence in all the luxuries of the prostrate land had enervated the Mughal troops to a degree such as we can now hardly conceive.\n\nThere happened to be in the line a celebrated Chaghatai chief, Haidar Mirza Doghlat, a distant relative of Humayun, who had recently come down from the hills of Farghana, had become Humayun's brother after the fashion of the nation, accompanied him in the campaign, and now witnessed with astonishment and disgust the effeminate and cowardly behaviour of his former companions in arms, the amirs who twelve years before had hurled back 50,000 of the bravest Chhattris of Rajputana by their steady and disciplined valour; and 120 of whom had put to flight a whole army of those very Pathans before whom they were trembling. Facts, which are only credible because they are confirmed by the concurrent testimony of several eye-witnesses, compel us to believe that the whole nature of the hardy Tartars had changed.\n\nShortly before the battle of Chaunsa Humayun found himself beset by the Pathans. He actually appealed to his principal general, his cousin Askari Mirza, and promised to grant him any four boons he would ask, provided he would extricate him from his difficulties by marching against the enemy. Askari Mirza summoned his officers and consulted them what he should ask for, saying his own affections were fixed, first on money, second on the muslins and silks of Dacca, thirdly on handsome girls, fourthly on eunuchs; his officers replied that the times were too risky for eunuchs and women, but that they would fight their bravest if the Emperor would raise each man a step in rank and give them a large sum of money in cash.\n\nImagine the brigade generals on the eve of a battle being invited by the commander-in-chief to state on what terms they would consent not to run away; and answering that they loved women, but that gold and promotion were more preferable, because more portable on the march, and that he must pay down cash, as mere promises were useless. Most of these mercenary and profligate chiefs had perished on the field of Chaunsa. Yet the same spirit survived.\n\nIn Samarqand Babar had maintained the sternest discipline, he had shot down soldiers who dared to pillage, he had caused to be restored every single article which had been plundered from a caravan passing\n\n* Jauher's mumayun 21 See page 63.\nnear his camp*. In a few short years the bravest and best disciplined army of the age had become a mob of cowardly and enervated debauchees. Not even the fearful lesson taught at Chaunsa had any effect. Haidar Mirza, one of themselves, shall describe his brethren:\u2014\"In the rest of the army were amirs only in name who enjoyed Government and rich jagirs without the slightest tincture of prudence, or knowledge, or energy, or emulation, or nobleness of mind, or generosity, qualities from which nobility draws its name. On the day of battle they were all mounted on cuirassed horses and clothed in mail; between me and the extreme left of the centre stood seven and twenty amirs, all having the horse-tail banner. On the day of battle, when Sher Khan marched out with his army in columns, of the seven and twenty horse-tail standards that were with these great lords, there was not one that was not hid, lest the enemy might see and bear down upon it. The soldiership and bravery of the amirs may be estimated from this trait of their courage. I reckoned Sher Khan's force at less than fifteen thousand, while I estimated the Chaghatai army at forty thousand heavy cavalry. When Sher Khan's army quitted their trenches two of the columns drew up before the ditch, the other three advanced towards the army. On our side the centre was in motion to take the ground I had marked out for it, but we were unable to reach it. In the Chaghatai army every man, amir, wazir, rich, and poor, has his camp followers (ghul\u00e1ms), so that an amir of any note, if he has a hundred retainers, will for himself and them have perhaps five hundred camp followers, who in the day of battle do not attend their master, and are not masters of themselves, so that they wander at large; and as when they have lost their master's control they are under no other, however much they may be beaten, back, or face, or head, with mace or stick, they are totally unmanageable. In a word, by the pressure of the masses of these men the troops were quite unable to keep their ranks; the camp followers crowding behind, bore them so down that they were thrown into disorder and the crowd continuing still to press on, some on one side, some on another, pushed the soldiers upon the chains of carriages. Even then the camp followers who were behind went on urging those before till in many instances the chains burst and every person who was stationed at the chain so broken, driven out beyond it, while the order, even of such as kept within, was totally broken and destroyed, and from the pressure and confusion not a man could act.\n\n\"Such was the state of the centre, nor were matters more prosperous on the right. As Sher Khan's three columns approached, a cry of defeat was heard, and that instant a panic seized the men; and before an arrow was shot from a bow they fled like chaff before the wind. The fugitives ran towards the centre. Here they found all in disorder. The camp followers having pushed clear through the line, had disordered everything, and separated the Mir from the men, and the men from the Mir. But when to this confusion the rush of the terrified men flying from the right was added, the defeat was sure, and the day irretrievable. The Chaghatai army, which counted forty thousand men in armour, besides camp followers and artisans, \u2020 fled before ten thousand. It was not a fight, but a rout,\n\n* Erskine's Babar, I., 186.\n\u2020 Sh\u00e1girdneaha.\nfor not a man, friend or foe, was even wounded. Sher Khan gained a great victory; the Chaghatais suffered a ruinous defeat. Not a cannon was fired, not a gun: the artillery was totally useless.\n\n\"When the Chaghatais took to flight the distance from the field of battle to the banks of the river might be about a farsang. Before a man was wounded, the whole army, amirs, bah\u00e1durs, and common men, fled, broken and dismayed, to the banks of the Ganges. The enemy's army followed and overtook them. The Chaghatais not having time to take off their horse armour, or their own cuirasses, plunged, accoutred as they were, into the stream. Its breadth might be about five bow shots. Many amirs of illustrious name perished, and all from want of concert and control. Every one went, or came at his own will. When we emerged from the river on the other bank, a monarch, who at noon had seventeen thousand artisans in his establishments, was mounted upon a wretched spavined horse, with both his head and feet bare. Permanence belongs to God alone, the King of Kings. The author had nearly a thousand persons, retainers and servants, of whom only sixty escaped out of the river, all the rest were drowned. From this instance the general loss may be estimated. When he reached the Ganges he found an old elephant and mounted into the hauda, where he found a eunuch of his household named K\u00e1fur. He ordered the driver to cross the river, but the man told him that the animal was quite unequal to it, and would be drowned. K\u00e1fur hinted to the Emperor that the man wished to carry over the elephant to the Afgh\u00e1ns, and that it was better to put him to death; that he would undertake to guide the animal. On this Hum\u00e1y\u00fan drew his sword and struck the driver, who fell wounded into the water. The eunuch then stepped down on the elephant's neck and directed him across. As they gained the banks, which were very steep, the Emperor found it difficult to mount them, when a soldier who had just gained the shore, presenting his hand to the Emperor, drew him up. Hum\u00e1y\u00fan asked his deliverer's name, and was answered Shams-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad of Ghazni, in the service of Mirza K\u00e1mr\u00e1n. The Emperor made him high promises. At this moment he was recognized by Makhd\u00edm Beg, one of the K\u00e1mr\u00e1n's nobles, who came forward and presented his own horse. Shams-ud-d\u00edn afterwards became one of the most distinguished noblemen of the empire, was made Khan Azam, and was the atkeh or foster-father of Akbar, in those days a connection of no small importance.\"\n\nA more extraordinary battle never was fought. The mass of the Mughals had nothing to expect but victory or death; the Ganges\u2014deep, rapid, and swarming with crocodiles, also now swollen by the melting snows\u2014lay behind them. No quarter was to be expected from their treacherous foes, no flight was possible through a hostile country. The men who lost Chaunsa were rash and vain-glorious, but those who lost Bilgr\u00e1m were such cowards and fools as the world has seldom seen. Men wearing heavy cuirasses expected to swim the Ganges in the end of May, to escape on foot from the Path\u00e1n cavalry, or to meet with mercy from Sher Shah. They had deserted from the line before the battle, not to join the enemy, for even policy could not overcome Sher Shah's hatred of the Turks, but simply to look after their estates, and hide them from the storm of wars.\nWhere was the fierce courage of the Turks which was now and for a century afterwards to make the Kings of Europe and the Kaisar himself tremble for their capitals? Had it vanished with the snows on which it grew, or with the poverty which spurred it to conquest? Humayun declared that the dissensions of his brothers caused his defeat, but three brothers fought or rather fled side by side from the sand hills of Bilgram. The native historian declared that women and gold were what wrecked the Mughals, but plenty of both has always in India been the lot of powers and success with the sword. Sher Shah must have had a very tolerable harem if under its name he could introduce 1,200 palanquins, each credited with a fair passenger, into the fort of Rhotas. I trace the cause of the great Mughal disaster at Bilgram to the fact that poor and uncultivated men were brought down from their native hills, were placed in a hot country with a most relaxing climate, in a position of great wealth and perfect leisure, and their valour oozed out beneath the weight of profligacy, avarice, gluttony, and sleep, which make the lives of wealthy Indians.\n\nModern Hindu History.\u2014The history of the later Hindu inhabitants is of no interest; other districts have sometimes during the many centuries produced individuals like Tilok Chand, Lone Singh of Mitauli, Jodh Singh of Dhaurahra, Partab Singh of Partabgarh, Balbhadar Singh of Tiloii, who really left their marks on the annals of the district. Hardoi cannot boast of one great name. The Ahbans, really Chawar Chhattris, occupied Gopamau about 100 A.D., if we are to believe themselves, and never did anything worthy of mention up to date. The Sombansis came from Kumhrawan to Sandi about 1400 A.D. Their chief, Raja Santan, was compelled to yield to the Musalmans; he retained Santan Khera, now Sandi, for some time, and then abandoned it for Siwajipur, where his descendant still resides. The Gaurs allege that they were settled by Jai Chand of Kanauj about 1180 A.D., having come from Shiurajpur. The Nikumbhas came, they say, from Alwar about 1450 A.D., the Katiars from Farukhabad about 1550 A.D., the Bais of Gundwa from Baiswara, but the head of this family, Randhir Singh of Bharawan, represents that he is descended from Tilok Chand, thirty-one generations removed, and that the title of raja was conferred on his ancestor by the Emperor for bravery in the field. Now all the Baiswara descendants of Tilok Chand only recede eighteen generations from him to the present line, and the true origin of the Bharawan raja is related under Malihabad. The descent from Tilok Chand is then probably as fabulous as the details are incorrect. None of the above families have any history worth relating, a few facts are given about each under the pargana headings. Another account represents the Nikumbhas as being a Kachhwaha or Surajbans clan which left Aral or Arwal in Jaipur, and alternately served the Junwar Raja of Delhi and the Rathor of Kanauj in the neighbourhood of Farukhabad. They received the name of Nikumbh\u2014\"nekkam\"\u2014from Raja Santan, whom they had by some means got released from imprisonment at the court of his sovereign, Jai Chand of Kanauj. This derivation seems apocryphal, another is that the word means low caste or illegitimate. At any rate four brothers got different grants, one near Sonara, pargana Sandila, another near Sandi, a third got one in Alamnagar, the fourth\nsettled in Farukhabad P\u00edparg\u00e1on. The colony in S\u00e1ndi afterwards emigrated to \u0160and\u00edla; they have now 119 villages.\n\nThe Gaurs, who are the most powerful clan in the district and occupy its centre, drove out the Thathers from B\u00e1wan and Sara, it is alleged, during the time of the Kanauj sovereignty. This was probably a seat of aboriginal power, for it was attacked by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00edr A.D. 1024, and many ancient sites and large wells attest its former greatness. Further, there is in B\u00e1wan a S\u00farajkund or tank sacred to the Sun; formerly many thousands of people used annually to assemble here to worship, but within the last twenty years this cult has given place to modern Brahmanism, and the spot is now almost deserted. The tradition, as related at length in the Sara and B\u00e1wan articles, states that two young sons of the Gaur Kuber S\u00e1h of Gurganjari were buried alive by the barbarian Thather chieftain. They were dug up by their father while still breathing; one who had lost an eye was called K\u00e1na, and survived to be the ancestor of the K\u00e1ne Gaurs; from the other sprang the \u00c1ne. These two branches have now 104 villages, while two other Gaur clans, the Chaubes and Chaudhris, hold 50 and 24 respectively.\n\nIn nearly all cases, that, for instance, of the Ahbans, sprung from Gopi* and Sopi, the Gaurs and Nikumbhs as just related, we find the tribe claiming a descent from two or more brother immigrants from the west. The same story is told of the Raikwars of Sailuk (see Bara Banki), of the Janw\u00e1s of Kheri, of the J\u00e1ngres (see Kamp Dhaurahra), of the Sombansi of Partabgarh. In every case a rather monotonous tale is told. The high caste Chhattirs from the west wandered on seeking employment. Two brothers were entertained by the Bhar or Thather sovereign. In a few years a quarrel arose, the barbarous chieftain either buried the children of the too powerful subject, or endeavoured to get him killed, or wanted to marry his daughter; in some way he justified reprisals and was killed. Now, before rejecting these traditions as false we must remember that the supersession of a master by a servant is the common course of all Oriental Governments. Such changes frequently occurred; at any given period the reigning line had probably ousted one to which it was in subjection a generation or two back. When the Aryan or Hindu system was introduced a Chhattr\u00ed origin was found for the then governing house, the precedent dynasty was left in barbarism, but the change of rulers was represented as a conquest by a branch of the Aryan race over mlechas or barbarians whom the retrospective caste founders did not care to ennoble. Noble pedigrees in fact were found for the rich and powerful, just as in another hemisphere; but here they were endowed with the still higher distinction of having acted as pioneers and champions of civilization and Hinduism, and the caitiff who stabbed his master became a defender of the faith.\n\n*Turbulence of the district.\u2014Hardoi was the most violent and turbulent of all the districts of Oudh; it was divided into the chaklas of Sand\u00edla, S\u00e1ndi, P\u00e1li, and Tandiaon; the last in particular included the famous Bangar\u2014the wild district east of and along the Sai\u2014in which the P\u00e1s\u00eds, the ancestral\n\n* See article Kheri.\nlords of the soil, had taken refuge and maintained a guerilla warfare with all authority, Hindu or Moslem. Ahrori, in Gopamau, was their main residence. A number of their Chhatari neighbours, like the English lords of the Pale in Ireland, took part with them.\n\nThe following were the most celebrated n\u00e1zims and chakladars who ruled any part of the district during the Nawabi:\n\n| Pasli. |\n|--------|\n| N\u00far Ali Khan | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1185 |\n| Ambar Ali Khan | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1191 |\n| R\u00e1ja Sital Parsh\u00e1d, a brave but ferocious soldier | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1192\u20141193 |\n| Fateh Ali Khan | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1199 |\n| Ghul\u00e1m Muhammed Khan | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1200 |\n| Mehndi Ali Khan | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1210\u20141227 |\n| R\u00e1ja Gubardhan D\u00e1s K\u00e1yath ancestor of R\u00e1j Fateh Chand and Dhanpat R\u00e1e, Taluqdars | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1228\u20141229 |\n| Shekh Im\u00e1m Bakhsh | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1230\u20141233 |\n| Am\u00edrt L\u00e1l F\u00e1thak | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1234\u20141236 |\n\nBut in 1230\u20141235 Bakht Mal, a Kashm\u00edri Brahman, was chakladar of Tandiaon. He was succeeded by Dila R\u00e1m from 1235\u20141251, save that Abdulla Beg held 1240-1241, and Far\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn Ahmad 1248-1249. From 1251 to 1254 Tahawwar Khan and Husen Ali Khan were chakladars; then Shiu N\u00e1th, son of Dila R\u00e1m, succeeded, and with Kid\u00e1r N\u00e1th as his n\u00e1ib held till annexation in 1263 Pasli (1856).\n\nIn Sandila the consecutive chakladars were Chaudhri Hashmat Ali ... ... ... ... 1249 Pasli,\nMurli Dhar ... ... ... ... 1262 \",\nNaqi Ali Khan, Nawab, with Kunwar R\u00e1j Bah\u00e1dur, n\u00e1ib in charge of division of the district ... ... 1255 \",\nKhw\u00e1ja Husen Bakhsh ... ... ... ... 1259 \",\nChaudhri Hashmat Ali again ... ... ... ... 1260 \"to annexation.\n\nThese four chakladars changed in fourteen years, but the most commended administration was, it is alleged, that of Naqi Ali Khan, whose n\u00e1ib was a warlike K\u00e1yath who gained success by storming the forts of Jarawa and Ruia in fierce battles.\n\nColonel Sleeman writes as follows, referring to Tandiaon:\n\n\"January 22nd, 1849.\u2014Tundeeawun eight miles west. The country level, and something between doomutee and muteear, very good, and in parts well cultivated, particularly in the vicinity of villages; but a large portion of the surface is covered with jungle, useful only to robbers and refractory landholders, who abound in the purgunnah of Bangur. In this respect it is reputed one of the worst districts in Oude. Within the last few years the king's troops have been frequently beaten and driven out with loss, even when commanded by a European officer. The landholders and armed peasantry of the different villages unite their quotas of auxiliaries, and concentrate upon them on a concerted signal, when they are in pursuit of robbers and rebels. Almost every able-bodied man of every village in Bangur is trained to the use of arms of one kind or another, and none of the king's troops, save those who are disciplined and commanded by European officers, will venture to move against a landholder of this district; and when the local authorities cannot obtain the\naid of such troops, they are obliged to conciliate the most powerful and unscrupulous by reductions in the assessment of the lands or additions to their nankar.\u201d\u2014Vol. II., pages 14-15.\n\nAnother incident of life among the Hardoi Chhattris may be also given from the same author:\n\n\u201cI omitted to mention that at Busora, on the 27th, a Rajpoot landholder of the Sombunsie tribe came to my camp with a petition regarding a mortgage, and mentioned that he had a daughter, now two years of age; that when she was born he was out in his fields, and the females of the family put her into an earthen pot, buried her in the floor of the apartment, where the mother lay, and lit a fire over the grave; that he made all haste home as soon as he heard of the birth of a daughter, removed the fire and earth from the pot, and took out his child. She was still living, but two of her fingers, which had not been sufficiently covered, were a good deal burnt. He had all possible care taken of her, and she still lives; and both he and his wife are very fond of her. Finding that his tale interested me, he went home for the child, but his village was far off, and he has not been able to overtake me. He had given no orders to have her preserved, as his wife was confined sooner than he expected; but the family took it for granted that she was to be destroyed, and in running home to preserve her he acted on the impulse of the moment. The practice of destroying female infants is so general among this tribe, that a family commonly destroys the daughter as soon as born, when the father is from home, and has given no special orders about it, taking it to be his wish as a matter of course.\u201d\u2014Vol. II., pages 59-60.\n\nHARDOI.\u2014Pargana BANGAR\u2014Tahsil HARDOI\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Hardoi, the headquarters of the Hardoi district, lies on the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, sixty-three miles from Lucknow and thirty-nine from Shahjahanpur. It is thirty-six miles east from Farukhabad and thirty-seven west-south-west from Sitapur. After the re-occupation it was selected, apparently for no other consideration than the centrality of its position, as the sadr station of the district. It has a population of 7,156, of whom 2,027 are cultivating and 4,290 non-cultivating Hindus, and 839 are Muhammadans. Chamars, Chamar Gaurs, and Gaurs preponderate among the Hindus.\n\nUnlike the other towns of the district, there is very little of ancient or modern interest about the place. Tradition traces the name to Hardeo Baba, a devotee reputed to have lived here more than a thousand years ago. An ancient tree is pointed out as marking the spot where he lived, and in October and March a small mela is held at it in his honour. Another tale derives it from a Thathera chieftain named Raja Harnakas. The fact that the debris of a Thathera fort are still to be seen, in the shape of a high irregular khera covering about 16 acres, to the south-west of the present town, where the road from Sandi enters it, lends probability to the latter derivation. The town, itself is largely built of bricks dug out of the old Thathera remains, and traces of their occupation are continually cropping up here as elsewhere throughout this interesting district.\n\n* By Mr. A. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe present town appears to have been founded some seven hundred years or more ago by a body of Chamar Gaurs from N\u00e1rkanjari, near Indore, who, under their leader S\u00e1le Singh, drove out the Thatheras, destroyed their fortress, and, as usual, settled themselves down close to its ruins.\n\nThe place had no local importance before it was made a civil station. Now there are the usual civil buildings, cutcherry, police station, jail, school, dispensary, and sessions-house, as well as the subdivisional office of the tahsildar. The school is an Anglo-vernacular one averaging 109 pupils. There is a branch school with 44 boys. A bi-weekly market is held on Sundays and Wednesdays in Hardeoganj.\n\nThere are 19 masonry and 1,294 mud houses in the town. The climate is healthy, and seems to be specially adapted to the production of fine fruit. Peaches, mangoes, grapes, and oranges are exceptionally good.\n\nThere is the usual municipal committee, and its income is raised by an octroi.\n\nThe railway journey from Lucknow is four hours, and from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur two hours and a quarter.\n\n**HARDOI Pargana\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELI.**\u2014This little pargana is bounded on the west by Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n, and on the south by Rae Bareli. The little river Naiya flows to the north of it, and proceeds eastward to pargana Simrauta; it is not used for irrigation. The area is 15,561 acres, the land tax Rs. 39,965, being at the rate of Rs. 2-9 per acre. The soil is very fertile, and the rent in consequence high. In one township\u2014Asni, celebrated for tobacco\u2014the rents reach Rs. 48 per acre. The country is level, and its fertility is taken advantage of by the Kurmis, who form the chief cultivating caste. Water is met with at a depth of 30 feet, the soil is a fine loam, and the very best crops are raised. Saltpetre and salt were formerly manufactured in eight villages, but this has been stopped since annexation.\n\nThe population is 15,706, which is at the rate of 640 to the square mile. They reside in 23 villages, two having been transferred to Rae Bareli. Of these 15 are taluqdari, and the rest belong to village communities.\n\nThere are two small markets, one at Belanganj, in Atehra, the second Ph\u00falganj, in P\u00e1ra Khurd. About 15,000 maunds of wheat, rice, and gram are annually exported via the Rae Bareli road to Lucknow, or via Purwa to Cawnpore.\n\nThere is a ruined fort here which was built by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi. There also a tomb here erected to one Agha, who accompanied Sayyad Masa\u00e1d on his crescentade and was killed at this place. A strange superstition hallows it. If, in the course of any dispute between two parties, a deed is produced whose genuineness is denied, the propounder places it on the tomb: whoever impugns it has to take it off the tomb and tear it. History, more or less authentic, relates that whoso thus treats a genuine document loses his thumb, which gives way instead of the parchment.\nThis pargana was formerly held by the Bhars. A party of Sayyad Masa\u00fad's force met here with \u00c1gha, an attendant of T\u00e1j-ud-d\u00edn of Bachhr\u00e1-w\u00e1n; the combined parties attacked the fort held by the Bhar chief; their forces were insufficient; they were repulsed, and \u00c1gha left dead on the field. The Bhars continued to hold this place, just in the centre of Oudh and far from any seat of civilization, four hundred years longer, till 820 A.H., when they were attacked and annihilated by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi of Jaunpur, who left a follower of his own, Sayyad Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, in Hardoi, granting him the property. His descendants still survive in the town. The Kanhpurias acquired a part of this pargana, as follows:\u2014B\u00e1b\u00fa B\u00e1z Bah\u00e1dur having quarrelled with his brother R\u00e1ja Am\u00e1n Singh of Chand\u00e1pur took up his residence in Hanswaria of pargana Simrauta, next to Hardoi. By the connivance of the chakladar he got possession of eight villages in the pargana which he called taluqa Atehra; his son B\u00e1b\u00fa, Raghn\u00e1th afterwards succeeded by adoption to Chand\u00e1pur estate, to which this one was now permanently united. This happened about eighty years ago. Four villages belonging to Amethias were also included in taluqa Thulendi the year after annexation, 1837. There is nothing else worthy of relation. The name of the town is said to be derived from R\u00e1ja Hardoo, the Bhar chief who built it.\n\nHARDOI\u2014Pargana HARDOI\u2014Tahsil DIGBJAIGANJ\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This town stands on the side of the road from Digbijaiaganj to Bachhr\u00e1-w\u00e1n, and lies 12 miles north of the sadr station Rae Bareli and 4 miles east of the town of Thulendi. It was founded by Hardeo, a Bhar, and named after him, and is now constituted a pargana. This must have been more than 866 years ago, for it contains the tomb of \u00c1gha Shah\u00edd of Masa\u00fad's army, but the exact date cannot be ascertained. A mud-built fort was built here by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm of Jaunpur which has fallen into ruins. Sayyad Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, a follower of the king, took up his residence here. The total population amounts to 1,590, of which 94 are Sayyads of the Shia sect, 108 Brahmans, and 103 K\u00e1yaths, who mostly belong to the Shaivi creed; the rest, 1,285, consist of 89 Muhammadans and 1,196 Hindus, all of the lower castes. Here are one brick-built and 259 mud-built houses, two masonry mosques, one other religious building called an idg\u00e1h, and one shiwal\u00e1.\n\n| Latitude | 26\u00b0 28' north |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Longitude | 81\u00b0 15' east  |\n\nHARG\u00c1M Pargana\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Pargana Harg\u00e1m contains an area of 66 square miles, of which 43 are cultivated; its greatest length and breadth being 12 miles and 9 miles respectively.

The Sar\u00e1yan is navigable by small boats.\n\nThe only fair in the pargana is held at the S\u00farajkund (or tank of S\u00faraj, the Sun) in Harg\u00e1m Kh\u00e1s, which takes place twice a year, in K\u00e1rtilk and Jeth, the former being the better attended of the two; as many as 40,000 persons attend and many commodities are sold at it. The baz\u00e1rs are as follows:\u2014Harg\u00e1m Kh\u00e1s on Tuesdays and Fridays, K\u00fat\u00edkal\u00e1n on Wednesdays and Saturdays, Mumt\u00e1zipur on Fridays and Sundays.\n\nNo manufactures are carried on in the pargana, nor is there any article of commerce peculiar to or specially thriving in it. The crops are of the\nordinary description. There are no mines or quarries properly so called. Kankar is found, and from it lime is made to some extent. The productive powers of the soil are a fair average.\n\nThe pargana was constituted as such by Todar Mal, and was included in the Khairabad chakla. On the site of the Government tahsildar's fort a school now stands. The pargana derives its name from the town, and the history of the latter is to a great extent the history of the former. In 1712 A.D. a body of Gaur Chhattirs under one Singha invaded the district, took the town, and settled in the country round; their descendants, as already stated, still hold five-sixths of it. No remains of historical interest are to be met with, and for the legend connecting the P\u00e1ndavas with the city of Bair\u00e1t, Harg\u00e1m, the reader is referred to the history of that town. To what is recorded there, it may be added that the people of Edun also, in district S\u00e1gar, believe that king Bair\u00e1t ruled in their town (vide Central Provinces Gazetteer, article \"S\u00e1gar,\" where the writer speaks of king Bair\u00e1t and a tribe called P\u00e1ndus).\n\n**HARG\u00c1M Town\u2014Pargana HARG\u00c1M\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.**\u2014Harg\u00e1m, though now in great decay, was apparently once a very extensive city. Its origin is lost in remote antiquity, but local tradition tells us how that it was founded by the mythological Harish Chandar of the Solar dynasty; how it fell away after his death; how many years afterwards it was renewed by a raja called Bair\u00e1t; how it again decayed; and how 19 centuries ago the great Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt again rebuilt it. In 1712 A.D. a tribe of Gaur Chhattirs coming from the west attacked and took it, since when it has gradually sunk to its present condition.\n\nIt lies in 27\u00b0 45' north, and 80\u00b0 47' east longitude, and is half-way between Kheri and Sitapur on the highroad. A road also connects it with L\u00e9harpur, ten miles to the east. There is no water communication to or from it. The population numbers 2,832 in all, the Hindus being about three to every two Muhammadans. Among the former, Brahmins and Joshis (a lower order of Brahmins) abound, and the latter have among them many Jul\u00e1has.\n\nThere are two baz\u00e1rs in which nothing but the most ordinary articles are sold, the annual value of the sales being but Rs. 23,212, in which is included the value (Rs. 15,940) of commodities sold at the great m\u011bla in October. This is held at a tank called S\u00farajkund, a structure of very ancient date, and is attended by 40,000 persons. The other sacred places are a mosque and four Hindu temples, none of which requires any notice. There are 419 mud and 138 masonry houses in the town, which also boasts of a school and a registry office. The scholars number 73 in daily attendance.\n\nThe camping ground is in an exceedingly picturesque spot between the town and the tank abovementioned. On one side near the town is a long jhil, dear to wild fowl; on the other, overlooking the tank, is a very striking ridge of earth covered with fine trees, under which, on the other side, is a long and narrow lake. The tank itself, with its Shiw\u00e1la and ruined shrines, shadowed by mighty trees, the abode of numerous monkeys; the\nholy men telling their beads on the brink; the palm tree and the cactus and the sacred pipal tree,\u2014all form a picture worthy the pencil of an artist. The inhabitants believe that the P\u00e1ndavas spent the 13th year of their exile at the old city in the reign of king Bair\u00e1t. If we turn to the Mah\u00e1bharata we find that these heroes did spend the thirteenth year of their exile in the city of R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t. Unfortunately its name is not given in the epic, and we are left to conjecture its locality. In confirmation of the belief entertained by the people of Harg\u00e1m that the king's dominions embraced this part of India, we find an ancient d\u00edh close to Sitapur known as king Bair\u00e1t's d\u00edh. But it may be noted that the people of Gujar\u00e1t in the west of India, and of Dinagepore in the east, also claim each for themselves this famous king.\n\n**HARHA Pargana\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.**\u2014This pargana, the largest in Unao, is of a triangular shape, with its apex pointing southwards, and penetrating between the Ganges and pargana Gh\u00e1tampur, formerly in the Rae Bareli district. It was formerly called \"R\u00e1wat\u00e1na.\" It is twenty-five miles long from east to west, and sixteen from north to south. It comprises 177 villages and an area of 145,557 acres, or 227 square miles, of which 109 are cultivated. The soil is good, and its surface is covered with groves of mango, which embrace 11,917 acres. These are the remains of a magnificent grove called the \"lakh-per\u00e1,\" or the 100,000 trees, near Harha.\n\nWater is said to be very distant\u2014seventy-five feet\u2014from the surface. Wheat and gram are the principal crops. The tenures are as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Copyhold | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| ...       | ...      | ...       | ...      |\n| ...       | ...      | ...       | ...      |\n| ...       | ...      | ...       | ...      |\n\nThe land revenue is Rs. 1,77,024, which falls at the rate of Re. 1-3-0 per acre. The population is 116,329, or 512 to the square mile.\n\nTwo streams take their course through this pargana,\u2014the Gurd\u00e1ta, which is a mere lateral channel of the Ganges, and passes through it into Daundia Khera, and the Lon, which rises in Unao; both are freely used for irrigation, but are dry during the hot weather. Near the village of Gurwa Bishunpur there is a lake three miles in length which contains water all the year round; there is also abundance of fish, but waterfowl are unusually scarce. Herds of nil-g\u00e1e and black buck are found everywhere.\n\nThere are fourteen baz\u00e1rs in which articles of country produce are sold. Three fairs are held during the year. The largest is at Kolhw\u00e1g\u00e1ra on the Ganges, and is attended by 120,000 persons, in November; at Bithar, and Magarw\u00e1ra assemblies are held in honour of Mah\u00e1deo in March and November.\n\nIt is said that in early times a large human bone three cubits in length was found at the spot where the town of Harha now stands. Jasa Singh, Lodh of Indrapur, who owned the land to the east, claimed the bone. Bh\u00fare Ah\u00edr of Shekh\u00fapur, a convert to the Musalman faith, who owned the land\nwest of the spot, also claimed the bone. The two fought on their border, and the Lodh winning founded Harha, calling it after the bone. During the battle Sayyad Maqb\u00fbl-i-\u00c1lam, who was giving assistance to the convert, was killed. His tomb is still to be seen inside the old fort.\n\nShortly afterwards an unusually warlike K\u00e1yath named Chaturbhuj D\u00e1s, an agent of R\u00e1ja Jai Chand of Kanauj, drove out the triumphant Lodh, acquired the estate, and founded seventy-five new villages. His family in turn has decayed, and Shiu R\u00e1j Singh, q\u00e1n\u00fango, is now his only descendant and the owner of two villages. The present chief of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Kanhaya L\u00e1l, acquired the town of Harha by mortgage from this K\u00e1yath family.\n\nThe R\u00e1wuts of Harha are thus described by Elliot, \"Chronicles of Oonao,\" pages 63-65:\n\n\"The Rawuts are another class, who are peculiar to the district of Oonao. There is more than one account current respecting their origin, but the generally received tradition is that they are the 'fifth sons'* of Raja Tilokchund, who at his death gave them for their inheritance the pergunnah of Hurha, which is called Rotana or Rawutana from them. At present, however, they only possess three out of twelve Tuppehs, into which the pergunnah is divided, four of the tribes mentioned above, Chundeles, Gehlores, Gours, and Mahrors, having encroached on their inheritance. This loss of power is attributed by them to an insurrection of the Sonars, the aboriginal possessors of the soil, in which the Rawuts were nearly extirpated. Only one man escaped, Rawut B\u00edn\u00e9 Singh, who went to Delhi and entered the military service of the king. Having found means to secure favour at Court, he obtained the grant of a force to reinstate himself in his ancestral possessions. The Sonars had a strong fort at Behtur, in which on the 22nd day of the month Cheit they were keeping the festival of the Bhudr Kalie Debie. B\u00edn\u00e9 Singh attacked them here at night, when they were all very drunk, and slaughtered the entire clan. He was too weak, however, to regain the whole of this large pergunnah, and could only occupy the neighbourhood of Behtur, which, like the Sonars, the Rawuts made their headquarters. B\u00edn\u00e9 Singh lived about 250 years ago, though there are no accurate grounds for determining the exact date. After some generations he was succeeded, about 1700, by the man who occupies the chief place in Rawut estimation, Dulnaran Singh, who, though not converted, received from Delhi the Mahommedan title of Cheepie Khan. He recovered the Rawut sovereignty over all the Hurha pergunnah, and even extended it into pergunnah Oonao, wresting from the Syuds the large village of Murtizanugur, with its adjoining hamlets.\n\n* The common Rajpoot euphemism for bastards. Another account is that the Rawuts were cart-drivers, who in the battle with the Puthans rallied round Tilokchund in company with the palki bearers and carried him off in safety. The origin of the story is probably that the name Rawut is supposed to belong especially to the Aheer tribe, which from carters are usually taken. The story of the Rawuts themselves is that they are legitimate Baisees, so that in the massacre by the sowars only one woman escaped, who was protected by an Aheer. She was pregnant at the time, and in gratitude for the protection called her son Rawut B\u00edn\u00e9 Singh, after the Aheer's title. It is more probable that the Rawuts are illegitimate descendants of Tilokchund by an Aheer woman.\n\"This aggression brought down upon him the Foujdar of Baiswara, whose letters record a victory over him. It is certain, however, that Cheepie Khan did not lose this acquisition during his lifetime, and after his death all the power he had acquired beyond the confines of the three Rawut Tuppehs fell from the hands of his disunited descendants. Cheepie Khan married twice, and had six sons by the first marriage and two by the second. He insisted on having his estate divided equally between the offspring of the two wives, half going to the six elder brothers and half to the younger two. This led to a bitter quarrel, and Kesri, the eldest son, murdered him while engaged in devotion. This occurred about 1740. Abul Munsoor Khan, Suffdur Jung, the first 'Nawab' of Oudh, took advantage of the confusion and disunion of the brothers to demand a great increase of revenue from them. They refused to accede to this, and were besieged in Behtur by Munsoor for a long time, but without any success. At last Rao Murdan Singh, who was then in High Court favour, offered to mediate, and trusting to the chivalrous generosity of a Rajpoot, entered the fort alone and unarmed.\n\n\"He induced the Rawuts to submit, on the understanding that no increase of taxation should be demanded, but the Nawab refused to ratify this agreement, and for forty years the Rawuts were out of possession of their estates, which were given to Achul Singh, Rao Murdan's son. On his death in 1780 they were restored, and since then their occupation has been undisturbed.\"\n\nIt would perhaps be impossible under English rule to find an instance of a family, one of whose members had risen to high office, and which afterwards remained in utter obscurity for ten generations. R\u00e1ja Harbans K\u00e1yath built, a very fine house, the walls of which are of limestone blocks to a height of about fifteen feet, then a brick turreted wall; over the gateway is an elaborate frieze of red stone in which appear alternately pairs of geese and pairs of elephants. A large hall of audience supported on carved pillars formerly stood here, but \u00c1sif-ud-daula took these away to help in building his \u00cdm\u00e1mb\u00e1ra at Lucknow. One of the family was then an official in a small way at the Court of Ujjain; he returned to remonstrate, but apparently without effect. This building is very picturesque and massive; from its strength of construction it would seem to defy the hand of time, which has only as yet chipped off the coigns and pinnacles, and here and there planted a pipal on the loftiest towers.\n\nTour note.\u2014In village Badarqa Harbans there exists a decayed family of K\u00e1yaths, which, however, counts among its ancestors during the last three hundred years only one man who attained a great or even a respectable position in Government service. R\u00e1ja Harbans was an official, not a D\u00edw\u00e1n, as alleged, at the Court of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n in 1052 A.H. (1643 A.D.); 500 bighas were granted to him in pargana Harha, (the deed his descendant now produces is evidently a later copy, not unlikely a fabrication; the seal bears the date 1025 A.H., when Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n was not on the throne.) This R\u00e1ja Harbans was an adherent of Sh\u00e1h Mur\u00e1d's (vide documents in the keeping of the family), but Aurangzeb did not involve him in the ruin which overtook that prince, for his\nson Narohtam D\u00e1s appears from the muniments to have had three villages, Harbansnagar, now Badarqa Harbans, which had been founded on the 500 bighas, R\u00e1wal, and Jagiwanpur, in 1077 A.H., (1667). Curious to relate, none of R\u00e1ja Harbans\u2019 descendants had the good fortune to attract Court favours.\n\nHARHA\u2014Pargana HARHA\u2014Tahsil UNAO\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Was formerly the headquarters of one of the tahsils of Unao, and is distant about eight miles south-east from the sadr station. The road between Unao and Rae Bareli districts passes about two miles to the north. It is watered by the Gurdhoi flowing through, and the Ganges at a distance of about two miles south of it. No large town is near. It dates its foundation from 414 Hijri in the time of Sultan Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. Prior to this there was on the same spot a village called Shekh\u00e1pur in the possession of the Ah\u00edr tribe. To the west the village Indrapur, about one mile and a half distant, belonging to the Lodhas. The zamindars of these villages fell out and the Indrapur zamindars were victorious. Shekh\u00e1pur fell into their hands, and they made great improvements, had all the jungle cut away, brought in new settlers, and called it Harha.\n\nIt is on a plain without any jungle in any of the neighbouring villages. The appearance of the village is very picturesque, climate healthy, water for the most part sweet, though there are some brackish wells. M\u00e1n Singh, an ancestor of Sh\u00edr\u00e1j Singh, the present q\u00e1n\u00fan\u00ed, was a very respectable officer and a great j\u00e1g\u00edr holder in the reign of Emperor \u00c1lamg\u00edr. R\u00e1e Dhan Singh, R\u00e1e Baij N\u00e1th, and R\u00e1e Shambhu N\u00e1th were officers of high note appointed by the Lucknow Government in the times of Asif-ud-daula and Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan.\n\nThese gentlemen were all inhabitants of this place and belonged to the K\u00e1yath caste. There is one monument of Maqb\u00fal-i-\u00c1lam, the general of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, and a fort erected by him. There is now a school numbering 65 pupils. There was a th\u00e1na and tahsil in the king\u2019s time, and also two baz\u00e1rs weekly. The annual sales amount to Rs. 950.\n\n**Population.**\n\n| Hind\u00fas | Musalm\u00e1ns |\n|--------|-----------|\n| 3,998 | 1,448 |\n\nTotal 5,446.\n\nThere are 1,896 mud-built and three masonry houses, twenty temples and six mosques, fifteen temples or shiw\u00e1las, two to Debi, fourteen to Mah\u00e1deo, one to Ganesh, and one to Vishnu, a th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra as it is generally called.\n\nHASANGANJ\u2014Pargana MOH\u00c1N AUR\u00c1S\u2014Tahsil MOH\u00c1N\u2014District UNAO.\u2014This is a baz\u00e1r situated at the junction of the two roads from Mi\u00e1nganj and Ras\u00falabad to Moh\u00e1n, and about four miles from the latter place. It was founded by Hasan Raza Khan, Naib of \u00c1sif-ud-daula, in the village of Mah\u00e1deo pur B\u00e1lamau, which that monarch granted to him on rent-free tenure. It is a place of some small trade, but chiefly samples are brought from dealers to test. It consists of one wide street lined with trees and\nshops on both sides. The population is 1,500, consisting of agriculturists, bani\u00e1ns, and other dealers. There is a Government school attended by 30 boys.\n\nHASANPUR\u2014Pargana SULTANPUR\u2014Tahsil SULTANPUR\u2014District SULTANPUR.\u2014Hasanpur or Hasanpur Bandhua lies four miles west of Sultanpur, a little to the north of the Lucknow road, in lat. 26\u00b016' north, long. 82\u00b03' east. It is the residence of the Hasanpur chiefs, by the most famous of whom, Hasan Khan, it was founded in the reign of Sher Shah. It stands on the site of a former village, which probably derived its name from its proximity on the north to one of the deep ravines connected with the Gumti. The present town bears a poor and dilapidated appearance, but its prosperity is seemingly on the increase, for thirty years ago its population numbered only 600, whereas it now amounts to 4,338. A Government school has been established in it within the last few years, and this is the only public building it contains.\n\nBandhua is the name of a village adjoining Hasanpur, notable for containing the tomb, and having been the seat, of B\u00e1ba Sh\u00e1haj R\u00e1m, a famous N\u00e1nak Sh\u00e1hi faq\u00edr. The Sangat or shrine is tended by a mahant, who has a large establishment of disciples living upon the revenue drawn from one or two endowed villages. The ph\u00fal vessels, the manufacture of Bandhua, are much in request elsewhere.\n\nHATHAURA*\u2014Pargana SANDILA\u2014Tahsil SANDILA\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014(2,618 inhabitants). A Cham\u00e1r village of 511 mud houses, ten miles north-west from Sandila, in pargana Sandila, district Hardoi. Hathaura was founded a hundred years ago by the great-grandfather of Bh\u00e1rath Singh, the Bais Taluqdar of Atwa.\n\nThe baz\u00e1r contains between 50 or 60 petty shops. There is a daily market.\n\nHAWEI OUDH\u2020 Pargana\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014Pargana Haweli Oudh, in the district of Fyzabad, takes its name from Oudh, the capital, and Haweli, the name generally used to indicate the principal station of the chief revenue authorities of the Mughals. The pargana is bounded on the north and east by the river Gogra, on the south by the river Madha and parganas Pachhimr\u00e1th and Amsin, and on the west by pargana Mangalsi. In former days the revenue collections of the pargana used to be made at the Qila-i-Mub\u00e1rak (blessed fort), which was situated at Lachhmangh\u00e1t, where now stands the recently built temple of Jugla Saran. In the days of Mans\u00far Ali Khan (A.D 1739-54) they used to be made at R\u00e1th Haweli, and in the time of the Bah\u00fa Begam at or near the Dilkusha, both of which latter places are in the city of Fyzabad.\n\nThe pargana differs from all others in the district, inasmuch as there never were any of the usual tappa subdivisions. It contained in the king's time 329 townships. These were reduced under summary settlement to 242 in number, and they have now been further cut down to 181 demarcated villages, under the re-distribution of the revised settlement.\n\n*By Mr. A. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020By Mr. P. Carnegy, Commissioner.\nIts area is 126 square miles; 43,000 acres are cultivated, 5,280 acres under groves, 12,144 acres are barren, 5,836 acres are capable of cultivation. The population is 131,337, which amounts to 1,042 to the square mile. The Government revenue is Rs. 96,920, which is Re. 1-15-0, per acre of arable land, a very low rate.\n\nIn addition to the rivers Gogra and Madha already mentioned, a petty rivulet, the Tel\u00e1i or Tilang, which is of some traditional importance, has its rise in pargana Mangalsi, runs through this pargana, and falls into the Gogra at Ajodhya. Opposite Fyzabad the Gogra is five miles broad from bank to bank in the rains, and its bed at this point is subject to continual change, so that it can never be said till the waters subside whether the ferry will be over one or two or three streams. It is beyond question that the bridge of boats ought to be at Lachhmanghat, where there is but one stream between high banks, and where it would, with little alteration of roads, carry the traffic of Basti and Gorakhpur as well as that of Gonda.\n\nThe Madha, which has its rise in mauza Bis\u00fadhi, is subject to sudden rises in the rains, is not navigable in this part of the district, but is much used for irrigation purposes. Tradition, here as elsewhere in this district, attributes all rights in the soil to the Bhars, who were suppressed after the Muhammadan supremacy, and of whom traces are still pointed out in numerous villages.\n\nIn more modern times (1) Bashisht Brahmans, (2) S\u00farajbansi Chhattris, (3) Gargbansi Chhattris, (4) Bais Chhattris, (5) Up\u00e1ddhia Brahmans, (6) Bhadarsa Sayyads, (7) Maujadubanspur Kurmis, were the chief landed proprietors. Of these several families I now proceed to give some brief details.\n\nThe Bashisht Brahmans.\u2014The members of this family assert descent from Bashisht Muni, the spiritual adviser of the immortal R\u00e1m Chandar from whom that portion of the town which is still known as Bashisht Tola takes its name, and whose sacred memory is still kept fresh by the annual visits of his votaries to the Bashisht Kund or reservoir in the same quarter. After the vicissitudes of the Buddhist and atheist periods, when the Vedic faith was for the time, it is believed, locally suppressed, Ajodhya was again traditionally restored and Brahmanically re-peopled through the exertions of Bikram\u00e1jit of Ujjain; and K\u00e1shi R\u00e1m and other members of the present Bashisht tribe, who now inhabit the ancient haunts of the family, aver that their ancestors were then recalled by the sovereign in question from Kashmir, and received from him large assignments of revenue-free land. It is the further averment of these persons that they retained their possessions during the supremacy of the non-Brahmanical Bhars, but it is almost needless to say that no proofs are extant either of their advent from Kashmir or their steadfastness of faith under the Bhars. In the Ain-i-Akbari, the oldest reliable historical record, Bashisht Brahmans are stated to be the prevailing caste of zamindars in this pargana. The\nproprietary status of this family waned before the modern S\u00farajbansi clan, the annals of which will follow, and its members are now reduced to the possession of exproprietary petty holdings (s\u00edr) and dues (sayar) in the R\u00e1n\u00fap\u00e1li, Anjna, N\u00e1rainpur, and Lachhm\u00edd\u00e1sipur estates, which comprise thirty-two villages in all, in which also they chiefly reside.\n\nThe S\u00farajbansi Chhattris.\u2014It is the assertion of the present local members of this tribe that 350 years ago their common ancestor L\u00e1lji Singh came from Kallu Kam\u00e1yan (Kumaun) and settled in the suburb of Fyzabad which is now known as Sultanpur in rear of the Gul\u00e1b\u00e1b\u00e1ri. He and his three sons are said subsequently to have joined the service of D\u00e1ndas S\u00e1h, a dealer of Puram\u00e1rna, now more generally known as Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00ednagar. This man had excavated a large tank in the neighbourhood of that place, to which he had given his own name. There dwelt hard by in the village of Bilah\u00e1ri, Sh\u00e1h Bh\u00edkha, a hermit of great repute. On one occasion the dealer found this hermit washing his teeth at the edge of his tank, and admonished him for so doing. This so enraged the hermit that he gave vent to his feelings and vowed that in future donkeys even should not drink at the tank, and in consequence water is but rarely to be found in it. The curse of the hermit seems to have extended to the dealer also, for adversity soon overtook him and he died childless, his landed property falling into the hands of L\u00e1lji Singh, the S\u00farajbans servant, of whom we have already heard. This man improved his opportunities to such good effect that at his death he was the proprietor of 97 villages. The present members of the family are in the twelfth generation from the common ancestor L\u00e1lji Singh. They still possess rights in fifty-four villages. In 21 of these they are independent proprietors; in 28 they are in subordination to the taluqdar of Maujadubanspur, and in the remaining five to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Sir M\u00e1n Singh. The ex-r\u00e1jas of Amorha and Maholi in the Basti district, the R\u00e1ja of Mohason in that district, and the R\u00e1ja of Har\u00e1ha in Bara Banki were all chiefs of colonies that broke off at different times from the original P\u00fara stem.\n\nThe Gargbans Chhattris of Kusmaha.\u2014The traditions of this clan allege a descent from Garg Muni or R\u00e1j, or Rikh, a devotee of old, who according to some was summoned by R\u00e1ja Dasrath, the father of R\u00e1ma, from Kanauj to aid him in performing the sacrifice of the horse, and by others, by R\u00e1ja Bikramj\u00edt from Kaikaides, on his restoration of Ajodhya. The proprietary possessions of the clan began in this pargana, where at a very early period they are said to have acquired the estates marginally named, consisting of ten townships, but large estates were also acquired by them elsewhere. This branch of the family held proprietary possession of the above four estates until A.D 1816, after which their lands were absorbed into the Mahdona taluqa, and now the old proprietors are reduced to the possession of s\u00edr and sayar in their old villages.\n\nThe Bais Chhattris.\u2014There is a colony of this clan in the pargana the members of which aver that their ancestors Kanak R\u00e1e and T\u00edr Singh came from Baisw\u00e1ra 500 years ago and displaced the Bhars in the possession\nof thirty-seven villages. But their rights in these have long been over ridden by others, eleven villages having passed into taluqa Mahdona, 16 into taluqa Maujadubanspur, while others are in the hands of muafidars and other independent proprietors. The Bais are still, however, the recorded proprietors of mauza Ashrafpur, and they hold minor subordinate rights in others of their old villages. I have no faith whatever in the alleged advent from Baiswara. The Bais were few even there 500 years ago, and they do not readily own such offshoots as this. I have no doubt whatever that this colony was of local origin.\n\nThe Upaddhia Brahmins.\u2014One Paras Ram Upaddhia is said by his descendants to have come from over the Gogra 300 years ago, and to have married into the local Bashish family. He acquired a proprietary title in eight villages in this pargana as his marriage portion, and to these he afterwards added four others. These villages all passed into the Mahdona taluqa about forty years ago, but Babu Ram and Jagmohan are still recorded sub-proprietors of the Usen mohal, which consists of two mauzas, and the family also hold petty tenures in some of their other villages as well.\n\nThe Sayyads of Bhadarsa.\u2014Three hundred years are said to have elapsed since one Sayyad Zain-ul-\u00e1bidin, alias Mira Zaina, the ancestor of the present Bhadarsa Sayyad family, of which Husen Baksh and Muhammad Jafar are the heads, came from Naishapur in the retinue of one of the Oudh Subahdars, and settled in Deh Katawan near Bhadarsa, where, as usual, he is said to have displaced the Bhars in the possession of 19 villages. These 19 villages, which were formerly on the Government revenue lists, were, owing to the exercise of holy functions by the Sayyads, made revenue-free in 1836 A.D. by Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Khan, and the assignment has been continued in perpetuity by the British Government.\n\nThe shrine of the sainted Mira Zaina at Bhadarsa is still visited by considerable crowds on the 26th and 27th of Rab\u00ed-ul-Awal, who make offerings of sweetmeats. Thieves, it is said, are detected by sending suspected persons to bring away flowers from within the tomb. On their exit they are asked how many graves or recesses they saw within, and the guilty invariably answer wrong.\n\nThe Kurmis of Maujadubanspur.\u2014Some seventy years ago, one Gharib Das Kurmi is said to have started from his home in Padampur, pargana Birhar of this district, for Lucknow, accompanied by his youthful son Darshan Kurmi. Tradition further affirms that for a time after their arrival the father and son obtained their livelihood by working as day labourers on certain fortifications then being constructed. The boy was of comely countenance, and on this account is believed to have attracted the attention of the ruler of the day, Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, by whose order he was soon after enrolled in a regiment of youths kept up by that Naw\u00e1b under the designation of the \"Shait\u00e1n-ki-Paltan,\" which may fairly be rendered \"the devil's own.\" The boy Darshan in time rose to be a jamadar, and at a later period, when he had arrived at man's estate, he was selected by the same authority as one of the personal\norderlies, whose chief duty it was to guard his master's bed. By Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, who succeeded Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, Darshan Singh was entrusted with the command of a regiment, and when that ruler was afterwards made king by us, one of the first persons whom he in turn ennobled was the Kurmi Darshan Singh, who was then created a raja. In the reign of the next sovereign, Nasir-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, the importance of the raja was still further advanced by his being permitted to sit in the royal presence, with the additional title of Ghalibjang (conqueror in battle). Darshan Singh continued to prosper throughout the reigns of Muhammad Ali Shah and Amjad Ali Shah, and he died in 1851, while the last king of Oudh still sat on his throne, at the great age of eighty.\n\nThe career of this adventurer was not, however, without many vicissitudes, and they are all recorded in Sleeman's journal volume I., pages 154 to 162. One day a royal favourite with boundless influence, another the occupant of a cage with snakes and scorpions for his companions. In the year 1835 A.D., and again in 1843 A.D., we find that he incurred the royal displeasure, in consequence of which the fine estate that he had previously created was broken up, and its component villages were restored to the former proprietors. The displeasure was, however, only of temporary duration, for at the annexation we found the son of Darshan Singh, R\u00e1ja Jai L\u00e1l Singh, in possession of the Maujadubanspur taluqa, the only taluqa that had its headquarters in this pargana, and which on the death of his father he duly inherited. The taluqa was made up of the estates noted below, where also the year of incorporation is mentioned:\n\n| Maujadubanspur | ... | ... | ... | ... | 8 villages in 1927 Fa\u0161li |\n| Palia Shah-Badi | ... | ... | ... | ... | 3 \" 1829 \" |\n| Janaura, &c. | ... | ... | ... | ... | 47 \" \" |\n| R\u00e1n\u00fap\u00e1l\u00ed | ... | ... | ... | ... | 4 \" 1890 \" |\n| Deok\u00e1ll\u00ed | ... | ... | ... | ... | 2 \" 1855 \" |\n\nTotal ... 64\n\nR\u00e1ja Jai L\u00e1l, who played an important part against us in the mutiny, was committed by me for trial, and hanged at Lucknow, in September 1859, on proof of the following charges:\u2014\u201c(1) Being a leader in rebellion; in organizing a rebel government; in having placed himself at the head of rebel sepoys and murderers; in becoming the spokesman of the rebel officers to the Begam, and medium of communication between the rebel army and Birjisqadr; in holding high office; in having a jail for the confinement of Christians, and in encouraging the arrest and extermination of Christians generally, and their followers. (2) Aiding and abetting in the murder of Mrs. Green, Miss Jackson, Mrs. Rodgers, Mr. Baptist Jones, Mr. Carew, Mr. J. Sullivan, Mrs. Feelow (insane), and other Christians, and Mahm\u00fad Khan, Kotw\u00e1l, in all 22 or 23 persons on the 24th September, 1857.\u201d His property, including Government paper, was confiscated, and his estate was conferred on R\u00e1ja Rustam S\u00e1h for conspicuous loyalty. Jai L\u00e1l's son Th\u00e1kur Parsh\u00e1d is at present a student in the Canning College. The younger brothers of Jai L\u00e1l Singh, Raghubar Day\u00e1l and Beni M\u00e1dho, who were also rebel leaders, are residents of the Azamgarh district, and are still in possession of Government paper to the extent of Rs. 2,18,000\nand Rs. 56,000, from which they have an annual income respectively of Rs. 9,000 and Rs. 2,200. The former of these was sent to bring the N\u00e1na in state to Lucknow, on his being driven over the Ganges by our troops in 1857.\n\nThe most numerous caste is that of the Brahmans, who number 13,162; the Ah\u00edrs come next with 12,138; there are above 14,000 Musalmans, and 3,215 of the mercantile class, the Vaishyas.\n\nThe pargana contains the remarkable towns of Ajodhya and Fyzabad, in which articles further details of the pargana history are given.\n\nHINDAUR\u2014Pargana PARTABGARH\u2014Tahsil PARTABGARH\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014Hindaaur r\u0101kshas (a demon) is stated according to tradition to have founded this village. It is near the road from Bela to Rae Bareli, fifteen miles from the former. R\u00e1ja Bhim is said here to have fought Hindui, the child of S\u00e1tan. This was a prosperous place formerly, but most of the inhabitants left it and went into Ph\u00falpur in the Allahabad district. The population consists of Hindus 801, and Musalmans 308, total 1,109. The remains of the old fort and tanks are still to be seen. It was for some time the headquarters of the Sombansi r\u00e1j of Partabgarh (q.v.)\n\nHIS\u00c1MPUR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil KUR\u00c1SAR\u2014District BAHRAICH.\u2014This pargana, situated at the southernmost corner of the triangle which comprises the Bahraich district, is one of the oldest in it.\n\nAs at present defined, however, its boundaries differ considerably from those which limited it both in Akbar's time and during the Naw\u00e1bi. A large area had been stripped from its eastern border and included in what is now the Gonda district, while it has been recompensed for this loss by a tract on its north border which has been snatched from Fatehpur. The result of these mutilations is that the pargana has been left very unshapely in its appearance on the map, its greatest length from north to south being some thirty-two miles, while its greatest breadth is only fourteen miles. It is bounded on the north by the Fatehpur pargana, on the east by the Gonda district and the rivers Tirhi and Sarju, and on the west by the river Gogra. The whole pargana lies low, and its general appearance supports the tradition that in former ages it was subjected to fluvial action as the Gogra retreated westward and southward. The ground rises slightly towards the eastern boundary. The rivers are those mentioned above, the two first mentioned being feeders of the third, the junction being effected in the Gonda district.\n\nThe country is well wooded, there being 6,846 acres, or $3\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the total area, grove land; of waste land there is less (33 per cent.) than in any other pargana in the district; of a total area of 300 square miles, 155 are under the plough, only 6 of which are irrigated. There is every reason to believe, however, that the irrigated area will soon be much extended. Water is met with at an average depth of 18 feet.\n\n* By Mr. H. S.

They are a branch of the Baundi house (see below). The Kalhans are members of the Chhedwara Thakur family, who have gradually obtained a footing in the pargana, displacing the Sayyads.\n\nThe main roads that run through this pargana are\u2014one from Bahraich to Bahramghat thirty-five miles; a second from Bahraich to Colonelganj thirty-one miles; and a third from Bahramghat to Colonelganj fourteen miles. The first mentioned is an imperial line, and it is about to be metalled. All three lines are much used, the main traffic going by Colonelganj.\n\nThe chief markets are at Jarwal and Khutgagh\u00e1t, but at Colonelganj, in the Gonda district, is the market most resorted to for wholesale grain transactions. There are minor bazars at Sangana, Kur\u00e1sar, Kotwa, and Patupur. At Gandh\u00e1ra, the headquarters of the Ambapur taluqdar, a cattle market, well frequented, is held every Thursday. Bahrampur also has several cloth-merchants' shops, &c., though no open bazar is held here.\n\nGovernment village schools are maintained at:\n\n| Village     | Boys |\n|-------------|------|\n| Jarwal      | 78   |\n| Bahrampur   | 45   |\n| Katgar Bhetaura | 31   |\n| Wairi       | 79   |\n| Kur\u00e1sar     | 40   |\n| Gulraba     | 50   |\n| Patupur     | 20   |\n| Bahralli    | 50   |\n| **Total**   | **388** |\n\nThere are district post-offices at Kur\u00e1sar and Jarwal. The police station is at Kur\u00e1sar. There is a Government dispensary at His\u00e1mpur, the average annual number of patients being 1,673, the annual cost Rs. 556.\n\nThe pargana is one of the oldest in the district, and takes its name from the village which was founded by some Ansaris in honour of His\u00e1m-ul-haq, who is said to have been one of the comrades of the crescentader Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, and to have perished with him in battle. Like the rest of the district, this portion of it at the time of the invasion of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r was held by the Bhars, who seem to have maintained their position of influence in the country for several centuries subsequent to that event. The Ansaris, an Arab tribe, appear to have been the first permanent Muhammadan settlers in the district. The date of their arrival was probably 1226 A.D., when Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad brought Oudh into subjection. They occupied His\u00edmpur, Pachambar, and Tawakkulpur, and increased their possessions until they had acquired and populated about 250 villages. The Bhars, however, still held their own, and in the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq, the ancestor of the Jarwal Sayyads found great difficulty in obtaining possession of the j\u00e1g\u00edr that had been bestowed on him (see Jarwal town). The Sayyads came originally from Persia, having to flee before Jangez Khan to Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and ultimately to Lahore, whence they found their way to Delhi and Bado Sarai in Bara Banki district. The\nAnsaris passed away, and their possessions seem to have fallen into the hands of the Sayyads, who, at the commencement of this century, are found possessed of 276 villages, of which 157 had been acquired by purchase. In their turn, however, they had to give way before the Kalhans Rajputs of Chhedwara, who within the last fifty years have acquired 112 villages in this pargana.\n\nThe Raikwar villages, fifty-two in number, lying to the north of the pargana, are held by the descendants of Harhardeo, fourth raja of Banhnauti (Baundi), who being summoned to Delhi, returned to find his son on the gaddi. He therefore took a second wife, the daughter of a Brahman, the owner of these villages, and leaving his son in possession of his ancestral estate founded the Harharpur ilaka. This half-hundred of villages* are almost the only property held by coparcenary communities in this district. A number of the shares are now held in subordination to Mahant Harcharan Das.\n\nThe ilaka of Dubhapur is another ancestral estate which exists, now unimpaired. One Shekh Nizam-ud-din, descendant of a Qazi of Oudh, married the only daughter and heiress of one Shekh Muhammad Roshan of Rehauda Rasulpur, and his descendant in the fifth degree married the only daughter of Shekh Ali Muhammad, the last of the Ansaris. By this marriage the two estates of Rehauda Rasulpur and Gandhara with Ambapur were united. Ali Muhammad's ancestor had been made qanungo of the pargana, and the office as well as the property descended to his son-in-law, whose descendants Shekh Niwazish Ali and Wazir Ali still hold.\n\nThe Nanpara taluqdar owns a few villages in the pargana, which he owes to the tact of one of his ancestors who showed Asif-ud-daula such good sport in the north of the district that the Nawab made over to him this estate in the south.\n\nThe Baundi raja also within the 40 years immediately preceding annexation managed to acquire a few of the khalsa villages. These are now held by the raja of Kapurthala. With the exception of the Raikwari villages to the north of the pargana, the estates are much intermingled, a peculiarity accounted for by the general scramble for the Sayyads' villages which marked the history of this pargana during the last three decades of the Nawabi rule.\n\nIn Akbar's time the pargana is recorded to have consisted of 107,400 bighas of cultivation, and to have been paying a revenue of Rs. 1,18,676.\n\nIn Shah Jahans reign, however, there were included in the pargana 870 villages measuring 435,702 bighas total area, and paying a revenue of Rs. 1,47,848. Of these 870 villages 398 were transferred to other parganas prior to 1223 F., and 226 were similarly transferred between 1224 F. and annexation, leaving 245 villages and chaks in 1263. Under British rule 482 were re-transferred, raising the total to 727, which were demarcated in 447 circles; of these 41 have been once again excluded from the pargana, which now consists of 46 villages.\n\n* Subsequently increased in number to 105.\nIBRAHIMABAD\u2014Pargana SATRIKH\u2014Tahsil NAWABGANJ\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This village lies on the Gumti, and is chiefly inhabited by Kurmis.\n\nDuring the Nawabi the proprietorship of the village changed hands several times. Originally it was in the possession of the ancestors of Chaudhri Nawab Ali. In 1253\u201459 Fasli, Safdar Ali, of Satrikh, held the village in qubuliat; in 1260\u201464 Qazi Sarfaraz Ali held it as lessee. In 1264 Fasli, as the taluqdari system was not introduced, Jam\u00e1l Ashraf and Kunwar Bah\u00e1dur were appointed lambardars of this village, the jama of which was fixed at Rs. 3,848. In 1266 Fasli half of the village was settled with Chaudhri Nawab Ali, and half with Qazi Sarfaraz Ali. The total jama is Rs. 4,100: it includes no dakhili villages.\n\nThere is one masonry well in this village. The distance at which water is found varies. There are 15 tanks, both large and small. In fact the village is well supplied with means of irrigation. The market days are Sundays and Thursdays. There is a good deal of trade in grain.\n\n| Population | Musalmans | Hindus |\n|------------|-----------|--------|\n|            | 417       | 2,678  |\n\n| Latitude   | Longitude |\n|------------|-----------|\n| 26\u00b050'     | 81\u00b015'    |\n\nICHAULI\u2014Pargana DARYABAD\u2014Tahsil RAM SANEHI GHAT\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014A small Musalman town, 25 miles east-north-east of the Sadr. Tradition relates that it was founded in 423 A.H., in the reign of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni. It is said that there was formerly a village of the same name founded by Ichauli, a Bhar chief, who was subdued by the Ghazni king, whose lieutenants, Saif-ud-d\u00edn, Qazi Kab\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn, and others, having been granted the village in j\u00e1gir, razed the Bhar fort to the ground, and founded a new town, but with the original name, colonizing it from their followers, the old inhabitants having disappeared with their Bhar chiefs. The different muhallas, such as S\u00e1l\u00e1r and Qazi\u00e1na, were named after the abovementioned lieutenants. The descendants of these men still own the village. Water-supply is abundant from a good number of tanks and wells, both of mud and masonry. Mahar\u00e1ja Tikait Rae, finance minister of Asif-ud-daula, was born here, and built a fine masonry tank.\n\nPopulation 4,570, of whom 2,509 are Hindus and 2,061 Muhammadans.

The population is 2,134.\n\nIKAUNA Pargana\u2014Tahsil BAHR\u00c1ICH\u2014District BAHR\u00c1ICH.\u2014Ikauna pargana is a creation of the English Government, it having formerly been included in Bahaich. It is of a most irregular shape, and forms the base of the triangle which comprises the district, marching with the Gonda.\n\n* By Mr. H. S. Boys, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\ndistrict on the south-east throughout its entire length of thirty-seven miles; its breadth varies from two to twelve miles, and it has an area of 259 square miles, comprising 213 demarcated villages. It is bounded on the west by Bahraich pargana, on the north-west by Bhinga, and on the east and south by the Gonda district. The level is generally lower than that of the country to the west. Its rivers are the R\u00e1pti, the Singhia, (called higher up the stream the Bhakla), and the Koh\u00e1ni. These all have a south-east course, traversing, the two former the northern portion of the pargana, and the last mentioned the southern division. Between the Singhia and the Koh\u00e1ni runs, also in a south-east direction, a strip of tree jungle about twenty miles long, with an average breadth of three miles. The tract that lies between the Singhia and the R\u00e1pti is a portion of the du\u00e1b described in Bhinga pargana; while the Durg\u00e1pur il\u00e1qa, which is the trans-R\u00e1pti portion of the pargana, is similar in all respects to the Tar\u00e1i portion of Bhinga (which see). The southern division of the pargana is divided from the northern by the Koh\u00e1ni stream, and lies somewhat higher than the neighbouring country. The soil throughout the pargana is excellent, mainly consisting of good clay, mixed in the most favourable proportions with sand, and in the northern part of the pargana of fine alluvial deposit. Of the whole area of the pargana 139 square miles are under the plough, of which about one-fourth is irrigated. The waste, including the strip of tree jungle, measures 92 square miles. Of grove land there are 4,550 acres, or 2\u00bd per cent. of the whole area.

The Bais are a miscellaneous lot, who have probably as much or as little right to the tribal cognomen as most of their brethren.\n\n**History.**\u2014The early history of the pargana is intimately connected with the rise of Buddhism, and there are in the neighbourhood of Sahet Mahet many Buddhist remains of great interest. The village of Tandwa, nine miles west of Sahet Mahet, is identified by General Cunningham as the Tu-wei of Fa Hian and Hwen Thsang, where Kasyapa Buddha was born and lies buried; while a statue of the mother of Sakya Buddha is worshipped now in the village as Sita. The place, like all these ancient remains in this district (see Charda), is said to have belonged to Raja Sohildeo of Asokhpur, who was the chief opponent of Sayyad Salar Masaud. It is not till the reign of Firoz Shah Tughlaq that we get any further glimpses into the history of the pargana. Up to that period this part of the country is said to have been under the sway of a tribe of the carpenter caste, who, after holding for two hundred years, took to a lawless way of living, committing dacoity on their neighbours and on one another. Firoz Shah, soon after accession, in 1350 A.D., passed by way of Gorakhpur and Khurasa (Khorsassur in Gonda) to the conquest of Bengal, and it was doubtless then, or at the later date, when he visited Bahraich itself in the year 1374 A.D., that Risaldar Bariar Sah, Janwar, the first lord of Ikauna, obtained his grant, on condition of putting down these marauders and keeping the\nountry in order. Bari\u00e1r S\u00e1h was the youngest son of Narsinghdeo, who lived in Pawargarh in the fort of Bomgarh near Nimach, and had taken service with the Delhi emperor. Tradition says little about either the il\u00e1qa or the family until the time of Mah\u00e1 Singh, ninth in descent, in whose time (in the year 1635 A.D.) the title and pay of a ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r were lost to the family, though Shah Jah\u00e1n confirmed the then holder in his proprietary right in the il\u00e1qa. At that time the estates were almost conterminous with the present pargana, though the Sultan's farm\u00e1n entitled the grantee to a percentage on the revenue of several other parganas. The trans-R\u00e1pti portion of the estate seems to have been acquired by the Ikauna taluqdar subsequent to the reign of Bahlool Lodi; for, in the year 1483 A.D., pargana D\u00e1ngd\u00fan, of which it was a portion, consisting of 192 villages, was held by a hill r\u00e1ja called Udatt Singh; whereas in 1667 A.D. the hill chiefs of Ph\u00e1labang and J\u00famli possessed only 78 villages in this part. The Ikauna house had previously, viz., about the year 1566 A.D., thrown off a branch, that of Balr\u00e1mpur; and in Mah\u00e1 Singh's time the Gujiganj and Jagann\u00e1thpur estates were occupied by cadets of this same family. Chain Singh, eleventh in descent from Bari\u00e1r S\u00e1h, obtained another farm\u00e1n from Delhi to the same effect as that of Mah\u00e1 Singh in 1716 A.D., and it was in his time that his brother Part\u00e1b Singh set up for himself in the Gangwal il\u00e1qa, which marched with that of the Gonda r\u00e1ja, and was consequently difficult to hold. From this time until 1816 A.D., the whole estate was under quasi-direct management, a tahsildar residing on it to protect the Government interests. Two generations after Chain Singh came Abdh\u00fat Singh, in whose person the curse of madness first came upon the family; Bijai Singh, the sixteenth in descent, and his son, L\u00e1l Bah\u00e1dur Singh, both being afflicted in this way. It was three years only prior to annexation that K\u00e1it Parg\u00e1sh Singh succeeded to the estates, the whole of which he has lost for complicity in rebellion. The Gangwal r\u00e1j was founded by Part\u00e1b Singh, as related above. For two generations the contests with the Gonda r\u00e1ja for this border estate, called the Dobaha and Manikapur il\u00e1qas, were continuous. Part\u00e1b Singh was killed in one of these fights, but his son Jaswant managed to hold his own well up to 1769 A.D. Kishan Parsh\u00e1d, his grandson, however, who succeeded, held only 12 or 15 villages, the remainder of the estates being held kh\u00e1m by the n\u00e1zim up to 1816 A.D., in which year all the original estates held by Part\u00e1b Singh were restored to the taluqdar, who thereafter held undisturbed possession. Like all the great estates in this district, the il\u00e1qa grew greater still during the forty years immediately preceding annexation, but a Nemesis was coming in the shape of the tyrant Raghubar Day\u00e1l, n\u00e1zim, who completely devastated the country side in 1846-47 A.D. A curse of childlessness is said to have descended on the family since Kishan Parsh\u00e1d Singh killed Himmat Singh, the first taluqdar of Pi\u00e1gpur. The present taluqdar is nephew of Kishan Parsh\u00e1d Singh, and has himself no son to succeed him.\n\nIKAUNA*\u2014Pargana IKAUNA\u2014Tahsil BAHR\u00c1ICH\u2014District BAHR\u00c1ICH (latitude 27\u00b0 33' 11\" north, longitude 81\u00b0 59' 38\" east).\u2014Is twenty-two miles almost due east of Bahraich, on the road from that place to Balr\u00e1mpur.\n\n* By Mr. H. S. Boys, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nIt is approached from the west through a tract of scrub jungle, a belt of which runs through this part of the district. The place has always been the headquarters of the Ikauna rajas, whose ancestor Bariar Sah, Janwar, a risaldar in the service of Firoz Tughlaq in 1374 A.D., was one of the first pioneers of the Rajput colonization of Oudh. It was one of his descendants, Ram Sah, who built the angleless fort, which still exists, and which, according to the country folk, gave to the place the name of Ikauna (Akona). A much more likely and far more interesting derivation, however, is to be found in Arkhavana, the name of a place mentioned by Huen Thsang as being situated slightly to the west of Sahet Mahet. Formerly the place was called Kh\u00e1npur Mah\u00e1da, after one Kh\u00e1nu, a Bhar, who, about 600 years ago, is said to have founded the village. The estate of Ikauna was confiscated in 1858 A.D. for the rebellion of its owner, and conferred partly on the raja of Balr\u00e1mpur and partly on the raja of Kap\u00farthala. The population consists of 1,852 inhabitants, of whom 350 are Musalmans. There are 443 houses, of which ten only are of brick. Two Hindu temples, three mosques, a school, and police station are the only quasi-public buildings. The English town school is supported partly by the Government and partly by the raja of Kap\u00farthala. It has three masters with 50 boys. The police force consists of 12 constables with three officers. The raja of Kap\u00farthala has a tahsil in the fort. There is no trade of any importance beyond grain, which in times of dearth comes from the N\u00e1npara direction and passes eastward towards Balr\u00e1mpur. There are second class district roads hence to Bhinga and Pi\u00e1gpur. About five miles distant lies the city of Sahet Mahet.\n\nIKHTIY\u00c1RPUR Town\u2014Pargana RAE BARELI\u2014Tahsil RAE BARELI\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This large town lies close to Rae Bareli, in latitude 26\u00b0 14' north, and longitude 81\u00b0 17' east. It was founded by Nawab Jah\u00e1n Kh\u00e1n, Subahdar, who called the town, which he surrounded by a wall, Jah\u00e1nabad, and the cultivated land Ikhtiy\u00e1rpur. By boundary arrangements Jah\u00e1nabad has been now included in Ikhtiy\u00e1rpur. Formerly for this latter village there was no cultivated land Ikhtiy\u00e1rpur has, independently of Rae Bareli, a population of over 5,000 souls,\u2014Hindus 2,653 and Musalmans 2,349. There are 518 houses,\u2014masonry 82 and mud-built 496.\n\nA palace, called the Rangmahal, and a mausoleum are the only noteworthy buildings. After the re-occupation of the province, Ganga Sah\u00e1o built a masonry ganj and named it Capperganj, after the name of the deputy commissioner, Mr. Capper. R\u00e1ja Dighbijai Singh, taluqdar of Murarmau, built a masonry sar\u00e1\u00e9, which is named after him \"Sar\u00e1\u00e9 Dighbijai Singh.\" Jah\u00e1nabad is famous for garba cloth and bar\u00e1 (a kind of sweetmeat); the latter is a speciality of the place.\n\nINHAUNA Pargana\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by parganas Haidargarh and Subeha of the Bara Banki district; on the east by Jagd\u00edspur of Sultanpur; on the west by Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n; and on the south by Simrauta and Mohanganj of Rae Bareli. Its area is 100 square miles, and its population 57,519, being at the rate of 575 per square mile.\nOf the soil 27,949 acres are cultivated, 16,717 acres fit for cultivation, and 16,146 acres barren. The tenure is for the most part zamindari, there being 19 taluqdari villages and 58 zamindari. The Government revenue is Rs. 67,975, falling at the rate of Re. 1-8-4 per arable acre. The land is thus divided:\n\n| Talukdarli | Zamindari |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Bais       | ...       | ... 7   | ... 30 |\n| Bharsi\u00e1n   | ...       | ... 11  | ... 13 |\n| Brahmins   | ...       | ... 0   | ... 7  |\n| Other castes | ...     | ... 1   | ... 8  |\n| **Total**  | ... 19    | ... 58  | = 77   |\n\nThe antiquities of the pargana are involved in much obscurity. It, along with Subeha, constituted the ancient district of G\u00e1ndeo. It is related that R\u00e1ja Arjun when on his journey to Gorakhpur left his dhanuk or bow here, hence the district is called G\u00e1ndeo; and the descendants of Bin\u00e1r S\u00e1h, the Bais conqueror and settler of the country, called themselves G\u00e1ndeoha.\n\nThe Bhars held the country, and the ruins of their old fort in the village of Majihta are still to be seen. Q\u00e1zi Badr-ud-d\u00edn, an officer of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, is said to have defeated the Bhars and occupied this fort. It is said that his followers cut down many forests for fuel, and therefore called the place \u201cIndhang\u00e1on,\u201d now altered to Inhauna; but this derivation is obviously absurd. The Musalmans seem to have made little progress, and at last Bin\u00e1r S\u00e1h, Bais, came from G\u00e1hu-munj in the west and drove out the Dhobis and Bhars, who were exercising authority. Bin\u00e1r S\u00e1h acquired the whole country, then containing 360 villages; his estate was divided among his six sons\u2014R\u00e1ja R\u00e1wat, Gh\u00e1su R\u00e1wat, Munnu R\u00e1wat, Huraj R\u00e1wat, Dharmu R\u00e1wat, Akbar R\u00e1wat. One of Gh\u00e1su\u2019s descendants founded S\u00e1tanpur, and from him descended a branch which turned Musalman, and is called Bharsi\u00e1n.\n\nThis clan of Bais is very interesting, and their connexion with the Tilokchandi Bais deserves to be studied; the present owner and Chaudhri of Inhauna is the descendant in the twenty-third generation of the Q\u00e1zi already mentioned as the conqueror of the country. There ought to be some means of ascertaining here the truth about R\u00e1wats, Kath Bais, Bhars, all of whom are declared by some to be identical. It will be noted that these Bais themselves claim a western origin, and are probably therefore not indigenous.\n\n**INHAUNA\u2014Pargana INHAUNA\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RAEBARELI.**\u2014Inhauna is situated on the Lucknow and Sultanpur unmetalled road, about midway between that city and Sultanpur. It was founded about eight or nine centuries ago, by whom is not known. Inhauna gave its name to one of the muh\u00e1ls of the old Oudh Sark\u00e1r, and was the headquarters of a tahsil until the re-arrangement of districts in 1869. Up to the same time it contained a police station also. It has a bazar (Ratanganj), founded by Ratan Nar\u00e1in tahsildar in 1863. Its traffic has considerably diminished since the removal of the tahsil and police station. There are nearly one thousand houses in the town, but not one of them is built of\nbrick. The only masonry building in the place is a small temple built about ten years ago.\n\nPopulation 8,974. Latitude 26\u00b032' north; longitude 81\u00b032' east.\n\n**IS\u00c1NAGAR\u2014Pargana FIROZABAD\u2014Tahsil NIGH\u00c1SAN\u2014District KHERI.**\n\nA large village situated at a distance of about four miles to the west of the Kauri\u015b\u0101la, having groves of mango trees on all sides. The soil is light, but fertile. Isanagar has a market in which articles of country consumption are sold. The average annual sale of cotton fabrics is estimated at Rs. 1,000. It is the headquarters of the Is\u00e1nagar estate, which belongs to Ranj\u00edt Singh, taluqdar.\n\n**Population 2,216.**\n\n| Hindus | Male | ... | ... | 947 } 1,840. |\n|--------|------|-----|-----|-------------|\n|        | Female | ... | ... | 894 }       |\n| Muhammadians | Male | ... | ... | 191 } 376. |\n|        | Female | ... | ... | 185 }       |\n\n**ISAULI Pargana\u2014Tahsil MUS\u00c1FIRKHANA\u2014District SULTANPUR\u2014This pargana, which forms the north-eastern portion of the tahsil, is bounded on the north by parganas Pachhimr\u00e1th and Khand\u00e1nsa of district Fyzabad; on the south by parganas Amethi and Sultanpur; on the east by pargana Sultanpur Barauusa; and on the west by pargana Jagd\u00edspur. Being situated on the north side of the Gumti, it was formerly included in the district of Fyzabad, but has lately been transferred to Sultanpur after material changes.**\n\nIt contains 94,235 acres, or 147 square miles of area, divided among 184 mauzas; the cultivated soil amounts to 49,609 acres, the arable to 10,215, the grove land to 11,133, the barren land to 23,278. Of the cultivated area the irrigated portion amounts to 29,324, and the unirrigated to 20,285. About a fourth of the land of this pargana is much cut up by ravines. The soil is of the well known species\u2014loam, clay, and sandy. The average depth at which water is found is 45 feet. The Government demand amounts to Rs. 1,02,377-7-2, the incidence per acre is Re. 1-4-2. The population amounts to 96,126, Hindus being 83,518 and Musalmans 12,608.\n\n**River.\u2014**The Gumti passes along the southern border of this pargana, flowing towards the east to the headquarters town of the district. Its length within the limits of this pargana is 12 miles. The villages near the bank are liable to damage by inundations.\n\nTraffic is carried on to a limited extent in grain, cloth, and other country produce via the Rae Bareli road, which passes through Amgh\u00e1t and pargana Jagd\u00edspur to Fyzabad. Some grain also passes down the river to the Jaunpur district. Schools have been established at Dorayya, N\u00e1ra, Hali\u00e1pur, Isauli, Muhammadpur Q\u00e1zi, D\u00e1dra, Bhinauli, Pid\u00e1ra, Dh\u00ed. The following are the fairs held within the pargana,\u2014at Pind\u00e1ra on the Shivr\u00e1ttri; at Kotwa in K\u00e1rtilk and Chait for bathing in the Gumti; at D\u00e1dra in Ku\u0144\u00e1r on the day of the R\u00e1m\u00edlila. There is no town in the pargana; the chief place (Isauli) is of little importance, having a population of only 2,292.\n\n**History.\u2014**The origin of the name of Isauli is attributed to R\u00e1ja Is, of the Bhar tribe. About 550 years ago Sult\u00e1n Ala-ud-d\u00edn Khilji\ncommissioned certain Bais Chhattris to drive out the Bhars, and on their succeeding in their attempt, the king gave them the title of Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1n, which name they still retain. The only antiquity in Isauli is the ruins of an ancient Bhar fort.\n\n**ISL\u00c1MABAD BIJHAULI\u2014Pargana B\u00c1NGARMAU\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO.**\u2014This village lies in pargana B\u00e1ngarmau, tahsil Safipur, about 20 miles from the tahsil, and 27 from the sadr station (Unao), in a north-westerly direction. The Kaly\u00e1ni runs about one mile to the north of it. The date of its foundation cannot be exactly traced, but it was occupied about 800 years ago by R\u00e1ja S\u00edta of R\u00e1m Kot. Afterwards Isl\u00e1m Husen Khan, the general of the imperial troops at Delhi, took possession of it, and called it Isl\u00e1mabad Bijhauli. The soil is mostly clay. The village is situated on level ground, and has jungle one mile to the north. The climate is good and the water sweet. There is neither sar\u00e1\u00e9, th\u00e1na, nor tahsil here. A school for Urdu and Persian has been established by Government. There is no bazar, but there are three fairs annually\u2014one in March in honour of Debi, one in October, and the third in September in honour of Krishna\u2019s birth. Each fair is attended by about 400 persons. Nothing but the usual village wares are manufactured here. There are 454 mud-built houses.\n\nThe population is 2,495, of whom 2,351 are Hindus and 144 Molems.\n\n**IT\u00c1URA BUZURG\u2014Pargana SALON\u2014Tahsil SALON\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELL.**\u2014This village, which was founded by the Bhars, is seventeen miles from Rae Bareli south-east, and forty from Partabgarh. The road from M\u00e1nikpur to Rae Bareli passes through it. There was a great fight here between the R\u00e1ja of Tiloi and R\u00e1e Jagann\u00e1th Bakhsh in 1245 Hijri. The latter won and retained possession of the village. There is a Government school here.\n\n**JAGDISPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil MUS\u00c1FIRKHANA\u2014District SULTANPUR.**\u2014This pargana forms the north-western portion of the tahsil; it has undergone various changes by the re-arrangement of parganas in 1869. Its area is 99,086 acres, or 155 square miles, divided among 166 mauzas. The cultivated land amounts to 50,948, the culturable to 19,163, the grove land to 8,848, and the barren to 20,127 acres. Of the cultivated area 33,595 acres are irrigated and 17,353 acres unirrigated. Three-fourths of the land of this pargana is level, and a fourth only consists of broken uneven ground. The average depth at which water is found is 45 feet. The Government demand amounts to Rs. 72,091-11-4, the incidence per acre being Re. 1-2-4. The population amounts to 102,183 souls, divided among 79,956 Hindus and 22,227 Musalmans.\n\n**River.**\u2014The river Gumti, flowing from the west past this pargana, takes an easterly course through pargana Isauli towards the chief town of the district. It often injures the villages on its banks when in flood.\n\nThere is some trade in grain, cloth, and other country produce, which is carried on chiefly by means of the Rae Bareli and Fyzabad road, but the river route is also to some extent utilized. Schools have been established at eleven villages. The post-offices are at Nih\u00e1lgarh and bazar Sukul.\nregistration office is kept at Gul\u00e1bganj. The only fair in this pargana is that held in celebration of the R\u00e1mflila at Nih\u00e1lgarh.\n\nThe chief places in the pargana are:\n\n| Place          | Population |\n|----------------|------------|\n| Nih\u00e1lgarh      | 2,580      |\n| S\u00e1than         | 2,187      |\n| Kishni         | 2,412      |\n\nThey do not rank as towns, though they are ancient ones.\n\nThe origin of the name Jagd\u00edspur is attributed to one Jagd\u00ed, a Brahman zamindar during the Bhar supremacy. There were, it is alleged, two parganas, viz., S\u00e1than and Kishni, existing under the Bhars; but on their extirpation by the Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1ns, Nih\u00e1l Khan, a member of the latter race, amalgamated the parganas and transferred the headquarters to Jagd\u00edspur, building a fort there, named after himself Nih\u00e1lgarh, and driving out the Mandrik Chhattis, who were in possession of Kishni. The pargana has since then borne the name of Jagd\u00edspur. Of remains of antiquity there are the ruins of three forts\u2014one at Nih\u00e1lgarh, built in the time of the kings, and two others at Kishni and S\u00e1than, which are attributed to the Bhars.\n\n**JAGD\u00cdSPUR\u2014Pargana JAGD\u00cdSPUR\u2014Tahsil MUS\u00c1FIRKHANA\u2014District SULTANPUR.\u2014Jagd\u00edspur, Chak Jangla, Nih\u00e1lgarh.** The three names here given are now used synonymously; but Jagd\u00edspur is the original village, Chak Jangla is one of its component hamlets, and Nih\u00e1lgarh a fort erected in Chak Jangla by Nih\u00e1l Khan, a Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1n chief, in the year 1715. Nih\u00e1lgarh was besieged and taken in 1750 by Mirza Lat\u00edf Beg, tah-sildar, who took up his residence in it, and transferred to it the headquarters of the old Kishni and S\u00e1thampur pargana. A small town as usual sprang up beneath it, which, though itself of little importance, has thrown into the shade the older village of Jagd\u00edspur. It is no longer the seat of a revenue official, and the only public buildings in it are a school and a police station. Of its 562 houses there is one only of masonry, which belongs to the principal inhabitant, B\u00e1lmukand, a wealthy mah\u00e9jan, and proprietor also of a small estate acquired very recently by purchase and mortgage. A small bazar attracts the custom of the immediate neighbourhood.\n\nPopulation 2,593.

No other road passes through or near it. It lies on the right bank of the Kew\u00e1n\u00ed river, which is navigable, though in some parts in the dry season it has only a few inches of water. The population numbers 2,640, who are of all castes, the Musalmans being principally Jul\u00e1has, or weavers of the coarse country cloth. There are no masonry houses in it, the mud-built ones are 448. There is one mosque only. In the Government school 35 boys are taught the ordinary elements of instruction.\n\nTwice a week a good bazar is held, at which the sales usually amounted to Rs. 31,000. The present proprietor is the Mahmudabad taluqdar, whose grandfather first acquired it by mortgage, it is alleged, seventy years ago,\nfrom the then proprietors, who were Ahban Chhattris, and whose descendants are still in the enjoyment of considerable zamindari rights in subordination to him. It is a healthy place, the soil is good, and the camping ground is all that can be desired, well shaded, and overlooking a river.\n\nJ\u00c1IS ROKHA Pargana*\u2014Tahsil SALON.\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Mohanganj, on the east by Amethi, on the south by Parsh\u00e1depur and Ateha, and on the west by Rae Bareli. The surface of the pargana is level; the soil on the south-west is very fertile; on the east and north there are extensive \u00fasar plains, with low-lying lands of much extent annually under water. The lands surrounding J\u00e1s, which is itself a singular and picturesque eminence in the middle of a dreary and barren neighbourhood, are the richest in the whole district, and yield rents for opium and poppy reaching so high as Rs. 16 and 18 per bigha. No river runs through this pargana, but the Sai forms its southern boundary.\n\nThe area amounts to 154 square miles, and the population is 84,443, being at the rate of 548 per square mile. Of the soil 45,552 acres are cultivated, 13,531 are fit for cultivation, and 39,042 acres barren. The area of irrigated land is 33,913 acres, and of unirrigated 12,320 acres; the depth of wells from 30 to 60 feet. The property of the soil belongs mostly to zamindars, there being 54 taluqdari and 56 zamindari villages. The Government revenue is Rs. 1,00,727, being at the rate of Re. 1-11-0 per arable acre.\n\nThe chief taluqdars are\u2014\n\nR\u00e1ni Harbans Kunwar of Tilo\u00ed.\nB\u00e1b\u00fa Sarabj\u00edtt Singh of Tik\u00e1ri,\nSukhmangal Singh of Sh\u00e1hmau.\n\nThe tribal distribution of property is as follows:\n\n| Caste          | Villages | Acres   | Revenue |\n|----------------|----------|---------|---------|\n| Kanhpuria      | 76       | 73,797  | Rs. 76,177 |\n| Musalm\u00e1n       | 19       | 16,189  |         |\n| K\u00e1yath         | 10       | 4,901   |         |\n| Brahman        | 2        | 2,896   |         |\n| Other castes   | 3        | 1,099   |         |\n| Total          | 110      | 98,882  | Rs. 1,00,727 |\n\nThe main road is that from Rae Bareli to Sultanpur, which runs through the north of the pargana. Minor aligned roads are:\u2014J\u00e1s to Mohanganj; J\u00e1s to Salon via Nasirabad; J\u00e1s to Gokna Gh\u00e1t via Mau; Fursatganj to Nasirabad via Mau; Parsh\u00e1depur to Ateha. There is a ferry during the rains at Parsh\u00e1depur on the Sai. Cloth of very fine workmanship was formerly woven at J\u00e1s, but has fallen to almost nothing. The imports are chiefly cotton and salt from Cawnpore, the exports grain. There is an Anglo-veracular town school at J\u00e1s itself, and the vernacular village schools are at the following places:\u2014\n\nNasirabad ... ... ... Gh\u00e1tampur.\nPara Nainakar ... ... ... Rokha.\n\nThe registry office is only in J\u00e1s, and the police station is at Mau.\n\n* By Mr. G. B. Macconochie, Deputy Commissioner.\nHistory.\u2014The pargana has practically no separate history. The lands were chiefly held by the Kanhpurias and Muhammadans of Jais and Nasirabad. These latter, left in garrison at different times as the tide of Muhammadan invasion flowed over the country, gradually settled down and acquired some of the lands surrounding their headquarters. Many of the residents of these two places attained to wealth and power under the native rulers, and through them wealth flowed into their native towns; but since annexation they have fallen into decay, the service on which the residents chiefly depended having been lost to them. As regards the Kanhpurias, the reader is referred to district article Rae Bareli.\n\nJais Town\u2014Pargana Rokha Jais\u2014Tahsil Salon\u2014District Rae Bareli.\u2014This old town stands on both sides of the Sultanpur and Rae Bareli road, and is 36 miles distant from Sultanpur; the tahsil town Salon, of the Rae Bareli district, lies 16 miles south-west, and Nasirabad four miles to the west. Formerly this town was called Udianagar, and was in the possession of the Bhars.\n\nIn the time of Mahmud of Ghazni, when Sayyad Salar, whose tomb stands in Bahraich, entered this country, he sent Sayyad Imad-ud-din Khilji to subjugate Udianagar. He expelled the Bhars, and his followers took possession of it, but he was killed with many other Moslems. Since that time the Muhammadans settled themselves in Udianagar, and thenceforth it seems to have been called Jais. There are three different stories about the origin of the name. The first is that \"Jaish\" means in Persian \"camp,\" and as the Moslems encamped there, they called the place \"Jais,\" as derived from \"Jaish.\" The second is that as the Muhammadans lived in much comfort after their conquest of this place they called it \"Ja-e-aish\" (place of happiness), which has been corrupted into \"Jais.\" The third is that when the Muhammadans visited this place, which was fertile and pleasant, they in Persian exclaimed \"Jaest\" (\"this is a place!\")\n\nThe town is beautifully situated among mango groves. The neighbourhood is remarkably pleasing and verdant, but the water in some wells is brackish. The rising ground on which the houses are built covers the remains of Bhar forts. This town was the station of a tahsildar during the Nawabi, and also till June, 1869, A.D., under the British Government.\n\nAmong famous men of this town were Malik Muhammad \"Jaisi,\" who compiled the Padmawat, a Bhakha book, during the reign of Sher Shah. He was a disciple of Sayyad Mukhdum Ashraf Jahangir. Khwaja Sultan of this town was the minister of Ibrahim Shah of Jaunpur; and though his own immediate descendants are extinct, his nephew's descendant, Abdul Ghafir, lambardar of Shekhuna, is still here. Sheikh Abdul Karim of this town was Subahdar of the Deccan, and his descendants, Abdul and Farrukhfal, are still here. Sayyad Abdul Qadir and Azmat-ulla, descendants of Sayyad Najm-ud-din (who was appointed to attend Imam-ud-din Khilji in his expedition on Jais), were very famous men of this town; the former was the tutor of Bahadur Shah, the son of Aurangzeb Alamgir, and the latter the Sadr-us-sadur during the reign of Muhammad Shah, Maulvi Wasil.\nAli Khan of this town was the Q\u00fazi-ul-quzz\u00e1t in Allahabad. His descendants now live near Mirzapur.\n\nOf old architectural remains there is a large mosque, the J\u00e1ma Masjid, crowning the hill. It is narrated that at this place there stood a Bhar temple which, on their being expelled, was destroyed, and this mosque erected on its site. Some sepulchres are found in the town eight or nine yards in length; they are attributed to the followers of Im\u00e1d-ud-d\u00edn Khilji who were slain here. Amongst these tombs there is one of Qutb-ud-d\u00edn, called \"Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Gh\u00e1zi,\" nine yards in length. Below the town stands also the tomb of Im\u00e1d-ud-d\u00edn Khilji. There is also the darg\u00e1h of Sayyad Mukhd\u00fam Ashraf Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, whose tomb stands in Kachhauchha. It is said that this Sayyad Mukhd\u00fam Ashraf Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr was a king of Saimn\u00e1n, who left his kingdom, turned dervish, and shut himself up in a cell for 40 days (chilla kh\u00edncha th\u00e1) at this place.\n\nA fair is held here annually in February, to which men supposed to be possessed of demons or evil spirits are brought.\n\nAccording to the census of 1869 the population amounts to 11,317, of whom 5,258 are males; the females are 6,059. It is singular that no Chhatti is to be found in this place. Shekhs predominate.\n\nThere are 508 brick-built houses and 2,471 mud-built huts. There is no Hindu temple. There is one temple of P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th, erected by Jaskarand\u00e1s of the Jain religion. There are two large mosques and one im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra: one of these mosques was built in 1244 A.H. by Ghul\u00e1m Raza at the cost of Rs. 15,000, and the other, the J\u00e1ma Masjid, was erected when the Muhammadans got possession of the place. The Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra was erected by S\u00e1diq Ali Shah, Kum\u00e9d\u00e1n in 1211 A.H. at the cost of Rs. 12,500. This is a handsome building, ornamented with texts of the Koran, which are engraved all over the roof and walls in large letters. There is a Government school here in which English and Urdu are taught. Formerly salt was extracted here, and saltpetre is still manufactured. Two years ago a mud-built sar\u00e1e was erected by Abdul Ghaf\u00far, lambardar of Muhalla Shekh\u00e1na.\n\nThere are three markets here\u2014one called the pur\u00e1na-bazar, the other built by Munshi Ghul\u00e1m Hasan, sarishtad\u00e1r of the Resident, in Lucknow in 1234, and the third erected by Abdul Ghaf\u00far, lambardar of Shekh\u00e1na. The principal articles offered for sale are corn, vegetables, gur, g\u00e1rha cloth and muslin manufactured in J\u00e1sis, and also some English cloths. The only export from this town is the cloth woven in it. The annual sales in this town are as follows:\n\n| Quantity | Rate per md. | Value |\n|----------|--------------|-------|\n| Corn     | 30,000       | Rs. 2 | Rs. 60,000 |\n| Sugar and gur | 200 | Various | Rs. 1,463 |\n| Salt     | 400          | Rs. 5 | Rs. 2,000 |\n| Cotton   | 500          | Rs. 20| Rs. 10,000 |\n| English cloth | ... | ... | Rs. 7,000 |\n\nTotal: Rs. 80,463\nIt is supposed that the muslin and other country cloths annually manufactured in this town are of the value of Rs. 12,000, of which one-third is sold in Jais, and the remaining two-thirds are taken by the Julahas of Jais to other districts.\n\nLatitude 28\u00b0 18' north; longitude 15\u00b0 36' east.\n\nJAISAR\u2014Pargana JHALOTAR AJGAIN\u2014Tahsil MOHAN\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Is ten miles south of Mohan, and the same distance north-east from the sadr station Unao. It is crossed by an unmetalled road from Ajgain to Rasulabad on the north-east corner. About 500 years ago there was a village here called Dakauli, which was the zamindari of the Khole Thakurs. Jai Singh, a Dikhit Thakur of Chamrauli, rose against the Thakurs of Dakauli, all of whom he put to the sword, and laid waste the village. Afterwards he re-peopled it, and called it Jaisar after his own name.\n\nThe soil is clay and sand mixed. The climate is healthy, and the water good. One Basawan Singh, Kayath, who was a tahsildar, erected a Shiwala and a Thakurdwara, which both exist to the present time. Nothing remarkable is manufactured here. The population is as follows:\n\n| Hindus | Musalmans | Total |\n|--------|-----------|-------|\n| Brahmins | ... | ... | 279 | 38 | 1,682 |\n| Thakurs | ... | ... | 227 | ... | ... |\n| Other castes | ... | ... | 1,358 | ... | ... |\n\nThere are 337 mud-built houses and 3 temples (two shiwalas and one thakurdwara).\n\nJAJAMAU\u2014Pargana FATEHPUR\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Jajamau lies 22 miles north-west of Unao, and one mile north of the Ganges.

H. Harrington, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nbut it had fallen into ruins. Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn Ans\u00e1ri founded the village of Jal\u00e1lpur near the old town of Dehi, which still exists, together with three villages connected with it, and consequently both in one are called \"Jal\u00e1lpur Dehi.\" The date of the foundation of Dehi is not known, but it appears from the tombs of S\u00e1idan Shah and Bhilaul, the martyrs of Masa\u00fad's army, that the village has been existing for more than 800 years ago. Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn obtained this village as a gift from Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi of Jaunpur, and having founded Jal\u00e1lpur fixed his abode there.\n\nThe soil is chiefly loam, the surface is level, and the village abounds with groves. The climate is good.\n\nThe total population amounts to 1,963, of which 744 are Musalmans of the Sunni sect, with the exception of one or two Shias and 1,219 Hindus. Of the higher castes there are 83 Brahmans, 83 Th\u00e1kurs, and 101 K\u00e1yaths. There are tombs of the martyrs of Masa\u00fad's army, mosques, and masonry wells in this village. There are 8 masonry-built houses and 354 mud-built ones. There is a Government school here in which boys are taught Urdu, Persian, and N\u00e1gri. The market of Fazlga\u00f1j, founded by Shekh Fazl Ali, the attendant of the n\u00e1zim, R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh, stands about a quarter of a mile from this village. The market is held here on Mondays and Thursdays. The total annual sale amounts to Rs. 290.\n\nLatitude 26\u00b02' north; longitude 81\u00b062' east.\n\nJAL\u00c1LPUR NAHVI\u2014Pargana SURHARPUR\u2014Tahsil T\u00c1NDA\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This town is pleasantly situated on the bank of the Tons, fifty-two miles from Fyzabad. The river here has a very winding channel between high and precipitous banks; there is jungle on the bluffs in the neighbourhood, and in places this comes down to the river's edge. Great numbers of palm trees shoot up above the underwood, and give an oriental picturesqueness to the little city.\n\nThe population is 6,200, of whom 4,014 are Musalmans, all Sunnis, and the rest are Hindus. There are a great number of weavers in this town, who are called Jul\u00e1has, and the trade is still flourishing. There are 1,530 houses, all with mud walls. There are three temples, one mosque, and a flourishing Government school. Near this town is the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra Panch\u00e1iti (or subscription church of the weavers), which was built nearly a century ago under the supervision of Y\u00e1r Mu\u1e25ammad, weaver. Four thousand rupees were raised for this purpose by the fraternity, each man subscribing the fourth of a pice from the price of each piece of cloth he wore. When the king of Oudh heard of their liberality and piety he passed high encomiums upon both, and ordered them to continue the subscription, only the results were to be paid to himself as a perpetual tribute.\n\nJAL\u00c1LUDDINNAGAR\u2014Pargana HAWELI OUDH\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014The village stands on the banks of the Gogra, on the road from Fyzabad to Akbarpur, also on the railway; its old name is P\u00fara, and it received the above name from the Emperor Akbar.

After a tortuous course it enters the Sitapur district at about thirty miles from its source in latitude 27\u00b0 46', longitude 80\u00b0 46.' Proceeding to the south-east for about eight miles it turns to the north-west and after a course of about 41 miles from its source unites with the Sar\u00e1yan on the left side of the latter, in latitude 27\u00b0 32', longitude 80\u00b0 47'.\n\n**JANAURA\u2014Pargana HAWELI OUDH\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.**\u2014This town was founded by R\u00e1ja Janakj\u00ed, who is alleged to have bought the land from R\u00e1ja Bh\u00e1rath and called it Jankura, now corrupted into Janaura after his name. The metalled road from Fyzabad to Sultanpur passes through it. It adjoins the town of Ajodhya. The population consists of 1,852 Hindus and 279 Musalmans, of whom 39 are Wah\u00e1b\u00eds. There is one masonry temple to Mah\u00e1deo. R\u00e1ja Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt is said to have re-founded this village.

Approached from the north through numerous mango groves, it lies hidden from sight, and, owing to the lowness of the situation, the town and adjacent country is unhealthy. In 1340 A.D. this place was held by one Chhatars\u00e1l, a Bhar r\u00e1ja, and was then called Jarauli; but this prince was overborne by Sayyad Zikria, son of Jam\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, who had obtained from the Delhi sovereign, Ghay\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn, a grant of 15,000 bighas in this part of the country, and who was the ancestor of the family of Sayyads who to the present day have their headquarters\n\n* By Mr. H. S. Boys, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nin this village; owing to this circumstance the population, comprising 3,328 souls, has a large proportion of Musalmans, who number 1,928. Within, however, the last fifty years the Sayyads' influence in the neighbourhood has much decreased, and a large portion of their property has fallen into the hands of their Rajput neighbours. There are 900 houses, of which six only are of brick. Two Hindu temples, four mosques, a mud sar\u00e9e, and a school are the only quasi-public buildings. The Government village school boasts of 73 boys. Markets are held on Mondays and Fridays, at which grain, cloth, and brass vessels are the sole commodities exposed for sale. No important fairs are held near this place; but at Belnap\u00e1ra, about six miles distant, and at Katka Marota, about seven miles distant, weekly gatherings of the peasantry around take place. The course of traffic lies as far as Bahr\u00e1m-pur by road, and thence a large quantity of grain goes down by boats to Simaria Gh\u00e1t; skins, ghf, &c., cross the river and go by road into Lucknow and Cawnpore. Fireworks, dyes, saltpetre, scents, and felts constitute the manufactures of the place. The last mentioned article is a speciality of Bahraich and Jarwal.\n\n**JHALOTAR AJGAIN Pargana\u2014Tahsil Moh\u00e1n\u2014District Unao.**\u2014Jhalotar Ajgain lies north of Harha pargana and south of Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s. The town of Jhalotar is 13 miles north-east from Unao. Formerly the spot was covered with small dh\u00e1k jungle and close to the present town was a lake which went by the name Kunda Samudr. It is said that a faq\u00edr, by name Musht\u00e1q Shah, dwelt in this jungle, and near to him a Cham\u00e1r having built himself a house, and having cleared some of the jungle, made a settlement of Cham\u00e1rs. The original name was Jh\u00e1li, which was converted into Jhalotar. Subsequently to this the Subahdar of Oudh built a fort and town where the Cham\u00e1r settlement had stood. This pargana was first established as such in the reign of Akbar. In 1770 Beni Bah\u00e1dur, K\u00e1yath, the minister of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, got an estate in Jhalotar 'as j\u00e1g\u00edr, which he made into a separate pargana and called Ajgain. There is now a railway station near Ajgain of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, Cawnpore branch. It only received the double name under which it is now known at the last settlement.\n\nThere is a temple to Durga Debi in Pachg\u00e1on, and another in Kusumbhi dedicated to Kusahri Debi. There are fairs at both of these places at the end of the latter half of the month of Chait (March) for two or three days; some 60,000 persons congregate. Kusumbhi has at present a railway station, and hence great facility is rendered to the people travelling from Lucknow and Cawnpore. Cloth and brass vessels, Lucknow and Cawnpore works are sold there; and every Monday a small local fair is held at these places.\n\nFormerly Lodhs and Bhars were to be found in this pargana, but since the conquest by the Muhammadans, Dikhit Th\u00e1kurs and Brahmins are met with in the greatest number. There are some few Ah\u00edrs, Lodhs, and K\u00e1yaths.\n\nTo the east, south, and west of the pargana the soil is chiefly loam and clay, and to the west chiefly sand. The pargana is 14 miles long by 12\nbroad, with an area of 62,657 acres, and comprises 103 villages. Water is to be found at 16 to 24 feet from the surface. The division of land is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidar imperfect |\n|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| ...       | ...       | ...               |\n| ...       | ...       | ...               |\n| ...       | ...       | ...               |\n\nThe land revenue amounts to Rs. 92,280, or Re. 1-7-6 per acre. There are 2,773 acres under groves. Fine blocks of kankar are to be found in different parts of this pargana, and particularly near Ajgain. The census returns give a dense population of 62,159, or 634 to the square mile. There are five bazars.\n\n**JOGIKOT\u2014Pargana BANGARMAU\u2014Tahsil SAFIPUR\u2014District UNAO.**\n\nThis is a village in pargana Bangarmau, twelve miles from the tahsil and 29 miles from the sadr station, Unao, in a north-westerly direction. The date of its foundation is not known. It was peopled by R\u00e1ja Sita, who also founded R\u00e1m Kot. In the time of Shah Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori this village was peopled anew by the Musalmans and Jogis, who are still to be found here, and from this fact the village takes its name. There are 267 mud-built huts. The total population amounts to 1,232, of whom Hindus are 736 and Moslems 496.\n\nLatitude 26\u00b058' north; longitude 80\u00b020' east.\n\n**JUGGAUR\u2014Pargana LUCKNOW\u2014Tahsil LUCKNOW\u2014District LUCKNOW.**\n\nJuggaur, a Musalman village containing some 2,693 inhabitants, is situated close to the eastern boundary of the Lucknow pargana, at about three miles to the south of the Lucknow and Fyzabad road; close to it also runs the main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway, on which there is a pick-up station known by this name (Juggaur.)\n\nThe village is well placed amongst some fine groves of trees, and contains a few good brick houses that belong to the Musalman proprietors. The total number of houses is 556. The population is chiefly agricultural, and the cultivation round the village is very fine. No trade is carried on. It is said to be very old, and to have been founded by one Jogi Jagdeo, but at the time it was taken by the Musalmans it was one of the headquarters of the Bhars. There are in the village three tombs of the men who fell in the fight against them, those of Ahmad Shah\u00edd, Q\u00e1zi Kallan, Zain-ud-d\u00edn Shah\u00edd. The Musalmans belong to the family of Qidw\u00e1i Shekhs, who trace their origin from Q\u00e1zi Qidwat-ud-d\u00edn, brother of N\u00far-ud-d\u00edn, sovereign of R\u00fam; they profess to have come into Hindustan in 580 H\u20141184 A.D., and after settling at Delhi for a time to have accepted the governorship of the province from Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn. They seem anyhow to have conquered and colonised 52 villages in this part of the country, and state that they were granted a farm\u00e1n by the Sult\u00e1na Razia J\u00e1n bestowing on them the proprietary right. Different members of this family seem to have been appointed to high posts in the service of the Emperor of Delhi, and one of the line was Shekh Zain-ul-\u00e1bid\u00edn, the taluqdar of Gadia, a Musalman gentleman well and favourably known.\n\nOf the population the Musalmans are 546 and the Hindus 1,852.\nJ\u00da-E-SHARQI\u2014Pargana Rae Bareli\u2014Tahsil Rae Bareli\u2014District Rae Bareli.\u2014The village lies nine miles from Bareli and two miles from the river Sai. The population is 3,496. It is surrounded with groves. There is a school at which 37 pupils are taught.\n\nKACHHANDAN Pargana*\u2014Tahsil Bilgram\u2014District Hardoi.\u2014A lowlying tract of thirty-four villages thrown up by the gradual westward recession of the Ganges. It lies at the south-western extremity of the Bilgram tahsil and of the Hardoi district. The Ganges flows along the whole of its western side, separating it from pargana Kanauj of Farukhabad. On the south it is bounded by pargana Bungarmau of district Unao, and on the north and east by pargana Mallanwan. Its greatest breadth is not quite eight, its greatest length nine and a half miles. Its area is 47 square miles, of which 28 are cultivated.\n\nThe whole pargana is tarai, and lies about thirty feet lower than the country to the east of it, beyond the sandy cliff that marks the eastern edge of the ancient bed of the Ganges. It is intersected by numerous small streams, of which the chief are the Kalyani, the Karua, the Bharka, the Gaha, and the Sota. This last, as its name shows, is a backwater of the Ganges. They rarely retain water long enough to be of much use for irrigation. Water is almost everywhere near the surface, in some villages only six and seven feet below it, while on the opposite side of the Ganges, the high bank, the wells are from fifty to sixty feet deep. The assistant settlement officer, Mr. C. W. McMinn, minutely examined this and the Bilgram pargana, and found that each of them divided naturally into three \"chaks\" or strips:\n\n1. The villages lying along the bank of the Ganges. The common features of these are absence of clayey soil and of irrigation, accounted for by the fact that the soil consists of river washings, and that the water-level is so near the surface that percolation from beneath supplies the place of wells and jhils.\n\n2. At a distance of from two to five miles from the river bank there runs a sandy elevation, sometimes rising into hills, sometimes mere arenaceous slopes. The villages on this are sometimes all sandy, but more generally will have a corner of very good loam beside some old river channel. The common features of this chak are a large proportion of sandy soil, limited and costly irrigation from deep wells lined with reeds, absence of Kachhis, and valuable crops.\n\n3. Beyond the above elevation the ground again sinks; jhils make their appearance; there is much clay; rice is largely raised; water is met with at a distance of from ten to twenty feet; much of the land is irrigated, and all can be at a slight expense.\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C. S., Assistant Commissioner. The name is properly Kachhandau.\nThe greater part of the pargana is liable to be flooded by the Ganges. After heavy rains the autumn (kharif) crop is ruined, but in such seasons, if the floods fall soon enough to allow of timely sowings, the spring harvest is exceptionally rich. The pargana is crossed by the unmetalled road from Mehndigh\u00e1t near Kanauj to Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and by the new road from the same ghat to Sitapur via M\u0101dhoganj. Cart-tracks lead up to the following ferries on the Ganges:\u2014Ankingh\u00e1t, near Sar\u00e1\u00e9 Rustam Khan on the Grand Trunk Road, Biri\u00e1gh\u00e1t opposite to Daipur, and R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t. The staple products are barley, occupying more than a third of the total crop area; wheat and millet, covering about a fourth; and rice and b\u00e1jra, a sixth. The remaining fourth consists mainly of gram, arhar, and sugarcane. The sugarcane is not of good quality. A very little poor indigo and cotton are raised. Tobacco and opium are scarcely planted at all. The climate is damp, and when the floods are subsiding fever is very prevalent.\n\nThe Chandels, to whom the pargana originally belonged, still hold sixteen villages. Of the other eighteen, Shekhs (converted Chandels) own eight, Brahmans five, K\u00e1yaths two, and Panw\u00e1rs, Ah\u00edrs, and Cham\u00e1rs each one. The imperfect pattidari tenure obtained in eighteen villages; fifteen are zamindari, one is taluqdari. Excluding cesses, the Government demand amounts to Rs. 33,782, and falls at Re. 1-15-5 per acre of cultivation, Re. 1-2-4 per acre of total area, Rs. 15-0-2 per plough, Rs. 2-5-4 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-10-5 per head of total population.\n\nKachhandan is sixth among the Hardoi parganas in density of population. Its total population of 20,459 gives 435 to the square mile. The Hindus are 18,120, to 2,339 Muhammadans. Of the Hindus a fourth are Cham\u00e1rs and Ah\u00edrs, Chhattris are a sixth, Mur\u00e1os and Kis\u00e1ns make up nearly another sixth, a fact which implies that the agriculture of the tract is above the average. Males to females are 11,226 to 9,223, and agriculturists to non-agriculturists 14,463 to 5,996. The only market is at R\u00e1ghopur; market day is Thursday. At R\u00e1ghopur, too, is the only school in the pargana, a village one, averaging 38 pupils. At Biri\u00e1gh\u00e1t on the Ganges a large bathing mela is held on the 30th of K\u00e1tik and the 25th of Jeth; about 15,000 persons assemble. In Chait, on the 8th day after the Holi, a mela is held at R\u00e1ghopur in honour of Ganesh; it is attended by some 4,000 persons.\n\nThe pargana is part of the \"kachh\" or moist, low-lying country along the bank of the Ganges, as opposed to the b\u00e1ngar or dry upland tract away from the river; hence its name Kachhandan. It is said to have been made into a pargana by Sher Shah three hundred and thirty years ago. To coerce the Chandels into submission, he is said to have posted a revenue collector at R\u00e1ghopur, and to have put him in charge of fifty-two villages, taken out of parganas Bilgr\u00e1m, Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and B\u00e1ngarmau. In the \u00c1\u00edn Akbari it is mentioned as belonging to Sark\u00e1r Lucknow; as containing 22,066 bighas, and paying 4,30,596 d\u00e1ms of land revenue and 4,460 d\u00e1ms of cesses. The Chandels are recorded as the zamindars. A detachment of five hundred foot soldiers was posted in the pargana.\n\nKachhandan was originally occupied by Thatheras. A body of Chandels migrated from Sh\u00edur\u00e1jpur in the Cawnpore district to Kanauj in quest\nof service while a Hindu king still reigned at Kanauj. The Kanauj r\u0101ja deputed them to cross the Ganges and drive out the Thatheras. They engaged the Thatheras at Tirwa Keoli and routed them with slaughter. To this day the braziers, Thatheras of Bhagwantnagar, speak of their lost possessions in Kachhandan and Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n. The Chandels obtained by this conquest twenty-four villages, Tirwa Keoli being the chief. When Sher Shah marched from Jaunpur to Agra, circumcising and slaying all whom he met, the Chandels of Moti\u00e1m\u0101u, Harp\u016bra, and Baraich-man apostatized and became Shekhs to preserve their rights. They marry into the families of Ahbans, Raikw\u0101rs, and Gahilw\u0101rs in B\u0101ngarmau who were converted at the same time.\n\nThe above facts show that the Ganges must have shifted westward from its old bed at least eight hundred years ago. During the last two hundred years (if the qan\u00fango is to be believed) 18 of the 52 villages which in Sher Shah\u2019s time made up the pargana of Kachhandan have been washed away by the Ganges. Their names are said to be Aminpur, Ajitpur, Ausangpur, Adampur, Bah\u00e1durpur, Bahandpur, R\u00e1mpur, R\u00fappur, Sundarpur, Sar\u00e9e Mans\u016br, Isapur, Adilpur, Fatehpur, R\u00e1mu, F\u00e1zilabad, Mitarsenpur, Muh\u00edudd\u00ednpur, Muhtashimpur, and Nekpur.\n\nKAF\u0100RA\u2014Pargana DHAURAHRA\u2014Tahsil NIGH\u0100SAN\u2014District KHERI.\u2014A village situated on the east of the river Dah\u00e1war, on the high bank of an ancient channel. The river rises near this place in a deep pond; the soil is very fertile and drainage good.\n\n| Population | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Hindus     | Male | ... | 1,271 | ... |\n|            | Female | ... | 1,072 | ... |\n| Muhammadians | Male | ... | 78 | ... |\n|            | Female | ... | 51 | ... |\n\nKAIMAHRA\u2014Pargana KHERI\u2014Tahsil LAKHIMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014Kaimahra, a large village in pargana Kheri, district Kheri, is situated on the road from Lakhimpur via Muhamdi to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and is surrounded on all sides by groves of mango trees. It lies at a distance of about 1\u00bd mile to the east of the Jamw\u0101ri. There is a large artificial tank to the east of Kaimahra, and there are four Hindu temples and ten mosques. It has four sugar manufactories, and a good market in which articles of country consumption are sold. The average annual price of the cotton fabrics is estimated at Rs. 1,000. It is the headquarters of the Kaimahra estate, and belongs to R\u00e1ja Narpat Singh. There are twenty-four masonry wells, but only one brick-built house. A vernacular school is stationed here.\n\nK\u00c1KORI Pargana*\u2014Tahsil LUCKNOW\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014K\u00e1kori is a small pargana with an area of sixty square miles, situated to the east of Lucknow. It is one of the three parganas of the Lucknow tahsil. On the north it is bounded by the pargana of Malihabad, on the east by Lucknow, on the south by Bijnaur, and on the west by Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s of Unao,\n\n* By Mr. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\nfrom which it is separated by the Nagwa nadi, sometimes also called the Loni. It contains only one great town, that of K\u00e1kori, which has a population of 8,221. The only other large villages are Amethi-Sal\u00edmpur, which has a population of 1,102, and Jali\u00e1mau-Sal\u00edmpur, with 1,284.\n\nThe population of the whole pargana is 31,729, or 530 to the square mile, but this is doubled for the cultivated area, on which it falls at the rate of 1,059. Of this population\u2014\n\n- 80\u00b76 per cent. is Hindu.\n- 19\u00b74 ditto is Muhammadan.\n- 55\u00b76 ditto is agricultural.\n- 44\u00b74 ditto is non-agricultural.\n\nIn its proportion of Muhammadans it stands highest amongst the parganas of the district.\n\nAgriculturally, this pargana is very similar to Bijnaur. It is crossed by the same \u00fasar plains, which stretch from the latter pargana through this, and extend into Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s. Thirty-eight per cent. of the pargana is thus rendered unculturable, and the amount of culturable is very low.\n\nThe average area of cultivators\u2019 holdings is about the same as in Bijnaur, being not much more than three acres per family, and the rents vary from Rs. 5-5 to Rs. 3-14, the Brahmans and Chhattris, as usual, paying the least. But this account does not include the K\u00e1chhis, who in this pargana pay Rs. 7-14 per acre, or Rs. 2-0 more than in Bijnaur.\n\nThe revenue falls at Rs. 2-4 per cultivated\u2019 acre, Re. 1-15 per m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri, which includes culturable, and Re. 1-3 on the whole area.\n\nThe amount of irrigation is fair, amounting to 44\u00bd per cent., half of which is from jhils. There are no rivers or streams running through it, but the pargana is drained by the Baita, a Malihabad stream, which bounds it on the north side, and the Nagwa, which flows along its southwest boundary. The depth at which water can be met below the surface is twenty feet, and depth of water seven feet; in this also not differing from Bijnaur. The water of a large proportion of the wells also is brackish.\n\nThe pargana was formerly of more importance. It was the thoroughfare for the traffic between Lucknow and Cawnpore, which passed along the unmetalled road that at present leads to Moh\u00e1n, and leaving this town a little to the north, crossed the Sai a few miles below Neotini, and taking a southerly direction, passed through Nawabganj in the district of Unao. This road from Lucknow was formerly embellished by spacious sar\u00e9es, ganjes, and handsome bridges and wells, built by the wealthy Lucknow officials to perpetuate their names and memories. The bridges and many of the wells remain, but the ganjes, deserted by the traffic which now passes south of it by the straighter road to Cawnpore which goes by way of the Bani bridge, lie in ruins. The first of these ganjes on the road was Sa\u00e1datganj, built by Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan in A.D. 1800; then comes Fatehganj, built by \u00c1sif-ud-daula, the fourth Nawab of Oudh, to celebrate his victory over the Ruhelas. The place is still standing, but is not used as\na bazar. The fine bridge over the Nagwa, a river which crosses the road at about twelve miles from Lucknow, was built by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Tikait R\u00e1e, finance minister of Asif-ud-daula; then came Tikaitganj, built by the same minister. It now lies in ruins. The bridge over the ravine leading into Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj and the ganj itself were built by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja B\u00e1\u00ed Kishan, and the ganj that succeeds by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Newal R\u00e1e, N\u00e1ib of Safdar Jang, the Nawab Wazir. Many other tombs or mosques adorned the roadside, but are fast falling into ruins.\n\nThe country on either side is bare of trees, and the pargana generally not well wooded, except immediately round K\u00e1kori. This last is an important town, and with the main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway running within a mile of it will probably very much increase in prosperity. The only bazar of the pargana is held here, and the annual sale of goods in it is said to amount to Rs. 32,500. The town was of old a wealthy Musalman settlement, and the abode of many learned and well-known Musalmans and faq\u00edrs, and from which, as the headquarters Musalman town, the pargana was administered. This pargana has in all sixty-five townships, and sixty-five separate muh\u00e1ls. The average area of each township is five hundred and ninety-six acres.\n\nThe history of the pargana is hard to trace. It was probably at first inhabited by the Bhars. K\u00e1korgarh, in the midst of the present town of K\u00e1kori, is said to have been an old Bhar fort. The name is Bhar. In Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi, at the eastern end of the district, is another old site of a Bhar village, called the K\u00e1koha Dih. The Bhars were probably driven out by the Rajputs, for it was one of the parganas that was included in the Baisw\u00e1ra kingdom; and the Bais R\u00e1ja S\u00e1than, either with a view to further conquest, or to keep secure this the latest of his possessions, fixed upon K\u00e1korgarh as his fort and headquarters. The history of his fall is interesting, though local, and bears a prominent part in the annals of the town. This part of the province was then under the Jaunpur dynasty, to which Government it had long belonged, and the r\u00e1ja carrying his depredations into the heart of Lucknow, a force was sent against him from Jaunpur, it is said, in the time of Muhammad, 844 Hijri (1440 A.D.), to which he succumbed, falling himself in the fight. From this time the Rajputs have disappeared from the pargana. Scattered clans hold some fifteen villages. K\u00e1kori itself fell into the hands of the leaders of the conquering expedition, and thirty-three out of the sixty-four villages of the pargana are in the hands of Musalmans. The chief Musalman families are the Q\u00e1ziz\u00e1das and Shekhs of K\u00e1kori. The tenure is entirely zamindari.\n\nThere is no trace of the first formation of K\u00e1kori into a pargana. It has been known as such since the time of Akbar, and probably comprised the extent of territory ruled over by the Bhar r\u00e1ja of K\u00e1korgarh. In the days of the Nawabi it was generally held as a muh\u00e1l by itself, but from 1249 F. (A.D. 1843) it was included in the chakla of Sandila in Hardoi.\n\nK\u00c1KORI Town\u2014Pargana K\u00c1KORI\u2014Tahsil LUCKNOW\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The town of K\u00e1kori, the headquarters town of the pargana of that\nname, lies directly west of Lucknow, at a distance of about nine miles from\nthe capital. It is situated in latitude 26\u00b0 72' and longitude 80\u00b0 67'. About\na mile to the north of it runs the road to Malihabad, which here also crosses\nthe main line of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. The town is of con-\nsiderable importance and one of the largest in the district. It contains a\npopulation of 8,220 souls, and many well-known Musalman families have\nlong resided here, different members of which have served the British and\nNative Governments with distinction during the past century. Two bi-\nweekly bazars are held at the Katra and Koth-tale ganjes, and the annual\nsales are said to amount to Rs. 32,500. The long row of shops lining the\nbazars show, that it is a place of considerable prosperity. The weaving\ntrade has, however, decayed.\n\nThe town is probably of considerable antiquity. It is said to have been\ninhabited by Bhars, whose fort was known as the K\u00e1korgarh. They were\nprobably expelled by Bais, whose r\u00e1ja S\u00e1than, father of R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand,\nfixed his headquarters at K\u00e1kori. The pargana was at the time under the\nJaunpur sovereigns, and this chief extending his depredations into the\ncity of Lucknow, a force was sent against him from Jaunpur by which he\nwas defeated and slain. The leaders of the force were made q\u00e1z\u00eds and chau-\ndhries, and the descendants of the latter still hold proprietary right of the\nvillage. The top of a house belonging to one of the latter, built on the site\nof the old fort, gives an extensive view of the surrounding country, which\nis finely wooded with large mango groves, and of the town itself.\n\nA little below the fort to the south may be seen three old tombs, one\nerected to Shah Bh\u00edkhan, a faq\u00edr of the Kabria sect and belonging to the\nMakhd\u00famz\u00e1sas of K\u00e1kori, and close by it the tombs of two of his disciples,\nSultan Gulrat of the imperial family of Delhi, and his foster brother Shams-\nud-d\u00edn. By the inscriptions on the tombs they seem to have been built in\n988 H. and 1037 H. (1580 and 1627 A.D.) Further on to the outside of\nthe town on the south-east are two other darg\u00e1s raised to Makhd\u00fam Shah,\nMuhammad K\u00e1zim, and Makhd\u00fam Shah Tur\u00e1b, Kandhar\u00eda faq\u00edrs, in whose\nmemory the annual urs festivals are celebrated, and a great fair held, at\nwhich great numbers from Lucknow and the neighbouring villages attend.\nOn the west is the mosque of Azmat-ulla, built in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n,\nto whose daughter Azmat-ulla was tutor, and who, his descendants say, also\ngave instruction to Aurangzeb himself.\n\nMany of the vak\u00edls who are practising in the Lucknow courts belong to\nMusalman families of this place, and are beautifying the town with some\nwell-built red brick houses and b\u00e1r\u00e1daris. The total number of houses\nis 1,933, of which 126 are masonry. In one of the old b\u00e1r\u00e1daris of the\nplace is established the Government school, at which the attendance of\npupils is 88. Of the population 3,636 are Musalmans and 4,831 Hindus.\n\nThe early history of K\u00e1kori is as follows, as told by Muhammad Faiz\nBakhsh Khan of this place:\u2014R\u00e1ja S\u00e1than Bais had two forts, one at Rae\nBareli, the other K\u00e1korgarh. His estates extended up to where the Akbari\nDarw\u00e1za was subsequently built. In the time of Sultan Husen Sharqi three\nSayyads, Ahmad, Ham\u00edd, and Muhammad, on their return from Mecca\nsounded the az\u00e1n on the Sai nadi near Moh\u00e1n. R\u00e1ja Sath\u00e1n's subjects, carrying out his orders that the az\u00e1n should not be sounded in his dominions, killed two of the three Sayyads. One escaped to Jaunpur. An army was sent and took this r\u00e1ja's fort at Bareli. The r\u00e1ja escaped to K\u00e1korgarh, and the king's force was prevented from pursuing him, as it was called on to fight the n\u00e1zm of Bengal. Shortly after a second complaint was urged at Jaunpur against R\u00e1ja S\u00e1than. A certain Sayyad with his wife and child had with the connivance of the r\u00e1ja's diw\u00e1n settled secretly near K\u00e1korgarh, on the high ground where the chau-dhirs' houses now stand. The Sayyad had got service among the Sihbandis of the r\u00e1ja, and while he was absent collecting rents in the month of S\u00e1wan (when the women chant the mal\u00e1r), the Sayyad's wife and daughter began to sing. On the r\u00e1ja enquiring who was singing the mal\u00e1r, and learning that there were two Muhammadan women in the place, he seized them for base purposes. Smarting with disgrace, the ladies killed themselves with a dagger. The Sayyad on hearing his misfortunes complained at Jaunpur. A second force was sent by Sultan Husen under his waz\u00edr Malik Asad-ud-d\u00edn. The waz\u00edr gave out that he had quarrelled with the king, marched towards Delhi, and issued proclamations that he and his army were ready to enter the service of any native chief who would employ them. R\u00e1ja S\u00e1than was caught in the trap. He invited the waz\u00edr to his fort at K\u00e1korgarh. Within the fort the waz\u00edr's forces turned upon the Hindus and cut off the r\u00e1ja's head.\n\nThe sultan was so pleased with the affair that he directed the waz\u00edr and his officers to remove to K\u00e1korgarh, and assigned them lands for their support. Waz\u00edr Malik Asad-ud-d\u00edn had one son, Malik M\u00e1ruf, and two daughters' sons, Malik Bah\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Kaiq\u00fabad, and Malik Nusrat-ud-din. These two are the ancestors of the Malikz\u00e1das of K\u00e1kori.\n\nK\u00c1L\u00c1K\u00c1NKAR MAHM\u00daDABAD\u2014Pargana BIH\u00c1R\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This place was founded by Muhammad Hay\u00e1t; the original name is Gularia, and it was called K\u00e1l\u00e1k\u00e1nkar because slabs of black limestone were found here. R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh built a fort here in 835 A.D. This town is on the bank of the Ganges, four miles from M\u00e1nikpur and forty-four from Bela. There is a canal from the Ganges leading water round the fort.\n\n| Population |\n|------------|\n| Hindus     | ... | ... | ... | 1,245 |\n| Musalmans  | ... | ... | ... | 172   |\n| Total      | ... | ... | ... | 1,417 |\n\nThere are two temples to Mah\u00e1deo.

On the north the Gumti separates it from pargana Aurangabad\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nin Sitapur; on the south and west it is bounded by pargana Sandila; on the east by pargana Gundwa. Twelve miles long by seven broad at its longest and broadest, it covers 63 square miles, of which 41, or 63\u00b796 per cent., are cultivated. The culturable area is 20\u00b738 per cent., and the barren area 13\u00b792 of the whole. Only a fifth of the soil (20\u00b725 per cent.) is rated as of the third class, that is, light and sandy (bh\u00far). A fifth (24\u00b798 per cent.) is watered, in the proportion of four parts (19\u00b783), from 805 ponds and tanks, and one part (5\u00b715) from 441 wells; 1\u00b779 per cent. is under groves. The average area of cultivation to each plough is 7\u00bd acres.\n\nIts natural features are in no way remarkable. Like all the country along the Gumti, its poorest side is towards the river, the land gradually improving towards the central level, and falling off again as the next river or n\u00e1la is approached. The Baita n\u00e1la drains the south-western side of the pargana: a cluster of jh\u00edls interspersed with dh\u00e1k jungle lies in the south-east. There are no made roads, but the unmetalled road from Sandila to Ben\u00edganj skirts the south-western border and runs for about a mile within it.\n\nThe staple products are wheat and barley, which occupied at survey more than two-fifths of the cultivated area; gram and arhar covered nearly another fifth; the rest was chiefly cropped with m\u00e1sh, moth, b\u00e1jra, ju\u00e1r, linseed, and kodo. The areas returned as under sugarcane, cotton, poppy, indigo, and tobacco were respectively only 320, 195, 86, 78, and 44 acres.\n\nClimate and productiveness are considered to be average.\n\nKankar is found near the village of Kaly\u00e1nmal.\n\nOf the 72 villages, 63 are owned by Sakarw\u00e1r Chhattris, one by Bais, three by K\u00e1yaths, one by Sukul Brahmans, two by Sayyads. Only six villages are taluqdari, in 29 the tenure is zamindari, in 37 imperfect pat-tidari. The Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 46,169\u2014a rise of 11 per cent. on the summary assessment. It falls at Re. 1-12-6 on the cultivated area, Re. 1-2-3 per acre of total area, Rs. 13-1-10 per plough, Rs. 3-6-8 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-13-8 per head of total population.\n\nPopulation presses at the rate of 395 to the square mile, or a total of 24,875. Hindus to Muhammadans are 23,115 to 1,760; males to females 13,277 to 11,598; agriculturists to non-agriculturists 13,511 to 11,364. Cham\u00e1rs are a fifth of the whole, Brahmans nearly a fifth, P\u00e1s\u00eds a tenth, Chhattirs are only 1,744.\n\nA village school has been established at Kaly\u00e1nmal.\n\nOn the first Sunday in Bh\u00e1don some fourteen thousand people assemble at the spot known as Hattia Haran, a mile to the south-west of Kaly\u00e1nmal. The usual dhanuk jagg mela is held at Kaly\u00e1nmal in Aghan, and is largely attended.\n\nThe pargana is not mentioned in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari. It seems to have been included in Akbar's time in pargana Rah\u00edmabad of Lucknow, and not\nto have been made into a separate pargana till the reign of Alamgir, when a fort was built at Kalyanmal and an Amil with a gun and some troops quartered there. The traditional history, as far as I have been able to collect it, is meagre. The oldest event referred to by it is the return of Ram Chandar from Ceylon. Rathaulia, the ancient name of Kalyanmal, is traced to the staying of his chariot (rath) at this spot. Here he halted and visited the sacred pool of Hattia Haran, that he might wash away the sin of slaying the demon Rawan. Another local tradition tells that the sacred tank was called panchhatr, and that he bathed in it to get rid of a hair which had grown in the palm of his hand when he slew Rawan, and that ever since the pool has been called Hattia Haran, or the Hurt-dispeller. According to Mr. Wheeler, the Ram who slew Rawan was not Ram Chandar of Ajodhya, but a later hero, Ram of the Dekhan. \"This Ram of the Dekhan is represented to have carried on a great religious war against a raja named Rawan who was sovereign of the island of Ceylon. Rawan and his subjects are termed Rakshas or demons, but there is reason to believe that they represent the Buddhist, and if so, the war could not have been carried on during the Vedic period, but during the Brahmanical revival, which seems to have commenced between the sixth and eighth centuries of the Christian era, and to have continued until our own time.\" (History of India, III., page 51, note.) In this view Ram's visit to Hattia Haran must have taken place later than 700 A.D. It was a sacred spot before he visited it, or he would not have gone there. It seems to have been one of the ancient Brahmanical hermitages described in the Ramayan, as old perhaps as Ajodhya itself.\n\nThe next glimpse by local tradition is that of a Raja Kum\u00e1r from Baiswara expelling the Thatheras and ruling over ninety-four villages from his fort at Rathauli, where now lies the deserted ruin called Wairi Dih. To him, nearly five hundred years ago, came from Fatehpur Sikri a Sakarwar Chhattri of the name of Nag Mal, and became the naib or deputy of Raja Kum\u00e1r. Some say that Nag Mal with the help of a barber murdered his master and seized his domain; others that he succeeded peaceably to it on his master dying childless. To Nag Mal was born K\u00e1kal Mal. To K\u00e1kal Mal his first wife bore Kalyan Sah and Gog Sah, and his second wife Hat Raj. Kalyan Sah and Gog Sah took as their share fifty-two villages and settled down at Rathauli, side by side, and founded the adjacent settlements of Kalyanmal and Goga Deo, while Hat Raj took the remaining forty-two villages. Two hundred years ago the Sakarwars of Goga Deo drove out the Julahas from Mahgon in the south of the pargana.\n\nThe pargana seems in primitive times to have been the border land of the Thatheras and Arakhs, for while Kalyanmal Khas was held by Thatheras till they were dislodged by Raja Kum\u00e1r Bais, the Chandels of Bhaunti, only six miles to the south-east, tell how between five and six hundred years ago their ancestor Baldeo Singh marched thither from Siwaichpur and expelled its primitive occupants, the Arakhs.\n\nThe antiquities of the pargana are the pool at Hattia Haran, Wairi Dih, the remains of Raja Kum\u00e1r's fort, Kaimgarh Dih near Kalyanmal, site of an ancient shrine of K\u00e1lka Debi; Panchabgir Mah\u00e1deo, also at Kalyan-\nmal, \"the ling\" whereof is said to have been set up by R\u00e1ja Judhistir, and the ruined fort built for Alamgr\u00ed's \u00c1mil.\n\nKAMLAPUR\u2014Pargana Bijnaur\u2014Tahsil Lucknow\u2014District Lucknow.\n\u2014A village in pargana Bijnaur with about a thousand souls, chiefly P\u00e1s\u00eds, who assert that it was their ancestor who founded Bijnaur and some other neighbouring villages where this caste once held the supremacy. They further lay claim to being R\u00e1jp\u00e1s\u00eds, as different in social position from the present P\u00e1s\u00eds or thieving caste, but there is no trace of their being of a distinct origin. The place is well wooded, the climate is said to be good, the water sweet, and the cultivation excellent. The n\u00e1la near Kaml\u00e1pur and Bijnaur has been bridged by Mudabbir-ud-daula R\u00e1ja Jw\u00e1la Parsh\u00e1d Bah\u00e1dur, a K\u00e1yath noble and member of the Lucknow Darb\u00e1r, rendering great facility to traders during the rains. There is no masonry building except a shiw\u00e1la built by the said R\u00e1ja Jw\u00e1la Parsh\u00e1d.\n\nKANDI\u00c1WAN\u2014Pargana Salon\u2014Tahsil Salon\u2014District Rae Bareli.\n\u2014This town is on the Ganges, and the road from Salon to Mustafabad passes by it. It is twenty-two miles from Rae Bareli and six from M\u00e1nikpur. The population is 3,632, of whom 68 are Musalmans.\n\nThere is one temple to Mah\u00e1deo and a school.\n\nK\u00c1NTHA\u2014Pargana Purwa\u2014Tahsil Purwa\u2014District Unao.\u2014A village nine miles from the tahsil and eighteen miles east from the sadr station. There are two unmetalled roads, one from Purwa through the village to Lucknow, the other from Nawabganj to Purwa, crossing it within the boundary of the village. One mile to the east there is a lake called Puren. About 900 years ago a Lodha named K\u00e1ntha is said to have cleared off the jungle which surrounded this place and peopled it. The name is derived from that of its founder. Numerous groves of mango and mahua trees surround it, and the dh\u00e1k jungles of Sahr\u00e1w\u00e1n and Shahabad, two villages in the neighbourhood, are two miles distant. The water of some of the wells is brackish. There were two battles here, one about two hundred years ago between Angad Singh with the Bais of M\u00e1njhig\u00e1on and Kunwar Singh, ancestor of the present holders; the other about a hundred years ago between Chet R\u00e1m Bais of M\u00e1njhig\u00e1on and Dharm Singh, an ancestor of the present possessors. In the time of the kings there was a fortress in this place where the tahsildar held his court. There is a school here, also two temples and a mosque.\n\nThere are two small fairs held here, one on the 1st Tuesday in Jeth (April-May) in honour of Mah\u00e1b\u00edr, at which about 5,000 pilgrims attend; the other the R\u00e1mlila, or theatrical representations of the exploits of R\u00e1ma, in the light half of Ku\u00e1r (September), and this brings together about two thousand people. Nothing is sold but confectionery. There are two small weekly markets.\n\n| Population | Hindus | 3,524 |\n|------------|--------|-------|\n|            | Musalmans | 210 |\n|            |          | 3,734 |\n\nAnnual sale at fairs and bazar amounts to Rs. 1,235.\nKANT\u00daR Town\u2014Pargana BADO SARAI\u2014Tahsil FATEHPUR\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014Twenty-one miles north-east of sadr, founded by Kint\u00e1ma, or Kunta, a Bhar r\u00e1n\u00ed, and was originally called Kuntapur. It is said that it was re-settled by Bikram\u00e1jit. The principal inhabitants are Musalmans, holding small rent-free grants. The houses are mostly masonry, and the town healthy and well situated on an eminence. The total population is 3,450, of which 2,136 are Hindus and 1,314 Musalmans.\n\nKASMANDI KAL\u00c1N\u2014Pargana MALIHABAD\u2014Tahsil MALIHABAD\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014This village is chiefly worthy of notice as the seat of the Hindu r\u00e1ja Kans, and his conquest by Sayyad Masa\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi, the leader of the first invasion into Oudh in 449 Hijri\u20141031 A.D. It is situated directly east of Malihabad at a distance of about four miles, and one mile from the river Gumti, which flows on its east. The extent of R\u00e1ja Kans\u2019s dominions is unknown, but it is said to have reached to Kasmandi Khurd on the north-west, and the village Kaithauli on the east. R\u00e1ja Kans was slain, and the battle must have been fierce, for outside are numerous tombs of the fallen, and two especially are pointed out as the tombs of Sayyads H\u00e1shim and Q\u00e1s\u00edm. At Kaithauli was another fight, and the village is said to owe its name to the fact. There is a small mound of fallen bricks that is to be seen there still, which is pointed out as the \u201cran-khamba,\u201d or the battle pillar. The village is Muhammadan, and the proprietor is said to be directly descended from the settlers left by Masa\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi.\n\nThe population is 1,990, of which 818 are Musalmans and 1,172 Hindus. It has been the favourite residence of Muhammadans, some of whom have been distinguished for their learning and wealth, but these are not connected with the zamindars. There are one or two good houses, but none with any pretensions to grandeur. There is a government school established, with an attendance of 50 pupils, and a girls\u2019 school is affiliated with 15 girls on its registers. One of the district post-offices has also been fixed here. It is no place of trade, but a small bazar is held here for the sale of country produce, at which the annual sales are said not to amount to more than Rs. 13,000.\n\nKASTA Pargana\u2014Tahsil MUHAMDI\u2014District KHERI.\u2014The pargana contains a total m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri area of 52,987 acres or 82\u00b779 square miles, with a population of 329 to the square mile. The detail of area is as follows:\n\n| Area Type          | Acres |\n|--------------------|-------|\n| Cultivation        | 28,236 (or 49 per cent.) |\n| Culturable         | 24,230 (\" 51 \" ) |\n| Unculturable and unassessed | 5,521 |\n\nTotal 52,987\n\nThe area, including forest grants, is 95 square miles, of which 39 are cultivated. In the unassessed area are included revenue-free holdings 608, and groves 1,317 acres. The number of adult agriculturists is 10,149 and of ploughs 3,514, being 2\u00b789 adults to each plough and 6\u00b761 acres of cultivation to each plough; 31 per cent. of the cultivated area is irrigated from all sources, but chiefly from wells and tanks. Taken as a whole the soil of the pargana is loam; a little clay is found in the lower levels.\nnear jhils, but there is scarcely any sand. South of the road which runs through the villages of Kasta and Mitauli the villages are generally well cultivated, and some highly farmed by Kurmis and others of the better classes of cultivators; to the north of the roads much of the area is under dense jungle, and on the west side, along the banks of the Kathna, are four grants, and one in the centre (Ganeshpur). Many of the villages are surrounded by the jungle of the grants and of other villages, and are represented as being very unhealthy at certain seasons, the residents being generally Ahirs, Gaddis, and other inferior classes of cultivators, who are induced to settle in them for the grazing of their cattle which these villages afford. The jungles along the Kathna harbour chital, nil-gae, hog-deer, pahra, and other smaller animals which do much mischief to the crops at night, so that precarious crops are raised only by incessant watching. The pargana comprises 73 villages, regularly demarcated, of which five are jungle grants and the remaining sixty-eight held as follows:\n\nBy taluqdars ... ... 62\n\" independent proprietors 4\n\" Government ... ... 2\n\nBut separate assessments have been made in sixty-nine villages. Out of the four non-taluqdari villages three have been released as revenue-free grants. Kasta itself is an ordinary sized village, much decayed and deserted of late years. It has only 219 houses and a population of 1,165 souls, and is a place of no resort or importance. The road from Lakhimpur to Mitauli passes through the village. It has still much jungle on the west side and four outlying hamlets. The Government revenue is Rs. 37,850.\n\nKATHNA River.\u2014A small river which rises from Moti-ka-Tal in the Shahjahanpur district, latitude 28\u00b020', longitude 80\u00b021'. It flows in a south-easterly direction, and at about ten miles from its source it turns to the south, and for about two miles forms the boundary between the districts of Shahjahanpur and Kheri; it then resumes its previous south-easterly direction and enters the latter district in latitude 28\u00b028', longitude 83\u00b023'. Following the same course it flows through that district, having the parganas of Atwa Piparia, Magdapur, and Aurangabad on its right, and those of Haidarabad and Kasta on its left. Leaving Kheri it then enters the Sitapur district, and joins the Gumti on the left side of the latter in latitude 27\u00b020', longitude 80\u00b027'. Its total length of course may be estimated at about 101 miles. It is not navigable, but might be made so for small boats. Its water is unwholesome owing to the vegetation on its sides, and it is little used for irrigation owing to the height of its banks.\n\nKATIARI* Pargana\u2014Tahsil Bilgram\u2014District Hardoi.\u2014A riverine tract of eighty villages lying along the right bank of the Ramganga and left of the Ganges between Fatehgarh and Kanauj. It is enclosed between parganas Pali on the north, Barwan and Sandi on the east, Khakhatmau and Paramnagar (Farukhabad) on the west, and on the south-west and south Bhojpur and Taligram (Farukhabad) across the Ganges. Its greatest\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nlength is sixteen and breadth nine miles. The area is 90 square miles, of which 61 are cultivated, or 67.45 per cent. The culturable area is 20.96 per cent., and the barren area 10.91 of the whole. Only 8.04 per cent. is rated as third class. Not quite a sixth (15.94 per cent.) is artificially irrigated, owing to the extreme moisture of the soil. Of the irrigated area rather more than half (8.85) is watered from 1,117 wells, and rather less than half (17.09) from 352 tanks and ponds.\n\nThe grove area (68 per cent.) is exceptionally low. The average area of cultivation to each plough, 12\u00bd acres, is exceptionally high.\n\nThe natural features of the pargana explain this. Mr. Elliott's description of the adjacent parganas of Kh\u00e1khatmau and Paramnagar in Farukhabad may be quoted as equally applicable to Kati\u00e1ri:\n\n\"The trans-Gangetic tract is entirely tar\u00e1di or lowlands. No part of it is much above the level of the river-floods. Much of it is covered with water for two or three days together, when the rains are heavy and the rivers high, and this water often leaves a deposit of sand behind. Some of the land is subject to constant erosion by the rivers, and the assessment of many villages is constantly varying with the varying area, as the rivers devour or cast up the culturable land.\" After mentioning the various channels which connect the Ganges and R\u00e1mganga, Mr. Elliott says:\u2014\"Besides these channels there are several 'sotas,' i.e., backwaters or side channels which run nearly parallel to their own rivers for a short way, or curve round and run into them again. The Ganges, as becomes its great age, keeps sedately within its bed, and only rolls wearily from one side to another; but the R\u00e1mganga is a gambolling vagabond and wanders at his own sweet will over many miles of country, carving out beds capriciously for himself, and leaving them as illogically. The most important effect of this contiguity to a complicated river-system is that the water is everywhere close to the surface. Irrigation by buckets worked by bullocks is unknown. The wells are all of the kind called 'ch\u00fahas,'\u2014little pits in the ground, 8 or 10 feet deep, dug in one or two days; the sides of the well are strengthened by a 'bir,' or rope of cotton and jh\u00e1o stalks bound together, and wound round the well for a depth of three or four feet, beginning from the place where water begins to trickle. The depth of water is never more than three or four feet; it percolates slowly and is soon exhausted, and the well has constantly to be cleaned of the sand which oozes in with it. Irrigation is effected by an earthen pot worked with a weighted lever, and slow as the work of exhaustion is, there are few 'chuhas' which can be worked continuously the whole day, and the area irrigated is seldom more than two biswas. At this rate it takes about a month to irrigate an acre, and a cultivator can only water about two acres a year. These wells fall in every year and leave hardly any trace behind. They can be dug almost everywhere, but there are many tracts in which the soil is too loose to dig them without sloping the sides of the pit at a considerable angle, and very large tracts of land are so naturally moist that they hardly need them at all, except for the higher class of crops like opium. From this set of causes two classes of effects arise. Where the land is in danger of diluvion, and where it is swept over by water at high-flood times, the cultivator will not improve at all, because he is in constant danger of the land he works on\nbeing carried away, or the top-dressing of manure he lays down being washed off or covered with a coat of silt. Where the floods do not terrify him the land is highly improvable, and gives a large return to the class of men who carry out the fertile culture in its extreme development, and can busy themselves all day about a few square yards of land. Hence a large number of Kachhis have settled here, and they carry out their peculiar system of cultivation with great success, occupy very small areas, manure and water them thoroughly, and turn out really wonderful crops of opium and market vegetables which they carry for sale to Farukhabad. The other principal class of cultivators, Rajputs and Brahmins, act on the opposite principle. Having no use to make of their bullocks in irrigation, they use them to plough a larger quantity of land (the theoretical plough area being eight acres here against five acres in the b\u0101ngar or highland of the du\u0101b), manure little, irrigate little, but make up for inferior style of cultivation by a larger area of occupancy. There is no land really unculturable in this tract except the river beds; there is no \"cosar\" or land so impregnated with salt as to produce no vegetation; but there is much land extremely sandy and almost valueless, and a little in which there is saline efflorescence enough not to kill the crops and grass altogether, but to make the land very bare and poor, so that even under the stimulus of the present high prices (1870) it has remained uncultivated. Nothing is wanted for this land but water and manure.\" (Revenue Reporter, Vol., IV., No. II., p. 51.)\n\nLike these Farukhabad parganas Kati\u0101ri is intersected by streams and channels which in flood time connect the Ganges and R\u0101mganga. Its fertility is due to the nearness of the water to the surface and to the deposit of rich loam ('seo') brought down by the rivers. The deposit of the R\u0101mganga is the most fertilising. In heavy floods the deposit of 'seo' is often eight fingers thick, sometimes as much as two feet. In such seasons a bumper rabi compensates for a ruined kh\u0101rif. Very little labour is required for preparing the 'seo' to receive the seed, one-fourth only the cultivators reckon, of the average to it expended elsewhere.\n\nThe pargana abounds in a rich growth of grass of various kinds. The \"chaupatia\" springs up freely in January and February, and is much esteemed by the graziers for the quantity of milk yielded by kine pastured on it. The \"patawar\" abounds,\u2014so valuable for thatching, rope-making, and cane furniture. But the baneful \"surai\" is also very prevalent along the R\u0101mganga and Ganges, a rank deep-rooted weed most difficult to extirpate. Mr. Elliott writes of it:\u2014\"It is greatly complained of, and is said to have increased much of late. In many places there is at least as much 'surai' as wheat in the wheat fields, and its roots are so deep that it is quite beyond the power of an ordinary cultivator to extirpate it; and if he did, the next flood of the Ganges would leave fresh seeds of it in the ground. If it does really increase, it will soon be as great an enemy to the agriculturists as the 'kans' of the trans-Jumna.\"\n\nThe staple products are wheat, barley, bajra, and ju\u00e1r. At survey wheat and barley cropped nearly half the cultivated area, and bajra and ju\u00e1r nearly a third. The areas returned as under sugarcane, cotton, opium,\nindigo, and tobacco were respectively only 282, 139, 29, 8, and 29 acres. As there are 2,335 Mur\u00e1os in the pargana, either these crop returns have been wrongly made up from the khasras, or, which is more probable, the growth of the richer crops was suppressed as the survey approached, or the am\u00e1ns (surveyors) were induced to record inferior crops instead of the kachhi\u00e1na ones.\n\nThe climate is very damp, but not so unhealthy as might be expected.\n\nThere are no quarries, but kankar is found here and there. Of the eighty villages 58\u00bd are owned by Kati\u00e1r Chhattris, 12 by Sombansis, 5 by B\u00e1chhils, 2\u00bd by Bais, 1 by Gaurs, and 1 by Dube Brahmans; 19 belong to the taluqa of R\u00e1ja Sir Hardeo Bakhsh, K.C.S.I., a good man and true, of Arjunpur; in 4 the tenure is zamindari, in 57 imperfect pattidari.\n\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 58,809, a rise of 62\u00b744 per cent. on the summary assessment. It falls at the rate of Rs. 184 on the cultivated area; Re. 1-0\u00b75 per acre of total area; Rs. 18-14-6 per plough; Rs. 2-3-6 per head of agricultural, and Re. 1-10-9 per head of total population.\n\nThe incidence of population, 35,164 souls, is 391 to the square mile. Hindus to Muhammadans are 34,516 to 648; males to females 19,544 to 15,620; agriculturists to non-agriculturists 26,499 to 8,655.\n\nBrahmans 6,310 and Chhattris 5,145 predominate; next come Cham\u00e1rs 4,450 and Kah\u00e1rs 2,912; then Ah\u00edrs 2,883 and Mur\u00e1os 2,335.\n\nVillage schools have been established at Arjunpur 38, Gauria 38, Admapur 28, Berijon 45, and Khasaura 37.\n\nSmall melas are held in Bh\u00e1don at Behsar in honour of an ancient Mah\u00e1deo, and in As\u00e1rh at the \"Debi\" at Dhanamau.\n\nThe pargana is not mentioned in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, having been included in pargana S\u00e1ndi till about 55 years ago. A few Pali villages were thrown into it when constituted a separate pargana.\n\nHistorical sketch.\u2014The traditional history of the pargana presents few features of interest. It shows in the background the usual Thathera occupation. The dh\u00e1s or deserted sites of their forts and villages are to be seen at Shi\u00e1mpur, Barag\u00e1on, M\u00e1ron, Nagraura, Saia, Tenduapur, Borau, and Bibiapur. Portions of the tract seem to have been held by Baih\u00e1r Ah\u00edrs and Dh\u00e1nuks contemporaneously with the wider occupation by Thatcheras. The displacement of these early tribes was effected by conquest by Sombansis from S\u00e1ntankhera (S\u00e1ndi) under K\u00e1nh Randh\u00edr Singh, B\u00e1chhils from Barai Thana (in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur) under Udai and T\u00e1s, and Kati\u00e1rs from Sonoria near Gwalior under R\u00e1e Deo Datt, ancestor in the twelfth generation of the present head of the Kati\u00e1r clan, R\u00e1ja Hardeo Bakhsh, K.C.S.I.\n\nThe date of R\u00e1e Deo's conquest may be put at about three hundred years ago. His clan were then called T\u00fam\u00e1rs. Family feuds led him to migrate from Sonoria to Singhi R\u00e1mpur (in Farukhabad) on the Ganges; thence he gradually fought his way eastward. At Khasaura he sided with the Baih\u00e1r Ah\u00edrs and crushed their rivals the Dh\u00e1nuks; then turning\non the Baih\u00e1rs he smote and spared not till they excepted his dominion. After establishing himself in Khasaura he attacked the Thatheras, and drove them out of Shi\u00e1mpur, Saia, Bar\u00e1gaon, Tenduapur, and Borau. A career of massacre earned for his clan the name of Kati\u00e1rs (slaughterers). The domain thus acquired has been handed down from father to son to the present day. The late chief, Ranjit Singh, ninth in descent from his merciless ancestor, R\u00e1e Deo, lived in a state of constant warfare with the ex-government. Sir W. Sleeman thus speaks of him:\n\n\"The estate of Kutearee, on the left-hand side of the road towards the Ramgunga and Ganges, is held by Runjeet Sing of the Kuteear Rajpoot clan. His estate yields to him about one hundred and twenty thousand rupees a year, while he is assessed at only sixteen thousand. While Hakeem Mehndee was in banishment at Futtehgurh, about fifteen years ago, he became intimate with Runjeet Sing of Kutearee; and when he afterwards became minister, in 1837, he is said to have obtained for him the king's seal and signature to a perpetual lease at this rate, from which is deducted a nankar of four thousand, leaving an actual demand of only twelve thousand. Were such grants in perpetuity respected in Oude, the minister and their minions would soon sell the whole of his majesty's dominions, and leave him a beggar. He has not yet been made to pay a higher rate; not, however, out of regard for the king's pledge, but solely out of that for Runjeet's fort of Dhurmpur, on the bank of the Ganges, his armed bands, and his seven pieces of cannon. He has been diligently employing all his surplus rents in improving his defensive means; and besides his fort and guns, is said to have a large body of armed and disciplined men. He has seized upon a great many villages around belonging to weaker proprietors, and is every year adding to his estate in this way. In this the old Amil, Hafiz Abdool-lah, acquiesced, solely because he had not the means nor the energy to prevent it. He got his estate excluded from the jurisdiction of the local authorities and placed in the Huzoor Tuhseel.\n\n\"Like others of his class who reside on the border, he has a village in British territory to reside in unmolested, when charged by the Oude authorities with heavy crimes and balances. He had been attacked and driven across the Ganges in 1837 for contumacy and rebellion, deprived of his estate, and obliged to reside at Futtehgurh, where he first became acquainted with Hakeem Mehndee. The Oude Government has often remonstrated against the protection which this contumacious and atrocious landholder receives from our subjects and authorities.\"\n\nIt may be doubted whether the epithet atrocious was ever deserved. At any rate the present generation of Oudh Governors is glad to forget the contumacy of Ranjit Singh, while gratefully remembering the unswerving loyalty of his honoured great-grandson, R\u00e1ja Hardeo Bakhsh, C.S.I. In the dark days of 1857 this gallant gentleman was as true as steel to the English Government. To his generous help the chief civil officers of two districts in the north-west, the Collectors of Farukhabad and Budoon, owed their lives. The story has been well told in Mr. R. M. Edwards' Reminiscences of a Bengal Civilian, The title of R\u00e1ja, the Star of India, a j\u00e1g\u00edr,\nand other favours mark the gratitude of the British Government for his loyal aid in the hour of need.\n\n**KATRA MEDNI SINGH\u2014Pargana PARTABGARH\u2014Tahsil PARTABGARH\u2014District PARTABGARH.**\u2014This village was founded by Medni Singh, the brother of the R\u00e1ja of Partabgarh. The river Sai is two miles off, and Bela station four. There is a great masonry tank here made by R\u00e1ni Suj\u00e1n Kunwar, wife of R\u00e1ja Chhatardh\u00e1ri Singh. This is the largest tank in Oudh, but is useless, having fallen into bad repair:\n\n| Population | ... | ... | 1,917 Hindus. |\n|------------|-----|-----|--------------|\n|            | ... | ... | 845 Musalmans. |\n| Total      |     |     | 2,762        |\n\nThere are seven temples to Mah\u00e1deo and two to P\u00e9rasn\u00e1th, also five places of Moslem worship. The grain sold in the bazar reaches the annual value of Rs. 14,000. There is a fair in the month of Ku\u00e1r at which 12,000 people assemble.\n\n**KAUNDHA*\u2014Pargana B\u00c1WAN\u2014Tahsil HARDOI\u2014District HARDOI.**\u2014Kaundha (population 2,186, chiefly Cham\u00e1rs), an agricultural village of 282 mud houses, five miles north-west from Hardoi, on the Shahabad road, in pargana Baw\u00e1n, tahsil and district Hardoi. Market days Mondays and Fridays. A village school was established in 1867; average number of pupils 40.\n\nKaundha is owned by Chamar G\u00e1urs whose ancestors dispossessed the Thatheras in the latter days of the Kanauj kingdom. The G\u00e1urs of Kaundha are notorious for contumacy and evil livelihood. In the Nawabi they were always in trouble. In 1841 they killed the son of Maulvi Far\u00edd-ud-d\u00edn, Chakladar of Gopamau. In retaliation their village was burnt. They are a refractory, quarrelsome, ill-conditioned set, their one redeeming quality (owed probably to the fact that they are Rajputs in name rather than in reality), is that they do not murder their daughters.\n\n**KAURI\u00c1LA River.\u2014**This river (in Thornton\u2019s Gazetteer Kurnalli) rises in Thibet in latitude 30\u00b0 43', longitude 80\u00b0 47', flows through Naip\u00e1l generally in a south-easterly direction for 213 miles till at the junction of the Moh\u00e1n it enters the province of Oudh, dividing Kheri and Bahraich. It bursts through a deep gorge in the lower range of the Himalayas at Shisha P\u00e1n\u00ed (the crystal waters), eighteen miles north of the Moh\u00e1n; at this place it is about 300 yards broad, the water of great depth, and the current slow, about one mile an hour. Precipitous mountains rising about 2,500 feet shut it in closely, and the descent is so abrupt that there is no space even for a footpath; landslips on each side have scarped off the hills, so that few trees and little brushwood even is left. Gigantic rocks, which have either been torn away in avalanches, or have been carried down in glaciers at some remote period, encumber the banks, the edges of the channels; one or two of them are regarded with some reverence by the natives, but there is no such veneration or superstitious concourse as attend many of the other rivers when they debouch from the Himalayas. A little beyond Shisha\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nP\u00e1ni the channel widens, and the steeper descent and rocky bottom cause magnificent rapids nearly half a mile broad, the opening of the hills is broader, and dense forest clothes their slopes to the water's edge. There can be few fine spectacles than this half mile of turbid white water presents when lit up by moonlight, or when the forests on either side take fire; then the long range of lofty height is soon flaming to the water's edge, the roar of the water is mingled with that of the conflagration, and with the crash of falling trees; this often lasts for several days and nights, a huge pall of smoke gathers over the tumultuous scene, and is swept away about noon each day by a cold wind which comes down from the mountain passes.\n\nA mile from Sh\u00edsha P\u00e1ni the river divides into two streams; the western retains the name of Kauri\u00e1la, the eastern is called the Girwa; the latter ten years ago was a mere stream, but its volume has gradually increased till now it is considerably larger than the Kauri\u00e1la. They are rapid rivers, their beds covered with large pebbles often a foot in diameter, particularly at the fords, where they are broad and so shallow that elephants can pass generally without difficulty. They are about four hundred yards broad, and from three to four feet deep; they cannot be forded except at one or two places where the graziers cross them holding on by buffaloes' tails.\n\nThe Girwa particularly is a most beautiful stream, its banks are covered with dense forests of dark s\u00e1l, the mountains appear over the tree-tops. In many places the river has formed large openings in these high grounds, several miles broad, through which the water passes in several clear cut channels. The islands thus formed are generally covered with evergreen shisham trees and thickets of willow. Abandoned channels intersect the forest, and in them the reeds are twelve feet high. Diagonally across the stream extend ridges of kankar or rock, sometimes half a mile long, over which the water sweeps, and the lower part of the long slope foams white as snow. Navigation is thus impeded. Large boats ascend a mile beyond the Moh\u00e1n to Dhanaura on the Girwa, and Bil\u00e1sar on the Kauri\u00e1la, carrying 500 maunds or nearly twenty tons; boats carrying 1,200 maunds or about 46 tons ascend to Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t in 28\u00b0 15' north latitude, but the principal seat of river traffic is at Kat\u00e1i Gh\u00e1t, where the S\u00e1rda joins, and the united streams become the Gogra. Grain is exported largely; timber, ginger, pepper, wax, gh\u00ed, catechu come from Naip\u00e1l. The principal mart is at Gola Gh\u00e1t, about five miles above the Moh\u00e1n on the Kauri\u00e1la; the timber and grain alone are trusted to water carriage.\n\nGold is washed from the gravel and sand by a particular caste called the Sun\u00e1his. Besides the Moh\u00e1n, celebrated for its mahs\u00edr fishing, the Suheli, flowing in the old channel of the S\u00e1rda, joins at Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t from the west, then at Kat\u00e1i Gh\u00e1t the Dah\u00e1war, Chauka, and S\u00e1rda join from Kheri, and the Sarju from Bahraich.\n\nThe minimum cold weather discharge of the Kauri\u00e1la is said to be 11,000 feet per second at R\u00e1mnagar;* but this must have been taken at a time when the Girwa was a small stream, for the Girwa joins below R\u00e1mnagar at\n\n* Sarda Canal Report, page 4.\nShit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t, when the Chauka adds above 6,000 cubic feet per second at Kat\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t, yet at Bahramghat the united volume of water only amounts to 18,000* cubic feet. The Ganges at Cawnpore is 5,000, at Hardwar 8,000, the Jumna 3,500, the Sutlej nearly 5,000, the S\u00e1rda 63,901, but the facts concerning the Kauri\u00e1la are not so well ascertained. Probably the Kauri\u00e1la at R\u00e1mnagar does not now discharge above 4,000 cubic feet, if so much; it is not above two hundred yards broad, and, except in one narrow channel, not above four feet deep.\n\nThe principal fish in the Kauri\u00e1la are the rohu, mahs\u00edr, mullet, hill trout, and the bichwa.\n\nThe river has not changed its course materially except below Shit\u00e1bi Gh\u00e1t, where it has concentrated its waters in the eastern channel, abandoning much land in Matehra; also further down it has trended eastwards at Mallih, north of the Dah\u00e1war, leaving bare large breadths of sand which in time have become covered with jh\u00e1o (tamarix dioica).\n\nIf we are to believe Tiefenthaler\u2020, it once flowed only three miles east of the Khairigarh fort, from which it is now eight miles distant, but he states that the river is there called Ken\u00e1r or Khen\u00e1r; it is probable that there was a lateral channel of that name. The abandoned course of what was once a large river runs under Sing\u00e1hi in Khairigarh. The slope of the river is about two feet per mile from Sh\u00edsha P\u00e1n\u00ed to R\u00e1mnagar Gh\u00e1t, which is 449 feet above the sea; thence to Mall\u00e1pur, 375 feet above the sea, it is about one foot per mile. (See also articles Gogra and S\u00e1rda for a further account of this river in its lower course.) The affluents of the Kauri\u00e1la are described in the Bahraich district article.\n\nKEW\u00c1NI River\u2021\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014The Kew\u00e1ni issues from the Jumaita T\u00e1l near the village of Jumaita in pargana Kheri, district Kheri, four miles south-west of Kheri. It takes a south-south-easterly course, and at a distance of forty miles as the crow flies, falls into the Chauka at a village called Umr\u00e1pur. For a little distance from its source the stream is narrow and shallow; it deepens as it reaches the Chauka.\n\n| Breadth about | ... | ... | 50 feet. |\n|---------------|-----|-----|---------|\n| Extreme depth | ... | ... | 20 \"   |\n| Average       | ... | ... | 9 \"    |\n\nIn the rains.\n\nThe water begins to dry up in November near its source.

W. Gibson, Assistant Commissioner.\nwest to east; in shape it is irregular quadrilateral, and it is bounded on the west and south by the river Sar\u00e1yan, on the east by the Gon, and on the north by pargana Harg\u00e1m. These two rivers meet together at the southern extremity of the pargana which forms their du\u00e1b. The Sar\u00e1yan and the Gon are but inconsiderable streams, fordable in the dry weather, but giving a water communication during the rest of the year, country boats going down to Lucknow via the Gumti, into which river the Sar\u00e1yan falls at Hindaura Gh\u00e1t. The area of the pargana is 128 square miles, of which 75 are cultivated, and the detail in acres is as follows:\n\n| Cultivated | ... | 47,815 |\n|------------|-----|--------|\n| Culturable | ... | 17,455 |\n| Mu\u00e1\u00e1       | ... | 1,099  |\n| Barren     | ... | 15,268 |\n\ngiving a total of 81,637 acres.\n\nThe population numbers 63,728, and is thus distributed:\n\n| Hindus, { Agricultural | ... | 23,286 |\n| Non-agricultural       | ... | 25,678 |\n| Total                 | ... | 48,964 |\n\n| Muhammedans, { Agricultural | ... | 2,446 |\n| Non-agricultural         | ... | 12,348 |\n| Total                   | ... | 14,794 |\n\nGrand Total | ... | 63,728\n\nThe Musalmans form 23 per cent. of the entire population, a larger proportion than obtains in any other pargana. There are 498 souls to the square mile and 4\u00bd to each house, the houses numbering 13,793. The principal Hindu castes are as follows:\u2014Brahmans 4,778; Rajputs 2,340; K\u00e1yaths 1,322; Ah\u00edrs 5,639; P\u00e1s\u00eds 4,319; Cham\u00e1rs 5,786; Kah\u00e1rs 2,504; Lodhs 6,788; Mur\u00e1os 2,010; Kurmis being conspicuous by their absence. The pargana consists of 153 demarcated villages, the proprietary title in which is distributed thus: British cantonment 2; taluqa Kanw\u00e1n Khera 16\u00bd; Naz\u00fal 13; K\u00e1yaths 52; Musalmans 24\u00bd; Brahmans 6; Rajputs 34; miscellaneous 5. It may be noted that K\u00e1yaths have more villages in this pargana than any other caste.\n\nIts natural features resemble those of Sitapur; there are no hills, lakes or forests, or large rivers to be met with. The soil is fertile, the country is well wooded, water is abundant, the maximum depth at which it is found being 28 feet. The climate is good. Numerous and good bazars are held throughout the pargana, and they may be tabulated thus:\n\n| Names of places where bazars are held. | Days on which held. | Commodities supplied. |\n|----------------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Thompsonganj                           | Saturday and Wednesday | Every kind of commodity. |\n| Cantonment bazar                       | Tuesday and Friday   | Cloths, grains, salt. |\n| Khairabad Khas                         | Every day            | Every kind.           |\n| Unakia                                 | Monday and Friday    | Cloths, grains, salt. |\n| G\u00fagra                                  | Thursday and Sunday  | Ditto ditto.          |\n| T\u00e1jipur                                | Tuesday and Saturday | Ditto ditto.          |\nThe melas or fairs are as follows:\n\nGovernment mela held in January (vide town Khairabad.)\nR\u00e1ml\u00edla, in September-October, attended by 15,000 souls.\nDad K\u00e1ndan, in August, attended by ... 2,000 \"\nDew\u00e1l, in October, ditto ... 3,000 \"\nK\u00e1tki, ditto, for bathing ... 3,000 \"\nChar, in April, a women's festival, in honour of Debi.\"\n\nBesides which the two \u00cdds and the muharram are celebrated with considerable \u00e9clat, and there is a Musalman gathering in June at the shrine of Y\u00fasuf Khan, who slew an Ahban king, as described under the heading of town Khairabad, to which the reader is referred for particulars concerning the foundation of the city.\n\nAt these fairs commodities of all sorts are sold. A pretty brisk trade in grain is carried on with Lucknow, but, with the exception of the cloth made in Khairabad, there are no manufactures, nor are there any mines or quarries. The principal public buildings in the pargana are the court houses, barracks, hospitals, &c., in the civil lines and cantonments of Sitapur. The camping grounds for troops are three, one at Sarayy\u00e1n on the Bisw\u00e1n road, one at Thompsonanj, and one at Jal\u00e1lpur on the road to Lucknow. In Khairabad are two sar\u00e1s, one built by the philanthropic H\u00e1kim Mehndi, who built the bridge at Sitapur, and the bridge and sar\u00e1\u00e9 at Maholi; the other built by Chaudhri R\u00e1m Nar\u00e1in K\u00e1yath, taluqdar of Mub\u00e1rakpur, who also bridged the Gon river at Dumor\u00e1li; and there is a third sar\u00e1\u00e9 built by Government.\n\nThe proportion of cultivated land to each head of the agricultural population is 19 acres, and of culturable land 2\u00bd acres. This corresponds almost exactly with the proportion obtaining in pargana Sitapur. The rents are almost entirely paid in kind. The incidence of the revised jama is as follows:\n\n| Rs. a. p. |\n|-----------|\n| On cultivated land ... ... 1 8 9 per acre. |\n| On culturable \" ... ... 1 1 6 \" \" |\n| On total area \" ... ... 0 13 8 \" \" |\n\nThe history of the pargana is in part necessarily told under the history of the town Khairabad, and need not be given here. It was Todar Mal who constituted the pargana out of 10 tappas, one of which in 1131 Fasli was taken out of it. In Unasia, four miles south of Khairabad, are the remains of R\u00e1ja Bh\u00edm Sen's fort, in the shape of an extensive d\u00edh or mound (vide P\u00edrnagar), with a wide fosse extending like a horse-shoe round three sides of it. Besides this d\u00edh there are 20 others in the pargana, and these are all the remains of antiquity to be met with. The local couplet about Bh\u00edm Sen of Unasia's death runs thus:\n\nAssi t\u00e1l un\u00e1si kna tihk\u00e1 r\u00e1c pl\u00e1s\u00e1 mna.\nThere were 80 tanks and 79 wells, yet the lord of them died of thirst.\n\nThe Baises and K\u00e1yaths are said to have succeeded the P\u00e1s\u00eds in the government of this pargana. There was one Gobind Singh K\u00e1yath, who formed an alliance with the B\u00e1chhils of N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, and joined by the Bais\ndrove away the P\u00e1s\u00eds. There is still one taluqdar, who is probably of the family of the original conqueror, viz., Chaudhri R\u00e1m N\u00e1r\u00e1in of Mub\u00e1rakpur in this pargana; and the members of the K\u00e1yath caste, though of non-taluqdari families, are in possession of a good many villages. The most famous of the n\u00e1zims of Khairabad were Hak\u00edm Mehndi \u00c1li Khan, afterwards the prime minister of Oudh, R\u00e1\u00e9 Kundan L\u00e1l, K\u00e1yath of Lucknow, Girdh\u00e1ra Singh, and Mirza Banda Ali Beg. It was R\u00e1ja Har Parsh\u00e1d, the last n\u00e1zm of the place, who accompanied the rebel queen to Naip\u00e1l. A tabsildar also resided at Khairabad, and the regiments stationed there were under the control of native commandants and collectors. At annexation the town was made the head-quarters of the commissioner, but after the re-occupation the seat of local government was removed to Sitapur, and the town is now the head-quarters of a pargana. For further details see \u201cSitapur Division.\u201d\n\n**KHAIRABAD* Town\u2014Pargana KHAIRABAD\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.** Khairabad is the chief town of the pargana of the same name, and is distant south-eastward from Sitapur five miles by a metalled road. It is the fifth largest town in the whole province, having a population of 15,677, the Hindus and Musalmans being pretty equally divided. There are about 15 of the former to 16 of the latter.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded by one Khaira, a P\u00e1si, in the first year of the 11th century, and to have been subsequently taken possession of by a K\u00e1yath family. In after years many rent-free grants of portions of its site were made to Musalmans who came in great numbers in the reigns of B\u00e1bar and Akbar, but these grants were all resumed by the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh some 65 years ago. Before the abovementioned Khaira P\u00e1si\u2019s time the place was known as Masichait (Masi chitra), and was a place of pilgrimage so far back as the reign of the great Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt. The name is still extant in the appellation of a tank, the waters of which are said to possess healing properties, and which is called \u201cMasw\u00e1si Tal\u00e1o.\u201d\n\nThere are 40 mosques and 30 Hindu temples, besides which there is the very beautiful suite of holy buildings erected some 40 years ago by one M\u00e1kka, by trade a tailor, and also a royal darogha. These consist of a Qadam Ras\u00fal, an Im\u00e1mbara, and mosques with intervening courtyards, all surrounded by a handsome wall. Attached to the darg\u00e1h of M\u00e1kdum is a mu\u00e1f\u00ed village, Lod\u00fapur, and the temple of Vishnu has assigned to it for its support the revenue of M\u00e1st\u00fampur. There are in addition to the above four N\u00e1nak Sh\u00e1hi sangats. The th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra of R\u00e1\u00e9 Daulat R\u00e1\u00e9, K\u00e1yath, formerly a deputy minister of Oudh, is presided over by a mahant, and has a small estate attached to it for the support of the faq\u00edrs. The public buildings are a police station, school, registry office, post-office, and sar\u00e1\u00e9s. There are four baz\u00e1rs and markets held daily. In the month of January there is held a very large fair instituted by Government, and in which all sorts of commodities and cattle are sold. It lasts for ten days and draws together a very large concourse of people averaging 60,000 souls. Kashmir shawl merchants and vendors of Birmingham jewellery, horses from K\u00e1ti\u00e1w\u00e1r and elephants from Assam, circus riders from\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nSidney and wrestlers from the Punjab, the missionary, the maulvi and the pandit, all may be seen here. Besides this, which is known as the Khairatad mela, there is in the Dasahra a large gathering, the Ramlila, at which perhaps 15,000 souls attend. The annual value of the bazar sales, including those of the January fair, Rs. 1,55,654, is put down at Rs. 3,40,769. There are no local manufactures.\n\nKhairabad is 47 miles north-west of Lucknow, on the metalled road to Shahjahanpur, and lies in 27\u00b0 32' north and 80\u00b0 48' east.\n\nThe Pasi Khaira who founded the town was a subject of the Ahban Raja Bhim Sen, who owned the surrounding country in those days. He was killed by Basdeo, a Kaya, whose father he had slain.\n\n**KHAIRIGARH Pargana\u2014Tahsil NIGHASAN\u2014District KHERI**\u2014This pargana lies between the Mohan river on the north, and the Suheli or Sarju on the south; on the east it is bounded by the Kauriala, and on the west by the kingdom of Naipal. It is the largest pargana in the district, being forty-seven miles from east to west, and about twelve miles from north to south; its area is 425 square miles, but more than half of this, viz., 263 square miles, is the property of Government, being covered with State forests. The general aspect of the country is much the same as in Kukra Mailani, the highlands covered with dense sal forest, and the hollows being either swamps or, when more elevated, rice-fields. The general slope is from the north-west corner, where the bluffs above the Mohan are 600 feet above the sea (the greatest plain elevation in Oudh), down to the junction of the Suheli and Kauriala, where the level is not more than 440 feet.\n\nBesides the three abovenamed rivers on its borders, there is the Jauraha, which rises in a little tank about a mile south of the Mohan, and is probably created by filtration from that stream. It takes a tortuous course of about 60 miles before effecting a junction with the Suheli. Its waters are sluggish, sometimes of great depth, and its quicksands render it impossible to cross it with elephants, even where not more than five yards broad. The stream is nearly everywhere overhung by the sal forest, and is often black with the decaying leaves. It is nowhere bridged. The Kauriala and Mohan are the subjects of separate articles.\n\nThe Suheli is really the old channel of the Sarju, which once ran under the Khairigarh fort; the waters which now take this course belong to two former affluents of the Sarju, which thread their way in a narrow current through the high grass and brushwood, covering what was formerly the channel of the great river. The banks of the Mohan are precipitous, and their height renders it impossible to use the water for irrigation. The ancient bank of the Chauka is also about thirty feet above the level of the Suheli. In fact the whole pargana consists of a lofty plateau between three rivers with a series of depressions in the middle, through which flows the Jauraha, and a large sunken plain at the eastern extremity. Drainage is everywhere good; there is nothing which can be called a lake, and but a very few small morasses, which might all be drained, being far above the level of the rivers.\nThe climate is reckoned much better than that of Kukra Mail\u00e1ni; goitre is almost unknown, but fever makes great ravages. In the interior of the forest the savannahs of rank grass which occur are tenanted almost exclusively by Th\u00e1rus, who enjoy fairly good health by reason of their houses being raised on platforms. Rain is heavy, much above the district average, and it commences earlier than elsewhere, coming down the gorge where the Kauri\u00e1la bursts through the lower ranges of the Himalayas.\n\nLarge herds of n\u00edl-g\u00e1e occasionally do some damage to the crops, but all along the banks of the Kauri\u00e1la, and in the forests south of the Moh\u00e1n, tiger, spotted deer, porcupine, hog deer, sambur, and pig abound in profusion. Wild elephants used to be common, but have now almost entirely disappeared, and it is only occasionally that a stray one wanders across the Moh\u00e1n during the rains. Black and grey partridge, hares, peafowl, and bustard are met with in great numbers in the large open savannahs above described. Large parties of sportsmen, mounted on elephants, annually spend April and May in these forests, which several Viceroys, and recently the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh, have at different times during the century explored in pursuit of game.\n\nThe population is 33,046, in 60 inhabited villages, or 69 to the square mile, but the revenue paying land is only 143 square miles, and this alone can be peopled, as the forests are not allowed to be occupied. Taking the available area therefore, the population is actually about 231 to the square mile. Two-thirds of the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits, and only 68 square miles are cultivated. There are not more than 2,100 Musalmans,\u2014less than six per cent. of the whole. Ah\u00edrs are the principal caste, numbering 5,500, or 16 per cent. of the population. There are only 840 Brahmans, about 2\u00bd per cent., these wild and waste districts not suiting them. There are 1,400 Chhattris, principally Bais and Pah\u00e1ris; Kurmis number 3,300, or 10 per cent.; and Mur\u00e1os 1,700, or 5 per cent.; but the Th\u00e1rus alone call for special notice, as this is the only cis-Gogra pargana in which they are met with as permanent residents. They number 900, and an account of this caste by Captain Thurburn is appended:\n\n\"The race is of the Hindu Aryan family, though the features of its members bear evidence of intermixture with Tarter blood. It is supposed that the race is descended from the same Rajput caste as the R\u00e1na of Chittaurgarh, and prior to its exile it was settled in the province of that name in Central India, but during the wars in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori, in the year 1151 A.D., its members migrated to the wild jungles at the foot of the Himalayan mountains in the province of Oudh, and have ever since remained there. In every village the Muhamdi Th\u00e1rus are said to appoint four office-bearers, one as chief or headman, one as accountant, one as arbitrator of disputes and distributor of resources, and another to attend on the chief and to the requirements of the community as well as of strangers. A share of the produce is assigned for the performance of these duties. The Th\u00e1rus are hardworking, and surpass other natives in this respect; they are peaceful and united, and mutually help each other in cultivating the soil. Rice is their staple crop, and from this they used to distil an intoxicating liquor, to the consumption of which they were much addicted. They eat meat (which has died or been killed), fish,\nunleavened bread, and vegetables. They cannot stand the sun, and therefore use umbrellas made of leaves. The women are chaste and hardy. The Th\u00e1ru believes in witchcraft, and sorcery is commonly practised. Each member of the tribe constructs a hollow mound opposite his door, and thereon erects a stick like a 'phallus.' This he considers sacred, and worships as an idol. These people observe the Holi festival with much ceremony.\n\n\"The Muhamdi Th\u00e1rus are divided into the R\u00e1na Batur and M\u00e1lwaria stems, and these do not intermarry. When one of the tribe dies, the body is painted with vermillion and saffron and placed before the mound already mentioned, and during the entire night an incantation is pronounced. This ceremony is supposed to be an aid to witchcraft, and to prevent wild animals from eating the crops, thus dispensing with the necessity of night watching. These people do not consult Brahmans as to marriages; they have no betrothals, and they marry during all the months of the year. Their houses are made of grass and mats raised above the ground and reached by ladders (from which fact those who dwell in malarious districts may well take a practical hint), and they all cultivate gardens. They are bold sportsmen, good marksmen, and expert game-snarers. They eat meat, but not the flesh of cows and buffaloes.\"\n\nOpinions seem divided as to whether the Th\u00e1rus are Hindus or not, but this is very likely, owing to a difference of meaning, the one party applying the term Hindus to natives of Hindustan, the other to Aryans only. There seems little doubt that they belonged to the races which held Chittaur, but those were only very partially Aryans. The Th\u00e1rus all retain the tradition that they were driven from Chittaur by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori; they mean, of course, Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji. It was usual in those times for Chhattirs to change their names, in order to escape the sword of that emperor who had designed to destroy the whole fighting clan. The Th\u00e1rus still relate with complacency how they fled, seeking in vain for shelter, till they reached the jungles of Khairigarh, where for the first time they rested, \"thahre,\" and hence their name. It is clear that their religion is not the Hindu faith; they bury their dead, and have neither the fourfold division of caste nor any equivalent for it. Their village system is one prevalent among all the hill tribes, as is also their custom of eating their meals in the daytime. The Th\u00e1rus are very independent; they refuse all service, and never leave their forests. The Th\u00e1rus of Gonda declare they came from Ajodhya. The Gorakhpur Th\u00e1rus assert that they are descended from the Aut\u00e1r Chhattirs who conquered Butwal under Ratan Sen of Chittaur, and cohabited with women of easy virtue, as almost all hill women are. Mr. Carnegy remarks that \"a number of tribes in these parts, besides the Th\u00e1rus of the sub-Himalayan districts, for instance the Nats, Kanjars, the Brijb\u00e1sis, the Sirm\u00e1rs,\" claim a Chhattri origin; but most of them declare that they were formerly R\u00e1thors of Kanauj.\n\nThere are no landed proprietors in the pargana except the R\u00e1ja of Khairigarh, who owns 67 of the 70 villages, and Government which has the remainder. The Government revenue assessed at summary settlement was Rs. 17,386, and the present demand, which is liable to revision, is Rs. 49,633.\nThere are no manufactures, but a considerable trade is carried on in export of grain and bullocks, and there is some transit trade with Gola-gh\u00e1t, in Naip\u00e1l, in woollens, hides, honey, skins; salt and cotton goods being the principal articles returned to the Naipalese. There are no towns deserving the name. Sing\u00e1hi and Khairigarh are described elsewhere. There is not a bridge in the pargana; only three brick-built houses, two temples to Mah\u00e1deo, and one small school where Urdu and Hindi are taught.\n\nThe crops are principally rice and barley. An average outturn of unhusked rice would be 4 cwt. to an acre, in land not artificially watered or manured; and after making allowance for produce injured by floods or wild animals, barley would not yield more than 3 cwt. Irrigation is not practised at all. Rents, except in rare instances, range between Re. 1-4-0 and Rs. 2-8-0 per acre, and are almost entirely paid in cash. A fair is held about the 17th of March, at the shrine of Pir Sa\u00e1dat Ali, in the forest adjoining the fort of Khairigarh, and is attended by about 6,000 people. Another gathering in honour of Debi assembles in May round hertemple at the village of So\u00e1tha, and musters on an average 4,000 worshippers.\n\nOne curious feature of Khairigarh is that the value of landed property has apparently fallen immensely during the last three hundred years\u2014a fact which is quite contrary to the progress made everywhere around; and as the pargana is unique in this respect, the matter may be referred to at length. The total area of the revenue-paying portion of the pargana is 146,592 bighas, or 91,620 acres, of which 57,930 bighas are cultivated, and 88,662 are not. Now the actual rents paid in 1274 F., the year of village survey, were Rs. 53,741, exclusive of mesne profits\u2014a mere trifle\u2014and the average assets of the last five years are only Rs. 50,352. Therefore the actual rental appears to average only Re. 0-13-6 per bigha. According to the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari the area of the pargana was 43,050 bighas, and the revenue was Rs. 45,233, or Re. 1-0-9 per bigha. I give in tabular form the amount and rates of revenue paid in a number of parganas in Oudh in Akbar's time, as also what is now paid, and some very remarkable conclusions may be deduced therefrom. It would be hardly credible that the rents given in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari were correct, if the traditions of the pargana, and other facts to be mentioned, did not quite agree with that work.\n\n| Pargana       | According to \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari | According to the Present Settlement |\n|---------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|               | Area in bighas. | Revenue demand. | Rate per bigha. | Area in bighas. | Revenue demand. | Rate per bigha. |\n| Khairigarh    | 43,050          | 45,233           | 1 0 9            | 146,592         | 49,633           | 0 5 4            |\n| Kheri         | 260,168         | 81,504           | 0 5 0            | 531,791         | 2,55,011         | 0 7 8            |\n| Bisw\u00e1n        | 144,821         | 48,782           | 0 5 4            |                 |                 |                  |\n| Garh Qila Nawa | 15,811         | 12,246           | 0 12 5           | 225,801         | 1,35,607         | 0 9 7            |\n| Dhanabra      |                 |                 |                  | 645,600         | 3,71,559         | 0 9 2            |\n| Barwar        | 185,919         | 88,634           | 0 10 6           |                 |                 |                  |\n| Khairabad     | 159,072         | 54,081           | 0 5 0            |                 |                 |                  |\n| L\u00e1harpur      | 208,288         | 75,612           | 0 5 9            |                 |                 |                  |\nIt appears from the above that in Akbar's time this pargana was assessed at a higher rate than any one now in its neighbourhood, and that it is now assessed at a lower rate than any in its neighbourhood.\n\nIn 1801 Khairigarh and Kanchanpur together were declared to yield annually Rs. 2,01,001 (see Aitchison's Treaties). Now Kanchanpur never yielded a quarter as much as Khairigarh, its assets before annexation having been only Rs. 4,000. Khairigarh must have been worth in 1801 Rs. 1,50,000 at least, and its present rental is Rs. 50,000. Further, it is admitted by the raja's agents that, up to fifteen years ago, all the rice lands in the worst and most jungly part of the pargana used to be let for one rupee per local bigha, or Rs. 4-8-0 per acre. These lands are now let for six annas per bigha, or Re. 1-11-0 per acre. The rental of the villages now included within the boundaries of the Oudh forest approached Rs. 20,000 in the Nawabi; it is now about Rs. 2,000. Therefore the absolute and relative values of land in the pargana were much greater formerly, both at remote and recent periods, than at the present time. There are several reasons for this. Formerly the country north of the Moh\u00e1n belonged to the owner of the pargana, and there was then no competition for cultivators; but the country north of the Moh\u00e1n belongs at present to Naip\u00e1l, and its raja bids against the raja of Khairigarh for cultivators. This obstacle to a rise of rents still continues to a certain extent. Again, these jungles formerly afforded a secure hiding place, in the vicinity of the boundless tar\u00e1i forest, for many persons whose crimes had rendered it impossible or unsafe for them to live in their own villages. This pargana under British rule is no longer closed to the officers of justice, and it has consequently lost the value derived from its security as a place of refuge.\n\nHistory of the pargana.\u2014It is alleged that the name is derived from the Khair jungle, which existed here in great quantities. The pargana formerly extended on both sides of the river Kauri\u00e1la, and included the following townships: Haweli, south of the Jur\u00e1war, round Khairigarh itself; direct north of this, beyond the Jur\u00e1war river, was Kon\u00e1wat; east of this lay Bardia, including most of the tract now covered with the Oudh forests; Manjhia lay east of Haweli, where Dudhwa Gh\u00e1t is now found; while Dharm\u00e1npur and Bharth\u00e1pur lay south and north across the Kauri\u00e1la, which, there is more than one reason to suppose was then a much smaller stream. In the reign of Muhammad Shah, Emperor of Delhi, 1720-54, the townships of Bhartha, Kalkandan, R\u00e9jgh\u00e9t, and Dhoti were conjoined with Khairigarh; Dharm\u00e1npur and Bharth\u00e1pur were taken out of Khairigarh and entered in Dhaurahra in 1817. The early history of the pargana is lost in obscurity. It has been for many centuries, probably at all times, the same huge forest which it now appears. In the reign of F\u00edroz Shah, 1351-88, five centuries ago, we are told that the emperor established a chain of forts along the north bank of the river Sarju to repel marauding expeditions on the part of the mountaineers of Dhoti and Garhw\u00e1l. Tradition states that the emperor with his son ascended the tallest tower of the great Khairigarh fort, one of the best in India, as is recorded in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari. He cast his eyes over the boundless sea of trees, in which no house-roof, no temple-spire, no smoke, or any other sign of human habitation appeared, and was so appalled by the vast solitude,\nthat he at once abandoned the place where he had spent two years building and hunting. He never returned to it, and the fort was abandoned, it is believed, for centuries. The first clear notice of the place is given in deeds granted to the qanungo family, which held office in both Khairigarh and Kheri. A deed signed by Akbar, 1556-1605, recites that Ahbaran, an Ahir of Khairigarh, had usurped dominion, and was oppressing the people, and it directs the destruction of this potentate, who held his state in Kundanpur near Khairigarh. Ruhelas are stated to have then seized the country, but this attack is probably antedated. At any rate, in the Ain-i-Akbari it is stated that Bachhils, Bisens, Bais, and Kurmis were the zamindars of the pargana, in which were six brick-built forts, some of the best in India. The Bachhils, of course, belonged to the tribe of that name which held Kamp Dhaurahra and Barwar (see Kheri district article, chap. V.) The Rajpatis under Raja Babari of Babargarh, now Babari near Dhaurahra, then held the country; they were expelled by the Bisens of Dhaurahra. All this is obscurely told.\n\nThe Lohani Banjaras now appear upon the scene. It is alleged that when the imperial forces under Chhatardas Jangre besieged and took the fort of Kamp, certain Banjaras accompanied the commander as his priests, they being Gaur Brahmans; the probability is that they supplied the force with grain during the long siege. At any rate, when the Jangres seized Bhur and Dhaurahra, the Banjaras got Khairigarh, it is alleged, from the Bisens. This must have been in the reign of Jahangir. Rao Ram Singh was the Banjara chief at the commencement of the nineteenth century. He was a turbulent man and insisted upon imposing taxes on his own brethren, who were trading in grain and cattle, whenever they crossed the ghats in his dominions. The Banjaras under their leader Sangha Naik resisted and defeated the Rao in a pitched battle fought in 1800. In the following year Khairigarh came into the hands of the British, being part of the territories ceded by the Nawab Wazir. It remained in their possession till 1816, when it was handed over to Oudh in exchange for a part of Jaunpur. The English in 1809 sent a force to punish the raja for his cruelty and his exactions from the merchants at Mindia Ghat. He was taken prisoner and carried to Bareilly. Meanwhile, from 1810 to 1814, the lease of the whole pargana was taken by Captain Hearsey, who resided here prior to the breaking out of the Naipal war of 1812, in which he bore a distinguished part. The ruins of his bungalow and some of his furniture are still to be seen in Singahi. Another European, a merchant, Mr. Carbery, settled here about the same time, but his efforts to establish trade were unsuccessful, as he was murdered by the Raja of Dhaurahra.\n\nRao Ram Singh died at Bareilly, and was succeeded by Naeks Madho Singh and Gandu Singh. The Banjaras had now, however, provoked an enemy in a dangerous quarter. The Pahari Chhattiri raja, who now holds the pargana of Khairigarh, and who is a young man educated at the Canning College, claims descent from the sun. The family governed at Saraswati till the time of Raja Suthurot, whose son Marchanddeo moved with his subjects to Ajodhya, where they reigned for 102 generations, till\nthe time of Pitra Sen, who became king of Bharath Khand.* There they reigned for eighteen generations, and then they moved to Kaphar, in Kumaun, where forty-two more of them successively sat upon the throne. The forty-second, Sarangdeo, emigrated to Kathaur; thence the thirty-ninth from Sarangdeo, Tirloki Pal, having married the daughter of the raja of Bhot, got twenty-two parganas as a dowry, moved to his new estate in the hills, and settled in Ajmer. This twentieth descendant was Arjun Mal, a contemporary of the emperor Akbar.\n\nThey claim then to have governed in different parts of India for more than 220 generations prior to the sixteenth century. In spite of this long descent, it may be remarked that the family is hardly considered Chhattiri at all; and even when they managed to marry their daughters to the Ahbans, Janwars, or Raikwars, they had to pay large sums as bribes. Further, none of these places or parganas appear on the map of Kumaun, and the whole story is most probably one of those fictions in which the bards of India are so fertile.\n\nArjun Mal went to visit the Emperor Akbar at Delhi, and on his passing through the bazar, all the metal\u2020 dishes exposed for sale on either side of the way burst into pieces. The emperor, hearing of this, invited the mountain chief to court, and took care that a phul utensil should be deposited in the room where the interview was to take place. As soon as Arjun Mal entered the vessel was shivered to pieces. Akbar inquired the reason, and was told that as Arjun Mal was a S\u00farajbans, a descendant of the sun, the rays of divine light which still emanated from his person were of sufficient power to crack so mean a metal as phul. The emperor gave him a jagir, the title of maharaja, and fixed his tribute at twenty-five gold mohurs, five ponies, eleven yaks' tails, and fifteen musk-deer. Dip Singh was a descendant of Arjun Mal; his daughter was asked in marriage by the king of Naipal, Ran Bahadur Sah; and a refusal was followed by war about 1790 A.D.\n\nThis was probably true, as the Gurkhas, although also claiming to be children of the sun, are still known to be of low aboriginal origin. The war with Naipal, however, mainly arose from other and broader causes of difference. A general account of it and of the S\u00farajbans chiefs who occupied Kumaun and Naipal need not be given here. There were four principalities in the latter country; P\u00e1tan, Khatmandu, Bancha, Bhatgaon, which were all successively conquered by the Gurkhas. The Khairigarh family had no connexion, as far as is now known, with any of the above; as already stated, they occupied an estate at Ajmer. Their best known and principal residence was Dhoti, fifty miles north of Khairigarh; so much is certain, but all the other details, both of the family origin and of their position and rights in Naipal, are covered with doubt and obscurity.\n\nThey claim to have always held Kanchanpur in sovereignty; but this was included in Khairigarh (at least Dhoti, Kalkandan, Bhartha, Rajhat were placed in Khairigarh) in the reign of Muhammad Shah, and the\n\n* Prinsep's Tables, 382.\n\u2020 Phul.\nsovereignty doubtless passed at the time of the absorption into the pargana of Khairigarh.\n\nThe S\u00farajbans, on the other hand, represent that Kanchanpur belonged to them; but local report gives a third story, doubtless the true one, to the effect that a Brahman family had established its sovereignty there. At any rate, the S\u00farajbans family found a Brahman in possession, either as an independent chief or as an agent. They made war upon him, took him prisoner, and drowned him in the Chauka, near Marauncha Gh\u00e1t, about 1830 A.D. He was known as Bhatji of Joraili. It must be added, however, that some of the most trustworthy members of the family do not confirm the magniloquent account above given, and content themselves with saying that the emperor conferred upon Arjun Mal, not the title of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, but that of S\u00e1h, which they have ever since borne.\n\nAt any rate, from the time of the expulsion of the family from Dhoti in 1790 to that of their seizure of Kanchanpur in 1830, they wandered about, subsisting either on the charity of the Oudh nobles, or by fighting under the British Government.\n\nWhen first driven down from Dhoti, they had tried to settle in Kanchanpur, which, as we have seen, had been included in Khairigarh by the Emperor Muhammad Shah. There occurred the first collision between them and the Khairigarh Banj\u00e1ras. R\u00e1o R\u00e1m Singh attacked and plundered the refugees, according to their own account; or, as is equally probable, repelled an invasion of his dominions by the hillmen, who, being robbed of their own territory, designed in turn to rob their neighbour of his. The S\u00farajbans fled further south, and after a short stay in R\u00e1mpur of Rohilkhand, and Shahabad, settled for a time in Bh\u00far pargana at Basantpur. They got that village from R\u00e1o Balwant Singh of Bh\u00far, and Kalbaria of Khairigarh from their old enemy R\u00e1m Singh as a sort of maintenance, such as the nobles of India are always eager to provide for decayed members of their order.\n\nAbout this time D\u00edp S\u00e1h died, leaving two sons, P\u00edrth\u00edp\u00e1l S\u00e1h and R\u00e1j Ganga S\u00e1h, who both aided the British in the war with the Gurkhas in 1812, and the former was rewarded with a perpetual pension of Rs. 2,400, which his descendants still enjoy.\n\nR\u00e1j Ganga S\u00e1h, as we have already seen, acquired Kanchanpur in 1821 A.D., and thence, with the aid of the Bh\u00far r\u00e1ja, whose alliance he had secured by intermarriages, planned an attack upon the Banj\u00e1ra estate, now held by M\u00e1dho Singh and Gandu Singh. The Banj\u00e1ras were defeated in 1830; Bardia, with most of the estate, was seized, but Gain Singh, the son of M\u00e1dho Singh, still held out. Gain Singh was a man of prodigious personal strength; he had only 25 men, but they defended the massive walls of the Khairigarh fort, which were then in fair preservation, till more than 300 of the enemy were killed. Gain Singh abandoned the fort, but returned in a few months with a large force which he had collected among his brethren in Pillibhit. The S\u00farajbans, who had seen something of real warfare under Ochterlony and Gillespie, lay in ambush for him in the primeval forest which lies in the north of the Suheli. Gain Singh\u2019s forces pushed through the forest in scattered order, occupied in guarding\nhuge herds of cattle which they had swept together on their way through the savannahs of Khairigarh. On a sudden they were attacked on both flanks by invisible foes, who poured on them a continuous matchlock fire, which they were unable to reply to; they fled at once; there was little slaughter and no pursuit. In 1841 the complaints of the dispossessed Banj\u00e1ra chief were listened to by the Oudh Government; a force was collected and advanced through Bhira. R\u00e1j Ganga S\u00e1h fled to Kanchanpur, and for a year or so the Banj\u00e1ras remained in possession; but dysentery and fever breaking out among the chakladar's troops, he retired to Newalkh\u00e1r, a fort on the bank of the old bed where the Chauka once flowed. There he hoped to remain and gather strength, but the epidemic became tenfold more severe. The rains having set in early, the former channel of the river became a huge swamp, through which it was impossible to drag the cannon, and from which poisonous exhalations steamed up like dense fogs. The chakladar himself died with almost his entire force; the few survivors crawled back from the fatal jungles unmolested by the S\u00farajbans, who thenceforth were undisturbed in Khairigarh. The Banj\u00e1ra family entirely disappeared from Oudh. One ancient woman, the widow of Gain Singh, came forward in 1870 to claim her husband's property; but as the r\u00e1ja's right to the entire estate had been admitted, both in 1856, when Oudh was annexed, and in 1858, after the mutiny, nothing could be done for her.\n\nThis S\u00farajbans family, like their relatives of K\u00e1sh\u00edpur, were noted, when in the hills, for physical strength and proficiency in manly sports; but they have fallen away immensely since their descent to the plains. To use the words of the K\u00e1sh\u00edpur r\u00e1ja; \"We have lost nearly a cubit in each generation; my grandfather was nearly five cubits, my father four, and I am the mannikin you see.\" Another noteworthy point is the good fortune which has raised the family to their present position. Two generations back they were suppliants to the neighbouring chief for a morsel of bread, and were without the smallest legal title or military strength. First they enlisted and fought under the British standard; one got a perpetual pension of Rs. 2,400, which was followed by the grant of a large estate in pargana Palia to Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l S\u00e1h; then R\u00e1j Ganga S\u00e1h occupied Kanchanpur, stretching for ninety miles north of the Moh\u00e1n; shortly afterwards Khairigarh, comprising 450 square miles, fell almost without a struggle after a fight which, in America, would hardly be dignified by the name of a riot. In 1858 the r\u00e1ja, who had not the smallest expectation of receiving the estate from a British law court, and who had been actively deporting the tenantry to Kanchanpur, was admitted to be the rightful owner of Khairigarh and a r\u00e1ja of Oudh.\n\nIn 1859 Kanchanpur, which had belonged to Naip\u00e1l up till 1814, was again transferred to that state. The R\u00e1ja of Khairigarh, whose title originated in the murder of the Brahman proprietor, was compensated by the grant of a forfeited estate in Dhaurahra, 78 square miles in extent, and now estimated to yield an annual rental of Rs. 82,000.\n\nIt is a sufficient commentary on the supposed preference of Indians for native rule that, in this instance, all the S\u00farajbans family, many of whom had no ties of property in Khairigarh, have settled in Khairigarh,\nabandoning Kanchanpur entirely, since it was included in Naip\u00e1l. This S\u00farajbans family consists of about twenty gentlemen of very considerable ability and culture, good sportsmen, fair landlords, and all of active and energetic habits. They regret the loss of the Khairigarh forests, which in former times were common property, and which have now been appropriated by Government. The owners of Khairigarh, however, seem to have exercised no exclusive rights over this forest; the different r\u00e1jas of the neighbourhood constructed their kh\u00e9d\u00e1s and captured elephants without asking the permission of the Khairigarh r\u00e1jas, and without giving them any share of the spoil. The Oudh Government used also to lease the forest produce, and there are still extant many grants of concessions to cut wood here issued by the native rulers, so that the English Government has only taken what belonged to its predecessors.\n\n**KHAIRIGARH\u2014Pargana**\n\n**KHAIRIGARH\u2014Tahsil**\n\n**NIGH\u00c1SAN\u2014District**\n\n**Kh\u00e9ri.\u2014A town from which a pargana derives its name, situated on the left side of the Suheli river, having groves to the north and east. It is distant 110 miles north of Lucknow, and lies in latitude 28\u00b0 26\u2032, longitude 80\u00b0 41\u2032.**\n\nTeiffenthaler, describing its condition about eighty years ago, states it to be a fortified place, worthy of note as well on account of its excellent construction as of its size, being four or five miles in circuit. The defences are built of huge blocks of stone below, and above of bricks of unusual size, but it now lies waste and infested with tigers and other wild beasts. It was built by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Tughlaq Shah on a site well chosen to check the mountaineers who might plunder Oudh from Kumaun or Naip\u00e1l. The town is two miles north-east of the great fort, the intervening space being overgrown with trees and grassy jungle, the lair of beasts of prey. Khairigarh belongs to R\u00e1ja Indra Bikram S\u00e1h. The population amounts to 1,135.\n\n**KHAJURAHR\u00c1\u2014Pargana**\n\n**BANGAR\u2014Tahsil**\n\n**HARDOI\u2014District**\n\n**HARDOI.\u2014Khajurahra (population 3,305, chiefly Cham\u00e1rs).**\n\nThe central village of the Khajurahra taluqa of Th\u00e1kur L\u00e1lta Bakhsh Chamar Gaur, 6 miles south from Hardoi, in pargana Bangar, tahs\u00edl and district Hardoi, 536 mud houses.\n\nA petty market is held on Mondays and Thursdays in the adjacent hamlet of Sathri.\n\nKhajurahra has been held by the Chamar Gaurs ever since their ancestor Ganga Singh, surnamed K\u00e1na (one-eyed), drove out the Thatheras. See B\u00e1wan (pargana).\n\n**KHAND\u00c1NSA Pargana\u2014Tahsil**\n\n**BYKAPUR\u2014District**\n\n**FYZABAD.\u2014This pargana lies along the north bank of the Gumti, bordered by Bara Banki district on the west. It contains 128 villages covering 116 square miles, of which 65 are cultivated. Its population is 70,905, being at the rate of 611 to the square mile. Of these 66,698 are Hindus, and only 4,207, or**\n\n*By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nbarely three per cent., Musalmans. The history of the formation of this pargana is complicated, and the official account which follows is detailed. It will appear that Khand\u00e1nsa proper was in Rudauli up to annexation; it was then included as a separate pargana in Bara Banki, and in 1860 it was transferred to Fyzabad, the 26 villages of pargana Jagd\u00edspur, district Sultanpur, which lay north of the river Gumti, being added to it, and the whole called Khand\u00e1nsa.\n\nTradition says that about 600 years ago one Kh\u00e1nde, a Bhar, while on a pilgrimage to Ajodhya with his brothers, happened to come to the neighbourhood of the present Khand\u00e1nsa, and finding it fertile and uninhabited took possession of it and founded four villages\u2014Khand\u00e1nsa, Urwah, Bhakauli, and Dehli Girdhar, calling them after his own and his brothers' names, Kh\u00e1nde, Ori, Bhikhu, Girdhar. In the reign of Pirthi R\u00e1e, or R\u00e1e Pithaura, R\u00e1ja of Hastin\u00e1pur or Delhi, this tract was entered in official records as Khand\u00e1nsa, and was divided into the four tappas named after the four villages above referred to. This continued until the time of Akbar, when Todar Mal abolished the \"tappabandi\" arrangement and constituted Khand\u00e1nsa a pargana. Thenceforward it was called pargana Khand\u00e1nsa, il\u00e1qa Rudauli, until the introduction of British rule in February, 1856 A.D. Between that date and the out-break of the mutiny no administrative arrangements were completed, but on the restoration of tranquillity in 1858 A.D. a settlement was made, and Khand\u00e1nsa continued to be a separate pargana, consisting of 113 villages, with a revenue of Rs. 32,695, and was included in the Bara Banki district.\n\nAt annexation, Captain Orr, who had previously held a military command under the Oudh Government, and been stationed at Sultanpur, was appointed deputy commissioner of the district of that name, and directed to make a summary settlement of it. Before pargana boundaries had been determined, an order was issued that the Gumti should form the boundary between the Sultanpur and Fyzabad districts, all the lands to the north of the river being included in the latter. Accordingly 26 villages, forming three muh\u00e1s, and paying a revenue of Rs. 6,440, were (together with 162 villages of pargana Isauli, with a revenue of Rs. 5,690-7-3, and all the villages of Sultanpur Baraunsa on the north of the Gumti) thrown into the Bharth\u00e1pur tahsil in the Fyzabad district.\n\nAt the adjustment of pargana boundaries about 1860, 112 out of the 113 villages of pargana Khand\u00e1nsa, with a revenue of Rs. 32,515, together with nine villages of parganas Rudauli and Muhammadpur in tahsil Rudauli paying Rs. 4,310, were taken out of the Bara Banki district, and with the 26 above referred to formed into a new pargana, Jagd\u00edspur, which thus consisted of 147 villages (ultimately demarcated as 100) assessed at Rs. 43,265. An interchange of a few villages with adjacent parganas subsequently took place, which resulted in leaving Khand\u00e1nsa with 153 villages (demarcated as 118) and a revenue of Rs. 46,454. This lasted till the re-constitution of districts in 1869 A.D., when by certain changes it was made to consist of 128 (demarcated) villages with a revenue of Rs. 506,07. The pargana which had hitherto been in the Bharth\u00e1pur tahsil, was now included in the newly formed one of Biskapur.\nRivers.\u2014The pargana is traversed by two rivers. The Gumti, coming from the direction of Lucknow on the west, after leaving the pargana, flows on eastward to Jaunpur. Ferries are established at various places in this part of its course. The Madha issues from a large jhil near Basorhi, in the Bara Banki district, and flowing thence through the Rudauli, Khandansa, and Pachhimrath parganas receives different names in different portions of its course. In this pargana it is called the Madha, in Akbarpur the Tons, and further east the Tamsa. In the Khandansa pargana, it has for a long time past been a rain stream only, and the water being used for irrigation after November its bed is dry all the rest of the year.\n\nHistory. The Bisens.\u2014From an early period this pargana was a Bhar principality, and it remained so until one Deo Rae, a Bisen of Manjhauli, who was in the service of the then government, happened to stop here on his way to bathe in the Ganges. During his stay a quarrel arose between him and the Bhars at Bakhiali, which ended in his putting them to the sword and taking possession of the Bakhiali ilqa. Subsequently his descendants made themselves masters of tappas Urwa and Khandansa, with other adjacent villages in the Mangalsi and Muhammadpur parganas, of which, after the lapse of thirty-five generations, they are still zamindars.\n\nThe Chauhans.\u2014The Chauhans in this pargana are a branch of the great family which held 565 villages in Pachhimrath, Isauli, Khandansa; their history is given under Pachhimrath. In this pargana they have not been so much reduced, as they formerly had thirty-two villages, and now have twenty-five in proprietary possession. The present is the 25th generation from the founder; they too drove out Rajbhars and acquired their inheritance. Some Musalman converts from the family are called Khanzadas, and occupy Sirseda.\n\nThe Bhale Sultans.\u2014Rao Mardan Singh, Bais of Daundia Khera, in Baiswara, was a horse-dealer by profession. He chanced to visit Gajanpur, in the Isauli pargana, in the Sultanpur district, where there was a fort of the Rajbhars, and stopped there for some time. A quarrel and fight took place, in which he obtained the victory and became master of the Bhar domains. His son Rao Barar entered the service of the king of Delhi, and as he was a good rider and a clever spearman he obtained the name Bhale Sultan. He had two wives by one he had issue Raja Jai Krishn, whose descendants are zamindars of Dada, in pargana Isauli; and by the other Kunwar, Dadhich, and Baram Deo. The eldest of these was called the raja, and as their descendants increased and multiplied, they overran five kos in the Isauli pargana and nine in that of Khandansa, or in all fourteen kos. Baram Deo, the youngest of the three, separating from his brothers, settled in a village which he founded in the jungle on the banks of the Gumti, and called after himself Deogion. Ambitious of obtaining the title of raja, he became khanzad of the king of Delhi, and since then his descendants have been called khanzadas. Of Rao Barar's descendants the heads of two branches continued to bear the title of raja until 1257 fasli, viz., Raja Bhure Khan, brother of Azam Ali Khan, now lambardar, and Raja Ali Bakhsh, and besides these Babu Muhammad Husen Khan and Babu Gulzar Khan also held taluqas; but in that\nyear R\u00e1ja Bh\u00fare Khan, in punishment for his ill-treatment of his tenantry, was transported beyond seas by the king and the resident, and his estate was made over to B\u00e1bu Jamshed Ali Khan, son of Azam Ali Khan, and since then R\u00e1ja Ali Bakhsh Khan only has borne the title of r\u00e1ja., the heads of the other three branches being known as b\u00e1b\u00fas.\n\nThe estates they held were as follows:\u2014\n\n| R\u00e1ja Ali Bakhsh Khan | ... Mahona. |\n| B\u00e1bu Muhammad Husen Gulz\u00e1r Khan | ... Kachhl\u00e1n. |\n| \" Mad\u00e1r Bakhsh | ... Lilha Ras\u00e1lpur. |\n| \" Jamshed Ali | ... Deog\u00e1on. |\n\nAfter the mutiny B\u00e1bu Mad\u00e1r Bakhsh and B\u00e1bu Gulz\u00e1r Khan failed to put in an appearance before the Government officers, and their estates were in consequence confiscated and conferred on loyal grantees. B\u00e1bu Azam Ali Khan still holds the Deog\u00e1on estate, consisting of ten villages. Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh, Sangald\u00edpi Brahman, acquired five villages in the pargana between 1235 and 1260 Fa\u0161li; Chaudhri Ghul\u00e1m Far\u00edd has obtained several villages from the zamindars by purchase, mortgage, and other means.\n\nMusalmans.\u2014Muhammadans have only recently possessed any property in land in this pargana. In the reign of \u00c1sif-ud-daula, Shah Ahmad Zam\u00e1n, superintendent of Makhdum Shah Abdul Haq\u2019s dargah, received half the village of Saidkhanpur or Saidkha as a revenue-free grant for the defrayal of expenses connected with the dargah. The descendants of the grantee still hold, and the grant has been confirmed to them in perpetuity by Government. They also hold Zafarnagar, which they acquired by purchase from the K\u00e1yath proprietors.\n\nFairs.\u2014Two fairs annually are held at Sirseth in honour of \u00c1stik Rikh, in commemoration of the Rikh having saved a snake from the hands of R\u00e1ja Jaimijai. One is held in S\u00e1wan (7th to 9th of the month), the other in Bh\u00e1don, for one day. In the latter 2,000 or 3,000 people congregate.\n\nB\u00e1wan fair.\u2014On the north of this village there is a jhil and a mound. About 15 years ago Pandit Indra Datt, parohit (family priest) of the old zamindars, and an astrological and vedic scholar, pointed out that, according to the Ajodhya Mahatam, the village contained the cell, shiw\u00e1la, and th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra of Bandeo Rikh, and on excavation being made, traces of the two latter were discovered, with figures of Th\u00e1kur, Mah\u00e1deo, and Ganesh; and since then a religious fair has been held on the day of Rikh Panchmi, in the year in which a month is intercalated. About 4,000 people assemble. The fair lasts all day.\n\nDeog\u00e1on.\u2014In early days this spot was all jungle, inhabited by a recluse, Niddhi Chand, a N\u00e1nak Sh\u00e1hi faq\u00edr. He was subsequently joined by one Sundar Shah, a Majzub,* who having wandered there by chance took up his abode permanently. After his death a dargah was established, and rent-free land was given for its maintenance. A fair is held here from the 7th to the 11th of the month of P\u00fas which is attended by about 10,000 people. A little trade is done, chiefly in metal vessels.\n\n* \"Majzub,\" a crazy religious mendicant.\nBazars.\u2014There are ten bazars in the pargana, eight of which are always open, the others only on market days. Am\u00e1niganj, founded by Nawab Asif-ud-daula, who when a boy was called Mirza Am\u00e1n\u00ed; principal market day Thursday. Rae Patti, on Wednesday and Saturday. P\u00fara Bh\u00edkhi, Sursampur, Baqarganj, P\u00fara Sidhari, Nawau, Angrauli. The others are of no importance; no details of the sales are given.\n\nThere are no indigo factories in the pargana, and the soil is less suited for the crop than that of Haweli Oudh. Sugarcane is grown by all castes, except the Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1ns; in Deog\u00f3n. About 2,500 local bighas are occupied by this crop. These produce 25,000 local maunds of raw sugar (gur), which is sent to Rudauli, Fyzabad, and Sultanpur. Fine sugar (chini) is not made in the pargana. Cotton is grown to a very limited extent, and yields only 5 or 6 seers to a local bigha. Opium is little cultivated, about 400 bighas only, which yield about 8 seers a local bigha, are devoted to it, the cultivators being Mur\u00e1os and Brahmans. There are no four-bullock carts in the pargana. Landowners have about 75 two-bullock ones, and these are employed for agricultural purposes only. Weavers are very few in number, and the total number of looms does not exceed one hundred. Country cloths only, such as garha, adhotar, are made, and these are taken for sale to neighbouring bazars.\n\nThe remains of Bhar forts are to be found at Sirsend, Bakhiali, and Jarayyan. This pargana was the haunt formerly of Jagann\u00e1th chaprasi, who is described as follows by Sleeman:\n\n\"Jugurnath chuprasee, a Bhala Soltan Rajpoot. This is one of the most formidable of the leaders of banditti in this and the adjoining district of Jugdeespor. He and his elder brother Surubdowun Sing were chuprasees on the establishment of Captain Paton when he was the First Assistant at Lucknow, and had charge of the post-office, in addition to his other duties. A post-office runner was one night robbed on the road, and Jugurnath was sent out to inquire into the circumstances. The amil of the district gave him a large bribe to misrepresent the case to his master; and as he refused to share this bribe with his fellow-servants, they made known his manifold transgressions to Captain Paton, who forthwith dismissed him.\n\n\"Surubdowun Sing was soon after dismissed for some other offence, and they both retired to their estate of Oskamow, in the Jugdeespor district.\n\n\"This estate comprised fifteen villages. They obtained the leases of these villages by degrees, through the influence which their position at the Residency gave them. As soon as they got the lease of a village they proceeded to turn out all the old proprietors and cultivators, in order the better to secure possession in perpetuity; and those among them of the military class fought 'to the death' to retain or recover possession of their rights. To defend what they had iniquitously acquired, Jugurnath and his brothers collected together bands of the most desperate ruffians in the country and located them in the several villages, so as to be able to concentrate and support each other at a concerted signal. The ousted proprietors\nattacked only those who presumed to reside in or cultivate the lands of which they had been robbed; but Jugurnath and his brethren were less scrupulous, and as they could afford to pay such bands in no other way, they gave them free license to plunder all the villages around and all travellers on the highway. Their position and influence at the Residency enabled them to deter the local authorities from exposing their iniquities, and they went on till the villages became waste and converted into dens of robbers.\n\n\"They were in all six brothers, and they found their new trade so profitable and exciting that they all became leaders of banditti by profession long before the dismissal of the two brothers from the Residency, though no one, I believe, ventured to prefer charges against them to the Resident or the Durbar. Soon after their dismissal, however, Jugurnath one night attacked and murdered his eldest brother Surubdowun Sing in order to get the whole estate to himself, and put his widow and daughter into prison. His other four brothers became alarmed, separated from him, and set up each his separate gang. But Jugurnath contrived soon after in a dark night to shoot the third brother, Himmut, dead with one ball through the chest.\n\n\"Purmode Sing, the youngest brother, was soon after shot dead by some villagers whose cattle he was driving off in a night attack. Bhugwunt Sing, the fourth, and Byjonath still survive, and have gangs of their own, afraid to trust themselves with Jugurnath, who has built two forts, Oskamow and Futtchpore, in the Jugdeespore district, and a third in two small villagers which he has lately seized upon and made waste in the Rodowlee district, in order that he may have a stronghold to fly to when pressed by the governors of other districts.\n\n\"They pay no rent or revenue to Government for any of the villages they hold. The king's officers are afraid to demand any from them. They have plundered a great many villages, and are every month plundering others. They have murdered a great many persons of both sexes and all ages, and tortured more into paying ransoms in proportion to their supposed means. Jugurnath is still the terror of the surrounding country, and a reward of five hundred rupees has been offered for his apprehension.\"* Sleeman's Tour in Oudh, vol.

It is bounded on the north by the river Moh\u00e1n, separating it from Naip\u00e1l, on the east by the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la, on the south by the district of Sitapur, on the west by the river Sukheta, and an artificial boundary dividing it from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. It lies between 28\u00b039' and 27\u00b041' north latitude, and between 80\u00b04' and 81\u00b018' east longitude. It is ninety-one miles long from Mall\u00e1pur to the western extremity of pargana Palia, and seventy-one miles broad along the western side, diminishing to a point at Mall\u00e1pur. In fact, it is an irregular triangle, two of whose sides are detailed above; the third, the southern, extends eighty-two miles along the north border of the Sitapur and Hardoi districts; the base is on the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district, the terminal angle at Mall\u00e1pur, where the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la and Chauka rivers unite. Its total area is 2,987* square miles, of which 650 are covered with forest, 1,047 grassy savannahs or bush jungle, and only 1,290 cultivated. The population amounts to 746,350. The general slope is from north-west to south-east, the highest elevation being in the forest south of the Moh\u00e1n, 600 feet above the sea, and the lowest on the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la, opposite Mall\u00e1pur, an altitude of only 375 feet. A useful list of elevations is given in tabular form:\n\nList of places with their elevation above the sea in the Kheri and neighbouring districts.\n\n| Towns                  | Elevation |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Dudhu Gh\u00e1t in Kheri   | 585       |\n| Mall\u00e1ni               | 556       |\n| Gola Gokarann\u00e1th     | 502       |\n| Mitaul                | 487       |\n| Aurangabad            | 485       |\n| Kaimahra              | 484       |\n| Lakhimpur             | 483       |\n\n* The Settlement Officer makes it 3,000.\nList of places with their elevation above the sea in the Kheri and neighbouring districts.\n\n| Towns                                      | Elevation |\n|--------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Mau in Kheri                               | 482       |\n| Palla                                      | 481       |\n| Bel                                        | 479       |\n| Oel                                        | 467       |\n| Gulrahapur on the Kathna                   | 454       |\n| Aliapur on the Gumti                       | 451       |\n| Gop\u00e1lapur                                  | 441       |\n| Machhrehts in Sitapur                      | 438       |\n| Khairabad ditto                            | 437       |\n| Padri in Kheri                             | 436       |\n| Bh\u00e1wapur                                   | 428       |\n| S\u00e1ldapur                                   | 425       |\n| Dhaurahra                                  | 425       |\n| Bhita Dhaurahra                            | 413       |\n| Ya\u00e1nagar                                   | 412       |\n| Ojha Purwa                                 | 410       |\n| Tambaur in Sitapur                         | 400       |\n| River Kauri\u00e1la opposite Ya\u00e1nagar           | 399       |\n| M\u00e1njha on Kauri\u00e1la near Mall\u00e1pur           | 387       |\n| Kauri\u00e1la river at Mall\u00e1pur in Sitapur      | 375       |\n\nThe character of the district varies much with the situation. It consists of a number of fairly elevated plateaus, separated by rivers flowing from the north-west, and each bordered by belts, more or less broad, of low alluvial land; there are no mountains or hills.\n\n**Rivers.**\u2014The rivers are (commencing from the east) the Kauri\u00e1la, the Suheli, the Dah\u00e1war, the Chauka, the Ul, the Jamw\u00e1ri, the Kathna, the Gumti, and the Sukheta. North of the Ul the country is generally styled tar\u00e1i and considered very unhealthy; but it would be a mistake to suppose that the whole is one vast expanse of low-lying ground covered with swamps and thickets. The fact is that the country is rather an elevated plateau, formerly probably the bottom of a lake; through which two huge rivers, the Kauri\u00e1la and the Chauka, have for thousands of years been forcing their way. These two rivers change their courses constantly, abandoning old channels and opening up new; consequently the whole surface is seamed with many abandoned river beds much below the level of the surrounding country. In these the vegetation is very dense, and the stagnant water breeds fevers all around; but they will in time be drained, as their level is much above that of the Kauri\u00e1la.\n\nThe people are forced to reside in the neighbourhood of these low grounds because the upper lands being covered with forest, would be more expensive to cultivate, and are less fertile. There are, for instance, in Kheri about 300 square miles of s\u00e1l forest, which is never met with except on high ground. In the Dhaurahra, Srinagar, and Bh\u00far parganas also the rivers have occasionally eaten away north or south for years together, sweeping off the crumbling soil, and leaving behind them great expanses of alluvial bottom, gradually to be raised again by deposits; but, as a rule, it may be stated that north of the Ul, in Bh\u00far, Falia, Khairigarh,\nand Kukra Mail\u00e1ni, the land is not low, though the people cluster together in the low spots, being too few and feeble to subdue the forests on the uplands. Cultivation is scanty; ploughed land, which is known to purify the atmosphere, is small in area compared with that covered by forest and jungle. There is nothing therefore in the level of the country to render the water stagnant and the air unhealthy; the causes of the great mortality in Kheri are more probably the forests, the heavy rainfall, the wretched houses and food of the people.\n\nSouth of the Ul we find, indeed, that the great rivers have ceased to sweep off cultivation, and leave pestilent swamps behind; but here we meet another feature. Between each pair of rivers there is a plain, more or less broad, considerably less elevated than the so-called tar\u00e1i to the north. There is very little slope in any of these plains for many miles, and marshes are formed, from which emerge the head-waters of various small secondary streams. Thus between the Ul and the Kathna rises the Kew\u00e1ni, the Jamw\u00e1ri, the Sar\u00e1yan, the Pirai, which flow down the plateaus, and become not only dangerous torrents to cross in the rains, but devastating floods. Between the Kathna and Gumti the plateau slopes on each side, and the drainage is into those rivers; but beyond the Gumti appear the Ch\u00facha and the Sukheta, the latter rising a few miles out of the district. Speaking broadly, there their is no watershed between the Chauka and the R\u00e1mganga in north-west Oudh. The country consists of a plateau sloping longitudinally, and drained by a number of small streams, most of which join the Ganges further down.\n\nThe Ul, Gumti, and Chauka are practically useless for purposes of irrigation, except on the low levels of their alluvial banks, and the smaller streams are almost equally useless, because in the dry season their beds contain no water, while, owing to the porous nature of the subsoil, embankments in most places do not serve to retain the water.\n\nLakes.\u2014There are very few lakes north of the Ul, but in Paila, Haidarabad, and Kheri numerous large sheets of water occur. The largest, which is at Simri in Paila, is about two miles in diameter either way; in Kheri pargana, at Gumchini and Muhammadabad, are fine sheets of water, and a large jh\u00edl borders the village of Sikandarabad. The average depth is about three feet, and all are navigable by small boats hollowed out of trunks of trees. There is no lake or marsh cultivation except that of the singh\u00e1ra or waternut. They are not used for irrigation. North of the Ul, at Ramia Bihar, in the Dhaurahra, beyond Tirkaulia in the Palia pargana, and at Matera there are in curves of the ancient channels of the Kauri\u00e1la and S\u00e1rda fine sheets of water from ten to twenty feet deep, from three to four miles long, and in some places fringed with magnificent groves. These lakes are locally called 'lhagghar.' There are no river-side towns, nor do the villages adjoining contain any number of persons who live by fishing or river traffic. At the ferries on the Chauka and Kauri\u00e1la, particularly Pachperi, merchants encamp during the cold weather and buy up grain, departing before the rains commence.\n\nInundations.\u2014The Chauka overflows its banks for many miles, as elsewhere stated,* during the rains, the sheet of water thus formed extend-\n\n* See article \"Chauka.\"\ning from Pachperi Gh\u00e1t to Matera, a distance of ten miles. Annually the lower lands are swept for hundreds of square miles by this destructive river. Srinagar, Dhaurahra, Firozabad, and part of Bh\u00far are invaded (see the account of those parganas and of the Chauka). It needs embankment. The Kauri\u00e1la does little harm, its current being slower and its banks higher. The Gumti and Ul have done some damage, but it appears probable that much of this is due to recent road-making and insufficient waterway left in the bridges. The Kathna, the Moh\u00e1n, the Sukheta, and the Suheli do no injury. Kheri possesses enormous river power, which is not utilized in any way, except to a very trifling extent for irrigation. The Kauri\u00e1la has a minimum dry-weather discharge of 13,700 cubic feet per second, the S\u00e1rda of 7,300 cubic feet, the Gumti of 300 cubic feet, and the Suheli of about 150 cubic feet.\n\nForests.\u2014The whole north of the district is covered with huge forests, which occupy the greater part of Khairigarh and Kukra Mail\u00e1ni, and the western extremities of Palia and Bh\u00far. These woods are continued along the banks of the rivers, penetrating far into the districts of Hardoi and Sitapur. For instance, commencing at the junction of the Kathna with the Gumti in the Sitapur district, the traveller might follow the bank of the river towards the north through continuous forest for many days' march, and striking direct north through Kukra Mail\u00e1ni would reach the Naip\u00e1l mountains, a distance of 120 miles, without ever seeing cultivated land. The eastern bank of the Gumti also exhibits patches of forest almost to Muhamdi, and the woods are unbroken along the Ul till within eight miles of Lakh\u00edmpur. The Kauri\u00e1la and the Chauka flow generally between banks covered with jh\u00e1o coppices scattered at intervals in vast prairies of lofty grass.\n\nThe forests proper of Kheri cover 650 square miles, exclusive of the bushy prairies above referred to. Of this area 303 square miles (278 in Khairigarh and 25 in Bh\u00far) were in 1861 taken possession of by Government and preserved as forest lands, to provide materials for public buildings and arsenals. The remainder, 347 square miles, was divided into lots of 5,000 acres or less and given to men of supposed enterprise, who were to hold it rent-free for twenty years, and then pay only half the Government revenue payable for similar land. The only conditions were that they had to cut down a quarter of the forest, and bring a quarter of the land under cultivation within twelve years. Some grants were sold outright at an upset price of Rs. 2-8-0 per acre. Hardly any of these forest leasees either brought the forest under cultivation under the first set of conditions, or paid up the due instalments of their purchase-money under the second, and consequently grants of forest covering more than 120 square miles were resumed by the State, whose forests now cover 423 square miles, while private individuals hold in all 227, little of which has been brought under the plough.\n\nOf the whole forest land about two-thirds are covered with s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta). In the Khairigarh forest the trees are of large size, there being more than ten to each acre, with a girth of over four and a half feet. The forests north of the Moh\u00e1n consist mainly of s\u00e1l and as\u00edn (Terminalia tormentosa). The banks of the Suheli are fringed with glittering\ngreen sh\u00edsham trees (Dalbergia sissoo); above them masses of khair (Acacia catechu), with bare branches and stiff grey rugged trunks, and beyond them again the s\u00e1l forests\u2014masses of tall slender straight stems, the young trees bursting out from the very root with little bunches of green leaves, the old trees shooting up for sixty or seventy feet without a branch or bend. In addition to the forest there are fifty-five square miles of groves very evenly distributed over the whole district. Where there is no forest, as in Kheri, they are spacious and numerous, covering five per cent. of the area; where forest adjoins, as in Palia and Khairigarh, the artificial groves are not one-half per cent. of the total area. The groves consist generally of mango, and a few of sh\u00edsham. Mahua is hardly grown at all, not being used in Kheri for the manufacture of spirit, but it is found wild in the forests.\n\nThe fertility of the soil is so uniform that only thirty-seven square miles, or little more than one per cent. of the total area, are recorded as barren in the survey records. Much of this also is covered with brushwood and bab\u00fal trees useful for fuel.\n\nThe following is a list of the more common trees and plants found in the Kheri district\u2014\n\n| Acacia arabica (Babul.) | Dalbergia latifolia (Sh\u00edsham.) |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Acacia catechu (Khair.) | Emblica officinalis (Aonla.)   |\n| Egler marmelos (Hel.)   | Mangifera indica (Am., Mango.) |\n| Bassia latifolia (Mahua.) | Nelumbo speciosum (Kanwal, Kewal, Lotus.) |\n| Butea frondosa (Dh\u00e1k, Pal\u00e1s.) | Salmalia malabarica (Semal, cotton-tree.) |\n| Calotropis Hamiltoni (Mad\u00e1r.) | Shorea robusta (S\u00e1kh\u00fa, S\u00e1l.) |\n| Cathartocarpus Roxburghii.

The heat is less than that of the surrounding districts. The mean annual temperature during the last five years has been 79\u00b060; but the average heat at 2 P.M., the hottest period of the day in May 1870, the hottest month, was only 94; the average for the province being 104. In the sun\u2019s rays the temperature reaches 137. The following tables of temperature and account of the diseases common to Kheri have been furnished by an officer of the district, but in some respects they are not quite reliable\u2014\n\nAbstract of meteorological register for 1871.\n\n| Months | Standard Thermometer in Shade | Remarks |\n|--------|-------------------------------|---------|\n|        | Mean. | Highest and dates. | Lowest and dates. |\n| January | ---   | 62\u00b00 | 1st and 31st | 4th |\n| February | --- | 70\u00b06 | 11th | 18th |\n| March | --- | 79\u00b06 | 29th and 30th | 4th and 5th |\nAbstract of meteorological register for 1871.\n\n| Months | Standard Thermometer in Shade |\n|--------|-------------------------------|\n|        | Mean. | Highest and dates. | Lowest and dates. | Remarks |\n| April  | ...   | 89\u00b73 | 11th and 12th | 25th | 76\u00b70 |\n| May    | ...   | 89\u00b72 | 20th | 22nd | 77\u00b70 |\n| June   | ...   | 91\u00b73 | 2nd and 3rd | 29th | 82\u00b74 |\n| July   | ...   | 85\u00b73 | 2nd | 23rd | 79\u00b74 |\n| August | ...   | 85\u00b79 | 7th and 14th | 24th and 31st | 80\u00b74 |\n| September | ... | 85\u00b77 | 2nd | 17th | 77\u00b74 |\n| October | ... | 84\u00b71 | 3rd, 5th and 6th | 27th, 28th & 31st | 76\u00b70 |\n| November | ... | 74\u00b70 | 1st | 27th | 65\u00b70 |\n| December | ... | 63\u00b78 | 1st | 18th | 55\u00b70 |\n\nTable of thermometrical observations.\n\n| Months       | In shade | Maximum | Medium | Minimum | In sun's rays | Maximum | Medium | Minimum |\n|--------------|----------|---------|--------|---------|--------------|---------|--------|---------|\n| November, 1866 | ...      | 78\u00b0     | 65\u00b0    | 53\u00b0     | 110\u00b0         | 96\u00b0     | 83\u00b0    |\n| December     | ...      | 70\u00b0     | 57\u00b75\u00b0  | 48\u00b0     | 95\u00b0          | 80\u00b0     | 65\u00b0    |\n| January, 1867 | ...      | 67\u00b0     | 57\u00b75\u00b0  | 48\u00b0     | 89\u00b0          | 84\u00b75\u00b0   | 80\u00b0    |\n| February     | ...      | 74\u00b0     | 59\u00b75\u00b0  | 48\u00b0     | 98\u00b0          | 88\u00b75\u00b0   | 82\u00b0    |\n| March        | ...      | 83\u00b0     | 71\u00b75\u00b0  | 60\u00b0     | 120\u00b0         | 104\u00b75\u00b0  | 89\u00b0    |\n| April        | ...      | 94\u00b0     | 82\u00b0    | 70\u00b0     | 130\u00b0         | 112\u00b75\u00b0  | 95\u00b0    |\n| May          | ...      | 100\u00b0    | 88\u00b0    | 76\u00b0     | 137\u00b0         | 118\u00b0    | 95\u00b0    |\n| June         | ...      | 100\u00b0    | 90\u00b0    | 80\u00b0     | 130\u00b0         | 101\u00b0    | 81\u00b0    |\n| July         | ...      | 90\u00b0     | 85\u00b75\u00b0  | 81\u00b0     | 120\u00b0         | 102\u00b0    | 84\u00b0    |\n| August       | ...      | 90\u00b0     | 85\u00b75\u00b0  | 81\u00b0     | 110\u00b0         | 100\u00b0    | 90\u00b0    |\n| September    | ...      | 90\u00b0     | 81\u00b75\u00b0  | 73\u00b0     | 121\u00b0         | 102\u00b0    | 83\u00b0    |\n| October      | ...      | 85\u00b0     | 77\u00b75\u00b0  | 70\u00b0     | 120\u00b0         | 109\u00b75\u00b0  | 99\u00b0    |\n\nThe rainfall is above the average of the province. Cold winds following the course of the rivers emerge from the Naip\u00e1l plateaus through the mountain gorges, and meeting the already saturated atmosphere of the plains cool it, and precipitate moisture first on the lowlands at their base. The hot vapours from the plains are also cooled by the vast forests which clothe the uplands; and being no longer able to carry so much water discharge it in rain. The extraordinary difference in the rainfall of successive years is unaccountable. In one year this district receives far above\nthe provincial average, which was to be expected; but in 1868 the average in Oudh was 38 inches, when Kheri, close to the forest and the Himalayas, had only 30. The following table exhibits the rainfall for eleven successive years:\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1865  | 51\u00b70   |\n| 1866  | 33\u00b70   |\n| 1867  | 63\u00b73   |\n| 1868  | 30\u00b74   |\n| 1869  | 42\u00b78   |\n| Average for eleven years | ... |\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1870  | 70\u00b72   |\n| 1871  | 69\u00b72   |\n| 1872  | 44\u00b79   |\n| 1873  | 28\u00b70   |\n| 1874  | 57\u00b71   |\n| 1875  | 30\u00b78   |\n|       | 47\u00b73   |\n\nThe accompanying table exhibits the rainfall for the last two years of drought, 1868 and 1873, each of which was followed, in 1869 and 1874 respectively by considerable scarcity. It will be noted that the entire rainfall was not scanty, but the distribution was capricious and unusual, and there was no rain during individual months in which it is much needed for agricultural purposes. There are four rainfalls, each of which must be propitious to secure a good harvest. First, the June rains, the former rains as they may be called. In 1873 there was only half an inch, not near enough to moisten the earth for the plough and to water the early rice. Second, the main monsoon, which begins in July and ends at the commencement of October. This was sufficient in both years; but the fall in September, 1873, was only 3\u00b71 inch, and it ceased too soon, viz., on September 15th. Third, the latter or October rains, which are required to water the late rice and moisten the land for the winter ploughings. These were wholly deficient in both years. Fourth, the January-February rains, which were wholly wanting in 1869, and in 1874 were two inches.\n\nSpeaking broadly, the rains commenced well in 1868, badly in 1873; they ended with a good fall in 1868, but too soon; in 1873; they were scanty for the last month, and ended still earlier in September. So far 1873 was much worse than 1868. Then there was absolutely no rain in either year from October till January, but in February there was no rain in 1869 and two inches in 1874.\n\n| Rainfall | 1868 | 1873 |\n|----------|------|------|\n| Rainfall from June 1st to October 1st | 28\u00b77 | 25\u00b76 |\n| Ditto from October 1st to December 31st | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b70 |\n| Ditto in June | 9\u00b73 | 0\u00b76 |\n| Ditto in September | 10\u00b72 | 3\u00b71 |\n| Ditto in October | 0\u00b70 | 0\u00b70 |\n| Date of rain commencing | June 11th | June 13th |\n| Ditto of rain ending | September 21st | September 15th |\n| Rain in January-February of ensuing year | 0\u00b701 | 2\u00b70 |\nHealth.\u2014The residents of the uparh\u00e1r* appear robust and energetic, and no sickness prevails there. There is nothing in the soil to produce sickness, and it is believed that the same soil extends up through the forest to the hills. Sickness will, no doubt, prevail for some years till the underwood and all the putrid leaves be removed. The water that stagnates over them, and percolates through the soil into the wells from which the people drink, the exhalations which arise from them tainting the air, and confined by the dense mass of the forest trees, the underwood, and high grass are the chief causes of the diseases which prevail in the jungles. It is, however, remarkable that there are two unhealthy seasons in the forest, one at the latter end of the rains in August, September, and October, and the other before the rains begin to fall in the latter part of April, the whole of May, and part of June. Those diseases which occur after the rains are caused by bad air, and those which occur immediately before the rains are created by bad water. Petroleum or liquid bitumen is found floating on the spring waters in the hot season, when the most fatal diseases burst out in the jungles; but whether the poisonous quality of the water be imparted to it by impure bitumen from below, or by the putrid leaves of the forest trees from above, is uncertain. The people drink from the spring waters at this season as well as from stagnant pools in the beds of small rivers which have ceased to flow during part of the cold and the whole of the hot season. These pools become filled with the leaves of the forest trees which overhang them. The bitumen arises from the coal measures pressed down by the overlying masses of sandstone strata of the Himalaya chain of mountains beyond the Tar\u00e1i forest. The putrid waters may possibly act both directly and through the medium of the air.\n\nThe disease most common in this district is intermittent fever, which appears to be endemic in the neighbourhood of Gokarann\u00e1th, and is caused by malaria produced apparently by the spontaneous decomposition of vegetable matter after the cessation of the monsoons, and by imperfect drainage. European and native constitutions suffer alike from its attacks. Spring fever appears mostly among those whose agrarian pursuits expose them to the noonday sun. It assumes a remittent type, and is proportionately more fatal as summer advances. Next in the order of frequency are bowel complaints. As a rule, they increase at harvest time, and have a fatal tendency when succulent fruit and vegetables become abundant in the market. Cholera became epidemic in this district during the rains of 1867, and was most fatal and persistent in those villages where filth most abounded. In Lakh\u00edmpur the scourge was apparently introduced on bazar days, or only occurred sporadically. Pulmonic and rheumatic affections increase in winter. Of cutaneous affections herpes deserves notice; it is very prevalent among the natives. It seems to be acquired from the practice of keeping on a dhoti while bathing, and replacing it by a clean one without drying the skin. The disease is seen chiefly about the hips and loins of those affected, and does not yield readily to the treatment generally adopted: strong acetic acid externally is the best remedy. Leprosy is not an uncommon disease. Goitre is most common among the trans-Chauka\n\n* Highlands.\npopulation. The quality of the water is supposed to be the cause of this disease. Its local distribution is unaccountably capricious, but, as a rule, the vast mass of the cases occur within two miles of the river bank, particularly in Dhaurahra and Palia parganas. Venereal diseases are common, and frequently seen in their secondary and tertiary forms, a fact attributable to neglect or improper treatment of the primary symptoms. Among ophthalmic disorders those most prevalent here are ophthalmia and nycatalopia; they occur principally in summer. Cataract among the aged is not uncommon. Dropsies of the skin and abdomen are often seen in subjects who have long suffered from paludal fever, and enlarged spleens.\n\nMortuary returns.\u2014Mortuary returns have been prepared in this as in other districts. There is no establishment for the purpose, and little confidence can be placed in them, except in one point, that they never exaggerate the mortality. According to them the deaths in Kheri in 1870 were 16,272, or 22 in a thousand of the entire population; but as the whole mortality of Oudh was only 17, which is clearly underrated by perhaps 50 per cent., it is probable that the deaths in Kheri likewise should be about 33 per cent. Even the 22 per cent. is the highest in the province. But, further, in all the other districts which exhibited a death-rate at all approaching this, as Rae Bareli, Sultanpur, epidemics either of cholera or small-pox were raging during the year in question. From these Kheri was free, and its high mortality was due entirely to the endemic fever which prevails for many months in each year. Fever carried off 14,638, or 20 per thousand of the entire population. Doubtless many of these would shortly have died from senile decay, but still the proportion of deaths from a disease which enfeebles for months fifty persons for one whom it kills, is most alarming in an economical point of view. In 1872 the deaths were 21,912, being at the rate of 29\u00b736 per mille, the provincial average being 16\u00b799; 19,968, or 90 per cent., were due to fever.\n\nThere were 23 dispensaries in Oudh in 1871; in all of them only 61 persons died of fever in that year, and 28 of the deaths were in the single dispensary of Gola in Dhaurahra, the only one which, from its position, could be attended by the inhabitants of the most fever-stricken tracts. As these dispensaries are only used by the people in their immediate neighbourhood, they convey no idea of the total district mortality, but they give a correct indication of the comparative virulence and extent of the disease. It cannot be doubted that the mortality caused by fever in Kheri is, in great measure, due to the bad food and bad clothing of the people. We have seen that deaths in Kheri are more numerous proportionately than in any other district, and that fever has attained the dimensions of a fearful plague. In the whole of Oudh cholera only carried off 16,032 in 1871, while fever took in Kheri alone 14,638, and almost 20,000 in 1872. The one kills 20 in the thousand annually, the other 1\u00bd per thousand. Such is the morbid state of the Kheri people as a whole; but on turning to a class of that people which we know is well lodged and fed\u2014i.e., the criminals in the jail\u2014we find that in 1871 they were actually the healthiest community of the kind in all Oudh. The deaths in Kheri jail were only 4\u00b79 per thousand, while the provincial average\nwas 24\u00b76, and no jail, small or large, in Oudh approached the minimum of mortality presented by Kheri. During the ten years ending 1868 the average jail mortality of the province was 85 in the thousand, but in Kheri jail only 45.\n\nThe above figures prove conclusively that when men are treated with the care and solicitude which the Oudh administration bestows upon its criminals, then Kheri, or a great part of it, is tolerably healthy; but that even freedom will not compensate for the bad food and clothing which the peasants of backward districts can alone procure. Perhaps it may be urged that 22 per thousand is, after all, no great mortality, and it is only an assumption that 50 per cent. should be added to that proportion; but another proof of the extreme sickness of Kheri may be brought forward, and this is, that 937 in the thousand of the policemen there stationed were admitted into hospital during the year. Of course a man is not allowed to enter the hospital unless wholly unfit for work, and we can gather how widespread and unfailing must be the maladies which disable annually, for a longer or shorter period, almost every man in the police force, composed of healthy able-bodied men, well paid and well clothed. The provincial average of admissions into police hospitals was only 387 in the thousand, and this is perhaps a fairer, because a more accurate, statement than any other of the comparative unhealthiness of the district. The health of the district will, no doubt, improve with the extension of cultivation, the clearing of the rank undergrowth, and the drainage of the jhilis.\n\nIt has been questioned whether the latter months are, after all, so prejudicial to health, but the sanitary officers are unanimous in the affirmative. It may be remarked that in 1871, 7,033 out of the 14,638 deaths in Kheri, or almost half, occurred during the three months of October, November, and December, when the waters of the marshes and shallow ponds were being drained off by evaporation; and these months are almost equally fatal throughout the remainder of Oudh. In 1872, similarly, 9,423 deaths out of 21,912 occurred during the same three months.\n\nTrue, the actual area recorded as under water in Kheri is only 137 square miles, little more than 4\u00bd per cent. of the whole; but this represents a very small proportion indeed of what is actually inundated during the rains, and the greater part of the three months in question. It is not uncommon in Kheri during the rains to travel in large boats for fourteen or fifteen miles over land which is entered in the Government records as high and dry. These transient waters were, of course, not included in the measurement; in fact they could not be, for when the survey operations commenced a number of men were despatched into the district north of the Ul in October and November: all were seized with fever, and a large proportion died. Subsequent measurements were therefore conducted after January, and the rain inundations, not being seen, were not entered. Nearly all these jhilis could be drained, as the Ul and Kauriala rivers flow far below their level, and it is hoped that they will be when canals or embankments supply other means of irrigation.\n\nCattle-disease.\u2014Connected with the subjects of health and marsh malaria is that of cattle-disease. Kheri had not suffered severely from this plague\ntill 1870. English settlers in the district bear evidence to the fact that it was practically unknown during the first nine years after annexation, and old native inhabitants, while admitting that human mortality was sometimes very great under native rule, deny that anything approaching the murrains now to be referred to ever occurred. The following remarks are drawn from notes taken at the time by the editor:\n\nThe principal disease is a virulent diarrhoea accompanied with swelling of the dewlap; but chaundhi\u00e1na, otherwise called chakkar or ghumni, has been very fatal over a limited area. Foot-and-mouth disease has not been virulent at all, and need not be referred to. Chaundhi\u00e1na seems to be something like \"stomach staggers;\" the animal refuses food, cannot void, turns round perpetually and dies in an interval varying from an hour to a day. The treatment consists in firing in parallel lines from the chest to the flank and round the eyes, and giving internal doses of the inspissated juice of three-year-old cowdung\u2014evidently merely a religious charm added by the Brahmans to the real treatment. Firing I have seen effectual in causing recovery, but I need not waste time on technical subjects of which I know nothing. One thing is clear: that the great cause of both diseases and of the mortality is the bad food grown on the marshes; the natives showed me particular poisonous plants in the marshes which the cattle ate greedily, but the bad rank grass is quite enough of itself. I do not think the village site has much to do with it; fine dry villages with lofty sites like Si\u00e1thu, Ramu\u00e1pur have suffered the most because the cattle grazed in the marshes beneath.*\n\nI append a list of villages observed by me in which the grazing was of this description, with the recorded mortality:\n\n| Village     | No. of deaths | Surviving | Remarks |\n|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------|\n|             | 1870          | 1871      |         |\n| Ahmadnagar  | ...           | 163       | 87      | 672     |\n| Haldarabad  | ...           | 263       | 56      | 426     |\n| Ahrori      | ...           | 80        | 1       | 70      |\n| Munda Bishun| ...           | 70        | 8       | 147     |\n| Mamri       | ...           | 300       | 51      | 349     |\n| Ramu\u00e1pur    | ...           | 130       | 129     | 165     |\n| Dh\u00e1ng\u00e1n     | ...           | 63        | 6       | 163     |\n| Dhar\u00e1w\u00e1n    | ...           | 31        | 35      | 58      |\n| Bel         | ...           | 30        | 10      | 60      |\n| Si\u00e1thu      | ...           | 100       | 15      | 190     |\n| **Total**   | ...           | **1,250** | **398** | **2,300** |\n\nThe diseases, except kora, are quite different from those mentioned by Dr. McLeod in the report on murrain. The principal symptoms not\n\n---\n\n* On this point see White's Veterinary Act, nineteenth edition, page 165.\n\n\"Before the moors were enclosed and drained staggers frequently happened; since hardly ever.\" The above refers to the horse, but cowpathology is fairly analogous I believe. Before I saw this I had noticed that wherever there were marshes, as around the head-waters of the Sar\u00e1yan, Jamw\u00e1ri, Kew\u00e1ni, in this district, cattle-disease was far more prevalent than elsewhere.\nmentioned by him are, great swelling of the dewlap, almost continuous and involuntary evacuations, as in the second stage of cholera, and the constant turning round while strength lasts. Further, the rains are the worst season instead of the best.\n\nStatistics of mortality\u2014I have obtained from the police officers the returns of cattle deaths for the month of October, 1871, the first for which regular record was kept. It appears that in five out of the seven th\u00e1nas the deaths amounted to 2,321 in one month, the sick being far more numerous of course. I have tested these returns, and am disposed to believe them generally correct. Of one thing I am perfectly certain: that the mortality in 1870 was at least three times greater than in 1871. It is hard to say which is the most deadly month. From inquiries, I believe August, September, and October to be about on a par, and to represent collectively about half the mortality of the year. Going upon this calculation the deaths in these five th\u00e1nas would be 7,000 for the three deadly months, 14,000 for the whole year 1871, and 42,000 for the year 1870, in these five th\u00e1nas; that is to say, 56,000 in the five th\u00e1nas and 78,000 for the entire district during 1871-74; but as returns were sent for only 364 villages out of 1,690, while disease prevailed in many places where it was not reported, we may fairly raise the 78,000 to 100,000 for the entire mortality.\n\nAnother calculation may be made. One-third to one-fifth of the whole cattle stock of the district is the proportion of losses by deaths asserted by the most respectable proprietors. Let us take one-fourth. Now the whole number of cattle in the district was 517,600 in 1860; it is probable therefore that 120,000 cattle, worth Rs. 12,00,000, have died during these two years 1870-71. I have calculated bullocks at Rs. 14 and cows at Rs. 6. It is apparent therefore that the two estimates of the mortality, one from actual census of individual villages, the other from the proportionate mortality, fairly agree. Another census was made of the plough cattle which died; this excludes calves and cows. It confirms the previous calculations, as it would appear that in Haidarabad and Magdapur parganas, in which the disease was most virulent, 44 per cent. of the cattle died.\n\nThe following table shows the number of cattle which died in parganas Muhamdi, Haidarabad, and Magdapur, district Kheri:\n\n| Name of pargana | No. of cattle died |\n|-----------------|-------------------|\n|                 | No. of cattle in last year | No. of cattle in the current year | Total No. of cattle died | No. of cattle remaining | Remarks |\n| Haidarabad      | 1,718             | 700                          | 2,418                      | 2,911                    |         |\n| Magdapur        | 156               | 212                          | 368                        | 542                      |         |\n| Muhamdi         | 289               | 374                          | 663                        | *891                     |         |\n| Total           | 2,163             | 1,286                        | 3,449                      | 4,344                    |         |\n\n* This return must be incorrect with reference to the surviving cattle of pargana Muhamdi; this return apparently includes only the plough cattle.\nThe police statistics are erroneous in so far that in some cases apparently the whole mortality of the season, i.e., the wet months, has been entered for October alone, but only in a few instances I think. A much more serious defect is that returns were given for only 364 villages out of 1,690. I know of enormous losses never reported. I have before me my own notes taken in more than 50 villages, and they support the calculation that one-fourth of the cattle have perished. So far as they go they are quite reliable, as every cultivator and his individual losses were counted up and verified before me.\n\n**Fauna.**\u2014The wild animals are those common to north Oudh. Black buck abound in Aurangabad, Magdapur, Atwa Piparia, everywhere between the Gumti and the Kathna, also across that river in Bhira. They are met with, but in smaller number, on the west bank of the Gumti and near the Sukheta, also on the watershed between the Kauriala and the Chauka from Dhaurahra by Nighasan to Palia. Spotted deer are found along both banks of the Kathna, and everywhere in the jungles of Kukra Mailani and Khairigarh. Nilgai abound along the banks of the Kauriala in Dhaurahra and Firozabad; on the Chauka near the villages Srinagar and Baragaoon the herds are enormous, and do a great deal of damage. They are tolerably numerous everywhere throughout the district, being preserved by the popular veneration in jungles such as Kauria, on the Ul, in the midst of high cultivation and dense population. Hog-deer used to abound on the Ul, but have now disappeared. They are still met with in great numbers in the ravines and ancient watercourses now filled with lofty grass, which are found in Khairigarh and Kukra Mailani, also in the savannahs and marshes which lie on each side of the Chauka. Gond are found along the Chauka, specially near Kamp in Bhur, and south of the Sukheta in Dhaurahra. Tiger are to be met with everywhere in the Khairigarh pargana, also near Kukra, and in the grassy morasses which lie along the Barnancha before its junction with the Ul. South of the Suheli also tigers are sometimes encountered. They abound at Newalkhar, on the old bank of the Chauka; and in the forests south of Aliganj some are found. Five years ago they were to be met with in pargana Dhaurahra, at Matera, in one of the curves of the ancient channel where the Kauriala ran centuries ago; but either the increase of population or the greater dryness of the neighbourhood has driven them away. In Haidarabad also tigers, up to a recent date, came down the Kathna coppices from the tarai forest, and were killed south of Muhamdi and Mitauli. Their numbers have now been much diminished even in the few strongholds which they yet retain. In 1860 it was not uncommon for a party to kill five tigers in a day; now five in a week is regarded a great success. Leopards are numerous in Atwa Piparia, Kukra Mailani, and Khairigarh. During the rains they are killed in villages, even on the roofs of houses. The Pasis slaughter many annually for the sake of the skins. The following is a fairly complete list of all the animals indigenous to Kheri, but it is doubtful whether the elephant, the wild buffalo, and wild cattle are still found there, although they have been recently:\n\n| Indian elephant | Elephas indicus. |\n|-----------------|------------------|\n| Sambar          | Rusa Aristotelis.|\n| Wild swine      | Sus indicus.     |\n| Spotted deer    | Axis maculatus.  |\n| Swamp deer      | Rucervus Duvaucelli. |\n| Hog deer        | Axis porcinus.   |\nBarking deer ...

In Dhaurahra and Nighasan very large and stately bullocks are reared; but the breed found in Paroh\u00e1r,* the tract between the Gumti and the Kathna, is noted for strength and endurance.\n\nBirds.\u2014The birds of Kheri are those common to North India. Florian were abundant in Bh\u00fbr, but have almost disappeared, owing to their being shot during the breeding season. Black partridge are becoming scarce from the same cause, but are still found in all the forest parganas, also in Dhaurahra and Srinagar. They are found wherever hog-deer are met with, and, like them, disappear when pressed by advancing population. The large bustard and the spotted partridge are found at Matera. Enormous flocks of geese and kulang appear on the Kauri\u00e1la and Chauka; the sportsmen often use a rifle with success upon the dense flocks, and the smaller wild-fowls are numerous on the jhils and marshes.\n\nFor the following account of the birds I am indebted to a well known naturalist, Major Cock.\n\nAs this is not intended to be an ornithological work I shall not do more than catalogue five out of the six great orders of birds. Of the sixth order, that of insessores, I will only give a passing mention to the various families, as it would take up far too much space were I to attempt to mention each genus and species. In the orders grallatores and natatores there are, I trust, only a few omissions, and a glance at the total number of species given in those orders will show how rich the avifauna of this province is. In the order natatores I suppose no single province in India equals this. Well watered, in comparative\n\n* So called from P\u00e1nduh\u00e1r.\nproximity to the great breeding grounds across the Himalayas, a large portion of the migratory army of birds prolong their stay here on their arrival and departure from and to their breeding grounds. I have noticed many of the waders putting on their summer plumage and pairing before leaving the province, showing that they were not far from their homes. The province therefore offers equal attractions both to the ornithologist and the sportsman, and I trust those attractions may never lessen, which in some species they assuredly will, if game laws are not introduced for their protection; quail, partridges, florican, jungle fowl, spotted-bill duck, and others being snared and shot by both natives and Europeans with a total disregard of season. I will exonerate the former on the plea of ignorance, and because the purchase of quail, &c. (which often lay their eggs in the baskets they are brought in), by Europeans, who should know better, is an encouragement to a practice that should be discountenanced. It will go on till no game remains in the province, and then, when too late, the legislature may step in. Any old sportsman will bear me out in this. The partridges, florican, and quail that used to be in certain district ten years ago, where now you won\u2019t find one, where are they? I believe that the great bustard is nearly extinct now, but very few remain. The migratory birds of course are safe, as their breeding grounds are away in places beyond the reach of biped foes, so there is no probability of their number lessening; but I trust for all this that something be done throughout India for the protection of the game birds.\n\nI will now commence with the raptore or birds of prey:\n\n**ORDER RAPTORES.**\n\n| Oologyps calvus | ... | Black vulture. |\n| Gyps bengalensis | ... | White-backed vulture. |\n| Neophron ginginianus | ... | White scavenger vulture. |\n| Falco peregrinus | ... | Peregrine falcon. |\n| \" peregrinator | ... | Shahin falcon. |\n| \" jugger | ... | Laggar falcon. |\n| \" babylonicus | ... | Red-headed lanner. |\n| Hypotriorchis subbuteo | ... | Hobby. |\n| \" chiquera | ... | Turumti. |\n| Tinunculus alaudarius | ... | Kestril. |\n| Erythrcpus vesperinus | ... | Red-legged kestrel. |\n| Micronisus badius | ... | Shikra. |\n| Accipiter nisus | ... | Basha. |\n| \" virgatus | ... | Beera. |\n| Aquila imperialis | ... | Imperial eagle. |\n| \" novia | ... | Spotted eagle. |\n| \" vindhiana | ... | Wokhab or tawny eagle. |\n| \" hastata | ... | Long-legged eagle. |\n| \" pennata | ... | Dwarf eagle. |\n| Niaxactus Bonelli | ... | Crestless hawk eagle. |\n| Circatus gallicus | ... | Serpent eagle. |\n| Spilornis cheela | ... | Crested serpent eagle. |\n| Pandion halictus | ... | Osprey. |\n| Polioctes ichthyatus | ... | White-tailed eagle. |\n| Halictetus leucorrhynhus | ... | Ring-tailed eagle. |\n| Buteo canescens | ... | Long-legged buzzard. |\n| Poliorhyns teesa | ... | White-eyed buzzard or teesa. |\n| Circus Swainsoni | ... | Pale harrier. |\n| \" cineracene | ... | Montague\u2019s harrier. |\n| Circus melanoleucus | ... | Pied-harrier. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| \" aruginosus | ... | Marsh-harrier. |\n| Haliaeetus indus | ... | Brahminy kite. |\n| Milvus govinda | ... | Common kite. |\n| Pernis crista | ... | Honey buzzard. |\n| Elanus melanopterus | ... | Black-winged kite. |\n| Strix javanica | ... | Indian screech-owl. |\n| \" candida | ... | Grass owl. |\n| Otus brachyotus | ... | Short-eared owl. |\n| Ascalaphus bengalensis | ... | Rock-horned owl. |\n| \" coromanda | ... | Dusky-horned owl. |\n| Ketupa ceylonensis | ... | Brown-fish owl. |\n| Ephialtes pennatus | ... | Scops owl. |\n| Athene Brama | ... | Spotted owlet. |\n| \" radiata | ... | Jungle owlet. |\n\nRaptore 44 species.\n\n**ORDER INSESSORES.**\n\n| Hirundininae | ... | True swallow | ... | 4 species. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Cotinginae | ... | Martins | ... | 2 do. |\n| Cypselinae | ... | Swifts | ... | 3 do. |\n| Caprimulginae | ... | Goat-suckers | ... | 2 do. |\n| Meropidae | ... | Bee-eaters | ... | 2 do. |\n| Coraciidae | ... | Rollers | ... | 1 do. |\n| Halcyonidae | ... | Kingfishers | ... | 4 do. |\n| Bucerotidae | ... | Hornbills | ... | 3 do. |\n| Palaeornithidae | ... | Parrakeets | ... | 4 do. |\n| Picinae | ... | Woodpeckers | ... | 6 do. |\n| Megalaenidae | ... | Barbets | ... | 3 do. |\n| Cuculinae | ... | Cuckoos | ... | 7 do. |\n| Centropodinae | ... | Coucals | ... | 2 do. |\n| Nectariniinae | ... | Honey-suckers | ... | 2 do. |\n| Dicruridae | ... | Flower-peckers | ... | 2 do. |\n| Certhiidae | ... | Tree-creepers | ... | 3 do. |\n| Sittinae | ... | Nuthatches | ... | 1 do. |\n| Upupidae | ... | Hoopoes | ... | 1 do. |\n| Laniidae | ... | Shrikes | ... | 5 do. |\n| Malacoptinidae | ... | Wood-shrikes | ... | 1 do. |\n| Campephagidae | ... | Cuckoo-shrikes | ... | 4 do. |\n| Icteridae | ... | Drongo-shrikes | ... | 4 do. |\n| Myiagriinae | ... | Fly-catchers | ... | 3 do. |\n| Muscicapidae | ... | Ditto | ... | 6 do. |\n| Merulinae | ... | Thrushes. | ... | --- |\n| Timaliinae | ... | Tit-thrushes | ... | 7 do. |\n| Pyconotinae | ... | Bulbuls | ... | 6 do. |\n| Oriolidae | ... | Orioles | ... | 2 do. |\n| Saxicolinae | ... | Stonechats | ... | 7 do. |\n| Ruticillidae | ... | Redstarts | ... | 3 do. |\n| Calamonarchinae | ... | Reed-warblers | ... | 3 do. |\n| Drymocinidae | ... | Wren-warblers | ... | 9 do. |\n| Phylloscopinae | ... | Tree-warblers | ... | 8 do. |\n| Sylvinae | ... | Grey warblers | ... | 1 do. |\n| Motacillinae | ... | Wagtails and pipits | ... | 11 do. |\n| Leiothrichinae | ... | Flower-peckers | ... | 4 do. |\n| Parinae | ... | Tits. | ... | --- |\n| Acomotorninae | ... | Accentors. | ... | --- |\n| Corvininae | ... | Crows | ... | 3 do. |\n| Garrulinae | ... | Jays. | ... | --- |\n| Dendrocitinae | ... | Magpies | ... | 1 do. |\n| Fringillinae | ... | Choughs. | ... | --- |\nKHE\n\nSturninae ...

Kheri, although generally so backward, produces more sugarcane than any other district. The cause of this lies principally in its vicinity to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, a great sugar emporium, and the place where Messrs. Powell's factory distils the greater part of the rum used by soldiers and civilians in India. The cane grown about Haidarabad is also of very superior quality and in demand, at the top price, for making candy.\n\nRice is grown in Kheri in a very slovenly way; transplantation is almost entirely unknown, and the crop is consequently more uncertain than in other districts. A species called karmand rice, of the best quality, is grown in small quantities in Oel, Paila, and a few other villages. The soil suits it admirably. In every respect the Kheri rice is unsurpassed.\n\nThe principal kinds of rice are anjana and jarhan, but the latter includes a great many species. The Partabgarh article gives details which are also appropriate for this district. Wild rice (pas\u00e1hi) is common in all the jh\u00edls. No embankments have been made to protect from floods in any part of the district. It is doubtful if they could be made, but in many places channels for carrying off the flood waters might be dug to the great advantage of the rice crop. The latter dies if the tops are submerged more than a few days. Along the banks of the Chauka many thousands of acres of rice are ruined every year. Rice is grown on mat\u00ed\u00e1r or clayey land, which requires to be moistened by a shower before it can be ploughed; if therefore the June rains are late, the area sown is much diminished.\n\nTurmeric is much cultivated in Palia, Bh\u00far, and Khairigarh; the rent is four or five rupees per acre. If turmeric is not sown the rent is only two or three. It is planted in light, almost sandy, soil. The roots are dug up and boiled for two days in earthen pots over fires lighted in the fields. The culture was only introduced about twelve years ago. The price has been gradually falling; it was seventeen rupees per maund for the dry boiled root; it is now about ten. The raw root can be purchased at two maunds for the rupee. A good crop is 2,000 lbs. per acre. The ginger is a coarse stringy variety, and the Oudh druggists import from Jamaica whatever they require for essences, syrups, and aerated waters.\n\nThere are several kinds of ghuiy\u00e1n (arum); one, which was introduced from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and is grown at Muhamdi, is a nourishing root, of which the produce is about forty maunds per acre.\n\nGreat quantities of excellent tobacco are grown in Dhaurahra, Nigh\u00e1san, and Firozabad, particularly near villages, or, better still, on the sites of those which have been abandoned. Rents for tobacco lands reach Rs. 18 per acre. A good crop will be 500 lbs. of dry leaf. The price of the best is about six lbs. for the rupee.\n\nNo remark need be made about barley or wheat, except that the former is not eaten by black buck or nil-g\u00e1e, and is consequently exclusively sown\nnear the jungles where those animals abound. When sown mixed together the joint crop is called \"gujai.\" Linseed is sown in narrow borders round gram and other crops, kusam (safflower) is similarly treated, zira (cummin) saunf (aniseed), and dhania (coriander-seed) are sparingly sown.\n\nRecent decrease of cultivation.\u2014Since the above was written the circumstances of Kheri have materially altered for the worse. The area under crop was reported for 1868 at 1,450,000 acres, and this is confirmed by the 1869 returns. The area of land measured in 1867 by the survey parties as actually under cultivation was only 795,000 acres; but my own inquiries and measurements as settlement officer led me to the conclusion that cultivation had increased 18 per cent. prior to 1870, which would be an augmentation of 143,000 acres, giving a total area under crop of 938,000 acres. In the year in question it is probable enough that 60 per cent. of the land was cropped twice under the impetus of high prices or favourable seasons in Kheri, and the fertility of the virgin soil. If so the tables are probably correct enough.\n\nThe return for 1872 shows a great decrease; the entire area is 695,450, and allowing for an exaggeration in the previous return, the diminution in area under crop will be at least 100 per cent. That does not mean, however, that the land has actually fallen out of cultivation to that extent, although such has been the case in parganas Atwa Piparia, part of Paila, and Kukra Mailoni, but that it has not as formerly been cropped twice. The land has become exhausted, and will no longer bear two crops, the cattle have died, and the fever-stricken population can no longer labour as they were wont.\n\nThe decrease is most marked, however, in sugarcane, which has fallen from 41,000 to 15,000 acres.\n\nSugarcane in Kheri is principally grown in Muhamdi, Haidarabad, the northern part of Paila, and Kheri parganas. In the last three defective drainage and heavy rains often seriously injure the crop. The edible sugarcane is not grown, except in the gardens of the wealthy. Rent of sugarcane land is eight to twelve rupees per acre in the southern, falling to four rupees in the northern parganas. In addition the landlord is entitled to one-twentieth (called biswi) of the green cane for his elephants, also to one earthen jar of the expressed juice from every field; from this vinegar is made. A heavier rent is generally charged for sugarcane land, that is to say, if wheat or other cereal is grown the landlord takes the usual rent, about six rupees for irrigable land, but if the tenant plants sugarcane the rent is raised to twelve. All castes plant sugarcane, turmeric, and opium, although potatoes, tobacco, ginger, ghuiyan (arum), shakarqand (sweet potatoes) are only grown, as a rule, by Kachhis and Muraos. The sugar mills are always of wood. The ordinary succession is sugarcane, then wheat or gram, then barley. The produce is sold in the form of gur, or coarse brown sugar, to merchants from Shahjah\u00e1npur who make advances to the cultivators. An average crop is 1,100 lbs. per acre, and the price is about 30 lbs. for a rupee. The bye products, the crushed stalks, are invaluable as food for cattle.\n### List of cereal food grains and oilseeds.\n\n| Botanical names | Local names | English names |\n|-----------------|-------------|---------------|\n| **Cereal Food Grains** | | |\n| Amaranthus anardhana | An\u00e1rd\u00e1na. | |\n| Avena sativa | Jau Walaiti. | Oats. |\n| Bambusa spicata | Jai. | Bamboo seed. |\n| Chevalier barley | B\u00e1na. | |\n| Cajanus indicus | Jau dasauni | |\n| Cicer arietinum | Arhar. | Gram. |\n| Dolichos sinensis | Chana. | |\n| Eruvum lens | Lobia. | |\n| Eleocharis corocana | Mas\u00far. | |\n| Hordeum hexastichum | Mindwa or makra. | |\n| Hordeum distichum | Gurhi jau. | |\n| Lathyrus sativus | Jau. | Barley. |\n| Pisum sativum | Kesari. | Peas. |\n| Phaseolus acutifolius | Matar. | |\n| Paspalum scrobiculatum | Urd. | |\n| Panicum frumentaceum | Kodo. | |\n| Panicum italicum | S\u00e1nw\u00e1n. | |\n| Pennicillaria spicata | Kakun. | |\n| Sorghum vulgare | B\u00e1jra. | Wheat. |\n| Triticum sativum | Ju\u00e1r (var. red). | Maize. |\n| Zea Mays | Gehun. | |\n| | Makai. | |\n| | Bhawans | |\n\n| Oilseeds | | |\n|----------|-------------|---------------|\n| Argemone mexicana | Kurwa. | |\n| Bassia latifolia | Mahua. | Croton. |\n| Celastrus paniculatus | M\u00e1i Kangul. | |\n| Croton tiglium | Jam\u00e1igota. | Safflower. |\n| Carthamus tinctorius | Barre, Kusum. | Linseed. |\n| Linum usitatissimum | Alsi | Poppy. |\n| Papaya somniferum | Posta. | |\n| Sisamum indicum | Til. | Mustard. |\n| Sinapis nigra | R\u00e1l. | |\n| Sinapis glauca | Sarson. | |\n\n**Harvests\u2014**There are two harvests in Kheri, the khar\u00edf and the r\u00e1b\u00ed. The former consists of various grains, rice, &c., which are sown from the beginning of June, or whenever the rains have set in, to the end of August. The crops ripen in from three to four months. The principal khar\u00edf crops are kodo, kakun, ju\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, m\u00e1sh, m\u00fang, and rice. The first crop, kodo, is cut about the end of September; the last, the jarhan rice, about the beginning of November. The r\u00e1b\u00ed crops are barley, wheat, gram, peas, arhar; they commence cutting peas about the 5th March, and in low-lying backward places the latest (barley) will not be harvested till the 5th May, while the s\u00e1nw\u00e1n is being cut till the middle of June. For the mode of cultivating sugarcane see \u201cSitapur.\u201d In this district account I have given details touching the cultivation of poppy and tobacco, for both of which the soil offers every facility, and whose productions rapidly increase.\n\"From July, or when the rains set in and the ground is moist, the lands should commence to be prepared by being ploughed up, so that by the middle of October, according to their requirements, a liberal supply of manure might be used on them. Ploughing should, however, be suspended when the fields are covered with rain-water, as it impoverishes the soil. As the season for sowing advances, or about the month of November, flocks of goats or sheep, if procurable, might be penned with very great advantage on the fields for one or more nights, as the manure thus obtained operates favourably on, and is peculiarly invigorating for, the soil. The poppy, unlike many other plants, the soil of which requires what is agriculturally termed 'a rotation of crops' may be sown on the same ground year after year with unerring regularity, as the quantity of decayed vegetable and animal manure put into the soil imparts sufficient nourishment to the ground to sustain annual crops of poppy without in the least degree being deteriorated by these yearly sowings.\n\n\"When the lands are ready, or about the middle of November, the early sowings may commence, and the 2nd and 3rd be concluded in all December. The seed should be of the previous year, free from damp; it should be moistened in water the evening previous to sowing, and the next morning, after being removed out of the water, it should be scattered over the fields mixed with fine earth, at the rate of 2 seers per beegah of the large bazar weight: should the ground be dry, it might be irrigated with advantage prior to sowing. Another way is adopted in some districts of throwing broadcast the dry seed. After sowing the land should be irrigated the next day (if not previously done), and then on the succeeding day ploughed and harrowed.\n\n\"After a week the beds should be made from $3\\frac{1}{2}$ to 4 cubits in length by 2 to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ cubits in breadth. All the beds should be placed in consecutive rows according to the level of the ground, so that there may be no difficulty in irrigating the land. A drain or outlet should intervene between every two beds for the passage of water. Lands bordering on rivers and jheels, as they retain their moisture till December, the necessity of forming beds in them does not exist on that account, as they (the beds) are only useful to facilitate the watering of crops. Wells are essentially necessary for poppy fields, and every facility and encouragement should be given to construct them wherever they are wanted. Kucha wells may be dug at a very trifling cost, which would be more than threefold repaid by the productive returns of the crops. Well water is preferred to water obtained from any other sources, such as jheels and rivers; but the cultivators from necessity are frequently obliged from the want of wells, or their great distance from the fields, to avail themselves of jheel irrigation.\n\n\"When the plant attains to the size of two inches in height, the beds after being well irrigated should be carefully weeded and thinned, and the plants to be retained should be kept from 3 to 4 inches apart from each other. Two weeks after the same operations are to be practised, all the sickly and superfluous plants, together with all foreign and noxious herbs, should be removed, leaving the vigorous poppy plants at distances of 7 or 8 inches from each other. Then the process of gently digging up the soil with a hoe or spud should be diligently carried out, and the fields\nmust continue to be dug and irrigated every two weeks; the roots thus imbibe moisture and the plant springs up large and luxuriant.\n\n\"In the process of irrigation care should be taken not to allow the water to exceed one inch in depth, or, in other words, the entire seedling should not be under water. It is very necessary that irrigation should be pursued at stated intervals of time until the collections begin.\n\nWhen the plants have been in bloom for some time the green capsules become lightly coated over with a fine transparent white-coloured surface, and the pods become less yielding to the touch when pressed. When this change presents itself the cultivators at once perceive that the plant has arrived to maturity and is fit for incision. Another means for recognising this is when juice exudes on breaking off the series of stigmata formed at the apex of the pod.\n\n\"When the incisions commence the process should be carried on regularly every third day, and according to the time of collection, whether late or early in season, or the condition of the plant, whether sickly or healthy, from 2 to 7 incisions might be expected. It is to be noted that there is a wide difference between the produce of the earlier compared with the later sowings; the former is of lower spissitude, but more abundant in bulk, whilst the latter is just the reverse, poor in quantity, but of higher and more superior consistence.\n\n\"Gentle westerly winds are most favourable for our opium collections, as also for inspissating the drug when collected. Opium gathered in during the prevalence of easterly winds is scanty, because the juice does not exude freely from the incisions, and the opium collected is somewhat dark in colour from the atmospheric humidity with which it gets impregnated. The incisions should invariably be made in the afternoon, and the operation of collection the next morning.\n\n\"It will be necessary now to enumerate a few of the causes which contribute to the falling off of produce or tend to the entire destruction of the plant. 'Bhur bhar,' a prickly plant, is very destructive to the poppy, absorbing the nutritive qualities of the ground intended for the latter alone: these ought to be steadily rooted up wherever they make their appearance. Insects are apt very often to attack the crops. When this occurs among the early sowings the best plan is to persevere and re-sow; but when they begin their ravages after the plants have germinated and attained to some size, the following bait must be used with very great success, viz., to cut gourds or castor-oil leaves into pieces and strew them over the land. The next morning they will be covered over with the insects, as they readily forsake the poppy for the more palatable food offered to them; thus they can easily be removed and destroyed in a collective mass. The process of irrigation, too, offers a good opportunity for the insects to be destroyed by birds. There is a parasitic shrub called by the natives 'tokra' which is very detrimental to the growth of the poppy; it completely entwines itself round the root of the poppy, and gradually injures and chokes up the absorbing pores of the little poppy spongelets; being a much stronger plant, it easily overpoweres the tender poppy, and so induces premature decay. The poppy plant is subject, in common with other crops, to certain vegetable diseases; the two most common and most fatal are called 'nurka, and khurka' in the...\"\nvillage vernacular; the former shows itself among the early sowings, its ravages are marked by the plant becoming shrunk and stunted in growth, the leaves become sere and yellow, and the plant eventually decays away, affording, if it has lingered a while, very little (if any at all) of produce. The cultivators attribute this disease to a species of infusorial worms which corrode the tender roots, and not to any agency of the soil, for side by side may be commonly observed two beds, one teeming with luxuriant plant full of rich foliage, whilst the other may have only a few lank diminutive plants possessing not the slightest shadow of verdure. The 'khurka' occurs late in season, and attacks the plant in its healthiest state this blight arises from excessive damp produced by a sudden change of atmosphere attended with rain and damp wind, specially affecting fields which have just before been already seasonably irrigated. There is no mistaking the effect of such transition; the bright green colour yields to a dark sombre tint which transfuses itself alike over the leaves, the stalk, and the capsule: a sensible decrease is at once observable in the produce, which before long ceases altogether, for the malady completely saps the vitality of the plant. The other causes which prove injurious to the plant and materially affect its productive powers are either natural visitations, such as a fall of hail, a severe frost, inopportune showers of rain, or excessively strong winds during collection, or the causes may be, as in too many instances they truly are, from a defective system of tillage.\"\u2014Gennoe's \"Notes on the Cultivation of Poppy, pages 4\u20149.\"\n\nTobacco.\u2014In Oudh tobacco is almost always grown on high dry lands; village sites are much liked, and the rough ground amidst ruins, where the soil is much mixed with mortar, lime, and brick rubbish, and saline constituents, is believed to be peculiarly suited to the growth of good tobacco. A piece of land of this description, or approaching to it, being selected, the ground is carefully worked up by repeated ploughing. It is manured with old dung, that of sheep and goats being preferred, and with saliferous earth, where the soil happens to be naturally deficient in salt. The seed is sown broadcast about the middle of August in a nursery, and the seedlings are protected from excessive heat or rain by layers of straw or dry grass. About the end of September or beginning of October the seedlings are planted out in rows, a space of about eighteen inches being left between each plant. Earth rich in salts is sometimes applied to the roots of the plants when they are set out. The plants are irrigated at intervals of a week or fortnight, according to the state of the weather, the water used being preferentially that of brackish wells. Sweet water is supposed by the cultivators to be injurious to the plants. When five or six leaves have formed on the stem the tops are pinched off, and all the shoots are thereafter carefully removed as they appear. In some places the crop is gathered by the removal of the leaves as they ripen, the stems being left to produce a second crop, when they are cut down, and a second crop is taken from the shoots which spring from the stool. This second crop, called dubbe, is of inferior quality and is consumed only by the poorer classes. The first crop is generally gathered about the end of February, the second in April and May.\nThe curing is conducted in the usual rough, imperfect way. The leaves are spread on a plain\u2014grassy if possible\u2014and exposed to the sun and dew for a period varying from four to ten days, being turned at intervals. When they have wilted they are stacked in heaps, roughly thatched, and allowed to ferment, the heaps being occasionally opened out to prevent excessive fermentation. They are thus kept for about a month, when the leaf is expected to acquire the desired colour. If this should still be wanting, it is imparted by the application of water in which the stems and refuse leaves of the plant have been steeped. This completes the curing, and the leaves, on arriving at this stage, are tied in bundles of four or five each.\n\nExperiments have been tried at various places, but not with much success. Some of the American kinds grow very well, but the natives are said to prefer their own coarser and stronger kinds. The subjoined remarks by Dr. E. Bonavia on the hybridization of tobacco are worthy of attention:\n\n\"In endeavouring to introduce any foreign agricultural plant into this country, the main difficulty in keeping it true, i.e., preventing it from what is commonly, though erroneously, called degenerating, is the ignorance of natives in not knowing the power they possess to improve and modify plants by selection, and in their failing to take the precaution not to sow foreign seed, such as tobacco, in the vicinity of country plants. They have no idea that plants of the same species may be hybridized if close to each other during the flowering time, either by the agency of the wind or of insects. There is little doubt that in many parts of this province (Oudh) tobacco of good quality might be grown for exportation if sufficient care were taken, not only in the cultivation, but also in the drying and packing of the plant.\"\n\nAgricultural operations.\u2014The inhabitants of Kheri are employed principally in agricultural operations on their own account, 474,834, or 64 per cent. of the entire population, being engaged in the cultivation of the soil as tenants. They employ in this labour 88,857 ploughs, 251,637 bullocks, and 15,297 buffaloes upon 825,630 acres of land, of which 35,249 acres are covered with mango groves. There are then 1\u00b77 acres for each head of the agricultural population, or, including agricultural labourers, 1\u00b75 acres. Cultivation is, however, very backward. North of the river Ul land is hardly ever manured and never irrigated, except the small gardens in which tobacco and vegetables are grown. South of the Ul a fair amount of labour is bestowed upon the crops, although less than what is usual in the rest of Oudh. Large herds of cattle and sheep are grazed in Srinagar, Kukra, Khairigarh: there are not twenty camels in the district. The agricultural implements are those described in article \"Partabgarh.\"\n\nIrrigation of the crops.\u2014The spring crops are very generally left unweeded, and are rarely watered more than once. This partly arises from the difficulty and expense of getting water, there being not so many jhils as in the rest of Oudh. The soil is so friable that the wells are constantly falling in. Water is met with at from forty feet in Magdapur to ten feet in the river bottoms, the average being about 25 feet. The wicker baskets used at jhils will raise the water sixteen feet in five lifts; from the wells, as a\nrule, only small earthen pots can be used for conveying the water to the surface. In Muhamdi the under-soil is more tenacious, and large leather bags holding from ten to twelve gallons can be applied, but over a large part of the district these small wells are dug at a cost of two rupees each. They will water about two acres in a month, and then fall in. They require one man and a boy at a monthly expense of Rs. 5-10-0 to use them; hence it is apparent that well-irrigation throughout much of the district in Magdapur, Srinagar, Aurangabad, Atwa Piparia, part of Muhamdi, Haidarabad, Kheri, and other places costs Rs. 3-13-0 per acre.* The expense of irrigation from tanks varies from Re. 1-12-0 to Rs. 3-0-0 per acre, according to the distance of the fields and their elevation above the water. If a second watering is required the cost will be doubled; but rain generally falls in January. Very little land is therefore irrigated, only 91,134 acres, or 11 per cent. of the cultivated area, being watered, 55,950 from wells, 25,850 from tanks, and 9,334 from streams. Such are the official returns, but the settlement officer thought that double that area can be, and is, irrigated from existing sources.\n\nThe machinery for raising water.\u2014Irrigation in Kheri is conducted in four different ways. From wells the water is drawn up either by dhenkhlis (earthen pots fastened to the long arm of a lever pivoted on an erect pole) or by gharas\u2014two earthen pots on a rope running in a groove over a wheel which are alternately pulled up, or by purs (leathern bags) holding from ten to twenty gallons pulled up by men or, very rarely, by bullocks. From tanks or rivers the water is obtained by beris (quadrangular plaited straw baskets slung on ropes).\n\nThe cheapest and surest supply of water is from wells which will bear the use of the largest bags. These are called in this district chaujania, because four men pull them up: they are found in parganas Muhamdi, Kasta, Pasgawan, Kheri, and part of Paila. Throughout most of the district water is procured by ghara wells, a tedious and expensive process; for the friable soil in which these wells are sunk is always tumbling in, and has to be scooped out from the bottom several times a day. Perhaps a quarter of the irrigated land is watered at an average cost of Rs. 3 per acre, and the rest at Rs. 5, for two or three waterings such as are generally required for wheat.\n\nSouth of the Ul much of the land is very well manured, particularly by the Kurmis of northern Paila, Haidarabad, and the Mur\u0101s of Kheri and Muhamdi. It is misleading to give any actual weight of manure laid on the field, because the habits of the people largely add to the supply.\n\nRotation of crops.\u2014The usual rotation of crops on loam is sugarcane, wheat, and then gram or mash; on the sandy soils barley succeeds bajra or ju\u00e1r for many years continuously. In the rice lands (mati\u00e1r or clay) there is often no second crop, as the soil is too hard for winter ploughing; rice is grown year after year in the khar\u00edf, and moth or linseed sometimes succeeds it. Manure is only given every third year, and hardly ever to barley\n\n* One rupee cost of well, two rupees thirteen annas of labour.\nor maize. When no manure is applied land is fallowed after every five or seven years generally for three harvests, that is, for a year and a half; then another turn of cultivation commences, but in Khairigarh, possibly owing to the abundance of the cattle, most of the land has been cropped without the artificial application of manure for many years.\n\nProfits of cultivation.\u2014The Kurmis and Kachhis are to a certain extent skilled labourers, and are generally tolerably well off; but the following calculation will show that the mass of the low caste cultivators are constantly living from hand to mouth, and living very badly too.\n\nThere are to each head of the agricultural population 1\u00b75 acres, and this will give different results according to quality of land. In good land, such as will bear wheat, the rent of such a plot will be Rs. 7, in addition to the owner's labour; and at least a quarter of the population are too young or too old for any labour. About three rupees will be required to pay for carts, plough, bullocks, and other material. Rs. 10 then will be the cost of production to the tenant, and he will receive about Rs. 17 per acre* or Rs. 25-8-0 on each area of 1\u00b75 acres, which is the portion of an agricultural inhabitant, leaving a balance of Rs. 15-8-0 for his annual expenses.\n\nIt appears then that the income of each member of an ordinary peasant family will be less than Rs. 16 per annum, from which he or she must defray the whole cost of food, shelter, clothing, and firewood. If the peasant is in debt, as is the case nine times out of ten, he will get between Rs. 12 and 13, or Rs. 62 for a family of five, consisting of a grandfather or grandmother, father, mother, and two children. Such a family will consume five sers per day of coarse grain\u2020 such as is above described; this will be 45 maunds in the year, and its cost at the village price at least Rs. 52. Ten rupees therefore will be left for salt and salt tax, for clothing, house-rent, and the payment of village registrars, watchmen, &c.,\u2014a sum evidently quite insufficient.\n\nProper cost of suitable food.\u2014If, however, we enquire, not what the Kheri peasant does eat, but what he should eat, then another calculation may be used. The actual cost of prisoners' food in all the Oudh jails was Rs. 17-13-7 on a four years' average, and their clothing came to Re. 1-9-0, or Rs. 19-6-7 in all. On this scale, therefore, the family of five would cost Rs. 97 per annum for food and clothing; but they only possess Rs. 62. Calculating that each child requires only half the sustenance of an able-bodied man, each adult will cost Rs. 18-8-0, and each minor Rs. 9-4-0; thus the aggregate expenses of the family of five will be Rs. 74 for food and Rs. 7-13-0 for clothing\u2014Rs. 81-13-0 in all. In other words, to defray the cost of good food and clothing, the peasant farmer of Kheri must exhaust all his means and incur a debt of twenty rupees each year.\n\n* 800 lbs. of wheat at 50 lbs. per rupee; this will amount to Rs. 16 per acre, and he may be able sell Re. 1 worth of chopped straw.\n\u2020 Such a family would require three and a half sers of wheat according to jail allowances; this would equal probably six sers of kodo, certainly four, in food value.\nIf the tenant occupies second class land such as will only produce the inferior grains, kodo, millet, &c., his position is still worse, unless, as is usually the case, he has a much larger area of land under cultivation. True, the tenant will only pay about Rs. 2-8-0 per acre, or Rs. 3-12-0 for a tenure of average size; but it will only produce about 500 lbs. per acre, or 750 lbs. in all, and this will not be worth more than Rs. 10-10-0 at 70 lbs. per rupee. However, when the crop is not wheat, two crops are generally sown, and two harvests reaped in the year, the second being always of smaller produce and worth about half the first, or Rs. 16-0-0 in all. From this sum must be deducted rent Rs. 3-12-0, and cost of bullocks, &c., Rs. 2-0-0, in all Rs. 5-12-0; and the value of the crop remaining to the cultivator will be Rs. 10-4-1, little more than half the sum required to provide him with food and clothing.\n\nIn the above calculation care has been taken not to exaggerate; no second crop was allowed for in the wheat lands because in this district wheat is generally sown in fallow lands, and when a first or autumn crop has been taken, the wheat produce will be so much less than what is assumed, that the whole value of both crops will hardly exceed that of wheat alone. If the tenant gives a proportion of the crop to his landlord, it will be at least three-sevenths of the whole in good land. Now the crop will be 1,200 lbs. in the average holding of one and a half acre and the tenant will only keep four-sevenths of this, or 685 lbs., value Rs. 14. From this must be deducted Rs. 3, cost of bullocks, agricultural implements, &c.; and Rs. 11 will be the balance left for a year's maintenance.\n\nThe above remarks refer generally to the district of Kheri which is one as a whole of backward cultivation and inferior crops; but in the parganas of Haidarabad, Muhamdi, Pasgawan, Kasta, Kheri and others there are large communities of peasants who by high cultivation have so improved the capacities of the soil that it is now equal to any in Oudh. The following remarks and quotations refer to similar superior farming and heavier crops. The subject is of such importance that it is desirable to present it in different aspects and with all natural varieties of circumstance.\n\nThe expenses of cultivation have been estimated very differently indeed by various officers. Two of the very best authorities in India, Mr. Hume and Mr. Halsey, in a series of elaborate calculations have proved that cultivation is carried on at a loss. \"The fact remains,\" says Mr. Halsey,* \"that after payment of the rent the margin left for the cultivator's subsistence is less than the value of the labour he has expended on his land.\" This fact is perhaps true, but not to the same degree and for the exact reasons which Mr. Halsey assigns. I will take his estimate of the amount of bullock and human labour necessary for the various operations, but place my own valuation on its cost. On this the whole question turns; for the price of seed is a minor item which can be exactly determined, and rent is tolerably well known. Mr. Halsey assumes that a bullock costs three annas per day and human labour one anna and a half.\n\n* Magistrate of Cawnpore, a district adjoining Oudh.\nNow the ordinary rate of bullock hire for a pair with a cart and driver is eight annas, and no doubt deducting two annas for the driver this leaves three annas for each bullock; but this is the Government rate of hire for officers who take bullocks with gentle violence from their ploughs, and it is straining the argument to say that because Government officers pay for one day at that rate, therefore the annual cost to a tenant is to be so estimated. In point of fact, if bullocks are hired by the month or year, they can be had for two-thirds of that sum. But in truth the cost of bullocks, or anything else, cannot be determined by the price till there is an open market and a sufficient number of both buyers and sellers to cause competition.\n\nI will therefore work out the calculation previously given in combination with Mr. Halsey's facts. The ordinary country bullock is very seldom indeed offered for hire; he can drag a plough, but it would not pay to use him in a cart. The only way to determine the value of bullock hire is to count what a yoke costs to buy and keep.\n\nNow average bullocks sufficient for ploughing purposes cost Rs. 30 a pair; they feed simply on straw and chaff enriched with the grain left behind by the wasteful country process of threshing and winnowing; they sometimes get oil-cake when they have been working hard. It is impossible to say what the cost of this bhusa, as it is called, is, because there is no open market for it throughout the rural district, nearly everyone producing as much as he wants; and what is sold in the large towns is no criterion, carriage being such an important item of the cost. It is easy simply to omit the value of straw from the land products and to disregard bullocks' food as an item in the cost of cultivation. Therefore the tenant will only have to pay interest on Rs. 30 at 12 per cent. per annum Rs. 3-8, and will have to keep up a sinking fund of about the same sum to replace the bullocks when their usual eight years of service terminate by death or decrepitude; and allowing five rupees for cordials and extra feeding after hard work, repair of plough, spade, &c., the annual cost of the pair of bullocks will be Rs. 12. Now a pair of bullocks will work five acres, so the cost of their labour per acre will be two rupees eight annas per acre, or including the value of straw, * under eight rupees per acre, instead of above thirteen as estimated by Mr. Halsey for wheat.\n\nSimilarly Mr. Halsey allows 92 days' human labour for an acre of wheat at Rs. 0-1-6, or 2\u00bd per day, and Rs. 0-3-0 for reapers. This is too high an estimate, for very much of the work can be done, and generally is done, by women and boys, and he has no right to allow double wages at harvest time to peasants labouring in their own fields, because such men would demand that if reaping other men's crops. Reaping is not harder work than irrigating, and a fancy price exacted at a time of pressure for ordinary labour is no measure of its value as a whole. Following for a moment Mr. Halsey's mode of calculation, and allowing eighty-days of adult male labour at Rs. 0-1-6, the cost will be Rs. 7-8-0, and the\n\n* Fodder valued at five rupees per acre on rough analogy from English valuation\u2014McCullogh's Commercial Dictionary.\nentire cost of labour of cattle and men will be Rs. 10 per acre, not including that of the fodder consumed by the cattle, which is worth from four to five rupees per acre, and the seed which cost Rs. 2,\u2014total Rs. 17 per acre.\n\nBut another mode of calculation may be adopted. Supposing 92 days' adult male labour to be required for an acre, five acres will require 460 days, and allowing three hundred working days per annum, this will be just the labour of a man and a boy, exactly what an ordinary Hindu peasant family will be able to supply. Therefore five acres of wheat will cost the ordinary expenses of a Hindu family and a pair of bullocks.\n\nI have estimated the proper expenses of an average family of four persons at Rs. 55 per annum, and those of a pair of bullocks at Rs. 12, therefore the whole labour cost of five acres of wheat will be Rs. 67, seed will be Rs. 10, and rent Rs. 30, total Rs. 107, or including price of fodder Rs. 132; and if Mr. Halsey's estimate of the crop is correct, the tenant will get Rs. 160 worth of wheat, leaving him a handsome profit. But 16 maunds of wheat is, as admitted by Mr. Halsey, much above the average crop, and 20 sers far above the average price paid to the tenant who must sell at harvest time to pay his rent. Taking the crop at 14 maunds and the price at 26 sers, the value of the five acres, excluding straw, will be Rs. 109, leaving the tenant a balance of Rs. 2, or 6 annas per acre, to cover the risk of bad seasons, sickness, murrain, and the other casualties to which Indian farming is exposed. This is evidently not enough, and the balance must be made up by diminished expenditure on the part of the family: the only margin they can draw on is their food, so they eat less grain and more wild roots and fruits. It is evident that Mr. Halsey's calculations, which assume a considerable profit on gram, and a considerable loss on wheat, must be erroneous. If this were the case gram would be sown exclusively and wheat abandoned. If average prices, crops, and labour are given, as ought to be the case, there must be a fault somewhere. Mr. Hume and Mr. Halsey are right in showing that small farming in India does not pay as well as working on the public roads, but they have both, in my opinion, over-estimated alike the cost of production and the value of the produce.\n\nHaving made these remarks, I now give Mr. Halsey's valuable table and remarks in full. It appears that every crop, according to him, brings a certain loss to the cultivator except gram, and certain cereals when irrigated from canals. Mr. Hume's estimate is still more remarkable; he assumes a loss on every crop except bajra, which is almost unknown in parts of Oudh, and canal-irrigated wheat, which is entirely unknown.\n### Appendix A.\u2014Cost of cultivating the staples of the Cawnpore district.\n\nAccording to Mr. HALLAY.\n\n| Name of crops | Area | Seed | Prolonging, sow- ing, and man- uvre. | Watering. | Weeding. | Bird-scaring. | Beating. | Thrashing and cleaning. | Rent. | Total expenses. | Produce. | Value of produce. | Profit. | Loss. | Mr. Hume's esti- mate of profits or losses |\n|---------------|------|------|-------------------------------------|-----------|----------|--------------|---------|------------------------|-------|------------------|---------|-------------------|---------|-------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Bajra         | 1    | 0203 | 9001830                           |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n| Jute          | 1    | 0203 | 9001830                           |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n| Barley        | 1    | 2007 | 600152030                         |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n| Sugarcane     |      | 1    | 600152030                         |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n| Wheat         |      | 1    | 300106011401810                   |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n| Gram          |      | 1    | 300106011401810                   |           |          |              |         |                        |       |                  |         |                   |         |       |                                             |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The table provides detailed costs associated with cultivating various crops in the Cawnpore district, including areas planted, seed used, prolonged sowing and manuring, watering, weeding, bird-scaring, beating, thrashing and cleaning, rent, total expenses, produce value, and profit/loss estimates by Mr. Hume.\n\"To enable those who are interested in the subject to understand my share in these figures, I add the following details:\n\n\"Bajra seed, two seers.\u2014Ploughing once a day for four days, including sowing, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas; weeding once, four men at 1 anna 6 pie; bird-scaring, one man to three acres, for two months, at Rs. 2 per mensem (contract rate); cutting, four men at 1 anna 6 pie; threshing, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas, and two men at 1 anna 6 pie; winnowing at 1 anna 6 pie.\n\n\"Jowar seed, two seers.\u2014Ploughing three times, including sowing, six pairs of bullocks for one day at 6 six annas; manure, two carts at 8 annas, and four men at 2 annas for one day; weeding, twice, sixteen men at 1 anna 6 pie each time; bird-scaring, one man to two acres, at Rs. 2 per mensem for two months; reaping, four men for one day at 2 annas, ordinarily paid for by one share in seventeen; cleaning, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas, and two men at 2 annas; winnowing, two men for one day at 1 anna 6 pie.\n\n\"Barley seed, sixty seers.\u2014Ploughing six times, two pairs of bullocks each day at 6 annas; manure, 4 carts at 8 annas, and twelve men at 1 anna 6 pie; weeding once, twenty men at 1 anna 6 pie; watering by well, one pair of bullocks will irrigate one acre in eight days at 6 annas',\u2014requires two waterings; two men at 1 anna 6 pie, equal to sixteen (16) days work; by canal, two lifts, eight men will irrigate an acre in two days at 2 annas each, and one man to guide the water at 1 anna 6 pie, water-rate 1 rupee 8 annas; by canal flow, one man to guide water at 1 anna six pie, water-rate 2 rupees 4 annas; cutting, eight men at 3 annas, but the custom is one share in twenty-one shares; threshing, six pairs of bullocks at 4 annas for two days, and six men at 1 anna 6 pie for two days; winnowing, eight men at 1 anna 6 pie.\n\n\"Sugarcane seed, 400 pieces.\u2014Ploughing eight days, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas; manure, one cart of four bullocks for 4 days at 12 annas, and three men for four days at 1 anna 6 pie; sowing, eight men for two days at 2 annas; weeding, four men, eight times at 1 anna 6 pie; watering by well, eleven times; one pair of bullocks will water an acre in eight days at 6 annas per diem, and two men at 1 anna 6 pie; by canal, double lifts, eight men will irrigate an acre in two days at 2 annas each, one man to guide water at 1 anna 6 pie; water-rate 3 rupees 5 annas 4 pie; by canal flow, water rate 5 rupees, one man for eleven days at 1 anna 6 pie.\"\n\nI have accepted Mr. Hume's estimate of the cost of cultivating the cane and manufacturing the sugarcane, as I can get no accurate information as to the exact detailed cost. The leaves of the cane are never sold. I have given the cost of the most expensive cultivation of sugarcane, which necessitates the land being fallowed for a year previous to sowing; hence I have charged two years' rent.\n\n\"Wheat seed, forty seers.\u2014Ploughing eight times, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas; manure, two carts of four bullocks for two days at 12 annas a\ncart, and six men for two days at 1 anna 6 pie; weeding once, twenty men; watering three times by well; one pair of bullocks irrigates an acre in eight days at 6 annas, two men at 1 anna 6 pie; by canal, double lifts, eight men will irrigate one acre in two days at 2 annas each, one man to guide the water at 1 anna 6 pie, water-rate 1 rupee 8 annas; by canal flow, water-rate 2 rupees 4 annas, one man to guide the water at 1 anna 6 pie; reaping, two men at 3 annas, usually paid for by one share in twenty-one; threshing, six bullocks for six days at 4 annas per pair, and three men ditto at 1 anna 6 pie; winnowing, eight men at 1 anna 6 pie.\n\n\"Gram seed, one maund.\u2014Ploughing eight times, including sowing, two pairs of bullocks at 6 annas; manure, one cart of four bullocks for two days at 1 rupee, and four men for two days at 1 anna 6 pie; reaping, one share in twenty, equal on an average to 1 rupee; threshing and cleaning two days, one pair of bullocks at 6 annas, and two men at 1 anna 6 pie.\"\n\nIt will be objected to the preceding calculations that the cost of production is so variously stated as to rob the figures of all confidence; one makes the cost of wheat cultivation to be Rs. 17 for labour of men and bullocks with seed, in addition to Rs. 5 for rent, total Rs. 22; and the average value of the produce is calculated at Rs. 18 for grain and Rs. 4 for chaff in Kheri, total Rs. 22. In this case cost and value of produce exactly balance each other, leaving no margin for drought, murrain, or for the fact that if the tenant has borrowed money to buy his cattle he will have to pay interest at 24 or 30 per cent., and if he has borrowed money to pay for seed he will have to pay 50 to 60 per cent. The result is that the mass of the tenants are in debt, and only able to avoid sinking deeper and deeper in debt by diminishing needful expenditure, by curtailing food and clothing.\n\nMr. Halsey calculates the cost of the wheat crop where, as in Oudh, it is irrigated from wells at Rs. 44-11, and the value of the produce at Rs. 37. The difference between the two calculations is not so great as would appear. I consider that there are undoubtedly in Kheri and every other Oudh district many farms in which, after correcting the one absolute error, the valuation of rural plough-bullock labour at the rate which Government allows for cart cattle and the cart, the figures in this table do represent real facts or approximate to them. Irrigation three times will cost very nearly Rs. 13-8 in Oudh (vide remarks on irrigation in Sitapur, Bara Banki); the rent of such land as will produce sixteen or even fourteen maunds will be Rs. 8, for the crop is an exceptionally large one, and the rent therefore exceptionally high. Again, the crop here calculated, 900lbs., is probably a little under-estimated; but then it is assumed that the tenant will plant all his five acres with wheat, and if he does so his culture with one pair of bullocks will be rather superficial. To work five acres properly will require additional labour especially at irrigation time if the crop be wheat.\n\nThe broad fact is that with ordinary exertion a pair of bullocks and a Hindu family of good cultivating caste can, and do, generally produce from\nfive acres of good land a crop equivalent to 900lbs. of wheat per acre, that is, in food value and money value. Perhaps one-quarter of the cultivating household will produce more, and one quarter will produce less, but 900lbs. per acre will be the average in soil suitable for wheat. The economical result is that the small farmer, who has no casualties in average years, gets just the price of his daily labour as an unskilled workman on the roads, and interest on his capital at the very lowest rate. It is also probable that if the tenant has to water his wheat three times, as happens in years when the winter rains are deficient, he will cultivate at an actual loss\u2014a loss which of course he cannot foresee. In most years two waterings are sufficient; but if he has to pay current interest, or if there is any drought, or murrain, or sickness in his own family during harvest or irrigation seasons, his farm will entail a loss.\n\nRents, present and former.\u2014Rents in Kheri are not as yet by any means high as a rule, but they are very uneven. The highest rents I have met with were Rs. 2-12-0 the kachcha bigha, or Rs. 16-8-0 per acre for tobacco land, Rs. 2-4-0 or Rs. 13-8-0 per acre for sugarcane in Haidarabad. Common rates for average land are six to eight rupees per acre for land near the village suitable for wheat. Sugarcane is generally charged a differential rate (nine rupees per acre is about the present average), but a pot of molasses and a lot of cane are also taken from every field; this last should be limited to one biswa in every bigha. The lowest rented lands are the outlying patches far from the sites of the villages in Pahia, Kukra, and Bh\u00fbr; two annas a pakka bigha, or eight annas per acre, is met with, but one rupee an acre is quite common for such lands. Tenantry are allowed to settle at these rates, and when they have built houses and dug wells rents are raised as population increases. The nominal rents under the native rulers were much the same as they are now; sugarcane was even higher. Pargana rates are not known.\n\nA number of curious customs touching grain rents and other payments are given in the following extract from Mr. Williams' report on Bh\u00fbr and Srinagar:\n\n\"Method of weighment of crop.\u2014But even if error and fraud be not intended, and the jam\u00e2bandi entries represent correctly the landlord's share as ascertained at the time of division of the crop, the extraordinary method of weighment pursued is sufficient to ensure the uselessness of any statement professing to record the produce. Regular standard weights are never employed in the khal\u00eey\u00e2n.* A large smooth stone of convenient shape, and of every weight from two to four panseris, is thrown into one scale of the balance. A quantity of grain of equal weight is put in the other. This the landlord takes. The process is repeated again and again, landlord and tenant taking each in turn. If the tenant is holding at a one-third rent, he has two turns to the landlord's one. If he is holding at one-fourth, he has three turns to the landlord's one. Very frequently to save time a large quantity of grain is thrown into the scale containing the stone.\n\n* The threshing-floor\n\"The khaliy\u00e1n and dulukh weighments.\u2014The people are not particular about the weight of the stone, and stones are used of different weights in different khaliy\u00e1ns in the same village. If there happens not to be a sufficient number of these weighing stones ready when needed, no difficulty is allowed to arise. A quantity of grain roughly estimated at so many panseris is used instead, and the weighment and division goes on as before; when the landlord has gathered together all his grain into his house he weighs it all over again for his own satisfaction. This process is called the \"dulukh\" or testing, and generally prevails all over this pargana in bat\u00e1i villages; there is always a considerable difference between the khaliy\u00e1n weighment and the dulukh; on an average the latter is to the former in the proportion of three to two (one and a half to one)\u2014deor-ha his\u00e1b, or more rarely of five to four (one and one-fourth to one)\u2014saw\u00e1i his\u00e1b. In kank\u00fat villages the difference is much less, down to only four sers per maund.\n\n\"Khaliy\u00e1n weighments entered in jam\u00e1bandis.\u2014Of course the dulukh weighments only show the total amount of produce got by the landlord, and not the rents of particular fields. It is the khaliy\u00e1n weighments that are entered in the jam\u00e1bandis; therefore, even if they are correctly entered, such entries only approximately show the real amounts of grain received. I am told patw\u00e1ris were instructed to enter the dulukh weighment for each field: this would be a most troublesome process, necessitating the working out a rule of three sum if several crops grew in one field, and even then, if the patw\u00e1ri was not absolutely certain of the particular ratio existing in any village between the two totals of the khaliy\u00e1n and dulukh weighments, all his sums would be wrong; and in this matter he is entirely in the landlord's hands, for the dulukh weighments may be, and sometimes are, managed without the intervention of the patw\u00e1ri at all. This is specially the case where villages have been given in leases, thekadars being anxious to conceal their profits from both patw\u00e1ri and landlord in order to get a renewal of the lease on easy terms.\n\n\"But this testing process, called the dulukh, is by no means universal. Many landlords or thekadars are too apathetic to care to know the exact quantity of grain that they have realized in any harvest, and store their grain immediately it comes from the khaliy\u00e1n without weighing it a second time.\n\n\"Mixed kank\u00fat and cash rents.\u2014There is a tenure found in this pargana (as well as in Srinagar and in Nigh\u00e1san) which is midway between cash payments and appraisements of crops. The crops are appraised as they stand, but the tenant is allowed to pay the landlord the price in cash of the landlord's share and to remove the crop from the field himself. In such a case the patw\u00e1ri enters the amount of grain appraised, and not the cash paid as the rent of the field. In reckoning the price to be paid for the grain the landlord does not take the ordinary rate current in the village baz\u00e1r at the time of harvest. There are two nirkhs formed for the\n\n*Rent-rolls.\ntransaction. One is the *baz\u0101r nirkh* at time of harvest, the second is taken to be one panseri or two panseris dearer, and may be called the zamindar's *nirkh*, and this regulates the price the tenants must pay.\n\n\"How appraisements are converted into cash.\u2014There is nothing harsh or unfair in the transaction, except that it has the rigidity that belongs to an old custom. If it was more elastic, and if the variation between the two rates was not arbitrarily restricted to one or two panteris, there should be no fairer way of fixing rent, and I have never heard it complained of. An example will illustrate the method. A barley crop is appraised at two maunds for the landlord's share, including village expenses. Barley is selling in the bazar at Re. 1 per maund. The landlord is entitled to Rs. 2, but he assumes the rate to be one panseri less, or 35 sers; and therefore receives Rs. 2-4-6 for his two maunds instead of Rs. 2. If the bazar rate is considered very low he deducts two panteris instead of one, and in this case would get Rs. 2-10-8 instead of Rs. 2, for his share. There are two slight variations from this custom. In Hardeo Bakhsh's taluqa only the landlord's share of the crop is appraised, and he takes a lump sum of 3 annas per rupee additional for expenses. In Anrudh Singh's taluqa the grain is converted into cash at the rates prevailing when money rents are collected, and not at one panseri below the market price at time of harvesting the crop. An additional sum of 1 or 2 annas per rupee is taken for expenses.\n\n\"The tenure called thahrdi.\u2014The tenure called thahr\u0101i is another form of mixed tenure, half cash and half grain payments. No cash rent-rate is fixed, but when the crop is ready for cutting the landlord and tenant inspect it together; the landlord's share of the crop is valued on the spot at a lump sum, and the tenant on payment of this sum is allowed to remove all the crop himself. When the landlord is represented by a the-kadar, who is perhaps the muqaddam of the village, or for some other reason on friendly terms with the tenants, this equitable and sensible method of adjusting the demands of the two parties is frequently resorted to.\"\n\nAnother tenure of land in Kheri prevailing very extensively across the Chauka is nakshi:\n\n\"Peculiar feature of nakshi.\u2014The following are the five distinguishing features of nakshi\u2014(1) rent is always paid in cash; (2) rents are paid not, for the whole year, but for each harvest; (3) the landlord can claim no rent if the crop has been swept away by floods or otherwise destroyed; (4) the tenant, if he choose, can leave the land fallow and pay no rent; (5) a certain proportion of the cultivator's land is left absolutely free of rent. This is called \"chh\u016bt,\" and varies from one-sixth to one-tenth of the whole land in his possession. The usual proportion is one-tenth, which is called dobiswi, being 2 biswas to the bigha, but I have found mahtias, very old cultivators, holding as much as one-sixth chh\u016bt.\n\n\"Its suitability to the g\u00e1njar country.\u2014The extreme suitability of nakshi to the g\u00e1njar country, with its large areas of dofasli lands, its liability to\nfloods, and the necessity for leaving lands fallow to recover their strength, is at once apparent. It is extremely favourable to the tenant. He leaves a field fallow for a year or two, paying no rent, and when in the first year in which it is again cultivated he gets a magnificent crop, he pays no more than for a poor one.\n\n\"Want of elasticity in the custom.\u2014But there is some want of elasticity in the custom: the total destruction of the crop always everywhere exempts the tenants from liability for rents, but a difficulty often arises about the proportional deduction to be allowed for partial damage; when the tenant claims a proportional deduction he must have the lands, the crops of which have been injured, measured by the taluqdar's agent on the spot, and this the agent frequently refuses to do, alleging that the crops are really not damaged. I found several villages in which proportional deductions from rents for partial damage to the kharif crops of last year had been allowed, and several others in which tenants complained of the hardship of deductions not being allowed, the thekadar having refused to measure the extent of the land for which deduction from rent was claimed. The patw\u00e1ris call land of which rent is thus remitted bil\u00e1 lag\u00e1ni or n\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n\"Omission of entry of the second crop.\u2014Where the nakshi tenure prevails the landlord gets exactly double the rent from dafasli that he does from other lands. This shows the extreme necessity and importance of the correct ascertainment of the dafasli area. The most easy and obvious fraud found in a rent-roll is the mere omission from it of the entries for the second crop for a large portion of the dafasli area; and this fraud is very difficult of detection, because the form of jam\u00e1bandi in ordinary use is not adapted for those villages in which this peculiar tenure prevails.*\n\n\"Great difficulty in assessment.\u2014Under the head of village expenses a number of petty and vexatious demands are made upon the cultivators. The total amount of these demands is frequently so great as to amount to more than the difference between one-fourth and one-third, or between one-third and one-half of the whole crop.\n\n\"Variety of customs as to village expenses.\u2014A tenant will frequently consent to pay half instead of one-third or one-fourth, on condition of paying no expenses; and the compromise thus effected is generally in favour of the tenant at first, but eventually disadvantageous to him, as in process of time the reason why he is not paying his share of village expenses comes to be forgotten, and they are again demanded from him.\n\n\"Mazd\u00fari.\u2014Of these items I will mention the principal. It is perhaps hardly fair to enumerate the item called mazd\u00fari, as the landlord gives an equivalent for it. It is the landlord's charge for the wages of ploughmen and labourers whose services he lends to the cultivator to enable him to cut his crop and get it to the khaliy\u00e1n. It varies according to the taluqa, and is demanded in one of the four following ways\u2014(1) 30 sers\n\n*In most parts of the country the spring or rabi crop pays lower rates than the rain or summer crop.\nper plough; (2) 15 sers per each heap of grain; (3) $3\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per maund; (4) or $2\\frac{1}{2}$ sers per kachha bigha.\n\n\"Various items added to rent.\"\u2014But all the other charges are so many additions to the rent. The patwari's fee or ser is from 1 ser to 2 sers per maund; (2) the fees for weighing the grain, taulai, is a half ser per maund; (3) the zamindar's dhora is a half ser per maund. Dhora is a fee paid in acknowledgment of zamindari right, somewhat resembling nankar; (4) pai or paipuja is an allowance to any religious persons, such as Goshains or Pandits, payable from each asami under the landlord's orders. He considers the gift charity, and no doubt the recipient also gives gratitude and thanks to him, but the gift is virtually made by the asamis. This fee is often given to a Kahar or two employed in the heat of the day to supply water to the cultivators and labourers at the khaliyan, and may be from one to four chitaks for each maund, or a ser from each field; (5) pitya or shahnagi for the sepoys employed by the landlord to watch the crops in the threshing-floor; (6) khaliyani or the unclaimed grain and straw left in the threshing-floors after the operations of threshing or treading out and winnowing the corn are completed also belongs to the landlord. Sometimes khaliyani is given up to the tenants; sometimes it is divided between both parties. Out of the ser, taulai and pitya, the landlord has to pay wages to the patwari, weighman, and watchman; but the payments on these accounts are far below the receipts. Out of the dhora the landlord has to supply the scales to weights; but the original reason why the fee is demanded has now almost ceased to be remembered. Paipuja is sometimes taken direct by a zamindar, who then sends a private servant, Brahman or Kahar, to supply water at the khaliyan; (7) lastly, khalu, the corn left in the ears after threshing, which at time of winnowing gets separated both from the grain and from the straw, generally falling between them, is sometimes all taken by the zamindar, sometimes divided between him and the tenant, and sometimes all made over to the tenants.\n\n\"In the taluqas of Niamat-ulla Khan's widow and of Hardeo Bakhsh the landlord takes the produce in rab of one biswa of every field of sugarcane, or else he takes the price of the rab at the market rates. In these two taluqas also, as well as in Narain Singh's villages, all tenants whatever who hold at one-third batai give also one rupee per annum as bhent. In other taluqas bhent is only paid by Amnaiks and other favoured cultivators.\n\n\"Various deductions from rent.\"\u2014On the other hand there are various deductions made from the cultivator's rent for various reasons.\n\n\"The remission of the two well known items called kur and charwa is universal among high caste cultivators, and very common, but not universal, in the case of low castes. Kur is $1\\frac{1}{2}$ panseri per maund in kankut villages and $1\\frac{1}{2}$ panseri in batai villages. Charwa varies from 2 to 5 sers per maund, but is generally 4, and kur and charwa are allowed whether the tenure be by kut or batai, and whether the cultivator ploughs with his own...\"\nhands or not. Properly they are the allowances to a high caste cultivator who is not allowed by his caste to plough with his own hands, and must therefore keep a ploughman.\n\n\"Other similar deductions.\u2014There are five other deductions from rent which are sometimes and to some cultivators allowed in batai villages, but where kank\u00fat prevails the landlord generally makes a deduction of one anna per rupee in lieu of the whole five. They are\u2014(1) Ag\u00e1war, 1\u00bd ser per maund. Agawar (from age before) is so called from its being taken out of the heap of corn before division. It is sometimes given to the landlord and sometimes to the cultivator in the same way as khaliy\u00e1ni and khalu. It is not allowed in lieu of any particular service. (2) Biswi. Sometimes the cultivator is allowed to take off the whole crop of one biswa of his entire holding without dividing it. There seems to be no particular reason for this custom, but where it exists the patw\u00e1ri and the shahra get a small present from the cultivators, one maund per plough. (3) Lahna (lahan) is the wages allowed to the labourers who bring the corn to the threshing-floor. If they are employed by the cultivator this item is always allowed to him as a remission from rent. (4) Anjuri, 2 to 10 sers per plough. Anjuri literally means two handfuls, and is generally given only to the dihw\u00e1l, a Brahman who predicts favourable times for sowing and ploughing, or to the \"hom,\" the man, generally an Ah\u00edr, who performs the \"bhumy\u00e1ra puja or worship to the tutelary village deity, which worship is universally practised all over Bh\u00far, Nigh\u00e1san, and Srinagar. (5) Khaliy\u00e1ni and khatri are the same as the landlord's \"haqs,\" of the same name already mentioned, and are occasionally taken by the tenant.\n\n* * *\n\n\"How rent is paid in Aliganj.\u2014One naturally passes from this question to that of the stages through which rent passes. They are not here three, as in Srinagar, viz., a low cash rent, a grain rent, and a high cash rent. All over Aliganj pargana rent hardly ever changes from grain to cash or cash to grain. Waste is broken up by the cultivators at a grain rent of one-sixth and one-eighth of the crop, or sometimes one-twelfth, while in forest villages the landlord only gets one-sixteenth in the first year. In the second year the landlord's share passes from one-sixth to one-fourth, from one-eighth to two-eighths, and from one-twelfth to one-sixth, and from one-sixteenth to one-eighth. In the third year the land begins to pay the full grain-rent of one-half or one-third, or sometimes only one-fourth.\n\n\"And how in Bh\u00far proper.\u2014But in the thirty villages in the southern parts of Bh\u00far proper land is generally held for the first two years after being broken up at a low cash rent, just as in Srinagar. This rent doubles itself in the second year, and in the third year is changed into the full grain rent, one-third or one-half; but there is no village in the whole pargana of Bh\u00far where rents have yet passed from this second stage of grain-rents into the third stage, in which cash rents are taken over the whole lands of the village, as has already happened in many of the best villages of the Ul chak in pargana Srinagar.\"\n\"Cash rents in nakshi villages.\u2014As has already been mentioned in the other 41 villages of Bh\u00far proper where the nakshi tenure prevails, grain rents are at present entirely unknown. It is here that the greatest spread of cultivation has taken place. The cultivators have hardly yet been able to find out much about the soil, and the consequence is that we find that differences of soil have hardly begun yet to be recognized by them as circumstances affecting the rent they are to pay. Throughout these villages it is not the quality of the soil that determined the rent of the field, but the time that has elapsed since the land was broken up. In the first year land is called banjar, in the second chanchar, in the third polich; and there are different rates for banjar, chanchar, and polich; these variations are well known to the cultivators and universally recognized, and no other standard of rent is now known or remembered. Even facilities of irrigation are not recognized at present as justifying a higher rent in those villages; out of these 41 where irrigation is practised, viz., the 15 villages of the Kundwa Paraunchar chak, no cultivator is allowed to have all his fields in one h\u00e1r. Every one, high caste or low, takes a share both of the good and the bad land and pays the same rent, whether the land is irrigated or not. Mr. Bradley of Aliganj told me he could not get his as\u00e1mis to consent to pay rent at different rates proportioned to quality of soil. They consented rather to pay a somewhat high rent, provided it was equally applied to all fields. The cultivator's idea is that a uniform rate makes future enhancement more difficult to the landlord.\n\n\"What these rent-rates are.\u2014The rate on banjar is usually two annas per kachcha bigha, chanchar three annas, polich four annas, rapidly rising everywhere to five annas; expenses are two annas and two and a half annas per rupee. In some of the grants tenants have even been allowed to hold rent-free for the first year; and in villages near these grants one and a half anna per kachcha bigha is the rent paid for banjar.\n\n\"Liberal offers necessary to tempt settlers.\u2014Of course these are very favourable terms, and the consequence has been a large immigration into these parts of Bh\u00far, specially into those 15 villages (out of the 41 nakshi villages) which lie, not in the g\u00e1njar, but in the Kundwa Baraunchar chak. It is here that cultivation has increased 300 per cent. The aversion of tenants from the upper country to settle in the g\u00e1njar is, however, overcome by the offer of land on these liberal terms. Thus I have found instances of khudk\u00e1sht ryots cultivating at much lower rates than p\u00e1hi-k\u00e1sht, the landlord having induced them to settle in an unhealthy spot by allowing them to hold at two-thirds of the rent paid by ryots who cultivated the same land, but lived in the next village.\n\n\"But no expenditure necessary on landlord's part.\u2014It need hardly be remarked that this immense spread of cultivation has been effected without the expenditure of a pice on the part of the zamindars who own the land. Year after year their profits increase without the slightest labour or expenditure on their part. No advance is necessary even for building a house, for houses are built in these parts of thatch grass, which the cultivator can cut in the waste lands himself.\"\n\"Sentimental reason for breaking up waste.\u2014When once a cultivator has newly settled in a village a sentimental reason affords an inducement to him to continue this process of breaking up waste. It adds to his importance and repute in the village. The first as\u00e1mi to break up a piece of waste land gives his name to the field thus formed. Many large plots of waste are just broken up in small pieces here and there by one cultivator, his object being to make sure of the whole plot for himself and to prevent any one else from taking possession; the rest of the plot he will break up at his leisure according to his means and inclination.\n\n\"Ignorance of soil leads to sowing mixed crops.\u2014I said that cultivators hardly know yet in these parts of Bh\u00far what the soil is like. A curious result and proof of this ignorance is the practice of sowing mixed crops, which is exceedingly common. Rice and kodo are more frequently mixed perhaps than any other; the idea of course is that one of the two crops will be sure to grow, whatever be the nature of the yet untried soil, kodo requiring a dry, and rice a damp soil. Another motive no doubt is a desire to guard against the uncertainties of the season. Either rice or kodo will grow, whatever be the nature of the season, wet or dry. The former crop will be spoiled by a drought, the latter by two heavy rains; an average wet season will give a good yield from both.\n\n\"Dhankudwa.\u2014The two crops mixed are called dhankudwa. Sometimes the grains are ground together, and the flour made into chap\u00e1t\u00eds, and eaten thus. Sometimes the women of the house go through the severe labour of separating the grains of the two cereals before they are used.\n\n\"Bijhra.\u2014Bijhra is sown for the rabi harvest for the same reasons which induce cultivators to sow dhankudwa for the kharff. Bijhra is the mixture of several rabi crops, such as peas, gram, barley, and wheat, or any two or any three of them, and is very commonly grown. It is not irrigated, and is principally found in mat\u00ed\u00e1r soil. The different grains are not separated, and the flour made of this mixture produces excellent chap\u00e1t\u00eds.\"\n\nPrices.\u2014Prices are generally lower in Kheri than in the adjoining districts. The reason is that money is scarce; it is questionable if the surplus for exportation is larger than in Hardoi or Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. In 1870-71 the following were the prices of the different staples per maund:\n\n|                      | Kheri. | Provincial average. |\n|----------------------|--------|---------------------|\n|                      | Rs.    | a. p.               | Rs.    | a. p.               |\n| Wheat                | 2      | 7 10                | 2      | 9 9                 |\n| Gram                 | 2      | 10 10               | 2      | 12 0               |\n| Coarse rice          | 3      | 5 1                 | 3      | 6 2                 |\n| Coarse sugar (gur)   | 4      | 5 8                 | 4      | 4 7                 |\n| Sambhar salt         | 9      | 10 6                | 8      | 8 5                 |\nThe average price of wheat for the four years ending 1871 was 24 sers for the rupee.*\n\n| Sers. |\n|-------|\n| Barley | ... | ... | ... | ... | 38 |\n| Gram  | ... | ... | ... | ... | 30 |\n| J\u00f1\u00e1r  | ... | ... | ... | ... | 26 |\n| Bajra | ... | ... | ... | ... | 28 |\n| Indian-corn (mak\u00e1i) | ... | ... | ... | ... | 25 |\n\nIn 1869 wheat was 8\u00bd sers for the rupee, gram 9 sers, but the millets were a fair crop and remained at 22 sers from October, when the autumn crop was reaped.

The price of wheat in July\u2014a fair month for placing the market value on that staple and other crops\u2014was (in sers per rupee) as follows:\n\n| 1872. | 1873. | 1874. |\n|-------|-------|-------|\n| Wheat | 17    | 17    | 20\u00bd  |\n| Barley| 34    | 26    | 26    |\n| Gram  | 21    | 20    | 22    |\n\nI now give the price lists for ten years. They must, however, be accepted with considerable reserve. These returns are the average prices at the three tahsil markets of Lakhimpur, Gola, and Muhamdi. These hardly represent the average of the district; they are all situated in the southern quarter, and some portions of the north-westerly parganas are so distant from the nearest tahsil station as to be quite inaccessible in the rains. In fact the price lists, in addition to the usual chances of error, are, in the case of Kheri, especially deceptive, because they represent the rates, not of an entire district, but of a mere corner. On the other hand, these parganas, inaccessible as far as regards the local markets, are intersected by the great navigable rivers, the Kauri\u00e1la and Chauka, which convey their produce direct to Patna and Chupra; consequently, the prices do not vary much from those current in southern Kheri. The variations of price are of course much greater than appear from these averages; wheat has been in 1869 8\u00bd sers per rupee; in 1871 gram, an almost equally valuable grain for nutrition, was at 12 sers per rupee in Kukra.\n\nThe subject of prices and food values has been dwelt upon in the Fyzabad and Bahraich articles. It may be remarked that there are here, as elsewhere in Oudh, three classes of food grains. The first includes wheat and rice, whose average price is about 20 sers the rupee during the last six years; the second includes gram, barley, maize, mung, urd, and the millets, whose average price is from 24 to 30 sers the rupee; lastly, the inferior grains, kodo, sanw\u00e1n, which during the season should not range dearer than 35 sers for the rupee.\n\n* Settlement officer's report.\nStatement showing details of produce and prices in Kheri district for the following years:\n\n| Description of produce | 1861 | 1862 | 1863 | 1864 | 1865 | 1866 | 1867 | 1868 | 1869 | 1870 |\n|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|                        | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- | Aver- |\n|                        | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  | age.  |\n| Paddy                  | 32\u00bd  | 48   | 43\u00bd  | 23   | 29\u00bd  | 32\u00bd  | 34   | 61\u00bd  | 30\u00bd  | 26\u00bd  |\n| Common rice            | 15\u00bd  | 21\u00bd  | 20   | 17\u00bd  | 13   | 17   | 17   | 19\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  | 13\u00bd  |\n| Best rice              | 9    | 9    | 8\u00bd   | 7    | 6\u00bd   | 6\u00bd   | 6\u00bd   | 5\u00bd   | 5\u00bd   | 7\u00bd   |\n| Wheat                  | 21\u00bd  | 29\u00bd  | 23\u00bd  | 18\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 23\u00bd  | 23\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  | 21\u00bd  | 22\u00bd  |\n| Barley                 | 27   | 53\u00bd  | 32\u00bd  | 30\u00bd  | 27\u00bd  | 30\u00bd  | 34\u00bd  | 45\u00bd  | 27\u00bd  | 31\u00bd  |\n| Bajra                  | 38\u00bd  | 40\u00bd  | 40\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 2\u00bd   | 2\u00bd   | 37   | 25\u00bd  | 36   |\n| Juar                   | 30   | 40\u00bd  | 38   | 20\u00bd  | 24\u00bd  | 26\u00bd  | 37\u00bd  | 39   | 33\u00bd  | 25   |\n| Gram                   | 31   | 43   | 30\u00bd  | 26\u00bd  | 18   | 18   | 20\u00bd  | 24\u00bd  | 18\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  |\n| Arhar (Cy. isus ca-   | 26   | 48   | 29   | 22\u00bd  | 13   | 10\u00bd  | 20\u00bd  | 26   | 18   | 19\u00bd  |\n| jan.)                  |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Urd or M\u00e2sh (Pha-     | 17   | 36   | 26   | 14\u00bd  | 16   | 13\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 18\u00bd  | 14\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  |\n| seolus maximus)       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Mothi (Phaseolus      | 24   | 48\u00bd  | 30\u00bd  | 15\u00bd  | 18   | 19\u00bd  | 19   | 25\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  | 18\u00bd  |\n| Aconitfolius)          |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| M\u00e2ng (Phaseolus       | 17   | 33   | 24\u00bd  | 15\u00bd  | 19\u00bd  | 22\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 24\u00bd  | 13\u00bd  | 15\u00bd  |\n| Mungo.)               |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Mas\u00fbr (Erum lea.)     | 34\u00bd  | 35   | 25   | 24\u00bd  | 23\u00bd  | 26   | 28\u00bd  | 32\u00bd  | 26   | 13   |\n| Ahas or Mairs         | 25   | 46   | 40   | 36   | 30   | 30   | 33   | 34   | 36   | 36   |\n| (Pisum sativum)       |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Ghuy\u00e2n (Arum co-      | 40   | 60   | 80   | 90   | 5\u00bd   | 60   | 80   | 80   | 90   | 60   |\n| locasia.)             |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Sarson (Sinapis       | 18   | 21   | 17\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  | 16\u00bd  | 17   | 16   | 16\u00bd  |\n| dichotoma.)           |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| L\u00e2hi (Sinapis ni-     | 17   | 18   | 18\u00bd  | 18   | 18   | 17\u00bd  | 17\u00bd  | 18   | 17\u00bd  | 18   |\n| grs.)                 |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |\n| Raw sugar              | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   | 4    | 4    | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   | 3\u00bd   |\n\nThe rise of prices is really much greater than appears in this table, nor are the tables printed in the official Gazette perfectly correct. In the months of November\u2014January, 1869-70, for instance, wheat and gram are recorded as varying from 10 to 12 sers for the rupee. At that time gram was 9 and wheat 8\u00bd sers for the rupee, to the writer's personal knowledge. Still it is sufficiently evident that there has been a great rise, particularly in maize and other cheap grains.\n\nFamine.\u2014The subject of famine has been discussed at length in the Fyzabad and Bahraich articles, and it is also noted in that of Sitapur. It may here be remarked that there was severe famine in 1769, in 1783-84, and in 1837, while there has been scarcity in 1865, in 1869, and in 1874: all these were caused by deficiency of water. Coarse grain reached 7 sers during these famine times, but whenever the cheapest wholesome grain in the market, whether it be kodo, maize, or barley, be priced for any length of time at a higher rate than 15 sers for the rupee, there will\nundoubtedly be famine. In January, 1874, the cheapest grain reached 18 sers. As in other districts, the periods in which famine is most to be apprehended are the two months before the rabi harvest is cut, January and February, and the two months before the kharif harvest ripens, July and August. There is perhaps less danger of famine in Kheri than in the adjoining district, Bahrach, because the sugarcane crop in January, which is an exceptionally large one, mitigates the former scarcity, and the early half-ripe Indian-corn or makai in August is used by those who have nothing left from their rabi harvest. These famines have all been caused by droughts.\n\nThe rainfall in parts of Kheri is far more capricious than the returns show, which all are made out from statistics furnished from the \"uparh\u00e1r\" or cis-Ul portion of the district, which is not more than half. In the upper or tarai half the rainfall is, although unregistered, still undoubtedly much more irregular. In 1873, for instance, according to all accounts, there were no regular rains whatever in the trans-Ul portion of the district, and the rice crop was in most places a failure. In Kheri itself the rains, though inferior to the average, were still 29 inches, while they can hardly have exceeded 10 in the parganas of Khairigarh, Nighasan, Dhaurahra, and Bhur. The rice crop therefore in 1873 was a failure, as in the adjoining districts; that there was not extensive suffering as in Bahrach and Gouda seems due to several reasons. First, that the people in these parganas were better off, and particularly in Khairigarh, as elsewhere remarked, they had large stores of jewellery. Khairigarh and Dhaurahra had both been mainly under European management, either of the Court of Wards or of European taluqdars, owing to which for some years rents had been low, and savings accumulated. Second, the Oudh Forest Department and their contractors afforded work to large gangs of coolies. Third, the population was largely a grazing, and only partially an agricultural one. There can be no question about the scarcity of grain. I myself examined villages in which it was evident from the appearance of their fields, as from the cultivators' statements, that not one stalk of rice had been cut, and the rabi crop was almost equally a failure. Further, at the Chaukaghat, in April, the carts of the Bhur (trans-Ul) taluqdars were transporting wheat which their owners had bought in the Lakhimpur markets for the supply of their households, as their own crop had been a total failure. The rabi harvest, however, in the southern half of the district was good; population in the northern was sparse,\u2014under 200 to the square mile; it had savings, so the failure of the crops for one season was of no consequence.\n\nRemedies\u2014irrigation, drainage, windmills.\u2014They need not have failed at all if there had been any means of raising water from the numerous rivers, the Kauriala, the Chauka, the Dahawar, and the Suheli. Two-thirds of the land in which the rice crop failed were not twenty feet above the level of ample supplies of the water which would have saved them. The people are not accustomed to irrigate, and indeed they are so weakened by fever that hard labour at the wells would be impossible for many during the rains. Moreover excessive rain is more common than drought; the former may at any time succeed the latter, in which case land which had been irrigated might suffer more than what had been left\nalone. In time it is to be hoped that the natives will do as the Dutch under very similar circumstances have done, viz., employ the wind to control the water, and turn the latter into a beneficial agent. Windmills alone can be employed to drain such large areas of superabundant water or to supply them with what is deficient; in fact, to restore the balance and plenty which alternate floods and drought destroy. The circumstances are exactly analogous, except that the more tenacious soil and comparatively healthy climate of north Kheri would probably assure still greater success for such works than has attended them in the fens of Lincoln and Holland.\n\n\"In draining one of these morasses, or inland seas, and rendering it fit for cultivation, the first operation consists in damming it in with a rampart of earth sufficiently strong and high to prevent foreign water from flowing into it. Outside this rampart or dyke a ringsot or surrounding drain is made, of dimensions sufficient to be a navigable canal. Windmills are then erected on the edge of the dyke, each of which works a water-wheel. Pumps are very seldom used in draining, as the water is usually highly charged with silt, and is not required to be raised a very great height. The instruments employed are, the scoop-wheel the screw of Archimedes, and the inclined scoop-wheel, or chardt wheel. When a great undertaking of drainage is going on houses are erected in a convenient situation on the dyke, where the engineers and a committee of the proprietors constantly reside and carefully watch the progress which the windmills are making.\n\n\"In most cases the undertakers are compelled by Government regulations to complete the drainage at a certain period of the year, for the very obvious reason that, if the ground were not cleared of the water until the beginning of the summer heat, the exhalations would materially increase the marsh fevers which generally prevail in the first years of an extensive drainage.\"\u2014Murray's Hand-book of the Continent, page 12.\n\nOther staples.\u2014The increased cultivation of turmeric, potatoes, yams, tobacco, sugarcane, for all which the soil of north Kheri is well adapted, will also furnish security that in future scarcity of food grains will not become real famine.\n\nThe following table gives the price of the food grains during the scarcity of 1869-70:\n\n| Articles          | July, 1869 | August | September | October | November | January, 1870 | February |\n|-------------------|------------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|----------|\n| Wheat, 1st quality | M.

As to live-stock, little was left. Religious boundaries were annihilated, and all castes or sects were seen to devour what their tenets taught them either to respect or to abhor. Many devoured their own children, and thousands perished while attempting to force open pantries and other places containing victuals, insomuch that it was common to find in the morning the out-offices of our houses half-filled with dying objects, who with their ghastly countenances seemed to express hope, while their tongues gave utterance to curses.\n\n\"The good intention of the donors was productive of a very serious evil, which in the first instance was not, perhaps, sufficiently guarded against. The intelligence was rapidly spread throughout the country that the Europeans at the several military and civil stations had made provision for supplying the poor with rice. This induced all to bend their course towards the nearest asylum. Thousands perished by the way from absolute hunger, while numbers fell an easy prey to the wolves, which being bereft of their usual means of subsistence by the general destruction of all eatable animals, were at first compelled, and afterwards found it convenient, to attack the wretched wanderers. The little resistance they experienced in their depredations on these unfortunate creatures emboldened them in an astonishing manner, and taught them to look with contempt and defiance towards a race of whose powers they were heretofore in awe.\n\n\"Such numbers, however, succeeded in finding their way to the cantonments that we were to all intents in a state of siege. The wolves followed, and were to be seen in all directions committing havoc among the dying crowd. They absolutely occupied many gardens and out-houses, and often in open day trotted about like so many dogs, proceeding from one ravine to another without seeming to entertain the least apprehension. So familiar had they become with mankind, and so little did they seem disposed to remove from what to them was a scene of abundance! I cannot give a stronger idea of our situation than by informing the reader that not only the wolves but even the swine were to be seen in all directions attacking the poor wretches, whose feeble endeavours...\"\nto drive away their ravenous devourers were the only indications that the vital sparks were not quite extinct.\n\n\"The demise of such numbers tainted the air, and caused a sickness among the troops. Many officers died of putrid fevers, and the most serious consequences would inevitably have followed, but for the setting in of the rains, which both abated the extreme heat of the atmosphere and carried off immense quantities of offensive remains. It is not easy to assert how many died, but I heard it stated by some gentlemen of the committee for managing the subscription money that at least two hundred thousand persons had flocked from the country, of whom not more than one in twenty could be maintained for the number of months which must elapse before the soil could render its aid. To calculate upon less than a regular supply until such should be the case would have been absurd, for there was not the smallest probability of the scourge being abated in the meanwhile. The lower provinces, as before remarked, could do little more than support themselves, and no periodical supply of the fruits, &c., usually produced in the rainy season could be expected in a country of which nearly two-thirds of the population was destroyed.\n\n\"This mournful scene, however, gradually drew to a close. The unfortunate group had either died or had been restored to health, and were capable of returning to their occupations. The wolves now felt themselves bereft of their usual prey, but did not lose their habit of attacking men, many of whom, though in general provided with some means of defence which circumstances had rendered necessary, yet became victims to their depredations, till at length measures could be taken to check their rapacity, and they were obliged to have recourse to their former researches for food.\"\u2014Forbes' Oriental Memoir; vol. III, page 59.\n\nBlight, droughts, floods.\u2014The rains, as already remarked, are more copious in Kheri than in southern Oudh. Still rain fails in January and February frequently, and whatever crops cannot be irrigated suffer severely. Floods are very destructive in Dhaurahra, Srinagar, and Firozabad from the Chauka in Kheri, northern Paila, Haidarabad, from the local rainfall which causes the jhils to overflow the neighbouring fields. Muhamdi, Magdapur, Paila, Khairigarh have good slopes generally and do not suffer from floods. Hailstorms seldom occur. The girwi or red rust is described in the account of Lucknow district; it does little harm generally, but the weevil often ruins the gram crop. Locusts have never done much harm in this district, although Hardoi to the south has been greatly plagued by them. In fine, floods are the only natural calamity from which the country suffers, and till State works are taken in hand the Chauka will continue to devastate, as it does now, some three hundred square miles annually. Its effects are often good, as in some places the deposit is fertilizing, and it is doubtful if it would pay to embank a river whose bottom has a descent of one hundred and eighty feet in its course through the district of about 110 miles, and which consequently has a current in the rains of about four miles per hour.\n\nFood and condiments.\u2014The food of the people consists principally of ju\u00e1r, bajra, (called also lahra), kodo, sanw\u00e1n, ground and made into cakes;\nalso of arhar, mothi, urd, masur, boiled as pottage, and of rice. There is a certain rotation; one day a man will eat ju\u00e1r cakes, a second day rice, a third day kodo cakes, a fourth day urd or mothi pottage; he will try to vary his diet as much as possible. The quantities he eats will vary with the food. A strong labouring man will eat $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ser of kodo or s\u00e1nw\u00e1n, but $1\\frac{1}{4}$ ser ju\u00e1r, b\u00e1jra, or urd, and only 1 ser of gram; a slight built man will consume one quarter less. The following is the stated daily consumption of a family consisting of five children, father, mother, and grandmother, children aged 3 to 15. The father ate $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ser of b\u00e1jra, wife and mother 2 sers, the five children $2\\frac{1}{4} = 5\\frac{1}{2}$. They also used one quarter kachcha ser per day of salt, but they would have preferred more if they could have afforded it. This is $1\\frac{1}{4}$rd chhat\u00e1k per day per head, but the more liberal allowance in their case was $1\\frac{1}{4}$ kachcha ser in four days, $1\\frac{1}{4}$ kachcha sers or 51 pakka sers in the year. The bazar rate was 7 sers, so this head of a family (a chaukidar) had to pay Rs. 7-5-0 per annum for salt. His pay was nominally five bighas, or less than three acres of land.\n\nBut let us be a little more exact. This chaukidar did not boast the possession of any coin of the realm, but he had five local sers of ju\u00e1r which he was going to exchange for $1\\frac{1}{4}$ ser of salt to last him four days; so he paid $1\\frac{1}{4}$ kachha ser of grain per day in exchange for salt, which will be in the year 205 pakka sers. At the time urd was selling at 23 sers for the rupee, so he was paying at the rate of Rs. 9 per annum for salt. This calculation confirms the other; as of course the purchaser by barter would have to give a double profit to the shopkeeper, and would thus purchase dearer. It is obvious that when ju\u00e1r gets dearer he will pay a smaller quantity, but the same money value for his quantum of salt. Further, this head of a family has to procure five and half sers for food per day, which will be 2,007 sers per annum, and for salt 205, or, allowing for the greater purchasing power of gram further on in the year, 150 sers. He will expend therefore 2,157 sers of coarse grain in the year. Now the average price of such grain has been 33 sers per rupee during the last ten years. It is now 23 sers, so his average income must have been equivalent to Rs. 65, and must now be Rs. 94 per annum. What were his earnings? They must have been under Rs. 30 for himself, and perhaps his eldest one might earn Rs. 10 more. He himself declared that his rent-free land and the bis\u00e1r or field gleanings which he got as village watchman produced him 30 maunds kachcha, or 540 sers that year, worth about Rs. 30, as most of it would be wheat or gram; but it was only a twelve-anna crop, and other years his share of the grain and his grain rents might be worth Rs. 40. His sons would be required to aid in looking after the crops, and the two calculations of his income about agree. It must be remembered that the 720 sers of mixed grain which he would get in an average year represent about 950 sers of the coarser grain which he consumes. At any rate it is impossible to see how this chaukidar, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, could supply more than half his actual consumption from honest and recognized sources, while it is certain that if this family required Rs. 7 worth of salt, very few families of the labouring classes can get as much as they require in Oudh. This family is now spending upon salt barter five kachcha sers of grain.\nin four days; it was consuming in the four days 44\u00bd kachcha sers of coarse grain, so 10 per cent. of the expenditure in food is placed to the account of salt. When grain becomes dearer the proportion will rise to 7 per cent.\n\nThe broad result is that salt, even if none is given to cattle, costs a family from 6 to 8 per cent. of its entire expenditure, fuel being nothing, and clothes a mere trifle. Of course in Kheri and Sitapur salt is dearer than in Unao and Lucknow, through which districts it comes. We have seen also that this family consumed 51 pakka sers; now allowing double as much to adults as to infants after the analogy of the food each child will get, that will allow 4 sers 9\u00bd chhat\u00e1ks for each child, 9 sers 2\u00bd chhat\u00e1ks for each adult. There are 6,700,000 adults, and 4,500,000 children under the age of 15 in Oudh; therefore adults will consume 1,534,000 maunds, and children 612,000 maunds\u20142,146,000 in all. The alleged imports into the province average 700,000 maunds.\n\nThe rule about the consumption of salt is a fixed one: one chhat\u00e1k of salt should go to one ser of wheat, and 2 pice weight of salt or 1\u00bd pice go to the ordinary allowance of d\u00e1l, which is one quarter ser (five pice go to a chhat\u00e1k); therefore if a man eats only vegetables he will consume eight sers at the 1\u00bd pice rate, or 9 sers 2 chhat\u00e1ks at the 2 pice rate, and if he eats meat every day he will consume half a ser, and its allowance of salt, half a chhat\u00e1k, will be 11 sers 6 chhat\u00e1ks, in addition to the d\u00e1l allowance. However, he will probably only eat meat, even if a Musalman, every second day, and his whole consumption of salt will be 8 sers on d\u00e1l, and 5 sers 9\u00bd chhat\u00e1ks on meat\u2014in all 13 sers 9 chhatakas. The calculation is confirmed by the actual account of a respectable Musalman family of eight adults with servants, whose monthly consumption was 10 sers of salt, or 15 sers per head annually; this family consumed meat daily; on the other hand some of them were women, so the theoretical and the practical consumptions agree very fairly.\n\nWe may therefore lay down the consumption as follows for adults; minors will consume half: respectable flesh-eating Musalmans or Hindus with family incomes of Rs. 30 per mensem and upwards, 15 sers per head; mainly vegetable eating Hindus or Musalmans with incomes of Rs. 6 to 30 per mensem, 10\u00bd sers; the first class will use Lahore salt at 5 sers for the rupee, the second well salt at 7 sers for the rupee. The small cottier farmers and the labourers will not eat salt regularly at all; for it is perfectly obvious that if an ordinary family consists of two adults and three children, and if the proper allowance of salt will then be 31 sers, costing Rs. 4-6 per annum, and if a labourer's pay is Rs. 30, all which facts are proved, then a proper allowance of salt will come to 14 per cent. on his income, and he will not spend it. A small respectable native household of eight persons in Lucknow will spend Rs. 24 per annum on salt alone. In fact more than a month's entire income goes in salt for the year when families spend according to the rule which native experience dictates. It would appear then that to the upper classes the present price is not prohibitive in any degree. The present system raises the natural price of an indigenous\ncommodity from one rupee to five rupees eight annas per maund, and the state thereby easily collects a large tax. It may be added here that the jail allowance is 5 sers 11 chhat\u00e1ks for all the prisoners, or one quarter chhat\u00e1k per day. This is at the rate of about six sers for each adult and three sers for each child; it is much below the rate sanctioned in some other provinces, and less than the amount which people will voluntarily consume (vide above statistics). The salt department declares that two sers per head are sufficient. It is probable that man would live in very tolerable health for years on this allowance; but as the experiment has admittedly never been tried, more exact statistics are awaited as to what longevity can be achieved on two sers of salt per annum.\n\nCondition of the agriculturists.\u2014The condition of the major portion of the agricultural peasantry is wretched in the extreme. Their clothing is insufficient, and their food, as we have seen, consists either of kodo, and ju\u00e1r meal made into cakes, and eaten with d\u00e1l, or of new rice, which is an unwholesome diet unless most carefully harvested. Very few of them ever touch wheaten bread, while condiments, such as gh\u00ed and spices, are used in quantities so minute as to fail of any material effect upon the vigour of the peasant.\n\nThe rural population of Kheri are compelled in large numbers to watch their fields at night, in order to preserve them from the depredations of wild animals. They are perched upon platforms elevated eight feet above the ground, and thinly covered with brush-wood or thatch. During the winter months the cold in those cages is extreme. As a rule, the watchers possess a blanket\u2014often the only one in the family,\u2014but not infrequently it is found that the whole household cannot muster a single blanket to protect the field-watcher from the inclemency of the weather.\n\nManufactures and trade.\u2014The district manufactures call for hardly any remarks. Weaving and cotton printing, both of the coarsest kind, are pursued by 3,155 and by 990 artificers respectively: Kheri pargana is the principal seat of both, but there is no export of either product. Grain of all kinds is exported from the district, but it is impossible to give any exact statistics, because the returns only show what is sent out of the province. The other exports are turmeric, tobacco, timber of all kinds, sugar, syrup, hides, bullocks, and gh\u00ed. Catechu is made in large quantities throughout the northern parts of the district from the Acacia catechu, here called Khair. The heart-wood is chopped out and boiled down by a caste called Khairs. Khas-khas (Andropogon muricatum), whose roots are used for making tattis, is exported in large quantities, being taken down the Gumti and the Gogra to Benares and Patna.\n\nThe great fairs of Gola Gokarann\u00e1th are hopeful features in the district trade. There are two, one in January, which is attended by almost 50,000 people, the other in February, which lasts about fifteen days, and at which 150,000 persons are said to assemble. The great fair is increasing rapidly in fame and number of attendants; goods worth about Rs. 150,000 being sold annually by traders from all parts of India.\nThe imports into Kheri from the North-Western Provinces in 1872 consisted of\u2014\n\n| Maunds | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Cotton | 28,300 | Rs. 3,61,000 |\n| Salt   | 74,454 | Rs. 4,23,229 |\n| Khari* | 4,712  | Rs. 22,531 |\n| Country cloth | | Rs. 1,70,000 |\n| English piece-goods | | Rs. 19,101 |\n\nTotal 11,26,500\n\nThe exports\u2014\n\n| Maunds | Rs. |\n|--------|-----|\n| Tobacco | 28,300 | Rs. 72,000 |\n| Edible grains | 84,000 | Rs. 1,31,000 |\n| Timber | | Rs. 12,000 |\n| Country cloth | | Rs. 21,000 |\n| Sugar | 4,800 | Rs. 28,000 |\n| Spices\u2020 | 6,686 | Rs. 38,583 |\n\nTotal 3,69,365\n\nIt thus appears that imports are three times as valuable as exports. The only mistakes apparent in the above official return are the valuations of tobacco and sugar; the former ought to be priced at about Rs. 7 per maund instead of three; the latter, which is a coarse article, might fairly be valued at Rs. 2-8-0 instead of Rs. 6-0-0. Still it is evident that the imports largely exceed in value the exports except as regards the oil-seed and grain trade, which passes mainly by the Chauka and Kauriala to Patna and Dinapore. Timber also goes down the Suheli; charcoal down the Gumti to Lucknow. None of these matters are credited to the district. The Kheri grain too, which is loaded on boats at the ghats of the Chauka and Kauriala rivers, is credited to Fyzabad; because in its passage down the Gogra it coasts that district, although it never even passes through it. This defect in the district returns renders them all deceptive.\n\nRiver trade.\u2014The principal ghats or landing places on the Chauka in the Kheri district are Dulhamau and Pachperi on the Chauka and Shitabi and Katai ghats on the Kauriala. From them grain is exported either to Bahramghat for the local Lucknow demand, or to Dinwanganghat seven miles west of Fyzabad; from thence other traders take it by rail or river to Lucknow or Patna. Or lastly, grain goes to Simaria ghat fifteen miles west of Patna, near Chupra.\n\nThe boats.\u2014The traffic is carried on in flat-bottomed boats, of which the smallest are mere hollow sal trees, drawing two and a half to three feet, it is said, when loaded, but certainly floating when empty in twelve inches; they will carry 200 local maunds, or 3,600 sers, or about three tons and a quarter. The next largest size is about 500 maunds or 18,000 lbs, above eight tons: they draw four feet when loaded. The largest size is equal to the carriage of 1,200 local maunds, or nearly twenty tons; they require four to five feet water. The smallest size costs about Rs. 80, the largest about Rs. 400. They belong to Kahars called, when practising this\n\n* Sulphate of Soda. \u2020 Turmeric.\ntrade, Gorias. They are hired out to the grain merchants at a rate per hundred maunds of carriage.\n\nCost of carriage.\u2014This varies every year, and is now* Rs. 9 from Shit\u00e1big\u00e1h\u00e1t and Rs. 5 from Chahl\u00e1ri gh\u00e1t per hundred maunds to Dinw\u00e1n, and from Shit\u00e1big\u00e1h\u00e1t to Chupra Rs. 15. These rates are more than double those ordinarily current. The rate to Simariagh\u00e1t from Chahl\u00e1ri was Rs. 5; it is now 12 and Rs. 10 from Bahramghat. Even at this rate the railway cannot compete with river traffic. The same amount of grain at the low rate of \u00bdth of a pie per mile per maund will cost about Rs. 10 to take to Patna by rail, the distance being about 400 miles, although it will be reduced to 300 when the Oudh and Rohilkhand line is completed. It is true that the voyage will last fifteen days by water and only three by rail, but that is no advantage, rather a loss to the shipper, who has his grain stored for him in the vessel while the price is rising.\n\nThe abovementioned rates also include the return voyage, and although the boats are often empty, yet they sometimes bring Bengal rice and salt from Patna. This is English salt, which up to 1872 came as far as Bahramghat, and sold there at Rs. 5 per maund, but the opening of the railway to Fyzabad has reduced the price of Punjab salt, and driven the English out of the market. Still it is evident that in ordinary years river carriage, as far as the traffic between Oudh and Bengal is concerned, is one hundred per cent cheaper than railway. The present high rates for boat hire also prevailed in 1867, and were caused doubtless by the scarcity in Bengal. The traffic continues all the year. During the rains the east wind may generally be depended on, and boats go up-stream at the rate of 40 miles in a day if circumstances are favourable. An average voyage from Dinw\u00e1n to Chahl\u00e1ri and back\u2014a distance of 130 miles\u2014should be completed in twelve days. Of the boat hire abovementioned half is taken by the owner of the boat and half goes to the four men who pull or pole it along. Two men will manage a small boat. The grain-dealers are of all castes, but the boat-owners are all Kah\u00e1rs or Gorias. Boats engaged in the Bengal trade go up the Kew\u00e1n\u00ed to S\u00e1ndi, six miles beyond Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrabad, but only in the rains; it might easily be made navigable all the year round. The traders complain of many shallows above Rajpur near Chahl\u00e1ri on the Chauka. In the Nawabi the trade was almost confined to Khargugh\u00e1t in N\u00e1np\u00e1ra and Bahramghat; every landholder who had a fortalice on the bank made the boats pay transit dues. At Mall\u00e9pur, Baundi, Chahl\u00e1righ\u00e1t, Bhitauli, every ten or twelve miles in fact, the vessel had to bring to and pay dues.\n\nThe grain carried to Bengal was generally maize and millets of sorts, gram, wheat, oil-seeds, but in 1873, for the first time in the merchants' memory, kodo was exported and formed the main article of traffic. This probably indicated that there was no other grain in any abundance, and that the Oudh people was trenching on its food stores.\n\nMinerals.\u2014There are no mineral productions, except a little petroleum in Khairigarh. Kankar of good quality in large slabs is met with near Gola. Saltpetre is manufactured in quantity at Dhaurahra.\n\n* 1874.\nRoads and communications.\u2014There are no metalled roads in the district except that from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Sitapur, which passes for 21 miles through the south-west corner. One raised and bridged road runs from Sitapur through Oel to Lakh\u00edmpur, 28 miles, thence to Gola, 20 miles, and thence to Muhamdi, 18 miles. The accompanying table shows the length and direction of each road, and also proves how inferior the communications are, as seven of the roads are useless for five months of the year. It is, no doubt, very costly to construct bridges in this district, not so much owing to the violence of the floods as to the alluvial nature of the soil, which affords no firm foundation, and which is liable every year to be pierced by new channels, which render the old bridges useless. Since the suppression of the mutinies many bridges have been built, including two over the Gumti; the cost of these works has in some instances been as high as Rs. 20,000.\n\n### Kheri roads.\n\n| Number | Name of road | Length of road | Description of road | Masonry bridges | Pile bridges | Number of sarais on the sides of road | Remarks |\n|--------|--------------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|---------|\n| 1      | Lakh\u00edmpur to Sitapur. | 10\u00bd | Unmetalled. | 1 | 8 | One at Oel. | Used throughout the year. |\n| 2      | Ditto to Mahewa. | 2\u00bd | Ditto | ... | 2 | ... | Not much used. |\n| 3      | Ditto to Kheri. | 3\u00bd | Ditto | ... | ... | ... | Practicable throughout the year. |\n| 4      | Ditto via Muhamdi to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. | 44 | Ditto | 1 | 11 | 4 | One at Sikandarabad and the other at Muhamdi. |\n| 5      | Ditto via Gola to Muhamdi. | 38 | Ditto | ... | 10 | 1 | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 6      | Gola to Aliaganj. | 8 | Ditto | ... | 2 | 1 | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 7      | Do. to Koth\u00e1r. | 12 | Ditto | ... | ... | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 8      | Lakh\u00edmpur to Bahraich. | 10 | Ditto | ... | ... | ... | Not practicable during the rains. |\n| 9      | From the boundary of the Sitapur district to the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur boundary. | 21 | Metalled. | ... | ... | One at Mai-kalganj. | Practicable throughout the year; join the road projected for railway. |\n| 10     | Lakh\u00edmpur to Khairigarh. | 33 | Unmetalled. | ... | ... | ... | Not practicable during the rains. |\n| 11     | Ditto via Aliaganj to Mai-l\u00e1n\u00ed. | 36 | Ditto | ... | 2 | 1 | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 12     | Ditto to Mai-kalganj. | 22 | Ditto | ... | 3 | 2 | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 13     | Gola to Bh\u00far... | 17\u00bd | Ditto | ... | 2 | ... | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 14     | Matera to Falia, | 43 | Ditto | ... | ... | ... | Do. do. do. |\n| 15     | Lakh\u00edmpur to Sing\u00e1hi. | 2 | Ditto | ... | ... | 1 | ... | Do. do. do. |\nThe following is an extract from official route book. The principal district roads are\u2014\n\n(1.) From Sitapur to Lakhimpur. This passes for 28 miles within the boundaries of this district. The stages are Oel and Lakhimpur; the latter 8 miles from the former. There are 5 n\u00e1las on this road.\n\n(2.) From Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to Lakhimpur. This road passes for 52\u00bd miles throughout this district. The stages are\u2014\n\nMuhammadpur 9 miles from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Muhamdi 10 miles further, Kumbhi 7\u00bd miles, Sikandarabad 8\u00bd miles, Kaimahra 9 miles, and Lakhimpur 8\u00bd miles. The rivers are the Sukheta (not bridged), the Gumti (bridged), the Kathna (bridged), the Sar\u00e1yan (bridged), and the Jamw\u00e1ri (bridged). There are 8 n\u00e1las on this road.\n\n(3.) From Sitapur to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur in the North-Western Provinces. This passes for 33\u00bd miles throughout this district. The stages are Maholia 14 miles from Sitapur, Maikalganj 9 miles further, and Udaipur 10 miles. The rivers are the Sar\u00e1yan, the Perhi, the Kathna, and the Gumti\u2014all of which are bridged. There are only 2 n\u00e1las.\n\n(4.) From Sitapur to Pil\u00edbh\u00edt in the North-Western Provinces. This passes for 45 miles throughout this district. The stages are\u2014\n\nBarwar 6 miles from the border of the Sitapur district, and Muhamdi 10 miles from the former. The rivers are the Sar\u00e1yan, the Perhi, the Kathna, and the Gumti\u2014all bridged except the last.\n\nWeights and measures.\u2014The weights used in the principal bazars are the legal ser and maund, the ser being 2\u00b7057 lbs., but the local weights are very different. The local ser still used exclusively in rural life and conjointly in all the principal bazars is a small one; five sers are roughly equal to two and a quarter Government sers, and the ordinary multiple used in transactions is five. The bani\u00e1n will buy the villager\u2019s grain at so many \u201cpas\u00e9ris,\u201d or weight of five sers, equal to 4\u00b79 lbs. per rupee. The local ser is almost equal to an English pound. The local maund is equal to eighteen Government sers. The pas\u00e9ri has increased in size since annexation; it was formerly 29 gandas of six rupees, it is now 30 gandas; it formerly equalled 2 sers 3\u00bd chhat\u00e1ks, now it equals 2 sers 4 chhat\u00e1ks. The ordinary mode of reckoning is by takas; each taka equivalent to half a ganda. The pas\u00e9ri in general use is equivalent to 60 takas or 30 gandas; at least so it is said; but if the ganda consists of six chhirad\u00e1r rupees of 180 grains each, the pas\u00e9ri will weigh 32,400 grains; whereas the pas\u00e9ri does admittedly weigh 2\u00bd sers exactly which comes to 32,600 grains. There is some mistake in the shop-keeper\u2019s assertions on the subject. There are variations throughout the district. In Khairigarh the pas\u00e9ri is equal to 62 takas. In Muhamdi an indigenous pakka ser is current. This is equivalent to 96 machhlid\u00e1r or Lucknow rupees of 172* grains. This is supposed to be one quarter larger than the Government ser, but really it is little more than a seventh larger. We have also the large maund used for dealings in tobacco and gur, and equivalent to twenty-four pas\u00e9ris.\n\n* Prinsep\u2019s Tables, page 56.\nLand measures.\u2014The local unit of area is the kachcha or small bigha. Its area varies in every pargana and in every village. On the average, south of the Ul above five go to an acre, north of the Ul about three and a half; but there is no certainty, as the people say it depends on the length of the patwari's foot and that on the pleasure of the landlord. Sugarcane and garden crops are always measured by a smaller bigha than other crops. Disputes between landlord and tenant on this head have occurred occasionally.\n\nIt may be considered desirable to go into the details of the land measures. The unit of all mensuration is the kasi or double pace which consists of 26 girahs, each girah being $2\\frac{1}{2}$ anguls or finger-breadths; therefore the kasi consists of 65 finger-breadths. The standard yard of 36 inches consists of 19 girahs or $47\\frac{1}{2}$ anguls; therefore the kasi is $49\\frac{1}{4}$ inches, four feet one inch and a quarter. Now (20) twenty kasis square or four hundred square kasis make the kachcha bigha in common use; therefore the common bigha should be 82 feet 5 inches square, and the area should be almost 749 square yards. It must be remembered that the ordinary or tailor's yard is only 16 girahs.\n\nThe above is called the \"jamai kasi,\" or measure for land paying money rent. When land is on bat\u00e1\u00ed terms, that is to say, when a portion of the produce is taken, there is no motive on the landlord's part for diminishing the measure of length; then the kasi is extended to 72 anguls or about 29 girahs, equal to 1:52 of the standard yard, and the bigha to 924:2 square yards. The standard bigha of the North-Western Provinces is 3,025 square yards, the acre is 4,840 square yards, so the local bigha is sometimes less than a sixth of an acre, sometimes a little less than one-fifth. The gaz and the jarfb, it will be observed, are not mentioned at all\u2014vide Prinsep's useful Tables, pages 123\u2014127.\n\nIn fine the area of a field, and consequently the rent payable by the tenant, are determined by the length of the patwari's stride as he paces along its edge. In Oudh the patwari is the paid servant of the landlord. That the bigha is not a great deal smaller than it is may be due to the action of the former native Government, which retained in theory and often exercised in practice the right of taking direct possession of all lands except the taluqdar's n\u00e1nk\u00e1r or personal demesne. It was understood also that the landlord was to hand over all his collections from the tenants to Government, less certain authorized allowances. It was the landlord's interest to make the sum which he had to pay Government on his rent-roll appear as small as possible. Now the rent per bigha could not be entered lower than was usual in the neighbourhood because the Government officer would at once order the rate to be raised. It was easier to use a larger bigha than the authorized one, because such a fraud could not be detected without measurements. Therefore the landlord used a large bigha at any rate for his or his relatives sir lands and for high caste men, often, indeed, for all his tenants. He made up for the diminution of his rent-roll so caused by taking numerous cesses of all kinds. Formerly, therefore, it was the joint interest of the landlord and tenant that the bigha should be a large one; now their wishes and interests are diverse and\nadverse on this point. Formerly both were united against the Government, the real landlord; now Government has ceased practically to be a landlord, and has handed over all its powers and opportunities to the taluqdar.\n\nOne result in Kheri will be that the bigha will get smaller and smaller. Already there have been contests in the law courts: the landlords even went so far as to say that the sugarcane bigha was only 52 anguls, one-fifth less than the above mentioned \"jam\u0101i kasi.\" Then the bigha would be under 66 feet square, and the area, 484 square yards, would be just one-tenth of an acre. This last has been frequently imposed on sugarcane fields by the landlord; it is called the \"bawan kasi.\" There is nothing peculiar about the measures of length.\n\nWages: rate of interest.\u2014There is no large class of either carpenters or smiths in the district. Work of this kind is done for the rich generally by permanent dependents of their own who receive grants of land for the poor by the regular village servants who are paid by a portion of the grain reaped at harvest. When this is not the case village carpenters and smiths get as low as 2\u00bd annas per day, superior workmen in the town 3 and 4 annas; goldsmiths work in silver at half an anna for each rupee-weight made up; in gold at one anna for plain work. There has been no rise of wages. Ploughmen get 1\u00bd sers daily, and generally a blanket. Children are largely employed for frightening away birds and animals from the crops; they get two pice a day for the month before the crop is ripe. Reaping is paid by a share of the crop, generally every twentieth heap. Digging is paid for by the piece; when waste land is broken up two and a half to three bighas for the rupee are exacted. A labourer can earn Rs. 2-12-0 per month in this way.\n\nApparently there are very small savings in the district, except in Palia, where the rents are low, probably because the pargana was till 1866 in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur; in Khairigarh also the tenant class make a good deal of money in breeding cattle. In these parganas the women wear a great deal of jewellery, and the group round a well is sometimes bright with silver ornaments; but as a rule the poorer women wear very little, nothing but a nose-ring.\n\nThe following is a letter from the tahsildar of Muhamdi on this subject:\n\n\"The needy husbandman has to borrow at seed time when grain is dearest, and has to repay at harvest time when grain is commonly cheapest. The grain lent is generally valued at the price ruling at seed time, and is repaid at harvest in the amount of grain then purchasable for the same sum as well as for interest at 2 annas per rupee. For instance, if a cultivator borrows grain, the value of which according to the rate prevailing in the borrowing season is Rs. 2, he would have to give grain purchasable for Rs. 2-4-0 at the harvest. If, however, the grain is not repaid at the next harvest, but remains due, the tenant has to pay interest at 4 annas per rupee in kind in addition to the grain purchasable for the original value of grain. When the grain is not very dear at the seed time it is lent on interest at deorha (\u00bd), or saw\u0101ya (\u00bc) rate: for instance, if a tenant borrows 20 sers of grain he would deliver 30 or 25 sers at the harvest.\noccasionally loans of inferior grain are repaid in the same weight of superior. Advances of grain for food and maintenance are also repaid at the above rates, with but one slight difference which is this; if the tenant borrows grain only for two months prior to the cutting of his harvest, he has generally to repay the loan in kind without interest at the rate ruling at the harvest. For instance, if a tenant borrows 15 sers of wheat valued Re. 1 in February at the rate ruling in that month, he will have to pay wheat of one rupee only at the rate prevailing at the harvest.\n\n\"Cultivators of sugarcane are mostly in debt. The cultivation of sugarcane is ordinarily commenced and completed with the usurious aid of native bankers, and a single bad season places the cultivator in pecuniary difficulties from which he finds it most difficult to extricate himself for years. Advances for sugarcane cultivation are generally made from August to January on terms of usury proportioned to the borrower's need, and on the security of his anticipated crop, and the cultivator generally promises to supply saccharine produce to the lender. An agreement is almost always exacted to pay loss of profits, at varying rates, but generally at Re. 1 per maund for as many maunds as the cultivator fails to deliver at the appointed time, and this is paid of course in addition to the unpaid loan. The account is generally closed in Bh\u00e1don (August) and a balance struck against the cultivator; and a contract to deliver r\u00e9b of that balance at the next season is implied, even if not expressed. The numbers of the indebted cultivators of crops other than sugarcane are not increasing, on the contrary they are decreasing since the Nawabi.\n\n\"The rents in this tahsil are to a great extent paid in money, and the high prices of produce ruling in the reign of British Government, joined with the apparent immunity they now enjoy from the exactions and oppressions of landlords, are favourable to them.\n\n\"The following is the rate of wages paid to labourers:\n\n\"In Muhamdli ... ... ... 1\u00bd anna.\nIn villages ... ... ... 1 anna, 1\u00bd anna.\n1\u00bd anna.\"\nCHAPTER III.\n\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nPopulation of the district\u2014Occupations of the people\u2014Religion\u2014The Manjua festival\u2014The worship of Mah\u00e1deo\u2014Castes of Kheri\u2014Meaning of caste\u2014The P\u00e1sis\u2014The Ahirs\u2014The Kurmis\u2014The Chhatris\u2014Influence of the Chhatris\u2014Causes of their ascendancy\u2014Tenures\u2014List of taluqdars of the district\u2014Tabular statement showing the tribal distribution of property\u2014Village communities the first form of society\u2014The non-agriculturists.\n\nPopulation of the district.\u2014The census was taken in 1869, no regular enumeration having been previously made. The population of Kheri district is 737,732, or 232 to the square mile of total area, but, deducting the Government forest from which cultivation is excluded, the population is 281 to the square mile. The adjoining district of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, one similar in all physical aspects, has a population of 437 to the square mile. There is nothing to account for this except the fact that the latter district has enjoyed for seventy years the benefits of English rule. Of this population 73,575 or ten per cent are Musalmans; but as this is the average proportion in the province, and indeed approximates that of the whole empire, it calls for no remarks. There are 399,275 males, and 338,457 females, or a percentage of 54 males to 46 females. The accompanying table gives a slightly different result. I cannot say which is more reliable:\n\nDistrict Kheri\u2014Area and Population.\n\n| Tahsil | Pargana | Number of manzahs or townships | Area in square British statute miles | Population |\n|--------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n|        |         |                               | Total | Cultivated | Hindus | Musalmans | Males | Females | Total | No. of persons to each square mile |\n| Kheri  | 192     | 193                           | 130   | 88,930     | 15,996 | 55,266    | 49,650 |          | 104,916 | 517 |\n| Srinagar | 146     | 229                           | 120   | 68,253     | 7,581  | 4,770     | 58,076 |          | 75,840  | 285 |\n| Bh\u00far   | 189     | 376                           | 135   | 68,358     | 5,613  | 40,306    | 33,665 |          | 78,971  | 181 |\n| Paila  | 117     | 103                           | 58    | 23,056     | 3,993  | 18,651    | 18,698 |          | 35,349  | 345 |\n| Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed | 61 | 177                           | 20    | 10,813     | 1,923  | 6,788     | 5,448  |          | 12,286  | 239 |\n| Total  | 705     | 1,078                         | 463   | 267,906    | 34,408 | 161,781   | 140,531 |          | 302,312 | 304 |\n\n| Tahsil | Pargana | Number of manzahs or townships | Area in square British statute miles | Population |\n|--------|---------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n|        |         |                               | Total | Cultivated | Hindus | Musalmans | Males | Females | Total | No. of persons to each square mile |\n| Firozabad | 91     | 163                           | 104   | 52,938     | 4,559  | 30,491    | 27,006 |          | 57,497  | 355 |\n| Dhanraha | 121     | 241                           | 152   | 64,877     | 5,990  | 38,093    | 32,704 |          | 70,797  | 268 |\n| Nighasan | 74      | 263                           | 119   | 55,820     | 2,622  | 31,645    | 26,207 |          | 57,642  | 212 |\n| Khair\u00edgarh | 70    | 410                           | 68    | 30,983     | 2,063  | 14,366    | 14,680 |          | 33,046  | 78  |\n| Paila   | 56      | 139                           | 37    | 18,576     | 1,794  | 1,553     | 8,877  |          | 20,970  | 146 |\n| Total   | 406     | 1,256                         | 480   | 222,696    | 16,858 | 180,198   | 109,414 |          | 239,853 | 183 |\n### District Kheri\u2014Area and Population\u2014(continued.)\n\n| Pargana | Number of mauzahs or townships | Area in square British statute miles | Population |\n|---------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|\n|         |                                | Total | Cultivated | Hindus | Musalmans | Males | Females | Total | No. of persons to each square mile |\n| Muhamdi | 136                            | 116  | 66         | 42,371 | 6,645     | 26,538 | 22,478  | 49,016 | 432   |\n| Pasgawan | 165                            | 121  | 48         | 34,886 | 5,862     | 22,264 | 18,284  | 40,448 | 301   |\n| Aurangabad | 118                        | 116  | 58         | 27,086 | 1,737     | 15,881 | 12,919  | 28,822 | 243   |\n| Rasta    | 73                             | 95   | 29         | 29,356 | 1,733     | 17,241 | 14,048  | 31,299 | 329   |\n| Haidarabad | 108                        | 98   | 41         | 30,997 | 4,711     | 19,997 | 16,411  | 35,708 | 317   |\n| Magdapur | 36                             | 56   | 30         | 8,571  | 1,378     | 5,411  | 4,533   | 9,949  | 178   |\n| Atwa Piparia | 32                        | 64   | 23         | 7,819  | 977       | 4,976  | 3,820   | 8,796  | 137   |\n| **Total** | **663**                        | **666** | **304** | **181,086** | **23,043** | **111,608** | **92,521** | **204,129** | **266** |\n\n| District Total | 1,774 | 3,000 | 1,247 | 671,686 | 74,307 | 403,827 | 342,466 | 745,993 | 345 |\n\n| European | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 66 | 12 | 73 |\n| Eurasian | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 10 | 8 | 18 |\n| Prisoners, &c., in jail. | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 234 | 27 | 261 |\n\n| **Grand Total** | 1,774 | 3,000 | 1,247 | 671,686 | 74,307 | 403,827 | 342,513 | 746,350 | 345 |\n\n**Note.\u2014** In this table the figures are not exactly the same as those referred to in the letter press. The former represents the population of the district compiled from the village returns of 1869, added up afresh in 1871; the latter gives the figures in the Oudh census report, the discrepancy cannot be accounted for except by clerical errors in the census report.\n\n**Occupation of the people.**\u2014According to the census returns 33 per cent. of the Hindus and 54 per cent. of the Muhammadans are not engaged in agricultural pursuits, but it is doubtful whether this return is correct, there being hardly any manufactures and little trade to employ such a large proportion of the people. There are 164,452 male adults engaged in agriculture, and they occupy on an average five acres of land each; but this includes fallows which, in this district owing to the want of manure, are of large extent. The number of landed proprietors is very small, (4,209), but thirty of them hold three quarters of the entire district. The occupations will be referred to again under trade and manufactures.\n\n**Religion.**\u2014The Hindu religion of Kheri is that common to the rest of Oudh, except that the worship of Mah\u00e1deo or Shiva is more exclusively in the ascendant. The largest gatherings are at Gola in honour of this divinity, at Marwa in Dhaurahra pargana, in honour of a local hermit, Munna D\u00e1s by name, and at Kheri in honour of the R\u00e1ml\u00edla. The first is attended by about 150,000 people, the two latter by about 15,000 each. None of the temples are of any architectural interest, nor is it supposed\nthat any are of much antiquity. The only image of any interest is one called Dhanakdh\u00e1ri N\u00e1th at Majhg\u00e1on in Nigh\u00e1san. It is of white marble, the head dress consists of a high cone rising from a circular cap, without any ornament. It is clearly of Tartar or Thibet origin, its owner is a J\u00e1ngre Chhattri, and has connexions within the Thibet mountains. The extreme plainness of the figure and the absence of all details render it useless to theorize about an image which is interesting and unique probably in Oudh. Among sacred places may be mentioned the shrine of Deok\u00e1li in Kheri, Balmiar Barkh\u00e1r in Muhamdi, and a number of shrines in Haidarabad.\n\nThe Mandwa festival.\u2014The fair at Mandwa or Marwa in Dhaurahra is of recent origin. The pilgrims number 15,000, and assemble round the tomb of their spiritual leader a Sun\u00e1r, Munna D\u00e1s, who died about sixty years ago. Among their customs are to salaam with both hands, to abstain from flesh meat, to worship an unlighted lamp. Recently the river Chauka diverged from its ancient course and cut a new one to the south. In its destroying progress it reached the temple and had cut away a brick or two when the prayers of the attendant priest are said to have averted further damage. The river certainly changed its channel, and the temple is now high and dry. A shrine in honour of Tulshi D\u00e1s, the author of the Bh\u00e1kha R\u00e1m\u00e1yana at Dhaurahra, is of more interest. He resided here for fifteen years, and is said to have cursed the Bisens; hence their loss of all power in the district.\n\nThe worship of Mah\u00e1deo.\u2014The worship of Mah\u00e1deo at Gola calls for more extended notice. I found it very difficult on the spot to get any exact details, the priests were unwilling to make any admission which would tell against the antiquity of their shrine. My own impression is that up till the time of Alamgir the shrine was simply a Buddhist ruin, venerated by the neighbours as the superstitious Hindu does venerate anything old and mysterious. There is a tradition that Alamgir endeavoured when visiting the place to drag out of the earth the great stone pillar which represents Mah\u00e1deo; that the elephants harnessed to chains could not move it, although excavations had been made all round, and when the emperor approached to discover the cause, tongues of flame darted from the bottom of the pillar towards him. The dismayed monarch is said to have retired, and endowed the shrine with extensive rent-free lands. It is probable that some lieutenant of the emperor's was terrified into abandoning his design of digging for gold beneath the foundations of the pillar by some easily contrived stratagem as above related. It is not likely that any endowment was given; there is no trace of such in the records, and if there had been the buildings would have been more extensive and splendid than they are. Further, the god's power was apparently limited to harmless pyrotechnics; for one of the circumcised, with his Jeddart axe, struck the top of the pillar, and sliced off a huge fragment, leaving the divinity a most unsightly and decayed looking object: we are not told that this sacrilege was punished in any way.\n\nThe monastery was formerly in the hands of the Joshis, but is now, and has been for at any rate eleven generations, managed by the\nGosh\u00e1ins. They are celibates, theoretically at any rate, and adopt disciples of all castes; they bury their dead in a sitting posture, and choose their mahant (high priest) by popular election. The present chief of the community is a Chhattri. There are only ten tombs of previous mahants, from which it is obvious that the society cannot have been above 200 years old; for even if a Musalman iconoclast had levelled the ancient tombs they would have been re-erected at once by the disciples to whom they were familiar and venerable. There are a number of minor shrines, but the most sacred place is a Shiw\u00e1la of ordinary construction about ten feet square; the god is simply the shaft of a round pillar, most likely one of them so common round Buddhist stupas.*\n\nThe shrines and tombs are all of the same construction, a square pediment, generally an octagonal shaft and a circular roof; they are simply enlarged copies of the Buddhist relic basket, and Buddhist bas-reliefs still appearing in recesses of the walls sufficiently proves the origin of the worship. In the neighbourhood several Buddhist images of the purest type have been dug up, they are of baked clay.\n\nThe temple is supposed to be only the omphalos, or holy of holies, the central spot of a large area of sacred ground. There are four gates on the borders of this holy land, supposed to be at equal distances, twelve kos or eighteen miles from the centre. There are some in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to the west on the Gumti, Gadai N\u00e1th in village Sh\u00e1hpur, pargana Bh\u00far to the north, Deokali N\u00e1th near Kheri to the east, Barkh\u00e1r in pargana Muhamdi to the south, or rather south-west. Through these four darw\u00e1zas or wickets all wealthy persons are compelled to pass before approaching the shrine. They are not at opposite points of the compass, and it appears probable that the priests selected places already famous locally, and inaugurated a connexion between them and the temple of Mah\u00e1deo, conciliating local feelings, mutually exalting and supporting each other. Of course it would be a double attraction to the pious, a source of double profit to the priest, if one journey would carry the pilgrim to two sacred places, each of general and special sanctity, but both unitedly contributing to the welfare of the pilgrim's body and soul, each levying contributions on his gratitude. It was the same system of reconciling Hinduism with local superstitions, and adding to the instruments of drawing upon the coffers of sinners, which we find in the avat\u00e1rs of Vishnu.\n\nThere is also as at Benares and other shrines in India, Ireland, and other superstitious countries, a kind of sacra via\u2014a circuit round the shrine at a distance of two kos or three miles from it. This will be eighteen miles, and should be performed on foot by minor sinners, but by measuring successive lengths of the body, fair crown-and-toe progress, if the crime is of great magnitude. Some say that this circuit is a relic of sun-worship, and in imitation of the apparent course of that luminary. This has also four shrines, like the satellites of the great central star, Badar Kund to the east, Pan\u00e1ha to the north (a little shrine buried in the sal forest), Kirnagar to the south (also in the jungle), and Main Kund in Ahmadnagar to the west.\n\n* Ferguson's Architecture, Volume II, Ceylon.\nThat this circuit is also a later novelty, due to absorption and assimilation of minor local cults, is proved by the fact that the image of Mah\u00e1deo at this last mentioned place was only discovered about forty years ago by the zamindar to whom its presence beneath the earth was revealed in a dream. In other words the priest thought there were not enough toll-gates and erected another series, taking advantage of certain local sacella. The devices of this society have been crowned with success, the fame and sanctity of the temple of Gola Gokarn\u00e1n\u00e1th have spread far and wide, and 150,000 people are supposed to have assembled at the last festival. No doubt the cause of this may be traced to the fact that the place was always reckoned a sacred one, and the devotional feelings of the people had always turned to it. At first probably they worshiped the sun here, then Gautama Buddha, now Mah\u00e1deo. Deok\u00e1li, the western gate, is still noted for its tank where the sun-worshippers assemble even now.\n\nThat the Gosha\u00edns, when they introduced the worship of Mah\u00e1deo, grafted it on Buddha worship is quite clear. Like the Buddhist monks they chose the edge of a great forest into which the anchorites might retire during the cold weather; they adopted the yellow garb, the celibacy of the religious orders; they called their priests samads in imitation of the Buddhists; and here, adopting the vital principles of Buddhism, they overturned the caste hierarchy, the levitical system which confined the priesthood to one tribe, and they allowed numbers of all castes to adopt the sacerdotal profession.\n\nThe worship of Mah\u00e1deo in Kheri, far from being a repulsive and sensual phallic cult, is a graft from Buddhism, in which little has been changed except the symbol of adoration. The tendency to abandon the worship of Vishnu, and Bhaw\u00e1ni, Ganesh, and the skull-decked Shiva, for a simple pillar may be owing to a greater yearning after monotheism, may be derived from the Buddhist adoration of pillars, but is probably mainly a revulsion from the worship of deified human beings, and of more or less monstrous demons. At any rate it is a purer and more spiritual faith than any other now prevalent in Oudh. Such will be the testimony of those who have been present at what are called its orgies, but which to the careful observer will appear to be nothing but the exuberance of devotion in an excitable people. Those who discover a necessary connexion between this cult and phallic worship are fond of pointing to the popular admission that it is a lingam which is adored. In the first place one may mix with the crowd of adorers for hours and days without ever hearing the word ling, while Mah\u00e1deo is on the lips of every pilgrim as he dips in the sacred tank or counts his beads. Further, the phallic meaning of ling is only a derivative one; the only proper Sanskrit meaning of ling is sacred place. In the Dekkan and in the east of India where phallic worship is really a prevalent almost an exclusive cult, the general term has been applied to and appropriated by the species, but there is nothing but mere assumption to show that this has taken place in Oudh.\n\nI have no exact statistics of the numbers of temples, these shrines are more the token of wealth than of religious feeling. The Musalmans are\nnearly all Sunnis. Most of them are converted Hindus, they are not very enthusiastic for their new faith; except in the town of Kheri, there is not even a decent place of worship for them.\n\nThe castes of Kheri.\u2014There is nothing of special interest in the caste distribution. The Brahmans are 60,512, or 9 per cent. of the Hindus the Chhattirs only 26,150, or less than 4 per cent.; the most numerous caste is that of the Cham\u00e1rs, who number 83,984, and next to them are the Ah\u00edrs 69,383, Kurmis 67,113, Mur\u00e1os 38,480, Kis\u00e1ns 5,526. The only remarkable feature presented by the population tables is the comparative scarcity of the higher castes\u2014Brahmans, Chhattirs, K\u00e1yaths, and Vaishyas. They number only 104,894, or 15 per cent. of the Hindus; in the whole province they amount to 2,480,414, or almost 25 per cent. The reason of this is not far to seek. The low castes are the first, in all instances, to occupy the wilderness and redeem it from nature, and much of the Kheri district has but very recently been brought under cultivation. There was little to invite the Chhattri or Brahman. There are very few temples, and none of ancient repute, consequently the priestly class is not numerous. Wealth has not yet accumulated in the district, therefore no military class was wanted to defend it. Population was so thin that disputes about boundaries, that fertile source of internal warfare, were comparatively rare, and but few professional soldiers were required. The district, too, was so distant from any seat of Government that there could be little interference with the great landholders, who found it more profitable in many cases to have low caste industrious tenants than the prouder Arians. The proportion of Aborigines is large. P\u00e1s\u00eds, Ah\u00edrs, and Cham\u00e1rs have increased and multiplied for thousands of years; Chhattirs and other Arians only entered the district in any numbers within a recent period, and increased slowly; because neither the food nor climate suited their more highly-strung organizations.\n\nAll the towns now existing are of recent foundation. Kheri was founded in the 16th century, Muhamdi and Aurangabad in the 17th. Of their origin one common tale is told. The Musalman or Chhatri came through the woods and marshes (the country then lying much lower than now), and seized upon the slight hills or hummocks where some P\u00e1si or Ahir patriarch ruled over a few mud huts. The rightful owner fled deeper into the forest, and the intruder built a block house or a brick fort to guard against his vengeance.\n\nThere are only 4,049 Shekhs and Sayyads in Kheri; these Musalmans not caring to reside in the wilderness; there are 15,590 Path\u00e1ns, 9,599 Jul\u00e1has or weavers, and 7,065 Ghosis. There are 4,031 J\u00e1ts, of whom there are only 10,800 in the province. Kheri is also the headquarters of the Chhip\u00eds or cotton-printers\u2014a caste largely found in parganas Kheri and Srinagar; there are 3,841 out of 8,354 in the entire province. There are 127 Brijb\u00e1sis out of 319 in the province. This is a nomad caste which is found in Atwa Piparia and Muhamdi, living during the winter in mat tents. There are 4,943 Gosh\u00e1ins. The industrial castes on the whole prevail in this district, and so far the elements of prosperity abound. The detailed list of the castes and there occupations is as follows:\u2014\n**Detail of castes with the numbers each admits of in Kheri district.**\n\n| Caste                  | Profession                        | Their number |\n|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Higher castes of Muslims.** |                                   |              |\n| Sayyad                 | Landed Proprietor, pensioner      | 1,259        |\n| Shekh, Miki, Koreshi   | Cultivator                        | 3,790        |\n| Path\u00e1n, Ruhela         | Ditto                             | 15,590       |\n| Mughal                 | Ditto                             | 1,064        |\n| **Lower castes of Muslims.** |                                   |              |\n| Dhunia                 | Cotton-cleaner or Comber           | 8,999        |\n| Darzi                  | Tailor                            | 3,350        |\n| Ghou                   | Milkman                           | 7,065        |\n| Jajh\u00e1, R\u00e1chband, Kinchiband | Weaver, maker of weaver's bruihans, and loom-maker. | 9,899 |\n| Kunjra                 | Greengrocer                       | 2,271        |\n| Manth\u00e1r                | Glass bangle-maker,                | 2,069        |\n| Kasai                  | Butcher                           | 1,004        |\n| Seinagar               | Metal burnisher or sharpener      | 1,980        |\n| Other Musalmans        |                                   | 14,650       |\n| **Higher castes of Hindus.** |                                   |              |\n| Brahman                | Principally cultivator, Ditto     | 69,512       |\n| J\u00e1t                    | Cultivator servants, and landed proprietors. | 4,931 |\n| Chhattiri              | Clerks and accountants            | 26,150       |\n| K\u00e1yath                 | Tradeamen                         | 7,248        |\n| Vaishya                |                                   | 11,670       |\n| **Lower castes of Hindus.** |                                   |              |\n| Ahir                   | Cowherd                           | 69,383       |\n| Bhunjwa                | Grain-parcher                     | 9,321        |\n| B\u00far                      | Butcher                           | 2,741        |\n| Bhash\u00ed                 | Carpenter                         | 6,761        |\n| Bhang\u00ed                 | Sweeper                           | 6,735        |\n| Cham\u00e1r                 | Tanner, shoemaker, labourer       | 83,984       |\n| Chhipi                 | Cloth stamper and dyer            | 3,848        |\n| Dhobi                  | Washerman                         | 11,559       |\n\n| (Lower castes of Hindus\u2014cont.) | Profession                        | Their number |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|\n| Dhanuk, Bansphor, Basket-maker, worker in bamboo;

Some of the j\u00e1ts are really separate races and nations, each of which had apparently a country and polity of its own prior to its entry into India, or its admission into the Hindu system. These have been conquered, and have gradually spread to a certain extent among the other states of India, diffusing themselves gradually, becoming as a rule of course more and more sparse as they wandered farther from the original centre. Thus the Rajputs, who form 40 per cent. of the population in parts of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, become fewer and fewer towards the east till in Dacca and Calcutta they are less numerous than the Europeans. Others of the j\u00e1ts are of one common blood and stock, which has become severed\nand divided by the exercise of separate trades, each of which, according to the Hindu system, must be followed exclusively by the children of those who from generation to generation have practised it. The tendency to make trades-unions into permanent family preserves with peculiar customs and rites always existed in the east, and has been regularly organized by Hinduism. On this latter class, however, we must remark that there are in several instances two or more castes following the same profession. The Kah\u00e1r and the M\u00e1njh\u00ed are both fishermen. The Kurmi, the K\u00e1chhi, the Lodh, the Mur\u00e1o, the G\u00fajar, are all cultivators.\n\nBut the complication generally arises from the action upon each other of the two caste factors, the ethnic or national and the trade-union. In Oudh several different kingdoms, which had existed separately for many hundred years during Buddhist times, were crushed together by the pressure of Moslem empire. In this the Hindu polity was more or less elaborate or wanting; civilization, the division of labour and trades-unions, were in full force in one and absent in others.\n\nThe P\u00e1s\u00eds, for instance, were a race who had no trades-unions; every man was a hunter, a shepherd, and a cultivator. When the Hindu system enveloped them in its folds, these three trades were already occupied by Kis\u00e1ns, Gw\u00e1l\u00e1s, and Bahel\u00edas respectively. The P\u00e1s\u00ed found that he could not compete with professionals, and he gradually retired betaking himself to cultivation, combined with the task of protecting the crops from wild beasts and thieves. It was a system of union between different races, of severance between different trades, followed by natural selection of the fittest, through further combination or division.\n\nThus the Ah\u00edrs and the Bhars, the seats of whose nationality were in or near Oudh, had attained it is probable higher civilization, and a certain division of labour unknown among the P\u00e1s\u00eds. Each different kingdom had its cultivating class, its shepherd class; in the process of time each had acquired a distinct name in its own dialect; foreign conquest and Hinduism crushed all together, so the Gararia of one nation, the Gw\u00e1lbans of another, continued to exercise wherever they could their trade of herdsman. Similarly the G\u00fajar, the Kis\u00e1n, the Kurmi, the Lodh, the cultivating classes of different nations, all intermingled and pursued their common toil.\n\nIt is remarkable that the professions which belong to a higher state of civilization, those of the jewellers, oil-pressers, grain-parchers, washerman, carpenters, blacksmiths, have not each a double or treble set of followers among modern Hindus, and this would show that they did not exist as separate trades in the little rude kingdoms, which were brought under the Hindu system, or else that the trade feeling in these more skilled and technical arts was so strong as to overcome national feeling and combine in one the followers of each trade.*\n\n* There is abundant evidence that in different nations of Hindustan, in which the Hindu system had been introduced, the different trades were called by different names derived from the vernaculars of the country. The distiller in the north is called Kalw\u00e1r, in the south Kal\u00e1l, although these may be modifications of the same words. The low caste weaver is named Kori in Oudh, but Par\u00eda in the Central Provinces, Panka in other places; the curious double combination of palanquin bearing and fishing is followed by the Kah\u00e1r in the north and the Dhimm\u00e1r in the south.\nTradition, geographical distribution, and internal divisions are the means of determining whether each j\u00e1t is a separate ethnic unit or merely a trade-union, an offshoot from the one parent stem. Tradition need not be dwelt upon; it has considerable value, as will appear in each instance. Geographical distribution is all important, and the P\u00e1s\u00ed is perhaps the best instance.\n\nThe P\u00e1s\u00eds.\u2014This race is confined to the province of Oudh, the division of Benares and Allahabad, and the district of Sh\u00e1hjahanpur. Their own-traditions are to the effect that Sandfla, Dhaurahra, Mitauli, R\u00e1mkots in the district of Kheri, Hardoi, and Unao were all seats of their kings and power. Further, they do yet follow all such occupations as are absolutely necessary for the existence of a pastoral and agricultural race in a low state of civilization, and they have no divisions among themselves. The same remark may be made of the Bhars. They are a distinct nation whose capitals were in eastern Oudh, Allahabad, and Mirzapur; they are found there now and nowhere else.* On the other hand, the trades-union castes are found in almost equal proportion over all Northern India; the barber, the carpenter, the blacksmith, and the distiller are found everywhere, and in almost the same proportion everywhere.\n\nThe Ah\u00edrs.\u2014Now to take a doubtful case that of the Ah\u00edrs: they are pretty evenly distributed over Oudh and the North-West Provinces; but are almost entirely wanting in the Punjab, being about one in one hundred and fifty. Their traditions point to separate nationalities; they say that they ruled in Gujr\u00e1t and in Bair\u00e1t Khera in Oudh, but were turned out of the Chhattiri brotherhood because they married their brothers' widows. The Ah\u00edrs, a shepherd race, are mentioned in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata and by Ptolemy, as also their country Abhir. Krishna was an Ah\u00edr and one of the three divisions of the race; Nandbans, Yadubans, and Gw\u00e1l-bans was no doubt called from his father\u2020 Nand: these races do not intermarry. The so called Ah\u00edrs of Oudh, when questioned, always call themselves Gw\u00e1la or Gw\u00e1lbans, and it seems probable that they are the trade-union shepherds of the Arian kingdoms, and the other two classes are the remains of the genuine Ah\u00edr nation.\n\nBut this is only speculation. What is clear is that there is an Ah\u00edr race, most probably Scythian as evidenced by their name of Yadubans, by their pastoral habits, and their marriage customs. Sometimes they claim to be Chhattiris, others allege they are Vaisyas or Sudras; in reality the fourfold division was becoming obsolete, if it ever existed before they mingled with the great Hindu family, and their place like that of the K\u00e1yaths, J\u00e9ts, G\u00fajars, Bhars, Khattris, and others was never determined. They are not found at all in Berar, and this, while it determines their separate national existence to have been further north, throws doubt upon the story that As\u00edrgarh was their capital.\n\nIf speculation were to take a bolder flight, it would simply identify the Ah\u00edrs with the Yadubans race which ruled in Dw\u00e1rka and the Concan,\u2021\n\n* A curious fact is that wherever the Bhar is found the G\u00fajar is wanting. Does this denote a separation of the old or Bhar G\u00fajars?\n\u2020 Memoir in Bijnour Caste North-Western Provinces Census Report.\n\u2021 Journal R. A. S., Vol. V., page 180.\nand with the shepherd kings of Naip\u00e1l. In the first place it is clear that the Yadubans were not reckoned Chhatris. They style themselves of the race of Yadu simply; their primitive deity was Vishnu in the \"Viraha\" or boar avatar; they are admitted to have been Scythians, and they at one time ruled in Naip\u00e1l, Kanauj, Dw\u00e1rka, in fact over nearly all Northern India. There are no Yadubans Chhattris now in existence. What has become of them? On the other hand, we find a Yadubans race who are called by their Sanskrit speaking neighbours milkherds (Ah\u00edrs) in allusion to their pastoral life, who allege that they too were Rajputs (not Chhattris), who were not admitted into the brotherhood of the Arian Chhattris, because they married their brothers' wives; in other words, I would infer they were Scythians. The race has spread over all Northern India. In the Punjab they have been converted to the Musalman faith, are called Rangars, and are alleged to be Musalman Rajputs; in other words, descendants of the Yadubans kings.\n\nKurmis.\u2014The Kurmis are again a dubious race, are not found in the Punjab or in the Meerut Division; their centre is Behar and the Central Provinces, where they form with the M\u00e1l\u00eds half of the Hindu population. They are very numerous in the Deccan; they spread north, and in Oudh they are about a fifteenth; in the North-West Provinces they dwindle to a thirtieth. This points to their being a separate race. They worship Maroti Mah\u00e1deo, Bhaw\u00e1ni, Khandoha, Vithoba. On the other hand, their own tradition and all linguistic evidence point to their being the agricultural or servile class of the Hindu community as defined by Manu. They are the cultivators of India, \"par excellence,\" although it certainly is not consistent with the above identification that the Kurmis should be most numerous in Berar and less so in the provinces of the Antar-bed, where the Hindu polity was first established and flourished. There are two great Kurmi colonies in Kh\u00e9ri,\u2014one in Haidarabad and Paila in which they settled they say many hundreds of years ago as colonists from Kanauj, the other in Dhaurahra, whither R\u00e1ja Jodh Singh and Nawab Asif-ud-daula are said to have brought them from Tambaur in Sitapur.\n\nTh\u00e1rus.\u2014The Th\u00e1rus, who number 1,010, may be referred to here. They are said to be Aborigines, but this is very doubtful; and they say themselves that they came from Chittor when it was sacked by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji* about 1305 A.D.\u2020 They stayed south of Agra for some time, and then near Dholpur, where there exists an old city called Th\u00e1ru, whose stone ruins attest its magnificence. They are divided into two clans,\u2014the Malwaria, so called from Malw\u00e1ra, a province in the Tar\u00e1i lying east of Kanchanpur, and the B\u00e1na Bat\u00far, but besides these there are several bastard branches. The Th\u00e1rus eat meat, fish, and are very fond of spirits. They are of a very practical turn of mind, and utilize the spirits of their dead to keep the wild animals from their crops, thereby saving those still alive from night-watching. They marry within their own class, but there must be no known blood connexion between the parties. They have no betrothals and no Brahmins; they will on no account take service as soldiers; they\n\n---\n\n* Prinsep's Tables, page 256\u2014310. Carney's Cantes of Oudh, page 9.\n\u2020 See also Berar Gazetteer page 161.\nare a cowardly race, and it is a standing reproach to them that they will not attempt to revenge or to resent insults or even criminal force offered to their women, who are remarkable for industry, cleanliness, and chastity. Their features are generally Arian, but individuals have a marked Mongolian type. They worship pieces of wood erected in little mounds opposite their doors. They paint their dead with vermilion and saffron, and then bury the corpse with its glaring red and yellow.\n\nThe Chhattris, many different nations of Asia, beyond the Hindu Kush, undoubtedly contributed to form the Chhattri caste. Different races, all professing arms, united into one 'jat'; caste being in this instance a mere trade-union organized by Manu, hallowed by religion, and solidified by the lapse of ages. They retained however traces of their origin. It is clear that the Sombansi, Surajbansi, Drighbansi, for instance, are of the Arian race, both from their traditions, their names, and their language. Hastinapur, Bilgram, Kanauj, Srinagar, Sravasti, are town names derived from Arian roots; Bareli, Lahore, Peshawar, Chanderi, Chittor, Indor, Nagor, Alor, Alwar, K\u00e1kori, Sandila, Oel, on the other hand, are ancient towns in Oudh or elsewhere, whose names are taken from Turanian languages. This is evident from the termination; *w\u00e1ra is the ordinary word for a village among the Aboriginal races of Southern India, whose Turanian origin is admitted. The Mongols east of the Oxus still call a village Aul or Oram.\u2020 Further, a large number of the towns in Hungary, south of the Carpathian mountains, which were founded by a Magyar or Turanian race, still end in the same termination Ori or Oli.\u2021 The same urban names are found in Oudh. In Kheri, for instance, the oldest towns of note are Bhurwara and Kotw\u00e1ra, the early seats of the Ahban Chhattris, who are alleged to have settled there two centuries before our era, and their great antiquity is proved by the ancient coins picked up on their sites. The other ancient towns and villages in Kheri, whose origin is lost in obscurity, are Mitauli, Dhaurahra, Ajhera, Barw\u00e1r, Tikur Bas\u00e1ra, M\u00e1mri, Pareli, K\u00e1f\u00e1ra, Matera, Tirkauli, Kaimhra, Oel, Nardol, Indarwara. We learn from Hunter's Non-Arian Dictionary that the synonyms for village are as follows:\n\n| Bafk | Turkish, aoghli. |\n|------|------------------|\n| Irzi | Magyar, talu.    |\n| Uri  | Tamil, ur, equal to w\u00e1r. |\n| Telugu, aru. |\n| Toda, ur. |\n\nThe connexion between these roots and the terminations abovementioned is clear.\n\nIt would appear that branches of all these different races now exist, or have formerly established themselves in Oudh, passing into or through it from Upper Asia; the names of their towns, the only striking object in a country void of lakes and mountains, survive as evidence of their origin. Rivers might be re-named by a new-coming race because they are objects of adoration, but conquerors in the position of the early Arians would take shelter contentedly in the towns; they would re-name any which they had to rebuild, but in other cases they would learn and adopt the names from the survivors of the defeated races; so it comes that now in Oudh Arian Sombansis and Brahmins dwell in Turanian villages, and names ending\n\n---\n\n* Vambery's Travels, page 119.\n\u2020 Vide Society's Atlas.\n\u2021 See the South Indian synonyms for villages.\u2014Bowring's Eastern Experiences, page 258.\nin 'shahr' and 'abad,' sparsely sprinkled over the map, show the traces left by the Moslem invasion of Sayyads and Koreshis in a still later age.\n\nIt has been asserted by an authority, whose philological attainments command the highest respect, that these terminations in Indian town-names are ordinary mutations of the Sanskrit puri.* I cannot pretend to compete in philological attainments with Mr. Growse, but surely my derivation direct from the Turanian roots\u2014aul, oram, wara, ur, uri\u2014is more probable than the forced and far-fetched Sanskrit derivation from one single root supported only by the theory of a grammarian, which may or may not have been put in practice in an unlettered age. Further, if these towns do not represent the various Turanian equivalents for the Sanscrit nagar or pur, the Persian shahr or abad, the English ton\u2014where are they to be found? What traces of their nomenclature survive? The Turanians it is not denied colonized India; they were the great builders of antiquity; they held Oudh before the Arian invasion; they must have built cities; the towns whose names end as abovementioned are in every case so ancient that their origin is lost in obscurity; their antiquity corresponds with the Turanian age; no other urban traces of that age are found; they bear the district traces of Turanian origin; in fact history, tradition, and etymology are in harmony. If, again, these terminations are Sanskrit corruptions of pur; if it is possible, in the lapse of time, to elide the p and change the v into e why have not the oldest towns like Hastinapur, built two thousand years before this grammarian flourished, yielded to its seductions; and why, in the case of more modern towns, do not we find the change half effected, and a place sometimes called Madhopuri sometime Maholi? Why do not we find some trace of the change\u2014some middle place in the transition stage? If, again, the termination is Sanskrit, how does it occur in Tanjore, Travancore, Cuddalore, Cannanore, in districts where Sanskrit never has conquered, never perhaps invaded the domain of Telugu and other Turanian tongues. The very variety of the terminations leads further to the inference that they are derived from different synonyms used by branches of the great Turanian family of nations which border Hindustan from the Brahmaputra to the Sutlej. It is not consistent with the inflexible and highly developed Sanskrit that pur should metamorphose itself into a dozen Protean shapes, commencing with wara and ending with ori and oli.\n\nMr. Growse, in a communication with which he has favoured me, maintains the theory that these terminations are corruptions of pur. He remarks that Hastinapur might have been preserved from the change by its being\n\n*Yet an application of the rules of the ancient Prakrit grammarian Vararuchi, will in many cases, without any wonderful exercise of ingenuity, suffice to discover the original Sanskrit form and explain its corruption.\n\nThus Maholi is for Madhopuri; Parsoli for Parasurama-puri (Parsi being the ordinary colloquial abbreviation for Parasurama); Dham-Sinha for Dharma Sinha, Batli for Bahula-vati, and Khaira for Khadira. It would seem that the true explanation of these common endings\u2014oil, auli, auril, awar, has never before been clearly stated. They are merely corruptions of pur or pura, combined with the prior member of the compound, as explained by Vararuchi in Sutra II, 2, which directs the elision of certain consonants, including the letter l', where they are simple and non-initial; the term \"non-initial\" being expressly extended to the first letter of the latter member of a compound.\"\u2014Growse's Mathava, page 6.\nstereotyped in literature. This argument would not apply to Shiur\u00e1jpur, the ancient seat of the Gaurs, to Sitapur, Gadaipur, Bhojpur, and many other towns over which ages have passed, and the termination remains unchanged.\n\nThere is yet another interesting phase of the question. If the termination is Sanskrit, the first portion of the name would surely also often recall some well known feature of the social life or religious belief of Sanskrit-speaking races. Certainly nine-tenths of the urban names, which do now end in unchanged pur, nagar, kot, are derived from gods of the Arian Pantheon, as for instance Durg\u00e1pur, Shiipur, Bishnupur, Krishnagarh, Brahmapur, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edpur, Sitapur, Ganeshpur. Hundreds of other names similarly compounded are found in Kh\u00e9ri and all Oudh districts, but these Sanskrit names never preface the eri and oli terminations referred to; therefore we must suppose that in the age when all these towns were founded, not only was language so liquid and unstable as to allow such remarkable changes, but at that time the Sanskrit-speaking races knew nothing of its great triad, or else it would have applied them in its urban nomenclature. However late a development of the Arian theogony, it is at any rate generally supposed that Bishn and Shiu were its chief gods centuries before the colonists were in a position to build cities in the remotest corners of Hindustan. Nor, indeed, are the earlier deities of the Rig Veda, Agni, Vaya, Surya, Mitra, ever associated with these terminations. Rudra and Mitra are the only now recognizable possible components of these old formations, and even if Rudauli and Mitauli indicate the culture of those gods by their founders, it is by no means certain that these were Arian gods\u2020 at all.\n\nThe fact is that the Sanskrit language has prevailed over and been adopted by many Turanian races, who now use fashionable terminations in the nomenclature. The great Chhattiri tribes of Rajputana in every case have a city or province exhibiting these or similar terminations from evidently allied roots. The three chief tribes no doubt now come from Udaipur, Jaipur, and Jodhpur, but those provinces or towns formerly bore the name of Mewar, Amber, or Dhundhar, and M\u00e1rv\u00e1r or Mandore. In fine, we can come to no other conclusion than that towns whose names exhibit these terminations are Turanian foundations in nearly every case, otherwise we are forced to several impossible theories,\u2014one that none of the Turanians, the great builders of antiquity, and to this date the majority of the Indian people built any towns, or that if they did, their names have been entirely lost; another, that the Sanskrit termination pur has exhibited the wildest vagaries changing into oli, eri, wdri, introducing unlimited novelties and always eliminating the p; another, that for some reason in former times the Arians never built towns in honour of eponymous deities as they have universally done as far as history extends. From these and many other difficulties we escape by holding that these terminations are identical in origin as they are in form with the al, ul, ur, wdra, uli, which we find to this day in common use among Turanian races, meaning a town, village, dwelling place. Similarly Mr. Lyall in the Berar Gazetteer points out that the original name of\n\n---\n\n* Muir's Sanscrit Texts, Vol. IV., page 382.\n\u2020 See Muir's Sanscrit Texts, Vol. IV., pages 57, 71.\nDawalg\u0101on was Dewalw\u0101ri, from w\u0101ri, a hamlet, and that of Dewalgh\u0101t, Deodi. All over India the same terminology is found, and the same etymology asserted. Bangalore is Bengaluru, the city of beans, from bengalu, a bean.\n\n\"But,\" says the writer referred to, \"if this word ur or uri was never current in the ordinary speech of Upper India, the founder of the villages quoted above cannot possibly have known of it.\" But castra was \"never current in the ordinary speech\" of England, yet the founders of Lancaster, Chester, and a hundred others well knew its meaning. There is other evidence besides that previously adduced showing that these terminations are not Sanskrit. In Upper India, in the very birth-place of Hinduism, we find them, and we know that they cannot have been derived from earlier Sanskrit names ending in pur, because we know the Sanskrit names, and they did not end in pur. Of the twelve oldest towns in the sacred land round Thanesur on the bank of the Saraswati which was the cradle of Hinduism, six have these terminations. One is Khair\u00e1r, also called Ajainagar, another Pinjor called Adnitanagar, in the Vana Parva of the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata. Here it is evident that there can have been no elision of medial p or other metamorphosis, and the termination must have the independent Turanian origin suggested.\n\nIt is true the word uri or w\u0101ra is not now generally used in Northern India except perhaps in its compound gauri, a grazing or cattle village; but that only shows that the race has either disappeared or adopted another language, just as the Celts now talk English and have abandoned the prefix Bally in their urban nomenclature.\n\nThe question is of no importance because it is admitted that many of the races still existent in Upper India are of Turanian origin, and unquestionably used this Turanian word for town, which is uri or w\u0101ra. The only position which admits of argument is that their towns and names have disappeared, and other towns founded and named by Arians have taken their place. The Bhars were not Hindus (vide the anecdote under article Bareli Antiquities), and almost all their towns, including their capitals, Bareli, Rudauli, whose foundation is fairly ascertained, exhibit these Turanian affixes. The P\u00e1s\u00eds' towns give similar results; their old capitals are Sandfla, Mitauli, Dhaurahra, sufficiently evidencing their Dravidian or Turanian connexion, which is also affirmed by tradition:\n\nNothing can be clearer than that, to use Mr. Bowring's words:\u2014\"On removing the thick crest of the Sanskrit element which adheres to the common vernaculars of Northern India, the substratum bears an affinity to the languages of the south\u2014an affinity not very close, indeed, and greatly warped by the action of centuries, but still pointing to an early connexion between them.\"\n\nThe history of the Agnikul or fire-born Chhattri clans, as the Chauh\u00e1n, the Ch\u00e1war, points to a non-Arian colonization,\u2020 and if not Arian\n\n* Page 165, 167, 165.\n\u2020 Bowring's Eastern Reminiscences, page 5.\n\u2021 Bowring's Eastern Experiences, page 32.\nthen Turanian. The Chawars colonized Kheri under the name of Ahben; their chief towns were Maholi, Bhurwara, and Kotwara, not a pur amongst their foundations. Similarly a Chauhan colony, the Jangres, established the towns of Bhirra and Dhaurahra, another Chauhan branch, the Janwars, founded the towns of Oel, Kaimahra.*\n\nIn the pamphlet above referred to there occur a few points which may be cursorily referred to. Mr. Growse declares that the terminations oli, auti, aurii, aura, auta, \"were in earlier times as common a local affix as puri in modern times,\" and must represent some term of equally general and equally familiar signification. He derives them all from pur.\n\nBut he says nothing about eli, eri, ela, era, which are, judging from the maps I possess, just as common in Mathura; while very many of the old towns in Oudh so end; Sandila, Bareli, Dhaurahra, Kheri are instances. Nor can it be alleged that this is the final ra of the genitive transmitted in various ways, for we find the affix itself separate, both in Mathura and Oudh, aira as the name for old villages, whose origin is unknown, and from which many others have been settled.\n\nIf these terminations cannot be derived from the Sanskrit, and if Turanian tribes, which must have passed through Northern India from Upper Asia to the Dekkan, do use the precise word for town, which is found as an affix in innumerable Oudh towns, surely the conclusion is irresistible that the affix was thence derived. And if we find the Turanian foundation of those ending eri admitted, then the argument is strengthened, if it requires any strengthening, for the Turanian origin of those ending in ward, udi, &c., which are equally common, and belong to the same age; these terminations being the equivalents for town among other and neighbouring Turanian races which have it is known colonized India. If we admit that one Turanian race founded towns and applied its own nomenclature, why should not others who had similar opportunities not have left similar traces.\n\nThe obvious conclusion from all the facts as known is that the Arian race in India formed originally but a small portion of the population. It was a nation of warriors not of town builders. For many generations their progress was slow, during which time the Turanians occupied all the best sites and built all the old towns, worshipping Vithoba, Bhawani, and the other Aboriginal deities, naming their towns from their own language. None of the sacred towns in India end in the Sanskrit affixes not Gya, or Benares, Ajodhya, Prag, Cuttack, Hardwar, Bithur, Gola, Ellora: none of the great capitals of former times Chittore, Ajmere, Dewal, Alore, Kanauj, Mahoba, Anhalwara, Amber.\n\nGradually the Sanskrit language, the caste system, Hinduism in fact extended their influence and were adopted by all; then Chittore gave place to Udaipur, Amber to Jaipur, Marwar to Jodhpur. It is not that names ending in pur have gradually by eliding all the consonants and changing all the vowels come to eri, eli, and ol but towns bearing these names always bore them and when there has been any change, it is just\n\n* Vide Ferguson's History of Architecture, Vol. II., Tod's Rajasthan, Vol. I., the Preface.\nthe reverse; new towns with the new favourite and fashionable Sanskrit terminations of pur and nagar have been founded, or the names have been altered. There are innumerable villages in Oudh in which the old aboriginal name ending in eri has survived to this day, with a rival Sanskrit, one ending in nagar or pur. The most noted one perhaps is R\u00e1mnagar, the seat of one of the great religious fairs, whose original name is Dhameri. True, there are even fewer old towns with Sanskrit terminations than one would expect from the known strength of the Arian race, but they were not builders; they came as conquerors, occupying the towns which had been founded by the great builders, the Turanians. Even now comparatively few towns are founded by Arians, and the spread of Sanskrit terminology is due to the adoption of the Sanskrit language by the Turanians. Even now the foundations of villages in the forest are laid by Thar\u00fas, Lodhs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Ah\u00edrs, and others of non-Arian origin, or at least of dubious derivation. Chhattris and Brahmins become fewer and fewer as we approach the wilderness; if we enter the forest they disappear entirely. They, in fact, now as formerly leave the foundations of villages to Turanians. When large clearings have been effected they step in and take possession just as a thousand years ago, they ousted the Bhars and Thathers.\n\nSurely the evidence, confirmed as it is by tradition and history, will suffice to prove the interesting fact that the Chhattris are a compound race. The social forces then which in Hindustan have thus amalgamated races so widely apart are not to be impeached as having done nothing but divide the human race and suppress human sympathies in some doubtful cases. In one instance at any rate, different races united into one caste, extending the bounds of fraternity at a time when other castes with diverse professions, and often opposing interests, were being formed out of one nation. One race was amalgamated with others, another was split up into several new divisions; ethnical distinctions were in fact being superseded by the new associations which growing civilization produced to supply its multiplying wants and luxuries. Several races united to form the Chhattris, and the profession of arms with its absorbing passions welded them into one race. Sometimes, however, the national feeling was stronger than the professional, particularly this was the case in grazing and agricultural communities, when the occupation was not one requiring skill, or devotion, or above all, association.\n\nThe influence of the Chhattris.\u2014Here as elsewhere in Oudh this is the most important, although far from the most numerous caste; it possesses more than half the villages as may be seen to the following list:\n\n| Caste          | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Musalman       | 841    |\n| Brahman        | 88     |\n| Chhatri        | 851    |\n| K\u00e9yath         | 17     |\n| Khattri        | 8      |\n| Goh\u00e1in         | 7      |\n| N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi     | 14     |\n| Pal\u00e1gi         | 3      |\n| Ah\u00edr           | 13     |\n| Kurmi          | 39     |\n| Kalw\u00e1r, M\u00edstri, Loh\u00e1r | 8   |\n| Vainhyas, Bas\u00edan | 7     |\n| K\u00e1chhi, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Mur\u00e1, Lodh, Kis\u00e1n, J\u00e1t, Cham\u00e1r, Mori | 13 |\n| Europeans      | 111    |\n| Government     | 84     |\n| Total          | 1,689  |\nFurther, about half of those held by Musalmans belong to Chhattirs who have been converted to that faith. The estates of Kotw\u00e1ra\u2014Raipur, Gola, B\u00e1nsi, \u00c1gar Buzurg, Muhamdi, Kukra, Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra\u2014are of this nature; of the rest the greater portion only came into the hands of Musalmans during the last twenty years\u2014Atwa Piparia in 1855, Kasta about 1864. The two great rajas of Mitauli and Dhaurahra, an Ahban and a J\u00e1ngre Chhattri, holding above 500 villages, lost their estates for rebellion and complicity in murder. These have been given largely to Europeans; the estates of Kasta and Kukra Mail\u00e1ni were thus granted to Europeans who have since, however, sold them or lost them in litigation. The Brahman landed proprietors are generally grantees of copyholds from the rajas of Muhamdi or Mitauli. It will thus appear that shortly before annexation nearly the whole of Kheri\u2014about four-fifths\u2014was held by Chhattirs, and about three-fifths by large feudal proprietors. The nature of this latter tenure will be described hereafter, at present the point is the ascendancy of the Chhattri. This I have elsewhere discussed and may quote the passage.\n\nCause of their ascendancy.\u2014It seems hardly to be the case that the Chhattirs more than any other caste deferred to a common head, and therefore by union among themselves secured pre-eminence. Rather it should be considered that the feeling of all the inhabitants in each district was to yield feudal service to, and in return to receive protection from the natural lord, the leader of society in the neighbourhood; and he, according to the Hindu system, must be a Chhattri. In old India every king was necessarily a soldier, and every soldier was, according to the Vedic cosmogony, a Chhattri; such a thing as a Brahman or Ah\u00edr king was an anomaly under Hindu law, and if by chance or by force any low caste rose to power, a fabulous Chhattri origin was devised for him, and his descendants admitted into the soldier brotherhood.\n\nThe Chhattri ascendancy in Oudh might be simply described as the re-establishment of local Hindu government under the native chief. There was no elaborate design or settled plan. One village had been founded in a jungle, its inhabitants were harassed by plunderers from the neighbouring estate, they thought it better to become also feoffees. Another village paid its revenue direct to the Musalman government, the collector was oppressive to the weak units, it was received by the nearest raja into the collection of villages for which he paid revenue. As estates grew by a gradual process of accretion, the motive was the anarchy and oppression of the native government, the guiding principle the ancient idea that a raja must be a Chhattri, a man of the military caste, because all rule was then based on the sword. In time, among his own people, the rural baron assumed the title of raja, but never was this title bestowed by the people of Oudh except upon a Chhattri.\n\nThe raja once established could treat as rebels and dispossess any of his subjects who showed signs of treachery or disloyalty to the little state he ruled. He had many wives and many sons, bastard and legitimate; all the waste lands were his; all lapsed or forfeited villages likewise became his. With such lands he provided for the scions of his house, and in this way much of the actual ownership of the land passed into the hands of his clan.\nNo doubt there were other ways in which taluqas were founded; these will be treated of further on. At present it is only necessary to remark that the landed predominance of the Chhattri does not seem due to the greater valour of the clan\u2014for Brahmins were as brave and more numerous,\u2014nor to the natural inclination of the clan to put themselves under able and skilled guidance, for hardly* an instance is on record of a clan uniting to elect a chief for the first time on those grounds or any other; but the phenomenon is due to the inclination of the whole people for local government, and to their willingness when pressed by an alien ruler to risk the loss of a nominal independence.\n\nThe Chhatris were the mesne lords in 87 out of 223 Oudh counties or muhals in the reign of Akbar. Afterwards they lost ground; they were depressed in the reign of Alamgir; they were crushed by Asif-uddaula and Sadat Ali. They rose again elastic and unbroken, and they now possess much about the same property and divided among the same clans as they held under Akbar. The history of words bears strong evidence to the above facts. Rajputs, Thakurs, and Chhatris have become in common Oudh parlance synonyms. The first means the son of a king, the second the lord, the master. The idea had taken root in the people's mind that every chief's son, and therefore every chief either is or becomes, by virtue of his position, a Chhatri, and that this race alone is or should be the ruling one.\n\nThe means of working out this in practice are at hand. Their sacred books in one place pronounce that rajas are of (personally) no caste, are above the rules of caste: nowhere could there be a better proof of the wonderful elasticity of Hinduism, of its being a living faith, tied down to no ancient formula from which it could not escape by a construction. Within the last three years several Indian rajas, who had no legitimate children, have brought into the Chhatri ranks sons by Musalman concubines, and, indeed, there are very few of the Chhatri nobles whose position is not due to a similar application of this artful provision. It is apparent that where, under the ancient law and practice, every local chief and lord of the soil became ipso facto a Chhatri\u2014Chhatris must soon have absorbed the entire property of the soil. In later times caste ceased to be flexible; Kayaths and Kurmis remained so even when they acquired estates, but the bent of the people towards local government by Chhatris remained as strong as ever. Any peculiarly able and well born Chhatri was seen in the course of those turbulent times to become a raja by a kind of popular election. Certain to accumulate an estate, village after village was offered to him, with the more or less willing consent of the proprietors. By a kind of common law his estate was in his criminal and civil jurisdiction as far as Hindus were concerned; it ceased to be called direct Government property (khalsa); it became a principality; and the several villages became integral parts of one property. In a very few years they became welded together, the common subjection of the proprietors of the land to the raja became confused and then identical with his proprietorship of the whole land.\n\n* There are two.\nChhattri fiefs formed under foreign oppression.\u2014The history of Kheri furnishes several striking instances of the composition, so to speak, of great Chhattri fiefs by the voluntary action of the people who were oppressed by the Government officers or others. Thus the zamindars of Kasta placed their villages in the Mitauli estate; thus the muqaddams of Dhaurahra* invited Raja Jodha Singh\u2020 to assume authority over them. The consequence was that although Pasis, Ahirs, Kurnis, Brahmans, and Lodhs, had held numerous coparcenary properties at the commencement of this century; they have gradually lapsed into the hands of the Chhattris, who thus became proprietors of nearly all Kheri a few years before annexation; the cause being the oppressive nature of the Oudh administration dealings.\n\nTerritorial division of the Chhattris.\u2014The principal subcastes of Chhattris in this district are as follows: Commencing at the south, the Janwars rule in Kheri, Srinagar, Paila, their possessions marching with those of the Gours in the adjoining district of Sitapur, and their boundary being that of the districts. The Janwars hold now a large tract of land covering about 350 square miles between the Chauka and the Jamwari in almost exclusive possession, but they have spread beyond the latter into Paila, which they hold in partnership with the Ahbans. We must here bear in mind that Kheri is divided by its rivers into belts of territory running north-west and south-east. The Janwars occupy two of these belts, the one between the Chauka and the Ul, and that lying west of it between the Ul and the Jamwari. Beyond the Jamwari commences the Ahban territory, which once covered nearly 4,000 square miles in the three districts of Hardoi, Sitapur, and Kheri; in this district it was powerful between the Jamwari and the Kathna, and spreading up crossed the Jamwari and the Ul, overlapping the Janwars to the north-west, holding Aliganj, Kukra, Paila Sikandarabad, Kasta, Haidarabad, in this district. Beyond the Kathna commences another belt likewise running north-west and south-east between the Kathna and the Gumti; this, and again a second between the Gumti and the Sukheta, constitute the principality of the Muhamdi raj, a fief formed first by Sadr Jah\u00e1n,\u2020 the Sadr Sudur of the Emperor Akbar. His dominion during the eighteenth century spread over the whole of Kheri, and in greatly diminished splendour now belongs to a converted Sombansi, whose ancestor was an agent of the rightful owner.\n\nI have thus sketched the clans and families which occupy sections of the southern half of the district. There was no wave of invasion from the west, no immigration of large clans; the Sayyad, Ahban, and Janwar families, for they are not numerous enough to be called clans, are descended from single individuals, who settled sporadically in the country, and either acquired large grants by court favour, or formed estates in the progress of years by careful management, usury, and sometimes by fraud. We must now take another cross section of the country lying north of those above described. The great fief of the Jangres commences east of the Ul, being:\n\n* See article Bahraich Sleeman's Tour in Oudh.\n\u2020 See Dhaurahra.\n\u2021 See Barwar.\nseparated by that river from the northern corner of the Ahban territory; it trends to the south-east still marching with the Ahban lordship; then crossing the Chauka, that river forming the boundary between the J\u00e1ngres and the Janw\u00e1rs, it extends to the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la and even crosses it into Bahraich, but is met in the south-east by the Raikw\u00e1rs, a corner of whose dominions comes in between the Janw\u00e1rs and the J\u00e1ngres, forming a promontory stretching from the great Raikw\u00e1r dominion of Baundi R\u00e1m-nagar. Beyond the Suheli, the ancient channel of the S\u00e1rd\u00e1, the Pah\u00e1ri S\u00farajbans Chhattris have, within the last thirty years, taken Khairigarh from the Banj\u00e1ras; this they now hold up to the Moh\u00e1n, the northern boundary of Oudh.\n\nAnnals of the Chhattri clans fabulous.\u2014None of these clans or families have any trustworthy annals; the Ahbans and S\u00farajbans claim a very long pedigree, the former of 107 generations, the latter of about 90, but none of them rank high in the scale; the Janw\u00e1rs and J\u00e1ngres both claim to be Chauh\u00e1ns who have adopted local names. The Ahbans are said to be Ch\u00e1war Chhattris who once ruled in Gujar\u00e1t. Gopi and Sopi, two brothers, are said to have come from that province shortly after the commencement of the Christian era. The former acquired the pargana of Gopamau, a descendant of the latter, who first settled in Bh\u00farv\u00e1ra, took possession of Pataunja, three miles west of Misrikh in pargana Nimkh\u00e1r. This is the reputed residence of the Dryad Abbh\u00e1wan, who is alleged to have given supernatural assistance to her favourite, the Ch\u00e1war Chief, who henceforth took the name of Ahban. At any rate, Pataunja became a local centre of secular and religious power. A tribe of Kurmis and a gotr of Tiw\u00e1ri Brahmans have called themselves after Pataunja\u2014a fact which tends to indicate that, although now a mere village, it was formerly the capital of a state possessing some independence. The after history of the Ahbans is related in Chapter V. They rose to great prosperity, how great it is impossible to state, for of all Chhattri clans they are the most mendacious, and many plans for the advancement of individuals have been foiled by this defect of theirs. Their R\u00e1ja, M\u00e1n Singh, thought that he could oppose the British army in its successful march across Oudh after the battle of Buxar in 1764. He was defeated and killed: bayoneted through the flowing pyjamas which this degenerate Chhattri thought was a suitable panoply for the battle field. They rose again and again; their chief Lone Singh took up the losing cause in 1857. He seized some British officers and ladies who claimed his protection. He was foolish enough to chain them in the market-place of his fort at Mitauli; he delivered them to the Lucknow authorities, who shot the officers and imprisoned the ladies. Lone Singh was himself transported for life for complicity in murder, and his estate forfeited in 1859. Some cadet branches of the family still survive and have considerable estates; most of them are converts to the Musalman faith.\n\nThe other Chhattri clans need not be referred to in detail here. The Janw\u00e1rs settled in Kheri pargana in the sixteenth century, having come from Rajputana. The J\u00e1ngres about the same time drove out the B\u00e1chhil Chh\u00edpi Kh\u00e1n from Fort K\u00e1mp, whose ruins are still to be seen on the bank of the Chauka. The Paharia S\u00farajbans entered the district as late as 1838 from Dhoti and Kanchanpur in Naip\u00e1l. The B\u00e1chhils, who still\nhold a few villages in Muhamdi tahsil, are of unknown antiquity. The Raikwars, whose head, the Rao of Mallapur, has a large estate in Firozabad, came from Baundi in Bahrach about the commencement of the seventeenth century. The Bisens formerly held all Dhaurahra and Srinagar, which last they only lost in 1824; they have not now a square yard of land in either pargana. The aboriginal Janwars, that is, the earlier clan as distinguished from the later settlement of Chauhans which also appropriated the name, have lost all their villages. A few families of Panwars and Sombansi possess one or two clusters of villages in Muhamdi.\n\nOf late years these castes have been extending the range of their matrimonial alliances. The Pahari Surajbans used to give their daughters to the Jangre and Ahban, now they are sent with large dowries to hill chiefs in the Punjab. The Janwar girls, if rich, are now married to the Rathers and Kachhwahas of Rajputana, formerly they sought local alliances.\n\nNumbers of the clans.\u2014None of these clans of Chhattirs are remarkable by reason of their numbers; the Jangres, Raikwars, Surajbans combined do not number above 50 adult males, although they own four parganas; the Ahbans do not reckon above the same number, while three or four Janwars, Sikhs, Khanzadas, and Englishmen divide half the district between them.\n\nAll these Chhattirs refuse to guide the plough with their own hands, but they will take a hand at irrigation or spade labour, or any other farm handiwork. Their military tastes are not pronounced; few of them were formerly in the military service of the Company; and since the death of Jodha Singh* not a single gallant or martial deed is related of any of their body. The Ahbans labour under a superstitious aversion to build houses of bricks or lime wells with them.\n\nTenures.\u2014I append tables showing the proprietary right exercised by the different castes and religious sects in Kheri, also one showing the property held by the large landowners. There are it appears four estates, each measuring above 100,000 acres in the district, but Rajas Amir Hasan Khan, Ranjit Singh, Muneshwar Bakhsh, the Raja of Kapurthala, Wazir Chand have all large estates in other districts. There are in fact nine landowners in Kheri whose estates in that or other districts average about 220 square miles each. There are twelve proprietors holding more than 20,000 acres each; their estates average 77,000 acres or 120 square miles in Kheri alone; they hold 1,435 square miles or more than half the district, and they control a population of about 400,000 in this district, and of at least a million in Oudh. The rest of the villages (656) are owned by zamindars, many of whom have two or three villages: there are 780 of these men. There are also a number of subordinate tenures, of which 873 have been decreed in the courts. The tenantry have no fixity of tenure.\n\n* See Dhaurahra.\n## List of Taluqdars.\n\n| Names of owners | Names of estates | Number of villages | Area in acres | Government farms | Caste | Remarks |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|---------|\n| 1 R\u00e1ja Musharraf Ali Khan. | Bah\u00e1dernagar | 54 | 65,907 | 29,301 | Sombansi (Musalm\u00e1n). | Revised demand not yet sanctioned.

the first form of society.\u2014It is a matter of considerable historical interest in each district of Oudh to determine whether village communities or taluqas are the original form of property and of society; it is the oriental form of the dispute between monarchy and democracy. I will exhibit the result derived from long experience of Kheri society and study of its history.\n\nAs usual in such cases both sides can point to many undoubted instances in which one or other system prevailed from the very commencement of tradition. If we examine aboriginal tribes now scattered over the country like the N\u00e1gas, Sonth\u00e1ls, and Th\u00e1rus of Kheri, we find distinct republics, property or quasi-property in land evenly divided, jurisdiction confined to the assembly of the elders, not necessarily of the caste. On the other hand, we know from the R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47 and Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata that monarchial forms of government existed from the very earliest period of Arian ascendancy three thousand years ago; and Hwen Thsang, in the 7th century A.D., only found one republic among about 160 little principalities in India.\n\nIt is not enough to say that circumstances in each case will determine what form of Government will be assumed; we want to know what are the circumstances which have induced the Hindu society of Unao, for\n\n* A Faq\u00edr has a share in these two villages.\ninstance, to form a set of republics, and that of Kheri a set of little monarchies. The answer seems to be the same if a similar question be asked touching the Anglo-Saxon race in England and in America. The first layer of a fairly civilized people over a primeval country or over one merely sprinkled with savages is sooner or later democratic; if a second layer supervene by conquest, or if subject races are introduced wherever there is no amalgamation, there must be submission, and that submission will generally end in the autocracy of one. The reason is clear. When a tribe of equally well born individuals has abundance of land and no natural enemies, internal disputes are rare, external enemies there are none and there is no reason why it should abandon any portion of its liberty. Thus in Hardoi, Unao, and Sitapur the Chhattris came in very early; the population of other castes was very sparse; there was no barbarous foe which could presume to oppose them; they divided the land. So with the Tharu communities in the Tarai forests; they were homogeneous residents in the depths of a lonely wilderness; the form of society adopted by them was republican. In eastern Oudh, on the other hand, the Kanhpurias, the Tilok Chandi Bais, the Sombansis, the Bisens, found not only organized Bhar kingdoms, with whom a doubtful war had to be waged, but a great Musalman kingdom, that of Jaunpur, which would look with jealousy on the rise of Hindu self-government. The clans had to part with a portion of their liberty in order to secure the promptness and energy necessary in times of war, and not consistent with republican institutions. So the Saxons of the Heptarchy had to select kings in order to lead them against the Britons, but the English colonists in the American wastes adopted and retained republican institutions.\n\nThe village community not a republic.\u2014But here the fact must be borne in mind, that ever since the advance of the Arians into India there never has really been a republic in the greater part of Northern India in the European sense of the word. The soldier clan, that of the Chhattris, including that of the Jats, Bhars, Gujars, &c., &c., numbers in the Punjab about one-fifth, in Rajputana about one-fourth, in the North-Western Provinces about one-fourteenth, and in Oudh less than one-twentieth of the population; yet, except where Musalmans have intruded and disturbed the natural order of things, these Chhattris, or rather a section of them, have retained in their hands practically all the landed property, and with it the authority belonging to the society: in Kheri, for instance, before annexation they had four-fifths of the country. When therefore we speak of republics, or of independent village communities, we speak of such among the Chhattris, leaving the great mass of the people entirely out of consideration; these communes are really military oligarchies, fairly answering to that of Rome in the first four centuries after the overthrow of the monarchy.\n\nCaste tempered the administration by an oligarchy.\u2014But again it must be remembered that these societies were composed of a series of castes, each of which had authority over its own members for offences committed within that caste. The province, and consequently the power of Government was then limited in the extreme; the mutual relations of the castes were regulated by custom, and infringements of these regula-\ntions were punished by the decrees of juries composed from several castes; execution of these decrees was enforced if necessary by banishment from society. In fact, Government had only to determine the foreign relations of the community, and to direct its military forces, to collect its revenue, and to parcel out its lands among the cultivators. This last was done in Kheri as in Northern India generally, not by the villagers in council met, not by the elders of the village, not by elected heads of the village, but by a particular class or individual in each village called the lord or lords, the Th\u00e1kurs, and that class in almost all cases consisted of Chhattris.\n\nA R\u00e1ja required by the Chhattri communities which had overborne numerous lower castes.\u2014When the subject classes the Sudras, or even the conquered twice-born men of other castes were numerous, there was constant danger of a rebellion; the Lodhs, Bhars, and P\u00e1s\u00eds repeatedly rose against and overwhelmed the Chhatri communities in Oudh; the interests of the property were also so complex and troublesome that they required the undivided attention of one able and experienced man; consequently in process of time property ceased to be divided among all the sons, and was given only to the ablest or the eldest. Just as the Israelites elected a king when they became the lords of numerous conquered people; so did the Chhattris of Oudh. Similarly Sher Shah in Sasseram, when asked by his brethren to divide the land, replied:\u2014\"We are not now in our native Kohist\u00e1n where each man gets his share; we are feudal lords here, and I alone, am the master.\" To paraphrase his language, when a homogeneous race inhabits a territory, it divides the land equally and forms a republic, when mixed but unamalgamated races or castes inhabit a country, one of them will generally rule, and of that one an individual member will generally assert his supremacy; and this is not so much because the interest of the society requires the tyranny of, the many to be exchanged for that of the few, for the caste system materially modifies this principle of European politics, but because according to the theory of the Hindu system, and its practice in early stages, the Hindu monarchy, the r\u00e1j in fact, is infinitely cheaper, more effective, and more conservative of just interests than a republic.\n\nThe military situation probably in most cases determined the change of the republic into the r\u00e1j when such occurred. The unfortunate thing is that a r\u00e1j looks well at first, but always deteriorates, and does not fulfil the promises of its prime, while a republic is rugged and turbulent at first, but improves with age.\n\nSo far we have been speaking of the Hindu system as it existed in Oudh and elsewhere, at a time when the Musalman supremacy was confined to an occasional receipt of tribute, when in fact there was a Hindu autonomy, the military class being the master of the land, forming a ruling militia subject to its own hereditary chiefs, society being a mixture of the clan, the feudal, and the monarchical elements. For the Chhattris the system was that of a clan, for the mass of the people a monarchy, for the r\u00e1ja a feudal relation existed towards the emperor. Through the whole mass, two ruling principles, that of caste and that of custom, pervaded all the relations of life, rendering the Government a very\nmild and moderate constitutional monarchy. The great limitation of\nthe raja's power is shown by the fact that in some\nstates there was a hereditary diwan, a civil manager, and\na hereditary military leader. Such are still found in Tra-\nvancore and Nap\u00e1l, and the germs of the system are met with in eastern\nOudh, but there is nothing of the kind in Kheri. The raja in ordinary life\nwas in no way distinguished from his subjects. He dined with his clans-\nmen at every public celebration, and the frequent pipe passed round to all\nthe brotherhood was the symbol of their kindred. His military force con-\nsisted solely of his brotherhood, and of those to whom he was related by\nmarriage; for one of the distinguishing features of the Chhattirs and\nBrahmans as opposed to all or most other castes was that they could not\nmarry in their own subdivision of the clan, but must marry into another.\nA guarantee was thus given not only that the mischievous marriages of\nrelations should be hindered, but that the ramification of kindred should\nextend over a very large and ever increasing section of the Chhattri race,\nthus uniting all the clan from the raja to the peasant in one community of blood\nand of interest. It was consequently impossible for the raja, wrongfully to\ndeprive one of his clansmen of the allowances or grants of land which were\nmade to each of them without offending all; and he could not afford to\ndespise the sentiments of his whole army. Outside his clan his power was\nless unlimited. Brahmins were protected by custom and religion, culti-\nvators by the abundance of land, and the possibility of flight if oppressed;\ntradesmen and artisans were carefully guarded; low castes like Cham\u00e1rs\nwere no doubt harshly treated, if population pressed on the means of\nsubsistence, or if their masters were capricious. In judicial matters the\nraja rarely interfered; if one of his ryots was murdered he exacted a small\nfine from the offender, Rs. 50 or so, as compensation to himself for the loss\nof a tenant.\n\nHere and there even in Oudh we can find a Hindu raja which circum-\nstances have combined to maintain in a condition something similar to\nthe above. I would point to that of Khairigarh in Kheri. It is an ancient\nraja, although the present occupants, themselves of a noble family, have\nonly succeeded to this principality within the last forty years. Here all\nthe elements of the archaic Hindu system are to be found, a small body\nof Chhattri kinsmen exercising great influence and possessing large fiefs,\nBrahmins holding religious grants, the mass of the population paying\nmoderate rents in great measure determined by custom, and leaving them\nsufficient for a most comfortable subsistence. A cluster of village\nmaidens at a well in Khairigarh glisten with silver ornaments, and the\nwhole village tinkles like a sheepfold as the white stranger passes through\non his elephant. The raja occupies a small unpretending house, and\namuses himself with his tenants in hunting and fishing. Here the Musal-\nman has had little influence for several hundreds of years. The last time\none of the king's generals attempted to penetrate to Khairigarh, he, with a\nlarge portion of his force, died of fever in the morasses.\n\nThe rajas overthrown by the Moslems.\u2014As a rule, however, Musalmans\nwhenever they became more near, intrusive, and authoritative overthrew\nthe raja, or endeavoured to do so. In the first place he was a rival in\nauthority of whom they were jealous, in the second his wealth aroused their cupidity. In Oudh, for instance, during the last thirty years of the eighteenth century, nearly every one of the principalities in Oudh were overturned, and in their place, not the village communities, but the r\u0101ja's kinsmen and retainers generally divided among them what small landed property or interests were admitted to exist by the new government. Just as some of the taluqas in Oudh have been formed by the aggregation of small communes, and the eviction of their proprietors, so others have been overturned and many small properties and village fiefs formed out of their d\u00e9bris. In Kheri, \u014cel, Mahewa, Mitauli are instances of the former, Muhamdi of the latter. After all there was but little difference except in the mere mode in which external relations with the Supreme Government were conducted. Society remained much the same whether the village heads were guided by some natural leader in a republic, or whether they merely aided with their advice and weighty counsels a hereditary chief. The danger has always been that a foreign power in acquiring the suzerainty, discovering the r\u0101ja to be the sole medium of the tribe's communication with itself, should come to regard him as the sole arbiter of the destinies of the community, as despotic over its customs, whereas he was merely the guardian of one and the spokesman of the other. The main point which I have studied to make clear in the above is that the principal factor, which determined whether the government of any given locality should be a republic or a monarchy, was the homogeneity of the population or the reverse.\n\nThe non-agricultural classes.\u2014So far little has been said of the non-agricultural classes who amount to 263,794, or 35.7 per cent. of the entire population according to the census returns; but there is no doubt that these are erroneous, for it is impossible that such a large proportion of the population can find subsistence in Kheri from trade. By closely analyzing the census return No. V. an amended estimate has been prepared. There are, it appears, 263,754 adult males in the district; of these 212,877 or 78 per cent. are either agriculturists or agricultural labourers, and there are 30,906 of the latter. The following is the return of the different trades and occupations as recorded in the census. Those trades have been omitted which number less than a hundred members. It may be here noted that there are no mines and no European industries in this district.\n\n| Occupation                                      | Number |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Village watchmen                                | 3,398   |\n| Government servants                             | 7,1     |\n| Soldiers                                        | 5,163   |\n| Priests or teachers of the Hindu religion       | 658     |\n| Sweepers                                        | 706     |\n| Inn-keepers                                     | 136     |\n| Barbers                                         | 1,836   |\n| Washermen                                       | 1,432   |\n| Personal attendants                             | 648     |\n| Bankers                                         | 400     |\n| Merchants                                       | 797     |\n| Agents                                          | 226     |\n| Wandering grain-dealers                         | 4,847   |\n| Coachmen, livery stable-keepers                 | 286     |\n| Pack carriers on bullocks                       | 501     |\n| Palki bearers                                   | 650     |\n| Proprietors of land                             | 4,309   |\n| Cultivators                                     | 174,545 |\n| Gardeners and agricultural labourers            | 112     |\n| Herdsmen                                        | 2,456   |\n| Shepherds                                       | 542     |\n| Carpenters and turners                          | 1,443   |\n| Necklace-makers                                 | 245     |\n| Weavers                                         | 3,155   |\n| Cotton-cleaners                                 | 990     |\n| Carpet, drugget, and blanket makers             | 112     |\n| Dyers                                           | 158     |\n| Embroiderers of gold and silver thread, lace-makers | 159     |\n| Thread spinners and sellers                     | 319     |\n| Tailors                                         | 384     |\n| Wine-sellers                                    | 728     |\n| Milk sellers                                    | 797     |\n| Grain sellers                                   | 1,663   |\nKHE\n\n| Occupation                  | Kheri | Shahjahanpur |\n|----------------------------|-------|--------------|\n| Corn-grinders              | 198   | 542          |\n| Tobacco-sellers            | 200   | 140          |\n| Panleaf-sellers            | 420   | 856          |\n| Confectioners, sweetmeat-sellers | 469   | 1,170        |\n| Butchers                   | 268   | 406          |\n| Greengrocers               | 850   | 30,906       |\n| Fishmongers                | 119   | 3,077        |\n| Grain-parchers             | 1,018 | 162          |\n| Leather-sellers or workers | 1,279 | 120          |\n| Oil makers and sellers     | 1,632 | 1,559        |\n| Bamboo-workers             | 245   | 105          |\n| Leafplate-makers           | 171   |              |\n\nSide by side with the Kheri trade list I place that of Shahjahanpur which borders it to the west, and is a similar district with a similar population originally; the broadest contrasts exist. In Kheri there are only 400 bankers, and nearly all of these carry on a very petty village business. In Shahjahanpur there are 3,040 bankers of various kinds, while 130 perfumers, 587 makers of hookah snakes, 326 lawyers, 172 firework-makers, 3,017 goldsmiths, bear evidence in other ways to the great prosperity of the country. Shahjahanpur has not the same natural advantages as Kheri, which possesses a more fertile soil, intersected or bordered by three great navigable rivers. Kheri likewise has been, in very early times, a seat of Hindu civilization, and was twice colonized by Musulman emperors, who selected it as the best place for a prosperous settlement. But Shahjahanpur enjoyed several artificial advantages,\u2014one that of English government for three quarters of a century, another a resident proprietary body of yeomen, with small estates, upon which most of them are not ashamed to labour. Lastly, there has always been a large expenditure on roads, buildings, and the support of troops, European and Native. In all these matters Kheri exhibits a broad contrast.\n\nN.B.\u2014The numbers entered for Kheri are those of adult males only; those of Shahjahanpur include their families. For comparison the former should be multiplied by 3\u00bd.\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE.\n\nAdministrative divisions\u2014The Police\u2014The Jail\u2014Crimes\u2014Accidental deaths\u2014Income Tax\u2014The land revenue\u2014Schools\u2014Post-office statistics.\n\nAdministrative divisions and organization.\u2014For administrative purposes the district of Kheri is divided into three tahsils\u2014Lakhimpur, Muhamdi, and Nighasan\u2014which include seventeen parganas, as per tabular form already given.\n\nThere are seven th\u00e1na or police stations\u2014Muhamdi, Gola, Bhira, Lakhimpur, Dhaurahra, Sing\u00e1hi, Mitauli.\n\nStatement showing the population of the th\u00e1na jurisdictions.\n\n| Name of th\u00e1na | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Lakhimpur     | 196,850    |\n| Gola          | 88,120     |\n| Mitauli       | 79,109     |\n| Bhira         | 60,694     |\n| Muhamdi       | 108,834    |\n| Dhaurahra     | 121,698    |\n| Sing\u00e1hi       | 90,968     |\n| **Total**     | **739,288** |\n\nLaw courts.\u2014Omitting the temporary settlement courts, there are six paid and two unpaid magistrates, the latter being landed proprietors in the district. The number of these would be larger, but from the general want of intelligence of the class, it is difficult to discover any one fitted for the exercise of authority. In this respect, the district is exceptionally unfortunate. All the above officers have also civil and revenue* powers. There are 391 rural and 15 town police, maintained at a cost of Rs. 46,061; two members of this force are Europeans, the rest are natives. The most distant village is 59 miles from the nearest paid court, but this is perhaps unavoidable.\n\nStatistics of the Police of the District of Kheri in 1873.\n\n|                | Total cost. | No. of European and Eurasian officers. | Native officers. | No. of constables. | Aggregate strength of all ranks. | Proportion of police per square mile of area. | Proportion of police per head of population. | No. of arrests made. | No. of complaints registered. | No. of cases sent by police to magistrate. | No. of convictions obtained. | No. of acquittals. |\n|----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------|\n| Regular police | 58,525      | 2                                    | 68              | 316                | 1 to 9.76                        | 1 to 2364                                   | 1236                                        | 4714                | 1903                            | 1416                             | 487                    |\n| Village watch  | 91,335      | 2                                    | 40              | 2486               |                                  |                                             |                                             |                     |                                 |                                 |                       |\n| Municipal police | 1,200      | 2                                    | 22              |                    |                                  |                                             |                                             |                     |                                 |                                 |                       |\n| **Total**      | **1,51,061**| **2**                                | **110**         | **2824**           | **2938**                         |                                             |                                             |                     |                                 |                                 |                       |\n\n* Oudh Civil List, pages 48, 60.\nThere is one jail in the district, a mud walled erection, built to accommodate 149 prisoners; the average number of inmates in 1875 was 202. The total number imprisoned during the year was 783 males and 75 females. The average cost of rations during the five years ending 1875 was Rs. 15-3-3 per head, that of hospital charges 6\u00bd annas, that of clothing Rs. 1-9-6; the total cost, including establishment, was Rs. 47-7-0. The average earnings per head of prisoners sentenced to labour were Rs. 7 in 1875, the actual cash earnings also Rs. 7. The manufactures are coarse cotton cloth, towels, paper, oil-pressing, and rug-weaving. The official returns of the occupations and ages of the prisoners in the jails of this province are too untrustworthy to be quoted. For instance, in Hardoi 144 prisoners are represented as men of property;* in Kheri, an adjoining and similar district, not one; in Gonda there are stated to be 37 prisoners; above 60 in Bahraich; and Bara Banki not one.\n\nThere is nothing noteworthy about the district crime except that it is increasing rapidly. See table. It is doubtful, however, if all the crime is reported.\n\nCrime statistics for Kheri district.\n\n| Crimes                      | Cases reported | Cases investigated | Cases convicted |\n|-----------------------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Murder and attempt          |                |                    |                 |\n| Calamities homicide         |                |                    |                 |\n| Dacoity                     |                |                    |                 |\n| Robbery                     |                |                    |                 |\n| Rioting and unlawful assembly |              |                    |                 |\n| Theft by house-breaking or house-trespass |        |                    |                 |\n| Theft, simple               |                |                    |                 |\n| Theft of cattle             |                |                    |                 |\n| Offences against coin and stamps |            |                    |                 |\n\nThe following is a table of accidental deaths for the years 1867 to 1872 inclusive. Snake-bites are particularly fatal to women it appears; but this is accounted for by the women largely engaging in weeding, gleaning, and also to their habit of early walking in the dusk before sunrise. The wild animals are bears, tigers, and wolves\u2014all of them very scarce in the district, at least in the populous portions of it.\n\n* In 1871.\nComparative statement of accidental deaths for the years 1867, 1868, 1869, 1870, 1871, 1872, in Kheri district.\n\n| Year | Suicides | By drowning | By snake-bites | By wild quadrupeds | By fall of buildings | By other causes | Total |\n|------|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|\n|      | Male     | Female      | Male           | Female             | Male                | Female         |       |\n| 1867 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1868 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1869 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1870 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1871 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n| 1872 |          |             |                |                    |                     |                |       |\n\nIncome tax.\u2014The elementary nature of Kheri trade and manufactures will be apparent from the subjoined income tax return, which is more interesting under this section than from a fiscal point of view. It will appear that there are only 92 persons in the district whose revenues are supposed to exceed Rs. 1,000 per annum. Of these 69 are landowners or cultivators who pay between them Rs. 5,543 out of Rs. 5,984. The entire tax on the trade and manufactures of the district amounts therefore to only Rs. 441, although, in addition to the ordinary trade and manufactures, the district furnishes in its forest, waste lands, and proximity to Naip\u00e1l extraordinary resources which are not taxed by the State through its land revenue. There are numerous timber merchants in Kheri; apparently they made no profits in the years in question, which indeed is quite possible.\n\nAnnual return showing details of assessments made under Part V. of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1872, on different sources of income during the year ending 31st March, 1873.\n\n| Sources of income or profits | Class I | Class II | Class III | Class IV | Total |\n|-----------------------------|---------|----------|-----------|----------|-------|\n|                             | Number  | Tax      | Number    | Tax      | Number | Tax   |\n| I.

When recently revised and fixed for thirty years, it was raised to Rs. 1,131,000;* but of this sum about Rs. 250,000 will not be demanded for periods of from five to fifteen years in order to allow time for the accumulation of capital, and the spread of cultivation.\n\nThe administration is conducted by a deputy commissioner, with one or more assistant commissioners, and the usual staff. The cost in 1871 was Rs. 175,914; but that included the expenses of the settlement department, whose operations are drawing to a conclusion.\n\nCost of administration.\u2014In 1875, the annual expense of administration was about Rs. 1,20,000, and perhaps, 3,000 square miles of country, with a population of three quarters of a million, on the border of a foreign state, were never governed so cheaply before. In order, however, to make the comparison a strictly fair one, Rs. 40,000, the estimated payments to the village policemen, should be added.\n\nThe expenditure for 1870 was as follows:\u2014\n\n| Item          | Rs.     |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Land revenue  | 38,891  |\n| Excise        | 2,160   |\n| Stamps        | 1,554   |\n| Law and justice | 27,616 |\n| Medical       | 3,747   |\n| Police        | 46,061  |\n| **Total**     | **1,20,039** |\n\nRevenues\u2014The revenues received by Government from the district were in 1871\u2014\n\n| Item          | Rs.     |\n|---------------|---------|\n| Land Revenue  | 6,24,714|\n| Excise        | 53,212  |\n| Assessed Taxes| 11,978  |\n| Stamps        | 39,816  |\n| Law and Justice| 11,608 |\n| **Total**     | **7,41,828** |\n\nIt appears, then, that the land tax forms six-sevenths of the total State income (this tax is treble what it was in the time of the Emperor Akbar); further, that Kheri, as tested by the proceeds of the income tax and the sale of stamps, is the poorest district in Oudh.

Government has recently made some reductions in the land tax lest its pressure should be unduly felt.\n\nIt cannot be determined whether this taxation is heavy or not till we have a more exact estimate of the district resources. As already seen the wealth of the district is purely agricultural, the cultivation is 792,000 acres, and the average crop is worth about Rs. 12 per acre. The annual agricultural income then would be Rs. 9,404,000, of which Government takes Rs. 1,572,000, or almost exactly one-sixth\u2014a just proportion, taking into consideration that it is the landlord as well as the ruler.

In respect of education it is the most backward district in Oudh. There is one female school at Muhamdi with 17 pupils. In the adjoining district of Hardoi there are 72 schools with 3,244 pupils. The cause of this difference is partly the existence of large towns in the latter district; but mainly the fact that property is more distributed, there being numerous small landowners who can afford to send their children to school. In Lakhimpur school for instance, the pupils are all sons of Government servants or of shop-keepers, there being not a single landowner's son in attendance, although it is the only school in the district where a really good education can be acquired. This divorce between education and property is much to be regretted. There are no educational or literary societies, but a small book club has been recently established.\n\nThe extent of the post-offices, and the degree to which the people avail themselves of them, is shown by the following tables:\nPost-office statistics for 1876-77.\n\n| Letters | Papers | Packets | Parcels |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Number given out for delivery. | Number returned undelivered. | Number given out for delivery. | Number returned undelivered. | Number given out for delivery. | Number returned undelivered. |\n| 15,705 | 1,967 | 864 | 55 | 94 | 2 | 78 | 9 |\n\nStatement showing the working of the district d\u0101k in 1876-77.\n\nNumber of miles of d\u0101k line ... ... ... ... 52\nNumber of runners = ... ... ... ... 29\nCost ... ... ... ... 2,314\nNumber of covers delivered ... ... ... ... 14,708\n\" \" returned undelivered ... ... ... ... 3,938\nTotal number of letters sent to district post-office ... ... ... ... 16,741 0 0\nPostage realized ... ... ... ... 853 14 0\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nGeneral\u2014In 1856\u2014In Akbar's time\u2014Ancient events\u2014The P\u00e1ndu brothers\u2014Kheri as Raja Bair\u00e1t's residence\u2014The B\u00e1chbils\u2014The Sayyads\u2014The Abbans\u2014The Janw\u00e1rs\u2014The J\u00e1ngres\u2014The Pah\u00e1ri S\u00farajbans\u2014Buildings and antiquities.\n\nHistory.\u2014The present district of Kheri has as such a very brief history. It has only existed as an administrative unit since 1858. Under the native sovereigns of Oudh it was partly in the Chakla of Muhamdi and partly in that of Khairabad. In 1856, when Oudh was annexed, two districts, those of Muhamdi and Mall\u00e1pur, divided between them the whole of Kheri in addition to several of the bordering parganas now included in Hardoi, Sitapur, and Bahraich. Their headquarters were Muhamdi and Mall\u00e1pur, one to the extreme west of the present district, the other at the south-eastern corner, but in Sitapur. Why such a location of the administration was made cannot now be ascertained; both places were much out of the way. When the mutiny broke out the officers were unable to escape; those of Muhamdi were captured by the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur mutineers or by the R\u00e1ja of Mitauli and massacred; those at Mall\u00e1pur fled north into the jungles of Naip\u00e1l, being cut off from a retreat to the south, and perished of fever and ague. After annexation Lakhimpur was selected for the headquarters. It is 28 miles due north and within easy reach of Sitapur; but it cannot be considered central or very accessible, some villages being about sixty miles distant. When Oudh was under a native government, as was the case till 1855, we find that the administrative divisions into which it was divided varied. Under the emperors it formed a part of the sark\u00e1r or division of Khairabad, and was divided into the parganas or counties of Barwar, Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, Kheri, Khairigarh, and Garh Qila Nawa. Of these Barwar is now represented by tahsil Muhamdi, Kheri, and Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra by tahsil Lakh\u00edmpur, Khairigarh, and Garh Qila Nawa, comprised the territory now in tahsil Nigh\u00e1san. The above administrative detail is of little importance; real interest attaches to the chronicles and vicissitudes of the clans who owned the soil and fought for it.\n\nIn Akbar's time the country was divided entirely among zamindari bodies. The R\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, who afterwards acquired nearly the whole district by fraud, then held, under a royal grant, only 3,000 bighas and five small villages. The great r\u00e1j of the Janw\u00e1rs which under its three heads Kaimahra, Oel, and Mahewa, now embraces 330 villages did not then exist. Similarly the J\u00e1ngres' estate of Bh\u00far Dhaurahra, which covered 800 square miles, did not exist even in the germ. The Abb\u00e1n's estate of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra existed no doubt in Akbar's time, but was much smaller and more divided, while the great S\u00farajbans r\u00e1j of Khairigarh is a creation of 1838. In later times there were four great families, who held the lands now comprised in this district\u2014namely, the Sayyads of Barwar, the Abbans of Mitauli and Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, the Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri, the J\u00e1ngres of Dhaurahra. The histories of the two latter families are given under the names of those places, and will be abstracted here; their annals cover the period between 1,500 and 1855 A.D.\nGoing further back into legendary history, the Kheri district can boast that one of its villages was the site of a wealthy and populous kingdom 3,500 years ago, and that one of the most dramatic episodes in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, the Iliad of the East, occurred within its boundaries. I shall consider this incident, as it not only contains the principal legend of the district, but also introduces us to a powerful clan, the B\u0101chhils. The village of Balmi\u0101r Barkh\u0101r, in pargana Muhamdi, is said to have been the residence of R\u0101ja Bair\u0101t, with whom the P\u0101ndus stayed during the thirteenth year of their exile, and all the details of their sojourn, with the precise locality in which each incident occurred, are pointed out by the residents on the spot. There, they say, was the palace of the king\u2019s wicked brother-in-law Kichaka. To this hill went Draupadi, the wife of the five P\u0101ndus, to meet him. Here is still the hollow in the ground where, as in a huge mortar, Kichaka was pounded by the mighty Bh\u012bm; also the small mound where Kichaka\u2019s dead body was burnt.\n\nThe story may be epitomized here. The five P\u0101ndus, who had gambled away their entire estate and even their liberty, had bound themselves by an oath to remain concealed for the thirteen years of their banishment from Hastinapur. They came to Bair\u0101tkhera in disguise, and all were taken into service. The eldest, Judhisthir, undertook to teach the king gambling, having learned too late the trick by which he had been cheated of his kingdom. Bh\u012bm the giant became cook; Arjun, dressed as a eunuch, was admitted as teacher of dancing and singing into the zan\u0101na; Nakul became chief coachman; and S\u0101hdeo master of the cattle. Among other adventures, Bh\u012bm overcame Jimuta, a mighty wrestler; but the principal incident of the sojourn is the passion conceived for Draupadi by Kichaka, the brother-in-law of the king. Kichaka asked his sister, the queen, who had engaged the beautiful Draupadi\u2019s services, to send her to his house. The queen consented, and gave Draupadi a goblet of wine to carry to Kichaka. Weeping and trembling she presented herself before the queen\u2019s brother who treated her rudely, and when she ran away to seek redress in the king\u2019s council, Kichaka followed, seized her by the hair, and kicked her before all. The raja, when appealed to, said he did not know what had taken place between them, and could not therefore interfere. Draupadi appealed to Bh\u012bm, the mightiest of her five husbands, and by his advice agreed to meet Kichaka at night in the music hall of the palace. Bh\u012bm repaired in her stead to the place of assignation; and when Kichaka, deceived by the darkness, went up to the giant thinking it was Draupadi, Bh\u012bm seized him by his hair which, being well oiled, slipped through his fingers. A long fight ensued, but Bh\u012bm at last whirled Kichaka round striking his head against the wall. He then ground and broke in his chest with his knee. Afterwards smashing all the bones, he pounded the body into pieces and kneaded it into a ball, so that the people might think that some Gandharva, or evil demon, had done the deed. Kichaka\u2019s brothers caught Draupadi and tied her to Kichaka\u2019s funeral pile, but Bh\u012bm, with his long hair tangled round his face and a club on his shoulders, rescued her.\n\nThe rest of the P\u0101ndus\u2019 adventures are of a more prosaic description, but their life in Bair\u0101tkhera, as told in the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata; constitutes the most detailed picture of Hindu court and domestic life, which has\nbeen handed down to us, being far more minute than the biblical account of the Pharaohs in Egypt, contemporaries of this R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t, who reigned in Barkh\u00e1r.\n\nIn later times Barkh\u00e1r formed part of the estate granted to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Newal R\u00e1e, the d\u00edw\u00e1n of Safdar Jang, Wazir of Oudh. Newal R\u00e1e gave it to certain Brahmins who still hold the estate. It is now a small village with a population of 419. Its peasants when guiding their ploughs over the ancient site, repeatedly find the earth give way beneath them, and disclose some well or tunnel testifying to the presence of the old city, where Draupadi rejected the addresses of the queen's brother about the very time when Joseph was flying from an Egyptian lady.\n\nGeneral Cunningham questions the truth of the tradition in the account of his arch\u00e6ological tour:\n\n\"Barikh\u00e1r* is the name of a village on the top of an extensive old mound called Vair\u00e1tkhera, which is situated on the high road between N\u00edms\u00e1r and Pilibhit, at 42 miles from the former, and 68 miles from the latter place. Barikh\u00e1r is said to be a corruption of Barigakhera or Vair\u00e1tkhera, and its foundation is attributed to Vair\u00e1t R\u00e1ja in the time of the P\u00e1ndus. The ruined mound is 1,000 feet in length at top from east to west, by 600 feet in breadth, and from 16 to 20 feet in height. But the dimensions at the base are much more, as the slope is very gentle being 200 feet in length on the north side where I measured it. This would make the base of the mound about 1,400 feet, which agrees with the size of 50 bighas, or 1,400,000 square feet, which is popularly attributed to it by the villagers themselves. But the fields are strewn with broken bricks for upwards of 1,000 feet to the northward, and for 500 or 600 feet to the eastward, where there are the remains of several temples.\n\n\"The area actually covered by ruins is not less than 2,000 feet square, or upwards of 1\u00bd miles in circuit, which shows that Barikh\u00e1r must once have been a good-sized town; but I strongly doubt the story of the Brahmins which attributes the foundation to Vair\u00e1t R\u00e1ja. The name is written by the people themselves Badish\u00e1r, although it is pronounced Barikh\u00e1r, and I believe that similarity of sound alone has led to the identification of Barikh\u00e1r with Barigakhera and Vair\u00e1t R\u00e1ja.\" It may be remarked with reference to the above, that it is true several places lay claim to having been the residence of R\u00e1ja Vair\u00e1t and the scene of this exploit, yet there are reasons why this neighbourhood has pre-eminent claims. In the first place it is almost impossible that the P\u00e1ndus, five young exiles wandering with difficulty about the country, could get so far as either Dholka in Gujar\u00e1t, Dinagepur in Bengal, or Bijaipur in Sat\u00e1r\u0101, when the event has been localized by others. Wheeler writes as follows:\n\n\"In turning to the mythical details which connect the tradition of the amours of Kichaka with the history of the Pandavas, it will be necessary in the first instance to inquire into the geographical position of the r\u0101j of Virata. Here, at the very outset, a difficulty presents itself of no ordinary magnitude.\"\n\n* Vol. I., p. 351.\n\"The local traditions of two widely distant countries present almost equal claims to the country of Virata\u2014namely, the peninsula of Gujar\u00e1t on the western side of India, and the valley of the Brahmaputra on its eastern quarter. In the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, the r\u0101j of Virata is called Matsya, or the country of the fish, and the city is indifferently termed Matsya or Virata.\n\n\"The local traditions of Gujar\u00e1t declare that the site of Matsya-nuggur or Viratapur is occupied by the modern town of Dholka, which is situated on the southern coast of the neck of the peninsula.\n\n\"The local traditions of eastern Bengal are more explicit. The district of Dinagepur is still called Matsya; and the remains of ancient forts, said to be those of Virata and Kichaka, are pointed out to this day as proofs of the truth of the traditions.\n\n\"The whole of this region, however, would appear to have been the land of fable. Here it was that Bh\u00edma fought against the Asuras; and it was in this same country that the sage Vyasa was supernaturally born of Mateya, the fish-girl. Whether, however, the r\u0101j of Virata is to be placed in the peninsula of Guzerat or in the region of eastern Bengal, it is in either case far too distant from the neighbourhood of Hastinapur to admit of such campaigns as those of Duryodhana and Susarman.\"\n\nNow none of the difficulties which attend the identification of R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t's capital with any of these distant towns are met with, if we accept this little Oudh village as the real scene of Bh\u00edma's exploit, a feat, which however overlaid with fable, probably possesses a greater substratum of truth than most heroic myths. In the first place this whole district, west of the Kathna, has been called from time immemorial P\u00e1ruh\u00e1r or P\u00e1nduhars, as being the place where the P\u00e1ndus wandered during their exile from the court of Delhi. Further, Kanauj is in the immediate vicinity of Balmiar Barkh\u00e1r, and in A.D. 1030, Biruni, the Arabian geographer, wrote that Kanauj was as celebrated for the descendants of the P\u00e1ndus as Muttra was for Krishna.* In other words, that Kanauj and its neighbourhood were the scenes of the P\u00e1ndus' exploits as Muttra was of Krishna's. Nor is the tradition, which represents Barkh\u00e1r as the capital of Bair\u00e1t, an isolated one. It extends over all Oudh. The boundaries of the kingdom are still pointed out, and Harg\u00e1m, a village 35 miles to the east, is admitted by its inhabitants to have been a mere postal or frontier town belonging to R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t who reigned at Barkh\u00e1r.\n\nIt is quite easy to understand that when the Brahmanical faith was introduced among the aboriginal tribes of the south and far east, its missionaries may have endeavoured to conciliate the people by announcing that the great Arian heroes had actually visited and sanctified the country in which they were now labouring. The fable would be safe from detection, but it is otherwise with Oudh. In a country lying near Delhi, and which has been at all times held and peopled by the descendants of the P\u00e1ndus, it would be impossible to forge a claim for any place\n\n* Elliott's Historians, Vol I., 54.\nto be the scene of an exploit so famous and so well known as that which occurred at Bair\u00e1tkhera.\n\nGranting that some such event occurred, assuming also that it must have happened as Mr. Wheeler argues somewhere not very far from Delhi, this village being also the only place so situated for who any claim is advanced, that claim being supported by other and converging traditions, and by an alliance of names which could hardly have been imposed for the purpose of bolstering up the title of one place to be the scene of a single event, it is hard to see why that claim should be disallowed. It is absurd to argue that the story was localized here, because a pre-existing name suited it; for there are innumerable places of the same name in Oudh and Northern India; there being another only five miles from Balmi\u00e1r Barkh\u00e1r. If it were the object of unscrupulous priests to forge such traditions, the motive would have applied elsewhere, and dozens of Barkh\u00e1rs would have claimed to be considered the P\u00e1ndus' city of refuge; but no other has done so. It is probable that whatever of real fact underlies this tale actually occurred at Barkh\u00e1r, as also that Arjun really married the daughter of Gandrak, and fought with his son Babhruvahan at Manw\u00e1n in the Sitapur district.*\n\nThere seems also some reason to suppose that the B\u00e1chhil Chhattirs are the descendants of this R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t or of his subjects. General Cunningham\u2020 believes that similarity of sound alone has led to the identification of Barkh\u00e1r with Bariakhera and Vair\u00e1t R\u00e1ja; but in his account of Dewal we find \"the B\u00e1chhil Rajputs claim descent from R\u00e1ja Vena, whose son was Vir\u00e1t, the reputed founder of Baribh\u00e1r or Vir\u00e1tkhera, and whom I believe to be the same as Vira Varma of the inscription.\"\n\nThe B\u00e1chhil Chhattirs are then a possible link from the hoariest traditions of Indian antiquity to a middle age period, which has been fairly chronicled, and lastly to the complete annals of modern times. I have been enabled to present to the reader one rather dim outlined picture of life in 1800 B.C.; another follows in 900 A.D., a third about 1640 A.D., a fourth in 1850 A.D., and a fifth in 1870 A.D., all drawn from the annals of one tribe and family still resident in the ancestral fief. It is the more desirable to follow out the annals of this clan,\u2014first, because it is one of the very few in Oudh which does seem rightfully to claim an antiquity equal to that of English noble families which came in with the conqueror, and second, because its surviving members though respectable are too poor to purchase false genealogies, and so humble in the social scale as to render a fictitious pedigree of no value. Consequently they now relate only the real traditions of their ancestors. Doubtless in the days of their prosperity their own vanity and the venal flattery of dependents invented many an incident of heraldry and chivalry to their credit, but these have been long forgotten, and only what is true in great measure remains.\n\nWe left R\u00e1ja Bair\u00e1t at Barkh\u00e1r, six miles south of Muhamdi, his subjects perhaps the ancestors of the present B\u00e1chhils; they moved to\n\n* Wheeler's India, Vol. I, page 410.\n\u2020 Cunningham's Reports of Archaeological Survey, Journal A.S., No. CXXX., page 270.\nthe northwards, and in 992 A.D., we find that a local chief named Lalla governed at Garh Gajana or Ilah\u00e1b\u00e1s near Dewal. This place is sixteen miles south-east of Pilibhit on the bank of the Katni n\u00e1di, and thirty-five miles north-west of Barkh\u00e1r. In fact all the capitals of the B\u00e1chhil clan\u2014Barkh\u00e1r, Nigohi, Garh Gajana, K\u00e1mp on the S\u00e1rd\u00e1\u2014are within a few miles of each other, two in Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur west of the Gumti, two in Kheri east of the old river. We know nothing about Lalla or his race except from the inscription which he caused to be cut, and the coins which are still to be found. From them we learn that the people were Hindus, as might have been surmised from the Buddhist pilgrims not having visited or referred to any shrines in the neighbourhood when passing to and from Kanauj. There we find a canal twenty miles long connecting transversely two affluents of the river Garra, the Khanaut, and the M\u00e1la. This canal was probably mainly intended for defensive purposes; for at Dewal it is made to take almost a complete circuit round a high mound on which the ruins of the B\u00e1chhil capital are still to be seen, covered with the jungle of many centuries. There are the remains of several temples, a figure of the Var\u00e1ha or boar avt\u00e1r of Vishnu, so abundant on coins all over Kheri; also several arghas or bases for lingams, probably demolished by the Moslems, kankar images of Shiva and Debi, and lastly an inscription dated Sambat 1049 or 992 A.D.*\n\nThere we get our second glimpse at the B\u00e1chhils. This little kingdom was one of the numerous small sovereignties which were formed in the east of the Ganges after the decline of Buddhism, and which were all absorbed in Kanauj on the rise of the R\u00e1thor sovereignty about 1072 A.D.\u2020\n\nThe inscription is in the Kat\u00edla character, so called from every letter having a bottom stroke or tail bent to the right. It recites that R\u00e1ja Lalla gave villages to the Brahmans, that he had cut a canal from the Nirmala (pellucid) river, now contracted to M\u00e1la; that the villages were shaded by pleasant trees, and watered by this beautiful \u201cand holy\u201d Katha nadi \u201cor canal.\u201d It is now called Katni. The inscription proves what is apparent enough from the appearance of the channel that it is artificial. This Katni flows about twelve miles west of the Gumti; about twelve miles east of that river is another Kathna, upon whose banks stands Atwa another later capital of the B\u00e1chhils; it is more than probable that this river too has an artificial channel.\n\nThe B\u00e1chhils were then an enterprising race in those days; they were Hindus in faith; they worshipped Vishnu under the boar avt\u00e1r; they had a coinage both in silver and gold, many specimens of which have been found near their old capitals on the Kathna. It seems, too, that their dynasty was of sufficient intelligence and energy to construct no less than two canals about a hundred miles in length: one of them is still navigable, the other has somewhat silted up. They did more apparently for the material improvement of the country in the tenth century of the\n\n* Cunningham's Archaeological Report, Volume I., page 352. Journal Asiatic Society, Volume XIX., 1856, page 189, loc. cit., page 777.\n\u2020 Prinsep's Tables, page 358\nChristian era than any of their successors in the government during the ensuing nine. Some further particulars about the B\u0101chhils I take from General Cunningham.*\n\n\"The inscription goes on to say that R\u0101ja Lalla and his wife Lakshmi made many groves, gardens, lakes, and temples.\" Prinsep has given the last as \"many other extensive works,\" but the term in the original is devalayatanesbrucha, \"and temples,\" devilaya being one of the commonest names for a temple of any kind. In the 27th verse the great temple to which the inscription was attached is said to have been dedicated to Shiva by the r\u0101ja, while the queen built another fane to P\u0101rbati. In the next verse they are described as \"two divine temples\" (sura-griha); and in the 32nd verse it is stated that the god and goddess were worshipped together under the title of devapalli. This then must be the origin of the name of deval, and the great temple mound to the south of Garh Gajana must be the remains of the two temples dedicated to devapalli.\n\nIn the inscription R\u0101ja Lalla calls himself the nephew of M\u0101ns Chandra Pratapa, and the grandson of Vira Varma, who is said to be of the race of Chhindu, and descended from the great Rishi Chyavana. This holy sage is mentioned in the Vishnu Pur\u0101na as having married Sukanya, the daughter of Sary\u0101ti, the son of Manu. He is also noticed in the Bhagavata and Padma Pur\u0101nas as appropriating a share of the marriage offerings to the Aswini Kum\u0101ras, which entailed the quarrel with Indra; that is alluded to in verse four of the inscription. The family therefore was reputed to be of ancient descent; but if Vira Varma, the grandfather of Lalla, was the first r\u0101ja. The establishment of the dynasty cannot be dated earlier than A.D. 900. Now the B\u0101chhil Rajputs claim descent from R\u0101ja Vena, whose son was Virdt, the reputed founder of Barikh\u0101r or Vird\u0101khera, and who I believe to be the same as Vira Varma of the inscription. To R\u0101ja Vena, or Ben, is attributed the erection of the great forts of Garhakhera and S\u0101hgarh; and to his queen, Ketaki R\u0101ni, is assigned the excavation of the R\u0101ni Tal at the old town of K\u0101bar Garh Gajana, and the temples of Dewal were built by R\u0101ja Lalla. The town and fort of Maraori are attributed to Moradkhwaj and Barkhera to Harmal R\u0101ja; but neither of these names appears in the very imperfect and scanty list of their family which the B\u0101chhils now possess.\n\n\"It is admitted by every one that the Katehriyas succeeded the B\u0101chhils, but the Katehriyas themselves state that they did not settle in Katehar until Sambat 1231, or A.D. 1174. Up to this date, therefore, the B\u0101chhil r\u0101jas may be supposed to have possessed the dominant power in eastern Rohilkhand beyond the R\u0101mganga, while western Rohilkhand was held by the Bhidar, Gwal\u0101, and other tribes, from whom the Katehriyas profess to have wrested it. Gradually the B\u0101chhils must have retired before the Katehriyas, until they had lost all their territory to the west of the Deoha or Pilibhit river. Here they made a successful stand, and though frequently afterwards harried by the Muhammadans, they still managed to hold their small territory between the Deoha river and the\n\n* Archaeological Tour, Volume I., page 356.\nprimeval forests of Pilibhit. When hard pressed they escaped to the jungle, which still skirts their ancient possessions of Garh G\u00e1jana and Garha Khera. But their resistance was not always successful, as their descendants confess that about 300 or 400 years ago, when their capital Nigohi was taken by the king of Delhi, the twelve sons of Raja Udara\u1e47a, or Aorana, were all put to death. The twelve cenotaphs of these princes are still shown at Nigohi. Shortly after this catastrophe Chhavi R\u0101na, the grandson of one of the murdered princes, fled to the Lakhi jungle, where he supported himself by plundering; but when orders were given to exterminate his band, he presented himself before the king of Delhi and obtained the district of Nigohi as a J\u0101gir. This place his descendant Tarsam Singh still holds, but the J\u0101gir is reduced to the town of Nigohi with a few of the surrounding villages.\n\n\"The Gotr\u0101ch\u0101rya of the B\u0101chhil Rajputs declares them to be Chandravansis, and their high social position is attested by their daughters being taken in marriage by Chauhans, R\u0101thors, and Kachhw\u0101has. According to Sir H. Elliot, B\u0101chhil zamindars are found in the districts of Aligarh and Mathura, as well as in Budson and Shahjah\u0101npur of Rohilkhand. But the race is even more widely spread than the Gangetic B\u0101chhils are aware of, as Abul Fazl records that 'the part of Aramraj (in the Peninsula of Gujar\u0101t) is a very strong place inhabited by the tribe of B\u0101chhil.' Of the origin of the name nothing is known, but it is probably connected with b\u0101chh\u0101n\u0101, to select or choose. The title of Chhindu, which is given in the inscription, is also utterly unknown to the people, and I can only guess that it may be the name of one of the early ancestors of the race.\"\n\nThe history of the B\u0101chhils is a comparative blank till the seventeenth century. We can only conjecture that they reigned at Nigohi over the country now included in parganas Muhamdi, Pasgawan, Atwa Piparia, Bh\u016br in Oudh, with Bar\u0101gaon and Shahjah\u0101npur in that district of the North-Western Provinces. On the east they had for neighbours the Ahbans who will be afterwards referred to; on the west the Katehriyas whose capital in this neighbourhood was Paw\u0101in. No Musalmans had as yet made any permanent settlements in the place; all their establishments are of later foundation.\n\nTughlaq Shah had passed through on his way to Khairigarh in 1379. Firoz Sh\u0101h laid waste the whole country to revenge the massacre of the Governor of Budaun by the Katehriyas, and it was doubtless on this occasion that Nigohi was captured. They still relate themselves the fearful effects of the emperor's raid when 365 of their forts were levelled, and as the Musalman historians state that 23,000 of the inhabitants were carried into slavery, the fact is not improbable. The country became a wilderness over which the B\u0101chhils, now barbarous moss-troopers, exercised a precarious sovereignty. Bilgram in Hardoi was probably the nearest town boasting any appearance of civilization. The sites of Shahabad, Muhamdi, Aurangabad were then covered with forest. In 1556 the Sayyads of Barwar obtained the grant of the latter place, so called from being hid in the forest. Another indication of the wild nature of the country is\nderived from the affix to Barwar, this pargana is known in the Mughal revenue records as Barwar Anj\u00e1na, the unknown Barwar. The history of the Barwar Sayyads, who displaced the B\u00e1chhils from the pre-eminence in Western Kheri, will be deferred for the present. We must follow the fortunes of the B\u00e1chhils.\n\nIn Shah Jah\u00e1n's reign a B\u00e1chhil chief held possession of Barwar pargana and also of K\u00e1mp Dhaurahra, which lies along both banks of the Chauka, and includes the present parganas of Dhaurahra, Nigh\u00e1san, and Bh\u00e1r. The emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n sent the B\u00e1chhil leader to reduce some rebels in Karra M\u00e1nikpur. He defeated them, and returning rapidly to Delhi entered the presence with the blood stains of battle yet upon his clothes. The courtiers were shocked, but Shah Jah\u00e1n addressed him with the title \"Beta Chhipi Khan,\" which means \"my son, you gore-besprinkled chief.\" The B\u00e1chhil retained his authority for some time, but his dominions, however extensive, must have been mostly a wilderness. His fort at K\u00e1mp in pargana Bh\u00e1r, whose brick walls still remain on a bluff overlooking the Chauka, was not much larger than the houses of many a village owner. The site was well chosen, the ground is high: it is defended in front by the river, across which extended the forests of Khairigarh to the base of the hills. Behind it still spreads a vast forest from the Chauka to the Kathna. This would protect Chhipi Khan from the assaults of the Governor of Khairabad in which province Barwar, the unknown, was supposed to be situated; but the whole geography of the locality was but dimly defined. This forest is still one of the most dense, lonely, and malarious in India; for many miles the traveller on an elephant pursues a narrow path through thick s\u00e1l coppice and timber; here and there an open glade is met with; but the first large bare plain is met with under the walls of K\u00e1mp. Here a few aged mango trees crown the high bank of the river, several old wells, the ruins of a temple, lastly the fort itself, buried in dense undergrowth and over-shaded by lofty pipal trees, occupy the space under the forest. The high ground then sinks precipitously beneath; the reaches bordering the river are covered with tamarisk for a breadth of several miles; but in the rains the Chauka's swollen current fills the whole channel up to the foot of the works, with a volume of water three miles broad. Beyond are the forests of Khairigarh, and above them the four ranges of the Himalayas, the last, covered with perpetual snow, rise tier above tier to the north.\n\nIt is not exactly clear what Chhipi Khan's domain included, because the Sayyads of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, who will presently be again referred to, must almost certainly have come in collision with him and probably driven him to K\u00e1mp. Here he was besieged by the Chauh\u00e1n Chief Chitrugupt, who had come from R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, and under the Emperor \u00c1lamg\u00edr's orders attacked Chhipi Kh\u00e1n, who had become turbulent. The royal forces took ground between the fort and the river, and blockaded not only the fort but also a redoubt a mile to the west, which was defended with masculine resolution by a dancing girl, Chhipi Kh\u00e1n's mistress. She collected stores, enabled her lover to hold out by secretly sending in supplies for the garrison maintaining her own possession and aiding him. At last after eighteen months' blockade, the imperial general managed to run a mine from the low\ngrounds into the interior of the fort, the troops broke in from this at night time, and put the sleeping garrison to the sword, killing Chhipi Khan. The usual supplies were that night being forwarded, but the porters who carried them found the fort in the enemy's possession. They fled back with the news, and this heroine of the forest hearing of her lover's death thrust a dagger into her heart. Chhipi Khan had eleven Hindu brothers; their descendants have degenerated to a set of bold and turbulent robbers, one of whom, Bhagwant Singh, distinguished himself much in later Oudh history, and his career is the last sketch from the Bichhil annals which has survived.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century the B\u00e9chhils had lost all their former prestige. The Jangre Chauhans had taken possession of Bhur to the north, the R\u00e1jas of Muhamdi succeeding to the Sayyads of Barwar, had driven them from the cis-Gumti parganas; while Sital Parshad, the terrible chakladar of Asif-ud-daula, was prepared to crush the chief of any old Chhattri clan who attempted to assert his claims to the leadership of the people.*\n\nAfter the death of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, Bhagwant Singh long crouched in a little fort on the western edge of the same great jungle on whose eastern border his ancestor Chhipi Khan had built K\u00e4mp. This was Atwa, about a mile from the Kathna, another of his ancestor's canal, and in P\u00e1ruh\u00e1r, where a third ancestor, as he believed, entertained the P\u00e1ndu heroes 3,600 years previously.\n\nWhen the great Muhamdi and Mitiali principalities had been broken up, and the reins of administration were relaxed, during the reigns of Nasir-ud-d\u00edn Haidar and Muhammad Ali Shah, there was nothing to hinder Bhagwant Singh against asserting his claims as a chief. He did it in the time-honoured Indian way by harrying the country and plundering all who would not recognize his ancient lordship of the soil and pay tribute.\n\nOne belt of land between the Kathna and the Gumti contained many good villages, all bordered by the strip of forest which extends down the banks of the former river: under its shelter the freebooter used to travel with his followers, and emerging from the thickets when he came opposite the residence of some wealthy banker would rob and torture him, probably carrying off the village cattle and the headman himself for ransom. At last he ventured down along the Kathna till its junction with the Gumti, and then crossing the latter river into the jungles of Gopamau and the lawless Bangar would carry his raids as far as Sandila, retreating to the friendly forest in case of pursuit by a powerful force. In 1841 Colonel Low issued special orders for the arrest of this dacoit as he was called, or descendant of a line of kings as he called himself. The chief, during the rainy season, thinking that the Government forces would not move out of cantonments, had taken up his quarters at Ahrori, then and now noted for the large numbers of P\u00e1s\u00eds, skilled in robbery of all kinds, who reside in the surrounding jungles. Captain Hollings marched from Nimkh\u00e1r on the 3rd\n\n* Sital Parshad used to cut off the breasts of captive Chhattri women lest they should suckle young rebels.\nJuly with three Companies of Infantry, reached the rebels' position at midnight, surprised and stormed their camp with trifling loss. The band fled, and the sepoys dispersed to collect the plunder. Unfortunately there was throughout this pargana, and every part of the Bangar, a confederacy for robbery which embraced all the able-bodied inhabitants of each village. This militia of banditti was prepared to help any member assailed, and to turn out on hearing a shot fired. It was called the goh\u00e1r. The contingents from several villages rapidly assembled on hearing the firing; they were accompanied by the Pasi bowmen, and assailed the dispersed sepoys from every side, firing upon them from behind the trees. They began to retire in disorder. The assailants were joined by a new band from every village they passed; all through the night they pressed upon the troops, and would have annihilated them had not a body of the special police of the Thuggiee and Dacoitee Department, which was engaged on duty in the neighbourhood, heard the firing and came to the rescue. The assailants then drew off having inflicted a loss of fifteen killed and wounded.\n\nA few months afterwards the owner of this very village Ahrori, who had bravely defended Bhagwant Singh on this occasion, invited him to his house, treacherously cut off his head, and sent it to the Governor Farid-ud-din with an apology, for having by mistake attacked Captain Hollings' detachment.\n\nThe widow of Bhagwant Singh\u2014he left no children\u2014now lives in a little hut under the ruins of her husband's fort. She has been decreed by the English courts a right to the adjoining hamlet of Atwa, with about 100 acres of cultivated land; and this is the humble ending of the lofty line which asserts for itself a royal genealogy above 100 generations old; and that its first famous ancestor entertained the five Pandus at the dawn of oriental civilization, nearly 2,000 years before our era.\n\nThe Sayyads.\u2014The great Sayyad family must now be treated of, although in point of time their connexion with the pargana of Barwar and this district commenced long before the events last narrated.\n\nAlim-ud-din, the eleventh son of Sayyad Kam\u00e1l of Kaithal in Saharanpur, is alleged to have settled in Kanauj in the reign of Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. More probably in the reign of F\u00edroz Shah Khilji, or Muhammad Tughlaq Shah, many of whose achievements have been popularly ascribed to Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. See Khairigarh article. At any rate as only eight generations elapsed between Alim-ud-din and his descendant Abdul Ghaffar, a contemporary of Humayun's (1531-1554 A.D.), it is clear that the former could not have lived in Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori's time, 1242-1246 A.D. We are told also that Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn conquered Kanauj. It is probable, therefore, that he accompanied the tyrant Muhammad Tughlaq when he sacked Kanauj, 1342 A.D., a date with which the family-tree would correspond.\n\nFor eight generations the Sayyad family held the post of q\u00e1zi in Kanauj, and at the date of the battle of Bilgr\u00e1m, near Kanauj, 1540 A.D., Abdul Ghaffar was q\u00e1zi. He had a younger brother Abdul Muqtad. After Humayun was expelled by Sher Shah, and took refuge with Shai. Tuhm\u00e1sip of Persia, it is alleged that the latter called on Sher Shah to\nstate why he usurped the throne which belonged properly to the Mughal. Sher Shah in return collected various statements from nobles of India proving that Humayun was not a true believer. Abdul Ghaffar was required to send a similar statement. He refused to do so, and to escape Sher Shah's vengeance he left Kanauj, and concealed himself in the jungles on the opposite side of the Ganges, where Pihani now stands. In 1555 Humayun returned, and Abdul Ghaffar from his hiding place sent a letter of congratulation. Humayun gave him five villages rent-free in parganas Pasgawan and Pindarwa,* also 5,000 bighas of the jungle in which he had found shelter. This spot was therefore called Pihani\u2014Pinhani meaning concealment,\u2014and a town founded in the forest clearing.\n\nGhafur Alam was the son of Abdul Muqtadi. He was sent to the Qazi-ul-Quzzat of Delhi as a pupil. He made great progress, and was brought before the Emperor Akbar, who made him tutor to Jahangir, and was so pleased with the latter's success in his studies, that he entitled his preceptor Nawab Sadr Jah\u00e1n, and made him sadr or chief mufti of the empire. It is possible, however, that this promotion was due to Sadr Jah\u00e1n's conversion to the new religion of which Akbar was the high priest, and into which Sadr Jah\u00e1n led his two sons.+ Of him Budaoni says:\n\n\"During the Muharram of 1004 A.H., Sadr Jah\u00e1n, mufti of the empire, who had been promoted to a commandiership of one thousand, joined the divine faith, as did also his two over-ambitious sons, and having taken the Shait of the new religion, he ran into the net like a fish, and got his hazarship. He even asked his majesty what he was to do with his bread, when he was told to let it be.\"\n\nThe Sadr was the fourth officer in the empire. He was the highest law officer. He was administrator-general and inquisitor into religious opinion. Sadr Jah\u00e1n continued to serve under Jahangir\u2014a proof, if any was needed, that the latter emperor shared the free-thinking views of his father, or he would never have allowed the official guardianship of the purity of the faith to be held by a pervert. Sadr Jah\u00e1n is stated by Jahangir in his memoirs to have prayed beside the bedside of the dying Akbar; but this is probably a fancy sketch drawn by filial piety; it possibly has its origin in fact, and may be given here, introducing as it does a great Oudh noble.\n\n\"On his arrival I placed Sadr Jah\u00e1n on both knees by my father's side, and he commenced reciting the creed of the faithful. At this crisis my father desiring me to draw near threw his arms about my neck, and addressed me in the following terms:\n\n'My dear boy (baba), take this my last farewell, for here we never meet again. Beware that thou dost not withdraw thy protecting regards from the secluded in my harem; that thou continue the same allowance for subsistence as was allotted by myself. Although my departure must cast a heavy burden upon thy mind, let not the words that are past be at once forgotten. Many a vow and many a covenant have been exchanged\n\n* Mastipur in Pasgawan Barkherwa and Narukhera in Pindarwa, Basara in Alampagar.\n\u2020 Blochman's Ain-i-kbari, pages 209, 209.\nbetween us; break not the pledge which thou hast given me; forget it not. Beware! Many are the claims which I have upon thy soul. Be they great or be they small, do not thou forget them. Call to thy remembrance my deeds of martial glory. Forget not the exertions of that bounty which distributed so many a jewel to my servants and dependants. When I am gone, do not thou forget me, nor the afflicted in the hour of need. Ponder word for word on all that I have said; do thou bear all in mind, and again, forget me not.'\n\n\"After expressing himself as above, he directed Sadr Jahan once more to repeat the Kelmah, and he recited the solemn text himself with a voice equally loud and distinct. He then desired the Sadr to continue repeating by his pillow the sourah neish, and another chapter of the Koran, together with the adeilah prayer, in order that he might be enabled to render up his soul with as little struggle as possible. Accordingly Sadr Jahan had finished the sourah neish, and had the last words of the prayer on his lips, when with no other symptom than a tear drop in the corner of his eye, my noble father resigned his soul into the hands of his Creator.\"\n\nSadr Jah\u00e1n's tomb is in Pih\u00e1n\u00ed: it was completed in 1651 A.D. His descendants held high office under the Mughal emperors. Like his masters, Akbar and Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, he had married Hindu wives; by one of whom, P\u00e1rbati, a Brahmani, he had Murt\u00e1z\u00e1 Khan and Irtiza Khan. Murt\u00e1z\u00e1 Khan was faujdar of Gopamau,* and Irtiza Khan held the more important charge of the Rantambhaur fort. Badr Jah\u00e1n, another son, held both Barwar and Kheri in rent-free tenure. Of this fact there can be no doubt. Not only do the family archives confirm it, but it is admitted by the present owners of Kheri, who have risen on the ruins of this great principality stretching from the Ganges to the Gogra. The estate must have been broken up before 1707 A.D., the date of a t\u00e1m\u00e1r or rent-roll of pargana Kheri, when it had been brought on to the revenue-paying register.\n\nAfter the death of Chhippi Khan, already mentioned, the management of Barwar was entrusted to Muqtadi Khan, grandson of Murt\u00e1z\u00e1 Khan. He proceeded to Barwar, and built a large quadrangular fort there on the ruins of a Bhar or B\u00e1chhil stronghold of older date. He greatly enlarged the estate during the reign of Alamg\u00edr. He kept the Ahban R\u00e1ja of Mitauli, a Hindu, in prison for twelve years, pressing him to sign a deed of sale of estate in his favour. B\u00e1z Khan, Ahban of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, who belonged to the Musalman branch of the family, was summoned to Delhi by the Emperor Aurangzeb to give security for the revenue due on his estate. The Ahban, a rural magnate, unfamiliar with the ways of courts, applied to his more polished neighbour, the Sayyad of Barwar, for advice. The latter promised himself to be security, and the pair travelled together to Delhi. Arrived there, the crafty Sayyad made excuses for not immediately furnishing the security. The imperial officials threatened the Ahban with imprisonment, the Sayyad insidiously advised him to abscond for a short time till he could complete arrangements which would satisfy the revenue\n\n* Shah Jah\u00e1n's farman, 1650 A.H.\nauthorities. The lord of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra fled from Delhi, and his friend applied for and received the estate which had belonged to the absentee. The usurper held it for generations. He was an able and active man. He covered the estate with forts at Ahmadnagar, Kheri, Bel, Muhamdi, Si\u00e1thu, Muhammadabad, Barkh\u00e1r, and other places. He died about 1683 A.D., and was succeeded by Sayyad Khurr\u00e1m, who removed the family residence to Aurangabad, a more central position, as the estate now included Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra and Kheri, lying far east of Barwar. He died in 1709, and on his decease this overgrown barony was reduced by the severance of Kheri, which was restored to the original zamindars. And now occurs a romantic event in the annals of this house which resulted in the downfall of the family, and the elevation upon its ruins of a member of that very Ahban lineage which it had so treacherously and tyrannously robbed.\n\nD\u00e1n S\u00e1h was the Ahban chief of Badiag\u00e1on in Gopamau of the Hardoi district. He had married his daughter to a Sombansi, and her two sons, Badar Singh and Bah\u00e1dur Singh, were staying with their maternal grandfather in A.D. 1700. In that year Sayyad Khurr\u00e1m, who had bought up some claim upon a grove in Badiag\u00e1on on purpose to embroil himself with his weaker neighbour, attacked the village and murdered every one he found except the two boys whom he carried prisoners to Aurangabad. Bah\u00e1dur was released, but Badar Singh became a convert to Isl\u00e1m, was named Ib\u00e1dulla, married to a natural daughter of his patron, and being an able man was made general manager and leader of his troops.\n\nMuhammad Ali, the eldest son, succeeded Sayyad Khurr\u00e1m in 1709 A.D. He was the son of one wife. Another younger one was a Hindu mah\u00e1jan's daughter, whose affections Sayyad Khurr\u00e1m had secretly won, and who abandoned her religion and her father's house to marry her lover. The father complained, and Khurr\u00e1m had to purchase his consent with a lac of rupees\u2014a proof that Aurangzeb's bigotry did not interfere with the fair administration of justice. Her son, Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Khan, claimed a share in the estate, instigated by his mother and by Ib\u00e1dulla Khan, who being also a Hindu by blood made common cause with her. The estate was at once filled with tumult and disorder, the brothers at open war, and each harrying whatever villages took part with or paid revenue to his opponent. No revenue could be collected, and Muhammad Ali, thinking that the old dowager, who had instigated the rebellion, and who was the mistress of great hoards which she had accumulated, should contribute to its expenses, confined her in a small hotroom till she should pay up, meanwhile dismissing her ally Ib\u00e1dulla.\n\nThe latter came at night, dug through the wall of the lady's prison, released her, and the two, along with her son, fled to Delhi (1726 A.D.) They applied to the Emperor Muhammad Shah, and with the aid of the Subahdar of Oudh, Sa\u00e1dat Khan,* the estate was given to Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn Khan, after two years' solicitation and heavy expenditure. While the old lady lived, Ib\u00e1dulla, seemingly influenced by their common nationality, was faithful to her interests, but she died in 1729 A.D. Then Ib\u00e1d-\n\n* \"Brigg's Sair-ul-Muta-akhirin.\"\nulla secured the favour of R\u00e1ja Newal R\u00e1e, the Oudh d\u00edw\u00e1n, by assenting to the latter's getting Barkh\u00e1r in Muhamdi pargana as j\u00e1g\u00edr; and Newal R\u00e1e aided him to gain possession of the entire estate, ousting the sons of Sayyad Khurram, whose descendant, Nashigar Ali, now holds six villages in Aurangabad and Pasgawan. Ib\u00e1dulla did not wish to remain in Aurangabad, the scene of his treachery. He removed to Muhamdi, where he enlarged and strengthened the fort so that it was able to offer a show of resistance to a British army.* He had obtained from Delhi the title of R\u00e1ja and of Khan.\n\nIb\u00e1dulla Khan died in 1737 A.D.; his son and successor Mahb\u00fab Ali Khan in 1742; the latter's brother in 1752; and a son of Mahb\u00fab Ali Khan, Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad, succeeded. During this time the great estate, still including Muhamdi, Aurangabad, Magdapur, Barwar, Pasgawan, Aliganj, Haidarabad, Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed, Karanpur, Alamnagar, was undivided. Ali Akbar Khan, the third and last surviving son of Badar Singh, was enraged that his nephew, a mere boy, should be preferred to him. It was the custom of the Chhattri brotherhood, to which his father originally belonged, that the brother should succeed if an adult and able in mind and body to the headship of the family, rather than the minor son, who would be incompetent for the charge. The uncle now complained to the Sombansi kinsmen, who had been settled by successive r\u00e1jas in the pargana of Muhamdi. Some of these men, who lived in Waini Rajapur, a large village three miles north of Muhamdi, listened to the crafty uncle's appeals to their zeal for ancient Hindu custom. They came at night and murdered the nephew in the fort at Muhamdi (1757 A.D.).\n\nAgain did a widow appear in the dark scene, the mother of the murdered prince; but instead of flying to Lucknow, she collected forces and defeated \u00c1li Akbar Khan in the field. The Hindu party and the Musalm\u00e1n purists now came to terms, and arranged a peaceful line of succession\u2014namely, that Ali Akbar Khan should manage the estate during his life, and that Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Khan should succeed. Extraordinary to relate, in 1772, Ali Akbar Khan, of his own accord, abandoned the chiefship and power, which he had held for fifteen years, and, according to promise, transferred the property to Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Khan. The uncle survived for five years after his abdication.\n\nDuring his tenure of the r\u00e1j foreign invasion had almost put an end to the existence of the family. The Gours of Katesar and Chandra, a bold and turbulent clan (see L\u00e1harpur and Dhaurahra), had overthrown the great r\u00e1j of Mitauli, and caused its occupants to skulk for fifteen years in the jungle at Pais\u00e1r on the Kauri\u00e1la; they had fought and beaten the N\u00e1zim of Khairabad, had driven out the Chauh\u00e1ns from Sa\u00e1datnagar, and had gradually spread since their first arrival in Oudh (1653 A.D.), till they now pressed upon the great Muhamd\u00ed r\u00e1j, all along its southern border in Pasgawan and Alamnagar. About 1180 A.H. (A.D. 1766), they rushed to the attack, rightly judging that the R\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, supported by hired levies alone, would be no match for the fierce bands of\n\n* Ball's History of Mutinies, II., page 338.\nChhattirs united at once by common interest and a common origin, by one blood and one faith\u2014\n\n\"One past of old renown.\"\n\nAli Akbar Khan was defeated in the first battle. He appealed to the Nawab of Fatehgarh, Ahmad Khan Bangash, who had left a great name as a warrior throughout the middle half of the eighteenth century. Aid was sent, and Ali Akbar, coming from Fatehgarh with his allies, again fought the Gaurs near Maikalganj on the road from Sitapur to Shahjahanpur. The gathering of the north Oudh clans in this great struggle of Musalman against Hindu was such that the ground was covered thick with elephants' ordure, and on the space so fertilized a village rose, still existing, which from the circumstance was named Lidi\u00e1na. Again the Gaurs won. R\u00e1ja and Nawab had no chance against the free men of the Chhattiri commonwealth. Ali Akbar fled northwards towards Pilibhit where he begged aid from the Rohillas of the Du\u00e1b. This race was then in the height of their prosperity. Five years previously they had fought on the victorious side with Ahmad Shah, Daur\u00e1ni, at Panipat, and crushed the great Hindu revival of the Mahrattas south of the Ganges. They were not likely to look on quietly while a Chhattiri clan mastered all north Oudh, soon to carry the war doubtless into the borders of Rohilkhand.\n\nThey joined the R\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, and fought the Gaurs at the town of Mail\u00e1ni, in one of those open clearings surrounded on every side by many miles of the densest forest which are common in this part of Oudh. The Gaurs were defeated; but they withdrew at once into the woods which covered their rear, and rendered pursuit impossible without the aid of artillery. The Rohillas replaced Ali Akbar Khan in the r\u00e1j of Muhamdi, and seized for themselves Khairigarh and Dhaurahra, which they soon abandoned. This raid of theirs, however, was long remembered in Oudh, as they mutilated every image and defiled every temple they met on the march. Ali Akbar Khan is said to have oppressed the legitimate Sayyad descendants of Khurrum, but the only instance of oppression related is, that in one of his raids having captured an exquisitely beautiful K\u00e1chhi girl belonging to the Sudra tribe, he gave her in marriage to Naj\u00e1bat Ali, a Sayyad of pure blood, at the latter's earnest request. He thereby contaminated the spotless blood which as yet had only mixed with Brahmans and Chhattirs. Ali Akbar Khan had ten sons by many wives, but most of them died childless.\n\nGhul\u00e1m Nabi Khan who succeeded in 1189 A.H. (A.D. 1775), was a revenue defaulter\u2014that is to say, that he paid a great deal less money than the Government of Lucknow would like to have received. True, his ancestors had done just the same, and had paid a merely nominal tribute; but things had now changed. The Nawab of Oudh had allied himself with the British, had just beaten the Rohillas, and was now, with the aid of English troops, crushing all opposition from among the ancient nobles of the country.\n\nR\u00e1ja S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d and Ism\u00e1il Beg moved out against Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Khan. The latter could make no resistance, was taken prisoner to Luck-\nnow, and died in 1206 A.H. (1792 A.D.). In 1193 A.H. (A.D. 1779), Mansa R\u00e1m, the chakladar, arrived at Muhamdi to make the first settlement. The family and relatives of the r\u00e1ja were provided for with small grants of money or land throughout the estate; they got in all sixteen villages out of more than 900 which had been included in the r\u00e1j. The rest of it was settled with the muqaddams and military retainers of the Sayyad family. In Atwa Piparia and Magdapur many villages, including ultimately the whole of the former pargana, were given to the B\u00e1chhils, the old zamindars. In Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, including Haidarabad, Aliganj, Karanpur, Kukra Mail\u00e1ni, engagements were taken from the Ahban proprietors, from the q\u00e1n\u00fangos of Aliganj, and from Kurmi fraternities, who had been settled in M\u00e1mri and adjacent villages a century before by the Sayyads, or who were invited in by Mansa R\u00e1m himself; the latter form much the larger portion. Some Brahmins of Isl\u00e1mabad in Muhamdi, and of Basthauli in Magdapur, claim an earlier and independent descent, but on the whole there is little doubt that this great estate was a true taluqa in the proper sense of the word,\u2014that is to say, that the country was seized by a great noble; that its inhabitants were either killed or reduced to pure villenage, without any rights in the soil, that no such rights grew up by the division of the estate or by sub-infeudations to military retainers.\n\nThe result of this state of things was political weakness, nay absolute prostration, chronic tumult, and devastation of the country. There was an absence of all independence, of all relations save those of master and slave, degrading and enervating both. The r\u00e1j had no internal strength, no principle of cohesion; the people as long as they were well governed had doubtless some considerable pride in the greatness and grandeur of their master; they delighted to tell of the number of his elephants, of his cannon, and of his troops; how many thousand guests had been entertained at his wedding. But this source of loyalty was a feeble one, and further, could only arise where the r\u00e1ja was in the habit of making public progresses through his territory, and exhibiting to his subjects the glitter and pomp which was all they got for their money.\n\nThe Muhamdi r\u00e1jas performed no such popular duties; they were not bigoted Musalmans; they mingled too largely with their Hindu brethren and with Hindu women of all castes to retain much fervour for the faith of Isl\u00e1m. Only one small mosque throughout their immense dominions was erected by any of the family in which for many generations were deposited all the wealth and power of a territory equal in size to the country of York. Several rivers intersect their broad lands, but not a bridge was ever built by them. All along the Gumti are high sandy plateaus covered with drifting sands, which only require water to grow green with barley or maize, but no tank or well was constructed for any such humane purpose by the lords of Muhamdi. They built nothing but brick forts, girt with deep ditches and towering turrets, to protect themselves and their servants against an oppressed people. They left no signs on earth save such as signified war with their kind.\n\nTwelve years elapsed after the Muhamdi r\u00e1j had been overturned before anyone showed any wish for its restoration; then Z\u00e1hid Ali Khan\nand W\u00e1hid Ali, sons of Ghul\u00e1m Nabi Khan, raised a small revolt, but the chakladar, without troubling himself in the matter, simply directed the old zamindars now restored to reduce them. Abdulla Khan, Ahban of Jal\u00e1lpur, attacked them in the village of Parid\u00edh, pargana Kasta, and all the chiefs on both sides were killed. Five villages were awarded as a rent-free tenure to the Jal\u00e1lpur family as a reward for the bravery shown by its head. Two more sons of Ghul\u00e1m Nabi now raised another disturbance, but they were seized by Hak\u00edm Mehndi, chakladar of Muhamdi, from 1804 (1219 A.H.), and sent in chains to Lucknow.* Again a widow came upon the stage. The mother of the prisoners proceeded towards Lucknow to intercede for her sons. Hak\u00edm Mehndi sent for her and arranged for the release of one son, Am\u00e1n Ali Khan, who swore on the Koran that he would raise no disturbance, and was then granted a small estate. When Hak\u00edm Mehndi was deprived of the chakladarship in 1820 (1236 A.H.), he signed a certificate that Am\u00e1n Ali Khan had always got two rupees from each village in the old dominions of the family as tribute, and the new chakladar Param Dhan admitted the claim. Am\u00e1n Ali Khan died in 1837 (1253 A.H.), his son Ashraf Ali Khan succeeded.\n\nIn 1850, or seven years before annexation, he held only the six villages which had been originally granted by Hak\u00edm Mehndi, and if the English had then occupied the country, there would have been no trace except dim tradition of the great Muhamdi r\u00e1j; but in 1851 the weakness of the Lucknow revenue system caused a number of villages to be handed over to taluqdars, and Ashraf Ali Khan engaged as a mere farmer for fifty-five. These he held for five years longer till annexation, and a perpetual sanad from the British Government has now secured him in their absolute possession.\n\nThe converted Sombansi family acquired the estate by a simple act of fraud and usurpation, in 1734 (1147 A.H.). It held it till 1776 (1190 A.H.), just forty-three years; it was then dispossessed by the Oudh Government for rebellion. For 78 years (till 1851) it had no concern with the estate in which many other persons acquired in the interval rights recognized by the law. Many jungles were brought under the plough by laborious Kurmis and P\u00e1s\u00eds; many industrious tenants were settled at great expense by enterprising Brahmans and Bani\u00e1ns. Again, the r\u00e1ja held for five years; and fortunately for him in that brief space the country became British territory, and he was made, to his utter astonishment, the proprietor of a large estate.\n\nAs an evidence of what value this r\u00e1ja placed upon his own rights, it may be mentioned that just before annexation Fida Husen khan, the chakladar's brother, probably having secret intelligence that the days of the Oudh Government were numbered, wished to obtain some titular claim as a proprietor over the estate which he already held as a collector of Government revenue, he applied to the R\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, who executed a deed transferring all his rights in the pargana of Atwa Piparia contain-\n\n* Sleeman's Oudh, II., page 74.\ning 64 square miles, and which had yielded Rs. 25,000, for a silver-belted sword*. This occurred in 1855, two years before annexation; Fida Husen Khan did not hold as a proprietor at all, nevertheless he got his name recorded as the owner, and it is now his inalienable property.\n\nAshraf Ali Khan died in 1867, and was succeeded by his son Musharraf Ali Khan, who being heavily embarrassed has placed his estate under the Court of Wards to be relieved from its incumbrances.\n\nThe Ahbans.\u2014So far I have only given the annals of the old pargana (Barwar), corresponding now to the tahsil of Muhamdi, and forming the western portion of Kheri. A settlement almost as old as that of the B\u00e1chhils was established by the Ahbans of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra and N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, which old parganas are now broken up into Haidarabad, Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed, Paila, Bh\u00far, Pasgawan, besides Misrikh, Maholi, and others in Sitapur.\n\nThis tract, which occupies the very centre of the district of Kheri, lies south of the river Ul between the Kathna on the west and the Jamw\u00e1ri on the east, and on the south is bounded by an artificial line separating it from parganas Kasta and Kheri. It is a fertile but rather marshy tract through which several sluggish streams take their course. Towards the north Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed is yet covered largely with forest which also comes down in strips along the banks of the Kathna throughout the whole extent of this ancient pargana.\n\nIt is said to have been originally peopled by P\u00e1s\u00eds whose leader (Bh\u00farw\u00e1) showed the Emperor Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn good sport, and was granted the territory with permission to call it Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra after his own name. They gave place to the Ahban Chhattris who claim a long descent in Oudh, such as no other clan can rival or approach.\n\nTheir first ancestors in Oudh are stated to have been Gopi and Sopi, two brothers of the Ch\u00e1war race, which ruled in Anhalw\u00e1ra P\u00e1tan in Gujar\u00e1t. This tribe\u2020 is described by Tod as follows:\n\n\"Chawura or Chaura.\u2014This tribe was once renowned in the history of India, though its name is now scarcely known or only in the chronicles of the bard. Of its origin we are in ignorance. It belongs neither to the Solar nor Lunar race, and consequently we may presume it to be of Scythic origin. The name is unknown in Hindustan, and is confined, with many others originating from beyond the Indus, to the Peninsula of Saurashtra. If foreign to India proper, its establishment must have been at a remote period, as we find individuals of it intermarrying with the Sooryavansa ancestry of the present princes of Mewar, when this family were the lords of Balabhi.\n\n\"The capital of the Chawuras was the insular Deobunder on the coast of Saurashtra, and the celebrated temple of Somnath, with many others on this coast, dedicated to Balnath, or the sun, is attributed to this tribe\n\n* Sleeman's Tour in Oudh, II., page 79.\n\u2020 \"Rajasthan,\" Vol. I., page 101.\nof the Sauras, or worshippers of the sun, most probably the generic name of the tribe as well as of the peninsula.\n\n\"By a natural catastrophe, or as the Hindu superstitious chroniclers will have it as a punishment for the piracies of the prince of Deo, the element whose privilege he abused rose and overwhelmed his capital.\n\n\"At all events, the prince of Deo laid the foundation of Anhalwara Patan in Samvat 802 (A.D. 746), which henceforth became the capital city of this portion of India in lieu of Balabhipoora, which gave the title of Balicaraes to its princes, the Balhara of the earlier Arabian travellers, and following them, the geographers of Europe.\n\n\"This ancient connexion between the Sooryavansi chiefs and the Chawuras or Sauras, of Saurashtra, is still maintained after a lapse of more than one thousand years; for although an alliance with the Rana's family is deemed the highest honour that a Hindu prince can obtain, as being the first in rank in Rajasthan, yet is the humble Chawura sought out, even at the foot of fortune's ladder, whence to carry on the blood of Rama. The present heir apparent of a line of one hundred kings, the prince Javana Singh, is the offspring of a Chawura mother, the daughter of a petty chieftain of Guzerat.\"\n\nLocal tradition declares that the inroads of the Musalmans compelled these brothers to leave their country and seek a refuge further east. The dates do not correspond with this. Muhammad Qasim, the leader of the first great Musalman invasion, captured Alor, 712 A.D. (93 A.H.); from thence he spread his forces north and south. Deo or Deobunder was then the capital of the Chawars; they very probably abandoned it shortly after Qasim's inroad, as they established the great Sah dynasty of Anhalwara Patan in Saurashtra, which lasted from 746 to 931 A.D. Now between Sopi and the members of the family now living seventy-six generations intervene, according to the more reliable genealogical tree furnished by the Musalman branch of the family, the Hindu branch entering 94 as the number of generations. This discrepancy, of course, throws doubt upon both, but even seventy-six generations, allowing 22 years to each, would carry us back 1670 years or to 200 A.D. At this date the city of Anhalwara Patan did not exist, or at any rate the Chawars had nothing to say to it. But as already remarked, tradition is very apt to confuse the events which occurred in different ages to the same family. Even if the exiles had abandoned the country of their forefathers before the nation settled in Anhalwara Patan, still an occasional intercourse with those who remained behind would serve to familiarize them with the new residence of their kindred, while they would naturally be fond and proud of claiming a connexion with the great Balhara race, the supreme monarchs of India, which reigned from Cambay to China. I am disposed to believe confidently in the general accuracy of the statement that the Ahbans are Chawars and did come from Saurashtra; very possibly there were two emigrations\u2014one in early times from Deobander, another from Anhalwara. After the overturn of the Chawar dynasty (932 A.D.*)\n\n*Tod's Western India.\nof conquest and slaughter swept over the city from its foundation in 1746 to 1298, when Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, last and bloodiest of it; destroyers, levelled every building with the ground. What more natural than that those who fled from each convulsion should follow the path traced out for them by the earlier emigrants, and seek a quiet home among their kindred in the far forests of Oudh. Natural pride would lead them to dwell fondly on the great capital of India fifteen miles in circuit, with its eighty-four squares and eighty-four bazars,* yielding Rs. 5,000 daily in excise duties, on the world famous temple of Somn\u00e1th and all the glories of the Balhara kings; they would then easily forget that the earliest emigration was not from Anhalw\u00e1ra, but from a more obscure place. It is worth while to contrast what the Ch\u00e1war race are alleged to have done during the two hundred years they held Anhalw\u00e1ra and the fifteen hundred years during which they held a large portion of Oudh. The following are extracts from Tod's Western India:\n\n\"Anhalpoor was twelve coss (or fifteen miles) in circuit, within which were many temples and colleges; eighty-four chaoks, or squares; eighty-four bazars or market-places, with mints for gold and silver coins. Each class had its separate mohilla or quarter, as had each description of merchandise\u2014i.e., hati-dant, or elephants' teeth, silks, purples, diamonds, pearls, &c. &c., each had its separate chaok. There was one bazaar for shrafs, or money-changers; one for perfumes and unguents; one for physicians; one for artizans; one for goldsmiths, and another for silversmiths; there were distinct mohillas for navigators, for bards, and for genealogists. The eighteen burrun or castes inhabited the city. All were happy together. The place groaned with a multitude of separate buildings for the armoury, for elephants, horses, and chariots, for the public accountants and officers of state. Each kind of goods had its separate mandavie or mart, where the duties of export, import, and sale were collected: as for spices, fruits, drugs, camphor, metals, and everything costly of home or foreign growth. It was a place of universal commerce. The daily amounts of duties was one lac of takhas. If you ask for water, they give you milk. There are many Jain temples, and on the banks of a lake is a shrine to Schedlinga Mahadeo.\n\n\"This Balhara is the most illustrious prince in all the Indies, and all the other kings there, though each is master and independent in his kingdom, acknowledge in him this prerogative and pre-eminence. When he sends ambassadors to them, they received them with extraordinary honours, because of the respect they bear him. This king makes magnificent presents, after the manner of the Arabs, and has horses and elephants in very great numbers and great treasures in money. He has of those pieces of silver, Tartarian drachmas, which weigh half a drachm more than the Arabesque drachm. They are coined with the die of the prince, and bear the year of his reign from the last of his predecessor. They compute not their years from the era of Mahomed, as do the Arabs, but only by the years of their kings. Most of these princes have lived a long time, and many of them have reigned above fifty years; and those of the country\n\n* Tod's Western India, 156.\nbelieve that the length of their lives and of their reigns is granted them in recompense for their kindness to the Arabs. In truth, there are no princes more heartily affectionate to the Arabs, and their subjects profess the same friendship for us.\n\n\"Before we abandon the arch of Anhalwara to time and the Guicowar we may ask,\u2014how has this escaped the general ruin? We can find no motive but its intrinsic beauty to account for its solitary towers, with the pure Hindu kankras and embattled parapets being untouched by Hindu and Toork. I have already said that there remain only the skeleton ribs from the spring to the apex, without a particle of loading; the pilasters supporting these ribs have lost nothing of their perpendicularity, and they are as firmly rivetted to the masonry which supports them as on the day of erection. They are chaste and well proportioned to the arch, and the capitals are purely Hindu, being ornamented with chain festoons, having the vira-gantha or war-bell, the most ancient and general decoration of the columnar architecture of the Jains (of which faith were the Balharas), suspended by a chain between each festoon, like the columns at Barolli. On each side and about half way up the segment of the arch is the lotus.\n\n\"We proceed to the other object of interest, the pothi-bindur or library, the existence of which was totally unknown until my visit to it. It is contained in subterranean apartments in that quarter of the new town which has appropriately received the name of Anhalwara. Its position screened it from the lynx-eyed scrutiny of Alla, when he destroyed all that was destructible in this ancient abode.\"\n\nWe learn that this race was then distinguished for its maritime enterprise, for its architecture, for the extent of its conquests, for its humanity; that it was the patron of learned men; that commerce found protection and encouragement from its excellent organization in matters of trade, coinage, and police; further, that its instincts were peaceful; it sought the welfare of its old subjects rather than the conquest of new lands; and to crown the glories which still glow through the past round Anhalwara and its kings, a great library was founded, and such care was taken for its preservation, with such religious devotion was it regarded by the caste to whom its peculiar care was wisely committed, that even now after the lapse of a thousand years, its treasures are found safely stored in caves beneath the earth; they have survived alike the march of time and the attacks of the fierce barbarian Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Khilji, who ploughed over the prostrate city-site with asses.\n\nWhat are the Ch\u00e1wars now? For one thousand years not a single man from their body has risen to distinction except one R\u00e1ja Lone Singh, who was finally transported for life. The peasant points to no bridge or temple as proof that any single man in their many generations ever cared for the people or the country where he ruled. In fact, they pretend that an ancient sage pronounced a curse upon any of their number who should ever place two bricks together in any building or well. They are illiterate in the extreme; even family pride has not kept alive any interest in the past; not\none of them can state correctly even his three or four immediate predecessors; annually a bard comes from the ancient city of their kings in Saurashtra, makes his rounds among them, and recites to dull or sleeping audiences annals which should thrill them with pride. The Ahbans are in fine now more bigoted, more deeply plunged in debt, more superstitious, void of enterprise, and uneducated, than the average Hindu peasant in similar circumstances. They are noteworthy for their willingness to deceive, and the ease with which they are deceived themselves is equally notorious; and their history presents too many instances of cunning and treachery combined with Boeotian sluggishness and stolidity. Their ill-luck has become proverbial, and it seems to arise from the fact that they always hesitated about taking sides in civil wars till the contest was almost decided and then took the wrong one. Raja Man Singh, after the battle of Buxar, having delayed to join his sovereign till it was too late, presumed to oppose the march of the victorious English with his raw levies. The raja appeared at the head of his warriors swathed in the huge pajamas or sleeping drawers which are worn in the zanana. At the first charge his troops fled headed by the raja; the latter tumbled from his horse. He was unable to rise being entangled in the cumbrous folds of his dress, and a British soldier transfixed him with a bayonet as he lay on his stomach.\n\nThe chief of Kukra, Ali Bakhsh Khan, who had built himself a castle in a dismal swamp six miles north of Gola, did not wish to pay land tax to Government, and endeavoured to secure that object by murdering in their beds a number of Government surveyors whom he had received with pretended hospitality. But for treachery, cruelty, and suicidal folly combined, Raja Lone Singh claims the pre-eminence. His treatment of the English refugees from Shahjahanpur was in some respects the blackest instance of wickedness and ingratitude which the mutiny presents.\n\nBut the few events in the obscure annals of this family must now be detailed. It was thought instructive to collocate before the reader accounts of the past and present state of this race. Gopi is alleged to have founded the town of Gopamau, to have held the pargana of that name, to have married the daughter of some raja of Kanauj, and to have received forty-two villages as her dowry. His descendants still hold considerable property in Bhainsari and neighbouring villages.\n\nSopi, the second brother, settled first in the village of Bhurwara which lies two miles north-east of Gola Gokaranath. He conquered the country subduing the Rajpasis, whose dominions then extended from Sandila to Dhaurahra, and preferred claims to be lords of the soil even in Humayun's time, one of whose sanads is still extant declaring that they had not proved their title. Raja Nirajdeo, eighth in descent from Sopi, settled in the town of Pataunja, three miles west of Misrikh, in the Sitapur district. It is reported that he was aided in all his affairs by a supernatural being called Ahbawan. He and the clan ever since bore the name of Ahban.\n\nFor twenty-six generations the family lived in Pataunja; then two brothers represented it, Alam Sah and Kunwar Sah. The latter left the old family castle and settled in Kunwar Danda in Khairabad, which town was founded by a Pasi Khaira, the servant of Bhim Sen, the Ahban raja of that\nday. After eighteen generations R\u00e1ja K\u00e1l\u00ed\u00e1n S\u00e1h is mentioned. He had two sons, Narsinghdeo and Jamni Bh\u00e1n. They quarrelled and divided the estate, the former keeping pargana N\u00edmkh\u00e1r and residing at Mitauli, the latter retiring to Kotw\u00e1ra, two miles south of Gola, close to Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, the old residence of his ancestors, and exercising authority over Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra.\n\nM\u00fal S\u00e1h was the son by a second wife of Khan Jah\u00e1n, fifth in descent from Jamni Bh\u00e1n. He was converted to Muhammadanism, and his descendants, it is alleged, acquired and retained possession of the whole pargana of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra containing 989 villages. K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r, nephew of Bahlol Lodi, was the missionary of Isl\u00e1m to whose persuasions M\u00fal S\u00e1h succumbed in A.D. 1488. Khan Jah\u00e1n had an elder son by his first wife. He was ousted as above related; but thirteen generations afterwards his descendants, Kesri Singh and others, were allowed to take leases of the B\u00e9ansi and other estates which they still hold in pargana Bh\u00far (Aliganj).\n\nSome dubious or contradictory points must now be cleared up. According to the above account then, when Akbar ascended the throne of Delhi, there were four families of Abbans holding estates that descended from Gopi in Gopamau; second, the offspring of Kunwar S\u00e1h, holding Kunwar Danda in Machhrehta; third, the main branch of the family, tracing from Narsinghdeo and lords of pargana N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, containing the six muh\u00e1ls of Sikandarabad, Maholi, Kasta \u00c1bg\u00e1o, N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, Misrikh; fourth, the Muhammadan branch residing at Kotw\u00e1ra and holding Aliganj, Haidarabad, Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed. The second may be dismissed with a short notice. R\u00e1ja Kesri Singh in the early part of Akbar's reign in a fit of passion killed his diw\u00e1n and was deprived of his estate, when the murdered man's sons appealed to the emperor. As for the third its present representatives produce sanads from Akbar, Shah Jah\u00e1n, Jah\u00e1ngir, reciting that they were the zamindars and r\u00e1jas of three parganas, Gopamau, N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, and Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra. These sanads, however, are almost certainly forgeries; the present members of the family admit that Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra was never their property since the separation and conversion to the Musalman faith of the younger branch. Now this conversion was certainly effected long before Akbar's time. Not only do tradition and history combine to affirm that K\u00e1l\u00e1 Pah\u00e1r converted these Abbans seventy years before Akbar's time; but the number of generations, seventeen, which have passed away since the change of religion and name, prove that the first convert must have lived in Bahlol Lodi's time or before it. Seventeen generations, allowing twenty-two years to each, will cover 374 years, and that period would carry us back to 1498, only ten years later than the recorded date of the conversion.\n\nFurther, there were two great chiefs among the Abbans. The Mitauli r\u00e1ja when pressed by the P\u00e1s\u00eds of Maholi (see history of that pargana), who wanted his daughter in marriage applied for aid to his relation, the Abb\u00e1n lord of Pataunja, and the two combined murdered the P\u00e1s\u00eds when drunk after a feast. Gopamau was held also by the Shekh Chaudhris from Hum\u00e1y\u00fan's time. Therefore the Mitauli r\u00e1ja could not have been actually the master of these parganas; and if he fraudulently obtained a deed recognizing his mere headship over the clans, why was not Machhrehta entered, at any rate in the first, as it belonged also to the Abbans. Fur-\nther, the several parganas which were formed out of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra and N\u00edmkh\u00e1r by Todar Mal in Akbar's reign, would doubtless have been entered in any sanads granted by his successors, but they are not even named in the documents referred to. Their wording is also most suspicious, and on the whole there is no reason to question the fact previously stated, that Nar-singhdeo's line held only N\u00edmkh\u00e1r and not Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra or Misrikh. The conclusive proof, however, that the Ahban r\u00e1j did not as represented in the sanads extend over these parganas is derived from the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, a contemporary record. There we find that \"various tribes\" were the zamindars of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra; that Paila was held by B\u00e1chhils, Gopamau by Ch\u00e1wars (Ahban) and B\u00e1chhils, N\u00edmkh\u00e1r by Ah\u00edrs. Now the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari is a record of the state of things as it existed in 993 A. H. (1586 A. D.); it shows no trace of Ahban proprietorship in three out of the four parganas; yet, according to these sanads, Ahbans were the exclusive lords of the soil during the three reigns of Akbar and his successors, who ruled from 1556 to 1658. It is apparent that the Ahbans really held at this time various demesnes scattered over the country in Gopamau and Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra.\n\nThe history of the Hindu branch of Mitauli is involved in many uncertainties, partly owing to the great stupidity of the family; but still some traditions are sufficiently clear to prove that the state of things recorded in these sanads could not have existed. On the one hand we are told that in 1670, Klamg\u00edr sent against the r\u00e1ja a Mughal, Mirza Bah\u00e1dur Beg, who compelled him to abandon Maholi, and reduced him to a few villages round Mitauli. On the other hand, one tradition states that M\u00e1n Singh held the pargana of Misrikh lying south of and beyond Maholi till his death, which took place, as is related above, after the battle of Buxar in 1764.\n\nIt is probable that the estate was then broken up, or at least that the r\u00e1ja ceased to exercise semi-regal power over the parganas Kasta, \u00c1bg\u00e1o\u0144, Maholi, N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, and Misrikh, if he ever did do so. But it is more probable that the fall of the Ahban r\u00e1j was due to the rise of the Gours. M\u00e1n Singh's death, fighting against the British, would rather have rendered the Oudh authorities friendly to the family; but four years afterwards in 1768, the Gours of Chandra pargana, who under Chandar Sen had entered Oudh in 1707, attacked the Ahbans and drove them from Maholi and Mitauli. Dal Singh was then the head of the family, he having survived M\u00e1n Singh. The Ahbans fled north, and at last took refuge in the village of Peis\u00e1r, about four miles east of Dhaurahra on the river Kauri\u00e1la, where they lay hid in the dense forests and wildernesses of lofty prairie grass, which still skirt the banks of this river. They stayed ten years, till the Gours, who had been defeated by the Sayyads in 1773, had to contract their operations and abandon Kheri, Maholi and Kasta \u00c1bg\u00e1o\u0144. Then the Ahbans returned and the property was equally divided as related by Sleeman. In 1821 (1237 A.H.) Param Dhan was chakladar, and R\u00e1e Singh the chief of the Ahbans, but possessing a very small portion of the landed property. Param Dhan had leased the chakla of Muhamdi from the Lucknow Government, bidding three lacs more than Hak\u00edm Mehndi. He was of course oppressing the zamindars, and extorting rack-rents from them in order to recoup himself. They had been kindly treated by Hak\u00edm Mehndi, the previous chakladar,\nwho had brought many of them into the country. They looked round for some one to protect them from the grasping Government, and the ancient lord of the soil seemed the most fitting person.\n\nThe chakladar was then encamped at Marauncha Gh\u00e1t on the Chauka. The zamindars laid their views before Khanjan Singh, R\u00e1\u00e9 Singh\u2019s eldest son. He stood up to his knees in the river, and swore on its sacred waters to the zamindars assembled on its banks that he would preserve their rights intact, and never extort from or oppress them. The zamindars then went before the chakladar and declined to take the leases which he offered. Khanjan Singh was given the lease for the three parganas Maholi, Kasta, and \u00c1bg\u00e1o at a reduced rate, and this advantage he shared proportionately among the zamindars, giving them sub-leases on more favourable terms than the chakladar had been offering. The growing power of this Ahban lord now rendered him formidable to all his neighbours. To the east his estates were bordered by pargana Paila which is alleged to have formerly been a portion of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, but at any rate had been separate from it since Akbar\u2019s time. It consisted of two estates, Paila proper, of 116 villages, held since 1838 by Th\u00e1kur Umr\u00e1o Singh of Mahewa, and Atwa Shankarpur, held since same date by Umr\u00e1o Singh of Oel, two Janw\u00e1r landowners and cousins of the R\u00e1ja of Kaimahra (see account of pargana Kheri). The former was acquired by R\u00e1ja Lone Singh in 1842, and the latter in 1851. The dispossessed Janw\u00e1rs gathered their forces and defeated Lone Singh in the first battle, capturing two of his cannons, but they were unable to recover the territory lost.\n\nLone Singh acquired the estate of Kukra Mail\u00e1ni in 1851 from an old widow lady who was then confined in his castle. Similarly he about the same time acquired many villages in Haidarabad, Karanpur, Aliganj parganas. Pareli for instance was a large village paying Rs. 2,000 revenue; the Government collector demanded Rs. 3,000; the owners could not pay this sum; all their bullocks and stock were sold, and the lands became waste, Lone Singh then offered Rs. 1,000 and got the village put into his estate. Similarly he acquired M\u00e1mri in Haidarabad, and even several villages in Magdapur on the bank of the Gumti. Sleeman now writes of him as follows:\n\n\u201cLone Singh, who visited me yesterday afternoon, with a respectable train, has in this, and other ways less creditable, increased his estate of Mithouli from a rent-roll of forty to one of one hundred and fifty thousand rupees a year, out of which he pays fifty thousand to Government, and he is considered one of its best subjects. He is, as above stated, of the Ahban Rajpoot clan, and a shrewd and energetic man. The estate was divided into six shares. It had formed one under Rajah Davey Singh, whose only brother, Bhujun Singh, lived united with him, and took what he chose to give him for his own subsistence and that of his family. Davey Singh died without issue, leaving the whole estate to his brother, Bhujun Singh, who had two sons, Dul Singh and M\u00e1n Singh, among whom he divided the estate. Dul Singh had six sons but M\u00e1n Singh had none. He, however, adopted Bhowani Singh, to whom he left his portion of the estate. Dul Singh\u2019s share became subdivided among his six sons; but Khunjun Sing, the son of his eldest son, when he became head of the family, got together a large force, with some guns, and made use of it in the usual way\nby seizing upon the lands of his weaker neighbours. He attacked his nephew, Bhowani Singh, and took all his lands, and got, on one pretence or another, the greater part of those of his other relatives.\n\n\"He died without issue, leaving his possession and military force to Lone Singh, his brother, who continued to pursue the same course. In 1847, he, with one thousand armed men and five guns, attacked his cousin, Monno Singh of Mohlee, the head of the family of the fourth son of Dul Singh, killed four and wounded two persons, and in collusion with the local governor seized upon all his estate. Redress was sought for in vain.\"\n\nAt annexation Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, with all Lone Singh's property, was included in the Muhamdi district, and although the raja's claim to most of this estate was absolutely nothing beyond a usurpation dating from a very few years back, his position was hardly at all disturbed. Of his fifteen hundred villages and hamlets about seventy were restored to the original owners, the rest were granted to the raja.\n\nNotwithstanding the lenity, or rather the partiality with which he was treated, Lone Singh took an active part against Government in the mutinies, and for a sum of Rs. 8,000, actually sold the fugitives from Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur to the Lucknow rebel authorities, having kept them in chains previously near his fort. He was seized, condemned to transportation for life, and, the entire estate forfeited. His fort though strong offered no resistances and flight to the Kukra jungles was his only resource. The estate was made over to loyalist grantees, and they still hold or have transferred their rights to others. Captain Hearsey, Mrs. Orr, the R\u00e1ja of Mahmudabad Mirza Abb\u00e1s Beg, the R\u00e1ja of Kapurthala, are the present possessors, not one of whom resides upon the estate, and the people are apt still to regret the overthrow of the great raja with his hundred elephants, who kept such state in Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra and N\u00edmkh\u00e1r.\n\nThe pedigrees of both branches are abstracted in the accompanying family tree. It will appear that Lone Singh claimed ninety-five generations of ancestors between himself and the first colonist, Sopi. It is very probable that much of this genealogy, just like the title deeds, was manufactured to gratify the pride or aid the intrigues of the lord of Mitauli.\n\nThe Hindu line, it will appear then, has now been almost utterly prostrated. I now revert to the history of the converts. In Alamgir's reign the Musalman branch of the family received very bad treatment. B\u00e1z Khan, who seems to have been even more simple than most of his line, was its head. His neighbour of Muhamdi, Sayyad Muqtadi, deprived him of the Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra estate as has been related above (see account of the Sayyads of Barwar).\n\nThe Sayyad and his successors, the R\u00e1jas of Muhamdi, held the pargana of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra till 1200 A.H. (1785 A.D.), when the Muhamdi raja was overthrown, but the estates were not returned to their owners. B\u00e1z Khan and his brother Fateh Khan had left numerous descendants. The former had twelve sons, of whom eight left no issue. From one of the other four descended Muhammad Husen Khan, who was the head of the family when\n\n* Sleeman's Tour, Vol II., pages 97-98.\nThe estate through which we have been passing is called Bharwara, and contains the sites of nine hundred and eighty-nine villages, about one-fourth of which are now occupied. The landholders are all of the Ahbun Rajput tribe; but a great part of them have become Musulmans. They live together, however, though of different creeds, in tolerable harmony; and eat together on occasions of ceremony, though not from the same dishes. No member of the tribe ever forfeited his inheritance by changing his creed. Nor did any one of them, I believe, ever change his creed, except to retain his inheritance, liberty, or life, threatened by despotic and unscrupulous rulers. They dine on the same floor, but there is a line marked off to separate those of the party who are Hindoos from those who are Musulmans. The Musulmans have Mahomedan names, and the Hindoos Hindu names, but both still go by the common patronymic name of Ahbuns. The Musulmans marry into Musulman families, and the Hindoos into Hindoo families of the highest castes\u2014Choubans, Rathores, Rykwars, Janwars, &c. Of course all the children are of the same religion and caste as their parents. They tell me that the conversion of their ancestors was effected by force under a prince or chief called Kala Pahar. This must have been Mahomed Firmally alias Kala Pahar, to whom his uncle Bheilole, king of Delhi, left the district of Bahrsetch as a separate inheritance a short time before his death, which took place A.D. 1488. This conversion seems to have had the effect of doing away with the murder of female infants in the Ahbun families who are still Hindoos; for they could not get the Musulman portion of the tribe to associate with them if they continued it.\n\n\"The estate of Bharwara is divided into four parts\u2014Hydrabad, Hurunpoor, Aleegunge, and Sekunderabad. Each division is subdivided into parts, each held by a separate branch of the family; and the subdivision of these parts is still going on as the heads of the several branches of the Ahbun family die and leave more than one son. The present head of the Ahbun family is Mahomed Hussan Khan, a Musulman, who resides in his fort in the village of Jalalpoor, near the road over which we passed. The small fort is concealed within, and protected by a nice bamboo-fence that grows round it. He holds twelve villages rent-free as nankar, and pays revenue for all the rest that compose his share of the great estate. The heads of families who hold the other shares enjoy in the same manner one or more villages rent-free as nankar. These are all well cultivated, and contain a great many cultivators of the best classes such as Koormees, Lodhies, and Kachies.\"\n\nMuhammad Hasan Khan's sons held at annexation forty-two villages comprised in the estate of Jalalpur, Bhurwra, Bargadia. Another son of Tarbiat Khan's left many descendants, but one of them held two villages and the others none at all. From a third son was descended Madar Bakhab, who left an estate of some twenty villages with his headquarters at the old family residence of Kotwara. But the family tree showing a few of the more prominent members is given at the end of this account.\nand the broad facts of the tenures will be apparent from it. It has several points of interest. One is that none of these estates were given to the present proprietors as owners; if so, there would have been some principle of division, either equal shares, or the elder son would have got a large proportion. But the largest estate, that of Kotwara, belongs to the scion of a younger branch, and many of the family have no landed possessions at all. All over the pargana different members of the family had their residences, and it seems to have been an understood thing among them that each should get as many villages as possible in his own neighbourhood under his control, and that the others should not interfere. So Fateh Khan's descendants settled in the north of the Haidarabad pargana at Gola and Kukra, and they acquired between 1821 and 1832 more than three quarters of their estates, all lying near Gola.\n\nBahadur Khan's descendants all settled in the little pargana of Sikan-darabad (now included in Haidarabad), and they have no villages beyond its borders; they acquired the whole estate between 1821 and 1832, as did the descendants of Sangi Khan, the owners of Jalalpur, Bhurwara, and Kotwara; the two former in Aliganj and the latter in the south of Haidarabad, but their villages also clustered round their residences. The reason of this restoration of the family was not that their just ancestral claims were recognized, but the establishment of the estates was due to the general disorder which ensued when Hakim Mehndi in 1820 lost the chakladarship, the lord lieutenancy in fact of Muhamdi, Khairabad, and Bahraich, and was succeeded by the Lucknow Kayath Param Dhan. This man did not reside in the district, he was not of the military profession, and he found it absolutely necessary to acquiesce in the occupation or usurpation by the resident gentry of any villages which suited them. But the Abbans, although they seized upon these villages wholly without title or right, when once a generation had passed in possession were eager to assert a proprietary tenure, and to divide the estate among the children after the strictest rules of ancestral property as is apparent from passages already quoted from Colonel Sleeman.\n\nAs will appear further the Hindu branch of the family likewise divided the property according to ancestral shares among the entire fraternity in the eighteenth century; and since annexation the only large proprietor among the Hindus, the chief of Banshi, has recognized the title of his uncles and cousins in a similar way. There is no doubt that the results have been unfortunate. The owners of Bhurwara, Kukra, of Siathu, of Banshi, Saukhia Sansarpur, all mortgaged or sold, the greater part of their estates in the ten years preceding annexation, and for very inadequate sums\u2014all of these transfers were effected under pressure, some under mere personal restraint, others as Siathu only, when the owner had been subjected to violence and threatened with death.\n\nOne great taluqdar, the Raja of Oel, swallowed up Bhurwara, Chaurethia, Siathu; another, Lone Singh of Mitauli, seized upon Kukra and Mailani; another, the Thakur of Mahewa, obtained possession of Saukhia Sansarpur and Banshi. Thus in ten years the Ahban family lost seventy-two villages, of which they have recovered less than one-half through redemption of the mortgages effected by widows and old men who were willing to sign\nanything in order to escape from the fetters, the stripes and dishonour to which they were subjected.\n\nIf the estate of Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra had remained undivided up till annexation, it would have escaped the ruin which ensued in the brief period between Sleeman's visit and annexation; and there is no doubt that it was the dread of divisions and destruction in detail which caused the great Hindu families to adhere to primogeniture for many generations together during times of anarchy and confusion. When there was no law and order maintained by the state, the raja was the sole source of government and protection which existed; in the nature of things that power was indivisible, and in his estates naturally the same unity was maintained; for no native government was ever strong enough to support itself apart from the strength which belongs to the possession of land. But whenever the function of government was taken up by other hands, and the raja whatever his title became a mere landed proprietor, then the indivisibility of the estate ceased with the loss of the kingship with which it was united.\n\nThe practice of the Ahbans, the oldest clan in Oudh, affords the strongest proof that primogeniture as a rule for the division of landed property was an exotic custom, forced upon the Hindus and Musalmans alike by the absence of an organized government.\n\n---\n\n**Diagram**\n\n```\nSopi. \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 Gopl.\nDescendants still live in Kuwan Danda, sita Sitapur. 35 generations intervene.\nKunwar Sah.

Their annals are to be found in detail in the Kheri pargana article. They take their origin from one Jamni Bh\u00e1n, who in 1553 obtained the post of chaudhri in Kheri with the right to levy two pice on all the lands in that pargana. His descendants in 1730, then styled \u201cr\u0101j,\u201d possessed some villages. In 1780 the chakladar gave them many villages, and in 1823 they obtained the pargana of Srinagar consisting of 299 villages. In 1839 their possessions were still further extended, and they obtained 30 villages in pargana Karanpur or northern Paila. At present they are the owners of 330 villages comprising the large taluqas of Oel, Mahewa, and Kaimahra, with a small share in the Lakhrawan estate.\n\nThe J\u00e1ngres.\u2014The clan claims descent from Chaturbhuj, who is said to have come from Jalaun in \u00c1lamg\u00edr\u2019s time and established himself in Dhaurahra; but nothing is known of him or his descendants prior to Jodh Singh, who, in the seventh generation from Chaturbhuj, held the country now occupied by parganas Dhauraha, Nigh\u00e1san, Bh\u00far, and half of Firozabad. He was a proud and defiant man, confident in the strength of his country; with deep rivers in front, and the huge forest of the tar\u00e1i behind, in which he could at any time take refuge. The n\u00e1zm, R\u00e1ja S\u00edtal Parsh\u00e1d, in 1192 Fa\u0161li (1782 A.D.), thought that the time had come when the semi-independent chiefs of north-west Oudh might be reduced; the Rohillas, their constant allies, who had several times established a protectorate over this quarter had been crushed, and the opportunity was favourable. The threatened rajas combined for mutual defence; they were the lords of Dhaurahra, Mitsuili, and L\u00e1harpur,\u2014a J\u00e1ngre, an Ahban, and a Gaur. They joined their forces and awaited the attack; but thinking that they might gain by advancing, they marched to Tandiaon in Hardoi, lay in ambush there, and completely routed the raja\u2019s lieutenant with the loss of nineteen guns. This enraged the raja, who moved against the rebels with an immense army; they made a stand outside Dhaurahra, but were outflanked and commenced a retreat through the town streets, the royal troops pressing on them, but not very fiercely. The way lay under the walls of R\u00e1ja Jodh Singh\u2019s fort. Stung by the thought that his home and hearth would be desecrated by the polluting touch of the Turk, he disengaged himself from the rear of his army, and rushing forward in front of the advancing enemy cried out,\u2014\u201cIs there anyone of great birth among you who will cross swords with me.\u201d A Sayyad, a valiant warrior, stepped forward. The two closed between the armies; the Sayyad almost severed Jodh Singh\u2019s head from his body, but the dying Chhattri had strength enough to drive his dagger into his foe\u2019s heart, and the two fell mortally wounded side by side. They are buried within a stone\u2019s throw of each other, and the people still tell with pride of the only heroic deed which they ever heard of.\n\nThe rebel force dismayed by the fall of their champion broke and fled. All day the pursuit continued, till they reached the banks of the S\u00e1rda, opposite the fort of Khairigarh. The ferry boats were useless, and the flying rebels turned desperately at bay; they were driven into the river, and the heads of the chiefs of L\u00e1harpur and Mitauli cut off as they struggled in the water. The whole of Dhaurahra and Bh\u00far were never again re-united.\nunder one head. Both apparently were held by the Government which made its own arrangement with the cultivators.\n\nSeveral matters of interest may be noted in connexion with the foregoing. It is alleged that the J\u00e1ngre, Jodh Singh, was invited by the copyholders and tenants to assume the government, because they found the Bisen chiefs tyrannical and exacting. Again, it appears that the r\u0101ja's authority over the pargana did not cease when Government assumed the direct management. After Jodh Singh's death his widow, an able woman, a native of Sitapur, was granted three or four villages rent-free as a provision. Bairis\u00e1l Singh and his son Qalandar Singh, the Bisen rajas, had in vain attempted to recover the estate. R\u00e1m N\u00e1th Singh, the son of the last Bisen, made a third attempt thinking that there would be no one to resist him, but the r\u0101ni collected her forces, met the invader at Nawapur, herself marshalling her troops on the field, and defeated this last effort made by the Bisens. She gradually recovered a large portion of the pargana, and died in 1833, having acquired also part of Dharm\u00e1npur in Bahraich.\n\nIn 1848 her successor, Arjun Singh, got the entire pargana, and the estate was forfeited after the mutiny.* The Bh\u00far estate, which was re-constituted after the death of R\u00e1ja Jodh Singh was nominally subject to the head of the Dhaurahra family; its owners paying them as suzerains an annual bhent or subsidy, about six shillings for each village.\n\nThe J\u00e1ngre family has for centuries been noted for the incapacity of its males. R\u00e1ja Jodh Singh was not a J\u00e1ngre; he was adopted by the previous owner who was childless from a Sombansi family in the village of Manda in Firozabad pargana. We have seen that it was his r\u0101ni, also not of J\u00e1ngre blood, who restored the fallen fortunes of the family, and similarly it was the r\u0101ni of Ganga Singh who consolidated the Bh\u00far estate.\n\nThe present lords of the soil are the four heirs of R\u00e1j Ganga Singh, whose widow, aided by her brother, stoutly contested the re-establishment of British authority after the mutinies.\n\nThe Pah\u00e1ri S\u00farajbans of Khairigarh.\u2014One family still remains to be noticed, the Pah\u00e1ri S\u00farajbans of Khairigarh, which, up to the year 1830 A.D., possessed not a village in British India, and are now the owners of the whole pargana of Khairigarh with the exception of the Government forests. This clan had been driven from their ancient seat in the hills by the Gurkhas about the end of the last century, and after wandering about subsisting on the charity of their fellow Chhatris, or fighting under the British Government, settled at Basantpur in Bh\u00far, and at Kalbaria in Khairigarh, which villages had been given them for maintenance.\n\nIn 1830 they attacked the Banj\u00e1ras who at that time owned Khairigarh, and drove them out. These laid their complaint before the Oudh Government. A force was despatched under the command of the chakladar, and they were for a few years reinstated. Disease, however, broke out among the troops, the chakladar and nearly the entire force perished, and\n\n* See Dhaurahra.\nthe survivors made their escape unmolested by the S\u00farajbans, who thenceforth held undisturbed possession, of Khairigarh.\n\nBuildings.\u2014There are no ancient buildings of much note. The forts of Barwar, Khairigarh, Mitauli, Muhamdi, K\u00e1mp, Balmi\u00e1r Barkh\u00e1r, are interesting from their historical associations, but not from their structural features, extent, or military strength. They are more or less in ruins. There are three or four small temples in each pargana, mostly dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo, but none of them rank architecturally above petty shrines. They are all a few feet square, and thirty to fifty feet high, built of brick, and covered with plaster effigies. There are no houses, save of the humblest kind. The wealthy owners of tracts covering 500 square miles, like the lords of Bh\u00far, live in wretched mud-walled enclosures, surrounded by their cattle. There are no brickbuilt houses in Muhamdi, there being a popular prejudice against them; a similar prejudice against the use of bricks, either for houses or well-building-exists among the Abbans, who own a large principality here. There are only 129 masonry houses in the whole district.\n\nThere are several masonry tanks,\u2014one at Dhaurahra near Kaimahra, built by the grandfather of the Kaimahra raja, but this is in a ruinous condition, and owing to defective construction, never contains any water. There are many (2,634) brick wells; but excluding these, a tank in Kheri is the only permanent work of private or public utility which has been handed down through all the thousands of years preceding the annexation of the province in 1856.\n\nNot a bridge, not a road, except a few cart tracts; not a single work for the collection or distribution of water; no markets for the accommodation of trade; no schools; no dispensaries or hospitals; man had simply done nothing for his fellow man through all those centuries except build wells. Labour was abundant, for the inhabitants constructed innumerable brick wells. Some are of enormous size, built by the Sayyad family of Muhamdi, who appear to have been the first civilizers of the district; but the greater part are from twenty to thirty feet deep, about four feet in diameter, and cost about Rs. 400 to construct. Hardly any of them are used for irrigation; the foundations are being too yielding to admit of the strain caused by drawing up large buckets of water.\n\nThere are some remarkable ruins at Fateh Kara on the tenth mile north-west of Lakh\u00edmpur. They consist of numerous mounds, covered with jungle and blocks of carved stone on the bank of the Ul. The principal mound seems to have covered a temple of the sun, a huge representation of which in four quarters, similar to what Colonel Tod describes as the ornament to the throne room at Udepur, is lying half buried. The capitals of pillars, also of a Chalukia or Rajput type but much defaced by exposure, are also to be seen. A large frieze, about six feet long and twenty inches high, with three sitting and eight standing figures, is in an adjoining village. A head of Buddha with an apsara upon it has somehow escaped attention, and shows considerable expression and freedom of execution: the whole composition was a very graceful one origi-\nnally. A very peculiar image of the Ardhan\u00e1ri type, but exhibiting a combination of symbols unprecedented in my reading or observation, was also discovered. The figure carries the conch shell, the quoit, the trident, and Nandi is at its feet.\n\nThese mounds have not been touched: nor indeed have any of the much larger mounds in this district. At Barkh\u00e1r, in Muhamdi pargana, for instance, some of them are certainly stupas, and it is very probable that a few excavations would be rewarded. Buddhists always buried more or less valuable matter in these buildings, and it might reasonably be expected that Oudh would be as fruitful as other places. Gold coins of the Gupta series have repeatedly been picked up in Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra and Kotw\u00e1ra near this place.\n\n**KHERI Pargana\u2014Tahsil LAKH\u00cdMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014Pargana Geographical features.** Kheri lies between the Ul on the east and the Jamw\u00e1ri on the south-west; artificial boundaries separate it from pargana Paila on the north-west and the district of Sitapur on the south. Its area is 192\u00b769 square miles; its population is 104,916 in 193 villages; its extreme length is 24 and breadth 15 miles.\n\nThe pargana is roughly divided into two parts. One is an upper plateau which is largely irrigated from jhils and wells; its level is about 480 feet above the sea; it contains three quarters of the pargana, nearly all high class loam soil. To the north-east of this plateau, along its whole length, lies a slope, one or two miles in breadth, of lighter soil, which suddenly sinks into the tar\u00e1i of the Ul. Further, to the south-east of this plateau the Kew\u00e1ni river has formed a very extensive tar\u00e1i of first-class land, separated from the Ul tar\u00e1i, as far as the borders of this district, by a promontory of high land running south-east from the main plateau. This tar\u00e1i is at a level nearly sixty feet beneath the upper ground; Lakh\u00edmpur station being 483 feet above the sea, and the Ul 425 feet. Down the centre of the pargana runs a series of marshy lakes, which collect the water of the plateau which is slightly saucer-shaped. The southern edge is formed by the high bank of the Jamw\u00e1ri, as the northern is by the bank of the Ul. The lakes, commencing with that at Gumchaini, communicate in the rains, and generally there is a slight uniting stream running by Samitha, Atwa, Dharsa, Mahmudabad, Sarain, Samonia, Keshopur to Muhammadpur, where the channel becomes a perennial stream and joins the Kew\u00e1ni. Unfortunately, however, the outlet is not sufficient, and the overflow from these lakes spreads over a great area, as the lowest point of this plateau is only eleven feet lower than the highest. A part of the water also from these great jhils in heavy rain seeks an outlet through the Lakh\u00edmpur station to the Ul, and five persons were drowned or killed by the floods and falling houses in 1870. This series of lakes offers a good situation for small irrigation channels, which will be more required every year. Kheri is well supplied with groves. Water is obtained with difficulty at a depth of 30 feet along the border ridge of the plateau, but easily at a depth of about sixteen feet elsewhere on the plateau, and at eight feet in the tar\u00e1i. The old pargana of Bas\u00e1ra now joined Kheri lies on the west of the Jamw\u00e1ri.\nThe principal castes are as follows:\n\n| Population | Shekhs, Sayyads | Other Musalmans | Brahmins | Chhattris | Banians, Kayaths |\n|------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|-----------|----------------|\n|            | 3,272          | 11,440          | 10,987   | 8,158     | 3,618          |\n\nOf the above 55 per cent. are agriculturists and 45 per cent. are non-agriculturists. Hindus are 88,920, Musulmans 15,996. Kurmis are the most numerous caste of cultivators, forming 21 per cent of the whole population; Brahmins, Cham\u00e1rs, P\u00e1sis, come next. There are 3,158 Chhattris, mostly Janw\u00e1rs of mixed blood; but the ownership of the soil rests principally with the pure bred Chhattris, about twenty of whom hold 138 villages out of 161 in Kheri proper, and two, the chiefs of Oel and Mahewa, hold 130 out of the 193 in the joint pargana.\n\nThere is a small local traffic in grain and a considerable settlement of cotton printers in the town of Oel, and of weavers round Amiraganj. There is one road from Lakhimpur to Sitapur, another to Gola, and thence to Muhamdi, a third to Sikandarabad, and thence to Muhamdi; all three are raised and bridged. The road to Bahraich is not, and none of them are metalled.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014There are some curious old wells built of stone, octagonal in shape: one in Salempur close to Lakhimpur. Sayyad Khurd's tomb in Kheri, and the houses of his descendants, have evidently been built of materials taken from older buildings; blocks, of kankar, the large bricks used by Buddhists and Bhars, and the common small bricks being intermixed everywhere. There are numerous sites of ancient villages such as G\u00fcm, Ujar, Gumchaini, Salempur.\n\nKheri was the centre of a Pasi kingdom; they were not builders like the Bhars, probably not a tank or well now existing was built by them. It is alleged that a large city formerly extended along the bank of the Ul to Rangilenagar from Rampur Gokul. I see no evidence of anything of the kind. There should be some traces of civic subdivisions still surviving in name at any rate, such as mohalla or patti, but there are none. There have been numerous villages and country-houses here on the high bank of the Ul, formerly a much larger river. The Sayyads held the country from Kheri to Pihani, Barwar and Aliganj, rent-free. They resided here partly, and no doubt spent here a great portion of the revenue which is now drained off annually to Lucknow.\n\nHistory.\u2014History gives us no notice of Kheri prior to the Ain-i-Akbari, but we gather from local tradition that it was visited by Raja Janimijai, grandson of the Pandu Arjun, who killed a snake here, or overcame a Scythian chief, as rationalists would interpret the legend. The place is called Suraikund; it is near Deokali, five miles west from Kheri, and is yet the scene of animal worship as it was in Akbar's time and for centuries previously. The name of Kheri is variously derived from Khem Karan,\nalleged to have been a companion of Janimijai, or from the abundance of rice and milk (kh\u00edr), which was produced in this then pastoral country.\n\nIt contained originally 1,059 villages, of which 299 were taken out and formed into pargana Srinagar, 243 used to make up pargana Dhaurahra, and 527 left; at demarcation these were thrown into 211. Of these 50 more, lying between the Chauka and the Ul, have been since added to Srinagar leaving 161, and the pargana of Bas\u00e1ra containing 32 has been included in Kheri which has now 193 villages.\n\nBisens appear to have been the earliest zamindars, probably belonging to the great Manjhauli family which held Dhaurahra during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and, indeed, seems to have spread right across Oudh north of Sitapur; J\u00e1ts and Banj\u00e1ras also held partial proprietary rights. The whole pargana, however, became a part of the great estate formed by the Sayyads of Barwar (see Kheri district article, chapter V.). The position held by the Barwar Sayyads in Kheri during the 18th century is surrounded with much obscurity. From the pargana 'T\u00fam\u00e1r',* dated 1116 fasli, it appears that one Nawab Mustatab Mualla Alq\u00e1b held the whole, containing 1,059 villages as j\u00e1gir. There can be no doubt from the consensus of tradition that this Nawab, whether rightly or wrongly so called, was Sayyad Karim, who died in 1719 A.D. This document further informs us that of these 1,059 villages 61 were granted rent-free to Sayyads and 40 to old zamindar q\u00e1n\u00fangos.\n\nParbal Singh, Chaudhri, the ancestor of the r\u00e1jas of Oel and Kaimahra had three villages\u2014Kaimahra, Khogi, and Oel. Jagr\u00e1j, his grandson, according to the family tree, had Dhukwa, in which his descendants now remain. R\u00e1e Th\u00e1n Singh, who appears to have been the head of the family, had nine villages, and his two sons, Bhagwant and M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta, had two each. A brick fort in Bel near Kaimahra is alleged to have belonged to this family, but the workmanship and architecture of the ruin so exactly resemble those of neighbouring old Sayyad forts in Si\u00e1thu and Ahmadnagar, that I have no hesitation in ascribing it to the Pih\u00e1n\u00ed nobles. In all the Janw\u00e1rs had therefore eighteen villages; one Sayyad Abdul Ghaff\u00edr had seven villages; Kurmis and q\u00e1n\u00fangos had the others. The Bais had one village.\n\nThe contrast between the then ownership of the pargana and that existing at annexation is interesting. The great estate of Mahewa did not even exist; those of Oel and Kaimahra appear one hundred and fifty years ago as a tiny freehold of four hamlets; while the descendants of the great Sadr-us-sud\u00e1r, who then held the whole country from the Gogra to the Ganges, between Sitapur and the hills, now barely exist in penury and obscurity. The power of the Sayyads in Kheri appears to have been first shaken by the L\u00e1harpur Gaurs, probably after the death of Sayyad Khurram, and the dissensions which then arose. The Janw\u00e1rs relate that in R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n's time they had to fly from the Gaurs: this would be about 1740. The Abbans also of Mitauli for fifteen years in Parsa of Dhaurahra pargana concealed themselves from the same fierce foe, who also expelled\n\n*T\u00fam\u00e1r or Band-i-T\u00fam\u00e1r is a rolled manuscript or scroll often used for chronicles.\nthe bastard successor of the Pih\u00e1n\u00ed Sayyad, Ali-Akbar Khan, from his whole estate. The latter with aid from the Rohillas drove back the Gaurs, beating them at Mail\u00e1n\u00ed in Kukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed, but it is not clear that the Pih\u00e1n\u00ed chief, now called the R\u00e1ja of Muhamdi, ever recovered his former footing in Kheri.\n\nUnder the Sayyad in 1709 A.D., the revenue of the Kheri pargana was it seems Rs. 44,970, of which the khar\u00edf was Rs. 25,359, and the rabi Rs. 19,611; only 200 of the 1,059 villages were uninhabited. The rabi crop is now three times as valuable as the khar\u00edf. The Sayyads seem to have settled the pargana rapidly and well. There are very numerous remains of this family still in existence. Prior to their occupation another Sayyad, a recent immigrant from Arabia named Khurd, had colonized the country. Sanads granted by Humay\u00fan prove that his efforts to dispossess the P\u00e1si zamindars were resisted by the latter, who claimed their right unsuccessfully at Delhi.\n\nSayyad Khurd held twenty-two villages in j\u00e1g\u00edr, and died in 971 Hijri (1563 A.D.) at a very great age. His tomb is in Kheri, with twenty lines of Persian poetry, each composing the date.\n\nAbdulla, his son, was the Emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n\u2019s tutor, and received 49 villages more from his pupil. Four generations later the direct male line failed, but the two collateral Sayyad families had intermarried, and Abd-ur-Rahm\u00e1n, great-grandson of Nawab Badar Jah\u00e1n of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, was to have inherited through his mother, the only representative of the Kheri Sayyads being her father Ali Asghar. But Abd-ur-Rahm\u00e1n, who was sent to coerce the refractory and insolvent J\u00e1t zamindars of Jamkohna, who had 127 villages, returning triumphant to Kheri, the young warrior\u2019s standard bearers sang his praises,\u2014\u201cGreat are the Sayyads of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed.\u201d The grandfather heard it, and fancying that the glory of the Kheri Sayyads would die out, he forthwith married again. He left a son and daughter to whom Aurangzeb decreed the inheritance, leaving only three villages to Abd-ur-Rahman. Constant subdivisions of the property and the forfeiture of the mu\u00e1f\u00eds reduced this family, and none of them now hold any villages although they have subordinate right in several.\n\nNowhere has the gradual encroachment of careful and saving Hindus upon extravagant Musalmans been so marked as in Kheri. The Janw\u00e1rs of Kheri were originally Chauh\u00e1n Chhattiris who were in the Sayyads\u2019 service, but must early have attained distinction: because in 970 Hijri (A.D. 1562), the year before Sayyad Khurd expired, Jamni Bh\u00e1n, the ancestor of the Janw\u00e1rs, was granted two pice per bigha as chaudhri on all the lands in Kheri so late as 1713 A.D. The head of the family was called R\u00e1\u00e9 and had only nine villages; his residence was at Bel. From this humble beginning the Janw\u00e1rs have become very extensive landlords. In 1870 the chakladar gave them a number of villages. In 1823 they got the whole pargana of Srinagar, consisting of 299 villages, and in 1833 their possessions were still more extended. About 1843 they got 30 villages in the Paila pargana; they have now in all about 330 villages.\n\nTheir own account of their origin may now be given. The Janw\u00e1rs assert that another old family formerly held all these parganas\u2014Kheri,\nBas\u00e1ra, and Srinagar. The head of this family lived at Karanpur in Kheri pargana, and was named Chaudhri Mihm\u00e1n S\u00e1h: he had a daughter. Hulsa and M\u00e1ldeo, younger sons of Baisinghdeo, Chauh\u00e1n r\u00e1ja of M\u00faran in Jaipur, after their father's death (in 1537) entered the service of Naw\u00e1b Badar Jah\u00e1n, and were sent to reduce the refractory zamindars of Kheri, which had been given as j\u00e1gir to the Sayyads. Hulsa married the only daughter of Mihm\u00e1n S\u00e1h, and his son succeeded Mihm\u00e1n S\u00e1h in the property whatever it was. The Chauh\u00e1ns took the name of his father-in-law, and based their claim upon the connection. This story is evidently fictitious, as the Sayyads were not granted Kheri till the 17th century.\n\nThe elder branch of the family is represented by the r\u00e1ja of Kaimahra, Narpat Singh, thirteen generations in descent from Hulsa. R\u00e1ja Ajab Singh, his father's cousin, was the first of the family ennobled, but the title was conferred by the tribes only about forty years ago; the present is the second r\u00e1ja. In 1849 Anrudh Singh of Oel was made a r\u00e1ja by the king of Oudh; he is really the head of the clan owing to his great wealth and ability. His property consists of 168 villages as follows:\n\n- 75 in pargana Kheri.\n- 68 \" \" Srinagar.\n- 4 \" \" Fa\u00efla.\n- 20 \" \" Bh\u00far.\n- 1 \" \" Dhauraha.\n\nHis Government revenue under the new assessment is Rs. 117,114.\n\nThe Th\u00e1kur of Mahewa has a large estate in the same pargana; he holds 113 villages and pays Rs. 77,910. The R\u00e1ja of Kaimahra, Narpat Singh, has not augmented the original possessions of the family, and has only 31 villages paying revenue Rs. 25,000. He is the son of R\u00e1ja Jodh Singh mentioned in Sleeman's Tour, Volume II., page 3. In the whole pargana of Kheri proper there are 161 villages owned by\u2014\n\n| Janw\u00e1rs | ... | ... | ... | 138 |\n| K\u00e1yaths | ... | ... | ... | 16 |\n| Musalmans | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n| Brahmins | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n| Gosh\u00edn | ... | ... | ... | 1 |\n| English | ... | ... | ... | 2 |\n\nIn Bas\u00e1ra there are 32 villages owned entirely by Janw\u00e1rs.\n\nThe Janw\u00e1r family never was of any political importance; but its history is valuable as showing how a respectable chaudhri, with a dozen villages, added estate to estate, and the family has now become the owner of vast property. Their influence is only derived from wealth, and connexion with Government; there are not more than fifty or six Janw\u00e1rs of the Chauh\u00e1n stock alive. A much larger number of the original Janw\u00e1rs still exist, but most of them have been converted to Muhammadanism, and have been badly treated by their more powerful brethren.\n\nThe K\u00e1yaths in the pargana produce a sanad from Akbar granting them seventy-four villages; but it is a forgery of the coarsest description. They are numerous and influential however, and have no doubt lived\nmany generations in the pargana; they possess eleven villages and numerous small rent-free holdings. There were four qan\u00fangos in Kheri\u2014all of one family,\u2014but one was originally of Barhai or carpenter caste, having been adopted by the head of the family nine generations ago. One branch was deprived of their rent-free tenures for false evidence in a court of law when the succession to the Mahewa estate was disputed.\n\nKHERI\u2014Pargana KHERI\u2014Tahsil LAKHYMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014A large town from which the pargana and the district of Kheri derive their names. Latitude 27\u00b054', longitude 80\u00b051'. There are 14 Hindu temples, 12 mosques, and three im\u00e1mb\u00e1ras. Kheri has a daily market in which articles of country consumption are sold. The R\u00e1mk\u00edla festival is celebrated in the month of September; about 8,000 persons assemble. There are 74 masonry houses, more than one-half of the whole number in the district; there are also 58 masonry wells. Altogether it is the only place in the district bearing the appearance of a town. It is difficult to see what caused its prosperity in former times. It is not the residence of any large landowner, though in former times the Sayyads of Sayyadw\u00e1ra, one of its muhallas, were wealthy and influential.\n\nThe tomb of Sayyad Khurd, who died in 971 H. or 1563 A.D., is composed of huge kankar blocks and is worth seeing. The Emperor \u00c1lamg\u00edr built a mosque here which is yet unimpaired. The population, according to settlement papers, amounts to 5,037, of which 2,002 are Hindus and 3,035 Muhammadans.\n\nKHIRON Pargana\u2014Tahsil LALGANJ\u2014District RAEBARELI.\u2014This like other neighbouring parganas was in the possession of the Bhars, and the existence of the tomb of Fateh Shah\u00edd leads to the supposition that it was invaded by S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad. A period of 737 years has elapsed since R\u00e1ja Abhai Chand, of the Bais clan, drove away the Bhars and brought the pargana into his dominions. R\u00e1ja Satna, eighth from Abhai Chand, founded a village and called it after his own name S\u00e1tanpur. He built a fort there, calling the whole pargana S\u00e1tanpur, from the principal town. This arrangement remained till the time of Nawab As\u00edf-ud-daula when R\u00e1ja Niw\u00e1z Singh's brother, the tahsildar of the pargana, built a fort in Kh\u00edron, and fixed upon it as the seat of the tahsil. The pargana was then and since called Kh\u00edron.\n\nThe pargana comprises 123 villages; its area is 102 square miles; its breadth from east to west is nine miles, and length from north to south twelve. It is bounded on the east by parganas Dalamau and Rae Bareli; on the west by parganas Panhan, Bhagwantnagar, Bih\u00e1r, and P\u00e1tan, of Unao; on the south by pargana Sareni; and on the north by Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n of the Unao district.\n\nThere are two villages in this pargana, one Saimbansi and the other Naihesta, which are said to have been founded by Khem Karan and Karan R\u00e1e, sons of Harhar Deo respectively. The descendants of Khem Karan, therefore, are called Bais Saimbansi, and of Karan R\u00e1e Bais Naihesta. Shiupal Kunwar, widow of Jagan N\u00e1th Bakhsh, of Simri, taluqdar, belongs to this latter family.\nThe proprietary body are for the most part the Bais Chhattris, but a Janw\u00e1r Chhattri, Chaudhri Balbhaddar Singh, Taluqdar of Bharauli, deserves mention. Narmad S\u00e1h, his ancestor, was a native of Ikauna in the Bahraich district, and in the service of the Emperors of Delhi, whence he got the chauthrship and zamindari in this pargana. He gave the name of Kh\u00edron to a chak, then known as Kheri H\u00e1r. He settled himself there, and by and by his descendants took possession of some villages in this pargana, and established themselves as taluqdars.\n\nThe proprietary system is as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | ... | ... | ... | ... | 86 villages. |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|--------------|\n| Grant     | ... | ... | ... | ... | 8 \"          |\n| Zamindari | ... | ... | ... | ... | 19 \"         |\n| Pattidari | ... | ... | ... | ... | 10 \"         |\n|           |     |     |     |     | Total 123 \"  |\n\nThe area is 65,096 acres, and the revenue paid to Government is Rs. 101,389, the rate per acre being on an average, Re. 1-8-11. The population of the pargana amounts to Rs. 57,102, of which 54,341 are Hindus and 2,761 Muhammadans.\n\nBarley, birra, and musk-melon are the chief articles which are sown or planted. The soil is of three kinds\u2014dumat (loam), clay, and sand. Three quarters of the pargana are irrigated by tanks and wells. The depth at which water is found is on an average 28 feet.\n\nThere are five markets in this pargana\u2014viz., Drigp\u00e0lganj, Anand\u00edganj, Mahr\u00e1n\u00edganj, P\u00e1hu, and Raghun\u00e1thganj. Of these Raghun\u00e1thganj and Mahr\u00e1n\u00edganj are the best. The former was founded by Chaudhri Raghun\u00e1th Singh. Taluqdar, and the latter by Mahr\u00e1ni, daughter of D\u00edn\u00e1pat, the ancestor of the Simri family. There are two important fairs\u2014one in honour of Fateh Shah\u00edd, of Masa\u00fad's army, is held in Kh\u00edron on a Thursday in P\u00fas (or December-January); the other, in honour of Debi Anandi, in Bethargon on a Monday in Jeth (May). Two villages, Khasai and Kh\u00edron, produce kankar which is used in constructing roads. In the days of the kings salt was manufactured in 14 villages of this pargana, and the annual outturn was 85,649 maunds, of which the value was Rs. 67,775; saltpetre was also made in 30 villages to the amount of 50,648 maunds, of which the value was Rs. 101,296, but the manufacture of these articles has been forbidden by the Government. Mahua trees are more abundant in this pargana than in any other of the same tahsil. Other trees do not need any remark. There was a mud-built fort in Kh\u00edron and a masonry fort in S\u00e1tanpur, but both these have fallen into decay. Simri was the scene of two battles fought between R\u00e1na Beni M\u00e9dh\u00f3 Bakhsh and the British army during the mutiny.\n\nThe following account of the Bais settlement, which differs somewhat from that given under Rae Bareli, is not out of place here. Abhai Chand's eighth successor, R\u00e1ja Satna, with a view to change his capital, selected a spot in pargana Kh\u00edron where S\u00e1tanpur and R\u00e1nipur now stand, and which was then covered with jungle. Having cleared the jungle he laid the\nfoundation of a town and designated it S\u00e1tanpur after his own name. He built a fort, and a temple of Mah\u00e1deo, and placed the image of the deity which he also called Sait\u00fani, after his own name.\n\nHere he fixed his residence, and to commemorate his queen, he founded another town in the vicinity and called it R\u00e1nipur. These towns were founded in the reign of B\u00e1bar Shah in 1526 A.D., corresponding with 933 fasli. He reigned there for a period of 30 years, and maintained peace and security throughout his dominions. He had a son the famous R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand. There was then a subahdar (or Governor) of Allahabad, his name is not known, but he was an inhabitant of K\u00e1kori, a town near Lucknow. The territory of R\u00e1ja Satna extended to the very gate of Lucknow, still called Gol Darw\u00e1za. The province bordering Lucknow was governed by a faujdar, who resided at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d. He was a nominee of the r\u00e1ja. A quarrel arose between him and the subahdar of Allahabad, who was then at K\u00e1kori, and a fight took place between them at Jal\u00e1l\u00e1b\u00e1d, in which a brother of the subahdar was killed. This was during the reign of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Shah, in 1530 A.D., corresponding to 937 fasli.\n\nThe subahdar solicited the emperor for assistance in taking revenge for the murder of his brother. The emperor issued a mandate to the 13 subahdars, including the Subahdar of Allahabad, directing them to kill the r\u00e1ja and his faujdar. All the subahdars then combined their forces and led an expedition against Baisw\u00e1ra. The r\u00e1ja heard of this formidable league against him, and having collected all his forces took refuge in the fort, prepared for the attack, and awaited the approach of the enemy. R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand was then an infant, and R\u00e1ja Satna, in order to act freely, had the prudence to send his wife and child to Naip\u00e1l, so that they might not fall into the hand of the enemy. The united forces of the thirteen subahdars entered the territory of S\u00e1tanpur, and, in the year 1532 A.D., corresponding to 939 fasli, commenced the siege which lasted one month and eleven days. At last an officer of the garrison, who had the command of the entire forces of the r\u00e1ja, opened a negotiation with the subahdars, and offered to betray the r\u00e1ja and deliver up the fort to them provided they granted him revenue-free the whole of the pargana of Harha. S\u00farat Singh was the name of the traitor. The subahdars agreed to the proposal, and S\u00farat Singh opened the gates of the fort to the besieger, who entered the fort, and R\u00e1ja Satna fell fighting in his attempt to oppose the Muhammadan victors. The whole of his territory was then placed under the government of the Subahdar of Oudh, who held it for 10 years. When R\u00e1ja Tilok Chand attained the age of maturity, he made an appeal to Sultan Sher Shah, the then reigning sovereign of India, and in the year 1542 A.D., corresponding to 949 fasli he, obtained a royal farm\u00e1n for restoration to him of his ancestral estate and his peaceable maintenance in possession thereof. He then re-settled S\u00e1tanpur, and took possession of his entire estate. He was treated with the same dignity as the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jas of Jaipur and Jodhpur.\n\nAt the decline of his life he took up his residence as an act of piety in the sacred city of K\u00e1shi (Benares). He had two sons, Harhar Deo and Prithi Chand; the former went on a pilgrimage to Hardw\u00e1r, and the latter\nremained to attend on his father when the r\u0101ja fell ill and discovered the symptoms of death approaching. He called for his elder son, but finding him absent, and impatient to make a settlement of his territory on his sons during his own lifetime, he chose his younger son to be his successor, and gave his elder and absent son the title of r\u0101na. He bestowed on Prithi Chand the estate of Mur\u00e1rmau and on Harhar Deo the capital of S\u00e1tanpur and the neighbouring territory. Subsequently, owing to anarchy and constant wars with the Muhammadan sovereigns and governors, the country was gradually devastated, and the town of S\u00e1tanpur deserted by its inhabitants, and many old remains of grandeur disappeared in the lapse of time by dilapidation and the effect of constant warfare. The younger son, Prithi Chand, thus became the r\u0101ja, and though Harhar Deo returned from the pilgrimage before the r\u0101ja had breathed his last, yet the latter did not think it advisable to disturb his previous arrangement. Thus the elder branch began to be styled r\u0101na though in possession of the capital, and recognized to be the successor of R\u0101ja Tilok Chand, and the younger branch was styled r\u0101ja.\n\nKHIIRON\u2014Pargana KHYRON\u2014Tahsil LALGANJ\u2014District RAEBARELI\u2014This town is situated on the road from Rae Bareli to Cawnpore. The ground is level; to the east there is a large tank, which with the groves forms a pleasing landscape. The place is noted as having been the residence of R\u0101e S\u0101hib R\u0101e, K\u0101yath, a chakladar of the king's reign. It is still the residence of a taluqdar. There are some notable old families of the K\u0101yath q\u00e1n\u00fangos. There are 682 Sunni Musalmans; the rest of the population of 3,480 are Hindus. The Brahmans and Bani\u00e1ns are generally the followers of Vishnu, Chhattris and K\u0101yaths of Shiva. There is a vernacular school in which 75 pupils are taught, and a weekly market, where the average sales are Rs. 180. For history of the place, see pargana article.\n\nKISHNI\u2014Pargana JAGDISPUR\u2014Tahsil MUS\u00c1FIRKHANA\u2014District SULTANPUR.\u2014Kishni is situated on the right bank of the river Gumti and occupies a high plateau, surrounded by ravines, which open on the river about 46 miles north-west of Sultanpur. It was founded about four hundred years ago by R\u0101ja Kishan Chand, ancestor of the Mandarik Chhattris, whose capital it remained until they lost their independence. Until 1750 it was the headquarters of the old Kishni pargana. It contains 532 houses, of which three only are of masonry, with a population of 2,297. The only building worthy of notice is a mosque built by Q\u00e1zi Abd-us-Satt\u00e1r, in the reign of Alamg\u00edr.\n\nLatitude 26\u00b035\u2032; longitude 81\u00b041\u2032\n\nKOR\u00c1RI KAL\u00c1N\u2014Pargana ASIYAN RASULABAD\u2014Tahsil MOH\u00c1N\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Is 16 miles south-west of Moh\u00e1n, and 10 north-west of Unao. Rasulabad lies 4 miles south-west from it. A small stream called the Mot\u00e1i flows east of this place.\n\nIt was peopled originally by one Kunwar of the Bhar tribe about 1100 years ago. About six hundred years after that it passed into the possession of Ishwari Singh and Bisr\u00e1m Singh, Chauh\u00e1n Th\u00e1kurs of Mainpuri, who exterminated the Bhars, and whose descendants still possess it.\nThe climate is healthy; the water good, with few exceptions. The soil is principally loam, with some clay. Nothing is manufactured here except the usual earthenware. Population is as follows:\n\nHindus 2,148, Musalmans 50, total 2,198. There are 528 mud-built houses, and one temple dedicated to Mah\u00e1deo. Annual sales in the bazaar amount to Rs. 2,400.\n\nLatitude 26\u00b027' north; longitude 80\u00b035' east.\n\nKUCHLA BIJNA*\u2014Pargana SANDI\u2014Tahsil BILGRAM\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Kuchla Bijna (population 2,104, chiefly Raikw\u00e1s of the Basil gotr). An agricultural village of 350-mud houses lying on the right bank of the R\u00e1mganga, four miles above its confluence with the Ganges.\n\nRaikw\u00e1s from Kusamkhor in Farukhabad obtained this village by conquest from the Thatheras before the fall of Kanauj, and have retained it ever since.\n\nKUKRA MAIL\u00c1NI Pargana\u2014Tahsil LAKH\u00cdMPUR\u2014District KHERI.\u2014This pargana lies between the Kathna on the west and the Ul on the east. Its area, inclusive of grants, is 177 square miles, of which 51 pay Government revenue. Its length is 22 miles from north to south, its breadth 13. It is bounded on the south by an artificial line separating it from pargana Haidarabad. On the north and east it stretches to the river Ul, which separates it from Bh\u00far. It is in fact a triangle with its apex to the north; it is mostly covered with jungle in which there are two large clearings\u2014one to the south, Saukhia Sans\u00e1rpur, belonging to the Th\u00e1kur of Mahewa; one to the north-east, Kukra; and a smaller one to the extreme north-west (Mail\u00e1ni). Most of the forest amounting to 126 square miles was originally made over to grantees under the lease rules, but they have all failed to comply with the conditions of the grants, and nearly all have been resumed and transferred to the Oudh Forest Department. Consequently these grants are no longer available for cultivation, and the population rate, which if applied to the whole area, would be 65 to the square mile, is really 223 to the assessed area. The soil of this pargana is very uniform\u2014a rather heavy loam; sand is less than a quarter per cent. Both these openings in the forest appear really to be the beds of ancient lakes bordered by higher ground now covered with s\u00e1l forest.\n\nThe Kukra lake drained away into the Barauncha river a branch of the Ul, and the Saukhia Sans\u00e1rpur lake gives rise to the head-waters of the Sar\u00e1yan. The level is still falling, the land becoming drier, and the climate more healthy. The very heavy rains of 1870-1871 caused a great deal of fever, but the oldest inhabitants admit that things were still worse in their youth. Formerly rice and other summer crops were almost exclusively grown, but now the proportion of spring crops is about 40 per cent. Kukra is perhaps more injured by the depredations of forest animals\u2014by enormous herds of black buck, spotted deer, and nil g\u00e1e\u2014than any other part of the district. Saukhia Sans\u00e1rpur, on the other hand, is\n\n*By Mr. Arthur Harington, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nsingularly free from such visitors; some damage is done by peacocks; but there is nothing else.\n\nThe population is 12,236 inhabiting 49 villages; of these 2,005 are Musalmans, principally Path\u00e1ns. None of the other resident castes call for any notice. The proprietary body was formerly Ahban, but many of them have lost all their possessions.\n\nThere are forty townships, of which Ahban Musalmans hold 19, Chhatris 13, Government 4. The Th\u00e1kur of Mahewa has a large estate acquired about five years before annexation. The estates of Kukra, Roshannagar, Saukhia, Sans\u00e1rpur, besides others\u2014in all thirty-six out of the forty in this pargana\u2014have changed hands since annexation, having been transferred to the rightful owners after long and costly litigation, covering from three to ten years in each case. In consequence of this the present inhabitants are poverty-stricken, and further transfers are imminent, as those who succeeded in the law courts have been so much impoverished that they cannot manage their estates.\n\nThere is a road from Gola Gokarn\u00e1n\u00e1th, partially bridged but not metalled, leading to Bhira and Marauncha Gh\u00e1t; also another from Mail\u00e1ni to Kukra. These are both impassable in the rains, as the Ul and Barauncha are not bridged; a third road from Aliganj to Khat\u00e1i is not metalled either. Traffic is quite impossible during the rains, and the prices of grain are consequently much lower here\u2014sometimes 100 per cent. less\u2014than at Lakhimpur, twenty-five miles off.\n\nRice is still the principal crop, but barley and gram have been of late years sown largely. There would be a large trade in timber if there were any means of carriage.\n\nHistory.\u2014This forest-covered tract has been certainly for centuries the favourite refuge of dacoits and rebels from both Oudh and Rohilkhand. The Katchria chiefs of Khat\u00e1i used to take refuge in these impenetrable woods, and thence commit the atrocities which resulted in the forfeiture of that estate in 1840 (see pargana Palia). Hither the Ahbans fled when hard pressed by the Government. The Kukra woods are fairly healthy, being all in high ground; in fact, the area of the forest grants, 126 square miles, also defines the extent of the upper lands, and the revenue paying land, 51 square miles, consists mainly of the basins of three or four ancient lakes into which the high lands drained.\n\nThe aspect of these mere pits in the huge surface of the forest is very peculiar. The largest (Kukra) may be taken as a type of all; a flat plain about seven miles long and four broad, covered with rice fields and prairies of long coarse grass through which breast-high the foot-passenger moves with difficulty in pursuit of the game which lies concealed in herds. A few mango groves adjoin the mud-walled villages; here and there a slight depression allows the rain water to gather in stagnant marshes; all round the horizon the traveller sees the high bluffs\u2014once the shores of this inland sea\u2014rising crowned with a ring of lofty and dense sal forest. This wall of verdure is only broken at places where it has been levelled to\nmake room for the roads which pass through the plain, piercing the forest towards Gola and Bhira.\n\nNothing can be more beautiful than the woodland glades which are met with in traversing these jungles. Wherever the high lands are level, and much elevated, the s\u00e1l abounds to the exclusion of all other trees; but on the slopes and hollows p\u00edpal, dh\u00e1k, karaunda, with an infinite variety of creepers and undergrowth, render it impossible even for an elephant to force its way. Even the s\u00e1l forest although monotonous has a verdure and slender grace all its own. The young trees rise dense and straight and evenly sown over the surface, each bursting out with little branches of leaves from its roots to the topmost boughs. The intense green, which prevails during the greater part of the year, yields in March to a brassy and then a copper tint. Then the ground begins to be strewned with dead leaves, while the ripening fruit and the yellow foliage of the fall appears intermingled with the young buds of the coming spring. This part of Kukra Mail\u00e1ni is not unhealthy, except when the rotting vegetable matter infects the water in April. As grazing grounds the openings in the forest are very valuable for agricultural purposes; but hardly any of the numerous grantees, to whom Government presented or sold 350 square miles in this neighbourhood, have succeeded in bringing their woods under cultivation.\n\nIn Mail\u00e1ni was the great fight between the Sayyads of Barwar and the Gaurs of Chandra, described in the Kheri district article. In Kukra, Ali Bakhsh Khan, the lord of the manor, built himself a small brick castle. At the gate of the family burying ground there is a flat tomb, that of Ali Bakhsh Khan's father, who killed his brother in order to obtain the estate, and whose body after death was placed at the gate, so that all true Musalmans on entering might show their horror by trampling on his dust. Undeterred by the fate of the fratricide his son committed a worse crime. The lands of Kukra had never been measured. Ali Bakhsh Khan was holding at a very moderate rent, and the chakladar wished to survey the estate and determine its capabilities. The surveyors, four in number, arrived at Kukra, and were hospitably entertained by Ali Bakhsh Khan. At dead of night the villagers, who lived near the castle, were aroused by the fire of musketry and shouts of m\u0101r m\u0101r (kill kill). All the wretched men were murdered in their sleep, and when morning dawned not a living being was seen in the villages; all fled to the forest dreading the vengeance of Government for the murder of a revenue official. Ali Bakhsh Khan had committed the crime in a spirit of mad passion against the servants of Government who were only doing their duty. He had no idea of profiting by or concealing the murder; in fact, he knew it would be his ruin and that of his family. His estate was seized; he never again saw his family, but wandered as an outlaw in the forests till in his turn he was stabbed at Muhamdi by the son of one of those whom he had cut off. This man had incessantly tracked his father's murderer for fifteen years. The estate was mortgaged to R\u00e1ja Lone Singh, who built a fort at Kukra, and is alleged to have buried his treasures\u2014three elephantloads of gold muihars\u2014in its neighbourhood after the fort of Mitauli was taken in the mutiny of 1857. It is said that he killed the elephant drivers in the forest in order to secure their silence. Similarly Roshannagar was the scene of a dark tragedy. Its owner,\na Musalman, bought the estate from a Kayath, and was admitted as proprietor by the courts in 1856. There were Ahban Chhatris who possessed an ancient claim; they attacked the Musalman's house in the first days of the mutiny and killed him, his son, and several of his servants as they lay in their beds. This has always been the conduct of the Ahban clan\u2014indolence and extravagance\u2014till their estates had passed away, and then barbarous violence in useless attempts to recover them.\n\nThere is an ancient mound from which Buddhist remains have been dug at Unchag\u00e1n in this pargana, but nothing else worthy of note. There are two small temples to Mah\u00e1deo and one mosque. There are no fairs or markets of importance.\n\nKukra Mail\u00e1n\u00ed is a part of the old pargana Bh\u00farw\u00e1ra, and an account of the Ahban lords of the soil has been given under the historical part of the district article; it formed a part of Haidarabad pargana till the recent re-arrangement.\n\n**KUMHR\u00c1W\u00c1N Pargana\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RA\u00c9 BARELI.**\n\n\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Haidargarh of district Bara Banki, on the south by pargana Hardoi of the Rae Bareli district, on the east by tahsil Mohanlalganj, of Lucknow, and on the west by pargana Rokha Jais. The area of the pargana is 70 square miles; its breadth from north to south 8 miles, and its length from east to west 11 miles.\n\nThis pargana was formerly included in that of Haidargarh, but owing to disturbances arising between the ancestors of Jagmohan Singh, of Kumhr\u00e1wan, and of Umrao Singh of Ans\u00e1ri, Almas Ali Khan, the n\u00e1zm\u00ed, separated the pargana containing 120 villages, and gave it the name of Kumhr\u00e1wan after the principal town. By the summary settlement of 1866, the number of villages in this pargana was reduced to 101, and further, by the last regular settlement, to only 58 villages.\n\nThe chief proprietary body are the Amethia Chhatris, of whom R\u00e1ja Jagmohan Singh, the descendant of R\u00e1ja D\u00edngar Singh of Bal\u00e1ri, is the present head.\n\n**The villages are thus held\u2014**\n\n| Taluqdari | Grants | Zamindari | Pattidari | Bhayyach\u00e1ra |\n|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------|\n|           |        |           |           |             |\n| ...       | ...    | ...       | ...       | ...         |\n\nThe area in acres amounts to 44,619, and the revenue paid to Government to Rs. 116,904, the rate per acre on an average being Rs. 2-9-11.\n\nThe population consists chiefly of Amethia Chhatris and Kurmis. The total population amounts to 14,954, of which 13,941 are Hindus.\nThe river Naiya traverses the northern part of this pargana, and then flows into the pargana Simrauta. The soil of this pargana is for the most part clay. There are six markets\u2014viz., Arar\u00faganj, Sahjan Pachhim-gi\u00f3n, Bani, Sambharganj, Gogra, L\u00e9lganj. In these markets the principal articles of daily use are sold. Bani only has a cattle market. Salt was manufactured before annexation to the value of Rs. 160 annually, and saltpetre is still manufactured in some villages. There is no noteworthy fair or temple in the pargana.\n\nThe history of the Amethia Chhattris, the principal proprietors in this pargana, is thus related by Mr. Benett:\n\n\"The Amethias, afterwards destined to be the most important family in the neighbourhood, were already hovering on the confines of Haidargarh.\n\n\"This tribe of Chhattris are a branch of the Chamar Gaurs, and are said to be the descendants of a pregnant Gaur widow, who, at the extirpation of the Chhattris by the Brahmins, found an asylum in a Cham\u00e1r's hut. The memory of this humble refuge is kept alive among them by the worship of the r\u00e1pi or the cobbler's cutting tool. Great numbers of the Chamar Gaurs now hold villages in the Hardoi district, and it is probable that the Amethias were an offshoot of the same immigration. Tradition discovers them first at Shiupuri and afterwards at the celebrated fortress of K\u00e1l\u00ednjar. Somewhere about the time of Tamerlane's invasion of Hindustan, Raip\u00e1l Singh left K\u00e1l\u00ednjar and settled at Amethi in the Lucknow district.\n\n\"His descendants say that he was sent by the Delhi emperor to suppress a rebellion in Oudh, and that he defeated and slew Balbadra Sen Bisen, with sixteen thousand of his host. The figures are slightly improbable, and my enquiries have failed to bring to light a Bisen r\u00e1ja of that name. Raip\u00e1l was wounded in the shoulder by a musket shot, and compensated by a khilat and the title of R\u00e1ja of Amethi.\n\n\"Three or four generations after this, three brothers\u2014D\u00edngur S\u00e9h, R\u00e1m Singh, and Lohang\u2014led their clan from *Amethi to Jagd\u00edspur, and came into contact with the Musalmans left at Bhilwal by Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Shah. The engagement resulted in the defeat of the Shekhs, and the occupation of their villages by the invaders.\n\n\"There is every reason to suppose that this occurred towards the end of the fifteenth century, and was part of the general re-assertion of Hindu supremacy in Oudh, consequent on the downfall of the Jaunpur dynasty\u2014a reaction whose central event was the establishment of the Bais kingdom. If the family tradition that Raip\u00e1l Singh came to Amethi in\n\n* Note.\u2014They were probably expelled from Amethi by the ancestors of the present taluqdar of Salempur Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad, and I am inclined to believe that some short time elapsed before they ventured to attack the Shekhs of Bhilwal. There is a tradition which represents that they passed some years in the villages of a R\u00e1c Khire Singh, one of the S\u00e9hen Bais with whom they were connected by marriage.\nTamerlane's time is true (and it is confirmed by the numbers of generations recorded between him and the present date), the three brothers, at a distance of three or four generations, must have lived about a hundred years after that date\u2014i.e., shortly before the close of the fifteenth century.\"\n\n\"The history of the Amethias is confined to the aggressions of the Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri house. R\u00e1o Kali\u00e1n S\u00e1h saluted a celebrated faq\u00edr with the respectful address of Bandagi Mi\u00e1n, and the touched and grateful saint responded with a blessing on the 'r\u00e1ja.' The title was eagerly caught up, and has since been retained by that branch, who are known as the Bandagi Mi\u00e1n Amethias. He signalized his promotion in the Hindu hierarchy by attacking and despoiling his relations, the descendants of Lohang R\u00e1e, who had been for some generations peacefully established at Akhi\u00e1pur.\n\n\"The Amethias were never of sufficient importance to have a very interesting history. This period was marked for them by the separation of the branches of Osa from the Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n, and R\u00e1m\u00e1nagar from the Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri stem. The zamindars or r\u00e1nas of Akhi\u00e1pur successfully retaliated on the latter houses for the injuries they had received from Kali\u00e1n S\u00e1h, and accomplished the death of R\u00e1ja Jai Singh, whose son (Shiuambar) was, after a short dispossession, reinstated in his own villages by the Government officials, and was soon engaged in prosecuting the old feud with the Shekhs of Bhilwal.\n\n\"Of the Amethias the only two houses which require mention are those of Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n and Pukhra Ans\u00e1ri. Of these the latter, though the younger, always seems to have been the most important. The defeat of Shuja-ud-daula by the English encouraged Amar Singh to assert his independence by driving out the local officials, but his success was very transient, and the return of the Persian was followed by his reduction and death. M\u00e1dho Singh was brought up in his mother's house at Mankapur, and only recovered L\u00e1hi and one other village at the intercession of the resident. Having once regained his footing he found no difficulty in putting together a taluqa after the usual fashion of the time. On his death, without children, the estate fell into great disorder, and after having been held successively by a number of his relations, was finally acquired by R\u00e1ja Sahajr\u00e1n Bakhsh, who, when he also died childless, was succeeded, under an order of the Chief Commissioner, by his father R\u00e1ja Umr\u00e1o Singh. Sahajr\u00e1n Bakhsh was particularly troublesome to the royal officials, but it would be tedious to relate his petty battles and temporary dispossessions.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja Rajan Singh of Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n died childless, and his death was followed by the usual disputes which were ended by the succession of R\u00e1ja Ar\u00e1ru Singh, with the title of adopted son.\"\nKUNDHNAN KHURD\u2014Pargana MANGALSI\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This was founded and called after Khunder Sen Bisen, five hundred years ago. It is on the river Madha, fourteen miles from Fyzabad. The population consists of 2,278 Hindus and 177 Musalmans\u2014all Sunnis. There is a vernacular school.\n\nKUNDRI NORTH* Pargana\u2014Tahsil BISW\u00c1N\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014North Kundri is separated from parganas Bisw\u00e1n and Sadrpur on the west by the Chauka, from zila Kheri on the north by the Dah\u00e1war, and from zila Bahraich on the east by the Gogra; all three rivers being navigable at all seasons of the year. The pargana, indeed, with South-Kundri forms the du\u00e1b of the Chauka and Gogra. In the vernacular tongue the word Kundar means du\u00e1b, and a Greek translator might render the term by \"Mesopotamia.\"\n\nLike the neighbouring Tambaur, and the eastern villages of Bisw\u00e1n, North-Kundri is a perfect network of small streams, which annually during the rains overflow their banks, and inundate the entire country, to a depth from six inches to three feet, often causing considerable loss to the peasantry, whose houses fall in, and cattle perish.\n\nThe soil is as a rule clay, which in some places stiffens into clods so hard that the ordinary implements of agriculture have no effect upon them; they do not crumble even under an elephant\u2019s foot. In many parts, however, we meet with good loam, and in the neighbourhood of the Chauka with sandy soil. In the neighbourhood of this river also there are extensive patches of reh, a white salt which rises in efflorescence on the surface of the soil, and which is generally considered to be hostile to and destructive of all vegetation. But this is an erroneous belief, for it is by no means an uncommon thing to see in this pargana, very fair crops of mindwa springing out of this reh, and bab\u00fal trees flourish well in it.\n\nSuch being the character of the soil and of the pargana, it will be gathered that it is below the average in agricultural wealth. Rents are almost universally paid in kind, the zamindars generally getting a smaller share of the produce than in other parganas. The large rivers abovementioned are very eccentric in their movements, often cutting away considerable quantities of land, often silting up and adding to the village area.\n\nThe only road in the pargana is that which connects Sitapur and Bahraich, but which is unbridged throughout. Water communication is ample; indeed, during the rains the only means of communication is afforded by boats, for the high road abovementioned is under water for miles.\n\nThe area of the pargana is 165 square miles, of which 108 are cultivated. The acreage is thus given:\n\n| Cultivated area, acres | ... | ... | ... | 69,047 |\n|------------------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|\n| Culturable             |     |     |     | 16,550 |\n| Barren                 |     |     |     | 30,304 |\n| **Total**              |     |     |     | **106,901** |\n\n* By Mr. Ferrar, Assistant Commissioner.\nThe population at the census of 1869 was as follows:\n\n| Hindu, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 40,020 |\n|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|\n| Hindu, non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 23,795 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 3,643 |\n| Musalmans, non-agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 2,126 |\n| **Total** | ... | ... | ... | **69,584** |\n\nand these live in 12,279 houses. There are thus 422 souls to the square mile, and 56 to each house. The Musalmans are 8\u00bd per cent. of the entire population. To each head of the agricultural population there are 1\u00b76 acres of cultivated land against 2 acres of the assessed area.\n\nThe incidence of the revised jama is\u2014\n\n| On cultivation | ... | ... | ... | Rs. 1 0 11 |\n| \" m\u0101lguz\u0101r\u012b | ... | ... | ... | \" 0 18 5 |\n| \" total area | ... | ... | ... | \" 0 10 7 |\n\nThe history of the pargana is given in a great measure under the heading of \u201cSouth-Kundri.\u201d To the facts there recorded may be added that the greater part of the lands which constitute the present North-Kundri were included in that \u201cGur ka il\u0101qa\u201d described under pargana Tambaur, and mentioned in the town histories of Seota and Mallapur. This explains why there are no masonry houses to be met with, and accounts for the non-cultivation of the sugarcane. There is not a single house of any pretension in the pargana.\n\nWith the exception of the fair at Seota none are celebrated throughout the pargana; there are bazars held bi-weekly in that town, and at Mallapur, Kh\u0101npur, Bamhaniaw\u00e1n, Kuudri, an insignificant place, and Th\u0101na. The pargana boasts of no architectural remains interesting either for the historian or the antiquary.\n\nThe demarcated mauzas are 129, of which 66 are held on a taluqdari, and 63 on a zamiundari tenure. The taluqdars are R\u0101o Muneshwar Bakhsh of Mallapur, R\u0101ja Am\u012br Hasan Khan of Mahmudabad, and Th\u0101kur Guman Singh of R\u0101mpur Mathura. An account of each of the two last mentioned is to be found under their respective parganas, Mahmudabad and South-Kundri. R\u0101o Muneshwar Bakhsh is a Raikw\u0101r like Guman Singh, and his estate is an offshoot of the Baundi r\u0101j in Bahraich, in which district as also in Kheri the r\u0101ja has part of his property. His pedigree table is given as extending back for 11 generations to Ratan Singh.\n\nOf the 63 zamindari villages the principal estate is that of Bamhaniaw\u00e1n. This and Sikri Sipauli in Tambaur are the only Raghubansi zamindaris in the whole district, and the sole relics of the great Raghubansi r\u0101j which existed here prior to the Raikw\u0101r invasion. The present holders of Bamhaniaw\u00e1n are 15th in descent from B\u012brbal, who divided his estates between his two sons, Indar R\u0101e, the elder, taking this, and Khem Karan, the younger, taking Sikri Sipauli.\nAmong the zamindari villages are now reckoned those which constituted the taluqa of the R\u00e1ja of Chahl\u00e1ri, a Raikw\u00e1r, who rose in arms against the State in 1857, and was slain in the affair of Nawabganj in that year. His estate was confiscated, and the greater part of it bestowed on grantees among them are the relatives of Beni M\u00e1dho, the Bais chieftain of Jagatpur T\u00e1nghan in Baisw\u00e1ra, whose estates there were confiscated for complicity in the mutiny. Some members of the Chahl\u00e1ri family have received compassionate allowances in their ancestral villages, the policy of Great Britain like that of ancient Rome, having for its motto\u2014parcere devictis ac debellare superbo.\n\nThe whole 129 villages are distributed thus:\n\n| Rajput | Kiyath. |\n|--------|--------|\n| Musalman | Dh\u00fasar Bani\u00e1n. |\n| Brahman | Bh\u00e1t or Bard. |\n\nKUNDRI SOUTH Pargana\u2014Tahsil B\u00e1ri\u2014District Sitapur.\u2014Under the present government there are two parganas of this name, to wit,\u2014North-Kundri and South-Kundri. It is with the statistics and features of the latter that we deal in the present article, but as the history of both is one and the same, it will be given here.\n\nSouth-Kundri contains 66 square miles, of which 40 are cultivated. In shape like an hour-glass, it is twelve miles in length, and three at its narrowest breadth, in the centre. On the west it is bounded by the Chauka, and on the east by the Gogra, which separates it from Bahraich. On the south it is over-lapped by that district and by Bara Banki, and on the north it is bounded by North-Kundri. Between and parallel to the two rivers abovementioned flow the smaller streams Ghaghar and Jasui, navigable during certain seasons of the year.\n\nSituated thus, the pargana is liable to frequent inundations, which often cause great injury to the crops as well as to the houses and cattle of the inhabitants, and on this account the revenue demand has been fixed at a rate which, lower than that in the rest of the tahsil, is yet perhaps no more than the land can pay one year with another.\n\nIt contains 39 demarcated villages, of which 27 belong to the Raikw\u00e1r Taluqdar, Th\u00e1kur Gum\u00e1n Singh, of R\u00e1mpur Mathura, and eight, once belonging to the rebel R\u00e1ja of Chahl\u00e1ri, have been recently conferred on R\u00e1na Raghr\u00e1j Singh, son of Beni M\u00e1dho, the Baisw\u00e1ra chieftain, whose estates were confiscated for complicity in the mutiny. The remaining four villages belong to petty zemindars.\n\nThe acreage of the pargana is as follows:\n\n| Cultivated | 25,296 acres. |\n|------------|---------------|\n| Culturable | 8,082 \"       |\n| Mu\u00e1fi      | 52 \"          |\n| Barren     | 9,150 \"       |\n| Total      | 42,510 \"      |\nand the revenue demand as recently assessed falls thus:\n\n| On cultivated | Rs. 0 14 0 |\n|---------------|------------|\n| On assessed   | Rs. 0 11 0 |\n| On whole area | Rs. 0 8 8 |\n\nwhich on account of the character of the pargana and the nature of the soil, as above described, is less than in the other parganas of this tahsil.\n\nThe census of 1869 shows the population to be as follows:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | Rs. 16,397 |\n|----------------------|------------|\n| non-agricultural     | Rs. 10,985 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | Rs. 749 |\n| non-agricultural     | Rs. 1,262 |\n| Total                | Rs. 29,393 |\n\nThese figures inform us that the Musalmans are only 7 per cent. of the entire population,\u2014a very low average indeed. There are 445 souls to the square mile, which also is something below the provincial average of 476. There are 5\u00bd souls to each house. To each head of the agricultural population there are acres 1\u00b75 of cultivation, and acres 1\u00b79 of assessed land, which shows that there is room for improvement. The pargana does not boast of a single road, but it has excellent water communication in the rivers described above. The only town of importance is R\u00e1mpur (q. v.), the residence of the taluqdar, the population of which is 2,217. Some five miles to the north of it is mauza Mathura, containing the remains of what was once a considerable fort.\n\nThere are in this pargana no melas or fairs, or any bazar at which anything but the ordinary necessaries of life is sold. There are no public buildings. The only public institution is the school at R\u00e1mpur, and the pargana is uninteresting to a degree.\n\nIt, with North-Kundri, constituted pargana Kundri as formed by Sa\u00e1dat Khan, the Subahdar of Oudh, in 1739 A.D. It was made up of the following villages from the neighbouring parganas:\n\n- From pargana Bas\u00e1ra: 309 villages.\n- From pargana S\u00e1l\u00edk: 149 villages.\n- From pargana Sadpur: 9 villages.\n- From pargana Tambaur: 168 villages.\n\nand thus contained 535 villages. The new pargana was conferred in j\u00e1g\u00edr upon one Mirza Ism\u00e1il Beg alias Shekhz\u00e1da W\u00e1l\u00e1j\u00e1h; but it was resumed soon after, and the original zamindars were not again interfered with.\n\nThe name Kundri is derived from \u201ckundar,\u201d which means land lying between two streams, whether those streams are part of the same river or belong to two distinct rivers. In the beginning the inhabitants were Bhars, Kurmis, and Raghubansi, and the local tradition has it that 680 years ago two brothers, B\u00e1l and S\u00e1l (or Sy\u00e1l), came from their native town Raika in the Jum moo territory and drove out the Bhars, who, under their leaders Kap\u00far Dhar and S\u00e1rang Dhar, were ravaging the country. B\u00e1l and S\u00e1l, his brother, took possession of the district, and they divided it, B\u00e1l taking the northern parts and S\u00e1l the southern. The descendants of both are extant.\nto the present day; those of S\u00e1l in pargana R\u00e1mnagar, district Bara Banki, and those of B\u00e1l in pargana Kundri, and across the Gogra in Bahraich. In Kundri the representatives were the R\u00e1ja of Chahl\u00e1ri, who was slain in the mutiny fighting against us at Nawabganj, the R\u00e1o of Mall\u00e1pur and the Th\u00e1kur of R\u00e1mpur abovementioned. In Bahraich the R\u00e1ja of Baundi was head of the family. His estates were like those of Chahl\u00e1ri confiscated for rebellion. Pargana Sailuk mentioned above is said to take its name from S\u00e1l. This hero, with his brothers, was a connection of the R\u00e1thor king of Kanauj, Jai Chand, and it was under his auspices that the Raikw\u00e1r brothers invaded the country. S\u00e1l was, it is said, so mighty a hero, that his power was felt from Si\u00e1lkot, or S\u00e1l\u2019s fort in the Punjab, to Sailuk, in what is now known as district Bara Banki.\n\n**KUNSA Town\u2014Pargana RAE BARELI\u2014Tahsil RAE BARELI\u2014District RAE BARELI**\n\nThis village, which ranks as a town on account of possessing a large population, is of little importance in other respects. The number of Hindus is 5,352, and that of Musalmans 129. These reside in 870 houses, all mud-built. This village has 24 hamlets. Brahmans predominate. The name of the founder is lost in obscurity. There are no bazars, noteworthy buildings, or manufactures of any kind.\n\n* **KURAUNA Parguna\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.**\u2014Kurauna is a small pargana lying to the immediate east of Aurangabad and in the centre of the tahsil. It contains 51 demarcated villages, which include four grants, and is 46 square miles in area, which is thus distributed:\n\n| Cultivated area | ... | ... | 17,814 acres |\n|-----------------|-----|-----|--------------|\n| Cultivable \"    | ... | ... | 6,597 \"      |\n| Mu\u00e1\u00e1 \"          | ... | ... | 2,469 \"      |\n| Barren \"        | ... | ... | 2,614 \"      |\n| Total           | ... | ... | 29,324       |\n\nIncidence of jama on cultivated Rs. 1 9 11\n\" on m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri \"... \"... 1 2 4\n\" on total area \"... \"... 1 0 2\n\nThe population at the Census of 1860 was as follows:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | 8,983 |\n|----------------------|-----|-----|-------|\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | 5,501 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | 48   |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | 275   |\n| Total                | ... | ... | 14,807 |\n\nand these 14,807 live in 2,836 houses. These figures give the percentage of 322 souls to the square mile\u2014a low ratio.\n\nTwo souls to each house, 2\u00b72 Musalmans out of every hundred of the entire population\u2014a very low percentage indeed; 1\u00b79 acres of cultivation and 2\u00b76 of m\u00e1lguz\u00e1ri land to each head of the agricultural population, which shows that there is very considerable room for development.\n\n*By Mr. Ferrar, Assistant Commissioner.*\nThe soil of Kurauna is good, much better on the whole than that of any other pargana in the tahsil, with the exception of Machhrehta, and the percentage of first class crops is large. The irrigation is almost entirely from wells, as the jhils are very few in number, and no streams intersect the pargana, which might be utilized for the purpose. There is only one road, that which connects Nimkh\u00e1r with Machhrehta. There is no water communication, the stream Baita which separates it from Machhrehta being unnavigable. There are two bazars held bi-weekly at Kurauna and Nagwa Jair\u00e1m, but nothing save the ordinary necessaries of life are sold at either. The pargana boasts of one fair held annually in March at Jargaw\u00e1n, one of the places visited by the Nimkh\u00e1r pilgrims on their \"Paikarma\" (vide town Misrikh). There are no mines or quarries in the pargana: nor are there any notable manufactures carried on, nor does it produce anything out of the common.\n\nThe pargana is called Kurkhila in the Ain-i-Akbari, and was known under native rule as \"Kurkhila alias Kurauna,\" both words being the names of two distinct towns, five miles from each other. Kurauna being eighteen miles south from Sitapur and five miles east of Kurkhila. The name in either case has for root the Sanskrit word \"kar\" meaning a hand, from which also is named the \"karj\u00fara\" or \"hand-joining\" tank at Jargaw\u00e1n,\u2014i.e., \"the village of the joining;\" and tradition tells us that very many centuries ago one of the kings of the Solar dynasty having had the misfortune to lose both his hands, had them restored by bathing in the waters of this tank, which ever since has been known by the name it now bears.\n\nThe old zamindars were, it is said, P\u00e1s\u00eds; and here again, as in the case of Khairabad and L\u00e1harpur, we find that the members of that tribe were once of a station in life very different to that which they now enjoy. Some 400 years ago they were driven out by an invasion of Janw\u00e1r Rajputs, whose descendants, represented by Deo Singh and M\u00e1dho Singh, still own the greater part of the pargana, including Kurauna and Jargaw\u00e1n. The 51 villages of the pargana are thus distributed,\u201432 Janw\u00e1r, 10 Moslem, 3 K\u00e1yath, 2 Gosh\u00e1n, 4 newly-formed grants. The 10 villages marked Moslem, known as \"Il\u00e1qa Kull\u00ed,\" are held by Muhammad Husen Khan, who acquired them in 1855 A.D. in mortgage from the original Janw\u00e1r proprietors. This gentleman is a taluqdar, and owns also Il\u00e1qa R\u00e9j\u00e1p\u00e1ra in the neighbouring pargana of Machhrehta. He is a Sayyad from zila Budaun, and was a chakladar of Khairabad prior to annexation.\n\nThe history of Deo Singh and M\u00e1dho Singh's family has been lost, and nothing is known about them save that their ancestors came into the country four centuries ago from Janakpur in Tirhoot. They themselves are the sons of Raghun\u00e1th Singh, who died full of years in 1256 fasli (1850 A.D.), after having enjoyed his estate for 72 years. His father before him, M\u00e1khan Singh, was in possession for even a longer period, for he held the property for 75 years. Such an instance of longevity, a father and son holding their estate for a century and a half, is without parallel in this part of Oudh, and would probably be difficult to match elsewhere. Even Raghun\u00e1th Singh did not die in his bed, for he was slain with his eldest son, Dul\u00e1r Singh, when defending his house against the attack of the Khairabad chakladar's troops. His other two sons escaped, and recovered\nthe estate in the following year (1851 A.D). Kurauna itself contains 1,125 inhabitants, but has no remains of antiquity to show. Indeed, the tank of K\u00e1j\u00fara above mentioned is the only thing extant which goes to prove the ancient existence of any human beings in the pargana.\n\n**KURHA KESHUPUR or DARSHANNAGAR\u2014Pargana Haweli, Oudh\u2014Tahsil Fyzabad.\u2014District Fyzabad.**\u2014This place was founded by one Kodmal Chhatti; it lies on the road from Fyzabad to Akbarpur, and the railway passes through it. It is four miles from Fyzabad. The population consists of 2,372 Hindus, and 358 Musalmans, of whom 180 are Shias. It is a place of sun worship, there being a tank and temple sacred to that luminary. There are also one temple to Mah\u00e1deo and one to Debi. A mosque and a vernacular school also exist. It is called Darshannagar, because re-settled by Darshan Singh, the father of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh.\n\n**KURSAT\u2014Pargana Safipur\u2014Tahsil Safipur\u2014District Unao.**\u2014Is ten miles north of Safipur and twenty-eight miles north-west of Unao. The Sai waters it, running one mile to the north. The town of As\u00edwan is distant about four miles towards the south-east.\n\nThe exact date of its foundation is unknown, but it is certain it was founded by Quds-ud-d\u00edn, the great ancestor of the present zamindar Kar\u00edm Bakhsh. Being founded by Quds-ud-d\u00edn, it was originally called Qudsat now changed to Kursat. Formerly there stood a village here called Khajuriya in the possession of a tribe called the Shahids, who were a very turbulent race, and addicted to pillage and robbery. Quds-ud-d\u00edn was sent here as subahdar to suppress and disperse them by B\u00e1bar, king of Delhi, the grandfather of the great Akbar. The town was laid siege to, reduced, and the country all laid waste. The subahdar then reclaimed the village, calling it Kursat after his own name. D\u00e1\u00fad Khan and Said-ulla Khan, Afgh\u00e1ns, and some other Shekh Musalmans, who had accompanied the army and had assisted in the expulsion of the abovementioned tribe, divided the conquered land with Quds-ud-d\u00edn; half fell to the share of the general and the other half was equally divided between the Shekhs and Afgh\u00e1ns, who each had one-fourth of the whole land. This division has been much disputed ever since. The descendants of the conquerors still hold their shares. The soil mostly consists of loam and clay, and a small proportion of sand. The scenery is pleasant, the land level, the climate healthy, and the water mostly good; there is a little jungle towards the west.\n\nIn addition to the fight noted above, there was in 1840 A.D. a war between Shekh Kar\u00edm Bakhsh and L\u00e1la Badrin\u00e1th, chakladar of the Oudh government. The remains of a fort still exist belonging formerly to the Shah\u00edd tribe. There is now a school numbering 30 scholars\u20143 Hindus and 27 Musalmans. There is a market here held weekly.\n\n*Latitude 26\u00b0 40' north; longitude 80\u00b0 25' east.*\n\n**Population:**\n\n| Hindu | ... | ... | 3,719 |\n|-------|-----|-----|-------|\n| Musalman | ... | ... | 1,654 |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | 5,373 |\n\nOne mosque and 1,091 mud-built houses; market sales annually Rs. 2,233.\nKURSAT KAL\u00c1N*\u2014Pargana MALL\u00c1NWAN\u2014Tahsil BILGR\u00c1M\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Population 2,689, chiefly Kanaujia Brahmans; a fine village; is owned by Kurmis; and lies near the right bank of the Sai, nine miles north-east from M\u00e4ll\u00e1nwan; it contains 524 mud houses.

(See B\u00e1wan pargana.)\n\nKURSI*\u2014Pargana\u2014Tahsil FATEHPUR\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014The pargana of Kursi lies to the east of Mahona, and was, before its transfer to the district of Bara Banki in 1869, the centre one of three parganas which were administered from Kursi, its headquarters town. It is of very irregular shape, the bulk of it lying to the north, and cut almost in two at its centre by a corner of the Mahona pargana that projects into it on its western side, reducing its breadth across, at this point, to no more than two miles, while its length from extreme north to south is not less than seventeen or eighteen miles. The town of Kursi is situated, at its narrowest part, on the road from Mahona to Dewa in latitude 27\u00b08', longitude 81\u00b09'. On the north it is bounded by the Sitapur district, on the east by parganas Fatehpur and Dewa, on the whole of its west by Mahona pargana. Rivers it has none, but its north is well studded with jhils, and a line of them commencing at its north-west corner culminate in the Kaly\u00e1ni nadi, which, crossing the pargana in an easterly direction, shortly takes a bend to the south-east, and becomes the boundary line of the pargana as far as Dewa.\n\nThe traffic of the pargana passes through Kursi by two good roads, which run one south from Mahmudabad on the north to Lucknow, where it crosses into the city by the iron bridge, and the other east from the Lucknow and Sitapur road, through Mahona and Kursi, to Dewa, and onwards to Bara Banki.\n\nThe population of Kursi is 3,650. It was formerly the headquarters of the pargana; but since its transfer to the district of Bara Banki the Government offices have been removed, and there remains only the police station, a post-office, and a school.\n\nThe next place of importance is Mausar, but chiefly for the market-place of Tikaitganj which was built on its lands. This bazar is situated two\n\n* By Arthur Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. H. H. Butts, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nmiles to the north of Kursi on the Mahmudabad road. The largest market in the neighbourhood is held here, and the yearly sales are said to amount to Rs. 66,000. The population of the village and ganj amounts to 4,240. Besides there are only three villages\u2014Khingna, Bharauli, Arauri\u2014that contain a population of over 1,000. The area of the pargana is eighty-nine square miles, and it contains ninety-one villages, averaging in area six hundred and twenty-five acres. The soil of the pargana is very good and fertile. The following figures will show how the cultivated land is made up:\n\n78 per cent. is 1st class or loam;\n21 per cent. is 2nd class or clay.\n\nThe culturable is thirty-five per cent., and lies chiefly to the north of the pargana where population is very sparse. It is all of it good land, and will, when cultivators are brought up, quickly fall under the plough. Only 11\u00b76 per cent. of its area is uncultivable, and two-thirds of this is taken up by roads, village sites, and jhils.\n\nIrrigation is very fair; it amounts to sixty per cent., but so much as ninety-three per cent. of this is from jhils. Jhils lie thick through the northern parts of the pargana, and a great deal of irrigation is carried on from the Kaly\u00e1ni river. But it is unlikely that only seven per cent. of the irrigated lands is watered from wells. Water lies only seventeen feet from the surface, and nine feet of water lie in the wells.\n\nTo the south of Kursi the pargana is very thickly peopled, and in great part by Muhammadans. With its clayey soil, and want of cultivators, the cultivation to the north of the pargana is poor, but to the south it is very fine. All the cereals are grown, and sugarcane and the Kachhi crops lie thick round the village, and very little of the ground is left uncultivated.\n\nRents range from Rs. 4-14-0 to Rs. 5-8-0 per acre. Brahmans, Chhattris, and Ahirs, all from Rs. 5 to Rs. 6-8, and Kachhis, who are fairly numerous, pay Rs. 9-10, Musalmans pay Rs. 5-5.\n\nThe assessment fixed at summary settlement was Rs. 42,700. The revised demand is Rs. 74,650.\n\nThe revenue rate falls at Rs. 2\u00b77 on cultivated.\nDitto ditto \" 1\u00b78 on cultivated and culturable.\nDitto ditto \" 1\u00b78 throughout.\n\nThe population is 37,459, sparse towards the north, as already observed, but dense in the south. It is thus divided:\n\nMusalmans ... ... 17\u00b73 per cent. of the whole.\nHindus ... ... 82\u00b77\nAgriculturists ... ... 58\u00b77\nNon-agriculturists ... ... 41\u00b73\n\nThe proportion of Musalmans in this pargana is high. They are in greatest strength on the south, where all the village communities are Musalman, but the Musalman element is strong throughout the pargana. It is due to its history, which will be noticed.\nThe earliest inhabitants of the pargana are said to have been the Bhars. Tradition assigns to them the founding of Mausar, Ukhri, Chakia, and Chulhia, which they named from four common articles of domestic use\u2014from m\u00fasal, a pestle, ukhli, a mortar, chakia, a mill, chulha, an oven. But the village of Chulhia has disappeared. Mausar or Mahsand is built on a very high d\u012bh. These Bhars seem to have been contemporaneous with, or to have succeeded to, the Janw\u0101rs of Saindur\u2014a village to the north of the pargana on the left bank of the Kaly\u0101ni. Somehow they seem to have helped in the resistance to Sayyad Masa\u016bd\u2019s invasion in A.D. 1030. Yet the Musalmans say that they were opposed by no one but Bhars, and different parts of the country, colonized long after this time, seem to have been held only by Bhars. Janw\u0101rs or Bhars, it is certain that they are of very old standing in the pargana, and long preceded any of the other Rajput colonies of this district. The Janw\u0101rs themselves claim to be of very ancient descent, being content with no less an ancestor than R\u0101ja Juj\u0101t, of the Satya-yug who built J\u0101jmau on the banks of the Ganges. They say that their kingdom extended east to the hills, south to Benares, and west to the Ganges. And that R\u0101jas B\u0101sdeo and Suphaldeo, of their line, fought Sayyad Masa\u016bd Gh\u0113zi at Bahraich, and that Udebh\u0101n, at a later date, opposed another of the Delhi emperors. Their possessions extend to this day into the adjoining pargana of Dewa, and their village of Saindur must at one time have been of great extent. The site of it lies high, overlooking a deep jhil, from the excavation of which it must have been formed, and is now overgrown with dense jungle, which they look upon as too sacred to be touched.\n\nThe tribe of Sainduria Rajputs, who have colonized a large tract of country in Sitapur, assert that they are sprung and derive their name from the Rajputs of Saindur.\n\nBut at an early date they seem to have been confined to the left bank of the Kaly\u0101ni; for previous to the first Musalman invasion came the Parih\u0101rs, who colonized sixty-two villages to the south of the Kaly\u0101ni, reaching down to Kursi and Mah\u0101g\u0101on, in the present Mahona pargana. The Panw\u0101rs of the latter place hold some of their villages, but the Parih\u0101rs have not forgotten them.\n\nThe Parih\u0101rs fixed their headquarters at Ghugt\u012br, where they built a large fort, and brick-covered d\u012bhs of great extent may be seen there still, which mark its site. They gave way, however, before the Musalmans of Kursi\u2014wickedly assisted, as they say, by the Mahona Panw\u0101rs,\u2014and were pushed up north to Ahm\u0101mau, which they have kept to this day. Then came the Musalman settlement of Salembad, at whose hands they suffered a further loss. This colony also has disappeared, and it is hard to trace its history. It may perhaps be placed at the commencement of the thirteenth century, for it is said they got a grant of twenty villages from Qutb-ud-d\u012bn Ibak. The estate was long known as the tappa of Salembad.\n\nTheir leader was Sayyad Q\u0101sim Hamza of Naish\u0101pur. Later on in the line, Sayyad Far\u016bl, son of Niz\u0101m-ud-d\u012bn, married a daughter of Shekh\nMuhammad, son of Shekh Mustafa; Abbasi or Kaiqubadi Shekh of Kursi, who held the office of chaudhri of the pargana. Shekh Muhammad had no other child, and the Sayyad secured the office of chaudhri, and the royal farm\u00e1n, which had been issued by the Emperor Akbar in name of Shekh Mustafa, was made over to him, and is still held by his descendants. Sayyad Bhikha, of the same line, got another farm\u00e1n from Muhammad Shah in 1138 A.H. (A.D. 1726), but shortly after this the decay of the Sayyads began, and they gave place to an energetic family of Rajputs of the Khenchi tribe, who, it is said, began life by taking service with the Sayyads, but in the end succeeded in ousting them from their villages. They had previously also lost the chaudhrship which had again reverted to the Shekhs of Kursi.\n\nThere is a mystery hanging over this last-named family. They do not seem to belong to the original Kaiqub\u00e1di colonists, and some say they are converted Hindus; but another and more probable account is that they are illegitimately descended from the daughters of a Bais family of Boloiya in Sitapur, for whom they had stood security, and who, failing to meet their engagements, were attacked by the Sayyads, who harried and burned their villages, and carried off one of the daughters of their house, from whom the present family is descended. It is currently believed now that there are occasions on which they present offerings to a Hindu god in Boloiya. To Muhammad Mustafa, already mentioned, is given this place in their history, and from that time their kinsmen, the Kaiqub\u00e1dis, would have nothing to do with them. They flourished notwithstanding. They held Ghugtir, the old headquarters of Parih\u00e1rs and other villages, and Nind\u00fara, which belonged to the Janw\u00e1rs of Dar\u00e1wan, another branch of the Saind\u00far Janw\u00e1rs, and they built a village called D\u00ednpan\u00e1h, \"the defence of the faith.\" Another branch of the family, at present represented by Chaudhri Abd-ur-Razz\u00e1q, held Chilg\u00e1on, the nucleus of forty villages. And Chaudhri Mus\u00e1hib Ali and Abd-ur-Rah\u00edm, Taluqdars of D\u00ednpan\u00e1h, are their direct descendants. The Musalmans have altogether proved strong in this pargana.\n\nAnother Musalman colony of note, that of Mausar, came into the pargana at probably the beginning of the fourteenth century, and on the south of the pargana are various scattered Musalman communities, who date their history from the time of Sayyad Mas\u00e1ud's invasion of A.D. 1030. It is not probable that they are of so early a date, though not unlikely that they were thrown out at different times from Satrikh, which for a long time seems to have sent out colonies to various places in the neighbourhood. The cause for the unusual predominance of the Musalman element has thus been shown. They hold forty out of the ninety-one villages of the pargana; the rest are held chiefly by Rajputs.\n\nThe only two taluqdars are Mus\u00e1hib Ali and Abd-ur-Rah\u00edm of D\u00ednpan\u00e1h, who hold jointly an estate of some six villages.\n\nWhen or why Kursi was first constituted as a pargana is unknown. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, and the town of Kursi is said to have a brick fort. In the Naw\u00e1bi it formed part of a chakla consisting of Kursi, Dewa, Jah\u00e1ng\u00edrabad, Satrikh, and Nawabganj.\nPargana families.\u2014Chaudhri Mus\u00e1hib Ali and Kar\u00edm Bakhsh, joint taluqdars of D\u00ednpan\u00e1h belong to the qasba of Kursi. They are descended from Muhammad Mustafa, who, in the time of Akbar, was made chaudhri of the pargana.\n\nThey now hold six villages assessed at Rs. 7,848-8-0.\n\nThey are half of Kursi, Bhadasia, Kh\u00e1gipur, D\u00ednpan\u00e1h, Khars\u00e1ra, Ghug-t\u00edr, Bachgahni.\n\nThe pedigree is:\n\n```\nMuhammad Muhs\u00edn.\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Farid.\n      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Muhammad S\u00e1lih.\n          \u2514\u2500\u2500 Razi.\n              \u2514\u2500\u2500 Muhammad Mustafa.\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Shekh Muhammad Ham\u00edd.\n                      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Man\u00edm Z\u00e1min.\n                          \u2514\u2500\u2500 Asad-ulla.\n                              \u2514\u2500\u2500 Abu Tur\u00e1b.\n                                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Sa\u00e1dat Ali.\n                                      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Ghul\u00e1m Murtaza.\n                                          \u2514\u2500\u2500 Mus\u00e1hib Ali.\n                                              \u2514\u2500\u2500 Kar\u00edm Bakhsh.\n                                                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 J\u00e1far Ali.\n                                                      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Hasan All.\n                                                          \u2514\u2500\u2500 Q\u00e1s\u00edm Ali.\n                                                              \u2514\u2500\u2500 Kar\u00edm Bakhsh.\n                                                                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Nabi Bakhsh.\n                                                                      \u2514\u2500\u2500 Abd-ul-Rah\u00edm.\n                                                                          \u2514\u2500\u2500 Abd-ul Hak\u00edm.\n                                                                              \u2514\u2500\u2500 Razz\u00e1q Bakhsh.\n                                                                                  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Mehnd\u00ed Hus\u00e9n.\n                                                                                      \u2514\u2500\u2500 H\u00e1d\u00ed Hus\u00e9n.\n```\n\nThe Khenchis of Dhaurahra (Gotr Buch).\u2014This is a family of Rajputs holding an estate of seventeen villages, or 8\u00bd by recent demarcation, to the north of the pargana. They came under R\u00e1ja Singh, some seven generations ago.\n\nR\u00e1ja Singh is said to have taken service with the Sayyads of Salemabad. These Sayyads had colonized a tract of twenty-two villages, which was known as the tappa of Salemabad. One by one the Khenchis got possession of them. R\u00e1ja Singh took an old deserted Bhar d\u00edh, called Dhaurahra; it appears he got it on mortgage. There he built him a house and founded a hamlet. This was all that was done for a time; but by the third generation their family had acquired several more of the Sayyad villages by similar transfers. M\u00edr Ahmad Hasan, otherwise M\u00edr B\u00e1nke, of the Sayyad house, then attacked the Khenchis, and killed seven of hem. But three boys escaped, and went to their uncle Kenwal Singh,\nwho had taken service with the Ool R\u00e1ja of Kheri. By his help they recovered Dhaurahra and their other villages. They re-established themselves, and being thrifty and making money, they lent to the Sayyads who were prodigal and spent it, and so the mortgaging went on. Koeli Singh got two or three more, and Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh, the present holder, succeeded in getting the whole estate but three villages.\n\nThe Sayyads had tried force, and they now tried law. They brought the matter before the Lucknow courts and got a decree in 1251 fasli (A.D. 1844,) declaring that all the deeds were forged. Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh would not produce them. Perhaps he thought they were safer in his own hands. But he had to bolt, and the Sayyads, with the help of R\u00e1ja Bisr\u00e1m Singh of Mah\u00e1g\u00e1n, got possession and harried the villages for three months; but Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh harried too, seizing his tenants, ploughs and beasts, and threatening all who consented to cultivate under the Sayyads. Finally the place was deserted, and the minister, Munawwar-ud-daula, sent p\u00e1n leaves to Z\u00e1l\u00edm, and asked him to return to his estate. So he came back; but the Sayyads tried law a second time, and for the second time, three years before the annexation, got an order granting their possession. This time Z\u00e1l\u00edm Singh staved off the blow, and he holds his estate assessed at Rs. 7,750 still.\n\nKURSI\u2014Pargana KURSI\u2014Tahsil Fatehpur\u2014District Bara Banki.\u2014Kursi is the headquarter town of the Kursi pargana, sixteen miles from Lucknow, and eighteen from its district town of Bara Banki. It is crossed by two roads, one running north from Lucknow which passes on to Mahmudabad and Bisw\u00e1n in the Sitapur district, and the other west from Bara Banki, which joins the imperial road from Lucknow to Sitapur. Its population, is 3,650, and it contains a police station, Government school, registration, and post offices. The population is more than half Musalman; and the weaving and cotton cleaning trades flourish, but no bazar is held here; samples of agricultural produce only are brought to what market there is. The town has long belonged to Musalman proprietors, but it is said to have been built by two Bhars, Khush\u00e1l and Mith\u00e1n, one of whom gave his name to Kursi, and the other to the village of Mith\u00e1n, some four miles east of it.\n\nBut another legend refers the foundation of the town to Kesri Dait, one of the servants of B\u00e1n\u00edsur Dait, who lived at Rukh\u00e1ra near Mahona; and the old fort, the site of which can still be seen, is said to have been called the Kesrigarh. Kesri drove down a beam of s\u00e1khu wood into a tank called Songar, and offered to wrestle any one that could pull it out, but it has remained there unmoved to this day, and no one who has dug for it can reach its foundation. Still another tradition refers the foundation of the town to Lav and Kus, sons of Sri R\u00e1m Chandra, who built it in the Treta-yug, and the town was for some time called Kuslav\u00ed. These traditions are probably only due to the fanciful ideas of the natives who are addicted to such speculations. The origin is probably Bhar; for the same people are believed to have inhabited the Dewa pargana which adjoins this to the east, and to have been overrun by Rajput leaders acting under the authority of the Kanauj king.\nOf the population 1,753 are Muhammadans, and 1,560 are Hindus. The bazar sales amount to Rs. 24,443.\n\nThe place was formerly in the possession of Kaiqub\u00e1di Moslems, but since the time of Akbar Shah, the ancestors of the present holder have held the place.\n\n**LAKHARPUR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Pargana L\u00e1harpur is 22 miles in length and 14 at its greatest breadth; its superficial area is 191 square miles, of which 133 are cultivated, and it contains 165 demarcated villages. It is bounded on the north by zila Kheri, on the east and south by parganas Bisw\u00e1n and Tambaur, and on the west by parganas Harg\u00e1m and Khairabad, from which latter the little stream known as the Gon divides it.\n\nThe soil for the most part is a fine dumat in the southern half of the pargana, which is separated from the northern half by a ridge of land from 10 to 30 feet in height, and running from the north-west to the southeast. The lands north of this are known as tar\u00e1i lands, and are of that stiff soil called mati\u00e1r, which in some parts is excessively wet and greasy, and in others dries into rock-like clods, upon which none of the ordinary implements of cultivation are able to make much effect, and which do not crumble even under the foot of an elephant. This tar\u00e1i land does not require irrigation, for water is found at 4 or 5 feet from the surface. In other parts it is not found often until 32 feet in depth have been dug.\n\nThe area of the pargana in acres is 122,730, which are thus classified:\n\n| Category       | Acres |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Cultivated     | 85,179|\n| Cultivable     | 18,438|\n|                | **104,617 m\u00e1lguzari.** |\n| Mu\u00e1fi          | 976   |\n| Barren         | 17,137|\n|                | **18,013 unassessed.** |\n\nand the revenue demand falls thus:\n\n| Description            | Rs. a. p. |\n|------------------------|-----------|\n| On cultivated land     | 1 6 9     |\n| On m\u00e1lguzari           | 1 1 10    |\n| On total area          | 0 15 2    |\n\nThe population appears from the census of 1869 to be\u2014\n\n| Description            | Number   |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Hindus, agricultural   | 27,929   |\n| \" non-agricultural     | 27,615   |\n| Musalmans, agricultural| 3,649    |\n| \" non-agricultural     | 15,517   |\n| **Grand Total**        | **84,730 living in 15,978 houses.** |\n\nBy Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThese figures show that there are 444 souls to each square mile, and 5\u00b73 to each house; that the Musalmans are 23 per cent. of the entire population which is more than double that of the provincial average, and that to each head of agricultural population there are 2 acres of cultivated and 2\u00bd of m\u0101lguz\u0101ri land. They also show the extraordinary fact that more than half the population is non-agricultural, which is scarcely credible.\n\nThere are three rivers in the pargana\u2014namely, the Gon, the Kew\u00e1ni, and the Ghaghar. The first-mentioned separates the pargana from Khairabad, is bridged in two places\u2014first, at Kasraila on the high road from L\u00e1harpur to Khairabad, and secondly, at Dhamaura on a cross road. The former bridge was built 45 years ago by Makka Darzi, and the latter in 1860 by Chaudhri R\u00e1m Narain, the taluqdar of Mubarakpur. It is a very insignificant stream, drying up in many places during the hot weather. The second river, the Kew\u00e1ni, is larger than the Gon. In many parts it has the appearance of a good navigable river, in others, towards the source, it dries up in the hot weather. The last-mentioned or Ghaghar has more water in it than either of the other two; in some parts it can be crossed only by boats even in the dry season.\n\nThe principal mart of the pargana is at Kesriganj, two miles west from the chief town of the pargana. Merchants come from the North-Western Provinces, and there are some Moradabad tradesmen settled in the ganj. There are also daily bazars held in L\u00e1harpur itself.\n\nThe pargana is crossed from west to east by the road from Harg\u00e1m, and from south to north by the road from Khairabad. The former runs on through L\u00e1harpur Khas to Bisw\u00e1n.\n\nThe pargana was formed by R\u00e1ja Todar Mal, the D\u00edw\u00e1n or agent of Akbar's celebrated Wazir, Sh\u00e1h Mans\u00far, out of the lands of 13 tappas, containing 765 villages. Two tappas were transferred to Bisw\u00e1n in 1175 fasil, or 104 years ago. There are now 165 demarcated villages or 176 muh\u00e1ls, which are held under the following tenures:\u2014Taluqdari 104, zamindari 72; and out of the 165 townships 115 are held by five men as follows:\u2014R\u00e1ja Shiu Bakhsh Singh 50, Naw\u00e1b Amjad Ali Khan 23, Th\u00e1kur Fazl Ali 20, Th\u00e1kur Beni Singh 12, Th\u00e1kur Pahalw\u00e1n Singh 10, of whom the first three are taluqdars.\n\nThe principal castes among the landed proprietors are Gaur and Janw\u00e1r Chhattirs, the former holding 105 villages, and the latter 13. These latter are known as Saindurias, from Saindur in pargana Kursi, and they came into L\u00e1harpur before the Gaurs invaded it in 1707 (10 A.D.). In addition to the 13 villages which they hold direct from the state, they possess several villages in sub-settlement under Naw\u00e1b Amjad Ali Khan.\n\nThe Gaurs are descendants from that R\u00e1ja Chandar Sen who invaded Sitapur during the anarchy which ensued on the Emperor Alamgr\u00ed's death in 1707 A.D. Mah\u00e1bali, the ancestor of Th\u00e1kur Fazl Ali abovementioned, was a Gaur, but was converted to Isl\u00e1m in the time of Naw\u00e1b Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula. He was great great-grand-father to the present taluqdar.\nThe history of the pargana is intimately connected with that of the town itself. Where it stands, the Emperor Firoz Tughlaq is said to have founded a town in 1370 A.D., when on his way to the shrine of the Sayyad S\u00e1\u00edr at Bahraich. Thirty years subsequently one L\u00e1hari, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, took possession of it and changed the name to L\u00e1harpur. He did not continue long to enjoy his power, for in 1418 one Shekh T\u00e1hir Gh\u00e1zi slew him in battle and exterminated the P\u00e1s\u00eds. He and his descendants remained in possession down to the invasion of the Gaurs above mentioned. If this account is correct, it goes to show, as in the case of pargana Khairabad, that four hundred years ago the P\u00e1s\u00eds boasted a very different status to that which they now enjoy.\n\nIn addition to the festivals and fairs of L\u00e1harpur, Kh\u00e1s (q.v.) are the following:\n\n**In Daryapur.**\u2014\u201cChhota Bahraich-ka-mela,\u201d held in Jeth in memory of Sayyad S\u00e1\u00edr.\n\n**In R\u00e1japur.**\u2014At the tank of Todar Mal.\n\n**In Akbarpur.**\u2014At the tank of the sun, (S\u00far\u00e1jkund), in K\u00e1rtik and Jeth.\n\n**In T\u00e1hirpur.**\u2014At \u201cMah\u00e1deo Jangli N\u00e1th.\u201d\n\n**Lachhmannagar.**\u2014At \u201cMath S\u00edtla Debi.\u201d\n\n**In Kesriganj.**\u2014A bathing at the tank.\n\n**In T\u00e1lgdon.**\u2014In Bh\u00e1don in memory of a famous wrestler Pir Zain-ul-\u00c1bid\u00edn.\n\nAt the last-mentioned as many as 10 or 12 thousand people assemble; at none of the others more than half that number.\n\nThere are no special manufactures carried on in this pargana, nor are there any mines or quarries. In Pursia and Kishunpur kankar is dug up in considerable quantities, and lime manufactured therefrom. The productive powers of the soil are a good average. No crop peculiar to the pargana is produced.\n\nPargana L\u00e1harpur is included in the list of muh\u00e1ls constituting in the \u00c1\u00edn-i-\u00c1kbari the Sark\u00e1r of Khairabad. R\u00e1ja Todar Mal mentioned above is believed by the people of L\u00e1harpur to have been a native of that town, and his memory is still preserved in the name of the village (R\u00e1japur) called after him. Mr. Blochmann (in his translation of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-\u00c1kbari, Volume I, page 351) states, on apparently good authority, that he was born at Lahore, the capital of the Punj\u00e1b. The similarity in the names of the two towns is no doubt the cause of the confusion, but local tradition is precise that the father of Todar Mal was a Punj\u00e1bi Khattri, who married into a Chopri Khattri family in L\u00e1harpur, where the boy was born. Chopri Tola still exists in the town.\n\n**L\u00c1HARPUR Town,* Pargana L\u00c1HARPUR\u2014Tahsil SITAPUR\u2014District SITAPUR\u201427\u00b0 43' north, 80\u00b057' east\u2014is 17 miles north of Sitapur on a good unmetalled road, which goes on to Mall\u00e1pur on the Gogra.**\n\n*By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nIt is also connected by unmetalled roads with Harg\u00e1m on the west and Bisw\u00e1n on the south, and about 1\u00bd miles to the east the Kew\u00e1n\u00ed river runs down to the south, fordable in the dry weather, but navigable during the rest of the year.\n\nThe name of the town is said to be derived from Loh\u00e1ri, a P\u00e1s\u00ed, who changed the former name of Tughlaqpur to L\u00e1harpur. This was some 500 years ago. The town was originally founded by F\u00edroz Tughlaq, who reigned from 1351 to 1388 A.D., and who settled in it certain Kayaths and Musalmans, but they were expelled thirty years afterwards by the P\u00e1s\u00ed abovementioned. The descendants of the latter were exterminated 400 years ago by an army of Moslems headed by T\u00e1hir Gh\u00e1zi, who came from Kanauj. Subsequently, in 1707 A.D., the Gaur Chhattirs conquered the Moslems, since which time the town has to some extent decreased in size and importance. It is still, however, of considerable extent, and boasts of a population of 10,890 souls, almost equally divided between Hindus and Musalmans of all castes and sects.\n\nThe masonry houses are 104, and under the fostering care of the British Government the number is steadily increasing, the banker caste being the principal builders. The mud houses number 1,590. The public buildings consist of the usual police post, and registry offices, with the school building where 224 scholars attend, and a sar\u00e1e. Besides 13 mosques and 4 ordinary Hindu temples there are two N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi sangats, and four large Darg\u00e1hs. At one of which on 13th Rabi-ul-awal, the birthday of the Prophet, there is a large concourse of the faithful. There are good daily bazars in the town, the annual value of the sales being Rs. 40,000. There is one fair held in the town in Rabi-us-S\u00e1n\u00ed, and the Muharram is celebrated with great splendour. L\u00e1harpur is surrounded and interspersed with fine groves: the river Kew\u00e1n\u00ed adds to its natural attractions, and the earth is fresh and green. There are no manufactures. Todar Mal, Peshk\u00e1r to king Akbar's Waz\u00edr, Shah Mans\u00far, first saw light here, though an authority, quoted in Elphinstone's History of India, puts him down as having been a native of the Punj\u00e1b.\n\nLAKHIMPUR Town\u2014Pargana KHERI\u2014Tahsil LAKHYMPUR\u2014District KHERI\u2014Is situated at a distance of about one mile to the south of the Ul river. It is the headquarters of the Kheri district, and belongs to Balbhadhr Singh, taluqdar of Mahewa. There is a bazar known by the name of Thurburnganj, built in 1859-60 at the instance of Major Thurburn, late Deputy Commissioner of the district. The money applied to its construction was raised by subscription. There is a daily market; and also a special one which is held twice a week, on Mondays and Fridays. The annual average sale of European and native fabrics is estimated at Rs. 5,000. There is a mud-built sar\u00e1e, which was built by order of the Government in 1859 A.D.\n\nLakh\u00edmpur is picturesquely situated forty feet above the Ul, and at an elevation of 483 feet above the level of the sea. The soil is fertile, and the immediate neighbourhood is healthy. Fine groves crown the elevations on each side of the river. There are the usual offices for public business. A new masonry court-house has been erected. The jail is a mud-walled\nbuilding. Water is abundant at a depth of 40 feet. Masonry houses are being built and trade rapidly increasing.\n\nPopulation ... ... ... 1,654.\nHindus\u2014\nMale ... ... ... 671 } 1,328.\nFemale ... ... ... 657 }\nMuslims\u2014\nMale ... ... ... 172 } 326.\nFemale ... ... ... 154 }\n\nLALGANJ Town\u2014Pargana DALMAU\u2014Tahsil LALGANJ\u2014District RAEBARELL.\u2014This is a flourishing market town, six miles south-west of Dalmau, on the road from Barell to Bhitari Gh\u00e2t, district Fatehpur. There was an old dh\u00e2r or ancient village site here; Shiu Singh of Samarpha founded a village called Datauli; his descendant, Lal Singh, founded another, and their joint labours were called Datauli Lalganj. The climate is healthy, and the place is prosperous. The population is 2,602, of whom 617 are Bani\u00e2ns\u2014all alleged to be followers of Vishnu. A th\u00e2na and tahsil have been recently established here. There is a fine Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e2ra erected by the Thakur\u00e2in of Samarpha. The market is held twice a week, and is a great mart for all kinds of country produce.

III.\u2014THE PEOPLE. IV.\u2014ADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES. V.\u2014HISTORY.\n\nCHAPTER I.\nNATURAL FEATURES.\n\nPosition of district, boundaries, parganas, tahsils, transfer of parganas\u2014Aspect of district\u2014Land levels, drainage\u2014Water-shed\u2014Character of rivers\u2014Nature of the soil\u2014Distribution of cultivated, culturable, and barren lands\u2014Climate\u2014Rainfall\u2014Temperature\u2014Wind\u2014Storms\u2014Sanitary and medical aspects.\n\nThe district is somewhat irregular in shape, but nearly approaches an oblong pitched obliquely in a direction north-west by south-east across the 81st meridian, which passes through Lucknow, the capital of the province, at about its centre. It lies between 27\u00b0 12' and 26\u00b0 30' parallels of north latitude, and 80\u00b0 35' and 81\u00b0 18' east longitude. Its average length is about forty-five, miles and breadth twenty-five, and it contains an area of 955 square miles. The population amounts to 789,465.\n\nIt is bounded on the north-west by Hardoi and Sitapur, which are separated by the river Gumti up to its entrance into the district; on the north-east and east by the Bara Banki up to the easternmost point at which the Gumti leaves the district; and thence the border line bending slightly to the south-west by Rae Bareli; the entire length of its south-western flank is bounded by the district of Unao.\n\nThe parganas into which the district is divided form the units of its composition. These seldom appear to depend on any natural features, though the rivers Gumti and Sai may have determined the limits of two or three of the parganas which they bound and divide.\n\nThe district at the commencement of the settlement contained ten such parganas, distributed between the four tahsils of Lucknow, Kursi, Mohanlalganj, and Malihabad. They were distributed thus,\u2014to Lucknow three parganas; the Lucknow pargana lying round the city, Bijnaur and K\u00e1kori lying to the south and west of it; to Kursi three parganas, Mahona lying on the left bank of the river Gumti, Kursi and Dewa to the east of it; to Mohanlalganj two parganas, Mohanlalganj and Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi, that take up the south-east end of the district; and to Malihabad, the two parganas of Malihabad lying on the right bank of the Gumti and Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s, the most westerly pargana of the district. After the commencement of the settlement, its two most easterly parganas of Kursi and Dewa were transferred to Bara Banki, and Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s of Malihabad to Unao; and on the re-arrangement of the district thus necessitated Malihabad and Mahona were put up together and made one tahsil, admin-\nistered from Malihabad, and the remaining tahsils of Lucknow and Mohanlalganj remained the same.\n\nIt need not be said that this district administration is the creation of the British Government, which accepting the old and well known division of the country into parganas, and taking the old towns which had always formed the headquarters of the parganas, made them the centres of the fiscal and judicial administrations of its tahsil subdivisions. The pargana was under the native government strictly a revenue unit, and whatever may have been its origin was used solely for revenue purposes, being administered from the headquarters of revenue circles known as chaklas, which, in the instance of Lucknow, were in almost every case without the boundaries of the present district, the exception being in the case of the parganas immediately round the city, which paid into the Government treasury direct, and were said to belong to the Huzur tahsil. The tahsils to which each of the parganas belong are given in the 3rd chapter of this article.\n\nAspect of district.\u2014The aspect of the country is open champaign, well studded with villages, finely wooded, in places most fertile, and in parts very highly cultivated. But the scene changes when a river or water course is approached, or one of the large sterile tracts of \u00fasar plain, which stretching sometimes for miles present no sign of vegetable growth, and yield no product but the reh, \"sulphate of soda,\" which springs up in a saline efflorescence after the rains, and which is scraped together by the dhobi (washerman,) and used as a substitute for soap, or here and there a kankar pit, from which, to the depth of two or three feet, the quarryman digs out kankar for the roads. The level throughout is unbroken, and it is only on nearing a river, whose casual floods and deep running streams have broken and carried away the land on either side, that any expanse of country can be seen.\n\nLand levels.\u2014The slope of the country is north-west to south-east, but its uniformity of level may be partly predicted from the tortuous course of the rivers and streams, which seem with difficulty to force their way through the country. The following levels will show the height of the district above sea level at different points. At its extreme north near Mahona it is 415 feet; at Alamabagh, about the centre, near Lucknow, it is 394; at Nagram on the southeast it is 372; showing, from north to south, a slope of no more than 43 feet or less than a foot per mile. There are no mountains.\n\nDrainage.\u2014The drainage of the country is carried on by the Gumti and Sai rivers, which in their turn receive small tributary streams. The chief of these is the Baita, a small perennial stream, which, rising in the Hardoi district, passes through the Malihabad pargana in a south-easterly direction, and falls into the Gumti at a point on its right bank near Kankrabad. The Loni, another stream having its source in the Mohanlalganj pargana, passes through it, and joins the river near Salempur on its right bank. Its tributaries on the left are small and unimportant. The Sai bounds the district on its south-west side, and runs almost parallel to the Gumti. It receives the Nagwa and Bank nadis. The former, a small\nstream which has its source a few miles to north of Moh\u00e1n, and the latter\nthe outcome of a series of jhils lying in the hollow parts of pargana\nBijnaur.\n\nThe watershed.\u2014The watershed of the country to the south of the\nGumti will then lie between the two rivers the Gumti and Sai, and must\nbe picked out from between their tributary streams.\n\nCharacter of the rivers and streams.\u2014It may probably be supposed\nthat the numerous streams and water-courses affording facilities for irri-\ngation would add greatly to the potential agricultural wealth of the district,\nbut it is not so. Whether they may raise the general spring level or not,\nwhich is often doubtful from the depth of the river beds, river water in\ngeneral is most inaccessible. At Lucknow, the water level of the Gumti is\n341 feet or 53 feet below the land level, which, as has been already said, is\n394 at about the same point, and the difference is not less throughout its\ncourse. This is a great height from which to draw water, and the best\nlands are always a long way from the river bed; for the rivers are accom-\npanied in turn by wide tracts of undulating sand or high banks of rugged\nground from which the super-soil has been washed and cut away by the\nrains forcing their way down to the river. Sometimes, where the river\ntakes a sharp bend followed by a reach, the country is low and fertile, but\nthe consequence is usually then too great a moisture and a rank marshy\nsoil. These are the aspects of the river's banks; and it can only be said\nthat nature has given a supply of water which artificial means of a higher\ncharacter can only help us to secure.\n\nIn the rains of 1872, the river Gumti presented a vast volume of water\n588 feet broad, 41\u00b77 feet deep, with a velocity of 3\u00b757 miles per hour, and\nwith a discharge of 34,369 cubic feet per second. In ordinary monsoons\nthe highest discharge is about a quarter less than this. The river is\ncrossed by the railway with a girder bridge consisting of six spans of 56\nfeet each, and two land spans (brick arches) of 15 feet each. The flood\ndischarges of the other rivers of the district were as follows when they\nare crossed by the railway:\n\n| Rivers                  | Waterway, lineal feet | Height | Mean velocity | Flood discharge per second cubic feet |\n|-------------------------|------------------------|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra            | 90                     | 18\u00b72   | 3\u00b724          | 3,802                                |\n| Nurhi jhil             | 27                     | 6\u00b77    | 11\u00b786         | 1,978                                |\n| Reth nala              | 150                    | 32\u00b70   | 5\u00b747          | 15,586                               |\n| Sai                    | 220                    | 47\u00b70   | 2\u00b726          | 11,751                               |\n| Canal of Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, Haidar. | 44                | 18\u00b70   | 3\u00b794          | 2,429                                |\n| Baita, 1st crossing    | 224                    | 25\u00b77   | 1\u00b789          | 5,808                                |\n| Do. 2nd ,,              | 90                     | 23\u00b70   | 2\u00b747          | 4,190                                |\n\nNature of the soil.\u2014Of the geological formation of the district I cannot\nsay much, except that it seems due to an alluvial deposit. The soil cultivated\nand culturable, where it is best known as dumat, which etymologically implies a mixture of two earths, heavy and light; the heavy is the clay known as mati\u00e1r, and the light has a large admixture of sand; where it is entirely sand it is known as bh\u00far.\n\nThe land is generally good, and with manure and water would be all productive. Bh\u00far or sandy soil ranges along the high banks of rivers. It is met with in the largest proportions in the Lucknow pargana, through the centre of which the Gumti passes; and in Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi, a long narrow pargana, washed by the Sai. In K\u00e1kori, which is washed by no river, and crossed by insignificant streams, the bh\u00far shows lowest.\n\nBut the unculturable is generally of a most intractable kind. The \u00fasar plain has been already mentioned. It is the same as the \u00fasar land that prevails in the Unao district, and of which Mr. Maconochie has given a description and analysis in his report. It is, as far as is known, absolutely irreclaimable, and worse, if not sedulously watched and carefully checked by cultivation; it seems insidiously to creep into the cultivated fields bordering on its margin, amongst the green crops, of which small white patches may be seen, hardly covered by a stunted growth. These plains present a most sterile aspect, and the only vegetable growth that can be seen on them is a stunted grass which lasts only so long as the rains are still fresh upon the soil. They are of considerable extent, commencing from the centre of the eastern boundary of the Mohanlalganj pargana. They stretch through the district in a westerly direction through Bijnaur, K\u00e1kori, and finally disappear into the Unao district. Their effect on many villages is very fatal. Sometimes but a small residue of cultivation out of the whole area is left; but they have also had the effect of materially increasing the size of the villages, which average in Bijnaur, the pargana most fatally affected, 929 acres, being an area almost twice as great as and two-thirds greater than the area of villages in Mahona and Malihabad, the parganas least affected by them. In the Bijnaur pargana the barren land amounts to so much as forty-three per cent. of the whole area.\n\n**Distribution of cultivated, culturable, and barren soil.**\u2014The following figures will show the amount of cultivated, culturable, and barren land in the whole district. They are\u2014cultivated 54\u00b70, culturable 23\u00b77, barren 22\u00b73. And the annexed table will show the variations for each pargana:\n\n| Name of pargana | Cultivated | Cultura-ble | Barren |\n|-----------------|------------|-------------|--------|\n| Lucknow         | 57\u00b738      | 19\u00b77        | 23\u00b755  |\n| Bijnaur         | 45\u00b726      | 11\u00b729       | 43\u00b746  |\n| K\u00e1kori          | 50\u00b749      | 19\u00b72        | 37\u00b749  |\n| Mohanlalganj    | 51\u00b750      | 26\u00b781       | 31\u00b761  |\n| Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi | 51\u00b71     | 34\u00b719       | 13\u00b780  |\n| Mahona          | 56\u00b714      | 26\u00b763       | 19\u00b717  |\n| Malihabad       | 59\u00b764      | 26\u00b763       | 13\u00b793  |\nAnd of the cultivated area some 73 per cent. belongs to the 1st class or dumat soil already mentioned, while 16 per cent. is clayey or matiar, and 11 per cent. light sandy soil. But the barren land is not all due to \u00fasar; 8\u00b739 per cent. for village sites, 23\u00b729 for ponds and jhils, 5\u00b738 for roads may be deducted, leaving a balance of 62\u00b794 per cent. of the nominally barren area that is absolutely chargeable to unculturable \u00fasar.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Lucknow presents no features differing from those of Northern India generally; its salient points may be indicated.\n\nRainfall.\u2014During the last eleven years 1864-1874, the rainfall has been as follows at Lucknow itself:\n\n| Year | Inches |\n|------|--------|\n| 1864 | 24     |\n| 1865 | 34     |\n| 1866 | 22     |\n| 1867 | 53     |\n| 1868 | 27     |\n| 1869 | 42     |\n| 1870 | 64     |\n| 1871 | 65     |\n| 1872 | 41     |\n| 1873 | 34     |\n| 1874 | 47     |\n\nAverage | 41\u00b74 |\n\nIt is possible, however, that Lucknow owing to its proximity to a river gets more rain than other parts of the district. The mean of the three tahsils\u2014Maliabad, Lucknow, and Mohanlalganj\u2014is given in the ensuing table; the average of eleven years is 37\u00b76 inches. It will be noted that in five of these eleven years there was moderate rain not far from the average, in three there was drought, and in three excessive rain:\n\nAverage fall of rain in Lucknow district.\n\n| Years | Inches |\n|-------|--------|\n| 1865  | 27\u00b70   |\n| 1866  | 23\u00b70   |\n| 1867  | 54\u00b70   |\n| 1868  | 21\u00b72   |\n| 1869  | 34\u00b77   |\n| 1870  | 56\u00b76   |\n| 1871  | 67\u00b71   |\n| 1872  | 32\u00b78   |\n| 1873  | 30\u00b71   |\n| 1874  | 41\u00b76   |\n| 1875  | 39\u00b72   |\n\nAverage for eleven years | 37\u00b76 |\n\nIn 1873-74 the rainfall was scanty and ended prematurely. The monsoon commenced on June 20th, 1873, and throughout that month the fall amounted to 0\u00b752 inches; the rain ended on 16th September, in the whole of which month the fall amounted only to 10\u00b784. During the next four months...\nonly 0\u00b72 inches fell, and the first heavy shower was in February, on the 5th, when a fall of 0\u00b73 inches was registered.\n\nThe important matter both for health and agriculture is not so much the amount as the distribution of the rain. The regular rains commenced and ended as follows:\n\n| Year | June       | September |\n|------|------------|-----------|\n| 1870 | 26th      | 23rd      |\n| 1872 | 9th       | 6th       |\n| 1873 | 20th      | 16th      |\n| 1874 | 6th       | 26th      |\n\nThe rains though sufficient in quantity were untimely in 1869, for there were no rains till July; in 1870 because the rain commenced so late, delaying agricultural operations; in 1873 because they commenced late and ceased early, drying up the late rice. The important months for husbandry are June, September, and December-January. The following are the rainfall of those months:\n\n| Year | June | September | December-January |\n|------|------|-----------|------------------|\n| 1868 | 3\u00b73  | 8\u00b71       | 1\u00b77              |\n| 1869 | 1\u00b79  | 13\u00b71      | 1\u00b74              |\n| 1870 | 9\u00b78  | 17\u00b71      | 1\u00b72              |\n| 1871 | 11\u00b77 | 17\u00b70      | 3\u00b72              |\n| 1872 | 2\u00b76  | 1\u00b78       | 0\u00b72              |\n| 1873 | 0\u00b75  | 10\u00b78      | 0\u00b72              |\n| 1874 | 8\u00b77  | 6\u00b70       | 0\u00b71              |\n\nOf these years 1873 was perhaps the worst; in two of the critical portions of the year the rain was very scanty; on the 3rd September rain was abundant enough, but it ceased on the 16th. Now, 1874, the rains have apparently ceased, but there is little danger of a bad crop as in 1873, because the previous rains were early, the rice is well grown and can stand drought better, and the tanks are overflowing from a copious and steady rainfall. There is only one month in which apparently there is never any rain, that is November. In the last half of October and first half of December there has been no heavy rain since 1867; during these eight weeks the wheat generally has to be watered twice, so artificial irrigation to a large extent is necessary every year.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The mean temperature of Lucknow observatory for the years 1868-73 in the shade is 78\u00b78, the extremes being 80\u00b73 and 78\u00b72. The mean maximum on the grass has been 62, having been 59\u00b77 in 1873. The minimum on the grass in December, 1871, was 28\u00b77, and 26\u00b77 on 8th January, 1874. On this latter occasion many trees and plants were killed or severely injured by the frost to a height of eight feet from the ground. On June 4th, 1873, the maximum temperature in the sun's rays was 171. The mean temperatures of the hottest months (May and June) are as follows:\n\n| Year | May | June |\n|------|-----|------|\n| 1872 | 93  | 92   |\n| 1873 | 91  | 97\u00b75 |\n\nIn 1873, the average of the six months (April to September) was 88\u00b78, of those from October to March 67\u00b75. The range of thermometer in one year from 171 to 26 degrees is enormous and doubtless very trying.\nWind.\u2014The prevalent wind during the hot months is westerly. There are on the average 27,000 miles of wind every year; this would give an average of nearly 74 miles per day. March, April, and May are the most windy months. Hailstorms have not done serious damage since 1868. The wind generally is quite strong enough for a wind-mill, which might apparently be tried on a large scale in Lucknow for irrigation purposes.* A wind-mill, with sails of 40 feet radius, is equivalent to 65,000 feet pounds per minute.\n\nStorms.\u2014There are four or five storms nearly every year, mostly in the months of April and May. Since 1868 there have been registered three storms, with a pressure of 40lbs. per square foot. In 1873-74 there was no storm with a greater pressure than 10\u00bdlbs., but this is probably incorrect, as the registered velocity indicates a much higher pressure. In all the preceding years the registered pressure has reached 25\u00b730 or 40lbs. In 1869 only 20lbs. were reached.\n\nSanitary and medical aspects.\u2014The mortuary returns and statistics are so incorrect that no reliance can be placed upon them. The reported deaths in 1872 in Lucknow were 14\u00b78 per mille of the population; in 1870 they were 10\u00b736 in the rural district, and 25\u00b782 in the city; in 1871, the rate was 19\u00b78 in the city, and 12\u00b75 in the district; fever is credited with about half the mortality.\u2020\n\nSmall-pox is very prevalent in Lucknow, but it is of a mild type. Only about one per cent. of the deaths are credited to it, although the large majority of the people have suffered from it, and some from repeated attacks. Cholera has not of late been very destructive; but in 1872, 2\u00b711 per mille are recorded to have fallen victims to it. The civil surgeon states that the native drugs are worthless, and the Yun\u00e1ni system of treatment mere charlatanry. The following memorandum on the medical aspects of the Lucknow district is supplied by B\u00e1bu Chandi Charan Ghose, assistant to civil surgeon:\n\n\"No trustworthy statistics exist as to the annual birth rate in the district of Lucknow; and even the registration of deaths in the city of Lucknow and the seven rural circles is not as perfect as is to be desired. The population of the district\u2014according to the latest publication in the Oudh Government Gazette of 21st November, 1874\u2014is 778,195, and the number of deaths registered in the district during 1873 is 10,288, giving the ratio of 13\u00b722 of deaths per thousand of the population. The mean ratio of deaths per thousand during the previous three years was 16\u00b728. All this information has been collected from the mortuary returns, but as doubts have been expressed about the correctness of these returns, the figures given above must be taken with a certain degree of allowance.\n\nThe prevailing endemic diseases in the district are fevers, skin diseases, and bowel complaints. Fevers are met throughout the year; but their prevalence during three months\u2014September, October, and November\u2014\n\n* Chambers' Encyclopaedia, Article Wind-mills, Fairbairn's Mills, Vol. I, pages 6, 282,295; Murray's hand-book to the Continent, pages 12, 13, quoted in Khari district article.\n\u2020 The Civil Surgeon says that he cannot give any trustworthy facts bearing on the medical aspects of the Lucknow city and district.\nis marked. In 1873 the largest number of deaths (960) occurred in November and the smallest (367) in July. The deaths registered from fevers during 1873 in the district were 7,233, giving a ratio of 9\u00b730 per thousand of population. During the same year no less than 2,531 cases of fever were treated in the king's hospital, civil dispensary, and Balrampur hospital, in the city of Lucknow. The most common kind is intermittent fever of the quotidian type in the proportion of 10 quotidian to 1 tertian. The quartan type is comparatively rare. Remittent fever is not uncommon. It exists in the district in the proportion of 1 to 50 of intermittent fever. Fevers in this district are comparatively speaking of a mild type.\n\nThe causes are the same everywhere. Sub-soil drainage is a thing unknown in the district. Rank vegetation during the rains seems to be one of the chief causes. Unwholesome food is another. The poorer classes cannot afford to eat wheat, bajra or gram; during the greater part of the year kodo and makai of the worst kind are their common food. The numerous pools of stagnant water are the favourite seats of fever in the district. What with privation and exposure to the extremes of cold, and heat and rain, it is not to be wondered at, that fever is so prevalent in the district of Lucknow.\n\nCholera is seldom absent from the district. There is no year in which a considerable number of deaths is not ascribed to this disease. Both forms of cholera (sporadic and epidemic) are met with. The disease appears at the setting in of the rains, and is generally prevalent during the months of July, August, September, October, and November. In 1873, the largest number of deaths (91) occurred in the month of November. The statistics of deaths from cholera during the last five years in this district are as follows; but as registration is very imperfect, these figures are only approximately correct.\n\n| Year | Deaths |\n|------|--------|\n| 1869 | 881    |\n| 1870 | 12     |\n| 1871 | 858    |\n| 1872 | 1,245  |\n| 1873 | 159    |\n\nThere does not seem to be any doubt now; that every year there is a focus of cholera in one of the districts, from which it is scattered about by pilgrims visiting the different fairs, shrines, and bathing places, or by traders travelling from one infected place to another. No class of people seem to be exempt from an attack of cholera. Especially, however, the lower classes of the people who are not particular about their food, and whose habits of life are far from cleanly, fall victims to this disease. In 1873, the ratio of deaths per thousand of population was 2\u00b70. The causes of the disease are yet enveloped in mystery.\n\nSmall-pox generally makes its appearance in the month of March, and attains its maximum intensity in the months of April, May, and June. It begins to decline during the rains, and almost disappears by the middle of the cold weather. Small-pox rages with virulence in all ranks of society, and in absence of general vaccination or inoculation, numbers are carried off every year. Infection is the only cause of the disease. The people of this district seem to be averse to vaccination, and so long as\nJenner's method is not universally followed, there is no hope of the disease being eradicated. Medical aid during prevalence of the disease is totally unavailing. The ratio of deaths during 1873 was 1\u00b723 per thousand of population. Deaths registered from this disease during the last five years were as follows:\n\nIn 1869 ... ... ... ... ... 2,566 deaths.\n\" 1870 ... ... ... ... ... 740 \"\n\" 1871 ... ... ... ... ... 830 \"\n\" 1872 ... ... ... ... ... 648 \"\n\" 1873 ... ... ... ... ... 975 \"\n\nThe remarks regarding registration of deaths from cholera apply with equal force to that from small-pox.\n\nBowel complaints.\u2014The return of deaths during the last five years under these diseases is given below:\n\nIn 1869 ... ... ... ... ... 559 deaths.\n1870 ... ... ... ... ... 942 \"\n1871 ... ... ... ... ... 1,005 \"\n1872 ... ... ... ... ... 362 \"\n1873 ... ... ... ... ... 620 \"\n\nThe ratio of deaths from bowel complaints during 1873 per thousand of population was '79. In the king's hospital, civil dispensary, and Balrampur hospital, 812 cases of dysentery and 923 cases of diarrhoea were treated during the same year. The deaths were 10 from the former, and 38 from the latter in these hospitals.\n\nSkin diseases.\u2014These do not call for any special remarks. The most common forms are scabies and ringworm, both of which are owing to the unclean habits of the people.\n\nCattle disease.\u2014Murrain carried off during the last four years many head of cattle in the province. To remedy this evil, the Chief Commissioner engaged the services of a veterinary surgeon. A veterinary school has been established to teach s\u00e1lotris how to treat disease when it breaks out in the districts. No reliable information can be obtained of the number of cattle attacked by this disease in Lucknow, nor how many have died from its effects. I am not aware whether they have suffered from the diminution of pasture lands.\n\nList of some indigenous medicines found in the district of Lucknow.\n\n1.

The b\u00e1ids are generally medical practitioners who profess to follow the system of Suscruta. Many of these practitioners, however, are entirely ignorant of the principles laid down by the great Hindu physician, and are merely quacks who treat at random. They generally use mineral medicines, without apparently being aware of the injurious effects produced by them upon the system of the patient. I have known cases in which injury done by these quack medicines has been incalculable. There is a Hindu proverb that the skill of no physician is to be trusted unless at least one thousand patients meet death at his hands. Though these men do not possess the necessary qualifications of physicians, the people have such a blind faith in them that they would rather die than take medical aid from qualified practitioners practising any other system.\n\nThe remarks I have made above with regard to the b\u00e1ids apply equally well to the h\u00e1k\u00edms. Hippocrates is their great teacher. They profess respect for the teaching of the great Greek physician, but I very much doubt whether many of them have any knowledge of the truths discovered by Hippocrates. The h\u00e1k\u00edms generally use vegetable medicines, and believe that they produce a cooling effect upon the system, but their belief often turns out to be fallacious in the extreme.

The only others with a population of more than 5,000 are Amethi, K\u00e2kori, and Malihabad. Bijnaur, Kasmandi, Mahona, and Mari\u00e2on are qasbas, but wanting only in population. The qasbas are almost universally the headquarters of parganas, and from them the pargana used to be administered under the native rule. Here is an account of the origin, and a description of a qasba town,\u2014\u201cA Musalman settlement in a defensible military position, generally on the site of ancient Hindu headquarters, town,\u201d or fort, where, for mutual protection, the Musalmans, who had overrun and seized the proprietary of the surrounding villages, resided; where the faujdar and his troops, the pargana q\u00e2n\u00fbngo and chaudhri, the mufti, q\u00e2zi, and other high dignitaries lived; and, as must be the case where the wealth and power of the Moslem sect was collected in one spot, a large settlement of Sayyads\u2019 mosques, darg\u00eehs, &c., sprang up. As a rule there was little land attached, and that was chiefly planted with fruit groves, and held free of rent, whilst each man really had a free hold of the yard of his house and the land occupied by his servants and followers.\u201d (From Mr. Capper\u2019s judgment in the Amethi case.) The larger towns are generally the resort of the Musalman gentry, as well as the lower caste members of the creed, who follow the mechanical professions. With the exception of such towns the district is chiefly rural.\n\nIncluding Lucknow, the urban population amounts to 32.5 per cent. of the whole, nevertheless there are numerous large villages containing a population of from 1,000 to 2,000 and from 2,000 to 5,000 inhabitants; the population of the city is understood to be slowly declining. The following figures will show the entire number of towns and villages in the district classified:\u2014\n\nThere are\u2014\n\n| Population Range | Number |\n|------------------|--------|\n| Over 5,000       | 4      |\n| From 2,000 to 5,000 | 31     |\n| From 1,000 to 2,000 | 101    |\n| From 500 to 1,000 | 292    |\n| From 200 to 500  | 639    |\n| Less than 200    | 404    |\n\nAnd there is moreover no large village without its dependent hamlets. Their entire number is 988 (in the old district), but they do not belong to the smaller villages, and not so much to the pargana towns as to the large villages. Eliminating the former and the city of Lucknow, eleven in all, and taking only half of the villages with a population of over 200, the\naverage number of hamlets is two and a half to a village. The single isolated houses are not many, and what there are, are the abodes of faqirs and religious enthusiasts, who have abandoned the toils and pleasures of the world.\n\n**Groves and trees.**\u2014It has been said the groves amount to 40,230 acres, or five per cent. of the whole area of the district. But this very inadequately represents the trees. It shows the mango orchards that are grown on uncultivated ground; but it does not show the fruit trees, the orange, pomegranate, guava, and custard apples that grow round Lucknow, and the numerous towns scattered through the district: nor does it show the avenues and single trees, the tamarind, bargad, or banyan (*ficus indica*), semal or cotton tree (*bombax heptaphyllum*), gular (*ficus glomerata*), the bel or *ceiba* marmelos, the bakain or willow, nim (*melia azadirachta*), and palm tree that are spread through the country. Noticeable among them is the single mango tree of fine growth and comely shape. It is the survivor of some old grove, which the owner, through straightened circumstances, has reluctantly cut down. He called it *J\u00e1k* or *Sakhya*, from S\u00e1khi, the witness of the place where the old grove stood. The etymology of *J\u00e1k* is uncertain. These mango groves are not planted or reared without considerable trouble and outlay. For the first two or three years of their growth they are made over to the village *mdl\u00ed* (gardner), who, for his trouble, has the cultivation and crops of the ground so long as he tends it. But it is only round the towns that a selection of grafts and fruit is thought of. Malihabad is noted for the fineness of its mangoes and its ber (*zyziphus jujuba*), grown in orchards called *beriana*. There are no forests in Lucknow.\n\n**Area of townships.**\u2014The average area of the townships is something under a square mile each, but it varies from 929 acres in Bijnaur to 483 acres in Mahona. It does not seem to depend on the density of the population or extent of cultivation, and its true cause must be sought for in the varying histories of the owners of the soil, and the original conquest and colonization of the country.\n\n**Origin of villages.**\u2014Some of the villages are very old and date from pre-historic times; but some are modern, in so far that their histories can be definitely traced. The native imagination delights in finding derivations more curious than trustworthy for names, and it would be unsafe to build much history on their accounts of the foundation of some of their villages; but from very ancient times the founder seems generally to have given his name to the village. Natural objects are not varied or striking enough to have given much help, though they are readily seized when present\u2014as a tree, or an unusual feature in the soil, or a natural produce. Instances are Khaj\u00farg\u00e1on, the village of the date trees; Ber-Karaundi, of the ber and karaunda \"bushes\"; P\u00e1n-B\u00e1ri, the village of the p\u00e1n gardens; Tikaria or Tekri, the village with the hillock; K\u00e1nkrabad, the kankar village. But it is characteristic of all villages built since the time of the second Rajput colonization and Musalman invasion, dating from perhaps the end of the 12th century, that they should terminate in *p\u00far* or *nagar* or *khera*, or in the Musalman\nOther names than these are difficult to trace, and seem to belong to another order of things, probably they point to an aboriginal origin.\n\n**Area and cultivation.**\u2014The following statement shows the number of townships, area, and cultivation in the district of Lucknow:\n\n| Parganas | Number of villages | Cultivated area in acres | Cultivable area in acres | Area inhabited | Barren or fallow | Ponds | Roads | Total |\n|----------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Lucknow  | 180               | 56,139                  | 18,658                  | 2,488         | 19,873          | 5,531 | 2,146 | 97,820 |\n| Bijnaur  | 102               | 42,889                  | 10,695                  | 1,338         | 32,857          | 6,870 | 1,123 | 94,772 |\n| K\u00e1kori   | 64                | 19,361                  | 4,586                   | 751           | 10,489          | 2,592 | 472   | 88,750 |\n| **Total**| **346**           | **118,279**             | **33,933**              | **4,577**     | **55,719**      | **14,493** | **3,741** | **231,348** |\n| Mohanlalganj | 171            | 66,132                  | 24,519                  | 2,514         | 16,782          | 7,300 | 1,150 | 128,417 |\n| Nigohan Siasaindi | 57       | 23,860                  | 15,658                  | 732           | 3,168           | 2,006 | 424   | 45,878 |\n| **Total**| **228**           | **89,992**              | **50,207**              | **3,246**     | **19,930**      | **9,306** | **1,614** | **174,995** |\n| Mahonlal | 194               | 52,979                  | 23,909                  | 1,863         | 9,926           | 4,957 | 1,326 | 94,269 |\n| Malhabad | 188               | 71,097                  | 31,634                  | 2,185         | 9,729           | 3,643 | 1,185 | 119,573 |\n| **Total**| **383**           | **124,076**             | **55,043**              | **4,047**     | **19,656**      | **8,500** | **2,511** | **213,832** |\n| **Grand Total** | **956**       | **383,347**             | **139,188**             | **11,870**    | **95,304**      | **32,299** | **7,666** | **619,469** |\n\n**Area under cultivation.**\u2014The area of land under cultivation amounted to 480,274 acres in the old district from which parganas Moh\u00e1n, Aur\u00e1s, Kursi, and Dewa have been removed. The present area is 488 square miles or 312,320 acres; but the survey was in 1867-68, and there are now probably 350,000 acres under the plough. The above area does not agree exactly with others given elsewhere, nor with the annual report* which gives the area of cultivation at 533 square miles. The difficulty probably arises in connexion with the 23 villages of the Lucknow district, which in 1869 were included in pargana Dewa and transferred to Bara Banki. It is not worth while now adjusting exactly the proportion of cultivation which existed eight years ago, because it has now largely increased. In the old district 43\u00bd per cent. of the cultivation was irrigated.\n\n---\n\n* Statistical Return La.\nIrrigated land.\u2014The irrigated land consists of two kinds\u2014irrigated from wells and irrigated from jhils, tanks, and rivers. The last does not amount to much. The irrigation from jhils and tanks, or what may be called natural means, amounted in the old district to 72.5 per cent. of the whole, and was most in Bijnaur and Mahona. This is a very large proportion, and seeing how dependent and precarious such irrigation is, the existing necessity for encouraging and aiding the cultivators to dig wells can never be too fully recognized. The land watered from wells is always the best land. The operations of irrigation are described at length in the Partabgarh district article.\n\nCulturable land.\u2014The culturable land is of very varying qualities in the different parganas, and in most cases little can be done with it with present means and appliances. If it were good it would be cultivated. Land is wanted. This may be illustrated by the facts disclosed in the parganas of Lucknow, Bijnaur, and K\u00e1kori, which are shown in the accompanying table. While the population in these parganas presses the heaviest, and the holding of the cultivators are the smallest, the amount of culturable land left is the least. Taking all the parganas, it would seem that the extent cultivated was in inverse ratio to the density of the population, which would hardly be the case if there was much land left that could be used. In the best parganas, which are undoubtedly Mahona and Malihabad, the amount of cultivation increases with the sparseness of the population. In Malihabad, which has 786 to the cultivated square mile, the average holding per cultivator is from 4 to 4\u00bd acres; while in Lucknow, which has 1,229 to the square mile, the holding per cultivator is as low as three acres. The following table will show the variation in holdings for all the different parganas:\n\n| Districts | Area in square miles | Cultivated area in acres | Culturable area in acres | Population per square mile | Population per cultivated square mile | Number of cultivators | Amount held by each cultivator |\n|-----------|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Lucknow   | 146                  | 55,800                   | 7,925                   | 656                       | 1,229                               | 18,490               | 3                             |\n| Bijnaur   | 148                  | 42,855                   | 8,283                   | 454                       | 1,005                               | 13,564               | 3                             |\n| K\u00e1kori    | 60                   | 19,181                   | 3,007                   | 550                       | 1,059                               | 5,948                | 3                             |\n| Mohanlalganj | 201            | 65,543                   | 90,093                  | 568                       | 1,103                               | 19,830               | 3                             |\n| Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi | 72       | 20,860                   | 12,978                  | 517                       | 1,005                               | 6,415                | 3                             |\n| Malihabad | 187                  | 70,973                   | 28,240                  | 413                       | 786                                 | 15,127               | 4                             |\n| Mahona    | 147                  | 55,743                   | 20,543                  | 486                       | 872                                 | 10,615               | 3                             |\n\nTotal | ... | 327,955 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ...\n\nThe culturable land is said to amount to 210,208 acres, or 28.7 per cent. of the whole area; but the account is illusory, for of this 27,731 acres or 13.2 per cent. are groves, and there is still the question whether, in the interest of what stock there is, the remainder had not better be left untouched. But this might pass; the beasts are of so poor a quality now, and pick up so scanty a pasture, that if, by agricultural means, the quan-\ntity of fodder could be increased; they would undoubtedly be much better off.\n\nGoind land.\u2014The only high class cultivation really so is to be found in the goind lands round the villages and hamlets, and it depends generally on the density of the population, and what they can lay out in manure and irrigation, as to whether the goind can be extended or not. As manure and water can be applied to the farthest corners of the village, so will the productive powers of the soil be increased, and a possibility of raising the finer crops exist. But manure is scarce, and such scanty supply as there is, is more often used for cooking, and for fuel for brick-making, than for re-invigorating the soil. Stock is at a minimum; the cultivated land is 480,274 acres; the number of beasts, all told, is 262,032, not much more than one to every two acres; none of the manure is saved in farm-yards, but the beasts are allowed to stray out in the jungles; 240,847 are of the cow tribe, and, for eight months in the year, the women of the lower castes are engaged in making cow-dung cakes to stack in front of their houses for fuel for household purposes, or to sell for kilns, in order to add some small mite to their daily earnings.\n\nRents.\u2014The rents on the different kinds of soils in all the parganas are given in the annexed table. They were those used for the assessment of the district. They have been deduced only from the lands held by tenants-at-will, and paying a money rent. Applied throughout to the zamindar's s\u016br, to the Brahman's mu\u1e6d\u1e6d\u012b, and the b\u0101\u1e6d\u012b lands of the village, assets would have amounted to Rs. 25,57,756; but the assumed assets for Assessment have been taken only at Rs. 23,77,236,\n\n| Parganas | Goind | Dumat | Mati\u0101r | Bh\u016br |\n|----------|-------|-------|--------|------|\n|          | Irrigated | Unirrigated | Irrigated | Unirrigated | Irrigated | Unirrigated | Irrigated | Unirrigated |\n|          | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. | Rs. a. |\n| Lucknow  | ...   | 9 5   | 7 10  | 8 5   | 4 1   | 4 10  | 6 1   | 4 7   | 3 2   |\n| Bijnaur  | ...   | 8 15  | 6 8   | 5 10  | 3 15  | 7 3   | 3 3   | 2 2   | 2 2   |\n| K\u0101kori   | ...   | 7 15  | 7 3   | 7 11  | 8 14  | 5 15  | 5 8   | 4 10  | 2 13  |\n| Mohanlalganj | ... | 9 7   | 6 3   | 6 14  | 4 6   | 6 7   | 4 4   | 4 6   | 2 4   |\n| Nigoh\u0101n Sissaindi | ... | 8 8   | 5 11  | 6 6   | 4 0   | 6 8   | 4 1   | 4 5   | 2 6   |\n| Mallhabad | ...   | 7 5   | 5 8   | 5 8   | 3 13  | 5 0   | 4 0   | 3 9   | 3 8   |\n| Mahona   | ...   | 6 6   | 8 2   | 6 3   | 4 9   | 5 13  | 4 10  | 4 2   | 3 2   |\n\nRents are everywhere rising, and payments in kind, which existed only in any force in the eastern parganas, are being steadily commuted for\nmoney rents. Sometimes the former are still taken for land being newly broken up. The rent begins low but is raised by fixed yearly increments till it reaches one-half of the produce. The system is called \"hissai\" (by shares). It may commence at a tenth called \"dasani,\" whence it advances by regular steps to one-eighth, one-fifth, one-fourth, and one-half \"athaiyy\u00e1n,\" \"panchayy\u00e1n,\" \"chauthayy\u00e1n,\" \"bat\u00e1i.\" But if the land is not bad, and requires less labour and capital, it begins at one-fourth, or if money be agreed on, it commences at one anna per bigha, and next year advances to two annas, and thence by yearly increments of two annas till it reaches one rupee, when it becomes subject to competition or agreement; or the rent may commence at four annas.\n\nAdditional cesses.\u2014It may be interesting to mention some of the old customs that existed with reference to bat\u00e1i or division before they altogether die out. The zamindar exacted, in addition to his half, various cesses which he called the siwde and g\u00e1on-kharch. The first was the \"arhaiya\" or 2\u00bd sers kachcha, equal to one ser pakka, per maund for his village expenses proper, and was to recompense the zamindar for his trouble and expense of the chaukidar and patw\u00e1ri, and for the benefit of his protection. It amounted sometimes to so much as a panseri, five sers kachcha or two sers pakka. Next came the seri, or one ser per maund, half of which was for the patw\u00e1ri and half for the shahna or bailiff, who looked after the crop on behalf of the zamindar. The menri or mend\u00ed, or so much per field, usually an arhaiya or 2\u00bd sers, equal to one ser pakka, for the weighing man, but the zamindar took half of this. The cesses seem to have been originally levied on the principle that the landlord must have a full net half of the produce of the soil. Under these circumstances, it was impossible that cultivation on bat\u00e1i lands should be of a high quality, and in fact it never was. The commutation into money rents has worked so much good for the cultivator that he will get all the excess that his labour can procure. These cesses have fallen with the payment in kind, and are included in the rent.\n\nThe cesses were never taken from the Brahman or Chhattri, the \"bhalamanus,\" the respectable man. And this has always been borne in mind in the fixation of his rent in money, which is always less than that of the common cultivator, though it will vary with the varying histories of, and the moral influence and status of, the Brahmans in the different parganas.\n\nIn addition to this, the cultivator, and, indeed, all classes alike, had and still have another drain in the handful, the \"anjuri,\" that is taken for the offerings. It is a double handful of grain taken out of each man's heap; they usually amounted to five\u2014one for the parohit Brahman, one for the faq\u00edr, one for the Bh\u00e1t, one for the M\u00e1li, and one for the chaukidar.\n\nThe whole amount is computed to amount to a panseri, or two sers pakka. But the anjuris varied; five would be the least. They can mount up to nine, which were given to the parohit, the faq\u00edr, the Bh\u00e1t, the M\u00e1li, the P\u00e1si (chaukidar), the Mall\u00e1h (boatman), a Gosh\u00e1in, a Gang\u00e1putr, to Bishund\u00e1s, a Brahman of Lucknow, which was a special case.\nThe expenses of harvesting vary. The launh\u00e1r reaper (lahna, a sheaf) gets one out of every twenty-four or thirty (tisauri) sheaves in the high-class crops, and every thirteenth sheaf (b\u00e1rahw\u00e1n, terahw\u00e1n) in pulses. But for the latter the payment is sometimes one in every thirteen panse-ris of the thrashed grain. And for corn, if grain be taken, it is not more than one ser per maund, or one in forty instead of one in thirty maunds, taking the lowest rate of payment in sheaves.\n\nIndebtedness of the cultivator.\u2014The cultivator is generally in a poor way, though in some estates he is better off than in others. His indebtedness is almost universal, and he gets little help from his landlord. The latter will advance him money for the purchase of seed or plant, but he will not fail to take interest for it. The high prices of the last years, however, have done much for his benefit, and it is said his indebtedness is diminishing. But though much could be done for his improvement and much for his land by extending irrigation and applying more capital, his prospects do not seem very hopeful. His rent is high and still rises, his holding is small, and, as the population increases, will still get smaller.\n\nThe cultivators, the as\u00e1nis, are the villeins of the middle ages, and the lord of the manor reckons them amongst his goods and chattels; they are adscripti glebae. In a transfer of his domain he includes them. It is an unneighbourly and unfriendly action to entice them away; and if one of them leaves he is said to abscond, to fly. There is in this a trace of the colonization and conquest of the country by the ancestors of the zamin-dar. He found the cultivator of the soil on his domain, or he brought him into his village and settled him, and gave him land to cultivate, and built him a house to live in. The houses are all his property, and go with the land. So long as the occupant cultivates his land and pays him rent, he demands no other hire. But from the non-agriculturist classes\u2014the parja, his subjects\u2014he takes parjdwat. If they are manufacturers, who take their wares to other markets, he takes money. If they are village artizans, who work for the remaining inhabitants of the villages, he takes in kind. As from the Jul\u00e1has and Bihnas, the weavers and cotton corders, a small sum of money (karg\u00e1ha); but from Cham\u00e1rs a pair of shoes a year, and his cattle-gear made and repaired. From the village carpenters (barhai), a plough in the year, and his implements mended for nothing. From the garariya or herdsman a blanket. But the trades are now at a very low ebb, and the taking of this cess has been discouraged; it has been looked upon as a kind of tax imposed upon industry.\n\nRents in Lucknow seem to be tolerably stationary just at present. From 1870 to 1874 there was a great number of ejectments and rent-raisings, but things seem to have settled down somewhat, though needy landlords are constantly on the watch to raise rents, or eject the tenants. Under the law they cannot do so without paying the tenant for improvements in the shape of wells and tanks made during the thirty years preceding the attempt to evict. The tenants cannot claim compensation for their dwelling-houses, which become useless if they are evicted from their fields.\n\nThey are still therefore much at their landlord's mercy, and they have submitted to rather extortionate rent-raising.\nFor lands of fair quality Rs. 3 the local bigha if irrigated, and Rs. 2 if unirrigated, seem the prevailing rates, these come to Rs. 12 and Rs. 8 the acre; near towns the rents are much higher.\n\nThe tenants have adopted an ingenious device for checking rack-renting. They take lands if possible in adjoining villages under different landlords; they have a house in one, and can throw up the land in either if rack-rented, still keeping their house and out-offices in fair proximity to their fields. They say themselves\u2014\"if persecuted in one village they flee to another;\" a combination of landlords is generally prevented by local jealousies, and many tenants thus save themselves by playing off one landlord against another. This course is not possible in large estates. The tenants often object to taking the compensation decreed them by the courts; they say they or their ancestors did not make the wells to sell. They have other sentimental objections which need not be detailed here.\n\nThe harvest.\u2014The harvests are the rabi when the spring crops are cut, the wet-weather crops or the kharif, and the henwat or autumn crops. The henwat is the fifth season amongst the Hindus. Curiously enough, the two former terms are borrowed from the Arabic. The Hindus do not usually go to foreigners for their agricultural terms. For the rabi the chief crops are wheat, barley, gram, peas, gujai\u2014a mixture of wheat and barley; birra\u2014a mixture of barley and gram, gram predominating. The land under these crops amounts to 244,408 acres, and wheat heads the list taking up 105,418 acres, or more than one-fifth of the whole cultivated area. For the kharif the crops are rice, the millets, sawan, mindwa, kakun, and Indian-corn or maize. For the henwat the crops are more millets\u2014juar and bajra, and the leguminous grains,\u2014mash, mung, moth, masur, and lobia. The whole cover 202,800 acres, and all but mung and lobia take up a large space. In addition there are the valuable tobacco and opium, and kachhiuna or vegetable crops amounting to 20,262 acres of which\u2014\n\n| Tobacco takes up | ... | ... | ... | 1,960 acres. |\n|------------------|-----|-----|-----|-------------|\n| Opium            | ... | ... | ... | 1,907 \"     |\n| Cotton           | ... | ... | ... | 2,070 \"     |\n\nand the spices as zira (cummin seed), saunf (aniseed), dhaniya (coriander seed), taking up 623 acres. These are the unmixed crops.\n\nFor arhar, in which kodo and small millet, juar, and patwa are mixed, and for oil seed (sarson, rape), which is sown in wheat, and for linseed, which is sown in strips amongst and round other crops, mostly gram,\u2014it is hard to assign separate and specific areas.\n\nOutturn.\u2014The outturn is still a moot-point, and nothing but a series of experiments will probably set the question at rest. It is not only what can be, but what is, the average yield. It is difficult to learn by enquiry, and facts are assiduously concealed from the inquirer. The farmers and cultivators will not, or fear to make a disclosure. Taking a ten years' average price, the value of the whole outturn is said to be\nRs. 55,80,000. But this must be rejected at once. A glance will show what errors there are in the return. To take the first and most glaring instance, the outturn of irrigated wheat is less than that of unirrigated. To correct the returns for three or four of the most prominent crops, the very least that can be put down for wheat is 12 maunds, or 16 bushels per acre of irrigated, and about half of that for unirrigated land. The result is 1,181,140 maunds, and value Rs. 25,90,000. The same for barley, and the result is 362,100 maunds, value Rs. 5,00,000. The outturn of sugar is put down as 4\u00bd maunds per acre. A yield of 10 maunds per bigha, or 16 per acre, is a very low average, and calling the result r\u0101d, and pricing it at 20 sars the rupee, the value of the total outturn will be Rs. 6,30,400. Again, pricing the vegetables no higher than the sugar, their value will be Rs. 4,04,000. Thus, on these four articles alone, we have Rs. 41,24,600, in place of Rs. 21,98,050, or a difference of nearly a hundred per cent.\n\nThe outturn of crops in Lucknow is perhaps about the average of the province. On a recent occasion, taking a straight line across the country an estimate of the produce in seventy-four fields was made.\n\nThe average outturn was five and a quarter maunds per bigha, or 688 pounds per acre. An estimate for the entire province, prepared from elaborate data, gave a provincial average of 650 pounds; and as labour and manure are rather more plentiful in Lucknow than in other districts, these calculations seem to confirm each other.\n\nThis outturn is undoubtedly less than that of most districts in the North-Western Province. A similar estimate of eighty-eight fields in Aligarh and Bulandsahar gave an average of six and three-quarter maunds per bigha, or 883 pounds per acre; and this, it is believed, fairly agrees with the settlement estimates.*\n\nIrrigation.\u2014Near the city in parganas Lucknow and Bijnaur irrigation facilities may be said to be of the second class; lakes and ponds are tolerably numerous, but they are very shallow, and dry up in the cold weather. The wells are generally unlined, and last one or two years; the soil strata are sufficiently cohesive to admit of the use of leathern buckets holding about twelve gallons without injury to the side. The following is the cost of irrigation gathered from several statements. From wells like these about five biswas can be watered in the day by two pair of bullocks when the water is at 35 feet distance. As a rule, only one pair of bullocks is employed from dawn till noon; one man drives them, one stands at the well to empty the bucket, and a third guides the water in the field; 2\u00bd biswas a day can thus be watered at a cost of about Re. 0-8-6\u2014viz., four annas for the pair of bullocks, and one anna and a half for each of the men. This will be Rs. 4-4-0 per bigha, or\n\n* It may be remarked here that the traveller along a high road will probably form a higher estimate of crop outturn than the general average would justify. The reasons of this is that owing to the facilities for carriage afforded by the high road, the fields adjoining it are generally better manured than those at a distance.\nRs. 6-12-0 per acre for one watering. Such appliances are, however, only used when the bullocks would otherwise be idle; human labour is much more effective. Eight men instead of two bullocks will work all day, with an interval of an hour at noon, and will water a bigha when the water is about 16 feet distant. There are also three additional labourers\u2014two in the field, and one at the top of the well to empty the bucket; they will get two annas a day or grain to that amount, which will come to Re. 1-6-0 for a bigha, or Rs. 2-3-0 per acre.\n\nThe above discrepancy between human and cattle labour only exists to such an extent in wells when the water is within sixteen feet from the surface, and when the wells are not stable enough to bear a large bucket. Such circumstances do exist in southern Lucknow throughout the district, except in a belt about four miles broad extending west and south from the Gumti. When the water is near, the bullocks, which pull up the buckets, have to descend a very short distance and then turn; this they do awkwardly, and they come up the slope more slowly than men; their employment then is exceptional, and as very small animals suffice for the small bucket, it might be fairer to value their services at 2 annas the pair, in which case the cost of irrigation would be Rs. 3-4-0 per bigha or Rs. 5-3-0 per acre. The important point is that, with the cheapest labour, three waterings cannot be given under Rs. 6-9-0 per acre throughout three quarters of southern Lucknow. The tenants, as might be expected, cannot afford this, and give the wheat only one watering or two, preferring to spend their spare time looking out for hired labour.\n\nNearer the Gumti water is at 25 feet throughout the belt above referred to, the springs being at about 33 feet distance on the average. Buckets holding 20 gallons are used, and bullock power becomes more effective. South-east of Lucknow in Mohanlalganj, in the plain running south-east between the Gumti and the Sai, water is tolerably near the surface; the average distance at which it lies on the morning before any water has been drawn being about fifteen feet. The springs are at about 30 feet on the average except in the low lands near the Gumti, and in the high lands edging the plain. In calculating the depth of these wells for irrigation purposes, the average distance of the water from the surface throughout the day should be estimated. At dawn when the bucket is first let down the distance will be fifteen feet, but by evening the water will be exhausted\u2014all but two or three feet, and the distance will be twenty-seven feet; the average will then be about 21 feet. Under such circumstances, the pair of bullocks and three men will water half a local bigha in half a day, the work being such that the inferior cattle employed cannot do more. This comes to an acre in eight days, or at one rupee for the cattle and two rupees four annas for the human labour, three rupees four annas for one watering. Here again the tenant complains that he cannot afford to water his wheat more than once; the owners of land who got labour a little cheaper often irrigate twice, but the vast majority of the tenants' wheat, I calculate 70 per cent., gets only one watering or none at all.\nIt may be remarked that the systems of relief known in Bara Banki and Sitapur are not commonly used here; men work all day instead of half or three quarters, and get higher pay.*\n\nNorth of the Gumti circumstances differ slightly, and bullocks are hardly employed at all. Six men pull up the leather bucket, three are changed every hour for a spare three; thus, each batch of three works two hours and rests the third throughout the day. The gang consists of nine men, and three attending to the well and field as before. The water is about twenty feet distant, and the twelve will water about a bigha a day. Each man gets two sers of grain, maize, or peas, worth during the watering season about 26 sers the rupee. A bigha will then cost Re. 0-15-0 for one irrigation, Re. 1-8-0 per acre, but a serious addition to the cost north of the Gumti is the cost of digging the well. The springs are forty feet from the surface, and often, after thirty feet or more, have been dug. A stratum of wet sand intervenes, the sides of the well fall in, and the work has to be commenced over again in another place.\n\nIt would appear that the actual irrigation from wells is much less than what is recorded in the settlement returns. The ruins of wells which had fallen in before water was reached, have been regarded as sources of irrigation which had been abandoned, and which might be worked again. The cost of digging a well is about four rupees, and to this two rupees must be added for the labour bestowed upon those which have tumbled in. Each well then will cost six rupees, and will water about fifteen acres once in the season, therefore each irrigation will cost three rupees, distributed over fifteen acres for well-digging, or three annas per acre, in addition to the Re. 1-8-0 already calculated. Now, no wheat crop should get less than three waterings in an ordinary season; these would cost then Rs. 5-1-0 per acre, and the tenants naturally protest that they cannot afford to give more than one or two waterings from wells. From tanks they often water the lands bordering on them three or four times. In Lucknow every crop is watered if the labour is available; gram and barley are watered just as wheat and peas. Sugarcane gets four to six waterings; opium six.\n\nIn fine, the elements of expense in irrigation are three\u2014the depth at which springs are met, the character of the soil through which the shaft is sunk, and third the copiousness of the springs. If the water is 20 feet from the surface, if the soil strata are sufficiently firm to admit\n\n* The expenses of well-irrigation have been variously estimated. Mr. Ricketts, in the Revenue Reporter, calculates that the cattle travel up and down the well slope at the rate of two miles an hour; that in this way they will, with a leather bag holding twenty gallons, allowing half for wastage, water an acre in five and a half days. There is no allowance made in this calculation for the time the cattle spend in turning, nor for the time spent in shaking the rope to make the bag sink beneath the water. I timed ordinary well cattle to spend fifteen seconds going down a slope of thirty-four feet, and eight seconds in coming up, sixty-eight feet in twenty-three seconds. This will be two miles and ninety feet per hour; but they only effected one lift in each minute and a half, 67 seconds, nearly three times the time actually employed in the work of ascent and descent being wasted in preliminaries. In this instance the well may have been a bad one, but at any rate it is evident that an important element of the calculation has been overlooked. Persian wheel, have a greater advantage over the leather bag and pulley in his matter.\nof a twenty gallon bag or bucket, and if the spring will supply a demand of that amount all day, then a bigha will be irrigated by eleven men, or by four bullocks and five men in a day. The cost of this labour will be about Rs. 2-4-0 per acre\u2014that is, when well water is to be had under the most favourable circumstances. Such circumstances are however rare; they imply first class wells, good subsoil and springs, also an industrious population, which will work all day without relief, and be content with two annas a head. If any of these be wanting, as is the case throughout probably five-sixths of the district, irrigation will cost from Rs. 2-8-0 to Rs. 4-0-0 for one watering. The consequence of this is that crops which require two or three waterings for an abundant outturn only get one, and the crop is consequently a scanty one.\n\nIt may seem strange that human is cheaper than cattle labour, but such is undoubtedly the case. The main cause lies in the superior alertness of the men; the bucket when water is at 23 feet will be filled three times in a minute, while once a minute is common enough with cattle. The general use of cattle for irrigation is evidence that the cooly class are so well off that they decline to do bullocks' work. Their occasional use is only evidence that the owner has plough cattle which would be otherwise unemployed. The majority of the coolies employed at the Lucknow wells are hired men. There are comparatively few pakka or brick-lined wells used for irrigation in the Lucknow district. Their advantage consists in the greater abundance with which the water from the springs percolates in. The best service I have met with from a pakka well was 1\u00bd bighas per day with thirteen men; the cost was Rs. 2-3-0 per acre for one irrigation.\n\nThe great majority of the wells in Lucknow and, indeed, in Oudh are worked by human hired labour, although in many cases small farmers aid each other being then called 'jittas.' Cattle can be more profitably employed in carriage along roads than in raising water. There its plenty of employment for the labour which would be displaced if canals were substituted for wells. Very great advantage would result here as everywhere else from the embankment of the jhils. About 5\u00bd per cent. of the total area of the district is covered with water in the shape of shallow ponds or swamps, often not more than three feet deep in the centre. Of the 54 square miles so lost to cultivation at least 30 might be reclaimed; the area of the jhils would be circumscribed, the water proportionally heightened and deepened, the effect of evaporation lessened, so that the fertilizing effects of the water would be rendered more available and at a cheaper cost, while the unhealthy stagnation of shallow swamp water would be lessened.\n\nNo explanation can possibly account for the universal neglect to adopt such an obvious improvement, particularly when there are thousands of such old works scattered over the country whose age is lost in antiquity, but which are still in working order, and attest how certain and weighty are the advantages to be expected. It is strange that the agricultural improvement, which is most effectual in increasing food supplies, and which\nrequires the investment of most capital, was often carried out in the dark ages, but has since been utterly neglected. I have not seen one such embankment or irrigation tank in the district which has been made in the present century.\n\nIt may be observed here that tank-irrigation is the same as canal-irrigation as regards the cost of the human labour employed; a lift from one costs just as much as a lift from the other. I have here calculated the cost of tank-irrigation at eleven annas for one lift for one watering of an acre. Mr. Buck calculates that eight men working with two baskets irrigate an acre in the day. This would come at one anna and a half per head to 12 annas;* but it is strange if practically the same results are attained with two baskets as with one basket. The explanation lies, it is believed, in the differing size of the basket used. When the system of double reliefs exists as in Lucknow, the basket is heavier, as the men have only to work half the day. In Mr. Buck's case the Deorha relief is in use\u2014that is to say, half the gang is relieved every hour, and each man works eight hours; they use therefore a lighter basket, and the result is about the same.\n\nIrrigation is also carried on by the dhenkli, a long lever whose short arm is weighted with a mass of clay, and is pulled down while the long arm raises a clay jar of water. Under favourable circumstances\u2014viz., a good supply of water close at hand\u2014two and a half biswas a day can be watered by two men working all day; their pay will be three annas, and the cost of irrigation Re. 1-8-0 per bigha, or Rs. 2-6-0 per acre for one watering. Sometimes the earthen pot is pulled up by three men; five men will then water ten biswas a day if the water is within fifteen feet, and the cost is reduced to ten annas a bigha or one rupee an acre for one watering, but in this case the same five men being themselves the owners of the crop work all day without a relief, therefore I allow two annas a day for the labour. Water is very rarely so close to the surface.\n\nIn the case of irrigation from jhils and tanks it is very cheap, indeed, if the land is near the water or within a low elevation. The work is very hard, and there are always double reliefs. Practically there are never less than two lifts, and on the average four lifts are used. There are two men at each; the latter number of lifts then will require sixteen men to swing the wicker basket, and two men to guide the water in the field. They get one and a half anna per day, and half a local or small ser of parched gram at midday each; they will water one bigha and a half per day. The cost of this labour will thus be one rupee eleven annas and nine local sers of gram, equal to about three annas; this will make the cost of irrigating an acre once exactly two rupees if the water has to be raised four lifts, one rupee two annas for two lifts, and three rupees twelve annas for eight lifts.\n\nStrange as it may seem they do sometimes use up to nine lifts. At the ordinary distance from the pond the cost of giving sugarcane five\n\n---\n\n* In a number of instances I found that only ten or eleven acres were irrigated, and the people will only allow that area to be passible.\nwaterings will then be ten rupees per acre. One result of this great expenditure is that when the rains have been deficient during the season, the ponds are nearly or quite empty, and the sugarcane cultivation round them is abandoned, the ground being kept for other purposes. Sugarcane is not planted till April, and consequently the area of each year's crop depends on the preceding rains.\n\nGovernment advances for irrigation under the Land Improvement Act.\u2014Government makes most liberal advances to landowners who are willing to spend them in making wells and tanks for the storage of water. The terms have been recently rendered most tempting; repayment of the principal is not required till the expiry of six or twelve years. Meanwhile only six per cent. interest is required, and this is a strong temptation to the needy landlord who can only get money at eighteen or twenty-four per cent.\n\nThese masonry wells are fairly numerous in the sandy tracts near the Sai where unlined wells will not stand. In these wells water is met with at about 23 feet from the surface, but the springs are not reached till 45 feet or 30 h\u0101ths (cubit). A well nine feet broad, sufficient for two leather bags to be worked simultaneously, cost Rs. 10 a cubic foot, or Rs. 300; from this four inferior bullocks and three men will raise in a day's work only enough water for six or seven biswas. I have verified this from numerous inquiries. Valuing the bullocks' labour at one anna and the men at two annas each, the cost is Re. 1-14-0 per bigha, or Rs. 3 per acre, or 4\u00bd days' labour for one watering; this will be nine and a half days or six rupees per acre for the two irrigations necessary in this thirsty soil during most years.\n\nIt remains to be seen what interest must be added per acre on the prime cost. For this purpose we must inquire how many bighas are irrigable from one well. There are four months in the year during which irrigation of the cereals, rabi crops, and s\u0101nw\u0101n (a crop sown in March) can be carried on\u2014viz., from the 15th November to 15th March, 120 days; one watering costs then five days from one bucket, and 48 acres can be watered once from a well like this in the season. Interest at eighteen rupees per cent., the ordinary rate, would be Rs. 54 or above one Re. an acre, in which case the entire cost of one irrigation would be four rupees an acre, including three rupees for labour. But instead of one watering in the sandy soil where these wells are made wheat must have two, and is the better for three; opium must have four or five; s\u0101nw\u0101n three. Further, if two buckets are used the well gets dangerously empty in the afternoon, and it must be allowed to fill again, lest the hydrostatic pressure of the wet sand should force in the brick shell. Instead of 45 acres not more than 15 acres* can be watered from each of these wells, and the cost of irrigating an acre of wheat twice will be six rupees for labour and three rupees eight annas for interest, or nine rupees eight annas.\n\n* Revenue Reporter, Vol. V., No. IV., p. 214.\nI have met with instances in which the well was used solely to water the tenants' fields, and their rents were either not raised at all, or to such a trifling extent that the capital expended was money thrown away as far as the lambardar was concerned. In fact making brick wells for irrigation purposes seems a hopeless speculation wherever the springs are above twenty-two feet from the surface, and then only when there is high cultivation and a succession of crops\u2014wheat, peas, sugarcane, sanw\u00e1n, jethi dh\u00e1n, tobacco\u2014which together require water for at least six months in the year. If the wells are idle more than half the year they will not pay under any circumstances.\n\nIt would appear that most men who take these advances in Lucknow do so with no enlightened views of self interest. Some wish to please Government, not a few, it is to be hoped, desire to benefit their tenantry; the majority, as far as I have enquired, are deeply embarrassed men, who wish for a temporary advance to stave off the userer's demands for a year or two longer. Of course the load of debt is all the heavier in the long run. The system does then add to the wealth of the community, but too often it only accelerates and ensures the ruin of the landowners.\n\nPrices.\u2014Prices have risen very much in Lucknow. It will appear from the accompanying table that in the fifteen years before annexation wheat averaged 24 sers per rupee, but during the fifteen since annexation only 19. The real rise of prices is, however, much higher than what appears from these figures. Grain is supplied now by railway from a larger area, the city of Lucknow has fallen off in population, and money is very scarce; all these causes should have cheapened food grains, but the intrinsic value of wheat compared to money has risen much more than the 20 per cent. which would appear from these tables.\n\nStatement showing the price of grain at Lucknow from the year 1835 to 1870.\n\n| Year | Arhar | Barley | Peas | Wheat | Remarks |\n|------|-------|--------|------|-------|---------|\n|      | Sers. | Sers.  | Sers.| Sers. |         |\n| 1835 | 37    | 30     | 26\u00bd | 26    |         |\n| 1836 | 23\u00bd   | 26\u00bd    | 22\u00bd | 18\u00bd   |         |\n| 1837 | 25    | 22\u00bd    | 23\u00bd | 17\u00bd   |         |\n| 1838 | 25\u00bd   | 29\u00bd    | 23\u00bd | 17    |         |\n| 1839 | 24\u00bd   | 26\u00bd    | 22\u00bd | 19    |         |\n| 1840 | 27    | 35\u00bd    | 35\u00bd | 30\u00bd   |         |\n| 1841 | 24\u00bd   | 25\u00bd    | 23\u00bd | 21    |         |\n| 1842 | 32    | 35\u00bd    | 29\u00bd | 35\u00bd   |         |\n| 1843 | 30    | 34     | 31\u00bd | 28\u00bd   |         |\n| 1844 | 25\u00bd   | 34\u00bd    | 23\u00bd | 30\u00bd   |         |\n| 1845 | 26\u00bd   | 31\u00bd    | 24\u00bd | 21\u00bd   |         |\n| 1846 | 27\u00bd   | 26\u00bd    | 24\u00bd | 21\u00bd   |         |\n| 1847 | 25\u00bd   | 44\u00bd    | 29\u00bd | 36\u00bd   |         |\n| 1848 | 28\u00bd   | 33     | 26\u00bd | 24\u00bd   |         |\n| 1849 | 31    | 34     | 30\u00bd | 24\u00bd   |         |\n| 1850 | 38    | 34\u00bd    | 37\u00bd | 26\u00bd   |         |\n| 1851 | 27\u00bd   | 27\u00bd    | 34\u00bd | 27    |         |\nStatement showing the price of grain at Lucknow from the year 1835 to 1870.\n\n| Year | Arhar | Barley | Peas | Wheat | Remarks |\n|------|-------|--------|------|-------|---------|\n|      | Sers. | Sers.  | Sers.| Sers. |         |\n| 1852 | ...   | 41     | 59   | 47\u00bd  | 25      |\n| 1853 | ...   | 42\u00bd    | 32\u00bd  | 41    | 21      |\n| 1854 | ...   | 35     | 46   | 34    | 27\u00bd    |\n| 1855 | ...   | 30     | 44\u00bd  | 39\u00bd  | 28      |\n| 1856 | ...   | 29\u00bd    | 28   | 39\u00bd  | 20\u00bd    |\n| 1857 | ...   | 24\u00bd    | 27   | 21\u00bd  | 16\u00bd    |\n| 1858 | ...   | 29\u00bd    | 26\u00bd  | 37\u00bd  | 21\u00bd    |\n| 1859 | ...   | 29\u00bd    | 29\u00bd  | 37\u00bd  | 21\u00bd    |\n| 1860 | ...   | 42\u00bd    | 40\u00bd  | 31\u00bd  | 28      |\n| 1861 | ...   | 28\u00bd    | 29   | 28\u00bd  | 21\u00bd    |\n| 1862 | ...   | 49\u00bd    | 48\u00bd  | 47   | 32\u00bd    |\n| 1863 | ...   | 34\u00bd    | 37   | 38\u00bd  | 21      |\n| 1864 | ...   | 29     | 29\u00bd  | 39\u00bd  | 20      |\n| 1865 | ...   | 18\u00bd    | 17\u00bd  | 16   | 18\u00bd    |\n| 1866 | ...   | 16\u00bd    | 20   | 19\u00bd  | 13\u00bd    |\n| 1867 | ...   | 24     | 30   | 31   | 31\u00bd    |\n| 1868 | ...   | 41\u00bd    | 40\u00bd  | 45\u00bd  | 20\u00bd    |\n| 1869 | ...   | 26     | 25\u00bd  | 24\u00bd  | 12\u00bd    |\n| 1870 | ...   | 17\u00bd    | 16\u00bd  | 14\u00bd  | 14\u00bd    |\n\nAverage for 10 years from 1841 to 1850 ... 28\u00bd 38\u00bd 28 23\u00bd\n\nAverage for 10 years from 1851 to 1860 ... 33\u00bd 36\u00bd 32\u00bd 23\u00bd\n\nAverage for 10 years from 1861 to 1870 ... 28 29\u00bd 28\u00bd 19\u00bd\n\nAverage for 15 years from 1841 to 1855 ... ... 36\u00bd ... 24\u00bd\n\nAverage for 15 years from 1856 to 1870 ... ... 29\u00bd ... 19\u00bd\n\nScarcities and Famines.\u2014On this subject little can be added to the information contained under the district articles of Bahraich and Fyzabad. The famines of 1769, 1784-86, 1837, and the scarcities of 1861, 1865-66, 1869, and 1873, were all felt in Lucknow. They were all caused by drought; prices rose to 9 sers for wheat in 1869, to 12 sers in 1866, while maize and gram in July-August were at 12 and 13 sers for the rupee during both years. In November-December, 1873, cheaper grains of some kind were always to be had at 16 to 18 sers.\n\nThe subject of famine prices is surrounded with great obscurity, and annual average price rates are of no use. If the monthly rates are given for each grain, and those are only used for striking averages which belong to a recent harvest and the same one, the rise of prices may be traced with tolerable correctness. The following account of Lucknow famines is taken from official sources, and particularly with reference to that of 1784, it rather under-estimates the real extent of the calamity:\u2014\n\"The scarcity of 1784-85, alluded to, seems to correspond with that known as B\u00e1rahsadi, corresponding with 1198-99 Hijri. There does not appear to have been any serious failure of the crop in Oudh, but, owing to a great influx of starving people from the North-Western Provinces, prices rose, and the poor suffered heavily. Many slaves were then purchased. The selling price of wheat was fixed by Government at 9 and 10 sers for the rupee, but in the Unao district, which more nearly adjoined the famine district, 5 and 6 sers is said to have been all that was procurable.\n\nNawab \u00c1sif-ud-daula, with his Waz\u00edr, Raza Hasan Khan, and his D\u00edw\u00e1n, R\u00e1ja Tikait R\u00e1e, established charitable institutions which relieved thousands. The R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za and great Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, with Tikaitganj and several large bridges, were begun that year in order to afford work to the poor, and there is a general tradition that the work was carried on by torchlight, in order that respectable men might earn food who would be ashamed to be seen working by day.\n\nIn 1837 A.D. the price of grain was not lower than 8 sers for the rupee; there was drought, but not failure of crops. The causes of distress were immigration of people and exportation of grain. The price of grain was nominally fixed by Government, and exportation was prohibited; all chungi on grain was remitted; exporters were punished. Importers were rewarded with dresses of honour, and the sale to one person, at one time, of more than one rupee's worth was prohibited.\n\nIn 1860-61 the crop was good, but enormous quantities were exported by land and water to the North-Western Provinces. This caused a rise in price, and consequent distress. It does not seem that the rupee in this division purchased less than 14 sers.\"\n\nThe following price lists, extracted from the Government Gazette, are given. They are of value as showing the effects upon prices of past bad harvests and of prospective bad harvests. They contain all the important food grains except barley and kodo. The value of these several grains can better be estimated from the list of crops and estimate of their areas, given above in the agricultural section:\n\n**Statement of retail prices in sers per rupee for 1866.**\n\n| Articles       | January | February | July   | September | October | November |\n|----------------|---------|----------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|\n|                | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c. |\n| Wheat, white   | 0 12 11 | 0 11 12  | 0 14 1 | 0 12 9    | 0 13 1  | 0 14 8    |\n| Ditto, common  | 0 11 15 | 0 12 6   | 0 13 10| 0 12 4    | 0 19 0  | 0 14 3    |\n| Gram           | 0 15 0  | 0 15 0   | 0 14 12| 0 13 5    | 0 15 0  | 0 16 2\u00bd   |\n| Bajra          | 0 25 4  | 0 21 12  | 0 16 0 | 0 14 10   | 0 18 8  | 0 19 8\u00bd   |\n| Ju\u00e1r           | 0 25 14 | 0 21 3   | 0 14 0 | 0 0 0     | 0 0 0   | 0 22 0    |\n| Arhar          | 0 10 7  | 0 10 12  | 0 13 0 | 0 11 5    | 0 13 0  | 0 13 0    |\n| Urd            | 0 15 14 | 0 14 15  | 0 13 0 | 0 12 3    | 0 13 12 | 0 16 0    |\n| Mung           | 0 13 6  | 0 14 0   | 0 14 0 | 0 12 0    | 0 13 8  | 0 14 0    |\n| Rice           | 0 9 5   | 0 9 0    | 0 8 0  | 0 8 0     | 0 9 0   | 0 8 0     |\nStatement of retail prices current for the months of July, August, September, October, November, 1869, and January, February, 1870, in sers per rupee.\n\n| Articles          | July, 1869 | August, 1869 | September, 1869 | October, 1869 | November, 1869 | January, 1870 | February, 1870 |\n|-------------------|------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|\n|                   | Mds. s. c. | Mds. s. c.   | Mds. s. c.      | Mds. s. c.    | Mds. s. c.     | Mds. s. c.    | Mds. s. c.     |\n| Wheat, 1st quality| 0 12 3     | 0 11 13      | 0 11 1          | 0 9 4         | 0 10 4         | 0 10 6        | 0 10 6         |\n| Ditto, 2nd ditto  | 0 12 7     | 0 12 1       | 0 11 5         | 0 10 1        | 0 10 8         | 0 10 11       | 0 10 10        |\n| Gram, 2nd ditto   | 0 13 3     | 0 12 7       | 0 12 4         | 0 10 3        | 0 10 5         | 0 10 1        | 0 10 9         |\n| Bajra             | 0 10 1     | 0 11 2       | 0 10 9         | 0 15 5        | 0 14 12        | 0 18 2        | 0 18 11        |\n| Ju\u00e1r              | 0 12 12    | 0 12 11      | 0 14 9         | 0 15 14       | 0 16 5         | 0 18 0        | 0 18 6         |\n| Arhar             | 0 14 14    | 0 13 14      | 0 12 19        | 0 0 8         | 0 9 14         | 0 11 0        | 0 12 8         |\n| Urd               | 0 11 10    | 0 11 2       | 0 10 1         | 0 7 14        | 0 11 8        | 0 15 12       | 0 14 14        |\n| Mas\u00far             | 0 13 14    | 0 12 0       | 0 11 10        | 0 8 12        | 0 9 14         | 0 10 0        | 0 10 0         |\n| M\u00fang              | 0 9 0      | 0 9 6        | 0 9 0          | 0 7 10        | 0 13 0        | 0 15 0        | 0 14 0         |\n| Rice, 2nd quality | 0 9 14     | 0 9 12       | 0 9 10         | 0 11 9        | 0 11 4        | 0 12 8        | 0 13 2         |\n\nIn connexion with the condition of the people, some remarks on their food, its price, their wages, and their means to purchase it are required.\n\nFood.\u2014The food of the people is the same as that detailed in Kheri, except that pulses\u2014urd, moth, arhar\u2014are perhaps more largely used, and rice less. There is a crop nearly every month in the year. In January the sugarcane is cut, in February the tobacco, in the first half of March the peas come in, then the gram. Wheat and barley are cut in the second half of March. In May melons come in, and are largely consumed. In June jethi dh\u00e1n is cut. There is nothing in July or the first half of August except unripe maize cobs and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n a minor crop. With the 20th August come in the Indian-corn or bari ju\u00e1r and mendwa. About the 10th September kodo ripens. In October chhoti ju\u00e1r and rice; in November bajra, m\u00fang, moth, urd, and jarhan or transplanted rice; in December sugarcane.\n\nFrom September to March inclusive the principal food of the masses consists of maize kodo, and rice; the last two generally as pottage, with the addition of some lentiles, such as lobia or urd, either to the rice or bread. From April to August it is gram, barley, peas, arhar, &c. In Lucknow, however, the food of the people does not correspond so strictly with the proximate previous harvest as in other districts. There are greater stocks of grain in store, as there is more capital in this district.\n\nPeople eat twice a day. A ser of maize, fourteen chat\u00e1ks of peas, or thirteen chhat\u00e1ks of rice are considered enough for a day\u2019s food for an ordinary labouring man, under-sized as they are.\n\nFish is eaten by the majority of the people. The following extracts must be received with caution: the supply of fish may be equal to the demand at the price asked, but the supply during the greater part of the year is very limited indeed:\u2014\nThe Collector of Lucknow reports:\u2014\"The tanks and rivers are netted without restriction throughout the year, and necessarily fish, breeding or not breeding, big or small, are taken as they come to the net. The greatest destruction takes place just before the end of the cold season, when the tanks are drying up. There is no restriction as to the size of the mesh of the nets; the smallest size employed is about a quarter of an inch, but regulating it in any locality would be objectionable until there existed a well ascertained want for the passing of such a measure, as all unnecessary interference with the people is to be deprecated. Still,\" he continues, \"one-inch regulation between knot and knot of the meshes of the nets seems to be really necessary. The objections advanced against prohibiting the sale of the fry of fish in the bazar are ignorance of the ordinary policemen, who, being allowed to interfere with the fish-hawkers, would find in such a law a means of extortion, besides being unable to discriminate between fry and adult fish.\"\n\n\"The Tahsildar of Lucknow can give no approximate number of the fishermen, for this occupation is not pursued by many as their sole business, but principally by boatmen, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Musalman, labourers out of employ, and Kah\u00e1rs in their spare time. The fishermen castes are Kah\u00e1rs, Mall\u00e1hs, Koris, Kanjars, Jhabihalias, and Path\u00e1ns. The supply of fish equals the demand; large ones realize two annas a ser, and small fish one anna. The small fish are eaten by all classes, the supply of which by all accounts has remained stationary. Large numbers of very small fish are taken by children in shallow pools and lesser streams. The smallest nets have about a half-inch mesh. Fish are not trapped in the irrigated fields during the rains. Fishing is carried on by rod and line, casting nets, drag and hand-nets. The local names are sukhan\u00ed, pailni, chinta, pandi, khara jhansti, and halka, the various names referring to the same nets only differing in size one from another.\"*\n\nWages.\u2014Wages in Lucknow present somewhat different aspects in the urban and the rural portions of the district. They have been about stationary, or even advanced in the latter; but they have fallen immensely in the former, owing to the departure of the Oudh Court and to the diminished wealth and population of the city. Wages of ordinary agricultural labourers are now, as detailed in Bara Banki, five pice or six pice, according as they offer their services or are sought; or they get grain. Handicraft-men are of course better paid, carpenters get three annas in their villages, four if they leave them, smiths the same.\n\nLocal weights and measures.\u2014I have referred to this subject at great length in the Kheri and Bahraich articles. The local weights and measures have given place to those adopted by the English Government to a greater extent than in other districts, but the local paseri or unit of five kachcha sers is still used for rural transactions. It consists of 28 gandas (vide Bahraich and Fyzabad), being smaller than that used in most other Oudh districts. The ganda should consist of four maddu s\u00e1hi\u2020 pice\u2014a copper\n\n* Para. 280, \"Francis Day's Fresh-water Fish and Fisheries of India and Burma.\"\n\u2020 Prinsep's Indian Tables, page 63.\ncoin formerly extensively current in the neighbourhood, and weighing 270 grains troy; the paseri then should be 112 times that weight, or 30,240 grains, equal to two modern sers and eight tolas. The bani\u00e1ns, however, seeing their opportunity when the change of weight occurred, announced that the paseri was exactly equal to two sers; they therefore substituted two modern sers for the old paseri weight, still the unit of account, and for a considerable time, till price adjusted itself, they made a modest but certain gain.\n\nThe present Government bigha was largely used in Lucknow prior to annexation, and is now nearly exclusively adopted. The reckoning adopted was\u2014five cubits (h\u00e1th) and a hand breadth (mutthi)* make one l\u00e1th; eight feet, twenty of these, or 160 feet, the side of a square bigha. As a matter of fact, the bigha is a square of 165 feet, so when any fresh measurements are made in this primitive fashion the tenant gets a little less than he bargained for.\n\nLocal markets, manufactures, trade.\u2014There are weekly, or more often bi-weekly, bazars in nearly all the large villages, at which the population of the neighbourhood attend with their agricultural produce. Sometimes they are only khands\u00e1r-bhands\u00e1r, b\u00e1ngi baz\u00e1rs, or wholesale bazars, to which samples are only brought, and the business done on the sample. The larger bazars are called the khands\u00e1r or wholesale bazars, where sugar and large stores are sold (kh\u00e1nd, sugar; bh\u00e1nd, large earthen pot for storing grain). The chief bazars in the district are Mirz\u00e1ganj in Malihabad, and Gosh\u00e1\u00ednganj in Mohanlalganj pargana, and the Lucknow city markets.\n\nI have not thought it advisable to print the detailed price lists or bazar sales in this district; they are obviously full of errors. Edible grains are valued all round at Rs. 2-8-0 per maund, a rate which wheat only will reach. Again, more obscure errors are met with: in Gosh\u00e1\u00ednganj the sales of English and country cloths are recorded at Rs. 7,000 and Rs. 14,000 respectively. This would be an important statistic if true, but it is rendered improbable by the statement in the text that English cloths are used almost exclusively; and on inspecting the figures of Mohanlalganj, a similarly situated bazar, English and country cloth sales are recorded respectively at Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 400. In N\u00e1gr\u00e1m, a corn market, the grain sales are recorded at only 12,000 maunds. This quantity would not feed the population of the town itself, which is 4,900; and at the very short allowance of 10 chhat\u00e1ks of flour per head, or, say, five and a half maunds per annum, would require nearly 30,000 maunds of grain for its own consumption, without leaving any balance for exportation.\n\nManufactures.\u2014Manufactures are at very low ebb, and, save in the city of Lucknow, scarcely exist. It can hardly be otherwise, where the wants of a people are limited to their bare necessities. The arts and mechanics are represented by the village carpenter and blacksmith, the potter and cham\u00e1r. In the larger towns are the weavers, dyers, bangle-makers, brass-workers, and all the various dealers in food. The weavers, no doubt,\n\n* The mutthi is a popular equivalent for half an English foot; it is measured by closing the four fingers and extending the thumb. A mutthi is the distance from the knuckle of the little finger to the extremity of the thumb.\nat one time were largely employed in manufactures, but it is said that they have now but small work for their looms. The number of looms appear to be 1,474, the number of pieces turned out 89,159, and the total value is Rs. 1,53,470, or each loom turns out 60 pieces and brings in Rs. 100. If these figures be correct, there are more than two workmen to each loom, and individual earnings are very small. It is probable that they are no greater. European cotton goods are almost universally worn. They do not wear for so long a time, but they cost less money. Whether they are more economical in the end is uncertain, but they suit a people who have never at any time any superfluous ready money; and, moreover, the stuff is finer and more pleasing to the eyes. Most of the stuffs are used for dhotis and ch\u0101dars, shawls and kamarbands, and the coloured garments for petticoats. Amongst the weavers must be reckoned the Hindu Koris. They seem all alike, equally poor, and it is probable that their looms are not working for more than half of the year. It is said that in some places the trade has come to a stand-still. At harvest time the Koris are employed as reapers.\n\nThe manufactures of the district are dealt with at some length in the Lucknow city article, as they are its specialties. Cotton-weaving of all kinds, from the coarsest cloths up to the finest muslins, takes the first place.\n\nTrade.\u2014The trade of Lucknow is of no particular importance. It imports bread stuffs for the maintenance of its large urban population, also piece-goods of all kinds, arms, hardware, glass, crockery, and salt. It exports muslins or malmals, cotton prints, and brass vessels, besides embroidery, lace, tobacco. The following return shows the railway passenger and traffic receipts for 1873. The export trade only amounts to 4,391 tons, although there are three railways branching from Lucknow, and the whole district is close to steam communication.\n\nIn 1873 the traffic at the various stations on the railway within the boundaries of the Lucknow district was as follows:\n\n| Stations     | Outward | Inward |\n|--------------|---------|--------|\n|              | Passengers, No. | Total amount. | Merchandise. | Total amount. | Passengers, No. | Total amount. | Merchandise. | Total amount. |\n| Malhaur      | 4,606   | \u00a3116   | 11       | \u00a36           | 4,874   | \u00a390    | 37       | \u00a38           |\n| Lucknow      | 253,112 | 13,833 | 4,186    | 1,644        | 359,601 | 18,898 | 19,469  | 5,315        |\n| Harau\u1e47i      | 13,634  | 198    | 19       | 13           | 18,478  | 993    | 86      | 18           |\n| Alamnagar    | 18,769  | 404    | 39       | 14           | 19,930  | 911    | 642     | 150          |\n| K\u0101kori       | 9,702   | 212    | 8        | 5            | 8,601   | 174    | 89      | 14           |\n| Maliha\u1e0dad    | 14,199  | 295    | 17       | 23           | 13,428  | 266    | 89      | 13           |\n| Rahimabad    | 3,636   | 82     | 51       | 17           | 3,077   | 35     | 9       | 1            |\n| **Total**    | **312,648** | **4,391** | **...** | **...** | **315,679** | **20,407** | **...** | **...** |\n\n---\n\n**Note:** The table provides a detailed breakdown of passengers and merchandise transported both outward and inward through various stations in the Lucknow district during 1873.\nCommunications.\u2014The country has been well opened out by communications. There are imperial and local roads, and a line of railway completed. The imperial roads are three, branching out south, east, and north to Cawnpore, to Fyzabad, and to Sitapur, metalled and bridged throughout, and comprising, exclusive of the roads in the Lucknow city and cantonments, a length of some 500 miles. The principal local roads are seven; they are unmetalled, and connect all the principal pargana towns of this and neighbouring districts with Lucknow and with each other.\n\nThey are from Lucknow, (1) to Kurai, (2) to Dewa, (3) to Sultanpur, the sadr town of a neighbouring district, passing through Goshainganj and Amethi in this, (4) to Rae Bareli, the sadr town of another district, passing through Mohanlalganj, (5) to Moh\u00e1n, which, crossing the Sai there by a fine old native-built bridge, passes on to Rasulabad, in the Unao district, (6) to Malihabad, which runs on to Sandila, a large town in Hardoi. These roads connect the capital with the pargana towns, and the latter are joined by others running (1) from Mahona through Kurai to Dewa, whence it passes on to the district of Bara Banki, (2) from Goshainganj through Mohanlalganj to meet the imperial Cawnpore road at Janabganj near Bani bridge, and (3) by a road from Bani bridge through Moh\u00e1n to Aur\u00e1s, which is there crossed (4) by a road which, passing over the Sai by a substantial bridge, runs through the upper end of the Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s pargana and joins the Malihabad and Sandila road at Rahimabad. There is another road of some seven miles long leading from Lucknow to Bijnaur. The whole system thus comprising a length of not less than two hundred and thirty miles. They are well bridged throughout, and though heavy during the rains, are well suited for the traffic of the heavy broad-wheeled carts of the country and the soft-footed bullocks that pull them. Further roads are in contemplation, and are actually in the course of construction, for the connection of the various bazars in every pargana, but as they are strictly local they will find a more fitting place in the statistics of the pargana to which they belong.\n\nRiver communication.\u2014River communication is not much used. The river Gumti flows south-east through part of the district for a length of ninety-five miles of its course. But its course is tortuous, and passage slow, and it is not much used, except for the conveyance of wood and straw, which is carried down in barges, freighted sometimes with so much as forty or fifty tons. On the whole it may be said to bar rather than further communication, but Government ferry boats are attached to various gh\u00e1ts, over which, by the payment of a small sum of one, two, and six pice for a man, pack bullock, and cart respectively, travellers and traders can be carried.\n\nRailways.\u2014The line of railway is comprised in the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway system. It branches out in three directions, east, southwest, and north-east. The former passes through the thickly populated pargana of Lucknow to Bara Banki, and sending a branch to Bahramghat on the Gogra, passes on through Fyzabad towards Benares. The next connects Lucknow with Cawnpore, a line of forty-eight miles, and of which some sixteen miles run through this district. The last communicates\nwith Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and passing the large and important towns of K\u00e1kori and Malihabad, traverses the Malihabad pargana on its way through Hardoi to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, Bareilly, and Moradabad. The entire length of railway communication is 52 miles.\n\nCarriage.\u2014Traffic is carried on chiefly by means of country carts. There are six hundred and thirteen of these carts belonging, generally to Brahmans, Bani\u00e1ns, and zamindars, who take their own grain to the market. They are two-wheeled and about thirteen and a half feet long, with a bed which narrows to a point that passes between the two-wheeler bullocks, and is fastened to the yoke, broader at the top than at the bottom, and with low sides, which slope outward, and are formed of rope tightly bound up and down from the beam at the bottom to the rail at the top. They may be pulled by four bullocks or two, and if the bullocks be good, will carry from twenty to forty maunds, or sixteen to twenty-nine hundred-weight, according as they are drawn by two or four bullocks. The cost of these carts varies from forty to one hundred rupees.\n\nThe other means of conveyance are buffaloes, bullocks, and tattoos, or small ponies. The first will carry four and a half maunds, or three and a half hundredweights; bullocks from two to three maunds, if well kept; and the tattus from two and a half maunds to three maunds. These last are wretched beasts. These animals are mostly owned by Baqq\u00e1s, who trudge alongside weighted almost as heavily as their beasts, for they carry a maund on their backs, which they fasten by a band which passes round the bottom of the load and over the head.\n\nCost of carriage.\u2014A four-bullock cart will carry 38 or 40 maunds of grain on a metalled road, and .32 on an unmetalled track. With this load they will not travel much above twelve miles a day. For a journey of at least four or five days the rate will be about one rupee a day. One hundred maunds will then be carried one hundred miles for Rs. 20, which amounts to almost four pie per ten maunds per mile. The ordinary rate on the railway for grain is one-quarter of a pie per maund per mile, reduced in famine seasons to one-eighth. Railway carriage in ordinary seasons will be seven pie per ton for grain per mile, which is about 40 per cent cheaper than road carriage. A buffalo will carry four or five maunds, an ass a maund, an average man 30 sers, but headloads for short distances will reach 45 sers. There is still a very large traffic which has not been picked up by the railway. Gur and grain are exported, cotton and salt imported in great quantities, and still mainly by the road.\nCHAPTER III.\nTHE PEOPLE.\n\nPopulation\u2014Musalmans\u2014Hindus\u2014Agriculturists and non-agriculturists\u2014Castes, with their numerical proportion\u2014Professions\u2014Condition of the agricultural classes\u2014Tenures\u2014Talukdari families\u2014Under-proprietors.\u2014Sir land\u2014Chak\u2014Sub-settlements\u2014The mortgage Act XIII. of 1866.\u2014List of taluqdars\u2014Transfers of landed property.\n\nPopulation.\u2014By the census of 1869 the population of the district, as then constituted, was returned at 970,625, or 969 to the square mile. This did not include the European officials or British or native soldiery. Of this number 783,036 were Hindus and 187,589 Musalmans, showing a proportion of 80'7 to 19'3 per cent. In its proportion of Musalmans to Hindus the district heads the list; but a good deal of this is due to the city, where the Musalmans number 111,347.\n\nThe population of the district, as it now stands, is shown in the subjoined table:\n\n**District Lucknow.

Not more than twenty-five per cent. of the whole Muhammadan population are employed in the tillage of land. Of this rural population of 697,499\u2014\n\n|                  |       |\n|------------------|-------|\n|                  | Hindu |\n| 621,307          |       |\n|                  | Muslim|\n| 76,192           |       |\n|                  | agric. |\n| 392,638          |       |\n|                  | non-agric.|\n| 304,867          |       |\n\nThe last two classes show a proportion of 56\u00b73 to 43\u00b77. The proportion of Hindus to Muhammadans, and agriculturists to non-agriculturists, varies throughout the seven parganas of the district.\n\nThe proportion of agriculturists does not seem to depend much upon the amount of cultivated land. It ranges very high in Bijnaur, which has least percentage of all of cultivation, and it is lowest in Malihabad, which has most; nevertheless it is high in Mahona, which is very finely cultivated, and the conflicting results observable in Bijnaur and Malihabad are probably due to the facts that, while the population in the former pargana is very agricultural, in the latter it is altogether sparse, and the soil is occupied by numerous village communities who affect to be above the labour of tilling the soil with their own hands. The great cry is want of land, not scarcity of hands, and, except in the parganas of Malihabad and Mahona, there is not much land awaiting the cultivator, though, with improved cultivation, infinitely more could be got from the soil.\n\nCastes.\u2014At present it seems that the owners of the soil have but little affinity with the majority of its inhabitants. The census taken by the khasra survey was designed to show the number of members in each caste; but though much trouble was taken, and probably the results for cultivators are very approximately correct, the difference on the whole population is very considerable. While the census of 1869 shows 697,499, that taken by the settlement establishment shows only 594,642, or a difference of more than 14 per cent. But for the cultivating classes this is much less. The regular census shows 133,976, while the settlement census shows 127,621, or a difference of only four per cent. If this error be distributed throughout the different castes it becomes very small. In any case the error will not be very great. The following list will show predominating Hindu castes and the percentage that each bears to the whole Hindu population:\n\n| Caste     | Percentage |\n|-----------|------------|\n| Chhattri  | 7\u00b772       |\n| Brahman   | 8\u00b741       |\n| Kayath    | 1\u00b782       |\n| Ahir      | 11\u00b712      |\n| Gararia   | 2\u00b713       |\n| Dhobi     | 1\u00b758       |\n| Pasi      | 10\u00b755      |\n| Lodh      | 6\u00b717       |\n| Nao       | 1\u00b795       |\n| Kori      | 2\u00b719       |\n| Kalwar    | 1\u00b714       |\n| Rumbhar   | 1\u00b76        |\n\n* This and the remainder of the chapter are taken from the Lucknow Settlement Report, and the figures do not always correspond with later calculations.\nThere are in all 71 Hindu castes, leaving 47 to make up the remaining 5\u00b732 per cent.\n\nThus the predominating Hindu castes are Th\u00e1kur, Brahman, Ah\u00edr, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Lodh, Cham\u00e1r, and the two valuable cultivating classes of K\u00e1chhis and Kurmis. This is very similar to some of the results noticed by Mr. Williams in his census report, but the list given above would show the Th\u00e1kurs, Ah\u00edrs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, and Cham\u00e1rs are in more than average numbers in this district. In Lucknow they amount to 7\u00b772, 11\u00b712, 10\u00b755, 11\u00b724 respectively, but throughout the province they are 5\u00b79, 10\u00b74, 6\u00b71, 11\u00b75 per cent. of the whole population (paras. 282 to 307, 299, 319, Census Report). Opinions seem divided, or as yet unformed, as to whether these low castes\u2014Ah\u00edrs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, and Cham\u00e1rs\u2014are aboriginal tribes or not, and till we know more of their customs and religious practices, it will, perhaps, be impossible to say. From what I have observed I should say they were, and that Kurmis and K\u00e1chhis are not. The Musalmans number 56 castes or trades, as they would be more properly called.\n\nIt would be labour ill-spent to analyse the castes of the Musalman cultivators, for they amount to but 2\u00b75 per cent. of the whole population. But of the Hindus, who compose the bulk of the population, 24 castes, amounting to 94\u00b768 per cent. of the whole, supply the majority of the cultivators, leaving the remaining 5\u00b732 per cent. to be divided between 47 castes, the most numerous among which are the Lunias, Bh\u00e1ts, M\u00e1lis, B\u00e1ris, Gosh\u00e1ins, Darzis, Loh\u00e1rs, Khattris, Bhangis, and Mall\u00e1hs, all of which, except the B\u00e1ris and Loh\u00e1rs, are nearly 51 per cent. of them, agriculturists, but the Darzis and Khattris are not more than one-third so engaged.\n\nThe following 15 castes of those mentioned in the list given above will give the great bulk of cultivators. They are thus divided:\n\n| No. | Caste       | Percentage |\n|-----|-------------|------------|\n| 1   | Th\u00e1kur      | 18\u00b746      |\n| 2   | Brahman     | 9\u00b742       |\n| 3   | K\u00e1yath      | 1\u00b726       |\n| 4   | Ah\u00edr        | 14\u00b762      |\n| 5   | Gararia     | 2\u00b737       |\n| 6   | P\u00e1s\u00ed        | 11\u00b71       |\n| 7   | Lodh        | 7\u00b773       |\n| 8   | N\u00e1o         | 1\u00b711       |\n| 9   | Bagg\u00e1l      | 2\u00b76        |\n| 10  | Cham\u00e1r      | 10\u00b744      |\n| 11  | Kah\u00e1r       | 1\u00b765       |\n| 12  | K\u00e1chhi      | 6\u00b710       |\n| 13  | Kurmi       | 9\u00b749       |\n| 14  | Gumel       | 1\u00b768       |\n| 15  | Barhai      | 1\u00b713       |\n\nTotal ... 94\u00b768\nThus Th\u00e1kurs, Brahmans, Ah\u00edrs, Lodhs, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, Kurmis, and K\u00e1chhis form the chief part of the cultivators.\n\nFrom these working classes also it is that the troop of day labourers and coolies is chiefly recruited, excluding the first three and such as are obviously artizan and trading. Mr. Williams, in table No. V. of his Census Report, puts down the labourers of this district at 25,000. In comparing the non-agriculturists with persons engaged in professions in the table V. quoted, it is noticeable that the Thatheras (braziers), Bhurjis (grain-parchers), and the high class agriculturists, K\u00e1chhis and Kurmis, afford great numbers of labourers. The Lunias, of which there are some 1,200, are, when not agriculturists, everywhere the labouring class, and probably come under that head. The statement does not show any caste or profession that cannot be included in one of the several professions contained in the table quoted; but boatmen seem to be lost somewhere. They are entered as 15 only, while there are in the district 2,226, of whom 505 are agriculturists, and 440 non-agriculturists. With the river Gumti flowing through the district it is not to be supposed that these boatmen do not pursue their calling; and, moreover, the number of boats in the district amounts to 49.\n\nThe part of the table that shows the professions most nearly connected with agriculture, and is most interesting as a portion of rural statistics, gives the following order:\n\n| Class | Professions |\n|-------|-------------|\n| I     | Chaukidars (gorais) | 3,119 |\n| II    | Barbers (n\u00e1os) | 2,762 |\n| III   | Washermen (dhobis) | 1,948 |\n| VI    | Money-lenders (mah\u00e1jans) | 797 |\n| VIII  | Zamindars | 1,682 |\n|       | Cultivators | 1,33,976 |\n| IX    | Engaged about animals\u2014 |\n|       | Ah\u00edrs (herdsmen) | 1,930 |\n|       | Gar\u00e1rias (shepherds) | 1,899 |\n|       | P\u00e1s\u00eds (pig-keepers) | 2,202 |\n| X     | Artisans\u2014 |\n|       | Barh\u00e1s (carpenters) | 2,536 |\n| XI    | Engaged in textile fabrics\u2014 |\n|       | Jul\u00e1has and Kor\u00eds (weavers) | 3,851 |\n|       | Dhuniyas (cotton cleaners) | 1,667 |\n| XII   | The village dealers\u2014 |\n|       | Milk sellers | 2,663 |\n|       | Bani\u00e1s, Baqq\u00e1l\u00eds (shopkeepers) | 8,638 |\n|       | Tambolis (p\u00e1n-leaf sellers) | 984 |\n|       | Halw\u00e1\u00eds (confectioners) | 914 |\n|       | Bhurjis (grain-parchers) | 1,995 |\n|       | Tel\u00eds (oil-makers) | 2,887 |\n|       | Kasg\u00e1rs (potters) | 1,994 |\n|       | Loh\u00e1rs (blacksmiths) | 2,126 |\n|       | Mah\u00e1hars (bracelet makers) | 979 |\n\nIt is to these classes principally that the non-agriculturists in every village belong, where they are not Brahmans, or Gosh\u00e1\u00edns, or faq\u00edrs, or decayed Musalman gentry living on their capital without any specified means of employment.\n\nThe chaukidars are 3,119. They are universally of the P\u00e1s\u00ed caste, and by the village municipal system were entrusted with the protection of the\nlife and property of the inhabitants; but only some 2,000 of these are so occupied and officially recognized. Their pay usually consists in an assignment of from two to three acres of land, called a j\u00e1g\u00edr, and held rent-free; but they receive also small perquisites of grain, called basauni bis\u00e1r, from the cultivators (basauni, from basma, to inhabit; bis\u00e1r, from biswa, one-twentieth part). Sometimes it is a handful of grain, sometimes a small patch of corn left standing in the corner of the field. Originally the Gorait had the care of the crops and the fields, and the bis\u00e1r was meant for him. But some say that these fees are the remains of the P\u00e1s\u00eds' old proprietary right in the soil. It is calculated that there is about one chaukidar for every forty-five houses.\n\nThe table shows 797 mah\u00e1jans. These deserve a word. There is more than one professional money-lender to every two villages. The general interest charged is from two to three per cent. per mensem. A very common interest upon seed-grain or money borrowed for the purchase of seed is deorha, one-half as much again as to seed borrowed, on repayment at harvest, and a panseri, or five sers kachcha (equal to $2\\frac{1}{2}$ sers pakka), on every rupee per mensem. This latter interest is called up. In some cases the interest is one anna and half an anna per rupee per mensem, equal to 75 and $37\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. The latter is common, the former is rare, though it was a well known rate during the Naw\u00e1bi. It is said that of late years interest is getting everywhere reduced. But the gains of mah\u00e1jans must be very great, and a license to lend would be a fair tax on them.\n\nThe Ah\u00edrs number 1,930. These are probably for the most part employed in grazing and tending the zamindars' cows and stock. They get three sers for a cow and six sers for a buffalo at the khar\u00edf and rabi harvests. Sometimes they are capitalists, and have their own cows. These herdsmen do not seem to be well off in the world, and their cattle seem worse.\n\nThere are said to be 79,537 cows and 29,287 she buffaloes in the district: they are all in miserable condition. There are no actual grazing grounds at all. The best time for the cattle is after the rains, when vegetation is thick; and sometimes at the bajra and ju\u00e1r harvests they get the stalks of these crops cut up; but for the rest they are driven out into jungles to eat dry dh\u00e1k leaves, when there are any, or anything else they can find where there are no leaves.\n\nThe milk of a cow is poor and thin, that of a buffalo is better. The farmers reckon that the cow yields half a ser a day, and the buffalo from one to one and a half ser; and while it takes from twenty to thirty sers of cow's milk to make one ser of ghi, it only takes twenty sers of buffalo's milk; but if fed they would yield from six to ten sers. What the cows might be may be judged from some of the draught cattle; but the farmer is satisfied if his bare wants are supplied: and his wants are small. The draught oxen are well tended and well fed, and attain to a great size. They get from a ser to four sers of gram, according to their work, a day, and s\u00e1ni, a mixture of chaff and oilcakes, as much as they can eat.\nThe Gararias (shepherds) number 1,899, or nearly equal to the Ahirs (herdsmen). The number of sheep and goats is said to be 34,970,* but little stock of any kind is to be seen in the district. The sheep are principally reared for their wool, which is made into blankets. They are usually sheared twice in the year\u2014in Chait or March and Ku\u00e1r or September. The wool obtained at both cuttings will not exceed half a ser; a blanket will not be made from less than a ser, and is sold for a rupee. The above number of sheep then represent 17,485 blankets and the same number of rupees.\n\nThe P\u00e1s\u00eds tend pigs, and of these animals there appear to be in the district 13,674. They do not ever strike one as particularly numerous, and if this calculation is correct there are not ten pigs to a village. Swine's flesh is an abomination to all but the P\u00e1s\u00eds, by whom only it is consumed.\n\nThe Jul\u00e1has also include the Koris. It has been shown above that their trade has been almost driven out of the market. Probably the Muhammadans will cling to it longest. They are pure labourers in their trade, but the Koris eke out their living by reaping and harvesting the crops at harvest time.\n\nAll the Bani\u00e1ns and Baqq\u00e1ls are not shopkeepers. A good deal of the trafficking and carrying is in their hands, and they may be seen in small bands wending their way to the nearest market, each with a well loaded country tat or bullock, and not meanly burdened himself.\n\nThe Tambolis or growers of p\u00e1n leaves are a most industrious class. They have to prepare artificially the bed in which the plant is grown, and are occupied in incessantly watering and tending the plant. These beds are laid on the top of artificially formed banks. They are made of a fine dum\u00e1t soil, which is dug from the bottom of tanks and spread out on the beds to the depth of two or three inches. The plant is grown from cuttings or buds, and is sown in Chait (March), and comes to maturity in about four months.\n\nThe plant, which is a creeper, climbs up a pole of some four feet high, and the leaves when ready are stripped from the bottom. It is planted in rows, called mend, across the convex top of the bed, and the whole is walled in by low screens of fencing made from pat\u00e1war grass, and a roofing of the same is spread over the tops of the bed. They are generally from sixteen to ten yards long and six to eight broad. The rents are paid on the mend, eight annas per mend for the first year, twelve annas for the next, one rupee for the third, and so on.\n\nThe Bhurjis or grain-parchers are a class largely occupied in the preparation of food. Chabena is a favourite article of food with the natives, and in a bazar every other shop seems to belong to the Bhurji. They used to be formerly, and are now where the custom of payments in kind is preserved, employed in the weighment of grain, and they usually get half a ser of grain on every field of grain they weigh.\n\n* Oudh Administration Report for 1869-70, page cxxvi.\nThe Telis are employed in their legitimate vocation of expressing the oil from oilseeds and as carriers of grain, for which they keep buffaloes. Their gains in the former occupation are great. They usually get the weight in oilseeds of the oil expressed, and the husks of the old seed for khali or oilcake, from which the s\u00e1mi already mentioned is made. The payment is called perauni.\n\nThe zamindars or landholders are said to number only 1,662, but if all the members of the landholding families be included that have been recorded as possessing a share in the estate either in joint or several tenure, they will amount to 14,756. The mass of landholders are Rajputs and Musalmans. Of the 1,416 villages in the district, 546 are held by the former, 555 by the latter. The Brahmans hold 132.\n\nThe character of the Rajput is the most admirable of the three. He is manly and frank, proud of his birth and lineage, and of his old profession of fighting. His face is generally handsome and his physique good. He will eat meat when he can get it, and sometimes it is a boast of such a one that he never eats without meat (bina qaha). His dress is a dhoti and mirzai, or light thin jacket, and a light cap and gold earrings will complete his costume. Thus clad, and armed with a bamboo staff, which has been rubbed to a polish, he will talk to you and beat up game for you for hours.\n\nCondition of the agricultural classes.\u2014The condition of the agricultural classes varies. The Kurmi is industrious, cleanly, and intelligent, more independent and better off than his fellow workmen. But the Lodh, Ahir, and Pasi seem often ill-fed and very slenderly clad. They seldom eat meat, or, indeed, the finer sorts of grain. Their food is the millets and pulses. Their hopes rest in the finer crops of the rabi for their rents.\n\nTenures.\u2014Lucknow is a district mainly the property of small landowners; out of 1,498 villages in the old district 374 belonged to taluqdars, 87 in number. The other villages are either bhayyach\u00e1ra or zamindari. In the former a community of small proprietors hold a village with its demesne in coparcenary tenure, each shareholder enjoying a portion of the land, and also receiving a share of the rents paid by non-proprietary cultivators. It is a complex tenure. In zamindari villages there is no such mixture of rights. Several men are joint proprietors of the village, but they divide the rents only; no one has any permanent or other than permissive interest in any portion of the land. The two following tables are of great value; they refer to the old district of Lucknow:\u2014\n### No. VI\n\n**Statement of tenures, etc., i.e., taluqdari and sub-settlements, and air of

holders, 5,724 acres, 10,573 Rs., 13,619 Rs., 35,557 Rs.\nThe number of bhayyach\u00e1ra villages is 501, the area is 329,855 acres, and the number of proprietors is 11,574. The area to each proprietor will then be no more than 28\u00bd acres; or, to put the difference still more forcibly, while there are in 603 zamindari mah\u00e1ls only 2,832 sharers, or a little more than four to a mah\u00e1l, there are in the remaining 501 no less than 23 proprietors to each mah\u00e1l. It is to these villages chiefly that the cultivating communities belong, and the tendency to divide seems to be greatly on the increase.\n\nZamindari villages\u2014that is, villages held in common\u2014are rapidly becoming divided. Though all were legally equal, practically, in the Naw\u00e1bi, one man would be often found who would put himself by consent at the head of the community, in order that the whole might be better enabled to resist the oppression of an official or the greed of a neighbour. He became the head zamindar, and was summoned to the chakladar's court to accept the revenue engagement. The machinery of Government was not fitted in these days to cope with all the owners of an estate. The Government revenue was the great matter, and while one or two looked after that, the rest had their sir, for which they rated themselves at something less than cultivator's rents. Division of profits there was none, for all the collections were revenue, and a zamindar's real position in the village could only be surmised by his joint contribution to a matter that concerned the whole family, or common participation in any troubles that befell it. Moreover the pressure in the Naw\u00e1bi was greater, and there was an outlet for many members of the family either in service with one of the powerful and turbulent nobles, or at the court and capital.\n\nThis is now over: a head is no longer required, and the coparceners are all confined to their villages; for, to use an expression of their own, their only trade is zamindari. Yet the proprietor in severalty is little richer than the ordinary cultivator, whilst he has generally the position and liabilities of the richer zamindar. If he belongs to a clan which has settled in the surrounding villages, a death in his own family will compel him to call all the brotherhood together, and together they will swell the expenses depending on a marriage; then comes a loan or mortgage, and the pattidar finds it difficult to escape from the toils of the money-lender.\n\nThere is not much difference in the kind of property implied by a pattidar and a bhayyach\u00e1ra village. In the latter, perhaps, the separation of sharers is the more complete. It derives its name from the unit of land on which the whole community has agreed to base the division, and which is known as the bhayyach\u00e1ra bigha or the bigha of the brotherhood.\n\nTaluqdars.\u2014The table which follows gives the names of the principal landowners, with the area and revenue of their respective estates:\n\n| Name of owner          | Name of estate | No. of villages | Area | Government jama | Remarks |\n|------------------------|---------------|-----------------|------|----------------|---------|\n| Mirza J\u00e1f\u00e1r Ali Khan   | Behta         | 7               | 8,877| 2              | 10      | 6,420| 0  | 0 | Estates in Unao and Ra\u00fa Baraili. |\n| R\u00e1ja Chandar Sekhar    | Sissaindi     | 35              | 34,510| 3             | 0       | 37,008| 0  | 0 |\n| L\u00e1la Kanhalya L\u00e1i      | Jahraula      | 23              | 15,341| 1            | 30      | 13,771| 0  | 0 | Ditto in Unao. |\nAmong all these, almost the only true and good specimens of old hereditary landlords are R\u00e1ja Jagmohan Singh of R\u00e1epur (Itaunja) and B\u00e1bu Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh, a member of the same clan of Mahg\u00e1on. All the rest, with few exceptions, perhaps are taluqdars, who from small beginnings have acquired their estates by transfer or simple farm. By such means R\u00e1ja Nawab Ali amassed the greater portion of his estate; and three out of the four chief taluqdars, R\u00e1ja Chandar Sekhur, and the two Path\u00e1n taluqdars, Ahmad Kh\u00e1n and Nas\u00edm Khan of Malihabad, are entirely of recent origin, and owe their estates to what the dispossessed zamindars consider but hard measures dealt out to them.\n\nThere are 268 villages in the district as now constituted, owned by taluqdars. Whether these taluqdars recognize their duties to the commonwealth and their tenants may be almost doubted. They would seem to spend but little in improving their estates, little in promoting the comfort or happiness of the numerous classes of labourers who till their lands. If a mud well is to be dug, it is the tenant that finds the capital. If seed grain is to be purchased, it is the landlord perhaps will who supply the money, but at a rate of interest of 25 or 36 per cent. to be afterwards repaid with the capital. This is the chief intercourse of the landlord with his tenant, and in valuing his lands and collecting his rents lie his only acknowledged functions.\n\nSub-settlements.\u2014Out of the taluqdari villages some fifty-one and fractional parts are held in sub-settlement, that is, are held under taluqdars, who are the medium of payment of the Government revenue which they receive from the subordinate holders, the real proprietors, together with a fixed proportion of the profits.\n\nUnder-proprietors.\u2014There are in the district very few old hereditary under-proprietors, that is, those who hold on a feudal tenure under a\nsuperior lord of the soil. Some few there are who for convenience, or self-protection, placed themselves under the sheltering wing of a taluqdar, and thus escaped too burdensome a revenue or the raid of an enemy. These merely paid their revenue through the taluqdar, and the tenure which was secured to the latter under the conditions of the settlement of his estate with him, on the recovery of the province in A.D. 1858, has been maintained. But the greater number of villages that have been decreed on sub-settlement are those which were merely held on farm by the taluqdar, to which he could pretend no title, and from which the owners had not been dispossessed. These are those that appear in the estates of Jabrauli, Kasmandi Khurd, Sissaindi, Bayarigdon, and Rampur Bichauli. The remaining class are those in the estates of Raja Amir Hasan Khan, Raja Jagmohan Singh, and Babu Pirthipal Singh, and are merely assignments of villages to near relations.\n\nSir land.\u2014The sir of the ex-proprietor is the land that he held in his own cultivation whilst he was proprietor of the village, and which he has never lost, or which has been specially granted him as sir. It depends on the circumstances under which he has lost the village and the nature of his subsequent position in it, as to whether the right in it that he has secured be transferable and heritable, or heritable only. There are 1,696 of such holders in the district who hold an area of 10,573 acres, or an extent of land averaging more than six acres each. They pay a rent not much higher than that at which the zamindar rates himself, and which is based on his payment in the Nawabi. This rate, viz., that of the zamindars, is usually said to be one-fifth less than that of the ordinary cultivator.\n\nChak.\u2014The holders of chaks are 2,733, and hold 5,724 acres, or an average of more than two acres each. These have been variously acquired. The greater number of these are round qasbas or towns. They were often sold by the original zamindars for groves or granted for endowments of mosques and Hindu religious bodies. They were near the residence of the Government official, and were rarely assessed; and where assessed now, have been charged with their shares of the revenue laid on the whole village. This they pay through the lambardar with a percentage, which the latter has for his responsibility and trouble in collecting. In case any such property should lapse without an heir, it would naturally revert to the proprietary body as lords of the manor.\n\nAs a rule, it may be said that not many changes have been made on the summary settlement of villages of A.D. 1858-59. Of the 1,416 villages then settled subject to a future revision, save for the taluqdars, by the regular settlement, 1,218 have been maintained in the possession of the parties settled with. The number of decrees passed for the proprietary title is no test of change, for, by orders subsequently issued, even parties in possession were made to claim against Government to show their own good title. The taluqdars had 354 villages, of which 347 have been maintained. Some three or four of them were held on mortgage titles which have been redeemed. Some three or four were not held under their sanad as former part of their taluqa at all. Some forty villages they have received\nafter enquiry, partly by purchase, and partly by grant on their being declared Government property.\n\nClaims for shares have been very numerous, and many have been decreed, but it is more probable that dispossessed members who had been left out of the khewat have thereby come in, than that the share has actually changed hands by the decree. Sometimes the khewats have been very difficult to make up, as, where the zamindars have recovered a lost village, and no khewat existed during limitation, or where claimants have come forward alleging that the portion of sir they may have held in the Nawabi represented their share, though they did not exercise their right in the management, and it is difficult to say that this is not the case. On the other hand, it has often happened that a lambardar will come forward to upset a khewat that he himself agreed to at the summary settlement, on the ground that his co-sharers did not hold actual shares with him within the period of limitation. It is needless to observe that this has not been sanctioned. The courts have not disturbed possession where right or a title secured by adverse possession has not been shown.\n\nAct XXVI. of 1866 has not operated very heavily in the district, yet some twelve sub-settlements that had been decreed were cancelled under its provisions. Act XIII. of 1866 has been harder. It has been called a blot upon our statute books, and many mortgages have been cruelly foreclosed that the zamindars hoped, in all justice, they would have been allowed to redeem. It has been worse where in some cases they had recovered possession under the summary settlement, but had to restore on the titles secured by their unredeemed deeds. There have been in all 27,139 cases instituted in the settlement courts to determine rights in land.\n\nThe following table is borrowed from the Registration Report as showing the transfers of landed property in the districts:\n\n| Description of deeds | Number of deeds | Amount |\n|----------------------|----------------|--------|\n|                      |                |        |\n|                      | 1873 | 1874 | Total | 1873 | 1874 | Total |\n|                      | Rs.  | Rs.  | Rs.   | Rs.  | Rs.  | Rs.   |\n| Deeds of sale Rs. 100 and upwards. | 617 | 547 | 1,164 | 6,08,497 | 5,01,950 | 11,05,547 |\n| Ditto of sale less than Rs. 100, and upwards. | 1,107 | 1,017 | 2,124 | 44,844 | 41,162 | 85,506 |\n| Ditto of mortgage of Rs. 100 and upwards. | 2,402 | 878 | 3,280 | 8,92,441 | 9,15,123 | 18,07,564 |\n| Ditto of mortgage less than Rs. 100. | ... | 1,187 | 1,137 | ... | 58,445 | 58,445 |\n| Ditto of gift | ... | ... | 19 | 38 | 57 | 9,650 | 3,846 | 12,896 |\n| Total | ... | 4,145 | 2,617 | 7,762 | 15,50,032 | 15,30,096 | 30,80,028 |\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nADMINISTRATIVE FEATURES.\n\nAdministration\u2014Police\u2014Thanas\u2014Crimes\u2014Accidental deaths\u2014Revenue and expenditure\u2014Education\u2014Post-office.\n\nAdministration.\u2014The local administration is in the hands of a deputy commissioner aided by one magistrate in special charge of the city, another of cantonments, by one or two assistant commissioners, three extra assistant commissioners, three tahsildars, and four honorary magistrates. Besides, there are a civil judge and a small cause court judge, who have no criminal or revenue powers. There are thus seventeen courts of original jurisdiction; but of these two have no civil jurisdiction, two have no criminal, and four have no revenue.\n\nThe police of Lucknow is divided into three portions,\u2014first, the special city police numbering in 1873, 890, excluding guards on quasi-military duty. The area of the city district is 36 square miles, and the population is 284,406; second, the cantonment police numbering 61; third, the district police numbering 505 on civil duty, and 778 in all. The entire number of police is 1,729 to an area of 966 square miles.

It must be remembered in making comparisons, that the boundaries of the district were altered in 1869, and its area diminished from 1,415 square miles to\n966. Bearing this in mind there is nothing worthy of note in the crime.

The low caste man rarely travels beyond the limits of his pargana, and the pilgrim who has just returned from his wanderings to the Ganges will supply him with all his knowledge of the world. But class holds no communication with class, so that the diffusion of knowledge even by these means is limited.\n\nGovernment schools.\u2014But every hope may be placed on the schools that are being now spread through the country. The following schools have been established in the Lucknow district excluding the city:\u2014An Anglo-vernacular middle class school at K\u00e2kori;\u2014this is intermediate in rank between the primary or village schools and the high schools in which students are prepared for the matriculation examination. Five vernacular middle class schools at Malihabad, Mahona, Amethi (D\u00eengur), Mohanlalganj, and Aliganj respectively. In these the curriculum of the lower five classes is that of the village schools, but is more extended in the upper two classes. 67 primary village schools and 4 primary town schools in which the education given is of an elementary character. The curriculum in these last includes reading and writing in Urdu and Hindi, arithmetic, and in the higher classes mensuration, geography, and history.\n\nThe following return exhibits the working of the district d\u00e2k during 1876-77:\n\n| Number of miles of d\u00e2k line | ... | ... | 35 |\n|-----------------------------|-----|-----|----|\n| \" of runners                | ... | ... | 8* |\n| Cost for the year           | ... | Rs. | 2,000 9 1 |\n| Number of covers delivered  | ... | ... | ... | 19,190 |\n| \" of covers returned undelivered | ... | ... | ... | 1,779 |\n| Total number of letters sent to district post-office | ... | ... | 20,969 |\n\nStatement showing the number of articles given for delivery and those returned undelivered during the year 1876-77.\n\n| Letters | Papers | Packets | Parcels |\n|---------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Given out for delivery... | 19,842 | 575     | 69      | 483     |\n| Returned undelivered ... | 1,752  | 14      | 3       | 10      |\n\n* One runner has worked for a part of the year.\nCHAPTER V.\n\nHISTORY.\n\nRajput conquest\u2014The Musalman conquest\u2014Earlier tribes of Bhar, \u00c1rakhs, and P\u00e1sis, and ancient state of the country.\n\nOnly a few particulars will be given here as the bulk of the facts will be found related under each pargana.\n\nSome few of the Rajput colonies, as the Panw\u00e1rs of Itaunja (Mahona) and the Chauh\u00e1ns of Amosi, conducted their invasions under the auspices of, or it will be enough to say, with the sanction of the Delhi emperors; for at that time the Muhammadan rule in this province was little more than nominal, and all that the Rajputs effected seems to have been due to their own strength and exertions. The Rajputs, after the tide of their immigration had once set in, made themselves masters of the whole country.\n\nRajput conquest.\u2014Amethias and Gautams possessed themselves of Mohanlalganj and Nigoh\u00e1n. Subsequently there came to the former pargana a colony of Janw\u00e1rs from Ikauna in Bahraich, but they settled peaceably under the Shekhs who had invaded and driven out the Amethias from the north of the pargana, then known as Amethi, in the middle of the 16th century. The Bais to the south and Chauh\u00e1ns through the centre of the pargana held Bijnaur. The Bais invaded and possessed themselves of K\u00e1kori. Nikumbhs, Gharw\u00e1rs, Gautams, and Janw\u00e1rs spread through Malihabad; Panw\u00e1rs and Chauh\u00e1ns invaded Mahona.\n\nMusalman conquests.\u2014Then came the Musalman conquest. Little seems to have been effected by the first invasion of Sayyad Mas\u00fad in A.D. 1030. Traces of it may have remained in some of the old pargana towns, which they made their encamped settlements as in Nagr\u00e1m and Amethi of pargana Mohanlalganj, through which he is said to have passed; where muhallas are still existing containing, as it is said, the descendants of his old followers who founded them. But for a long time they did not dare venture far from any of these, or from the headquarters which he had fixed for them at Satr\u00edkh.\n\nThe next invasion was that of Muhammad Bakhtiy\u00e1r Khilji, during the time of Shah\u00e1b-ud-din in A.D. 1202. But he, too, seems to have left but little trace behind him. He may have founded the village of Bakhtiy\u00e1rnagar near Malihabad, and may have left some Path\u00e1ns in the town itself, but though they may have resisted any attack made upon themselves, as in the case of the Bais under the Bais R\u00e9ja Sat\u00edna of K\u00e1kori; they never ventured out into the surrounding country to colonize it.\n\nThe earliest Musalman colonies do not probably date from much before the middle of the 13th century. Amongst the first to come were the Shekhs of Kasmandi in the Malihabad pargana. Then came the Shekhs of Qidw\u00e1ra in the Lucknow pargana in the direction of Satr\u00edkh. Many scattered Musalman communities also are spread through Kursi and Dewa, but the native accounts themselves favour the belief that they\noriginated from Satrikh. The Musalmans frequently made short incursions from this place. One of the first places they attacked was the town of Dewa, where they seem to have established themselves under Sh\u00e1h Wesh, a captain of Sayyad Masa\u00fad's; and they penetrated in the direction of Lucknow as far as the town of Mari\u00e1on, where they met with a repulse, and their leader fell. In a village is still a tomb of portentous length, in which a nau gaza p\u00edr, so called from his height, is said to have been buried.\n\nBy far the greater part of the Musalman proprietorship of villages in the district dates from the time when a Musalman government was firmly established within the limits of the province. They were naturally attracted towards the settlements of their own countrymen, and Musalman villages stretch through the south of parganas Dewa, Kursi, and Lucknow up to K\u00e1kori.\n\nOut of the one thousand four hundred and sixteen villages of the old district, five hundred and fifty-five are held by Musalmans, eight hundred and thirty-four by Hindus, and of the latter five hundred and forty-six belong to Chhattis, and one hundred and thirty-two to Brahmans, leaving one hundred and fifty-six to be divided amongst other castes, the chief holders amongst whom are the K\u00e1yaths with forty-one, and Ah\u00edrs and Kurmis with thirty-eight villages. Thus Musalmans, Th\u00e1kurs, and Brahmans are the chief holders; and being but twenty-seven per cent. of the whole population hold nine-tenths of the soil, and even the proprietorship of the remaining castes in one-tenth is due to adventitious causes, and not their original ownership of the land.\n\nEarlier tribes of Bhars, \u00c1r\u00e1khs, and P\u00e1s\u00eds, and ancient state of the country.\u2014Next comes the question of the ownership of the soil previous to the colonization of these early Rajput and Musalman settlers. Their traditions everywhere state that they expelled certain low caste tribes of Bhars, \u00c1r\u00e1khs, and P\u00e1s\u00eds. Who the Bhars were is a question that still remains unanswered. Mr. Elliot says that they overran the country after the loss of Ajodhya by the S\u00farajbansi tribes. The country had then apparently relapsed into primeval wilderness. The native's only conception of it is that of a vast uninhabited jungle, in which none but saints and anchorites lived, who passed their time in prayer and meditation. R\u00e9ja Janimijai, son of Parikshit, grandson of R\u00e9ja Judhishtir, of mythical times, granted them the land in j\u00e1gir.\n\nThe foundation of many of the towns is attributed to devotees, as Mari\u00e1on to Mandal Rikh, Moh\u00e1n to Mohan Gir Gosh\u00e1\u00edn, Juggaur to Jagdeo Jogi, and they may belong to these times.\n\nThe Bhars then found the country open to them, and in this district they were certainly a dominant clan that ruled the country, so far south as the Sai, up to the end of the twelfth century. Their total extermination does not favour the belief that they could have belonged to the mass of the people, but as a proprietary body their disappearance, with the loss of their land, seems intelligible, and as a fact is common enough. They seem to be of aboriginal origin, and some say belong to the forest\ntribes of Kols, Bhils, Kirats, Hais, Pardhans, and Tharus, and originally came from the Tarai. Bhar dhos (mounds) cover the face of the country. They seem to have built in brick, which is more than their successors (the Hindus) do. The Kanauj dynasty before its fall made great efforts to wrest the country from them.\n\nAlha and Udal, Banaphar Rajputs, were sent by Raja Jai Chand, and first attacked Nathanwan near Bijnaur, which is said to have been held by a Pasi Raja, Bigli; they then advanced to Sarsanwan near Amethi, and afterwards to Dewa, but seem to have got no further. Oudh must have been a hot place for them. North from Bijnaur through Sarsanwan, already mentioned, lies the plain of Ganjaria which was then known as the loh ganjar plain, or plain of iron; so called from the warlike demeanour of the natives, and it seems to have given the name of Ganjaria to the whole of Oudh.\n\nIn describing the settlements of the Pasis and Bhars, &c., Pasis and Arakhs seem to have been in strength in Malihabad, and to have stretched south to Kakori and Bijnaur, and along the left bank of the Sai to Sissaindi. All to the east of them were Bhars. Then comes the question as to whether they were themselves low caste, and whether any other low caste tribes belong to them. Mr. Bennett says in his history of the tribes of the Rae Bareli district, that the Ahir women mourned for their Bhar kings, and gave up the practice of wearing anklets. It is said that none of the low caste tribes may touch gold, indeed, they cannot worship a god save through the medium of a Brahman.\n\nThe Pasis must have been an aboriginal tribe; they are disowned by every one else, and their habits would favour it. Their fondness for drink was notorious. There is not a story told of the conquest of any fort, but that it was effected by plying the occupants with wine. This is told of Bhars and Pasis alike. The natives connect them with Arakhs; they have an account of a Bhar dynasty founded about A.D. 918, by Tilok Chand, the head of the tribe. This chief fixed upon Bahraich as the seat of his empire, and led a powerful army against Raja Bikrampal of Delhi, whom he defeated and dispossessed of his kingdom. It is then said that he held all the country up to Delhi, and all Oudh up to the mountains. His dynasty lasted for nine generations or one hundred and fifteen years up to A.D. 1093. It ended with Rani Bhem Devi, wife of Gobind Chand, who died without an heir, and bequeathed the kingdom to her priestly confessor (Guru), Har Gobind, whose dynasty lasted for fourteen generations.\n\nTilok Chand is said to have been a worshipper of the sun. Near Bahraich is a temple in his honour called Baldark\u2014ark is the Sanskrit for sun,\u2014and he wished in imitation of the Surajbans to give a new and better name to his tribe. He accordingly called them the Arkbans, and to his own immediate family he gave the title of Ark-rajbansi. Later on when they lost all power they became known as the Arakhs and Rajbansi, which latter word in the usual process of decay of language, and the loss of its earliest meaning, became changed to Rajpasia\u2014aut ex re nomen, aut ex vocabula fabula. Native tales mostly depend upon the name, and his ingenuity seems here to surpass itself; bans has become\np\u00e1si\u2014not possible by any etymological law of change,\u2014and he has lost sight of his Bhar dynasty in order to invent an origin for the word R\u00e1jpasia. And here, as another illustration, it may be as well to state an account which the R\u00e1jpasias elsewhere give of themselves. They say that they are no more than a branch of the great P\u00e1si family which came from Gujar\u00e1t in the west. That after a time they fell out and fought; that in the battle some took to their beds (khatiyas), and were thenceforth known as Khat\u00edks, others took to the trees (b\u00e1ghs), and were ever afterwards called B\u00e1chals; that they the remaining and victorious section, received the title of the R\u00e1jpasia or 'conquering P\u00e1sia.' More native ingenuity; but the derivation R\u00e1jpasia is here likely enough, and has its counterpart in the R\u00e1j-Bhars, which are sometimes met with in eastern Oudh, and who must surely derive their name from some former times of conflict, when they rose victorious over their fellow-tribesmen. But whether there was such a dynasty of Bhars or not, or whether or not the R\u00e1jpasias are descended from them, the P\u00e1sis and \u00c1rakhs always claim to be of kin to the Bhars.\n\nLUCKNOW Pargana*\u2014Tahsil LUCKNOW\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The pargana of Lucknow lies round the city, which, with cantonments, is situated towards the south-west in latitude 26\u00b0 70' and longitude 30\u00b0 85.' It is very irregular in shape. While the boundaries of parganas Malihabad on the west and Mahona on the north approach to within eight or nine miles of the capital; it throws up a spur to the north-west between these two parganas, which penetrates into the heart of the pargana of Malihabad to a point about eight miles to the north of the town of Malihabad itself. To the east the pargana is bounded by Dewa, and to the south and west by Mohanlalganj and Bijnaur. The total area is one hundred and sixty-five square miles, of which ninety-six square miles are cultivated, and thirty square miles or 18,653 acres are said to be culturable, but practically the cultivation in the pargana has reached its limits, some 5,000 acres of the so-called culturable area is under groves, and a great deal of the rest is comprehended within cantonments, which cover an area of 7,265 acres.\n\nThe river Gumti flows directly through the pargana, which it enters at about ten miles to the north, and passing under the old fort of the city, which lies on its right bank, takes a bend to the east and leaves the pargana about eight miles off, to become the boundary line of that of Mohanlalganj. The course of this river is tortuous, and its bed lies low. At Klambagh, close to the city, the height above sea level is 403, and the water level at the same point is 341, showing a difference of 62 feet. Its current is generally slow, though rapid during the rains, and it is fordable at but few places. Its average breadth is fifty yards. The river, together with two small streams on its right bank, and the Kukr\u00e1\u00e9l on its left, which rises on the north of the village of Asti in Mahona and falls into the river below Bibipur, drain the pargana.\n\nThe land on either side of the Gumti for some distance from its banks is of a poor quality; it is either broken into deep ravines or divided\n\n* By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\ninto broad sandy tracts, or the banks recede, leaving low moist khadir, lands which are flooded during the rains. The last is suitable for rice cultivation, and the soil on the higher lands, which is light and poor, where not entirely sandy, grows light crops of millet, bajra (haleus sorghum), and moth (phaseolus acornitifolius). Now and then, as to the north of the city and the south of cantonments, there are some barren usar plains, but with these exceptions, the pargana is fertile and well cultivated. By the survey some 20-5 per cent. is said to be barren, but a great deal of this is due to the city and cantonments, and not more than half of the technically barren is due to unculturable usar. The irrigation in the pargana is low, jhilis are not very numerous, and water lies at an average depth from the surface of thirty feet. The proportion irrigated amounts only to thirty-five per cent., and about three-fifths of this is from jhilis. The crops consist of all the cereals and pulses, but the cultivation round the city and large villages, consisting of the higher class crops of poppy, tobacco, culinary vegetables, and a kind of sugarcane called paunda, of which the stick is eaten, is unexceptionally fine. The Kachhis, to whom this cultivation belongs, are almost twice as numerous in this as any other pargana of the district. Round the city, too, are numerous rose gardens from the roses of which rose-water is made by the perfumers of Lucknow.\n\nThe population is most dense; within the city it amounts to 3,68,977 or 2,102 to the square mila, but without the city it is 9,5,851 or 656; but it even then falls on the cultivated area, at the rate of 1,229 per square mile. The proportion of Muhammadans is high, amounting to 25 per cent. of the whole, and that of agriculturists to non-agriculturists is low, being only 29-4 per cent. But all this is due to the city. Apart from this, Muhammadans are 10-3 per cent., and agriculturists reach the fair average of 55-8. But the pressure of cultivators is far greater than in any other pargana. The average holding of the chhaparband is not two acres; and including the fields he holds in other villages, it will not, for the greater proportion of cultivators who are of the Lodh, Cham\u00e1r, and Pasi caste, amount to more than three acres.\n\nThe rents as a rule are high, though as usual the Chhattris do not pay much. Their average rent is no more than Rs. 3-14-0 per acre, while that of the Lodhs is Rs. 6-4-0, and the Kachhis pay an average of Rs. 13-10-0, while in individual instances in all villages round the city itself these rents amount to as much as Rs. 25 and 30 per bigha or \u00a34 and \u00a35 per acre. The pargana was assessed at summary settlement at Rs. 1,40,531, but the assessment now is Rs. 1,56,033. The revenue falls at a rate of\u2014\n\nRs. 2-10-6 on cultivated.\n\" 1-15-8 on cultivated plus culturable.\nand \" 1-9-0 throughout.\n\nBut in villages round the city it falls at a rate of Rs. 6-9-0 per acre.\n\nThe city contains a population of 273,126, of which the Muhammadan element amounts to 41 per cent. There are in addition five other villages with a population of between two and three thousand. They are\u2014Ujarison and Juggaur lying on the north side of the Gumti between that river and\nthe Lucknow and Fyzabad road; Chinh\u00e1t, at a distance of eight miles from the city on the road to Fyzabad, where a large bazar is held, and near which is one of the encamping grounds for the troops; Muhibullapur, about four miles from Lucknow on the right of the road to Sitapur, a place of quondam importance, which it owed to the old cantonment of Mari\u00e1on, where the troops were stationed previous to the outbreak of 1857; and Th\u00e1war, to the north of the pargana on the right bank of the Gumti. There are also 16 other towns with a population of more than one thousand but less than two thousand. They are Umr\u00e1e, Bhadruk, Bar\u00e1wan Kal\u00e1n, P\u00e1ra, Takroi, Jihta, Sarsawa, Dibaria, Alamnagar, K\u00e1nkrabad, Kanauisi, Gahla Gopr\u00e1mav, Muhamdinagar, Harchandpur, Kanaura, and Ism\u00e1lganj, and the villages throughout are closely packed. They are 180 in all, and average 540 acres each.\n\nGovernment schools are established in Ujar\u00ed\u00e1on, Juggaur, Chinh\u00e1t, K\u00e1nkrabad, Rah\u00edmnagar, and M\u00e1hnagar, and others in the city of Lucknow itself.\n\nThe capital communicates with every part of the province. There are metalled roads to Sitapur, which from there communicates with Sh\u00e1hj\u00e1h\u00e1npur to Fyzabad, which at Bara Banki sends out a branch to Bahramghat on the Gogra, and to Cawnpore.\n\nThe great stream of traffic passes south from Bahramghat and Fyzabad through Lucknow to Cawnpore. The road from the former place taps the Trans-Gogra districts, which export large quantities of grain and timber, and conveys in turn raw cotton and iron and manufactured goods. Agricultural produce is rarely seen advancing northwards to Lucknow, as may be judged from the fact that the market of Sa\u00e1datganj, the most southerly of the three great markets of Lucknow city, where grain from Malihabad and Bijnaur and the country to the south used to set down, has almost ceased to exist. The different lines of railway have given a great impetus to trade. These lines which take the same directions as the roads branch out to Bahramghat, Fyzabad, Cawnpore, and Sh\u00e1hj\u00e1h\u00e1npur, by way of Hardoi. The traffic itself pouring into Lucknow is very considerable. Goods for the year 1869-70 were taxed to the amount of seventy-three and three quarter lakhs of rupees. The chief interest of the pargana centres in the city Lucknow, the seat of Government and capital of the province.\n\nIt covers an area of thirty-six square miles. Its population has been given, and by it, it stands fourth amongst Indian capitals. Its greatness as a city dates only from the time of Asif-ud-daula, 4th Nawab of Oudh, who commenced his rule in A.D. 1798. It was probably at an early period one of the most important places in Oudh, and the chief seat of Government after the time of the emperor Akbar. It is described in the Kin-i-Akbari as \"a large city, pleasantly situated upon the banks of the Gumti, and the suburbs of which are very delightful (Gladwin's translation).\" The greater part of the city is situated on the right bank of this river; it has in recent times been extended to the left or north side. But its history under its old Shekh rulers, and its rise\nunder the Nawabs of Oudh, with the changes it has subsequently seen, will receive a separate and fuller notice. To the south-east of the city, separated from it by the old canal, lie the cantonments, which extend to a distance of six miles from the iron bridge, and take up an area of from eleven to twelve square miles. They were marked out and occupied on the re-annexation of the province after the great rebellion of A.D. 1857.\n\nLUCKNOW CITY\u2014General Description.\u2014The capital of Oudh lies mainly on the west bank of the Gumti in latitude $26^\\circ 52'$, longitude $81^\\circ$. It is 104 miles from Shahjahanpur, 80 from Fyzabad, 42 from Cawnpore, 199 from Benares, 610 from Calcutta, with all which place it is connected by railway. It covers 36 square miles, and has a population of 273,126, of whom $\\frac{3}{4}$ths are Hindus, the rest Musalmans and Christians. It is the capital of Oudh, and the largest city in the Indian empire, except the three Presidency towns\u2014Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay. It is healthily situated, 403 feet above the level of the sea; and although not the seat of a flourishing commerce or manufacture, it is still a place of considerable wealth. Till 1877, when the Oudh administration was amalgamated with that of the North-Western Provinces, it contained the central offices, and the principal administrators of an extensive province resided here. Many pensioners of the British Government and former Oudh kings still dwell in the city; it is the centre of modern Indian life, the queen of Indian fashion, and the best existing school of Indian music, grammar, and Moslem theology, at least for the Shias.\n\nLucknow, viewed from a distance, and not too closely scrutinized, is one of the most beautiful and picturesque large cities of the world. There are two noble mosques, one im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra of imperial dimensions, four tombs of regal splendour\u2014those of Sa\u00e1d\u00e1t Ali Khan, of Mushid Z\u00e1di, of Muhammad Ali Shah, and Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar; there are two great palaces, or rather collections of palaces, the Chhatar Manzil and the Qaisar B\u00e1g, besides a host of garden houses, pavilions, town mansions, temples, mosques\u2014all erected during the last one hundred years by a number of wealthy, prodigal kings, and their equally lavish courtiers.\n\nThe interior of the city does not correspond to its brilliant appearance from without. It has broader and finer streets than most oriental towns: this is due to the destruction of very many houses for military purposes after the mutiny. A glacis half a mile broad was cleared for the fort, and three military roads radiating from it were driven right through the heart of the city, often at an elevation of some thirty feet above the level of the neighbouring streets. Three other roads also branch out\u2014one over the bridge, and two laterally along the banks of the Gumti. The picturesque eminence which is crowned by the residency is perhaps the greatest ornament of the city\u2014an old mosque, a magnificent banyan tree, the lofty tower, and the stately walls of the residency, covered with moon creepers and dense cloaks of dark foliage, rise grandly above the numerous ruins interspersed with shrubbery, and bright with roses and oleanders. Near at hand is an artificial mound, whose sides are gay with parterres of flowers, and behind, half hidden by groups of gigantic bamboos, their lofty heads\nfeathering down almost to the ground, lies the graveyard, and there, among many cypresses, are the graves or cenotaphs of some 2,000 Englishmen and women who perished in the mutiny and sepoy wars of 1857-1858.\n\nArchitecture.\u2014Nowhere can we see more markedly the influence of an oriental court and its politics upon social life and art than in Lucknow. During the last half of the eighteenth century the sovereigns of Oudh were the chiefs of a great state, including Rohilkhand, Allahabad, Cawnpore, and Gh\u00e1zipur; they had great armies, and though singly they were no match for British forces, their pretensions on this head having been for ever set at rest at Buxar in 1764, their alliance was all important to British arms; they were necessary to each other to stand the rising flood of the Marathas.\n\nThe dynasty of Oudh was then also a young one; its founder, Sa\u00e1dat Khan, a Persian merchant from Naish\u00e1pur, was the greatest warrior of his time except Ahmad Khan. Even in old age the prowess of his arm equalled his military skill; his Hindu foes recorded with awe how he slew in single combat Bhagwant Singh Kh\u00edchi, and how his troops when almost beaten rushed again to the combat where the long white beard of the old chief was seen in the thick of the battle. His successor, Safdarjung, was a great statesman; Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, a valiant though rash soldier. Still his people tell with pride how he had almost won Buxar when his treacherous general of artillery loaded with hay cartridges, and the battle was lost, but not the honour of the kingdom. During the reigns of these sovereigns nothing was built except forts and wells. All three themselves took the field against English, Marathas, Rohillas, or against the great nobles, whose feudal power had reduced the central authority to a mere name.\n\nWith \u00c1sif-ud-daula a new political situation was developed; he was the contented nay the servile ally of the British; they had given him Rohilkhand; they were able to give him Benares, and he wanted them to give him over his own step-mother, the Bah\u00fa Begam and her hoards. Still the partially sinister influence of a foreign protectorate was not yet visible to any extent; he did not feel himself altogether independent of his people. His prodigality was not exercised upon personal objects; he built bridges and mosques and the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, the architectural glory of Oudh. It cannot, it is true, compare with the pure examples of Mughal architecture which adorn Delhi and Agra; but taken along with the adjoining mosque, the Husenabad Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, and the R\u00e1mi Darw\u00e1za, it forms a group of buildings whose dimensions and picturesque splendour render it one of the most imposing in the world. Nor was there any admixture of European systems, tawdry in style and bald in design as the details occasionally are, they are never during this period bastard. There are no Corinthian pilasters beneath Moslem domes, no false venetian blinds, no imitation marbles, no pea-green mermaids sprawling over a blue sky above a yellow entablature, none of the mongrel vulgarities which were applied in Vauxhall, Rossherville, and the Surrey gardens, and when expelled from thence took refuge in the Qaisar B\u00e1gh and Chhatar Manzil. The plans of \u00c1sif-ud-daula's bridge, fort, mosques, and towers are simple and grand. The\narches are the finest features; constructively they leave little to be desired, except a better material. The R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za is a magnificent gateway standing almost alone, yet the abutments are so contrived as to remove all appearance of heaviness; it is almost sixty feet high to the apex of the arch, which, indeed, is rather an alcove than an arch; the gateway is but the half of a huge dome, cut down perpendicularly, and the passage is a comparatively small square doorway in the base.\n\nA sensible change took place when Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan ascended the throne. He gave up half his dominions to the English, who unjustly, according to Sir Henry Lawrence, placed him on the throne in preference to the late king's son. Thenceforth Oudh was protected by foreign troops quartered in its citadels; the sovereign was a mere puppet as regards foreign relations; he was protected from rebellion or popular outbreaks by an armed force which could not partake of national discontent, or shake his throne. Henceforth the architecture was not national, because there was no nation: nor was it pure because a double Government and constant interference insensibly forced the architects into an awkward mimicry of the models then followed in England, nor was it devoted to popular needs; thenceforth the royal funds were not spent upon mosques, wells, forts, or bridges; palace after palace was erected, each more ungraceful and extravagant than the last. One modest mansion rented from a private family had satisfied the soldier chief, Sa\u00e1dat Khan, who was generally in the field; and this was thought enough during the first three reigns. One palace only sufficed the prodigal '\u00c1sif-ud-daula who spent a million on the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra alone, and millions more on the chauk, baz\u00e1rs, market places, and bridges which he built to encourage commerce. Sa\u00e1dat \u00c1li Khan although economical built several small palaces; but with Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar commenced an era of extravagant expenditure on purely personal objects. In the Chhatar Manzil lived the king's wives, in the Qaisar Pasand and other buildings his concubines, in the Sh\u00e1h Manzil his wild beasts. He himself lived in the Farhat Bakhsh, the Huz\u00far B\u00e1gh, at Bibi\u00e1pur, Chinh\u00e1t, Nawabganj, and numerous other palaces. W\u00e1jid \u00c1li Shah had 360 concubines, each with a separate range of apartments. The style was now avowedly and openly copied from European models. The Chhatar Manzil, if it were not for the gilt umbrella on the top, is an exaggerated copy of such a building as a retired hosier might erect and call Rose Villa.\n\nThere is little to remark further on this subject. The most debased examples of architecture in India are to be found in Lucknow. There are portions of the Qaisar B\u00e1gh compared to which the willow pattern or the pagodas on a tea caddy are works of art. In Lucknow alone has the oriental falsified Fergusson's maxim and become vulgar. Withal there are very many buildings whose sky line and general plan are commendable. Seen from a distance, too, the fantastic domes and pinnacles of the Martiniere, Chhatar Manzil, and Qaisar B\u00e1gh are very picturesque, while the more ancient tombs and minarets rise proudly and rebukingly above them, often dark grey with moss, or green with grass, while the others are blazing with gold.\nNot less remarkable is the contrast in stability which the ancient and modern buildings present. Not a brick has fallen from the vast vault of the imamb\u00e9ra now almost one hundred years old, and used as an arsenal. Huge 13-inch mortars, and 8-inch guns are dragged about its sacred floors, but the building stands firm. Of the residency also, built about 1780, hardly a brick has fallen; it was exposed to a five months' cannonade from heavy artillery at three hundred yards during the mutiny of 1857, yet the walls are quite firm, and whatever roofs were not torn down by the mutineers are yet almost perfect. In the Qaisar B\u00e2gh, on the other hand, although not thirty years old, decay has made great progress; one entire side of the main quadrangle has been removed, and the others are more or less ruinous. It was given to the taluqdars by Lord Canning on condition that they should keep it in repair. This palace is believed to have cost \u00a3800,000.\n\nOne feature of this fantastic architecture may be mentioned. On the top of any square building four flying buttresses are sent from each corner, not however to support any Gothic pinnacle, but simply to meet each other; no modern building seems complete without some of these, looking like a pair of shears, or the charred rib of some mighty ship. Gilt domes, made of copper covered with gold, gilt umbrellas, and balustrades of burnt clay, with gilt spikes, are among the tawdry ornaments which still render a Lucknow view so bright and sparkling.\n\nAs usual in Indian cities few buildings except mosques or tombs were built by the nobles of the court or the merchants. It was dangerous for any except the king's nearest relatives to build a fine mansion. Since annexation a number of town houses have been built or greatly enlarged by the nobility of Oudh. One feature generally present is an imposing gateway, consisting of arch within arch, rising from the same base, and covered with arabesque details, gaudily coloured. The masonry is so bad that houses built only a few years ago are already in a state of ruin and decay, and such are often represented to be old mansions whose owners since annexation are no longer able to keep their ancestral halls in repair.\n\nIt is the Lucknow plaster, as remarked by Lord Valentia, which keeps up its credit; the finest kind is made from the shells left in ancient lakes now dried up. When well done this chunam is really brighter and purer looking than marble, and its effects when lighted up with thousands of lamps is exquisitely beautiful.\n\nThe following is a quotation from \"Forester's Journey\" touching the state of the city during the nawabi:\n\n\"Lucknow is a large and populous city, but wholly inelegant and irregular. The streets are narrow, uneven, and almost choked up with every species of filth. The Gumty, running on the north side of the town, is navigable for boats of a common size at all seasons of the year, and falls into the Ganges between Benares and Ghazepour. A line of boats, extended across the river, forms a convenient communication with a large suburb.\"\n\n* Page 95, \"A Journey by George Forester,\" Vol. I.\nThe splendour of the Lucknow court during the reign of \u00c1sif-ud-daula far exceeded anything known then before or since. The province was then at its utmost magnitude. Unlike his father, who was an ambitious soldier, this Nawab devoted all the wealth of the state to gratify his personal taste, and to the accumulation of all the materials of oriental pomp. No court in India or Europe could rival him at that time; his only ambition apparently was to discover how many elephants the Niz\u00e1m or Tippoo of Seringapatam possessed, how valuable were their diamonds, and to surpass them.\n\nAt the marriage of his reputed son, Waz\u00edr Ali Khan, the furious youth who four years afterwards murdered Mr. Cherry, and died in Chun\u00e1r prison, he surpassed all previous efforts. Twelve hundred elephants* formed the marriage procession, the young prince wore jewels estimated to be worth Rs. 20,00,000, and these formed only a fourth of his father's stock of gems. The splendid buildings which now adorn Lucknow had not then been built. Two tents were prepared for the occasion, covered with the most costly English broadcloth in stripes of various colours; each tent was 120 feet long, 60 feet broad, 60 feet high, and cost \u00a350,000.\n\nThis vast accumulation of wealth was effected by the most crushing taxation upon the people. Four years afterwards Tennant, a keen observer, traversed the whole of Oudh, and found almost everywhere a plundered and desolate country. He speaks of the Nawab's territories, which, \"in defiance of the bounty of nature, display a uniform sterility.\"\u2020 In Rohilkhand, he says, not \"the hundredth part of an acre is under cultivation,\"\u2021 the \"solitude and gloom of the province\" were only relieved by a little prosperity where the eunuch, Mi\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s, administered a few districts with comparative wisdom and moderation.\u00a7 Tennant's account of Lucknow at this time is appended:\n\n\"I yesterday went to view this capital, which is said to contain half a million of souls. Happening to enter the town at the west end, and which contains the poor mechanics and labourers of every sort, I never witnessed so many varied forms of wretchedness, filth, and vice.\n\n\"The street which leads to the palace is upwards of five miles long, more than one-half of which you wade through mire and filth.\n\n\"During the lapse of time the streets sink from clearing or by the blowing away of dust while dry, so that they are fallen in the middle to the depth of ten or twelve feet, and are so narrow that two hackeries cannot pass, nor, indeed, any carriage however small.\n\n\"My palankeen was frequently stopped by the small asses which were passing along loaded with bricks. This animal is here so slender that a stout porter could have no difficulty in literally carrying both the beast and its burden. Solomon must have employed an immense number in\n\n---\n\n* Forbes' Oriental Memoirs, Vol. III., page 282.\n\u2020 Tennant's \"Indian Recreations,\" Vol. II., page 175.\n\u2021 Tennant's \"Indian Recreations,\" page 381.\n\u00a7 Tennant's \"Indian Recreations,\" Vol. II., page 405.\ncarrying the materials of the temple, if his asses were not of a superior breed to these of Lucknow.*\n\n\"The concourse of a great number of people perhaps does not anywhere improve their morals; vice and poverty are the only qualities that this people uniformly display. Some saunter, others lie down in a kind of dubious state between existence and annihilation; others still are intoxicating themselves with the hookah; a few only labour at their professions. The show of rich shops and merchandize is remarkably small, though it supplies the luxury of the court, or rather the palace; for here there is little affluence beyond the narrow circle of the prince's family.\"\u2020\n\nVarious other notices of Lucknow by European travellers have been consulted, but they were apparently so dazzled by the splendours of Lucknow that they have forgotten to note the condition of the country.\u2021\n\nPrince Solikoff, who visited Lucknow in 1841, declared that the surrounding country was a \"desert sablonneux tout \u00e0 fait sauvage et sans route;\" but he was delighted to perceive that \"le respect qu'on porte ici aux Europ\u00e9ens est vraiment unique.\"\u00a7\n\nMr. Fergusson writes as follows of Lucknow architecture:\n\n\"In an exhaustive attempt to describe all the saracenic styles of India, a chapter ought properly to follow here describing the buildings of these three cities,\u2016 though it is questionable whether the style adopted in them does not rather belong to the volume which is devoted to those styles, designated in Europe as if in mockery 'The Renaissance.' Whatever may be the case in the west, in India there is no mistake about its being a 'decadence,' pure and simple; and no caricatures of architecture are so ludicrous, or so bad as those in which Italian details are introduced, more specially at Lucknow, but also in the two other capitals. Still the tomb of Haidar Ali has, in spite of its details, a strong smack of the old solemn sepulchres of a better age; and in Lucknow there are some mosques and portals whose outline is still grand, though their details are detestable, and one building specially, the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, which when not too closely looked into is not unfit to be spoken of in the same chapter as the earlier buildings.\n\n\"As seen by the plan of the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, the principal apartment is 162 feet long by 53 feet 6 inches wide. On the two sides are verandahs respectively 26 feet 6 inches and 27 feet 3 inches wide, and at each end an octagonal apartment, 53 feet in diameter; the whole interior dimensions being thus 263 feet by 145.\"**\n\n* Tennant's \"Indian Recreations,\" Vol. II., page 404.\n\u2020 Page No. 405, Vol. II., of Tennant's \"Indian Recreations.\"\n\u2021 See Hodge's Travels in India, 1798, page 107; Archer's Tour in Upper India, 1857; Mundy's Sketches of India, Vol. I., page 28, 1826.\n\u00a7 Solikoff's Voyage dans l' Inde, Vol. I., page 186.\n\u2016 Haidarabad, Delhi, Lucknow.\n** Plan of Imambara at Lucknow from measurements by the Author\u2014scale 100 feet to 1 inch.\n\"This immense building is covered with vaults of very simple form and still simpler construction, being of a rubble or coarse concrete several feet in thickness, which is laid on a rude mould or centering of bricks and mud, and allowed to stand a year or two to dry and set. The centering is then removed, and the vault, being in one piece, stands without abutment or thrust, apparently a better and more durable form of roof than our most scientific Gothic vaulting; certainly far cheaper and far more easily made, since it is literally cast on a mud form, which may be moulded into any shape the fancy of the architect may dictate.\"\n\nThe following details of the foundation of the city, and of the various remarkable buildings in it are drawn from the settlement report from a local account of Lucknow, and other authorities.\n\nHistory.\u2014The earliest inhabitants seem to have been Brahmans and K\u00e1yaths, and they dwelt round the Lachhman Tila, or Lachhman's hill, which is now the high ground situated within the Machchhi Bhawan fort. Here, it is said, that Lachhman, brother of R\u00e1m Chandar, R\u00e1ja of Ajodhya, who had been granted a large tract of country up to the Gogra in j\u00e1gir, founded the village of Lachhmanpur, the origin of the future city. He was probably drawn to it by the reputed sanctity of the spot; for on the summit of the hillock was an orifice in the ground into which Hindus threw flowers and water, for they said it led down to the Sesn\u00e1g, or thousand headed snake, who supports the world on his head. A mosque now stands over the place, built by that stern religionist, the Emperor Aurangzeb, who had just returned from performing a like act at some sacred spot in Ajodhya. The village of Lachhmanpur was standing within the memory of man.\n\nThe next comers were the Shekhs, known in after times as the Shekh-z\u00e1das of Lucknow, and, later on, a colony of Path\u00e1ns, who became known as the Path\u00e1ns of R\u00e1mnagar. The latter claimed the zamindari up to the spot subsequently marked by the Gol Darw\u00e1za gate. To the east of this ruled the Shekhs, called the Ninbahra Shekhs from the n\u00edm trees that surrounded their muhallas. Their muhallas (quarters) extended up to the residency grounds, and covered all the land lying between that and the Machchhi Bhawan fort, but came under the demolitions ordered after the rebellion of 1857, and the land set free has since become cultivated and converted into rich market gardens.\n\nThis family of Shekhs had obtained a good deal of influence in the country, and subsequently supplied more than one member to the list of Subahdars. One of their first proceedings was to build a fort, which soon became renowned for its strength. It occupied the site of the present Machchhi Bhawan fort, and is said to have been planned by an Ah\u00edr named Likhna, and to have been called after him the Qila Likhna. As the Shekhs prospered and increased, a small town grew up round them, which from the two names of Lachhmanpur and Likhna got the name of Lucknow. It is impossible to give the exact date of the imposition of this new name, but it certainly was current previous to the reign of Akbar. To give an example of the prosperity of this town, the Shekhs have\na story, that when in 1540 A.D., the Emperor Humayun went down to Jaunpur to fight Sher Shah, then king of Jaunpur, and subsequently Emperor of Delhi, he retreated after his defeat via Sultanpur, Lucknow, and Pilibhit to Kashmir, and on his way stopped four hours in Lucknow, and that beaten and dispirited as his force was, and therefore probably little able to compel obedience, they collected for him in that short time Rs. 10,000 in cash and fifty horses. That such a story should prevail, however much exaggerated, is in itself a proof that Lucknow was then a wealthy and flourishing town.\n\nWe hear mention made of the title of Subahdar of Oudh as early as 1280 A.D., but the title could not properly be given till in 1590 A.D., when Akbar divided the empire of Hindustan into twelve subahs, of which Oudh was one. The boundaries of the subah differed from those of the present province of Oudh, chiefly in the fact that they included part of the Gorakhpur district, but excluded Farrukhabad, and a large part of what is now the Fyzabad district, of this subah it is impossible to say that any one place was the capital. The subahdars seem to have been constantly changed, seldom keeping the dignity more than three or four years. Most of them were Delhi favourites, who remained at court the greater part of the year, and then came down to Oudh to collect revenue, marched about the districts without halting, and when they had got all they could went back again. When any inhabitant of Lucknow was made subahdar, he would naturally make Lucknow his headquarters, and in the same way with other places.\n\nThe growth of the city.\u2014Not much was added to the city till up to the middle of the sixteenth century, and its subsequent extension seems to belong to three periods. First that of the Emperor Akbar, who seems to have taken a great liking to the place, when muhallas were built to the south along the line of the chauk. Secondly that of Asif-ud-daula, under whom the greatest extensions in the city were made. In his time all the central parts of the city were built, and fifty-two villages are said to have been taken up. And lastly, that of the fifth Nawab, Sadat Ali Khan, brother and successor of Asif-ud-daula, who built all the city which stretched towards the east. The present oldest inhabited parts are the old Hindu wards\u2014the Bajpe,* Katari, Sendhi, Banjari, and Ahiritolas, which are situated round and to the west of the chauk.\n\nIn the time of the Emperor Akbar one of the principal sections of the inhabitants was still the Brahmins, and the free-thinking monarch, wishing to do them an honour, caused the Bajpe sacrifice to be performed, and gave them a lakh of rupees; from which time they became known as the Bajpe Brahmins of Lucknow.\n\nMirza Salim Shah,\u2020 the son of the Emperor, founded Mirza Mandi, part of which lies to the west of the enceinte of the present fort. Jawshir Khan was subahdar at the end of Akbar's reign, and Qazi Mahmud of\n\n* Since demolished.\n\u2020 Afterwards known as Jahangir.\nBilgr\u00e1m, his N\u00e1ib, built Mahm\u00fadnagar and Shahganj to the right and left of the chauk, and the Akbari Darw\u00e1za at the southern end. During the reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, Lact called Lucknow a \"magnum empirium.\"*\n\nThe next subahdar that is mentioned is Sultan Ali Shah Quli Khan, of the time of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, who had two sons, Mirza F\u00e1zil and Mans\u00far, who built F\u00e1zilnagar and Mans\u00farnagar in the same line as the chauk further south. Ashraf Ali Khan, a Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, of the same time, built Ashrafabad on the east side of the chauk, and his brother built Musharrafabad or Naubasta, a continuation of it to the south. P\u00edr Kh\u00e1n, another Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r, built Garhi P\u00edr Khan, which lies to the west of the city in the Daulatganj th\u00e1na.\n\nThe muhalla of R\u00e1ni Katra, on the east of Daulatganj th\u00e1na, was built by the wife of Girdh\u00e1 N\u00e1ga, Subahdar in the time of Emperor Muham-mad Shah. This Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r was the nephew of Chhab\u00edle R\u00e1m, Governor of Allahabad, who, on his uncle's death, raised a rebellion and attempted to hold for himself the province of which his uncle had been governor, but he submitted in time, and was appointed to the governorship of Oudh (Sair-ul-Muta\u00e1khir\u00edn).\n\nThe present Machchhi Bhawan fort includes a much larger space than the old fort of that name, which consisted only of the building on the south of the road, noticeable for its round earthen bastions. This was the old fort of Lucknow, and was famous for its strength fully two centuries ago. According to an old proverb, he who holds Machchhi Bhawan holds Lucknow. The high ground across the road, within the defences of the fort surmounted by a small mosque, is Lachhman Tila, the site of the original Lachhmanpur. Behind the Machchhi Bhawan itself, in a southwest direction, an open space occupied by ordnance stores marks the sites of the Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Mahla and Pach Mahla, the oldest houses in Luck-now, built by the family of Shekhs, who formerly owned territory here. When Sa\u00e1dat Khan, the first member of the late reigning family, came here as Subahdar in 1732 A.D., he hired these houses from the owners at a monthly rent of Rs. 565. The money was paid at first, but, by a natural transition of sentiment, his successors got into the habit of looking on the houses as their own, and after Safdarjang and Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula had respectively written agreements to pay rent, but had never done it, \u00c1sif-ud-daula gave up that farce altogether, and confiscated the houses outright. It is well known how, on the 1st of July, 1857, the garrison which held this fort evacuated it and joined the Residency, and how skilfully and successfully it was blown up by the retreating party.\n\nSa\u00e1dat Khan was made Governor in A.D. 1732, but found his authority contested by the Shekhs of Lucknow. They had now for a long time been celebrated, and their power may be attested by the fact that their family supplied more than one of the Governors of Oudh. It is said they opposed his entry at the Akbari Darw\u00e1za, and he had to pitch outside; but he took the gate by the time-honoured stratagem of a banquet, at which he left the Shekhs carousing and entered the city. This was the\n\n* Lact's India, Ver. Ed., 1631, page 70.\nlast of the Shekhs. They had a drawn sword pendent in their gateway, the Shekhan Darw\u00e1za, to which they made all newcomers bow as token of their supremacy, and this was pulled down by the new governor, and bowed to no more. Sa\u00e1dat Khan built the Katras of Sayyad Husen Khan, Ab\u00fa-Tur\u00e1b Khan, B\u00e1g Maha Nar\u00e1n in the chauk; those of Khud\u00e1y\u00e1r Khan, Bizan Beg Khan, in the Sa\u00e1datganj th\u00e1na; of Muhammad Ali Khan, and Sar\u00e1e M\u00e1l\u00ed Khan in Daulatganj; and of Ism\u00e1\u00edlganj, since demolished, to the east of the fort.\n\nAbul-Mans\u00far Khan, his son-in-law and nephew, (A.D. 1743), the Nawab Waz\u00edr lived at Delhi, but he built the fort of Jal\u00e1labad, some three miles to the south of the city, for the intimidation of the Bais of Baisw\u00e1ra, and took from the Shekhs their Panch Mahla or five-storied house, giving them in exchange seven hundred acres of land in Dugaww\u00e1n and re-building for himself their old stronghold, which was thenceforth called the Machchhi Bhawan fort from the Machchhi, the fish, which formed the crest of the S\u00fabahdar. And Newal R\u00e1\u00e9, his N\u00e1ib, sank the wells of the stone bridge that leads over the river by the Machchhi Bhawan fort, but he did not live to complete it. He was soon afterwards killed in the fight with Ahmad Khan Bangash, Nawab of Farukhabad, and it was not finished till the time of \u00c1sif-ud-daula. The bridge was for a long time the only one across the river, and the principal line of traffic to Sitapur, Fyzabad, and the Trans-Gumti districts. Abul-Mans\u00far Khan also built a thatched house, a 'bangla,' at Fyzabad, which became, under Shuja-ud-daula, the capital of the province, and is still often known by the name of 'bangla.'\n\nAfter the battle of Buxar, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula (A.D. 1753), son of Safdar-jang, dwelt at Fyzabad, and the city received no additions during his rule.\n\nBut \u00c1sif-ud-daula (A.D. 1775), son of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, after his quarrel with his mother, returned to Lucknow, and the greatness of the city dates from his time. He built the Daulatk\u00e1h\u00e1na along the banks of the river to the west of the fort, the R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za, the fine old gateway that still leads out of the Machchhi Bhawan fort, and the great im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra where he lies buried. This edifice was built in the year of the great famine in A.D. 1784, to give some relief to the famine-stricken people. It is said that many of the respectable inhabitants of the city were compelled by want to place themselves amongst the workmen, and that to save their honour and keep them unknown, their names were told over, and their wages always paid at night. This building may be said to consist of one large hall of immense size and magnificence. Its dimensions are 167 feet long by 52 broad, and is said to have cost a million of money in building. The magnificent ornaments and gaudy decorations with which, as is wont with im\u00e1mb\u00e1ras, its walls were covered in those days are now gone; and being within the walls of the fort, it is used as an arsenal for the stores of the garrison. The architects were invited to submit their plans to a competition; \u00c1sif-ud-daula only stipulating that the building should be no copy of any other work, and that it should surpass anything of the kind ever built in beauty and magnificence. Kif\u00e1yat-ulla was the name of the successful competitor, and it would be hard to say that his concep-\ntion, as it stands before us in the present day, falls at all short of the large and liberal stipulations of the monarch. The building is as solid as it is graceful, built from very deep foundations, and no wood-work is used throughout. Asif-ud-daula, at his death, was buried in it.\n\nThe Residency, standing on a considerable elevation about three hundred yards from the bank of the Gumti, was another of the works completed by this sovereign. The Residency is far too famous a place, and too generally known to require a very detailed description. When Asif-ud-daula resided in his palace, the Daulatkhana, the Resident was accommodated in one of the buildings attached to it; but when Safdar Ali made the Farhat Bakhsh his own dwelling place, he built the Residency close to it. At first no military guard was attached to the Resident, but when Colonel Bailey held this office, a guard of honour was appointed, and a house built for it by Safdar Ali close to the gate of the Residency enclosure, which thus obtained its world-famous name of the Bailey-guard gate. The plans and descriptions given in Mr. Gubbins' and other books are very full and complete.\n\nOutside the city and across the river is to be found the palace of Bibiapur; it was built by Nawab Asif-ud-daula as a country residence, in which to enjoy hunting and other sports. When a change of residents took place, the new resident on his first arrival used to take up his abode here. The next day the Nawab Wazir came to meet him with a procession, and conducted him to the Residency, riding with him on one elephant. When it was decided to depose Wazir Ali Khan, the adopted son of Asif-ud-daula, in favour of Safdar Ali Khan, it was in this place, according to native report, that the Governor-General Lord Teignmouth held a great darbar of all the Lucknow court, and informed Wazir Ali of the order for his deposition, and from thence he sent him off to Benares, which was the place fixed on as his residence.\n\nThe country houses at Chinhat, also the garden pavilions at Aish Bagh and Char Bagh (the latter now occupied by the railway station), were built by Asif-ud-daula, as were also the Yahiaganj and stables annexed. The Wazirganj that gives its name to the present police thana, which he founded in the name of his adopted son Wazir Ali Khan; Amanganj, Fatehganj, Rakabganj, the Nakhkhas, Daulatganj, Beganganj, and Nawabganj,\u2014these are all situated in the Wazirganj and chauk thanas.\n\nOther Ganjes founded in his time were\u2014\n\nThe Ahata Khansaman, built by the king's chamberlain, who on its completion invited the Nawab to an entertainment in it.\n\nThe Takaitganj and the Bazair Takait Rae, which are both in the chauk, built by the king's prime minister Maharaja Tikait Rae.\n\nThe Tirmaniganj.\nThe Tikri.\nThe Chhoni Hasan-ud-din Khan.\nThe Hasanganj Baloli.\nThe Bhawaniganj.\nThe B\u00e1lakganj and the Kashm\u00edri Muhalla, which are in the Sa\u00e1datganj th\u00e1na.\n\nThe Ah\u00e1ta S\u00farat Singh.\nThe Niw\u00e1zganj.\nThe Tahs\u00ednganj.\n\nThe Khud\u00e1ganj of Nagaria, which was founded by the mother of \u00c1sif-ud-daula in the same day on which she laid the first stone of Aligauj, on the north side of the river.\n\nThe Ambarganj.\nThe Mahb\u00fabganj.\nThe Top Darw\u00e1za, in the Daulatganj th\u00e1na.\nThe Khay\u00e1liganj.\n\nThe baz\u00e1r Jha\u00fal\u00e1l, in Waz\u00edrganj, founded by Mahar\u00e1ja Jh\u00e1\u00fal\u00e1l, K\u00e1yath, finance minister.\n\nHasanganj was also founded by Hasan Raza Khan on the north side of the river.\n\nThe people are never tired of talking of the liberality of \u00c1sif-ud-daula and his munificence. His name is first on the lips of the Bani\u00e1n, and as he takes his seat in his shop in the morning, he is wont to repeat a distich, somewhat profane, in his honour\u2014\n\nJis ko na de Maula,\nTis ko de \u00c1sif-ud-daula.\nTo whom the Lord does not give,\n'\u00c1sif-ud-daula will'.\n\nThe following building though constructed by a private individual deserves mention. The Martini\u00e8re, also known by the name of Constantia, was built by General Claude Martin. He designed the plan and elevation of it, and showed them to \u00c1sif-ud-daula who expressed a desire to buy it, and offered to give a million sterling for it. His death, however, broke off the bargain, and General Martin himself died before it was finished, and directed that it should be completed out of the funds he left to endow a school there. He ordered his body to be buried in it as a precaution to prevent any future ruler from confiscating it. During the rebellion the mutineers dug up his tomb and scattered his bones, some of which however have since been restored to their original resting place. This building now contains a school at which 120 boys are clothed and educated.\n\nSa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, half brother to \u00c1sif-ud-daula (1798), took to building palaces and embellishing the city. He bought the Farhat Bakhsh, which is opposite the river next to the Chhatar Manzil, from General Martin for Rs. 50,000, and built the Terhi Kothi under the Residency, and the L\u00e1l B\u00e1rahdari, and the Dil\u00e1r\u00e1m opposite to the Chhatar Manzil, and the Dilkusha palace, which stands on some high land outside the city to the north of the present cantonments, and from which a fine view of the city, the river, and the surrounding plain may be had; and the Hay\u00e1t Bakhsh (Banks\u2019 bungalow), occupied before the mutiny by Major Banks, and now the residence of the Chief Commissioner, the N\u00far Bakhsh, the\nKhurshaid Manzil, the Chaupar Stables, and Sikandar B\u0101gh, within the walls of which such signal retribution befell the 2,000 of the rebel troops at the hands of Sir Colin Campbell's force in November of 1857, and on west side of the city, the Sa\u00e1datganj, which he ordered should be the only market-place of the city.\n\nThe Farhat Bakhsh (or giver of delight) was the royal palace from the time of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan till W\u00e1jid Ali built the Qaisar B\u0101gh. That part of it which overlooks the river was built by General Martin, and sold by him to the Nawab Wazir. The rest of the building, and the great throne-room itself, was built by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan. This throne-room, known by the names of the Qasr-us-Sult\u00e1n, or the L\u00e1l B\u00e1rah-dari, was set apart for royal darb\u0101rs; and at the accession of a new king it was the custom for the resident to seat him on the throne, and then to present a nasar to him, in token that the British authority confirmed his assumption of the government. It was in this room that the attempt on the throne by the Badshah Begam and Munna J\u00e1n took place, which is recorded by Sir W. Sleeman in the second volume of his journey through Oudh, and it was in pursuance of this custom that the insurgents attempted to force the Resident, Colonel Low, to present an offering to Munna J\u00e1n as he sat on the throne, thinking thus to confirm the usurper's authority.\n\nThe other Ganjs built in his time were Rak\u00e1bganj, Jangliganj, and Maqbulganj in Ganeshtganj to the west of the city; Gol\u00e1ganj and Molviganj in the Waz\u00edrganj th\u00e1na, and the Rastogi Muhalla in the chauk.\n\nGh\u00e1zi-ud-din Haidar, son of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan (A.D. 1814), the first king, built the Moti Mahal palace, the Ch\u00edni Bazar, the Shah Najaf on the banks of the river, in which he ordered his remains to be laid, the Chhatar Manzil Kal\u00e1n, which faces the river and the Chhatar Manzil Khurd (the lesser), which lies behind it. Round the latter also he built the Darshanbil\u00e1s and Chaulakkhi houses, the present Civil Court and Chief Engineer's Office.\n\nBetween the great quadrangle of the Qaisar B\u0101gh and the Ch\u00edni Bazar stand the two tombs of Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan (called after his death Jannat Ar\u00e1mgah) and of his wife Murshidz\u00e1di. Both these tombs were built after their death by their son Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, who thereby displayed a very uncommon amount of filial affection. The spot on which Sa\u00e1dat Ali's tomb now stands was formerly occupied by a house in which Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar lived during his father's reign; and it is reported that when he came to the throne and occupied Sa\u00e1dat Ali's palace, fully appreciating the change in their respective situations, he remarked that as he had now taken his father's house, it was but fair that he should give up his own to his father. Accordingly he gave orders to destroy his former abode, and raise on the site a tomb to Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan.\n\nThe pile of buildings known by the name of Moti Mahal includes three separately named and distinct buildings. The Moti Mahal, properly so called, was built by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, and forms the northern part of the enclosure. It owes its name to the fancied resemblance of a dome in it\n(now destroyed) to the curve of a pearl. Along the river face Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar built the Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Manzil and the Shah Manzil, the latter being close to the former bridge of boats, the former east of it. The Shah Manzil was the scene of the celebrated wild beast fights. The smaller animals were put to fight inside the enclosure of the Shah Manzil, and the combats between tigers, &c., also took place there; strong cages and a safe arena having been provided. But the fights between elephants and rhinoceroses, which required to be viewed at a safe distance, took place across the Gunti on the level ground in front of the Haz\u00e1ri B\u00e1gh, the king and the court watching them from the verandah of the Shah Manzil. This king also laid out the Val\u00e1ti B\u00e1gh in honour of a foreign wife.\n\nThe Qadam Ras\u00fal, or prophet's foot print, is a Muhammadan place of worship, built by Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar on a mound artificially raised. It contained a stone bearing the impress of the foot of the prophet brought from Arabia by a pilgrim. During the rebellion the holy stone was carried off, but the author of the sacrilege is not known.\n\nB\u00e1dsh\u00e1hganj, on the north-side of the river, opposite the Maohchhi Bha-wan, was founded by him on his attaining to the dignity of sovereign, conferred on him by the British Government, and he dug the canal which skirts the east and south of the city. The canal then leaves the city for the district: it was originally intended for irrigation but has failed.\n\nThe following muhallas were also built in his reign:\u2014Mehndiganj in the Sa\u00e1datganj th\u00e1na, the Deorhi \u00c1gha M\u00edr in Waz\u00edrganj (founded by his favourite minister \u00c1gha M\u00edr). \u00c1gha M\u00edr or Motamad-ud-da\u00fala built the handsome sar\u00e1\u00e9 known as \u00c1gha M\u00edr's, to the south of the Cha\u00fak th\u00e1na on the east side of the Victoria road, and the Karbala near the Wingfield Park.\n\nNas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, son of the last monarch (A.D. 1827), built the great karbala in Ir\u00e1datnagar, in which he lies buried, and founded Ganesh-ganj and Ch\u00e1ndganj on the north side of the river.\n\nThe T\u00e1r\u00e1w\u00e1li Kothi, or Observatory, was built by Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar under the superintendence of Colonel Wilcox, the Astronomer Royal, and was provided with very excellent instruments. The Colonel died in 1847, and W\u00e1jid Ali Sh\u00e1h dismissed the establishment. The astronomical instruments were carefully put by, but disappeared in the rebellion, and were probably broken up by the rebels. The Fyzabad Moulvi, Ahmad-ulla Sh\u00e1h (known as Danka Sh\u00e1h, from his always having a drum beaten before him when he went out) made it his headquarters during the rebellion, and the rebel parliament used frequently to hold its meetings here.\n\nThe space in front of the T\u00e1raw\u00e1li Kothi, between it and the Qaisar B\u00e1gh, is fraught with melancholy and solemn recollections. In this spot two separate parties of Europeans, one consisting of those sent in by the Dhaurahra R\u00e1ja (Miss Jackson, Mrs. Green, Mrs. Rogers, Mr. Caew, Mr. J. Sulivan, on the 24th September, 1857), with the addition of some persons captured in the town, deserters from the Bailey-guard, and the\nother of the victims of the Mitauli R\u00e1ja's gratitude and hospitality (Sir M. Jackson, Captain Orr, Lieutenant Burns, Sergeant Morton, on the 16th November, 1858,) completed the tale of sickness, imprisonment, indignity, and despair, by suffering a cruel martyrdom. A memorial has been put up to commemorate these massacres, almost on the spot where they occurred. Both of them were chiefly owing to the fury of the defeated sepoys when they could no longer resist the advance of General Havelock and of the Commander-in-Chief, but both were also instigated and encouraged by the leaders of the rebellion, and the nobles of Oudh. One of these leaders, R\u00e1ja Jai L\u00e1l Singh, a man of large territorial possessions, and of great influence with the mutineers, followed the first party of prisoners to the fatal scene, and mounted one of the gates of the Qaisar B\u00e1gh, since destroyed, in order better to feast his eyes on their dying agonies, and to applaud the prowess of his sepoys. Two years had elapsed since that time; he had been received into favour; his rebellion had been condoned under the amnesty, and haply he persuaded himself that the memory of that deed had faded away, that even he might hope to die the common death of all men, and be visited by the visitation of all men. But justice, though slowly, was following surely in the criminal's track. Like the storied cranes of Ibycus, it came on him when he least expected it, from the quarter where he thought himself safest. His own confidential servants turned against him, link after link, a wonderful chain of circumstantial evidence developed itself, and heaped the guilt with deadly certainty on his head. On the 1st day of October, 1859, on the very spot where his crime was committed, he paid the extremest penalty of the law. And this was followed, on the 12th of October, by the execution of Bandeh Husen and Fateh Ali, who had hunted down and brought into Lucknow some of the poor captives massacred here.\n\nThe Roshan-ud-daula Kothi, the present district Kachehri, was built by Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar's minister, whose name it bears.\n\nMuhammad Ali Shah, uncle of Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar (A.D. 1837), built the splendid Husenabad Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra as a burial place for himself; it consists of two large enclosures, one of which is at right angles to the other. Leaving the fort by the great R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za, a broad road near the Gumti, about a quarter of a mile long, conducts to the gate of the outer quadrangle. The visitor standing a little west of the road can take in at one view the great Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra and R\u00fami Darw\u00e1za to the right, with the Husenabad and the J\u00e1ma Masjid to the left. The whole forms, as Bishop Heber remarks, one of the finest architectural views in the world. This king also laid out the road that leads to it from the Chhatar Manzil through the fort along the banks of the river.\n\nAlong with the Husenabad Imambara Muhammad Ali Shah built a magnificent tank, which stands by the side of the road, and began a mosque at a short distance from the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra which was intended to surpass the J\u00e1ma Masjid (at Delhi) in size, but which he never lived to complete. It stands still unfinished, with the scaffolding gradually rotting away, untouched since the day he died. He also began a watch tower, a \"Sat\nKhanda,\u201d or seven-storied tower, from the top of which he might look down on his finished work, \u201cthe great Babylon that he had built,\u201d and enjoy its beauty and splendour, but the work was never finished, and the tower only reached its fourth story.\n\nThe great tomb of Hak\u00edm Mehndi Ali Khan, situated to the east of Gol\u00e1ganj, and near M\u00edna Shah-ki-Darg\u00e1h, was erected by his nephew, Munawar-ud-daula, during this reign.\n\nAmjad Ali Shah, son of the last king (A.D. 1841), built Hazratganj, made the metalled Road to Cawnpore, laid the iron bridge over the Gumti, and built his own Mausoleum in Hazratganj. Amin-ud-daula, his minister, founded the Aminabad Bazar, one of the great thoroughfares of the city which leads into the Cawnpore road.\n\nThe iron bridge was brought out from England by the order of Gh\u00e1z\u00ed-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, but he died before it arrived. His son, Nas\u00edr-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, directed it to be put up in front of the Residency, just where a small temple and gh\u00e1t now stand on the opposite side of the river. He gave the contract for erecting it to his own engineer, a Mr. Sinclair, who commenced sinking wells (which are still visible) on which to found the piers, but failed before any great progress had been made. The bridge was thus again delayed till Amjad Ali Shah, the 4th king, took up the project and completed it.\n\nThe Qaisar B\u00e1gh, the great work of W\u00e1jid Ali Shah, the ex-king\u2019s reign, was commenced in 1848, and finished in 1850 A.D., at a cost, including furniture and decorations, of eighty lakhs. Qaisar is the same word as C\u00e6sar, a title adopted by the kings of Oudh, and used by them on the royal seal.\n\nTo describe this palace, it will be best to suppose the visitor to enter at the north-east gateway, which faces the open space in front of the T\u00e1ra-w\u00e1l\u00ed Kothi. We pass up the open court in front of the gate called the Jilaukh\u00e1na, or place where the royal processions used to form up and prepare to start from, and turning to the right through a gateway covered by a screen, we cross the Chini B\u00e1gh (so called from the large China vessels with which it was decorated), and going under a gate flanked by green mermaids we come to the Hazrat B\u00e1gh.\n\nOn the right hand we have the Ch\u00e1ndiw\u00e1li B\u00e1r\u00e1dari which used to be paved with silver, and the Kh\u00e1s Muq\u00e1m and B\u00e1dshah Manz\u00edl, which used to be the special residence of the king. The B\u00e1dsh\u00e1h Manz\u00edl has been before alluded to as having been built by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, and included by W\u00e1jid Ali Shah in the plan of his new palace. His Waz\u00edr, Naw\u00e1b Ali Naqi Khan, used to reside above the mermaid\u2019s gateway we have just passed under, in order that he might be close to the king, and obtain instant information of all he was doing. On the left we have the large confused pile of buildings called the Chaulakkhi, built by Az\u00edm-ulla Khan, the royal barber, and sold by him to the king for four lakhs. It formed the residence of the chief mahals and of the queen. The\nrebel begam held her court here, and it was in one of the stables near this that our captives were kept for weeks. Proceeding along the roadway, we pass close by a tree paved round the roots with marble, under which W\u00e1jid Ali Shah used to sit in the days, when the great fair was held, dressed in the yellowish clothes of a faq\u00edr. Moving onwards we pass under the great Lakkhi gate (so called from having cost a lakh in building), and come into the magnificent open square of the Qaisar B\u00e1gh proper, the buildings round which were occupied chiefly by ladies of the Harem. In the month of August a great fair used to be held here, to which the whole town was admitted. Proceeding past the stone B\u00e1rahdari, now fitted up as a theatre, and under the western Lakkhi gate, which corresponds to the eastern one just described, we have on our left the building known as the Qaisar Pasand, surmounted by a gilt semicircle and hemisphere. It was built by Roshan-ud-daula, the minister of Nasir-ud-din Haidar, and confiscated by W\u00e1jid Ali Shah, and given by him as a residence to a favourite mahal (concubine) M\u00edsh\u00faq-us-Sult\u00e1n. In the under-stories of this building the Dhaurahra party of captives were confined, and from it they were taken to be killed. On the right is another Jilaukh\u00e1na corresponding to the eastern one, by which we entered the palace, and turning down it we find ourselves outside the Qaisar B\u00e1gh, and opposite the Sher Darw\u00e1za, or Neil gateway, under which General Neil was killed by a discharge of grape shot from a gun posted at the gate of the Qaisar B\u00e1gh which we have just left.\n\nSo much was done for the city during native times Dispensaries, schools, and other public buildings have been established since; nor should mention be omitted of the magnificent hospital which is due to the munificence of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Drigbijai Singh, of Balr\u00e1mpur. It is situated in the high lands adjoining the Residency grounds, and faces the Bailey-guard road; it can make up one hundred beds.\n\nThe people, their religion, and condition.\u2014The city population consists for the most part of Musalmans, K\u00e1yaths, Brahmans, Chhattris, Bani\u00e1ns, Rastog\u00eds, Jauharis, Khattries, and Kashmiri Brahmins. It is worth noticing that the number of K\u00e1yaths, Moslems, and Bani\u00e1ns is unusually large, the others come next.\n\nBrahmans.\u2014The Brahmins are chiefly of the Kanaujia and Gaur tribes; they are rarely in service, and consequently are of little importance; they depend mainly upon the charity of other Hindus. Few of them are well off.\n\nChhattris.\u2014The number of this class is very limited, and it also is very insignificant.\n\nK\u00e1yaths.\u2014Different opinions have hitherto been held as to the position of this caste. Some English author places them at the head of the Sudras, others between Chhattris and Vaishyas. The Hindu Sh\u00e1stris were until lately not unanimous, some pronounced them as Sudras, others placed them in the Chhattri order, while a follower of the Padum Pur\u00e1ns described them as the descendants of Chitr Gupt, and the offspring of the\ngrand-daughters of Barmha and S\u00faraj; the name (K\u00e1yath) is derived from K\u00e1ya (body) as sprung from the whole body of Bramha, and invested with the profession of scribe. This last view has been lately upheld by certain Benares, Kashmir, Bengal, and Bombay Pandits; on a question having been referred to them by the Maharaja of Benares at the instance of a respectable man of the caste. They have now, therefore, been classed by these Pandits as Chhattris bearing the name of K\u00e1yaths, and with the pen substituted for the sword, from a similarity of habits and customs, and on some religious authority.\n\nThere are generally two subdivisions of this caste in the city\u2014viz., the Sri-B\u00e1stab, and the Sak-Sena,\u2014there are also a few families of the M\u00e1thur, Asht\u00e1na, Gaur, and Bhatn\u00e1gar subdivisions. This caste furnishes a great many of its members to the local offices; none will engage in trade. It boasts of its dependence upon the profession of writing. Mr. Carnegy gives the names of sixteen members of this caste who were honoured with the title of r\u00e1ja by the Oudh Government, but there were others bearing different titles\u2014such as Kunwar, Munshi-ul-mul\u00fak, R\u00e9j-ad-dhir\u00e1j, R\u00e9\u00e9, Bakhshi-ul-mulk, with position almost equal to that of a \"r\u00e1ja.\" Many were also created \"daulas\" as Mash\u00edr-ud-daula and Mudabbir-ud-daula; several were n\u00e1zims, collectors, or captains. And under the present government about one-fourth of the extra assistant commissioners, munsarims, and tahsildars are of this caste. There are some legal practitioners also belonging to this caste; K\u00e1yaths also serve largely and almost exclusively as q\u00e1n\u00fangos as d\u00edw\u00e1ns of the native nobles, while an inferior class of them carries on the business of village accountants or patw\u00e1ris.\n\nVaishyas.\u2014This the third great caste of Hindus; includes Bani\u00e1ns, Khattris (of disputed position) and Rastogis. Under Bani\u00e1ns again are comprised a great many sub-castes\u2014as Agarw\u00e1la, P\u00e1liw\u00e1la, Kasan-dhan, &c. All these castes ply various trades, and are but rarely met with in service. They lend money at interest, are cloth sellers, money changers, and follow various other respectable trades, but only Bani\u00e1ns deal in grain, which the other subdivisions consider beneath them. Very few of the Bani\u00e1ns are in Government service. During the Naw\u00e1bi there were two or three high officials of this caste. The Khattris assert that they are the same as Chhattris,* and account for their having taken up to trade, a contemptible profession in a Chhattri's eye, by relating that during the time of Paras R\u00e1m, and the general annihilation of the Chhattri race, some women had taken shelter with a Brahman, who when asked by Paras R\u00e1m to hand them over, declined saying they were Brahmanis, and to prove it partook of food cooked by them. Another account says that they were employed as soldiers in the Deccan campaign of Aurangzeb, but an enormous number of them having been killed, the emperor was moved at the condition of their beautiful widows, and ordered them never again to enter into military service. Lucknow Khattris are all traders; very few of them were and are in Government service.\n\nKashmiri Brahmans.\u2014It cannot be said that this tribe is indigenous to Oudh or to Lucknow, for there were very few families of them inhabiting Lucknow during the Nawabi. They were comparatively rarely in public\n\nOudh Census Report, pages 92-93.\nservice, the name of only one of them, R\u0101e Dila R\u0101m, is familiar as Chakladar of Tandiaon. This tribe has migrated from Kashmir, and spread throughout Northern India owing to the prosecution of the Moslem conquerors of their native country. They are generally reckoned among the lower caste Brahmins. Many of them are among the subordinate judicial officers, and other public servants. Though far more numerous at Lucknow now than the former days, they still don't number more than other high castes. Kashmiris like K\u0101yaths consider shop-keeping beneath them.\n\nLower caste Hindus.\u2014They are the same which are common throughout the province\u2014N\u0101os, B\u0101ris, Dhobis, Kah\u0101rs, Kumh\u0101rs, Loh\u0101rs, Ah\u012brs, Bansphors, Bhangis, and Cham\u0101rs\u2014all inhabit the city, their several callings will be given afterwards; Sun\u0101rs or goldsmiths are also included in the lower castes in the Oudh census report; but they dispute it.\n\nThe number of houses given in the census is at 58,712.\n\nThe following table is borrowed from the census; it exhibits the population of the city generally:\u2014\nCensus Table No. I.\u2014Population of the city.\n\n| Name of Taluk | Male | Female | Total |\n|---------------|------|-------|-------|\n| Chalal        |      |       |       |\n| Kolangayoor    |      |       |       |\n| Talukpadu      |      |       |       |\n| Balagangoor    |      |       |       |\n| Ganganayoor    |      |       |       |\n| Warikkunnu     |      |       |       |\n\n| Hindu | Muslim | Total |\n|-------|--------|-------|\n|       |        |       |\n\n| Age Group | Male | Female | Total |\n|-----------|------|--------|-------|\n| Children  | 5761 | 5299   | 11060 |\n| Adults    |      |        |       |\n|          |      |        |       |\n\n| Classification   | Male | Female | Total |\n|------------------|------|--------|-------|\n| Military (active)|      |        |       |\n| Europeans        |      |        |       |\n| Turks            |      |        |       |\n\nGrand Total: | | | |\nThe following is a list of all Hindu castes found in Lucknow, with their trades:\n\nBrahmans ... Priests, family astrologers.\nChhatris ... Engaged as public or private servants.\nK\u00e1yaths ... In Government or private service of Nawabs and as legal practitioners.\nBani\u00e1ns ... Grain-dealers and bankers.\nKhattris ... Ditto ditto.\nKashmiri Brahmins ... In Government service or legal practitioners.\nBh\u00e1\u00fas ... Family bards.\nAhirs ... Herdsmen.\nMur\u00f3os ...

Leaf-plate makers.\n\nReligion.\u2014The religion of the Hindus of Lucknow does not materially differ from that prevalent in the rest of the province; the high-caste Brahmans, Khattris, Bani\u00e1ns, and Rastogis are worshippers of Shiva or of Vishnu, and very rarely of Debi; the total abstinence of the worshippers of these tribes keeps them aloof from professing the worship of a goddess whose chief food is flesh and whose drink is wine. The K\u00e1yaths, on the other hand, are mostly worshippers of Debi. The Kashmiri Brahmans are generally devotees of Shiva, and not of Vishnu or Debi. The low-caste Hindus mostly worship Debi; but P\u00e1s\u00eds and Cham\u00e1rs are said by those who object to their practices to profess no religion. There are a good many professors of the Nanakshahi creed.\n\nMusalmans.\u2014The Moslems who live in Lucknow are divided into the following classes:\n\nSeyyad ... All professions, arts, &c., except trading.\nPath\u00e1n ... Few in number employed as sip\u00e1his or private servants.\nMughal ... Independent gentlemen, Nawabs, &c., but very rarely Government servants.\nShekh ... This is the division in which all the lower classes are included.\nAtashb\u00e1z ... Fire-work maker.\nBhatt\u00e1ra ... Inn-keeper.\nBh\u00e1nd ... Musician, singer.\nBh\u00edahti ... Water-carrier.\nBis\u00e1ti ... Pedlar.\nDaf\u00e1li ... Tamborine player.\nDhunia ... Cotton cleaner.\nDarzi ... Tailor.\nDh\u00e1ri, Dom ... Musician.\nJul\u00e1ha ... Weaver.\nKunjra ... Greengrocer.\nBakar Qas\u00e1b ... Mutton seller.\nQas\u00ed ... Butcher.\nFaturias ... Dancing girls and prostitutes.\nMuhammadans belong to two different sects, the Sunnis and the Shias. Their chief difference is that the former believe in all the Caliphs as successors to the prophet, but the latter only believe in Ali and his successors. The Lucknow Moslems are chiefly Shias, the court religion. All the Nawabs, the Begams, and the Muhammadan nobles of Oudh belong to the Shia creed. Very few of the courtiers were of the Sunni sect, and those few were subject to a good deal of persecution.\n\nThoroughfares, markets, &c.\u2014The chief thoroughfares of the city are, three, that run south and south-west from the river, converging on the old canal, and crossing a bridge there become united with the imperial road to Cawnpore. They are the Outram roads, which lead up to Hazratganj, and crossing it is continued by the Abbot road; a vast quantity of traffic from the north, from Fyzabad, and Bahramghat passes along this road; the Aminabad road, which passes through the most crowded parts of the city to the south of the Qaisar B\u00e2gh palace, and the Canning road which runs southwest from the open ground round the Machchhi Bhawan fort. Three roads from the iron bridge, whence the traffic from Sitapur is conveyed, from the old stone bridge, and from the pargana town of Malihabad, lead up to the fort, and, at their point of conjunction, the Victoria road runs directly south, and crossing the canal joins the aforementioned Cawnpore road lower down.\n\nThe city communicates with Cantonments by the Strand, which runs along the river side from the Machchhi Bhawan fort, and continued by the Hazratganj road passes by the Civil Lines Church, and crosses the old canal a little to the east of Government house by Bank's road, which passing at the back of the Qaisar B\u00e2gh and Government house, leads into the road just mentioned, and by the Cantonment road which starts from the Aminabad road, commencing at the same point at the back of Qaisar B\u00e2gh as Bank's road last mentioned, and crossing the Abbot road leads into the Sadr Baz\u00e2r of Cantonments. Cantonments lie to the east of the Canal and extend over an area of from eleven to twelve square miles.\n\nThe principal markets are the grain markets of Fatehganj and Digbijai-ganj lying to the west of Aminabad, of Rak\u00e2bganj lying at the south end of the Canning road, of Sa\u00e2datganj in the west of the city, and of Shahganj near the Victoria road. Most of the imported cotton and salt is set down at Sa\u00e2datganj. Gur (molasses) is sold chiefly in the Nakh-khas market, which is to the west of the Victoria road. And the great leather market is the Chikmandi in the Wazirganj th\u00e2na.\n\nThe value of goods imported into the city during 1869-70 was Rs. seventy-four and three quarter lakhs. The chief articles on which a municipal tax is levied are wheat and the other grains, ghi, gur, sugar spices, oil-seeds, and tobacco.\n\nThe following are the food grains and the approximate dates when they ripen, so far that considerable parcels are sent into the market.\n| Native name       | Botanical name                  | Date of harvest |\n|------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------|\n| Jethi dh\u00e1n       | Oriza sativa                    | June 20th.      |\n| Mak\u00e1i or bari ju\u00e1r | Zea mays                        | August 20th (Bh\u00e1don). |\n| S\u00e1nw\u00e1n           | Panicum italicum                | August 20th (do). |\n| Mindwa           | Cynosaurus coracanus            | Septr. 10th (Ku\u00e1r). |\n| K\u00e1kun            |                                 | Do.

The important grains are the following with the breadths sown in Lucknow according to the settlement report. The average prices of 1861-1870 are given from the same authority:\n\n| Acres | Sers per rupee |\n|-------|----------------|\n| Bari ju\u00e1r (maize) | 4,200 | 29 |\n| Kodo   | 41,063 | 34 |\n| S\u00e1nw\u00e1n | 7,710 | 33 |\n| Rice   | 55,510 | 27 |\n| B\u00e1jra  | 36,730 | 22 |\n| Chhoti ju\u00e1r | 36,270 | 24 |\n| M\u00e1sh or urd | 33,070 | 22 |\n| Moth   | 20,805 | 24 |\n| Gram   | 45,840 | 20 |\n| Peas   | 21,056 | 25 |\n| Arhar  | 44,919 | 27 |\n\nIt must be remembered, however, that the masses do not and could not pay the above prices; each grain is cheap for a month or so after the harvest when the producer is forcing the sale in order to procure the means wherewith to pay rent.\n\nOne period of scarcity is January-February, when there has been no fresh khar\u00edf harvest for the space of a month\u2014viz., since the jarhan rice was reaped; another is July-August, when the rabi crop has been cut more than two months, and before the Indian-corn comes in. The lower classes, except during these two periods, consume grain all the year round at prices which average perhaps 10 per cent. cheaper than those given in the preceding table. On the other hand, the cheapest grains kodo, mindwa, and s\u00e1nw\u00e1n are really not available in Lucknow as food supplies. Official statements quote them at 35 and 40 sers for the rupee from September to November 7th, 1874, but I could not find them except in\nsmall parcels, and at the latter date there was none whatever in the market, although a little mindwa was to be had in the shops at 26 sers the rupee.\n\nIn 1874 the kharif was very good; there was little export and prices were moderate; but immediately after the poor man's harvest (the henwat), there was no grain in the market available as a food supply cheaper than 25 sers for the rupee (retail rate). At this time could be got Indian-corn and bajra. The wholesale rates are as follows:\n\n| Grain                  | Sers per Rupee |\n|------------------------|---------------|\n| Indian-corn or maize   | 28            |\n| Bajra                  | 27            |\n| Kodo flour             | 23            |\n| Coarse husked rice     | 22            |\n| Do. unhusked           | 35            |\n| Ma\u00far, moth and urd     | 23            |\n| Mindwa                 | 26            |\n| Barley                 | 26            |\n| Second quality gram    | 22            |\n| Wheat                  | 19\u00bd           |\n\nThese prices usually advance 30 per cent. within the next two months.\n\nAnother point must be borne in mind, that some grains though nominally cheap are only so in the unhusked state; when fit for eating they are dear. The husk or bh\u016bsa in native parlance is sometimes deorha, sometimes \u00e1dha; in other words sometimes one-third sometimes one-half is lost. S\u00e1nw\u00e1n loses nearly one-half; so s\u00e1nw\u00e1n which sells at 35 sers unhusked is really only 22 sers when it comes to be cooked. Kodo and rice lose one-third each; so kodo at 36 sers becomes 24 sers, rice at 34 becomes 22. Other grains lose less; barley about one-fifth, 26 sers becoming 20.\n\nIt is true kodo can be used as pottage without being husked, but it is dangerous, often causing paralysis. Yet another feature of the food-grains must be considered before valuing them\u2014that is, their comparative effect in satisfying not the palate but the appetite. The native's aim is not to gratify his taste, nor even to nourish his strength, but simply to feel fairly full and free from the pangs of hunger. The following is the scale sanctioned by public opinion with this object:\n\n| Grain                  | Chhat\u00e1ks |\n|------------------------|----------|\n| Mindwa                 | 12       |\n| Rice                   | 12       |\n| Moth or peas           | 12       |\n| Bajra                  | 14       |\n| Kodo                   | 16       |\n| Barley                 | 16       |\n| Wheat                  | 16       |\n\nMindwa is in particular favour, for its consumption promotes thirst; water can be had gratis, and repletion is thus cheaply attained. The above are the rates for an ordinary slim cooly not doing hard work; if steadily employed, or above the ordinary height, one quarter more will be required. Just at present then a poor man will live on moth at 22 sersthe rupee, rice at 20 sers, and ju\u00e1r at 25 retail prices, so that the staple of his diet\nwill not cost more than one rupee to 1-4 per mensem. Salt, fuel, and a little ghi or oil will cost ten annas more.\n\nIn consulting official rates for grains it must be remembered that very low prices are ruling nominally for harvest grains because they are wet with dew; it is not grain but water in fact which is being sold. This accounts for prices falling to 50 and 60 sers for the rupee, when in neighbouring markets the ascertained price is not above 30.\n\nThe supply of fish in Lucknow is by no means plentiful. There are two fish markets\u2014one at Hasanganj, the other in Aminabad; from this latter the entire European quarter and much of the native portion are supplied. It will not on an average contain more than a maund and a half of fish in the morning when the sales are held. Large fish are sold at 2 annas a ser except roh\u00fa, which sometimes fetches 3 annas.

It is managed by a committee under the presidentship of the Commissioner of the Division, and is divided into five departments.\n\nThe number of pupils and the receipts and costs in each department are as follows:\n\n| Departments | Pupils | Receipts | Cost of educating each pupil |\n|-------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------|\n|             |        | From     | Total cost. | Cost to Government. |\n|             |        | Government. | From other sources. | |\n| College     | 56     | Rs. 13,146 | Rs. 19,967 | Rs. 573 | Rs. 286 |\n|             |        | \u00a31,314    | \u00a31,997     | \u00a357    | \u00a328   |\n| School      | 317    | Rs. 8,586 | Rs. 10,956 | Rs. 58  | Rs. 29 |\n|             |        | \u00a3856      | \u00a31,095     | nearly 6 | nearly 3 |\n| Oriental    | 123    | Rs. 2,978 | Rs. 3,960  | Rs. 39  | Rs. 18 |\n|             |        | \u00a3297      | \u00a3396       | nearly 4 | nearly 3 |\n| Preparatory | 226    | Rs. 2,259 | Rs. 5,042  | Rs. 24  | Rs. 10 |\n|             |        | \u00a3226      | \u00a3504       | \u00a32      | \u00a31    |\n| Law         | 46     | Rs. 1,078 | Rs. 3,246  | Rs. 125 | Rs. 37 |\n|             |        | \u00a3108      | \u00a3325       | \u00a312    | nearly 4 |\n\nTotal | ... | Rs. 27,992 | Rs. 43,171 | Rs. 80 | Rs. 38 |\n|      |     | \u00a32,799     | \u00a34,317     | \u00a38    | nearly 4 |\n\nThe professions of the parents and guardians of the pupils are in the following proportions:\u2014\n\n- Private servants: 256 or 36 per cent.\n- Government servants: 186, 26\n- Professionals, Pandits, Hakims, writers, &c.: 86, 10\n- Traders, Bankers, &c.: 61, 8\n- Taluqdars: 54, 8\n- Other landholders: 24, 3\n- Cultivators: 14, 2\n- Artizans and manufacturers: 6, 1\n- Others: 63, 9\n\nOf the 123 pupils of the oriental department 70 are Muhammadans. Of these students, 51 learn Arabic and 31 Sanskrit. Since the opening of the\ninstitution in 1864, 2,110 students have left it, either having completed their course or having acquired, with few exceptions, sufficient knowledge to fit them for employment. Three scholars have taken M.A. degrees, and twelve have taken their B.A. degrees; forty seven have passed the first examination in arts, and 126 the matriculation examination of the Calcutta university. Of these students one obtained honours and carried off the silver medal. Some few of the most influential taluqdars have been educated here.\n\nCost of a graduate.\u2014The cost to the province of each student for his education is:\n\n| College department, | Graduate | Rs. 1,140 |\n|---------------------|----------|-----------|\n|                     | Under ditto | Rs. 570 |\n\nSchool department matriculated student assuming his stay to be three years\n\n| School department | Matriculated student assuming his stay to be three years | Rs. 80 |\n\nThe cost in a Government high school is about Rs. 160 (\u00a316).\n\nIncome of the college.\u2014The sources of income of the institution are as follows:\n\n| Source                  | Amount   |\n|-------------------------|----------|\n| Grant-in-aid from provincial revenue | Rs. 25,000 |\n| Contribution from taluqdars       | Rs. 32,570 |\n| Fees                        | Rs. 4,060 |\n\nThe following statement exhibits the number of Canning College students who have obtained degrees and have passed University Examinations:\n\n| Degree | With honours | M.

There were at the close of March, 1871, 18 Hindus and 8 Muhammadans, in all 26 boarders, of whom 14 were wards. The total cost was Rs. 10,550 and the average for each boarder was Rs. 402. This institution is under the direction of the Commissioner of the Division and is managed by a Governor.\n\nAided schools under the Anglican Church Mission.\u2014The Church Mission maintains five schools in the city with an aggregate of 641 boys and an average attendance of 498. The fees amount to Rs. 265, and the Government grant to Rs. 3,470. The total cost Rs. 6,940. The largest of these institutions, the main school, has 300 boys, and the smallest, in Hazratganj, 41.\n\nThe American Episcopalian Methodist Mission Anglo-Vernacular Schools.\u2014There are seven of these; the attendance averages 483; Rs. 392 are collected as fees, and the Government grant is 3,605. The total cost amounts to Rs. 7,479.\n\nGirls' schools.\u2014The eight American Mission girls' schools and seven Church Mission schools have an aggregate average attendance of 223 and 173 girls respectively, and the ten girls' schools supported from provincial funds have an attendance of 182 girls out of a total of 245 borne on the rolls.\n\nManufactures, trades, arts.\u2014The different castes or trades-unions who follow each occupation in Lucknow have been already detailed. It remains to give some account of the nature of their industries, progress, and skill.\n\nThe principal arts and manufactures of Lucknow are cotton cloth, gold and silver wire, gold and silver lace, enamelling, stone setting, and jeweller's work of all kinds, glass vessels, dyes, clay figures, shawl weaving, cotton printing, lithography.\n\nCotton.\u2014The muslins of Lucknow are sold at from six to fourteen annas per yard. Others of finer texture are manufactured, costing Rs. 50 to Rs. 100 per piece of eight yards. The very best English muslins are sold at eight annas per yard; the native fabric of course cannot compete in the general market with the imported one.\n\nNative muslins are not suitable for ladies' dresses as they do not stand washing properly, but for some purposes, as handkerchiefs, their greater softness qualifies them. A native weaver will make 1\u00bd yard of muslin in a day, and earn 2\u00bd annas or 3\u00bdd.; in coarser work, such as g\u00e4rha, he will get through three yards per day, earning 1\u00bd anna.\n\nCotton printing.\u2014Cotton printing is a successful business at Lucknow. There are now some 80 small establishments, and their annual outturn is valued at Rs. 25,000; their chintz and printed nankin, if the colours are fast, cannot be sold under 10 annas per yard, when a similar English fabric can be sold at six annas. The patterns of the Lucknow article are more appreciated, and the snowy whiteness of the material upon which they are worked cannot, it is said, be equalled in England. The Kukr\u00e6l\nriver near Lucknow is famous for the purity of tint which its waters convey.\n\n**Shawl weaving.**\u2014The shawl weaving of Lucknow is an entirely new trade. It is conducted almost entirely by Kashmir weavers who have emigrated from thence during the periods of famine or misrule which have been its frequent portion. There are, it is believed, some 40 small establishments having from two to five looms each; each loom will turn out a shawl which will be sold at from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300 in nine months. The wool is brought from the Spiti valley and from Kashmir; it is a coarse quality of the noted pashmina which the looms of Srinagar have made so famous. There was no manufacture of the kind till annexation. Local economists account for this by stating that there is no capital now in Lucknow, and no money to purchase Kashmir shawls, the import of which has declined. This latter fact is true, but the reason is to be sought in the inferior quality of the article now made in Kashmir, as well as in the departure of the Oudh king and court. In point of fact, the Lucknow capitalists have sought a vent in a new trade for their spare funds; no tax is imposed by the State upon the manufacture; labour is cheap; for fifty years Lucknow has been noted for the attraction it possesses for Kashmiri residents; one muhalla is called after and largely inhabited by them. Further the waters of some streams near Lucknow, the Baita and the Kukra\u00ebl, are noted for their value in bleaching and dyeing. All these advantages are sufficient to localize the new trade in Lucknow. The sale of the shawls is principally confined to Calcutta, but many men are employed in darning ancient and decayed shawls. It is not unusual for a Kashmiri fabric to be constantly used with little injury for three generations. The entire annual sale does not exceed Rs. 12,000.\n\n**Shoe manufacture.**\u2014The shoe manufacture in Lucknow was formerly a very flourishing trade, but Delhi has now supplanted the Oudh capital. The shoe trade depends, not on the leather, but on the brocade which is used to cover the uppers. This is made from copper wire silvered or gilt in Delhi, and a handsome pair of shoes so brocaded can be purchased for two rupees. But work of this kind was not practised in Lucknow formerly; the goldsmiths and brocade workers were compelled, it is said, to enter into bonds for Rs. 2,000 not to sell or manufacture such things; it was the desire of the Native Government to create a reputation for Lucknow work as being, what is professed, of pure silver or gold. The artisans were not accustomed to work in the cheaper and coarser filigree, but after annexation all restrictions were removed, and the market flooded with Delhi brocades. The Lucknow manufacture has been almost driven out of the market, and the sale of Delhi shoes as compared with the Lucknow article is as four to one.\n\n**Gold and silver brocade.**\u2014The most important Lucknow manufacture is that of silver brocade and laces, used, as these articles are, for caps, shoes, belts, shawls, and the innumerable other requirements of Indian pomp. The basis of all these is wire drawn to an extreme tenuity, plain or gilt, and either worked up as wire, or flattened out into minute bands or into small round spangles. All three forms are employed in the embroidery for which Lucknow is so justly famous even among Indian cities.\nThe division of labour in the work rivals that in home manufactures; the wire passes through the hands of five different craftsmen till the massive ingot becomes sparkling thread from which the gossamer-like blossoms of the pattern are composed. These different artists combine their labour to produce the spangle, and numerous others attend on each further stage.\n\nThe principal products are lachk\u00e1, kal\u00e1bat\u00fa, and lais or lace.\n\nLachk\u00e1.\u2014Lachk\u00e1 is a warp of silver gilt bands worked with a woof of silk thread; it varies in breadth from half an inch to an inch; of this material one m\u00e1sha will be silk, the rest will be silvered wire, if gilt \u201csawa ratti\u201d of gold will be expended in a tola of silver, and as there are eight rattis in a m\u00e1sha, and twelve m\u00e1shas in a tola, one seventy-seventh of the gilt wire will be gold. This material is therefore very rich; it is sold at the rate of Re. 1-6 and Re. 1-9 per tola. The price has fallen with the demand; similar qualities prior to annexation used to sell at Re. 1-12. It is like a broad tape of sheet gold, and to enhance its lustre, patterns are stamped upon it in repouss\u00e9 work of high relief. Having been thus crimped up, it is used as an edging for turbans, for state costumes, and for the dresses worn by dancing girls. It is exported for this purpose to every large city throughout India except to Delhi; which is a rival in the trade, but the Delhi work cannot compare with that of Lucknow either in purity of metal or in delicacy of workmanship. The wages earned are not more than two or three annas per day, and the result of this, as already stated, is that one rupee of solid silver will be gilt, turned into wire and worked up into a material of exquisite lustre and beauty for six annas, or 37 per cent. on the bullion, while the most ordinary silversmith\u2019s work in England, a simple spoon, will cost as much or more.\n\nKal\u00e1bat\u00fa.\u2014Another material is kal\u00e1bat\u00fa; this consists of a narrow silver gilt riband twisted spirally round a silk thread. It is then worked up into a tape differing little in appearance from lachk\u00e1; two yards of this material will weigh a tola; the labour is similarly slightly remunerated. Out of Re. 1-8, the price of two yards, only three annas or one-eighth will go to the weaver. Lucknow cannot rival Barh\u00e1mpur in this particular manufacture.\n\nGold lace.\u2014Lace is a third of the simple forms into which the gilt wire is worked up. This differs from lachk\u00e1 in that the woof is of wire, not of ribands, and it is double, so that the silk thread of the warp does not appear at all, producing a very gorgeous effect. This lace is very durable, and stands exposure to wet much better than the English manufacture; it is about half the price, as English gold lace of a quality costing 15 shillings per ounce can be bought in Lucknow at seven and six pence. Lace of various qualities, plain, with conventional or rich flowered pattern can be had at from Re. 1-8 to Rs. 2 the tola, i.e., about four rupees per yard. English lace costs 13s. 6d. the yard, and is made on an entirely different method; it is made like kal\u00e1bat\u00fa, already described, and of course is not nearly so durable.\n\nEmbroidery.\u2014The embroidery is upon velvet and cotton; it imitates flowers and fruits with correctness of outline and gorgeous brilliancy\nof colour. A beautiful effect is caused by bringing golden fruit out of silver foliage. The petals are formed by working delicate spirals of golden thread; the glossy silk on which the latter is worked cannot be seen by the eye, but gives a gleam of rich colour like yellow hoarfrost to the blossom. The stamens and pistils are represented by innumerable little circular spangles raised in pyramids, worked into chains and circles, all of extreme brilliancy.\n\nThe value of the embroidery is entirely dependent on the quality of the gold thread employed. If the silk thread is richly and well covered with gold the weight is greater, and the work presents a rich appearance; if the silk thread is only lightly and sparsely covered with gold and showing silk between, the work looks poor. The Lucknow embroidery is superior to that of Delhi; the patterns are much more free and flowing, and the material is less cumbered with heavy work; more taste is shown in affording the eye relief from masses of bullion, a closer imitation of nature is sought, and the delicacy of its handiwork in petal and stamen is copied with success. The aim of the Delhi artist apparently is to overlay as much metal as possible upon cloth; very little of the Lucknow work is gaudy, and some of the cloaks or chughas made of purple or slate coloured silk, worked round the edges with gold embroidery, exhibit designs of exquisite grace and purity of conception.\n\nGeneral position of the embroidery art.\u2014Using the word brocade in its most general sense as embracing, embroidery, lace, lachk\u00e1, and the other varieties, the present position of the trade cannot be viewed with complacency. There were originally, it is said, about 5,000 workmen engaged in these manufactures; that number has now fallen to 2,500, and the trade is not sufficient to maintain them. It is very doubtful whether any extensive demand for these fabrics could arise in Europe; fancy dresses of oriental patterns might come into request, ball dresses of muslin sprigged with gold, children's robes, and furniture brocades have been adorned with Lucknow embroidery, but it is doubtful whether there will be any permanent demand except for military laces. There seems no reason why every hussar's jacket, each shoulder-knot and sword-belt in the British army might not be embroidered or worked in Lucknow.\n\nIt is only in India that patience, dexterity of manipulation, grace in designing, trustworthiness in handling gold and precious stones, and the skill which is the result of many years, application, can all be bought for three pence a day. Less advance has been made in wire-drawing by English science than in any other art; the process already described is identical with that used in Europe; the only difference is that the European workman is supplied with motive powers from a perpetual hand worked by a steam engine, and the native workman utilizes his marvellously flexible toes for the same purpose.\n\nThe needlework embroidery of Lucknow is the most thriving manufacture which it boasts. It is of recent introduction, and is a graft from the chicken-work of Bengal, to which, however, it is far superior. Coloured silks have lately been introduced to give variety, and the Lucknow artists\nboast that this very effective device is one of their own, borrowed neither from Bengal nor from England. The work is similar to that used in shirt fronts and cuffs in Europe; it is sold at low rates, from annas 12 to Rs. 2-8-0 per yard, according to the breadth of the lace border. Articles of clothing of cambric or calico so embroidered are becoming very popular among native grandees. It is impossible to state what number of people are employed at this work, but its flourishing condition is attested by the high wages earned, showing that there is a competition for skilled workmen. The existence of this art was, I found, wholly unknown to the Lucknow shopkeepers, who are importing the coarsest kind of Irish embroidery at 1 rupee per yard, when much superior can be made in Lucknow at 4 annas. The jewellery of Lucknow was formerly very celebrated, but has declined with the departure of the court. There are no diamond cutters proper, although there are still artisans who can prepare the table and rose diamond popular in India.\n\nThe leading jewellers declare that the demand for their productions is still large, but that they lost all their capital during the mutinies. The wages paid are very low; they are estimated at so many annas in the rupee for silver work, or so much for working up a tola of gold, which is worth about \u00a31-10. The very finest and most elaborate workmanship only costs one rupee a tola, or about 6 per cent. on the raw material, while commoner and simpler work costs four or eight annas. Gold chains, which, even when machine-made, are sold in London at 50 per cent. in addition to the cost of the bullion, are made in Lucknow for 5 per cent. or less. The artist of the highest pretensions cannot earn by hand labour more than one rupee per day, and four annas is considered fair pay for a good workman.\n\nGlass.\u2014The glass work is confined to Lucknow, and to some extent to Dalmau. Lamp glasses are made at a very low price, six annas for an article which, if of English manufacture, costs two rupees. There are only two craftsmen, who brought their art from Mooltan, nor are they acquainted with the process of making glass from sand and alkali; they can only melt down broken glass and remould it. The proposed school of art in Lucknow might direct its attention to the natural facilities for glass making which the Oudh soil furnishes.\n\nThe manufacture of clay figures and mouldings is one of the specialities of Lucknow. The thick tenacious soil from the bottoms of tanks is moulded into most faithful and characteristic statuettes representing the different races of the country; the peculiarities of feature are hit off with great correctness on a very small scale; they are in fact portrait statues of a quality highly creditable to the taste and skill of the artists, and are sold at the rate of two rupees per dozen. Wall-brackets, vases, clock-cases, and other articles are manufactured of the same material, conventional tracery and foliated patterns are worked out with boldness and delicacy, and a very large demand exists among the European residents. Every purpose in fact to which terra-cotta can be applied, can be equally well served by the baked clay of Lucknow. Vinegar, acetate of copper, sweetmeats, enamelling, seal cutting are the only other manufactures of importance.\n\nModelling, sculpture, and painting.\u2014The above arts may be said not to exist in Lucknow even in their elementary forms, such as wood or stone\ncarving, and coloured frescoes. The Oudh Nawabs employed Italian sculptors who generally worked in Ajmer marble, which by no means equals Carrara; many of their works are scattered over the public gardens of Lucknow, specially in the Wingfield Park, and others are in the houses of the princesses and nobles, specially of Malka Jah\u00e1n and Chhoti Sh\u00e1hz\u00e1di. As a rule, these works are mainly intended for decorative purposes, and do not even aim at correct or graceful modelling. A statue of Act\u00e9on attacked by his dogs is of a higher class, it bears the following inscription:\u2014 \"The first premium in London to N. Read by the Society of Polite Arts, one hundred guineas, A.D. 1761.\" The alabaster medallions and frescoes which are found in the Martiniere are elaborate specimens of an art which has practically died out, its followers having betaken themselves to modelling in clay with more success than could be anticipated, considering that they receive no instruction and have no models beyond engravings in art journals.\n\nEuropean industries and trade.\u2014In addition to the mercantile firms there is only one enterprise conducted by Europeans. This is an ice-making machine which supplies the community with clear ice at the rate of two annas a ser. The railway workshops employ many hundreds of workmen, including not less than 32 pupils of the Martiniere school, besides other Europeans and Eurasians.\n\nThere are several steam engines in Lucknow, but there is no water-power, windmills might perhaps be introduced. At Cawnpore one was erected some years ago at a cost of Rs. 85; it worked up to about four horse-power, the area of the sails being only 15 square yards. No repairs hardly were required and no storms injured it; it was ultimately superseded by steam-power. It was mainly made of wood; it might be used with excellent effect for irrigation or drainage.\n\nThe price of all materials varies much in Lucknow, and the facts are rather strange. The Railway Company, for instance, found it cheaper to import red gum sleepers from Australia at Rs. 8-6 each delivered, than to use the sal wood from the Government forests which cost Rs. 3-4-0 per foot. Mahua or mango firewood can be had for Rs. 16 the hundred cubic feet, dh\u00e1k for Rs. 10; pit coal is imported from R\u00e1iniganj. It is difficult to understand these things. Means of communication and carriage are generally very good; it appears probable that the system of purchasing in the cheapest local market has not yet been perfected, and that part of the prices paid is interrupted.\n\nWages.\u2014Wages in Lucknow of course differ somewhat from the rates prevailing in the rural districts. Jewellers get from 2 annas to 8 annas per day; but, as a rule, however, they are paid by a rate on the gold or silver they work up, from \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) anna to 2 annas in the rupee for silver work, and from 8 annas a tola to Rs. 2 per tola for gold. Weavers are very badly paid; they rarely earn above 2 annas a day; even the skilled artists who effect the intricate patterns of the Kashmir shawls do not receive more, but often less. These artisans are always in debt to their employers, and their position differs little from that of slaves, save that they are safe from personal\nviolence. Master-masons capable of building a house or temple get only 5 annas per day on the average, ordinary masons 3 annas, hodmen 1\u00bd annas, women 1\u00bd annas. Wages have fallen, and the price of materials too, with the general decay of Lucknow. Native pattern bricks for instance are now to be had at Rs. 75 per lakh, or 12 annas per thousand, delivered within a moderate distance; the Nawabi price was Rs. 125. This of course is due to the fact that so many old buildings in the depopulated city are being demolished and the materials sold. Wages in all other occupations have similarly declined. Embroiderers, lace workers, and leather workers similarly have to content themselves with reduced wages, in the face of increased dearness of provisions; the remuneration of skilled labour seems, indeed, to oscillate about 2 annas per day, sometimes less, sometimes more, according to temporary demand. The exception to this rule is in the case of arts still patronized by the State or supported by English capital, such as masonry, printing, lithography, and metal work on the railway. A good mason gets 4 annas, a printer 8 to 12 annas, a lithographer 6 annas to 1 rupee, a smith, brazier or platelayer 8 annas to 1 rupee 8 annas. The point of interest is that a worker in iron will get four times the pay of a worker in gold, because the latter can only supply as a rule purely native needs, and is not patronized by the State. Working jewellers are generally paid by a percentage on the gold or silver bullion they work up, in no case exceeding four annas in the rupee for silver, and one rupee a tola for gold. If the work is of a novel or peculiar kind, men are paid by the day at 4 to 6 annas; the most noted artists not getting more than 12 annas a day.\n\nWeaving is job work; those employed seldom earning more than 2 annas per day, except on the finest muslins. Women are so numerous in Lucknow that all kinds of embroidery and sewing are under-paid. The competition for wages is so much greater than the competition for the products of their toil that hard work at embroidery or chicken work does not fetch more than 1 rupee a month; such is the statement of the seamstresses. By contract work, on the public works, a powerful cooly can earn 5 annas per day even at earth-work. Mechanics and plate-layers on the railway get from Rs. 10 to 30 per month.\n\nAmusements.\u2014The principal amusements of Lucknow are wrestling, cock-fighting, kite-flying, quail-fighting, gambling, dancing, singing, and theatrical displays. Gambling, dancing, and singing, alone are practised throughout the entire year.\n\nWrestling is only followed during the rains; it is not clear why this is so, because in other parts of Oudh this amusement is pursued during the whole year. There is an annual tournament at which from 100 to 120 pairs of champions contend; generally about one-third of these come from Muttra, and are Chaube Brahmins of Brindaban who never eat meat; one-third are Punjabis (generally Musalmans) from Umballa, Lahore, Amritsar, Si\u00e1lkot, the rest come from Baroda, Alwar, Cawnpore, and a very few inferior wrestlers from Lucknew itself. The Mirzapur wrestling has died out. The rules do not differ very much from those of Cornish wrestling, but no\none is defeated till he is laid so flat on his back that both shoulder blades touch the earth. The sport is becoming more popular in Oudh generally for obvious reasons. Formerly every man carried arms, and skill in the use of sword, shield, spear, and matchlock was not only useful, but its display was lawful, and rewarded with applause and more substantial gifts. Now the country is disarmed, and the use of arms in any crowded assembly is placed under almost prohibitive restrictions. The people consequently have no other means of displaying or witnessing adroitness in manly exercises except wrestling.\n\nIn Lucknow itself, although popular as a spectacle, it is not much followed as an exercise. The notorious effeminacy and luxury of its inhabitants disincline them from the hard work of training and from the efforts and, indeed, dangers of the arena. Some of the wrestlers are sinewy and powerful men, but their success depends more upon perfect condition, quickness, and thorough knowledge of all the stratagems than upon physical strength. The most powerful man at the 1874 tournament only measured 40\u00bd inches round the chest, but his arm was 17 inches in circumference over the biceps. In his case, however, no one could be found to face him, and he, according to custom, received a mere pittance as charity, while minor champions received large prizes. English professionals have occasionally tried their skill, but have always been defeated by the natives.\n\nThere are two seasons for quail-fighting\u2014the one from March to June before the rains, the other after the rains from October to January. Very large sums are wagered on these fights. An untrained quail may be bought for one anna; if one turns out a good fighter Rs. 500 will be refused for it. It is the general amusement of the poorer classes.\n\nCock-fighting is carried on with some secrecy; the season is April and May; the cocks being trained for the sport throughout the cold weather, and being summered during the rains. The spurs are covered with seven folds of cotton cloth, consequently severe wounds are not given. The contests are prolonged for many hours to the inconvenience of the owners, who, if strict Musalmans, at the proper seasons spread their carpets and, with faces turned towards Mecca, murmur their prayers interpolated with words of encouragement to the combatants. The sport is sometimes cruel, because the birds are not allowed to sleep during a fight, which sometimes lasts 40 hours; pauses are allowed, but during these the bird is made to walk up and down lest its bruises should stiffen its limbs.\n\nThe season for kite-flying is more particularly in K\u00e1rtik at the Diw\u00e1li festival, but it lasts all the year except during the rains. The object of the players is to cut each others strings; for this purpose they are glued and dipped in mica, so that by sawing the cord up and down in one spot the rival string is cut in two. There are professional kite-flyers, who show great skill in so working their reels that a steady friction is kept up at a height of many hundred yards upon a small portion of the enemy's string.\n\nThe wealthier classes used to be devoted to dancing and singing or rather to watching and listening to them, but the taste is largely dying out. The causes of this are somewhat obscure. Lucknow is still a\nwealthy and voluptuous city; there are plenty of citizens who formerly daily witnessed such performances who have now abandoned them. One reason seems to be that these persons, like the petairac of early Greece, are supposed to be servants of the community or the State; they attend at public festivals, civil and religious; they receive a share of the national land; they are not so much attendants upon private wealth as attached to power and to official station; they regard themselves as belonging to the community and to its head, the ruler. Power is now in the hands of Englishmen who have little taste for these amusements; dance and song no longer form a part of State spectacles, of coronations, royal birthdays, and marriages; the profession has consequently lost much of the respectability and semi-official status which it had. Rich men in the privacy of their apartments with a few friends still enjoy the music; but the other accompaniments, regal state, troops, cannon, courtly ceremony, are absent, and the spectacle is spiritless. Patriotic songs and praises of the warrior or governor who patronizes the performers were formerly a main element of the entertainment, and they were rewarded by princely largesses. A present of Rs. 2,000 to the leader of a small troop of dancers for an evening entertainment was quite common; such excitements are now absent. It would be too ludicrous to compare a Lucknow citizen to Alha or to \u00dadal, to Rustam, or to Nausherw\u00e1n.\n\nOn the other hand, money is earned with greater difficulty now, and there is more certainty of keeping it. The bold trooper who plundered a province one day, and perhaps a year afterwards would be compelled to disgorge under torture, lightly parted with a portion in the meantime. Those who celebrated his achievements by their verses, and graced by their presence his investiture with titles and cordons, would be generously rewarded. National life, military achievement, the excitement of great gains and losses, the ceremonies of a court, and incessant creation of nobility in the province, were the causes which kept Lucknow in a condition of feverish festivity during the Nawabi.\n\nThere are symptoms that national music is reviving in another form, songs now heard are nearly all of domestic life, and descriptive of the feelings and events which take place in a family; the language is often Urdu. Some of them have a very national tone, the nation which is adopted is that of Hindust\u00e1n as apart from the Punj\u00e1b, Bengal, and England; the defeat of the English at Bhartpur is described in spirited verses which are very popular.\n\nThe dancing girls are generally called paturias; they are nearly all Muhammadans, although it is most probable that they were originally low-caste Hindus. The men of the caste marry, and their wives are very seldom unchaste. The women generally form a temporary connexion called mutda, which has no religious or civil validity, with some person or they go through a ceremony called missi, or the first blackening of the teeth, with some one, either Hindu or Moslem. These engagements can be broken by either party at pleasure, but they serve the purpose of temporary unions. The kings and nobles of Oudh used to enter into literally thousands of the former engagements, the mutda. It merely meant fidelity\non one side and maintenance on the other, and the dancing girl, who left a trooper, perhaps did mutda with a prime minister immediately afterwards. Mutda is recognized by the Shia religion as a legitimate connexion while it lasts; the Sunnis do not so regard it; it is a civil contract whose breach on either side absolves the other party from his engagement, but entails no penalties. Misei is still more curious; it seems to have Japanese analogies, but the contract seems to be more summary than the mutda. Dancing girls often carry on the profession of prostitutes. They are not allowed to bear children, but girls are purchased from other castes as wives for their brothers; they will not marry with Julahas. There is one subordinate caste of patarias, the Dom or Mirasi; they used to perform only before women, but they have lately abandoned this custom.\n\nThe instruments used are the sarangi or fiddle, the manjira or cymbals, the tabla or drum. A band consists of these three instruments and a dancing girl; an evening entertainment cost, from Rs. 3 to Rs. 250. The ordinary fee for the best singer in Lucknow is Rs. 15 but if she goes to a marriage or birth, she will get Rs. 200 or Rs. 300. The band is paid at 5 annas in the rupee. They will attend Hindu festivals such as the Holi, but some of the first-class ones object to being sprinkled with red powder or rang. The jewels and lace of an average festival dress of a first-class dancing girl will cost Rs. 1,000 to 10,000. At the dances everything is conducted with decorum; the singer is attended to, and from the entertainment by her mother or guardian (naka) and bandsmen.\n\nAs Lucknow, notwithstanding its decay, is still the admitted capital of Hindustani music, song, and poetry, these details are not without interest.\n\nLucknow theatricals.\u2014The change of rulers has apparently benefited these performances; the opportunity of ridiculing the governing class under a safe guise is too good to be lost, while the strange and in some points abhorrent features of English life furnish ample material for witty mimics. The court of justice, the police officer, the Englishmen at home, with all their defects, their ignorance of the language, their dependence upon their court officers, their lassitude and neglect of duty, their cheroots and brandy, are mercilessly exposed, yet so much verisimilitude is preserved that they are never represented as themselves cruel or corrupt. The practices of thieves, the oppressions of landlords, of native officials, are also favourite subjects of the Lucknow dramatist.\n\nLucknow garrison.\u2014Lucknow is the headquarters of the Oudh Division. The Cantonment is healthy and well situated, about three miles to the east of the city, and the garrison consists of three batteries of artillery, one regiment of British cavalry, two of British infantry, one of native cavalry, and two of native infantry. A battery of artillery and a detachment of native infantry at present occupy fort Machchhi Bhawan which commands the city, but it is the intention of Government to give up this fort and build another on a fresh site which has yet to be fixed.\n\nMACHHLIGAON*\u2014Pargana MANIKAPUR\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014A village of 1,751 inhabitants, chiefly Hindus. Is the chief bazar\n\n*By Mr. W. C. Bennett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nof the Manikapur pargana, but the trade is entirely local, and of no imperial importance. Villagers living within a radius of four or five miles come here for the brass pots, cotton clothes, and tobacco of daily use.\n\nClose to the village is the fane of Karhuan\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo, which is frequented by a small crowd of worshippers on the thirteenth day of the dark half of every month, and is the scene of a considerable fair, attended by five or six thousand Hindus from the neighbourhood at the Shiur\u00e1tri festival. The small contributions of grain and money are taken by a Gosh\u00e1\u00edn of the Gir division, who is in charge of the place.\n\nThe lingam itself was discovered during the mutiny by a Gosh\u00e1\u00edn, and is situated on a small mound of bricks which marks the locality of an ancient temple. Further excavations have discovered an old well and a few small images, which were not to be seen when I visited the spot. From its appearance I should say that the stone (and there are no traces of a proper argha) is nothing but the broken shaft of a pillar, but I was of course unable to dig in the sacred court and test the truth of my suspicions. It is in the open air, surrounded by a low wall, which encloses a court of some 25 feet square, shaded by fine trees.\n\n**MACHHREHTA Pargana*\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Pargana Machhrehta is bounded on the north by R\u00e1mkot, on the east by the river Sar\u00e1yan, on the south by Gundlamau, and on the east by Kurauna and Misrikh. It contains 126 villages, and in area is 108 square miles, of which 68 are cultivated. These 108 square miles are thus classified:**\n\n| Cultivated acres | ... | ... | ... | 43,298 |\n|------------------|-----|-----|-----|--------|\n| Culturable \"     | ... | ... | ... | 16,882 |\n| Mus\u00e1 \"           | ... | ... | ... | 552    |\n| Barren \"         | ... | ... | ... | 1,473  |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | ... | 68,999 acres.\n\nThe incidence of the revenue demand per acre is as follows:\n\n| Rs. a. p. |\n|----------|\n| On cultivated land | ... | ... | ... | 1 11 8 |\n| On assessed do.    | ... | ... | ... | 1 3 2 |\n| On total           | ... | ... | ... | 1 0 7 |\n\nThe population is thus given in the report of 1869 census:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 21,110 |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | ... | 13,811 |\n| Mussalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | 571 |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | ... | 2,185 |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | ... | 37,677\n\nAnd they live in so many as 12,120 houses, which gives the average of one house to every 3\u00b71 persons. The population has, therefore, much greater house accommodation than the population of any pargana in the district.\n\nFrom the foregoing figures we see that there are 345 souls to the square mile, and that to each head of the agricultural population there are 2 acres of cultivated and 2\u00b78 acres of assessed land. There is thus ample room\n\n*By Mr. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nfor the further development of agriculture and population, which is 10 per cent lower than the provincial average. The only road in the pargana is that which runs from Khairabad through Machhrehta to Nimkh\u00e2r (q. v.), And the only water communication is that afforded to the eastern frontier villages by the river Sar\u00eeyan. The pargana is crossed from west to east by a smaller and unnavigable river the Ketha. Both streams are bridged where the road crosses them.\n\nOn the whole this is a good pargana for agriculture; the percentage of first-class crops is as much as 39, the largest in the tahsil. There are no marked features in the landscape, no lakes, or even large jh\u00fbls; no forest, hills, or valleys. In some parts water is found within 8 feet of the surface; in others not until a depth of 50 feet has been dug.\n\nBazars are held in 6 villages\u2014namely, Machhrehta, B\u00eehat, Bani\u00e2mau, Haluapur, Mirzapur, and Dingra. Nothing is sold at these beyond the common necessaries of life. The pargana boasts of no manufactures or productions peculiar to it. There are no mines or quarries. Two fairs are held in Machhrehta, the names and particulars of which are described in the history of that town, to which also the reader is referred for the origin of the name 'Machhrehta.'\n\nThe pargana was constituted by Todar Mal, in whose time the lands were owned by an Ahban R\u00e2ja, Kesri Singh by name. He was deposed by Akbar, and his estates conferred on two K\u00e2yaths, B\u00e1l Chand and Bir Chand, whose father (Parasram) had been d\u00eew\u00e2n to the Ahban chieftain, and had been put to death by him. On their death, the family lost it, and various petty zamindars possessed themselves of the constituent villages. Subsequently, or in 1767 A.D., the grandfather of the late well known Nawab Ali Naqi Khan, Minister to the King of Oudh, got the pargana in J\u00e2g\u00eer, and so held it for 42 years. The zamindaris are at present distributed thus:\n\n| Villages | Janw\u00e2r |\n|----------|--------|\n| 18       |        |\n| 10       | B\u00e2chhi |\n| 9        | Kachhw\u00e2ha |\n| 15       | Bais |\n| 12       | R\u00e2thor |\n| 9        | Sombansi |\n| 1        | Chauhan |\n| 1        | Gaur |\n\nTotal 99, belonging to Rajputs. The remainder are held\u201410 by K\u00e2yaths, 6\u00bd by Brahmins, 2 by a Bairagi, 7\u00bd, il\u00e2qa R\u00e2jpura, by M\u00eer Muhammad Husen Khan, Taluqdar, who is the only taluqdar in the pargana. He owns also il\u00e2qa Kuli in the neighbouring pargana of Kurauna; both estates he acquired by mortgage in 1262 faisl, during which year he was a collector under the native Government. There is not much known of his family. He and his brothers came from Budaun where they have some small landed property. One of them was slain in the mutiny, another is known as Captain Fida Husen, and is a Taluqdar in the Kheri district.\n\nThe Kachhw\u00e2ha colony has its headquarters at B\u00eehat (not the B\u00eehat of pargana Misrikh), called B\u00eehat B\u00eeram after the founder's name, B\u00eeram Singh, who settled here in 1459 A.D.; having come over from Jaipur. The history of the family is not known; but the present zamindars trace back\nthrough 11 generations their descent from B\u00edram. They are the only Kachhw\u00e1ha Chhattirs in this district, and are of the Rajw\u00e1r subdivision of that tribe; the head of the Rajw\u00e1rs being the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Jaipur.\n\nThe Bais zamindars are members of the Bais colony settled in the adjoining pargana of Pirnagar.\n\nThe Janw\u00e1rs of Bani\u00e1mau claim a much more ancient date for the acquisition of their estate than do their fellow-clansmen in this district; in fact, their family-tree extends back for 33 generations and 1149 years. But no particulars of their history are known, save that they came from Gujar\u00e1t. Debi Singh is the present head of the family.\n\nThe story about the K\u00e1yath succeeding the Ahbans above related is very similar to that told respecting Khairabad (q. v.); and as it has been given by a K\u00e1yath it must be accepted cum grano salis.\n\n**MACCHREHTA Town**\u2014Pargana MACCHREHTA\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Machhrehta (27\u00b0 25' north, and 80\u00b0 41' east) is about sixteen miles south of Sitapur, lying on the good unmetalled road which runs from Khairabad to N\u00edmkh\u00e1r on the Gumti. It was founded at the time the pargana was demarcated by Akbar's revenue officials, 325 years ago, and is called after Muchhandar N\u00e1th, a holy man, who abode here in those days; the place being known as the Tap-bhummi, or land of the hermits. The population is 4,578, of whom 2,806 are Hindus. There are no old ruins or places of historical interest in it. It does not possess a single masonry house; the mud houses are 738, the Hindu temples are 9 in number; one of them being on the brink of a large excavated tank called \"Hardw\u00e1r T\u00edrath,\" which is holy in the eyes of the people, and which is guarded by an ancient Bair\u00e1gi. Here, in the month of Ph\u00e1gun, congregate two or three thousand devotees, who go down into the lake to wash off their sins. In a neighbouring grove of pakaria trees the R\u00e1m\u00edlla is celebrated in Ku\u00e1r. The mosques are 4 in number, besides which there is an im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra built by a dancing girl in modern times. There is an old sar\u00e1\u00e9, the remains of a Government fort, a school house, and a post-office. There is a daily bazar. The only manufactures are coarse cloth and sugar. There is no water or rail communication from anywhere, and the only road to it besides the one abovementioned is from Misrikh, which is six miles westwards.\n\n**MAGDAPUR Pargana**\u2014Tahsil MUHAMDI\u2014District KHERI.\u2014The Magdapur pargana, traversed by the unmetalled road from Lakh\u00edmpur to Muhamdi, lies to the south of pargana Atwa Piparia, between the rivers Kathna on the east and Gumti on the west. The right bank of the former river is bordered by low swampy ground, succeeded by a belt of s\u00e1l forest, two or three miles wide, through which the surface gradually rises until, when cultivation is reached, the soil is high dry loam. In the middle of the pargana is a depression where water in the wells is found at a depth of only nine or ten feet; but as the Gumti is approached, the level rises again, and in the extreme south-west sand-hills have been formed. Generally the soil is of inferior fertility.\n\n*By Mr. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. T. R. Redfern, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nThe total area, 56 square miles, supports a scanty and often sickly population of 9,494, of which 22 per cent. are Ahirs. The rate to the square mile is 178, or, excluding the forest tracts, 203. The inhabitants find a livelihood in agricultural or pastoral pursuits; there are no manufactures of importance and no noteworthy markets or fairs. The prevailing unhealthiness is attributed to poison engendered in air and water by the jungle of the Kathna valley.\n\nThe history of Magdapur is involved in that of Barwar, of which pargana it formed part until the most recent settlement. The earliest proprietors, who have been clearly identified, were the B\u00e1chhil Chhatris\u2014a clan which became troublesome not long after the death of the Emperor Shah Jah\u00e1n, and was reduced by the Sayyads of Pih\u00e1ni. The sway of the latter family endured till 1147 Hijri (A.D. 1730), when a converted Hindu client, Baldeo Singh, alias Ib\u00e1dulla, ousted his patrons and seized the whole estate. His grandson, Ghul\u00e1m Nabi, failing to meet the revenue demand of a now stronger Government, was arrested in 1190 fasli (A.D. 1783), and died in Lucknow. Mansa R\u00e1m, Chakladar, who arrived in 1193 fasli (A.D. 1786), restored the descendants of the old B\u00e1chhil proprietors, and during seventy years there was no taluqdar in Magdapur. In 1851 A.D., however, R\u00e1ja Ashraf Ali, the representative of Ib\u00e1dulla, accepted a farming lease of most of the villages\u2014a truly fortunate engagement, for, at annexation under the operation of British policy, he was recognized as sole proprietor. Subsequently his son's estate became encumbered, and is now under the management of the Deputy Commissioner of the district.\n\nMagdapur comprises 34 demarcated villages\u2014viz., 26\u00bd taluqdari and 7\u00bd the property of smaller owners, yielding at present (1875-76) a revenue of Rs. 12,485. The jungle along the bank of the Kathna was granted in allotments by the British Government to private individuals, whose capital, however, proved inadequate to the difficulties presented by malaria and scarcity of labour. The grants have in great part been resumed under the waste land rules, and converted to reserved forest tracts.\n\n**MAGR\u00c1YAR Pargana\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.**\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Purwa, on the east by Panhan and P\u00e1tan, on the south by Gh\u00e1tampur, and on the west by Harha. In shape it is triangular, eight miles in length from east to west, and seven in breadth from north to south. The area is 31 square miles or 19,484 acres. The soil is in the proportion of six-sevenths loam to about one-seventh clay, sand being scarcely anywhere found. The proportion of irrigated to unirrigated land is as 5 to 1. The river Lon from the neighbourhood of Unao passes through this pargana. It does, however, no good as the depth of its channel cut in the sandy ground renders the water unavailable for irrigation; no water remains in it during the spring harvest time. Water is found on an average at the depth of 22 feet.\n\nA road from Rae Bareli to Cawnpore passes through this pargana. There are 4 markets\u2014Mi\u00e1nganj, Magr\u00e1yar, Bigahpur Kal\u00e1n, and L\u00e1lganj. The first is held on Sundays and Wednesdays, the second on Mondays and Thursdays, the third on Tuesdays and Fridays, and the fourth on Wed-\nnesdays. The Government revenue is Rs. 21,864, and the rate per acre on an average is Re. 1-2-0. The tenure is as follows:\n\n| Villages | Acres |\n|----------|-------|\n| Taluqdari | 12    |\n| Zamindari | 11    |\n| Pattidar | 8     |\n|          | 31    |\n|          | 19,484|\n\nThe population consists chiefly of Brahmans, and it amounts to 16,188.\n\nThis pargana derives its name from the principal village Magr\u00e1yar, but the origin of the word cannot be ascertained. It was established as a pargana in the time of Akbar, and prior to annexation a tahsildar resided at Magr\u00e1yar, and had charge of the whole pargana. The proprietary body are chiefly K\u00e1yaths and Brahmans. Of the architectural works there is but a temple in honour of Sri Mah\u00e1deo, built of stone by a banker, at a cost of nearly Rs. 50,000. This temple is in Bigahpur Kal\u00e1n.\n\n**Magr\u00e1yar Pargana\u2014Magr\u00e1yar\u2014Tahsil Purwa\u2014District Unao.**\n\nThis town lies six miles south of the tahsil headquarters and eighteen miles east of Unao. The soil is principally clay and loam, water fresh, site level. There is a school here for teaching Urdu and N\u00e1gri. The annual amount of sales at the bazar are about Rs. 3,000. The total population amounts to 1,190, of which 1,084 are Hindus and 106 Musalmans. There are 139 mud-built houses and five of masonry; one mosque and five temples\u2014four to Debi and one to Mah\u00e1deo.\n\n**Mahadeva Purgana\u2014Tahsil Begamganj\u2014District Gonda.**\n\nThis pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Gonda, on the south by the parganas of Nawabganj and Digsar, on the west by Gonda and Digsar, and on the east by pargana Nawabganj. At settlement three villages were transferred to Nawabganj, and one village from pargana Guw\u00e1r\u00edch, and eight from pargana Digsar were added, thus enlarging its area from 50,192 to 58,154 acres, or 89 square miles divided into 104 mauzas or townships. The land of this pargana which lies north of the Fyzabad and Gonda imperial road is high and called uparh\u00e1r, and that to the south of the same road is low, and is known by the name of tarh\u00e1r. The area of the pargana is thus divided:\n\n| Unculturable waste | 4,848 acres or 8 per cent. |\n|---------------------|---------------------------|\n| Cultivable ditto    | 21,390 ,, or 38 ,,         |\n| Cultivated          | 29,910 ,, or 52 ,,         |\n| Groves              | 1,416 ,, or 2 ,,           |\n| Total               | 56,764 ,,                  |\n\nOf the cultivated area 25 per cent. is 1st class or goind soil, 51 per cent. 2nd class or majh\u00e1r, and 24 per cent. 3rd class or sand. The irrigated land is 11,265 acres or 40 per cent., and the unirrigated 18,545 acres or 60 per cent. of the actual cultivation. The jungle grants cover 2,220 acres. The only river that traverses this pargana is the Tirhi. It takes its rise in the Chittor tank lying four miles south-east of Bahraich town, and after a tortuous course passes the villages of Kh\u00e1npur in Guw\u00e1r\u00edch pargana and R\u00e1nipur of pargana Mahadewa, and ultimately falls into the Gogra at\nMohna Gh\u00e1t opposite Bir\u00e1hempur of pargana Nawabganj. It skirts 15 villages of this pargana, and is to some extent serviceable for irrigation purposes. It is not utilized for navigation.\n\nWater is met with at from 12 to 18 feet.\n\nThe Government revenue demand amounts to Rs. 49,206-6-0, land revenue Rs. 47,965, and cesses Rs. 1,241-6-0.\n\nThe pargana belongs to the lords of Balr\u00e1mpur and Singha Chanda, the taluqdars of Paska, Manjhig\u00e1on, and Manikapur. But the landlord of Manjhig\u00e1on only has his headquarters within its limits. The varieties of tenure are as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari | Bhayach\u00e1ra | Jungle grant |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------------|\n|           |           |           |            |             |\n| 87        | 39        | 146       | 18         | 16          |\n\nTotal: 311\n\nOf these\u2014\n\n| Villages number | Coparcenary estates |\n|-----------------|---------------------|\n|                 |                     |\n| 104             | 207                 |\n\nTotal: 311 villages and coparcenary estates.\n\nThe following is the tribal distribution of property:\n\n| Tribe         | Number |\n|---------------|--------|\n| Chhattri      | 216    |\n| Brahman       | 56     |\n| K\u00e1yath        | 15     |\n| Musalman      | 12     |\n| Bair\u00e1gi       | 4      |\n| Bh\u00e1t          | 3      |\n| Bas\u00ed\u00e1n        | 2      |\n| Gosh\u00e1\u00edn       | 3      |\n| Europeans     | 2      |\n\nTotal: 311 villages and coparcenary estates.\n\nThe population of the pargana amounts to 48,166 souls, who live in 8,208 houses, of which only 22 are masonry. The numbers of prevailing castes are as follows:\n\n| Caste          | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Brahman        | 10,026 |\n| Kori           | 5,815  |\n| Chhattri       | 4,501  |\n| Ah\u00edr           | 3,918  |\n| Kab\u00e1r          | 2,700  |\n| Kurmi          | 2,209  |\n| Mur\u00e1o          | 1,966  |\n| N\u00e9\u00f3 (Hindu)    | 1,119  |\n| Teli (Hindu)   | 1,046  |\n| Lunia          | 979    |\n| K\u00e1yath         | 795    |\n| Gareria        | 782    |\n\nThere are two roads that pass through the pargana\u2014the one leading from Colonelganj to the Nawabganj bazar, and the other, the imperial road, from\nFyzabad to Gonda. All the traffic of this pargana is carried on by these roads.\n\nSchools have been established at the following villages:\n\n| Village   | Pupils |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Kaharba   | 65     |\n| Chaubepur | 52     |\n| Payagpur  | 50     |\n| Ramapur   | 30     |\n\nThe post, police, and registry offices are all at Wazirganj.\n\nHistory.\u2014(See Nawabganj pargana, district Gonda.) A few facts may however be added. At the time Sayyad Salar fell in battle at Bahaich, Hatila, lieutenant of his, made an attack on Asokpur, where there was a police post of Suhel Deo, and was killed. His shrine still stands there.\n\nThe Chhattari ascendancy in this pargana dates from the time of the massacre of the Doms by Raja Jagat Singh, Kayath, Subahdar. Sahaj Singh, Kalhans, an officer of the Raja's army, conquered the fort of Dumru Nath, and was granted by the Raja this part of the country. The Kalhans ruled for seven generations, till in the 8th Achal Narain Singh came to the throne, and gave the country under his sway the name of Khurasa. Raja Achal Narain Singh granted this ilaq of Bondia Ghata to Sahang Raja and Malang Raja, Gorha Bisens, for their bravery in conquering the fort of, and arresting Mahabal Singh, the Raja of Ikauna. Since then the Gorha Bisens have got a footing in the country. Towards the end of the 15th century Achal Narain Singh and his family were destroyed by the Gogra. (See district article, Gonda; also \"Carnegy's Races of Oudh.\") There are still some traces of the former inundation of the Gogra in this part in the shape of jhils. For some time the country remained without a head, till Sarabjit Singh, a deputy of Achal Narain, seated on the gaddi one Partab Singh of the Gorakhpur family and a relative of his. The headquarters then lay at Kohani, a village in pargana Digsar, but Raja Man Singh removed them to Gonda.\n\nPargana families.\u2014Raja Randhir Singh of Paraspur is descended from Maharaj Singh (the posthumous son of Achal Narain Singh of Khurasa), who was born at his maternal grandfather's house. He holds twenty-seven villages, and pays an annual jama of Rs. 29,064-9-9.\n\nThakurain Iklas Kunwar of Paska also belongs to the same family; her property consists of twenty villages, and gives Rs. 16,944.\n\nBhayya Harratan Singh of Manjhigdon.\u2014This taluqdar is descended from Sahang Raja, or Malang Raja who was granted the ilaq of Bodia Ghata by Achal Narain. Harratan Singh behaved well during the mutiny, and was granted the estate of Aunradin in tahsil Utraula as a reward. He now holds twenty-one villages, and pays an annual revenue of Rs. 4,418.\n\nAntiquities.\u2014Of the antiquities of the pargana the following may be mentioned. The garden and apartment at Wazirganj, was built by Nawab Shuja-ud-daula, the remnants of the fort of Suhel Deo, in the shape of a mound by the side of the Fyzabad-Gonda road, and the dith in mauza Dumru.\nN\u00e1th on the side of the above road, which was the site of the fort of the Dom R\u00e1ja Ugarsen. There are nine shiw\u00e1l\u00e1s and five other Hindu religious buildings. Musalman mosques number four. The only religious fairs of note are those of B\u00e1lesur N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo at Bhat Penri, and of Hat\u00edla P\u00edr in Asokpur. The first is a Hindu one, and is held on the Shiur\u00e1tttri in Ph\u00e1gun, and the second is a Musalman one held in honour of Hatila, the lieutenant of Masa\u00fad, mentioned above, on the same day when there is one held at Bahraich in honour of the latter. In the first the gathering amounts to 40,000, and in the second to only 2,000. Neither of them is commercial.\n\nMAHADEWA\u2014Pargana MAHADEWA\u2014Tahsil BEGAMGANJ\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This place is of little importance, though it gives its name to the pargana. Its population is 578; it is fourteen miles east of Gonda, twenty-six miles from Balhr\u00e1mghat, and seventy-four from the hills. Water is met with at 12 feet from the surface. There is a jhil (kundar) on the south side of the village, from which irrigation is chiefly carried on.\n\nThe land on which the village now stands was formerly covered with a large jungle, within which there was a shiw\u00e1la of Gauri Har N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo, which is still extant. Gorkhi Gir, Gosh\u00e1in, ancestor of the present proprietors, was granted 250 bighas of land surrounding the temple by the R\u00e1ja of Khur\u00e1sa, and the former cleared the jungle and settled himself there under the protection of the deity, from whose name he called the village \"Mahadewa.\" Besides this ancient shrine there is another shiw\u00e1la of recent date built by a certain Subahdar. There is no Muhammadan place of worship.\n\nMAHG\u00c1W\u00c1N\u2014*Pargana KALY\u00c1NMAL\u2014Tahsil SAND\u00cdLA\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014A Sakarw\u00e1r village of 394 mud houses, population 2,941, nine miles north of Sand\u00edla in the heart of pargana Kaly\u00e1nmal. Its inhabitants have a local reputation for honesty in conducting arbitrations. Market days Mondays and Thursdays.\n\nMAHMUDABAD\u2020 Pargana\u2014Tahsil B\u00c1RI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Pargana Mahmudabad, in shape like a shoulder of mutton with the leg pointing northwards, is bounded on the north by pargana Bisw\u00e1n, on the east by pargana Sadrpur, on the south by the Bara Banki district, and on the west by pargana B\u00e1ri; its area is 130 square miles, of which 92 are cultivated. Along the north-east boundary flows the petty stream Sumbe, which in the hot season is almost dry, and in the wet season is a wide flood. In the south-west corner of the pargana is another small stream as unimportant as the Sumbe. Also to the north-east is a low lying strip of tar\u00e1i land, once apparently the bed of the river Chauka, which now flows eight miles further to the east, and bordered by a high ridge of land, a continuation of that which runs through pargana L\u00e1harpur (g.v.). With the exception of these streams and this ridge of land with its tar\u00e1i, the pargana presents the same appearance as that of this part of Oudh\u2014a uniform level, well-wooded, and thick with fine crops. Irrigation is abundant, specially in the western villages, which constitute the best part of the\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harlington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\npargana. The tarai above mentioned does not require irrigation at all as it is green throughout the year, the water lying close to the surface. Elsewhere the greatest depth at which water is found is thirty feet.\n\nThe acreage is thus divided\u2014\n\n| Cultivated | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Acres |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Culturable | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 59,885 |\n|            |     |     |     |     |     | 10,839 |\n| Total      |     |     |     |     |     | 70,224 assessed |\n\n| Muafi      | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 146   |\n| Barren     | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 12,737 |\n|            |     |     |     |     |     | 12,883 unassessed |\n\nTotal 63,097\n\nThe revised assessment is Rs. 1,13,468, which gives the following incidence\u2014\n\n| On cultivation | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Rs. 1 15 4 |\n| \" assessed area | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | \" 1 9 10 |\n| \" total area   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | \" 1 5 10 |\n\nThe population of the census of 1869 was as follows:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 88,312 |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 28,069 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 6,340 |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 6,047 |\n| Total                |     |     |     |     |     | 78,768 |\n\nand these live in 15,043 houses.\n\nThere are 567 souls to the square mile, the highest pargana average in Sitapur, and, with the exception of pargana Bilgram in Hardoi, the highest in the Sitapur Division. The Musalmans are seventeen per cent. of the entire population. Each house has 4\u00b79 occupants, for each head of the agricultural population there are about one and one-third acres of cultivation, and one and two-thirds acres of assessed land.\n\nThe pargana is of a date subsequent to Todar Mal's famous land settlement, not having been constituted as such until the reign of Jahangir, who is said to have formed it out of 250 villages of pargana Fatehpur. In course of time the taluqdars increased their estate by 78 villages, which, with 100 belonging to petty zamindars, made up the number to 428. At survey operations 252 of these 428 were transferred to neighbouring parganas, and 93 villages of other parganas were included in this, thus leaving 269, the present number. These 269 villages have been demarcated into 197 townships, of which the Mahmudabad taluqdar owns 125.\n\nIt may be noted that these Shekh taluqdars are known as Kh\u00e1nzadas, and that the R\u00e1ja of Mahmudabad represents the younger branch of the family. His father got the title of raja in 1850 A.D., and Government\nhas recognized it in the person of the present taluqdar. The title has not been recognized in the case of the Paintepur taluqdar, who represents the elder branch.\n\nThe pargana is not celebrated in any way. To the description of the towns of Mahmudabad and Paintepur the reader is referred for particulars regarding the roads, bazars, and schools.\n\n**MAHMUDABAD Town**\u2014Pargana MAHMUDABAD\u2014Tahsil BARI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Mahmudabad, in the pargana of the same name, was founded about 200 years ago by Mahmud Khan, ancestor of the present taluqdar. It lies in 27\u00b0 17' north latitude, and 80\u00b0 40' east longitude, and is on the high road from Sitapur to Bahramghat, being 38 miles from the former place and 28 from the latter. It is also connected by road with Bari on the Shahjahanpur trunk road and with Bara Banki. It is not near any railway or river.\n\nThe town contains 6,312 souls, the Hindus and Musalmans being about equal in number. With the exception of the taluqdar's residence, a new and lofty mansion, three stories high, and the sacred edifices, there are no masonry buildings in the place. The mud houses number 1,594.\n\nThe bazars are good. Rs. 1,14,804 are returned as the value of last year's sales.\n\nBrass vessels are manufactured on the spot. The mosques and temples are very few in number\u2014seven of one and four of the other,\u2014and are undeserving of notice. The public buildings are police, post, and registry offices, a school in which there are 130 boys on the books, and a sarai.\n\nThe encamping ground is in a very large grove called Lakhpera, or the grove of a hundred thousand trees, but the trees are stunted and the shade is not good. The town is not famous in any way.\n\n**MAHOLI** Pargana\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Pargana Maholi is bounded on the north by the Kheri district, on the east by pargana Sitapur, on the south by pargana Misrikh, and on the west by the Kathna river which divides it from pargana Chandra. In area it is 79 square miles, of which 45 are cultivated. These 79 square miles represent 51,075 acres which are thus classified:\n\n| Category          | Acres |\n|-------------------|-------|\n| Cultivated        | 28,627|\n| Culturable        | 8,279 |\n| Muafif (rent-free)| 8,283 |\n| Barren            | 5,887 |\n\nand the incidence of the Government demand on this is as follows:\n\n- On cultivated area: Rs. 1 8 9 per acre.\n- Assessed area: Rs. 1 2 10\n- Total: Rs. 1 0 3\n\nThe population amounted in 1869 to 33,678, living in 6,757 houses, or 423 to the square mile, and 4.9 to each house. They are distributed in this manner.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe Muhammadans are thus only $5\\frac{1}{2}$ per cent. of the entire population.\n\nTo each head of the agricultural population there are $1\\frac{1}{2}$ acres of cultivated and $1\\frac{3}{4}$ acres of assessed land. There is thus comparatively little room for the extension of cultivation or the increase of the population.\n\nThe pargana is a plain of great fertility; the soil is generally good loam, the exception being the sandy and raviny tracts in the neighbourhood of the K\u00e1thna river. The country like every other pargana in the district is well wooded. There is a good deal of high cultivation owing to the presence of several colonies of those industrious peasants, the Kurmis, and much sugarcane is grown. The irrigation is chiefly from mud wells, and from jhils and other natural water-holes; little use seems to be made of the K\u00e1thna, which, if properly dammed, would prove a source of considerable irrigation to the lands in its vicinity. A petty stream, called the Pirai, touches the pargana for a short distance on the north, and is there made use of for this purpose by the peasants of the villages by which it passes.\n\nTwo main roads pass through the pargana\u2014namely, the old and the new road to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The former made by the celebrated N\u00e1zim Hak\u00edm Mehndi, the other by the British Government. In some parts these roads run very close to each other, and the average distance between them is only $1\\frac{1}{2}$ miles.\n\nThe chief bazars are held bi-weekly at Maholi Barag\u00e1on, and Kuseli, the Kurmi colony. At these all the ordinary necessaries of life may be purchased, besides sugar of various qualities. There is no article of commerce or manufacture peculiar to the pargana, nor does it contain any mines or quarries, properly so called; kankar is dug up for only local use in metalling the high road abovementioned.\n\nThe name of the pargana is derived from that of the town, the history of which may be found in another place. Suffice it to say here, that on its site there stood formerly an older town, which had fallen into decay, but was rebuilt 500 years ago by one Mahipal, Kurmi, after whom it was called Maholi.* Tradition informs us that the district was once held by the P\u00e1s\u00eds, who formerly, as we see in the case of Khairabad and L\u00e1harpur, were possessed of great power in this part of the province. In those days Maholi was not known as a distinct pargana, but was amongst the sixteen tappas which made up pargana \"N\u00edmkh\u00e1r.\" This pargana, as arranged by Todar Mal, comprised six muh\u00e1ls\u2014namely, Maholi, Misrikh, N\u00edmkh\u00e1r, Kasta, Abg\u00e1on, and Sikandarabad, of which the last three are now in\n\n*See Journal B.A.S., No. 284, pp. 6 and 13.\nKheri. The P\u00e1s\u00eds who held sway in Maholi were so powerful that one of their chief men, Hunsa by name, desired of his neighbour, the Mitauli taluqdar, the hand of his daughter in marriage. The Mitauli man openly assented to the proposition, but secretly sent off messengers to the powerful Ahban R\u00e1ja of Pataunja, praying him to come to his assistance, and save a brother Rajput from the indignity which the low born P\u00e1si would thrust upon him. So the Ahban troops came up, as if to take part in the marriage ceremony, and there was great rejoicing among the P\u00e1s\u00eds for the marriage of their chief (Hunsa). But the Ahbans set before them a feast of pig\u2019s flesh and strong liquor. And the P\u00e1s\u00eds feasted thereon, and became gorged with the food and drunk with the wine, and the Ahbans fell upon them and slew many and drove the rest out. So the Ahbans were victorious and became rulers of Mitauli and the surrounding district, and they held it for 200 years, having their headquarters still at Pataunja. But in 1670 A.D., the Delhi monarch sent against them a Mughal chief, Mirza Bah\u00e1dur Beg by name, to reduce their power, for they refused to pay tribute, and then the Ahban R\u00e1ja abandoned his capital and went north to Mitauli, and his power dwindled away by degrees until it was confined to a small circle of villages round that town. Meanwhile an invasion of Gaura took place, and that tribe got a footing in Maholi, which they held from 1174 to 1188 fasli. In 1189 (corresponding to 1781 A.D.), Kunwar Newal Singh, son of the last Ahban R\u00e1ja, was restored, and his Gaur rival dispossessed, but he held his recovered patrimony for only one year. A man of no capacity or character, he was again dispossessed, and his estates were let out to farmers, who managed the property down to 1227 fasli or 1820 A.D. In the following year the sympathies of this pargana and the neighbouring one were aroused for the old Ahban family, and the zamindars refused to come in and take up their engagements unless the Ahban R\u00e1ja was restored. The chakladar (revenue-collector), a K\u00e1yath by caste, and more at home with his pen than with a sword, got frightened, and gave into the vox populi. So the Ahban was restored to so much of his ancestral estates as were comprised in Maholi, Kasta, and Abg\u00e1on. The Sikan-darabad taluqa had passed to a member of the family who had become a Musalman. The restored raja was Khanjan Singh, and in 1242 fasli (1834 A.D.), he engaged for the whole pargana. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the rebel Lone Singh, whose estates were confiscated for complicity in the mutiny of 1857. The pedigree table is thus given by General Sleeman:\n\nMitanli r\u00e9j.\n\nR\u00e1ja Debi Singh died without heirs.\n\nDat Singh. six sons.\n\nKhanjan Singh, Lone Singh and 4 others.\n\nBhajan Singh.\n\nMan Singh Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed D\u00edn (adopted son).\n\n6 annas.\nKhanjan was the ablest man of the whole seven, and by force of character, and backed up by those \"gros bataillons,\" which providence so often favours, got possession of all the shares, the \"8 annas\" of his cousin and the \"6\u00bd annas\" of his five brothers. The confiscated estates in Maholi have been bestowed by Government upon certain loyal grantees, one of whom is Mirza Abbas Beg, late an extra assistant commissioner in Oudh. Maholi itself was conferred on Nawab Amjad Ali Khan in lieu of certain lands taken up by Government for the Sitapur cantonment.\n\n**MAHOLI**\u2014Pargana MAHOLI\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Maholi, which contains 1,676 inhabitants, residing in 340 mud houses, lies on the high road from Sitapur to Shahjah\u00e1npur, being fifteen miles distant from the former, and 38 from the latter place. It is said to derive its name from one Mahip\u00e1l, a Kurmi, who lived 500 years ago, and who gave his name to a new town built on the site of an older one which had fallen into decay. Through it runs the river K\u00e1thna, which is spanned by two bridges, one built 65 years ago by the philanthropic N\u00e1zim Hak\u00edm Mehndi, the other a construction of the present Government. The same N\u00e1zim built a sar\u00e1e now in decay, and founded a bazar. There are also the remains of the old Government fort built in the time of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula. The public buildings are\u2014a police station, a school at which 53 boys attend, and a sar\u00e1e. The principal sacred buildings are two\u2014namely, a shiw\u00e1la built 70 years ago by a B\u00e1jpe\u00ed, and the darg\u00e1h of a sainted man named Hat\u00eda P\u00edr. The place is not historically famous, nor are there any fairs held at it beyond the weekly bazars. The situation of the town is good. The annual value of the bazar sales is Rs. 5,000.\n\n**MAHOLI**\u2014Pargana MANGALSI\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014This little village was founded by Mahor\u00e1m S\u00e1h, Chauh\u00e1n, who called it after his own name; it was given him by Mangal Sen, Gautam (see account of pargana Mangalsi). It is 20 miles from Fyzabad on the banks of the Gogra. Bazar Muhammadpur was established here by Muhammad Shah; the market days are Sundays and Wednesdays. The population consists of 1,811 Hindus, and 161 Musalmans. There is a temple to Bisheshwar N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo, a N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi place of worship, and one Government school. There are also three mud-built sar\u00e1es. The fair of R\u00e1m's marriage is celebrated here on Aghan Sudi 5th (December), and is attended by 1,000 people.\n\n**MAHONA Pargana\u2020\u2014Tahsil MALIHABAD\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The pargana of Mahona lies along the left bank of the Gumti river. It is bounded on the south by pargana Lucknow, on the west by Malihabad, on the north by Sitapur, and on the east by the Bara Banki district. In shape it is irregular, but longer than it is broad; its length varies from twelve to sixteen miles whilst its breadth is from seven to ten. Its centre may be fixed at about Rukh\u00e1ra where the 27\u00b0 5' par. of latitude and 80\u00b0 95' of longitude would cross each other. Its area is one hundred and forty-seven square miles, and it contains one hundred and ninety-five villages, each averaging an area of four hundred and eighty-three acres. Its population is 71,518, or 486 to the square mile, but on the cultivated area it falls at the rate of 872.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\nOf this population 97 per cent. is Musalman.\n\n90-3 Hinda.\n54-8 Agricultural.\n45-2 Non-agricultural.\n\nThe proportion of agriculturists is low, seeing that there is still left a great deal of culturable land, and of a very fair quality, awaiting the plough.\n\nOf the total area of 52,979 acres\u2014\n\n56-21 is cultivated,\n34-69 is culturable,\nand 19-17 is unculturable.\n\nNearly all the unculturable land is to be found at the south end of the pargana, which is crossed by large barren plains.\n\nThe country is fertile and well cultivated, but along the banks of the Gumti, and stretching for a considerable distance inland, it is undulating and varied, crossed one while by sandy tracts, and intersected at another by marshes, that are fed from springs which rise from the higher lands. Nevertheless, the low land produces abundant thatching grass which is carried down the river to Lucknow in large boats, and towards the north of the tract the land becomes tarai and level, and though subject to inundations, and sometimes overmoist with water, only a few feet from the surface may be cropped with fine wheat. In the centre of the pargana is a large tract of jungle which only awaits the cultivator. But probably it will be broken up ere long, and would have been before, but that it belongs mostly to taluqdars who can afford to wait, and whose object is to see the new revenue fixed before they take it in hand. The chief crops flourish\u2014poppy and vegetables\u2014round the homesteads, and sugar, wheat, and pulses to the furthest corners of the townships. Mud wells can be dug freely, and water can be met at twenty-five feet from the surface, while the wells hold eleven feet of water. Irrigation extends to forty-eight per cent. more than ordinary average, but of this eighty-one per cent., is due to jhils and ponds.\n\nOn the whole, it is one of the best parganas in the district. And the average holdings of the cultivators are very fair, and larger than in most of the Cis-Gumti parganas. Rent ranges from Rs. 5 to Rs. 5-8, but Kurmis\u2014of whom, however, there are not very many\u2014pay Rs. 7-7 and Kachhis Rs. 9-14. The revenue assessed by the summary settlement was Rs. 104,490. The revised demand is Rs. 1,35,486. The rates fall at Rs. 2-8 on cultivated, Re. 1-13 on cultivated and culturable, and Re. 1-6 throughout.\n\nThe largest towns are\u2014\n\nMahona, with a population of ... ... ... 3,594\nItaunja ... ... ... ... 2,254\nAnd Mariason ... ... ... ... 3,124\n\nIt has only six other villages, with a population of between 1,000 and 2,000. They are\u2014Usirna, Banoga, Bhauli, Kathwara, and Nabi-kot-Nandna.\n\nGovernment schools have been established in the three large towns abovementioned, and in Usirna, Am\u00e1niganj, Kathwara, Paharnagar, Bakhshi-ka-t\u00e1l\u00e1b, Banoga, and Nabi-kot-Nandna. The district post-office has been placed at Itaunja, and outside the village, facing the road, is the police station, where a chief constable and fifteen others of subordinate grade are posted. At Bakhshi-ka-t\u00e1l\u00e1b is an outpost, where a staff of six policemen\nhas been placed. The whole of the pargana, a small portion of the south end excepted, is within the jurisdiction of these two stations. The area is one hundred and thirty-five square miles. At Bakhshi-ka-t\u00e1l\u00e1b is one of the encamping grounds for troops.\n\nThere is a large tank here which in fact gives its name to the place, the Bakhshi's tank, built by Bakhshi Tipur Chand, the paymaster of Nasir-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, the 2nd king of Oudh. It is a handsome tank, with flights of steps leading down to the water on its four sides, and flanked by four towers at its corners. On the far side, facing the road, was a temple raised to the god Th\u00e1kur B\u00e1nke Bih\u00e1ri, and alongside the founder built a handsome house, and walled in a garden for himself. But the Bakhshi fell into disgrace, and the whole is falling into ruins.\n\nRoad communication in the pargana is good. It is traversed throughout by the imperial road leading from Lucknow to Sitapur, and different country roads from Bisw\u00e1n in Sitapur through Am\u00e1niganj, and from Kursi through Mahona lead into it. There is plenty of outlet for its produce, and the Lucknow market affords the best means of disposing of it.\n\nHence bazars are at a minimum, and the only considerable ones are at Itaunja and Am\u00e1niganj. This latter was a market-place founded by the pious king \u00c1sif-ud-daula, who, on his way to Rehar, to fight the Ruhelas, founded the Am\u00e1niganj in Malihabad, and on his return founded its namesake in Mahona. In the Naw\u00e1bi it was a place of more importance, being the highway of the traffic from Khairabad and Bisw\u00e1n in Sitapur to Lucknow and Fyzabad. But the traffic now passes along the new road.\n\nMahona is a place of no importance; it was formerly the headquarters of the pargana, where was placed a staff of Government officials for the assessment and collection of the revenue of the pargana, and where a fort was built for their protection. But the homestead of the village of Gobindpur bordered it, and the story goes, that on one occasion the Brahman proprietors of the latter village dug through the walls of the fort, and recovered a child that had been placed there as hostage for some revenue. After this the \u00e1mil took the fort to the more open village of Bah\u00e1durganj. Hence Mahona has for a long time ceased to have any importance as a pargana town.\n\nMari\u00e1on was at one time a place of importance; it formed the headquarters of a pargana of its own. The pargana of Mandigdon is mentioned in the \u00c1in-f-Akbari. It was here, too, that Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, the fifth Nawab of Oudh, fixed the old cantonments, where three regiments of Company's troops were quartered during the Nawabi.\n\nItaunja is chiefly known as the seat of the Panw\u00e1r R\u00e1ja, Jagmohan Singh, son of R\u00e1ja Ratan Singh, who holds one of the largest taluqas in the district.\n\nThe tenure in this pargana is in great part taluqdari, the two chief taluqdars being R\u00e1ja Jagmohan Singh and B\u00e1bu Pirthip\u00e1l Singh of the Panw\u00e1r tribe of Rajputs, and near of kin. These are the only two taluqdars indigenous to the pargana. The remaining chief families are the\nChauh\u00e1ns of Bhauli and of Magat, consisting of eight and twelve villages respectively, and the Chauh\u00e1ns of Kathw\u00e1ra of thirty-two villages. These and the Panw\u00e1r estates made up during the Nawabi the whole pargana which was then exclusively Rajput. The Panw\u00e1rs held what was popularly called eight tappas, but the formation of these tappas belongs to their family history. The traditions regarding the early history of the pargana say that the Panw\u00e1rs and the Chauhans entered the pargana almost simultaneously at about the end of the 14th century. By their family history it would seem that they came under the cognizance and sanction of the Delhi government.\n\nThe land was then owned and held by Kurmis, whose chiefs, R\u00e1e D\u00e1mar, dwelt at R\u00e1epur, a little to the west of Itaunja, and R\u00e1e Dhandu at Kathw\u00e1ra. There was a third, R\u00e1e Mohan, a Mur\u00e1o, who lived at Mahona, and gave his name to the town. All these had strong forts, whose sites are marked by the brick mounds called dh\u00e1s that still exist. But tradition adds that these forts were originally built by the Bhars whom the Kurmis succeeded. The Kurmis are said to have shown a mutinous spirit and kept back their revenue, and their chastisement was made over to these Panw\u00e1rs and Chauh\u00e1n tribes, who attacked and drove them out of the country.\n\nThese Kurmis do not seem to have been a low-caste tribe. They worshipped Mah\u00e1deo. In the village of Gadia, at the north of the pargana, he is still worshipped under the name of the Kurmi\u00e1ni N\u00e1th, and of late years a small shiw\u00e1la has been built over his image. And in the village of T\u00edka, to the south of Mahona, is a tank at which it is said the Kurmi widows used to perform their suttees.\n\nThe memory of these sacrifices does not very easily fade away. The place is hallowed, even though no monument marks the spot. A mound remains, and the native knows what is there. He will take off his shoes reverently, and will scrape away the earth and produce some ashes, which, after showing them to the curious inquirer, he will again carefully replace.\n\nThe pargana contains traces of mythical history which centre round Rukh\u00e1ra. R\u00fakha was the daughter of B\u00e1n\u00e1sur, who lived in M\u00e1mpur B\u00e1n\u00e1. It was she who fell in love with and abducted Anrudh, grandson of Srikrishn. Kubh\u00e1n, of Kumhr\u00e1wan, was one of his ministers, and it was his daughter, Chetori Lekha, who drew the likeness of the hero that R\u00fakha had seen in her dreams. Kesari Dait was another of his lieutenants, who founded Kesurm\u00e1u close to Mahona. Srikrishn, aided by Arjun, one of the P\u00e1ndu brothers, came with an army to recover his grandson, and the many-handed B\u00e1n\u00e1sur was vanquished and sent to worship Mah\u00e1deo on the lonely banks of the Nerbudda. As for R\u00fakha and Anrudh they married and went to live at Muttra Brind\u00e1ban. In Kumhr\u00e1wan there is an image of Mah\u00e1deo called Kursen, which it is said was the object of Kubh\u00e1n's worship.\n\nArjun founded the village of Arjunpur. There are in Arjunpur and Rukh\u00e1ra old mounds of considerable extent, with the usual broken bricks\nscattered about, and in the latter village is a shrine to Mah\u00e1deo, which has always been extensively worshipped; and of late years another temple, and a large Dharm\u00e1s\u00e1la and a well, have been built by Mathura D\u00e1s, the D\u00edv\u00e1n of Sharf-ud-daula, the converted Hindu; or, as some say, by the pervert himself, to avert some of the judgment he dreaded for his apostacy. Sharf-ud-daula was the great banker Jagann\u00e1th, who farmed the market dues of the province in the time of Muhammad Ali, and defaulting saved his life by changing his religion.\n\nAs already stated the pargana was almost entirely Rajput. At the present day, out of its one hundred and ninety-five villages, one hundred and thirty-two are held by these clans. The Panw\u00e1r taluqdars mentioned hold seventy-six. Some are held by a K\u00e1yath family who seem to have entered the pargana along with the Panw\u00e1rs. Before the late addition to it of part of Mari\u00e1on, the pargana was only composed of the eight Panw\u00e1r tappas.\n\nThey were\u2014\n\nI. The four Itaunja tappas of\u2014(1) Itaunja; (2) Kasr\u00e1w\u00e1n; (3) Bhindura; (4) Sonw\u00e1n.\nII. The Mahona tappas of\u2014(5) Mahona; (6) M\u00e1bga\u00f3n.\nIII. The two Rew\u00e1n tappas of\u2014(7) Rew\u00e1n; (8) Bah\u00edrg\u00e1on.\n\nOf these, the latter two are broken up. They became subdivided and are at present included in the district of Sitapur, still held by Panw\u00e1rs, who have extended their possessions northwards and hold considerable estates in that district. Some of the Bah\u00edrg\u00e1on villages were acquired by the owners of the four Itaunja tappas.\n\nThe pargana was one of those of Akbar's time. At annexation the old pargana of Mari\u00e1on was broken up, and part of it put into Lucknow and part into Mahona; the latter then became one of the three parganas that formed the Kursi tahsil. But on the transfer of the Kursi pargana to the district of Bara Banki, it was joined to the pargana of Malihabad, lying on the right bank of the river, and is now administered from the tahsil station of Malihabad. This is to the disadvantage of the people, who, during the rains, have to go round by Lucknow to get to Malihabad, but there are three gh\u00e1ts stationed along the river on the Malihabad side, at which the Government ferry boats ply.\n\nPargana families; R\u00e1ja Jagmohan Singh of R\u00e1epur; Itaunja-Panw\u00e1r.\u2014The ancestors of R\u00e1ja Jagmohan Singh are said to have come into this pargana some nineteen generations ago under R\u00e1o Deo Ridh R\u00e1\u00e9, the eighth son of R\u00e1ja Rudr\u00e1h of Dh\u00e1ranagar or Deogarh, The Khulds\u00e1 Taw\u00e1r\u00edch\u2014a history compiled by Suj\u00e1n R\u00e1c, K\u00e1yath, by the orders of Alamg\u00edr\u2014says that this was the site of Daulatabad which was founded by Muhammad Tughlaq in 758 Hijri (A.D. 1337), and it is probable that the Panw\u00e1rs were at this time driven out of their native seats. Deo Ridh R\u00e1\u00e9 took service with the king of Delhi, and obtained under him important commands. It is said that amongst other exploits he reduced the fort of D\u00edng. At this time the pargana was held by Kurmis and Mur\u00e1os, the former of whom were ruled by R\u00e1\u00e9 D\u00e1mar from his fort in R\u00e1epur,\u2014\nthe site of which may be still seen in the village, and the latter by R\u00e1e Mohan, who lived in what is now known as the town of Mahona. They may have been rebellious, or backward in paying their revenue. Deo Ridh R\u00e1e was sent to drive them out. This he seems to have effected partly by fraud, for his brother, R\u00e1in Singh, had preceded him and had taken service with the Kurmis, and in the subsequent attack he opened a gateway which admitted Deo Ridh R\u00e1e into the fort. The Kurmis were driven out and their country taken. Some few villages fell to R\u00e1in Singh, and his descendants are known as the Th\u00e1napati Panw\u00e1rs. The Panw\u00e1rs, however, do not seem to have come straight to the country they now hold. There is a tradition that the small tappa of Rah\u00edmabad, in the west of Malihabad, was once held by them, and there are the remains of a fort there which it is said was built by them. The tappa is now held by Salanki Rajputs and Shekhs, who seem also to have come from M\u00e1wa, the Panw\u00e1rs' country. The Shekhs say that they drove the Panw\u00e1rs out, but the more general belief is that the estate was conferred on them by the latter tribe. Deo Ridh R\u00e1e had three sons, D\u00edngar Deo\u2014perhaps so called from his father's exploits in the capture of Ding,\u2014Sahlan Deo, and Karan Deo. These three divided their father's possessions. The pargana is said to have been managed by Tilok Chand, q\u00e1n\u00fango, who had come with the invading force. The conquered tract was divided into eight tappas, four of which, called the Itsunja tappas, fell to D\u00edngar Deo, two, the Haweli tappas, to Sahlan Deo, and two, the Rew\u00e1n and Bah\u00edrg\u00e1o, to Karan Deo.\n\nR\u00e1e D\u00edngar Deo is ancestor of the present taluqdar, and was then made the r\u00e1ja of his house, which title has descended unbroken to the present time. Six generations after this, while M\u00e1dho Singh, the r\u00e1ja of the time, and the eldest son of S\u00faraj Sen, was at Delhi, As\u00fakh Mal, the second son, assumed the title and took the estate. M\u00e1dho Singh was content with this arrangement, and only reserved for himself six villages, which his descendants still hold. Three generations later came R\u00e1ja N\u00edri, who was a great hunter and athlete, and let his affairs fall into disorder. His brother, Bah\u00e1dur Singh, professed to look after the estate, but his revenue fell into arrears, and the Subahdar Diler Khan came against him, and in the fight that ensued both N\u00edri and Bah\u00e1dur were killed. There are two or three stories current about this. Some say that the r\u00e1ja had a bitter quarrel with R\u00fapn\u00e1r\u00e1s\u00edn, another of the sons of As\u00fakhmal, the r\u00e1ja's grandfather, and that it was only on his misrepresentations that the nawab came with a force against the r\u00e1ja.\n\nAnother story loves to recall the r\u00e1ja's far-famed strength and brave behaviour. It states that once on a visit to the emperor he came across the Nawab Diler Khan, who was a man of great stature and strength. Thrice he looked up and turned pale when he saw him, and thrice when he looked down and saw his own trusty sword he recovered himself and turned red. The emperor, who was observing him, noted this change of colour, and asked the r\u00e1ja what it meant, and the raja replied that when he saw the nawab he feared, but when he looked on his own sword he recovered his courage, and felt ready to fight him. The emperor consi-\ndered this a bold speech to make, and bade him go to his own country if he wanted to fight, and Diler would meet him there. So when the nawab came in the fight that has been mentioned, he called out from his elephant in a loud voice for the raja to come out and meet him in single combat. The raja was only mounted on a small horse, but he came up and struck at the nawab with a sword which shivered on his armour, and himself fell at one blow by a thrust from his adversary's spear. It is then said that one of R\u00e1p Nar\u00e1n's family admitted the nawab into the fort by a private door. This piece of treachery earned for himself and his descendants the sobriquet of the Khirkh\u00e1s or 'the men of the wicket,' by which they are distinguished to the present day. Events repeat themselves, and the Panwars may have thought of a former passage in the annals of their house, whereby in a similar way their forefathers obtained an entrance into the Kurmi's fort.\n\nMad\u00e1ri Singh, son of R\u00e1ja N\u00edri, however, attended at the emperor's court and was decked with a khilat (dress of honour), and recovered his father's estate. But he is said to have been a man of lawless habits and most inordinate pride. He was too good even to associate with his own kith and kin, and when the members of the Haweli and Rew\u00e1n branches came as usual to offer him their congratulations at the Holi festival, he refused to see them. Thereupon they took counsel and said that since they had no longer any natural head to look to, they must make one for themselves, and they went to R\u00e1e S\u00farat, of the second or Haweli branch, and elected him as raja. There is nothing else very eventful that happened to this family.\n\nIn the time of R\u00e1ja Shiu Singh in 1225 fa\u0161li (1818 A.D.), the whole taluqa was under direct management, and he was only left with ten muh\u00e1ls, which he held however in rent-free tenure as n\u00e1nk\u00e1r. The whole estate now consists of the original villages that the raja's family held. The family, with its branches, has always been very powerful. They were strong in themselves, and for the most part kept in good favour with the Delhi Court. They even adopt some of the Musalman practices\u2014such as fastening their coats to the left, and paying reverence to t\u00e1zias. And they have before their residence a large square stone which they hold in almost sacred reverence. They say that they brought it from Delhi, and that it is their symbol of right to their estates, which were granted to them by the Delhi emperor, who told them to take it as the foundation for their future settlement. Whenever a new raja succeeds he places on it a nazar (offering) of flowers and sweetmeats, and a few rupees.\n\nThere are a great many more villages belonging to the Panwars than the raja holds, which have been removed from the il\u00e1qa by different cadet members of the family. But the raja's estate itself consists of fifty-one villages as they have been demarcated by the recent survey, and has been assessed at 36,679.\n\nBabu Pirthip\u00e1l Singh of Mahg\u00e1on.\u2014B\u00e1bu Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l Singh, Taluqdar of Mahg\u00e1on, is of the same family as the R\u00e1ja of Itaunja, and received his two tappas of Haweli, at the time of the partition of the estate by the sons of Deo Ridh R\u00e1e. His immediate ancestor was Pahlan Deo, the second\nson of Deo Ridh R\u00e9\u00e9. Nine generations later came S\u00farat, son of R\u00e9\u00e9 Dalpat, when a great schism took place in the family, springing from the pride and overbearing behaviour of R\u00e9\u00e9 Mad\u00e1ri Singh of Itaunja of the elder branch. The circumstances have been mentioned in the history of that family. Up to this time the Haweli and Rew\u00e1n families had always acknowledged the leadership of this branch of the house, but now they resolved to elect a chief of their own. Accordingly they went to R\u00e9\u00e9 S\u00farat, the head of the second branch, and with the sanction of the authorities they made him r\u00e1ja. R\u00e9\u00e9 S\u00farat Singh made it the occasion for extending his dominions. He said he could not be r\u00e1ja without a raj to rule over, and he received from the Musalman chauthri of Kursi, who was glad enough to see some check likely to be put upon the power of the R\u00e9\u00e9ja of Itaunja, the four villages\u2014H\u00e1lupur and Rew\u00e1mau, Bidh\u00e1npur, and S\u00e1n\u00edpur,\u2014the two latter of which were renamed R\u00e9epur and R\u00e1japur, perhaps to commemorate the transition from r\u00e9\u00e9 to r\u00e1ja.\n\nNar\u00e1in, the son of R\u00e9\u00e9ja S\u00farat, had five sons. Keari, the eldest, inherited his title and estates, which descended for three generations till his line ended with Bhaw\u00e1ni and M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta, his two grandsons, who died without heirs. Then came a dispute for the succession. Four of the sons of R\u00e9\u00e9ja Nar\u00e1in had been by one wife, and the fifth, Bols\u00e1h, by another. Mardan Singh, descended from the fifth son, contended that one of the branches of the family had had their chance of the r\u00e1j, and that now it was the turn of the other. The two candidates were Bisr\u00e1m, fourth in descent from Khush\u00e1l, the fourth son of Nar\u00e1in, and Mardan, fourth in descent from Bols\u00e1h, the fifth son of Nar\u00e1in, by his second wife. But it happened that when they were all met in full assembly to have the case decided, and Balwant Singh, the brother of R\u00e9\u00e9ja Shiu Singh, of the elder branch, who had been sent to fix the tilak (a mark made on the forehead) on the successful claimant, called on the candidates to come down from the flat roof of the house where they were standing; that Bisr\u00e1m Singh effected the man\u0153uvre by jumping straight off the roof into the midst of them and got there first. Mardan came down by the ladder. Balwant and all present declared for the man who showed the promptness, and he was made the r\u00e1ja. Yet Mardan's family have always shown great energy and perseverance in amassing villages, and have got together an il\u00e1qa of 12\u00bd villages of their own; nor, when the settlement was made in the district, had they forgotten their old claim, and they made a bid for the whole taluqa.\n\nR\u00e9\u00e9ja Bisr\u00e1m was a determined and somewhat unscrupulous man. He managed to acquire several villages by standing security and taking them in default. On one occasion he refused to pay up his revenue, and was attacked in his fort of Umaria by the \u00c1mil P\u00e1thak Kundan L\u00e1l, and driven out and forced to keep in hiding for a year.\n\nHe was succeeded by his son Drigbijai, whose career has been an evil one. He took a leading part in the rebellion of 1856-57, and, though not actually concerned in, connived at the murder of Europeans, and after escaping for some years, was finally taken and sentenced to pass the rest of his days in the penal settlements across the seas. But his estate, much\nreduced by the settlement of 1264 fasil\u00ed (1856 A.D.), had been settled with his brother B\u00e1bu Prithip\u00e1l, who had judiciously come in, and his possession was not disturbed. He is now recognised as taluqdar, and holds twenty-three villages, which have been assessed at Rs. 15,981-4-0. But the resources of the estate as yet remain undeveloped; it contains a good deal of culturable jungle land that requires only to be broken up, and the b\u00e1bu has much cause to thank the leniency of the British Government that left him in possession of so fine a property.\n\nThe Chauh\u00e1ns of Kathw\u00e1ra.\u2014The Chauh\u00e1ns of Kathw\u00e1ra possess a small estate of eight villages situated on the banks of the Gumti at the south-west extremity of the pargana, and are said to have left their native town of Mainpuri under the leadership of Achhr\u00e1j and Bachhr\u00e1j, some thirteen generations ago. They appear to have entered the pargana at the same time as Panw\u00e1rs of Itaunja. This part of the country was also under Kurmi rule, and the Kurmi leader here was R\u00e1e Dh\u00e1ndu. The Chauh\u00e1ns have a similar story to the Panw\u00e1rs, that they effected their conquest by first sending a member of their family to take service with the native chief. R\u00e1e Dh\u00e1ndu was driven out, and Achhr\u00e1j settled in Kathw\u00e1ra taking eight villages, Bachhr\u00e1j in Magat receiving twelve.\n\nOld traditions surround the village of Kathw\u00e1ra. At the end of the Dw\u00e9par age, it is said to have been under the rule of a Dait Hansan Dhuj, who had seized the horse that Arjun had let loose during his horse sacrifice. The Dait was then attacked by Arjun and Pardum\u00e1n, son of Sr\u00edkrishn, and Birk Khet, son of R\u00e1ja Karan, and the place where their armies met has been called Katakhw\u00e1ra (Katak, an army) or Kathw\u00e1ra ever since. Hansan Dhuj is said to have had a large caldron which he kept filled with boiling oil, and he vowed he would throw into it any one of his army that lingered. But the youngest of his sons Sad\u00e1nand yielding to the entreaties of his wife stayed behind one more day. Thereupon the pitiless r\u00e1ja, placing his royal oath above the instincts of paternal love, consigned him to the boiling oil; guiltless, however, as he was of any wish to shirk the common peril, the oil turned cold, and he came out unharmed. Near Chandanpur, a hamlet of the village, on the east side of it is the place where this caldron was fixed, and to this day charcoal and ashes are dug upon the spot. Close to it is a small shrine dedicated to Debi Chandika. The Bhars are said to have succeeded to this race of demons, and the Kurmis to the Bhars. These Chauh\u00e1ns were a turbulent set of men, and were never quiet in the Nawabi. On one occasion they carried their depredations into the very city of Lucknow, and a large body of men were sent against them; but they kept out of the way till the matter had blown over, and then returned to their village. On another occasion, so late as 1258 fasil\u00ed (1851 A.D.), they refused to pay in their revenue, and had to be compelled by Kh\u00e1n Ali Khan, the Chakladar, with a body of the king's troops. They still hold their old villages.\n\nThe Chauh\u00e1ns of Magat.\u2014The history of this family of Chauh\u00e1ns of Magat is contained in that of Kathw\u00e1ra. After the expulsion of the Kurmis Bachhr\u00e1j received twelve villages, with Magat for his headquarters as his share of the conquest. It does not seem that his portion was\nthe greater, for the twelve villages do not cover a larger area. His descendants still hold eight of the villages. Some eighty years ago they lost Dinkarpur-Jhalawwa, which they had to give to the q\u00e1n\u00fangos of Mari\u00e1on as compensation for the murder by them of one of the family in office, who had recommended an increase of the revenue. Two other villages they sold or mortgaged, and one Jhurukpur they lost to a farmer.\n\nChauh\u00e1ns of Bhauli.\u2014The Chauh\u00e1ns of Bhauli, lying to the east of Kathw\u00e1ra, colonized thirty-two villages in the south-west of the pargana some eighteen generations ago. They entered the pargana under Kesri Singh, a Mainpuri Chauh\u00e1n of Kusambhar, probably at about the same time as the Kathw\u00e1ra Chauh\u00e1ns and the Panw\u00e1rs of Itaunja. They still hold all the villages they then colonized. It is said that on their arriving they found them all laid waste and deserted. The names of many of the villages certainly show that they were founded by the descendants of Kesri. Bhauli, as the story goes, was a deserted site from which the inhabitants had fled owing to the presence of a Brahman's spirit. Kesri had to lay this ghost, and ask permission to re-people the village. Hence the clan gets its name of R\u00e1kulas. Another legend says that Kesri was visited by a Brahman woman's spirit (churail), and that his descendants are all sprung from her. The story may be interpreted that Bhauli was some Brahman village, and that the Chauh\u00e1ns, attacked by some calamity when they seized it, attributed their misfortunes to the Brahman spirit, whose anger they had aroused by their unlicensed trespass on his domains. He at all events inspired sufficient dread to make them pay him honours which are observed up to the present time. In Pulaira, one of the villages, is a chab\u00fatra (platform) raised to a Baram R\u00e1kas, on which offerings are made on the last day of the month of Aghan, and the offerings are taken by the Brahmans of the place.\n\nMAHONA\u2014Pargana MAHONA\u2014Tahsil MALIHABAD\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014Mahona is situated two miles to the east of the Lucknow and Sitapur road, and is distant about fifteen miles from Lucknow. It was formerly the headquarters town of the pargana and the residence of the government officials, but the homestead of the village of Gobindpur adjoined it, and it is said that on one occasion the Brahman proprietors of the latter village broke into the Government fort and recovered a child that they had placed in hostage for some revenue. The \u00e1mil thereupon moved his fort to Bah\u00e1durganj, a short distance off. The place has for a long time in consequence ceased to be of any importance. The population is 3,594; but this includes the two villages of Gobindpur and Kesr\u00e1mau Kal\u00e1n which have been built on to it.\n\nNo Musalman families of any consequence have ever lived here. It belongs to a Panw\u00e1r taluqdar, B\u00e1bu Prith\u00edpal Singh, and it was conquered by his ancestors from R\u00e1e Mohan Mur\u00e1o, the reputed founder. There is a Government school here at which the attendance is from seventy to eighty. The amount of annual sales in the bazar is not large, amounting to Rs. 8,400, and neither manufactures nor trades flourish in any way.\n\nMAHARAJNAGAR*\u2014Pargana BISWAN\u2014Tahsil BISWAN\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Mahar\u00e1jnagar is 16 miles east of Sitapur, vid Bisw\u00e1n, the road\n\n* B. Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nfrom which place to L\u00e1harpur and Kheri passes through it. It has no other communications. It was founded by Musalmans, the exact date of their settling in it being unknown, and they called it Isl\u00e1m nagar. Five generations ago, R\u00e1ja Tej Singh, a Gaur Chhattari, and Naib Chakladar, seized it, and changed the name to Mahar\u00e1jnagar, and it is still held by the Gaurs. The population numbers 2,003, who reside in 364 mud and 8 masonry houses; they are principally Hindus. It has an old mosque, a shiwal\u00e1, a th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, and a masonry tank, built by a former banker, at which the festival of the R\u00e1m Lila is celebrated. The Government school affords instruction to 72 boys. At the bi-weekly bazar, besides the commodities usually sold at such places, good sugar may be bought; and cotton rope is also manufactured and sold here. The annual value of the bazar sales is put down at Rs. 5,000.\n\nMAIKALGANJ\u2014Pargana Aurangabad\u2014Tahsil Muhamdi\u2014District Kheri.\u2014A large village in pargana Aurangabad, district of Kheri, is situated on the right side of the road from Sitapur to Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, having a large tank to the east and a good encamping ground to the west. There is a mud-walled sarae and fifteen masonry wells. It was built by Ghulam Ali Khan, Darogha, in 1852. There is also a market containing 15 shops, built by Hak\u00edm Mehndi Ali Khan during his chakladarship, which lasted from A.D. 1799-1820.\n\nMaikalganj has a daily market, and a special one twice a week\u2014on Sundays and Thursdays. The annual average sale of European and native cotton fabrics and of salt in these markets is estimated at Rs. 4,000 and Rs. 2,500 respectively. It has eight sugar manufactories, which export annually sugar to the value of Rs. 12,000.\n\nThis place is not remarkable for any fair. It now belongs to an Ah\u00edr commonly residing therein.\n\n| Population 981. | Hindus | Males | 461 | Females | 421 |\n|----------------|--------|-------|-----|----------|-----|\n|                | Muslims | Males | 50  | Females | 49  |\n\nMAILA ALAM SAH\u2014Pargana Bangabmau\u2014Tahsil Safipur\u2014District Unao.\u2014A village 38 miles from the sadar station, Unao, lying in latitude 26\u00b056' north, and longitude 80\u00b015' east: the Ganges flows one mile south-west of it. The origin of the name of the village is ascribed to the brother of one Jagat Singh, a Gaur immigrant from Sitapur, who settled in this place about the time of Babar, and on his death his property was divided between his two sons, Alam Sah and Ram Kunwar, and hence the original village (Maila) has one part of it bearing the name of Maila Alam Sah, and the other Maila Ram Kunwar.\n\nThe soil is principally clay with some sand. It is built on a level plain, and has a good appearance. The climate healthy, and water good. No sarae, th\u00e1na, or tahsil here: nor is there any bazar in this village. There are two religious gatherings annually for bathing\u2014one in May (Jeth) and the other in October (K\u00e1tik). The gathering in both of these fairs amounts to 1,000. The sales in these fairs amount to about Rs. 482. The number of mud houses is 172.\n\n* By Mr. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nPopulation\u2014\n\n| Hindu   | Musalmans |\n|---------|-----------|\n|         |           |\n|         |           |\n\nTotal\n\nMAJHAURA* Pargana\u2014Tahsil Akbarpur\u2014District Fyzabad.\u2014It is affirmed that the majority of the lands at present included in the area of this pargana were formerly divided into four tappas as marginally noted.\n\nIt is said that during the Bhar period there were two brothers of that race named Bandhanp\u00e1l and Rachhp\u00e1l, who, it is believed, acknowledged and paid tribute to the Emperors of Delhi. The former of these brothers ruled over a territory which he named after himself pargana Bandhangarh. When the supremacy of the Bhars in these parts began to languish, some 500 years ago (in the days\u2014according to local belief\u2014of Ala-ud-din Ghori, A.D. 1156, which must be nonsense), an officer of the Delhi Court named Sayyad Manjhe was deputed to the charge of this part of the country. After completely suppressing the Bhars, and establishing his authority, he founded the town of Majhaura, to which he gave his own name, changing the name of the pargana to that also.\n\nThis pargana, for some generations before our rule, was known to contain 351 villages, of which 125 were asli (original), and 226 dakhili (suburban). In the last summary settlement these villages were recorded as 303 in number, and under the present settlement and demarcation operations they have been finally arranged as 164 villages. The area is 74 square miles, of which 43 are cultivated.\n\nThe pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Amsin, on the south by Sultanpur and Aldemau of the Sultanpur district, on the east by parganas Akbarpur and Aldemau, and on the west by Pachhimrath of this district. It is mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari as one of those included in Subah Allahabad, but which, with the rest of our southern parganas, was transferred to Subah Oudh.\n\nThe pargana is intersected by the small unnavigable rivers Madha and Biswi, which having their rise to the westward beyond its limits, and running eastwards unite at the village of Baizpur, which stands on the borders of this pargana and Akbarpur. The river thus formed at this spot, called Dohte or place of confluence, where it is always fordable except in the rains, thenceforward takes the name of Tonsa or Tons, on which stands the station of Azamgarh\u2014a river which is hallowed by associations in connection with R\u00e1mchandar; while of the spot Dohte we shall have more to note when treating of that shrine anon.\n\nTraces of the Bhar race, who have long been almost extinct in the pargana, are still to be seen in the following villages where mounds and masonry debris are all that are left to mark their former strongholds\u2014viz.,\n\n* By Mr. P. Carnegy, Commissioner.\nAsganw\u00e1n, Rachhp\u00edl, Parnanandpati-urf-Dahwa, Kawariserpal, Sagaicha, Naghi\u00e1wan, Idhona, Majhaura proper, Chand\u00e1pur, K\u00e1dipur Gaura, Tol\u00e1-pati-urf-Jaitpur.\n\nAfter the disappearance of the Bhars, the lands of the pargana appear to have been divided between two influential families of (1) Tew\u00e1ri Brahmans, and (2) Raut\u00e1r Rajputs, who are said to trace back their ancestors to the Bhar period. The possessions of the Brahman family were restricted to tappas Sikandarpur and Haweli; and for this reason these tappas were commonly known by the name of \"Taraf Banbhnauti,\" while the other two tappas, from being in the hands of the Raut\u00e1rs, were known as \"Taraf Rautar.\" The traditions of these two families, as related by themselves, are as follows:\n\nThe Tewaris.\u2014Rudau Tew\u00e1ri is said to have been a native of the Gorakhpur district (Sarw\u00e1r), who, about 600 years ago, was proceeding on a bathing pilgrimage to Allahabad. During his journey he rested at the village of Chand\u00e1pur, where then resided B\u00e1wan P\u00e1nd\u00e9, an influential agent of the Bhars, of whom mention has been made in the report of pargana Aldemau. The traveller was reported to be an accomplished astrologer, and he was therefore employed to tell the fortune of the P\u00e1nde, which in effect was that he would be struck down by lightning, unless he avoided this fate by undergoing a course of severe religious exercises. Tests having been successfully applied to the astrologer's veracity, his advice was followed by the happiest results; and for this good service in having turned the tide of the P\u00e1nde's destiny, lands were assigned to the Tew\u00e1ri in rent-free tenure, and he then founded and lived in the village of Rudaupur, giving to it his own name, which it to this day bears. Subsequent to these proceedings, when the Bhars began to decline, Rudau and his descendants adopted the then rising cause of the Muhammadians, and by their favour made considerable acquisitions in territory. He had six sons\u2014(1) Sewal, (2) Dharam, (3) Karan, (4) Dei, (5) Jaisaran, and (6) Maki. The two last of these died without issue, but of the other four there are offsprings to this day. According to the oldest records now existing, which are for the year (1197 fasli) A.D. 1790, the family held in that year eight estates (muh\u00e1ls) consisting of 60\u00bd villages, paying Rs. 7,350 as revenue to Government yearly. These Brahmans have, however, gradually lost power since about (1216 fasli) A.D. 1809, when their possessions began to be absorbed by other more powerful clans. In (1261 fasli) A.D. 1854, they had but one property of 3\u00bd villages, paying Rs. 500 per annum as revenue left, and this also became absorbed into the Meopur-Daharua taluqa in the following year; so that these Brahmans had lost all proprietary status ere the province was annexed. They still, however, exercise sub-proprietary rights in 26\u00bd villages, paying annual revenue to the amount of Rs. 3,700.\n\nThe Raut\u00e1rs.\u2014There is a bar sinister on the escutcheon of this family. The name of the common ancestor, a Brahman, who is said to have come\n\n* The term \"Banbhnauti,\" I may state, is a generic one, applied to these Tewaries alone, and not to the other families of Brahmans inhabiting this pargana.\nfrom Gorakhpur (Sarw\u00e1r) 600 years ago, and settled in the village of Mal\u00e1on-Sarayy\u00e1n, pargana Sultanpur, it is pretended is not known; and it is affirmed that a descendant of this person, whose name is also unknown, settled in the village of J\u00e1n\u00e1n in pargana Pachhimr\u00e1th, which soon expanded into a property of 15 villages. This individual is said to have encountered on the road the procession of an Ah\u00edr who was conveying home his bride, and to have forcibly appropriated to himself the latter, by whom he had a son, to whom was given the name of Deop\u00e1l Singh; and whereas influential Ah\u00edrs are not unusually honoured with the distinctive title of R\u00e1wat, therefore the offspring of this Brahman father and Ah\u00edr mother took to themselves the name of Raut\u00e1r* Rajputs, and they are now so far admitted into the orthodox Chhattiri families that their daughters are accepted in marriage by the sons of the latter.\n\nDeop\u00e1l Singh had two sons\u20141st, Jair\u00e1j R\u00e9\u00e9, and 2nd, Ubar R\u00e9\u00e9,\u2014and these from living in the village of Janan, close to the pargana border, gradually established a footing in it about the time of the decline of the Bhars. The offspring of these brothers spread largely, extending their possessions to other parganas besides this one, and we find from existing official records that in the year A.D. 1792 (1199 fasli), they then held 16 estates (muh\u00e1ls), consisting of 207 villages, paying an annual revenue to Government of Rs. 31,450. Their power, however, has somewhat declined since about A.D. 1802 (1209 fasli), when some of their possessions were first absorbed by men of greater influence; they still, however, have 13 properties consisting of 71\u00bd villages, and paying annually Rs. 9,015 to Government, while they further have sub-proprietary rights in 50\u00bd villages, the Government demand on which amounts to Rs. 10,150 per annum.\n\nIt will thus be seen that rights in the soil were possessed to a great extent by the two families described above, but there are other parties who are known to have exercised proprietary functions in the pargana for the last three or four centuries, and the details of their holdings at different periods are shown in the following table:\n\n| Caste                          | Villages in proprietary possession in the year | Villages now in sub-proprietary possession |\n|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n|                               | 1199 fasli (A.D. 1792)                        | 1866 fasli (A.D. 1859)                   |\n| 1.

His father, Shankar Singh, had a fifth son, Jabar Singh, to whom was allotted Samarthpur, and he was the father of the late taluqdar of that place, B\u00e1bu Maheshur Parsh\u00e1d Singh, whose widow, Thakur\u00e1in Hard\u00e1s Kunwar, now holds that taluqa.\n\nB\u00e1bu Bari\u00e1r Singh of Bhiti was in high favour with the famous Naz\u00edm, Raja Darshan Singh, and he lost no opportunity of increasing his power and possessions through that official\u2019s consideration and influence. We read in Sleeman\u2019s Journal of his being sent by the Naz\u00edm to attack the then rising Gargbansi clan under their notorious chief Nih\u00e1l Singh, and in the fight that followed the latter was slain. Bari\u00e1r Singh was, however, frequently called to account for not paying his revenue, and between the years 1212 and 1259 fasli (A.D. 1805-1852) his stronghold was on five different occasions besieged by the authorities, and resisted for periods ranging from seven to twenty-two days. Terms were always eventually made. Besides the occasion to which I have alluded, when Nih\u00e1l Singh was killed, the retainers of the B\u00e1bu love to dwell on the prowess exhibited by his gathering, when, with the aid of B\u00e1bu Udresh Singh, of Meopur Daharusa, they fought and vanquished R\u00e1ja Rustam S\u00e1h of Dera for the proprietorship of the village of Hech\u00fapur and others.\n\nThere is a peculiarity of tenure in this family under which the principal property, the Kurw\u00e1r R\u00e1j, descends undivided to the next heir, according to the law of primogeniture, while the lands of the junior\nbranches are subject to subdivision amongst the heirs. Under this rule, when B\u00e1bu Bari\u00e1r Singh of Bh\u00edti died, his property was divided between his two sons, the elder of whom is now the taluqdar, while the younger, B\u00e1bu Abhaidatt Singh, is taluqdar of Khajur\u00e1hat. I have a high opinion of both these brothers. B\u00e1bu Jai Datt Singh is much esteemed by his countrymen for his justice and uprightness; and he is readily accepted by them as a referee for the settlement of disputes. He is one of the few men of his class who lives within his income, and pays his revenue with punctuality. He is much appreciated as a landlord, and he has more idea of spending his money usefully than men of his class generally have. For instance, he has made an excellent raised and metalled road to connect his residence with the Government road, two miles off, and, in the course of this work, he has built a masonry drain-bridge and a large rough pile-bridge over the Mujwi, which last is really a considerable work to have been undertaken by him. It is the only bridge over this river within a space of 30 miles, and, as it is of public utility, it might, with advantage, be taken over and kept up by Government. I was surprised to find in his garden a walnut and a fir tree brought from Baddr\u00edn\u00e1th by him ten years ago, when he went on a pilgrimage to that holy shrine; besides many good fruit trees brought from Benares, Lucknow, and other distant places. It is so rare to see these gentlemen taking an interest in so rational an amusement as gardening, that my visit to Bh\u00edti really afforded me much pleasure.\n\nThe population is 45,202, being at the rate of 611 to the square mile. The population is nearly entirely agricultural, and its condition is equal to about the average of people of this class.* About 60 per cent. of the houses are tiled, and there are no masonry buildings. The only mah\u00e1jan or banker is Ghirau S\u00e1h of R\u00e1eganj, whose annual transactions in the neighbourhood do not exceed from two to three thousand rupees. There are only three paltry bazars\u2014viz., S\u00e1tinpur, Dharamganj, and Ahrauli,\u2014none of which are inhabited by more than 200 persons. The trade of the pargana consists of about Rs. 9,000 worth of cotton, piece-goods, thread, and spices imported from Fyzabad and other surrounding towns, and about Rs. 7,000 worth of country-made cloth, grain, and gur exported to Fyzabad and Jaunpur. Indigo and cotton are not grown, but over 800 acres are under sugarcane, from which 8,000 maunds of gur (molasses) are annually made, which would be equal to 2,000 maunds of soft sugar, but that sugar is not manufactured here. There is nearly 100 acres of land under poppy, which yields an average of 6\u00bd sers of opium per acre. The outturn of wool is estimated at 15 maunds only, and of patua (hemp) fibre for rope at 100 maunds. The prevailing soils are as in pargana Aldemau\u2014viz., 1st class, dur\u00e1s (loam), 2nd, matiy\u00e1r (clay), 3rd, balva (sand). The rabi is the superior harvest in the proportion of 10 to 6.\n\nShrines and fairs.\u2014Mah\u00e1deo Parudewa.\u2014On the 13th of every Ph\u00e1gun, which day is known as the Sh\u00edur\u00e1ttiri, or anniversary of Mah\u00e1deo\u2019s marriage, a fair is here held, to which the villagers, to the number of 2,000, inhabiting the country within 16 miles, annually resort for the day. No merchandise is exposed for sale. A smaller gathering is also held on the 13th\nof each month. This particular representation of Mah\u00e1deo takes its name from the village in which it is placed.\n\nDohte.\u2014Allusion has already been made to this shrine in describing the junction of the rivers Madha and Biswi. On the 30th of Aghan a fair is annually held, which is attended by five or six thousand persons inhabiting the country within 12 miles. Here stands a small earthen mound in the water, which is sanctified as being the spot, according to local tradition, where Sarwan, the revered, the blind hermit's son, immortalized in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, offered up his prayers, not long before he accidentally met his death in a neighbouring pargana at the hands of king Dasrath, father of R\u00e1ma.\n\nIt is part of the ceremony gone through while bathing at the confluence of these rivers to place a handful of mud on the abovementioned chab\u00fatra or mound, and in this way it is kept up, or rather annually restored, for it is submerged during the rains.\n\nT\u00e1lab Amoghe.\u2014This lake is in the neighbourhood of the B\u00e1l\u00e1-Paikduli jungle, and it is affirmed that a century and a quarter ago, R\u00e1mparsh\u00e1d, a well reputed Bair\u00e1gi of Ajodhya, of whom mention has been made in the Aldemau report, visited this spot, and pointed out that it was here that Nasket, son of Ud\u00e1luk-m\u00fan, a great divine, used to offer up his prayers; and ever since this discovery was made, a bathing fair has been held twice a year, on the same days as the Ajodhya fairs (the last day of K\u00e1rtik, and the 24th of Chait). Three or four thousand persons of the neighbourhood assemble for the day, but no trade is carried on.\n\nThe Bh\u00edti Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra.\u2014The village of Bh\u00edti, where resides the taluqdar of that ilk, is situated on the banks of the Biswi, and here the B\u00e1bu built this th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra some 15 years ago, at which a fair is held twice a year, in Chait and Kuw\u00e1r, which is visited for the day only by 2,000 persons of the immediate vicinity. Cloth and brass vessels are brought for sale.\n\nSankhb\u00edr.\u2014It is affirmed that about 500 years ago a (Bamhnauti) Brahman of this pargana was in prison, under the orders of the emperor of Delhi. The demon of the place appeared to the prisoner in a dream, and promised him his release if he would take the said demon with him, and establish him in his own country. The release was effected on these terms, and the evil spirit, in the shape of an idol of mud, was duly conveyed to the Brahman's house. Then the latter had a second dream in the course of which the demon desired to be placed in the village of Sakhona, and that his name might be Sankhb\u00edr. His wishes were obeyed, and fairs are still held to his immortal fame on every Tuesday in the months of As\u00e1rh and S\u00e1wan, which are attended by a thousand persons of the neighbourhood. There is also a smaller gathering every Tuesday throughout the year.\n\nThe Government revenue is Rs. 57,301, being at the rate of Re. 1-8-7 per arable acre.\nMAKHI\u2014Pargana ASIYAN RASULABAD\u2014Tahsil MOHAN\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Lies 14 miles south-west of tahsil headquarters, and 8 miles north of the sadr station; two unmetalled roads form the line of intercourse between this village and Unao. It was founded about 1,000 years ago by one Makhi, a Lodh, who named it after himself. The soil is loam; the surface is not level; there are groves of mango trees. Scenery only middling; water in some places fresh, at others brackish. Some 400 years ago one Raja Isri Singh came here from Mainpuri and took possession of the place after the Lodhs had been extirpated; his descendants still own the place.\n\nIn the month of September-October (Ku\u00e1r), there is the fair of Ramfla; it lasts only one day, and one or two thousand people assemble on the occasion. There are two markets weekly at which cloths, vegetables, &c., are sold. The usual earthenware and some silver ornaments are made here. The population amounts to 4,513\u2014Muslims being only 134. Chhatris number 911 and Brahmins 891. There are 1,023 mud-built houses, and two temples\u2014one dedicated to Debi and one to Mah\u00e1deo. Sales at bazars and the fair amount to Rs. 2,720.\n\nMALAKA RAZZAQPUR\u2014Pargana BIHAR\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARATGARH.\u2014In 1039 A.D., two Muslim colonists, Malik Ata and Abdur Razzaq founded this village; their descendants are still found in it. The road from Bihar to the Ganges (which is two miles off), and to the railway station at Bharwari pass by this village. In 1802 Ghul\u00e1m Husen was appointed Master of the Horse (Darogha Astabal) to Nawab Safat Ali Khan, and he was steward of the household of Ghazi-ud-din Haidar. He amassed great property, and built many fine buildings in this his native place besides Husenganj, Katganj, Khayaliganj, Farangi Muballa, in Lucknow. On the accession of Nasir-ud-din Haidar in 1237 all his property was seized. He himself fled to Allahabad; his descendant now resides in a hut near his ancestor\u2019s palace, which has been taken possession of by the Bisen taluqdar of Kundrajit. He also built two masonry bridges, one over the Sai near Bahadurpur, the other over the Dorka. The population is 420 Hindus; 132 Muslims; total 552.\n\nMALAUNA\u2014Pargana PANHAN\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Is about 9 miles south of the tahsil and 24 east of the sadr station of Unao. An unmetalled road leading to Purwa from Bihar passes through this village, and the Lon waters it running one mile to the north. Some 700 years ago one Malik Singh, Thakur, founded this village, and gave it the name of Malaua. It is on level ground, climate healthy, and water good, but some wells are brackish. Few groves and no jungle. Excepting carpentry there is scarcely any handicraft. There are 225 mud-built houses. The total population amounts to 1,251. Hindus number 1,245, and Muhammadans only 6.\n\nMALIHABAD Pargana\u2014Tahsil MALIHABAD\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The Malihabad pargana lies at the north-west corner of the district. On its\n\n* By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\neast it is separated from Mahona, its fellow pargana of the tahsil of Mali-\nhabad, by the Gumti and by the pargana of Lucknow, which runs a long\nspur straight into its centre. On its south and east it is bounded by the\nparganas of K\u00e1kori and Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s (of Unao), and on its north by the\ndistrict of Hardoi. But for the insertion of the corner from pargana Luck-\nnow, it would be nearly square, averaging 10 miles in length and breadth,\nbut narrower at the south end than the north. It is enclosed between 26\u00b074'\nand 27\u00b016' latitude and 80\u00b085' and 80\u00b045' longitude. Its area is 187 square\nmiles, and it contains 188 villages, with an average area of 336 acres.\n\nIts population is 873,136 or 413 to the square mile. Of this 16\u00b77 per\ncent. is Musalman, 83\u00b73 per cent. Hindu, 52\u00b70 per cent. agricultural, and 48\u00b70\nper cent. non-agricultural.\n\nIn communications it has a road running from Sand\u00edla south-east through\nMalihabad to Lucknow, and another running south from the north end of\nthe pargana through Malihabad to Moh\u00e1n of the Unao district, and so on\npast the railway station of Harauni to Bani Bridge on the Cawnpore road.\nFor communication with Mahona, its sister pargana, it has the road leading\nto the north of the pargana which branches off at M\u00e1l in a north-easterly\ndirection, and crosses the river at Bis\u00e1righ\u00e1t, a couple of miles north of the\nlarge village of Kathw\u00e1ra on the Mahona side of the river. A Government\nferry boat plies here. Its largest towns are Malihabad and Kasmandi-\nkal\u00e1n. The latter, a place of considerable importance, was in ancient times\nthe chief town in the country, and the seat of a R\u00e1ja Kans, who, tradition\nsays, was driven out by the first Muhammadan invasion under Sayyad\nMasa\u00fad. It seems certain, as will be afterwards seen, that it was early\noccupied by the Muhammadans, but it is doubtful if it lay in the track of\nSayyad Masa\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi. Malihabad, however, one of the largest towns in the\nneighbourhood, has for a long time been the headquarters of the pargana,\nand the centre of Muhammadan colonization. It seems to have fallen\ninto Musalman hands at a later date than Kasmandi-kal\u00e1n, and was proba-\nbly colonized by Path\u00e1ns. It is said to have been the chief seat of the\nArakhs or P\u00e1s\u00eds, and to have been founded by Malia P\u00e1si, whose brother\nSalia founded Sand\u00edla in Hardoi. Even under the rule of this tribe it\nmust have been a place of considerable importance. The P\u00e1si had power\nand independence enough to have a mint here, and to this day coin of his\ntime is said to be occasionally dug up, giving it thereby the name in native\ntraditions of the Khonta Sh\u00e1har, \"the city of the bad money.\"\n\nThe population of Malihabad is 8,026. Attached to Malihabad is Mir-\nz\u00e1ganj, which was founded by Mirza Hasan Beg, a native of the neigh-\nbourhood. The largest bazar in the neighbourhood is held here. The other\nbazars are held at Am\u00e1n\u00edganj on the road to P\u00edpalg\u00e1on, and at Rah\u00edmabad\non the road to Sand\u00edla, situated at the junction of this road, with a road\nfrom Aur\u00e1s, a village of the neighbouring pargana of Moh\u00e1n-Aur\u00e1s lying\nsouth-west in the Unao district. Besides Malihabad there are no towns\nwith a population of more than 2,000, though there are sixteen other large\nvillages with a population of between 1,000 and 2,000. They are Bakhti\u00e1r-\nnagar, Kh\u00e1lispur, Garhi-Sanjar-Khan, Rusena, Sasp\u00e1n, G\u00e1hdeo, Maw\u00e1i-\nkal\u00e1n, Gonda, Khar\u00e1nw\u00e1n, Kasmandi-kal\u00e1n, and Kasmandi-khurd, Tharri,\nN\u00e1bipan\u00e1h, M\u00e1l, Badari\u00e1n, and Antgarhi.\nGovernment schools are held at the largest of these at Malihabad, Mirzaganj, Kenwalh\u00e1r, Kh\u00e1lispur, Rah\u00edmb\u00e1d, and M\u00e1l. At Malihabad are fixed the tahsil, post, and registration offices, and the police station, where is stationed a force of one inspector and twenty-four subordinates. The area in their charge is not quite conterminous with the pargana, for it includes also the corner of Lucknow that penetrates into the pargana, and part of K\u00e1kori. It amounts to two hundred and twenty square miles.\n\nThe pargana is well wooded and generally very well cultivated. But it is crossed by large waste and unculturable tracts that follow the course of the Baita and two other small streams, called the Jhandi and Akrahdi, which take a south-easterly direction through the pargana and fall into the river Gumti. But little irrigation is carried on from them. The irrigation in the pargana is hardly up to average. It amounts to only thirty-four per cent. and nearly forty per cent. of this is from wells. But water is generally procurable if wells be dug. It can be found at an average depth of eighteen feet from the surface of the soil, and a depth of twelve feet of water can be secured.\n\nIn general fertility it is perhaps one of the best parganas of the district, and while its percentage of cultivation is higher than in any other pargana its density in population is least. It has also very little unculturable land. It amounts only to 13\u00b792 per cent., half of which is taken up by homesteads, roads, and tanks. The culturable land amounts to 26\u00b75 per cent., and some of it is of a very good quality.\n\nThe population falls on the cultivated area at the rate of 786 per square mile, showing a vast difference between this and the Lucknow and Mohanlalganj parganas, where it falls at a rate of 1,229 and 1,003 per square mile. The holdings of cultivators in the pargana are in consequence much larger. For the Brahmans, Chhattirs, and Ahirs, who furnish the greater part of the cultivators, they vary from four and three-quarters to five and three-quarters of an acre, and for the Chamars they are from three and a half to three and three-quarters of an acre. The rents are very low and uniform; they range from Rs. 3-11 to 4-1, the latter being paid by Chamars. K\u00e1chhis pay Rs. 6-1, not half of what they pay in Lucknow and Mohanlalganj. The assessment of the pargana was by the summary settlement Rs. 1,18,644. By the revised demand it is Rs. 1,52,595, revenue rate falls at Rs. 2-2 on cultivated, Re. 1-8 on cultivated and culturable, and Re. 1-4 throughout.\n\nThe early history of the pargana has been indicated. It is said to have been inhabited by P\u00e1s\u00eds and \u00c1rakhs. Two P\u00e1s\u00ed brothers, Malia and Salia, are said to have founded Malihabad and Sand\u00edla in Hardoi. Local tradition says that Malia was not driven out till the time of Akbar, but this must be a mistake. Munshi Fazl Ras\u00fal, taluqdar of Jal\u00e1lipur in Hardoi, asserts that his ancestors drove out a tribe of \u00c1rakhs from Sand\u00edla in 602 Hijri (A.D. 1205), and pursued them through K\u00e1kori to Lucknow. Path\u00e1ns have long been celebrated as very powerful in Malihabad, and outside Malihabad is the old village of Bakht\u00ed\u00e1rnagar, still held by a colony of Path\u00e1ns\u2014though of another and more recent date\u2014which very probably\nowed its foundation to Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji, who, we know, invaded Oudh in 599 Hijri (A.D. 1202). Muhammad Bakhtiar Khilji was, as his name would indicate, a Pathan, and from his time must date the Muhammadan settlement in Malihabad.\n\nIt is not impossible, however, but that there was some earlier Musalman invasion. It is said that at one time very many of the inhabitants and owners of the soil became converted to Muhammadanism, and this tradition is believed by the present population, who make no difficulty in declaring that the numerous mounds scattered over the face of the pargana belonged to a Jhojha sect. These village sites do not differ from the Bhar dihs that exist in other parganas; they rise conspicuously above the surrounding level, and consist of masses of broken bricks. They are now quite deserted. The natives say they were forts; they are chiefly to be found in Antgarhi, Mal, P\u00e1ra, Sisw\u00e1ra, and Dilawarnagar, but they can everywhere be seen.\n\nIf these Jhojhas were converted P\u00e1sis or Bhars they were afterwards cruelly abandoned by their fierce proselytizers, for the pargana was subsequently overrun by the Rajput tribes of Gahilw\u00e1rs, Bamhan-Gaurs, Nikumbhs, Gautams, and Janw\u00e1rs; but, on the other hand, the traditions of these new invaders of the soil assert that the country was inhabited by \u00c1rakhs tribes, whom they attacked and drove out.\n\nThe pargana seems after this to have been entirely held by Rajputs, their settlements date probably from the thirteenth century, or about the time of their dispossession on the Muhammadan conquest of their ancient kingdoms and consequent search for new homes. They held the tappas of Gahiw\u00e1ra, Dakhl\u00e1wal, Sisw\u00e1ra, Katauli-R\u00e1o, Khar\u00e1w\u00e1n and Rahimabad. They all exist to the present day, but have suffered in their turn by three or four different colonies of Path\u00e1ns, who came into the country at about the middle of the seventeenth century, and secured estates of from ten to twelve villages each round Malihabad. These Path\u00e1ns are of Afridi, B\u00e1zad Khail and Qandh\u00e1ri clans. They have but little connection with each other, or with the original Path\u00e1n families of the old encamped settlement, though doubtless it was tidings of them that attracted the later adventurers. Of the Afridi Path\u00e1ns are the taluqdars Ahmad Khan and Nas\u00edm Khan of Kasmandi Khurd, Sahlamau; and different members of the \u00c1mn\u00e1zai family rose to great distinction both under the Delhi empire and the dynasty of Oudh. All traces of the original invasion, however, have not disappeared. Kasmandi kal\u00e1n and the group of villages round are held by Shekhs, who assert that they are descended from the leaders of the expedition; though it is said of them, on the other hand, that they are no more than converted Hindus. The census will show how great an element of truth must lie in the tradition of an early Hindu conversion. Though, as related, it was at one time colonised entirely by Rajput tribes, excepting only the group of villages round Kasmandi kal\u00e1n, yet the percentage of Musalmans on the whole population is 16-7\u2014a percentage only exceeded or approached in the parganas of K\u00e1kori and Mahona, where like influences seem to have prevailed.\nThe Rajput clans will find hereafter a fuller mention in the histories of the pargana families. Many of their villages have fallen into the hands of the Path\u00e1n taluqdars, Ahmad and Nas\u00edm Khan; but they still hold seventy-six. Taluqdars hold fifty-three, of which thirty-six belong to the taluqdars already mentioned. The rest are held chiefly by Maghal and Path\u00e1n communities, and a few still remain with some Brahman families and some of the lower Hindu castes. There are one hundred and eighty-eight villages in all. The taluqdars are\u2014Nas\u00edm Khan (Path\u00e1n), of Sahl\u00e1mau, Ahmad Khan (Path\u00e1n), of Kasmandi-Khurd; Makrand Singh (Panw\u00e1r), of Kaituria; Thakur Srip\u00e1l (Bais), of Baraura; but the latter properly belongs to Hardoi; R\u00e9ja Randh\u00ed Singh (Bais), who holds only three villages in tappa Dakl\u00e1wal, and also belongs to Hardoi; and Chaudhri Hashmat Ali, of Sand\u00edla, who only holds one village by mortgage. The only two taluqdars who belong to the pargana are Nasim Khan and Ahmad Khan, who hold large estates assessed at Rs. 16,000 and 13,000, which they have however acquired by transfer in recent times. The pargana was of old made up of the tappas already mentioned; it was one of those mentioned in the Ain-i-Akbari, and was during the Nawabi included in the Chakla of Sand\u00edla.\n\nPargana families.\u2014Ahmad Khan and Nas\u00edm Khan, Taluqd\u00e1rs of Kasmandi-Khurd and Sahlamau, are two brothers, sons of Faq\u00edr Muhammad Khan, an Afridi Path\u00e1n of Rohilkhand. The latter came to Malihabad in the time of the Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, and was granted a piece of land for a house and grove in Kenwal-h\u00e1r of the Qasba, by Mak\u00e1rim Khan, Amn\u00e1zai Path\u00e1n of Bakhtiarnagar. He then took service in the Qandh\u00e1ri horse, a regiment of the Nawab's that was commanded by Abd-ur-Rahm\u00e1n Khan, Path\u00e1n, of Kh\u00e1lispur. He shortly threw this up and joined the Pind\u00e1ri leader, Amir Khan.\n\nIn his service he rose, and when the Pind\u00e1ri wanted an envoy to send to the Oudh Nawab, Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, he fixed upon Faq\u00edr Muhammad Khan, and gave him an elephant and Rs. 6,000 for his road expenses. On reaching Cawnpore he heard of the death of the Nawab, and changed his route for his old home in Malihabad. He then got an introduction to \u00c1gh\u00e1 M\u00edr, Minister of Ghazi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar, and got a place about the Court on the pay of Rs. 150 a month; and eleven saw\u00e1rs were put under him. This became the nucleus of a regiment which he recruited from his countrymen in Malihabad. In 1235-36 fasli (1827 A.D.) he was granted the lease of the Malihabad pargana by the Amils, Gobardhan D\u00e1s and Param Dhan. And he held the pargana on different occasions from them till 1250 fasli (1843 A.D.), picking up several villages whose owners had defaulted. He got a lien on others, and in this way founded an estate which became known as that of Tharri Fatehnagar. In 1257 fasli (A.D. 1850) he died, and the two sons succeeded to the estate, which they divided. Ahmad Khan's was called Kasmandi-Khurd, and is assessed at Rs. 16,371; Nas\u00edm Khan's was Sahl\u00e1mau, and is assessed at Rs. 16,017.\n\nThe Amn\u00e1zai Path\u00e1ns of Garhi Sanjar Khan and Bakhtiarnagar\u2014two villages close to Malihabad\u2014were amongst the first of the Path\u00e1n families, who, subsequent to the Path\u00e1n settlement of earlier times, again entered\nthe district. Under the Delhi emperors they rose to a pitch of great wealth and prosperity, and they love to talk over and chronicle the deeds of the former members of their family. They settled here under the auspices of Diler Khan in 1076 Hijri (A.D. 1656) in the reign of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n. He seems to have been one of the S\u00e1b\u0101dars of Oudh. The family talks of him as such, and outside the towns is a dome-shaped tomb, said to be that of the Nawab Diler Khan. He was the son of that Daria Khan who was the companion of Khan Jah\u00e1n, Lodi, in his rebellion of the first days of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n's reign. Touching their share in this rebellion, the Path\u00e1ns have a tragic story to relate. Daria Khan could not see without bitter sorrow the ruin that had fallen on himself and family, and thinking only to save his name and stock from perishing, he addressed his two sons, and bidding them take his head after his death to the emperor and save themselves. He placed his seal within his mouth and slew himself. His sons executed his commands, but as they were bearing the head before the emperor, one of the hungry adventurers about the court claimed the merit of having slain the Path\u00e1n rebel. Thereupon they pointed to the seal still within the dead man's mouth, and their mendacious opponent was silenced.\n\nThe sons were after this received into favour. Bah\u00e1dur Khan was appointed to K\u00e1bul, and Diler Khan, otherwise Jal\u00e1l Khan, received Oudh. But previously to separating, the brothers founded Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1np\u00far in Rohilkhand, and Diler Khan moving on to his province first founded Shahabad in Hardoi, and finally fixed his headquarters at Malihabad, attracted to this place, perhaps, by his Path\u00e1n fellow-countrymen already living there. Some more incidents relating to his life will be found in the account of the Panw\u00e1r family of Itaunja Mahona.\n\nAll this time he had been followed by Kam\u00e1l Khan and Bah\u00e1dur Khan, the ancestors of the present family, whose father, Diw\u00e1n Muhammad Khan, had been invited to Hindustan from Banair near Peshawar by the Daria Khan already mentioned. They first settled in Hasanpur-b\u00e1ri in 1015 Hijri (1615 A.D.). But they can still point to houses and groves which they owned during their short stay with Diler Khan in Shahabad. In 1076 Hijri (1656 A.D.) they reached Malihabad and settled in Ahma, a village of Bul\u00e1qinagar.\n\nIn 1105 Hijri (1693 A.D.), Sarmast Khan, son of Bah\u00e1dur Khan, separated, and removed to Bakht\u00ed\u00e1rnagar, a short distance to the south of Malihabad. Sanjar Khan, the son of Kam\u00e1l Khan, remained in Bulaqinagar, and changed its name to that of Garhi Sarjar Khan. But Dil\u00e1war Khan, the son of Sarmast Khan, is the hero of the family, and raised it to its greatest prosperity. He took service under the emperor, was made a Mansabdar by Farrukh-siar, and, signalizing himself by many acts of bravery, was rewarded with the title of Nawab Shamsher Khan. An instance of his bravery is cherished. It is said that as he was marching with the Sayyads of B\u00e1raha to raise Farrukh-siar to the throne, the future emperor remarked,\u2014\"It is all very well when I conquer, but is there any one now that dare use my land measure and money?\" Dil\u00e1war Khan stepped forward, and said that he dared, and he went into Oudh and used\nFarrukh-siar's land measure, and money coined in his name. He annexed an estate amounting to upwards of a hundred villages, and the same sovereign conferred on him a j\u00e1g\u00edr of three lakhs of rupees, which he shared with another general (Nas\u00edm Khan).\n\nBut in the time of Safdar Jang, this family fell into disgrace. Whilst the Nawab Wazir was in Delhi, Ahmad Khan Bangash, of Farukhabad, made an attack upon his dominions, and was encamped on the Cawnpore side of the Ganges. The Nawab's lieutenant went to meet him, and Mak\u00e1rim Khan, a son of Shamsher Khan, dutifully attended with his contingent, but his nephew Dil\u00e1war Khan had quarrelled with him, and had crossed the river to the enemy. The Nawab's troops finally fell back and retreated to Fyzabad, but for some reason, or other\u2014probably from distrust of his Path\u00e1n contingent\u2014left Mak\u00e1rim Khan on the banks of the Ganges to watch the troops of the Bangash. Mak\u00e1rim Khan seeing that he was likely to come to no good between these two parties fled to Rohilkhand, and his j\u00e1g\u00edr was confiscated. A few villages were afterwards restored to him through the intervention of H\u00e1fiz Rahmat Khan, the Ruhela Chief, who at that time lived on terms of great amity with Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula. Amongst them was Bakhtiarnagar, which he received in j\u00e1g\u00edr for the pay of his regiment of Path\u00e1n horse, that he was sent to command at Gorakhpur. This he holds free to the present day. It was at about this time also that the family granted a bit of land of the Qasba called Kenwal-h\u00e1r to Faq\u00edr Muhammad Khan, an Afridi Pathan, father of the future Taluqdas, Ahmad Khan and Nas\u00edm Khan. Iradat Ali Khan and Ibr\u00e1him Ali Khan, grandsons of Abdul Makarim Khan, did good service in the mutiny, and were rewarded by a grant of the village of Kursat in Hardoi, but they have since sold it. Besides Bakhtiarnagar they now only possess three other villages\u2014Basrela, Jaml\u00e1pur, and Bhatau. The Garhi Sanjar branch hold that village on mu\u00e1fi (rent-free) tenure, and some five others.\n\nThe next Path\u00e1ns that came were the Bazad Khails of Bari-Garhi, who hold eight villages close to Malihabad on the west. They also came from Hasanpur-Bari, some seven generations ago, led by their ancestors, Shekh Ibr\u00e1him, who is said to have been a Mansabd\u00e1r in the Dehli emperor's service.\n\nThe first settled in the Ahma village of Habsipur Nasiamaau, and are said to have bought their remaining villages from their Shekh proprietors of Kasmandi-kal\u00e1n and Sahlamau.\n\nThe settlement of the family of Qandh\u00e1ri Pathans in the pargana is recent. Yusaf Khan, the father of Abd-ur-Rahman Khan, came in the province as an adventurer in the time of the Nawab Shuja-ud-daula (1753 A.D.), and settled in Khairabad. Subsequently his son performed good service in a contingent supplied by the Nawab for the use of the English Government, and was granted twelve villages in j\u00e1g\u00edr, the chief of which was Kh\u00e1lispur.\n\nThis and twenty-five other villages had belonged to the P\u00edrz\u00e1da Sh\u00e1h Madan P\u00edr, and had been granted to him in mu\u00e1fi tenure by the\nEmperor of Delhi, but were angrily confiscated by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula on witnessing the saint's grief at the sight of the head of the Ruhela chief, H\u00e1fi\u1e93 Rahmat Khan. The latter had been a disciple of the p\u00edr's, and when, after his defeat and fall, his head was brought before the Naw\u00e1b, and no one recognized it, some one suggested that the p\u00edr would know, and he was called. The p\u00edr on beholding it at once recognized the head, and bursting into tears shared the ruin that had befallen his friend.\n\nThe tribe of Gahilw\u00e1rs of M\u00e1l (Gotr Bach) inhabit fifty-five villages towards the north-east of the pargana, and are said to have migrated here under R\u00e1e Paitaw\u00e1n Singh from Manda-Bijeipur, near Benares. The r\u00e1e was the brother of the r\u0101ja of that country, whose seat of power was originally Benares, but giving this city in shankalp (a religious gift) to the Brahmans he retired to Manda-Bijeipur.\n\nR\u00e1e Paitaw\u00e1n went on a pilgrimage to N\u00edmkh\u00e1r Misrikh to bathe, and rested in the village now known as Paitauna. Striking his tents and pursuing his journey his attendants forgot to pull up a peg of one of his tents. But it happened that the r\u00e1e returned from his pilgrimage by the same way; and halting at the same place his eye fell upon the peg, and he saw that it had sprouted. He looked upon this as an omen of good fortune, and an invitation to settle in the country. He continued his journey, but soon returned and took service with the Jhojh\u00e1 tribe, who were then masters of the country. They are said to have been old Musalman converts from the Hindu faith, and the part of the country they lived in was called the tappa Ratau. They had two large forts\u2014one in M\u00e1l and the other in Ant. In the latter there is an enormous well at which four pairs of bullocks can work at a time called a chaupura well, which is said to have been built by them, and there is an old wall reaching from M\u00e1l to Amlauli, the foundations of which still crop out of the ground here and there, which is attributed to them. It seems probable that this Jhojh\u00e1 tribe were once the aboriginal Bhars who, with no leaders of their own, after the invasion and defeat of their R\u00e1ja Kans, of Kansmandi, by Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, yielded to the threats of the Musalmans, and embraced their faith. This is the only way of accounting for them. They are the last people that remain in tradition, and no other Musalman invasion taking the form of a crescentade is known.\n\nAny way the Gahilw\u00e1rs made themselves masters of their country, and became very powerful and well-to-do. On one occasion, in the time of Mans\u00far Ali Khan, the Nawab Waz\u00edr, they fought with Abdun Nabi Khan, the Path\u00e1n of Garhi Sanjar Khan, who had come to the borders of their territories to hunt. They got worsted, and the Path\u00e1n took from them some land in which he founded Nabipan\u00e1h, and planted a grove which he called the Ranj\u00edt B\u00e1gh or 'Grove of Victory.' But Abdun Nabi subsequently fell into disgrace, and they recovered the village, and hold it to this day. They separated into several branches, with headquarters respectively at M\u00e1l, their parent village, and At\u00e1ri, S\u00e1l\u00ednagar, Amlauli, Masfra, Ham\u00edrpur, and Nabipan\u00e1h. They tried on one occasion to extend their borders into the Dakhl\u00e1wal tappa, lying on the east of their own towards the Gumti; but the fight between them and the Baises was so\ndoubtful that both agreed to abide by their ancient landmark, the Akrahd\u00ed stream. These Rajputs practice female infanticide, and are too proud to hold their own ploughs, and too dignified to run. They hold almost all their old villages, but some five have come into the possession of the taluqdars\u2014Ahmad Khan and Nas\u00edm Khan.\n\nThe Nikumbhs of Sisw\u00e1ra (Bharad-dwaj Gotr) hold an estate of some twenty-four villages in the centre of the pargana. They are said to have invaded the pargana under two brothers, K\u00e1nh and Kharak, and to have acted in concert with the Gahilw\u00e1r, R\u00e1e Paitaw\u00e1n Singh, who colonized a large tract of the same pargana to their east. Their native country is said to have been N\u00e1rw\u00e1r in the west. With the Gahilw\u00e1rs they drove out the original Jhojha inhabitants and seized their villages. The remains of forts and deserted sites of villages, specially in Tharri, P\u00e1ra, Sisw\u00e1ra, Dil\u00e1warnagar, show that these Jhojh\u00e1s inhabited the country in considerable strength. Their villages are all said to be very ancient. The time of their foundation and origin of their names are unknown. These Rajputs have no history beyond their own villages; they partitioned out their villages amongst themselves at various times; and the Dil\u00e1warnagar family to better their position became Muhammadans.\n\nThe Bais of Tappa D\u00e1k\u00edwal (Bh\u00e1rad-dwaj Gotr). This was a tappa consisting of fifty-two villages which belonged to R\u00e9ja Tej Singh of the Bamhan-Gaur tribe. The greater part of this tappa is now included in the Hardoi district, but twenty-two villages lie in this pargana at the extreme north-east.\n\nThe story goes that R\u00e1m Chandar, a Bais of the Tilok-Chandi clan, who had married into the Panw\u00e1r's family of Itaunja, had taken service with the R\u00e1ja Tej Singh, and having fallen out with him about his pay returned to his native country of Baisw\u00e1ra. Thence he returned with a large force, and drove out the Bamhan-Gaur raja, who fled to some more of their kith and kin on the banks of the Gogra in Khair\u00e1b\u00e1d. In Dukh\u00e1wal still stands a P\u00edpal tree, and there is a small monument\u2014a memorial of the place where the Bamhan-Gaur widows used to perform their suttees\u2014to which the Bamhan-Gaurs to this day bring their offerings for the old Parohits of their tribe on the occasion of a marriage or any other solemn ceremony in their house.\n\nR\u00e1m Chandar had three sons,\u2014Alsukh R\u00e1e, L\u00e1kim R\u00e1e, and Kans,\u2014who settled in Bang\u00e1lpur, Piparg\u00e1on, and Bhithri, and their descendants are now known as the Bang\u00e1l, Piparh\u00e1r, and Bhitharia Bais. It is not known when or how they divided their villages, but by superior energy and address the latter family became possessed of forty-two villages, while the two former got respectively five only. But the fortunes of the family changed in these latter days, and Th\u00e1kur Sr\u00edp\u00e1l Singh, a descendant of the Bang\u00e1l branch, has become the taluqdar of Mans\u00fargarh, and now possesses a large estate in Hardoi. He holds only a few villages in this pargana, and his history more properly belongs to the Hardoi district.\n\nAgain, R\u00e1ja Randh\u00edr Singh, of the same family, has reached the dignity of a taluqdar, and holds a still larger estate in the same district, An\namusing story is told of the exaltation of the latter to the dignity of r\u0101ja. His father was on a certain occasion attending the Court of the Chakladar, R\u0101ja Mihinl\u0101l at Sandil\u0101, and the latter addressing him pleasantly with the words 'come up R\u0101ja S\u0101hib.' From that day he has borne the title thus conferred on him, which is otherwise so venerated by the Hindus that the sanction of some religious ceremony is required to render it valid.\n\nThe tappa Kathaul\u012b R\u0101o was colonized by Janw\u0101rs (Bach Gotr) under R\u0101e Sukh. But their villages have, most of them, fallen a prey to the Path\u00e1n families of Malihabad. Alamg\u012br, the emperor, gave to one of them, Al\u00e1wal Khan, a Bazad Khail Path\u00e1n, eighty bighas mu\u0101f\u012b in Badaura, one of the Kathuli R\u0101o villages, and he built a fort here. Subsequently this Path\u00e1n family had a great fight with Abd-un-Nabi Kh\u00e1n, the Amn\u00e1zai Path\u00e1n, and the latter beat them with the aid of the old Janw\u0101r proprietors of the tappa. Ever since then the Janw\u0101rs and Amn\u00e1zai Path\u00e1ns have been great friends, but this did not prevent the latter from taking most of the Janw\u0101rs' villages, and they hold now only the small village of Shahz\u0101dpur.\n\nOn the south of the pargana, on the right bank of the Baita close to Malihabad, a tribe of Gautams (Gautam Gotr) from Argal held twelve villages, the parent village of which was Datli. They are reputed to have come some four hundred years ago under Deo R\u0101e and Naya R\u0101na from Argal and dispossessed a tribe of Arakhs. They have suffered depredations from the Path\u00e1ns of Malihabad, and now only hold five muh\u0101ls. They are Datli, Pah\u0101rpur, Dhendemau-R\u0101mpur, Basti, and Kheota.\n\nThe Lohnj\u0101r Janw\u0101rs of Kh\u0101r\u0101w\u0101n (S\u00e1ndal Gotr) hold twelve villages, situated to the south-west of the pargana, a short distance from Malihabad. This part of the country was then held by a tribe of Arakhs, probably akin to the P\u00e1sis, who ruled from Malihabad. After Sayyad Sal\u0101r's invasion, they are said to have embraced the Muhammadan faith, and to have kept undisturbed possession of their villages. But in the village of Kh\u0101r\u0101w\u0101n there lived a Brahman family, amongst whom was a daughter famed for her beauty, and she was sought in marriage by one of the sons of the pervert Musalmans. The Brahmans in their extremity sought the aid of some Janw\u0101rs, who were passing the country on a pilgrimage to Gya. The Janw\u0101rs told them to hold out till they, the Janw\u0101rs, could give them some help, and continued their journey, and on their return they attacked the Musalmans, and drove them out of their villages. This is said to have given them their title of Lohnj\u0101rs, or the men of iron. But the tappa is now broken up, and a greater part of it is held by the two Path\u00e1n Taluqdars, Nasim Khan and Ahmad Khan, and other Shekhs and Path\u00e1ns of Malihabad.\n\nThe old tappa of Jindaur consisted of twelve villages, six of which were held by Shekhs and six by Salanki Rajputs. The estate is said to have been conferred on them by the Panw\u0101r R\u0101ja Deo Ridh R\u0101e, who seems to have occupied it before his final settlement in Itaunja. There are in the village the remains of a fort still to be seen which is attributed to the Panw\u0101rs. The Panw\u0101rs came from Dh\u0101r\u00e1nagar in M\u00e1lwa, and the\nSalanki Rajputs and Shekhs are accordingly said to have come from near the same place. Tonk was the native country of the Salankis.\n\nBut there are two stories about the Panw\u00e1r settlement here, while they themselves say they conferred the tappa on the present holders, the latter affirm that they drove the Panw\u00e1rs out. The former story is however probably the correct one. The Panw\u00e1rs were a formidable and strong body of men, and colonized a much larger and richer tract in the pargana (subsequently known as theirs) of Mahona. And viewing this with the fact that they all originally came from the same country, it is much more likely that they gave it up than that they were driven out.\n\nThe leader of the Shekhs was Sal\u00e1bat Ali. From their equestrian excellencies they became afterwards distinguished as the 'Ghor-charh\u00e1s.' They proved loyal in the mutinies, and, under B\u00e1qar Ali and Him\u00e1yat Ali, gave much assistance to Mr. Kavanagh, of the Oudh Commission, in his fight against Lakkar Shah, the Faqir, who moved about the place trying to keep alive the rebellion. Jindaur itself is a village of a considerable size, where there is a large bazar held, and a Government school has been established.\n\nThe Salanki villages have, most of them, come into the possession of the Th\u00e1kur Makrand Singh, but four of them are held in sub-settlement.\n\nMALIHABAD Town*\u2014Pargana MALIHABAD\u2014Tahsil MALIHABAD\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014This town lies in latitude 26\u00b0 55' north, longitude 80\u00b0 45' east, and is situated on the road to Sand\u00edla at the fifteenth milestone from Lucknow, with which it is connected by the railway and a good metalled road. It is the headquarters of the pargana of Malihabad, and contains a police station, tahsil, post, and registration offices and Government schools. The principal residents of the town are muslimans, and the Path\u00e1ns of Malihabad have long been celebrated, though probably but few of the original colonizers and founders of the different muhallas or wards are now left. But they pointed the way to subsequent adventurers, and were succeeded by the Afr\u00eddi Path\u00e1ns of Kenwalh\u00e1r, which is part of the town, and the Amn\u00e1zai Path\u00e1ns of Garhi Sanjar Khan and Bakhti\u00e1rnagar close by. The taluqdars-Nas\u00edm Khan and Ahmad Khan, are of the Afr\u00eddi Path\u00e1ns of Kenwalh\u00e1r, and they built several handsome houses on the north side of the town, and bought and improved Mirz\u00e1ganj. This ganj rose at first to be a large centre of trade, but it declined rapidly after the establishment of a market-place at K\u00e1nkrabad by Sa\u00edd\u00e1t Ali Khan, and the foundation of Newabganj near Moh\u00e1n, district Unao. The usual trades only flourish now in a small way, and nothing worthy of note is made save perhaps a species of tin-foil (tabaq) with which cheap bracelets and the Musalman t\u00e9zias are overlaid. The inhabitants number 8,026, amongst whom there are 85 families of Path\u00e1ns. The times are much altered for the worse for them, for their trade of soldiery is gone. It was chiefly from their ranks that Faq\u00edr Muhammad Khan, the ancestor of Muhammad Nas\u00edm Khan, recruited his regiment of 1,700 saw\u00e1rs. One of their chief means of subsistence depends on the numerous groves which surround the\n\n* By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\ntown. The mangoes here are celebrated, and the ber fruit which are grown in orchards of ber trees called Beriana.\n\nDuring the Nawabi there was properly no proprietor of the township. The town or qasba was one of the old Musalman encamped settlements of which a description has thus been given. \"A qasba is a Musalman settlement in a defensible military position generally on the site of an ancient Hindu headquarters, town, or fort, where for mutual protection a Musalman who had overrun and seized the proprietary of the surrounding villages resided, where the faujdar and his troops, the pargana qanungo and chaudhri, the mufti, qazi, and other dignitaries lived, and as must be the case where the wealth and power of the Moslem sect was collected in one spot a large settlement of Sayyad's mosque, dargahs, &c., sprang up. As a rule, there was little land attached, and that was chiefly planted with fruit groves and held free of rent; whilst each man really had a free hold of the yard of his house and the land occupied by his servants and followers.\" And to crown the description there are 194 separate plots and pieces of land in the villages. The whole has been assessed at Rs. 1,325.\n\nThough the earliest Musalman invader, Sayyad Salar, is said to have paid this place a visit from Kasmandi Kalan, which was the more immediate object of his attacks, it does not seem to have been regularly occupied by Musalmans till the time of the Emperor Akbar. It is said then to have been inhabited by a tribe of Pasis whose head, Malia Pasi, founded the village, though it seems doubtful if its origin cannot be traced much further back. Pasis and Arakhs are said to have held away over this and the surrounding villages from the earliest times. The Pasis were succeeded by Thatheras, and the latter by the Bhars, who were driven out by the first Musalman invasion. But all this is wrapped in uncertainty, and nothing more can be said than there are vague traditions of a Pasi and Bhar raj, of which Malibabad was the centre. It is said that the Bhars had a mint here, and that silver coin of a bad quality has sometimes been found. From this the town is sometimes called Khonta Shahar, the town of the bad money.\n\nThe earliest governors of Oudh seem to have often encamped or settled here. Nawab Shahim Khan, was one. And just outside the village, on an elevated spot of ground is a tomb erected to his wife; it is called a Zacheha-bachcha tomb, in which she was buried with her child.\n\nThe only buildings of note in the town are the large houses of the taluqdars, Nasim Khan and Ahmad Khan, and a few small mosques and tombs. But the town is picturesquely built on broken ground on the left bank of the Sai, and extends over a considerable area.\n\nNo particular religious sect flourishes here. There is one Nanakshahi faqir, and a tribe of Upaddhia Brahmans, who were said to have been the Parohit (priest) of the original Pasi inhabitants, and to have thence spread through the whole pargana in which none but members of this family are allowed to officiate.\nIn an archway of the wall of the old fort is a shrine dedicated to Jurni M\u00e1m\u00e1, at which the new \u00e1mil on his coming used to sacrifice a buffalo, and at the same place is a small temple in which is a deity called Gangdeo, to whom he also offered up a cock.\n\nThe schools here (two in number) are very well attended by nearly 200 boys, and there are two girls' schools, with 80 pupils on the registers.\n\nThe sar\u00e1e was built in 1860, and the baz\u00e1r is held in Mirz\u00e1ganj.\n\nMALL\u00c1NPUR*\u2014Pargana KUNDRI (NORTH)\u2014Tahsil BISW\u00c1N\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014This place is 41 miles to the north-east of Sitapur, with which it is connected by a high road running through Tambaur and L\u00e1harpur. It is five miles east from Tambaur, and is washed on the north and east by the navigable river Dah\u00e1war at its confluence with the Gogra. It is also on the Kheri and Bahraich road. It takes its name from one Mall\u00e1n, a Kurmi, who founded the town 400 years ago. Subsequently the Raik-w\u00e1r Rajputs took it, and they still hold it.\n\nThe population amounts to 4,045, residing altogether in mud houses; the only masonry one being that occupied by the taluqdar (R\u00e1ja Munesh-war Bakhsh). The town was never like Seota, in the Gurka Il\u00e1qa, and hence there is no restriction put upon the building of masonry houses or upon the growing of sugarcane.\n\nThere is a good bi-weekly bazar held in the town, the annual value of the sales being Rs. 7,000. The school affords instruction to 50 boys.\n\nMALL\u00c1NW\u00c1N\u2020\u2014Pargana\u2014Tahsil BILGR\u00c1M\u2014District HARDOL.\u2014This pargana consists of 123 villages. It is bounded by pargana Bangar on the north, pargana Bilgr\u00e1m on the north-west, pargana Kachhandan on the south-west, and pargana B\u00e1ngarnau (Unao) on the south, while the Sai separates it from parganas Sand\u00edla and B\u00e1lamau on the east. Its greatest length and breadth are 16 and 15\u00bd miles, and it has an area of 136 square miles.\n\nThree-fifths (60\u00b779 per cent.) is cultivated; a sixth (16\u00b721 per cent.) is culturable. About a fifth (18\u00b711 per cent.) is returned as barren. A fourth of the area is rated as third-class\u2014that is, sandy and light. Two-fifths of the cultivated area is irrigated, rather more than half the irrigated area being watered from wells, and the rest from tanks and ponds.\n\nThe area under groves, 4\u00b789 per cent. of the whole, is the highest in the district. The average area of cultivation to each plough is 6\u00bd acres.\n\nCrossing the pargana from west to east the natural features which present themselves are these. On the west towards the Ganges is a strip of low tar\u00e1i or 'kachh' land, which, like the adjacent pargana of Kachhandan, has been scooped by the Ganges out of the high land or hangar, and levelled and enriched with alluvial deposits during the river's gradual westward recession to its present bed at the western edge of Kachhandan. Here percolation from below supplies the want of jhils and wells, and\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\n\u2020 By Mr. A. H. Harington, B.A., C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nunless there are unusually long breaks in the rains irrigation is not wanted. The autumn crop is rarely good. Floods from the Ganges may be looked for every second year, and until recently inundations were also to be feared from Gh\u00e1zi-ud-din Haidar's canal which runs along the whole western side of the pargana, just underneath the old bank of the Ganges. The spring crops are good if the autumn floods have drained off in time, but good agriculturists, such as the Kurmis, will not settle in these villages. The insecurity from floods deter them. Moreover, the cattle often die after grazing on poisonous grasses that spring up rank and noxious after a Ganges flood. Rats and field-mice make havoc in a dry season. In many places the soil is impregnated with saltpetre, and everywhere weeds spring up luxuriantly.\n\nLeaving the 'kachh' and crossing the canal you presently ascend the uneven sandy ridge that marks the farthest point eastwards up to which the Ganges has worn its way into the Bangar. The villages along this ridge are sandy uneven and bad. Wells are made with difficulty and soon fall in. The unevenness of the surface creates a constant 'scour' during the rains whereby the surface soil is washed away, and ravines eat deeply into the heart of the country. Beyond this line the land sinks gradually into a rich flat loamy plateau, dotted with occasional jhils which come more frequent as you cross it to the east. Here the water is fairly near the surface; the sub-soil is firm and mud wells are made easily and last well. Kurmis and Kachhis abound, a sure sign of the excellence of the soil; the cultivation is magnificent, and the rents high.\n\nFurther to the east after the watershed has been crossed, and the ground begins to fall towards the basin of the Sai, the quality of the soil again falls off. Sand re-appears, the surface becomes uneven, and irrigation difficult. The villages along the Sai, suffer somewhat from floods, but the injury is partly made up for by irrigation from it, which however is difficult, and not largely availed of.\n\nThe pargana is well furnished with roads. The new route from Sitapur to Miranghat below Kanauj via Misrikh, Nimkh\u00e1r, and Rodamau runs right through it from north-east to south-west, and it is traversed besides by unmetalled roads from Miranghat to Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n and Sandila, from Bilgram to Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n and Unao, and from Bilgram and M\u00e1dhoganj to B\u00e1lamau, and the nearest railway station of the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway at Kachhona.\n\nThe other important villages are Bhagwantnagar, Bansa, Kursat, and Jalalpur. The main products are barley and bajra which at survey covered half the cultivated area; wheat which occupied a sixth, and ju\u00e1r and gram which cropped another sixth. Paddy, arhar, sugarcane, and cotton made up most of the remaining sixth. The acreage under cotton, cane, indigo, tobacco, and poppy, was estimated at respectively 1,370, 1,281, 218, 42, and 7.\n\nThe climate is considered pretty good, kankar is found in patches in most villages, but there are no extensive beds of it.\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses, is Rs. 102,292\u2014a rise of 47 per cent. on the summary assessment. It falls at 1-14-10 on the cultivated acre, 1-2-9 per acre of total area, 12-9-4 per plough, 2-4-11 per head of agricultural, and 1-5-1 per head of total population. The detail of ownership is as follows:\n\nMuhammadans hold 29 villages; Chhattris 48; Brahmins 21; K\u0101yaths 7; Bani\u0101ns and Kalw\u0101rs 4; Christians 1; Government 2. The tenure is mainly zamindari.\n\nPopulation is extremely dense, 571 to the square mile, the highest rate in the district. The total number is 77,681. Hindus to Muhammadans are 71,408 to 6,273, males to females 40,411 to 37,270, agriculturists to non-agriculturists 44,457 to 33,224. The number of Kurmis is exceptional. They are 14,566 or two-elevenths of the whole. Brahmins are a seventh, cham\u0101rs a ninth, Ahirs, Chhattris 3,449, P\u0101s\u012bs and Mur\u0101os (2,696) make up the greater part of the rest.\n\nThere is an aided school at Mall\u0101nw\u0101n (134), and village schools at Sultanganj (49), Atwa (35), Bans\u0101 (38), Babatmau (30), Shahpur (23), and Madhoganj (30).\n\nThe \u0100in-i-Akbari gives the cultivated area as 83,022 bighas; revenue (m\u0101l) 35,96,913 d\u0101ms; Siwae, 2,22,038 d\u0101ms; zamindars, Bais; garrison 30 sow\u0101rs and 2,000 (probably a misprint for 200) foot soldiers. There are no religious gatherings of importance.\n\nSon\u0101si N\u0101th, two miles south of Mall\u0101nw\u0101n, attracts pilgrims in K\u0101rtik on their way home from bathing in the Ganges.\n\nIn Chait and Ku\u0101r there is an eight days gathering of perhaps 2,000 a day at the shrine of M\u0101n Deo in Mall\u0101nw\u0101n.\n\nThe Ramlila draws 10,000 or a 12,000 in Ku\u0101r to Bhagwantnagar. On the 1st of Rajjab Muhammadans hold an \u2018urs\u2019 in honour of the Saint, Makh-dum Shah, at his tomb to the north of Mall\u0101nw\u0101n.\n\nHere, as elsewhere in the Hardoi district, the dawn of history shows a Thathera occupation and their expulsion by Chhattari immigrants at some unknown time before the Muhammadan conquest of Kanauj. The proximity of Mall\u0101nw\u0101n to Kanauj. There is only fourteen miles between them as the crow flies; makes it certain that its political condition must always have resembled that of Kanauj. When Kanauj was Buddhist, Mall\u0101nw\u0101n will have been Buddhist also; and when Brahmanism revived and displaced Buddhism throughout the kingdom of Kanauj it was with the sword of Chhattari chieftains devoted to its service that Buddhist people such as Thatheras, Bhars, and Arakhs were displaced from the territories across the Ganges which they had for centuries held and ruled. The Thatheras of Mall\u0101nw\u0101n were driven out by Chandels from Sh\u012bur\u0101jpur in Cawnpore serving under a Kanauj Monarch.\n\nTirwa Keoli in Kachhandan, opposite Kanauj, is the spot where in Chandel tradition the Thatheras were routed with a great slaughter. To this day the braziers (Thatheras) of Bhagwantnagar affect to mourn over their\nlost possessions in Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n and Kachhandan. Further to the east they were forced out of their settlements at Kursat kal\u00e1n, near the Sai, and B\u00e1n\u1e63a by Kurmis from Gharka and Barha headed by Bh\u00edm and B\u00e1r\u1e63\u00fa.\n\nThere are no distinct traces of Buddhism in the antiquities of the pargana. Perhaps a tradition which attributes to Indra, king of the Deotas, an emblem of Mah\u00e1deo said to have been set up by him before Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n was founded, and still to be seen in a shrine on the mound of Son\u00e1s\u00ed N\u00e1th, two miles south of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, may have a Buddhistic significance. For Indra, the god of the sky, who marshalled the wind as his armies had battled against the clouds for the release of the welcome rains was always regarded as an enemy by the Brahmans, and ancient centres of his worship have been strongholds of Buddhism. \"Indra is still a great favourite with the Buddhist population of Burmah, who regard him as king of the gods\" (Wheeler's History of India, chapter III., pages 21 and 330). And the Ara Debi at Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n Kh\u00e1s has a seven-headed N\u00e1ga hood which may be presumed to be of Buddhist origin.\n\nThe next historical event, of which any trace is to be found, is the invasion of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r in A.D. 1033. The tomb of one of his companions in arms is shown in Muhalla \u00dancha Tila of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and the Shekhs of the place claim to have sprung from an early Muhammadan settlement made during the invasion. Tradition next connects Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n with Jai Chand of Kanauj, and his alliance with and subsequent conquest by Muhammad Ghori. Jai Chand is said to have quartered his wrestlers here. Mal is the country name for a wrestler, and to their origin the q\u00e1n\u00fangos trace the name Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n. The favourite account, however, is that when the Ghori invader marched through on his way from Kanauj to the east, certain humble Ah\u00edrs conciliated him with an offering of cream (mal\u00e1i), which pleased him so much that he forthwith ordered a settlement to be made, and called Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n in memory of the event.\n\nThe early Shekh settlement mentioned above is said to have been discovered in 1415 A.D., by a wandering saint named Makhd\u00edum Shah, Misb\u00e1h-ul-Asfiq\u00edn, who found a few Shekhs living here, without knowledge of their religion. His pupil Misb\u00e1h-ul-Isl\u00e1m, generally called Q\u00e1zi Bhikh\u00e1ri, was appointed q\u00e1zi of the pargana by one of the Lodi emperors (about 1470 A.D.). A book written in 1529 A.D., by Molyi Wali-ud-d\u00edn, and sent me by the q\u00e1zi's descendant Am\u00e1nat-ul-la Shah, recounts the saint's adventures. It tells how on his way from Jaunpur towards Kanauj he met one Wajha-ud-d\u00edn, a Sayyad, who pressed the saint to visit his home at Chandw\u00e1ra. On his way thither the holy man halted at a mud fort which then stood in Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and received presents from certain Shekhs who lived in the neighbourhood. At this period there were only a few Brahman and K\u00e1yath cultivators at Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and a few houses of people who called themselves \"Gob\u00e1ns,\" and professed to be connected with Ab\u00fa Bakr Sidd\u00edq. But their usages and appearance did not enable the saint to recognize them as Musalmans. The loveliness of the place pleased his fancy and he decided to live the life of an ascetic there.\nHere he performed sundry notable miracles. A fellow who mocked him was presently arrested for theft and died miserably in prison. One very hot summer a little company of the faithful had met together to pray. Thirst fell on them, but there was not a pitcher full of water in the well wherewith to bathe or slake their drought. Then the saint smote his hand upon the ground, and rubbed his face, and called upon the Holy One who had stopped the spring, though the faithful who had met to honour him were perishing of thirst. And while he yet prayed behold one cried out that the water had risen in the well to a man's height. And they all bathed and drank, and thirteen of the worshippers present accepted him as their spiritual guide.\n\nOne of these was Shekh Bh\u00edkh\u00e1ri, servant of a Government official at Kanauj.\n\nThe fame of the holy man's miracles at last reached Delhi, and the Sultan Sikandar Lodi despatched his officer Fateh Khan to bring the saint before him. The mission was unsuccessful. A second time Fateh Khan was sent to ask that if he could not come himself he would send some of his disciples. Then Misbah-ul-Ashiq\u00edn sent two of his followers. And when they told the Sultan that it would be a good deed to settle some Muhammadans at Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, he promised rent-free grants to such Muhammadans as would settle there, and appointed Shekh Bh\u00edkh\u00e1ri to be q\u00e1zi. And at last the saint himself went to Delhi. And the Sultan honoured him greatly and offered him rich gifts; but these he would not take. Then he returned to Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, and built himself a solitary cell, and spent four months in it in fasting and prayer, and died in 939 Hijri (1532 A.D.). An interesting record of the time of Sher Shah was shown me in the shape of a rent-free grant issued by him in 1544 A.D., in Persian, Beng\u00e1li, and N\u00e1gri. It confers on Shekh Abdul Qudd\u00fas, Shekh Abdul Razz\u00e1q Muhammad Makan, and Qutb Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Muak\u00edn a rent-free grant of two hundred bigh\u00e1s in mauza Mohludd\u00ednpur, pargana Malawi, near fort Nshargarh alias Kanauj on condition of peopling the land and residing on it, and reciting prayers five times a day in the mosque, and shooting ten arrows daily after the reading of afternoon prayers. And it announces the grant to Munsif Khw\u00e1je Raju, Persian and Hindi Reader, and to the tahsildars and k\u00e1rguz\u00e1rs of the pargana.\n\nThe descendants of Ganga R\u00e1m, founder of Ganga R\u00e1mpur, allege that Akbar made him chaudhri of the pargana, and gave him land on which he founded the village. The q\u00e1n\u00fangos hold an order bearing the seal of the unfortunate prince D\u00e1ra Shikoh, and issued by him in 1653 A.D., when he was admitted by Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n to a considerable share of the government. It is addressed to his trusty Sh\u00e1h Beg, and mentions a complaint by P\u00e1nde Dal\u00edp Singh, that he had long held the q\u00e1n\u00fangship of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n (the town, not the pargana); that Shy\u00e1m L\u00e1l, grain-dealer, had forced him to lease it at a rupee a day, but failed to pay it. Orders enquiry to be made and redress given.\n\nThe iconoclast Aurangzeb (1658-1707) is said to have ordered the stone lingam at Son\u00e1si N\u00e1th, mentioned above to be sawn asunder. The wicked work was begun as the teeth marks shown to you attest;\nbut blood spurted out, a swarm of hornets attacked the godless host, and saved shrine and emblem from destruction.\n\nIn 1226 Shit\u00e1b R\u00e1\u00e9 K\u00e1yath was chakladar. He had been d\u00edw\u00e1n of Bah\u00e1dur Shah. The judicial records of Mustafabad and Atwa tell how he found an unfailing means of acquiring land in his practice of burying the owners alive and then inviting their heirs to execute deeds of sale. \"The bones of the lambardars whom he buried are even now occasionally turned up by the plough in his old compound.\"\n\nDuring Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's campaign against the Nawab of R\u00e1mpur Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n was occupied by Ruhellas.\n\nGh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haidar (1814-1827) excavated the canal already mentioned from the Ganges near Kanauj to the Gumti at Lucknow.\n\n\"The original idea says Mr. Maconochie, in his Unao report, was to join the Ganges and Gumti, but the levels were so infamously taken, and the money granted so misappropriated, that after spending lacs of treasure, and injuring more or less every village through which the canal was driven, the king found himself as far off as ever from the object he desired. It has never done aught but harm. Its bed shelters wild beasts and bad characters in the dry weather, and drains off all the water from the adjacent villages in the rains; thus not merely depriving the land of the water which would otherwise fertilize it, but causing a continual cutting and ravining away of all the neighbouring fields.\"\n\nThe Raikw\u00e1s of Rodamau and Ruia deserve passing but unfavourable notice. Their connection with the pargana is not that of conquerors. They got their footing in it by the humbler method of clearing waste and by persistent fawning on and playing into the hands of the Nawabi officials. They acquired in recent times many villages. They were the first to rise in 1857. It was this clan which burned the Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n (court-house), and which, headed by N\u00e1rp\u00e1t Singh, defended the fort of Ruia so stubbornly against Brigadier Sir Robert Walpole, the lamented Adrian Hope, and the Black Watch.\n\nThe obliteration of ancient proprietary title in this pargana was frequently noticed by the Judicial Courts at settlement. In illustration I quote some passages of interest from the judicial record.\n\nMauza Deomanpur.\u2014\"The Kurmis are the zamindars and are excellent landlords; they should not be disturbed. In this pargana the chaudhr\u00eds and q\u00e1n\u00edngoes steadily ignored the rights of all Kurmis; but in times of difficulty the king's officers always came upon the resident communites.\"\n\nMauza Mustafabad.\u2014\"The title deeds in this pargana are of little value.\"\n\nMauza Manavwar.\u2014\"The Shekhs never succeeded in trampling out the proprietary body on the spot. Panw\u00e1r Rajputs, who held occasionally up to 1264 fasli (annexation); but, like all the proprietors in the pargana, could not keep their own against the mass of chaudhr\u00eds and q\u00e1n\u00edngoes of the town.\"\nof Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n, who appear to have apportioned the villages of this pargana amongst themselves just as they pleased.\"\n\nMauza Berhwal.\u2014\"Whenever there was any transfer of rights, real or pretended, in this pargana, the papers always changed hands, whatever may have become of the village. I do not remember an instance to the contrary. Papers were often sold and mortgaged alone, but the village was never sold without the papers if there were any. In this pargana there was often a fresh qub\u00faliatdar for each year. No one's proprietary rights here were very clear.\"\n\nMauza Dakhile Kassia.\u2014\"In this pargana the white-coated chaudhris and q\u00e9n\u00fangoes ignore all Kurmis and residents of villages except when they are powerful th\u00e1kurs. They used to divide the pargana between themselves.\"\n\nMauza D\u00e1dipur.\u2014\"This village was the ancestral property of plaintiff No. 1. They very likely sold it and mortgaged it four or five times, but these transactions and the deeds which record them are to my mind not worthy of consideration at all. These transfers in Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n pargana were merely intended to give a plausible colour to other transactions in Lucknow. In Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n Government recognized no property in the soil whatever; it was the Nawabi sir, in which Government was entitled to the full balances after the expenses of cultivation, and the cultivator's sustenance had been provided for. No one thought he was selling when he signed one of these purchase deeds, and the vendee never thought he was acquiring a title. These deeds were a means among others of gaining a temporary footing in the village, and that was all they were intended for.\"\n\nAt annexation Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n was chosen as the civil head-quarters of the Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n now Hardoi district.\n\nMALL\u00c1NW\u00c1N\u2014Pargana MALL\u00c1NW\u00c1N\u2014Tahsil BILGR\u00c1M\u2014District HARDOI Latitude 27\u00b03' North, longitude 80\u00b011' east.) is in population fourteenth in the list of Oudh towns, and third among the towns of the Hardoi district. It gives its name to the Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n pargana. Its population (11,670) is lodged in 180 brick and 1,538 mud houses, and distributed in six wards or muhallas named Bhagwantnagar, Gurd\u00e1sganj, Path\u00e1n Tola, Uncha Tola, Nusratnagar, and Q\u00e1zi Tola. It lies on the old route from Cawnpore to Sitapur being 38 miles north of the former and 44 miles south of the latter. From Bilgr\u00e1m it is ten miles nearly south, and from Hardoi 21 miles south. Tieffenthaler (A.D. 1765) found it. \"A small town mostly built of brick, thickly peopled, surrounded by trees. It has a fort built partly of mud, partly of bricks, and having towers.\"\n\nTennant, in the beginning of the present century, describes it as \"a very large village; in length fully two miles. The inhabitants are numerous, but the town is mean and irregular, consisting almost entirely of small mud huts.\"\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harlington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nAs noted in the pargana article tradition derives the name from M\u00e1l, the country name for a wrestler, and asserts that R\u00e1ja Jai Chand of Kanauj cantoned his wrestlers here.\n\nAn early Ah\u00edr settlement called Gh\u00e1zipura is also said to have been here at the time of the Ghorian conquest; while the Chishti Shekhs claim that a remnant of the followers of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r Gh\u00e1zi survived the campaign, the only visible memorial of which that they can point out is a tomb in \u00dancha Tola of one of the martyr host. The preservation of such tombs, rather numerous in Oudh, is a strong corroboration of the tradition that Muhammadans of the invading army remained in Oudh, and preserved the relics of the brilliant but unsuccessful crescentade of the Prince of Martyrs.\n\nThe pargana article mentions the circumstances under which Sikandar Lodi (1488-1516) encouraged Muhammadans to settle here, and appointed a q\u00e1zi.\n\nThe q\u00e1m\u00fangos and chaudhr\u00eds of the pargana were also located here, and in later times the Chakladar of Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n and Sandfla used frequently to reside here. To its official importance alone must its size be attributed, for it has little commercial activity. The grain trade of the neighbourhood is carried on at M\u00e1dhoganj five miles off. A deserted indigo factory, started but abandoned by Mr. Churcher, occupies the site of the old Nawabi fort. A manufacture of saltpetre has recently been begun.\n\nThe town contains four mosques, a darg\u00e1h of Makhd\u00fam Shah (M\u00edsb\u00e1h-ul-Ashiq\u00edn), two im\u00e1mb\u00e1ras, fifteen shiwl\u00e1s, twenty-four masonry wells, and a mud sar\u00e1\u00e9 built by Hak\u00edm Mehndi in 1803. As at Bilgr\u00e1m many of the brick buildings are faced with large hewn blocks of kankar to a height of about three feet from the ground. The darg\u00e1h of Makhd\u00fam Shah, and the mosque of his pupil Q\u00e1zi Bh\u00edkh\u00e1ri, are thus faced throughout, the kankar slabs being relieved here and there with red sandstone. Their style resembles that of Sadr Jah\u00e1n's Mausoleum at Pih\u00e1n\u00ed. There is a fine well of the same period, also lined with blocks of the same material. The blocks thus used in one of the mosques have evidently been taken from some other building, but apparently at the restoration of the mosque, not at its original construction. I am inclined to believe that these kankar blocks have been taken from ancient Hindu and Buddhist shrines, of which the only relics now to be found are such fragments, built into Muhammadan structures, and the broken sculptures that one sees so frequently grouped under some venerable p\u00edpal tree. In the only ancient stone Hindu temple which I have yet seen in Oudh (at Sakar Daha in Partabgarh), the basement of the shrine consisted of several layers of precisely similar blocks of hewn kankar, built up upon a solid square tope of bricks of great size. The \u00c1sa Debi in Mall\u00e1nw\u00e1n is a relic of some such shrine. Its seven-headed N\u00e1ga hood sheltering a female figure points to a Buddhist origin.\n\nThere is a bi-weekly market on Mondays and Thursdays in Gurd\u00e1sganj. Bhagwantnagar contains a good many braziers' (Thatheras') shops. The town has a local reputation for its combs.\nMANDI\u00c1ON\u2014Pargana LUCKNOW\u2014Tahsil LUCKNOW\u2014District LUCKNOW.\n\nMandi\u00e1on or Mari\u00e1on is situated on the Lucknow and Sitapur road, about 4 miles from the iron bridge. It was the site of the old cantonments previous to the outbreaks of 1856-57. These were built by Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, sixth Nawab of Oudh, who kept stationed here three regiments of the Company's troops.\n\nThe town is said to derive its name from Mandal Rikh, who here in the centre of a large forest performed his solitary devotions to Mah\u00e1deo. It was after this occupied by the Bhars who were eventually driven out by Malik Adam one of Masa\u00fad's lieutenants, who led an expedition against it from Satrikh. Malik Adam was killed in battle, and was buried in what is now the Suhabtia Muhalla of Lucknow; an urs (festival) is held yearly in his honour, whence the name of the muhalla (suhabt). There is another tomb in the village raised to the memory of the Nau-gaz\u00e1 Pir, so called from his immense height. He was one of Malik Adam's companions, and fell in the same battle. A colony of Sayyads, the relics of this invasion, is said to have lived here, and to have held the village for 150 years, when they were killed to a man by an invasion led by R\u00e1ja Singh, one of the Raksela Chauh\u00e1ns of Bhauli. This leader conferred the village half on K\u00e1yaths and half on Brahmans, servants of his own. These Brahmins and K\u00e1yaths were subsequently made chandhris and q\u00e1n\u00fangos of the pargana of Mandi\u00e1on, and hold shares in the village till the present day. The town then became the headquarters of the pargana of Mari\u00e1on. In the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari the pargana is called Mandig\u00e1on. It is now a place of no importance. It consists of 754 houses which are mostly of mud. The old cantonments have disappeared, with the exception of a gateway or two, and the gable end of the church which stands out amongst the crops.\n\nThe population is 3,155, of which 731 are Musalmans, and the rest Hindus. There is a Government school attended by 41 pupils.\n\nMANGALSI Pargana*\u2014Tahsil FYZABAD.\u2014District FYZABAD.\u2014The pargana of Mangalsi occupies the north-west corner of the district. Its northern boundary is the river Gogra, its southern is for the most part the Madha. On the west its boundary is the district boundary, in part there is a chain of marshes, in part a ravine, at the bottom of which in the rains runs a considerable stream. On the east the boundary line runs down from the cantonments of Fyzabad in a south-westerly direction to the Madha.\n\nIt is perhaps the most fertile land the best cultivated pargana of the district. It is further wellwooded, and the scenery though as a rule monotonous and tame, is often pretty. In shape it is long and narrow. Near its western end a broad belt of sandy soil runs nearly across the pargana. This is as might be expected broadest towards the river, and the country there breaks into great swelling downs, which are an agreeable change in the prospect. Near the eastern end a ravine, which debouches on the Gogra, cuts far back into the pargana, and its sides are for a considerable distance sandy and bleak. With these exceptions the soil is generally admirable.\n\nBy Mr. J. Woodburn, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nMarshes are common, tanks abundant, and in the wells water is nowhere far from the surface.\n\nThe pargana, as it stands, has received considerable accessions from the parganas of Pachhimr\u0101th and Rudauli, district Bara Banki. It now consists of 126 villages, with an area of 125 square miles, and a population of 98,452; being at the rate of 813 to the square mile. Varieties of the tenure are as follows:\n\n| Talqadari | ... | ... | ... | 67 mauzas. |\n|-----------|-----|-----|-----|------------|\n| Mufrad    | ... | ... | ... | 37 \"       |\n| Rent-free | ... | ... | ... | 3 \"        |\n\nThe revenue demand of the pargana amounts to Rs. 1,00,471.\n\nIts remoter history is difficult to trace. But the advance into its present state of fine cultivation seems to have been comparatively recent. Even a century ago, so it appears, the middle of it, the most fertile portion, was a lakh pera\u2014a forest.\n\nIt is said that Mangalsi takes its name from Mangal Sen, a Gautam Chieftain, whose clan had extensive possessions on this side of the Gogra. The Gautams have long been driven across the river, but they have recently put in a suit for a plot of alluvial land below the village of Mangalsi, as the site of a former village of theirs. The Gautams of Trans-Gogra, whom I have seen, have the very dimmest traditions about Mangal Sen, though they claim him as their ancestor, and they have disappointed me by unfulfilled promises of an enquiry from the pandits regarding the ancient history of their property. It is not a little remarkable, however, that the great Bais families, who hold or held all the lands round Mangalsi, and whose tradition concerning themselves is of an immigration from the west two or three centuries ago, do not represent that they conquered the Gautams. It was Bhars, whom, according to the village stories, they found owners of the country. The subjugation of Gautam Rajputs would have been a more honourable feat than the expulsion of Bhars, and the name would surely have been retained in the family chronicles. It is true the Chauhans of Maholi, who are said to have arrived in the pargana about the same time as the Bais, allege they obtained their village in dowry on the marriage of their chief to a Gautam maiden of Mangalsi. But on the other hand the Shekhs, who now hold Mangalsi, have a story that Mangal Sen was only a Bhar who had a fort close by. These Shekhs are the men of the oldest family in the pargana, and they can verify traditions of a greater age than 300 years. They showed me a remarkable deed, and in the Naskh character, dated 760 Hijri (1359 A.D.), bearing the seal of Firoz Tughlaq, and appointing Muhammad Ahmad Khatib in Mangalsi. They showed me another with the same seal of 761 H., conferring the office of q\u0101zi on Im\u00e1m Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn. I was shown another of 989 H. (1581 A.D.) granting Shekh Y\u00fasuf \u201c100 bighas of land in pargana Mangalsi, Sark\u00e1r Oudh,\u201d bearing the seal of the great Akbar, and they have three farm\u00e1ns of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n of the years 1048-1050 H. giving revenue-free grants to members of the Shekh family. These are followed up by deeds under the seal of the Nawab of Oudh, and as they were not produced for the purpose of any litigation, I have every faith in their authenticity.\nI am inclined therefore to believe, that if Mangal Sen was a Gautam chief and not a Bhar, his possessions were confined to a few riparian villages, and that the village to which he gave his name gave its name to the pargana, formed by the Muhammadan emperors from the importance rather of its Muhammadan proprietors than of its Hindu founder.\n\nThese traditions are not without interest in connection with Mr. Carnegie's views as to the relation between the Rajputs of eastern Oudh and the Bhars.\n\nThese Shekhs of Mangalsi are the only people I have met with in the pargana, who have documentary evidence of any great antiquity of family. The Muhammadan colonies are very few, and the Hindus, always more illiterate, have preserved no record of the remote past.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, however, it seems the pargana was held almost exclusively by the great tribes of the Bais and Bisen Rajputs.\n\nThe Bais divide themselves into two grand families, the eastern and the western, who, though they eat together, recognize no relationships, and retain the memory of bitter border warfare with each other.\n\nThe western Bais say that thirteen generations ago Bik\u00e1i S\u00e1h immigrated into the pargana from some place in Baisw\u00e1ra on the banks of the Ganges, and founded a village which he named after his son (Dallan S\u00e1h) Dilwa Bh\u00e1ri. Dallan S\u00e1h acquired a great tract of the surrounding country, and on his death his sons\u2014Paune, Bhart, and Maich\u00e1n\u2014divided equally amongst themselves the thirty-six villages of his estate. Hence the western Bais are familiarly known as the Bais of the \"chhatt\u00eds.\" Bhart's descendants are the Bais of Bilkh\u00e1w\u00e1n, Maich\u00e1n's those of Sarang\u00e1pur, Paune's those of Chakw\u00e1ra. But when the families had been separate for a generation or two they began to quarrel, and the Sarang\u00e1pur men, the inhabitants of a vast jungle, and notorious robbers, gradually usurped the whole of Paune's share, except the one miserable little village of Chakw\u00e1ra\u2014all that now remains to Paune's sons. Bhart's family held their own, and are now in thriving circumstances. None of these Bais ever attained to distinction. M\u00e1n S\u00e1h, the fifth in descent from Maich\u00e1n, took service at Delhi, and became a favourite of the emperor; but it does not appear that he was ever advanced to particular rank, and he made no attempt to use his influence to the advantage of his kinsmen. S\u00e1di S\u00e1h, another of Maich\u00e1n's branch, constructed a fort of considerable size at Deora Kot, but I heard no special tradition of his valour in the clan feuds (vide Appendix A).\n\nThe eastern Bais are of several families. The most important is that of R\u00e1epur Jalalpur. The head of this line was Singh R\u00e1e, the son of R\u00e1m R\u00e1e, of R\u00e1epur in Baisw\u00e1ra. He and Banb\u00edr R\u00e1e, who was probably a relation, are said to have settled in the east of the pargana, nearly at the same time that Bik\u00e1i S\u00e1h settled himself in the west. The two chiefs took possession of twenty-six villages each, the one making his headquarters at Singhpur, the other at Banb\u00edrpur, and these Bais are conse-\nquently known as those of the \"B\u00e1wan.\" Singh and Banb\u00edr were on the most friendly terms, and Singh engaged alone with the Government for the entire estate. For five generations the fifty-two villages were held as one tenure, and Singh R\u00e1e's house grew to such greatness that its head was called a raja. The last of the chiefs was M\u00e1n Singh (a name which in this part of Oudh seems to have carried with it infallible success). He was the eldest of four brothers. On his death one of these made himself independent, but for five generations more the three remaining shares on Singh R\u00e1e's side continued united. In the time of Band\u00fa R\u00e1e these two split up, and the estate was then held in five separate blocks till R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh became chakladar. In 1828-29 the raja absorbed the whole of the villages one after the other into his taluqa, and there they remain to this day.\n\nAt M\u00e1n Singh's death the Banb\u00edrpur muh\u00e1l was first separately engaged for. Banb\u00edr R\u00e1e had two sons\u2014R\u00e1e Bass\u00edk and Udit R\u00e1e\u2014the former became Muhammadan and took the name of Bhikhan Khan. These Bais say, quite frankly, that it was the custom at that time for each taluqdar to have a son made Muhammadan in the hope that in the most disastrous case a bigoted emperor might not wholly deprive the family of their lands, and that in more ordinary times they might have a near and certain friend privileged with the entree of the Musalman courts. Many taluqdars, it is said, showed similar caution at a more modern date by sending one relative to the British force and another to the rebels, to \"make siccar\" of safety, much as the highlanders did in forty-five, whichever side might win.\n\nThese Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1sas, the Bais Muhammadans, were apportioned a number of villages, and these they still retain. The fears of Banb\u00edr R\u00e1e were perhaps not unjustified, but the services of the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1sas were never required to enable their Hindu brethren to hold their own. On the contrary, the only use the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1sas ever made of any influence they possessed was to usurp their kinsmen's lands. On this occasion there came to the rescue of the Hindu Bais a K\u00e1yath of Delhi, who had received an appointment as Diw\u00e1n to the chakladar. In gratitude for this service, the Bais presented him with the village of Gop\u00e1lpur, and Gop\u00e1lpur is still the property of the diw\u00e1n's descendants.\n\nThe villages of the Banb\u00edrpur muh\u00e1l followed those of Singhpur into the taluqa of R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh. Those of the Kh\u00e1nz\u00e1sas alone escaped. Several of them had been given in 1193 H. (1779 A.D.) by As\u00edf-ud-daula, the Nawab of Oudh, to \u00c1lam Ali for the support of the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra at Fyzabad.\n\nBetween the estates of these two great clans of Bais lie those of two smaller ones. These are the Bais of Sirhir and those of Arthar. The former had twelve villages, the latter had twenty-seven. I have said they had villages. They are families of a more recent date than those of their great eastern and western fellow-clansmen. They never produced a man of any distinction, and their possessions rapidly waned. On every side they lost ground.\n\nTo the west of these lay the estate of the Bisen. The greater part of this was in pargana Pachhimr\u00e1th; but they must be noticed here, for Kundarka,\nof Mangalsi was the birthplace of a Bisen, who attained the greatest distinction of any native of this pargana. Hindu Singh entered the service of Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula as a private soldier. He rose rapidly to the rank of Subadar. His regiment was one of several sent to reduce Birjaulia, a strong fortress near B\u00e1ngarmau. The siege lasted many days, and the Nawab wrote impatient letters, angry at the delay. But still Aj\u00e1b Singh, commandant of the expedition, would not permit an assault. Then Hindu Singh, with an insubordination justified by the result, himself led his regiment to the attack. He carried the fort at the point of the sword, and, as the Bisens say,\u2014\u201ca great many zamindars were killed.\u201d Hindu Singh himself was wounded. The Nawab on hearing of this brilliant feat cashiered Aj\u00e1b Singh, made Hindu Singh \u201ccaptain\u201d in his room, and gave him the command of seven regiments, and the rank of a jarnail (general). His brother, Barjai Singh, was promoted to the command of his own old regiment, and from that time forth he was present with the Nawab\u2019s forces in almost every action in which they were engaged. He fought alongside English troops in the Rohilla war of 1774. His descendants proudly declare that the English General admitted the entire credit of the victory (at Babul N\u00e1la?) to rest with him, although the fact is the native troops were not advanced till the close of the battle, and Colonel Champion complained,\u2014\u201cwe have the honour of the day, and these banditti the profit.\u201d The services of Hindu Singh, however, were handsomely rewarded, and the Nawab gave him the revenue-free tenure of Kap\u00e1si and L\u00e1khauri, two of the richest villages in the pargana.\n\n\u00c1sif-ud-daula held him in as high esteem as his father. There is a story that \u00c1sif-ud-daula was shooting near Butwal in Naip\u00e1l. A tiger came out of the forest straight in front of the Nawab\u2019s elephant. Hindu Singh, who was near by, drew off the tiger by making his elephant lie down, and as the tiger attacked him, sliced it in two with one sweep of his scimitar. The astonished and delighted Nawab presented the valorous general with his own elephant. Hindu Singh in the excitement did not lose his self-possession, and promptly suggested that a grant of land would be useful for the support of so huge a beast. And the Nawab directed that he should hold thenceforth free of revenue his village of Uchitpur.\n\nUnder Waz\u00edr Ali Khan and Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, Hindu Singh remained in the possession of his honours and dignities, but he seems to have withdrawn from active life. His brother, Bari\u00e1r Singh, commanded at the siege of Mundrasan and took the fort. Soon after Hindu Singh died and was succeeded by his son, R\u00e1ja M\u00e1dho Singh, who seems to have led a simple country life, and is familiarly remembered as the \u201cSiw\u00e1e S\u00e1heb.\u201d He and his family held two Subahdarfs. Their estate was in Huz\u00far Tahsil. In 1843 it was finally absorbed in the great taluqa of R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh.* Kap\u00e1si and Uchitpur were held by Sir M\u00e1n Singh revenue-free till the revised settlement, and Lakhauri revenue-free for life.\n\n* R\u00e1ja Bakht\u00e1war Singh, Brahman, and R\u00e1ja Darshan Singh, Kurmi, were also instances in this district of successful soldiers of fortune. The former began life as a trooper in the old 8th Light Cavalry, the latter as a common day-labourer. Both attracted the notice of Nawab Sa\u00e1dat Ali Khan, an admirer of fine physique, and after his enthronement by us, Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn Haider put his newly-acquired royal powers into force by creating them and two others rajas of the realm.\nOn the north-west of the pargana are the possessions of two Chauh\u00e1n families, Maholi, Dhaurahra, Barai Kal\u00e1n, and R\u00e1mnagar. Both families assert that they come from a place called Bhuinganj or Bhuinagar in Mainpuri, and they consider themselves of much purer and higher family than the Chauhans of the great southern family of this district of 565 villages. They marry their sons in the east among the Bais of Kot Sar\u00e1wan, the Bais of the Chaur\u00e1si of S\u00e1lehpur Sarayy\u00e1n near Sh\u00e1hganj, and also the Gautams of trans-Gogra. Their daughters they marry in the west to Panw\u00e1rs, the Chamar Gaurs of Amethia, S\u00farajbans, and Raikw\u00e1rs. The men of Dhaurahra give themselves much the most ancient lineage. Their ancestor, N\u00e1g Mal or N\u00e1g Chand, is said to have got the villages which his family now hold on his marriage with a Kalhans maiden, but I can find no other tradition of Kalhans' possessions in the pargana. N\u00e1g Mal settled at Dhaurahra, and on his death the villages were divided among his grandsons, Dhaurahra falling to Mahma S\u00e1h, Barai to R\u00e1m D\u00e1s, and R\u00e1mnagar to Nar\u00e1in D\u00e1s. The ancestor of the Maholi m\u00e1n again is said to have acquired his property here by marriage into the Gautam family of Mang\u00e1isi. His descendants have, besides Maholi, two neighbouring villages in the Bara Banki district, Firozpur and Misri.\n\nThese Rajput tribes formed the chief proprietary of the pargana. Several isolated settlements were made by Muhammadans and others, but the Rajputs were so predominant that it will be sufficient to mention them in the notes I have to give on the villages of the pargana. The tribes retained their possessions, one as against the other, with singularly little change. On the west they are still independent proprietors. On the east 68 villages have been absorbed into the vast estate of Sir M\u00e1n Singh, and the clansmen have been reduced for the most part to the position of cultivators holding at a privileged rate.\n\nNotes on the villages of the pargana.\u2014On the extreme west of the pargana is Sihb\u00e1r, a Muhammadan town, founded some 300 years ago by one Sih \u00c1lam, an immigrant from the western colonies of Nawabganj. He had two sons, Sayyad \u00c1lam and Sayyad Mahr\u00e1m, whose houses still stand, but in the decay which has befallen the fortunes of a family now too numerous to be comfortably supported by their slender property. The town is mean and dirty, standing on the miry slope that trends into the Gogra alluvium. To the south-west, however, is the interesting little village of Begamganj. It was founded by the Bah\u00fa Begam at the entrance to her fief domains. A bridge in excellent repair, built by Tikait R\u00e1e (the famous D\u00edw\u00e1n, whose Tikaitnagar with its broad avenues and lofty walls is still the most striking town in the Bara Banki district), spans a picturesque stream, the boundary of the two districts. The queen-mother built in the hamlet a mosque and well, which are now overshadowed by a noble banyan tree; near it she laid out a garden, with light gateways at its main entrances. Withering sh\u00edsham trees still mark the ancient walls, but coarse arhar and rank weeds have usurped the place of marigolds and roses, and the summer-house in the middle has lost its roof, and the fruit-cellars are blackened by the fires of the field watchmen.\nIt is here that the old Lucknow road enters the Fyzabad district. Flanked by ruins at almost every turn, it is interesting throughout its whole course, and the shade of its many avenues brings it to this day to be more frequented by native travellers than the adjoining British highway. There are bazars at every second or third mile, and the traffic along it in former days must have been more considerable than one is at first disposed to believe. The number of wells that dot its side is astonishing. They seem to have been all constructed by private liberality.\n\nAfter leaving Begamganj the old road enters the village of Dhaurahra, in which there is a large bazar called Muhammadpur. On the outside of the town embowered in woods is a gateway of handsome proportions, said to have been built by Asif-ud-daula, who was struck by the beauty of the place when on his way to shoot at the Bakra jhil. On the other side is a very ancient Hindu shrine, shaded by a magnificent grove of tamarind trees. The tradition is that there was a well there from time immemorial. There was a jungle round the well. It was twelve kos from Ajodhya\u2014a mystic, stage and Mah\u00e1deo lived there. Certain faqirs, on their journey to Ajodhya conceived the design of removing Mah\u00e1deo and exhibiting him for gain, like the relic-sellers of the middle ages. So by night they began to dig him out (his body was in the earth), but as they dug his head retreated into the ground, and in horror they fled. In the morning the neighbours came to worship, and beheld the wonder. Chitai S\u00e1h, a devout merchant of Mub\u00e1rakganj, built a dome over the sacred spot, and not to be outdone, Girdhari S\u00e1h, another merchant, but of R\u00e1mnagar, surrounded the dome with a masonry platform and lofty walls. It is sadly in ruins, and the neighbours are not now sufficiently pious to put it in repair.\n\nBeyond this is the village of H\u00e1jipur. In the middle of it the road reaches a hamlet known both as Begamganj and as Umarpur. The Begam S\u00e1hib hoped to establish a bazar there, and she furnished it with a gateway at each entrance. But the gateways seem to have never been completed. The domes that crowned it were plastered, and the work stopped. The arches have fallen in, and the structures have hastened to a premature decay. The hamlet is still ruinous. The most pretentious of the houses belonged to one D\u00e1l Singh, who made a great fortune in the Meerut distillery, and removed his family there, leaving the paternal mansion to the care of an old woman. A number of eunuchs live in this place; they built a mosque seventy years ago, which they keep in excellent repair. On the west of the village is a very old mosque in complete ruin. It is known as that of P\u00edr Khw\u00e1ja Hasan, whose grave adjoins it. The faq\u00edr in charge declares the p\u00edr belonged to Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r\u2019s army, but the well beside the mosque, which is still in good order, is said to be of the same date. A faujdar, whose name has passed from the memory of the living, lies buried near by.\n\nBetween this and Ron\u00e1hi there are two small bazars, Mub\u00e1rakganj and Aliganj, but in these there is nothing of note. Near Sun\u00e1ha are numerous tombs, declared by the Muhammadans to be the graves of soldiers of Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, the invader of Oudh in 1030 A.D. The Musalmans of\nOudh are, however, apt to associate with Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r every object or tradition of antiquity, to which they can ascribe no certain origin. This road abounds with alleged mementoes of the prince's march. As it passes out of the sandy knolls which mark the country in the environs of Ron\u00e1hi, it comes upon an old mosque shrouded in thorns; and the tombs of two \"martyrs\"\u2014Aulia Shahid and Makan Shahid\u2014reposing under the shade of a far-spreading banyan. The men of Ron\u00e1hi will not pass this way after night fall. They say that by night the road is thronged with troops of headless horsemen, the dead of the army of Prince Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r. The vast array moves on with a noiseless tread. The ghostly horses make no sound, and no words of command are shouted to the headless host. But when the last of the dead spirits has passed by, the Jins, who frequent the gloomy mosque, rush to the close of the procession with unearthly shrieks, and the townsmen, awe-struck as they listen, cower in terror at their hearths.\n\nRon\u00e1hi is and has for some time been the principal town of the pargana. It is twelve miles from Fyzabad, and there is an encamping ground to the south. It seems to have been originally colonized by settlers from Sihb\u00e1r, but it is now owned by a strange mixture of families. The principal owners are relations of the Shekhs of Mangalsi whom I have already mentioned, but it is not very clear how they acquired their rights. The K\u00e1yaths, the family of the pargana q\u00e1n\u00e1ngos who own a third, are in the 14th generation from Khw\u00e1ja M\u00e1n S\u00e1h, who purchased his share from the Sayyad colonists. A family of Khattris, the only one I have met in the pargana, has had a small share for eleven generations; the Path\u00e1ns of S\u00e1lehpur usurped it is said another; and Mir Ahmad Ali, a complete stranger to the town, has recently acquired another. There are four m\u00fashi tenures in Ron\u00e1hi, all of old standing, but small extent, granted to faq\u00edrs or servants of the Nawabs, while Fyzabad was the capital. Under the kings an \u00e1mil was stationed at Ron\u00e1hi, and part of his official residence is now made use of as a police post. Far out on the west of the town an idg\u00e1h still stands, which was built by one of the \u00e1mis of \u00c1s\u00edf-ud-daula's time, and in Sukh\u00e1wan there is a \"purwa\" (hamlet) which bears the name of another; but these officers were so frequently changed that even the names of few of them are recollected, and still less their personal characters.\n\nA couple of miles east is Mangalsi. On the ancient traditions regarding this place I have already commented. Its Shekh proprietors are not in very flourishing circumstances, and the town has now for many years lost its position as the chief place in the pargana. It has an idg\u00e1h of the last century, and an im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, to the support of which a considerable tract of land has been released by the Government in rent-free tenure. The town overlooks the river from a cliff, and the vicinity is seamed with ravines. The old road keeps well to the south. It crosses one of the n\u00e1las by a bridge built by Tur\u00e1b Ali, D\u00edw\u00e1n of the Bah\u00fa Begam, one end of which, however, lately fell partially in.\n\nPassing through the villages of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmpur and F\u00edrozpur, which belong to cadets of the Mangalsi family of Shekhs, the road comes up close to\nthe new metalled highway near Jal\u00e1labad. Between the two roads stand the ruins of a mosque known as P\u00edrnagar. It is said that twelve generations ago Ali Khan, a Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r at the court of Delhi, taking some umbrage made off with his troops to this part of the country, which was then in the kingdom of Jaunpur. A detachment of the imperial army was sent in pursuit of him, and he took refuge with his men in a jungle at the foot of the hills near Utraula in the Gonda district. He was there surrounded and killed. A thousand of his men, they say, shared his fate, but his son got the zamindari of the pargana of Utraula by sycophancy to the P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h. His descendants are still powerful proprietors there. His Dafad\u00e1r, Jal\u00e1l Khan, founded Jal\u00e1labad. A p\u00edrz\u00e1da officer of his corps built the mosque of P\u00edrnagar, and another mosque was built at Kot Sar\u00e1wan close by in honour of five brothers, Ris\u00e1ld\u00e1rs in his force, who were killed there in a battle. In the village of Jal\u00e1labad there is a crumbling tomb of unusual size, said to have been erected to the memory of the wife of Sayyad Nauroz Ali; but no descendants of the Sayyad, or of any of a band of settlers, which must have been numerous, now survive in the neighbourhood.\n\nA short distance beyond P\u00edrnagar, and on the very border of the high road, is the mosque of the \u201cPanj-bhayy\u00e1,\u201d which has just been mentioned. It is in excellent preservation. Inside the enclosure are the graves of the five brothers, and an upright diagonal monolith of coarse stone, said to be in honour of their mother\u2014a most uncommon form of tombstone in this part of the country. On the western side are the remains of a large masonry platform, flanked by heavy pillars, which is called a \u201cGanj-i-Shahid\u00e1n,\u201d the burial-place of Musalman martyrs. The villagers state, curiously enough, that the battle in which these men fell was a battle with the Bhars. As the village took its name of \u201cKot-Sar\u00e1wan,\u201d from its being the headquarters of the Bais estate or tappa of 52 villages, it would seem to follow that the immigration of the Muhammadan soldiers, who fought the battle and built the mosque, was prior to that of the Bais. And yet the Bais detail sixteen generations from their arrival, while the Muhammadans reckon only twelve. It is difficult to avoid the suspicion that the defeated \u201cBhars\u201d were Bais. Still it is unaccountable that the victors, who entombed their dead and maintained their mosque, permitted the territorial supremacy of the vanquished Bais.\n\nAt the next milestone is the village of Mumt\u00e1z-nagar. There is an old mosque there also built by Mumt\u00e1z Kh\u00e1n, a Path\u00e1n of the west country. None of his descendants are alive, and no one knows anything about him, but even the Hindus of the place regard the building with reverence. They put their foreheads to the stones on entering it, and a Bh\u00e1t, who has recently come to the village, religiously lights it on feast-nights. An inscription in stone over the postal bears the date \u201c1025\u201d [1616 A.D., time of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr]. The mosque is dilapidated, but like most of these ancient buildings had been very strongly constructed of kankar blocks.\n\nOver the trees one sees from this on the south the dome of T\u00e1jpur Maqbara (mausoleum). The Path\u00e1ns of T\u00e1jpur are a very small and poor family, but they trace their descent to one Jam\u00e1l Khan, who, they say,\ncame to Oudh some 450 years ago, and was given a subah of a great many villages. These have been absorbed in other estates one by one, and the only village now left to the family is that of T\u00e1jpur. The Maqbara contains the tombs of the father and immediate relatives of Jam\u00e1l Khan, and is in very good preservation under the care of a faqir, but the graves of Jam\u00e1l Khan himself and his wife stand apart open and ruinous. The Path\u00e1ns have a mu\u00e1fi sanad for 200 bighas in favour of \"Musammat Aziz Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, descendant of Jam\u00e1l Khan,\" of the date 1084 fasli (1687 A.D.). It is of the time of Aurangzeb, but the seals are illegible. Kapt\u00far Singh of R\u00e1epur built a fort in T\u00e1jpur, and the Path\u00e1ns, though so long independent proprietors, still pay the feudal tribute of \"bhent\" to the Bais headmen.\n\nAt Mumt\u00e1znaqar, near the remains of a gateway, the old road and the new join. Tombs and bazars still mark the line of the old thoroughfare. At Ab\u00fa Sar\u00e1e it passes into the cantonments of Fyzabad.\n\nBhar forts, as they are called, are common in the pargana. A list is annexed of the villages in which they occur. They are in general simply rounded mounds, more or less lofty, strewn with broken brick. The mounds appear to be in the main artificial, and their area is never large. If the dwellings of the Bhars were confined to the mound, the population of that day must have been very scanty. This is hardly consistent with the revenue returns of Akbar's reign for the neighbourhood, and yet, according to the corroborative accounts of the Rajput tribes, the Bhars were dominant till Akbar's time. Impressed, however, with that idea, and finding it hard to believe, that a small population living on an exuberant soil could have lived in a state of constant strife, I conceived that the mounds were possibly constructed as a sanitary precaution against the malaria of a region of marshes and forests. The theory is scarcely justified by the position of some of the mounds with which I became acquainted; but however this may be, there can be no doubt a great change has taken place in the habits of the people since the days of the mound makers. Brick strongholds have been succeeded by clay huts, and, as in the case of Kal\u00e1parpur, the people have formed the notion that evil and misfortune haunt the dwelling-places of their forerunners. It is strange how the name of the Bhars should have adhered to places that now know them no more. It is the universal assertion of the people that the Bhars have entirely disappeared out of the land. The story of the Bhars is singular because it is so inexplicable, and interesting because so singular. Where are they? Who are they? Their works remain, but these give little light. Their mounds are not like those of Assyria, which wrap entire cities in their sheltering sand: nor even like the barrows of the Celts, where the dead were entombed, equipped with the implements of the living for the happy hunting ground of the second earth.\n\nSarj\u00fapur is a tiny village, which was given rent-free by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula to M\u00fand R\u00e1m, Gosh\u00e1\u00edn, Kayath of Ron\u00e1hi. It is supposed to be a holy spot as the junction of the Sarju and Gogra rivers, and a fair is held there.\nat the full moon of P\u00fas. This is the only fair in the pargana, and is not very largely attended.\n\nIn Dholi Askaran there are interesting ruins of an enormous fort. Bastions of commanding height, crowned by banyan trees of great size and age, overlook a deep moat. The people point out the old parade-ground and the stables, and the women's apartments, but further than that it was built 200 years ago by a K\u00e1yath Chakladar, M\u00e1ta Gur Bakhsh, they cannot tell. How long the fort was held, what became of his family, whether his successors lived there, no one seems to know.\n\nIn Bh\u00e1wannagar, too, there is said to have been a fort. The line of the ditch is shown, and the people say that there were a d\u0101h and a well there within the memory of man, but not a brick remains. This fort belonged to a family of Path\u00e1ns, who appear to have acquired a small estate of five villages* from the Bisens in the last century. Allahpur is the only village still in their hands. They have papers showing they held these lands in fief a hundred years ago.\n\nMustafabad is a thriving town with a large population of weavers. On the south, separated from the town by a marsh, and standing in lonely bleakness, is an ancient mosque said to have been built by a Sayyad B\u00e1ri, the founder of the town. (The town is sometimes called Bar\u00e1g\u00e1n.) Twice a year, on the two \u00cdds, the Sayyads go to their ancient mosque to pray; but their customary resort is a mosque of new fashion, which, with an im\u00e1m-b\u00e1ra and handsome house, Sayyad D\u00edd\u00e1r Jah\u00e1n built here towards the close of native rule. Another mosque of a century's standing is being put in repair by the weavers. The most noted native of the place was B\u00e1q\u00e1r Ali, who was Darogha of the Princes' palace in Lucknow in 1830-40. He retired with a fortune, and became the head of the Muhammadans of the pargana. He obtained the engagement of several of their villages, and was revenue surety for others in the Huz\u00far Tahsil.\n\nThe weavers of Mustafabad are almost the only manufacturers in the pargana. They find a sale for their cloth at Rudauli and in this pargana, in the bazar of Muhammadpur, in which there is a muhalla of dyers. The markets are numerous but chiefly of agricultural produce; they are\u2014\n\n| Town                  | Day               |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| Roh\u00e1li               | Saturday and Tuesday. |\n| Begamganj in Mawayya | Saturday and Wednesday. |\n| Suchaitganj in Khirauni | Monday and Thursday. |\n| Deora in Kundarka    | Tuesday and Friday. |\n| Bilkh\u00e1w\u00e1n (built this year) | Sunday and Wednesday. |\n| Deora Kot (recent)   | Saturday and Tuesday. |\n| Muhammadpur in Dhaurahra | Sunday and Wednesday. |\n\nMANIKAPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by parganas Gonda and Sadullahnagar, on the south by parganas Nawabganj and Mah\u00e1dewa, on the west by Gonda, and on the east by parganas Babhip\u00e1i\u00edr and Sadullahnagar. Formerly the pargana contained 195 villages, with an area of 80,006 acres, but one more village having been lately added, it now covers an area of 80,038 acres, or 125 square miles. The unculturable land amounts to 2,994 acres,\n\n* Allahpur, Bh\u00e1wannagar, Bir\u00e1hempur, Umarpur, Mau.\nthe culturable waste to 4,057 acres, and cultivated to 34,839 acres. Groves cover 2,148 acres. Thus the cultivated land is 43 per cent., the culturable waste 49 per cent., groves 3 per cent., and unculturable 5 per cent. Of the cultivated land 25 per cent. is 1st class soil, 33 per cent. 2nd class, and 42 per cent. 3rd class. The irrigated area covers 17,399 acres, and the unirrigated 17,440 acres; 10,407 acres are watered from wells.\n\nThe following streams traverse this pargana from west to east:\u2014The Bis\u00fahi, the Chainwai, and the Manwar. These are neither used for navigation nor for irrigation; they do not do any mischief to the crops by overflowing their banks. There are 9 villages bordering on the Bis\u00fahi, and 11 villages lie on the bank of the Chainwai. The Manwar skirts 19 villages.\n\nWater is met with at a depth of 14 to 19 feet from the surface. Except in villages situated in the vicinity of jungles, the climate of the pargana is on the whole good.\n\nThe Government revenue amounts to Rs. 52,959-14-0, the land revenue being Rs. 51,475, and the cesses Rs. 1,484-14-0.\n\nR\u00e1ni Saltanat Kunwar of Man\u00edkapur is the principal landholder of the pargana; she lives in Ashrafapur. The villages are thus held:\n\n| Taluqdar\u00ed | Zamindar\u00ed | Pattidar\u00ed |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|           |           |           |\n|           |           |           |\n\nTotal 196 mauzas.\n\nThe tribal distribution of property is as follows:\n\n| Chhatti | Brahman | Musalman | Europeans | K\u00e1yath | Baf\u00ed\u00e1n | Others |\n|---------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|\n|         |         |          |           |        |        |        |\n\nTotal 196 mauzas.\n\nThe population of the pargana amounts to Rs. 41,656.

The pargana has, singularly to say, no masonry house.\n\nThe grain purchased at Tulsipur is taken to Nawabganj market by the road from Utraula to the town of Nawabganj, which passes through this pargana. There are no other channel communication.\nThere are seven village schools in the pargana. Their names are as follows:\n\nKhota ... 32 pupils. Dhueswa ... 47 pupils.\nBhitaura ... 50 Biddi\u00e1nagar ... 40 \"\nMachh\u00edg\u00e9on ... 57 \" Dankarpur ... 66 \"\nBeripur ... 35 \"\n\nThere is no registry, tahsil, or police office.\n\nHistory.\u2014At a time of which the exact date is uncertain, this il\u00e1qa was in the possession of Th\u00e1rus, but the Bhars succeeded in displacing them, and a chief of the latter, called Makka, cut the jungle which then covered a great part of the pargana, and founded the village of Manikapur calling it after himself. At this place he fixed his headquarters. Makka Bhar and his descendants ruled here for six generations. They were in turn subdued by Newal S\u00e1h, a Chandrabansi or Bandhalgoti Chhattri (see pargana Nawabganj, district Gonda), who reigned at Maksara, a village of this pargana. This Chhattiri clan ruled at Manikapur for 12 generations, and the last of the line was Part\u00e1b Singh, who left no issue at his death. His wife became a suttee with her husband, and her suttee chab\u00fatra stands in mauza Bhitaura in this pargana. R\u00e1ni Bh\u00e1gm\u00e1ni, the mother of Part\u00e1b Singh, then adopted Azmat Singh, a son of Datt Singh, the Bisen R\u00e1ja of Gonda, who was her sister's husband. Thus the Manikapur r\u00e1j was acquired by the Bisen family. Five r\u00e1jas have passed since. R\u00e1ni Saltan\u00e1t Kunwar, the widow of R\u00e1ja Pirth\u00edp\u00e1l, is the present head of the family. The estate in her possession contains 159 villages, and gives a land revenue of 28,547-14-0.\n\nThe Biddi\u00e1nagar estates, consisting of 30 villages, and the Garhi estate of as many villages, have passed to R\u00e1ja Kishandatt R\u00e1m of Singha Chanda, and nine villages are in the possession of the heirs of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Man Singh.\n\nThe only fair in the pargana is that held in honour of Karohan N\u00e1th Mah\u00e1deo at Karohan village on the day of the Shuir\u00e1ttiri.\n\nMANIKAPUR\u2014Pargana MANIKAPUR\u2014Tahsil UTTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014A little village of 547 inhabitants, which gives its name to the pargana. It was founded by Makka Bhar, who had displaced the Th\u00e1rus from this part of the country. The site was formerly covered with a dense jungle. It is 20 miles from Gonda, 58 from Bahramghat, and 52 south of the hills. The Manwar stream flows to the north of the village. Water is met with at 16\u00bd feet. The only fair is held on the Kartiki P\u00faranm\u00e1shi for bathing in the Manwar. There is a Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, but no place of Moslem worship. Mahua is the staple product of the place.\n\nMANIKPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This small but celebrated pargana lies along the bank of the Ganges, between Bih\u00e1r and Salon. It was formerly much larger, but the Kanhpuras and the Bisens seizing some of the villages managed, for greater security, to include them in their parganas. Its area is only 36 square miles, or 22,796 acres, of which 10,300 are cultivated, and 8,152 barren. The population\nis 50,849, being at the rate of 1,412 per square mile, or five per cultivated acre; except the Lucknow pargana, its population is the densest in Oudh.\n\nIt contains the finest scenery in the district. The banks of the Ganges are high, the town of M\u00e1nikpur is picturesquely situated among numerous groves, and every garden contains some graceful ruin\u2014a mosque or tomb\u2014in all stages of decay.\n\nThe proprietary rights are as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Mufrad | Total |\n|-----------|--------|-------|\n| Bisen     | ...    | 48    | ...   |\n| Raikw\u00e1r   | ...    | ...   | 1     |\n| Brahman   | ...    | ...   | 2     |\n| K\u00e1yath    | ...    | ...   | 5     |\n| Sayyad    | ...    | ...   | 23    |\n| Shekh     | ...    | ...   | 18    |\n| Path\u00e1n    | ...    | ...   | 23    |\n| **Total** | **...**| **48**| **72**| **120**|\n\nThe 48 taluqdari villages belong to the R\u00e1mpur estate of R\u00e1ja Hanwant Singh. The remainder of the pargana almost entirely belongs to Musalmans.\n\nM\u00e1nikpur is said to have been founded by M\u00e1n Deo, a younger son of R\u00e1ja B\u00e1\u00ed Deo of Kanauj; it was then called M\u00e1npur. It is not the least likely that it continued under the dominion of Kanauj for any length of time. When the Buddhist pilgrim, Hwen Thsang, visited Oudh in the seventh century, M\u00e1nikpur must have been in the kingdom of Aya Mukhi; at any rate it was not under Kanauj.\n\nThe account given in the Partabgarh settlement report must be corrected in several particulars. In the first place, M\u00e1nik Chand cannot have been a step-brother of Jai Chand, for the former was a Gahilw\u00e1r, the latter a R\u00e1th\u00f3r; nor did the Gahilw\u00e1rs fly to \u00c1rgal as stated by Mr. Carney; that place was and is the seat of the Gautams; M\u00e1nik Chand\u2019s relatives fled to Mirzapur where they still are; there are 2,400 Gahilw\u00e1rs in Mirzapur.*\n\nSir Henry Elliot considers that the Gahilw\u00e1rs preceded the five R\u00e1th\u00f3r r\u00e1j\u00e1s of Kanauj on the throne of that empire. The following is the translation of an Urdu passage from the \u201cTaw\u00e1r\u00edkh-i-Partabgarh,\u201d compiled by the Extra Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Ism\u00e1\u00edl for Gazetteer purposes.\n\nAbout 50 years after the death of R\u00e1ja Bhoj, successor of Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt, says the \u201cT\u00e1rikh-i-Farishta,\u201d there was a king of Kanauj named B\u00e1\u00ed Deo. It occurred during his reign that Bahr\u00e1m Gor, a king of Persia, disguised\n\n*\u201cSherring\u2019s Hindu Tribes.\u201d\nhimself and came to Kanauj to study the state of the Indian government. There he found that an elephant had broken loose, and in the attempt to capture it, it had killed some men. The king of \u00cdr\u00e1n then shot the animal, and by this act of heroism was discovered by the king of Kanauj, who cordially welcomed him, seated him on his own throne, bestowed on him the hand of his daughter, and immense wealth, and bade them adieu with all possible marks of honour and affection.\n\nR\u00e1ja B\u00e1\u015b Deo on his death left two sons, who both of them fought for the succession, and lost their lives. R\u00e1m Deo, the general of the late r\u00e1ja\u2019s army, who had through his influence secured the confidence of the army, usurped the throne of Kanauj, bestowing on his brother, M\u00e1n Deo, the estate of M\u00e1nipur, which was in after days called M\u00e1nikpur by R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand.\n\nM\u00e1n Deo was a very powerful r\u00e1ja, who obtained tributes from many other chiefs, and his descendants retained the sovereignty for some time.\n\nIn 409 A.H., 1018 A.D., says \u201cFarishta,\u201d the throne of Kanauj was filled up by R\u00e1ja Kora, but the name in \u201cElphinstone\u201d and other authorities appears to be Kunwar R\u00e1e. This r\u00e1ja was very subservient to Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, and became at last a convert to Isl\u00e1mism. All the neighbouring chiefs entertained ill-will towards him on that account, and the K\u00e1l\u00ednjar chief marching to fight him, and the Kanauj r\u00e1ja failing to receive the Moslem aid in time, fell desperately in battle.\n\nR\u00e1ja Jai Chand was a member of R\u00e1m Deo\u2019s family, and his ancestor succeeded at the close of the Kunwar R\u00e1e\u2019s line. R\u00e1ja Jai Chand, on his accession to the r\u00e1j, granted the following il\u00e1qas to his step-brother R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand:\n\n1. Pargana M\u00e1nipur or M\u00e1nikpur.\n2. Arwar or Partabgarh.\n3. Bhalw\u00e1l (known as Kal\u00e1l), situated on the Sultanpur and Lucknow road.\n4. Thulendi, in Rae Bareli.\n5. Bilkhar or Patti Dal\u00edppur.\n6. J\u00e1lia.\n7. Dalmau.\n8. Rae Bareli.\n9. Salon.\n10. Bajhat or Parasr\u00e1mpur, taluqa of Dar\u00edapur, pargana Patti.\n11. Kot (not identified).\n12. Chanh\u00e1ri.\n13. Mirzapur Chanh\u00e1ri.\n14. R\u00e1epur.\n\nSayyad Qutb-ud-d\u00edn fought a battle with R\u00e1ja Jai Chand and conquered Kanauj; the latter sought refuge in the fort of Karra, and his brother M\u00e1nik Chand in that of M\u00e1nikpur. The Moslems pursuing them divided their forces into two detachments, and sent one under Qi\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, the son of Qutb-ud-d\u00edn, to subdue M\u00e1nikpur, while Qutb-ud-d\u00edn himself remained at Karra. Two months\u2019 war swept away thousands both of the besiegers and of the besieged, but at last the r\u00e1jas of both of the places took their families with them, left their forts, and retreated towards the south into some mountainous region. The \u201cTazkirat-us-S\u00e1d\u00e1t\u201d says, that Qutb-ud-d\u00edn \u00cdb\u00e1k, the Governor of Oudh, also came to assist the Moslems in the conquest of these forts.\nThe following is drawn from the settlement report:\n\nBefore commencing a really reliable history of M\u00e1nikpur, which I have been enabled at last to compile with the aid of various materials, I will transcribe my predecessor's notes on the Muhammadan settlement of the pargana.\n\n\"Muhammadan settlements.\u2014The settlement of the Sayyads, Shekhs, and Path\u00e1ns in the country is connected with the semi-mythic stories of R\u00e1ja Jai Chand and R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand, two sovereigns of Kanauj, when they came eastward to avoid the dominion of the Musalmans, who were then pushing their way into that part of Hindustan. I will not detail the stories of the loves of the daughter of Jai Chand and King Pithora. Suffice it to say, that tradition asks us to believe that Jai Chand migrated to Karra, and built there the fort still visible on the Ganges in the Allahabad district. M\u00e1nik Chand, his brother, went across the river and built his fort at M\u00e1nikpur within sight of the paternal castle.\"\n\n\"Sayyad Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn and R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand.\u2014In these days a Sayyad, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn of Gardez in Persia, came to Delhi. He found employment in the not uncommon duty of being commissioned to kill somebody. This somebody was M\u00e1nik Chand. It is time to believe the account, which says that he met and killed his enemy in battle, and we should prefer the story that in his first attempt he failed miserably, and returned to Delhi to accomplish by fraud what could not be done by force. He caused 2,000 large camel trunks to be made to hold two men each. He sought allies among some Path\u00e1ns of D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n, a city in his country. In the guise of a merchant he wandered to M\u00e1nikpur, and begged to show his wares to the r\u00e1ja. The result may be guessed. Out leaped the 4,000 concealed heroes, like the Greeks from Trojan (why not Grecian horse), and rivers of blood flowed in the r\u00e1ja's castle, till the r\u00e1ja himself was slain and his force overpowered. Shahab-ud-d\u00edn reigned in his stead, and a place near M\u00e1nikpur, called Sh\u00e1hab\u00e1d, testifies to his former existence.\"\n\n\"D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00ed Path\u00e1n.\u2014The D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds and the Sayyads (having cemented their alliance in the blood of Hindus) were firm friends, and their chief instituted a vast mess or rotatory system of mutual entertainments, at which (saith the chronicler) 989 palanquins might be seen collected at the door of the entertainer. At one of these festivals given by a D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00ed,* a Darveah Makhd\u00e1m, the world-wide wanderer (Jah\u00e1n\u00edan Jah\u00e1ngasht), came and asked for food. They jeeringly bade him wait till the occupants of the 989 palanquins had been served. Some Sayyads treated him better, and the blessing of the darvesh was poured on his hospitable entertainers, and after oriental fashion, dating from the days of Isaac, father of Esau and Jacob, he prophesied all good of his hosts. He is said to have originated the title of r\u00e1ja, which is still borne by the chief Sayyads of M\u00e1nikpur, R\u00e1ja Ash\u00far \u00c1li and R\u00e1ja Taashshuq Husen. From this date the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds decreased, and of the former none are to be found in M\u00e1nikpur, where it is said no one of the family can go without suffering from a headache (!). Two families of this tribe are still living in Latifpur of pargana R\u00e1mpur, but they are not zamindars.\"\n\n* This saint's darg\u00e1h or maqbara (I do not know which) is said to be at Kachoucha in Fyzabad, and in Aghan it is a place of resort to pilgrims.\n\"**Shekhs.**\u2014These are said to have come with Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, of Bahaich notoriety and sanctity, a nephew of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni, who came into India to kill or convert, or both, the followers of Hinduism. These Shekhs are to be found in Nid\u00fara and Bachind\u00e1mau, G\u00fajwar, and Bar\u00e1i. I will not pursue their annals further. Those concerned with the land tenures of the tahsil can follow the clue which will show their present possession.\"\n\n\"**Path\u00e1ns.**\u2014These live mainly at Gutni and its neighbourhood. They are comparatively recent arrivals of some 165 years back; Shah\u00e1b Khan, a K\u00e1b\u00fal horse-dealer, having been their progenitor. Their zamindari tenure is said to have been acquired by purchase from the Gardezi owners of M\u00e1nikpur.\"\n\n\"**Religious endowment.**\u2014There is a well known religious endowment at M\u00e1nikpur held by Shekhs. Their progenitor is said to have been Muhammad Ism\u00e1\u00edl Darvesh, who came in with Shah\u00e1b Qutb-ud-d\u00edn 661 years ago. Pleased with the site of M\u00e1nikpur, he got a grant of 60 bighas of land known as the Ah\u00e1ta-i-Kh\u00e1nq\u00e1h or religious brothers' college. His successors still inhabit this place. The Emperor Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, who reigned in 1530 A.D., conferred five villages\u2014Sultanpur, B\u00e1zipur, R\u00e1napati, Kar\u00edmnagar Kal\u00e1n, and Kar\u00edmnagar Khurd\u2014on the brotherhood. Other grants were subsequently acquired, and they hold a village in Salon called R\u00e1japur. Their revenues may be put at Rs. 2,500 per annum at least; they are probably nearer Rs. 3,000.\"\n\nA few particulars may be added to the above sketch drawn from Captain Forbes' settlement report.\n\n**Attack on M\u00e1nikpur by Mahm\u00fad's Generals.**\u2014To resume the thread of actual history. In the *Mira-at-i-Masasdi* it is recorded that during the reign of Sult\u00e1n Mahm\u00fad Ghaznavi, M\u00e1nikpur was attacked by a detachment of the army sent by Mahm\u00fad under his brother-in-law S\u00e1l\u00e1r S\u00e1h\u00fa, and his nephew (son of S\u00e1l\u00e1r S\u00e1h\u00fa) Mas\u00e1ud, also called Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r, to invade Oudh. The event was brought about in the following manner:\u2014At the time the invading force was encamped at Satr\u00edkh, a place about sixteen miles east of Lucknow, the r\u00e1s\u00e9s (influential residents) of M\u00e1nikpur despatched a barber to the force with instructions to obtain an introduction to Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r Mas\u00e1ud, and to offer his services. In the event of these preliminaries being successful, he was to wound the commander in the finger with a poisoned nail-trimmer, with the object of causing his death. Arrived at Satr\u00edkh, the barber lost no time in carrying out his instructions, but although he succeeded in inflicting a wound in Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r's finger, the result was not what had been fondly and charitably anticipated. The puncture eventually healed up, but for a time it caused intense pain; so much so that the barber being suspected was seized, and made to confess the whole plot. Whereupon Sayyad S\u00e1l\u00e1r at once despatched two sard\u00e1rs, Malik Qutub Haidar and Malik Im\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, with a force to avenge the deed. An engagement took place in which Malik Qutub Haidar lost his life, and in which, though attended with heavy losses on both sides, victory did not declare plainly for either party. To a great extent, however, the Muhammadan may be said to have sustained\na reverse, as they were obliged to retire without having fully accomplished their object, and with one of their Generals left dead on the field. This action probably took place on the land (formerly a part of M\u00e1nikpur, but) now known as mauza Chauk\u00e1p\u00e1rpur, and the tomb of Malik Qut\u00fab H\u00e1idar is still pointed out.\n\nFlight of Jai Chand and M\u00e1nik Chand.\u2014From the archives of the M\u00e1nda family, it appears that Jai Chand and M\u00e1nik Chand fled to Kant\u00edth,* a tract of country lying under the Vindya range to the north-east of the Rewa State. We have thus arrived at the period when M\u00e1nikpur ceased to belong to the Hindus, and when it first became a Musalman province. This period was about the end of the year 590 Hijri (1194 A.D.). M\u00e1nikpur may be stated to be one of the earliest, if not the earliest, Muhammadan settlement in Oudh.\n\nThe D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds.\u2014Accompanying the forces of Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Ib\u00e1k were a sect called D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds. They were Shekhs, and originally came from D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n, a town in the Ghor country. These D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds were a martial race, and to a great extent furnished the picked troops of the reigning sovereign. After the capture of Karra and M\u00e1nikpur, Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Ib\u00e1k made over the government of the former to his 'P\u00edr,' Sayyad Qutb-ud-d\u00edn; and for the better security of the latter against any subsequent attempts on the part of the Hindus to re-take it, he determined to leave it in the hands of his D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds. To secure their due support and maintenance, he made over to them the whole of the M\u00e1nikpur estates in j\u00e1g\u00edr (revenue free). After Qutb-ud-d\u00edn Ib\u00e1k's death these D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds greatly degenerated, abandoning themselves to every species of excess and luxury; from being an active and military race they soon became indolent and effeminate. The j\u00e1g\u00edr also was about this time resumed, but they continued in possession of their estates as m\u00e1lguz\u00e1s (revenue payers). Many were the houses erected by the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds, and rapidly did they multiply. The portion of M\u00e1nikpur formerly occupied by them is now known as Chaukap\u00e1rpur, and has been constituted into a separate mauza (township). The old site of the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00ed town shows the extensive area which was at one time in their possession. There are still numerous ruins of handsome masonry buildings and spacious tombs. At the same time much has been cleared away, and the ground brought under the plough. It was at the close of the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq (A.D. 1348-49) that the power of the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds was at its summit. After this period it rapidly waned, as will be described hereafter, following the due course of events.\n\nState of affairs at the close of the 12th century.\u2014\"At the close of the twelfth century, the Ganges,\" writes Elphinstone, \"had long ceased to be an obstacle to the ambitious designs of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn. At this very period Qutb-ud-d\u00edn was waited on by Muhammad Bakhti\u00e1r Khilji, who had already conquered part of Oudh and north Beh\u00e1r.\"\n\n* Pargana Kant\u00edth, in the Mirzapur district. Il\u00e1qa Kant\u00edth formerly included the estates of [M\u00e1nda, Barankhar, Doya] [Saktigarh, Bijalpur] and [Kera Mongror.] Allahabad. Mirzapur. Benares.\nIt was of the first importance to take proper measures to protect the two strongholds of Karra and M\u00e1nikpur, which, situated as they were on opposite sides of the river, entirely commanded its passage; and we find in the subsequent narrative that the matter was regarded in this light, and that the government was nearly always conferred on a prince of the blood, or on some other eminent personage. The tract of country comprised within the Karra M\u00e1nikpur command, about this time, appears to have possessed much the same limits which it did previously when under the rule of the Gharw\u00e1r Chieftain, M\u00e1nik Chand, a few of the component muh\u00e1ls only having changed their names.\n\nArsal\u00e1n Khan and Kh\u00e1l\u00edj Khan, Governors of Karra M\u00e1nikpur in A.D. 1253.\u2014We now come to the next important scene in our historical drama. The event is briefly alluded to by Elphinstone as the expedition undertaken during the reign of the literary Slave-King N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn against the revolted Governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur. This event took place in the year 656 Hijri (A.D. 1253). Farishta mentions that Arsal\u00e1n Khan and Kh\u00e1l\u00edj Khan were in command at Karra M\u00e1nikpur when they raised the standard of revolt. King N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn came down in person and called upon them to surrender. The rebels sent word in reply that if the king pledged his word that they should not be punished they would attend his presence. The king furnished the requisite pledge, and forthwith the delinquents appeared before him. Arsal\u00e1n Khan was then deputed to the rulership of Lakhnauti,* and Kh\u00e1l\u00edj Khan to Koh P\u00e1ya in the Saw\u00e1l\u00edk range. It is not stated, however, who these two worthies were, or whether they exercised a joint or independent command. I am inclined to the latter view and to the opinion that Kh\u00e1l\u00edj Khan as probable ruler of M\u00e1nikpur was a D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00ed. His removal was no doubt prompted by cogent political reasons, as the sect was fast becoming a powerful and influential one. Who succeeded him and his ally at Karra we are not informed.\n\nRevolt of Malik Jh\u00e1ju, Governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur.\u2014From this time, however, it appears that the two commands were united in one, and having regard to the position of Malik Jh\u00e1ju and Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, both nephews of sovereigns, it is clear that the new command was not only one of great political and strategic importance, but was held in high estimation, and a coveted post. Early in the reign of the septuagenarian king, Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, Malik Jh\u00e1ju, nephew of the despicable Ghay\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn Balban, was Governor of Karra. At this period \u00c1mir Ali, also styled H\u00e1tim Khan, and who had previously held the post of \"M\u00edr J\u00e1md\u00e9r,\" or controller of the royal household, was Governor of Oudh. Supported by the latter, Malik Jh\u00e1ju ordered coins to be struck in his own name, styling himself Mogh\u00eds-ud-d\u00edn, and assumed the emblems of Royalty. Soon after, being \"joined by all the adherents of the house of Balban,\" he commenced his march towards Delhi. Hearing of these proceedings, the king despatched his second son, Araq Ali Khan, to oppose him. A pitched battle took place, which resulted in M\u00e1l\u00edk Jh\u00e1ju and his principal officers being all made prisoners. \"Displaying his usual clemency, in the words of Elphinstone, the king imme-\n\n* Now known as Tanda in the Fyzabad district.\ndately released them all, and sent Malik Jh\u00e1ju to Mooltan, where he allowed him a liberal establishment for the rest of his days.\" These events occurred about 689-90 Hijri (A.D., 1290-91).\n\nJal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn then appointed his own nephew (Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn) to the vacant Governorship of Karra, and shortly afterwards bestowed on him in addition the government of Oudh. Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn, however continued to reside in Karra, and to make it his headquarters, so that for a time at least the Oudh Government may be said to have been administered from M\u00e1nikpur.\n\nThe murder of Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn (A.D., 1295), one of the most affecting incidents in the history of India, need not be related here: it took place at M\u00e1nikpur, and added a dark tragedy to the romantic annals of the spot.\n\nThe Gardezis.\u2014Before proceeding further, it is necessary to introduce on the scene a sect famous for their religious tenets, and whose mission was the world wide dissemination of these tenets, I refer to the Gardezis. Their progenitors in India were two brothers, Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn and Shams-ud-d\u00edn, men of high family, who came from Gardez in the reign of Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh\u2014i.e., between 607 and 633 Hijri (A.D. 1211 and 1236). The elder brother, Shams-ud-d\u00edn, settled in Rewa; while the younger, proceeding further south, took up his abode in M\u00e1nikpur in obedience to the divine direction vouchsafed to him in a vision.\n\nMaul\u00e1na Ism\u00e1\u00edl Qureshi.\u2014During the same reign there also came to M\u00e1nikpur from Yaman a certain individual named Maul\u00e1na Ism\u00e1\u00edl Qureshi, said to have been a direct descendant of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm-bin-Adam, king of Balkh and Bokh\u00e1ra, who again is said to be directly descended from the second Khal\u00edf\u00e1 Umar, surnamed Farr\u00fakh. The present Musalman inhabitants of M\u00e1nikpur and the vicinity all trace their origin to the early settlers of the three sects of D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds, Gardezis, and Makhd\u00fam-z\u00e1das. There are a few Path\u00e1n families, but these are comparatively recent settlers. With a very small exception all are of the Sunni persuasion, and have always been so.\n\nMakhd\u00fam Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n Jah\u00e1ngasht and the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds.\u2014There is nothing now to chronicle until we reach the year 795 Hijri (A.D. 1393). In which year during the reign of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Tughlaq, son of F\u00edroz (also styled Muhammad Shah), there arrived at M\u00e1nikpur a personage named Sayyad Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, who is better known as Makhd\u00fam Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n Jah\u00e1ngasht.* This individual is reported to have been a saint of the first water, and had been sent for from A\u00f3ch near Lahore, to soothe the last moments of the dying Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn of Bengal, and to perform his funeral obsequies. Having discharged these duties, the holy man went to the court of Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n, king of Jaunpur, where he received as his disciple the famous Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Sharqi, brother of Mub\u00e1rak Shah, the adopted son of Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n. From Jaunpur Makhd\u00fam Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n travelled up to M\u00e1nikpur, and arrived in the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds' mukhalla or quarter on the great \u00cdd-ul-fitr. Proceeding to the mosque for the purpose of prayer, he\n\n* Or \"world-wide traveller.\"\nwaited in vain for the performance of the religious services of the day. Astonished, and not well pleased at such a state of things, he enquired why prayers were delayed. He was informed in reply that there were a great number of D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds resident in the muhalla, and that until all were assembled prayers could not take place; in other words that the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds were not going to trouble themselves in the matter. Upon this the saint remarked that it was clear that malak-ul-maut, or the angel of death, had visited the town, which was tantamount to the utterance of a curse from the lips of so holy a man. From that day, it is said, that numbers of D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00eds were seized with a mortal sickness, the most distressing symptom of which was excruciating pains in the head, which, accompanied by fever, carried off thousands. Panic-stricken the survivors fled from M\u00e1nikpur, and neither they nor their successors have since resided in the place.\n\nMakhd\u00edm Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n Jah\u00e1ngasht and the Gardezis.\u2014After leaving the D\u00e1mgh\u00e1n\u00ed quarter of the town, Makhd\u00edm Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n Jah\u00e1ngasht went to the muhalla of the Gardezis. Here he was hospitably received by Sayyad Az\u00edz-ud-d\u00edn and Sayyad Sharf-ud-d\u00edn, descendants of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi. Perceiving that his hosts wore the dress of the religious brotherhood, while their kinsmen and others were clad as soldiers and carried arms, the saint asked why the latter were thus dressed in place of the quieter garments of sanctity. The reply was that, harassed by the attacks of neighbouring r\u00e1jas, they were forced in self-defence to organize a system of military defence. Thereupon the saint turned to Az\u00edz-ud-d\u00edn and said:\u2014\"From this day forth you are invested with the title of r\u00e1ja of this country,\" and turning to Sharf-ud-d\u00edn, he said:\u2014\"And you will bear the rank of q\u00e1zi.\" To both of them he added that so long as they and their descendants walked uprightly, their respective dignities should be transmitted from generation to generation. It is commonly reported, but there is no documentary evidence to corroborate the assertion, that on leaving M\u00e1nikpur, Makhd\u00edm Jah\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n was accompanied by the recently dubbed r\u00e1ja and q\u00e1zi as far as Partabgarh n\u00e1la. On taking leave of them at this place, the saint informed them that their respective government and jurisdiction should extend so far. From this time the Gardezis increased in power and influence. It was in this year 802 Hijri (A.D. 1400), during the time of Tamerlane, that the provinces of Oudh, Kanauj, and Karra M\u00e1nikpur were attached to the kingdom of Jaunpur under Khw\u00e1ja Jah\u00e1n.\n\nIn 1480, the empire of Jaunpur was overturned by Bahlol Lodi, and M\u00e1nikpur passed under the sovereignty of Delhi. In this contest between the two kingdoms, the Hindus of Oudh, disgusted with the persecution to which they had been subjected by the priest-ridden kings of the east, yielded valuable assistance to Bahlol Lodi. Tilok Chand, the Bais Chief, probably laid the foundation of his greatness when he aided Bahlol Lodi by pointing out the fords over the Jumna at K\u00e1lpi.\n\nBahlol Lodi died about 1488, having prior to his death divided his dominions\u2014Jaunpur to his eldest son B\u00e1ibak, Bahraich to his nephew K\u00e1la Pah\u00e1r, and Delhi to his younger son Sikandar Lodi. The latter claimed\nthe suzerainty, the coinage, and the khutba.* After a furious battle between Sikandar Lodi on one side, K\u00e1la Pah\u00e1r and Baib\u00e1k on the other, which seems to have been won by the emperor's politeness and politic clemency to the saintly K\u00e1la Pah\u00e1r, Jaunpur again passed under the dominion of Delhi, although Baib\u00e1k kept that province as governor, and one son, Sher Khan, was in charge of M\u00e1nikpur, another, Mub\u00e1rak Khan, of Dalmau.\n\nThe taluqdars who had formerly joined the Delhi kings against the Sharqi of Jaunpur now were willing to change sides. They rose in one body, and were aided by Rae Bhed of Betia in Bundelkhand. The brunt of the attack fell upon M\u00e1nikpur, whence Sher Khan was said to have exercised great oppression. He was captured and killed; his brother Mub\u00e1rak captured but spared.\n\nAfter several other risings and battles, diversified by the marriage of the emperor to (Sher Khan) his nephew's widow, by the dethronement of Baib\u00e1k, by the hunting excursions of Sikandar in Oudh or Ajodhya, and by the refusal of the R\u00e1ja of Betia to give his daughter in marriage to the emperor, the rebellion was finally crushed.\n\nNot yet, however, were the evil results of BahloL Lodi's division of his dominions to cease. The emperor had bequeathed a part of his dominions (K\u00e1lpi) to Khan Jah\u00e1n, a relative. His son, Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, had yielded to Sikandar Lodi, and been made Governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur, when Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, a jealous and cruel monarch, ascended the throne. Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan had favoured the rival candidate, Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn; he had again deserted him and been received with open arms, but it was not forgotten that he had himself once reigned as a king, and his loyalty as a subject was questioned.\n\nAzam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Sherw\u00e1n\u00ed, Governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur.\u2014In the year 932 Hijri (A.D. 1526), during the reign of Sikandar Lodi's son and successor, Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi, Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Sherw\u00e1n\u00ed (to whom reference has already been made above), Am\u00edr-ul-Umra, or Generalissimo of the forces, was stationed at Karra M\u00e1nikpur. At this time he received the king's command to reduce the fortress of Gwalior, and to take prisoner the R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh. Accordingly he set out from Karra M\u00e1nikpur with 30,000 troops and 300 elephants. The king at the same time despatched to Gwalior another large force, under eight generals, to support him. The combined forces, having taken up their position under the walls of the fortress, commenced the assault. At this juncture the raja died, but his son, Bikram\u00e1jit, took his place and continued to defend the town with the utmost energy. Failing in his endeavours to get in by assault, Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan laid a train of gunpowder, and opened a breach in the wall. Just as victory was about to declare itself for the besiegers, the king listening to the tales of treachery poured into his ear by Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan's enemies, was persuaded to suddenly recall him. The commander, with his son Fateh Khan, presented themselves before the king at Agra, when both were at once cast into prison. Before leaving, however, Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan had appointed his younger son, Isl\u00e1m Khan, to take his place, and rule in Karra Manikpur. Hearing of this, the king sent Ahmad Khan, one of\n\n* Prayer for the ruler of the country.\nhis generals, with an army to depose Isl\u00e1m Khan. But the latter, now openly rebelling, prepared to assert his independence. An engagement ensued, in which the king's forces were routed, and Ahmad Khan put to flight. Meanwhile the hitherto impregnable fortress of Gwalior had at last been reduced, and now the king was at liberty to draw off his troops and proceed with sufficient forces to punish the rebellious Isl\u00e1m Khan at Karra M\u00e1nikpur.\n\nAzam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Lodi and Sa\u00edd Khan Lodi.\u2014With the army before Gwalior were Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Lodi and Sa\u00edd Khan Lodi, younger sons of Prince Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Lodi, former governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur, and no sooner were these young nobles made aware of the king's intentions, then fearing his caprice, and alarmed lest they too, like Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Sherw\u00e1n\u00ed, should incur his suspicions, they left the army and proceeded to Lucknow, where they were possessed of certain j\u00e1g\u00edrs. Thence they sent word to Isl\u00e1m Khan at Karra M\u00e1nikpur to be of good courage, for that they intended to support him. Meanwhile Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm Lodi despatched Ahmad Khan with a new army and a numerous staff for the coercion of the rebel Isl\u00e1m. Arrived at B\u00e1ngarmanu, a place in the Unao district, about 108 miles from M\u00e1nikpur, the force was suddenly attacked in the dead of night by Iqb\u00e1l Khan, a slave of Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Lodi, who, with 5,000 horse, fell upon the camp, and, after considerable havoc, killing and wounding in every direction, made off safely under cover of the darkness and confusion. Hearing of this second disaster, the king was infuriated, and despatching a further reinforcement of 40,000 horse, he sent word to his generals that if they did not now very speedily conquer Isl\u00e1m Khan, he would regard them as traitors themselves, for it was evident that they were not fighting with a will.\n\nAt last the rival forces encountered each other, and a battle was imminent. At this moment, a Pirz\u00edda, named Shekh Rajj\u00fa Bokh\u00e1ri, of the line of the famous Sayyad Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn, or Makhd\u00fam Jah\u00e1ni\u00e1n Jahangasht, placed himself between the two armies, and entreated them to avoid bloodshed, and listening to the dictates of humanity, to settle their differences amicably. Thereupon Isl\u00e1m Khan proclaimed aloud that if the king would only release his father, Azam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan Sherw\u00e1n\u00ed, he was ready to withdraw from the field. An armistice being agreed upon, Isl\u00e1m Khan's proposal was transmitted to the king. True to his tyrannical character, however, the king refused compliance with the conditions offered by Isl\u00e1m, and at the same time sent word to Day\u00e1 Khan Loh\u00e1ni, Governor of Beh\u00e1r, N\u00e1sir Khan Loh\u00e1ni, and others, to effect by any means the submission of Isl\u00e1m Khan. A battle ensued, and the rebels (if they may be so called) were defeated; Karra M\u00e1nikpur being re-annexed to the empire. This contest was really one between the emperor and his cousins, who claimed their share in the inheritance. M\u00e1nikpur was now at the height of its prosperity. During the whole government of the Lodi it was governed by a prince of the blood, and was some time the residence of the Am\u00edr-ul-Umra or prime-minister.\n\nSult\u00e1n Janed Birlas, the patron of Sher Khan, was the Governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur during the first year of the Mughal Dynasty, and then the\nfierce Path\u00e1n hatched another of those rebellions with which the history of M\u00e1nikpur is rife. We pass over the rebellion of the Afgh\u00e1n chiefs, the defeat of Hum\u00e1y\u00fan, and other matters which belong to the history of India.\n\nMarriage of the king's daughter with Shah Q\u00e1sim of M\u00e1nikpur.\u2014The next year, 937 Hijri (A.D. 1540), Sher Shah was informed that Khizr Khan Sherw\u00e1n\u00ed, his deputy in the government of Bengal, had contracted a marriage with the daughter of his old enemy, Mahm\u00fad Shah, and late king of Bengal, and, besides other signs of disaffection, that he had openly commenced to assert his independence. Sher Shah determined at once to set out for Bengal, and on his way thither he encamped at Karra, where he married his daughter, the Princess Bibi S\u00e1leha, to Shah Q\u00e1sim, a descendant of the celebrated His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, and, at the same time, desired his son-in-law to accompany him on his expedition to Bengal. Shah Q\u00e1sim, however, excused himself on the score of his religious duties, but he recommended to the king's favourable notice a person of unblameable life and one like-minded with himself, Q\u00e1zi Fazl. Accordingly Sher Shah, accompanied by Q\u00e1zi Fazl, set out for Gaur. The rebellious Khizr Khan was seized and imprisoned, and the territory of Bengal being split up into several small governorships, Q\u00e1zi Fazl was appointed by the king to act as governor-general.\n\nTomb of the Princess.\u2014The Princess Bibi S\u00e1leha, alias Sulaiman Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, died at M\u00e1nikpur, where her tomb, and that of her husband, are to be seen carefully preserved in the \"Ah\u00e1ta-i-Khanq\u00e1h.\"\n\nIn 1563, under Akbar, Karra M\u00e1nikpur was given to Kam\u00e1l Khan, to guard it as a frontier post against the rebellious chief of Jaunpur.\n\nIn 1564 he was removed, and the famous \u00c1saf Khan was appointed lord of M\u00e1nikpur. In 1565 he moved to the south to Garra just as Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn had marched from M\u00e1nikpur to the conquest of the Dekkan, and \u00c1zam Hum\u00e1y\u00fan to Gwalior, and just as success and vast plunder had inspired those chiefs with the idea of rebellion, so did the conquest of Garra near Jubbalpore, with its heroic queen and 1,500 elephants, tempt \u00c1saf Khan to treason. He joined with Zam\u00e1n Khan, Bah\u00e1dur Khan, and others in a rebellion which lasted for seven years, and which was the last serious attempt to revive the ancient sovereignty of Jaunpur. The close of the struggle occurred at M\u00e1nikpur.\n\nThe emperor was at Agra when he heard that the rebels were besieging M\u00e1nikpur. He marched at once, crossed at Kanauj, and continued to advance rapidly and reached Rae Bareli. Alarmed at such promptitude, as well as by the rumours of the vast force accompanying Akbar, the rebels raised the siege, and crossing the river encamped on the opposite shore. When Akbar arrived at M\u00e1nikpur it was night; not a boat was to be had; and being the rainy season the river was fearfully swollen. Nothing daunted, and mounted on his famous elephant, Sundar (the beautiful) he\nplunged into the Ganges accompanied by only a squadron of horse. A rumour was soon afloat in the enemy's camp that Akbar had crossed the river and was on them. Khan Zam\u00e1n and his chieftains, who were in the midst of their revels, and probably more than half in their cups, ridiculed the idea, and refused to entertain the notion for a moment. This enabled Akbar to lie perdu till daybreak, when, having been reinforced by his advance guard, and by the respective troops of Majn\u00fan K\u00e1kshal and Asaf Khan,* he fell upon the hostile camp. The rebels, quite unprepared for so vigorous an onslaught, were utterly routed and dispersed. Khan Zam\u00e1n was killed in action by an elephant, who dashed him to the ground with his trunk and trampled him to death, while his brother, Bah\u00e1dur Khan, was taken prisoner. Brought before Akbar, there is every reason to believe that his life would yet have been spared, but so infuriated were the bystanders, that before Akbar could interpose, Bah\u00e1dur Khan lay a corpse at his feet.\u2020 Thus terminated, we may say at M\u00e1nikpur, this famous seven years' rebellion of the Uzbak chiefs.\n\nDivision of the empire into subahs.\u2014Before the close of the glorious reign of Akbar the empire was divided into fifteen subahs or provinces\u2014viz., Allahabad, Agra, Oudh, Ajmere, Gujar\u00e1t, Beh\u00e1r, Bengal, Delhi, K\u00e1b\u00fal, Lahore, Mooltan, M\u00e1lwa, Ber\u00e1r, K\u00e1ndeish, and Ahmadnagar. This arrangement diminished the importance of M\u00e1nikpur, which was thenceforward included in subah Allahabad, as one of its component sark\u00e1rs. Mr. King has been at the pains of furnishing an extract from the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari, which in a somewhat more detailed form, together with his accompanying remarks, I shall make no apology for introducing here, as they fitly pertain to a history of so celebrated a place as M\u00e1nikpur, which was formerly the most important town of the district, if not of the province.\n\nExtract from Mr. King's report.\u2014\"A reference to Elliott's glossary, under the word 'dast\u00far,' will show that so recently as Akbar's time many parganas existed which cannot be traced now; and that many now exist which are not named in the various sark\u00e1rs into which that emperor divided his dominions.\n\n\"The glossary omits detailed mention of all lands which were not British territory at the time when the author wrote; and this will account for the absence of the Sark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur, which embraced all the land now in the Partabgarh district.\n\n\"A manuscript copy of the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari has enabled me to give some details of the territorial division in Akbar's time:\n\n\"Extract from the \u00c1\u00edn-i-Akbari which relates to the revenue arrangements of the Partabgarh district, Sark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur, Subah Allahabad.\n\n* It is doubtful whether Asaf Khan was with Majn\u00fan K\u00e1kshal within the walls of M\u00e1nikpur when it was besieged. It seems more probable that he was at that time resident at Karra.\n\n\u2020 The heads of the two brothers were sent to the Punj\u00e1b and K\u00e1bul, and the bodies to Jaunpur, in which city they were dragged through the streets tied to the legs of an elephant.\n\"The Subah of Allahabad contained nine sark\u00e1rs as under:\n\n1.

Now, however, we find under Akbar's scheme of territorial distribution they are severed, and each becomes the capital of a distinct \"Sark\u00e1r,\"\u2014M\u00e1nikpur containing fourteen muh\u00e1ls and Karra twelve. The government of a sark\u00e1r henceforward became entrusted to a saujd\u00e1r, while the governor of a province or sabah became known as sip\u00e1h s\u00e1l\u00e1r or viceroy. The last governor of Karra M\u00e1nikpur, under the old regime, was Asaf Khan Harvi, who shortly after the final conquest of the Uzbaks, was removed by Akbar to the command of the fortress of Chittaur in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na.\n\nNawab Abdus Samad Khan Gardezi.\u2014During the reign of Akbar, Nawab Abdus Samad Khan, Gardezi, of M\u00e1nikpur, was appointed to the rank of mansabd\u00e1r, and appears to have been an extremely wealthy and influential man. From documents bearing his seal and signature, it seems clear that his functions were important and his powers extensive. He built several palatial residencies in M\u00e1nikpur, and founded the village of Samadabad, now included within the limits of mauza Chauk\u00e1ppur. Some of the edifices which this personage erected were of such rare beauty, and the stones employed in the building of such magnificent carving, that Nawab Asif-ud-daula, nearly two centuries after, removed considerable portions of them to Lucknow, where they now grace the large im\u00e1m-b\u00e1ra.\n\nThe reign of the Emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr.\u2014We may pass over the entire reign of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, 1014 to 1037 Hijri (A.D. 1605 to 1627) as presenting no noticeable incidents in connection with the history of M\u00e1nikpur. We may except the occasion of the pursuit by Shah Jah\u00e1n of prince Parvez and Mah\u00e1bat Khan in 1033 Hijri (A.D. 1624), when the latter, hearing of Shah Jah\u00e1n's \"arrival and rapid progress in Bengal, put themselves in motion in the direction of Allahabad.\" Shah Jah\u00e1n crossed the Ganges to meet them, but the people of the country, who were not inclined to enter opposition to the emperor, refused to bring in supplies to his camp, or to assist in keeping up his communication by means of the boats on the Ganges. The discouragement and privations which were the consequence of this state of things, led to the desertion of the new levies which Shah Jah\u00e1n had raised in Bengal; and when at last he came to an action with his opponents, he was easily overpowered. His army dispersed, and himself constrained once more to seek refuge in the Deccan.* Shah Jah\u00e1n on this occasion probably crossed from the Oudh bank not far from M\u00e1nikpur, at all events in the muh\u00e1l. The subsequent reign of Shah Jah\u00e1n also furnishes but little of interest. I find, however, from the \"B\u00e1deh\u00e1hnd\u00e1ma,\" a chronicle of this reign, to the effect that four mansabd\u00e1rs were appointed in M\u00e1nikpur by Shah Jah\u00e1n\u2014viz., R\u00e9je Sayyad Abdul Q\u00e1dir Khan, also styled \"M\u00edr Adal,\" whose \"mansab\" was 2,000, and who entertained 2,000 sawars; D\u00edv\u00e1n Sayyad Raza, whose mansab was 800, and who kept up 350 sawars; Sayyad Abdul H\u00e1m\u00edd M\u00e1nikpuri, mansab 500, entertained\n\n* Elphinstone's History of India, 5th Edn., page 566.\n500 sawars; Nawab Abdus Samad Khan, M\u00e1nikpuri, mansab 300, entertained 300 sawars.\n\nR\u00e1je Abdul Q\u00e1dir Khan alias \"M\u00edr Adal.\"\u2014Of these mansabdars, the first mentioned, R\u00e1je Sayyad Abdul Q\u00e1dir Khan alias \"M\u00edr Adal\" was the most noteworthy. He founded the town of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn-abad, contiguous to M\u00e1nikpur, and so named it after his ancestor Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi. As this happened also to be the emperor's name, it furnished Abdul Q\u00e1dir with an appropriate opportunity of doing seeming honour to his sovereign. Within this town he built several splendid edifices, of which the J\u00e1m\u00e1 Masjid, Sang Mahal (stone palace), Rangfn Mahal (coloured palace, also of stone), and the Chihal Sit\u00fan (or palace of forty pillars), are the most noteworthy. The stone of which these buildings were constructed was brought from Fatehpur S\u00edkri, where Abdul Q\u00e1dir purchased the quarry, and the enormous size of some of the slabs is truly astonishing, considering the distance from which they came. The buildings themselves, most of them, are now in a ruinous state, but nevertheless bear distinct evidences of their former splendour.\n\nThe Chihal Sit\u00fan.\u2014The \"Chihal Sit\u00fan\" in particular still retains many beautiful portions. The stone carvings are remarkably deep and well defined. This edifice overhangs the bank of the river, and one apartment has been entirely swept away with the encroachment of the current. At the time the Chihal Sit\u00fan was built, it was not permitted to subjects to build such residences. The emperor, Shah Jah\u00e1n, hearing that Abdul Q\u00e1dir had built a Chihal Sit\u00fan at M\u00e1nikpur, after the pattern of the one which he himself had erected at Agra, was by no means well pleased, and sent at once to demand an explanation. R\u00e1je Abdul Q\u00e1dir was, however, prepared with his reply, for on the arrival of the emissary he took him to the palace, and with much dignity of manner pointed out the last resting-place of departed members of his family. The emissary needed no more, and departed perfectly satisfied, and so, on his arrival at Agra, was his royal master. It is hardly necessary to observe that the tombs were a sham, and that the emperor was duped.\n\nD\u00edw\u00e1n Sayyad R\u00e1je.\u2014D\u00edw\u00e1n Sayyad R\u00e1je, the next mansabdar, was also a descendant of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn Gardezi, and a man of note at the period in which he lived. He appears to have held office as d\u00edw\u00e1n to the Bengal Government, and he built a fine sar\u00e1\u00e9 at Sasseram, and another at a place within the borders of the Benares district on the Karamn\u00e1s\u00e1 river, which stream forms the common boundary of the districts of Benares and Arrah. This place is now a large town, and still known by the name Sar\u00e1\u00e9 Sayyad R\u00e1je. The d\u00edw\u00e1n also added to his native town by the erection of several fine houses.\n\nThe other two mansabdars of this reign also contributed lustre to the town of M\u00e1nikpur by sundry embellishments, and by a lavish expenditure of their wealth.\n\n* The alteration of this title from H\u00e1ja to R\u00e1je is not quite intelligible. The reason advanced is that the title having been bestowed by a saint, and extending to each and every member of the family of the grantee, it was necessary to distinguish it from the title of R\u00e1je, which was originally conferred by sovereigns and was confined to one hereditary male member only.\nR\u0101je Sayyad Abdul Wahid.\u2014Another contemporary, though not a mansabdar; R\u0101je Sayyad Abdul Wahid founded the villages of Abdul Wahidganj and P\u0101hipur.\n\nShah Abdul Karim and the religious endowments at M\u0101nikpur.\u2014Of the Makhd\u016bmz\u0101das of this period, prominence must be given to Shah Abdul Karim, of the line of Shah Q\u0101sim, His\u0101m-ud-d\u012bn, and Maul\u0101na Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl Farrukhi, worthies who have all been previously noticed. This individual passed so high in the public estimation, that a book called the Ch\u0101r-Ak\u0101na was written to commemorate the events of his life. He is the founder of the Salon religious brotherhood, the endowment of which is at the present time under the management of Shah Husen At\u0101. When Sher Shah married his daughter to Shah Q\u0101sim, he settled on her the Sasseram J\u0101g\u012br, before setting forth on his expedition to Bengal. This J\u0101g\u012br had been enjoyed by the descendants of Shah Q\u0101sim down to the time of the subject of our present notice, Shah Abdul Karim. This painfully pious and self-mortifying man threw up the j\u0101g\u012br and tore up the title deed. His descendants in M\u0101nikpur at the present day are Shah Muhammad Ashiq, the Sajj\u0101da-nash\u012bn, Shah Muhammad Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl, secretary and treasurer of the endowment, Shah Muhammad Mohim, Sayyad Muhammad Abdul Hasan, and Shah Abdul Q\u0101dir. This quintett forms the only members of the brotherhood. The endowment consists of 10 villages which are held by the brotherhood under a perpetual revenue-free grant from the British Government, the gross rental of which yields them an annual income of Rs. 4,000.\n\nThe Rajput tribes.\u2014The surrounding country was at this time mainly peopled by the Bisens, whose condition, with that of other Rajput tribes, may be generally described in Elphinstone's words. \"The Rajputs, who at the time of Sult\u0101n Mahm\u016bd's invasion, were in possession of all the governments of India, sunk into the mass of the population as those governments were overturned, and no longer appeared as rulers, except in places where the strength of the country afforded some protection against the Musalman arms. Those on the Jumna and Ganges, and in general in all the completely conquered tracts, became what they are now, and though they still retained their high spirit and military figure, had adopted their habits to agriculture, and no longer aspired to a share in the government of the country.\"\n\nAurangzeb's visit to M\u0101nikpur.\u2014This brings us to the reign of Aurangzeb or Alamg\u012br. The long reign of this sovereign extended from 1068 Hijri to 1119 Hijri (A.D. 1658 to 1707). During this period he was constantly moving about in different portions of his empire. On one of these occasions, on his return from a tour through Oudh, necessitated by his suspicions regarding his lieutenant at Fyzabad, who was a K\u0101yath, and who, in the emperor's opinion, was far too tolerant of the Hindu religion and superstitions, Aurangzeb arrived at M\u0101nikpur one evening just in time to witness the appearance of the new moon, and to celebrate the festival of the Id-ul-Fitr. His army ran up a mosque in the course of the night,\n\n* Elphinstone's History of India, 5th Edn, page 479.\nand in it the emperor performed his devotions the next morning, and continued his march to Agra. This mosque may still be seen in the village of Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn-abad adjoining M\u00e1nikpur, though now beginning to fall into decay. It is called the Yak-shabi Masjid. The emperor returned via Rae Bareli, which was up to the time of Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula within the Sark\u00e1r of M\u00e1nikpur.\n\nMahantgir Gosh\u00e1\u00edn.\u2014Nothing worthy of record in connection with M\u00e1nikpur presents itself during the succeeding reigns of Bah\u00e1dur Shah Jah\u00e1ndar (alias Moizz-ud-d\u00edn) and Farruk Siar, and we thus come down to the time of the Emperor Muhammed Shah, who ascended the throne in 1131 Hijri (A.D. 1719), and who reigned till the year 1161 Hijri (A.D. 1748). In the year 1132 Hijri (A.D. 1720), a Hindu named Mahantgir Gosh\u00e1\u00edn was deputy governor of the Subah of Allahabad, and held office under Abdulla Khan, who, being Qutb-ul-mulk (one of the cabinet ministers) could not permanently reside at the seat of his government.* The deputy governor, Mahantgir Gosh\u00e1\u00edn, rebelled against the emperor's authority, who forthwith sent against him R\u00e1ja Ratan Chand, Sayyad Shah Ali Khan, and Muhammed Khan Bangash, with a sufficient force to coerce him. Arrived before the fort at Allahabad, the Mahant sent a somewhat cool message to the royal officers, to the effect that if he were granted the Oudh Subahdariship, he would vacate his post at Allahabad. Strange to say he obtained his request, and Abdulla Khan appointed R\u00e1ja Ratan Chand and Sayyad Shah Ali Khan as deputy governors in his place.\n\nInsurrections of the Rajputs.\u2014Early the next year Abdulla Khan was made prisoner in an encounter with the emperor's troops at Delhi, a few days after the assassination of his brother, Husen Ali, at Agra;\u2020 and for a few months the government of the province was carried on by Sayyad Shah Ali Khan. At the beginning of 1134 Hijri (A.D. 1722), the sanad of subahdar was conferred on Muhammed Khan Bangash, who was unable personally to carry on the administration owing to his presence being required in his other government of Malwa. His son, Akbar Ali Khan, was left in charge at Allahabad. At this time, the neighbouring Rajput Taluqdars of the subah rose in rebellion, and then commenced a period of anarchy and lawlessness which lasted for more than forty years, and was only terminated by the simultaneous overthrow of the Mahrattas in 1174 Hijri (A.D. 1761), the independence of the sovereignty of Oudh, and the rising power of the British arms in Bengal.\n\nTaluqdars of this and adjoining districts.\u2014The following chieftains are conspicuous in their bold assertion of independence, and on account of the large forces of men and arms they each and all kept up\u2014viz., R\u00e1ja Bhagwant Singh Kh\u00edch\u00e1r, of Asothar, in the district of Fatehpur, R\u00e1ja Hind\u00faput Singh, Sombanai of Partabgarh, R\u00e1ja Balbhadi Singh, Kanhpuria of Tiloi, R\u00e1ja Bh\u00e1o Singh, Bisen of R\u00e1mpur, with their clansmen and retainers in arms,\u2014and entering into a kind of offensive and defensive alliance, these taluqdars became a source of considerable trouble and\n\n* Abdulla Khan's brother, Husen Ali Khan, was Am\u00edr-ul-Umra or Commander-in-Chief.\n\u2020 Vide detailed account in Elphinstone's History of India, 6th Edn., pages 694, 695.\nanxiety to the Government, whose demands they set at nought, and whose irksome restrictions they determined to submit to no longer.\n\nTaluqdar's forces defeated by Safadat Khan.\u2014Over such men as these was Akbar Ali Khan, son of the governor Muhammad Khan Bangash, left to rule. A mere youth, without any capacity for administration, and addicted to pleasure, he left the affairs of his charge to take their own course. The result may be imagined. Disaffection, confusion, and oppression reigned rampant. At length in 1149 Hijri (A.D. 1736), Safadat Khan, Burhan-ul-mulk, viceroy of the adjoining province of Oudh, received the emperor's commands to proceed with a force and punish the insurgents. Safadat Khan encountered the Rajput forces under Raja Bhagwant Singh at Kora, gave them battle, and signally defeated them. He was unable, however, to follow up his success, as the complication of affairs in the Mahatta country demanded his presence in support of the imperial troops, \"for Safadat Khan,\" says Elphinstone, \"with a spirit very unlike his contemporaries, issued from his own province to defend that adjoining.\"\n\nDifferent governors of Subah Allahabad.\u2014Meantime Mubazir-ul-mulk had been appointed to the Allahabad command, and he appears to have been as inefficient and as unable to cope with the rebellion of the zamin-dars as his predecessor; for the Rajputs were again in a state of open revolt, while Rup Rao, son of Raja Bhagwant Singh, had actually taken forcible possession of sarkar Karra, with its twelve parganas. While these events were passing in the province of Allahabad, the Mughal empire was receiving the severest blow it had yet sustained at the hands of the Persian conqueror, Nadir Shah, (A.D. 1751). After the departure of that prince, and the restoration of the throne to Muhammad Shah, Umdat-ul-mulk, a favourite of the emperor, but who had unfortunately incurred the jealousy of the court, was deputed to the governorship of Allahabad. He remained in office from 1153 to 1156 Hijri (A.D. 1740 to 1743); and during this period he overcame the insurgent Rup Rao, and recovered the sarkar Karra. He also succeeded in effectually coercing the other rebellious taluqdars, and in restoring partial order throughout his jurisdiction. On his return to Delhi, he left Khan Alam Baqai-ulla Khan, his nephew, in charge of the province. The administration of this official as governor lasted but one year; for on the death of his uncle in 1157 Hijri, the government was bestowed on Salabat Ali Khan, commonly called Nana Baba, a relative of the emperor; but the newly appointed governor neither took up the reins of office himself, nor appointed a deputy. He adopted the somewhat novel course of farming out the province to Khan Alam.\n\nNavab Safdar Jang, Subahdar of Allahabad.\u2014Soon after this Safdar Jang, nephew of Safadat Khan, the late viceroy of Oudh, received on his appointment as wazir the governorship of the province of Ajmere, retaining at the same time his hereditary viceroyalty in Oudh. By a mutual arrangement he and Salabat Ali Khan exchanged provinces, and Safdar Jang became governor of Allahabad. He then divided the Subah of Allahabad into two portions. Over one portion, consisting of the sarkars of Manikpur, Karra, Kora, Allahabad, and Kanauj, he appointed the ex-Mus-\ntajit, Khan Alam, and over the remaining sarkars was placed Ali Quli Khan. At the same time Janesar Khan was appointed faujdar of Sarkar Manikpur. Charged with the general superintendence of the whole Subah was Safdar Jang's Diwan, Raja Newal Rae.\n\nThe Rohilla invasion.\u2014Next in the order of events comes the famous Rohilla invasion (occasioned by the illiberal conduct of Safdar Jang in dispossessing the widow of the Jagirdar of Farukhabad, Qaim Khan Bangash, of her territory, which resulted in Ahmad Khan Bangash, the brother, taking up arms in alliance with the Rohillas against the wrongdoer), in the course of which \"the Wazir was himself wounded; the Rohillas proceeded to carry their arms into his country; and though beaten off from Lucknow and Bilgram they penetrated to Allahabad, and set the power of the wazir and the emperor alike at defiance.\"* This took place in 1163 Hijri (A.D. 1750). The Diwan Newal Rae lost his life in one of these engagements. The next year, 1164 Hijri, Safdar Jang came to Guntai,\u2020 and, with the aid of the Mahrattas and the Jats, defeated the Rohillas, and drove them into the lower branches of the Himalayas, which form their boundary on the north-east. The Rohillas, as has been previously stated, were in possession of the city of Allahabad for forty-five days, and they sacked and plundered it. An attempt was made to eject Safdar Jang's faujdar, Janesar Khan, from Manikpur, and to place Kalle Khan's nephew, Usman, in possession. This attempt, however, proved unsuccessful, for Janesar Khan met the forces of Usman Khan near Fatehpur, and effectually prevented any attack on Manikpur. Usman Khan drew off his troops and joined his uncle Kalle Khan before the walls of Allahabad.\n\nRevolt and death of Safdar Jang.\u2014In 1161 Hijri (A.D. 1754), Alamgir II, succeeded the murdered Ahmad Shah. The self-appointed wazir and regicide Ghazi-ud-din at once took advantage of his position to annoy and humble his old enemy Safdar Jang. Accordingly he caused a sanad to be drawn up in favour of Khan Alam for the entire subah of Allahabad, and sent it to him. Khan Alam, on receiving it, forwarded it to Safdar Jang; who was at that time near Partabgarh. The latter wrote and congratulated his old lieutenant; at the same time he sent instructions to his nephew, Muhammad Quli Khan, in the fort of Allahabad to hold it against any attempt of Khan Alam, and simultaneously made overtures to the Mahrattas inviting them to come and take possession of the strongholds of Karra and Kora. Thus were the emperor's commands set at defiance by this daring and unscrupulous prince, who however departed this life shortly after in the year 1170 Hijri (A.D. 1756).\n\nEvents after the death of Safdar Jang.\u2014After the death of Safdar Jang a dispute arose between his son Shuja-ud-daula, and his nephew, Muhammad Quli Khan, regarding the division of territory. It was at last\n\n* Elphinstone's History of India, 5th Edn., page 736.\n\u2020 Five miles from Manikpur, on the Ganges, opposite Karra, on which occasion Raja Pir-thap was murdered.\n\u2021 Elphinstone puts the date of Safdar Jang's death at 1167 Hijri. I cannot but think this is a mistake. The \"Makhzan-ul-Tawarih\" and other reliable published works unite in making it 1170 Hijri.\nsettled that the latter should hold the subah of Allahabad, which had however become very much curtailed in its dimensions owing to the sark\u00e1rs of Karra, Kora, and Kalinjar having passed into the hands of the Mahrattas. Muhammad Quli Khan appointed Sayyad Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn as his faujdar in Manikpur, and in Patti Bilkh\u00e1r and Partabgarh Nawab Najaf Khan. At this time Isma'il Beg Risaldar was stationed in this sark\u00e1r, and Khan Alam Baq\u00e1-ulla Khan was driven by the Mahrattas to cross the Ganges and seek refuge in Oudh. The government of the subah became weaker and weaker every day, and Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula secretly assisted the enemies of his cousin, Muhammad Quli Khan, by every means in his power.\n\nMeantime other events were in progress. No sooner was the news of the death of Safdar Jang conveyed to the Wazir Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn, than, with the sanction of \u00c1lamg\u00edr, he determined on an attempt to confiscate his possessions. For this purpose he set out from Delhi, accompanied by two princes of the blood and the emperor's son-in-law. Hearing of his advance, Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula prepared to meet him, and sent word to his cousin, Muhammad Quli Khan at Allahabad, to lose no time in joining him with a sufficient force. Accordingly, although in no very amiable mood towards his cousin, Muhammad Quli Khan collected his forces and crossed the Ganges into Oudh at Manikpur. Here he was met by his Faujdar Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn, who poured into his ear such a tale of rebellion and contumacy on the part of the taluqdars within his jurisdiction, that Muhammad Quli Khan was in a measure forced to detach a portion of his forces under Najaf Khan for the punishment of these gentlemen.\n\nDefeat of the R\u00e1ja of Tiloi.\u2014Najaf Khan commenced operations against the R\u00e1ja of Tiloi whom he defeated in action and whose followers he dispersed. He was however unable to do more, as he was under the necessity of hastening to rejoin the main force under the governor. In spite of the earnest solicitations of Fakhr-ud-d\u00edn that he would remain and coerce the remaining rebels, Najaf Khan overtook Muhammad Quli Khan at Rae Bareli.\n\nFaujdar besieged at Manikpur.\u2014No sooner was the coast clear than the taluqdars felt that they had the game in their own hands. Uniting their forces they came down on the luckless faujdar, and so closely besieged him in Manikpur, that it was with the greatest difficulty that he managed to escape across the river, and find his way to Allahabad. Meanwhile Muhammad Quli Khan was on his way back from Sandi Pali (in the district of Hardoi) where matters had been amicably arranged. Strange to say, on his return he took little or no notice of the turbulent conduct of the taluqdars, who thus again escaped with impunity, to renew on the first opportunity, and in still greater force, their hostile attack on the Government officials.\n\nTreachery of Nawab Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula.\u2014Shortly afterwards in 1173 Hijri (A.D. 1759), Shah \u00c1lam, the heir apparent to the throne, who had left his father's court through fear of the vile Wazir Gh\u00e1zi-ud-d\u00edn arrived at Allahabad, and proposed to Muhammad Quli Khan to accompany him in the\ncapacity of Wazir in his expedition to Bengal. The governor of Allahabad readily consented, and at the same time wrote to his cousin Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, and invited him to co-operate. The latter, however, not placing much reliance in the ultimate success of the scheme, had recourse to an artifice, and under pretence of not possessing so secure a fortress as that of Allahabad, within which to leave his family and possessions during his absence, promised to accompany his cousin if he would temporarily give up to him the fort of Allahabad. The latter, unsuspicious of any treacherous designs, at once acceded to Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's proposal, and set off with Shah Alam for Bengal. No sooner was his back turned than Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, already master of the fort, lost no time in making himself master of the surrounding country. After a few months his cousin returned defeated and dispirited, and accompanied by only five or six horsemen. Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula seized the opportunity, and sent him a prisoner to Oudh (Fyzabad).\n\nAdvance of the Mahrattas into Oudh.\u2014The next year, 1173 Hijri, Alamgir II. was assassinated, and Shah Alam, though absent, was now the rightful sovereign; Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula had therefore to support his pretensions against the latter. In 1174 Hijri, Najaf Khan and Isma\u00edl Beg Khan came into the M\u00e1nikpur Sark\u00e1r, in order to make terms with the Rajput chiefs. Matters were in train towards an amicable settlement, when Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula refused to actively support the Mahrattas, now suffering all the horrors of a protracted siege in P\u00e1nipat. In consequence of this refusal, Bisw\u00e1s R\u00e1o, the Mahratta Grand Wazir, sent word to Gop\u00e1l Pandit, faujdar of Fatehpur Haswa, and Kishn\u00e1 Nand Pandit, faujdar of Karra, to harry the territory of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula. These officers, however, were not possessed of sufficient power to carry out these orders, as the bulk of their forces had been drawn off to reinforce the Mahratta army. They found themselves speedily relieved from this difficulty, as, no sooner were the Rajput taluqdars made aware of the nature of Bisw\u00e1s R\u00e1o's message, than they sent word to the two faujdars to cross the Ganges at once into Oudh, where troops to any extent would be placed at their disposal, and, at the same time, they signified their readiness to take part in the enterprise.\n\nM\u00e1nikpur plundered.\u2014Accordingly Gop\u00e1l, faujdar, crossed at Dalmau in the Rae Bareli district, while his colleague crossed at M\u00e1nikpur. At both places they found large forces in readiness to receive them. At Dalmau a general massacre of the inhabitants, who were chiefly Muhammadans, took place, but at M\u00e1nikpur, owing it is asserted to the more humane disposition of Kishn\u00e1 Nand, no such horrors were enacted. Nevertheless the place was gutted, and the property of many fugitives, who were attempting to escape, was plundered from the boats as they were going down the river. Then commenced a series of raids and petty engagements throughout this and the adjoining districts, in which Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's lieutenants had to hold their own against the combined forces of the taluqdars and the Mahratta agents.\n\n* For a full account of this unfortunate attempt against the Subahdar of Bengal, vide Nolan's History of the British Empire in India, Vol. II., pp. 267-68. He writes:\u2014\"The Nawab of Oudh had proved treacherous, and had seized the capital of his ally, the Nawab of Allahabad, who withdrew his forces from before Patna to save his own territories.\"\nEnd of the Rajput rebellion.\u2014Suddenly news arrived of the final overthrow of the Mahrattas, and, in consequence Gop\u00e1l and Kishn\u00e1 Nand were obliged to effect a hasty retreat. They were hotly pursued by R\u00e1\u00e9 S\u00farat Singh and R\u00e1ja Beni Bah\u00e1dur, two of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's officers, and by Najaf Khan and Ism\u00e1\u00edl Beg, and were finally driven out of the sark\u00e1rs of Karra and Kora, which thereupon came into the possession of the viceroy of Oudh. The R\u00e1ja of Tiloi, Balbhaddar Singh, was driven into exile across the Gogra, and we have no further account of him. R\u00e1ja Hind\u00fapat of Partabgarh also became a fugitive, and, it is asserted, subsequently embraced the Musalman religion. He was brother to Pir-th\u00edpat, who was murdered at Gutni in 1164 Hijri, and this period under Hind\u00fapat supplies another link in the history of the Partabgarh family. Hind\u00fapat probably succeeded his nephew Duni\u00e1pat, who was killed at Badwal in pargana Sikandra in 1165-66 Hijri, and it is clear that he was sufficiently powerful to unite in the Rajput combination against the Government officials, and that he was in possession of the estate for another eight or nine years\u2014i.e., till 1174 Hijri, when he was driven into exile by Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula's lieutenant. R\u00e1\u00e9 Kusal Singh, Taluqdar of R\u00e1mpur, alone of all the insurgent chiefs succeeded in making his peace with the Government.\n\nSark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur included in Oudh.\u2014In 1175 Hijri (A.D. 1762), Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula included the sark\u00e1r of M\u00e1nikpur within his dominions in Oudh, and since that time the component muh\u00e1ls have formed a part of this province.\n\nKar\u00e1mat Khan of Gutni.\u2014In the year 1176 Hijri (A.D. 1763), when Shah \u00c1lam having succeeded to the sovereignty of Delhi, came to Allahabad on his return from his fruitless expedition to Bengal, and had conferred on Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula the post of waz\u00edr. All the Hindu chieftains, with the exception of the R\u00e1jas of Aorehha, Datia, Jh\u00e1nsi, Chhatarpur, Panna, and Ajegarh tendered their submission, and sent handsome presents. The absence in darb\u00e1r of the representatives of the chieftains abovementioned was too conspicuous to be passed over without notice. Accordingly the emperor with his waz\u00edr sallied forth to chastise them. On this occasion he was materially assisted by one Kar\u00e1mat Khan, son-in-law of Sherzam\u00e1n Khan, ris\u00e1ld\u00e1r and resident of Gutni. This man was, it is said, so powerful that he could separate two fighting elephants, and he was very handsome withal. Possessed of such attractions, it is not difficult to understand that he commanded a large body of followers. These he placed at the disposal of his sovereign, and led them in person. In the engagement with the forces of Hind\u00fapat of Panna which ensued, our hero, after displaying prodigies of valour, unfortunately lost his life. His name is still remembered and proudly spoken of in Gutni and its neighbourhood.\n\nGardezi settlements.\u2014At this time the Gardezis, although their fortunes had much decayed, were still in possession of more than 300 villages. The chief settlement was as heretofore in M\u00e1nikpur, but they had also established colonies in Mustafabad, B\u00e1zipur, Ras\u00falpur, and Unchag\u00e1n.\nThe former extent of M\u00e1nikpur.\u2014What was formerly M\u00e1nikpur, and known as such in the days of its pristine glory, comprised the following areas which have since been demarcated as separate villages, while for some unaccountable and most extraordinary reason (best known to the boundary settlement officer), the very name of M\u00e1nikpur has been wiped off the collector's register, and has been replaced by the somewhat modest and unpretentious title of P\u00farai Ali Naq\u00ed. The founder of the p\u00fara was a comparatively obscure individual, without any claims to the remembrance of posterity:\n\n| P\u00farai Ali Naq\u00ed | Aimai R\u00e1je Muhammed Hay\u00e1t (w/ Shah\u00e1b-ud-d\u00edn-abad) | 259 acres |\n|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------|\n| Chakch\u00e1nda      |                                                  | 31        |\n| Jotd\u00f3man        |                                                  | 236       |\n| Chauk\u00e1ppur      |                                                  | 775       |\n| K\u00e1chhipat\u00ed      |                                                  | 90        |\n| R\u00e1napatti       |                                                  | 45        |\n| Sultanpur       |                                                  | 187       |\n| Rathai          |                                                  | 87        |\n| Rajha Bhit      |                                                  | 356       |\n| Mirgarwa        |                                                  | 301       |\n| Ah\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n Q\u00e1h  |                                                  | 38        |\n| Bananpur        |                                                  | 232       |\n| P\u00farai Mouzz-ud-d\u00edn |                                              | 8         |\n| Khemsira        |                                                  | 749       |\n\nTotal 3,894\n\nUltimate position of M\u00e1nikpur.\u2014From the time the sark\u00e1r M\u00e1nikpur came into Qudh, it retained during the lifetime of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula\u2014i.e., until 1187 Hijri (A.D. 1774)\u2014its former dimensions entire, and was governed by a chakladar. On the assumption of the sovereignty by \u00c1sif-ud-daula, the latter assigned to his mother, the widowed Queen, the parganas of Salon, J\u00e1s, and Nas\u00edrabad (according to the distribution of the \u00c1in-i-Akbari), in j\u00e1gir; while about the same time parganas Ree Bereli, Dalmau, Thulendi, and Kas\u00fat (now Kh\u00edron) were detached and placed under the Chakladar of Baisw\u00e9ra, and parganas Amor and Behlol (now, Partabgarh) and Jal\u00e1lpur Bilkhar (now Patt\u00e1 Dalippur) were attached to the Sultanpur Niz\u00e1m\u00e1t. The remainder was called \"Chakla M\u00e1nikpur,\" and so continued until 1244 Hijri (A.D. 1829) when the chakla was absorbed in the Salon Niz\u00e1m\u00e1t. An official was occasionally deputed by the N\u00e1zim under the title of Chakladar of Ahl\u00e1dganj, whose jurisdiction extended to the limits of the present parganas of M\u00e1nikpur, Bih\u00e1r, and Dhingwas.\n\nGutni.\u2014Five miles to the south of M\u00e1nikpur and also on the Ganges is the village of Gutni. Its chief notoriety is in connection with the murder here of R\u00e1ja Pirth\u00edpat Singh, of Partabgarh, by Nawab Mans\u00far Ali Khan (Safdar J\u00e1ng) in 1164 Hijri (A.D. 1751). It is currently believed that the village of Gutni was founded about four centuries ago by an influential and wealthy Ah\u00edr, who owned large flocks and herds. This Indian Laban discovered that the pasturage in this particular locality was sweet and good, and, he accordingly determined to take up his abode here. A certain Mur\u00e1q, named Doman, it is alleged, increased his holding to such an extent that it became in course of time a separate village under the name \"Jotd\u00f3man.\"\nfew houses were built and the place was named Gutni, which, it is alleged, is a combination of the Sanskrit words \"gau\" (cow) and \"tarn\" (grass). However this may have been, and there seems no reason why we should reject the story, it was not until some two centuries ago that Gutni rose to be a place of any importance. At that time one Shah\u00e1b Khan Path\u00e1n, a Cabul merchant and horse-dealer, came to Hindustan. He settled first at Jah\u00e1nabad in the district of Rae Bareli. He subsequently came to M\u00e1nikpur, and shortly after purchased Gutni from the Gardens. He took up his residence in the place, and his descendants are the present proprietors of the village. One of his successors, Muhammad Hay\u00e1t Khan, attained to great celebrity, and obtained the lofty title of Haft Haz\u00e1ri. Gutni was a prosperous place under the Path\u00e1n; about 25 years ago it, too, declined with the falling fortunes of Asad Khan, an officer formerly high in the service of the Oudh Government.\n\nM\u00c1NIKPUR Town\u2014Pargana M\u00c1NIKPUR\u2014Tahsil KUNDA\u2014District PARTABGARH.\u2014This town lies in latitude 25\u00b046' north and longitude 81\u00b026' east, at a distance of 36 miles from Partabgarh, 16 miles from Salon, 36 from Rae Bareli, and 36 from Allahabad. The inhabited portion is chiefly on the bank of the Ganges. The population is divided as follows:\n\n| Hindus | 811 | ... | ... | ... | Males | 805 |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|-----|\n| Musalmans | 335 | ... | ... | ... | Females | 341 |\n| Total | 1,646 | ... | ... | ... | Total | 1,646 |\n\nThere are 180 masonry houses, twenty-two mosques, six temples to Mah\u00e1deo, one to Jw\u00e1la Mukhi, and a private religious institution bearing the name of Kallu, a D\u00e1mgh\u00e1ni, tombs of R\u00e1je Sayyad N\u00far and Shah His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn, one vernacular school called \"K\u00e1la Madarsa\" from the mildewed tower, and a police station.\n\nThere are two fairs in honour of Jw\u00e1la Mukhi\u2014one in Chait, the second in As\u00e1dh, on the 8th of the dark halves of the months; they are attended by 30,000 people. The gathering does not last long. The commodities have no peculiarity worthy of mention. A third fair called \"Bataunka\" or \"Natsunka\" is held in Aghan every Thursday, and has a concourse of 5,000 souls; a large portion being females.\n\nThe roads that pass through the town are the following:\n\n1. From Bih\u00e1r to Rae Bareli.\n2. To Gutal.\n3. To Sar\u00e1th\u00e1r bridge.\n4. To Partabgarh via Dh\u00e1r\u00e1per.\n5. To Salon.\n\nIt is a picturesque ruin of an ancient city where palm trees cluster round numerous mosques and minar in all stages of decay.\n\nThe history of the place is given under that of the pargana. The derivation of the name and the history of the foundation are variously described:\n\n1. That R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Deo, son of R\u00e1ja B\u00e1\u00ed Deo, of Kanauj, founded this town and named it after him, and his descendant, M\u00e1nik Chand, when he got the throne as his inheritance, changed the name to M\u00e1nikpur.\n2. The \"Tazkirat-ul-aulia\" recites that at a very ancient time there were two brothers, M\u00e1nik R\u00e1j, and S\u00faraj R\u00e1j. S\u00faraj R\u00e1j caught hold of a pious woman with an evil intention, and so his hand withered (\"khushk ho gaya\"). He resorted to medical aid but in vain. They then applied to a saintly darvesh, who directed them to go to a place near the bank of the Ganges (where Karra now stands), where they would find a stone, and the guilty man would have his hand restored by touching the marvellous stone. Both the brothers advanced to the spot, and found the direction true. S\u00faraj R\u00e1j touched the stone and his hand was restored. S\u00faraj R\u00e1j then constructed a fort at the spot, and founded a city there calling it Karra, originating the name from \"kar,\" in Sanskrit meaning hand. The stone still preserved in the fort is styled \"Qadam-i-Adam\" (or the footprint of Adam), and is an object of devotion.\n\nM\u00e1nik R\u00e1j then founded another town on the opposite bank of the river calling it after himself.\n\n3. To attribute the foundation of M\u00e1nikpur to R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand Gharw\u00e1r is quite a mistake, for underneath the bottom of the fort of M\u00e1nikpur the remnants of the decayed masonry houses are visible, and attest to the town having been founded at a much anterior date than that of M\u00e1nik Chand.\n\n4. A fourth story is that R\u00e1ja B\u00e1l Deo, of Kanauj, had three sons\u2014R\u00e1m Deo, D\u00e1l Deo, and M\u00e1n Deo. R\u00e1m Deo succeeded him at Kanauj, D\u00e1l Deo inherited the Rae Bareli estate, and M\u00e1n Deo, an il\u00e1qa named by him M\u00e1npur. R\u00e1ja M\u00e1nik Chand on coming to the throne changed M\u00e1npur to M\u00e1nikpur.\n\nM\u00c1NJHG\u00c1ON*\u2014Pargana SAND\u00cdLA\u2014Tahsil SAND\u00cdLA.\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014Population, 1,238.\u2014A Bais village of 246 mud houses, fourteen miles north-east from Sandila. This was the ancestral home and fort of the Bais taluqdars of M\u00e1njhgaon, who resided here for centuries until, five generations ago, they killed Fateh Singh, the Bais R\u00e1ja of Bharawan, and removed thither. Th\u00e1kur Bari\u00e1r Singh and Koli Singh, the uncle and cousin of R\u00e1ja Randh\u00edr Singh of Bharawan, live at M\u00e1njhgaon.\n\nMANJHIA*\u2014Pargana GOPAMAU\u2014Tahsil HARDOI\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014A prosperous little country-town of 749 mud houses, four miles to the south-east of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed on the road to Gopamau. Market days are Tuesdays and Saturdays. A mud school-house was built in 1865. Octroi is levied for the support of a small body of town police. Manjhia is mainly inhabited by Cham\u00e1s, but belongs to the Chauh\u00e1ns. The Chauh\u00e1ns acquired it about 1619 A.D. by gift to their ancestor R\u00e1p S\u00e1h of Mainpuri, who entered the service of Nawab Mehndi Quli Khan of Pih\u00e1n\u00ed, and received from him this village in recognition of his services. In 1777 A.D., Manjhia was attacked and laid waste by R\u00e1ja Sital Parsh\u00e1d, the n\u00e1zim of Khairabad, of evil memory. It lay desolated and deserted for six years. In 1784 A.D., Mansa R\u00e1m, Chakladar of Gopamau, restored the Chauhans.\n\n* By Mr. A. H.

Bhagwantnagar is two miles south. It was founded by one M\u00e1n Kewal Bais, about 600 years ago; and his descendants still possess it. The founder of this village was of the same line as the ancestors of the late B\u00e1bu R\u00e1m Bakhsh, of Daundia Kh\u00e9ra, but he left his brethren, and coming from Daundia Kh\u00e9ra founded it. It is situated on a plain and has a tolerable appearance. The soil is clay and sand mixed; water good and climate healthy. Not many trees, and no jungle, no bazar or fair; no manufactures excepting goldsmiths' and carpenters' works.\n\nThe total population amounts to 2,153, Hindus number 1,989, and Moslems 164.\n\nThere are 507 mud-built houses and one temple to Debi.\n\nMANSURNAGAR Pargana*\u2014Tahsil SHAHABAD\u2014District HARDOI.\u2014A small and backward pargana of twenty-five villages lying in the southeastern corner of the Shahabad tahsil. It is bounded on the north by parganas Alamnagar and Pih\u00e1ni, on the east by Gopamau, and on the south and west by north and south Sara. Its greatest length is six and breadth seven miles. Its area is 26 square miles, only 9 of which are cultivated.\n\nThe Bhainsta stream, called lower down in its course the Sai, flows through it, but is too shallow, and dries up too quickly to be used for irrigation. The west of the pargana is watered from a large jh\u00edl called Gurru, which stretches for about three miles north and south of the little town of Mansurnagar. Occasionally it overflows and damages the adjacent lands. The main natural features of the pargana are the absence of sandy soil (bh\u00far), and the quantity of uncleared jungle. To 6,060 cultivated acres there are 7,740 acres of culturable waste. The pargana is crossed by the unmetalled roads from Hardoi to Pih\u00e1ni and from Pih\u00e1ni to Shahabad.\n\nIt is a backward but very improveable tract. The soil is almost everywhere good, though not so rich as in the adjacent pargana of Sara. Cultivators are somewhat scarce. Nil-g\u00e1e, wild hogs, and here and there wild cattle infest the jungle and ravage the crops. The country is level. Rather more than two-fifths of the cultivated area is irrigated. Three-fourths of the area irrigated is watered from tanks and ponds, of which there are 190; mud wells are dug all over the pargana, but rarely last for more than three years. The cost of the large wells worked by bullocks varies from four to ten rupees. The hand-wells (dhenkli) are dug here from two to four rupees.\n\nThe tillage is fair, especially in the Chauh\u00e1n villages, whose proprietors are industrious and enterprising. Wheat, barley, and millet are the great staples, and occupy more than three-fifths of the crop area. Gram, b\u00e1jra, and m\u00e1sh cover rather more than another fifth. Indigo, tobacco, and\n\n* By Mr. A. H. Harington, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nopium are scarcely known, and sugarcane is very sparingly planted. Kan-\nkar is found at Mansurnagar.\n\nFifteen of the villages are held in zamindari tenure; one is taluqdari\nand nine are imperfect pattidari. The Chauhans hold four villages, the\nChaudhri Gaurs six, the Gautams a half village, Sayyads four, Pathans\nthree and a half, Brahmins four, and Kayaths two. One, a jungle, has\nbeen decreed to Government.\n\nThe Government demand, excluding cesses, amounts to Rs. 11,128, and\nfalls at Re. 1-13-5 per cultivated acre; Re. 0-10-8 per acre of total area;\nRs. 12-13-1 per plough; Rs. 2-6-5 per head of the agricultural, and\nRe. 1-12-4 per head of the total population.\n\nThe pargana is more sparsely populated than any in the district.\nIt contains a population of only 6,286 or 242 to the square mile. Of these\n5,965 are Hindus and 321 Mohammadans. Pasis, Chamars, and Ahirs\nin almost equal numbers make up nearly a half of the Hindu popula-\ntion. The Rajputs are only a sixteenth of the whole. Males to females\nare 3,437 to 2,849, and agriculturists to non-agriculturists 4,636 to 1,650.\n\nThere are no markets or fairs. The only school is a village one, with\nan average of 43 pupils at Mansurnagar.\n\nThe pargana is named from the little town of Mansurnagar. The ear-\nliest inhabitants, of whom tradition preserves the memory, were Thatheras,\nwhose stronghold was at Simaurgarh, three miles north of Mansurnagar.\nAt some uncertain period before the fall of Kanauj, the Gaurs, under the\nleadership of Kuber Sah, expelled the Thatheras from Simaurgarh, and,\nit is said, from forty-one other strongholds, the most notable being\nKalhaur in pargana Bawan. During the reign of Akbar, Raja Lakhmi\nSen, Gaur, removed his headquarters from Kalhaur to Simaurgarh, and\nbuilt there (on the ruins of the old Thatha castle) a large and lofty fort,\nthe outer enclosure of which measured a mile each way. Towards the\nend of Akbar's reign the Gaurs of Simaurgarh became troublesome, and\nNawab Sadr Jahan stormed their fort, and reduced them to obedience\nwhile the power of the Gaurs lasted. The present town of Mansurnagar\nwas a little village called Nagar; Murid Khan, the grandson of Nawab Sadr\nJahan, built a brick fort there. In 1702 A.D., Raja Ibuddulla Khan, the\nconverted Sombansi, possessed himself of the whole jagir of the Pihani\nSayyads, and rebuilt Murid Khan's fort, and named the place Mansurna-\ngar, after Nawab Mansur Ali Khan (Safdar Jang). In 1806 A.D., Raja\nMansa Ram, Chakladar of Muhamdi, took some villages out of parganas\nSara and Gopamau, and made them into pargana Mansurnagar.\n\nMANWAN Pargana\u2014Tahsil BARI\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014This pargana is\nbounded on the north by Bari, on the east and south by the district of\nLucknow, and on the west by the rivers Gumti and Sarayan.\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nIts area is 69 square miles, of which 46 are cultivated, and the acreage is thus distributed:\n\n|                | Acres |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Cultivated land | 29,028 |\n| Culturable land | 5,074  |\n| Total           | 34,102 assessed |\n\n|                | Acres |\n|----------------|-------|\n| Rent-free      | 2,476 |\n| Barren         | 497   |\n| Total          | 9,978 unassessed |\n\nTotal area: 44,076\n\nThe incidence of the revised assessment is as follows:\n\n|                | Acres |\n|----------------|-------|\n| On cultivation | 207   |\n| \" assessed area| 110   |\n| \" total area   | 1510  |\n\nThe population numbered 30,553 at the Census of 1868, and may be divided thus:\n\n|                | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Hindus, agricultural | 18,469 |\n| Ditto, non-agricultural | 10,258 |\n| Total            | 28,720 |\n\n|                | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Musalmans, agricultural | 265 |\n| Ditto, non-agricultural | 1,668 |\n| Total            | 1,933 |\n\nThe 30,553 live in 5,659 houses.\n\nThere are 443 souls to the square mile and 5\u00b73 to each house. The Musalmans are 6 per cent. only of the entire population, which is much below the average of the whole district.\n\nTo each head of the agricultural population there are 1\u00b75 acres of cultivation and 1\u00b79 acres of assessed land, the smallest average in the district.\n\nThe pargana consists of 69 Hadbasti villages which are thus held, taluqdar 38, zamindari 30. The Panw\u00e1r Chhattirs, whose chief men are Bhaw\u00e1n\u00eddin of Nilg\u00e1on, and Ganga Bakhsh of Saraura, samad taluqdars, own 65 villages. Two are held by a Musalman family, and two, including Manw\u00e1n Khas, by the q\u00e1n\u00fangoes.\n\nThe Panw\u00e1rs are said to have come from Gwalior at the close of the 16th century in king Akbar's reign, under the chieftainship of three brothers,\u2014Malhan Deo, Phul Deo, and M\u00e1l Deo. They invaded and seized Itaunja and Mahona in the Lucknow district, and Saraura Nilg\u00e1on, of Sitapur, and, with the exception of Mahona, which was confiscated for complicity in the rising of 1857, their descendants still hold these estates. M\u00e1l Deo's taluqa was divided by the two brothers\u2014Binda D\u00e1s and Hari D\u00e1s\u2014in the third generation from him, the former taking Saraura, the latter Nilg\u00e1on.\nThe soil in this pargana varies from the bh\u00fbr (sandy) and kankar land in the vicinity of the Sar\u00e1yan to the rich and productive dum\u00e1t (loam) in the north-east. The irrigation is chiefly from tanks and jhils, wells being scarce. The cultivators on the whole belong to the more industrious classes. Rents are paid generally in kind. The productive powers of the soil are good, but nothing remarkable is produced; nor are there any manufactures special to the district carried on. No mines or quarries are to be met with. There are no mountains, valleys, or forests.\n\nThe pargana as such was formed by Todar Mal, who called it after the town Manw\u00e1n which already existed there, and the lands round which had been constituted into Tappa Manw\u00e1n by king Vikram\u00e1jit, 16 centuries prior to Todar Mal\u2019s time.\n\nNeither pargana nor town is historically famous for anything which has occurred in modern times. For the legend which identifies it with the M\u00e1nipur of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rath, the reader is referred to the history of the town. Suffice it to say here, that the former name of the place was M\u00e1npur, and that to the present day the inhabitants point out the spot one mile from the town where Arjun was slain by his son, Babarbah\u00e1n, in the village of Ranu\u00e1pura, which is being interpreted \u201cthe place of the battle.\u201d\n\nThe only remains of antiquity existing are the old fort ruins, near which are a darg\u00e1h and idg\u00e1h, built about 200 years ago, all of which are at Manw\u00e1n itself, and within two miles of the main road connecting Lucknow with Sitapur. No mel\u00e1s or fairs take place in the district.\n\nThis pargana with that of B\u00e1ri were included by the settlement department of the emperor Akbar in sark\u00e1r Lucknow.\n\n**MANW\u00c1N\u2014Pargana MANW\u00c1N\u2014Tahsil B\u00c1RI\u2014District SITAPUR.**\n\nThough possessing a population of only 1,069 souls, deserves notice on account of its great antiquity and its legendary connection with the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rath. It lies four miles south of B\u00e1ri still on the Sar\u00e1yan stream, and is one mile west of the Lucknow and Sitapur high road. The present town is a very wretched place, and altogether without interest for the trader or the artisan. It is said to have been founded 5,000 years ago by R\u00e1ja M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta of the Ajodhya Solar race, but to have fallen away on his death and become waste. Subsequently, the exact date is not known, one man (an Ahfr) took the eastern portion, and a Musalman, Mustafa Khan by name, the western. The old town was rebuilt, and was known by the double name M\u00e1npur Mustafabad. The remains of old king M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta\u2019s fort are still extant. It was apparently a massive structure, and was placed on high ground overlooking the river, covering an area of 90 bighas. The bricks are used by the villagers for building in the town which thus presents a curious appearance, being like neither a qasba, nor an ordinary Hindu village, but something between the two.\n\nThe local legend runs thus:\n\nBefore the days when the Pandav\u00e1s fought with the Kaurav\u00e1s, R\u00e1ja M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta lived in great state in his castle at Manwa (or Manw\u00e1n). But\n\n*By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.*\nthere came against him a R\u00e1kshas from the city of Muttra, by name Lon, who fought with the raja and prevailed against him, so the raja died.\n\n\"This was 4,975 years ago, and Gandrak, who was the son of Lon, sat upon the throne in the raja's stead, and he waxed mighty. And he had a lovely daughter, whose gait was undulating like that of a young elephant, fair as the moon, and with the form of a Damayanti. And the princes of the earth sought her hand in marriage. But the great Arjun of the Pandavas,\u2014who had performed the Ashwamedh Jagg, and who was of exceeding strength and manly comeliness, found favour in her eyes and they were espoused, and she bore him a son whose name was called Babarbah\u00e1n; and it came to pass, many years afterwards, that Arjun and his son fought hard by Manw\u00e1n, and Arjun was slain by his son; so he died, and the place of the battle was Ranu\u00e1pura, half a koe from Manw\u00e1n, where a village of that name still exists.\"\n\nThis legend agrees in all points with that related in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rath.\n\nBut this M\u00e1nipur of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rath is generally considered to be the M\u00e1nipur in the east of Bengal, and not M\u00e1npur, now Manw\u00e1n in Gudh, and yet the people in the latter place still point out the remains of Babarbah\u00e1n's fort, close to the older one of M\u00e1ndh\u00e1ta.\n\nThere can be no doubt as to the ruins being of great antiquity. And on this account alone Manw\u00e1n or Manwa deserves a place in the local Gazetteer.\n\nMATHURA*\u2014Pargana BALRAMPUR\u2014Tahsil UTRAULA\u2014District GONDA.\u2014A small village of about 1,500 inhabitants, two miles north of the R\u00e9pti, which is crossed on the Ikaua road at Mathura, and in the Balr\u00e1mpur direction at the Kondari gh\u00e1ts; the former town being six, and the latter fifteen miles from Mathura. This village is only remarkable as the chief seat of the retail trade of the neighbourhood. A bazar of rather over a hundred shops is held every day. A large double-storied brick house belonging to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Balr\u00e1mpur, in the courtyard of which some 30 boys gain the rudiments of Hindi and Urdu, and a lofty shiw\u00e1la, are conspicuous from afar. Rather more than a mile to the north is a handsome Muhammadan darg\u00e1h consecrated to Mir Hanifa, and erected by Nawab \u00c1n\u00edf-ud-daula. A faq\u00edr of peculiar sanctity occupies, with his followers, the surrounding buildings, and at the Baqar Id collects the tribute of several thousand devotees.\n\nMAUR\u00c1NW\u00c1N Pargana\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014This is the most easterly pargana in Unao, and is separated from the Rae Bareli district by the river Sai. The soil is good, and excellent rice crops are produced. Water is found at a distance of 30 feet to the south, and at 22 feet near the Sai. The area of the pargana is 110,538 acres, which are held as follows:\n\n| Taluqdari | Zamindari | Pattidari |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| ...       | ...       | ...       |\n| 69,863    | 15,355    | 25,820    |\n\n* By Mr. W. C. Benett, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nThe land revenue is Rs. 1,25,029, which falls at the rate of Re. 1-2-0 per acre. It is well wooded, having 7,899 acres of groves and orchards. The population is 90,464, being at the rate of 523 to the square mile.\n\nThe town is said to have been founded by M\u00faraj Dhuj, a S\u00farajbansi Chhatti; it afterwards passed into the hands of the Bais, one of whose chiefs, Chet R\u00e1e, built a fort at Pachhimgaon.* The history of the great estate of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n is thus told by Elliott:\n\n\"Oonao* has far fewer talookdars than any other district in Oudh, and its chronicles contain few stories of the way in which talookas were amassed. It will be well, however, to give the history of one great family of this class, R\u00e1ja Gowrie Shunkura of Morawun.\n\n\"In 1721 Sadut Khan, Burhan-ool-mulk, was made Governor of Agra, and after two years he was translated to the more important Soobah ef Oudh. Just before he left Agra his private Munshi died, and he took into his service a Seth of the place, named Goorun Mul, and brought him with him to Oudh. This Goorun Mul was the ancestor of the present Raja. It is not clear whether he retained his post till Sadut Khan's death in 1739, or whether he lost it at an earlier period; but whenever it was, he was persuaded by Rao Murdan Singh, of Doondea Khera, to come and reside there under his protection, fetching his family from Agra, and to act as the family banker, and keep the accounts of the estate. In 1740 Rao Murdan divided his talooka among his three sons, giving Doondea Khera to his eldest son, Rugho Nath Singh, who bears a very bad character in native tradition. Murdan Singh retired from public life, but lived at Doondea Khera, and during his lifetime his son abstained from any of the graver crimes and meannesses which subsequently stained his reputation. Goorun Mul lived peaceably at Doondea Khera, but soon after Murdan Singh's death, Goorun Mul's son, Hird\u00e9ram, had a bitter quarrel with the Rao on the fertile subject of accounts. The custom is that the payment of the Government revenue when it falls due on the patron's estate is always effected by the family banker. If the talookdar cannot supply him with the necessary funds, the banker pays it from his own resources, and debits the advance against the estate, to be paid with interest as rents come in.\n\n\"Rao Rugho Nath refused to pay more than 12 per cent. on such advances. The banker, Hird\u00e9ram, declared that he received 36 per cent. from all other customers, and that he was treating the Rao very handsomely in charging him only 24 per cent., and in short, he would not abate one jot of his claim. The dispute went so far, that Hird\u00e9ram thought it safer to leave Doondea Khera secretly by night, and take refuge with Dyaram, Chukladar, who gave him leave to build on a little patch of masfee land close to Morawun, known as Dyaram's Kutra\u2014a name which is quite forgotten now. Here Hird\u00e9ram,\u2020 in addition to his banking and money-lending business, set up as a merchant of cotton, Mirzapore cloth, and spices. He also got the appointment of treasurer to the\n\n* \"Elliott's Chronicles of Oonao,\" page 73.\n\u2020 Pages 125\u2014137. \"Elliott's Chronicles of Oonao.\"\n\u2021 Rugho Nath soon after went to Gya to perform the customary rights on his father's death, and as no one who is in debt can make this pilgrimage, he sent Hird\u00e9ram the full amount of his claim.\nNazim of Baiswara, which, under the old r\u00e9gime, was a very lucrative post.\n\n\"The principal profits were these:\u2014The treasurer received two per cent commission on all revenue paid into his charge. When there was not money enough in the chest to meet the Government demand on quarter day, the treasurer was bound to advance it to the Nazim at 12 per cent. interest.* It was the custom to issue from the mint new rupees every year, coining them in the month of Mohurrum; and the way they were forced into circulation was by a declaration that those were the only coins which would be received at par; a discount of 1 rupee 9 annas per cent. being charged on rupees of every other year and mint.\u2020 It was of course impossible for the rupees to get so rapidly into circulation in remote districts, and hence this discount came to be considered as a regular cess upon the zemindars, and was always included in their kuboolyuts.\n\n\"The zemindars, therefore, paid their revenue with this additional percentage in the rupees current in their locality, and as those rupees very often ranked as high in the market as the new current rupee of the year, the treasurer could change them without any loss, and the discount of 1 rupee 9 annas per cent. became his perquisite. To these profits it is almost needless to add the influence which he obtained from his position as treasurer; and being always at hand to offer an advance at 36 per cent. to any helpless defaulter who might fall into the hands of the Nazim, he was able to extend his operations very widely.\n\n\"After this wise Hirdaram increased and multiplied. His son, Lalmun, carried on his father's business, and educated his grandson, Chundun Lal, who took the management of the house at his grandfather's death. Chundun Lal had two brothers; the second, Moona Lal, set up for himself at Cawnpore, and there has never been a good feeling between the two branches of the family. The third son, Gunga Pershad, remained at Morawun as a partner of his eldest brother's house.\n\n*In 1810 A.D., when Fuzl Ali Khan was Nazim of Baiswara, Chundun Lal first appears as the owner of three villages in different parts of the district. From this he went on gradually increasing his possessions till, in 1825 A.D., when Raja Durshun Singh was Nazim, his estate had risen to two and a half lacs, and it continued to fluctuate between this amount and a minimum of one and a half lacs (with only one considerable exception to be mentioned afterwards) till 1850 A.D. In that year Hamid Ali Khan, a Delhi Prince, was Nazim, and his agent and actual manager was Gholam Ali Khan. He thought Chundun Lal was a squeezable man, and required him to pay more by half a lac than he had done last year. Chundun Lal flatly refused, and declared the estate was not worth more. 'At any rate' said the Naib, 'every one does not think that, for Rambux will give Rs. 30,000 more any day.' This was adding fuel to Chundun Lal's anger, to think that he should not only lose his estate, but also that his old enemy\n\n*The Nazim had to pay the total sum bid by him, to obtain the contract of the Nizamat, in four instalments, which fell due on fixed days.\n\u2020This discount was known by the name of \"Bhutta Ghun.\"\n\u2021 Pages 138\u2014149, \"Elliot's Chronicles of Oonso.\"\nthe Rao of Doondea Khera was to get it. He answered him angrily, and went away without taking leave. Next day the Naib sent for him again, and he came to his tent, and sat down unattended. Presently Rao Rambux entered, followed by three armed men, and he also sat down. After a little time Gholam Ali called to a servant to fill his lota with water, saying\u2014'I shall have to leave you for a few minutes.' A servant of Chundun Lal was standing outside, and knew what the order meant, for the moment Gholam Ali's feet were off the carpet, Rambux's followers would murder Chundun Lal; so he set off as hard as he could to his master's tent, a quarter of a mile off, where was his nephew, Sheopershad, with 200 men, headed by the redoubtable Jubba Singh. They instantly hurried to the durbar tent, throwing aside their guns, since the work before them, if it came to fighting, would be a m\u00eal\u00e9e in which they could trust to nothing but their own good swords. Fortunately they arrived in time, burst into the tent in spite of all the Naib Nazim's guards could do to stop them, and Jubba Singh, standing with his drawn sword over the Naib, swore he would cut him down if he attempted to stir. The camp was at Nugur, and Rana Rughonath Singh and Raja Drigbijie, who were with the Naib, soon heard of the disturbance. They both of them banked with Chundun Lal, and were hearty friends of his. Rao Rambux, on the other hand, was hated in the country, and they rejoiced in this opportunity of defeating his murderous intentions. They came with their forces, and brought Chundun Lal safely off, and he instantly threw up his charge of the treasury, and went to his home. His estate was given to Rambux, but his followers resisted the order in every village, and successfully prevented the Rao\u2020 from getting possession. In the meanwhile the banker sent to Lucknow, and got the king to order the Nazim to restore him his whole estate, which was accordingly done, he having only been out of possession of it for two and a half months.\n\n\"In the year 1822 A.D., when Lalmun Tewaree was Chukladar, Chundun Lal had refused to serve as his treasurer, and had taken charge of the Huzoor Tahseel treasury at Lucknow, at the instance of Hakeem Mehndie Ali, the great Vizier. This had produced a quarrel between them, which became a feud, when a party of the followers of each side fought at Rai Bareilly, and some men were killed. In 1853, the grandson of this Lalmun, Kasheepershad Tewaree, of Sissendie, became Chukladar of Poorwa, and the old feud was again at work. Kasheepershad swore on the Ganges to forget it entirely, and to bear no malice, and his oath at first lulled suspicion. But when he demanded an increase on the revenue, the fears of the family were soon awakened again. He summoned them to attend his court, but they did not think it safe to trust\n\n* It was in this same year that Mahomed Husun, the Nazim of Bahrach, had murdered Ramdut Pand\u00e9, the banker (who stood to him in much the same relation that Chundun Lal did to the Baiswara Nazim), in a very similar way, and this event had perhaps made Chundun Lal's people more watchful and suspicious.\n\n\u2020 Many readers will recollect the name of Rao Rambux as the leader of the murderous attack on Captains Thomson and Delafosse, and other fugitives from the Cawnpore massacre, at Buxar close to Doondea Khera. Raja Drigbijie Singh, of Morarmen, six miles lower down the Ganges, was the man who preserved their lives, and sent them in to General Havelock's camp. Rao Rambux was hanged over against the Buxar temple\u2014a fit retribution for his cowardly treachery.\nthemselves in his hands, and sent a wretched vakeel instead, who was instantly thrown into prison and ironed, as a gentle hint of what his masters might expect. About this time Chundun Lal's younger brother, Gungapershad, and his grandson, Balgobind, came from Cawnpore to Morawun, crossing the Ganges at Nujjufgurh. Kasheepershad got intimation of this and sent his agent, Shunker Lal, a Hurha man, with a few hundred followers, to intercept them. Gungapershad was shot dead with a ball through his chest, and Balgobind was knocked down by a shot which struck the handle of his sword. Thinking they had done their work, the assassins plundered their victims of a large sum of money they had with them (about Rs. 25,000), and went off leaving Balgobind, who, with the rest of his followers, reached Morawun safely. Old Chundun Lal was not the man to sit down quietly under such an insult as that. He first applied for redress to the Vizir Nuwab Ali Nukee Khan, and being refused justice there went to Mr. Greathed, Magistrate of Cawnpore. He had a house and a good deal of landed property in the Cawnpore district, and could thus claim protection as a British subject, though residing in Oudh. Mr. Greathed wrote to the Resident, Colonel Sleeman, who at once took up the case and insisted on justice being done. The king at first was very much offended with Chundun Lal for appealing to the Company's authority to get him redress for an injury done in Oudh, and banished him from the country, but subsequently this order was denied when the Resident interfered, and it never was carried out. After a delay of about nine months, Kasheepershad was dismissed from his chukladarship, ordered to repay the Rs. 25,000 which he had plundered from Gungapershad, banished the kingdom for two years, and declared incapable of entering the Government service again.* This was a very severe sentence, and nothing but the pressure steadily exerted by the Resident would have secured it.\n\n\"Chundun Lal died in 1854 A.D. at the great age of 82. He retained his faculties to the last, but during the later years of his life the business was chiefly carried on by his favourite son, Gowrie Shunker, the present Raja. Though Kasheepershad was punished, Gowrie Shunker did not recover the estate he had lost. After annexation a portion of it was settled with him, and in the talookdaree settlement which followed the rebellion he recovered all he had ever possessed. During the rebellion he behaved with the most unshaken loyalty; both at Cawnpore, at Lucknow, and at the Alumbagh, his agents and relations were indefatigable in providing supplies and information, and no act of complicity with the rebel leaders has ever been brought home to him. As a reward for this, he was one of the six talookdars whom Lord Canning's famous proclamation of March, 1858, exempted from the universal confiscation, and he has subsequently received the title of Raja.\"\n\nMAURANWAN\u2014Pargana MAURANWAN\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO.\u2014Lies in latitude 26\u00b030' north, and longitude 80\u00b058' east, and is six miles east of the tahsil, and twenty-six from the sadr station.

The town is surrounded with mango groves and Mahua trees. The climate is good, and the water sweet. There is a police station, a sar\u00e1e, and a school.\n\nThis place was founded by M\u00faraj Dhuj, a S\u00farajbansi Chhattri.

This man was a servant of the Delhi king, and got the land as j\u00e1g\u00edr when he succeeded in conquering a Bhar fort that stood on the site of it. M\u00e1n Singh razed the fort to the ground, and founded this village calling it after himself. Various kheras (hamlets) were founded on the adjacent land by the descendants of M\u00e1n, and they for a long time held qubuliats of the village also. The Dikhit Chhattirs made a gift of the village to the ancestors of Shekh Mans\u00far. The permanent settlement was made with Bh\u00fap Singh, Bais Sibasi. The annual assessment fixed is at Rs. 5,850.

It was afterwards in the possession of Brahmins, but they were extirpated by Im\u00e1m Zinda Khan, who came here as ris\u00e1l\u00edd\u00e1r with T\u00e1t\u00e1r Khan, the governor of Oudh. The cause of the fight was that the Hindus had insulted one Sayyad Jal\u00e1l, whose tomb is at Basorhi, during the Holi festival. The latter appealed to the ris\u00e1l\u00edd\u00e1r, who in fighting the Brahmins lost his brother, and to console him was granted the parganas of Mawai and Basorhi by Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Ghori. The village now pays a Government revenue of Rs. 1,700, and is in the possession of the descendants of the conqueror. It is held under the imperfect pattidari tenure. There are 27 wells and 24 ponds for irrigation purposes. A mud well fit to be worked with a pur (leathem bucket) can be made at a cost of Rs. 15 to 16, and a masonry well at Rs. 250. The river Kaly\u00e1ni is one of the boundaries of this village.\n\nThe Government has charged the villagers with the cost of an additional police force, for a period of twelve months, on \"account of the turbulent character of the zamindars.\"\nMAWAI MAHOL\u00c1RA Pargana\u2014Tahsil R\u00c1M SANEHI GH\u00c1T\u2014District BARA BANKI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by parganas Rudauli and Basorhi, on the east by Khand\u00e1nsa of the Fyzabad district, on the south by the Gumti, and on the west by the Kaly\u00e1ni. It is 17 miles from east to west, and 16 from north to south. Its area is 71 square miles or 45,039 acres, 23,897 acres are cultivated and 21,070 acres uncultivated. The irrigated portion amounts to 8,467 acres, and the unirrigated to 15,430. The river Kaly\u00e1ni flows through the pargana. The Gumti skirts it for a distance of 17 miles. The soil is for the most part dumat (loam). The average rainfall for the last three years amounted to 40 inches. Water is met with at 23 feet from the surface. Irrigation is chiefly carried on from wells, the irrigation from which gives an outturn of 15 maunds per bigha, that from ponds 10 maunds per bigha. The chief article of traffic is grain which is in times of scarcity exported to Kaithi Gh\u00e1t, &c. Richh Gh\u00e1t on the Gumti is 4 miles distant from Mahol\u00e1ra, Kaithi and Sihor Gh\u00e1ts on the Gogra, 16 and 22 miles respectively. There are four schools in the pargana; at Sahondra there is a registry office, and at Mawai a police post. There is a temple in honour of Richh Mah\u00e1deo at Richh. Mawai has a market attended by 1,000 people. The Government revenue amount to Rs. 56,212.

There are five villages with a population of above 2,000.\n\nThis pargana is believed to have been from early times in the possession of Chhattris, and as they were defaulters of the Government revenue, Akbar stationed an officer to check the irregularity, at Mahol\u00e1ra, which village owes its origin to a Bhar Chief.

It is 77 miles south-east of Fatebgarh, 34 west of Lucknow; it was formerly called Bhopatpur, and it was built in 1185 A.H. (1771 A.D.) by Mian Alm\u00e1s Ali Khan, a eunuch, and finance minister under \u00c1sif-ud-daula and Sa\u00e1dat\nAli Khan. Lord Valentia in 1803 found it prosperous. Heber in 1823 found \"trees, towers, gates, and palaces sinking fast into rubbish and forgetfulness.\" A fine bridge was built here over the Sai by Mi\u00e1n Alm\u00e1s. The mutineers were defeated here in 1857. There are two masonry sar\u00e1es for travellers. Population 3,555, of whom 2,451 are Hindus, 1,104 Musalmans. There are 4 temples and 13 mosques.\n\nColonel Sleeman writes as follows (Tour in Oude, Vol. I., pages 320 to 322):\n\n\"Meean Almas, after whom this place Meeangunge takes its name, was an eunuch. He had a brother, Rahmut, after whom the town of Rahmutganj, which we passed some days ago, took its name. Meean Almas was the greatest and best man of any note that Oudh has produced. He held for about forty years this and other districts, yielding to the Oude Government an annual revenue of about eighty lacs of rupees. During all this time he kept the people secure in life and property, and as happy as people in such a state of society can be, and the whole country under his charge was during his lifetime a garden. He lived here in a style of great magnificence, and was often visited by his sovereign, who used occasionally to spend a month at a time with him at Meeangunga. A great portion of the lands held by him were among those made over to the British Government on the division of the Oude territory by the treaty of 1801, concluded between Saadut Allee Khan and the then Governor-General, Lord Wellesley.\n\n\"The country was then divided into equal shares according to the rent-roll at the time. The half made over to the British Government has been ever since yielding more revenue to us, while that retained by the sovereign of Oude has been yielding less and less to him; and ours now yields in land-revenue, stamp-duty, and the tax on spirits, two crores and twelve lacs a year, while the reserved half now yields to Oude only about one crore, or one crore and ten lacs. When the cession took place, each half was estimated at one crore and thirty-three lacs. Under good management the Oude share might in a few years be made equal to ours and perhaps better, for the greater part of the lands in our share have been a good deal impoverished by over-cropping, while those of the Oude share have been improved by long fallows. Lands of the same natural quality in Oude, under good tillage, now pay a much higher rate of rent than they do in our half of the estate.\n\n\"Almas Allee Khan, at the close of his life, was supposed to have accumulated immense wealth, but when he died he was found to have nothing, to the great mortification of his sovereign, who seized upon all. Large sums of money had been lent by him to the European merchants at Lucknow, as well as to native merchants all over the country. When he found his end approaching, he called for all their bonds and destroyed them. Mr. Ousely and Mr. Paul were said to have at that time owed to him more than three lacs of rupees each. His immense income he had expended in useful works, liberal hospitality, and charity. He systematically kept in check the talookdars, or great landholders, fostered the smaller, and encouraged and protected the better classes of cultivators, such as Lodhies, Koor-\nmies, and Kachies whom he called and considered his children. His reign over the large extent of country under his jurisdiction is considered to have been its golden age. Many of the districts which he held were among those transferred to the British Government by the treaty of 1801, and they were estimated at the revenue which he had paid for them to the Oude Government. This was much less than any other servant of the Oude Government would have been made to pay for them, and this accounts, in some measure, for the now increased rate they yield to us. Others pledged themselves to pay rates which they never did or could pay; and the nominal rates in the accounts were always greater than the real rates. He never pledged himself to pay higher rates than he could and really did pay.\"\n\n**MIRANPUR OR AKBARPUR\u2014Pargana Akbarpur\u2014Tahsil Akbarpur\u2014District Fyzabad.**\u2014The history and description of this town are related under pargana Akbarpur; the fort and bridge over the Tons are objects of attraction. It is on the road and railroad from Fyzabad to Jaunpur 36 miles from the former; there are also roads to Azamgarh and Gorakhpur. The population consists of 902 Hindus, and 807 Musalmans of whom 40 are Shias. There are 13 mosques and other religious edifices of the Musalmans, including one fine im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, and two Hindu temples. There are also tahsil and a police station, a post-office, and a school. There are two sar\u00e9es. Market days are Mondays and Fridays.\n\n**MIRPUR KATHA\u2014Pargana Mangalsi\u2014Tahsil Fyzabad\u2014District Fyzabad.**\u2014This village is 12 miles from Fyzabad. Its population is 2,500, of whom 42 are Musalmans. There are 437 houses and one temple to Mah\u00e1deo. It is not on any line of road.\n\n**MISRIKH Pargana\u2014Tahsil Misrikh\u2014District Sitapur.**\u2014Pargana Misrikh is bounded on the north by pargana Maholi, on the east by parganas Sitapur, R\u00e1nkot, and Machhrehta, on the south by parganas Kursuna and Aurangabad, and on the west by the rivers Katana and Gumti. In area it is 121 square miles, of which only 66 are cultivated.\n\nThe acreage is given thus\u2014\n\n| Cultivated | ... | ... | ... | 42,578 acres. |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|\n| Culturable | ... | ... | ... | 25,042 ,,    |\n| Rent-free  | ... | ... | ... | 3,770 ,,     |\n| Barr\u00e9n     | ... | ... | ... | 9,770 ,,     |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | ... | 81,160 ,, |\n\nThe incidence of the Government demand is as follows:\n\n| On cultivated area | ... | ... | Rs. 1 9 7 |\n| On assessed       | ... | ... | 0 15 5   |\n| On total          | ... | ... | 0 13 5   |\n\nThe population is thus classified:\n\n| Hindus, agricultural | ... | ... | 21,900 |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | 16,076 |\n| Musalmans, agricultural | ... | ... | 796   |\n| \" non-agricultural   | ... | ... | 8,547  |\n\nTotal | ... | ... | 41,319 |\n\n* By Mr. M. L. Ferrar, C.S., Assistant Commissioner.\nAnd these live in 7,946 houses, to each of which there are thus 5-1 individuals. To every square mile there are 328 souls. Each head of the agricultural population has 1-8 acres of cultivated, against 3 acres of assessed area. From which facts it is seen that there is very considerable room for extension of cultivation.\n\nThe Musalmans are 8 per cent. of the entire population. With the exception of a sandy tract to the east of, and adjoining the Katna and Gumti rivers, the soil of the pargana is on the whole good. It is like the rest of this district, well wooded. There are no lakes, mountains, or forests to be met with.\n\nTwo roads cross it, both from Sitapur. One passes on to Nimkh\u00e1r, the other further north to D\u00e1dhanmau on the Gumti, and there is a cross-country road joining Misrikh to Machhrehta. With these and the Gumti the pargana is well provided with means of communication.\n\nBi-weekly bazars are held at Misrikh, which is the headquarters of a tahsil, at Qutubnagar, the residence of Taluqdar Mirza Ahmad Beg, at A\u00fat, the residence of R\u00e1ja Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur, and at Wazirnagar, the Sitapur residence of the Gaur R\u00e1ja of Paw\u00e1yan in Sh\u00e1ljah\u00e1npur.\n\nThe pargana derives its name from that of the town. The original lords of the soil were Ahban Chhattirs, whose dynasty expired 200 years ago on the death of R\u00e1ja M\u00e1n Singh. The founder of the r\u00e1j was Sopi Chand, whose brother, Gopi Chand, founded Gopamau in the Hardoi district; Sopi made his headquarters at Pataunja, three miles west of Misrikh, now an inconsiderable village, but in his days a very extensive city. To the present day the site of one of its gates is pointed out three miles to the north-west in the village of Sultannagar, where there is an ancient temple marking the spot.\n\nThe Abbans were succeeded by Panw\u00e1rs, K\u00e1yaths, Musalmans, and others, including Brahmans, whose descendants are still in possession of their forefathers' acquisitions.\n\nThe pargana contains 139 demarcated villages, of which 108 are zamindari, and are thus distributed.\u201435 Panw\u00e1r, 45 Gaur, 10 K\u00e1yath, 6 Brahmans (D\u00edchhits), 3 Gosh\u00e1\u00edns, 8 Musalmans, 1 Ahban. The taluqdaris (31) are held by Mirza Ahmad Beg of Qutubnagar and R\u00e1ja Shamsher Bah\u00e1dur of A\u00fat; an account of the former has been given under the Aurangabad pargana. The A\u00fat R\u00e1ja is commonly styled a Mughal, but is in reality a Y\u00fasuf Zai Path\u00e1n; his ancestor having come to Delhi in 1739 A.D. with N\u00e1dir Shah's invading army. Subsequently the r\u00e1ja's great grandfather, Mirza \u00c1gha Muhammad Ali Beg, being sent in command of troops to Oudh, was rewarded for good service by the grant of a landed estate. The title of r\u00e1ja is inherited by the taluqdar from his father, Muhammad Akbar Beg, upon whom, W\u00e1jid Ali Shah, of Oudh, conferred it.\n\nDown to 1210 fa\u0161li, or 74 years ago, the pargana consisted of 1,009 villages. In that year 466 were put into Maholi, and 159 into Nimkh\u00e1r. The remaining 884 were increased by 5 from Machhrehta; and thus the number remained until we took the country, when 50 were put into the neighbouring parganas, and 2 were added from Gopamau, making up 341.\nUnder the description of the town of Misrikh will be found particulars of the sacred tank Saraset and Dadh\u00edch temple in that town, and of the fairs held there. These fairs are parts of the holy pilgrimages or parkarma which begins at Nimkh\u00e1r, and after passing through 8 or 10 holy places ends at Misrikh.\n\nThe chief community of the non-sanad holding zamindars is the Gaur brotherhood which owns the Bihat il\u00e1qa. The r\u00e1ja of Paw\u00e1yan who owns Wazirnagar is also a Gaur-Chhattri.\n\nThe pargana is not famous in history, nor is it remarkable for anything in the present day. Any notoriety it may possess is acquired from the facts that it is the headquarters of a tahsildar, and that the town is a very holy one in the eyes of the people.\n\n**MISRIKH**\u2014Pargana MISRIKH\u2014Tahsil MISRIKH\u2014District SITAPUR.\u2014Misrikh is a very ancient town, indeed, and there are numerous legends connecting its foundation with the mythological R\u00e1ja Dadh\u00edch. The name is said to be derived from the Sanskrit participle *misrita*, which means mixed; because in the large tank which is here the waters of all the holy places in India are supposed to have been mixed.\n\nThe town contains a population of 2,113, of whom only 226 belong to the creed of Isl\u00e1m, the rest being chiefly Brahmans. It is 13 miles south from Sitapur, the Hardoi road running through it; and it is also connected by an unmetalled road six miles in length, with Machhrehta on the east. It lies in 27\u00b026' north and 80\u00b034' east. The tank abovementioned is apparently of very ancient construction. Local tradition asserts that it was built by Bikram\u00e1j\u00edt 19 centuries ago, before which time the holy springs had not been surrounded by any masonry protection. In more modern times, 125 years ago, it is said, a Mahratta princess, Abilya B\u00e1\u00ed by name, repaired the damages which time had occasioned in the ghats: and it is now a very fine specimen of the Hindus' sacred tank. On one brink of it is a very old temple sacred to Dadh\u00edch abovementioned, who seems to have been not only a secular r\u00e1ja but also a spiritual leader\u2014a great Rikh (Mah\u00e1-rishi). He was probably the Rishi, Rikh Dadhi\u00e1nch of the Rig Veda.\n\nThe town is but a poor one; it has 472 mud-built and only three masonry houses, two insignificant mosques, and no manufactures.\n\nIt is the headquarters however of a tahsildar, and has consequently a police station, a post-office, a registry office, distillery, and schools. There is no sar\u00e1c, as the Brahmans entertain all strangers. The bazar is held twice a week, and requires no notice. But at the large fair held during the Holi, and at which 5,000 sinners flock to purify their bodies in the holy waters of the tank, a brisk trade is carried on; the annual value of all the sales being put down at Rs. 39,428. There is a smaller fair held in the autumn.

In a great battle between the deotas and the giants the deotas were defeated. They went to implore the aid of the drowsy god Brimha, upon his snowy mountain top. He told them to go to Missik and arm themselves with the bones of the old sage Dudeej. They found Dudeej alive, and in excellent health; but they thought it their duty to explain to him their orders. He told them that he should be very proud indeed to have his bones used as arms in so holy a cause; but he had unfortunately vowed to bathe at all the sacred shrines in India before he died, and must perform his vow. Grievously perplexed, the deotas all went and submitted their case to their leader, the god Indur. Indur consulted his chaplain, Brisput, who told him that there was really no difficulty whatever in the case; that the angels of all the holy shrines in India had been established at and around Neemsar by Brimha himself, and the deotas had only to take water from all the sacred places over which they presided and pour it over the old sage to get both him and themselves out of the dilemma. They did so, and the old sage, expressing himself satisfied, gave up his life. In what mode it was taken no one can tell me. The deotas armed themselves with his bones, attacked the giants forthwith, and gained an easy and complete victory. The wisdom of the orders of drowsy old Brimha in this case is as little questioned by the Hindoos of the present day as that of the orders of drunken old Jupiter was in the case of Troy by the ancient Greeks and Romans. Millions, 'wise in their generation,' have spent their lives in the reverence of both.\"\u2014Sleeman's Tour in Oudh, Volume 2, pages 5-6.\n\nMITAULI\u2014Pargana KASTA\u2014Tahsil Muhamdi\u2014District KHERI.\u2014This village is situated on the left of the road from Lakhimpur to Maikalganj, and at a distance of about two miles to the east of the Kathna, being surrounded by large groves of mango trees and by cultivated land.

It has a market in which articles of country consumption are sold and exchanged.\n\nMitauli was the residence of the late R\u00e1ja Lone Singh, for whose rebellion during the year 1857-58 it was confiscated under a judicial sentence. In reward for good services during that period, Government conferred the proprietary rights in this and other villages on Captain Orr, who sold them to R\u00e1ja \u00c1mir Hasan Khan, taluqdar of Mahmudabad. The fort was a very strong one, but was abandoned without opposition by the r\u00e1ja on the approach of the English troops.\n\n| Population | ... | ... | ... | 2,006 |\n|------------|-----|-----|-----|-------|\n| Hindus     | ... | ... | ... | 1,859 |\n| Musalmans  | ... | ... | ... | 147   |\n\nThe following is from Sleeman's Tour in Oudh:\n\n\"Lonee Sing's estate of Mitholee is in the Mahomdee district, and under the jurisdiction of the Amil; and it is only the portion consisting of one hundred and four recently acquired villages which he holds in the Pyla estate, in the Khyrabad district, that has been made over to the Huzoor Tabseel.* He offered an increased rate for these villages to the then Amil, Bhow-ood-Dowlah, in the year A.D. 1840.

It is twenty-four miles north-west from Unao. Its distance from Lucknow with which it is connected by a good though unmetalled road is eighteen miles. In addition to this it has other roads running through it from Aur\u00e1s and Malihabad to Bani Bridge on the Lucknow and Cawnpore road, crossing the Cawnpore railway at Harauni station, and others which proceed west over the Sai into Unao. The town is picturesquely situated on the banks of the Sai, which is crossed a little below the town by a fine and massive bridge built by Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Newal R\u00e1e, K\u00e1yath, the minister of Safdar Jang. The town consists of 1,117 houses, and contains one or two good streets paved with brick. The inhabitants number 4,627, half of whom are Muhammadans, and many of them are of respectable families, who in the Nawabi found service in the city or at court, but now live on the produce of their groves. But for two professions the town has always been celebrated\u2014it's learned Muhammadan doctors of physic, and its mimics and actors of the Muhammadan class, who have returned here to live on the fortunes they have earned.\n\n* \"Anrod Sing holds twenty-eight villages in the Pyla estate, acquired in the same way as those held by Lonee Sing.\"\nThe town is said to derive its name from a pious Gosh\u00e1in named Mohan Gir, who cut a passage for the Ganges, and gathering his disciples around him passed his time in prayer. But it probably possesses more history than this, or it would not have become Muhammadan, and the centre of administration for the pargana. Near the bridge already mentioned is a high mound which seems to have been the site of a fort. It is not certainly natural, a well has been sunk through its centre, and at several places on its steep side may be seen the remains of pipes in a good state of preservation through which water was apparently drawn from a reservoir supplied from the river. The piping is the work of potters, the separate pipes are some twenty inches in diameter, four inches in depth, and curved to enable one to lap over the other. The workmanship is of no mean order, and they doubtless belong to a time when the dth (deserted site) was inhabited; but no one knows its history. On the summit is an old tomb raised to one Shah Modan, a reputed saint. The town is now of no importance for trade, and not even a market is held here; but it is the seat of the tahsil from which the parganas of Moh\u00e1n Aur\u00e1s, Asiwan Ras\u00falabad, Jhalotar Ajgain, Gorinda Parsandan, are administered. Of the population 1,766 are Musalmans and 3,054 are Hindus.\n\nMOH\u00c1N\u2014District KHERI.\u2014A river which separates the district of Kheri from Naip\u00e1l. It is originally a rivulet flowing from swamps; its channel is much below the surface of the country; it receives, however, a number of tributaries, among which may be mentioned the Katni and Gandhra; the latter a mountain stream. The river's volume increases, and below Chandan Chauki it is a considerable stream; the minimum discharge is 140 cubic feet per second*; the depth in the centre about two feet on the average; the breadth about 90 feet; the banks are steep, and from 20 to 30 feet above the water. It joins the Kaur\u00ed\u00e1la immediately above R\u00e1mnagar, district Khari. It is one of the few streams in Oudh in which good Mahsir fishing can be got.\n\nMOH\u00c1N AURAS Pargana\u2014Tahsil MOH\u00c1N\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by the districts of Lucknow and Hardoi, on the east by Lucknow, on the south by the pargana of Jhalotar Ajgain, and on the west by the Asiwan Ras\u00falabad pargana of the Unao district. It lies north-west by south-east across the meridian. Its shape is oblong, its length from end to end being about 22 miles and breadth from 8 to 9; latitude 26\u00b070' and longitude 80\u00b045' would about cross at the centre of pargana. The area of the pargana is 196 square miles. The number of villages is 205, with an average of 611 acres to a village. The river Sai runs through the pargana from north-west to south-east passing under the town of Moh\u00e1n. The bed of this river lies low, and the land on either side is generally poor, but in many parts of its course the country slopes gently down towards the stream, and more cultivation is carried on its banks, and more irrigation is derived from it than is usual from rivers. The river itself is narrow, shallow during the dry months of the year, and never used for navigation.\n\nOn the north side of the river the country is crossed by extensive s\u00e1r (barren) plains, which are completely bare of trees and all vegetation.\n\n* Sarda Canal Report page 20.\nbut to the south of the river the pargana is more cultivated and fertile. The total amount of barren is 26 per cent., which is high. The culturable is only 21 per cent., which is low, and 6,600 acres or 13 per cent. of this is under groves. Except round large villages, the pargana is not generally well wooded. Irrigation is fair amounting to 48 per cent., but three-fourths of this is from jhils and rivers. Water lies no more than 13 feet from the surface. The Nagwa stream divides the pargana for a short distance from K\u00e2kori. It dries up during the hot weather; its banks are high and precipitous, and the land on either side is unculturable. The cultivated land of the pargana is up to the usual average being 52.5 per cent., and the average holdings of the cultivators are from 3 to 4 acres.\n\nThe pargana is well provided with roads; a road connects the two principal towns of Moh\u00e1n and Aur\u00e1s; and the latter is again connected with the large town of Mi\u00e1nganj by a road which crosses the Sai to the south of Aur\u00e1s by a handsome bridge built by the British Government. Other roads lead from Moh\u00e1n (1) to Malihabad to the north, (2) to Lucknow lying east, (3) to Bani bridge (built by R\u00e2e Daulat R\u00e2e of Lucknow) on the Lucknow and Cawnpore road, crossing the Cawnpore Railway at Harauni, and (4) to Ras\u00fblabad and Nawabganj to the west in this district.\n\nThe revenue rate falls at Rs. 2-1-0 on the cultivated area, Re. 1-8-0 on the cultivated and culturable, and Re. 1-1-0 throughout. The population is 96,525, and falls at the rate of 502 per square mile on the whole area, and 937 per square mile of cultivated area. The following figures will show how the population is divided:\n\n| Community       | Population |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Musalmans       | 72 per cent. |\n| Hindus          | 92.8 \"     |\n| Agriculturists  | 59.5 \"     |\n| Non-Agriculturists | 40.5 \"   |\n\nThe largest towns are\u2014Mohan (4,627); Neotni (3,809); Ajgain (3,481); Mahr\u00e1jganj cum Newalganj (3,728). All of these are separately noticed. The tahsil, post-office, and police station have been fixed at Moh\u00e1n, and government schools have been established at Moh\u00e1n and other large towns of the pargana.\n\nFor a long time the pargana seems to have been inhabited by Hindus. The only Muhammadan centres were at Moh\u00e1n and Neotni, and no extensive colonies took place. Originally only some 25 out of 205 villages belonged to Musalmans, though of late years the Muhammadan taluqdars have acquired some 27. The remaining villages are held by independent zamin-dars, chiefly Chhatris and Brahmans. The former held 77\u00bd villages, the latter 34. These with 38 taluqdari villages, and 26 belonging to Musalmans almost divide the villages of the pargana. A tappa of 22 villages to the north of Mohan called Pachw\u00e2ra, sometimes Pachisi, was colonized by Janw\u00e2rs, and another of 52 villages in the centre of the pargana was held by Raikw\u00e2rs. Later the northern half of the pargana was formed into the new pargana of Aur\u00e1s, and was ruled from Sand\u00eela, while Moh\u00e1n was in chakla Safipur.\n\nMOHANGANJ Pargana\u2014Tahsil DIGBIJAIGANJ\u2014District RAE BARELI.\u2014This pargana is bounded on the north by pargana Simrauta of this dis-\ntrict and Jagdispur of Sultanpur, on the east by Gaura J\u00e1m\u00fan of the district of Sultanpur, on the south by pargana Rokha J\u00e1is of this district, and on the west by the Hardoi pargana. Its area is 80 square miles and its population 47,281, being at the rate of 591 per square mile. Of the soil 24,636 acres are cultivated, 5,925 fit for cultivation, and 20,334 are barren. The soil is more appropriated by taluqdars than by the zamindars; there being 40 villages owned by the former and 35 by the latter. The Government revenue is Rs. 54,165, being at the rate of Re. 1-12-4 per arable acre.\n\nThe landed property is thus divided:\n\n| Taluqdar\u00ed | Zamindar\u00ed |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Kanhpuria | ...       |\n| Other castes | ...       |\n| Total     | 40        |\n\nThe history of the Kanhpuria Chhattirs may conveniently be given under this pargana which contains their earliest settlements. It is as follows by Mr. Millet, C.S.:\n\nThe only family which require any notice are the Kanhpurias, whose ancestor, Parsh\u00e1d Singh, acquired possession of a large tract of country to the north-east of the district in Tilok Chand's time,\n\nThese trace their descent from the celebrated Rishi Bh\u00e1rat Dw\u00e1j, and their blood is enriched by the piety of 83 generations of saints and anchorites. The birth of K\u00e1nh, their first Chhattri ancestor, is involved in much obscurity.\n\nThe common tradition is shortly as follows:\n\nSuchh, a saint of distinction; lived at M\u00e1nikpur in the reign of the great M\u00e1nik Chand. A fable of Brahmanical invention describes and accounts for his marriage with the daughter of that r\u00e1ja.*\n\nFrom this marriage two sons were born, one of whom turned Brahman and the other Chhattri.\n\nThe Chhattri was K\u00e1nh, the eponymous hero of his tribe, who married into a\u2020 Bais family, abandoned M\u00e1nikpur, where he had succeeded as his mother's heir to the throne of M\u00e1nik Chand to his wife's relations, and founded the village of Kanhpur on the road from Salon to Partabgarh. The present tribe deity of the Kanhpurias is the Bhainsaha R\u00e1kshasa (buffalo demon) to whom they offer one buffalo at every third Bijai Dasi-mi, and another for every wedding or birth which has occurred in their chief's family since the last sacrifice. I regard this tradition as extremely important.\n\nAll the leading tribes of whose immigration there can be no doubt retain distinct legends of their former homes.\n\nHere it is admitted that the founder of the tribe in these parts was also the first of his people who was admitted into the Hindu caste system, as\n\n*This princess, the only daughter of M\u00e1nik Chand, seems to have contracted several alliances, and to have transmitted the r\u00e1j and the Gharw\u00e1r blood by each.\n\n\u2020The r\u00e1ja of Tiloi says a Bisen of Manjholi. The moral is the same.\nhis father the Rishi, and his ancestors; the 83 preceding anchorites, were of course of no caste at all. The connection with the Bais is more important than that with M\u00e1nik Chand, as the latter is introduced into legends of every date from Mahm\u00fad Ghaznavi down to Husen Shah Sharqi.\n\nK\u00e1nh\u2019s sons, S\u00e9hu and R\u00e1hu, completed the conquest of the territory to the north-west of K\u00e1nhpur by inflicting a decisive defeat on the Bhars, whose kings, the brothers Tiloki and Biloki, were left dead on the battle field. Their names are preserved in the neighbouring villages of Tiloi and Biloi.\n\nI am averse to ignorant etymological speculations, but think that the following remarks may not be wholly valueless.\n\nThe identity of the stories in all their leading features, as well as the similarity of the names, makes it probable that Tiloki and Biloki, of the Kanhpuria legend, are no other than the D\u00e1l and B\u00e1l of the nearly contemporaneous Bais and of the Muhammadans of the next century; and this conjecture is strengthened by the constant recurrence of the termination o\u00ed in places undeniably connected with the Bhar rule. The central village of the Hardoi district, which has the remains of a Bhar fort, the pargana of Hardoi in this district, close under a great Bhar centre, and the pargana of Bhadohi, in the Mirzapur district, mentioned by Mr. Carney in his report on the races of Oudh, all perhaps originally bore one name\u2014Bhardoi.\n\nIt may be added that the local pronunciation of Bareli is Baroli; the introduction of a liquid between the two vowels is easily intelligible, and the original name may have been Baroi or Baloi, by which it is at once etymologically connected with its reputed founder B\u00e1l. Comparing these results with the Kanhpuria tradition, I venture most diffidently to conjecture that o\u00ed in the words Tiloi and Biloi is a mere affix, and that the roots are Til and Bil, which are identical with D\u00e1l and B\u00e1l, the roots of Dalmau and Bareli. The termination oki was probably a later invention, founded on the old names of the two villages, and in Tiloki and Biloki we recognize the two chiefs who fell at Pakhrauli resisting the Jaunpur emperor. I refrain from pushing this train of conjecture further to what might be an unwarrantable conclusion. The line of the Kanhpurias was maintained through a series of five inglorious chieftains down to the times of Parsh\u00e1d Singh.\n\nWhile these events had been going on in Baisw\u2019ra, the Kanhpurias had not been ingloriously quiet. Jagat Singh, of Simrauta, acquired a name, though it is now difficult to say what for. His descendants state that the emperor of Delhi presented him with a robe of honour, a drum and a spear, for clearing the high road of Bhars. His cousin of Tiloi, Kh\u00e1nd\u00e9 R\u00e1e, led his clansmen nominally on a pilgrimage to Dalmau, but actually on a raid for plunder and extended territory. He was resisted successfully by the Path\u00e1ns of Pahremau, whose leader, Mu\u00edn Khan, a name which does not occur in any pedigree, wounded the Kanhpuria chieftain, but purchased his success with his life.\nKh\u00e2nde R\u00e2e was succeeded on the throne of Tiloi by \u00dadebh\u00e1n, who verified the statements of the Tiloi Kanhpurias, that every other of their r\u00e2jas was a fainting. Under his weak Government the Kurmis, who occupied forty-two villages in Jagdispur,* rose in arms.\n\nTheir leader was a D\u00e2si R\u00e2m who embraced the Musalman faith, and procured assistance from his co-religionists on the banks of the Ganges. With a body of seven hundred Mughal cavalry he plundered and burnt the villages of the Chhattri zamindars whose r\u00e2ja could do nothing to protect them.\n\nFraud was successful where force failed, and a Gautam in the Kanhpuria\u2019s pay gained D\u00e2si R\u00e2m\u2019s confidence, and treacherously assassinated him out hunting.\n\nFor this service he was granted the Kurmi\u2019s villages, some of which are still held by his descendant Mahip\u00e1l Singh, taluqdar of B\u00e9ra.\n\nThe suppression of this Kurmi insurrection is with probability referred to the commencement of the vigorous reign of S\u00fbrat Singh, who succeeded to the throne between 1670 and 1680 A.D.\n\nThis prince though blind was distinguished for his ability and enterprise, and uniting the scattered branches of his clan under one banner was the first of the powerful chiefs of Tiloi, who ruled with semi-regal authority over a district which at one time comprised fourteen entire parganas.\n\nA prince of S\u00fbrat Singh\u2019s energy was not likely to remain long at peace with his neighbours, and a friendly interview afforded him the desired pretext for invading the contiguous domains of the Sombansis.\u2020 Partab Singh was lame, and, on asking after S\u00fbrat Singh\u2019s health, received the ordinary polite reply \u201capke qadam dekhne se,\u201d to which angrily retorted with reference to S\u00fbrat Singh\u2019s blindness, I too am well \u201capke chashm dekhne se.\u201d The personal insult was eagerly welcomed, and S\u00fbrat Singh marched at the head of his clansmen against Partabgarh.\n\nHe was met at Hindaur and an obstinate battle resulted in the defeat of the Kanhpurias. As their chieftain was being carried from the field he felt the wind strike on his sightless eyes and asked from which quarter it came, and the answer, from the west, conveyed the first information of his defeat. His retreating forces were covered by a zamindar of N\u00e2in, who commanded the then unusual arm of a hundred matchlockmen, and who for this received the grant of thirteen villages in the Salon pargana, which formed the root of the present large N\u00e2in taluqas.\n\n* Bealisas are perhaps exceptionally common in this neighbourhood; the tahsil of Haidargarh in Bara Banki alone has the three Amethia bealisas of R\u00e2mnagar, Sonakpur and B\u00e9ra, the P\u00e2ndes Bealisai of Shinnaur, the Kurmis of Sehgaon, the Sombansis of Baimti, the Shekha of Bhilwal, and the Dub\u00e9s of Kialha.\n\n\u2020 The term seems to denote any small collection of villages held by one coparcenary body.\n\nThe present territories of the Kanhpurias and Sombansis are separated by the wide estates, of the Bisens, but it does not appear that at the time of S\u00fbrat Singh the leaders of that tribe had attained the dignity of independent sovereigns. A very large part of their present property was under the rule of the Musalmans of M\u00e2nikpur, and of their three principal houses we find R\u00e2mpur ranged with the Kanhpuria and Dera and Dhingwas with the Sombansi. It is probable that they respectively owned the nominal supremacy of the chieftain in whose army they fought.\nS\u00farat Singh was succeeded at Tiloi by Gop\u00e1l Singh, who had two sons, Mohan and Newal.\n\nThe latter, though the youngest, held the first place in his father's affections, who formed the design of presenting him to the clan as their chieftain instead of his elder brother, who was one-eyed. Mohan Singh was not the man to permit the quiet transfer of his own rights to another, and he disappointed his father by accelerating his death.\n\nThe whole force of the tribe was collected round Tiloi, and it was intended that Newal Singh should be proclaimed publicly the heir to the r\u00e1j. Mohan Singh immediately took steps to prevent this occurrence.\n\nHe first went to his mother, and compelled her to disclose the place where the treasure was buried; and then taking a faithful Bahelia, whose descendants are still in honourable employ at Tiloi, proceeded to his father's room. The servant took aim from the doorstep, and Gop\u00e1l Singh fell shot through the back. Mohan then rushed forward, cut the old man's head off, and stooping over the body made the royal tilak on his forehead in his father's hot blood. He then put on the ornaments of his new rank and went to the army. The news of the parricide had gone before him, and he found the soldiers on the verge of mutiny: nor was subordination restored till he assured them that the death of the old r\u00e1ja would not affect their pay or injure any one but the murderer himself, who took on his own head the wrath of the gods. He deemed it wise, however, to distract their attention from the horrid event, and inaugurated his rule by leading them against the rich Sayyads of the south, where the plunder of Mustafabad confirmed the wavering in their allegiance.\n\nOn his return to Tiloi he was besieged by the D\u00edw\u00e1n of Hasanpur, who had collected a large force to punish the son who had murdered his father, and the feudatory who had affixed the royal mark with his own hands and without the consent of his suzerain. The fort was beleaguered for seven days, and on each day the D\u00edw\u00e1n created a new r\u00e1ja from the leading Kanhpurias, who stood aloof from their chieftain.\n\nFinally Mohan Singh gave in, consented to recognize the D\u00edw\u00e1n as his liege lord, and received the tilak afresh at his hands.\n\nInheriting the aggressive policy of his grandfather, and carrying it out with greater success, he next set the whole forces of his clan in motion against the Bais of Dalmau. Amar Singh, the r\u00e1na, met him with nearly equal forces, and the boundaries of Baiswara and Kanhpuria land were fixed in the very centre of Rae Bareli, along the line of the Jah\u00e1napad mohalla. The invader is still remembered at Rae Bareli as the founder of the R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t on the river Sai. Turning northward, and reducing in succession the Musalman villages of Pahremau, Am\u00e1wan, Oiah, Kathwara, R\u00e1hi, Rasht\u00e1, B\u00e1wan, Buzurg, and Balla, he marched through the Jagdispur pargana, where he was met by the *Bh\u00e1le Sult\u00e1ns, whom he forced to recognize his supremacy, and completed his circle of conquest by marching through Inhauna and Subeha to M\u00e1nikpur, whence he returned to his home at Tiloi.\n\n* He appears to have been called in by R\u00e1ja Nih\u00e1l Khan of Jagdispur, who was on bad terms with his leading feudatories.\nThe season of his repose was occupied by the celebration of his marriages first into the family of the old allies of his house, the Bisens of R\u00e1mpur in Partabgarh, and secondly with a daughter of the Bahrelas of S\u00farajpur in Bara Banki.\n\nAfter a short breathing time he started on a fresh expedition with extended views. Marching through the recently conquered pargana of Hardoi he encountered the Naihsthas of Bachhr\u00e1w\u00e1n under the command of the gallant young bastard of Sidhaul\u00ed, and his total discomfiture deterred him from ever again attacking the too powerful chieftains of Baisw\u00e1ra.\n\nHe might find some consolation in the easy conquest of the eastern parts of Nawabganj and south of Fyzabad, and when he finally returned to Tiloi, he was the acknowledged master of 14 parganas. When Sa\u00e1dat Khan came back from the reduction of Bhagwant R\u00e1e Kh\u00edchchar, he marched against Tiloi. The R\u00edja was old and feeble, and, when a sally led by his younger brother Newal Singh, had failed, he submitted unconditionally, and the next year saw his death.\n\nWith the commencement of the Nawabi the intricate task of fixing dates and synchronisms ceases, and there is no further difficulty in carrying the history down to the present day. Pem Singh succeeded his father Mohan Singh at Tiloi, and is only famous for having married a princess of the Gharw\u00e1rs of Bijapur. The lady is represented to have fallen in love with him and compelled the match, but the brilliancy of this chieftain\u2019s position dispenses with the necessity of so improbable an explanation. Power and wealth regulate Chhattiri marriages almost as frequently as caste, and to take an instance from this very family, Tiloi alone of all the Kanhpurias refuses to give its daughters to the Bais.\n\nAfter a reign of five years Pem Singh was succeeded by Balbhaddar Singh, the last of the great chieftains of this house. A child at the time of this father\u2019s death (it is said of him, as of almost all distinguished Hindus, that he was posthumous) his whole life was spent in arms.\n\nWhen quite young he led his forces to the defence of his faith at Benares and is said to have chased back to Mirzapur, the Mughals who wished to profane a Hindu temple. His next exploit was the protection of the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi against the S\u00farajbansis of Amorha and the Path\u00e1ns of Satt\u00e1si. On two distinct occasions he served in the armies of Dehli against the R\u00e1ja of Bhartpur and the Mahrattas; and the exaggeration of his chronicler relates that unaided he captured the raja of Sattara, and brought him in an iron cage to the presence of his imperial master.\n\nFor these services he was invested in succession with mansabs of four thousand and five thousand men, and was presented with a band of honour.\n\nIt is said that in the intoxication of victory his drummer beat a roll in the emperor\u2019s Darb\u00e1r. The grave impertinence was only punished by a\nmild rebuke, and the descendants of the forward musician still beat the drum for the rajas of Tiloi. It is possible that the possession of Mohan Singh's fourteen parganas was confirmed at Dehli, but the grant if made was not long recognized at Lucknow.*\n\nThe remainder of his life was spent in an unavailing struggle with the wasir, whose absence in Bengal enabled him to drive out the officials who had been left in charge of Jagdispur and Parshadepur, and temporarily to attain something like the power of his predecessors.\n\nOn the return of the Nawab he was hunted from place to place, and he was finally surprised at his devotions and cut down before an image of Mahadeo in the Kandu-ka-nala in Jagdispur.\n\nThe Muhammadan trooper who brought his head to the king was rewarded for his valuable tribute by the grant of two villages free of revenue in Gonda. It was at this time that the Chob or Chuab Nadi was finally recognized as the boundary of Baiswara and Kanhpuria land.\n\nBalbhaddar was childless, and his death, which took place in the summer of 1784 A.D., was followed by a long interregnum. Of his two widowed ronis one was immolated, and from the pyre formally invested Chhatardhari Singh of Shahmau with the raja's cap. The adoption was not recognized by the whole tribe, and the living rani adopted Shankar Singh, the ancestor of the present raja. For fifteen years a war of succession was waged without any decisive result, and a compromise was eventually effected, by which both competitors received the style of raja, and neither the throne of Tiloi. Shankar Singh took his title from Asni and Chhatardhari from Shahmau; and it was not till sometime afterwards that the former, a prudent and peaceful prince, recovered the centre of the traditions of his tribe. Tiloi has since descended quietly to the present owner, Raja Jagpal Singh, Chhatardhari's grandson. Dirgej Singh died without offspring, and was succeeded at Shahmau by his adopted son Raja Sukhmangal Singh.\n\nAt the time of Saadat Khan's invasion Simrauta was held by Mandhata Singh. He was left in possession of his ancestral pargana and conciliated by the honorary distinction of a drum and the titular mansab of seven thousand men. His great grandson was without children, and adopted his first cousin Raghu Nath Singh, the Babu of Chandapur, who was succeeded by his son Shiudarshan Singh, a fine specimen of the Rajput, cele-\n\n*The only documentary evidence which the present raja could produce on the subject is a Wajib-ul-ars of several heads addressed by Balbhaddar Singh to Abdul Mansur Khan. One head is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"I am the old zamindar of fourteen parganas inherited from Mohan Singh (namely Jais, Nasirabad, Salon, Rae Bareli, Manikpur, Hardol, Inhauna, Subeha, Takia, Basorhi, Budanli Saidanpur, Bilawan); this zamindari has been reduced; let me again hold it on the payment of 21 lakhs revenue.\n\nThis is crossed with the ambiguous order \"Badastur-i-qadim.\"\n\nAnother curious head is\u2014\n\n\"Let me deduct the expenses of my army from my revenue, or have them paid in full by Government.\"\n\nThe order on this is\u2014\"deduct from revenue.\" It is obvious that this proves very little but consciousness of power in the petitioner.\nbrated all over the district for a rare combination of bodily and mental vigour; and to whom I am under considerable obligations for the intelligent and even learned assistance he afforded me in collecting materials for this report. He has retired from the management of his estate, which is held by his grandson, Raja Jagmohan Singh.\n\nMOHANLALGANJ Pargana*\u2014Tahsil MOHANLALGANJ\u2014District LUCKNOW.\u2014The pargana of Mohanlalganj is one of the two into which the tahsil of this name is divided; it takes its name from a large ganj built by the Taluqdar, Raja Kashi Parshad. It is situated to the south-east of Lucknow, with which it is connected by two good unmetalled roads. The most northern of these runs east through the pargana to Sultanpur, the capital town of a neighbouring district. It passes through the bazar of Goshainganj and skirts the old pargana towns of Amethi and Salempur. The point where it enters the pargana is about six miles from Lucknow. The other road runs south-east from Lucknow to Rae Bareli, but has not much of its course in this pargana, for shortly after passing through the tahsil station of Mohanlalganj, it reaches the pargana of Nigohan Sissaindi. There is also a third road which connects Goshainganj with Mohanlalganj and continues south, joining the Lucknow and Cawnpore imperial road at Bani bridge on the river Sai. These roads are unmetalled, but are kept in good repair and bridged throughout. In addition to this, a system of country roads has been projected which is to connect all the principal bazars with each other.\n\nThe pargana is bounded on the west by the parganas of Bijnaur and Lucknow, on the north by the district of Bara Banki\u2014from which it is separated by the river Gumti,\u2014on the east by the Rae Bareli district, and on the south by its fellow-pargana of Nigohan.\n\nIt is compact and square-shaped, and contains an area of 200 square miles. Its greatest length from its northernmost corner on the Gumti to its southernmost, where the boundary line between Nigohan and Mohanlalganj ends, is fifteen miles, and its average breadth is twelve miles.\n\nIts population is 1,13,659 or 568 to the square mile. Of this 9.8 per cent is Musalman and 90.2 per cent Hindu.\n\nThe proportion of barren land in the district is large, being so much as 31.6 per cent. This is due to usar (barren) plains, which cross it from east to west, running through the centre of the pargana. The pargana is drained by a line of jhils that commences with the large Kurala jhil in Hulas Khera, and takes a south-easterly direction towards Nagram and by the Loni stream, which rising in a jhil near Parahta flows, east and joins the Gumti near Salempur; all the northern parts are drained by the Gumti itself. The height at this point above mean sea level is 372 feet.\n\nThe country along the Gumti is rough and broken, alternating with sandy tracts and wide ravines, and lowering as it approaches the bed of the river. But little irrigation is carried on from this river. In all other respects the country is fertile and well wooded. Its jhils, with seasonable rains, afford an ample supply of water. Wells can everywhere\n\n*By Mr. H. H. Butts, Assistant Commissioner.\nbe dug, water lying not more than twenty feet from the surface, with an average depth of ten feet of water. The percentage of irrigation is fair; it amounts to forty-five per cent. of cultivated land, but a great deal of this is from jhils, being nearly three-fourths. All the principal cereals are grown with sugarcane and poppy, and the usual vegetables immediately round the villages. The rice crops grown round the jhils near N\u00e1gr\u00e1m are specially fine.\n\nThe area still culturable is said to be 27 per cent, but of this 14-6 are groves, and the rest is not of a good quality, being largely mixed with sugar.\n\nThe population presses on the cultivated area at an average density of 1,103 per square mile, which is greater than in any other pargana, save Lucknow, of the district.\n\nThe average holdings are from three and a quarter to five and a half acres, and rents vary from Rs. 4-14 to Ra. 5-6; strange to say the latter rate is paid by the Brahmans, who are usually treated with leniency. They are in considerable numbers, but Ah\u00edrs, Kurmis, and P\u00e1s\u00eds\u2014paying rents of Rs. 5 to Rs. 6-10, and Rs. 4-14 per acre,\u2014furnish the great bulk of the cultivators. The two former castes hold from four to four and a half acres, the latter hold on an average little more than three acres. The K\u00e1chhis, who however are not very numerous, pay the high rate of Ra. 13-14 per acre. The high rates paid by the Brahmans may be partly due to the proprietorship of so many villages by Musalmans. As will be seen in other parganas, Musalmans generally exact higher rents than Hindus. The former hold eighty villages while the latter hold ninety.\n\nThe summary assessment of this pargana was Ra. 1,56,510, that now fixed is Rs 1,79,740. The revenue rate will fall:\n\nRs. 2 12 0 on the cultivated.\n\" 1 14 8 on cultivated and culturable.\n\" 1 7 0 throughout.\n\nThe proportion of non-agriculturists in this pargana is high. It amounts to 46\u00b72 per cent., and is due to the large villages and towns which the pargana contains and where they chiefly reside.\n\nIn addition to Amethi, the population of which is 7,128, there are six other towns and villages, with a population from two to five thousand. They are:\n\n| Town                  | Population |\n|-----------------------|------------|\n| Goeha\u00ednanj           | 3,691      |\n| Mohanlalganj         | 3,674      |\n| Nagr\u00e1m               | 4,978      |\n| Mirknagar            | 2,210      |\n| Salempur             | 2,365      |\n| Sameai                | 4,283      |\n\nand seventeen villages with a population of one to two thousand. They are Naiya Khurk\u00e1pur, \u00c1dampur, Naubaste, Utr\u00e1w\u00e1n, Bak\u00e1s, Bharauli,\nParahta, Parseni, Jokhundi, Sarae Gundauli, Qasimpur, Khujauli, and Karora, and large bazars are held in Amethi, Goshainganj, Mohanlalganj, and Nagram. All these four are separately noticed.\n\nManufactures and mechanical arts are at a low ebb, the former comprise the weaver class and cotton spinners (Julaha and Dhuniya). The weavers are thickest in Amethi, at which place the trade formerly flourished, but native stuffs have given place to the piece-goods imported from Europe.\n\nThe pargana was once known as the Amethi pargana, and was one of those into which the sarkar of Lucknow was divided (Ain-i-Akbari). It was colonized by the Amethi Rajputs of the Chamar-Gaur tribe, and under Raja Dingur, the most powerful of their leaders, became known as the pargana of Amethi Dingur. They were expelled at about the close of the fifteenth century by a family of Shekhs who became masters of the whole pargana. Salempur, to the north of the pargana was founded by this family, and the present Taluqdar, Chaudhri Nawab Ali, who holds the estate of Salempur, is descended from it.\n\nOf its early history it is hard to state anything with confidence. It is unanimously asserted to have been held by an aboriginal tribe of Bhar, and the country abounds in old Bhar dhis, which appear to be the sites of their old villages and forts. They are sometimes of great elevation and extent. They are quite deserted, and the only signs of the ancient habitations are the broken bricks which lie scattered over the mounds, and sometimes a hut on the summit devoted to some deified hero who is worshipped under the title of Bhir. There are no less than twenty of these Bhar dhis in the pargana. The Bhars are said to have ruled from Bahraich, and Amethi was one of their outposts. Common tradition asserts that the Hindu monarch of Kanauj in vain tried to wrest the country from them. He sent his two celebrated captains, Alha and Udal, who entrenched a camp first under Lachman Tilak, once the heart of the modern city of Lucknow; and next in Paharnagar Tikuria near which is a large well said to have been built by them. The high dh in the village is said to be the remains of their camp. This natural feature (Tekra or Pahar), a hill, seems to have given its name to the village. It lies on the borders of the Lucknow pargana, not far from Bakas, and it is from here that the plain of Lohgaujar, the battle field, the field of blood, or of iron, is said to begin. This name was presently extended to the whole of the plain lying between this and the Gogra which became known as Ganjarai. But Alha and Udal effected nothing. It was after this that the Amethias came into this pargana, which became named after them.\n\nAnother of the Bhar centres seems to have been Nagram, which was held by Raja Nal. It was these strong posts that the Muhammadans attacked in their first crescentade of A.D. 1030, under Sayyad Salar Massud, nephew of Mahmud of Ghazni. They swept through Nagram and Amethi, leaving their shahids and tombs, and perhaps a few families who maintained their hold in the village till the arrival of more of their sect at a later date. There is a family of Maliks in Amethi to this day,\nand of Sayyads in Nagr\u00e1m, who assert that they are descended from Malik Y\u00fasuf and Sayyad Miran of the early invasion.\n\nBut the Bhars closed up again, and the Musalman wave swept on, and they do not seem to have been finally driven out till the invasion of the future Amethi Rajputa, who came under R\u00e1ep\u00e1l Singh at the end of the fourteenth century. This family was itself expelled at the end of the fifteenth century, as has already been stated by Shekh Abul Husen, the founder of the Salempur family; but another branch of Amethias, who had established themselves at Nagr\u00e1m, suffered later; for according to the accounts given by the Sayyads, and documents still in their possession, their ancestor, Habibulla, who they assert dispossessed them, could not have come till about A.D. 1600. Other facts render this probable. Nagr\u00e1m was till a late date known as a separate pargana, and it can only have been their separate proprietorship of it by this branch of Amethi that made it one.\n\nThe Shekhs pretended to a right to the whole pargana, and it seems that it was more or less recognized. For at a later date came a family of Janw\u00e1rs from Ikauna in Bahraich, who settled at the west end of the pargana in Mau and Khujauli, and allow that they derive their title from the Shekhs. This family at one time produced a further division in the pargana, and a new pargana was formed in 1218 fa\u0161li (1811 A.D.) and called Khujauli.\n\nKhujauli was in the jurisdiction of the Baisw\u00e1ra Nay\u00e1g\u00e1n chakla. Nagr\u00e1m was ruled from Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n in Rae Bareli, and Amethi, the headquarters of which were in A.D. 1757 transferred to Gosh\u00e1inganj,\u2014so called from a Gosh\u00e1\u00edn commander of some N\u00e1ga troopers in the time of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula, who was granted the pargana of Amethi in j\u00e1gir, and built a ganj here, which subsequently gave its name to the pargana,\u2014was made Huz\u00far Tahsil. After the introduction of British rule, Mohanlalganj, on the road from Lucknow to Rae Bareli\u2014at which place R\u00e1ja K\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d, one of the loyal taluqdars, had built a handsome ganj and temple,\u2014was selected as the best place, for the centre of administration of the tahsil, and the pargana became henceforth known by its own name.\n\nA good deal of the tenure in this pargana is taluqdari. There are in all 171 villages, and taluqdars hold some sixty. The rest are held by smaller separate communities. The taluqdars who are proper to this pargana are:\u2014Chaudhri Nawab Ali of Salempur, Musamm\u00e1t Qutb-un-nisa of Gauria, Shekh Ab\u00fa Tur\u00e1b Khan of Dhaurahra, and Th\u00e1kur Baldeo Bekhsh of Parseni. The principal remaining zamindars are Shekhs, Chhattris, and Kurmis; the presence of the two former has already been accounted for. The Chhattris are mostly of the Janw\u00e1r tribe. The Karmis have always mustered strong in this pargana, and having risen to a state of great prosperity have become possessed of a spirit of very sturdy independence, which they showed both in the Nawabi and on the occasion of the mutiny in our own time.\n\nPargana families.\u2014Chaudhri Nawab Ali, Taluqdar of Salempur. The ancestors of Chaudhri Nawab Ali, Taluqdar of Salempur, on the female\nside, are said to have come from Mad\u00edna, and to have entered the pargana fifteen generations ago about the year 1550, under Shekh Abul Hasan Ans\u00e1ri, who drove out the Amethi Rajputs from Amethi D\u00edngur, and earned for himself the title of Shekh-ul-Isl\u00e1m.\n\nSome one or more generations after Shekh Abul Hasan came Abul-Hasan S\u00e1ni, who had two sons, Shekh Salem and Ali Gauhar. Shekh Salem founded Salempur; and ten generations later his descendant, Moizz-ud-d\u00edn, had a daughter who married Hid\u00e1yat Ali, a Sayyad of K\u00e1kori. His two sons, Sa\u00e1dat Ali and Mans\u00far Ali, lived in Salempur, and inherited their father's estate.\n\nSa\u00e1dat Ali had three sons\u2014Niz\u00e1m Ali, who by marriage became taluqdar of Paintepur, His\u00e1m Ali, father of the present taluqdar, Chaudhri Nawab Ali, and Sams\u00e1m Ali. Sams\u00e1m Ali managed the whole estate, having in addition acquired the share of Mans\u00far Ali, the second son of Hidayat Ali, and dying without heir bequeathed it to his nephew, Nawab Ali.\n\nThis family pretend to have a right to the whole pargana by title of conquest, and they are said to hold two farm\u00e1ns\u2014one dated 1026 Hijri (1617 A.D.) from Jah\u00e1ngir, in the name of Mohi-ud-d\u00edn, fifth in descent from Abul-Hasan S\u00e1ni, and another from Farrukh Siar in the 2nd year of his reign (1128 Hijri, 1715 A.D.), in the name of Muhammad \u00c1saf, confirming them in the office of chaudhri and zamindar of the pargana. However vague and uncertain this title may have been, they seem to be traditionally looked upon as the owners of the soil. Thus the Jan-w\u00e1rs of Mau, at the extreme south-west of the pargana, relate that they received their villages from the Shekhs of Amethi; and the owners of Bak\u00e1s at the extreme west, and the Bais of Karora in the centre assert the Shekhs to have been the original zamindars, and we find also Shekh Abul Hus\u00e1n's descendants founding villages at scattered intervals throughout the whole pargana. Shekh Salem himself founds Salempur on the lands of Kheoli in the north-east of the pargana, and Salempur Uch\u00e1ka on the other boundary directly south.\n\nChaudhri Nawab Ali holds all the villages founded by his ancestors and others, of which he acquired possession from the original inhabitants. Many of the double names involved show a prior Hindu origin and tradition still remembers the names of the original villages on the lands of which the Shekhs founded their own villages. The Trans-Gumti villages mentioned belonged to the pargana of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad which was also held by the Amethias, and which they lost at the same time with Amethi. The Chaudhri taluqdar holds half the village of Ibr\u00e1h\u00edmabad in his sanad with others of the pargana. This estate amounts to 36 villages, of which 29 are in this district, and are assessed at Rs. 44,293.\n\nMusamm\u00e1t Qutb-un-nisa, taluqdar of Gauria, is the widow of Jah\u00e1ngir Bakhsh Sidd\u00edqi Shekh, old pargana q\u00e1numgo of Amethi. This family is said to have come from Mad\u00edna, and to have settled in Delhi in the time of B\u00e1bar Shah. From thence they were probably called by the family of the Ans\u00e1ri Shekhs,\u2014from whom the taluqdar, Chaudhri Nawab Ali, has\nsprung,\u2014who preceded them in the occupation of the pargana, and had also come from Mad\u00edna. They date their settlement from the time of their ancestor Shah Rafi-ud-d\u00edn, under whom they migrated from Delhi, and settled in Mohanlalganj to the north of the pargana near Amethi.\n\nShah Rafi-ud-d\u00edn had a son, Niz\u00e1m, who founded Niz\u00e1mpur, and married a daughter of the house of Malik Y\u00fasuf, one of the officers of Sayyad Masa\u00fad\u2019s army of A.D., 1030, who had escaped the annihilation that befell the rest of the invading force, and had maintained his residence in the town of Amethi, which had fallen into the Musalmans\u2019 hands.\n\nShekh Niz\u00e1m had three sons:\n\n(1.) Shekh T\u00e1hir, who founded T\u00e1hirpur, attained to wealth and the q\u00e1nungship of the pargana, and added Gauria and other villages to his ancestral property. The present representative, Musamm\u00e1t Qutub-unnisa, is descended from this branch of the family, and holds Gauria and four other villages.\n\n(2.) Shekh Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, whose descendants\u2014M\u00e1sh\u00faq Ali and others\u2014hold Mahmudabad, in which their ancestor, Shah Rah\u00edm-ud-d\u00edn, first settled, and four other villages.\n\n(3.) From the third son, Shekh Husen, was descended Mus\u00e1hib Ali, who played too conspicuous and persistent a part in the rebellion of A.D., 1857, and lost his ancestral estate, the taluqa of Dhaurahra, of six villages lying on the banks of the Gumti, which was confiscated and conferred on Abdul Ali, who made a gift of it to the taluqdar Ab\u00fa Tur\u00e1b Khan, an account of whom will be presently given. Only one of the descendants of Shekh Husen, Tufail Ali, holds Fatehpur, which his ancestors founded.\n\nMusamm\u00e1t Qutub-un-nisa holds five villages assessed at Rs. 4,595.\n\nMirza Ab\u00fa Tur\u00e1b Khan, Mughal, Taluqdar of Dhaurahra.\u2014This taluqdar has no history that belongs to this pargana. He was a son-in-law of Munnawwar-ud-daula, and the estate of six villages that he holds belonged to Mus\u00e1hib Ali, of the pargana q\u00e1n\u00fango\u2019s family. This latter was a persistent rebel, and with a strong band of Kurmis and local bad characters kept the rebellion alive on his own account, but he and the Kurmi leader Khush\u00e1l Chand were slain in a fight at Salempur, and his villages confiscated. They were conferred nominally on Abdul Ali, a chela (slave) of Munnawwar-ud-daula, but this was an arrangement made to suit the Nawab. Abdul Ali soon went on a pilgrimage to the Karbala, and the estate was transferred under a deed of hiba (gift) by Abdul Ali to Mirza Ab\u00fa Tur\u00e1b Khan, the present taluqdar. His villages in this pargana are assessed at Rs. 4,091.\n\nChaudhri \u00c1zam Ali of Nagr\u00e1m.\u2014Chaudhri \u00c1zam Ali is said to have come from Khojid in Arabia, twelve generations ago, under Shekh Hab\u00edbulla, and to have driven out the Amethias, who then held the pargana of Nagr\u00e1m, under Jaip\u00e1l Singh. This Musalman family was probably con-\nnected with the invading force which, under Shekh Ab\u00fal Hasan, in the middle of the 16th century, took the Amethi pargana. But it was probably a later arrival; for in the third and fourth generation after Habibulla, we find Aurangzeb granting a farm\u00edn dated 1096 Hijri (1675 A.D.) to Shekhs D\u00e1\u00fad and Salem confirming them in the zamindari of Nagr\u00e1m which their ancestors had held. They early acquired three or four villages, which they still hold in addition to a taraf (portion) of Nagr\u00e1m. But the Amethias did not entirely acquiesce in their deposition, and there is good written evidence that about the year 1130 Hijri or A.D. 1791, they attacked and possessed themselves of the qasba. And it was not till about this time that the Musalmans were made chaudhr\u00eds of the pargana. These Amethias, who belong to Kumhr\u00e1w\u00e1n, never forgot their old rights, and when the rebellion of 1857-58 broke out, the Kurmis of Nagr\u00e1m invited them to put themselves at their head.\n\nThe Churha Janw\u00e1rs of Mau (Gautam Kaun\u00e1ik).\u2014According to their family history, the Janw\u00e1rs of Mau came twelve generations ago from Ikauna in Bahraich under two leaders, Deo R\u00e1\u00e9 and Sohan R\u00e1\u00e9; they must have come at about the commencement of the 17th century; they settled in Mau and Khujauli, which they received from the Amethi Shekhs. Sohan R\u00e1\u00e9 died without issue, but the descendants of Deo R\u00e1\u00e9 grew and multiplied and colonized in all 22 villages, which, with the exception of two\u2014Mau being one\u2014they hold to this day.\n\nDeo R\u00e1\u00e9 had two sons\u2014one of whom, Sen\u00ed S\u00e1h, was the founder of Parseni (Semipur), and the ancestor of Th\u00e1kur Baldeo Bakhsh, taluqdar, whose estate takes its name from this village. His second son was B\u00e1nke R\u00e1\u00e9, and four generations after him were born H\u00edra and J\u00e1chi. The descendants of the former hold sixteen, and the latter three villages. But it is probable that at this time they did not hold more than their ancestral villages of Mau and Khujauli: for three villages, held by J\u00e1chi\u2019s descendants, were founded one and two and three generations after his death, and he does not, indeed, seem to have held a share in any village but Mau. A great deal of the country they colonized must have been jungle-land, for they seem to have newly settled nearly all their villages. H\u00edra\u2019s descendants founded P\u00faranpur, Baldi Khera, Indarj\u00edt Khera, Dharm\u00e1wat Khera, and Dharmangat Khera, and J\u00e1chi\u2019s descendants Hul\u00e1s Khera, Atrauli and Rahb\u00e1n Khera, which villages embrace a considerable tract of country lying on all sides of Mau but the west.\n\nBut it seems not unlikely from its name that Atrauli must have been originally a Bhar village. In Hul\u00e1s Khera itself there are unmistakable Bhar remains in the large fort that lies in the middle of the Karela jh\u00edl. Nothing of the fort now remains but its old site, but it was of considerable strength to judge by the size of the old d\u00edh, and must have been formed from the excavations of the large jh\u00edl which surrounds it on all sides in the form of a moat. On the d\u00edh is a small temple to K\u00e1leshuri Debi, attributed to the Bhars. The remaining fourteen villages held by these Janw\u00e1rs are said to have been old townships, but there seems to be no trace of their original owners, except that D\u00e1\u00fadnagar is clearly Musalman.\nTheir history would show these Janwars to have been an aggressive and enterprising family, and on one occasion they carried their natural proclivities so far as to attack and plunder some of the king's treasure that was being conveyed to Delhi, and to have earned by this their cognomen of the chowahas or 'plunderers.' One of the family, Niw\u00e1z S\u00e1h, grandson of Hira, rose in the latter days of the Delhi empire to command of a considerable body of troops, but their history is otherwise entirely local.\n\nTh\u00e1kur Baldeo Bakesh, Taluqdar of Parseni.\u2014This taluqdar is a Janw\u00e1r of the Mau family, and descended from Seni S\u00e1h, one of the two sons of Deo R\u00e1c, the leader under whom the Janwars migrated from Ikauna, twelve generations ago. Seni S\u00e1h seems to have separated from Mau, and to have founded Parseni or Senipur for himself. An offshoot of this branch are the Janwars of Jabrauli in Nigoh\u00e1n Sissaindi.\n\nThe family did not rise to any importance till the time of R\u00e1m Singh, five generations later. R\u00e1m Singh took to money-lending, and made himself useful to the Chakladars. But the family again declined till the time of Jhabba Singh, his grandson, who became agent and manager for Chandan L\u00e1l, the Khattri banker of Maur\u00e1nw\u00e1n, in the Unao district. During the mutinies he rendered valuable assistance to the British force stationed at \u00c1lamb\u00e1g in forwarding supplies and information. He was rewarded with one of Hindp\u00e1l Singh's confiscated estates of Akohri, Sidhauli in Unao, and a remission of ten per cent. on his land tax as one of the six loyal taluqdara.\n\nMOHANLALGANJ\u2014Pargana MOHANLALGANJ\u2014Tahsil MOHANLALGANJ\u2014District Lucknow.\u2014Mohanalganj is situated at the 14th milestone from Lucknow on the road from Lucknow to Rae Bareli. Mau, or as it is generally called \"Chorhan-k\u00e1-Mau,\" is the old village on the land of which Mohanalganj has been built, and is noteworthy on that account rather than for any history of its own. Mau was founded and inhabited by a tribe of Choraha Janwars, who colonized this and some of the neighbouring villages, and in the Nawabi held an undisturbed and undisputed possession. But this did not always include engagement for the Government revenue, and the village was eventually conferred on the taluqdar, R\u00e1ja K\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d, who in 1859 A.D. built a ganj, which he called after his bygone ancestor Mohanl\u00e1l, and erected a temple of Mah\u00e1deo. The ganj is now a thriving centre of traffic. In addition to the Lucknow and Rae Bareli road which passes through it, it is crossed by the road from Gosainganj, which joins the imperial road to Cawnpore and Bani Bridge. The yearly bazar sales amounted to Rs. 45,200, consisting chiefly of grain and country cotton stuffs. The population consists of 3,674, and is almost entirely Hindu. A great proportion is agricultural. One of the three tahsil stations in the Lucknow district is situated here, and, since the founding of the R\u00e1ja K\u00e1shi Parsh\u00e1d's bazar, it has given its name to the tahsil. Outside the ganj is the police station at which a police force is kept of one inspector, three subordinate officials, and eighteen constables, to guard an area amounting to 175 square miles, and a population of 568 to the square mile. Inside the ganj is a\nfine sar\u00e1e, and outside is an encamping ground for the troops. Two Government schools are established, one at the ganj and one in the village; and attendance of pupils is 90. The ganj bears a clear and prosperous appearance, and is approached on either side by two fine archways. Close to the entrance the raja has built an imposing shiw\u00e1la to Mah\u00e1deo, and has had influence enough to establish the Jalbeh\u00e1r festival, which is held in the month of Bh\u00e1don. There are other small Hindu temples to Debi and Mah\u00e1deo in the village, and to a deified hero called K\u00e1re B\u00eer (the black hero), worshipped by the Janw\u00e1rs.\n\nMOHI\u2014Pargana MAUR\u00c1NW\u00c1N\u2014Tahsil PURWA\u2014District UNAO\u2014Lies fifteen miles south-east of its tahsil Purwa, and thirty-five from the sadr station (Unao) in the same direction. There is no large town or river near this village, nor is there any road. About 500 years ago one M\u00e1n Singh, Chhatri, came from the west and peopled this village. K\u00e1\u00f1h Singh, a descendant of M\u00e1n Singh's, was a noted man here. Hindus and Muhammadans live together peaceably. There is a school, with 21 pupils, lately established. The soil is loam.

It has natural boundaries on the west and south. The Gumti on the west separates it from Magdapur and Atwa Piparia, and a tributary of the same river on the south divides it from Pasagawan. Along the bank of the Gumti the land is high and sandy for about half a mile; it then rather suddenly sinks into a loamy flat of high fertility and fair cultivation. The wells in this part generally bear the use of the bucket without tumbling in; water is from 12 to 20 feet from the surface. Fine crops of sugarcane and cereals are produced.

The town which bears that name was not founded it is true in 1693 A.D.; only the country was inhabited, and fiscally organized by the Sayyads of Barwar long before that date. Their history is given in the Kheri district article. They held Muhamdi and seventeen other parganas in a position of some independence during the break up of the Mughal empire. They paid no regular Government revenue; numerous large and well-built forts enabled them to collect their own and the zamindari bodies of Muhamdi, and the other parganas were principally settled by them as their retainers. Some four or five generations back their representative was displaced by a Sombansi Rajput of Hardoi, who had been captured and converted to the faith, and married to a slave girl of the Sayyad chief: he ousted his master's son from the engagement, estate, and title about 1748 A.D. This family retained possession of eighteen parganas until 1798 A.D., when the then representative was seized as a rebel and defaulter and the taluqa broken up.\n\nThe capital of the taluqa was originally Barwar then Aurangabad, and lastly Muhamdi. The family held parganas Muhamdi, Magdapur, and Atwa Piparia from about 1673 A.D., and Haidarabad and northern Paila from 1693 A.D. The old zamindars, if any, existed in Muhamdi and Magdapur disappeared, but the Bachhil in Atwa Piparia and the Ahbans in Haidarabad and northern Paila emerged about 1798 A.D. from under the pressure to which they had been subjected, aided in overturning the taluqdar, and founded a number of new taluqas, most of which exist to this day.\n\nColonel Sleeman writes as follows of the governor of Muhamdi on January 31, 1850:\n\n\"The Amil of the Mahomdee district, Krishun Sahae, had come out so far as Para to meet me, and have my camp supplied. He had earned good reputation as a native collector of long standing in the Shajehanpore...\"\ndistrict under Mr. Buller; but being ambitious to rise more rapidly than he could hope to do under our settled government, he came to Lucknow with a letter of introduction from Mr. Buller to the Resident, Colonel Richmond; paid his court to the Durbar, got appointed Amil of the Mahomdee district under the amanee system, paid his nazuranas on his investiture in October last, and entered upon his charge. A few days ago it pleased the minister to appoint to his place Aboo Toorab Khan, the nephew and son-in-law of Moonowur-ood-dowla; and orders were sent out immediately, by a camel-messenger, to the commandants of the corps on duty with Krishun Sahae to seize and send him, his family, and all his relations and dependents, with all his property to be found upon them, to Lucknow. The wakeel, whom he kept at court for such occasions, heard of the order for the supersession and arrest, and forthwith sent off a note to his master by the fastest foot-messenger he could get. The camel-messenger found that the Amil had left Mahomdee, and gone out two stages to Para to meet the resident. He waited to deliver his message to the commandants and subordinate civil officers of the district, and see that they secured all the relatives, dependents, and property of the Amil that could be found. The foot-messenger, more wise, went on and delivered his letter to Krishun Sahae at Para on the evening of the Tuesday, the 29th. He ordered his elephant very quietly, and mounting told the driver to take him to a village on the road to Shajehanpore.\n\n\"On reaching the village about midnight, the driver asked him whither he was going. 'I am flying from my enemies,' said Krishun Sahae, 'and we must make all haste, or we shall be overtaken before we reach the boundary.' 'But,' said the driver, 'my house and family are at Lucknow, and the one will be pulled to the ground, and the other put into gaol if I fly with you,' Krishun Sahae drew out a pistol and threatened to shoot him if he did not drive on as told. They were near a field of sugarcane, and the driver hedged away towards it, without the Amil's perceiving his intention. When they got near the field the elephant dashed in among the cane to have a feast, and the driver in his seeming effort to bring him out, fell off and disappeared under the high cane. The Amil did all he could to get out his elephant, but the animal felt that he was no longer in danger of severe treatment from above, and had a very comfortable meal before him in the fine ripe cane, and would not move. The poor Amil was obliged to descend, and make all possible haste on foot across the border, attended by one servant, who had accompanied him in his flight. The driver ran to the village and got the people to join him in the pursuit of his master, saying that he was making off with a good deal of the king's money. With an elephant load of the king's money in prospect, they made all the haste they could; but the poor Amil got safely over the border into British territory. They found the elephant dining very comfortably on the sugarcane. After abusing the drivers and all his female relations for deluding them with the hope of a rich booty, they permitted him to take the empty elephant to the new Amil at Mahomdee. News of all this reached my camp last night.\"\u2014Pages 57-59, Vol. II., Tour through Oudh.\nThe following is an administrative sketch from Colonel Sleeman's Tour through Oudh:\n\n\"The late Hakeem Mehndee took the contract of the Mahomdee district, as already stated, in the year A.D. 1804, when it was in its present bad state, at 3,11,000 rupees a year; and he held it till the year 1819, or for sixteen years. He had been employed in the Azimgurh district under Boo Allee Hakeem, the contractor; and during the negotiations for the transfer of that district with the other territories to the British Government, which took place in 1801, he lost his place and returned to Lucknow, where he paid his court to the then Dewan or Chancellor of the Exchequer, who offered him the contract of the Mahomdee district at three lacs and eleven thousand rupees a year, on condition of his depositing in the treasury a security bond for thirty-two thousand rupees. There had been a liaison between him and a beautiful dancing girl named Peeajoo, who had saved a good deal of money. She advanced the money, and Hakeem Mehndee deposited the bond, and got the contract. The greater part of the district was then as now a waste, and did not yield more than enough to cover the Government demand, gratuities to courtiers, and cost of management. The Hakeem remained to support his influence at court, while his brother, Hadee Allee Khan, resided at Mahomdee, and managed the district. The Hakeem and his fair friend were married, and lived happily together till her death, which took place before that of her husband, while she was on a pilgrimage to Mecca. While she lived he married no other woman; but on her death he took to himself another who survived him; but he had no child by either. His vast property was left to Monowurood-dowlah, the only son of his brother, Hadee Allee Khan, and to his widow and dependants. The district improved rapidly under the care of the two brothers, and in a few years yielded them about seven lacs of rupees a year. The Government demand increased with the rent-roll to the extent of four lacs of rupees a year. This left a large income for Hakeem Mehndee and his family, who had made the district a garden, and gained the universal respect and affection of the people.\n\n\"In the year 1807, Hakeem Mehndee added to the contract of Mahomdee that of the adjoining district of Khyrabad at five lacs of rupees a year, making his contract nine lacs. In 1816, he added the contract for the Bahrsetoh district at seven lacs and seventy-five thousand; but he resigned this in 1819, after having held it for two years, with no great credit to himself. In 1819 he lost the contract for Mahomdee and Khyrabad from the jealousy of the prime minister, Aga Meer. In April, 1818, the Governor-General, the Marquis of Hastings, passed through his district of Khyrabad, on his way to the Tarae forest on a sporting excursion after the Marhatta war. Hakeem Mehndee attended him during this excursion, and the Governor-General was so much pleased with his attentions, courteous manners, and sporting propensities, and treated him with so much consideration and kindness, that the minister took the alarm, and determined to get rid of so formidable a rival. He in consequence made the most of the charge preferred against him of the murder of Amur Sing, and demanded an increase of five lacs of rupees a year, or fourteen lacs of rupees a year instead of nine. This Hakeem Mehndee would not consent.\"\nto give; and Shekh Imam Buksh was, in 1819, sent to supersede him as a temporary arrangement.\n\n\"In 1820, Poorun Dhun and Govurdhun Dass, merchants of Lucknow, took the contract of the two districts at twelve lacs of rupees a year, or an increase of three lacs; and from that time, under a system of rack-renting, these districts have been falling off. Mahomdee is now in a worse state than Khyrabad, because it has had the bad luck to get a worse set of contractors. Hakeem Mehndee retired with his family first to Shajehanpore, and then to Futtehgurh on the Ganges, and resided there with his family till June, 1830, when he was invited back by Nusseer-ood-deen Hyder to assume the office of prime minister. He held the office till August, 1832, when he was removed by the intrigues of the Kumboos, Taj-ood-deen Hoseyn and Sobhan Allee Khan, who persuaded the king that he was trying to get him removed from the throne by reporting to the British Government the murder of some females, which had, it is said, actually taken place in the palace. Hakeem Mehndee was invited from his retirement by Mahomed Allee Shah, and again appointed minister in 1837; but he died three months after, on the 24th of December, 1837.\n\n\"During the thirty years which have elapsed since Hakeem Mehndee lost the contract of Mahomdee, there have been no less than seventeen governors, fifteen of whom have been contractors; and the district has gradually declined from what it was when he left it, to what it was when he took it\u2014that is, from a rent-roll of seven lacs of rupees a year, under which all the people were happy and prosperous to one of three, under which all the people are wretched. The manager, Krishun Sahae, who has been treated as already described, would, in a few years, have made it what it was when the Hakeem left it, had he been made to feel secure in his tenure of office, and properly encouraged and supported. He had, in the three months he had charge, invited back from our bordering districts hundreds of the best classes of landholders and cultivators, who had been driven off by the rapacity of his predecessors, re-established them in their villages, and set them to work in good spirit, to restore the lands which had lain waste from the time they deserted them; and induced hundreds to convert to sugarcane cultivation the lands which they had destined for humbler crops, in the assurance of the security which they were to enjoy under his rule. The one class tells me they must suspend all labours upon the waste lands till they can learn the character of his successor; and the other, that they must content themselves with the humbler crops till they can see whether the richer and more costly will be safe from his grasp, or that of the agents, whom he may employ to manage the district for him. No man is safe for a moment under such a government, either in his person, his character, his office, or his possession; and with such a feeling of insecurity among all classes, it is impossible for a country to prosper.*\n\n\"I may here mention one among the numerous causes of the decline of the district. The contract for it was held for a year and half, in A.D. 1847-48, by Ahmed Allee. Feeling insecure in his tenure of office, he wanted to make as much as possible out of things as they were, and resumed\n\n* Krishun Sahae has been restored, but does not feel secure in his tenure of office.\nGahooa, a small rent-free village, yielding four hundred rupees a year, held by Bahadur Sing, the talookdar of Peepareea, who resides at Pursur. He had recourse to the usual mode of indiscriminate murder and plunder to reduce Ahmed Allee to terms. At the same time, he resumed the small village of Kombee, yielding three hundred rupees a year, held rent-free by Bhoder Singh, talookdar of Magdapoor, who resided in Kombee; and, in consequence, he united his band of marauders to that of Bahadur Singh, and together they plundered and burnt to the ground some dozen villages, and laid waste the pargana of Peepareea, which had yielded to Government twenty-five thousand rupees a year, and contained the sites of one hundred and eight villages, of which, however, only twenty-five were occupied.\"\u2014Pages 74-79, Vol. II., Sleeman's Tour in Oudh.\n\nMUHAMDI\u2014Pargana MUHAMDI\u2014Tahsil MUHAMDI\u2014District KHERI\u2014Lies on the road from Lakhimpur to Shahjahanpur, three miles west of the Gumti, in latitude 27\u00b058' north, longitude 80\u00b019' east. It is on a level plain of fine soil, and has on every side groves and single trees of the best kind. There is an old brick-built fort, having two oblong courtyards. It is now in a decayed state. Within the town there is an imamb\u0101ra, which after being repaired is occupied by the tahsil office. The main part of the fort was built in the beginning of the reign of Aurangzeb by the great-grandson of Nawab Sadr Jah\u0101n; and the outer works and the imamb\u0101ra were built in the time of Sa\u02bfdat Khan, Governor of Oudh, by the ancestor of R\u0101ja Musharraf Ali Khan. Hakim Mehnadi Ali Khan, during his chakladarship of the Muhamdi district, which lasted from A.D. 1799 to 1820, lived here. He made a garden to the west of the town, and he built a sar\u0101e, a mosque, and a ganj within the town. He called the garden Mehndi B\u0101gh and the ganj Saadatganj, after the name of Sa\u02bfdat Ali Khan, the then Governor of Oudh. The sar\u0101e could accommodate at one time about 200 travellers of ordinary description; and the ganj has 60 shops. Sa\u02bfdat Ali Khan was fond of this place, and used to reside here for many months every year. In A.D. 1815, he made a garden about a mile to the east of the town on a fine open place of good soil, and planted an avenue all the way. The trees are now in perfection, but the garden has been neglected, and the bungalow in the centre in which he resided is entirely in ruins. He kept here a large establishment of men and cattle. Within this garden Government has built a bungalow for European travellers. There is a tank to the west of the town round which flights of brick-built stairs were made in A.D. 1863 by subscription.\n\nThe town of Muhamdi was established by Sayyad Muqtadi, and improved and enlarged by Ali Akbar Khan, ancestor of R\u0101ja Musharraf Ali Khan. It has been Government property since A.D. 1784, and declared as such under a judicial decree dated 2nd September, 1868. For a detailed historical account see district article Kheri, historical chapter.\n\nMuhamdi is not remarkable for any fair at which trade is carried on. It has a daily market, and a special market twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays in which articles of country consumption are sold. The annual sales of European and native cotton fabrics in Muhamdi are\nestimated at about Rs. 12,000, and of silk at Rs. 4,000. There are 14 sugar manufactories and one Government manufactory of country liquor.\n\nMuhamdi was the sadr station of the district, now known by the name of Kheri, in 1855-56, and the said district was then and until lately called the Muhamdi district. There is now a tahsil station, a thana, an anglo-veracular school, and a charitable dispensary here. There are no brick-built houses owing to a superstition of the inhabitants; the town therefore is meanly built, although the vicinity is healthy and picturesque.\n\nPopulation 4,729:\n\n| Hindu | Males | Females |\n|-------|-------|---------|\n|       | 1,919 | 1,896   |\n\n| Mussalman | Males | Females |\n|-----------|-------|---------|\n|           | 1,103 | 1,112   |\n\nMUHAMMADPUR Pargana\u2014Tahsil Fatehpur\u2014District Bara Banki.\n\n\u2014This pargana is bounded on the east by the Chauka, on the west by pargana Fatehpur, and some villages of district Sitapur; on the south by Ramnagar, and the north by the Sitapur district.

The date of its foundation is not known. It is said to have been peopled by Mur\u00e1d Sher Khan, about 300 years ago, in the reign of Alamgir, and takes its name from the founder. It is on tolerably level ground, the scenery is pleasant, and climate healthy. Water good. K\u00e1mta Parshad, Brahman, minister of Jaipur, was a noted resident here; there are no particular events to note. There is neither sar\u00e1c, th\u00e1na, or tahsil, here. A vernacular school has been established by Government, and is attended by about 90 boys. A market is held twice a week attended by 200 people; there is also a daily market. There are three fairs during the year\u2014one in March in honour of Debi, one in September-October, and the 3rd in June, in honour of the eighth incarnation of the deity.
