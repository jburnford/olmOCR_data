Lord Stanley of Alderley... 165\nIt was Mohammed who first made his countrymen familiar with the name of Ishmael, but his notions regarding him were very different during his residence at Mekka from what they became after his flight to Madina. In S\u00fbra 6, 83-8 (compare 38, 48; 21, 85; 19, 55,) he says: \"And this is our argument [to prove the divine unity] wherewith we furnished Abraham, that he might make use of it against his people. . . . And we gave unto him Isaac and Jacob, whom we directed both; and Noah had we before directed, and of his posterity, David and Solomon; and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron; . . . and Zacharias, and John, and Jesus, and Elias; . . . and Ishmael, and Elisha, and Jonas, and Lot.\" In this verse, and in many others, Jacob is represented as a son of Abraham and brother of Isaac, whereas Ishmael stands in no such relation to the patriarch. In Madina the prophet learned from Jews converted to Isl\u00e2m that Ishmael was a son, and Jacob a grandson, of Abraham, and he now corrected his error, and wherever he speaks of the descendants of Abraham he first mentions Ishmael; thus in 14, 41, Abraham is introduced saying: \"Praise be unto God, who has given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac, for my Lord is the hearer of supplication.\" The last words seem even to indicate that he had now become acquainted with the import of the name. Mohammed had, in imitation of some more ancient Jud\u00e6o-Christian sects, been proclaiming Abraham as the founder of pure monotheism, and he therefore now greedily took up the Jewish notions on the descent of the Arabians through Ishmael from Abraham (compare S\u00fbra 22 27), and it thereby became an article of faith for his followers.\n\nThe genealogists, who took it as an incontrovertible truth, were at first divided in their opinion; some considering all Arabs as Ishmaelites, and Qaht\u00e2n as a descendant of Kedar\u2014the Arab par excellence\u2014and Ma'add, a son of Nebaiot; others maintained that only the Ma'addites were of Ishmaelitic origin, and at length their opinion prevailed. They considered Kedar as the ancestor of Ma'add; but as a sort of compromise with their opponents, they gave him a\nson of the name of Nabit (Nebirot), through whom Ma'add was descended from him. My friend Syed Ahmed gives in his Essays his own (and thereby Mohammed's) pedigree up to Adam; but not in a complete form. I am able to trace its origin. In the first century of the Hijra, the Ma'additic tribes were classed in reference to their supposed relation to the Qoraysh, the clan to which the prophet belonged; and, as is usual among the Shemites, the classification assumed the form of a pedigree.\n\nAs few of my readers are acquainted with the numerical strength, importance, and geographical position of the Ma'additic tribes to which, in classing them, the genealogists (ethnographers) paid due attention, I may be permitted to illustrate their method by applying it to an imaginary classification of the people of England. I must observe that, with the view of connecting the tribes, the genealogists make use of any name handed down by popular tradition; and when the supply is not sufficient, they insert names like Zayd, 'Abd Allah, answering to our John, William. Let me consider the parishioners of Mary-le-bone as a tribe, which, as is frequently the case with Arabic clans, bears the name of their mother, Mary, a daughter of John, a son of Middlesex. Her husband, William, was a son of Cockney, who also begot Westminster, Pancras, and other sons. Cockney's father, John, was the son of Saxon, who also begot Essex, Sussex, Middlesex, Surrey. Saxon's father, Hengist, also begot Wilt, Kent, and other sons; and his father, English, also begot York, Lancaster. In this manner the genealogy might be continued to Teuto, Arya, Japhet, and Adam; and if Mr. John Smith, of Mary-le-bone, was ambitious enough to make out his lineage up to the father of mankind, he would merely have to enumerate his noble ancestors, calling the most remote he knows the son of Mary. The Arabs obtained, by following this method from Mohammed to Ma'add, a series of twenty successive fathers. Ma'add they called the son of 'Adn\u00e2n, and there they stopped, contenting themselves for some time with the assertion that the ancestor of 'Adn\u00e2n was Nabit, son of Kedar, son of\nIshmael. Towards the end of the first century some genealogists made a timid attempt to connect the pedigree by asserting that 'Adn\u00e2n was the son of Yasmy, the son of 'Ir\u00e2q, the son of Tharyz, the son of Nabit, the son of Kedar, the son of Ishmael; but 'Orwa and his friends were so much shocked at this invention that they alleged two traditions of the prophet, in which the genealogists are branded as storytellers. Ibn Kelby, who died 206 A.H., made the following calculations: between Abraham and Moses there were ten generations, each of 100 years; from Moses to the birth of Christ there elapsed 1900, and from Christ to the birth of Mohammed 569 years; calculating the generation at about forty years, he came to the conclusion that between Moses and Mohammed 61 generations must have passed; and as the genealogists enumerated only 21 fathers between Mohammed and 'Adn\u00e2n, there was a gap of forty fathers to the time of Moses in the genealogy. He made no attempt at filling it up, but a happy circumstance enabled one of his pupils to complete the pedigree of Ma'add, the son of 'Adn\u00e2n. A Jewish convert of Palmyra discovered the private papers of the prophet Baruch, and they contained the genealogy of the ancestors of Mohammed from Ishmael to 'Adn\u00e2n. The missing link was now found, and every Ma'addite was enabled to enumerate his and the prophet's lineage up to the father of mankind.\n\nThe genealogy of the Arabian tribes, considered as a series of ethnographical symbols, is very valuable, and the more we enter into it the more we must admire the tact with which the relation of one tribe to another is expressed. The forgery ascribed to Baruch, on the contrary, if not carefully kept asunder from the symbolical portion of the genealogy, can have no other effect than to mar the whole. The ethnographers who framed the symbols made no attempt to bring it in unison with chronology; the forgery which is intended to make up for this defect contains a list of generations, which for nearly two thousand years successively alone represented the Ishmaelic race. With Ma'add at length, who, if we expect to find in the symbols any attention to chronology, would have lived shortly before the commencement of our\nCONTENTS OF VOL.

Lord Stanley of Alderley... 165\nwilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.\u201d (Gen. xxi. 20, 21.) Paran is the desert which surrounds Ayla (Aqaba). The two races were partners in the possession of the road leading to Egypt, and in the commerce carried on upon it, which in those days must have been very considerable: \u201cAnd, behold, a company (caravan) of Ishmaelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery (tragacanth) and balm and myrrh (ladanum), going to carry it down to Egypt. Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.\u201d (Gen. xxxvii. 25, 28.) At an early age they also seem both to have had a purer religion than other Gentile nations, and to have for this reason been the friends of the Israelites. The mode of life and occupation of both races were similar but not exactly identical, and the Midianites were decidedly the wealthier, more independent, and more powerful of the two, as we shall see lower down.\n\nThe limits of the country of the Ishmaelites (including, as I presume, the Midianites), are stated in Gen. xxv. 18 as follows: \u201cAnd they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria.\u201d Havilah is, as I intend to show in another essay, identical with Khul\u00e1n, the most northern province of Yemen (southern Arabia); and consequently Yemen and Havilah are divided by the same line from northern Arabia: this line begins in the isle of Kodommol (Kotumble, lat. 17\u00b0 52' of the Adm. Chart), and runs due east. By Shur the frontier between Egypt and the desert is meant in the Bible, and in so far it answers to Ferm\u00e2 of Arabic geographers. This passage does certainly not mean that the Ishmaelites were the sole masters of this extensive country, for we read in 1 Sam. xv. 7, \u201cAnd Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.\u201d From Havilah to Shur seems to have been an expression meaning all over the desert. I ought to mention that Yemen was in those days, and even at a later period (comp. Peripl. Maris Eryth. \u00a7 20),\nas civilized as Egypt or Assyria, and did not belong to the lawless wilderness. In our days the people of Damascus would say in this sense, \"as far as Nejd.\" They use this expression in phrases like \"Fay\u00e7al's protection is respected as far as Nejd,\" i.e. all over the desert.\n\nIn Genesis xxv. 13\u201315 twelve sons (tribes) of Ishmael are enumerated; \"The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam, and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa, Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.\"\n\nOf these names that of Kedar occurs most frequently in Scripture; thus in the Song of Solomon i. 5, \"I am black, but comely, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.\" Kedar means squalid in Hebrew, and Gesenius thinks that the Kedareens were called so owing to their dark complexion. It is much more likely that they owed their name to their black hair tents. Beni Kedar would in this case answer to the Arabic Ahl alwabar, people of the hair [tent], and mean sons of the black [tent]. Ezekiel, xxvii. 21, where he speaks of Tyrus, says: \"Arabia, and all the princes (shaykhs as we would say) of Kedar, they occupied with thee in lambs, and rams, and goats: in these were they thy merchants.\" This passage requires some observations. It is certain that commerce was never so much developed in the east that the Tyrians or any other merchants exported sheep and goats from a distant country, like Arabia, to sell them in another. The prophet can therefore only mean to say that the butchers of Tyrus obtained their supply of sheep and goats from the Arabs (Arabia is an erroneous translation) and from the Kedareens. If we go from the coast of Tyrus into the interior, we reach, after one day's journey, a hilly country, which extends from Jebel Shaykh to the north, and which could never have been used for any other purpose than for pasturing sheep and goats, and it is, with its slopes towards the east, so extensive that it could provide Tyrus and all the neighbourhood with this commodity. Both the Arabs and the Kedareens of whom Ezekiel speaks must therefore have inhabited this hilly region.\nIsaiah, lx. 6, 7, who resided in the kingdom of Jud\u00e6a, speaks of the camels of Midian and Ephah (a subdivision of the Midianites), of the rams of Nebaioth, and of the flocks (of sheep and goats) of Kedar. The Kedareens north of Jebel Shaykh were too distant to admit of their bringing their cattle to the markets of Jud\u00e6a. The Nebaiot and Kedar of Isaiah must have been situated south of Palestine, in the neighbourhood of W\u00e2diy Ghorondol, and west of it, and branches of these tribes may even have visited the barren tracts in southern Palestine, which yielded pasture for goats, just as in our days Beduins roam about between cultivated districts, preserving all the independence to which they are entitled by their pastoral habits. In these two passages the Kedareens (and their brethren the Nebaiot) are represented as breeders of goats and sheep. This is very characteristic, because the tribes in the depth of the open desert devote themselves chiefly to breeding camels and occasionally horses also, and they find it neither profitable nor convenient to keep more sheep and goats than is necessary for domestic purposes. In Arabia this branch of industry is particularly cultivated by hill tribes, who may or may not be in possession of plains of inconsiderable extent. A passage of Jeremiah, xlix. 28, is not really opposed to this view; but as we learn from it that the Kedareens also possessed camels, it induces us to allot to them a considerable share in the open desert west of W\u00e2diy Ghorondol and in D\u00e2r\u00fbm: \"Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus said the Lord; Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east. Their tents and their flocks (of sheep and goats) shall they take away: they shall take to themselves their curtains (tents), and all their vessels, and their camels.\" Isaiah, xxi. 17, speaks of the archers of Kedar: \"And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished.\" In Arabian warfare archery is very useful for defending a strong position, but in the open field the use of archers is, even in case of defence, very limited, because the enemy's cavalry is sure to turn their flank and to compel\nthem by feigned attacks to spend their arrows. In *rasias*, and night attacks, the warfare most usual among the genuine Beduins, archers are of no use whatsoever. The great object of the enemy in a *rasia* is to traverse with speed great distances, and to attack the victims unawares, and therefore the strength of a Beduin army consists in horsemen and camel-riders. Even for defence the bow can rarely be used in such attacks, because, if the surprise should fail, the assailants retire as fast as they had advanced, avoiding an encounter. If a fight ensues, it is a close attack, where only sword and dagger can be used. In our days there are tribes in the desert who even disdain the use of firearms, finding that good cavalry armed with long spears and javelins answers all their purposes. No doubt in all nomadic tribes there were in former days individuals to be found who practised archery, both for the purposes of hunting and of warfare; but a tribe with whom it was a hereditary skill (it is stated that Ishmael was an excellent archer) must have had its seats in a broken country which offered strong military positions, and where the flocks had to be protected against wild beasts, in a country made for shepherds, and not in the open desert. We learn from Isaiah xlii. 11 that not all the Kedareens lived in tents: in extensive pasture grounds (*midbar*) they had towns and *hazerim*, which may mean sheepfolds surrounded by a stone wall\u2014like those which we find in Antilibanon\u2014or entrenchments.\n\nWiner refers to some passages of the Bible which, as he thinks, prove that the Kedareens could not have lived in the immediate vicinity of Jud\u00e6a. It appears to me that they prove the very reverse. One of them is Psalm cxx. 5, \u201cWoe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!\u201d Mesech (the Moschi near the Caucasus) answers here to our Ultima Thule, and the Psalmist means to say that he is a fugitive, and compelled either to flee to the end of the world or to take refuge among the free sons of Kedar. Jeremiah, ii.10, says: \u201cPass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.\u201d He means to say neither among mariners\nnor among nomads you will find the like. Isaiah, xlii. 10, enlarges on this poetical idea, and adds to the mariners and the Kedar \"the inhabitants of the rock\" (troglodytes). As the Kedar were among all nomadic tribes best known to the Jews, because they were nearest to them, their name, it appears, was used in the sense of Scenit\u00e6, inhabitants of tents; and this seems to have induced the authors of the Talmud to consider 'Arab and Kedar as synonyms, for the word 'Arab is used in the Qor\u00e2'n, as well as in common parlance, for nomads, Scenit\u00e6.\n\nPliny S., v. \u00a7 65, found the Cedrei in the same spot in which we have placed the Kedareens of Isaiah. He speaks of the desert east of the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile, and says: \"H\u00e6c Catabanum et Esbonitarum et Scenitarum Arabum vocatur, sterilis, pr\u00e6terquam ubi Syri\u00e6 confinia attingit, nec nisi Casio monte nobilis. His Arabes junguntur, ab oriente Canchlei, a meridie Cedrei qui deinde ambo Nabateis.\" According to this passage they are to be placed west of W\u00e2diy Ghorondol, the limit of the Nabat\u00e6ans (Idum\u00e6ans). Eusebius and Hieronymus, Onomasticum edit. Parthey, Berlin, 1862, p. 259, are the latest authors who mention Kedar, but as the name of a place: \"est regio in eremo Saracenorum, a filio Ismaelis Cedar ita cognominata.\" The Saracenic desert extends from Madian to the north, and round the gulf of 'Aqaba to the west, comprising the desert of Paran.\n\nJetur and Naphish are two Ishmaelic tribes, whose seats have been identified with great certainty. In 1 Chronicles v. 18\u201319 it is stated that \"The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab;\" and it hence appears that these tribes, which it seems subsequently united into one, occupied the country east of the Jordan, called by St. Luke, iii. 1, by Strabo, Eusebius, and other writers, Iture\u00e6a. One of these tribes may have held Trachonitis. The latest accounts of the Itureans is that they sent a contingent to the army of the Emperor Valerian.\n\nIt is usually supposed that Nebaiot, whom, as we have seen, Isaiah mentions with Kedar, is the same tribe as the\nNabateans of later authors. But the spelling of the two names, \u05e0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd and \u05e0\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd, is quite different, and so is the pronunciation for the Shemitic ear. And Strabo says, in reference to the nomenclature of his predecessors, that the Nabateans are the same people whom the Jews call Idum\u00e6ans. If we interpret the two verses of Genesis xxviii. 9 and xxxvi. 3 by the rules followed by Arabic genealogists, we must admit that there existed a closer affinity between some of the children of Edom (Esau) and the Nebaiot, than between them and the other Ishmaelites; and there is also reason to suppose that the Nebaiot had their seats in the neighbourhood of the Idum\u00e6ans, yet they were two different races; and if we, with Josephus, extend Nabitene from the Euphrates to the Red Sea, we do not get nearer to our subject. All we know is that the Nebaiot were shepherds, like the Kedar.\n\nMishma was also the name of a Simeonitic tribe (1 Chron. iv. 25), and we do not know whether two tribes had the same name, or whether the Mishma were a mixed race, and by some regarded as Ishmaelites, and by others as Simeonites. Of Adbeel, Mibsam, Massa, Haddad, and Kedemah, Scripture offers no further information. There remain Dumah and Temah. I propose to make my remarks on them after having spoken of the Midianites.\n\nThe Ishmaelitic tribes whose acquaintance we have hitherto made were shepherds, and lived in the immediate vicinity of Palestine, south and east of it. They were not regular Beduins, and we may consider them as Ishmaelites in the more limited sense of the word. The wealth of the Midianites and of Ephah, on the contrary, consisted in camels; their seats must have been the vastnesses of the desert, and they were regular Beduins. Madian, which like madina, may mean town, the root of both being din, and not Midian, which means strife, is the name of a city in lat. 28\u00b0 30', not far from the east coast of the gulf of \u2018Aqaba. As Moses met the priest of the Midianites at no great distance from the west coast of the same gulf, it may, nevertheless, have its name from the Midianites, and it is very probable that the Midianites were in possession of this part of Arabia. The\ntheatre of their warlike operations is, however, east of Palestine. Nearly 1200 years before Christ they emerged from the Syrian desert, appeared jointly with the Amalekites and other sons of the east, in the plains of Moab, pitched their tents in the valley of Jezreel, and conquered Palestine as far as the Mediterranean. After a subjection of seven years, the Lord awoke Gideon, and he slew their host. Two of their princes retired with fifteen thousand men, \"all that were left of all the host of the children of the east,\" to Karkor; Gideon pursued them, made them prisoners, and slew them. Certain it is that on this occasion most of the tribes of the Syrian desert united against the Israelites, and it is of interest to observe that in this passage (Judges viii. 10) they are collectively called children of the east, just as in Ezekiel xxiv. 4-10, whereas in Judges vi. 3, 33, vii. 12, they are co-ordinate with the Midianites and Amalekites: \"Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together.\" It may be supposed that in the more limited sense, children of the east, B'ne Qedem, is the name of a tribe, descended from Kedemah the son of Ishmael, which occupied the most eastern regions of the desert and extended even over the Euphrates to Harr\u00e2n, whose neighbourhood is called the land of the children of the east in Genesis xxix. 1. All these are controversial questions, and we therefore limit our researches to the position of Karkor, which is spelled in the original \u05e7\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e7\u05b9\u05e8 Hieronymy, sub voce Carcar (Onom. ed. Parthey p. 253), says: \"Et est usque hodie castellum cognomento Carcaria unius diei itinere ab urbe Petra.\" Following the operations of the two armies, it is inconceivable how they could have got to the neighbourhood of Petra. Moreover, the spelling of this name in Arabic is \u0643\u0631\u0643\u0648\u0631 Kerek, to which in Hebrew \u05e7\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e7\u05b9\u05e8 would answer, and Eusebius writes it \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03b9, and we therefore cannot help suspecting Hieronymy of having altered the name with a view of making it better agree with Karkor. In Arabic qarqar means a smooth plain of no great extent, and Qor\u00e2q\u00eer is the name of a water-place two or three days' march (say 50 miles) east of 'Amm\u00e2n, and this no doubt answers to Karkor.\nIn order to give an idea of the importance of this place, I must be permitted to make a few observations on the geography of the country round it. Between D\u00fbmah (J\u00f4f) and Jebel Shammar, a distance of 170 miles, extends the main body of the Dehn\u00e2, a plain covered with fine sand, which in spring produces the most luxuriant herbage, sufficient for all the camels of Arabia to feed upon; but as the Dehn\u00e2 is without water, it can be utilized to a limited extent only. One of its branches strikes to north-west and then it turns towards north, and has now the name of W\u00e2diy Sirh\u00e2n; formerly it was called Sam\u00e2wa and also Qor\u00e2q\u00eer, because the water-place of this name is the principal one to which the camels grazing in these pasture-grounds resort to drink. Sam\u00e2wa is the garden of the Syrian desert, and the only place whose owners are able to keep a large stock of camels: it therefore was always in the hands of the mightiest tribe of these regions, and indeed the tribe which holds Sam\u00e2wa is supreme in the Syrian desert and in the adjacent parts of Arabia. In antiquity it appears this position was held by the Midianites, against whom Gideon fought, subsequently by the Kelbites, and in our days by the \u2018Anezeh.\n\nThese remarks bring us to Dumah and Tema. It is generally admitted that Dumah is identical with the D\u00fbmah (the orthography is the same), also called D\u00fbmat-al-jandal, of Arabic geographers, now known by the name of J\u00f4f. It is an oasis about half way between Petra and the Euphrates. Bunsen takes Tema for the Thaimi of Ptolem\u00e6us, on the Persian Gulf. But the place of the Thaimi is occupied by the Banu Taym, and their name has been transcribed by Ptolemy without alteration. The spelling of Tema is precisely that of Taym\u00e2 (pronounced T\u00eam\u00e2), the name of a town four easy days\u2019 journey south-west of D\u00fbmah. These two oases are an appendage to the Sam\u00e2wa; and a tribe which holds these pasturing grounds will, sooner or later, obtain possession of them. Hence we conclude that the two tribes, Dumah and Tema, were in close relation to the Midianites of Karkor, and were Ishmaelites only in the wider sense of the term.\nBesides the Dehn\u00e2 (now caelld Nufood), south of D\u00fbmah, just mentioned, there is another Nufood in Northern Arabia, east of the town of Madian. Its length from north to south may be estimated at sixty miles, and its breadth at thirty. It offers pasturing grounds for thousands of camels, which find water at the brackish but copious wells and ponds of \u1e24ism\u00e2, situated on the north-western extremity. The tribes of the desert of Jif\u00e2r, as far as Egypt, and even of part of the peninsula of Sinai, must either drive their camels for some months of the year into this Nufood, or they must reduce their stock to a very low standard; and therefore they must either live in poverty or be dependent upon the tribe which may be in possession of it. As this position is so important, and commands, as it were, the country all around, we naturally ask who may have held it in antiquity? To answer this question I must first observe, that the commerce of Arabia was then very considerable, and that its caravans imported the spices of tropical climates into Egypt and Syria. The profits which the leaders of caravans derived from it were great, and the conveyance of goods was a monopoly of the most powerful tribes along the road. (Pliny, 12, 14, \u00a7 63\u20134.) We may therefore take it as a fact that the race to which the caravan that bought Joseph belonged, was then in possession of the Nufood of \u1e24ism\u00e2, and this race was no other than the Ishmaelite-Midianitic.\n\nThere are three mercantile roads leading from Yemen through Mekka, to Syria. The most eastern and shortest passes through Taym\u00e2, and thence through the desert to Damascus, but this desert is occupied by savage tribes, and even in the times of the \u2018Abb\u00e2sides, the strongest caravans would not venture to pass it; but during the reign of the Omayyides, there were, as Moqaddasy informs us, relays of dromedaries posted along it to keep up the communication between Mekka and Damascus. The most western road on which the town Madian was a station touches the western margin of the Nufood of \u1e24ism\u00e2, and the middle road which passes through Teb\u00fbk is not far from the eastern margin. These two roads were commanded by\nIshmaelito-Midianitic tribes. As long as they were supreme in the pasturing grounds of the Nufood, and as they also held Taym\u00e2 and even D\u00fbmah, not an ounce of frankincense or spice could reach Egypt or Syria, by land, without their having a share in the profits.\n\nThere is no doubt that in the highest antiquity genuine Arabic tribes (perhaps from Nejd) were visiting the Syrian desert, and probably also the neighbourhood of Hism\u00e2, and owing to the continuous feuds among nomadic races, the changes of fortune may have been great; but it is certain that there has been a period in which the Ishmaelito-Midianites were paramount in northern Arabia and the desert north and west of it. I will now show that at the time of Mohammed, and even earlier, they had completely disappeared in these regions, and were succeeded by Arabic tribes of the Qaht\u00e2n race, which had gradually left Yemen and pushed on towards Syria.\n\nIn enumerating these tribes and fixing their new seats, I follow more particularly Hamd\u00e2ny. The Nufood, near Madian and Hism\u00e2, was occupied by the Jodz\u00e2m. The southern limit of their territory was \"Nebk on the sea shore.\" It seems that Nebk is the ancient name of Mowayli\u1e25 (Moila, lat. 27\u00b0 40' of the map). This tribe extended along the coast as far as Ayla ('Aqaba); but at 'Ayn\u00fbn\u00e2, lat. 28\u00b0 8', it also spread to the east as far as Teb\u00fbk, and it occupied Adzroh and Mo'\u00e2n, then the capital of Idum\u00e6a. Here resided at the time of Mohammed the Jodz\u00e2mite king Farwa, who ruled over the country under Byzantine protection. Some Jodz\u00e2m tribes had settled in the hills east of the Dead Sea, among the 'Odzra, which were here predominant, and others, as we shall see, near Egypt. Detached tribes of the Jodz\u00e2m lived in the valley of the Jordan, near Tiberias, as far as Lajj\u00fbn and 'Akk\u00e2.\n\nThe Lakhm were close relations and confederates of the Jodz\u00e2m. Their principal seats were in the desert Jif\u00e2r, which extends from the meridian of Ayla to Egypt. On the western extremity of Jif\u00e2r, at Warr\u00e2da, Baqq\u00e2ra and 'Arysh, Jodz\u00e2mite, and Lakhmite families were settled;\nwhereas Ferm\u00e2, \"the frontier between the Arabs and the Copts,\" was occupied by families of the Josham, a subdivision of Jodz\u00e2m. D\u00e2r\u00fbm, east of Jif\u00e2r, was exclusively Lakhmitic territory. Detached Lakhmite tribes were in Jaul\u00e2n, Naw\u00e2 (Burekh., lat. 33\u00b0 10', writes Nowa), Bathnyya, and Haur\u00e2n. In these places (the ancient seats of the Jetur) Johayna, Dzoby\u00e2n, and some sub-divisions of the Qayn, lived among them, and the east coast of the Dead Sea they shared with the 'Odzra and Jodz\u00e2m, but in the track between Teb\u00fbk and Zoghar, on the Dead Sea, which also belonged to them, they seem to have been without partners, excepting, perhaps, the 'Odzra, to whom Teb\u00fbk belonged.\n\nThe Kelb were in exclusive possession of the Sam\u00e2wa, which, Hamd\u00e2ny tells us, extends in a westerly direction nearly as far as Haur\u00e2n (or W\u00e2diy Sirh\u00e2n in Burckhardt's map), and towards Palmyra in the north. Their king, Farwa Dyly, who resided in Sam\u00e2wa, and reigned at the commencement of Isl\u00e2m, was not a Kelbite, but a member of the dynastic family of Ghass\u00e2n, and had been appointed by the Byzantine Emperor. From Sam\u00e2wa the Kelbite tribes radiated as far as the Syrian desert extends, to the cultivated land on the banks of the Euphrates in the east, and to Manbij, Tell-Mannas, and Kafar-T\u00e2b in the north. Palmyra and the Oasis Salamyya are therefore called Kelbite towns by Hamd\u00e2ny; they even spread over the gulfs and inlets of the Syrian desert, they approached close to \u1e24om\u00e7 and to \u1e24am\u00e2h, and occupied the hills called Sanyr, that is to say the portion of Antilibanon north of Ba'lbek stretching towards \u1e24om\u00e7, and the hilly country east of \u1e24am\u00e2h. The latter hills offer an important position for robbers, and there are at present few roads in Syria less safe than the one leading along their foot. The wealth of the occupants of Sanyr must have consisted of sheep and goats, like that of the Kedareens of old; and it may be taken as a rule that tribes of this character are emerging from the nomadic state and advancing towards settled life; cases to the contrary, that they consist of a rural population in a state of decomposition, do occur, but are very rare. Of the Kelbites of Sanyr, it is certain that they\nwere in a state of transition to sedentary habits; of the Kedareens it may be inferred by analogy. We are therefore justified in supposing that their original homes were in the depth of the Syrian Desert\u2014they were really sons of the East. In the north of the Syrian desert there were, between the Kelbites, camps of Kil\u00e2bites, and so there may have been other Arabic tribes mixed with them in other places out of Sam\u00e2wa. The Kelbites, however, were supreme, and the other tribes roamed over these regions only by sufferance as it were. The population of D\u00fbmat-al-Jandal, which we consider as an appendage to the Syrian desert, and where not Arabian but Syrian architecture and Syrian habits are prevailing, consisted of Kelbites, but, probably by their own choice, they were protected by a prince of the Kindite dynasty, which in Byzantine historians is represented as ruling over Nejd. The influence of the emperors of Constantinople did not therefore extend as far as this Oasis.\n\nThe '\u00c2mila took possession at an early period of the hills which stretch from Tiberias towards the Mediterranean, and which were named after them during the Moslim conquests; and there settled in their vicinity, particularly near 'Akka, families of the Hamd\u00e2n, Bal\u1e25\u00e2rith, 'Akk, and Madzh\u00eej tribes.\n\nFrom the mountains of the '\u00c2mila to Damascus, says Hamd\u00e2ny, the Jafna and other Ghassanitic tribes have their seats. The Ghass\u00e2nites appear never to have been very numerous, but they were powerful, and their kings ruled over all the Arabic tribes in and near Syria who had submitted to the Byzantines, with the exception of the Jodz\u00e2m\u00eetes and Lakhmites.\n\nThe Dzoby\u00e2n [Ibn Homaym?] possessed the Biy\u00e2dh, also called Biy\u00e2dh of Qarqara, which is a desert extending from Taym\u00e2 to Haur\u00e2n. Among them there were some camps of the Tayy-tribe. The eastern limits of their territory in the north were the Jan\u00e2b\u00eeyy\u00e2t, so called after the Kelb tribe Jan\u00e2b, and frequently considered as part of Sam\u00e2wa. They were permitted to visit the water of Qor\u00e2q\u00eer (the Karkor of the Bible), and that of 'Or\u00e2'\u00eer; and the former was also\nvisited by the Qayn, whose territory extended from here as far as the hills east of the Dead Sea.\n\nThere are two other tribes in Syria who had submitted to the Byzantines: the Bahr\u00e2, who occupied the plains south and west of \u1e24om\u00e7, and the Tan\u00fbkh, who embraced Christianity, and fixed their abode near L\u00e2diqyya. According to Ibn Ish\u0101q the Baly also sent a contingent to the Byzantine army, which operated against Mohammed. I have not been able to discover a settlement of this tribe in or near Syria. The seats of the Baly are, up to this day, south of Nebk, on the mountains along the coast of the Red Sea. The Kel-bites, as it would appear, were too numerous, and too widely spread over the desert, to allow of their feeling much the supremacy of the Byzantines. The other tribes whom we have enumerated were tamed nomads, their strength and numbers were in the desert, but their leaders resided, at least part of the year, in towns, where also many of their clansmen settled and devoted themselves to commerce and industry; yet the main population of towns and cultivated patches of land consisted of autochthons: Syrians, Jews, Edomites. In times of war the Arabs turned out, or sent at least considerable contingents to the Imperial army, and in times of peace their \"kings\" were the military governors of the provinces in which they were in great strength. Even at Damascus, it seems there was a garrison of Arabs commanded by a member of one of their dynasties. The increased navigation of the Red Sea reduced the importance of the caravan commerce considerably. Yet at the commencement of our era caravans were still passing from the frankincense region to Egypt and Syria. The proprietors of the goods were townsmen,\u2014among them many Arabs\u2014the conveyance thereof continued to be the monopoly of powerful nomadic tribes along the road. The most northern of them were, no doubt, the Jodz\u0101m-Lakhmites.\n\nTo show that the Yemenic origin of the successors of the Ishmaelites is not a fancy of the genealogists, but founded upon facts, I will shortly state here an instance, leaving further details on the migration of the Arabs for another\noccasion. The genealogists report that the name of the Ghass\u00e1nites is derived from the name of a watering place of theirs. We are able to fix the position of this place with great exactness. It is situated in valley Rima (in Nieb.'s map R\u0101ma), near the spot where it opens into the Tih\u00e2ma (plains along the coast), in lat. $14^\\circ 41'$. On the same coast there were at the time of Agatharchides (apud Diod.) the Gasandi, at the time of Pliny the Gasani, and at the time of Ptolemy the Kassanit\u00e6. Examining then the series of Ghassanite kings who ruled in their new habitations south of Damascus, we find that it goes back to the year 400 after Christ, and we may therefore suppose that they settled in the third or fourth century in Syria.\n\nThe children of Ishmael, \"who dwelt in the wilderness,\" had, like their successors, their root and source of life in the desert, more particularly in Sam\u00e2wa and in the Nufood of \u1e24ism\u00e2. In the fifth century of our era we cannot find a corner of the desert which they could call their own; everywhere they had disappeared. What has become of them? We know the Shemitic laws of war: most of them had been smitten with the sword, the rest fled to the hills and into towns and villages where they were gradually absorbed by the inhabitants they found there. They ceased, long previous to the Moslim conquests, to form a race of their own.\n\nIn reference to their ethnological relation to other Shemites, we have no other information than that contained in the Bible, and this, as well as the form of their proper names, leads us to think that their affinity to the Israelites and the Edomites was much greater than to the Arabs.\nART. II.\u2014A Brief Account of Four Arabic Works on the History and Geography of Arabia. By Captain S. B. Miles.\n\nRead April 29th, 1872.\n\nI venture to lay before the Society a brief notice of four Arabic MS. works on the History and Geography of Arabia, which appear to me sufficiently interesting from their rarity and the nature of their contents to merit attention.\n\nThe political history of the Arabs divides itself naturally into two epochs; the Preislamic and the Mohammedan or historical period. The former, at least so far as we are acquainted with it, comprised three empires, of which the earliest, and unquestionably the most important, was the Himyar dynasty of Yemen. The chronicles of this state would, had they been fortunately preserved to us, probably have furnished one of the most instructive and entertaining chapters in the history of mankind; but they are so enveloped in fable, and the sources of trustworthy information are so exceedingly scant and fragmentary, that no researches have yet availed to dissipate entirely the gloom that hangs over that period, and it remains buried in as profound an obscurity as that of any other country of the East. A great advance, however, has been made of late years in increasing the materials of Arabian research, and the ultimate recovery of at least a considerable portion of this lost history is by no means to be despairs of. There is good reason to believe that various historical MSS. of more or less value, but as yet unknown to Europeans, still exist in Arabia, and that from the oral traditions and legends of the people, especially of the Himyar tribes, which have been only very partially investigated, much may yet be gleaned; but the field in which we may expect to find the most ample materials for the reconstruction of the ancient edifice obviously lies in the ruined cities of S.W. Arabia, now known to abound in inscriptions in stone and bronze and other historical monu-\nments of the Himyaritic empire, which, when brought to light and interpreted, cannot fail to yield very important accessions to our knowledge. Several specimens, too, of Himyaritic coins\u2014the key to the country's history, and regarding the very existence of which so much doubt has hitherto been felt\u2014have been recently obtained; and, as our store of them increases, will, by their unerring and concurrent testimony, be of no slight service in elucidating it. It is much to be hoped that before long an exploration of the country may be undertaken, and its hidden treasures drawn forth and made available; but in the mean time every additional ray of light, however small, that can be thrown on its history cannot but be welcome.\n\nFor the modern history of Yemen, on the other hand, our materials are much more abundant and authentic; and it is somewhat surprising that there is yet no work in any of the languages of Europe that gives a full and connected account of the affairs of that region from the time of the prophet Mohammed. The only attempt of the kind that I know of is Playfair's \"History of Yemen,\" which, though useful, is but a bare outline of events.\n\nThe few MSS. I am attempting to describe are well worthy the attention of students of Arabian history and literature, and fully deserve, I think, to be edited and translated. The names of them are:\u2014The *Iklil fi Ansab*, of *Hassan bin Ahmed el Hamdani*; the *Kitab el Jesireh* of the same author; the *Tarikh el Mostabsir* of *Ibn el Mojawir*, and the *Kurrat el Oytun* of *El Dubbi*.\n\nIt is not my intention to analyze these works; but in order to give a fair conception of their contents, I translate most of the rubrics or heads of chapters of each.\n\nThe first of them, the *Iklil*, is described by Hajji Khalfa as a great work, and a wealth of learning, and though it certainly contains a good deal of astrological trash, appears to deserve his encomiums. It is a repertory of all the information that could be collected on the subject of the Himyarites at the time the author wrote, about three centuries subsequent to the fall of that dynasty. It is, I am persuaded, the same\nwork that was met with by Baron Wrede during his journey in Hadramaut, and from which he transcribed the list of kings and tobbas given in the edition of his Travels lately published by the Baron von Maltzan.\n\nThe second is a very admirable description of Arabia and its people, more particularly of the S.W. portion, and is, I should say, of the best class of Arab geographies. It is a book rarely met with even in Arabia, and only one copy has, I believe, as yet reached Europe. The present volume is an 8vo. of 496 pages of 17 lines in a page, and contains also a copy of Nishwan's Kasideh and its commentary.\n\nThese two works of Hamdani are a mine of information on the early history and geography of Arabia, and unquestionably present many new and important materials. His intimate acquaintance with the various tribes and the physical features of the country is especially noteworthy. Hamdani was presumably one of the most learned men of his age, and must have been an indefatigable collector of knowledge, for if he did not himself visit the places he describes in Yemen, he managed at least to gather together a very unusual store of information regarding them, and he must take a high rank among the native historians of that land. Very little seems to be known of his life, the celebrated Es Soyuti being apparently the only one who has collected any information respecting him. The cause of this may have been partly on account of his heterodox opinions, as he is known to have been rather a free-thinker in matters of religion, an offence that would have sufficed to insure his exclusion from Moslem biographies. Hammer-Purgstall, in his Literatur-Geschichte der Araber, quoting from Es Soyuti's Lives of the Grammarians, tells us that Hamdani was born and brought up at Sanaa, wandered thence to Mecca, where he sojourned some time, then returned to Yemen, and settled himself at Sada, where he died A.H. 334; that he embraced all knowledge, and was a living encyclopedia of grammar, poetry, genealogy, history, astronomy, astrology, and geometry, and was also a physician. He was the author of at least ten works, many of which are given by Hajji Khalfa. Their names are as follows: (1.) The\nIklil fi Ansab, or Crown of Genealogies. (2.) The Book of Animals. (3.) The Book of Archery. (4.) The Book of Battle days. (5.) The Book of Roads and Kingdoms. (6.) The Description of Arabia. (7.) The Wonders of Yemen. (8.) The Diwan Hassan, a collection of poetry, in six volumes. (9.) The Kasideh ed Damighat. (10.) The Zij el Hamdani, astronomical tables. (11.) The Sirr el Hikmet.\n\nOf these, the fifth and sixth are, I suspect, but one and the same work under different titles, as the latter is not named by any author. Two only of all his compositions appear to have come down to us, the others have probably not been preserved. Hamdani's full name was Abu Mohammed Hassan bin Ahmed bin Yacoob bin Eusof bin Daood el Hamdani el Yemeni, and he was commonly known by the name of Ibn Haik.\n\nFrom the title-page of the eighth volume of the Iklil I give the following list of contents of the ten books composing that work:\n\n1st Volume.\u2014Abridged account of the beginning and origin of the Genealogies.\n2nd Vol.\u2014Progeny of Hamaisa bin Himyar.\n3rd Vol.\u2014The branches of Kahtan.\n4th Vol.\u2014On ancient history to the time of Tobba Abi Karib.\n5th Vol.\u2014On medi\u00e6val history from the first days of Asaad Tobba to the days of Dhu Nowas.\n6th Vol.\u2014On later history to the Islam.\n7th Vol.\u2014On some absurd accounts and impossible anecdotes of the Prophet.\n8th Vol.\u2014Account of the palaces of the Himyars, their cities and courts, and what has been preserved of their poetry.\n9th Vol.\u2014On the proverbs of the Himyars, and the prophecies in their language and musnad character.\n10th Vol.\u2014Account of Hashid and Bakail.\n\nContents of Volume VIII.\u2014Chapter on what has come down to us concerning the palaces (\u0642\u0635\u0631) of Yemen.\u2014Account of Sanaa and its citadel Ghumdan.\u2014Of Dhofar the\ncelebrated and its citadel.\u2014The palace of Kaukeban.\u2014The onyx mines in Yemen.\u2014Account of Irem.\u2014Of Nait.\u2014Of the royal palace of Yaruk.\u2014Of Mareb and Saba.\u2014Of the palace of Natheed on Ras Asser.\u2014Of Beit Hanbas and its ruins.\u2014Of Debil.\u2014Shehr\u00e2r.\u2014Beinoon in Ans.\u2014D\u00e2m\u00eegh between Sanaa and Dhamar.\u2014The Wadi Zohr.\u2014Of Re\u00e2m and the place of eruption of fire.\u2014Account of the mosques of Yemen.\u2014Account of Gheiman, in which are the tombs of Himyar kings.\u2014Of Musna, Hadha and Bu Hadha.\u2014Of Sirwah, and what the poets have said of it.\u2014Of Hidkan.\u2014Ridaa.\u2014Shib\u00e2m.\u2014Najar.\u2014Moukal.\u2014Hakir.\u2014Adhra.\u2014Sarw.\u2014The palace of Dhilan.\u2014Of Rauthan.\u2014The palaces of Shahi, one of the wonders of Yemen.\u2014Of Khamir, one of the wonders of Hamdan.\u2014Of Tulkum, one of the most ancient palaces of Yemen.\u2014Of Shaoob and its palaces.\u2014Ekla and its vast ruins.\u2014Maeen.\u2014Barakish and Baidha.\u2014Souda and many other places.\u2014The book of Dams or Bunds of the Himyars.\u2014The dam of Mareb.\u2014The dam of Khanik at Sada.\u2014The dam of Ri\u00e2n and Nise\u00e2n, and many others in Yemen and Hamdan.\u2014Chapter on the treasures of Yemen and where they are hidden.\u2014Chapter on the musnad character or writing of the Himyarites.\u2014Chapter on the sepulchres of the Himyars and the inscriptions found in them.\u2014Sepulchre of Hood in Hadramaut.\u2014Of Abdulla bin Thamir, and others.\u2014Account of the elegies of the Himyarites.\u2014On Kahtan.\u2014Saba bin Yeshgob.\u2014Himyar, Suksuk bin Wail.\u2014Mogh\u00e2fir.\u2014Shedad, and others.\n\nContents of Volume X.\u2014This volume gives the origin and genealogy of the H\u00e2shid and Bakail tribes, and contains also a short account of that province and of Hamdan.\u2014It also contains a treatise on the mines of gems and metals in Yemen, in which the localities of about sixty are given, including ten gold and eleven silver mines.\n\nThe Kit\u00e2b Jextret el Arab.\n\nContents.\u2014Introduction.\u2014On the climates of Hermes Trismegistus.\u2014The climates of Ptolemy.\u2014The latitudes and longitudes of the cities of Arabia.\u2014Description of the\ninhabited regions of Arabia.\u2014Account of Yemen and Socotra.\u2014Account of Aden, the most ancient emporium of Arabia.\u2014Account of Sanaa, the mother of Yemen.\u2014The wadies and mountains of Yemen.\u2014Account of Hadramaut and Beled Kindah.\u2014The townships or districts of Yemen.\u2014The Tehama and the land of Oman.\u2014The plants of Yemen.\u2014The languages of Arabia.\u2014Account of El Yemamah, its climate and productions.\u2014Description of the Jof.\u2014Account of Bahrein.\u2014Celebrated places between Yemen and Nejd.\u2014Chapter on the towns of mixed population between Irak and Sham and Yemen.\u2014Ancient emporia of Arabia.\u2014Highways of El Irak.\u2014Routes from Sanaa.\u2014Routes from Aden.\u2014Routes in Hadramaut.\u2014Wonders of Yemen not to be found elsewhere.\u2014The divisions of the peninsula of Arabia.\u2014Extracts from ancient geographical poems.\n\nThe next work, the Tarikh el Mostabsir, of Mohammed bin Yacoob ibn el Mojawir el Shami el Baghdadi, commonly called El Katiib, is a curious topographical work descriptive of South Arabia, unsystematic perhaps in its arrangement, but interesting and valuable from being the result of personal observation, and from the simplicity and minuteness of detail with which the author records his facts. It is a very useful companion to the geography of Hamdani, as it illustrates certain points on which the latter was not well informed, as for instance, the little known country between Yemen and Oman, on which he throws great light. Besides the geographical part, also, the author describes the manners and customs of the people, and gives other information nowhere else to be met with. The book is indeed eminently readable, and would well bear translation. I know nothing of the author except that he travelled a good deal in Arabia, and died about A.H. 650.

III.\u2014On the Methods of Disposing of the Dead at Llassa, Thibet, etc. By Charles Horne, late B.C.S.\n\nIn the year 1857 one of the travelling Llamas from Llassa came to Lahoul, in the K\u00fbl\u00fb country on the Himal\u00eah, and hearing of the mutiny was afraid to proceed. Major Hay, who was at that place in political employ, engaged this man to draw and describe for him many very interesting ceremonies in use in Llassa, amongst which was the method there employed in disposing of dead bodies. This so exactly confirms the accounts given by Strabo and Cicero, and is, moreover, of itself so curious, that I have transcribed it, with as many passages relating to the subject as readily came to hand; and as the Llama was a very fair draughtsman, I have had facsimiles made of his drawings to illustrate this paper. I will first give the extracts, and then the account of the Llama.\n\nM. Huc, the interesting Jesuit traveller, in his Travels, tome ii., p. 347, when at Llassa, alluding to hydrophobia, says (free translation):\u2014\"It is only surprising that this horrible complaint does not commit greater ravages when one thinks of the numbers of famished dogs who constantly prowl about the streets of Llassa. These animals are so numerous in this town that the Chinese say, ironically, that the three chief products of the capital of Thibet are Llamas, women, and dogs (Llama-Yat\u00e9on-Keon). This astonishing multitude of dogs is caused by the great respect that the Thibetans have for these animals, and the use they make of them for the disposal of their dead. There are four manners of sepulture in Thibet: first, incineration; second, throwing into the rivers or lakes; third, exposure on the summits of mountains; and the fourth, which is the most flattering of all, consists in cutting the dead bodies\nTim\u00f4d, who alone have power, and you will be devoured. But look up towards heaven, and you will see, as in a glass flickering, a red and yellow road, shining like lightning. On seeing it you will be greatly afraid, but never fear, and travel by that road, and you will be sure to reach Llama K\u00e2neh\u00f4k, or God, and you will enter into the Deity. If you cannot by any possibility get by that road, then go by the white road!! You are now become like air; you can\u2019t remain in this world; so be off!!\n\nNo. 9, Sipa, or Llama, consulting his book to see how the corpse is to be disposed of. If burnt, how the face is to be turned. The horn is that of the S\u00fbr\u00fb or Is\u00f4li\u00f4, which he takes in his hand to drive away evil spirits.\n\nNo. 10, S\u00fbruk\u00e2p\u00e2, burns incense.\n\nNo. 11, Ro, or a corpse. It is tied by a rope to the top of the room in a corner, and seated on an iron frame or stool, when the impurities are supposed to empty themselves below into a pan placed for the purpose. A cloth is placed over the head to conceal the face, and a pardah, or screen of cloth, is placed before the body, on which is affixed a picture of Sangy\u00ea Mulla, or Dooj\u00eah Zhigrit, a deity of the Gelukpas.\u00b9\n\nBefore the corpse on the ground is placed a little suttoo (fine flour), and some water. In this plate the knees only of the corpse are shown, the rest must be supposed.\n\nNo. 12 represents a man carrying off the corpse packed up in a portable shape, as also others with necessaries. The class of men who perform this work are called Togdun.\n\nNo. 13. The corpse at this place, Tut\u00f4t, is pegged out to five wooden pins. Then it is scored all over with a knife, and the men retire to a short distance and sit down and drink chang, or spirits, as shown in No. 14. The vultures meanwhile tear the flesh from the body, which does not take long, in consequence of the numbers always frequenting these spots. When the men return they find only the skeleton. They then take the bones to No. 15, where they pound them\n\n\u00b9 This Llama would appear to have belonged to the Gelukpa, or yellow sect, and his description applies more particularly to the customs of that sect of Buddhists, which is well represented at Llassa. The word means virtuous.\nup with stones and hammers, after which they are thrown to the vultures. No dogs are allowed here, and the place is called Ch\u00e1t\u00f3r, from Ch\u00e1, \u201ca bird.\u201d\n\nNo. 16 is a man singeing the hair off the head, a portion of the skull of which is preserved and afterwards pounded up, mixed with earth, and formed into small shapes with figures of Trilokn\u0101th or Sakya stamped upon them, or moulded into small Chortens or Dagobas.\n\nNo. 17 shows us the T\u00f3gduns drinking tea after their work is ended.\n\nNo. 18 represents a man driving off the vultures, Chagbt, to prevent them devouring the corpse until it shall first have been properly scored all over.\n\nPlate No. 3 represents a place in Llassa called R\u00e1g\u00fcp-d\u00fatd. Ra means \u201ca horn\u201d; Gyup, \u201cbehind\u201d; D\u00fatd, \u201cGolgotha.\u201d\n\nHere are five stones fixed in the ground, to which the corpse is tied, and three men, T\u00f3gdun, are cutting up the body and bones, all of which are given to the dogs. This mode of disposal of the dead is called Ki-chin (Ki is a dog). Very many dogs always remain at this place. The hammers and axes are for breaking up the skeleton. The man on the right supplies the operators with chang or spirits.\n\nNo. 18 represents the house which is called R\u00e1g\u00fcp-t\u00f3gdun, and is built of horns and inhabited by the T\u00f3ydun. There are a hundred of such houses in the suburbs of Llassa, besides two hundred inhabited by the butchers (Sh\u00e9va) constructed in a similar manner.\n\nAll these people beg and collect much money, chiefly from the relations of the dead, by whom they are well paid.\n\nThey are said to be insolent in their demands, and if anyone gives them half a tunka (or small piece of money), they spit upon it and throw it away, saying, \u201cIf you are not ashamed to give so little, I am ashamed to receive it.\u201d\n\nNo. 19 is the parapet of the R\u00e1k\u00e1ttchumi or well.\n\nNo. 20 is a Ch\u00e1noch\u00fap chorten, with a figure of Triloknath, supposed to have appeared there miraculously without mortal assistance.\nNo. 21, or Purkung (P\u0101r being applied to the corpse of a superior and Ro to that of an inferior; Khung signifies a house), shows the method in which the higher people of Llassa are burnt. A building is first erected, with a hollow in the centre, into which the body is placed in an upright position. The face is covered with red silk, and the wood used to burn the body is Shukpa, or pencil cedar (Juniperus excelsa), and frankincense. The attending Llama is shown feeding the flames with ghee or clarified butter.\n\nNo. 22 shows two Llamas, who are offering up prayers and the h\u014dn of sacrifice by fire, and are dressed the same as the deceased. They have in their hands the dril-bu or sacred bell.\n\nNo. 23. These choptahs, or vessels of green sugar, etc., are burnt with the body.\n\nWhen, however, a man of high rank dies from smallpox, he is not burnt, but buried, and a tomb, as shown in No. 24 (P\u016bltun), built of stone, is erected over the spot.\n\nShould the sufferer from the same complaint have been of inferior rank, a small heap of stones only is made over his grave, as shown in No. 25.\n\nNo. 26, Rogum or Rokum (Gum means a coffin), represents a Chinaman\u2019s body as laid in his coffin, with silver, gold, sugar, rice, etc. This coffin is then placed in a tomb, No. 27, called Gyamir\u014dkung, the place assigned for the burial being Tulchitung, two miles outside Llassa.\n\nNo. 28 shows a chief mourner, dressed in white, which is the colour of Chinese mourning. The other relations are not always clad in mourning, but all put on a linen or cotton turban, setting their ordinary caps on one side, which, however, all except the chief mourner resume when leaving the tomb.\n\nNo. 29 is the Washung or Chinese priest.\n\nNo. 30 are Sh\u014dkp\u0101, or fireworks, which are lighted and fired three times, when the mourners prostrate themselves nine times.\n\nAfter seven days have elapsed, they again visit the tomb, when the same ceremony is performed.\nAt No. 31 are represented dishes of sweetmeats, of which, after the fireworks and the nine prostrations, the mourners partake, and then return to their homes.\n\nNo. 32 shows Tch\u00fachint\u00f3rm\u00e1, a ceremony in which in one basin are placed little bits of flour paste rolled up, called torma; and in another water (tch\u00fa), with which these little pieces of paste are put. Chin, \"offering,\" completes the work.\n\nThe Llama is supposed to be offering these to the Id\u00e1k, or bad spirits aforementioned as inhabiting the place mentioned in Red Road No. 5. These Id\u00e1k have, as aforesaid, large heads, small necks, and large bellies never to be satisfied.\n\nIn Sanskrit the word Id\u00e1k is called Pr\u00e9t\u00e1, which means a departed soul, spirit of the dead, ghost, or evil spirit.\n\nSo far the Llama describes the different methods of the disposal of dead bodies in Lassa as observed by the Thibetans and Chinese.\n\nThere is, however, one other method of preserving the dead bodies of their highest Llamas.\n\nThe first process is to cover up the body in salt, which dissolves and becomes absorbed in the flesh; this process is repeated two or three times. When a sufficient quantity has been absorbed to preserve the body, it is taken out, the limbs relaxed, and the body placed in a sitting attitude and clothed; the hands having been placed in a position called Ch\u00edn Ch\u00fat. When the muscles of the face relax and the skin shrivels, wax is put in to fill up the cheeks to the natural size, and the body is preserved in a chorten as a mummy which can be seen at any time.\n\nNote by Major Hay.\u2014\"No man can fail to remark how similar the altar is to that shown on the reverse of many Sassanian coins. It is probable their custom of burning the bodies of their kings was the same, and the attendants seem even to have the same kind of cap. The ancient Persians, according to Herodotus and Strabo, exposed their dead to be devoured by vultures. It should, however, be remarked that the bodies of the old monarchs of Persia were interred, not burnt, which would have been contrary to the laws of\nZoroaster, as tending to desecrate the sacred element\u2014fire; nor were they previously exposed to be devoured by animals, as was prescribed by the precept of the Magi, with whom the dog was a sacred animal.\"\n\nIn continuation of the above, as the subject is one of interest, I subjoin a few extracts from Rollin's *Ancient History*, and other sources relative to the subject.\n\nThe ancient Persians, we are told by Herodotus, did not erect funeral piles for the dead or consume their bodies in the flames. \"Accordingly we find that Cyrus,\\(^1\\) when he was at the point of death, took care to charge his children to inter his body and to restore it to the earth; that is the expression he makes use of: by which he seems to declare, that he looked upon the earth as the original parent from whence he sprang, to which he ought to return. And when Cambyses had offered a thousand indignities to the dead body of Amasis,\\(^2\\) king of Egypt, he thought he crowned all by causing it to be burnt, which was equally contrary to the Egyptian and Persian manner of treating their dead. It was the custom of the latter to wrap up their dead in wax, in order to keep them longer from corruption.\"\n\nCicero says, *Tuscul. Qu\u00e6st.*, lib. i., p. 108:\n\n\"Condiunt Egyptii mortuos, et eos domi servant: Pers\u00e6 jam cer\u00e2 circumlitos condiunt, ut quam maxime permaneant diuturna corpora.\"\n\nMajor Hay, in his report on the Spiti Valley, written in 1850, tells us that incremation is the ordinary method of disposing of the dead in Spiti. Their ashes are thrown into the nearest running stream, the spot where the body was burnt plastered over with cowdung, and an urn put up.\n\nI have repeatedly seen these urns in Kurnawur, and always supposed them to contain the ashes, and I was informed that such was the case. Those dying of smallpox were not burned, but buried; and I have also seen the heaps of stones which had been placed over the grave, but curiously enough during the months that I was in the country I never witnessed a funeral or incremation.\n\n\\(^1\\) Cyrop., l. viii., p. 238.  \n\\(^2\\) Herod., l. iii., c. 16.\nART.

The same phenomenon, if visible to the northward, brings victory to such kings as stay in their residences; if it is seen in any intermediate quarter, it tends to the destruction of individuals of the mixed classes. When an aerial city, along with triumphal arches, appears in a tranquil quarter, it forebodes triumph to the king.\n\n3. On arising, in all quarters and at all times, the phenomenon brings danger to king and people. When it resembles smoke, fire, or a rainbow, it will kill thieves and foresters.\n\n4. An aerial city of faded colour brings wind and thunder; a glowing one causes the death of the monarch; one seen on the left augurs danger from the enemy, but one on the right brings victory.\n\n5. When a vari-coloured aerial city makes its appearance with streamers, standards, and gateways, then the earth is soon to swallow abundantly, on the battle-field, the blood of elephants, horses, and men.\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\n\nMock Suns.\n\n1. A mock sun, if sleek and showing the hue appropriate to the sun in the season in which it appears, is held auspicious;\nit brings peace and prosperity by being very bright, and beryl-coloured or white.\n\n2. A yellow one causes sickness, and one red, like an A\u1e63oka-blossom, announces the raging of the sword. A row of mock suns betokens danger from robbers, and is mortal to the sovereign.\\(^1\\)\n\n3. A mock sun, when standing north of the sun, gives rain; when south, wind; when on both sides, there is peril of inundation; when it is seen above, it is pernicious to the sovereign; when beneath, to the people.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XXXVIII.**\n\n_Haze._\n\n1. They say that the death of the king is augured by a haze appearing like a heap of thick darkness, when all quarters are so shrouded that hills, towns, and trees, are not discernible.\n\n2. In the same quarter where a mass of vapour first arises or vanishes, danger is undoubtedly approaching in a week.\n\n3. By a white mass of hazy clouds, the ministers and country people are to suffer; before long the sword will rage and success be much impeded.\n\n4. If at sunrise a haze arises, covering as it were the whole canopy for one or two days, it presages awful danger.\n\n5. Dimness uninterruptedly thickening during one night, destroys the principal monarch, but is conducive to the safety of sage rulers.\n\n6. In the kingdom where a thick mass of gloom is spreading for a couple of nights, one may foretell an invasion from hostile forces.\n\n7. A dimness descending and staying for three or four\n\n\\(^1\\) In the compound _dasyubhay\u0101tanka\u1e47\u1e6da\u1e47pah\u0101ntri_ a word like _da_, _kara_ is omitted by the poet.\n\n\\(^2\\) This chapter is wanting in the MSS. of the commentary, and betrays a style different from our author's.\nnights, blights food and fluids; when it lasts for five nights, there is to be a mutiny amongst the royal troops.\n\n8. When dimness arises, apart from the appearance of comets and the like, it produces horrible danger. Its effects are, as the masters of the science declare, unimpaired in any season but autumn.\n\nChapter XXXIX.\n\nTyphoons.\n\n1. When a wind clashing with another wind is struck down from the air to the earth, then a typhoon is produced. It is ill-boding if accompanied by the cries of vexed birds.\n\n2. At sunrise it will injure judges, kings, wealthy men, soldiers, wives, merchants, and courtesans; in the morning (from six to nine o'clock) it is mischievous to goats and sheep, \u00c7\u00fbdras and burgesses.\n\n3. At the time (from nine o'clock) till noon it will affect royal attendants and Brahmans; in the third part of the day (from noon till three o'clock), it will be bad for Vai\u00e7yas and rain-clouds, and in the fourth part for thieves.\n\n4. Just after sunset it destroys the outcasts; in the first watch of night it ruins the grains; in the second watch it vexes the hosts of imps.\n\n5. It will oppress horses and elephants in the third watch, and princes on the march in the fourth. It destroys the region to which it is tending, with a terrific, hollow noise.\n\nChapter XL.\n\nPrognostics for the Growth of Crops.\n\n1. Here are described which constellations on the Sun's entering Scorpio and Taurus are favourable, or the reverse, to the growth of autumnal and summer corn, according to the statements of B\u00e2dar\u00e2yana.\n\n2. The summer corn thrives, if, on the Sun's entering Scorpio, the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth house are occu-\npied by benign planets,\\(^1\\) or if he is looked at by the benign planets when in their power.\\(^2\\)\n\n3. If the Sun stands in Scorpio, Jupiter in Aquarius, and the Moon in Leo, or Jupiter in Leo and the Moon in Aquarius, the summer corn will prosper.\n\n4. If Venus or Mercury, or both, are stationed in the second house from the Sun, or in the twelfth, the corn will thrive, and exceedingly so should the constellation be favoured by the aspect of Jupiter.\\(^3\\)\n\n5. If the Sun, being in Scorpio, stands between Mercury and Venus, while Jupiter and the Moon are in the seventh house from the Sun, the harvest will be most excellent. When the Sun stands in the first part of Scorpio, and Jupiter in the second, one must expect a half crop.\n\n6. By Venus, the Moon and Mercury occupying the eleventh, fourth, and second house, the Sun being in Scorpio, the grains will prosper uncommonly, and so too will the cows should Jupiter at the same conjuncture occupy the tenth house.\n\n7. Jupiter in Aquarius, the Moon in Taurus, the Sun in the beginning of Scorpio, Mars and Saturn in Capricorn, form a constellation that promises a rich harvest, but afterwards danger from hostile invasions.\n\n8. The Sun, by standing in Scorpio, between two evil planets, makes the corn perish; a malign planet in the seventh house ruins it while sprouting.\\(^4\\)\n\n9. An evil planet occupying the second house, if not\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., Mercury, Jupiter, and Venus.\n\n\\(^2\\) The parallel passage in B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a has:\n\n\\(^3\\) B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a:\n\n\\(^4\\) B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a:\nlooked at by good planets, spoils the first growth, but is decidedly favourable to the corn sown afterwards.\n\n10. Two malign planets, if stationed in the seventh, tenth, fourth, or first house from the Sun, in Scorpio, make the crops miscarry, but not everywhere, so that the planetary aspects be not adverse.\\(^1\\)\n\n11. When two evil planets are standing in the seventh and sixth houses from the Sun in Scorpio, then one may expect a good harvest and a lowering of prices.\n\n12. In like manner the learned astrologer must determine whether the Sun on entering Taurus is to be pernicious or favourable to the grains that shoot out in autumn.\n\n13. If the Sun, when moving in Aries, Taurus, or Gemini, is in conjunction with benign planets, or in their aspect, the result is that the summer corn gets cheap\\(^2\\) and is consumed in peace.\n\n14. The Sun has the same effect upon the autumnal corn, if he stands in Sagittarius, Capricorn, or Aquarius at the period of collecting. The reverse will take place if he is in the aspect of, or in conjunction with, malign planets.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XLI.**\n\n*Classification of Natural Products.*\n\n1. To the domain of the sundry asterisms of the ecliptic, the Seers have assigned several natural products, for the prognostication of good or ill. I shall enumerate them according to traditional and authoritative lore.\n\n2. To Aries are said to belong: cloth, sheep\u2019s wool, goat\u2019s\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) B\u0101dar\u0101ya\u1e47a:\n\n\\(^2\\) Not \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u091a, as the printed text has it, but \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f is the true reading; cf. ch. xli. 12. The same word occurs in a passage from some Sm\u1e5bti quoted by Nilakan\u1e6dha in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata, xiii. 23, 21 (Bombay ed.):\n\n\u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091a\u093f \u092f\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\u0938 \u0935\u0948 \u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0915\u094b \u0928\u093e\u092e \u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0964\nhair, lentils, wheat, resin, barley, weeds growing on land, and gold.\n\n3. To Taurus are referred, cloth, flowers, wheat, rice, barley, buffaloes, and bullocks; to Gemini, corn, whatever grows up in autumn, creepers, esculent bulbs of water-lilies, and cotton.\n\n4. To Cancer belong, paspalum, plantains, d\u00fbb-grass, fruits, roots, leaves, and cocoa-nuts; to Leo, grain in husks, essences, skins of lions, etc., and sugar.\n\n5. To Virgo pertain, flax, awnless barley,\\(^1\\) dolichos, wheat, kidney-beans and grain in pods;\\(^2\\) to Libra, peas, wheat, white mustard seed and barley.\n\n6. Under Scorpio are brought, sugar-cane, whatever grows through being watered, iron, goats and sheep; under Sagittarius, horses, salt, cloth, missiles, sesamum, grain, and roots.\n\n7. To Capricorn belong, trees, shrubs, whatever grows through being watered, sugar-cane, gold and black iron; to Aquarius, aquatic products, fruits, flowers, jewels, and brilliant things.\n\n8. Under Pisces are, such jewels as come from testaceous animals,\\(^3\\) aquatic products, diamonds, various oils, and whatever comes from fishes.\n\n9. By standing in the fourth, tenth, second, eleventh, seventh, ninth, or fifth house, from the particular asterism (to which any product belongs), Jupiter promotes the increase of the products; so does Mercury by standing in the second, eleventh, tenth, fifth, or eighth house.\n\n10. The planet Venus causes loss in the sixth or seventh house, but increase in the rest. The malign planets are favourable, if stationed in the Houses of Increase,\\(^4\\) but inflict loss if standing in other places.\n\n\\(^1\\) The meaning is doubtful; the Comm. only says that kal\u00e2ya is a sasyam; at any rate it must be something different from kulattha.\n\n\\(^2\\) About nishp\u00e2va the Comm. remarks: \u0936\u0941\u092d\u0938\u093e\u0917\u0930 \u0927\u093e\u0930\u093f \u092a\u0941\u0928\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0935\u0903 \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u090f\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0964 \u0936\u093f\u092e\u093f\u091a\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f \u0915\u0947\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0965\n\n\\(^3\\) e.g. from the pearl oyster.\n\n\\(^4\\) i.e. the third, sixth, tenth and eleventh.\n11. If the evil planets in their power stand at evil distances from any asterism, the articles assigned to such an asterism will become dear and scarce.\n\n12. The benign planets in their power, by occupying a good place with respect to any asterism, have the effect of making the products belonging to such an asterism cheap and abundant.\\(^1\\)\n\n13. A sign in the aspect of good planets in their power produces no evil, even if the houses occupied are unfavourable. The reverse applies to the aspect of malign planets.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter XLII.**\n\n*Prognostics for the Rising or Lowering of Prices.*\n\n1, 2. A change in the prices may be foretold on observing uncommon rainfall, meteors, an airy staff, halo, eclipse, mock sun or moon, and such like phenomena at new or full moon, and at the Sun\u2019s entrance into a new sign, every month. As to uncommon phenomena on any other day of the month, those have a tendency to make monarchs suffer from frays.\n\n3. (If any of the aforesaid phenomena is seen) when the Sun has reached Aries, one should purchase summer corn; and when the sun stands in Taurus, buy wild roots and fruits. Then one shall gain (in selling those articles) in the fourth month following.\n\n4. If one makes a store of all sorts of flavours and grain during the Sun\u2019s stay in Gemini, he shall in selling them in the sixth month after have an enormous gain.\n\n5. By laying up honey, perfumes, oil, ghee, and syrup, at the time of the Sun\u2019s stay in Cancer, one will get twice the prime cost in the second month; but by selling before or after that period, one will sustain loss.\n\n6. When the Sun is in Leo, one should buy gold, jewels, skins, bark, weapons, pearls, and silver. If one sells them in the fifth month, there will be profit, but otherwise loss.\n\n\\(^1\\) \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d instead of \u0938\u093e\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u094d\u092f\u092e\u094d; cf. ch. xl. 13.\n7. The buyer of chowries, donkeys, camels, and horses, when the Sun has reached Virgo, shall gain double if he sell in the sixth month afterwards.\n\n8. When the Sun is in Libra, let one purchase woven articles, jewels, woollen cloths, glass, yellow flowers, and corn; these will, in six months, fetch double their price.\n\n9. Fruits, bulbs, roots, and various gems, taken in when the Sun stands in Scorpio, and laid up for two years, yield a profit equal to double the prime cost.\n\n10. Let one buy saffron, conch shells, coral, glass, and pearls, when the Sun is in Sagittarius; six months after those articles will fetch double prices.\n\n11. He who is anxious to gain must purchase iron wares and corn when the Sun occupies Capricorn and Aquarius, and sell a month after; he then gets double their prime cost.\n\n12. By storing roots, fruits, bulbs, vessels, and jewels, when the Sun has reached Pisces, for half a year, one shall obtain a handsome profit.\n\n13. These profits in reference to each sign of the ecliptic are only promised in case the Sun or Moon is in conjunction with a friendly planet, and in the aspect of such a one as is befriended for the time being.\n\n14. The Moon, by being in conjunction with the Sun, or, when full, in conjunction with, or looked at, by benign planets, instantly causes a rising of prices. Both she and the Sun, however, spoil the prices, if both are in conjunction with, or in aspect of, evil planets. In this way one has to tell the good or evil effects, after ascertaining which substances are assigned to each house.\n\nChapter XLIII.\n\nFestivity of Raising Indra's Banner.\n\n1. The immortals said unto the Creator: \"O Lord! we are unable to resist in battle the children of darkness. Hence we approach Thee, the resource of those who are in need.\"\n\n2. The Lord said to the gods: \"In the Milk-sea is Ke\u00e7ava;\nHe will give you the ensign, at the sight of which the demons shall not withstand you in the struggle.\"\n\n3, 4. On obtaining this boon, the gods with Indra went to the Milk-sea, and praised Him who is marked by the \u00c7r\u012bvatsa, whose breast is beaming with the rays of the Kaustubha gem, Him the Lord of \u00c7r\u012b, the incomprehensible and incomparable one, the life essence of all living beings, Vish\u1e47u, the highest soul, who is without beginning, and to whom no limit is known.\n\n5. Then, satisfied by their praises, the divine N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a gave them the ensign that shall prove for the faces of the brides of the demons such as the Moon is for the day blowing lotus, but for the countenances of the goddesses, such as the Sun is for the same flowers.\n\n6. Indra gladdened at receiving the ensign produced from Vish\u1e47u's lustre, which was carried on an eight-wheeled fulgent chariot, resplendent with gems, as if it were the Sun beaming forth in autumn.\u00b9\n\n7. By raising that standard, adorned with many tinkling objects, garlands, umbrellas, bells and trinkets, the king of the gods annihilated in battle the host of the enemy.\n\n8. The king of the gods granted the bambu flagstaff to Vasu the sky-traveller, lord of Cedi, and that monarch treated the gift with due respect.\u00b2\n\n9, 10. Satisfied by that festive demonstration, the ruler of heaven declared: \"Those kings who will act in the same manner shall be rich like Vasu, and see their behests obeyed on earth. Their people will be contented, free from peril and sickness, and have abundance of food. The ensign is\n\n\u00b9 The general import of the myth appears to be, that the Sun, the source of light (Vish\u1e47u) bestows on heaven (Indra) his own ketu (i.e. ensign and first gleam of day), before which the spirits of darkness must needs vanish. The festival described in this chapter, like many other feasts at certain seasons, may be called a natural myth rendered plastic, dramatized. The eight-wheeled chariot is the day divided into eight y\u0101mas.\n\n\u00b2 The same myth is told in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata i. 63, 15, seqq. (Bombay ed.).\nalso to bode through foretokens what good or evil consequences await mankind.\"\n\n11. Now am I going to propound, according to authoritative traditional lore, how in the days of yore monarchs wishing for victory and increase of power have honoured that standard by Indra's command.\n\n12. The precept is as follows:\u2014The astrologer and master-carpenter go to the wood at a lucky Karana,\\(^1\\) day, asterism, and at an auspicious hour, when all augurs well for the journey.\n\n13, 14. Trees not fit as material for Indra's standard are such as grow in public gardens, temple yards, cemeteries, ant-hills, roads, and hallowed spots; or such as are stunted, sear at the top, spinous trees, those entwined by creepers and parasitic plants, or covered with numerous birds' nests and holes, or hurt by fire and wind, and such as bear feminine appellations.\n\n15, 16. The fittest trees are Terminalia Arjuna, Vatica robusta, Terminalia tomentosa, Grislea tomentosa,\\(^2\\) and glomerated fig-tree. In taking one out of these five or some other estimated timber tree growing on white or black soil, the Brahman divine has first in due form to pay his respects to the tree, and after approaching it on a lonely spot at night time, touch it and recite the following spell:\n\n17. \"Hail to all beings living in this tree! Reverence to ye! May you change your abode after taking this oblation:\n\n18. \"Hail to thee, O pre-eminent tree! The king chooses thee for the standard of the king of the gods: accept thou this homage!\"\n\n19. On the next morning the carpenter has to hew the tree, with his face turned towards the north or east. A hollow sound of the felling axe is not auspicious, but a soft and full tone favourable.\n\n\\(^1\\) cf. ch. 99, 6.\n\n\\(^2\\) The r. dhava of the printed text is as doubtful as its rendering; the Comm. has vadha, certainly the word from which b\u0101dhaka, explained as r\u0101jav\u1e5bksha and girim\u0101la (see B\u00f6htl. and Roth, Dict. i. v. b\u0101dhaka), is derived.\n20. If the tree falls to the eastward or northward, unimpaired, not crooked, and without getting entangled in another tree, it bodes victory to the sovereign; should the tree come down under the contrary circumstances, it must be left alone.\n\n21. After chopping off four digits from the top, and eight from the bottom, one must throw the trunk into water; and then, after it has been taken out again, have it transported to the town gate by means of a cart, or carried by men.\n\n22. If one of the spokes gives way, there will be bickerings in the army; if it is the periphery that breaks, you may be sure that the army will be destroyed. Rupture of the axle presages loss of wealth, and of the axle-pins bodes ruin to the carpenter.\n\n23, 24. On the eighth day of the bright half of Bh\u00e2drapada should the king, surrounded by citizens, with the astrologers, ministers, chamberlains, and Brahmans foremost among them, all in festive dress, order the standard of Indra to be carried by citizens into the town, amidst the sounds of horns and musical instruments, while the staff is covered with new cloth, and enveloped in garlands, perfumes, and incense.\n\n25, 26. Gaudy streamers, triumphal arches, and festoons of wild flowers adorn the town where the inhabitants are over-merry; where the streets are cleaned and trimmed, crowded with handsomely-attired courtesans; where the shops are trimmed up, the squares crowded with mimics, dancers, and singers; where many festive and solemn shouts are heard.\n\n27. White streamers foreshow triumph, but yellow ones sickness; vari-coloured ones bring victory, whereas red ones presage the raging of the sword.\n\n28. If the staff in entering the town is subverted by elephants or other animals, danger is impending. A sound of boys clapping hands or a fight between animals (on that occasion) augurs war.\n\n29. Thereon (when the beam has safely arrived in town) must the carpenter plane it, and then raise it on a machine according to the rules. The king now orders a vigil to be\nkept with it, on the eleventh (of the bright half of Bh\u0101drapada).\n\n30. The court priest, clad in white and wearing a white turban, makes a sacrifice to the Fire with hymns to Indra and Vi\u1e63\u1e47u, whilst the astrologer has to observe the symptoms.\n\n31. A blazing fire, ardent, smooth, compact, having the shape of auspicious things, brings blessings; one showing different qualities is evil. This subject has been more amply treated in the Y\u0101tra.\\(^1\\)\n\n32. A fire that at the final benediction blazes forth of itself, and with soft lustre turns its flame to the right, renders all earth subject to the monarch, she whose girdle is the ocean and whose lovely necklace is the glittering stream of the Ganges and Jamn\u0101.\n\n33. When the fire shows the hue of gold, A\u015boka blossom, yellow Barleria, lotus, beryl stone or blue lotus, then shall darkness, expelled by the rays, find no room in the royal house.\n\n34. Those (princes) to whom fire emits a noise like that of a multitude of chariots, like the sea, clouds, elephants, or battle-drums, shall in their march cause the regions to be darkened and shaken by the troops of their infuriated elephants.\n\n35. Whenever fire assumes the shape of a banner, jar, horse, elephant, or hill, earth (in all her extension, so as to have) the mountains of sunrise and sunset for lips, and the Him\u0101laya and Vindhya for breasts, comes under the sway of (such) kings (for whom the sacrificial fire shows those symptoms).\n\n36. If fire has the scent of the elephant\u2019s frontal juice, of oil, lotus, fried grains, ghee, or honey, earth is to be like a mosaic formed by the rays issuing from the crown jewels of prostrate potentates.\n\n37. These good or evil omens which arise from the fire at (the festival of) Indra\u2019s banner, are likewise to be observed\n\n\\(^1\\) Yogay\u0101tra, ch. viii.\nat the casting of horoscopes, at sacrifices, propitiating oblations to the planets, at the periods of marching and wedding.\n\n38. When the priests have been honoured with sugar, cakes, milk porridge, etc., and with guerdons, the ensign of Indra should be raised on the twelfth, whether the asterism of the date be \u00c7ravana or another.\n\n39, 40. Manu has laid down the rule, that there are seven or five smaller flagstaffs to be wrought by skilled artisans and called \u201cIndra\u2019s daughters.\u201d The two named Nand\u00e2 and Upanand\u00e2 measure three-quarters of the height (of the great standard), Jay\u00e2 and Vijay\u00e2, and two others, both termed Vasundhar\u00e2, are taller by a sixteenth. Higher by an eighth than all these is \u201cIndra\u2019s mother,\u201d in the middle.\n\n41. The various trinkets with which the immortals once joyfully decorated the divine banner, ought to be put on in due order.\n\n42. The first ornament, being of quadrangular shape, and of the hue of red A\u00e7oka blossom, was given by Vi\u00e7vakarman. Brahma and \u00c7iva gave a vari-coloured girdle.\\(^1\\)\n\n43. The third ornament, octangular and dark red, was granted by Indra. Yama bestowed the fourth gift, a dark, yet lustrous, pillow.\\(^2\\)\n\n44. The fifth gift from Varuna, was a sexangular, madder-hued, and resembling waving water; the sixth, from the god of air, was an armlet made of peacock\u2019s feathers, and dark as a cloud.\n\n45. Skanda contributed for the banner his own motley arm ring,\\(^3\\) being the seventh gift. The eighth ornament, given by the god of Fire, bore likeness to a fire flame.\n\n\\(^1\\) The first ornament seems to signify the first streak of red at dawn; the girdle belonging to Brahma, in his quality as Praj\u00e2pati and samvat\u00e2ra, and to \u00c7iva, in his quality as Time, is a symbol of the circle of Time.\n\n\\(^2\\) The gift of Indra is, apparently, a symbol of the day divided into eight watches; Yama\u2019s is a symbol of rest, and at the same time something lustrous, because Yama is the lord of the dead and the genius of evening twilight.\n\n\\(^3\\) Skanda, the \u201cmarching\u201d god, and therefore called the Wargod, is\n46. The Moon presented, ninthly, a collar hued like beryl-stone.\\(^1\\) The Sun in his quality of Maker (of the phenomenal world) bestowed a tenth gift, an ornament resplendent and similar to a chariot\u2019s wheel.\n\n47. The Vi\u00e7ye Devas contributed the eleventh ornament, called Udvan\u00e7a,\\(^2\\) and lotus coloured. The Seers gave the twelfth, termed Nivan\u00e7a, and showing the tinge of the blue lotus.\n\n48. The planets Jupiter and Hesperus offered as their share to the standard the thirteenth ornament, something projecting at the upper and lower ends, largest at the top, and coloured like red lac.\n\n49. These decorations to the banner are, each of them, consecrated to the divine being by whom they were produced, which the wise will do well to observe.\n\n50. The circumference of the first trinket is a third of the extension of the banner. The dimensions of each of the following must be lessened by an eighth.\n\n51. On the fourth day next, a skilled person must equip Indra\u2019s standard, and the king\\(^3\\) devoutly recite the following prayers which Manu has handed down from tradition.\n\n52, 53. \u201cEven as thou, O source of vigour, hast been honoured with manifold sublime ornaments by \u00c7iva, the Sun, Yama, Indra, the Moon, Kubera, Agni, Varuna, the hosts of great Seers, the goddesses of the quarters, the Nymphs, Hesperus, Jupiter, Skanda, and the host of Winds, so mayest thou now, O God, graciously accept these beautiful ornaments.\u201d\n\n54. \u201cThou art the unborn, imperishable, eternal, unchangeable One; thou the all-fertilizing Vish\u1e47u, the the personification of the year in its course; hence his token is a ring, a circle.\n\n\\(^1\\) A symbol of the cluster of asterisms, of course. The colour vai\u1e0d\u0101rya is, according to Utpala, \u201cdeep yellow,\u201d nilapitak\u0101nti.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. gives no satisfactory explanation of the terms udvan\u00e7a and nivan\u00e7a; he only says, udvan\u00e7andimbhara\u1e47am and nivan\u00e7am n\u0101ma.\n\n\\(^3\\) That the king himself has to recite the prayers is not only stated by the Comm., but is also manifest from st. 56.\nprimitive soul; thou art Death, the all-destroying Fire; adorable art thou, with a thousand heads and a hundred moods!\"\n\n55. \"I invoke the seven-tongued Seer, who will save us; I invoke Indra, who will protect us, the ruler of the gods, the mighty, well armed killer of V\u1e5btra. May our warriors be victorious!\"\n\n56. The king should, without breaking his fast, recite these auspicious verses when Indra's standard is being decorated, raised, brought into town, cleaned, crowned with garlands, and when it is being removed.\n\n57, 58. The ensign of Indra must be adorned with an umbrella, streamer, mirror, fruits, crescents, variegated garlands, stems of plantain and sugar-cane, with trinkets, figures of snakes and lions, loopholes and images of the guardian gods of the quarters. Then should it be raised, fastened with unimpaired ropes and props made from strong wood, together with the smaller standards styled \"Indra's daughters,\" these also made of strong wood, and unbroken. The triumphal arch is secured at the bottom by tightly fitting mechanisms and pins.\n\n59. The unceasing shouts of the crowd, along with festive cries, benedictions, and salutations; the piercing sounds of war-drums, tabors, horns, kettle-drums and other instruments must accompany the raising of the standard, all inauspicious sounds being hushed, as Brahmans incessantly recite texts prescribed in the Scriptures.\n\n60. The sovereign should (if necessary) order the citizens having fruits, curds, ghee, fried grains, wax, and flowers in their hands, while bowing their heads and shouting praises, to keep Indra's standard with the point directed against the residence of the foe as if threatening death to him.\n\n1 The v. r. has hala, \"plough.\"\n\n2 The compound a\u00e7ubharahitacabdum here denotes \"without inauspicious sounds,\" and not, as it grammatically does, \"with sounds free from evil omens.\" Grammar has been sacrificed to the exigencies of prosody; cf. ch. xix. 17 (trans.). The correct form of the compound would be a\u00e7ubha\u00e7abdarahitam.\n61. The raising is lucky, if it is proceeding neither too hastily nor too slowly, steadily, without damage to the garlands, trinkets, and other decorations. If otherwise, it is an evil omen, which the court priest should assuage through expiatory rites.\n\n62. If carrion birds, owls, doves, crows, and herons perch on the banner, it is asserted that great peril awaits the sovereign; and if a blue jay perches on it, the prince royal is threatened. A hawk alighting on it forebodes danger to eyesight.\n\n63. The breaking or falling of the umbrella gives rise to the king's death; marks of honey clinging to the standard presage robbery; a meteor (coming down on it) destroys the monarch, and a thunderstroke the queen.\n\n64. The fall of a pennant has for its effect the loss of the queen; the coming down of a trinket produces drought. The flagstaff snapping asunder in the middle, at the top or the bottom, destroys the ministers, the king, or citizens (successively).\n\n65. Danger from fire is foreboded by smoke; obscuration of mind by darkness; the ministers are undone when snake images are breaking or drop. In consequence of portents (seen) to the northward (of the banner), Brahmans are afflicted; by such as are seen to the eastward, Kshatriyas, and so forth. The death of courtesans is announced by one of the smaller staffs, termed Indra's daughters, breaking.\n\n66. If a rope gets loose or snaps asunder, children will suffer; if a prop does, the king's mother comes to grief. Whatever unseemly or decent should be acted by children or histrions, will have results corresponding with it.\n\n67. When the erected standard of Indra has been worshipped during four days, the king must, for the weal of his army, in company with his ministers, with all reverence cause it to be removed.\n\n68. A prince who respects this institution, first established by Vasu, the sky-traveller, and always since observed by other rulers, may feel certain that no danger from enemies shall befall him.\nChapter XLIV.\n\nLustration Ceremony.\n\n1. A lustration of horses, elephants, and troops ought to be performed at the season when our Lord Vishnu, whose eyelashes are the rain-clouds, and whose eyes are Sun and Moon, awakes from his slumber.\n\n2. The expiatory ceremony termed lustration is to take place on the eighth, twelfth, or fifteenth of the bright half of K\u0101rttika or \u0100\u00e7vayuja.\n\n3. There must be constructed on an approved spot, northeastward of the town, a triumphal arch of excellent wood, sixteen cubits in height, and ten cubits in extent; besides a lodge where the expiatory rites are to be performed, made of branches of Shorea robusta, glomerated fig-tree or Terminalia Arjuna, and thickly strewn with holy grass, its door adorned with bambu fish figures, pennons, and quoits.\n\n4. When the horses are brought into the lodge, they should have attached to their necks, by means of an amulet string, marking nuts, rice, costus, and white mustard seed, for the sake of their thriving.\n\n5. The priest performs in the lodge the expiatory ceremony for the horses, during a week, with prayers to the Sun, Varu\u1e47a, the Vi\u00e7ve-Devas, the Creator, Indra, and Vishnu.\n\n6. The horses are to be treated with respect, not spoken to in a harsh way, nor beaten, their fears being removed by festive sounds, and the noise of horns, musical instruments, and song.\n\n7. On the eighth day is erected, south of the arch, a shed with its front to the north, strewn with holy grass and tree barks; the fire is placed on the sacrificial eminence (prepared) east of the shed.\n\n---\n\n1 Utpala adds: \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093f\u0915\u093e\u092f\u093e\u092e\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0923 \u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u093e\u092d\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d-\n\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u0902\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u093d\u093d\n\n\u092f\u091a\u094d\u091b \u091a\u0924\u0941\u0903\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0915\u0930\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0939\u0947 \u092c\u0947\u0926\u0940 \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0939\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0939\u092e\u093e\u0932\u093e\u0964\n\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0924\u0924\u094b\u0903\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0915\u0932\u094d\u092a\u0947\u0923 \u0926\u093e\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0964\n9, 10, 11.

The fuel must be from the khayar, Butea frondosa, glomerated fig-tree, Gmelina arborea or pipal. One should make the sacrificial ladle of gold or silver, if one is anxious of well-being.\n\n13.

After consecrating and washing a horse marked with lucky signs and a choice elephant, honouring them with new white cloth, perfumes, garlands, and incense, one should softly lead them, with caressing words, under the triumphal arch amid the sounds of musical instruments, horns and festive shouts filling the quarters far and wide.\n\n17. If the horse led to the spot, there stands with his right foot uplifted, the king will soon without difficulty conquer his foes.\n\n18. A restive animal bodes ill to the sovereign. The other motions of elephants and horses have been expounded in the Y\u00e2tr\u00e2, and ought here also to be considered so far as applicable.\n\n19. The priest should give the courser a morsel, having muttered a benediction over it. By smelling at it or eating, the animal is said to bring victory; in the contrary case, the reverse is to happen.\n\n20. The priest now plunges a branch of glomerated fig-tree into the water in the jars, and touches with it horses, soldiers, elephants, and the king himself, with prayers for expiation and prosperity.\n\n21. The expiatory ceremony for the weal of the realm being done, the priest proceeds to utter imprecatory spells, at the same time piercing with a stiletto the breast of a clay figure representing the enemy.\n\n22. The court priest then puts, praying, the bridle bit into the horse's mouth, whereupon the king mounts, and, the lustration being finished, moves with his army in a north-easterly direction.\n\n23. The monarch, illumined by the multitude of moving gleams proceeding from his numerous crown jewels, shines like the sun at the season when the clouds have disappeared, whilst the wind is scented with the fragrance of the juice trickling from the elephants that are merry from hearing the sound of tabor and horn.\n24. The bright chowries wafting delicious breezes around the king resemble the rows of swans of the king of the mountains (Him\u0101laya) flying to and fro. It is those breezes by which the splendid wreaths and garments are slightly moved.\n\n25. Equipped with diadem, earrings, and armlets studded with various gems and diamonds, and perfused by the rays of many jewels, the monarch shows the lustre of the rainbow.\n\n26. Surrounded by horses that seem to fly upwards to the sky, and by elephants that appear to rend the earth, the prince will march amid his men as if he were Indra amid the victorious gods.\n\n27. Or adorned with diamonds and pearls, wearing a white garland, turban, and perfumed garments, mounted on an elephant and covered by the umbrella, he bears comparison to Hesperus, when shining forth above a dark cloud and below the Moon.\n\n28. He who owns an army in which men, horses, and elephants are over-merry, which is glittering from the beams of polished weapons, shows no evil symptoms, and strikes terror into the ranks of the enemy, shall soon conquer the earth.\n\nChapter XLV.\n\nSight of Wagtails.\n\n1. I am going to tell the effects which, agreeably to the statements of the sages, take place on the first appearance of the bird commonly called wagtail.\n\n2. A big sort of wagtail, with erected and black neck, is named \"lucky,\" and brings luck. Another, black as far as his neck and face, is called \"complete,\" and fulfils hopes.\n\n3. A third species has a black dot on the neck and white cheeks; his name is \"empty,\" and he makes empty. A yellow one, called orpiment-yellow,\\(^1\\) augurs evil by its appearance.\n\n\\(^1\\) In this instance gop\u012bta is not well to be explained, but as another spelling for gopitta. The words pitta and pita are certainly originally identical.\n4, 5, 6. A wagtail brings happiness by being seen on sweet odorous fruits, flowers, and trees; at water reservoirs, hallowed spots, on the head of an elephant, horse, or snake; on palaces and temples, in public gardens, near mansions, cows, a cow station, a company of fashionable people, a sacrifice, feast, princes, Brahmans; on stables for elephants or horses; on umbrellas, flags, chowries, and the like; near gold; on white cloths, water-lilies, blue lotuses, places decorated and patched up, vessels of curds, and corn ricks.\n\n7. Sweet food will be obtained when the bird is standing in mud; abundance of milk (may be expected), when he is standing on cow dung. When he goes on the turf, one is to get cloth, and when he stands on a cart the country is to perish.\n\n8. By being seen on the thatch of a house he intimates loss of wealth; by standing on a thong, imprisonment; by being stationed on an unclean spot, sickness. By being perched on the back of a goat or sheep, he will bring about a speedy meeting between lovers.\n\n9. A wagtail is ill-omened and threatens death and disease when appearing on buffaloes, camels, donkeys, bones, cemeteries, in house corners, on gravel, hills, town walls, ashes, or hairs.\n\n10. The wagtail is disastrous when he is clapping his wings, but auspicious when drinking water or standing by a river. He bodes good at sunrise, but produces evil effects when seen at sunset.\n\n11. If a sovereign after the consummation of a lustration of his army moves in the direction in which he sees a wagtail go, his foe soon comes under his sway.\n\n12. On the spot where a wagtail goes a-pairing, there is a treasure; beneath the place where he vomits, is glass; and where he voids his increments is charcoal. So they say; wherefore, to remove your curiosity, you may dig the soil.\n\n13. A dead, crippled, wounded, or diseased, bird produces effects corresponding with his bodily condition. When he is\n\n---\n\n*The Comm. has *atta*, \"a turret, bastion,\" instead of *adri*.\nalighting in one's presence, he brings wealth; and when he is flying up into the air, he yields a meeting with relations.\n\n14. The king, too, when he sees an auspicious wagtail on an auspicious spot, should arrange on the ground a hospitable offering, wholesome and acceptable, along with fragrant flowers and incense. Then he shall prosper.\n\n15. Even if it be an ill-omened wagtail the king descries, he shall not come to grief, provided he be careful to honour the Brahmans, his gurus, virtuous men, and the deities, and take no flesh meat for a week.\n\n16. The effects attending the first appearance of wagtails are to take place within a year; in other cases, however, on the very day at a later hour. (To foretell the effects), one must make due allowance for modifying circumstances, as direction, place, countenance, horoscope, state of quiet or molestation, and so forth.\n\nChapter XLVI.\n\nPortentous Phenomena.\n\n1. I am going to treat of the portents which Garga expounded to Atri. A portent may be shortly defined as anything contrary to nature.\n\n2. From the accumulation of evil, owing to men's sinful conduct, comes calamity, which celestial, atmospherical, and terrestrial portents foreshow.\n\n3. The deities, displeased with men's sinful conduct, produce these portents, to paralyze which the ruler should order an expiation in his kingdom.\n\n4. Celestial portents are unnatural phenomena of planets and stars, meteors, typhoons, storms, haloes. Atmospherical ones are aerial cities (Fata morgana), rainbows, and such-like.\n\n5, 6. Terrestrial portents are those which occur with movable and immovable things. The latter may be checked by expiations and allayed; an atmospherical portent may be somewhat mitigated, whereas a celestial one cannot be assuaged. Thus it is asserted by some. Yet a celestial portent also may\nbe allayed through donations of much gold, food, cows, and land, through (the ceremony of) milking a cow on a precinct hallowed to Rudra, and through the Ko\u1e6dihoma.\n\n7. A celestial portent may affect the sovereign in eight different ways, viz., in its consequences to himself, his children, his treasury, his horse and elephants, his residence, his wife, his priest, or his people.\n\n8. The falling into pieces without any assignable cause, the moving, sweating, weeping, talking, and the like, of emblems of \u0106iva, of idols and shrines, tend to the destruction of ruler and land.\n\n9. The breaking or coming down of an axle, wheel, yoke, flag on the cart at a religious procession, the being upset, sinking in or getting entangled of the cart, bring no good to land and king.\n\n10. A portent appearing at images of the seers, Yama, the ancestors and Brahma, is disastrous to Brahmans; a portent at the idols of Rudra and the guardians of the quarters, is so to cattle.\n\n11. A portent at images of the planets Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, augurs ill to court priests; one at Vishnu\u2019s idol, to the people at large; one at Skanda\u2019s and Vi\u1e63\u0101kha\u2019s, to governors of provinces.\n\n12. An unnatural phenomenon at the image of the Veda-Vy\u0101sa, threatens the royal counsellors; and one at Vin\u0101yaka\u2019s, the commander of the army. A portent at Dh\u0101tar\u2019s and Vi\u1e63vakarman\u2019s statue is stated to be disastrous to the people.\n\n13. Any unnatural symptom at the images of the boys, girls, wives, and attendants of the gods, concerns the king\u2019s sons, daughters, wives, and retainers.\n\n14. The same applies to images of giants, imps, elves, and snakes. All of them produce their effects in eight months.\n\n15. On perceiving an abnormal phenomenon at an idol, the court priest, purified by a three days\u2019 fast and bathing, should worship the idol with a bath, flowers, ointment, and garments.\n\n16. The priest has, in due manner, to wait upon the idol with a dish of honey and milk, such as presented to a guest,\nto which are added sweetmeats and oblations of fruits, etc. Farther he should present a cooked oblation, according to the rules, along with prayers addressed to the god.\n\n17. Those kings who, at the appearance of unnatural symptoms of idols, duly direct expiations to be performed, Brahmans and gods to be honoured, and a festival with singing and dancing to be held for a week, shall not experience the evil results, as they are checked by those formalities and by sacrificial fees.\n\n18. In any country where something not fiery blazes forth, and where fire not lacking the necessary fuel will not flame, you may be sure that ruler and subjects shall be distressed.\n\n19. If water, flesh, or anything wet, blazes, the king shall be killed; if a weapon does so, there is to be a dreadful war; the going out of fires in camps, villages, or towns, brings danger.\n\n20. Where palaces, houses, gateways, flags and the like are burned by fire or lightning, there is surely a hostile invasion to be expected.\n\n21. Smoke issuing from something else but fire, as well as haziness and utter darkness by day, forebode great danger. The disappearing of the stars in a cloudless night, and their being visible by day, is mischievous.\n\n22. A glare proceeding from towns, quadrupeds, birds, or men, is said to be dangerous. The appearing of smoke, fire, and sparks, on couches, clothes, and hair, causes death.\n\n23. On seeing weapons\\(^1\\) blaze, move, utter sounds, jump out of the sheath, tremble, or show any other unnatural symptoms, one may predict that dreadful war and tumult is quickly approaching.\n\n24. In such cases one has to offer white mustard seed and\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. has a remark touching the proper meaning of \u0101yudha, in reference to the word prahar\u0101\u1e47a occurring in stanza 19.

Besides, gold must be bestowed on the Brahmans. Such is the expiation for portents of fire, etc.\n\n25. When boughs of trees on a sudden snap asunder, you may predict a warlike expedition. On the laughing of trees follows ruin of the country; on their weeping follows prevalence of diseases.\n\n26. A tree produces discord in the realm by blossoming out of season. When a young tree is excessively in bloom, children will die. When milk is flowing from a tree, all kinds of substances will be lost.\n\n27. The oozing out of spirituous liquor produces the loss of elephants and horses; that of blood, brings war; that of honey, sickness. When oil is flowing out, there is danger of famine; when water issues, there is some great peril.\n\n28. The sprouting of withered trees, and the withering of healthy ones, augurs loss of strength and food. When trees, once fallen, raise themselves, danger is to arise by the decrees of fate.\n\n29. When a tree held in especial esteem bears blossoms and fruits out of season, it is concluded that death awaits the sovereign; smoke or glare from it denotes likewise the king's death.\n\n30. By trees leaving their places or talking, the ruin of the country is announced. All portentous tokens of trees take effect in ten months.\n\n31. After putting an umbrella upon the tree, worshipping it with garlands, perfumes, incense, and cloth, and propitiating him, the priest has to mutter the prayer to the Rudras that commence with \"Rudrebhyah,\" at the same time performing the sacrifice divided into six parts.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Reading and translation are equally uncertain.

The king has to treat the Brahmans with milk-porridge, honey, and ghee. The reward to be bestowed consists of land, agreeably to the rule laid down by the eminent Seers in reference to portents shown by trees.\n\n33. Two or three lotuses, barley-ears, and such-like, growing on one stalk, presage the death of the owner. The same is true of a germinated blossom or fruit.\n\n34. Excessive growth of corn, and generic difference of fruits and blossoms on one tree, intimate with certainty a hostile inroad.\n\n35. When sesamums yield only half the usual amount of oil, or no oil at all, and when food loses its flavour, then you may be sure an extreme danger is impending.\n\n36. A portentous blossom or fruit must be removed from the village or town. At such an emergency a cooked oblation is to be offered to Soma, or a victim killed, for expiation.\n\n37. On seeing unnatural signs in corn, the owner should first bestow the field where it grows to the Brahmans, and then bring, in the midst of it, a boiled oblation to Earth. By so doing one shall suffer no injury.\n\n38. Want of rain causes death; too much rain gives rise to danger of famine and foreign invasion; rain in the wrong season produces illness; and rain by a cloudless sky forebodes death to the king.\n\n39. From an irregular change of heat and cold, and from a disordered progress of the seasons, ensues after six months unsafety to the realm, as well as horrible diseases engendered by (the wrath of) Fate.\n\n40. A continual rain during a week, and that out of season, is followed by the death of the sovereign; a blood rain produces war; a rain of flesh, bones, fat, and such like, produces pestilence.\n\n41. You may hold danger to result from a rain of grain, gold, barks, fruits, flowers, and the like. A town where it rains charcoal and dust is going to perdition.\n\n42. A rain of stones from a cloudless sky, or of monsters, or a (sudden) break in the midst of excessive rain, engenders manifold calamities to the grains.\n43. [From a rain of milk, ghee, wax, curds, blood, and hot water,\\(^1\\) may be prophesied the ruin of the country; and from blood rain, strife between princes.]\n\n44. When no shadow is seen by bright sunshine, or the shadow is seen inverted, one may announce a very great peril to be near.\n\n45. When by day or night, in east or west, is seen a rainbow in a cloudless sky, there is great apprehension of famine.\n\n46. It is said that at the time of a portentous rain, the Sun, Moon, the Rain-god and Wind do co-operate. Donations of corn, food, and cows ought (in such cases) to be made, by which the evil is assuaged.\n\n47. The receding of rivers from a town, and the drying up of never shallow rivers or other waters, like deep lakes, etc., produces desolation within a short time.\n\n48. Rivers that carry fat, blood, or flesh, that are troubled, filthy, or run backwards, presage the approach, six months hence, of a hostile army.\n\n49. Blazing, smoking, boiling, as well as weeping, shrieking, singing, and talking of wells, are said to produce mortality among the people.\n\n50. The springing up of water without previous digging, any change in the water's smell and taste, or any portent in reservoirs, denotes great danger. At such an emergency the manner of expiation is as follows.\n\n51. In case of water showing unnatural symptoms, Varuna is to be worshipped with muttering of prayers addressed to him. By such means the evil is allayed.\n\n52. When women bring forth monstrosities, or two, three, four, and more children at a time, and long before or after the usual period, ruin befalls the family or the country at large.\n\n53. Mares, camels, buffaloes, cows, and elephants perish by giving birth to twins. The effects of portentous births appear in six months. Anent the expiation has Garga delivered the following stanzas:\n\n54. \"If a man is anxious of his own weal, he must\n\n\\(^1\\) The r. vari\u1e63\u0101\u1e41 is certainly wrong; it should be changed into v\u0101ri\u1e47o.\nleave those women in a stranger's territory, satisfy the Brahmins by fulfilling their wants, and cause expiatory ceremonies appropriate to the occasion to be performed by them.\n\n55. \"Quadrupeds ought to be dismissed from their flocks (and brought) to foreign grounds. Else they will prove fatal to the town, their owner, and flock.\"\n\n56. Quadrupeds covering animals of totally different kind, cows leaping upon one another, and a dog sucking a calf, these are bad signs.\n\n57. On such an emergency you may know for certain that in three months a hostile inroad shall occur. To avert it, Garga has taught the two stanzas that follow:\n\n58. \"Parting with the animal, banishing or giving it away, that will speedily expiate (the portent). At the same time (the owner) must treat the Brahmins, and bid them perform muttered prayers by way of sacrifice.\n\n59. \"The court priest offers a cooked oblation and a victim to the Creator, with a prayer to the god, while food and fees in plenty are distributed.\"\n\n60. When a carriage without the drawing animal moves on, and one being drawn does not, or when the wheels stick or give way on the road, then the kingdom is threatened.\n\n61. When musical instruments sound without being struck, and give no sound at all when struck, or a wrong note, the foe is approaching or the king about to die.\n\n62. Tunes of song and sounds of musical instruments in the sky, as well as unnatural transformations of movable and fixed objects, presage death or diseases; a jarring instrument announces defeat at the hands of the enemy.\n\n63. Where ox and plough get entangled, where spoons, winnowing baskets and other implements show portentous tokens, and where jackals are hooting, there is danger from the sword. The Sage's advice (with regard to the aforementioned portents) runs thus:\n\n64. \"These aerial portents producing themselves, the monarch ought to honour the God of Air with fried flower,\"\nand bid the Brahmans to devoutly mutter the five verses beginning with '\u00c1 v\u0101yo.'\u00b9\n\n65. \"He is to honour the Brahmans with milk, food, and guerdons. They must likewise carefully perform sacrifices to the Fire, the reward for which consists in plenty of food and fees.\"\n\n66, 67. Town birds roaming in the forest and wild birds entering the town without marks of fear; day birds roaming by night and nocturnal ones by day; wild beasts or birds forming circles at dawn and twilight, or shrieking with one accord in a blasted quarter: all these bring danger.\n\n68, 69. Threatening also are dogs wailing, as it were, at the door; jackals yelling in vexed condition; a dove or owl penetrating into a palace; a cock crowing at eve; the kokila warbling early in winter; hawks and the like moving in the sky in gyrations from right to left.\n\n70. Assemblies of many birds on dwellings, holy trees, triumphal arches and gates, as well as their coming up from beehives, ant-hills, and lotuses, are forebodings of ruin.\n\n71. Dogs carrying limbs of dead bodies and bones into a room, intimate pestilence. Cattle or swords, when uttering words, announce the king's death. The Sage says:\n\n72, 73. \"When wild beasts and birds show unnatural signs, one should make sacrifices to Fire, and give sacrificial fees. Five Brahmans should mutter the prayer, 'Dev\u0101h kapota,'\u00b2 etc., and one Brahman the prayer 'Su dev\u0101,'\u00b3 etc. Or they may use the augural song for a prayer, and the headings of the Atharva-veda.\u2074 The reward to be given to the priests consists of cows.\"\n\n\u00b9 Rgveda 7, 92. Instead of \u0935\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0924\u093f the author may have written \u0935\u093e\u092f\u094b \u0930\u0924\u093f, as the rules of Sandhi are not always observed before iti. Yet \u0935\u093e\u092f\u094b\u0930\u093f\u0924\u093f would be preferable.\n\n\u00b2 Rgveda 10, 165.\n\n\u00b3 V\u0101lakhilya 6, 4.\n\n\u2074 Utpala considers manoveda\u00e7irdnsi to be a Dvandva: \u092e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0947\u0935\u093e\u091a\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0928\u094d\u0938\u093f\u0964 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0938\u093f \u0936\u0930\u094d\u092e\u094d\u092d\u093f\u0930\u0903\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u0942\u0924\u0940\u0928\u093f. But such a mantra would needs\n74. The falling down and breaking of Indra's standard, of door-bolts, columns, gates, door-leaves, arches, and ensigns, foreshows the king's death.\n\n75. A strong glare at dawn and twilight, the appearance in woods of smoke without fire, the splitting of the earth without chasms being visible, and her trembling, give rise to apprehension.\n\n76. The country where the sovereign is attached to heretics and atheists, immoral, irascible, envious, cruel, and bent on making wars, that country comes to ruin.\n\n77. Where little boys, with weapons, sticks and stones in their hands, are fighting and uttering such cries as \"Strike! strike! cut! pierce!\" there also is danger impending.\u00b9\n\n78. A dwelling where with charcoal, red chalk, and the like, are drawn figures of monsters and ghosts, or which is painted over by hobgoblins,\u00b2 such a dwelling soon comes to perdition.\n\n79. That house too meets ruin which is motley with cobwebs, not honoured at morn and evening, filled with quarrels, and where the housewife is always sluttish.\n\n80. When goblins show themselves, you may predict pestilence to be near at hand. For averting these evil tokens, Garga has prescribed the following expiation:\u2014\n\n81. \"The best expiations, in such a case, are oblations of fruits, etc., and treats on a grand scale, which the king should require some defining word. Manoveda must be a Tatpurusha, and as manah = manu, is \"a spell,\" and in so far synonymous with brahman, and as the Atharvaveda is also called brahmaveda, we may conclude that manoveda is one of the designations of that Veda.\n\n\u00b9 Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u0903:\n\n\u092f\u0926\u093f \u0927\u0941\u0930\u0938\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0939\u094d\u0932\u094b\u0937\u094d\u091f\u094d\u0935\u093e: \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0947 \u091a\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0924\u0928\u094b \u0930\u0925\u0924\u0938\u092e\u093e\u091a\u0930\u0928\u093f\u0964\n\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935 \u092c\u0939\u0940\u0916\u0941\u0921\u093e\u0939\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0935\u094b \u092d\u092f\u0947 \u0928\u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u0924\u0941\u092e\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0923\u093f \u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0928\u093f\u0965\n\n\u00b2 All MSS. have ndyaka, which the Comm. explains to be grhasv\u0101mi. As the passage, so interpreted, is unintelligible, I suppose that the word ndyaka is to be taken in the acceptation of vindyaka, although I am unable to adduce any other example of the word being thus used.\norder, at the same time worshipping Indra with metrical prayers addressed to the god.\u201d\n\n82. The appearance of portents at the time a monarch or realm is destroyed, at the rise of a comet, and at an eclipse of sun or moon, as well as their appearance in the proper season, has no injurious effects.\n\n83. Those phenomena that, as being natural effects of the season, produce no mischief, may be known from the ensuing concise verses of Rshiputra\u2019s:\n\n84, 85. \u201cLightning, thunderbolts, earthquakes, gleaming of morning and evening, squalls of whirlwind, haloes, settings and risings of the sun darkened by haze or vapour, the trees bearing food, juice, oil, numerous flowers and fruits, increase of rut with bulls and birds, are favourable tokens in the two months of spring.\u201d\n\n86, 87. \u201cIn summer you may presage good on seeing the rivers dry up and the sky rosy at dawn and twilight, and boisterous like a sea, or covered with a blaze not proceeding from fire, with explosions, vapour, dust, and wind. The sky may also appear stained by falling stars and meteors, and the orb of Sun and Moon in it shine tawny.\u201d\n\n88, 89. \u201cRainbows, haloes, lightning; sprouting of sear trees; trembling, upheaval, change in appearance, rumbling and splitting of the earth; rising, overflowing, and inundations of lakes, rivers, and water reservoirs; giving way of hills and dwellings: all these are symptoms not dangerous in the rainy season.\u201d\n\n90, 91. \u201cThe sight of celestial nymphs, spirits, gandharvas, celestial chariots and prodigies; the appearance in the heavens of planets, asterisms, and stars by day; strains of song and music in woods and on mountain edges; the luxuriant growth of corn and the decrease of water, are, all of them, said to be favourable in autumn.\u201d\n\n92, 93. \u201cCool breezes, frost, noise of wild deer and birds, the sight of giants, gnomes, and such-like beings, the sound of an inhuman voice, the darkening of the horizon, canopy, woods and mountains owing to haze, and high risings and settings of the sun, are held auspicious in winter.\u201d\n94, 95. \"Fall of snow, abnormal winds, the sight of deformities and prodigies, a sky black like collyrium, streaked yellow with falling stars and meteors; wonderful births from women, cows, goats, horses, wild beasts and birds; strange symptoms on leaves, sprouts, and twigs: all this is auspicious in the dewy season.\"\n\n96. \"All these phenomena produce good in their own season, as being the natural concomitants of the season, but they are most dreadful when appearing out of the season.\"\n\n97. \"What madmen utter in their songs, children in their talk, and women in their chattering, will never go amiss.\"\n\n98. \"Indeed, truthful is that oracular voice; first the goddess of speech walks amongst the gods before she descends to men, and she speaks not unless incited.\"\n\n99. A clever observer of portents, should he be even devoid of astronomical knowledge, will become a renowned man and a favourite of the king. It is this mystery revealed by the Seers, by knowing which a man will be enabled to look into past, present, and future.\n\nChapter XLVII.\n\nMiscellaneous.\n\n1. In the preceding part of this work I have amply mentioned the good and evil influences of celestial and atmospheric phenomena, chiefly when describing the planets' courses, conjunctions, conflicts, roads, etc.\n\n2. \"Hence Var\u0101ha-mihira ought not to treat the same matter again, he professing to be a compendious author;\" thus they will blame him and say: \"Men of science should not give the chapter generally known by the designation of Miscellaneous chapter,\" since it contains a repetition of already mentioned effects.\"\n\n3. But it is the very character of this chapter to repeat what has previously been told, and if I did not write it I should be no less liable to blame.\n\n1 Properly, \"motley as a peacock's tail.\"\n4. All planets, if radiant and moving in the northern paths, bring peace, abundance, and happiness; but the same, by moving in the southern paths, and bereft of radiance; produce famine, robbery, and death.\n\n5. If Venus stands in Magh\u00e2, and Jupiter (at the same time) in Pushya, monarchs will keep peace, and their subjects enjoy happiness, mirth, and health.\n\n6. If the planets, the Sun excepted, oppress K\u1e5bttik\u00e2, Magh\u00e2, Rohin\u00ee, or Jyeshth\u00e2, the western country is visited with distress.\n\n7. If at evening the same are stationed like a flag in the east, there must needs be strife between the sovereigns of the east; and if they are so disposed in midheaven, the middle country is sure to come to grief. These effects, however, only take place in case the planets are coarse, not if they are bright and radiant.\n\n8. By the planets occupying the southern quarters, the rain-clouds in the Dekkhan get dispersed. War results from their showing small and coarse, but peace is augured from their appearing bulky and radiant.\n\n9. By beaming brightly, while standing in the northern road, they bring bliss to the kings in that quarter; by looking small and ashy-hued, they will harm countries and princes in that direction.\n\n10. When the stars of the lunar mansions and planets are wrapped in smoke, flame, and sparks, or remain invisible without assignable cause, the whole land and its ruler will come to destruction.\n\n11.

A comet by coming in contact with the Seven Seers, Abhijit, the Polestar, and Jyeshth\u00e2, destroys the rain-clouds, is injurious to good actions, and brings sorrow.

When a comet repeatedly appears or moves through the whole of the asterisms, then shall the world, movable and immovable, taste the bitter fruits of actions in a former existence:\n\n16. By showing the shape of a bow, and by being rough and blood-coloured, the Moon threatens famine, announces the moving on of armies, and victory on the side the string of the bow is turned to. When her cusps are turned downwards, she is fatal to kine, and gives rise to the loss of the crops. By flaming or smoking, she forebodes death to the king.\n\n17. When the Moon is sleek, large, showing equal horns, broad, and standing high northward in the wild elephant\u2019s path,\\(^3\\) when looked at by benign planets, and far removed from the malign ones, she greatly promotes the happiness of mankind.\n\n18.

The cloudy horizontal line that crosses the Sun at rising or setting is termed a \"bar.\" An \"inclosure\" is the same with a mock sun, and an airy staff has the appearance of a straight rainbow.\n\n20. The long beams going up from the Sun at rising or setting are the \"unerring\" beams. A fragmentary straight rainbow is called the \"red line\"; the same, but longer, is termed Airavata.\n\n21. Twilight (of evening) is the time from the Sun's disc having half set upwards to the time when the stars become distinctly visible; and (twilight of morning) is the time from whence the stars begin to fade in lustre until the moment the Sun has half risen.\n\n22. From the aforesaid phenomena at twilight (of morning and evening), one has to foretell good and evil. When all of them appear sleek, there will be instant rain; when coarse, there will be unsafety.\n\n23. Rain is to be expected by an unbroken cloudy bar, a clear sky, darkish or sleek sunbeams, a bright rainbow, lightning in the north-east, or when a tree-shaped cloud is shone upon by the Sun's rays, or when a huge cloud shrouds the setting Sun.\n\n24. In the country where the Sun seems broken off, wry, blackish, small, or marked with the figures of crows or other inauspicious animals, and coarse, in that country it is almost certain that the ruler is undone.\n\n25. He whose army is followed by troops of carnivorous birds when he is about to do battle, shall suffer a heavy defeat; but if the birds are in advance, he shall triumph.\n\n26. When at sunrise or sunset a Fata morgana in the shape of an army obstructs the solar orb, then you may predict that battle and peril draw near to the king.\n\n27. A softly gleaming twilight, joined to a soft breeze and the noise of unmolested birds and wild beasts, is lucky; one that is obscured by dust, is lacking lustre, or shows a tinge like blood, causes the ruin of the country.\n\n1 Cf. ch. xxx. 25. 2 Cf. ch. xxx. 16. 3 Cf. ch. xxx. 11.\n4 Cf. ch. xxviii. 16. 5 Cf. ch. xxx. 8.\n28.

The ruler is to the people what the root is to the tree.

Now learn the propitiating ceremony, such as it has been revealed by the Creator for Indra's sake to the teacher of the gods (B\u1e5bhaspati), and handed down by the latter to V\u1e5bddha-Garga, who delivered it to Bh\u0101guri.\u00b9\n\n3.

The rest are treated with vari-coloured oblations. As tokens of worship to all of them in general must be laid down amulet strings, raiments, flags, ornaments, and sacrificial strings.\n\n34, 35. The priest then proceeds to kindle fire on the sacrificial eminence, either on the western or southern side of the circle, and bring up the ingredients, viz., long sprigs of D\u016bb-grass not yet in the bud, fried grains, ghee, whole barleycorns, curds, honey, white mustard seeds, perfumes, flowers, incense, orpiment, collyrium, sesamum, and sweet fruits of the season.\n\n36.

The skin is to be laid so that the neck is turned to the east.\n\n44. \"Thereupon is put a red, unimpaired skin of a fighting bull; then, thirdly, a lion's skin, and thereon a tiger's.\n\n45. \"These four skins should be spread out on the sacrificial eminence when the moon is in conjunction with the asterism of Pushya, and at a lucky hour.\"\n\n46. Upon the skins is to be placed a throne wrought of gold, silver, or copper, or made from the wood of such trees as yield a milky juice.\n\n47. The seat is raised a cubit, or one cubit and a quarter, or one and a half, the first bringing luck to governors of provinces, the second to those princes who aspire to conquer their neighbours, and the third to those who wish to lord it over a whole empire.\n\n48, 49. The king shall lay a piece of gold on the stool, and then take his seat, cheerful, surrounded by his ministers, intimates, priest, astrologer, burgesses, and persons of an auspicious name, while the solemn acclamations sent forth by bards, citizens, and Brahmans, and the festive sounds of tabors, horns, and musical instruments, quell all evil.\n\n1 St. 42 contains a superfluous repetition of the three preceding; yet the author may have found the stanza in his copy of Garga's work.\n\n2 The Comm. adduces as examples: Jayarat\u00e2ja, Sinhar\u00e2t\u00e2ja, Bandhur\u00e2t\u00e2ja, Vy\u00e2ghrar\u00e2t\u00e2ja.\n50. The court priest now wraps the king, who wears a new linen garment, in a woollen blanket, and after making a libation, pours over him the contents of the jars filled with ghee.\\(^1\\)\n\n51. The number of jars may be eight, or twenty-eight, or a hundred and eight; the greater the number the greater the efficacy. The prayer to be recited on the occasion, composed by the Seer (Vrddha-Garga), here follows:\n\n52, 53. \u201cThis glossy liquid is identified with splendour; this is the best expeller of ill; this is the food of gods; on it the worlds are founded. Whatever evil, earthly, atmospheric or celestial, has reached thee, may it all come to nought by contact with the shining liquid!\u201d\n\n54. Then, taking off the woollen blanket, he sprinkles the king with the water destined for the rite, mixed with fruits and flowers, and recites this prayer:\n\n55\u201370. \u201cMay the gods sprinkle thee, and the Blessed from all eternity, Brahma, Vishnu, \u00c7iva, the S\u0101dhyas, the hosts of Maruts, the sons of Aditi, Vasus, Rudras, the healing Agyins, Aditi the Mother of Gods, Benediction, Perfection, Eloquence, Glory, Fortune, Firmness, Magnificence, Sinivali, Kuhu, Danu, Surasa, Vinata, and Kadru. So, too, may the other Goddesses not named, the Mothers of Gods, and the heavenly crowds of Nymphs sprinkle thee, all together. The Lunar Asterisms, Hours, Halfmonths, Days, Chief Day Periods, Years, Regents of the Days, Minutes, Seconds, Moments, Bits,\u2014these, and other divisions of Time, may they graciously sprinkle thee. The Vaimanikas, the celestial Legions, Manus, Oceans, the Seven Seers with Arundhati, the Fixed Places,\\(^2\\) Marici, Atri, Pulaha, Pulasty, Kratu, Angiras, Bhrgu, Sanatkumara, Sanaka and son,\\(^3\\) Sanatana, Daksha, Jaigishavya, Bhalandana,\\(^4\\) Ekata, Dvita, Trita,\n\n---\n\n1 In so much does the ceremony more resemble an anointment than a washing.\n\n2 Amongst them the Pole-star.\n\n3 Or Sanandana as noun proper.\n\n4 Cf. the Var. rr.\nJ\u0101v\u0101li, Ka\u00e7yapa, Durv\u0101sas, Durvi\u00f1ita, Ka\u00f1va, K\u0101ty\u0101yana, M\u0101rkandeya, Dirghatapas, \u00c7una\u00e7\u00e7epa, Vid\u00fbratha, \u00dbrva, Samvartaka, Cyavana, Atri, Par\u0101\u00e7ara, Dvaip\u0101yana, Yavakr\u012bta, Devar\u0101ja, and his younger brother,\u2014these, and other Seers intent on wisdom and holiness, rich in purity, may they sprinkle thee, along with their pupils and wives. The Mountains, Trees, Creepers, holy Shrines, the blessed Rivers, the Snakes, Elves, blessed Vaikh\u0101nasas, Vaih\u0101yasas, the Father of Creatures, Diti, the Kine who are the Mothers of the Universe, the heavenly Chariots, all the Worlds, changeable and unchangeable, the Fires, Ancestors, Stars, Clouds, Sky, Regions, Waters,\u2014these, and many others whose names are hallowed, may they graciously consecrate thee with water that destroys all evil omens, and bestow on thee hail, long life, and health!\"\n\n71. These are the verses recited, as well as others prescribed in the ritual of the Atharva-veda, and the prayers called Rudraga\u1e47a, K\u016bshm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, Mah\u0101rauhina, Kubera\u1e25rdaya (or Kubera\u1e25rdya), and Sam\u1e5bddhi.\n\n72. The washing finished, the king has to put on a brace of cotton garments, over which have been muttered (by way of benediction) the three verses beginning with \u0100po hi \u015b\u1e6dh\u0101, and the four commencing with Hiranyavarn\u0101h.\n\n73. The monarch, after taking water and honouring the deities, his gurus and the Brahmans, and also the royal umbrella, standard, and weapons, amidst jubilations and blowing of horns, proceeds to do his personal devotion.\n\n---\n\n1 Comm. \u090f\u0915\u093e\u0926\u0936\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u091a\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0903 \u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0923\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0903\u0964 \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0942\u0922\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0928 \u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u0915\u0941\u092c\u0947\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u0930\u094d\u0926\u092f\u0947\u0928 \u0938\u092e\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e \u091a\u0930\u094d\u091a\u0940\u0965 About the six Anuv\u0101ka verses termed K\u016bshm\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da, cf.

What rca\u015b are called Kubera\u1e25rdaya and Sam\u1e5bddhi is unknown to me.\n\n2 Atharva-veda 1, 5, 1, sqq., and 1, 33, 1, sqq. It may be remarked that the former mantra has in our editions of the A.V. not three but four verses. An inaccuracy of the author's is that he indicates hirap-yavarna, instead of hiranyavarn\u0101h.\n\n3 Comm. \u0936\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923\u0902, i.e. commending himself to the protection of his guardian deity.\n74. He puts on his new triumphal apparel, which has been consecrated with the three verses: \u0100yushyam varcasyam r\u0101ya\u015bposham, etc.\u00b9\n\n75, 76. He now goes to the other sacrificial eminence, and seats himself upon skins, which must be spread out, one above the other, in this order: 1st, a bull\u2019s skin; 2nd, a cat\u2019s; 3rd, an antelope\u2019s; 4th, a porcine deer\u2019s; 5th, a lion\u2019s skin; and 6th, a tiger\u2019s.\n\n77. The court priest presents on the principal place an offering to Fire, made up of fuel, sesamum, ghee, etc., at the same time addressing prayers to Rudra, Indra, B\u1e5bhaspati, Vishnu, and the Wind.\n\n78. The astrologer expounds the foretokens of the fire, in the manner indicated in the chapter on Indra\u2019s banner. All being finished, the court priest, joining his hands in supplication, says:\n\n79. \u201cAll the multitudes of divine beings, now that they have received worship at the hands of the king, and bestowed on him unbounded success, may they depart to return another time!\u201d\n\n80. The monarch then honours the astrologer and court priest with many gifts; farther, such other persons as can claim rewards, Brahmans skilled in the ceremonial, and others, according to their deserts.\n\n81. He must issue an amnesty to his people, relieve the victims in the slaughter places, and free the prisoners excepting those guilty of high treason.\n\n82. A repeated performance of this ceremony at the time of the Moon\u2019s conjunction with Pushya makes pleasure, renown and wealth increase. When the same propitiating rite is performed at any other conjuncture, it will, according to ancient authorities, yield but half the (desired) results.\n\n83. \u201cThe auspicious washing ceremony may be performed at a time when evil portents and calamities are afflicting the realm, at the time of eclipses, the appearing of a comet, and a planetary conflict.\n\n\u00b9 V\u0101jasaneyi-S. 24, 50-52.\n84. \"There is no portent on earth that cannot be assuaged by it, and there is no solemnity that can excel it.\n\n85. \"This rite is very salutary at the king's inauguration, and also when he aspires to the rank of an emperor, or when he is longing for the birth of a son.\n\n86. \"It was for the sake of mighty Indra that B\u1e5bhaspati, of world-wide fame, taught this extraordinary washing, which is conducive to long life, increase of progeny and popularity.\n\n87. \"He who in the same manner causes his horses and elephants to be washed, shall see those parts of his forces free from disease and attaining the highest efficiency.\"\n\n---\n\n**CHAPTER XLIX.**\n\n*Signs of Gold Diadems.*\n\n1. The lucky and unlucky signs of gold diadems that have been amply described by the Masters, are here enumerated by me, and that completely, though in a succinct manner.\n\n2. The diadem of a king must, to be auspicious, have an expansion of eight digits in the middle; a queen's should, according to prescription, be seven digits; and a prince royal's, six.\n\n3. The diadem of a commander of the troops has an expansion of four digits in the middle, and a diadem bestowed by way of royal favour two. These are the five kinds of diadems known.\n\n4. All have a length double of the expansion, whereas the expansion on both sides is half that of the middle. All should be wrought from pure gold for the sake of increasing bliss.\n\n5. A royal diadem has five crests; a prince royal's, or\n\n---\n\n1 Cf. Kath\u0101sarit-S\u0101gara, ix. 54, 233:\n\n\u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0924\u094d \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0902 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0947 \u0935\u0940\u0930\u0926\u0947\u0935\u092c\u0932\u0940 \u091a \u0938\u0903\u0964\n\u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0936\u093e\u092a\u0924\u093f \u092a\u0926\u0941\u0903 \u092c\u091c\u094d\u0930\u093e \u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0915\u0903\u0965\nqueen's, has three. A chief commander's diadem has one crest; a diadem bestowed as a mark of royal favour has none.\n\n6. When the gold plate for the diadem in being wrought easily expands, it bodes success and victory to the king, and happiness to the people.\n\n7. A flaw in the middle produces loss of life and kingdom. A diadem having a split in the middle must be cast away; one that shows a burst on the sides, gives trouble.\n\n8. At the appearance of evil tokens, the diviner has to prescribe an expiation for the king. A diadem with auspicious signs is conducive to the weal of king and land.\n\nChapter L.\n\nSigns of Swords.\n\n1. A sword of the longest description measures fifty digits; the shortest is of twenty-five digits. A flaw on such a spot (of the sword) as corresponds with an odd number of digits, must be deemed ill-ominous.\n\n2. Yet flaws resembling a Bilva-fruit, Vardham\u0101na-figure, umbrella, emblem of \u0100iva, earring, lotus, banner, weapon, or cross, are held auspicious.\n\n3. Flaws shaped like a lizard, crow, heron, carrion bird, headless trunk or scorpion, and several flaws along the upper edge, are not lucky.\n\n4. A sword that shows a chink, is too short, blunt, damaged at the upper edge, unpleasing to eye and mind, and without tone, is inauspicious. The reverse qualities forebode favourable results.\n\n5. The rattling of a sword (of itself) is said to portend death; its not going out of the sheath (when drawn) augurs defeat. There will be strife when the sword jumps out of the scabbard by itself, but victory when it is seen flaming.\n\n6. The king ought not to unsheathe it without reason, nor rub it, nor look at his own face in it, nor tell its price. He\n\n1 In the text we should read \u092a\u0930\u092c\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092f\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0928\u0947, as the Comm. has it.\nshould not mention the place whence it has come from, nor take its measure, nor, without precaution, touch the blade.\\footnote{Cf. the passage from Par\u0101\u00e7ara as quoted in the foot-note on st. 24.}\n\n7. The most esteemed swords are those that are fashioned like a cow's tongue, a lotus-petal, a bambu-leaf, an oleander-leaf, rapiers and scimitars.\n\n8. If a wrought sword proves too long, it may not be shortened by striking off a portion of it, but should be polished till it has the length required. The owner dies if a piece is struck off at the upper end, and his mother dies if the same is done at the point.\n\n9. From a flaw on the hilt you may infer the existence of a corresponding flaw on the blade, just as you may conclude on seeing a mole in the face of a damsel, that there is another such in her hidden parts.\n\n10. And by observing which part of the body is touched by a swordsman, when consulting the diviner, the latter will be able to indicate the place of the flaw on the sword in the scabbard, provided he (the diviner) knows the following rules.\n\n11\u201315. If the man touches his head, the flaw is at the first digit; the second digit corresponds with the forehead; the third with the spot between the brows; the fourth with the eyes; the fifth with the nose; the sixth with the lips; the seventh with the cheeks; the eighth with the jaws; the ninth with the ears; the tenth with the neck; the eleventh with the shoulders; the twelfth with the breast; the thirteenth with the armpits; the fourteenth with the paps; the fifteenth with the heart; the sixteenth with the belly; the seventeenth with the loins; the eighteenth with the navel; the nineteenth with the abdomen; the twentieth with the hip; the twenty-first with the pudendum; the twenty-second with the thighs; the twenty-fourth with the knees; the twenty-fifth with the legs; the twenty-sixth with the part between the legs; the twenty-seventh with the ankles; the twenty-eighth with the heels; the twenty-ninth with the feet; the thirtieth with the toes: such is the theory of Garga.\n16\u201319. The consequences to be foretold from a flaw in the first, second, third digit, and so forth, up to the thirtieth digit, are as follows: death of a child, obtaining of wealth, loss of riches, good fortune, captivity, birth of a son, quarrels, acquiring of elephants, death of a child, acquiring of wealth, destruction, getting a wife, grief, gain, loss, getting a wife, death, prosperity, death, contentment, loss of wealth, acquiring of riches, death without salvation, obtaining of wealth, death, good fortune, poverty, dominion, death, kingly power.\n\n20. Upwards of the thirtieth digit no consequences are specified; in general, however, the flaws at the odd digits are injurious, at the even ones auspicious. But according to some authorities, the flaws from the thirtieth digit upwards to the sword\u2019s point are of no consequence at all.\n\n21. A sword that smells like oleander, blue lotus, elephant\u2019s frontal juice, ghee, saffron, jessamine, or Michelia champaka, brings good luck; but ill-omened is one that has the odour of cow urine, mud, or fat.\n\n22. A smell similar to that of tortoise blubber, blood, or potash, augurs danger and pain. A sword glittering like beryl, gold, and lightning, brings victory, health, and prosperity.\n\n23. The fluid to imbrue a sword with, according to the precept of U\u00e7anas, is: blood, if one wishes for a splendid fortune; ghee, if one is desirous to have a virtuous son; water, if one is longing for inexhaustible wealth.\n\n24. An approved mixture to imbrue the sword with, in case of one desirous to attain his object by wicked means, is: milk from a mare, a camel, and elephant. A mixture of fish bile, deer-milk, horse-milk, and goat-milk, blended with toddy, will make the sword fit to cut an elephant\u2019s trunk.\n\n---\n\n1 The Comm. has anirv\u0101\u1e47i, and explains it by m\u1e5btyu.\n\n2 Comm. t\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i p\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e25:\n\n\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935 \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u0940\u0930\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0903 \u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0924\u094d \u0924\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0924\u0940\u0932\u093e\u0930\u0923\u093e-\n\u0938\u093e\u092e\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0915\u0947\u0928\u0964 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a\u092f\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0915\u093e\u092e\u0903\u0964 \u0938\u093e\u0939\u0938\u093f\u0915\u0903 \u0917\u094b\u092a\u093f\u0924\u0947\u0928\u0964\n\u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u092d\u0940\u0930\u0903 \u0936\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u092e\u094b\u0903 \u0906\u091a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092f \u0924\u093e\u0932\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u094b\u092e\u0947\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0925\u093e-\n\u0935\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0923\u094d\u092f\u092a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094d\u092f\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092e\u094b \u0928\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0917\u0928\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0915\u0941\u092a\u0939\u0964\n25.

An iron instrument imbrued with a stale mixture of potash of plantains with buttermilk, and properly whetted, will not get crooked on a stone, nor blunted on other iron instruments.\n\nChapter LI.\n\nArt of Soothsaying.\u00b9\n\n1. The soothsayer must tell a consulting person's fortune by observing the latter's direction, utterances, place, what the same is taking into his hand, and which limb of his own or another's he is touching; conjointly with this the diviner should intelligently consider the time being. For Time, comprehending all that is movable and immovable, is all-knowing, all-seeing, and all-present, and shows to all who need it, the good and evil consequences through means of bodily motions and utterances.\u00b2\n\n2. The place (of consultation) is favourable if it is level, covered with good grass, pleasing in the limpidity of its sweet water, covered with beautiful flowers or corn, frequented by Gods, Seers, Brahmans, virtuous men, and Blessed\n\n\u00b9 This chapter is probably spurious; see the remarks of the Comm. quoted in the Var. rr.\n\n\u00b2 The passage in Par\u0101\u00e7ara which has obviously served as the model, runs thus: \n\nThis text is not in English and appears to be a translation of Sanskrit text.\n(inhabitants of Heaven), and if it is shadowed by trees of auspicious appellation, charming in their bloom, loaded with many fruits, possessed of sleek barks and leaves, and not occupied by ill-omened birds.\\(^1\\)\n\n3. Not good is a place abounding with such trees as are cut, split, perforated by insects, thorny, scorched, rough, crooked, bearing unseemly \\(^2\\) names, inhabited by ill-ominous birds, and covered with sear and withered leaves and barks.\n\n4. Unfavourable also are: a cemetery, desolate shrine, crossway, a dismal rugged spot, an always brackish ground, a spot covered with sweepings, charcoal, potsherds, ashes, husks, or dry grass.\n\n5. Bad is, besides, any place, when occupied by monks, naked friars, barbers, enemies, shackles, butchers, outcasts, gamblers, ascetics, or persons in distress; moreover, any place where weapons or spirits are being sold.\\(^3\\)\n\n6. East, north, and north-east are the directions \\(^4\\) of good augury to the consulting person; not so north-west, west, south, south-east and south-west. The favourable time is forenoon, not night, nor dawn, nor twilight, nor afternoon.\\(^5\\)\n\n7.

The masculine limbs are: thigh, lip, pap, testicle, foot, tooth, arm, hand, cheek, hair, throat, nail, thumb, temple, armpit, shoulder, ear, anus, and joint. Feminine are: brow, nose, buttock, wrinkles, hip, line of felicity in the palm, finger, tongue, neck, instep, ankle, leg, navel, margin of the ear, and hindpart of the neck. Neuter are: mouth, back, collarbone, knee, bone, side, heart, palate, eye, penis, breast, end of the spine, head and forehead. Touching of a limb of the first description, foreshows speedy results; touching of one of the second kind, denotes slow results; the touching of neuter limbs produces no effects whatever; nor do the other two, if they happen to be coarse, impaired, broken, or lean.\n\n11. When the querist touches or moves his great toe, he is to suffer from eyesore; when he touches or moves a finger, one may announce sorrow on account of his daughter; when he strikes his head, there threatens danger from the king.\n\n12. His touching the breast, presages separation; his taking off a piece of cloth from his body, denotes loss; when he pulls a piece of cloth closer to him, and joins foot to foot, he will get friends.\n\n13. When he scratches the earth with his great toe, he is thinking of land; when he scratches his feet with the hand, his thoughts are fixed on a female slave.\n\n14. If the man looks at a t\u0101l- or birch-leaf, he is thinking of muslin; if he is standing on glass, husks, bone, or sahas, sickness is soon to befall him; if he gazes on a string, net, or bark, captivity awaits him.\n\n15, 16. Should he mention or see long pepper, black pepper, ginger, cyperus grass, lodh, costus, cloth, andropogon, cumin, spikenard, anise, and Tabern\u00e6montana, one may foretell that his thoughts are engaged on the following subjects, severally: a wife's fault, a man's fault, a person in distress, loss of all,\n\n\u00b9 i.e. denoted by words of masculine gender.\nmissing of the road, loss of a child, of wealth, of grain, of a child, of bipeds, of quadrupeds, of land.\n\n17. From his keeping in the hand a fruit of the Indian figtree, of Bassia, ebony-tree, roseapple, waved-leaved figtree, mango, and jujube, it may be predicted that he is to acquire wealth, gold, men, iron, muslin, silver, and copper.\n\n18. The sight of a dish filled with grain and a full water-pot, augurs the thriving of the family; excrements of an elephant, cow, or dog, denote the loss of wealth, women, or friends (severally).\n\n19. On seeing cattle, an elephant, buffalo, lotus blossom, silver, or a tiger, the querist is destined to get a multitude of sheep, riches, garments, sandal, silk, or ornaments (successively).\n\n20. When a fortune-teller is consulted by persons in the sight of a skull-wearing \u0100\u015baiva monk, they do so for the sake of friends or gambling; when in the sight of a friar of a decent order, their query concerns a courtesan, king, or wife in childbed.\n\n21. The consultation being held in the sight of a Buddhist monk, a teacher, a Jaina monk, a naked mendicant friar, a diviner, a pedlar, a fisher, it concerns a thief, a commander of the troops, a merchant, a female slave, a soldier, a shopkeeper, a condemned criminal.\n\n22. From the sight of an ascetic is to be inferred that the inquirer is thinking of an absent person; he is thinking of cattle tending, if a vendor of liquors is in sight.

Remarkable in this passage is \u090f\u0935 after a compound, as if the component parts were separated.\nsight of one busy with gleaning, you may conclude that mishap has befallen the querist.\n\n23. The man using the expression: \"I should like to ask,\" it denotes him to think of a meeting; the expression \"do, tell!\" shows he is thinking of his household; the words: \"Master! pray, look!\" intimate the man to think of gain; the expression \"do, prophecy!\" shows that he cares for dominion.\n\n24. If he says, \"inform me,\" his thoughts are bent on victory or travelling. Should he say: \"examine, and tell my thoughts,\" then his care concerns a kinsman. If he suddenly rushes upon the diviner, who is standing among a crowd, with the word \"look!\" he is thinking of a thief.\n\n25, 26. By an internal part of the body being touched, a member of the family is indicated to be the thief; by an external part being touched, a stranger is indicated; by a motion of the great toe, a slave is referred to; by the other toes, a female slave; by the legs, a domestic; by the navel, a sister; by the heart, one's own wife; by touching the thumb, a son is denounced; by the fingers, a daughter; by the belly, one's mother; by the head, one's father or uncle; by the right arm, one's brother; by the left arm, a brother's wife.\n\n27, 28. Indications that the inquirer is not destined to recover the property stolen from him, are the following: if, after touching an internal part of the body, he takes to an external one; or if he emits phlegm, urine, excrements; or suffers something to drop from his hands; or vehemently bends and stretches his limbs; or if he descries people carrying empty vessels, or a thief; or if ominous words are heard, such as \"taken, fallen, impaired, forgotten, lost, broken, gone, stolen, dead,\" and the like.\u00b9\n\n29.

When the querist, on sharply touching an internal part of the body, breaks wind upwards, then you may foretell that he is satiated by having copiously dined.\n\n30. From his touching the forehead and from seeing awns, you may infer boiled rice has been his food; from his touching the breast, king's rice; from his touching the neck, a preparation of barley.\n\n31. If he touches his loins, paps, belly, or knees, he is sure to have eaten pease, milk, sesamum, or rice gruel. From his smacking and licking his lips, you may know that he has tasted something sweet.\n\n32. By something loathsome,\\(^1\\) he will stretch his tongue; by something sour, he will make a wry mouth; by something pungent, bitter, tart, or hot, he will hiccough, and by something salt, spit.\n\n33. If he gives up phlegm, it is a sign that he has eaten something dry and bitter, and that in little quantity. The sound or sight of a carnivorous animal is a token of his having enjoyed fleshmeat; if he touches his brows, cheeks, or lips, he has eaten fowl.\n\n34. His touching the head, throat, hair, jaw, temple, ear, leg, abdomen, proves him to have taken elephant's flesh, buffalo's flesh, mutton, pork, beef, hare's flesh, deer's flesh, mixed meat.\n\n35. When an evil augury is seen or heard, you may foretell that he has eaten lizard's flesh and fish. In similar manner may, at the time of consultation, the deliverance of a pregnant woman be prognosticated.\n\n36. Whether a male, female, or androgynous child is to take birth, is foreshown by something masculine, feminine, or neuter being seen, inferred, present, and touched. A happy deliverance is augured from the sight of drink, food, flowers, and fruits.\n\n37.

V.\u2014Notes on Hwen Thsang's Account of the Principalities of Tokh\u0101rist\u0101n, in which some Previous Geographical Identifications are Reconsidered. By Colonel H. Yule, C.B.\n\nRecently engaged in compiling a Map of Badakhsh\u00e1n and the adjoining regions, to illustrate a paper for the Geographical Society, I have naturally been led to consider the interesting geographical details which the Chinese pilgrim Hwen Thsang gives of those countries, as well as the current interpretations of his routes and localities. In several instances those interpretations seem to me open to amendment. The most eminent of Hwen Thsang's geographical illustrators are Major-General Cunningham and M. Vivien de St.-Martin; both of whom have dealt ably with the whole series of the Chinese Traveller's wanderings. If, after the careful study of a small part of these, I venture to differ from both accomplished commentators in regard to some of the identifications which concern that part only, I trust that I shall be guilty of no presumption. Recent documents, in part as yet unpublished, afford advantages for this discussion which were not available to my predecessors.\n\nIn the sketch-map that accompanies these notes I have endeavoured to lay down the limits of the different principalities, where these are not determined by the geographical facts, according to the approximate dimensions stated by Hwen Thsang. The li in which his estimates are reckoned is valued by M. Vivien de St.-Martin at $\\frac{1}{3}$ of an English mile; by General Cunningham, as a practical road-measure, usually at $\\frac{1}{2}$. But the circuit of the different States, as well as the intervals from capital to capital, which are occasionally given, are always stated (at least in this part of Hwen Thsang's Travels) in even hundreds of li. And\nwhose descent on Transoxiana and Bactria about B.C. 126 extinguished the Greek kingdom north of the Indian Caucasus. For the Tochari are mentioned by Strabo as main agents in that overthrow, and are placed by Ptolemy at a later date as a great nation in Bactria. And when we find Hwen Thsang, on his journey homewards, using the same name of Tukh\u00e1ra in connexion (as it would seem) with the original seats of the Yu\u00e9chi beside the Gobi Desert, it shows that he also regarded the Yu\u00e9chi as identical with the race whose predominance on the Oxus had recently been broken by the Turks, viz., the Yetha or Hai\u00e1thalah.\n\nThe name occurs in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rat as that of a northern race; and Lassen, Ritter, and Vivien de St.-Martin concur in assigning these epic Tukh\u00e1ra to the mountains about the sources of Oxus and Jaxartes.\u00b9 I cannot discover what determines this allocation, nor why these Tukh\u00e1ra, for anything that is said of them in Lassen\u2019s quotations, should not be placed further to the east, and identified even then with the race, of supposed Tibetan blood, which bore the name in later days after its migration to the banks of the Oxus.\u00b2 A greater difficulty in the way of this supposition, (viz., that the name always pertained to the Yu\u00e9chi as their Indian title), is the mention of the Tochari seven centuries before our era, in the clay-stamped Annals of Senaccherib, as a mountain-race invaded by that King; the same inscription commemorating an attack upon the Dahae as immediately following.\u00b3 If these readings are certain, it would seem that the true Tochari must for ages before the existence of the Greek Kingdom of Bactria have occupied seats to the westward\n\n\u00b9 Lassen, i., 852; Ritter, vii., 697; V. de St.-Martin in N. Ann. des Voyages for 1849, vol. 3, pp. 26-27. If Ritter were correct in bringing the Tochari or Thogarii (as the name is in Justin) into battle with the Parthians in B.C. 197, this would show them to have been in Transoxiana long before the fall of Greco-Bactria. But Ritter has here (the rarest of all things) made a mistake. The date belongs to the death of Artabanus II., not I., and should be 128, not 197 B.C.\n\n\u00b2 The fact, which Lassen notices, that the Tukhara brought to the Pandava king, among other presents, furs, iron, and silk, the three staples of the Seres, fits surely better to a people on the Khotan Frontier of China than to wild denizens of the buttresses of Pamir. (See Lassen, i., 848.)\n\n\u00b3 Journ. Royal As. Soc., vol. xix., p. 151. The Tokari are also represented from an Egyptian wall-sculpture by Sir G. Wilkinson in Rawlinson\u2019s Herodotus, vol. iv., pp. 45-46.\nof Imans, and the circumstances that transferred the name to the Yetha are not easy to conceive.\n\nAdvancing to the Oxus, the Traveller arrives at (4) Ta-sai, or TAKHARA (Cunningham), one of the subdivisions of Tukhara, which had an extent of 600 li from east to west, and 400 from north to south (six days' journey by four).\n\n(5). On the east it touched upon Chi-jo-yanna, or CHAGHANIAN (Cunningham), corresponding generally to the modern province of Hisar. This extended 400 li in longitude by 300 in latitude (four days by five).\n\n(6). The next kingdom eastward was Holimo, having only one day's journey in breadth from east to west, and three in length from north to south. Cunningham suggests this to be Hamurin (written also Hamudan, Hamdarin, etc.), which in the old Arab geographies is the second stage between Chaghani\u00e1n and Wakhsh; whilst Vivien de St-Martin prefers Hisar Shiduman. Our knowledge of this region remains most vague and scanty, but our maps, on whatever authority, represent Chaghani\u00e1n as considerably east of Hisar, a circumstance opposed to the latter view.\n\nThe form of the territory, narrow in proportion to length, indicates that it is probably a river-valley; and in the position assigned, the river can scarcely be other than the northern Surkh-ab, or Karategin branch of the Oxus. I suspect that the name Holimo represents Garma. Ab-i-Garm is one of the lower districts of Karategin, and Garma is also a name applied to the chief place of that principality. The latter, however, seems to be too distant, unless the three days' length be an under-statement.\n\n(7). The next kingdom eastward is Suman, the Sum\u00e1n or Shuman of the Arab geographies (Cunningham). This kingdom according to Hwen Thsang was 400 li (four days' journey) from east to west, and 100 only from north to south. Towards the S.W. it lay upon the Oxus, and it extended to a kingdom called (8) Kio-ho-yanna, Kuvayana, measuring\n\n---\n\n1 See a recent paper on Karategin from the Russian in the Proceedings of the R. G. S. Meyendorff, however, applies the title of Khan of Ab-i-Garm to the chief of Karategin.\ntwo days' journey by three. This M.V. de St.-Martin takes for Kar\u00e1tegin, but nothing in the translation carries us in that direction, and it may more naturally be identified with Kuv\u00e1di\u00e1n.\n\nShum\u00e1n is placed by the Arabian itineraries 22 farsakhs from Chagh\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1n. I should judge it to have been near, if not identical with, the modern town of Baljiw\u00e1n or Kul\u00e1b.\n\n(9). East of Shum\u00e1n was Husha, extending three days' journey (300 li) from east to west, and five from north to south. This Cunningham, rightly as I think, identifies with Wakhsh. M. de St.-Martin interprets it as Ush in Fargh\u00e1na\u2014a long stride indeed! But the name of the next province seems enough to settle the question.\n\n(10). Khotulo, Khotl or Khotl\u00e1n (Cunningham). This was about 1000 li (ten days' journey) either way. On the east it came in contact with the Thsungling or mountains buttressing Pamir, and extended to No. 11.\n\nAnother ancient notice of Khotl preserved by Matwanlin, and cited by R\u00e9musat and Klapproth, mentions the rock-salt which is still a production of Kul\u00e1b, and calls the capital Sse-tsu-kian or San-tsu-kian (?).\n\n(11). Kiu-mi-tho, Kumidha. This kingdom was some 20 days' journey (2000 li) from east to west, and two days from north to south, lying among the Thsungling mountains. On the S.W. it adjoined the Oxus; on the south it was in contact with the kingdom of Shikhini or Shighn\u00e1n. The state of Kiumi is also mentioned along with Shikhini and Humi (see No. 33) in the historical extracts of Abel R\u00e9musat, as sending tribute to China in the 7th century.\u00b9 Major General Cunningham, though not giving any specific modern identification of this State, most happily connects it with the Comedae of Ptolemy, who inhabited the hill-country east of Bactriana, and up whose valley lay the route of the caravans from Bactra, bound for Serica across Imaus or the Thsungling. The proportions of length and breadth ascribed to the territory of Kiumitho, 20 by 2, show that a valley is in question.\n\n\u00b9 See \"Extension de l'Empire Chinois du cot\u00e9 de l'Occident,\" in Mem. de l'Ac. des Inscr., tom. viii. p. 93.\nThe passage in Ptolemy just alluded to is one of the most notable in regard to the geography of Inner Asia of all that have come down to us from classic times. There can be little doubt that Gen. Cunningham's identification of Khumidha with the Comedae is well founded, and we could scarcely desire a more precise definition of their position than Huen Thsang has here given us. \"They lay to the eastward of Khoti, among the roots of Pamir, to the northward of Shighn\u00e1n, and had the Oxus on their south-west.\" Nor could words more exactly define the position, so far as we know it, of the existing principalities of Darw\u00e1z and Rosh\u00e1n.\n\nThe old Arabian geographers do not mention the state of Darw\u00e1z by that name. But they tell us that four days beyond Washjird there was a place called R\u00e1sht, forming the extreme frontier of Khorasan in that direction. It stood in a narrow valley among the mountains, by which the Turks in ancient days used to come down on their forays. Fadhl the son of Yahya, the Barmecide, towards the end of the second century of Isl\u00e1m, caused a barrier to be constructed on this pass, which long continued to be garrisoned.\u00b9\n\nI suspect that this R\u00e1sht or R\u00e1sit is the place which thus acquired the name of Darw\u00e1z or the Gate. If this be right, then the valley of the Comedae, up which the ancient caravans travelled eastward for silk, the Valley of R\u00e1sht down which the Turks came to plunder in the 8th century, and the Darw\u00e1z of our maps are all identical. Nay, it is possible that in the name of the chief place of modern Darw\u00e1z, Kala' K\u00fcm, we have a surviving trace of the old inhabitants, the Kumidha or Comedae, and that the name R\u00e1sht, if we were certain of its true form, might prove to be identical with Rosh\u00e1n.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 See Ibn Khord\u00e1dbeh in Journ. Asiat., ser. vi., tom. v. p. 270; Edrisi, i., 483; Sprnger, p. 44. Reinaud puts the date about A.D. 794 (M\u00e9m. sur l'Inde, p. 161). He mentions moreover that the barrier was called Al-Beh.\n\n\u00b2 We know nothing of the passes which descend from Pamir to Rosh\u00e1n and Darw\u00e1z except that there are such. It is probable that the Vallis Comedari\u00e6 may be that of the great Oxus tributary from Pamir which joins the Panja at Bartang on the borders of Rosh\u00e1n and Darw\u00e1z. As some perplexity has arisen about Darw\u00e1z from the position assigned to \"Darwazi\" territory in the Itinerary of Abdul Mejid between Kokan and Kul\u00e1b, I may call attention to a passage in\nWe now return to the western part of Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, and to the Traveller's actual route.\n\n(12). On leaving Termedh, and crossing the Oxus, he proceeded to Hwo, which was a principality in the immediate hands of the eldest son of the Khan of the Turks, who was a kind of governor-general over all the petty kingdoms of Tukh\u00e1ra. Hwo is described as a country having a circuit of 3000 li or 30 marches. The territory was level, the vegetation of extraordinary vigour, the climate mild. The mountains of Thsungling terminated on its eastern frontier. In another passage it is stated that Hwo adjoined the Oxus, and that its capital \"stood on the eastern bank of the river.\"\n\nCunningham thinks Hwo is probably Khulm; Vivien de St.-Martin is quite clear that it is Ghori. I agree with the latter that Khulm appears in the Itinerary under another name (see No. 15), but I must differ with him as to the identification of Hwo with Ghori. Both the character ascribed to the country and the position of Hwo in relation to the Oxus and to other principalities preclude this view. To the south-east of Hwo lay Kusito and Antalopo, i.e. Khost and Andar\u00e1b; to the south-west lay Pokialung or Baghl\u00e1n. How is it possible to reconcile these indications with the position of Ghori? Yet they are mutually in perfect consistence, and point as so many compass-bearings to the vicinity of Kunduz.\n\nThe same name that is here given as Hwo appears to be rendered in one of R\u00e9musat's extracts as Ahwan. The place so called was, in the vain-glorious organization of those western regions by the Thang Emperors of China, about A.D. 660, constituted the chief seat of the government of\n\nMr. Wathen's paper on Kokan in vol. iii. of the Journ. Asiat. Soc., Bengal, p. 373. This paper, compiled in 1834 from the information afforded by a Wazir of Kokan, states that on the death of the last prince of Karategin (claiming, like so many others of the old dynasties of Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, to be descended from Alexander), his sons having fought for the succession, the kingdom fell a prey to the Prince of Darw\u00e1z, and was still under his rule. The same authority had given Badakhsh\u00e1n, Karategin, and Darw\u00e1z, as the boundaries of Kokan on the south-east. Putting these things together, it seems easy to account for the continued existence of Darw\u00e1z authority so far north of the Oxus as Abdul Mejid puts it, without the necessity of supposing that there is another Darw\u00e1z besides that on the Oxus.\n\n1 Vie et Voyages de H. T., p. 268. It is there called Kowu (or Kwo).\nTukh\u00e1ra, under the official name of *Yuechi-fu*, with 24 or 26 *ch\u00e9w* under it, which no doubt answered to Hwen Thsang's 27 principalities. But where was it?\n\nKunduz itself does not appear in the older Arab geographies. The place of note nearest to it in those older writers is *Waw\u00e1l\u00edn* or *Waw\u00e1l\u00edn*. Under the latter form the name has been read by Mr. Edward Thomas as that of the Mint-city on several coins of Mahm\u00fad of Ghazni and his successors. Its exact position cannot be assigned, for no modern trace of the name has yet been discovered. But the indication that it lay equidistant between Kuhm and T\u00e1yik\u00e1n (or T\u00e1lk\u00e1n) brings its position within tolerably narrow limits, pointing again to the vicinity of Kunduz.\n\nIt is possible that the first part of the name *Wa-w\u00e1l\u00edn* may be represented by *Hwo*: but however that may be, I have little doubt that *Hwo* stands for the ancient province corresponding to Kunduz, and probably also to Waw\u00e1l\u00edn.\n\nWe have no information indeed that enables us to explain the statement that it stood on the eastern bank of the river, if by that expression the Oxus be meant. But the Oxus has no eastern bank in this vicinity, and if the original language may admit of the word *no* here being indefinite, this might refer to the position of Kunduz on the eastern bank of the Surkh\u00e1n. In all other respects the position of Kunduz answers; the soil is fine, arable, and rank in vegetation; the mountains which rise to the eastward of the plain have no interruption till they sink into the plains of Yarkand; Kh\u00f6st and Andarab lie to the south-east, Ragh\u00e1n to the south-west, and the State described as lying nearly to the north of *Hwo* admits of satisfactory identification.\n\nA3. South-west of *Hwo* was *Pah\u00e1riya*, or *Baghl\u00e1n* (*Pah\u00e1riya*): a small kingdom extending only 200 li or\ntwo marches from north to south, and half a march from east to west; dimensions which (as M. de St.-Martin notices) point to the valley of the (southern) Surkh\u00e1b, in which Baghl\u00e1n stands.\n\n(14). Southward, Baghl\u00e1n touched upon He-lu-si-min-kian, Hrosminkan, which had a circuit of ten days' journey (1000 li). The last part of the name M. de St.-Martin is certainly right in identifying with the Samanj\u00e1n of the Arab geographers, mentioned also in the History of Taimur, and which in Persian legend was the residence of the lady loved by Rustam and the birthplace of her son Sohrab. This we learn from Moorcroft to be identical with Haibak in the valley of the Khulm River.\u00b9 The Helu, or Hro, may probably stand for R\u00fai in the upper part of the same valley, and we shall then have in the entire designation one of those copulate names so popular in Asia, R\u00fai-Samang\u00e1n.\u00b2 This too would account for the southerly direction assigned to the territory in question; for Haibak itself lies nearly due west of Baghl\u00e1n.\n\n(15). Northward of Helu-siminkian was Ho-lin, or Khulm (Vivien de St.-Martin). The circuit was about ten marches (1000 li).\n\n(16). West of Holin was Poho or Poholo, Balkh (Cunningham), the extent of which was eight marches (800 li) from east to west, and four days (400 li) from north to south.\u00b3\n\n(17). To the S.W. of Balkh was Jui-mo-tho, Jumadha, a small State only 50 li by 100, which Cunningham suggests to be Maimunah or Yah\u00fadiah. But Yah\u00fadiah is reckoned by the Geographers to be the chief city of the next State; and can scarcely be described as \"lying among the spurs of the snowy mountains.\" A position somewhere near Sir-i-pul\n\n\u00b9 Travels, ii., 402.\n\u00b2 R\u00fai is mentioned by an early Arabian geographer, Mokaddasi (see Sprenger, p. 37). At least I presume that \u0631\u06cc \u0631\u06cc R\u00e1b, which appears between Samang\u00e1n and Baghl\u00e1n, is an error for \u0631\u06cc \u0631\u06cc R\u00fai.\n\u00b3 In Sprenger's Map, No. 5, after Bir\u00fani, attached to Balkh is the remark, \"The old name is \u0628\u0627\u0628\u06cc.\" If this be Bal\u00ed or B\u0101b\u0101, it might explain the form Poho.\nwere informed of the name of which near Beshen, Ferrier found ruins, antiquities, and inscriptions.\n\n18. Beyond this little State was Ha-ak-han, Hujkhan, Graeco in Georgian T. & St. Moros, of which the capital was Yalikhan. Its extent was five days journey by the days feet, i.e., by 200.\n\n19. N.W. of the last was Ta-ak-han, Yalikhan (Con-\n\nsequens) i.e., the more westerly of the two places on the Khorasan frontier so called. This kingdom extended 500 li by 500 li, or about in the valley of the Marghab. It has recently been supposed that the name of this place is a memorial of the Ha-ak-han or Hyrcanians. During the original Arab conquest of Khurasan it is stated that the Persians and Haikistanis defending themselves at Yalikhan were supported by the Turks and the Sogdianas or Chaghidianas. This illustrates the probable origin of numerous local names on that frontier ending in -kan, as originally gentile places.\n\n20. Returning to Balkh, the Traveller goes about 100 li one day's journey south, and arrives at the hilly and somewhat barren kingdom of Kurram Gashi. This I apprehend to be the Darah or Valley of Gaz. Darah-Gaz will be found in Macartney's Map to Elphinstone, in the Map to Ferrier's Travels, etc., about one march south of Balkh. Ibn Haukal also states that the hill-country south of Balkh is called Gaz. Darah Gaz is mentioned in Timur's Institutes, and it was the scene of a rout of Humayun's little army by the Uzbeks in 1549.\n\nSouth-east of this the Traveller enters a country of lofty and rugged mountains, of frost and snow. Such mountains find no indication on any map known to me, not even on that attached to General Ferrier's journey. Yet that officer, the only modern traveller who has passed athwart the hill-country between the Khulm and Balkh Rivers, describes his crossing, immediately west of Kurram, lofty mountains, the\n\n---\n\n1 Caravan Journeys, pp. 229-230.\n2 See M.

The statement is a little vague, but the height implied can scarcely be less than 11,000 feet.}\n\n(21). After travelling six days (600 li), Hwen Thsang quits Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, and reaches the kingdom of Fanyanna or B\u00e1mian (Landresse). This kingdom extends twenty days' journey from east to west, and three from north to south (2000 li and 300 li), the latter estimate being probably from Saigh\u00e1n to the Hajjiyak Pass. The capital rested on the flanks of two opposite mountains, and extended across the intervening valley. Hence it would seem to have occupied much the same position as the modern village of Bamian, and not that of the ruined city on the hill-top south of the valley which is called in Wood's map Ghulgula.\n\nFrom Bamian the Traveller departed eastward, entered the defiles of the Snowy Mountains (the Hindu K\u00fash), which he crossed most probably by the Shibr Kotal, so often mentioned by Baber, and which seems to lie about due east of Bamian.\\footnote{Baber calls it Shiberit\u00e1, but it is not to be confounded with a high-level valley of that name to the west of Bamian, which was passed by Arthur Conolly on his journey from Kabul to Khorasan in 1840. I made this mistake in Cathay, p. 592.} He then traverses the \"Black Mountains,\" here probably a part of the Paghm\u00e1n Range, and reaches Kia-pi-she, Kapi\u00e7a. M. de St.-Martin has shown good reason for supposing that this kingdom lay east of the Panjshir or B\u00e1r\u00e1n River, and as the large circuit of forty days' journey is assigned to it, it probably embraced the valleys of Nijrao and Tagao, with some considerable part of Kafirist\u00e1n; but this is beyond the territory with which these notes are dealing.\\footnote{One is tempted to seek some connexion with the name Kapisha in that of the Pash\u00e1s, whose especial country this is. General Cunningham quotes the capital of Kapi\u00e7a as being 600 li from Bamian; but there is no such datum in either of the two works on Hwen Thsang's journey. He also makes Hupina or Hupi\u00e1n identical with this capital of Kapi\u00e7a, and I do not think that one could discover from his discussion of the question that Hwen Thsang represents Hupina as the capital of a distinct kingdom, governed by a king of a different race. (See Ancient Geography of India, pp. 18 et seqq.)}\n\nThe pilgrim on his return journey, some fourteen years later, travels in five marches (500 li) from Hosina or Ghazni\nto Hu-pi-na or Hupi\u00e1n, capital of Fo-li-shi-si-lang-na,\\(^1\\) and thence, starting eastward, immediately enters Kapi\u00e7a, proceeds north-east through a city called Kiu-lu-sa-pang,\\(^2\\) and passing a number of other small towns on the borders of Kapi\u00e7a, reaches a very lofty pass over a part of the great Snowy Mountains, called Po-lo-se-na.\\(^3\\)\n\nThere are several passes across the Hindu Kush from the Panjshir Valley, and this might be almost any one of them. But if the time is given correctly in the Life,\\(^4\\) as fourteen days from Kapi\u00e7a, the Pass traversed must have been the most remote, i.e. the Pass of Khaw\u00e1k at the very head of the valley.\n\n(22). After three days' descent from the Pass the Traveller reaches An-ta-lo-po, Antarava, or Andar\u00e1b (Lassen). This State was thirty days' journey (3000 li) in circuit, consisting of narrow valleys amid mountain chains, with a cold climate and bitter winds, but productive in corn, fruit, and flowers. Though it is not possible to give the province all the extent of circuit ascribed to it, there is no room for question as to its identity.\n\n(23). Passing out of Andar\u00e1b to the north-west the Traveller enters a valley, crosses a mountain pass, passes through some villages, and after about 400 li (four days' travelling) he reaches the kingdom of Kuosit\u00f3 or Khost (V. de St.-Martin); a region of mountains and narrow valleys, subject to icy winds, but like Andar\u00e1b productive in crops of grain and fruit. A circuit of thirty days' journey (3000 li) is ascribed\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) M. V. de St.-Martin makes this Vardasthdna, which would be convincing if it answered better to the Chinese phonetics. The Pardchis whom Baber mentions among the races of Kabul suggest the possibility of Pardchisthdna (see Baber, p. 146).\n\n\\(^2\\) Vie et Voyages, p. 266. The position where the Traveller halts in Kapi\u00e7a is too uncertain to guide us to this city. We find a resemblance to the first part of the name in Gul-bahdr at the mouth of the Panjshir Valley, a favourite hunting-ground of Baber's. The term bahdr seems also to point to Buddhist antiquity (vih\u0101ra).\n\n\\(^3\\) The Parsiana of Ptolemy, a name very like Polosma certainly, is somewhere in this direction; all that one can venture to say of Ptolemy's localities with all their elaborate statements of co-ordinates, unless they are determined by other indications. Panshir itself may be formed from Parasema, by a like metathesis to that which in the same region has made Layhman and Paghm\u00e1n out of Langhan and Pamgh\u00e1n.\n\n\\(^4\\) Vie et Voyages, p. 266.\nto this State. It is not clear whether the name of Khost is still used, for I have not seen it in any recent documents, though at the time of Elphinstone's journey it was apparently in some degree still current. Its general position is not doubtful, and is quite in accordance with Hwen Thsang's indications. But no modern traveller has been in the district, and it does not afford the name of a single town to our maps, unless N\u00e1rin may have belonged to it. From Khost he travels again north-west, and after a journey of 300 li (three marches) reaches Hwo, already spoken of.\n\n(24). Thence he goes 100 li eastward, and reaches the kingdom of Mungkien, Munkan. This State was about forty days' journey (4000 li) in circuit, and as regarded products and character it closely resembled Hwo. It was therefore, at least in the part visited by the Traveller, a fertile plain. But no region in this quarter, of anything like forty days' journey round, could be all of that character.\n\nCunningham, having located Hwo at Khulm, places Mun-kan at Yangh\u00e1rik a few miles east of Khulm, at which there are (he says) the ruins of an ancient town. M. V. de St.-Martin identifies it with Mung\u00e1n or Munj\u00e1n, a place which appears in Macartney's map, and which we know from Pandit Manph\u00fal's Report to be still a feudatory province under Badakhsh\u00e1n, on the slopes of the Hindu Kush.\n\nThe names are so absolutely identical that I think in some manner the provinces must be identified. But the locality described by Hwen Thsang, both from its characteristics and from its position in regard to the States which precede and follow it in the Itinerary, must have lain in the vicinity of the modern Kh\u00e1nab\u00e9d or T\u00e9lik\u00e1n rather than of the present Munj\u00e1n. My map shows how I propose to reconcile this. I imagine the Mung\u00e1n of our Traveller to have embraced not only the present Munj\u00e1n, the position of which\n\n---\n\n1 It is in apparent contradiction to my view above stated of the meaning of this expression that in the Life and Travels (vol. i. of Julien, p. 268) Hwen Thsang is stated to have been two days on the journey from Hwo to Munkan, along with a party of merchants and an escort of soldiers. There are, however, many discrepancies between the Life and the Memoirs on the Western Countries.\n\n2 See also Wood, p. 294.\nwe can only indicate very approximately, but the whole valley of the Bangi River down to the plains of T\u00e1lik\u00e1n and Kh\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d.\\(^1\\) This is not only conformable to the customary coincidence of the political divisions of that country with the darahs or valleys, but it is also the only way in which we can easily conceive of the introduction of a State of anything like forty days' compass in the position assigned to this one, i.e., with the capital of the preceding State only one march to the westward, and that of the following State (see No. 27) only three marches to the eastward.\n\n(25). North of Munkan lay O-li-ni, Arni or Alni (say, rather Arini). This little State, which was only three days' journey in circuit, lay upon both sides of the Oxus, and as regarded products, etc., strongly resembled Huo. It was therefore in all probability a watered plain, as indeed we might suppose from its position on the Great River.\n\nCunningham considers this to be undoubtedly Wav\u00e9lin, or Walin as he quotes the name from Ouseley. V. de St.-Martin doubts this, but considers that we have no data for determining the identification.\n\nBut if Munkan lay, as I have shown, near Kh\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d and T\u00e1lik\u00e1n, the State north of this and astride upon the Oxus must have been close to Hazrat Im\u00e1m. Now this place and its district formerly bore the name of Ahreng, or Arheng. I derive the fact from a brief but interesting article on Badakhsh\u00e1n published, long before Burnes's journey, in the Oriental Quarterly Magazine of Calcutta, edited by the late Prof. H. H. Wilson.\\(^2\\) The name is however also to be found in the History of Taim\u00far, written by P\u00e9tis de la Croix as Arhenk; and in Taimur's Institutes as Arhang.\\(^3\\) Here assuredly we have Olini.\n\n(26). The next kingdom lay immediately to the eastward of Olini, and was called Holohu, Rohu or Roh according to\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Possibly the name of the Bangi may have some connexion with that of Mung\u00e1n. Faiz Bakhsh calls the Mung\u00e1n dialect Mungi.\n\n\\(^2\\) I am obliged however to quote from a French version in the N. Ann. des Voyages, vol. 26.\n\n\\(^3\\) H. de Timour, vol. i. pp. 172, 175; Institutes, p. 91. It may also be the Arhan Ferry of the old geographers (in Sprenger, p. 45), but the data there are too obscure.\nM. Julien's systematic transcription. This also in character resembled Hwce. Its northern boundary was on the Oxus; its circuit was but two days' journey (200 li). In spite of these very narrow limits, which are possibly erroneous, or were temporary, we may confidently identify this with R\u00e1gh, still an important fief of Badakhsh\u00e1n, between the Kokcha and the Oxus. A learned critic in the Edinburgh Review for January of this year considers R\u00e1gh to be the Ranga of primitive Aryan tradition.\n\n(27). The Traveller's expressions show that he had not visited the two last-mentioned principalities. His route from Munkan, which may be practically identified with T\u00e1lik\u00e1n, led him about three days' journey (300 li) eastward, over high mountain passes and deep valleys, to the kingdom of Ki-li-se-mo; Kharism as transcribed by M. Julien, but which by his own systematic dictionary might at least as well be read Krishna. It resembled Munkan in character of products; it was (1000 li) ten days' journey from east to west, and three from north to south.\n\nCunningham, whose point of departure on this line still keeps him, as it seems to me, too far west, identifies this with T\u00e1lik\u00e1n. M. V. de St.-Martin, erring in the opposite direction, sees in it Ish-Kashm, at the lower end of the valley of Wakh\u00e1n. I can only see in it the once well-known Kishm or Kashm, the Province of Casem of Marco Polo three days from T\u00e1lik\u00e1n, which is still an important fief of Badakhsh\u00e1n, as we know from Pandit Manph\u00fal. The long narrow form ascribed to the State indicates that it consisted of a long valley, or perhaps of two parallel valleys. These would be the valleys of the Mashhad or Varsach River, on which Kishm stands, and of the adjoining river N\u00e1v\u00ed.\n\n(28). North-east of Krishna, but not in the line of the Traveller's journey, lay a small kingdom called Po-li-ho or Pi-li, in character resembling the last, but only extending 100 li by 300. Cunningham thinks this may be the ruined city which Wood found near the Kokcha confluence, called by the people Barbara. De St.-Martin takes it for the somewhat mythical Bolor.\n\n---\n\n1 See Nos. 546, 825, 1554, 1148.\nThe transcription is rendered by Julien doubtfully as Priha; but by his system it might be Parika or the like. From its relation to Kishm it must have lain either immediately on the south bank of the Kokcha or just beyond that river. In the latter case it would lie between Rost\u00e1k and Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, where now exists the province of Pas\u00e1k\u00fa or SHAHR-I-BUZURG.\n\n(29). Leaving Krishna or Kishm, the Pilgrim crossed mountains and valleys, and after marching about 300 li (three days) towards the east reached the kingdom of Hi-mo-ta-lo, Himatala (possibly, however, Himadara). This had a circuit of 30 days' journey (3000 li); it was much cut up by mountains and valleys; the soil was rich, adapted to agriculture, and produced much late wheat. All plants throve, and every kind of fruit was abundant. The climate was cold. There were a good many forts in the country, each with a chief of its own. The people were nomad, using tents of felt.\n\nConsidering that this principality lay immediately east of Kishm, and was immediately succeeded in the same direction by that of Badakhsh\u00e1n Proper, there is no great room for doubt as to its geographical identity. Cunningham guided by the latter reason points to the vicinity of Teshkan. But this is too near Kishm. A little further east we shall, I believe, find a trace of the old name in that of one of the still existing feudatory provinces of Badakhsh\u00e1n, Daraim, or as Faiz Bakhsh gives it Darah-i-Aim. It seems to me in the highest degree probable that Himatalo or Hima-darah, Darah-him, Daraim, are forms of the same name, which may possibly indicate that the valley had been settled by the Hieumi or Hima tribe of the Yuechi. Daraim proper Wood describes as \"a valley scarce a bow-shot across, but watered as all the valleys in Badakhsh\u00e1n are, by a beautiful stream of purest water, and bordered wherever there is soil by soft velvet turf.\" But the province or mir-ship of Daraim is\n\n1 Pasaku may be a genuine relic of a name like Parika; compare Samarkand, Samarqand, Kanerke, Kanishka, etc.\n2 Faiz Bakhsh is a very intelligent person, who travelled in 1870 from Kabul to Kashgar, under instructions from Mr. Douglas Forsyth, C.B.\nstated by Pandit Manph\u00fal to be one of the most populous and fertile of the 15 feudatory provinces which he details as acknowledging the supremacy of the Mir of Badakhsh\u00e1n residing at Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. And the very circumstance that such a fief subsists is in itself a fact of weight, considering with what singular persistence the political divisions of that country seem to have retained their identity.\n\nThe position which Hwen Thsang indicates, probably as the chief place of the province, must however have been further east than the spot where the modern road to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d passes the Kila\u2019 i-Daraim.\n\n(30). The Traveller, after a further journey east of 200 li or two marches, reaches Po-to-chuang-na or BADAKHSH\u00c1N (Cunningham). This is described as having a circuit of 20 days' journey (2000 li). The capital was built on the flank of a mountain.\u00b9 This kingdom was much cut up by mountains and valleys, and also contained extensive deserts of sand. The soil was well suited to the culture of wheat and pulse, and there was a great harvest of grapes, walnuts, pears, plums, etc. The climate was cold.\n\nWe do not know the position of the capital of Badakhsh\u00e1n at that epoch. All that we do know is that the present capital, Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, was founded or adopted as such in modern times. Previous to that event, according to Pandit Manph\u00fal, the capital of Badakhsh\u00e1n was situated in the plain of Bah\u00e1rak some 20 miles further east. But whether it stood there in the 7th century we cannot tell. Some things in the indications of our text would suit the position of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d well,\u00b2 and it is of course quite possible that the modern occupation of that site was the re-occupation of an old one. We seem, however, from other data, to require a position further east than Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. The Traveller has made 900 li, or as I interpret it nine marches from Hwo. The old Arab itineraries also make nine marches from Waw\u00e1lin (which I take\n\n\u00b9 M. V. de St.-Martin says (iii. 424), \"sur une montagne escarp\u00e9e,\" but I do not find this particular in the translation.\n\u00b2 Thus the old citadel of Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d, called Zagharehi, stood on a rock on the left bank, overlooking the town and commanding the d\u00e9fil\u00e9 up stream (Wood and Manph\u00fal). See also the remarks under No. 31.\nfor Hwo, to Badakhsh\u00e1n city; and seven from T\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1n to the same. Marco Polo makes six from T\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1n to Badakhsh\u00e1n. Wood and Faiz Baksh make only five from Kunduz (taking that as an approximate representative of Waw\u00e1lin) to Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d. Their marches are long, but still the number of days assigned in the old itineraries points to a position more distant than Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\n(31). The Traveller quitting Badakhsh\u00e1n crosses the mountains for 200 li (two days), and reaches the kingdom of In-pok\u00edan, Invakan according to M. Julien's transcription. This kingdom had a circuit of ten days (1000 li). The mountains were close together, and the valleys and cultivated lands were consequently restricted. The climate and the people resembled in a general way those of Badakhsh\u00e1n, but the language was a little different.\n\nCunningham locates this State at the Yomall of Wood, Yomall of later native travellers, on the Vardoj River. De St.-Martin identifies it with Wakh\u00e1n, but, to do so, arbitrarily alters the orientation of the itinerary.\n\nDirection and distance, however, antecedent and consequent, point not to Wakh\u00e1n, but to Yamg\u00e1n or Hamak\u00e1n, the old name of the valley of the Kokcha from Jerm upwards, as we learn from Manph\u00fal, and incidentally from Faiz Bakhsh. The name occurs in a Persian work quoted by Quatrem\u00e8re,\u00b2 but its position was, I believe, till very lately unknown.\n\nSupposing Jerm to be the point of Yamg\u00e1n intended, the two days' march, the south-easterly direction, and the journey over the hills, would suit better some site near Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d as the point of departure than that in the plain of Bah\u00e1rak.\n\n(32). After proceeding further to the south-east for three marches (300 li) by narrow and dangerous paths, Hwen Thsang arrives at the kingdom of Khiu-lang-na, or Kur\u00e1na. This had a circuit of some twenty days' journey (2000 li). In characteristics it resembled Inpokian. There were caverns (or mines) in the mountains, whence much pure gold was\n\n\u00b9 See Sprenger, p. 44.\n\u00b2 See Notices et Extraits, vol. xiv., part i., p. 490.\nextracted. This was imbedded in the rock, which had to be crushed in order to get the gold.\n\nCunningham identifies the position and name with Firganu (which should, however, be Fergamou, see Wood, pp. 262, 266). V. de St.-Martin suggests the district of Gh\u00e1r\u00e1n (or \"the Mines\") on the Upper Oxus, where the Ruby-mines are, but refers doubtfully to Kur\u00e1na as named by M. Reinaud from an Arabic work. Undoubtedly Kur\u00e1na or Kur\u00e1n is the name. Wood had told us that this name is applied to the upper part of the Kokcha Valley (p. 262); and we learn from Manph\u00fal that it is a recognized sub-division of the province of Jerm, lying among the spurs of the Hindu Kush. In fact, it includes the Lazuli Mines. It appears in Sprenger's Map 13 (from B\u012br\u016bni) to the south-east of Badakhsh\u00e1n.\n\nIt is a striking illustration of the wide influence of China under the Thang dynasty that this little secluded state of Kur\u00e1na should, in the middle of the eighth century, have sent tributary missions to the Court of the Emperor, indeed just before that influence was for many a century driven back from the Thsungling by the advance of the Mahomedan power.\u00b9\n\n(33). Leaving Kur\u00e1na in a north-easterly direction, the Traveller crossed mountains and penetrated valleys, and after travelling five marches (500 li) by difficult and dangerous paths, reached the kingdom of Ta-mo-si-t'ie-ti, Tamasthiti.\n\nThis kingdom was situated between two mountain chains. It extended some fifteen or sixteen days' journey from east to west, and four or five from north to south. But the narrowest part was no more than a li in breadth. It stretched along the River Oxus, following all its windings. Hills and undulations of varying height occurred in it, and also plains covered with sand and stones. The winds were icy cold. Little wheat or pulse was grown, but fruit and flowers were plentiful. The ponies were excellent. The people were fierce, and squalid in aspect; they differed from all other nations in having, most of them, bluish green eyes. They\n\n\u00b9 See Ritter, vii. 582.\nwore woollens. The country was also called Chin-khan, but the inhabitants called it Humi. The capital was called Hoentho-ti.\n\nOne cannot but see with Gen. Cunningham that this description can apply in the main only to the long valley of Wakh\u00e1n. And the direction and length of the journey from Kur\u00e1n applies equally well. M. de St.-Martin also sees the fitness of the identification, but is prevented from fully accepting it by his having already identified Inpakian with Wakh\u00e1n. He appears therefore (for his opinion is not very distinctly expressed) to identify Tamositieti with the upper part of Wakh\u00e1n, especially that southern branch valley which Wood calls the Darah-i-Mastoj or Darah-i-Chitr\u00e1l (and which forms the subdivision of Wakh\u00e1n called S\u00e1rig Chaup\u00e1n). De St.-Martin also recognizes in the Chinese form Tamositieti the name of Mastoj, and in that of the capital Hoenthoto the Kundut of Wood, called Khandud by Faiz Bakhsh, and which gives its name to the central district of Wakh\u00e1n, Sad-i-Khandud. These are certainly very happy suggestions. I may observe, however, that the term Darah-Mastoj is only applied to the valley of S\u00e1rig Chaup\u00e1n because that valley leads in the direction of Mastoj. Mastoj itself is the chief place of Upper Chitr\u00e1l.\n\nIt is not impossible that the Tamositieti of Hwen Thsang included both the valley of Wakh\u00e1n and the upper part of the Chitr\u00e1l Valley, a circumstance which would account for the width of four or five days' journey ascribed to it, for such an extent would not apparently apply anywhere to Wakh\u00e1n alone. The passes between the higher parts of the two valleys are stated to be very easy. We have a parallel case in the present day, for Yasin and Pay\u00e1l, districts on the upper waters of the Gilghit River, and separated by a high watershed from Mastoj, are included with the latter under the common term of Upper Chitr\u00e1l or Upper K\u00e1shk\u00e1r. And quite recently we have learned, from the Report of Major Montgomerie's Mirza, that an annual tribute of slaves is paid by the Chief of Mastoj to Badakhsh\u00e1n.\n\nWith reference to the alternative name Chin-khan applied\nto the country, it may be worth while to call attention to the fact that, according to the notes of R\u00e1jah Kh\u00e1n of K\u00e1b\u00fal, translated by Major Leech in vol. xiv. of the Journal of the Asiat. Soc. of Bengal (pp. 815\u2013817), Upper K\u00e1shk\u00e1r is also called Shighn\u00e1n, in fact by a name not distinguishable as there written from that of the province which adjoins Wakh\u00e1n on the north-west (No. 34 of our list). I must leave the matter on this solitary authority. The same is indeed said in Major Raverty\u2019s \u201cAccount of Upper K\u00e1shk\u00e1r,\u201d in the 33rd volume of the same Journal, p. 131. But I cannot regard this as a corroboration, for a comparison of the two papers shows that they have been derived from the same original notes, though no indication of this is suggested in the later paper.\n\nThe name Humi has already been referred to under No. 11 as appearing in Abel R\u00e9musat\u2019s extracts relating to the countries on the Oxus that sent tribute to the Thang dynasty in China. Cunningham takes it for an indication that Wakh\u00e1n was occupied by the Hi\u00e9umi tribe of the Yuechi.\n\n(34). Northward across high mountains from Tamosit\u2019ieti or Wakh\u00e1n was Shikhini, having a circuit of twenty days\u2019 journey (2000 li). It consisted of a succession of mountains, valleys, and steppes covered with sand and stones. Much pulse and corn were grown, but little rice. The climate was very cold, and the people brutal, etc. Their written character resembled that of Tukh\u00e1ra, but their spoken language was different.\n\nCunningham identifies this with Shighn\u00e1n (or Shagn\u00e1n), and there can be no doubt about it. The form Shighnan is no doubt a plural; the gentile adjective is Shighni, with which the Chinese form is identical.\n\n(35). The last kingdom was not visited by the Traveller, nor apparently was the next of which he tells us. This is met with on leaving Tamosit\u2019ieti and travelling to the south of the great mountains. It is called Shang-mi, and has a circuit of 25 to 26 days\u2019 journey (2500 to 2600 li). It is much cut up by mountains and valleys, with hills and undu-\nlations of varying height. All sorts of grain are cultivated; abundance of pulse and wheat; and grapes in plenty. From this country also is obtained Tse-hucang or laminary orpiment, which is got by cutting stones from the mountains, and splitting them, etc.\n\nThe writing is the same as that of Tukh\u00e1ra, though the language differs. The king is of the race of Sakya.\n\nCunningham and De St.-Martin agree that this is Chitr\u00e1l. I may quote in corroboration the fact mentioned by Pandit Manph\u00fal, that Hart\u00e1l or Orpiment is still an export from Chitr\u00e1l.\u00b9 The name of Shangmi has not been elucidated, unless by a suggestion of Gen. Cunningham's, in one of his early numismatic papers, that it is taken from the name (Shucangmo or Shangmi) of one of the five great tribes of the Yuechi, and may have been occupied by them.\u00b2 A brief notice of Shangmi also occurs in the annals of the Thang Dynasty, where it is mentioned along with Kurana (No. 32), and some other small States not easily identified, as having so late as the years A.D. 742\u2013755, sent complimentary embassies to the Chinese Court. The position of Shangmi is there described as north of the Snowy Mountains and of the River Poliu (or Bolor, i.e. the Indus). It is stated to have had the alternative name of Khiu-wei, whilst its capital was called A-she-yu-sse-to.\u00b3 I cannot interpret the latter name, but Khiu-wei transliterated by M. Julien's system becomes Kuvi or Kubi, and exactly represents the name Kobi, which Elphinstone tells us is the distinctive name of the people of K\u00e1shk\u00e1r or Chitr\u00e1l.\u2074\n\nI learn from Manph\u00fal's already-quoted paper that the terra incognita of Dard tribes occupying the triangle of mountainous country between Gilghit and Yasin on the one side and Chitr\u00e1l on the other, and comprising the States of Hodar, Dodshal, Gibri\u00e1l, Darail, Tangir, Kohli, Pal\u00e1s, etc., is locally known as Shanaki, a term in which it is possible\n\n\u00b9 Paper printed by Punjab Government on \"Relations between Gilghit, Chitr\u00e1l and Kashmir\"; see also Major Montgomerie's Exploration Report of 1870.\n\u00b2 Journ.

Soc., Bengal, xiv, 433.\n\u00b3 See the passage quoted in Ritter, vii. 582.\n\u2074 Cuubui, cd. 1839, vol. ii., p. 389.\nthat Shangmi survives, as the state so called by the Traveller may have embraced these, or at least a part of them.\\footnote{Shanaki may however be connected with the name of the Shin\u00e9 Race of Dardistan.}\n\n(36). The traveller, starting from Tamosi\u2019ieti, or Wakh\u00e1n, proceeds north-east by mountains, valleys, and precipices, till, after accomplishing seven days\u2019 journey (700 li), he arrives at the valley of Pomilo or Pamir (Landresse). This valley was about ten days\u2019 journey in extent from east to west, and one day from north to south, in the narrowest part indeed not more than 10 li. It lay between two snowy mountains, and hence was constantly subject to violent winds and icy cold. Snow fell in spring and in summer; day and night the wind blew in furious gusts. The soil was impregnated with salt, and covered with small stones. Fruits and corn could not grow, trees and plants of all kinds were rare and sparse. The traveller soon arrived at desert tracts where was no trace of habitation. In the middle of the valley there was a great Dragon-Lake, which was about three days\u2019 journey (300 li) from east to west, and five days (500 li) from north to south. This lies in the heart of the Thsungling mountains and at the centre of Jambodwipa. At the west end of the Lake issued a broad stream which, passing the eastern frontier of Tamosi\u2019ieti, joined the Oxus and flowed westward. At the east end of the Lake issued another broad stream, which passed north-east across the western frontier of Kieeha or Kashgar, joined the Sit\u00e9, and so flowed eastward.\n\nNothing is difficult in this account except the size ascribed to the Lake. That is an extravagant exaggeration in regard to all the Lakes on Pamir except the Kar\u00e1 K\u00fal. But the whole of the description, and of the distance and directions, apart from that one point, is in precise accordance with the facts, if we identify this Valley of Pomilo with that which commences at the confluence above Panja and extends past the small lake of Pamir Khurd or Barkat Yas\u00edn to the descent into T\u00e1sh Kurgh\u00e1n, as recently travelled by Major Montgomerie\u2019s Mirza. The direction is from west to east; the length may fairly be stated at ten days\u2019 journey, and the\nbreadth from a mile or two (or even less) up to one day's journey; the Lake stands almost in the middle of the length; it is alleged to have an outlet at either end, an allegation which, whether it be true or not, shows that the circumstances suggest such a belief; the western outflow passes the eastern frontier of Wakh\u00e1n and forms a main contributary to the stream of the Oxus; the alleged eastern outflow goes north-east, and joins the S\u012bt\u0101 or River of Yarkand; the salt nature of the soil, in some parts at least, is mentioned by Faiz Bakhsh and is attested by the name of \u0100b-i-Shor applied to one of the tributaries; all the other circumstances exactly agree with the Mirza's account. Immediately across the mountains bounding the valley on the south is the true Bolor, in accordance with what is stated in the next section.\n\nHwen Thsang makes 1200 li, or twelve marches from his point of departure in Wakh\u00e1n, to his arrival in Khiapcanto. Assuming the former point to have been somewhere about Kand\u00fat, and the latter to have been T\u00e1sh Kurgh\u00e1n, we shall have again a close agreement with the Itinerary of the Mirza, for he made 12\u00bd marches between Kand\u00fat and T\u00e1sh Kurgh\u00e1n.\n\nHwen Thsang's account under No. 33 apparently makes him leave the valley somewhere near the lake, and strike to the south-east. This would seem to indicate that he did not follow the Mirza's route down the stream flowing from the lake north-eastward, but took the pass called Kar\u00e1chunkur, which, according to the map which I had compiled before entering on the details of this ancient journey, does take an almost south-easterly direction from that vicinity.\n\nA deviation to Kar\u00e1 K\u00fal would necessarily have extended the twelve marches into something like twenty-four. The whole of the ground round the little lake of Pamir Khurd is very flat and somewhat swampy.\u00b9 Is it possible that this lake had once a much larger extent? Otherwise we must believe that in this instance, in spite of his generally admirable accuracy, Hwen Thsang was mixing what he had seen with what he had heard.\n\n\u00b9 See Ibrahim Khan in Proc. R. G. S., xv. p. 391.\nSouth of the valley of Pamir, and beyond a mountain range, is the Kingdom of Po-lo-lo, Bolor, where is got much gold and silver, and which had been visited by the Traveller on his zigzag route when first entering India. It was then reached by him in five marches from Talilo or Darail (Cunningham); it had a circuit of forty days journey (4000 li), being much longer from east to west than from north to south, etc. The particulars previously given, as well as the position now indicated, are in entire accordance with Cunningham's view, that the country intended is Balti, which he states to be still called Bolor by the Dard tribes. But doubtless, as he also remarks, the territory included Gilgit and Kanj\u00fat, the latter famous for its gold produce.\n\nThe Traveller departing from the middle of the Valley of Pamir, i.e. from the Lake on Pamir Khurd, proceeds south-east for five days' journey, meeting with no village all the way, but encountering ice and snow and precipitous mountain paths. He then reaches the kingdom of Khia-pwan-to, Khavandha.\n\nThis kingdom was about twenty days' journey in circuit. The capital was built at a mountain pass cut through the rock; behind it, to the north, flowed the river Sita. The mountains were almost uninterrupted, the valleys and plateaux very narrow. But little rice was harvested, though wheat and pulse were plentiful. Forest trees were very sparse, flowers and fruit rare. The plains were deserted, the towns and villages almost depopulated, etc. The origin of the royal family was the subject of a legend, in which we find a King of Persia wooing a Princess of China.\n\nGeneral Cunningham deserves credit for his identification of this State with Sirikol, for twenty-three years ago, when his earlier studies on Hwen Thsang were published, the ideas of geographers about Sirikol were very hazy, and the cramped longitudes of our maps till recently hardly afforded room for its existence. Within the last few years this\n\n1 Ladak, p. 45-46. In the J.A.S.B. xvii., Pt. 2, p. 56, he says that Balti is called Palolo by the Dards. At p. 34 of Ladak we are told that Balti \"is called Palolo or Balor by the Dards.\" Do they call it by both names?\nancient and perhaps sole relic of Tajik population beyond Imaus has come to an end.\n\nThe ancient fortress now known as T\u00e1sh Kurgh\u00e1n, and reputed to be the old capital, stands in an extensive open plain,\u2014a circumstance, it must be admitted, which does not answer Hwen Thsang's description. The productions of Sirikol, as detailed by Manph\u00fal, viz. wheat, pease, b\u00e1jra, and a few apples and apricots, agree well with the pilgrim's account. It is worthy of note, in reference to the story which he recounts, that in Persian legendary history we find King Jamshid marrying a daughter of M\u00e1h\u00e1ng, King of China. The existing local tradition refers the building of the fortress to Afrasi\u00e1b.\n\nNo light has been thrown on the name Khiapucanto or Khavandha. According to one of Klaproth's extracts from the Chinese Geography, it was also called Han-tho (Kandha?), Kho-kwan-than, and Kho-lo-to (Mag. Asiat. I., 95).\n\n(39). Proceeding three days' journey (300 li) to the south-east of the city, and then across a mountainous and rugged road two days to the north-east, Hwen Thsang arrived at a hospice called Punjangshelo, Punyasala, or the House of Beneficence, respecting the erection of which he relates a legend. After completing 800 li (or eight days' journey), he descended from the eastern ranges of Thsungling by precipitous and dangerous paths, and issuing from them reached the kingdom of Usha. This had a circuit of ten days' journey (1000 li), and on the south adjoined the River Sita. The soil was fertile, forest trees flourished, fruits and flowers were abundant. Much Jade was gathered in this kingdom, white, black, and green. The language and writing of the people had some resemblance to those of Kashgar. For some centuries the royal line had been extinct, and the country was now dependent upon Khavandha. 200 li west of the city there was a great mountain, with a remarkable stupa on the summit, respecting which a legend is rehearsed.\n\nCunningham and De St.-Martin agree in identifying Usha with Yanghissar. Probably this is not far wrong, but I should gather from the distances, and the character of the\nnext stage, that the country in question was still within the hills. The Pilgrim, on leaving T\u00e1sh Kurgh\u00e1n in order to visit the Punyasala, seems to have taken the road on the south of the Sirikol River, which crosses several rugged passes, and also traverses a valley called U'chi or Vach\u00e1. The name may well be a relic of Usha, but in exact position it does not agree, for the valley is on the south of the Sirikol River, which we must here take as the S\u00edt\u00e1.\u00b9 The name of the hospice Punyasala perhaps survives in Brungs\u00e1l. From this he must have gone three days north to regain the road to Kashgar, and the position of Usha may perhaps be assigned to Chihil-Gumbaz (\"The forty domes\"), a ruin which is passed by travellers on that road.\u00b2 Jade is mentioned by Manph\u00fal, as well as by other writers, as a mineral found in the Yarkand River.\u00b3\n\n(40). Five days more (500 li) across stony mountains and desert plains bring the traveller to the kingdom of Kiesha, or Kashgar (Landresse). The time corresponds well with that taken by the Mirza from Chihil Gumbaz to Kashgar (a little less than six marches) and by Faiz Bakhsh (4), but one very long). The \"desert plains\" may seem inapplicable to the tract between Yanghissar and Kashgar, part of which is highly cultivated; but the stony mountains answer precisely to the Mirza's description of two passes crossed between Chihil Gumbaz and the plains.\n\n(41). Leaving Kashgar he travels five days (500 li) to the south-east, passes the River S\u00edt\u00e1, crosses a great mountain pass covered with sand, and arrives at Cho-keu-kia, Chakuka. This kingdom had a circuit of ten days' journey; the population was large; the hills and mountains were in close contiguity; vast tracts were covered with stones and sand. The kingdom lay on the banks of two rivers. Its crops of corn were abundant, and fruit, especially grapes, pears, and\n\n\u00b9 The name of this State is written Uchha (Ou-tchha) in Klapproth's Extracts (Magasin Asiatique, i., 91, seq.). He follows his Chinese authorities in confounding it with Badakhsh\u00e1n; and Ritter does the like, as was natural in the absence of the information we now have. It is called Yadicha in Ritter's extract from P. Hyakinth (vil., 707, seqq.).\n\n\u00b2 See Mahomed Amin's Itinerary in Punjab Report App. iv. B., and Faiz Bakhsh's Journey. The Mirza calls it Chihil Situn (\"Forty Pillars\").\n\n\u00b3 App. to Panjab Trade Report, p. ccxviii; The Haft Ikl\u00edm quoted by Quatrem\u00e8re in Not. et Extraits, tom. xiv., pt. i., 475.\nplums. Wind and cold prevailed at all seasons. The writing was like that of Khotan, but the spoken language differed.\n\nThis place is identified by Julien and the Chinese scholars generally with Yarkand. Yet as regards the city or centre of the kingdom there are some obvious difficulties. Thus the passage of a mountain and that of the River Sit\u00e1 (a name previously applied to the Yarkand River, or to one of its chief tributaries, the Sirikol River), before reaching Yarkand, are not consistent with the position of that city. Neither is the hilly character ascribed to the environs, nor the high mountain passes said to be traversed in the next stage, between Chakuka and Khotan. These particulars would seem to point to a site among the hills south of Yarkand. But on the other hand the distance from Kashgar (five marches) and the distance to Khotan (eight marches) agree exactly with modern itineraries. So I am unable to suggest a resolution of the difficulty.\n\nHere our comment ends. The chief novel elucidations that have been offered are contained under Nos. 6 (Holumo), 8 (Kiahoyanna), 12 (Hwo), 14 (Helusiminkian), 20 (Gachi), 24 (Munkian), 25 (Olini), 26 (Rohu), 27 (Kilisemo), 28 (Polihio), 29 (Himatala), 31 (Inpokian), 35 (Shangmi), 36 (Pomilo), 39 (Ucha). The series of identifications as here modified requires, as it seems to me, less straining of the Traveller's indications than those given either by General Cunningham or by M. Vivien de St.-Martin.\n\n[Note. Since this article has been in type, I learn that some of the new identifications proposed in the foregoing pages have been already suggested by Sir Henry Rawlinson, in his paper on the Oxus, which was read at the Liverpool meeting of the British Association in 1870, and which has been printed, though not published. Though the fact will add weight to the identifications themselves, I fear it will leave but little value to these notes. Not knowing however how far the coincidence goes, I let my paper remain unmodified. H.Y.\u2014Palermo, April 27th, 1872.]\n\n1 Choekukia appears to have been read by Kluproth Chukupho, whilst in Mr. Beal's Sung-yun it appears as Shikupo. There is a town of some consequence in one of the valleys south of Yarkand called Oshokwab, a name certainly bearing a considerable likeness to Shikupo.\nART. VI.\u2014The Campaign of \u00c6lius Gallus in Arabia. By A. Sprenger.\n\nIn the year 18 B.C. \u00c6lius Gallus, a Roman knight, then Governor of Egypt, undertook, by order of Augustus, a campaign into Arabia. Strabo, p. 780, says, \"Observing that the Red Sea is extremely narrow, and forms an inconsiderable barrier between the \u00c6thiopians and the Arabs, the Emperor ordered Gallus to 'explore' both countries, being determined either to make these nations his friends and allies, or to subdue them. As they had from time immemorial been selling the spices and precious stones of their countries for cash, and never imported goods from foreign parts, they were proverbial for their wealth; and this was the principal inducement for making an attempt to win them as friends, or to subdue them in case of resistance. The Emperor was, moreover, encouraged by the Nabateans, who were allies of the Romans, and promised to further his views.\"\n\nPliny 6, 27, \u00a7 140, relates that previous to Tiberius's campaign into Armenia and Parthia, Augustus sent the geographer Dionysius Periegetes to explore these countries, and to report thereon; and it seems a similar measure was taken previous to the invasion of Arabia by \u00c6lius Gallus. Juba II., King of Numidia, and son-in-law of the Triumvir Antonius, wrote for Augustus a work, De Expeditione Arabica, which, to judge from the extracts preserved by Pliny, contained the fullest description of the peninsula ever compiled by a foreigner. We have no direct proof to show that this report was written and submitted to the Emperor previous to Gallus's expedition;\u00b9 but there is some circumstantial evidence; for instance, Pliny, 6, 28, \u00a7 160, says, that most of the towns which Gallus conquered had not been mentioned by authors who had written before him. As, besides Juba, there was, as far as we know, no detailed\n\n\u00b9 The words of Pliny are: in hac tamen parte arma Romana sequi placet nobis Jubamque regem, ad eundem Ca\u00efum Caesarem scriptis voluminibus de eadem expeditione Arabica.\ngeography of Arabia extant, this remark seems to refer more particularly to the defects of Juba's report. But, putting the work, *De Expeditione Arabiae*, out of the question, there were Roman officers and residents all over Syria, and nothing could have been more easy for the Emperor than to obtain information on the chances an invasion of Arabia was likely to have. The most superficial inquiry must have shown that the difficulties were insurmountable; and we can only ascribe it to the blind confidence in the invincibility of the Roman arms that Roman statesmen decided on so adventurous an enterprise. Pliny says, \"Augustus tantum prospexit Arabiam,\" and the fancy of the Emperor seems to have overruled all objections, if any were raised, against so wild a scheme. It is, however, not the rashness of those who ordered the expedition on which I wish to pass any remarks, but rather on Strabo, the only author who has left something like a detailed account of it, because we shall find it impossible to follow him unless we know his bias.\n\nGallus failed, and there was no mincing matters. The \u00c6thiopians on the other side of the Red Sea, encouraged by Gallus's defeat, rose in rebellion against the Romans, and the impression which these events made upon the populace of Rome cannot have been very cheerful. Everybody very naturally asked: What is the cause of this check of our invincible arms? It would have been both impolitic and unjust to impute any fault to Gallus. The honour of the Roman General was the honour of the nation, and it must be allowed he penetrated deeper into the interior of that sterile country than a military chief would in our days be able to advance, and he seems to have managed his retreat with consummate skill. The real cause of discomfiture\u2014that the whole scheme was unsound and impracticable\u2014neither Gallus nor the public dared to admit; for it had emanated from the Emperor himself, and the belief in the irresistibility of the Roman arms was so strong, that such an insinuation would have been considered high treason. Under these circumstances, a scapegoat was required to satisfy public opinion. Syllaesus, the W\u00e6cer of the King of the Naba-\nt\u00e6ans, had served Gallus as guide during the whole campaign, in which also Nabataean and Jewish auxiliaries were employed. Gallus thought it prudent to make poor Syll\u00e6us answerable for the failure; and in order that the public might become fully impressed with his guilt, he was dragged to Rome, and beheaded there. Strabo was a personal friend of Gallus, and what he aims at, in his narrative of the campaign, is to show that the General was from beginning to end misled by treacherous Syll\u00e6us, and in order to exonerate Gallus from any blame of having allowed himself to be duped, he represents Arabia as a complete terra incognita, where the General was in every measure he had to take dependent upon his guide. Strabo takes good care that the vast tract of land through which the Roman army marched should remain a terra incognita; his account, looked at from a geographical point of view, being contemptible, and wholly unworthy of the great geographer. In his desire to write an apology for his friend, he went so far as intentionally to render the geography of the country darker than it had been, and he succeeded so well that the attempts to follow the Roman army in its progress and retreat have hitherto been unsuccessful.\n\nOur researches will be considerably facilitated if we first follow up the report of Gallus\u2019s retreat. The furthermost town, says Strabo, p. 782, which the Romans reached was that of the Rhamanites, whose king was then Ilisaros. The Romans besieged it for six days, but want of water obliged them to raise the siege. It is clear that they were defeated, and thought it prudent to make the best of their way towards their homes. This, however, Strabo does not like to confess, but speaks emphatically of the treachery of Syll\u00e6us, and says that now, all on a sudden, Gallus discovered the latter\u2019s snares, and began to act for himself. He returned by a road different from the one by which he had advanced, and this shorter road it seems he found by himself. On the ninth day after he had commenced his retreat, he reached Negrana, where he had fought a battle; and eleven days after he had passed this town, he came to a place which,\nas there are seven wells there, is called Seven Wells. Beginning from this village, the country was peaceful, and he passed the small town Chaala, and subsequently Malotha, which is situated on a river. The country through which the road leads after this place suffers from scarcity of spring water. Finally, however, he reached the town of Egra, which is situated on the sea-shore, in the territory of King Obodas. The whole march he completed in sixty days, whereas he had been six months on the road in advancing.\n\nI shall show lower down that the town of the Rhamanites is the capital of Radm\u00e2n, which, in Baron Von Maltzan's recent map, is in long. $45^\\circ 44'$, lat. $14^\\circ 33'$. The data furnished by Hamd\u00e2ny induce me to place it a little further N.W., in long. $45^\\circ 30'$, lat. $14^\\circ 40'$. Negrana, i.e. Nejr\u00e2n, may be situated in long. $44^\\circ 35'$, lat. $17^\\circ 25'$. The distance between these two towns is 180 geographical miles, and this is exactly the distance which a caravan usually marches in nine days\u2014about 20 miles a day. The road to Nejr\u00e2n leads through the J\u00f4f, and the Romans passed the fourth and fifth days of their retreat the second time through this fertile and in ancient times highly cultivated valley.\n\nBefore following \u00c6lius Gallus on his further progress to the place of embarkation, from which, as Strabo says, he shipped his men in eleven days over to Myos-Hormos on the African coast, it appears advisable to ascertain the position of this port and its distance from Nejr\u00e2n. Strabo calls it Egra, and says that it belongs to the dominions of Obodas, King of the Nabateans, who resided at Petra. Pliny and Ptolemy apply this name to a town in the interior of the country, which is called by the Arabs al-H\u00eejr (\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0650\u062c\u0631), and formed in those days part of the kingdom of Aretas, a relation of Obodas. Ancient geography offers numerous instances in which seaports assumed the names of important towns in the interior: thus mariners gave to Mokh\u00e2 the name of Muza; to \u2018Oqayr, in Bahrayn, that of Gerrha; and the modern Mowayliha is called by Ptolemy Modiana, because here the goods destined for Madyan (\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0652\u064a\u064e\u0627\u0646) were disembarked. The ancients knew the name of \u2018Aden; Philostorgus\nwrites '\u0391\u03b4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7, and Pliny, 6, 32, \u00a7 159, Athene; yet it seems to have been the habit of Egyptian sailors who visited that seaport to say, \"I am sailing to Arabia,\" and hence it was called by them Arabia (not Arabiae) emporium. It is, therefore, clear that Strabo means by Egra on the coast, the seaport in which goods destined for al-Hijr were usually landed. Moqaddasy informs us that this seaport is 'Aunyd (\u0639\u0648\u064a\u0646\u064a\u062f), opposite the island Na'm\u00e2n, and consequently situated in long. 35\u00b0 12', lat. 27\u00b0 5'. It is the sixteenth station of the Egyptian pilgrims, who now call it al-Azlam. In Ptolemy's map it has the name Rhaunathu, which, as the 'Ayn\u2014the first consonant\u2014is in some Semitic dialects pronounced like Ghayn, or our Rh, may be a corruption of 'Aunyd.\n\nFrom Nejr\u00e2n, the ninth stage in Gallus's retreat, to W\u00e2diy Laym\u00fbn, a place one day within Mekka, there is only one road, and it is nineteen marches long. At W\u00e2diy Laym\u00fbn (anciently called Bost\u00e2n Beny 'Amir) Gallus had the choice: he might proceed to Mekka, 23 miles, and thence to al-Madyna, eleven marches; or he might leave Mekka on his left, and take the direct route to al-Madyna, which Burton travelled in nine days. From al-Madyna by Dzu-l-Marwa to 'Aunyd there are twelve marches. Consequently there are from Radm\u00e2n to 'Aunyd 52 or 49 marches. The distance may be reduced to 44 heavy and fatiguing marches, by proceeding from Mekka by Badr to the seaport Yanbo', and following thence the coast to 'Aunyd. This is, and has been for 800 years, the road of the Egyptian pilgrims to Mekka; but in the time of Mohammed caravans passed through it only if their regular route leading through al-Madyna was obstructed; and it is not likely that Gallus would have chosen it. Gallus completed the journey from Radm\u00e2n to 'Aunyd in 60 days, and consequently he allowed his men eight or eleven days' rest.\n\nComparing this retreat with marches of regiments in India, we find that the stages along the Great Trunk Road are shorter, as they rarely exceed 17 miles, whereas in Arabia they average 20 or 21 miles. But we may assume that the Roman army was, like a caravan, well provided with\ncamels, and that every man had a chance of riding part of the way.\n\nThough we know every stage along Gallus's line of march, neither in ancient nor in modern geographers do we find the three places mentioned by Strabo\u2014the Seven Wells, Chaala, and Malotha. Strabo repeatedly expresses his contempt for barbarous names; and it appears that he not only disdained to disfigure his pages by mentioning more of them than he could help, but also refused to pay any attention to their spelling: this may be the main cause why we find it so difficult to identify his data with those of other authors. If the eleven days from Nejran to the Seven Wells are marching days, they coincide with the station Tarj (\u062a\u0631\u062c), and, if two days of rest are included in them, with Ma\u00e7ama (\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0627\u0645\u0629); both these places are villages of some importance.\n\nMuch more instructive than the name of the place is Strabo's statement that Gallus at or soon after he had passed the Seven Wells reached a peaceful country. As far as Ma\u00e7ama and Tarj, the Khath'amites, a Yemenic tribe, prevailed; and as it was his avowed object to subjugate that portion of Arabia which is opposite to \u00c6thiopia, that is to say Yemen (the rest of Arabia was never worth possessing), they were naturally hostile to the invaders. At Tarj, and north of it, various sub-divisions of the Banu \u00c7a'\u00e7a'a (the Bana-sasei of Pliny), a powerful Ma'additic tribe, were settled; as the Ma'addites would probably not have been sorry to see their southern neighbours punished, they had less reason for being hostile to the invaders.\n\nIt is very singular that Juba, Augustus's reporter on the condition of Arabia, is well acquainted with those Ma'additic tribes through whose territory Gallus had to pass, and with no others, though the Ma'addites in Eastern Arabia were by far the most powerful and important. He seems to have paid particular attention to the ways and means of the intended invasion, and it appears even likely that the Romans, or their confederates the Nabat\u00e6ans, had come to an arrangement with the Ma'additic tribes in question, before entering on their adventure. Pliny recapitulates Juba's statement as\nfollows: Achoali, oppidum Phodac. Min\u00e6i a rege Cret\u00e6 Min\u00e6, ut existimant, originem trahentes, quorum Charm\u00e6i oppidum XIV. mill. passuum, Mariaba Baramalac\u00fbm, et ipsum non spernendum, item Carnon. Rhadamei, et horum origo Rhadamanthus putatur frater Minois. Homerit\u00e6, Messala oppidum. Hamir\u00e6i, Gedranit\u00e6, Ilisanit\u00e6, Bachilit\u00e6.\n\nI would observe, that what the author says of the Rhadamei is a mythological digression, and that the other names are enumerated in geographical order from north to south.\n\nThe following is a periphrase of the passage: The Ban\u00fb-\u2018Ow\u00e2l are in possession of the town of Fadak (compare Dozy, Die Israeliten zu Mekka, p. 67). The capital of the Min\u00e6ans is \u1e24arm, a town of fourteen miles in circumference. Mekka, the chief town of the Ban\u00fb M\u00e2lik, a place not to be despised, and Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil, also belong to their dominions. East of Qarn are the Nom\u00earites with the town M\u00e2sal; south of Qarn, the Ban\u00fb \u2018Am\u00eer; west of Qarn, and of the \u2018Am\u00eerites, on the mountains, live the Jadara and the Ban\u00fb Ily\u00e2s; and south-west of the \u2018Am\u00eerites the Ban\u00fb B\u00e2hila. I now follow up these clans in the order Gallus came into contact with them, which is the opposite of that observed by Pliny. The B\u00e2hila (\u0628\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0629) are neither purely Yemenitic nor purely Ma\u2019additic. Eight hundred years ago they were in exclusive possession of the province Washm, in Eastern Arabia\u2014far from Gallus\u2019s line of retreat; but at the time of Mohammed they inhabited Bysha-Yoqt\u00e2n, a fertile valley about ten miles east of Tarj. Gallus met the Ban\u00fb \u2018Am\u00eer bin \u00c7a\u2019\u00e7a\u2019a (\u0639\u0645\u0631 \u0628\u0646 \u0635\u0627\u2019\u0635\u0627\u2019) first at Ma\u00e7\u00e2ma (comp. Hamd\u00e2ny, p. 150), which may be Strabo\u2019s Seven Wells. Here and at Tarj they shared the cultivated grounds with the Khath\u2019amites (\u062e\u0627\u062b\u0627\u0645\u064a\u062a). They extended to the north, at the right-hand side of Gallus\u2019s line of march, as far as Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil, and to the east far into Nejd. Ily\u00e2s (\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0627\u0633)\u2014this is, according to Sohayly, the right pronunciation of the word, and not al-Y\u00e2s) is with Arabic genealogists the name of a patriarch, from whom the Mekkians and several other clans are descended. There occurs a verse in the Qur\u00e2\u2019n, 2, 195, in which the prophet rebukes his countrymen for having altered the ceremonies of\npilgrimage, and orders them, if we adopt the reading of Sa'yd bin Jobayr, to return to the practice of Ily\u0101s.\\(^1\\) It seems that Ily\u0101s was the name of an extinct clan, which had had its seats not far from Mekka, and that the genealogists employed the name after dissolution of the tribe, as it is their habit, to fill up their symbolic pedigree. The Jadara too were extinct at the time of Mohammed, or nearly so; but their name was kept up in sacred history. It is related in a legend that the founder of this tribe rebuilt the jadr (wall) of the Ka'ba after it had been destroyed by an inundation. On the origin of this tribe the genealogists are not agreed. Some connect them with the Hodzaylites, others with the Azdites. In either case they must have lived on the hills south-west of Qarn-al-Man\u0101zil. Ethnographical names are subject to great changes in every country: thus, the Elscacians have been Germans, became les plus Fran\u00e7ais des Fran\u00e7ais, and now share again the fate of the German nation; whilst the Austrians are excluded from it. Thus, it may have happened that the Jadara and Ban\u016b Ily\u0101s had been a great federation of families, and that these families subsequently entered other combinations, which received new names. Homerite is certainly a mistake for Nomeritae. Nomayr (\u0646\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0631; pronounced Nom\u0113r) is represented by the genealogists as a subdivision of the \u2018\u0100mirites. They extended as far to the east as Yam\u0101ma, and their most western encampments which we are able to trace are about four days' journey north-east of Qarn-al-Man\u0101zil. In reference to their town, M\u0101sal, also called D\u00e2ra M\u0101sal (\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0644), Hamd\u0101ny, p. 285, says: There are two places of the name of M\u0101sal: one, M\u0101sal near J\u0101wa (\u062c\u0648\u0627), belongs to the B\u0101hilu; the other, M\u0101sal near al-Jom\u0101h (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0639\u0629), to the Dhabba, a subdivision of the Nomayr tribe. The latter town is situated north-east of Nejr\u0101n, and far\n\n\\(^1\\) We may reject the reading \u201cIly\u0101s,\u201d and adhere to the common reading, \u201creturn to the practice of the people.\u201d In this case we give up the authority of the Qor\u0101n for the existence of a tribe or person of the name of Ily\u0101s; but there remains the authority of Sa'yd bin Jobayr, which is quite as valuable as that of the Qor\u0101n.\nfrom Gallus's line of retreat; but it was its mercantile importance which attracted the attention of the reporter. Pliny, 12, 16, \u00a7 69, enumerates the various sorts of myrrh, and says: \"Sexta, quam Dusaritin vocant, est candida uno tantum loco, quae in Messalum oppidum convehitur,\"\u2014that is to say, the myrrh which is grown in W\u00e2diy Daw\u00e2s\u00eer (the Regio Myrrhifera interior of Ptolemy) is brought to M\u00e2sal, and thence we may suppose to Tob\u00e2la.\n\nWhere were the seats of the Mineans? This is the great question in the ancient geography of Arabia, and the answer is not without importance for our present purpose. With the view of preparing the reader for the results I have come to, I put another question, which every Arabist is able to answer with perfect certainty. Where were the Kindites in the year in which Mohammed was born? One of their chiefs, surrounded by some of his clansmen, was ruler in D\u00fbmat-al-Jandal; another in Bahrayn, where he occupied the citadel Moshaqqar; some Kindites were settled not far from Nejran; but their main force was settled in Nejd. Here they formed a kingdom so powerful that the Byzantine Emperors sent ambassadors to their sovereigns. The most western settlement of this empire, and at a more remote period its capital, was Ghamr-dzy-Kinda, close to Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil, and only two days east of Mekka.\u00b9 In the very year of Mohammed's birth they lost a battle in Nejd, retired in a body to Hadhramaut, where it seems they had settlements of old, and became masters of that fertile country. The ubiquitous Kindites had settlements in various parts of Arabia, most distant from each other; and where they had a settlement, they ruled over the neighbouring tribes. There have always been, and there are up to this day, tribes in Arabia which have a military organiza-\n\n\u00b9 It is important to establish the proximity of Qarn and Ghamr-dzy-Kinda (\u0642\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646 \u062f\u064e\u064a \u0643\u0650\u0646\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0629), it being one of the arguments for the identity of the Mineans of Greek authors, with the Kindites of Arabic and Byzantine historians. Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil is, according to Hamd\u00e2ny, 18+22=40 miles from Mekka; and Ghamr-dzy-Kinda, according to Ibn Khord\u00e2dbah, p. 107, 41 miles. Both places lie either on the same road, or on parallel roads closely approaching to one another.\ntion, and keep their neighbours in mild subjection. The Druses in Lebanon and in Hasz\u00e2n are an instance of such a tribe accessible to tourists, and deserve the attention of men taking an interest in the institutions of semi-barbarous nations left to themselves. The Kindites were such a tribe on the greatest scale known, and there is reason to suppose that the Min\u00e6ans, whom Ptolemy calls gens min\u00e6a, are the predecessors of the Kindites. The first question is not where have there been ramifications of the Min\u00e6ans? but where was their main force concentrated? Among the towns which Jaba mentions, Carman undoubtedly answers to Qarn, usually called Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil (\u0642\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0646\u064f \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650\u0644\u0652), two days east of Mekka, on the road to Nejran and Ganda, and also to the Persian Gulf and Babylonia. Baramalacum may be a clerical error, or the Syriac form for Ban\u00fb-M\u00e2lik. This was at the time of Mohammed the name of an insignificant tribe in the vicinity of Mekka. In genealogy M\u00e2lik occurs twice: as the father of Qoraysh, from whom the Mekkians derived their origin; and as the grand-uncle of Qoraysh. The meaning of the latter symbol is that the M\u00e2likites were a separate tribe, but more ancient and closely related to the Mekkians; and the former symbol expresses the opinion of those who considered the Mekkians as a branch of the nomadic M\u00e2likites. At the time of Ptolemy the latter view seems to have been prevalent; for if the name Malich\u00e6, as he calls them, had been applied merely to a few roaming families, it would have escaped his notice. If Mariaba is the correct reading, Mariaba Baramalacum means capital of the Ban\u00fb-M\u00e2lik, i.e. Mekka. But Ptolemy writes Macoraba, and this may also originally have been the spelling in Pliny. The import is the same\u2014the Mekka of the Ban\u00fb-M\u00e2lik.\n\nThere remains the site of Charamei to be identified, which, if it were only four miles in circumference, must have been a vast city. Ptolemy calls the capital of the Min\u00e6ans Carman regio, and places it three marches south of Tob\u00e2la. In Arabic itineraries we find, at the same distance from Tob\u00e2la, \"a large village,\" called Ben\u00e2t-Harm. Y\u00e2q\u00fbt, 2, 233, calls this place Harb or Ben\u00e2t-Harb, putting b for m, just as in\nQor\u00e2n, \u00a7 90, Mekka is called Bekka; as Ptolemy spells Mariama instead of Mariaba; as Pliny writes Tomala for Tobala; and as Maum\u00e2h was also pronounced Baub\u00e2h (Mu'jam I, 755). At the time of Juba and Ptolemy Ben\u00e2t-Harm was the capital of the Min\u00e6ans. Two hundred years earlier, at the time of Eratosthenes, Carna (Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil) enjoyed this distinction, and hence we conclude that the kingdom of the Min\u00e6ans extended from Mekka to the east and to the south. Looking closer at its geography, we perceive that Harm has the same latitude as Ma\u00e7\u00e2ma (about 19\u00b0), and the distance between the two places cannot be more than 20 miles; but Harm lies on the road to \u00c7an\u00e2, and Ma\u00e7\u00e2ma (Seven Wells?) on the road to Nejr\u00e2n. Between Harm and Mekka are eleven marches, and I have shown that the Hamir\u00e6i, Gedranit\u00e6, Ilisanit\u00e6, and Bachilit\u00e6 commanded the road within this space. Taking these facts into consideration, we come to the conclusion that these tribes formed a confederation, which was headed by the Min\u00e6ans. How far this confederation or Min\u00e6an kingdom extended to the east into Nejd, we do not know; but we may assert that most of the Nomerit\u00e6 belonged to it, and its eastern limit may have been beyond Dharyya. At a later period Dharyya was the capital of those regions, owing to its geographical position. But at an earlier time the kings of the confederation resided in a town on the great mercantile road from southern Arabia to Syria and Egypt, viz. at Qarn, Ben\u00e2t-Harm, Ghamr-dzy-Kinda, because in those days the great object of the confederation was to secure the monopoly of transport for part of the road. This monopoly, which yielded great profits, and even a share in the commerce itself, the Min\u00e6ans enjoyed for ages. Pliny, 12, 14, \u00a7 53, says of them: \"Hi primi commercium thuris fecere maximeque exercent, a quibus et Min\u00e6um dictum est.\" The assertion \"primi fecere\" is not to be taken literally, for the importation of frankincense into Egypt and Syria began more than a thousand years previous to the time from which Pliny's information may have dated. There is no doubt the Min\u00e6ans had colonies near the frankincense region, and perhaps elsewhere\u2014just like the Kindites;\nbut their main force was between Mekka and Ben\u00e2t-Harm and in Western Nejd. The remark which \u00c6lius Gallus made on them apud Pliny, \u00a7 63, \"Min\u00e6is fertiles agros palmetis arbustoque, inpecore divitias,\" suits extremely well Western Nejd and the neighbourhood of Tob\u00e2la and of Ben\u00e2t-Harm. When the Min\u00e6ans are described as \"gens magna\" (Ptolemy), or as one of the four great nations of Arabia (Eratothenes), the whole confederation is meant. Arabic authors, who are always guided by genealogy, never take the Kindites in so extensive a sense.\n\nPliny,12, 14, \u00a7 63, explains how the frankincense commerce was carried on at Sabota, in Hadhramaut, and says: \"Ibi decimas Deo, quem Sabin vocant, mensura, non pondere, sacerdotes capiunt, nec ante mercari licet; inde impens\u00e6 public\u00e6 tolerantur. Nam et benigne certo itinerum numero Deus hospites pascit.\" In Sabis the b stands for m, the original word being shams, the Sun. In another passage this God is called Assabinus, with the article. Not only at Sabota, but also in their further progress, the caravans placed themselves under the protection of religion, and Pliny says, lower down, in speaking of the expenses of transport: \"Sunt et qu\u00e6 sacerdotibus dantur portiones.\" This observation applies to the Min\u00e6ans and other tribes, through whose territories the latyma (\u0644\u064e\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0645\u064e\u0629; caravan carrying perfumes) passed. We have observed that a legend connects the name of the Gedranit\u00e6 with the Ka'ba; and that the Ilisanit\u00e6 are praised for their orthodoxy in the ceremonies of the pilgrimage. There are passages in Azraqy which bring the Kindites\u2014who, in my opinion, are the successors of the Min\u00e6ans\u2014into connexion with the sacred months and with the pilgrimage. The most important is p. 125. The Arabs counted by lunar months, but the Hajj, pilgrimage, which answered to our Easter, was to be held as near as possible to the vernal equinox. In order to bring their Hajj year into unison with the lunar year, they intercalated every three or two years one month; and after the completion of the ceremonies of the Hajj, a man who had the title Qalammas proclaimed whether a month was to be intercalated or not,\u2014that\nis to say, whether the next Hajj was to take place after twelve or thirteen lunations. This was the most important office in their ecclesiastical institutions, because all religious ceremonies had no other object than to procure safety for commerce; and for this purpose it was law that, during the three Hajj months (March and April, and parts of February and of May), as well as during the month Rajab (September), all feuds should cease, and arms be laid aside. The Qalammas, it is to be supposed, was less guided in his decision by astronomical observations than by an understanding with the heads of similar neighbouring confederations that the same months should be kept sacred all along the caravan roads.\n\nWe learn from Azraqy the important fact that this office was originally held by the Kindites: from them it lapsed to the Ban\u00fb M\u00e2lik, the same tribe of which I have spoken above; and they held it\u2014notwithstanding their political insignificance, consequent on their separation from the Mekkians\u2014until it was done away with by Mohammed\u2019s changing the almanack. I have shown in my Leben des Moh., vol. iii. p. 520, that Min\u00e2 was the spot in which the principal ceremonies of the Hajj were performed, and it appears to me likely that the Mineans derived their name from Min\u00e2. The name Min\u00e6i occurs very frequently in ancient authors, and, errors excepted, is everywhere spelt alike; whereas other Arabic names assume the most diversified shapes. For instance: Adramytta (Theophr.), Chatramotit\u00e6 (Eratosth.), Atramit\u00e6 (Juba), Adramit\u00e6 (Ptol.) for \u062d\u0636\u0631\u0645\u0648\u062a and its inhabitants. Among the ancients every one spelt barbarous proper names by the ear, without reference to the orthography of his predecessors. If Me\u2018\u00fbn or Ma\u2018yn, or some such word, as has been proposed, was the root, it would be very singular if one and all expressed these strangely-sounding names by Min\u00e6ans. But if Min\u00e2 is the root, their agreement is natural.\n\nThe probability of a previous understanding between the Romans and the Ma\u2018additic tribes in reference to Gallus\u2019s movements, is greatly increased by the fact that these tribes were represented by one man, the King of the Min\u00e6ans.\nAfter having passed the Seven Wells, Gallus reached Chaala. Strabo can only mean Tob\u00e2la (\u062b\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0644\u064e\u0629), the eighth stage south of Mekka, where the road divides, one branch running to \u00c7an'\u00e2, the other to Nejr\u00e2n. Pliny, 6, 28, \u00a7 154, follows an author who applies the name Sab\u00e6ans to nearly all the mercantile nations of Arabia, including the Min\u00e6ans; and, in enumerating the Sab\u00e6an towns, he says: \"Carnus et quo merces odorum deferunt Tomala.\" Ptolemy writes Thumata for Thumala, or Thubala, by a clerical error. Malotha, the next town Gallus reached, must be a mistake for Nalotha, i.e. \u0646\u064e\u0644\u064f\u0648\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0629\u064c Nakhlat, a place two days east of Mekka, on the brook al-Nakhlat alyem\u00e2nyya, the southern Nakhla, so called in contradistinction to al-Nakhlat alschm\u00e2yya, the northern Nakhla, which it joins at W\u00e2diy Laym\u00fbn, whence they jointly continue their course through W\u00e2dy F\u00e2t\u00eema (Marr-Tzahr\u00e2n) towards the sea. The southern Nakhla rises above Qarn-al-Man\u00e2zil, is fed by springs from the mountains north and east of T\u00e2yi\ufb01f, and in some parts of its course has water for the greater part of the year. Gallus's road runs nearly a whole day's journey along this rivulet. In the village of Nakhlat was the sanctuary of al-'Ozz\u00e2, one of the divinities mentioned in the Qor\u00e2n. After the river Nakhla the country changes; it becomes more sterile, and, as Strabo observes, spring water is very rarely met with\u2014probably only in five places all the way to 'Aunyd.\n\nIn our attempt to follow Gallus in his advance from the coast of the Red Sea to Radm\u00e2n, we must be guided by the statement that he was six months on the road, whereas he required only two for his retreat, having chosen a different route. There are, besides the road by which he retreated, only two others leading from north-western Arabia to Nejr\u00e2n. One runs along the coast as far as Dzahab\u00e2n, and thence due east over the mountains to \u00c7a'da and to Nejr\u00e2n. This does not answer to Strabo's narrative, because, being closed in between mountains and the sea, it does not leave room for any detours. The other is very circuitous, and has the form of a horse-shoe. It first runs in a north-easterly direction into Nejd, as far as 'Onayza, for more than twenty\ndays' marches; then in the direction E.S.E. as far as \u1e24ajr, the capital of Yam\u0101ma (near the modern Wahh\u0101bite capital Riy\u0101dh, which lies in lat. $24^\\circ 38' 34''$, long. $46^\\circ 41'$), ten marches; and thence in a south-westerly direction to Nejr\u0101n, twenty marches. A short cut is impossible, the cavity of the horse-shoe being filled with an impenetrable desert; but the horse-shoe may be prolonged by going further north-east than \u2018Onayza. This is the route by which Gallus advanced to Nejr\u0101n.\n\nThe Roman troops landed at Leucecome. The Arabic name is al-Haur\u0101, which means 'chalk,' and also, as Stephanus Byz. correctly observes, 'white.' It is situated in lat. $24^\\circ 58'$, and was in those days, like \u2018Aunyd, annexed to the kingdom of the Nabat\u00e6ans. The men suffered from scurvy, and Gallus was compelled to stay here the whole summer and winter to recruit their strength. As the text of Strabo is not very correct, it is allowable to suspect that he intended to say, till the beginning of winter. At length they started. The scarcity of water in the country through which they had to march was so great that they were obliged to carry this necessity on camels. All this was due to the perfidy of wicked Syll\u00e6us. After many days' journey, they reached the kingdom of Aretas, a relation of the Nabat\u00e6an King Obodas. He received them kindly, and made presents to them. We are at a loss to say where king \u1e24\u0101rith (Aretas) resided. Haur\u0101, the landing-place, has nearly the same latitude as al-Madyna (which I place in lat. $24^\\circ 30'$), and is considered by Arabic geographers as one of the seaports of this city. As Gallus was bound for the south, we should suppose he would have directed his steps towards al-Madyna. It is, however, extremely unlikely that this city belonged to the dominions of \u1e24\u0101rith. He was probably King of W\u0101diy al-Qor\u0101; and it seems that Gallus, after having passed the coast of W\u0101diy al-Qor\u0101 by sea, marched in a north-easterly direction back to this country. By various circuitous ways, says Strabo, Gallus traversed Aretas's dominions in thirty days. The country next to it into which he came is inhabited by nomads, and partly desert. Its name was Ararene, and the\nname of its king Sabos. Here, too, he made many circuits, and in fifty days he reached the town Negrana. The king fled, and the city was taken by assault. In this report Strabo accounts only for eighty days. Add about ten days for the march from the coast to the residence of King Aretas, and, as he had to fight his way, a whole month from Nejr\u00e2n to Radm\u00e2n (a distance which he made on his retreat in nine days), and we have only four months for his advance. In the six months of which Strabo speaks in another passage, the time spent on the coast for restoring his troops must be included. Our great difficulty is to find room for the two vast kingdoms that stretch from W\u00e2diy al-Qor\u00e2 to Nejr\u00e2n; that of Aretas with its thirty, the other of Sabos with its fifty marches in length. The former must have comprised a great portion of Nejd as far as \u2018Onayza, and the latter the whole of Yam\u00e2ma and W\u00e2diy Daw\u00e2sir as far as Nejr\u00e2n. Strabo's summary account is so carelessly drawn up, that it would be unsafe to draw inferences from it on the political condition of Arabia in those days. One thing, however, is certain, that the people of Ararene thought no more of opposing Gallus's progress than their neighbours, the subjects of King Aretas. The name Ararene I can only explain by making of it Agarene, the country of Hajr. Arabic geographers call this country Yam\u00e2ma, and say that at a more remote period it had the name Jaww, and in a vague sense it is also called \u2018Ar\u00fbdh. Hajr was for some time the capital of Yam\u00e2ma, and it happens frequently that the name of the capital is applied to the country, and vice versa; and therefore the hypothesis that Agarene is Yam\u00e2ma appears to me plausible.\n\nGallus's military operations began at Nejr\u00e2n. Six days after he had left this town he arrived at a river. Here the barbarians offered him battle, and lost 10,000 (!!) men and he only two men. Soon after this victory he reached the town\n\n---\n\n1 This hypothesis receives some confirmation from a passage of Pliny. He sums up the intelligence brought back by Gallus regarding some Arabic tribes, and says: \u201cCeubanos (ear. Cerbanos, Ceubanos) et Agr\u00e6os armis prestarte.\u201d The Agr\u00e6i of this passage may be supposed to be the inhabitants of Agarene, and Ceubani the Ban\u00fb [\u2018Abd] al-Qays.\nAsca. The king had fled, and Gallus captured the town. Thence he marched on Athrulla, which surrendered without fighting. He left there a garrison; and after he had taken in provisions, he proceeded to Marsyaba of the Rhamanites, from whence, as said above, he was obliged to retreat. Pliny, 6, 28, \u00a7 160, describes his exploits more amply: \"Gallus oppida diruit non nominata ab auctoribus qui ante scripserunt, Negrana, Nestum (var. Amnestrum), Nescam, Magusam (var. Masugam), Caminacum, Labeciam, et supra dictam Mariabam, circuitu VI. mill. pass., item Caripetam quo longissime processit.\" He does not mention the town of the Rhamanites, because, as the Romans were defeated under its walls, it did not suit his vainglorious bulletin. It will be observed that both authors agree that the fight and conquest began at Nejr\u00e2n. This is important for us, because, save the variants \u1f08\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 in Strabo and Ngram in Pliny, the name has been preserved unaltered, and it affords us an incontrovertible basis for our inquiries.\n\nIf we proceed from Nejr\u00e2n in the direction of M\u00e2rib (S.S.E.), we enter on the third day the J\u00f4f of the Hamd\u00e2n (\u062c\u0648\u0641 \u0647\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646), a valley one and a half day's journey long, and in its lower (southern) part one day's journey wide. Its axis runs from N.N.W. to S.S.E. It is watered by four rivers, the greatest of which, and the only one that has water all the year, is al-Kh\u00e2rid; and this is the river on the banks of which the Arabs attempted to oppose Gallus's progress. Hamd\u00e2ny, p. 144, gives a detailed description of al-Kh\u00e2rid. It enters the J\u00f4f in its south-western angle, after having collected the water of the high table-land round \u00c7an'\u00e2, and of al-Baun, and received a tributary, al-Sirr, coming from the south. The men opposed to the Romans belonged to the eastern Hamd\u00e2n tribes, viz. Dal\u00e2n, Y\u00e2m, Nihm, Nashq, 'Aly\u00e2n, Sh\u00e2kir. There may also have been some Mur\u00e2d tribes engaged. Captain S. B. Miles has favoured me with a letter from a friend of his at 'Aden, in which two or three of the towns conquered by Gallus are mentioned, and I therefore insert the geographical portion of the letter in the original, with translation.\nThere has come to us a man of the name of Sultan Yahya bin al-I Hosayn, one of the inhabitants of Jof. He is acquainted with the towns of Marib and Jof, and the following is a list of the towns he mentioned to us: al-Baydha (i.e. the white), al-Sod\u00e2 (the black, he means white Khariba \u062e\u0631\u0628\u0629, which, in the days of Hamd\u00e2ny, belonged to the Ban\u00fb D\u00e2lan and black Khariba, which belonged to the Sh\u00e2kir), al-Ma\u00e7l\u00fbb, Kamn\u00e2 (also mentioned by Hamd\u00e2ny as situated in Jof, is Pliny's Caminacum), al-Haqash, Haram, Ma'yn (a famous castle), Lakhak (Pliny's Labecin), Maq'am, Sor\u00e2qa, Yanabba, al-Hazm, Sa'ud, al-As\u00e2hil, Umm-al-Qays, al-Mundafin, where there is a silver mine, and Baraqish. He informed me that there are grand buildings entirely constructed of sandstone. Some pillars are so large that thousands of men could not have been able to put them into the ground or even to move them. Yet there are no mountains of sandstone in the vicinity of the pillars, and they had been brought from a distance of several days.\n\nThere is another place which we are able to identify, and that is Nesca. Its Arabic name is 'Omr\u00e2n. It is the capital of the district held by the tribe Nashq (\u0646\u0634\u0642), situated on the Kh\u00e2rid river; and it seems that, as frequently happens in Arabia, it was also known by the name of its inhabitants. Nesca was well known to the ancients. Pliny, \u00a7 155, mentions it on another authority under the name of Nascus;\nand in some copies of Ptolemy Nascus is substituted for Maccosmus (i.e. Gaww-Khidhrima). 'Omr\u00e2n (\u0639\u0645\u0631\u0627\u0646) occurs first in a document written by order of Mohammed (see Leben des Moh. vol. iii., p. 455, where 'Omr\u00e2n al-Gauf, instead of 'Omr\u00e2n algorf, is to be read). Strabo's Asca is hardly different from Nasca. The preceding word, \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd, ends with n, and the copyist seems to have thought it superfluous to write this letter twice. There remain three towns\u2014Nestus, Magusa, and Strabo's Athrulla\u2014which I have not succeeded in identifying; but there is little doubt they were also situated in J\u00f4f.\n\nFrom J\u00f4f, Gallus marched on the celebrated capital of the Sabaeans, M\u00e2rib. The distance from Bar\u00e2qish, the last town of J\u00f4f, is, according to Ibn Moj\u00e2wir, only eight (heavy) farsangs. We are at a loss to make the statements of Pliny and Strabo in reference to Gallus's operations before this town agree. Pliny asserts he took M\u00e2rib, proceeded thence to Caripeta, and there commenced his retreat. If we allow ourselves to be guided by the similarity of names, we identify Caripeta with one of the two Khariba (Baydh\u00e2 or S\u00f4d\u00e2); and assuming that this is the last place which Gallus has taken, we call the assertion that he succeeded in entering M\u00e2rib into doubt. In this case Strabo's Marsyaba of the Rhamanites, before which Gallus was defeated, would be the famous M\u00e2rib. But resemblance of names by itself is an extremely unsafe guide. So many towns in Yemen have the same name that there may also be a Khariba or Kharibat (\u062e\u0631\u0628\u0629), which means 'ruin,' on the other side of M\u00e2rib, or Gallus may have passed and sacked Khariba in J\u00f4f in his retreat. Moreover, it would be contrary to everything we know of ancient geography if M\u00e2rib was called the town of the Rhamanites; since the Greeks, the Romans, the Jews, and the Arabs agree in considering it as the capital of the Sabaeans (Sheba). I think the text of Strabo has here, as in many other passages, been disfigured, and that he said: Gallus proceeded to the town Marsyaba (M\u00e2rib), and thence to the town of the Rhamanites.\n\nStrabo says, at the town of the Rhamanites Gallus was, as\nhe learned from prisoners of war, only two days' journey from the perfume region. The spot which we assign to the town of the Rhamanites must satisfy this condition, besides the two already known to us: that it be beyond M\u00e2rib, and not more than nine days' journey from Nejr\u00e2n. Looking at Marib's geographical position, at the verge of the eastern desert, we find that Gallus had only two ways to pursue his thereto glorious career of conquest. He might attempt to push on to Hadhramaut, and thence to the far-distant frankincense region. His way would have led him towards E.N.E., and in a day or two he would have reached Tomna, the ancient capital of the Kattabeni (Qodh\u00e2'a); from Tomna he would have had to march five days through a desert without water, varied merely by the salt-mines (\u062c\u0628\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0644\u062d) halfway between M\u00e2rib and the first town of Hadhramaut. The inhabitants of Tomna were also called Gebanites, and, for reasons which it would lead too far to explain, they might also be denominated Radm\u00e2nites (Rhamanites). Moreover, the road from Tomna to Nejr\u00e2n is less than nine marches; and, therefore, Tomna may answer to Strabo's town of the Rhamanites. But there is no perfume region beyond Tomna but a desert. The other road to new conquests leads from M\u00e2rib up the W\u00e2diy \u00c2dzina, in a south-westerly direction, towards Bayh\u00e2n and Radm\u00e2n. This is the shortest way from M\u00e2rib to Tzaf\u00e2r (\u0638\u0641\u0627\u0631), for some time the capital of Yemen; and if Gallus had been successful, this route would have led him to the conquest of \"that part of Arabia which is separated from \u00c6thiopia only by a narrow barrier\"\u2014as were his instructions, it would appear. This is the route which Gallus took. Pliny mentions an Arab tribe of the name of Rhadamites, and, in another place, an Arab town of the name of Nagia. The two modes of spelling, Rhamanites and Rhadamites, converge to Radm\u00e2nites. Genealogists consider Radm\u00e2n (\u0631\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646) as a son of N\u00e2jia (\u0646\u062d\u064a). Of the position of the district Radm\u00e2n I have spoken above. Various branches of the tribe N\u00e2jia live east and south of Radm\u00e2n, and one of their cities is Pliny's Nagia. 'Perfume\nregion' (\u1f00\u03c1\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) is a vague term, and properly applicable only to the frankincense country, which is far far off. It is clear Strabo means Ptolemy's Regio Myrrhifera exterior, which begins about two days south of Radm\u00e2n. In Baron von Maltzan's map we find to three places of the corresponding country the note \"coffee\" appended, and it appears the inhabitants find it now more profitable to plant 'Moka' than to grow myrrh. The result of our inquiry is, that the Roman army penetrated into Arabia as far as Radm\u00e2n, and that there it was driven back by the tribes whom the Arabs comprehend under the name Madzhij (\u0645\u0630\u062d\u062c), assisted perhaps by the Himyaritic tribes called 'Ans (\u0639\u0646\u0633).\nART. VII.\u2014An Account of Jerusalem, translated for the late Sir H. M. Elliot, from the Persian text of Nasir ibn Khusr\u00fa's Safurn\u00e1mah, by the late Major A. R. Fuller.\n\nOn the 3rd of Ramaz\u00e1n, I left Ramlah, and went to a village called Kh\u00e1t\u00fan, and from thence to another, which they styled Kariatu-l-'Anab (Grape hamlet). On the road I observed plenty of wild rue growing spontaneously on hill and dale. I also noticed at this village a very delightful spring of water gushing out of a rock, where they had constructed reservoirs, and built edifices. From thence I proceeded up some rising ground, under the impression that I was ascending a hill, and that on going down the other side the city would lie before me. After I had climbed the ascent however for a short way, a vast wilderness lay in my front, partly stony, and partly showing merely the bare earth. At the summit of the hill stands the city of the \"Baitu-l-Mukaddas\" (Sacred Tabernacle, i.e. Jerusalem), between which and Tar\u00e1bulis, which is on the coast, are 56 parasangs, and from Balkh to Jerusalem 876.\n\nOn the 5th of Ramaz\u00e1n, 438, I entered Jerusalem, one solar year having elapsed since I quitted my home, during the whole of which period I had been prosecuting my travels, without enjoying rest or comfort anywhere. The people of Sh\u00e1m and that quarter call Jerusalem \"Kuds,\" and such of the inhabitants of those climes as are unable to go to Mecca at that season tarry at Jerusalem, and remain stationary there, till they have celebrated the 'Yd-i-Kurb\u00e1n according to immemorial custom. Some years it happens that upwards of 20,000 souls are congregated together there in the early part of the month of Zi-l-hijjah, and they take their children there and circumcise them. Christians and Jews also flock there in great numbers from the countries of R\u00fam and other places, to visit the Church and Temple. A description of this superb Church shall be\nduly inserted in its proper place. The environs and villages of Jerusalem are all among the hills, and all the crops, as well as olive and fig trees, etc., are raised without irrigation. The produce is nevertheless abundant and cheap. There are heads of families who collect as much as 50,000 maunds of olive-oil each. It is placed in cisterns and tanks, and is sent to all parts of the world. It is said, too, that famine has never prevailed in the land of Syria, and I myself have heard from credible authorities, that the Prophet (on whom be peace and blessings!) saw in a dream a certain great man addressing him thus: \u201cO Prophet of God, assist me in obtaining my daily food.\u201d This latter replied: \u201cHelp yourself to the bread and olives of Syria.\u201d\n\nI will now describe the city of Jerusalem. It is perched on the top of a hill, and possesses no supply of water except from rain; for although the neighbouring hamlets have springs, there are none within the town itself. It is encircled with solid ramparts of masonry and earth (gaj), and is fitted with iron gates. Not a single tree grows near the city, as it is founded on a rocky soil. The town is large, for at the time I saw it it contained 20,000 souls, as well as fine bazaars and splendid edifices. Its streets are paved with flagstones, and wherever there had been originally a rise, it had been cut away and levelled; so that whenever rain fell, the pavement was washed quite clean. There are numerous artificers in the town, each craft occupying a separate quarter. The J\u00e1mi\u2019 Mesjid is towards the east, and the eastern rampart of the city is strong. After passing S\u00e1mirah through the J\u00e1mi\u2019, there is a level wilderness ahead of vast extent, which they denominate \u201cS\u00e1mirah,\u201d and it is said that that is to be the plain of the day of judgment, where the resurrection of mankind will take place. For this reason hosts of people have come from all quarters of the globe to this spot, and taken up their residence in the city with the view of dying there, so that when the promise of Almighty God shall be fulfilled, they may be present at the appointed spot. O God! in that day be thou the help of thy servants, and thy clemency their safeguard, O Lord of\nmankind! At the edge of that desert is a large cemetery, and several spacious places, in which people pray, and raise their hands in supplication; whilst in return the Almighty sanctions their requests.\n\nO Allah! grant thou our desires, pardon our sins and iniquities, and have mercy on us with thy everlasting kindness, O most merciful! Between the J\u00e1mi\u2019 Mesjid and this wilderness of S\u00e1mirah, there is a valley of immense depth, and in this valley, which is just like a moat, are spacious edifices in the style of the ancients. I also saw a stone cupola surmounting a building, which it is the greatest wonder how it could have been raised up. The current report is, that this is Pharaoh\u2019s mansion. That valley is the Valley of Hell. I inquired who had bestowed this title on the place, and was told that in the time of \u2019Umar Khat\u00e1b\u2019s \u201cKhal\u00edfat\u201d (may the Lord be gracious unto him!) he pitched his camp in that wilderness of S\u00e1mirah, and on looking down on the valley, exclaimed: \u201cThis is the Valley of Death.\u201d The common people further assert, that every one who approaches the brink of the valley hears the cries of the inmates of hell issuing from it; but for my own part I heard nothing on going there. On going half a parasang out of the city in a southerly direction, and descending into a hollow, you find a spring gushing forth from the rock, which is called the \u201cFount of Salw\u00e1n.\u201d Numerous buildings have been erected at the spring-head, and its waters flow in a village, where hosts of villas and gardens have been planted. It is said that whosoever bathes from head to foot in that stream, rids himself of pains and illnesses of the longest standing; and this spring has consequently been enriched with many pious endowments.\n\nThere is an excellent hospital at Jerusalem, which is also handsomely endowed for charitable purposes, and has numbers of patients. These are provided with medicines and cooling draughts, and the physicians belonging to this establishment draw their emoluments from the charitable funds. The Friday mosque is on the borders of the city towards the east: one of its walls lies adjacent to the\nValley of Death; and when you look at this wall from the exterior of the building, you see it for 100 yards built up of huge blocks of stone, having no mortar or cement in their interstices. Inside the Mosque the top of the walls is all straight, and it is on account of the \"\u015fakhrah\" stone that was there, that the Mosque has been erected on that very spot. This \"\u015fakhrah\" stone is that which Almighty God commanded Moses (on whom be peace!) to make the \"kiblah.\" As soon as this mandate was issued, and Moses had made it the \"kiblah,\" he did not long survive, but met his death in a very short space of time. Both up to the days of Sulaiman (on whom be peace!), when as this \"\u015fakhrah\" formed the \"kiblah,\" they erected a Mosque round about it, insomuch that the stone stood in the centre of the said Mosque, and was the point to which all people turned; as well as to the time of our Prophet Muhammad the Elect (may peace and blessings rest on him!), they had ever held that to be the \"kiblah,\" and thither were they accustomed to turn their faces in prayer, till such time as the Almighty commanded that the \"ka'bah\" should be the site of the \"kiblah.\" A description of this will follow in its proper place.\n\nI wished to take measurements of this Mosque, but said to myself, I will first inspect its form and shape, so as thoroughly to understand them, after which I will commence measuring. I roamed about for a very long time in that Mosque, looking over it, and at length, on the northern side, which is contiguous to the dome of Ya'k\u00fab (on whom be peace!), I observed an inscription on a tablet, to the effect that the Mosque was 704 yards long, and 455 yards broad by the \"malak\" measure, and the \"malak\" yard is what they call the \"shaig\u00e1n\" yard in Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n, and that is either an ordinary one and a half or somewhat less. The floor is paved with flagstones, the joinings being stopped up with lead. The Mosque lies to the east of the city and bazaar, so that as you go from the bazaar to the Mosque, you proceed in an easterly direction. There is a fine large \"darg\u00e1h,\" measuring 30 yards in height by 20 in breadth. There are two wings to the \"darg\u00e1h,\" and the face of the\nwings and hall of the \"darg\u00e1h\" are ornamented all over with pieces of particoloured glass, which they have set in cement according to any pattern they pleased; insomuch that the eye becomes dazzled on looking at it. In like manner, an inscription in variegated glass has been made on the \"darg\u00e1h,\" on which is written the title of the Sult\u00e1n of Egypt, and when the sunshine lights upon it, the effect of its rays is so enchanting as to bewilder the intellect. This \"darg\u00e1h\" is surmounted by a dome of vast size formed of hewn stone, and provided with two doors constructed with great taste, which are studded with Damascene brass, looking as if it were pure gold. Numerous designs are also executed on them, each one 15 yards high by 8 broad. These they call the \"Gate of David\" (on whom be peace!); and after passing through the two doors, you find on the right a couple of large colonnades, consisting of 29 marble pillars, each with ornamental capitals and plinths, all the joinings of which are filled in with lead. On the top of the pillars rest arches of stone without any mortar or cement, each arch comprising not more than four or five blocks, and these colonnades extend nearly as far as the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u00farah.\" After entering the door on the left-hand side, which is to the north, a very long colonnade extends, consisting of 64 arches resting on marble columns. There is another gate in this same wall, which they style the \"Gate of Hell.\" The length of the Mosque runs from north to south; so when the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u00farah\" is cut off from it, there remains a square quadrangle, with the \"kiblah\" lying on the south, while on the north are two other doorways alongside of each other, measuring 7 yards by 12 each; and these they denominate the \"Gate of the Tribes.\" After passing through this gate, along the breadth of the Mosque, which runs towards the east, there is again another \"darg\u00e1h\" of immense size, in which are three doors alongside of one another, of the same dimensions as those of the \"Gate of the Tribes.\" They are tastefully bound with brass and iron, so much so that there are scarcely any handsomer ones; and they style these the \"Gate of gates,\" inasmuch as the rest are only double doors, but this\nis a treble one. Midway between these two \"darg\u00e1hs\" that are on the north, and in this colonnade, whose arches are resting on pillars, there is a dome raised to a considerable height on lofty columns, and decorated with lamps and lustres, which they call the \"Dome of Jacob\" (on whom be peace!), and say that it used to be his oratory. Along the breadth of the Mosque runs a colonnade, in the wall of which there is a door, and outside the door two \"darw\u00edzah\" (cloisters?) belonging to the \"S\u00faf\u00eds,\" where they have built fine oratories and alcoves, in which a number of their persuasion dwell and offer up their prayers. On Fridays, however, they enter the Mosque, because the voice scarcely reaches them. At the northern corner of the Mosque is a fine colonnade, surmounted by a large and handsome cupola, on which is written: \"This is the cloister of Zakar\u00ed\u00e1, the prophet, may peace be with him!\" and it is said that on this spot he pursued his devotions without any intermission. By the eastern wall, towards the centre of the Mosque, stands a large \"darg\u00e1h,\" elegantly built of hewn stone, and looking as if it had been cut out of a single block. It is 50 yards in height, and 30 in breadth, covered with painting and carving, and provided with ten doors, so closely placed that there is no more than a pillar between every two. The doors themselves are very elaborately bound with Damascene iron and brass, and studded with rings and nails. This \"darg\u00e1h,\" they say, is the work of Solomon, the son of David (on whom be peace!), and that he built it for his father. On entering the \"darg\u00e1h,\" with your face towards the east, of the two doors, that which is on your right hand is styled the \"Gate of Mercy,\" and the other the \"Gate of Penitence.\" The latter is said to be the one at which the Almighty accepted the contrition of David (may peace be on him!). By this \"darg\u00e1h,\" too, is a handsome Mosque, which once upon a time was only a portico, but the portico was subsequently made into a Mosque. It is embellished with all sorts of carpets, and possesses an establishment of servants exclusively for its own use. Crowds of people flock thither to\noffer up their supplications, and seek a spiritual intercourse with Almighty God; for inasmuch as David\u2019s repentance was accepted on that spot, everybody is inspired with fervent hope, and refrains from sin. They say that: \u201cScarcely had David (on whom be peace!) advanced a step inside from this threshold, when by divine inspiration came the glad tidings that the Most High had accepted his contrition. He then remained standing on the self-same spot, and occupied himself in humble adoration.\u201d I too, who am called N\u00e1sir, offered up my prayers at that place, and besought Almighty and Gracious God to favour me with his grace, and purify me from all wickedness. And may the Almighty bestow his grace, or so much of it as may seem good to his will, on all his servants, and grant that they repent of their transgressions, through the honour of Muhammad and his immaculate descendants!\n\nGoing along the eastern wall, as soon as you reach the southern end of it, you find the \u201ckiblah\u201d occupying the southern angle; while before the northern wall is a Mosque with subterranean chambers, to reach which it is necessary to go down a long flight of steps. Its dimensions are 20 yards by 15, and it is covered with a masonry roof resting on marble columns. In this place is deposited the cradle of \u2019Isa\u2019 [Jesus Christ] (on whom be peace!), which is formed of stone, and so capacious that people say their prayers in it, and I myself performed my devotions there. It has also been so firmly planted in the ground that it does not move in the least, and this is the very cradle in which Jesus during his infancy lay and conversed with various persons. The cradle has been placed in this Mosque in lieu of a cloister, and the same building contains besides the cloister of Mariam [the Virgin Mary] (on whom be peace!) on the eastern side, and there is another, that of Zakari\u00e1 [Zacharias] (may peace be on him!). Most of the texts of the Kor\u00e1n that have been revealed regarding Zakari\u00e1 and Mariam are inscribed on those cloisters, and it is even said that this Mosque was the very birthplace of Jesus (on whom be peace!). A certain stone in one of the columns bears the\nmarks of a couple of fingers, just as if some one had squeezed it with his two fingers; and they say that Mariam, while in the very pangs of delivery, seized that pillar with her fingers. This Mosque is in fact celebrated for the cradle of Jesus (may peace be with him!), and numerous lamps of brass and silver are suspended inside it, which continue burning throughout the night.\n\nAfter passing by the door of this Mosque also along the eastern wall, when you reach the corner of the great Mosque, there is yet another one of handsome size, larger than that of the cradle of Jesus, which is called El mesjidu-l-ak\u1e63a\u2019. This is the one to which the Almighty brought Mustafa\u2019 (may the peace and blessing of God rest on him!) on the night of his ascension from Mecca, and from hence he went up to Heaven, according to the words contained in the Kur\u00e1n: \u201cPraised be he who transported his servant at night from the Mesjidu-l-har\u00e1m (the sacred temple at Mecca) to the Mesjidu-l-ak\u1e63a\u2019.\u201d They have consequently erected a splendid edifice there, which is provided with elegant carpets, and a separate establishment of servants to minister to its care.\n\nOn returning to the southern wall for 200 yards from that angle, there is no covering or curtain (\u201cposhish\u201d); it is an open space; the \u201cposhish\u201d of the great Mosque, of which the \u201cmak\u1e63\u00farah\u201d forms part, is on the southern wall. The western side of this \u201cposhish\u201d is 420 yards long by 150 broad, and it comprises 280 marble columns, with a stone arch thrown over them. All the capitals and shafts of these are highly sculptured, and the joinings are filled in with lead, so that they could not possibly be made stronger. There is an interval of six yards between every two columns, and the whole place is laid down with variegated marble pavement, the joinings being filled in with lead. The \u201cmak\u1e63\u00farah\u201d stands in the centre of the southern wall, and is of considerable size, insomuch that it comprises 16 pillars, as well as a huge dome embellished with coloured glass, as has been already described. The interior is spread with African mats, whilst lamps and lustres are suspended\nevery here and there by chains. A large alcove has also been constructed, all covered with designs in glass, and on both sides of the alcove are two marble pillars of a ruby-coloured hue. The wainscoting of the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah\" is entirely of variegated marble; and on the right hand is the cloister of Mu'awiah, while on the left is that of 'Omar (may the Lord have mercy on him!). The roof of this Mosque is hidden by tastefully carved woodwork.\n\nHaving next advanced to the door and wall of the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah,\" adjoining the side of the courtyard, you find 15 doorways fitted with beautifully-finished doors, each 10 yards high by 6 broad; ten of the number being in the wall, which is 420 yards long, and five on that which is 150 only. Out of the whole of these doors, there is one of brass, constructed with the most exquisite beauty and taste, insomuch that you would say it was made of gold. It was figured with frosted silver, and had the name of M\u0101m\u016bn the Khal\u012bfah on it, who is said to have forwarded it from Baghd\u0101d. When they throw open all the doors, the interior of the Mosque becomes so bright that you would think it was an open area without a roof; but when there happens to be wind and rain prevalent, and they do not open the doors, light comes in through the windows. On the four sides of this \"poshish\" are chests belonging to every one of the cities of Sh\u0101m and Ir\u0101k, and devotees seated about, just as in the sacred temple at Mecca (may God Almighty honour it!).\n\nOutside the \"poshish,\" by the immense wall which has been previously mentioned, is a colonnade with 42 arches, all the pillars of which are of variegated marble, and this colonnade is connected with the western one. Inside the \"poshish\" there is a reservoir in the ground for holding water, which when full comes up level with the surface of the earth; so that whenever it rains the water flows into that place. In the southern wall is a door, where there is a place for purifying oneself; so that if any one wants to perform his ablutions, he goes there and does so; because if a person had to go outside the Mosque, he would not\narrive in time for prayers, and the service would be lost to him owing to the magnitude of the edifice. The tops of the roofs are all sheeted with lead, and in the floor of the Mosque are numerous reservoirs and cisterns cut out of the ground; for the Mosque is founded altogether on rock, so that however much it may rain, not a drop of water can ooze out or be lost, but the whole runs into the cisterns, from whence people fetch it away. Aqueducts have also been made of lead, through which the water might descend; and stone reservoirs have been fixed below the aqueducts, each of which has a hole in the bottom part of it, and through this hole the water passes into a pipe, and so reaches the reservoir without getting dirty, and free from every impurity.\n\nWithin three parasangs of the city, too, I saw a huge reservoir, in which the whole of the waters that flow down from the hills is collected; and a canal has been made for it, which leads to the J\u0101mi\u2019 Mesjid of the town, and hence the J\u0101mi\u2019 possesses the most copious supply of water in the city. There are, however, reservoirs in all buildings for retaining rain-water; for there is nothing else but rain-water to be had. Every one, too, catches the water of his own roof, and the hot baths, and whatever else there may be, are all supplied from the same source. These reservoirs that are in the J\u0101mi\u2019 never require building up, as they are made out of the hard rock; and even if any hole or fissure should happen to be within, yet they are so substantial that they never go to ruin. It is said that they were constructed by Solomon (on whom be peace!), and the mouth of each cistern is so carefully closed with a grating, that nothing can possibly get into it but the water, which is certainly purer and sweeter in that city than anywhere else. If even but a slight shower falls, the aqueducts keep running for two or three days, insomuch that when the atmosphere clears up, and no signs of bad weather remain, drops of water still continue falling.\n\nI mentioned that the city of Jerusalem was situated on the top of a hill, and that the ground was uneven; but the floor of\nthe Mosque is a plain and level surface. Outside the Mosque, wherever, in comparison with other points, there is a hollow, its wall is built up higher, because the foundations are laid down in the low ground; and wherever there is a rise, the wall is lower. In that quarter, therefore, in which the town and streets are down in a hollow, the entrances to the Mosque are constructed just like subterranean passages cut through the soil, which lead out into the area of the building. Of those gates they call one the \"Gate of the Prophet\" (on whom be blessings and peace!), and this lies on the side of the \"kiblah,\" that is to say, the south. It has been so constructed as to measure ten yards wide, and in one place five yards high as above the steps, that is to say, the roof of this passage is twenty yards high in some places. The curtain of the Mosque rests on its top; but the passage is so solid, that a building of that magnitude erected on its back had not the least effect upon it.\n\nSuch huge stones have been used in its construction that the mind cannot conceive how human strength could ever succeed in moving and transporting the blocks. It is said that Solomon, the son of David (on both of whom be peace!), erected the edifice, and that our Prophet (may blessings and peace rest on him!) entered by that passage the night of his ascension, for the gate is on the side of the road from Mecca. Near the gate there is an impression on the wall in the shape of a huge shield, and they say that Hamzah, the son of 'Abdu-l-mu'ttalib, uncle to the Prophet (on whom be peace!), sat down there once with a buckler strapped on his shoulders, and leant his back against the wall, and consequently that that is the image of his buckler. At this gate of the Mosque, where they have made this entrance passage, and fitted folding-doors to it, the wall of the building from outside rises to the height of fifty yards; and the object of making those doors has been to obviate the necessity of the people of that quarter, which adjoins this angle of the Mosque, passing through other quarters of the town when they want to enter its precincts. By the Mosque gate, too, is a stone let into the wall, eleven yards in height and four in length\nand breadth; and throughout the building there is not a larger block to be met with than this, though there are plenty of four and five yards, which have been placed on the wall at an elevation of thirty or forty yards. Along the width of the Mosque you will find an eastern door called B\u00e1bu-l-'ain (Gate of the Eyes), on passing through which to the outside, and descending into a ravine, you come to the spring of Salw\u00e1n. There is likewise another entrance passing in like manner under ground, which is styled B\u00e1bu-l-Khatt (Gate of the Letter), and this they say is the very door by which Almighty God commanded the Children of Israel to enter the Mosque, according to the word of the Lord: \"Enter ye the gate with adoration, and repeat the prayer for the remission of sins; for we pardon you your iniquities, and will favour the righteous.\" There is likewise another door of the same description, which they call the B\u00e1bu-s-sak\u00ednah (Gate of the Shechinah or Tabernacle). At its threshold is a Mosque with numerous alcoves, and its first door is always kept shut, to prevent any one from entering it. It is said that the ark of the tabernacle, spoken of by Almighty God in the Kur\u00e1n as carried by angels, is deposited there. The whole of the gates of the J\u00e1m\u00ed at Jerusalem, both upper and lower, amount to nine, as has been already detailed.\n\nDescription of the shop, or shrine, which is situated within the area of the J\u00e1m\u00ed', and in the middle of which is placed the \"\u015fakhrah\" stone, that formed the \"kiblah\" previous to the propagation of Isl\u00e1m.\u2014The shrine has been built on this account, viz. because the \"\u015fakhrah\" was so lofty that they were unable to put it under the \"poshish.\" The foundation of the building covers an area of 330 yards by 300, and its height is 12 yards. The floor of it is level and elegantly paved with marble, and its walls are of the same material, their joinings being filled in with lead. All four sides of it, too, are formed of slabs of marble like the screenwork round a tomb. This shrine is so constructed that it is impossible to ascend to it at any point, except by the regular passages made for that purpose; and\nwhen you have mounted up to it, you look down upon the roof of the Mosque. A reservoir has also been sunk underground inside this shrine, into which runs all the rainwater that falls on the spot, and the water of this reservoir is purer and sweeter than all the rest in the Mosque. There are four domed buildings in this shrine, the largest of all being that containing the \"\u015fakhrah,\" which was formerly the \"kiblah.\"\n\nDescription of the domed building containing the \"\u015fakhrah.\"\u2014The plan of the Mosque is such, that the shrine stands in the midst of the courtyard, the domed building of the \"\u015fakhrah\" in the middle of the shrine, and the \"\u015fakhrah\" itself in the centre of that building. The latter is of a regular octagonal shape, insomuch that every one of its eight sides measures 33 yards; and there are four doors on four sides of it, viz., to the east, west, north, and south, one side intervening between every two doors. The walls are made entirely of hewn stone raised to the height of 20 yards, while the \"\u015fakhrah\" is as much as 100 yards in girth, but has no regular figure; that is to say, it is neither round nor square, but a mis-shapen block of stone, just like the rough rocks on a hill. On the four sides of the \"\u015fakhrah\" four square pillars have been planted, of the same height as the wall of the aforesaid building, and between every two pillars, on all the four sides, marble columns have been erected, all as high as the other pillars. On the top of these twelve pillars and columns rests the base of the dome, beneath which the \"\u015fakhrah\" stands, and its circumference is 120 yards. Between the wall of the building and these pillars and columns;\u2014that is to say, I designate all such as have been erected of a square figure pillars, and such as are hewn out of a solid block and made of a round form I style columns;\u2014now between these said columns and the wall of the building six more pillars of hewn stone have been erected, between each two of which three supports of valuable variegated marble have been set up. Just as in the first row there was a pair of columns between every two pillars, here there\nare three supports between every two pillars. The capitals of the pillars have been made with four branches, from each of which springs an arch; while those of the intermediate supports have only two branches; so that the extremities of two arches rest on each of the latter, and the ends of four on each of the former. At that time the appearance of this vast dome resting on its twelve pillars, which is close to the \"\u1e63akhrah,\" was such, that on viewing it from the distance of a full parasang, it seemed like the crest of a mountain; for from the base to the summit of the dome, is 30 yards, and it is raised on top of walls and pillars 20 yards high, which form the walls of the building. This building again is perched above the shrine, which has an elevation of 12 yards, and consequently from the level of the courtyard of the Mosque to the top of the dome is 62 yards. The roof and terrace of this building are hid beneath carved woodwork, and supported on the capitals of columns and pillars, as well as walls, exhibiting a style of workmanship the like of which is seldom met with. The \"\u1e63akhrah\" stands above the ground as much as the stature of a man, and a marble screen has been placed around it, so that no hand may touch it. It is a stone of a dark blue hue, on which no man has ever dared to set foot; but on the side where the \"\u1e33iblah\" lies it has a hollow in one place of such a kind that you would say it had been walked over on that part and the foot had sunk into the stone, just as if it were soft clay in which the marks of the toes have been left. In this way the impression of seven steps are fixed upon it. I have heard that Abraham (on whom be peace!); and Isaac (on whom also be peace!) while yet a child, went there, and that these are the marks of their feet. In this building over the \"\u1e63akhrah\" there are always numbers of people dwelling, consisting of holy and devout men; and the place itself is elegantly furnished with carpets of silk, etc. From the centre of the building, too, right above the \"\u1e63akhrah,\" is suspended a silver lamp by a chain of the same precious metal, and there are also numerous other silver lustres within the edifice, on each of which is written that its weight is so much; and all these\nhave been provided by the Sult\u00e1n of Egypt. On calculating, therefore, I ascertained that there were a thousand maunds of silver ware in the place. I noticed a candle there, too, of gigantic proportions, insomuch that its length was seven yards and its girth three spans, which seemed made of perfumed camphor aud ambergris; and they say the Sult\u00e1n of Egypt forwards numbers of candles there every year, one of which is large in comparison with that. The name of the Sult\u00e1n, too, is inscribed on the place in characters of gold, and the building itself is, as it were, the third temple-house of Almighty God; for it is an admitted fact among the sages of the faith, that every prayer offered up in Jerusalem is as acceptable as 25,000 others; while every one uttered at Medina, the city of the Prophet (on whom be blessings and peace!), is accounted equal to 50,000, and every one offered up at Mecca (may the Lord honour her!) to 100,000. And may Almighty God bestow on all his servants the grace to enjoy that blessing!\n\nI have already stated that the whole of the terraces and roofs of the domes were laid over with lead, and on the four sides of the building were fixed huge folding-doors made of wood and ebony, and these doors are always closed. After this building came a domed edifice, called the \"Dome of the Chain,\" which derives its title from the chain of David (on whom be peace!) that is hung up there; and on that none save the lord of justice can lay his hand, for the arm of the tyrant and oppressor cannot reach it; and this fact is universally acknowledged among learned divines. This dome is supported on eight marble columns and six stone pillars; and all the sides of it are open except towards the \"kiblah,\" which is completely shut up. A fine alcove has also been made there. On this shrine is another dome, re\u00ebeting on four marble columns, which is likewise closed upon the side of the \"kiblah,\" and has a fine alcove constructed in it. This is styled the dome of Jibrail [Gabriel] (may peace be on him!), but it is not paved; for the ground itself consists of rock, which has been rendered level. They say that on the night of the ascension the \"bur\u00e1k\" was brought\nto this spot, for our Prophet (on whom be blessings and peace!) to mount on. Behind this dome is another one, called the \"Dome of the Apostle\" (on whom be blessings and peace!), and the distance between it and that of Jibrail is twenty yards. This dome likewise rests upon four pillars of marble, and it is said that the Prophet on the night of his ascension first performed his devotions in the domed edifice of the \"\u1e63akhrah,\" and placed his hand on the \"\u1e63akhrah\" itself. When he went out, therefore, the \"\u1e63akhrah,\" out of respect to him, rose up; but the Prophet (on whom be peace!) once more laid his hand on it, so that it settled down again in its former position; and to the present day it is half suspended in the air. The Prophet then came from thence to this domed building, which is called after him, and took his seat on the \"bur\u00e1k,\" and from this circumstance arises the sanctity of the spot. Underneath the \"\u1e63akhrah\" is a huge cavern, so dark that candles are kept constantly burning there; and they say that this hollow appeared below the \"\u1e63akhrah\" when it went through the motion of rising up, and remained so after the latter had settled down again.\n\nDescription of the flights of steps leading to the shrine, which stands in the courtyard of the J\u00e1mi'.\u2014In six quarters there are roads up to the shrine, each of which has a different name. From the side of the \"kiblah\" are two roads, with steps leading upwards, and as you stand in the very centre of the shrine, one of these flights of steps is on your right hand, and the other on your left. The former is styled the \"Place of the Prophet\" (on whom be peace!), and the latter that of \"\u02bfAur\u016bf.\" The Place of the Prophet is so named, because, on the night of his ascension, he ascended those steps to the shrine, and from thence proceeded to the domed edifice of the \"\u1e63akhrah,\" and the road from Hej\u00e1z also passes over that spot. At present the width of these steps is 20 yards, the whole of them being formed of finely hewn stone, insomuch that each step consists of only one or two blocks cut square, and so regularly constructed, that if you wished it, a quadruped could walk up them. At the top of the flight of steps are\nfour pillars of green marble, exactly resembling emerald, with the exception that these slabs are covered all over with spots of every imaginable colour. The height of each of these pillars is ten yards, and the girth as much as two men can encompass in their arms. Over these four pillars three arches have been thrown, so that one faces the steps, and the other two look to either side. The upper parts of the arches are made straight, and are surmounted with niched battlements, so that the whole appears square. All these pillars and arches too are covered with enamelled designs, the most beautiful in existence. The parapet of the shrine is also entirely of spotted green marble, and looks just as if it were a parterre of blooming flowers. The Place of 'Aur\u00ed consists of three flights of steps leading up to the same quarter, one fronting the shop, and two on either side of it, so that people can ascend from three different points. Here likewise are planted the same sort of pillars at the top of the treble flight of steps, with an arch thrown over them, and crowned with battlements. The steps are also formed of hewn stone in the same fashion as I have already described, each one consisting of only two or three long blocks. On the fa\u00e7ade of the portico the following inscription was beautifully written in letters of gold: \"Founded by the Am\u00edr Laisu-d-daulah Toshtak\u00edn Gh\u00fari,\"\u2014and they say this Laisu-d-daulah was a servant of the Sult\u00e1n of Egypt; and that these roads and steps were made by him. On the western side too of the shop there are flights of steps in two places, and a road formed with elegance equal to that which I have described in the other instances. On the eastern side likewise a road has been made with similar good taste, and pillars have been erected, arches thrown over them, and battlements placed above all; and that they call the \"Eastern Place.\" On the northern side is a road loftier and larger than all the rest, with pillars and arches of the same description, which they style the \"Place of Ash-Sh\u00e1m\u00ed.\" I calculated that in the construction of these six roads, 100,000 din\u00e1rs must have been expended.\nIn the courtyard of the Mosque, not in the shrine, there is a spot where a diminutive Mosque of hewn stone stands on the northern side, which is built like the inclosure round a tomb. Its walls are not above the height of a man, and it is called the \"Cloister of David.\" Close to the inclosure there is a stone as high as the stature of a human being, the top of which is such that a small blanket (z\u00edt\u00fa) can be spread upon it. It is of an irregular shape, and they say that it was Solomon's throne. They also told me that Solomon (on whom be peace!) sat down there while the Mosque was being built. I had observed the above in the J\u0101mi' of Jerusalem, and after reflecting upon it, had entered it on the same day in the diary that I kept. Among other remarkable objects in the Mosque of Jerusalem, I saw the tree of the Huris (Davakht \u1e24\u00far).\n\nI then set out from Jerusalem to visit the shrine of Abraham, the friend of the Most Merciful (on whom be blessings and peace!), on Wednesday, the 1st Z\u00ed-l-ka'dah 438. From Jerusalem to that spot where the tomb stands is six parasangs, and along this road, which goes towards the south, there are numerous villages, with plenty of cultivated fields, and gardens, and trees that require no water, such as the vine, fig, olive, and \"summ\u00e1k,\" growing in endless profusion. At a couple of parasangs from the city are four villages, where there is a spring and an abundance of gardens, and groves, and they call the place Far\u00e1des, the fine place of the road. At the distance of a parasang from the city of Jerusalem, is a spot that is considered extremely sacred by the Christians, a party of whom are constantly resident there, while numbers of pilgrims also repair thither. They call it \"Baitu-l-lahm\" (House of Flesh), and the Christians perform the sacrifice there, and numbers of them come there from R\u00fam. The day I departed from the city I passed the night at that place.\n\nDescription of Khalil (the friend, or Abraham, i.e. his shrine). (May the blessings of God be on him!)\n\nThis tomb they call Khalil throughout Syria and Jerusalem, never mentioning the name of the village, which is (name\ndoubtful). The village is an endowment of the shrine, together with several other villages. At this place is a spring issuing out of the rock, the small supply of water from which is conveyed close to the village from a long distance in a hollow wooden pipe. Outside the village a reservoir, with a closed mouth, has been formed for receiving this water, so that none of it may be lost, and there may always be a sufficiency for the inhabitants of the place, as well as for the pilgrims visiting it. The sepulchre stands on the confines of the village towards the south, or rather the south-east. It is a quadrangle, built of hewn stone, measuring 80 yards long by 40 broad, the walls of which are 20 yards in height and 2 in breadth at the top. Along the breadth of this building an alcove and \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah\" has been formed, and inside the latter many other fine alcoves have been constructed. The \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah\" likewise contains two tombs, placed so as to have their heads in the direction of the \"\u1e33iblah\"; and both of these are built up of hewn stone to the height of a man. The one on the right-hand side is the grave of Isaac, the son of Abraham; the other that of his wife (on whom be peace!), and the interval of the tombs is as much as 10 yards. The floor and walls of this cemetery are adorned with valuable tapestry and African mats, which look handsomer even than brocade. I observed a mat there, used as a prayer-carpet, which was said to have been sent by \"Amiru-l-juy\u016bsh,\" a servant of the Sult\u00e1n of Egypt. They declared that he had purchased this article in Egypt for 30 African din\u00e1rs of gold; a similar quantity of R\u00fam\u00ed brocade would not be worth that price, and I certainly never saw anything equal to it elsewhere. On going outside the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah,\" you find two chambers in the area of the shrine, both facing the \"\u1e33iblah.\" The one on the right contains the tomb of Abraham the faithful (may the blessings of God be on him!), and is of considerable size. There is a second chamber inside it, round which it is impossible to pass, but it has four wickets, through which pilgrims, while they circle round the outer chamber, can view the tomb as they pass each one in succession. Its\nfloor and walls are covered with brocaded tapestry and carpets, while the grave is built up as high as three yards of stone, and numerous silver lamps and lustres are suspended all about. The other chamber, which is on the left-hand side of the \"kiblah,\" contains the grave of Sarah, the wife of Abraham (on whom be peace!). Between the two chambers runs a passage, over which stands the gate of either like a porch; and there likewise numbers of lamps and lustres are suspended. After passing both these chambers, you find two more sepulchres, near each other; on the right-hand side the tomb of the prophet Jacob (on whom be peace!), and on the left that of his wife. Beyond these again are some buildings which constituted the stage for resting place of Abraham (may the blessings of God rest on him!). In this shrine, therefore, there are altogether six graves, and outside the inclosure is a slope leading down to the sepulchre of Joseph, the son of Jacob (peace be on them both!), to which they have built a fine dome and a tomb of stone. On the side towards the desert, they have made a vast cemetery between Joseph's dome and the shrine, whither they have brought and buried numbers of people from various places. On the terrace of the \"ma\u1e33\u1e63\u016brah\" that is in the shrine, rooms have been made for guests arriving there, and many charitable endowments, consisting of villages and fruitful crops, have been bestowed on them.\n\nIn Jerusalem, as well as here, barley is most generally cultivated, while wheat is scarce, but of olives there is an abundance. To all guests, travellers, and pilgrims, therefore they give bread and olives, and numbers of mills, worked by mules and oxen, are constantly grinding flour, while plenty of female servants are engaged all day in baking bread, and every one of their loaves weighs a maund. To every one arriving at that spot they present a loaf of bread, and a measure of lentils cooked with olive-oil, daily, as well as some raisins, and this custom has continued in vogue from the time of Abraham, the friend of the Most Merciful (may peace be with him!), until the present moment. Sometimes it happens that 500 people come there of a day, and enter-\ntainment of this description is provided for all of them. It is said that they made no door at all to this cemetery at first, and no one was able to enter it, so that people used to perform their pilgrimage to it outside the porch; but as soon as Mehd\u00ed was seated on the throne of Egypt, he ordered a door to be opened into it, which was accordingly done. It was also furnished throughout with several necessaries, such as carpets and hangings, and various additional buildings were made. The gate of the shrine is in the middle of the northern wall, and stands four yards high from the ground. Stone steps have been made on either side, by one of which you ascend, and come down by the other side; and a small iron door has also been fixed there.\n\nFrom hence I returned to Jerusalem, and from Jerusalem set out again on foot in company with a party, who were resolved on a journey to Hej\u00e1z. The guide was a very active man and an excellent walker, and they called him Ab\u00fa B\u00e9kr Hamad\u00e1n\u00ed. It was the middle of Z\u00ed-l-ka\u2019dah, 438, when I left Jerusalem, and in three days I came to a place called Az\u2019ar, where there was a flowing stream and plenty of trees. [1] I then arrived at another halting-place, which they called \u201cW\u00e1diu-l-kari,\u201d from whence I reached Mecca in ten days. That year no caravans came from any quarter, and provisions were not procurable. I alighted at the Sakanatu-l-\u2019att\u00e1r\u00edn, opposite the Gate of the Prophet (on whom be peace!), and on Tuesday I repaired to \u2019\u00c1raf\u00e1t, where I found all the people in great terror of the Arabs. I stayed a couple of days at Mecca, and returned by way of Syria to Jerusalem, where I arrived on the 5th of Muharram, 439. I will give no account of Mecca and the pilgrimage in this place, but reserve my description of it till my last visit there.\n\nThe Christian infidels have a church at Jerusalem, which they style \u201cBeytu-l-ma\u1e33\u00e1mah,\u201d and consider extremely holy. Every year a vast multitude came there from R\u00fam on pilgrimage, and the King of R\u00fam himself even comes in disguise, so that no one may recognize him. At the period when \u201cthe Ruler by command of God was lord of Egypt,\u201d\n\n[1] The passage inclosed in brackets is wanting in the Museum copy.\nthe Kaisar of R\u00fam happened to come there, and the Ruler getting intelligence of this, despatched one of his officers with the following instructions. \"There is a person seated on the J\u00e1mi' at Jerusalem of such and such an aspect and appearance: do you go up to him and say, that the Ruler has sent you to him to let him know that he need not suppose I am ignorant of his doings. Tell him, however, to rest perfectly happy, as I have no evil design against him.\" This Ruler likewise directed the church to be pillaged, desolated, and destroyed, and for a long time it lay in ruins; but subsequently the Kaisar of R\u00fam sent ambassadors with many choice gifts and kind attentions, to solicit peace and intercede with him; till at length he consented to its re-building, and the edifice was accordingly renovated. The church in question is a spacious place, so much so that it can hold 20,000 souls, and it is constructed in the most splendid style of coloured marble, adorned with sculpture and painting. The interior is embellished with brocade and pictures, and a vast deal of gold is used in its decorations. Portraits of Jesus, represented as sitting on an ass, are put up in several places, as well as those of the other prophets, such as Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and his children (on all of whom be peace!), and they are anointed with the oil of sindar\u00fas. Each picture, moreover, is covered with a large plate of transparent glass of the same size as itself, so that the portrait may not be at all hidden, and this they place there to prevent the dust from settling on the painting, the glasses being daily cleaned by servants. Besides this, there are many other parts constructed with the utmost elegance, insomuch that if a detailed description of them were to be written, it would lead to a great diffuse-ness. In this church, too, is a chamber of two kinds, made after the fashion of Heaven and Hell, one half of it being descriptive of Paradise and its blessed inmates, the other resembling Hell and its wretched victims.\u00b9] Numerous priests and deacons, too, are stationed in this church, who\n\n\u00b9 See note on preceding page.\nread out the Evangelists, offer up prayers, and are engaged day and night in pious devotion.\n\nI next resolved upon setting out from Jerusalem and embarking by sea for Egypt; from whence I could repair again to Mecca; but the wind being contrary, the voyage was found to be impracticable. I consequently proceeded by land, and, after passing Ramlah, reached a city which they called 'Askal\u00e1n (Ascalon). It is an extensive town on the sea-shore, with a fine market-place and public place of worship. I noticed an old archway that was there, which they said had belonged to a mosque; it was a stone arch of gigantic proportions, insomuch that if any one wished to destroy it, he would have to expend unlimited wealth in order to effect its demolition. Journeying onwards, I came to hosts of towns and hamlets on my way, a full description of which would occupy too much time and space, and will therefore be curtailed. At length I arrived at a place called T\u00edb\u00edah, which was a seaport for ships, that used to sail from thence to Tinas.\n\n[This translation was made from a MS. in the possession of the Nawab Ziand-d\u00edn Kh\u00e1n of Loh\u00e1ru. Dr. C. Rieu kindly undertook to check and correct the translation by carefully collating the British Museum MS.

entrando en la casa\n\nLleg\u00f3 \u00e1 visitar \u00e1 Emina,\nHall\u00f3la tan sin pasion,\nTan disimulada y leda,\nQue en su rostro se juzgaba\nComo si nunca pariera,\nY viendola de tal

por la puerta,\nTop\u00f3 con un hombre armado,\nDesmejado en grandezas,\nCon una espada desnuda\nQue tremolaron sus venas,\nSus lados y sus junturas,\nY con voz horrible y fiera\nLe dijo: \"no pues

mas derecho en ellas\nPara criar \u00e1 Muhamad\nQue quantos esto pretendan,\nPareci\u00e9ndoles muy justo\nEn las razones que allegan,\nDec\u00edan: \"Nos lo criaremos,\n\nSi el Se\u00f1or nos da

The Canto of the Death of Muhammad, and then the Canto of the Day of Judgment, which were published first in this Journal on account of their superior merit, have their proper place between the Canto of the Surat of Alhamdu or the Fatiha, and the Canto of the Months of the Year. The portion of Rabadan's poem now given is not equal in poetical merit to other portions which have preceded it, perhaps for the reason given by Rabadan himself of the difficulty of tying down the verse to historical exactness. The number of Arabic terms with which this portion of the poem is loaded have also made it less good in this respect than other parts of the poem. Some of these, such as ydechea, or \"iza j\u00e0,\" are rather difficult to recognize, and others, as le ileha, show the extent to which Arabic pronunciation had become modified amongst the Moriscoes. There was a misprint in the portion first published, which it may be as well to correct. In the account of the death of the Prophet, Rabadan says that just before his death, he repeated \"that precious verse, Ikra bismi Rabika,\" and this was printed Y quera, bismi Rabica, Yquera or Ikra having been mistaken for the Spanish, \"Y que era, and which was.\"\n\n\u00b9 Del MS. de Paris: Concluy\u00f3 por la gracia de Dios.\nThe tradition as given by Rabadan represents the Prophet as ending his life uttering the same Surat of the Koran, with which he began to preach his mission.\n\nIn the Canto of the Months of the Year, our poet expresses a wish that he had, amongst other talents of famous authors and learned men, \"The speech of Catredata.\" I have been unable to ascertain who is meant by this name, the only suggestion that I can think of is Ibn al Kathir, one of seven masters of the science of reading the Koran.\n\nA rather large piece relating to the marriage of Muhammad and Khadija, and which is not in the London MS., has been extracted from the MS. of Paris; this is perhaps more generally interesting than any other part of the poem in this number. This portion, however, more than any of what has been already published, shows that the Moriscoes had preserved the tenacity of memory and tradition of the Arabs, for it is singular how exactly, even as to words and expressions, Rabadan follows the Arab authorities, since he himself says that he had no books, as the Inquisition had caused them to be lost; and had this not been so, his condition as a cultivator of the soil would have prevented his having any large access to books.\n\nIt is a cause of satisfaction that the publication of the entire poem of Rabadan has now been concluded, and that a work of such merit should have been rescued from oblivion. Whatever opinion may be formed of Rabadan's place amongst the poets, or of the philological value of a work written by one of the Moriscoes at the date of their expulsion from Spain, or of its value as a criterion of the intellectual status of the Moriscoes, it will be admitted that the publication of this poem has been a very fitting and suitable task for the Asiatic Society, on account of the ideas contained in it.\n\nFragments of Morisco Spanish translations of the Koran have for some time been known to exist in Spain, and quite recently a complete translation has been discovered.\n\nIf a copy of this translation can be obtained, and if the Council of the Society think fit, it may be published later in the pages of this Journal.\nthe same subject, and during the four years 1861\u201364, in which he held the appointment of Archaeological Surveyor of India, he travelled over the greater part of the countries traversed by Hiouen-Thsang, and visited most of the places mentioned by him in Northern India.\u00b9 With such local knowledge and advantages, it might be supposed that so practised an archaeologist as the General undoubtedly is, would leave few gleanings for those that came after him; but the results I have arrived at lead me to believe that the subject is by no means exhausted. The truth appearing to be, that we have followed two totally different systems in attempting to extract correct determinations from the brief descriptions of our traveller; and the question I really wish to put before the Society is, to determine which system leads to the most satisfactory results.\n\nThe mode of proceeding adopted by my predecessors may generally be described as trying to ascertain, by a careful and critical examination of existing maps, aided by local knowledge, where they suppose the place was which is mentioned by the traveller; and when that is found, neither of them hesitate to alter the text of their author, both as to direction and distance, in order that it may conform with this predetermined conclusion.\n\nThe system I have adopted is different from this. I have in all instances adhered literally to the statements in the Chinese works as presented to me.\u00b2 I have not in a single instance found it necessary to alter the texts beyond certain well defined and easily understood limits presently to be pointed out. By following this course I have been led occasionally to determinations which are\n\n\u00b9 The results of these researches were first published in four annual reports which General Cunningham sent to the Government of India, and were printed as they came to hand. The results were afterwards embodied by him in a work on the Ancient Geography of India, published by Tr\u00fcbner & Co., in 1871, which, as his maturest and last work, is the one that will be principally quoted from in the following pages.\n\n\u00b2 In order that there may be no mistake whether I am quoting literally or merely giving the sense of a passage, I have in all instances where the former was intended quoted the original French of the text. By doing this, I have also, I hope, avoided any difficulty that might arise as to the correct interpretation of any passage in the original.\nnot sanctioned by the names now found in Indian maps, but the result on the whole is so consistent and complete, that my impression is that it is the only safe system to follow. As, however, the conclusions it leads to are so widely divergent from those of my predecessors, I propose, in the following pages, to place their determinations side by side with my own, in order to give others a fair opportunity of judging between us. If my system is found to work well, it will be easy to apply it to the two remaining portions of Hiouen-Thsang's travels. The first portion\u2014namely, from the time of his entering the Caubul valley till he crosses the Ganges at Patna and enters Magadha\u2014will, I fancy, be found easy, not only from his having traversed portions of it, both in coming and going, but also from the number of well-known places he visited, and the minute descriptions he gives of them. But if I am not very much mistaken, it requires re-examination quite as much as the middle portion, with which only we are at present concerned.\n\nThe latter portion, which extends from the time he left Ballabhi till he returned to Nalanda, is more difficult. The journeys are longer, the descriptions shorter and less distinct, and the number of known sites far fewer than in the first portion. Besides this, it seems clear that he did not visit himself all the places he mentions, or at least not in the sequence in which they are entered in the works we possess. Notwithstanding all this, I feel convinced that great light would be thrown on the geography of Central India were this portion of his travels carefully re-investigated.\n\nPutting these two parts of his journeys aside for the present, I propose to follow Hiouen-Thsang stage by stage from Patna eastward to Kamarupa, and then southward to Kanchipuram, where he turned northward, and for the present shall part with him at Ballabhi. Such a journey, extending over upwards of 3000 miles, is quite sufficient to test his accuracy and the correctness of the principles on which we are proceeding, and traverses also so considerable a portion of the continent of India, that the results to be obtained from fixing its geographical features in the seventh century are so\nimportant\u2014if satisfactory\u2014as well to reward any pains that may be bestowed upon them.\n\nI cannot, of course, flatter myself that I have settled all the points in dispute, even in this limited portion of the travels of the Chinese pilgrims. I feel confident, however, that many that were before uncertain will not again be disturbed; but it is also only too apparent that many places will require personal examination and more local knowledge than is now available, before their position can be fixed with certainty. It is, however, a gain to geographical knowledge if we can limit the number of these, and point out to persons on the spot which those are that require this further investigation.\n\nBefore proceeding to details, it is necessary to say a few words with regard to the measures found in the text. That generally employed by Hiouen-Thsang is the li, which, according to the P\u00e8re Gaubil, is equal to 1080 English feet, and consequently 4\u00b788 li are equal to one English mile\u2014in round numbers say 5. As, however, owing to the sinuosities of the road and other circumstances, the traveller can hardly ever have gone mathematically straight, General Cunningham adopts 6 li as the average length of a mile as measured on the map. In this he is probably quite correct; but where, it appears to me, he makes a mistake, is, that he invariably uses 6 as a divisor, without reference to the nature of the country through which the traveller is passing. My impression is that where the country is perfectly open and cultivated, and where there is reason to believe a road may have existed between two points, it would be fair to use 5 as a divisor, thus making 100 li 20 miles, instead of 16\u00bd as he always does. Where, on the contrary, the Pilgrim describes the country as \"difficile,\" hilly or jungly, we may safely, I fancy, employ 7 or even more as a divisor when placing his route on the map.\n\nAnother source of error arises from Hiouen-Thsang in nine cases out of ten employing round numbers, 100, 500, 1000, 1500, and so on. While this is so, it is evident the\n\n1 329 m\u00e8tres, Si-yu-ki ii. 258.\nThe first chapter of the Platonic dialogue is the most famous part of the Platonic writings, being generally referred to as the \"Alcibiades.\" We have in mathematics a similar situation, but our modern interest centers not so much on the ancient tradition, a tradition which is now largely forgotten, as on the possibility of the future development of the subject. As there can be no doubt about the significance that is attached to this early stage of the development of the subject, we shall consider the nature of this stage in detail.\n\nIn the dialogue, Plato discusses the question of whether or not there exists a perfect number. He argues that such a number cannot exist because it would require an infinite amount of time to calculate. However, he does not provide any proof for this claim.\n\nPlato also discusses the concept of the \"ideal\" form of a thing. He argues that the ideal form is the perfect example of a thing, and that all other things are imperfect copies of this ideal form. This idea has been influential in many fields, including philosophy, art, and science.\n\nIn conclusion, the dialogue provides insight into the nature of mathematics and its relationship to other disciplines. It also highlights the importance of the ideal form in understanding the nature of things.\nAnother source of uncertainty, which it is always necessary to bear in mind, arises from the fact that the compass of the Chinese pilgrim has only 8 points. A place is either N., S., E., W. from another, or it is N.E., N.W., S.E., S.W. The points consequently are always 45 degrees apart; and even supposing the traveller knew with absolute precision that a place was 22 degrees N. or S. of E., he would be correct in describing it as E. If it were 23 degrees either way, it ought of course to be N.E. or S.E.; but as we have no reason to believe that they had any other means of ascertaining their direction than by the general appearance of the position of the heavenly bodies, it is impossible to expect any great degree of precision in this respect. This, however, is quite certain, that when they say E. or W., they never mean N. or S., or vice versa; and if they do say so, it may be put down as an error in the text. On the whole, however, it is marvellous how accurate Hiouen-Thsang is in this respect, and extremely difficult to understand how he arrived at such precision without better means of observation or better maps than we have reason to believe then existed.\n\nThe great cause, however, of uncertainty or error in following the route of the Chinese travellers arises from the proper names of places which they employ. To a certain extent this is caused by Hiouen-Thsang, for instance, having to translate Sanskrit names into Chinese, and M. Stanislas Julien having to translate them back from the Chinese into their Sanskrit originals. This, however, he has done so successfully, that though it sometimes is a cause of uncertainty, it rarely, when grappled with, leads to error. A far more pregnant cause of difficulty arises from the fact that Indian cities, like Indian kings, frequently bore many aliases. As Sir Henry Maine well observes,\u00b9 \"Great deserted cities often in close proximity to one another\"\u2014and he might have added each bearing a different name\u2014\"are among the most inexplicable of Indian spectacles.\" What was the town or name of one century is not that of the next or of the preceding; and when from any cause a community\n\n\u00b9 Village Communities in the East and West, p. 119.\nIn the case of the names of the places we have discussed in this chapter, there are no overwhelming reasons for the use of the capital name of the country, especially in cases where the capital name is not used at all. In such cases, the capital name is often used for its own purposes; but a final decision is not made until a final vote takes place in the town hall.\n\nA list of all the names is also included in this chapter, which will help us find the names of the places we have discussed in this chapter. It is likely that the names of the places we have discussed in this chapter are not used at all, or they are used only in certain contexts. However, it is a fact that a final list of all the names that the names of the places in this chapter are used in the context of the country. It is important to keep track of the places as they change. It is also a common practice for travel and tourism to visit England, Scotland, and Ireland, and we want to make sure that we give a fair chance to those places that are visited by tourists. It is also a common practice for tourists to visit these places in order to see what the places look like and to experience them in their natural environment. It is also a common practice for tourists to visit these places in order to experience them in their natural environment.\n\nFrom these places, we can easily find the names mentioned by Edward Gibbon in his present image, or anything else that was used when the locations and distances were first used in the country with almost absolute certainty. When we do find the names agreeing, it is of course a very satisfactory confirmation of our views; but in the absence of any evidence that a normal discrepancy or\ndeficiency should be considered as decisive either for or against any particular locality being the one visited by our author.\n\nNotwithstanding these apparent sources of error, I hope to be able to show in the following pages that there is not a single stage in the Pilgrim's progress that cannot be fixed with very considerable certainty. Except within the limits of deviation for bearings and distances pointed out above, and which are obviously inherent in the subject from its very nature, I have not found it necessary to suggest a single alteration in the text of my author. Not that I mean to say that the text is absolutely free from error. There are occasional discrepancies between the Si-yu-ki and the Hoei-li, which prove that one or other of them must be wrong; but as it happens\u2014at least in the part of the journey which we have selected\u2014that we are in all instances able to discover how the discrepancy arose, and to correct the one from the other, this is no cause of uncertainty for the present.\n\nPatna to Gaya.\\(^1\\)\n\nI shall dwell a little more in detail on the first journey on which we shall have to accompany the Pilgrim than it will be necessary to do in future, because it illustrates the above preliminary remarks to a greater extent than any subsequent stage in his progress. It ought to be one of the simplest and easiest. The termini are perfectly well known. The distance between them 62 miles in a direction slightly to the west of south. The country then, as now, a richly cultivated plain, and the road unobstructed by hills or large watercourses or forests.\n\nGeneral Cunningham's account of this journey is as follows:\\(^2\\) \"On leaving Pataliputra, the Chinese Pilgrim started from the S.W. corner of the city, and proceeded for 100 li, or \\(16\\frac{2}{3}\\) miles, to the south-west, to the Monastery Ti-lo-shi-kia or Ti-lo-tse-kia (Tiladaka), from whence he continued his route in the same direction for 90 li, or 15 miles, to a lofty\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Si-yu-ki, i., pp. 439\u2013456. Hoei-li, p. 139.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ancient Geography of India, pp. 455, 456.\nmountain, from the summit of which Buddha had contemplated the kingdom of Magadha. He then turned to the north-west, for 30 li, or 5 miles, to visit a large monastery on the slope of a hill where Gunamati had worsted a heretic in argument. Then resuming his S.W. route for 20 li, or 3\u00bd miles, he visited an isolated hill, and the monastery of Silabhadra; and continuing in the same direction for 40 or 50 li, 7 or 8 miles, he crossed the river Nairanjana, and entered the town of Gaya.\n\n\"Before attempting,\" he adds, \"to identify any of the places noted on the route, I must observe that there are several errors, both in the bearings and distances, that require to be corrected. As the direction of Gaya is very nearly due south of Patna, the several S.W. bearings must certainly be altered to South. The several distances also, when added together, amount to 230 li, or 38 miles, while the actual distance between the cities of Patna and Gaya is 60 miles by the high road, and must have been about 70 by the road followed by Huen-Thsang. The sum of his distances is therefore above 200 li, or 33 miles, short of the actual distance travelled. This amount I would divide into two even sums of 100 li, and add one to each of the first two distances recorded by the Pilgrim.\"\n\nThe first remark I would make on this statement is that the General's distances, if added up, make 280 or 290 li, and consequently 46\u00b76 or 48\u00b73 miles, instead of 38, as he states; but even then, as this is short of what is required, there is evidently an error somewhere, for which he was justified in proposing a remedy: but it certainly is a very strong measure to suggest two equal errors of 100 li each, in two consecutive stages of so simple a journey. The motive of this is evident: by so doing he takes the Pilgrim to Till\u0101ra, which sounds something like Tila\u00e7aka, which he persists in calling this monastery, though M. Julien calls it Tila\u00e7akya. And, again, to alter arbitrarily all the S.W. bearings to South could only be justified by the most manifest impossibilities of there being other modes of reconciling the facts. One thing at all events is evident, that if Hiouen-Thsang's text is so corrupt as to\nrequire such manipulation in so short a distance, it is no use going further with it, for no satisfactory conclusion can possibly be arrived at from it.\n\nWe naturally turn therefore to the earlier commentator, to see how he reconciles these discrepancies. At page 373 of the M\u00e9moire Analytique we find the following table:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Distance |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| De Pataliputra \u00e0 un Vih\u00e2ra ruin\u00e9 au sud-ouest                              | 200 li.  |\n| De ce couvent au Vih\u00e2ra Tila\u00e7\u00e2kya au sud-ouest                             | 100 li.  |\n| A une grande montagne au sud-ouest                                        | 90 li.   |\n| Au Couvent de Gounamati au nord-ouest                                      | 30 li.   |\n| Au Couvent de \u00c7ilabhadra bati sur une montagne au S.O.                     | 20 li.   |\n| \u00c0 la ville de Gaya, apr\u00e8s avoir pass\u00e9 la rivi\u00e8re Nairanjana, au sud-ouest | 40 \u00e0 60 li. |\n\n480 \u00e0 490\n\nOr ............ 80 to 82 miles.\n\nAnd he proceeds to remark that the monasteries of Tila\u00e7akya and \u00c7ilabhadra probably represent Th\u00e9lari and Bhad\u00e9ra of Rennell's map, which is possible if Hiouen-Thsang had been travelling S.E. instead of S.W., and if the distances had been correctly reported. The real difficulty is where M. de St.-Martin got the 200 li at the head of the table. Turning to the Si-yu-ki, we find the following words (p. 439), \"\u00c0 environ deux cents pas de l'angle sud-ouest de la ville, on voit les restes des fondements d'un couvent,\" etc.; and then \"au sud-ouest de l'ancien couvent il fit environ 100 li, et arriva au couvent de Tila\u00e7akya.\"\n\nAt first sight one might be inclined to accept this explanation. It is possible that if we had the original Chinese before us, we might find li written instead of paces, were it not that when men are making a journey of 30 or 40 miles, they do not reckon from a particular angle of a city they are leaving, especially when they are quoting distances in round numbers; but when a building is close to the city, it is natural to state what angle or what gateway it may be near, in order that it may be recognized. The truth of the matter is, it is an oversight\u2014a mislection on the part of M. de St.-Martin; and does not consequently help us in our difficulties. Though, as there evidently is an error somewhere in the account of this journey in the Si-yu-ki, we might\naccept this provisionally till some better explanation were obtained, had there been no other means of solving the difficulty.\n\nAs, however, the last-named author, by a lucky accident, got over the chief difficulty of the passage in question, it is no wonder he did not look further; but it is remarkable that General Cunningham, being fully aware of the discrepancies, neither referred to his predecessor nor to the Hoei-li to see if they could throw any light on the matter. Had he referred to the latter, he would have found the following passage (p. 139), \"Apr\u00e8s avoir ador\u00e9 pendant sept jours tous ces monuments sacr\u00e9s (\"de P\u00e2talipoutra poura\"), il fit au sud-ouest sept y\u00f4djanas, et arriva au couvent de Tila\u00e7\u00e2kya.\" \"De l\u00e0, il fit cent li au sud, et arriva \u00e0 l'endroit ou s'\u00e9levait l'arbre de l'intelligence (B\u00f4ddhidrouma).\"\n\nThe first distance mathematically is 43 miles, but with a slight allowance for the road not being straight, 40 miles, which is the exact distance on the map of the Barabar hills, in which the celebrated caves are situated, the oldest rock-cut Vih\u00e2ras, so far as we know, in India. The direction is South 18\u00b0 West, which, though not absolutely correct, is within the limits of deviation above stated; and, lastly, these hills are due north, and just 100 li, or 20 miles, from Buddh Gaya, where the tree is found. There is a third bearing which General Cunningham points out, but on which I do not place much reliance. Some seven years after this time, on his return to Nalanda, Hoei-li relates his visit to the Convent of Tilataka (Ti-lo-tse-kia) (p. 211) instead of Ti-lo-chi-kia (p. 139). They may be the same, but I doubt it, and know no other instance of the same name being spelt differently in the same volume. Admitting, however, that they are identical, the hills are exactly 22 miles West by South from Nalanda, so that this, though stretching a little the three y\u00f4djanas of the text, would rather be a confirmation than otherwise. Be this, however, as it may, I conceive that the distance and direction which Hoei-li says the Pilgrim travelled from Patna to Barabar, and the distance and direction of Buddh Gaya, quite sufficient to prove that this was the place visited. When there he uses an expression which is curiously sug-\ngestive. The convent was poor and decayed, there were only \"quelques dizaines de religieux qui ayant appris l'arriv\u00e9e du Maitre de la loi, vinrent tous \u00e0 sa rencontre et lui servirent des guides,\" we may add, to visit the caves and other antiquities of the place, which, according to General Cunningham's own description, were both numerous and important. Unfortunately our traveller does not describe them. To us they are extremely interesting in an archaeological point of view, but there was no legend attached to them, they were not the residences of Buddha or any of his immediate followers, and he consequently passes them by, as he does other groups of caves he must have seen or been in the neighbourhood of, in the most contemptuous manner.\n\nThe subsequent stages in this journey enumerated above bring out a point which it is necessary to bear in mind, in order to explain the differences that sometimes occur between our two authorities. Hoe\u00ef-li, writing the life of Hiouen-Thsang, only enumerates the journeys he took himself. The Si-yu-ki, being a description of India, often enumerates places he never visited personally. In this instance, as in most cases, we are warned of this by the substitution of \"on\" for \"il.\" Thus (p. 440) it is said, \"A environ 90 li au sud-ouest du couvent de Tila\u00e7\u00e2kya, on arrive \u00e0 une grande montagne,\" etc. And so with the next stage. At the third, the expression is, \"Le voyageur arrive.\" All showing incontestably that none of these places were visited by the Pilgrim himself. It is consequently needless to attempt to follow him; and in fact there are no great mountains where this route and distance would place them. I believe there would be no great difficulty in pointing out what places were intended, and think I could do so myself, but it must be done at the expense of disregarding to a great extent the hearsay accounts which our author retails of places he never saw himself. As we are at present only trying to investigate the routes which Hiouen-Thsang himself traversed, such inquiries can have no place here.\n\n1 Report to Government, 1861\u20132, pages 16 to 21. At page 20, General Cunningham twice expresses his astonishment that Hiouen-Thsang should not have visited these caves. His attention being therefore drawn to the subject, it is curious he should have overlooked these facts.\nBuddh Gaya to Nalanda.\n\nOnce settled at Gaya, the Pilgrim set himself assiduously to visit all the consecrated spots that cluster around that sacred city of the Buddhists; and his descriptions and directions are so minute and detailed that, when combined with those of Fa-Hian, I have no doubt that every locality can be determined with certainty and precision. The distances, however, are generally so short, and the latitude that must, as mentioned above, be allowed for compass bearings so great, that the task can only be attempted by some one on the spot possessing minute local knowledge. Indeed, without much more detailed maps than are at present available, it is impossible to express an opinion whether the determinations which have already been published are correct or otherwise; and I shall not therefore attempt to follow them, especially as it is of very little consequence for our present purposes. They are important from a religious point of view, but not geographically; and though consequently it would be interesting to those tracing out the history of the Buddhist religion that they should be definitively settled, this does not bear directly on our present investigation. I propose therefore to follow the example of Hiouen-Thsang himself, and go straight from Buddh Gaya to Nalanda, without turning to the right or left, or stopping to look at any of the antiquities on the way, reserving that, as he did, for another occasion if it should ever occur.\n\nAlthough nothing at all resembling the name is to be found on any map ancient or modern, and no trace of a tradition of what the place once was exists among the present inhabitants of Behar, the site of the once famous monastery of Nalanda is now as well known as that of Patna, Gayn, or almost any city in Bengal. Kittoe was, I believe, the first to suggest that the Nalo of Fa-Hian might be Nalanda; but as Hiouen-Thsang's Travels were not then trans-\n\n1 Hoci-li, p. 143.\n2 Vide Buchanan Hamilton's account of this place in Eastern India, vol. i., p. 95.\nlated, he did so timidly, and without being able to prove it.\\footnote{J.A.S.B., 1847, p. 956.} Vivien de St.-Martin fixes it without hesitation at Baragaon, 7 miles north of R\u00e2jagriha,\\footnote{Ancient Geography, p. 468.} and the subsequent researches of Cunningham\\footnote{Ruins of the Nalanda Monastery, by A. M. Broadley, Esq. Calcutta, 1872.} and Broadley\\footnote{Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 382.} have settled the matter beyond all shadow of doubt.\n\nHoei-li reports the distance between these two places to be seven y\u00f4djanas, or the same as between Patna and the Tila\u00e7\u00e2kya monastery; and it is satisfactory to find that both measure exactly 40 miles on the sheets of the India atlas. As, owing to the intervention of the hills, the road in the second instance could hardly have been so straight as in the first, it is probable the latter route absorbed the 4 or 5 miles it was mathematically entitled to; but the two being practically identical, shows that these are no random measurements, but based on some sound geographical data.\n\nDuring his five years' residence (Hoei-li, p. 171) at Nalanda, Hiouen-Thsang visited Old and New Rajagriha, and all the sacred spots that crowd around them. So minute are his descriptions, that, combined as before with those of Fa-Hian, it is quite certain that every one of them may be identified with certainty, perhaps have been; but, like those of Buddh Gaya, they are not geographical, and do not consequently come properly within the scope of this paper. New Rajagriha is perfectly well known, and is marked on all our maps; and the old city, the capital of Adjatasatra in the time of Sakya Muni, is easily distinguishable by its circle of five hills, which are minutely described by both the Chinese travellers.\\footnote{Fa-Hian, chap. xxviii. Hoei-li, p. 153. Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 28 et seqq.} Only one point regarding it seems worth mentioning here with reference to what we shall meet with further on. The original name of the city was Kousoumapoura; but when either Bimbas\u00e2ra or Asoka\u2014it is not clear which\u2014transferred the capital to the banks of the Ganges, on their being sufficiently consolidated to admit of this being done, he transferred the name also\\footnote{Si-yu-ki, i., p. 413. Hoei-li, p. 153.} to a city\nwhich, either before or since, was known by the name of \"Patalipouttra poura,\" or \"ville du fils de l'arbre Po-tch'a-li,\" whatever that may mean. The fact, however, that concerns us here is, that in the same province we have two capitals bearing the same name, and though of course the one was meant, and probably at one time did supersede the other, throughout the Chinese travels it is the old town that generally retains the name, though it certainly was later applied to Patna, both by Buddhist and Brahmanical authorities.\\(^1\\)\n\n**Nalanda to Hiranyakaparrata.**\n\nAlthough as usual there is nothing in this name to indicate it, there seems no doubt but that Monghir was the name of the capital of the kingdom of Hiranyakaparvata. Both M. de St.-Martin and General Cunningham are agreed on this point, and I see no reason for doubting that they are correct, though I differ from them at every stage of the route\u2014except the first\u2014by which the Pilgrim reached this place.\n\nLeaving Nalanda, he makes the following short stages (p. 51 et seqq.):\n\n- To Koulika, the native place of Moudgalaputra........... 8 to 9 li, S.W.\n- To Stupa of Bimbas\u0101ra........................................ 3 to 4 li, E.\n- To Kalapinaka, the birthplace of Sariputra ............... 20 li, S.E.\n- To Stupa of Sariputra's disciple......................... 4 to 6 li, S.E.\n- To Indrasilaguh\u0101 .............................................. 30 li, E.\n\nIf these distances with the directions indicated are protracted on the sheets of the Indian Atlas, they lead inevitably to that remarkable group of hills which terminates the range extending from Gaya to the river Panchana, in a northeasterly direction. Hiouen-Thsang's description is so detailed that General Cunningham had no difficulty in fixing the position of every place mentioned, and identifying Indrasilaguh\u0101 with Giry\u0113k, which is the spot to which the above bearings and distances conduct us. \"Les cavernes (he says, page 58) et les vall\u00e9es de cette montagne sont t\u00e9n\u00e9breuses; des bois fleuris la couvrent d'une riche v\u00e9g\u00e9tation.

Ancient Geography, p. 463.\n\\(^2\\) Si-yu-ki, ii., pp. 51\u201364. Hoei-li, pp. 161\u2013175.\nDans une caverne du pic m\u00e9ridional il y a une grande maison, taill\u00e9e dans le roc, elle est large et basse.

In chapter xxviii. he says, \"From this city (Patna), proceeding in a south-easterly direction nine y\u00e2janas, we arrive at a small rocky hill standing by itself, on the top of which is a stone cell (\"une maison de pierre,\" Fo\u00eb-kou\u00e9-ki) facing the south. On one occasion, when Buddha was sitting in the middle of this cell, the Divine Sekra proposed forty-two questions to Buddha, writing each one of them singly with his finger upon a stone. The traces of these questions yet exist.\"\n\nFrom these extracts it seems quite evident that the small rocky hill, with its little stone cell, which Fa-Hian visited, was a very different place from the lofty double-peaked mountain of Hiouen-Thsang, with its great natural cavern, and was in fact the rock of Behar. This is described by Buchanan Hamilton in the following terms. \"At Behar an exceeding rugged rock projects from the plain, but all the remaining country is level, and the southern part inundated.\"\n\nGeneral Cunningham's description is equally distinct. \"To the north-west of the city\" (of Behar), he says, \"there is a long isolated hill, having a precipitously steep cliff on its northern face, and on the southern face an easy slope in\n\n---\n\n1 Travels of Fah-Hian and Sung-Yun. Translated by the Rev. S. Beal. London, 1869. pp. 110, 111.\n2 Montgomery Martin's Reprint, vol. i., p. 85.\nsuccessive ledges of rock. The hill is now covered by some Musulm\u00e2n buildings, etc.\"\u00b9\n\nThese evidently now occupy the site of Fa-Hian's cell facing the south, as, from the whole tenor of the description, it can hardly be doubted that this is the place he describes. The direction from Patna is correct enough, but the distance is excessive. In reality it is only 34 miles as the crow flies, but he makes it 9 y\u00f3djana, or 54 miles, if we use the same multiplier as for Hiouen-Thsang. I am inclined to think that 5 miles, or even less, must frequently be taken to represent a y\u00f3djana of this traveller, and unfortunately even then we can never depend on his long distances, as we can on those of his successor. Even if all this were not sufficient, the next two journeys he made are sufficient to show that Behar was the place intended. From thence he went one y\u00f3djana south-west to the village of Nalo, which he makes the birthplace of Sariputra; and again, \"going west from this one y\u00f3djana, we arrive at the New Rajagriha.\"\n\nIf Nalo is Nalanda, as is generally supposed,\u00b2 there is an end of the question; it is situated between six and seven miles south-west from Behar. But if this is so, there are two errors in Fa-Hian's statement. Nalanda was not the birthplace of Sariputra, but some place 3 or 4 miles to the southward of it; and Rajagriha is not west, but due south from Nalanda, though the distance\u2014one y\u00f3djana\u2014is correct enough. But there is another way of looking at it. The distance from Behar to Rajagriha is 12 miles, and the direction south-westerly, and we may assume that he went, say, 8 miles to Sariputra's Stupa, and followed the same or a more westerly direction for 4 miles more to Rajagriha. The latter appears to me the most probable solution of the difficulty. I cannot understand any man calling the glorious Nalanda a village, and for reasons given in my previous paper,\u00b3 I feel convinced that before the beginning of the fifth century, it was then in all its glory. Nor can I believe that had he gone there he\n\n\u00b9 Report to Government, 1861-2, p. 14.\n\u00b2 Kittoe, loc. cit. Vivien de St.-Martin. Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 382. Cunningham, p. 469.\n\u00b3 J.B.A.S. Vol. IV. (n.s.), p. 116.\nwould not also have visited the birthplace of Mogal\u00e2na. There may have been fifty personal reasons why he should pass by Nalanda without visiting it, but none that I can suggest, why, if he did go there, he should speak of it as he did. Be this as it may, I fancy it is quite certain that Behar was the site of the \"petite montagne du rocher isol\u00e9,\" and that he travelled generally in a south-westerly direction from it to Rajagriha. It seems equally certain that during the two centuries and a half which had elapsed between his time and Hiouen-Thsang's, the tradition of the forty-two questions had got transferred from the northern to the more southern locality.\n\nThis description of Fa-Hian's route rises to a certainty when we follow him a little further. Leaving New Rajagriha, he enters the valley to the south, visits the old town, and at 15 li from it describes the hill Gridhrak\u00fb\u1e6da, \"three li from the top is a stone cavern facing the south. Buddha used in this place to sit in profound meditation.\" \"In front of the cave are spots where each of the four Buddhas sat,\" etc.\u00b9 In fact, as General Cunningham adds, \"Both the Pilgrims mention the cave on the southern face of the mountain, which corresponds exactly with the natural cavern Gidha-dwar, which I have already described.\" But he fails to remark that Fa-Hian had made three journeys between the small isolated hill where the forty-two questions were solved, and this Vulture-cave or Indra Sila Guha.\u00b2\n\nSo far, therefore, there is no discrepancy between the routes of the two Pilgrims. Whichever hypothesis we follow with respect to the identification of Fa-Hian's Nalo with Nalanda, there is certainly no doubt about Hiouen-Thsang's\n\n\u00b9 Beal, Fah-Hian, pp. 114\u2013115. Ancient Geography, p. 473.\n\u00b2 In a paper communicated to the \"Indian Antiquary\" (No. i., p. 18, et seq.), Mr. Broadley clearly enough perceives General Cunningham's mistake in this matter, and points out that Fa-Hian's \"isolated rock\" was that in the town of Behar. But, curiously enough, he quotes the distance from Patna (9 y\u00f4djanas) as 54 miles, and therefore quite correct. The real distance is 33 or 34, and this was General Cunningham's principal reason for taking it to Giry\u00ebk. Mr. Broadley also states (p. 19) the exact distance from Baragaon to Giry\u00ebk at 6 miles. It is more than 9. Notwithstanding these mistakes, he is right on the main point, though he fails to perceive all the discrepancies between his and Cunningham's determinations which his correction involves.\nroute between Nalanda and Gridwara cave, where they again meet. The one apparent difference is that in the beginning of the fifth century, the tradition of the forty-two questions was attached to the structural cell on the Behar rock. In the middle of the seventh century, it had got transferred to the Giry\u00f6k hill. If, as Fa-Hian says, \"each one of them was written singly with his finger on a stone,\" their transference could be a matter of no great difficulty.\n\nThough all this may now be clear enough, as a general rule Fa-Hian's bearings and distances are so little to be depended upon, that it is with pleasure we turn back to his more accurate successor, and follow him in his Eastern travels. Leaving Giry\u00f6k (p. 61), \"Au nord-est de la montagne Indra\u00e7ila gouha, il fit 150 \u00e0 160 li, et arriva \u00e0 un couvent appel\u00e9 Kap\u00f4tika Sangh\u00e2rama\"\u2014and he then goes on to say, \"\u00e0 deux ou trois li au midi du couvent de la Colombe (Kap\u00f4tika Sangh\u00e2rama), on arrive \u00e0 une montagne isol\u00e9e, qui est extr\u00eamement haute, et qu'ombrage une \u00e9paisse for\u00eat. Des fleurs renomm\u00e9es couvrent ses bords et des sources d'eau pure se pr\u00e9cipitent dans la vall\u00e9e. Sur cette montagne il y a une multitude de Vih\u00e2ras et des Temples divins. Dans un Vih\u00e2ra plac\u00e9 juste au centre, on voit la statue de Avalok\u00eete\u00e7vara,\" etc.\n\nThis evidently is a very different place from the isolated rock at Behar, as described above; but fortunately, at the distance ranging from 19 to 25 miles north-east from Giry\u00f6k, there is a range of hills called the Sheikhpoora hills, which answer this description in the minutest particulars, and as both the distance and direction are absolutely correct, there can be no doubt that they are those described by the Pilgrim. From the statue above mentioned, he proceeds 40 li, 6\u00bd miles, to a nameless convent situated on the plain,\u00b9 but as we have neither name nor local feature, its exact position can only be ascertained by its bearing from this and the next place he visited. In the text it is said, \"au nord-est du couvent il fit environ 70 li; puis au midi du fleuve Gange, il arriva \u00e0 un grand village.\" \"\u00c0 une petite distance au sud-est de cet endroit il y avoit un grand st\u00f4upa,\" etc.\n\n\u00b9 General Cunningham says \"on an isolated hill,\" p. 472, but this is a mistake.\nFrom this it is evident we have arrived at the great southern bend of the river near Luckiserai, and for the present at least I am inclined to fix this place there, as, in a private letter to Mr. Thomas, General Cunningham states that he has found numerous ruins close to the railway station in that village. The bearing and distance accord perfectly with the situation of the nameless convent, but till that is fixed, if it ever can be, by its ruins being found, the last station may be moved a few miles either way, if any sufficient indications are found to render this necessary.\n\nThe next journey is described in a manner that leaves no doubt as to its direction\u2014\"En partant de ce pays il entra \u00e0 l'est dans des for\u00eats et des gorges des montagnes, fit environ 100 li, et arriva \u00e0 un couvent du village R\u00f4hin\u00eela.\" \"\u00c0 deux ou trois li au nord de ce monument (a Stupa just described), on rencontre un grand lac, qui a environ 30 li de tour\" (p. 64). From this description there can be no doubt that Rohinila was situated among the Kuruckpoor hills, which rise from the plain immediately to the eastward of the Luckiserai village, though we have nothing but the distance and bearing to guide us in fixing its position with exactness. There is a cold spring in the hills marked on the Indian Atlas sheets about 17 miles east from Luckiserai, and a hot spring about 2\u00bd miles further south, either of which is a likely enough locality, but no lake. Lakes indeed are about the rarest features in Indian geography. It may have silted up in 1200 years, or it may have been artificial, and then if the bund broke it would disappear; but I feel convinced that if looked for, traces of it would be found.\n\nOne more journey concludes this section\u2014\"A l'est de ce lac, il entra dans des for\u00eats et des gorges de grandes montagnes, fit environ deux cent li, et arriva au royaume de Hiranyakaparvata.\" At first sight it might appear as if it was intended to say that he went 200 li to the eastward of the lake. The expression, however, is not the usual one, as quoted in the previous and other journeys, and the fair translation appears to me to be, He entered into the forests and passes, which exist to the eastward, or on the east side of\nthis lake, and proceeded about 200 li\u2014he does not say in what direction\u2014to Hiranyaparvata. The distance also may appear a difficulty. From the hot spring above mentioned the distance to Monghir as the crow flies is only 20 miles. But Monghir may very well have been situated 4 or 5 miles further north than it now is; and if there ever was a case in all these travels in which one would be justified in using a large divisor in turning li into miles, it is when the Pilgrim was entangled in the jungles and among the hills of Kuruckpoor. The great facts, however, are that the Rohinila monastery was certainly situated at some distance in the Kuruckpoor hills; and the smoking hills and volcanic phenomena noticed by the Pilgrim certainly indicate the immediate proximity of Monghir as the site of the capital; so the exact distance and direction in this instance become less important than usual; but both, as appears to me, are well within the limits of deviation pointed out above.\n\nHaving now shown how this journey may be protracted on the map without altering one bearing from what is found in the text, or one distance by a single li, and, what is more important still, showing that the whole is in the strictest conformity with all the natural features of the country, it is time to turn back and see what results are produced by the system followed by my predecessors.\n\nM. Vivien de St.-Martin first identifies Hiouen-Thsang's Indrasilaguha with Behar, and having made this mistake, passes lightly over the rest of the journey, merely stating that though it is possible to follow the Pilgrim in a general manner, the intermediate stations cannot be identified, till we reach Rohinila, which he finds in the Roynallah of Rennell, at the southern bend of the river\u2014not far from Luckiserai\u2014but certainly not in the hills where Hiouen-Thsang places it.\n\nGeneral Cunningham enters more into detail. From Indrasilaguha or Giry\u00fck, he first takes him to Behar, though for this purpose he is obliged to alter the bearing from N.E. to due North, and the distance from 160 li to 60. But even supposing these admissible, it seems impossible that the bare isolated rock there could ever represent the extensive hill\ncovered with forests, from which streams flow into the valleys, and which was covered with Vih\u00e2ras and temples, as described by our author. If this was the place, however, there is no objection to Titar\u00e2wa being the nameless convent;\u2014\"the isolated hill\" being wholly a difficulty of the General's own creation. But the next journey is quite inadmissible. To reach the Ganges to the north-west, he is obliged to alter 70 li to 170, and then he only reaches a village, in which he has no interest, in order to turn south-west again to get round to the southern bend of the river. Had he ever been at Titar\u00e2wa, he evidently would have gone east direct. But from this village to Rohinila, regarding the site of which he agrees with M. de St.-Martin, he is again obliged to alter the bearing from E. to S.E., and, what is more important, takes him through a country where there neither are nor were either hills or forests. If he were correct in reading the direction of the last journey as E., it must again be altered to the North-east, which is the more correct direction of Monghir from that place.\n\nThe capital defect however in this, as too frequently the case in General Cunningham's determinations, is, that though he twice arbitrarily alters the distance, and three times the direction given by his author, even in this short distance, he fails in every instance to bring the natural features of the country into accord with the descriptions of the Pilgrim.\n\n*Hiranyaparvata to K\u00e2marupa.*\n\nThe first stage Hiouen-Thsang reaches and describes is Champa, at a distance of 300 li, or 50 miles. It is assumed by General Cunningham, and I think correctly, as some place near Bhagulpur, though if this is so, the distance, as in the last stage, is greatly in excess of the truth. In the text the words are, \"Il suivit la rive m\u00e9ridionale du Gange, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait environ trois cents li \u00e0 l'est, il arriva au royaume de Tchampa.\" The road still follows the south bank of the\n\n---\n\n1 Si-yu-ki, i. pp. 71\u201381.\nGanges, but the distance from Monghir is only about 36 miles instead of 50. Either it is that Monghir was, as I conjectured in the last section, situated 4 or 5 miles further north, or that the Ganges bent further south between these two places, or perhaps both causes combined may account for the difference. General Cunningham relies a good deal for his identification on an expression of our author a little farther on (p. 72), where he says, \"A 140 \u00e0 150 li \u00e0 l'est de la capitale, et au sud du Gange, on voit une montagne isol\u00e9e, que l'eau environne de toutes parts et dont les pics escarp\u00e9s ont un hauteur extraordinaire. Sur le sommet de cette montagne, il y a un temple des dieux. On a creus\u00e9 des demeures dans les flancs de la montagne, on a amen\u00e9 des cours d'eau et l'on a form\u00e9 des \u00e9tangs. On y voit des bocages fleuris et des arbres rares. Ses larges rochers et ses cri\u00e9es effrayantes servent d'asyle \u00e0 des hommes renomm\u00e9s par leur humanit\u00e9 et leur sagacit\u00e9.\" This he identifies with the Colgong rocks, situated eastward of Bhagulpur at about the distance indicated, and I am not prepared to say it may not be so. But on the whole I am inclined to think the description answers much better to the Mandar Hill, which is situated some 26 miles to the south of the Ganges, though certainly not to the east of the capital. But as our traveller did not himself visit the place, neither the distance nor direction can be depended upon. It may also be remarked that it is extremely improbable that Hiouen-Thsang should allude in this chapter to a place he was going to pass in the next. I do not recollect any other instance of his so doing. As the next journey to Kadjoughira\u2014which I take to be Rajmahal\u2014is called 400 li, or say 66 miles, is much more difficult and jungly, and is actually by the road 63 or 64 miles, I should certainly be inclined to disregard the Colgong distance, and look for the capital to the eastward or southward of Bhagulpur. As in almost all instances our author does not give us a hint of what the name of the capital may have been, so it is in vain to look to our maps for any assistance in this respect. It is true that in Rennell's\n\n---\n\n1 Francklin. Inquiry concerning the site of Palibothra, part ii., pp. 13, 26, 72, 78. Babu Rasbihari Bose. Indian Antiquary, part ii., p. 51, et seqq.\ntime there were two large and important places called Champernagur and Champerpore, near Bhagulpore, but situated to the westward of that place, and neither of them having apparently any claim to antiquity or ancient renown. It is interesting, no doubt, to find the old name of the country still clinging to the soil, but it is curious to observe how transient even such things are in the East, for no such names are now to be found in the far more detailed sheets of the Indian Atlas;\u2014another proof among many how little nominal similarities are to be depended upon in this inquiry. There is no evidence whatever to show that Champa was the name of the capital, and the absence or presence of that name on our modern maps is the merest accident, and, when it occurs, merely shows that the old name of the country still lingers among the inhabitants.\n\nFrom this place, wherever it was, our Pilgrim proceeded about 400 li to the eastward to Kadjoughira. The distance, as above mentioned, would fit exactly for Rajmahal; but General Cunningham (p. 479) makes the distance 90 miles, or 540 li, which surely is a mistake;\u00b9 he must mean to Kankjol, a place 18 miles further on, which, from the similarity of the name, he identifies with Kadjoughira, though I confess I do not see it. Both he and M. de St.-Martin, however, are agreed that Rajmahal, or some place very near it, was the terminus of this stage. M. de St.-Martin notices a village called Cudjery, near where Cunningham places Kankjol, or about 16 miles below Rajmahal. It may be so, but I have no faith in these names, when there are no ruins or other indications to back them; and I feel quite sure that no village situated where this one is could last for a couple of centuries without being washed away.\n\nLooking at the distance given by Hiouen-Thsang, the object of his visiting this neighbourhood, which was to get direct to Poundravarddhana, and the probability of the\n\n\u00b9 Both the road and the railroad follow the course of the Ganges, and so far as I know, the former always has done so. The distance between Rajmahal and Bhagulpur being by the one 63, by the other 66 miles. I am not aware of any practical road ever having existed through the hills, and if our traveller had got entangled in these impenetrable jungles, I feel sure he would have mentioned it.\ncountry about and below Gaur being a swamp 1200 years ago, I fancy the place must be sought for either at Sicligully or Rajmahal, or somewhere between these places. As its fixation, however, has little bearing on the geography of this part of the country, its exact determination may be left to future research.\n\nThe next two journeys are all important to the geography of North-eastern Bengal, and fortunately they are about the clearest and most easily fixed of any in the Itinerary of Hiouen-Thsang. The words in the text are, \"En partant de ce pays, il passa \u00e0 l'est le fleuve Gange, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait environ 600 li (100 miles), il arriva au royaume de Poundravarddhana\"; and again, \"en partant de ce royaume (Poundravarddhana), il fit environ neuf cent li (150 miles) \u00e0 l'est, passa un grand fleuve, et arriva au royaume de K\u00e2mar\u00fbpa.\"\n\nThe first bearing and distance would take us nearly to Rungpur, as the country was open and cultivated, probably quite so. It may have been a little to the north or south of that place, but could not have been far away from it. The river he passed in his next journey was without doubt the Brahmaputra. It is the rarest thing possible for him to mention rivers, and never unless they are very important, and such as the two mentioned in these two journeys. The direction was again east, and at the distance of 150 miles exactly, he would reach Gowhutti, or Gohati, which is, and, so far as we know, always was, the capital of Kamrup, a province still marked on our maps, and as well known as any in our empire. Here for once, therefore, we have a place situated 250 miles east\u2014in the sense indicated above\u2014from Rajmahal, in reaching which he would have to cross two\n\n---\n\n1 Six centuries afterwards we find from the Mahomedan historians that the city of Gaur was divided into two parts. One half, called Laknauti, was situated on the right or western bank of the river; the other, Deo Kote, on the left bank, near where the present city stands. The first may therefore represent the city we are looking for, and if so, it could not have been far from Rajmahal.\n\nFrom the same authorities we learn that the sovereign of that day erected or repaired bunds extending for ten days' journey from Nagore, in Birbhum, to the city of Deo Kote, to protect the country from inundation, and also to form a road for travellers through a country which was otherwise an impassable swamp during the rainy season.\n\n* Stewart's History of Bengal, p. 57. Sir H. Elliot, Historians of India, ii. p. 318.\ngreat rivers, and which, for reasons to be given presently, undoubtedly was the place indicated.\n\nThough this appears to me so absolutely certain, I am bound to admit that it is by no means the view taken by my predecessors. M. de St.-Martin, attracted by the Sanskrit name of Burdwan, neglects his statement that he crossed the river, and takes him south from Rajmahal instead of east to that place; though, as General Cunningham points out (p. 480), the proper name is not Varddhana, but Varddhamana. The direction, the description, and the name, all show that this could not be the place; but having got so far wrong, he does not recover his lost ground till the Pilgrim leaves Bengal.\n\nGeneral Cunningham does not do such violence to his text. He takes the Pilgrim across the Ganges; but fancying he detects a similarity between the words Pubna and Pau\u1e47\u1e0dra, he takes him south-east instead of east: though if he knew Pubna and its neighbourhood as well as I do, he would know that two centuries would be a very long life for a city in that neighbourhood. Some centuries hence the country in that neighbourhood may be sufficiently consolidated to admit of a town being built so near the banks of the Ganges as Pubna is; but in the past this certainly was not the case, and the site of that village must have been under the bed of the Ganges at least half a dozen times in the last twelve centuries. But the one proof necessary in this place is, that having got him here, by no stretch could he reach Gohati, though the General admits (p. 500) that that was the capital of Kamrup. He is therefore obliged to take him due north\u2014instead of east\u2014to Komatipur, the whilom capital of Kooch Behar, which may have been the capital of a province of Kamrup, but never of the kingdom. But the worst part is, that having gone due north, he is obliged to return due south by the same route, through Pubna to Jessore, which he identifies with Samatata, the next stage. This, however, is a thing Hiouen-Thsang never did; and it is evident that if he had been going to visit Komatipur, he would have gone there direct from Rajmahal,\u2014the distance is only 110 miles; and\nthence on to Pubna, thus saving himself a journey of 1500 li, and seeing the only two places he wanted to see, by two long journeys instead of three.\n\nIt is of course in vain to look on the maps of the present day for any name, or probably for any ruins, that would indicate the site of the once famous capital of Eastern Bengal. Even in the beginning of this century, Buchanan Hamilton complains that \"since the survey made by Major Rennell (20 years before his time), the rivers of this district have undergone such changes that I find the utmost difficulty in tracing them.\"\u00b9 And the recent Topographical Survey shows how unresting they have been since his day. Few districts of India have in fact been more ploughed up by its rivers than Rungpur. Even Komatipur, which in his day was so important as to induce Buchanan Hamilton to transgress his instructions in order to visit it, has almost entirely disappeared. In his day its walls were so complete, that he could make a careful plan of them,\u00b2 and of the ruins they inclosed. There was nothing ancient in the place, and the presence of a glacis shows that the fortifications were erected subsequently to the introduction of gunpowder. The name is not now to be found on the district maps, though some small earthworks near a place called Kaleegunj probably mark the site, though with no more dignified title than \"Native School\"; and Lall Bazaar, which in Rennell's time was the next important place in the neighbourhood, has now dwindled into so small a place, that it can with difficulty be recognized.\u00b3\n\nStill I would not despair of its site being found if any one\n\n\u00b9 Montgomery Martin. Eastern India, iii., p. 358.\n\u00b2 l. c. ii., pl. 1, p. 426.\n\u00b3 In the fourth volume of the Oriental Quarterly Magazine, published in 1824, there is an account of Pundra Desa, abstracted from the Brahmananda section of the Bhavisya Purana. Among the divisions of that country therein specified, is one called Nivritti, and said to comprise Dinagpur, Rungpur, and Cooch Behar (p. 190)\u2014consequently the whole of the Eastern half of Hiouen-Thseang's kingdom of Poudravarddhana. Its chief towns are said to be Verdhamo Kuta, which may be the very town we are looking for, but then governed by a Yavana or Musselman; Kachhapa, on the banks of the Guru or Teesta river; and Sriranga or Viharica, where the women are remarkable for flat noses. This last was no doubt the capital of Kooch Vihar, or Behar; but whether Komatipur or not, there is nothing to show:\u2014most probably it was.\nintimately acquainted with the district would earnestly undertake the search, and it would be interesting if its site could be fixed, as we know from the Raja Tarangini,\\(^1\\) that more than a century after Hiouen-Thsang's time, it was the capital of the country between the Koosy and the Brahmaputra, and till such time as the banks of the Ganges about Gaur became so consolidated as to allow of a permanent city being built there, probably about the tenth century. T\u00e2ran\u00e2tha too represents it as the capital of the P\u00e2la dynasty;\\(^2\\) and as one of the most important cities of India, and its fixation would consequently be a gain in every respect.\n\nWith regard to Gohati, there can be no mistake. In his paper on Assam, Captain Dalton\\(^3\\) gives the following account of its present appearance: \"Mr. Robinson, the Commissioner, has assumed that Gowhutty was the ancient, as it is the modern, capital of the valley. Its former importance is indeed well attested by the immense extent of its fortifications, the profusion of carved stones which every excavation of the modern town brings to light, the remains of stone gateways, and the old stone bridges that are found both within and without the old city walls. These walls, partly of masonry, embrace a tract several square miles in extent.\" Captain Hannay, too, gives a view of one of the bridges, like all the rest, constructed without arches, on the horizontal principle.\\(^4\\) It is so grand and so old, that I see no good reason for doubting but that Hiouen-Thsang may have passed over it.\n\nBesides all this, the Pilgrim's own description will apply to no other country than this. \"A l'est de ce royaume r\u00e8gne une cha\u00eene de montagnes et de collines; on ne rencontre aucune capitale de grand royaume. Ses fronti\u00e8res sont voisines des Barbares du sud-ouest\" (the Garrows). \"J'ai appris qu'apr\u00e8s un voyage de deux mois on peut entrer dans les fronti\u00e8res sud-ouest du pays de Chou.

More might be added, but this is sufficient to show that so far at least as Gohati the route of the Pilgrim may be determined with certainty.\n\nFrom Kamrup to Kalinga\u00b2.\n\nThe next route and country are described in the following terms in the Si-yu-ki. \u201cEn sortant de ce pays (K\u00e2mar\u00fbpa), il fit 1200 \u00e0 1300 li au sud, et arriva au royaume de Samatata. Ce royaume a 3000 li (500 miles) en circonf\u00e9rence. Il est voisin d\u2019une grande mer, et de l\u00e0, vient que le sol est bas et humide.\u201d Although Hiouen-Thsang visited both Kamarupa and Samatata, as we shall presently show, it was on two different occasions, and though it is so asserted in the text, he never made the journey in question. If he had, he probably would have described it as at least one half longer, as he could hardly have crossed the Kossyah hills, but must have first gone east to Goalparah, and then south. But taking it as we find it, it lands us at Sonargaon, or some place very near that city, which preceded Dacca as the capital of this province. For this and other reasons, I have no doubt but that the district or province of Dacca is the kingdom described as Samatata in our text. It must 1200 years ago have been close to a great sea. Its soil is low and humid, but curiously enough we have evidence that it must have included a portion at least of the hill country of Tipperah. In the Gupta inscription of the Allahabad l\u00e2t, in the nineteenth line, it is said that the king (Samudra Gupta) exacted tribute from the neighbouring (outlying?) hilly countries of Samata, Taravakra, Kamarupa, Nepala, etc.,\u00b3 an\n\n\u00b9 Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 80. \u00b2 Si-yu-ki, pp. 76 to 91. \u00b3 J.A.S.B. vi., p. 973.\nepithet which quite takes it out of the vicinity of Jessore, but answers perfectly to this site, to which we will return presently.\n\nThe next journey has been the stumbling-block to all previous inquirers; and if we are to attach any importance to names, I see no way of reconciling Hiouen-Thsang's narrative with the facts of the case. It is described in the following terms: \"En partant du royaume de Samatata, il fit environ 900 li \u00e0 l'ouest, et arriva au royaume de Tamralipti. Ce royaume a de quatorze \u00e0 quinze li de tour (240 mile). Il avoisine les bords de la mer; le sol est bas et humide,\" etc. From its name, and this description, it has always hitherto been assumed, that the place indicated was the modern Tumluk, on the Rupnarain river, and I am not prepared to dispute that the name may not be the modern representative of Tamralipti, though I by no means consider that as certain. Other derivations have been suggested,\u00b9 and for other reasons, I should decline to be guided by any nominal similarities, even if more certain than this one.\n\nBesides all this, it is by no means clear that Tamralipti was the name of the capital or of any city whatever. The district was so called, but the capital may have borne the name of one of the Satgaon or seven villages, or of Hugli, or more probably of Tribani or Triveni; from the fact of the three rivers which met at Pryaga or Allahabad\u2014the Bhaugarutti, the Jumna, and the Saraswati\u2014again meeting at this spot, and forming the lower, as that formed the upper, sacred spot of junction. There is every reason for supposing that this tradition is old, and the name may consequently be so also. Hugli was always reputed to be one of the principal seats of learning in Bengal, and consequently just such a spot as Fa-Hian may have settled himself in, to study for a couple of years;\u00b2 but that he ever should have resided for such a length of time in so pestiferous a swamp as Tumluk is, and always must have been, is most unlikely.\n\n\u00b9 Hunter's Orissa, i., p. 311.\n\u00b2 Travels, translated by Beal, p. 147. His remark indeed is nearly final on the controversy, for he says, \"Here it is that the river (the Ganges) empties itself into the sea,\"\u2014the same remark that was made by the Ayeen Akbari, and no way applicable to Tumluk.\nPutting the name therefore aside for the present, what our Pilgrim says is, that from Samatata (the hilly Samata), he travelled 900 li, or 150 miles, west, and reached the small state of Tamralipti. By no possibility can this be stretched to Tunluk, which is at least 200 miles from Sonargaon, and by the way the Pilgrim must have travelled considerably more; but it exactly fits Satgaon, near Hugli, which was the great port of Bengal when the Portuguese and English first visited India. It was the highest point to which the depth of water and the flow of the tide would allow sea-going vessels to reach, and consequently was, as in almost every instance in the world, where a port is situated on a river, the spot chosen for the establishment of an emporium, where the sea-borne and inland traffic could meet. The above woodcut will show what our early navigators thought of its situation. The map is worthless in every other respect, except as showing that the mouths by which the Ganges flowed into the sea were considered to be situated at Satgaon. The\nAyeen Akbari confirms this to the fullest extent. It is there said, \"The main river in its course south forms three streams\u2014the Sursutty, the Jown (Jumna), and the Gang (or Ganges). The three streams collectively are called by the Hindous Tirpunny. The Gang, after having divided into a thousand channels, joins the sea at Satagong, and the Sursutty and Jown discharge themselves in like manner.\" If this was the case about A.D. 1600, it must have been doubly so 1000 years earlier, and there can be no doubt but that Satgaon, as well as Sonargaon, were situated on bays of the sea, and that the latter was the great port of what we now know as the Bengal province.\n\nWhen we look carefully at Hiouen-Thsang's text, however, we find we want two great ports, Tamralipti and Tcharitrapoura. It was apparently at the former place that he got the information he details about Ceylon, and determined in consequence to proceed through Orissa, and by land. But further on, when in Orissa, he describes the second place in the following terms: \"Sur les fronti\u00e8res sud-est du royaume (of Orissa), et pr\u00e8s du rivage d'une grande mer, on rencontre la ville de Tcharitra, dont la circonf\u00e9rence est d'une vingtaine des li. C'est l\u00e0 que passent et s'arr\u00eatent en allant et venant les marchands qui s'embarquent, et les voyageurs des contr\u00e9es lointaines.\" The question is, where was this Orissan port? Tumluk is now in the district of Midnapur, but that district was always, down to Akbar's time, a part of Orissa, and indeed there is evidence that frequently the frontiers of Orissa extended up to Satgaon and Tribany, and it seems impossible to find room for Hiouen-Thsang's kingdom of Orissa, 7000 li in circumference, without taking its northern frontier up at least to Serampur: in modern times it has extended to Satgaon itself.\n\nWhere then was this Orissan port of Tcharitrapoura? It\n\n---\n\n1 Gladwin's translation, ii., p. 5.\n2 I am afraid it is impossible to found any argument on the position assigned by Ptolemy to \"Tamlitites.\" The name may be the same as Tamralipti, but calculating the distance from Palibothra, his latitude and longitude would place it near Moughir. Perhaps we may infer from this that his informants described it as distant from the sea, but that is as much as we dare.\n3 J.A.S.B., 1847, p. 394 et seqq.\ncertainty was not in the Chilka lake, not only because there is no tradition and no trace of a port there, but because it is in the north-west, not south-east, of Orissa. It also seems more improbable that any of the barred rivers between the Chilka lake and the Hugli river could be the port indicated. From the nature of the shore and the set of the current they all must have been thwarted at their mouths. It is true, of course, that in the early part of the last century the English had factories at Balasore and Piggly; but it was because from political motives the Mughal denied us the privilege of entering the rivers, and the Balasore roads form a safe enough anchorage during six months of the year for European-built vessels, with European ground tackle. But that the frail boats of the natives should ever use such an open roadstead, with such a wind-beaten shore to their leeward, is most unlikely, especially, when by drifting with a single tide, they might anchor in safety in so snug and land-locked a harbour as Tumluk, and one so centrally situated; for it was then in the very centre of Orissa, and it could easily communicate by the Saraswati Sarsuti, with Satgaon and the rivers of Bengal. If this is so, Tumluk was certainly Techaritapura,\u00b9 and not Tamralipti.\n\nIf these views are correct, the insight they give us into the river-system of Lower Bengal is so curious, that though not strictly relevant, it may be worth while to mention it here. It appears that in Hiuen-Tsang's days Tamralipti was situated at the head of an estuary where the main waters of the Ganges joined the sea; but where also one branch called the Saraswati, or Sursutti, on which Satgaon was situated, branched off to the right, and, flowing in a southern direction, joined the Rupnarain at or near Tumluk. At that time, as we know from Rennell's maps and local indications, the Damuda joined the Hugli, or rather the sea above Satgaon; but as the land rose, it was gradually forced southward, and it may be 500, it may be 1000 years ago, cut\n\n\u00b9 The description given by Mr. Hunter in his \"Orissa\" leaves no doubt but that Tumluk was an important city in ancient times, and certainly represented one of these two places.\nacross the Sursutty, and apparently threw a dam across it, which it is quite capable of doing. The Sursutty consequently silted up, and it is then, I fancy, that the inhabitants of Tamralipti (or Satgaon) migrated southwards to Tcharitrapoura, taking their name with them. When the Hugli became a river, instead of an estuary, and consequently suited for the frail craft of the natives, it again became the popular means of communication, and Satgaon resumed the supremacy we find it possessing in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nBe all this as it may, the next journeys our Pilgrim makes seem in themselves sufficient to prove the correctness of the hypothesis that Tamralipti was situated at or near Satgaon. From this country \"il fit environ 700 li (116 miles) au nord-ouest, et arriva au royaume de Karna Souvarna. Ce royaume a 4400 \u00e0 4500 li (700 miles) de tour. La population est fort nombreuse, et toutes les familles vivent dans l'aisance. Le sol est bas et humide. Les grains se sement et se r\u00e9coltent \u00e0 des \u00e9poques r\u00e9guli\u00e8res, les fleurs y viennent en abondance, ainsi que les fruits les plus rares et les plus estim\u00e9s,\" and so on in the same strain.\n\nNow, if Tumluk is Tamralipti, the distance and direction here given would take us far into the jungles of Singbh\u00fbm, which is in fact where General Cunningham places this city, and takes occasion to describe the manners and customs of the Kols, and M\u00fbndas, and other savages who inhabit these wild tracts, all which are widely at variance with Hiouen-Thsang's description, who says, \"Les m\u0153urs sont douces et pures, les habitants aiment et cultivent les lettres, ils suivent au m\u00eame temps l'erreur et la v\u00e9rit\u00e9.\" Assuming, however, that Satgaon, or some place near it, was Tamralipti, the distance and bearing given above would take us to Nagore, or some place in Northern Burdwan or Birbh\u00fbm, and there every word becomes applicable. Burdwan, with part of Birbh\u00fbm, is the garden of Bengal, and the most populous of its provinces, and it is precisely at Nagore,\u00b9 or some place\n\n\u00b9 From the authorities quoted above, p. 26, it is evident that Nagore was a place of importance in the 13th century, and that it was then necessary to protect it by embankments against inundation.\nnear it, that we should look for the capital, which afterwards, when the river banks became sufficiently consolidated, was moved down to the neighbourhood of Murshidabad where we now find it. The kingdom of Karna Souvarna, I take it, comprehended the northern part of Burdwan, the whole of Birbh\u00fbm, and the province of Murshidabad, including all those parts of the districts of Kishnaghur and Jessore which were then sufficiently raised above the waters of the Ganges to be habitable.\n\nThe only other mention our traveller makes of this kingdom is when he relates, \"A cette \u00e9poque (605 A.D. ?) Sasanka, roi du royaume Karna Souvarna, dans l'Inde orientale, disait chaque jour \u00e0 ses ministres. Quand dans le voisinage il y a un roi sage, c'est le malheur du royaume. L\u00e0 dessus il l'attira perfidement dans un rendezvous et le tua.\" Placed where I have placed it, Karna Souvarna was contorninous with the dominions of the great Magadha dynasty, and consequently such a transaction became possible. With another kingdom, or a less powerful and civilized monarch, it would be most improbable.\n\nFrom Karna Souvarna, \"il fit 700 li (116 miles) au sud-ouest, et arriva au royaume de Ou\u00e7a. Le royaume a 7000 li (1155 miles) en circonf\u00e9rence; le sol est gras et fertile, et donne des riches moissons. Toutes les esp\u00e8ces des fruits y sont plus\n\n---\n\n1 In a paper by Captain Layard, in vol. xxii. of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, it is stated, at p. 281, that the town of Rungamutti, situated 12 miles south of Murshidabad, stands on the site of an old city whose name was Kuru-sona-ka-ghur, which is evidently the modern Bengali translation of Karna Souvarna-Nagara. The two first words at least are quite certain, and they are those which are important in the present case.\n\n2 In the extracts from the Bhavisyat Pur\u00e2na, in the 4th vol. of the Quarterly Oriental Magazine, above referred to, it is said (p. 191), \"In that part of the district of Virabhumi called Viradasa is the city Nagara (Nigora), also Sipulya, and other towns. On the western borders, among others, the village of Suverna di, and on the southern confines towards the Odra country is Kinda Vishna. Suverna-mah\u00e2ya is in the forest,\" etc. From this description it is hardly probable that either of these Suvernas is the one we are looking for; but it is curious to find the name Suverna twice repeated in this small district, where, from Hiouen-Thsang's indication, we would place it. The passage is also curious in bringing up the frontiers of Odra or Orissa so far north. In the following page (192) Vridhhamana, or Burdwan, is distinctly described, and according to our usual notions it intervened between the two; but the compiler of the Pur\u00e2na places Birbh\u00fbm and Odra in juxtaposition, as Hiouen-Thsang does.\n\nAs, however, Murshidabad was built (p. 189) when the Pur\u00e2na was written, the old capital was deserted, and probably removed bodily to the new; so we should not be surprised at its not being mentioned.\nabondant que dans les autres royaumes,\u201d etc., much in the same terms as he speaks of the last kingdom, except that he adds, \u201cLes m\u0153urs sont farouches, et leur langue et leur prononciation different de celles de l\u2019Inde centrale.\u201d\n\nTaking the bearing and distance as we find it in the text, it would land us in the district of Midnapur, somewhere to the westward of the city of that name. I am not aware of any ruins, or any tradition, that would point to any locality in that direction as the capital of Orissa in the seventh century, but it has not been looked for, and may yet be found.\u00b9 Meanwhile the general opinion is that Jajipur, on the Byturni, was chosen the capital of the Kesari kings of Orissa in 473.\u00b2 It may have been so, but two centuries is a long life for an Indian capital; and as Midnapur was a part, and the best part, of Orissa down to Akbar\u2019s time, nothing is more likely than that the capital, or a capital, was situated in this central situation when Hiouen-Thsang was there. Indeed, if we may trust the annals at the very time of his visit, Lelat Indra Kesari (A.D. 617 to 657) was busily employed in founding a new capital at Bhuvaraneshwar, and erecting there the great temple, which is the finest as well as the oldest temple of its class we know of. He was, however, a bigoted Sivite, and it is not likely that Hiouen-Thsang would go near him or his new capital, but would be content with any old one he met in his way.\n\nFrom this place, wherever it was, \u201cil fit environ 1200 li au sud-ouest au milieu des vastes for\u00eats, et arriva au royaume de Konyodha. Ce royaume a environ 1000 li (166 miles) de tour; il est voisin d\u2019une baie, les montagnes et les collines sont fort \u00e9lev\u00e9es, le terrain est bas et humide. Les fronti\u00e8res de ce royaume embrassent plusieurs dizaines des petites villes, qui touchent \u00e0 des montagnes, et sont situ\u00e9es au confluent des deux mers.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Beames, it is true, has recently discovered and described *the remains of several ancient cities in this district which were hitherto unknown. Neither from their size nor position do any of them seem to answer to our Pilgrim\u2019s description, but their existence goes far to show that others may be found when looked for.\n\n\u00b2 Asiatic Researches, xv., p. 265. Hunter. Orissa, i.\n\n* Indian Antiquary, ii., p. 38; iii., p. 75; viii., p. 354.\nFrom the description of the difficulties of the route as mentioned in the text, it is evident that by no means too large a divisor to take in converting li into miles; and Khordhaghar, in the neighbourhood of Bhuvaneswar, is just 170 miles south-west from Midnapur, and I think it is impossible to mistake the Chilkea lake as the great bay and the two seas of the text. The Pilgrim's remark that the people \"montrent un grand respect pour les h\u00e9r\u00e9tiques, et ne croient point \u00e0 la loi de Buddha,\" indicates the proximity of the great Sivite shrine. But it may also be that he stopped here, as he did between Patna and Gaya, to visit the caves in the Khandagiri and Udayagiri hills, which are an undoubted Buddhist locality, though, as on the former occasion, he passes them by in silence. Their position would also answer sufficiently to the distances given in the text.\n\nWherever the capital may have been,\u2014and we have certainly no trace of it yet,\u2014I take it as nearly certain that this small kingdom was situated to the northward of the Chilkea lake, and somewhere between Kuttack and Asoka, where one of Asoka's great edict tablets still exists.\n\nLeaving Konyodha, both authorities state, \"qu'il fit au sud-ouest de 1400 \u00e0 1500 li, \u00e0 travers des for\u00eats vastes et sauvages, et arriva au royaume de Kalinga.\" From this description of the country, it is evident we must use a large divisor in converting the li into miles. Taking 7, which is certainly not a bit too much, this would give 200 to 216 miles; while the distance from Kuttack to Visianagram, which seems the most important place in this district, is 220 miles as the crow flies. If, however, we adopt Khordhaghar as the capital of Konyodha, or Cicacole (Siricola), as the capital of Kalinga, as General Cunningham seems inclined to do, we may cut off from 20 to 30 miles from either end of our route, without in the least disturbing the conclusion that the capital of Konyodha was situated not far from Kuttack, and that of Kalinga not very far either from the Kalingapatam of our maps.\n\n1 J.l.A.S. xx, p. 105.\n2 Ancient Geography, p. 516.\n3 I am rather inclined to adopt General Cunningham's suggestion that Coringa\nLooking at Hiouen-Thsang's description of the last, and the nature of the country he must have passed through on his next route, I confess I would feel inclined to look for the capital further inland some 20 or 30 miles from the coast; but we know so very little regarding that country, that it is impossible to arrive at any certainty: and as very little hangs upon it, the determination of the exact spot is one that may safely be left for future investigation. The bearing and distance give the whereabouts of the capital with sufficient exactness for our present purposes.\n\nIn following these two last journeys, we again become aware of the inextricable confusion introduced into the narrative by adopting Tumluk as the representative of Tamralipti. M. Vivien de St.-Martin quotes Hoe\u00ef-li as saying the distance from Tamralipti to the capital of Outcha (Orissa) was 700 li (p. 389), and General Cunningham repeats this statement, though from the mode in which he does so, he shows he is aware that he has only M. de St.-Martin's authority for it. No distance is given by Hoe\u00ef-li as above stated, and the 700 li in the Si-yu-ki from the capital, is measured from Karna Souvarna. Having, however, got so much too far to the south, though General Cunningham is most ingenious in his explanations how the distances quoted may be shortened (p. 513), he is obliged to carry the Pilgrim on to Raja Mahendri, on the Banks of the Godavery, before he turns north-west to K\u00f4sala, to return by an almost parallel road to Danakach\u00eaka. This, on the very face of it, is most improbable, and there seems nothing to support the idea\n\nis the Calingon of Pliny, but not for the same reasons. He states that \"in book vi. ch. 23, Pliny states that the distance of this place from the mouths of the Ganges, is 625 Roman, or 574 British miles, and then that Dandagula must be Dantapura, and may with much probability be identified with Raja Mahendri, which is only 30 miles N.E. of Coringa,\" etc. I find in the 20th chapter of book vi., \"Ab ostio Gangis ad Promontorium Calingon et oppidum Dandagula dccxxv., m. pas.,\" 725, instead of 625, and certainly to the town as well as to the promontory, so it is impossible to add 30 miles without violence to the text. Nor can I admit the nominal similarity between Dandagula and Dantapura is worth anything, as taking the scene so far south would violate every probability of the narrative of the Danta dhatu wanso. It could not, as I read the story, be further south than Puri, and I miss the passage which says that Dantapura was situated on a great river. Notwithstanding all this, we come to the same conclusion with regard to the promontory, because I measure from Satgaon, he from Saugur.\nThe Kalinga and its capital were so far south. M. Vivien de Saint-Martin, with more boldness, adopts the only course that really was left open to him. He adopts the Kalinga-system of the maps as the Kalinga of the Chinese Pilgrim\u2014in which I have no doubt he was nearly right\u2014and throws overboard in consequence the measurements by which the Pilgrim reached it as \"tr\u00e8s forte,\" p. 395, and consequently unworthy of attention. By placing Tamralipti at Sargata, all these difficulties might have been avoided.\n\nHaving now conducted our Pilgrim beyond the limits of the Bengal Presidency, it will be well to turn back to notice a discrepancy that exists between Hoe\u00ef-li and the Si-yu-ki, and which, if not capable of explanation, might throw discredit on the whole.\n\nIn the Hoe\u00ef-li, or life, the Pilgrim does not visit Kamarupa at all; but leaving Poundravarddhana, we find the following entry: \"De l\u00e0 il fit (il fit) au sud-est, et arriva \u00e0 Karna Souvarna,\" and further on, \"de l\u00e0 il sortit au sud-est, et arriva au royaume de Samatata, qui est voisin d'une grande mer.\" From this his route to Tamralipti is in the same terms as in the Si-yu-ki, from which it is said, \"Le ma\u00eetre de la loi se dirigea au sud-ouest\" (no distance given), et arriva au royaume de Ouda,\" p. 184.\n\nThe first part of this discrepancy is easily explained. In the great journey from Nalanda to Sinhala, he did not visit Kamarupa. His visit to that place was subsequent to his return to Nalanda, when he was induced, at the pressing invitation of Kumara, to visit the Assamese capital (Hoe\u00ef-li, pp. 227-236). Although, therefore, the Si-yu-ki was quite correct in using the expression \"il fit,\" it was in 642, and not in 639, that he made this journey. On the first occasion of visiting Poundravarddhana, he turned to the south-east to visit Samatata. But by a curious mistake, Hoe\u00ef-li inserted Karna Souvarna between the two places. It does not seem difficult to see how this arose. In the notes from which the Si-yu-ki was compiled, there was a place inserted between the two, and Karna Souvarna got substituted instead\nof Kamarupa, either by the original author, or by some subsequent editor; but immediately afterwards the mistake is confessed, as no distance is mentioned between Karna Souvarna and Samatata.\n\nIn like manner, when he leaves Tamralipti, Hoe\u00ef-li could not make him go to Karna Souvarna, he had already used that place, but takes him at once to Orissa\u2014south-west: but again omits the distance. These, I believe, are the only two instances in which distances are omitted between important places, and they show clearly that the author perceived there was something wrong; but if we take Karna Souvarna out of the position assigned to it in Hoe\u00ef-li\u2019s text, and put it in Northern Burdwan, where, for the reasons above given, I believe it certainly was, all becomes clear. From Rungpur he goes 900 li, 150 to 160 miles, S.E. to Samatata. This bearing and distance bring us again to the neighbourhood of Sonargaon; so the site is fixed by a regular triangle, that would warm the heart of a trigonometrical surveyor. Rungpur was 150 miles from Gohati, and Samatata was 200 miles south of Gohati, and 160 miles south-east from Rungpur; so its position, when taken with the other indications above mentioned, may be considered settled within very narrow limits.\n\nBefore leaving Samatata, Hiouen-Thsang mentions six Eastern kingdoms, which, if it were possible to identify, would add considerably to our knowledge of the early geography of these countries. The first-named, \u00c7richatra, which is mentioned in the following terms, \u201cEn partant de cet endroit (Samatata) dans la direction nord-est sur le bord de la mer, entre des montagnes et des vall\u00e9es, on rencontre le royaume de \u00c7richatra.\u201d (H.L., 182.) If the direction is correct, this can only apply to Sylhet; but in that case the word translated \u201cmer\u201d must mean \u201clac\u201d: for though a great part of that district is still occupied as immense jeels,\n\n---\n\n1 If my boundary lines between the different kingdoms are correct, Hiouen-Thsang must have passed through a corner of the country of Karna Souvarna on his way between Poundravardhana and Samatata, which may account for the mistake, but he certainly did not approach the capital on that occasion.\nin spite of the quantities of mud which the Brahmaputra has been pouring into them down till about fifty years ago, still it is hardly probable\u2014though by no means impossible\u2014that the tide may have penetrated as far as Sylhet 1200 years ago, so that the low land of that district may have been really an arm of the sea. Though incapable of proof at present, even this hypothesis has so much probability about it, that it is worth inquiring into. He then goes on to say, \u201cPlus loin sur une baie situ\u00e9e au sud-est, on trouve le royaume de K\u00e2m\u00e2l\u00e2nk\u00e2.\u201d \u201cPlus loin \u00e0 l\u2019est se trouve le royaume de D\u00e2r\u00e2pati.\u201d If Mr. Wathen is right in asserting that Dvaravati and Meghavati are Sandowy and Cheduba,\u00b9 the first name must represent Chittagaon and the kingdom of Arrakan, and the second the kingdom of Prome; and Isanapura, which is next mentioned as still further to the East, must be Pegu. The fifth is Mahachampa, under which name we have no difficulty in recognizing the ancient kingdom of Cambodia, whose wonderful temple ruins have recently excited so much astonishment in this country.\u00b2 Beyond this, Hiouen-thsang says, \u201c\u00e0 l\u2019ouest\u201d (the Si-yu-ki, \u201cau sud-ouest\u201d) lies \u201cYama na dwipa,\u201d which can only mean Java, though the direction is sadly at variance with the truth. As none, however, of these countries were personally visited by our author, all he says about them must be received with great caution.\n\nIt is interesting to compare this with the account of the same countries given by Taranatha, a Tibetan author, writing about 1600 A.D., but professing to describe the state of affairs a little after Hiouen-Thsang\u2019s time from ancient authorities. \u201cThe northern lands,\u201d he says, \u201cKamarupa, Tripura, and Hasama (Assam?), are called Girivarta, viz. \u2018hill-inclosed.\u2019 From thence going eastward on the side of the northern hills, are the Nangata lands (Nagu?), and lying in the ocean Pukhan (Pugun), Balgu, and so on. The land Rakhang (Arrakan), Hamsavati (Pegu), and the other portions of the\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. iii., 213.\n\u00b2 History of Architecture ii., p. 713 et seqq. Garnier\u2019s Exploration du Mekon, i.

All these are comprehended under\nthe general term Koki.\"\u00b9\n\nEven this does not help us much, but it is worth quoting,\nas the early geography of these countries is now attracting\nattention; and if a search were made, I have little doubt but\nthat many such passages might be found: and it is only by\ncollecting all such, and placing them in juxtaposition, that\nthe truth can be ascertained.\n\nBefore leaving Bengal, it may be as well to glance back-\nwards, and see what the results are which we have obtained\nwith regard to the geography of Bengal in the seventh century.\n\nOn the extreme north-east we have the kingdom of\nKamarupa, occupying the whole valley of Assam, fertile as\nit still is, but then rich and prosperous, in strange contrast\nto its present depopulated and uncultivated condition.\n\nTo the westward of this we have the kingdom of Poundra-\nvarddhana, occupying the country from the Koosy to the\nBrahmaputra, east and west, and on the south bounded by\nthe Ganges, if that river did then flow south-eastward to\njoin its great sister, which I very much doubt; occupying, in\nfact, the whole country afterwards known as the kingdom or\nprovince of Gaur.\n\nSouthward from Kamarupa we have Samatata, occupying\nthe province now known as that of Dacca. Then the whole of\nthe western half of the Province of Bengal practically divided\nbetween the two kingdoms of Karna Souvarna and Orissa;\nthe former occupying the whole of the province of Murshid-\nabad, extending eastward as far probably as Komeerkally,\nand westward to the boundaries of Behar, and southward to\nthe Damuda; and Orissa extending from the northern limit\nto the Chilkea lake, to the boundaries of Karna Souvarna.\nBetween these two was interpolated the little kingdom of\nTamralipti, occupying the district of Hugli, and small parts\nof Burdwan and Kishnaghur, and such portions of Baraset\n\n\u00b9 Geschichte des Buddhismus in Indien, p. 262. Translated by Schiefner. (St.\nPetersburg, 1869.)\nas were then habitable, which was probably not much; and lastly we have the little kingdom of Konyodha, occupying the tract of country between the Chilkea lake and the hills.\n\nSuch a condition of things is not only in accordance with every expression of Hiouen-Thsang, but satisfies every tradition and every indication which we gather from the antiquities and other sources of information that are available to us.\n\nThe hydrographic results are equally curious. I dare not venture to affirm that the Sylhet jheels were then actually salt, and in direct communication with the sea; but it seems by no means impossible that such was then the case. It is certain, at all events, that Sonargaon and Satgaon were at the head of two firths or estuaries, into which the Brahmaputra and Ganges then emptied themselves; and it is nearly certain that the whole of the Delta south of a line drawn between these two places was a great salt-water lagoon. This, however, we gather as much from the progress that has been made in filling it up since Rennell's survey, as from Hiouen-Thsang's description; but the one confirms the other in a most satisfactory manner. My impression is that the Sunderbuns then existed but as a reef\u2014a Lido\u2014in front of this lagoon, and that the Ganges did not then go eastward to join the Brahmaputra, but discharged itself into this lagoon, as the Ayeen Akbari says, \"through a thousand channels.\"\n\nKalinga to Danakach\u00e9ka.\u00b9\n\nFrom Kalinga our Pilgrim \"fit environ 1800 li (Hoe\u00ef-li), (1900 Si-yu-ki), au nord-ouest, et arriva au royaume de K\u00f4sala.\" At the usual average of 6 li to 1 mile, this is 300 to 316 miles. The shorter distance would take us exactly to Wyraghur, the longer to within 10 miles of Bh\u00e2ndak, about 18 miles N.W. of Chanda.

Buddha) on the latter hill, the Temple of Bhadr\u00e1vat\u00ed, the site of the king's palace, the bridge over the now dried-up lake, the outlines of forts on the two hills just mentioned, and numerous ruins of tanks and temples, proving the existence of a great city in the far-distant past.\"\n\nThis description, combined with the distance and bearings, both to and from this place, so fully satisfies the exigencies of Hiouen-Thsang's narrative, that I would be quite content to leave the question there, but that another solution occurs which is so curious and interesting, that it certainly is worth mentioning here.\n\nWhen Fa-Hian was at Benares, in the first years of the fifth century, he was told of a building in the far-distant Deccan, which he describes in the following terms:\u2014\"It is constructed out of a great mountain of rock, hewn to the proper shape. This building has altogether five storeys. The lowest is shaped into the form of an elephant, and has 500 stone cells in it. The second is in the form of a lion, and has 400 chambers. The third is shaped like a horse, and has 300 chambers. The fourth is in the form of an ox, and has 200 chambers. The fifth storey is in the shape of a dove, and has 100 chambers in it. At the very top of all is a spring of water, which, flowing in a stream before the rooms, encircles each tier,\" etc.\u00b9\n\nThis description at first sight seems sufficiently improbable; but to any one acquainted with Indian architecture, this very improbability is the best proof that it was not invented, but\n\n\u00b9 Beal's Fah-Hian, pp. 139, 140. Fo\u00eb-kou\u00eb-ki, p. 814, et seqq.\nPavilion at Hullabeed from a Photograph.\nthat Fa-Hian's informant had seen what he described. The form of the temple in five storeys, each one fifth less than the one below it, is what we find at the Seven Pagodas, and in fact in all the temples of Southern India; and more especially in the description of the nearly contemporary Maha Lowa Paya at Anuradhapura, in Ceylon. It, however, had nine storeys, but each diminishing in the same ratio.\\(^1\\) The succession of animals is also perfectly familiar to us. The annexed Woodcut, for instance, represents a portion of the Hullabeed Temple in the Mysore; its lower tier is adorned with elephants, the next with lions, above these are horsemen. A frieze is here interpolated; but above this we have animals, which it must be confessed can hardly be called oxen; but above them we have a frieze of birds which may very well be called pigeons. This is not, it is true, exactly what Fa-Hian describes; but if this building was, as Hiouen-Thsang says, built by Sadvahan\\(^2\\) or Salivahana, or Satakarni, thirteen centuries elapsed between the two buildings, and the differences between the two are exactly what one would expect to be introduced in the interval. If, too, the date of the first century of our era is correct, this building was contemporary with the Sanchi gateways, and we know how freely elephants, lions, and even horses were introduced there, as capitals, and generally as architectural ornaments.\n\nHiouen-Thsang was nearer the place than his predecessor ever was, and his account leaves us doubtful whether it really was rock-cut or not. The mountain, or hill, on which it was erected, he says, \"n'a ni bords ni vall\u00e9es elle semble ne former qu'un immense bloc de pierre,\" and he then mentions, \"des longues gallerics, des auvents pour se promener \u00e0 l'abri, des hautes tours, et un pavillon \u00e0 cinque \u00e9tages\"; and then the cascade which springs from the top of the mountain, etc. All, however, tending to show that the building was not completely rock-cut, but, in part at least, structural; and so far as can be made out from such information as is at present available, would answer perfectly for the Winjh\u00e1san\u00ed hill site.\n\n\\(^1\\) Transactions R.A.S. iii., p. 470, pl. 16.  \n\\(^2\\) Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 102.\nA plan of this structure is given in Major Lucie Smith's Report on the Chanda district; not very perfect, it must be confessed, but it represents a central mound, 120 feet in diameter, into which three great galleries, apparently cut in the rock, penetrate from 50 to 70 feet at right angles to the sides, and around it are ruins of very considerable extent. Externally it is now a mere mass of d\u00e9bris, but its vicinity to Bh\u00e1ndak and Chanda would account for its sculptures being removed and utilized. But altogether it is so like our Pigeon monastery that I would be inclined to adopt it as the true site till at least some other substitute is found.\u00b9 Assuming for the nonce that this is so, Wyraghur was the capital of K\u00f2sala at the time of Hiouen-Thsang's visit. The Winjh\u00e1san\u00ed hill is 62 miles south-west from it, rather more, it must be confessed, than the 300 li mentioned in the text, unless indeed we take 5 as our divisor. The direction is quite correct; but, even then, as the Pilgrim never traversed the route or saw the building, all he says regarding either must be taken cum grano.\n\nIf so near, however, it may be asked, why did he not visit it? The answer seems easy. It was deserted and taken from the Buddhists before Fa-Hian's time, and \u00e0 fortiori in Hiouen-Thsang's time was still further desecrated, and occupied by people \"who knew nothing of the laws of Buddha,\" and there was no object in visiting it. It might with equal propriety be asked why did he not visit the Gunamati monastery in Behar, when he was even nearer it, as described in the first section of this paper, but which he certainly passed by.\n\nIn so far as the geography of the preceding or subsequent routes is concerned, it is of very little consequence whether we adopt Wyraghur or Bh\u00e1ndak as the objective point of this route. But if the kingdom of K\u00f2sala were practically Chatt\u00edsgharh, as Mr. Grant suggests,\u00b2 and which I cannot\n\n\u00b9 The suggestion that Fa-Hian meant Ellora is easily disposed of, by one among many facts that might be adduced. The oldest excavations there\u2014the Dherwarra and Vishwacarma\u2014were not commenced till the seventh century, if indeed so early. The Poloyu monastery belonged to the first century of our era.\n\n\u00b2 Gazetteer Central Provinces, Introduction, p. lvi.\nhelp thinking probable, Wyraghur certainly was more probably the capital than the other; and on the whole it suits better both the direction and distances given by the Pilgrim than the more western capital. What would really settle the question would be the discovery of the real Poloyu monastery,\\(^1\\) if it exists; but making every possible allowance for the blindness of travellers, and for our profound ignorance of all that the Nizam's territory contains, I cannot look forward with much hope to its being found. If, however, it is not the Winjh\u00e1san\u00ed hill, its discovery would add more to our knowledge of the history of Indian architecture than any other that is now likely to reward the industry of explorers in these unknown regions.\n\nThe question whether Wyraghur or Bh\u00e1ndak was the capital of K\u00f3sal\u00e1 in Hiouen-Thsang's time, is one which has no bearing on the subsequent geography of his route. Both lie well within the limits of deviation indicated. The first is N. \\(10^\\circ\\) W., the second N. \\(20^\\circ\\) W., and both are the same distance, 280 miles, from Bezwarra, which, as will be presently shown, was the capital of Dhanakach\u00eaka in the seventh century. The one difficulty is to determine the position of Vinkhila, the name of the capital of Andhra at this period. The words of the text are, \"En partant de ce pays, il fit environ 900 li au sud\" (General Cunningham says, p. 521, \"to the south-west,\" but this is certainly a mistake), \"\u00e0 travers des grandes for\u00eats, et arriva au royaume de Andhra.\" The kingdom was not large, the circumference of the capital 20 li, and, what is quite exceptional, its name is given Vinkhila, which sounds very like Vengi, which we know was the name of the capital or country of the Eastern Chalukyas at this period.\\(^2\\) The first impulse is to assume it was Warangal, which is 160 miles due south of Bh\u00e1ndak, and 170 from Wyraghur; but these distances are too great for a forest route when we cannot possibly use a divisor lower than \\(6\\frac{1}{2}\\) or 7, or say 130 to 140 miles, and there is no place on the maps at that distance which can now be recognized by any-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li (Paramalagiri).\u2014Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 101.\n\n\\(^2\\) J.R.A.S., New Series, I., p. 254.\nthing like that name. The next stage is described in the following terms: \"En sortant de ce pays il fit environ 1000 li au sud (vers le sud, Hoe\u00ef-li), \u00e0 travers des for\u00eats et des plaines desertes, et arriva au royaume de Danakach\u00eaka.\" From this description of the character of the country, we may safely take 7 as our divisor, and make this between 140 and 150 miles, as I take it, from the expression in Hoe\u00ef-li, a little to the westward of south from the capital. This would place Vinkh\u00eela in the Nizam's territories near a place marked Ortyal or Yelchal on our maps; but whether there are any remains there or not, I do not know. We know so little of the Hydrabad country. But so far as I can learn from photographs and personal communications, there is nothing at Warangal that seems older than the Pratapa Rudra dynasty, say eleventh or twelfth century. The present capital is about four miles south of the older one, and I see no reason for doubting but that a still more ancient one may be found, when looked for, 30 miles further north.\n\nThe situation of the capital of Danakach\u00eaka is described in the following terms, principally extracted from the Hoe\u00ef-li (page 188), as in this instance the fullest of our two authorities:\u2014\"A est de la capitale on a construit sur une montagne le couvent Pourva\u00e7il\u00e2 Samgh\u00e2r\u00e2ma, et \u00e0 l'ouest de la ville on a \u00e9lev\u00e9 sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 oppos\u00e9 de la montagne le couvent Avara\u00e7il\u00e2 Samgh\u00e2r\u00e2ma. Un ancien roi de ce royaume l'avait construit en honneur de Bouddha, et y avait d\u00e9ploy\u00e9 toute la magnificence des palais de Ta-hia\" (de la Bactriane), and the Si-yu-ki adds, \"Il creusa la vall\u00e9e et y pratiqua un chemin.\" A little further on it is said, \"\u00c0 une petite distance au sud de la ville, il y a une enorme rocher,\" or as the Si-yu-ki specifies, \"Une grande caverne de montagne,\" where Bhavaviveka lived.\n\nWhen I wrote the description of the Amravati Tope, in my work on Tree and Serpent Worship, all this was mysterious enough. The one thing that seemed clear was, that the Amravati Tope was the Avara\u00e7il\u00e2 Samgh\u00e2r\u00e2ma. But it was unfortunately situated close to the east side of the town of Daranicotta, and no possible site for the\nPourva\u00e7il\u00e0 monastery had then been discovered. Worse than this, neither in Colonel Mackenzie's nor in any other maps could anything like the \"enorme rocher\" be found. It was in fact one of those puzzles that must be left for further research to solve. This has now fortunately been done in a report addressed to Government by the late J. A. C. Boswell, officiating collector of the district, and by some photographs by Captain Ross Thompson, which are now before me. From these we learn that to the eastward of Bezwarra, there is a high hill, on the top of which a white building may be seen in the photograph, occupying no doubt the site of the Pourva\u00e7il\u00e0 convent. To the west of the town is a high mountain full of caves, abutting on the river; and 17 miles beyond that to the westward, the Amravati Tope or Avara\u00e7il\u00e0 Samgh\u0101r\u0101ma. But the most remarkable feature is, that immediately south of the town is a singular isolated rock or hill, \"along whose base and sides,\" says Mr. Boswell, \"there are the remains of a considerable number of rock caves and temples, evidently of Buddhist origin. There is a rock temple of two storeys close to the village which has been recently utilized as a granary.\" \"In various places the figures of elephants and other animals, in the Buddhist style of representation, are to be seen depicted. At one place there is a Mantapam cut out of the rock, and supported by stone pillars, more solitary cells, and lastly a rock temple in four storeys of considerable proportions.\" It may be added, that neither was the report written nor the photographs taken with the smallest idea of proving any theory; but their united testimony proves, almost beyond the shadow of a doubt, Bezwarra to be the city Hiouen-Thsang describes.\n\n1 As neither General Cunningham nor I were aware, or had any means of knowing, of these local peculiarities when we wrote, neither of us are, I conceive, to blame that we accepted Daranicotta as the capital, instead of Bezwarra. But General Cunningham was certainly to blame when he called the district Majerika, and mixed up the history of the place with the legends of the Rama Grama relics and other untenable positions. Majerika is, I believe, only mentioned in the Mahawanso, and its position may be gathered from the following extracts:\u2014When Manjarika, which is evidently the same place, is mentioned in Spence Hardy's Eastern Monachism, p. 274. In the legend there quoted, it was the underground residence of the Naga King Maha Kala, who had seen the four Buddhas, and whom Asoka called by magic rites into his presence, that he might see representations of them. This was accomplished by forging a golden female image, being thrown on the ground, proceeded through a cleft that was formed in the earth to the Naga world, and fell at the feet of Maha Kala.\nDanakach\u0113ka to Barougatcheva.\n\nLeaving Bezwarra, our Pilgrim, according to Hoei-li, travelled south 1000 li to Djourya; according to the Si-yu-ki, the direction was south-west: but the discrepancy is easily explained, as, had he really travelled south, he would have fallen into the sea. For the first part of his journey he must consequently have gone in a south-westerly direction, though afterwards resuming his southern route. The object for which he was travelling was to get to the port of embarkation for Ceylon, and he consequently would follow the coast line as nearly as possible. Assuming this to be the case, the direction and distance would take us to Nellore, which is an important place,\u2014whether old or not is not clear; but at all events a pot of gold coins of Trajan and Dutthagamini had erected the Ruanwelli Dagoba for the reception of the Rama Grau relics, which had been carried off to Majerika by the Nagas (Mahawanso, p. 185), a priest, Sonuttara, was told off on the day previous to the ceremony to go to Majerika and fetch them. \"when he heard, for the first time, the burst of the musical sounds which announced the procession to be in motion, instantly diving into the earth, and proceeding subterraneously to the land of the Nagas, then presented himself to the Naga-raja.\" The latter, fearing the relics were to be taken from him, sent his nephew off to the foot of Mount Meru with them; but the there, making a supernaturally long arm, possessed himself of the casket. Then saying (to Kalo), \"Naga, rest thou here,\" rending the earth, he reascended to his pariwo no at Amruthapura\" (p. 188), which he reached before the procession whose start he had listened to, before descending. One point that seems to have influenced General Cunningham was the wonderful magnificence of the last step of the Naga Stupa at Majerika, as it is described in the Mahawanso (p. 188). This, however, is a peculiarity of Ceylonese architecture. All the great buildings in Amruthapura and Pollanuram have their last steps carved in the most elaborate manner. One is represented in the third volume of the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society, pl. 17, and I have photographs of half a dozen others even more elaborate than that one. But no such carved step occurs at Amravati, nor, so far as I know, in any temple on the Continent of India. It is, consequently, just such a hyperbole as a Ceylonese writer would use in describing the magnificence of the underground palace of the Naga Raja, but means nothing.\n\nWhen General Cunningham assisted Mr. Prinsep in copying in vol. vi., pl. x., the A' ravati inscriptions in the Calcutta Museum, both of them thought Amravati was Omravutty in Berar. General Cunningham retained the same belief in 1848, when he described the place as west of Nagpore (J.A.S.B., xvii., p. 43), and I believe was not aware of its true situation, or of the legends bearing upon it, till I told him in 1867. Yet, though my book was published two years before his, he abstains from all allusion to it, though he himself most kindly assisted in its production, and added an appendix. This is a matter of literary etiquette, and I should not allude to it if it were a merely personal question; but it is necessary, in the interests of science, to protest against the mixing up Majerika and Rama Grau legends with the facts as stated in my work, and confounding events which took place 157 B.C. with those which occurred nearly 500 years afterwards in the beginning of the fourth century of our era.\n\nSi-yu-ki, ii., pp. 116-153. Hoei-li, pp. 189-204.\nFaustina was dug up there in 1787.\\(^1\\) Both M. de St.-Martin and General Cunningham assume Djourya (Tehoulya, Si-yu-ki) represents Chola; and I do not see any reason for doubting but that it may have been so, though, according to the native traditions, we would hardly look for it so far north. From this place, \u201cil entra au midi dans des for\u00eats et des plaines d\u00e9sertes, et apr\u00e8s avoir fait 1500 \u00e0 1600 li, arriva au royaume de Dr\u00e2vida. Ce royaume a 6000 li de tour; la capitale, qui s\u2019appelle Kantchipoura, a un trentaine de li de circonf\u00e9rence,\u201d etc.\n\nThis has generally been assumed to be Conjeveram, and the name of that city was undoubtedly Kantchipura in ancient times; but that city is only 140 miles from Nellore, and the distance given, at 6 li, is 260 miles, and even at 7 li, 220. My conviction, therefore, is that we must go on to Nagapatam, which is just 260 miles from Nellore, more especially as this is the only place which will answer to the description of Hoei-li, who says (191), \u201cLa ville de Kantchipoura est situ\u00e9e sur un port de la mer, \u00e0 la point de l\u2019Inde m\u00e9ridionale, en face de royaume de Sinhala, o\u00f9 l\u2019on peut arriver apr\u00e8s trois jours de navigation.\u201d It was here, too, that he met the Ceylonese refugees, who told him of the death of the king, and dissuaded him from venturing across.\n\nAll this would fit admirably to Nagapatam; but nothing is more unlikely than that Ceylonese refugees should congregate at Conjeveram, and by no latitude of description could a city 35 miles from the nearest point of the shore be called a \u201cport de la mer.\u201d My impression is, therefore, that there were two Kantchipuras, as there were two Kousoumapouras, and two Tamraliptis, and as we know there were two Kalyanis, one a capital, the other a port, and, as I hope presently to show, two Ballabhis.\\(^2\\) In the same manner as we have two K\u00f4salas, two Nagpurs. In fact, few things seem more common in Indian Geography than the reduplication of important names.\n\n\\(^1\\) Hamilton, Gazetteer of India, *sub voce*.\n\n\\(^2\\) Tod, in his \u201cTravels in Western India,\u201d p. 277, mentions that the Mount Satrunja, or Palitana, had 21 appellations, some of which he gives. I am afraid this is far from being a solitary instance of such exuberance.\nFrom this point we have the testimony of Hoei-li, which is final on such a question, that he turned northward. \"De Dravida il revient au nord-ouest, en compagnie de 70 religieux, du royaume de Sinhala,\" etc. \"Apr\u00e8s avoir fait 1000 li, il arriva au royaume de Konkana Poura\" (p. 201). And the Si-yu-ki (p. 146) uses nearly the same words, but does not give the direction. Both works, however, give intermediately a description of Malako\u00fbta, which occupied the extreme southern portion of the peninsula. But as he never visited it, neither the details nor dimensions are to be depended upon. But the Si-yu-ki concludes (p. 124) with the following remark: \"Lorsqu'on sort de Malako\u00fbta, dans la direction du nord-est, sur les bords de la mer, on rencontre une ville, nomm\u00e9e Tcharitrapoura; c'est la route des voyageurs qui vont dans la royaume de Ceylon.\"\n\nHere we have a second Tcharitrapura, the pendant of that in Orissa, and evidently the same place as that called Kantchipura by Hoei-li, and which certainly seems to be Nagapatam. That this was a Buddhist site I believe all will allow, and till within the last few years, a Buddhist temple did exist there. It has been utilized lately by the railway, like so many other of the antiquities of India. But I have seen drawings of it; and a woodcut of one of the last fragments of it that remained has been published by Colonel Yule, in his 'Marco Polo.'\n\nFrom Kantchipura, wherever it was, our Pilgrim made three long journeys, till he crossed the Nerbudda. The country through which he was passing had not been visited by Buddha or any of his saints, and in fact had never been converted to Buddhism, and consequently contained little to interest him; and he passed through it rapidly, and perhaps also noted carelessly the direction in which he travelled or the distances. In the Si-yu-ki they are given as follows:\n\n| From Dravida to Konkanapoura | 2000 li north-west. |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| Konkanapoura to capital of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2chtra | 2400 to 2500 li |\n| Capital of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2chtra to the crossing of the Nerbudda at Barougatchera | 1000 li west. |\n\n5500\n\n1 The Book of Marco Polo, by Col. Henry Yule, C.B. (Murray, 1871.) vol. ii., p. 273.\nThe distances and directions given by Hoei-li are identical with those just quoted from the Si-yu-ki, except in the last instance, where, instead of \"West,\" he makes the direction of the last journey \"North-east,\" as will be noticed further on. Dividing this by 6, we have 900 to 916 miles, which is as nearly as may be the distance between Nagapatam and Baroache. If it is still contended that Conjeveram was the point of departure, we must divide by 7, which is hardly probable over so long a distance. This would alter considerably the position of the first station, and I do not know where it would place the second if it is to be on the banks \"of a large river.\"\n\nTaking it, as I suppose, from Nagapatam, the first stage would take us to the centre of the Mysore plateau, somewhere east of Bednore and about Holakaira, or even a little further eastward. This country always was a stronghold of Jainism, and it is here, consequently, if anywhere, that one would look for a pre-existing Buddhism. I am not, however, aware of any monument in the Mysore that can distinctly be called Buddhist; so cannot fix the site with anything like precision.\n\nThe next stage would take us nearly to Deoghur or Doulatabad, as the capital of the great Mahratta King Pulakesi. But the specification of the Si-yu-ki is distinct; his city was \"voisine d'une grande fleuve\" (p. 149), which in this country can only mean the Godavery. There are, however, Foolthamba, Toka, Paitan, or Padami, all old sites, and any one of which would answer the Pilgrim's distance.\u00b9 The plateau is in fact one which always had a capital, whether it was\n\n\u00b9 According to an inscription partly deciphered by Dr. Bhan Daji, J.B.B.R.A.S., vol. ix., p. cxcix., the capital of Pulakesi, at the time of Hiouen-Thsang's visit, is said to have been Vatapipuri. The name is new to me, and I do not find it on any map I have access to; so, until the Doctor chooses to enlighten us, we are not much wiser than we were. The one condition, if it is to be the place at which Pulakesi was residing when Hiouen-Thsang visited him, is, that it should be within 160 or 170 miles of Baroache, which is one of the fixed points in our itineraries, and situated on the banks of a river. So new a name, however, springing up in so authentic a form, is another of the 1001 instances which occur in this investigation, to show how worthless nominal similarities are. It may either be a new site altogether, or only a new name for an old city.\n\nIt was mentioned by Sir Walter Elliot, J.R.A.S., Vol. IX., p. 9, but even he was ignorant of its position.\nDeoghur, Arungabad, or Ahmednuggur; it was marked out by nature as a site for a great city, and here we must look for it. The direction, it is true, from the last station is more north than north-west; but in so long a route I hold it to be quite impossible that any traveller could, without instruments, keep his bearings correctly, and without better maps than he could possibly have possessed. In this case, such a deviation as this seems to me of no practical importance.\n\nFrom Foolthamba to Baroache is exactly 166 miles; the direction is north-west. But here we come to a conflict between our two authorities, which betrays an error somewhere, which it is difficult to correct with confidence. From Pulakesi's capital, Hoc\u00eb-li\u2014generally our most trustworthy guide\u2014makes him go \"environ 1000 li au nord-est\" to the place \"Baroukatch\u00e9va, o\u00f9 il passa la rivi\u00e8re Narmmad\u00e0.\" But if Baroukatch\u00e9va is Baroache, as every one assumes it is, this is impossible. Any place 166 miles south-west of Baroache would have been far out at sea. The Si-yu-ki (p. 153) gives the same distance, but makes the direction \"west.\" This is probable, and approaches the truth; but still, unless we are allowed to compound the two authorities, and consider Hoc\u00eb-li's north-east as a mistake or mis-transcription of north-west, I do not see how we are to reconcile the facts with the description; doing so, it all becomes quite correct. This, however, is no arbitrary correction, as we find him describing the next journey, as we shall see presently, as \"encore au nord-ouest,\" showing clearly that here at least we have an error of transcription or translation.\n\nBefore leaving this part, it may be well to point out a passage which, I think, without doubt, applies to the Caves of Ajunta. In the Si-yu-ki, p. 151, it is said, \"Sur les fronti\u00e8res orientales du royaume, il y a une grande montagne, qui offre des sommets entass\u00e9s les uns sur les autres, des cha\u00eenes de rochers, des pics \u00e0 doubles \u00e9tages, et des cr\u00eates escarp\u00e9es. Anciennement il y avait un couvent, qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 construit dans une sombre vall\u00e9e. Ses b\u00e2timents \u00e9lev\u00e9s, et ses salles profondes occupaient des larges ouvertures dans des rochers, et s'appuyaient sur des pics, ses pavillons et ses tours \u00e0\ndoubles \u00e9tages, \u00e9toient adoss\u00e9es aux cavernes et regardaient la vall\u00e9e.\u201d Considering that our Pilgrim never saw the place, this description reproduces the main features of that group of caves with marvellous fidelity, and leaves in my mind no doubt but that it was the group he was describing.\n\n*From Baroukatch\u00eava to Ballabhi.*\n\nPassing the Nerbudda to the northward, we enter on the third, and by far the least satisfactory division of Hiouen-Thsang\u2019s travels. The journeys in this part are no longer consecutive, and it is never possible to follow him step by step, as could be done from the time he entered the Caubul valley till he crossed the Nerbudda. It is difficult to guess whether this may arise from the notes of this part of his travels having perished in the accident that occurred when he crossed the Indus on his return home (Hoe\u00ef-li, p. 263), or whether it may have been that the notes of this part were less carefully kept than those of his previous journeys. Both these causes may have conspired to this effect: but I am inclined to lay considerable stress on the latter. Neither Buddha nor any of his immediate disciples visited Western India. Buddhist sites and traditions were consequently rare; and it is difficult to understand what could have induced our traveller to make such long and difficult journeys, as he did, through countries which to him must have been singularly uninteresting, if he did make them at all. My own impression is that though the pronoun \u201cil,\u201d and not \u201con,\u201d is constantly used, it must in this part of his travels be taken with considerable qualification; and though in some instances he may have performed the journeys narrated, he certainly did not do so in all instances: and we must consequently receive the statements of our author with the greatest possible caution.\n\nAnother difficulty occurs from the summary mode in which the whole is treated in this division. Hoe\u00ef-li, for instance, disposes of six journeys, extending over 6000 li, in the space of a single page (pp. 207-8), and we consequently miss all those\n\n---\n\n1 Hoe\u00ef-li, pp. 204\u2013206. Si-yu-ki, ii., pp. 164\u2013162.\nlocal incidents and features which are so invaluable towards fixing places in the earlier parts of the narrative. I by no means wish to assert that there is no geography to be got out of this division of the work. On the contrary, I fancy a great deal may be learnt, but it must be by a totally different mode of investigation from that applicable to the earlier portions, and must always, I fear, remain much less certain or satisfactory.\n\nAt present I propose to examine only one short journey in order to illustrate these remarks, and trust it will be sufficient for that purpose. From Baroache the Pilgrim went to Ballabhi. According to the usually received theory of the site of that city, the distance was 60 miles west; according to my view, 160 north: and there seems every reason for supposing that, as in all the previous instances, he took the usual and most direct road.\n\nIf Ballabhi was situated where it is generally supposed it was placed, he must either have taken a boat and crossed the gulf of Cambay to get to it, or he must have travelled 60 miles in a northerly, and then an equal distance in a southerly direction to reach it. There is not, however, any trace of any such journeys in either of the works under review, so unless we are prepared to reject the whole as an inexplicable riddle\u2014which it may be\u2014we must look to the site of that Capital elsewhere.\n\nTurning first then to the Hoc\u012b-li, we have the following facts (p. 204), \"De l\u00e0 (Baroukatcheva), marchant encore au nord-ouest (a tolerable proof of the correctness of our last determination), il fit 2000 li, et arriva au royaume de Malva.\" From what he says of this country, and of its late king Siladitya, it seems difficult to doubt but that this should be Malwa and its capital Ougein. But the distance is only 200 miles: whereas 2000 li is more than 300, and the direction of Ougein is N.E., not N.W., and Ougein is also almost undoubtedly mentioned afterwards as the capital of Oudjana (Hoc\u012b-li, p. 207; Si-yu-ki, ii., p. 167); so that nothing will fit: and we know besides, from the Japanese map attached to the second volume, that the editors certainly meant north-west,\nand not north-east. To proceed therefore. From this place, \"il fit 2400 \u00e0 2500 li au nord-ouest, et arriva au royaume de Atali.\" \"De l\u00e0, il fit 300 li au nord-ouest, et arriva \u00e0 Kita.\" \"De l\u00e0, il fit 1000 li au nord, et arriva au royaume de Ballabhi.\" If any one will take the trouble to protract these distances and directions on the map, he will find the first takes him to Omercote, or some place near it; the next to Kelat, and the last to somewhere in the neighbourhood of Kandahar, where Ballabhi certainly was not, some 900 miles, instead of 60 or 160, and quite out of India. When we turn to the Si-yu-ki, it does not help us much. The journey to Malva is given in precisely the same terms; so is that to Atali. But here he leaves the traveller, and starts again from Malva. It must also be remarked that on the previous start from Malva, the following words occur, \"En partant de ce royaume au sud-ouest, il arriva au confluent de deux mers, fit ensuite 2400 \u00e0 2500 li \u00e0 Atali.\" There is also another fact mentioned, which is important. Speaking of the capital of Malva, he says, \"qu'elle est situ\u00e9e au sud-est de la rivi\u00e8re Mahi\" (p. 155); and in the second departure from Malva (p. 161), it is said, \"partant de ce royaume, il fit environ 300 li au nord-ouest, et arriva au royaume de Khatch.\" From these sentences we glean a few facts that may serve to solve the problem we have before us. The first is that the capital of Malva was situated to the south-east of the Mahi or Mhye river. This description would answer admirably for the situation of Baroda, or some city in its neighbourhood, but for no other that I know of. It will not answer for Dhar, as General Cunningham suggests (p. 491), for that city is a long way from even the head waters of that stream, and so long as it runs towards the north, it is a dry nullah for nine months of the year, and only becomes such a stream as any one would refer to when it passes Banswarra on its way southward.\n\nAgain, on the first departure from Malva, the Si-yu-ki states that the Pilgrim went a certain distance\u2014how far is not stated\u2014to the south-west, to the junction of two seas. This description would not answer, so far as I know, to any\nplace in this neighbourhood except to Cambay. The two estuaries of the Mahi and Subramutti must, 1200 years ago, have been much more important than they now are, and would fully justify that denomination; and though west from Baroda the Pilgrim must have turned south-west from the head of the bay to reach the city, from which the 2500 li to Atali are measured.\n\nOn the second departure from Malva, the distance is given as 300 li to Kita, which again would answer perfectly for the distance from Baroda to Cambay. The direction now given is north-west, and if that is deemed important, some of the nearest cities south of Baroda must be substituted; but it seems near enough for our present purpose. Then comes the instantia crucis. \"En partant de ce pays, il fit environ 1000 li au nord, et arriva \u00e0 Ballabhi.\"\n\nThis would take us to the neighbourhood of Sidpur, Anhulwara Puttun, Chandravati, and a group of old ruined cities that exist and always have existed in the neighbourhood of Deesa. If the site usually assigned to Ballabhi is insisted upon, this is fatal. 1000 li, or 150 or 160 miles south of Bhownuggur we are out at sea, opposite Bombay harbour, where certainly there was no Kita from which the Pilgrim could measure his \"1000 li north.\" Either, it seems to me, we must reject his text altogether, or adopt Cambay as Kita, and some spot near Anhulwara as the site of the old capital of Ballabhi. At the same time it appears to me that the identification of the site near Bhownuggur with that of the old capital rests on the shallowest evidence. Colonel Tod heard it so called, but never visited it. It was afterwards carefully examined by Dr. Nicholson, and a detailed account of it published in the Journal of the R.A.S. xiii., p. 146, et seqq. From what he says, there seems to have been nothing either grand or ancient about the place, and since then the principal finds have been Mahomedan and modern coins.\n\n1 Travels in Western India, p. 268.\n2 He mentions, however, one tradition, which, as far as it goes, seems to point to the truth. The sons of Govindasoo, who received the image of Parsnath from the thief, resided at Puran Puttun, which was 40 kosz distant from Wullee Puttun, the name by which the city is known which Tod identified with Ballabhi.\nI am not, however, at all prepared to contend that there may not have been a city called Ballabhi near Bhownuggur in Guzerat. On the contrary, as there were Kalliani the capital, and Kalliani the port,\u2014Kantchipura the capital, and the port of the same name,\u2014Tamralipti and Tamluk,\u2014and the two Kousoumapuras,\u2014so there probably was Ballabhi the capital, and Ballabhi the port; or what appears to me most probable is, that, when Ballabhi was destroyed in 746, a portion of the inhabitants fled southwards, and established themselves at Wullee, and took with them the name of their old home. But of one thing I feel certain, which is, that the neighbourhood of Bhownuggur never was the seat of a great capital. The metropolis of the country was always\n\n1 This seems certainly to have been the case in Al Biruni's time, for he says, \"Ballaba, qui a donn\u00e9 aussi son nom \u00e0 une \u00e8re, \u00e9tait prince de la ville de Ballaba, au midi de Anhalanara, \u00e0 environ trente yodjamas de distance.\" (Thomas's Prinsep, i., 269.) If my view is correct, the first was the old, the second the new, city of that name.\n\n2 When an error once gets introduced in a standard work, it is copied and repeated without examination, till it becomes so completely established that it is almost impossible to get it afterwards corrected. I hope, therefore, I may be allowed again to protest against Colonel Tod's date for the destruction of Ballabhi. All he did assert was, \"that the records preserved by the Jains,\" apparently the Satrunjiya Mahatmya\u2014which for such a purpose is absolutely worthless\u2014assert that Ballabhi was destroyed by the Parthians (properly the barbarians) in 205 of the Ballabhi Samvat, for which he adds 319, making 524 A.D. It is quite needless, therefore, General Cunningham speculating whether the event was dated from the Samvat or Saka era (p. 318). It is from the Ballabhi era, and from no other, and it rests on no inscription, no extraneous history or tradition; simply on the authority of some worthless and nameless Jain scribe, and it is contradicted by the most positive evidence, the one we are at present concerned with being quite sufficient. In 640, 116 years after its reputed destruction, Hiuen-Theang visited it, and found, as one would expect from the chronology (J.R.A.S., new series, iv., p. 90), that a King Dhrouvapata was on the throne, and no symptom of decay was visible in its long period of prosperity.\n\nThe truth seems to be, and Tod himself admits it (pp. 149\u2013152), that Ballabhi was destroyed, and Anbulwara-putun rose on its ruins in the Samvat year 802, or A.D. 746. Every scrap of information we have, every inscription, every tradition, point to the middle of the eighth century as the period of a revolution which changed the face of India. The great Chalukya and Canouge dynasties were then eclipsed\u2014the Moslems, who were fast advancing to the conquest of India, were driven back to the Indus\u2014Buddhism practically disappeared, and Siva and Vishnu take the place of the mild ascetic. The only written record of this great event is a distorted paraphrase of it in the Raja Tarangini, where it figures as the Indian wars and conquests of Lali aditya (A.R. xv., p. 44 et seqq.); but Elliot's inscriptions (J.R.A.S. iv., 7, et seqq.), and above all Tod's Annals, everywhere point to this as the end of the old and the beginning of the new state of things in India. It may have been, as above stated, in 746, or it may be 10 years later; but till we have more exact information, it will be better to speak in round numbers, and take 750 A.D. as the date of the great revolution.\n\n* See also Travels in Western India, p. 149.\nsituated between the head of the Gulf of Cambay and Mount Abu, and whether its name was Ballabhi, Sidpur, Anhulwara, or Ahmedabad, it was there, or thereabouts, that the supreme power was situated; and there we must look for the remains of that great city, if ever we expect to find them.\\footnote{If Dr. Stevenson's conjecture could be maintained, it would be an easy solution of the difficulty. In J.B.B.R.A.S., vol. viii., p. 61, he says, \"I suppose it refers to Anandapura, so called by the Jains, and afterwards by the Hindus named Valabhi, the capital of the well-known sovereignty of that name, on the north side of the Gulf of Cambay.\" The objection to this theory is that both \u9686 (p. 207) and the Si-yu-ki (ii., p. 164) mention Anandapura as a separate capital 700 li N.W. from Ballabhi. The whole, however, it appears to me, is only another instance of perpetual shuffling of names of cities which are so frequently met with in these inquiries, and which, in fact, is what makes them so difficult.}\n\nIf this is so, it is quite evident that we must reject the journey from Baroache to Atali as a geographical determination inserted in the wrong place, and having no real bearing on the Pilgrim's progress from the capital of Pulakesi to that of Dhrouva Patou, the Druva Sena of the Indian lists.\\footnote{Thomas, Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, i., p. 252, et seqq.}\n\nIt is hardly necessary to pursue this branch of the subject further at present. What has been said above is probably sufficient to show that the journeys detailed in this part of Hiouen-Thsang's work must be treated differently from those in previous parts of his route. They may be, and probably are, all true, within certain limits; but we get into hopeless and irremediable confusion, when we either alter the text to suit our own preconceived ideas, or attempt to put journeys into a sequence one after the other, when in fact they are parallel to one another. The fact seems to be, that though some of them are personal experiences, the greater part can only be considered as geographical descriptions.\nART. X.\u2014Northern Buddhism. [Note from Colonel H.

Take all these, remembering that the distinctive use of them is invariable, and we have, I think, something more of evidence than Messrs. Horne and Fergusson seem disposed to recognize. And is not the fact that three great convocations were held in India to settle disputed points of faith proof enough that Southern Buddhism was not of that single type insisted on by Pali students of the Ceylonese type? And why not one of these types the Dhy\u0101ni school of Nep\u00e1l and the North?\n\n\"The late Governor of Java, Baron Sloet, some while back, sent me a handsome dagger in acknowledgment of the light I had thrown on Javanese Buddhism, by my expositions of that faith as still extant in Nep\u00e1l.\n\n\"It may be that Buddhism in Nep\u00e1l is comparatively recent, not earlier than the second century of Christ, and that this type got to Java, avoiding Ceylon, etc., at a still later date, even in the eleventh or twelfth century.

XI.\u2014Hwen Thsang's Account of the Principalities of Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, etc.\n\nIn my recent paper on Hwen Thsang's Geography of Tokh\u00e1rist\u00e1n, I made what may have seemed a rash suggestion, that the Folichisitangna of the Traveller, a territory at the foot of Hindu Kush, might represent the country of the Par\u00e1chis of Baber. But the suggestion has received corroboration from a passage that I recently observed in the Travels of Sidi 'Ali (Journ. As., tom. ix., p. 203). The admiral being at K\u00e1b\u00fal, and about to cross the Hindu Kush, the Governor sent Mir Nez\u00edr, chief of the Tribes of Far\u00e1shi and Bash\u00e1tsi (\u0628\u0634\u0627\u0631\u06cc) to demand 300 men of those tribes to conduct the horses and camels across the Pass. The party then proceeded by Kar\u00e1b\u00e1gh and Ch\u00e2rikar\u00e1n to Par-w\u00e1n. There they entered on the territory of Mir Nez\u00edr, and found the tribesmen assembled. This seems to show that the territory of the Far\u00e1shis (or Par\u00e1chis) was about Par-w\u00e1n, i.e. close to Hupi\u00e1n, which is supposed to be the Hupinah of Hwen-Thsang, called by him the capital of Folichisitangna. Bash\u00e1tsi is, I imagine, a clerical error for Bash\u00e1di (\u0628\u0634\u0627\u062f\u06cc), the well-known name of a tribe (Pash\u00e1dis) which I have supposed to be possibly connected with that of the adjoining kingdom of Kapi\u00e7a or Kapisha.\n\nSeptember 13th, 1872.\n\nH.

It will be well to determine the height of a building so as to coincide with the breadth. Of buildings consisting of a sole room, the length may be double the width.\n\n12. The breadth of the houses of a private man from one of the four classes is 32 cubits, which must be diminished by four for each next following, down to 16. A lower amount of cubits is only for the very lowest people.\n\n13. The length amounts to the breadth $+\\frac{1}{5}$, in the case of Brahmans; to the same $+\\frac{1}{8}$, in the case of Kshatriyas; to the same $+\\frac{1}{6}$, for Vai\u00e7yas; and to the width increased by $\\frac{1}{4}$, for \u00c7\u00fbdras.\n\ngovernors and superior king's officers.\" As in st. 14, r\u0101japurusha denotes a person of much inferior rank, such a translation would seem preferable.

The treasury and pleasure-house have a dimension equal to the difference between the numbers assigned to the houses of the king and of the chief commander. The difference between the measure for a chief commander and that of a private man from one of the four classes, gives the measure for king's officers.\\(^1\\)\n\n15. The dwellings of persons from mixed classes, like P\u0101ra\u00e7avas, etc.,\\(^2\\) have dimensions equal to half the sum of the measures for the two classes (to whose intermingling they owe their origin). A house, the dimension whereof is either below or above the legitimate one, occasions evil to all.\n\n16. There is no fixed measure for cattle houses, monasteries, granaries, arsenals, and firerooms, but the authorities in architecture do not approve of a height upwards of 100 cubits.\n\n17. Add the number of 70 to those for the breadth of the mansions of the king and the commander-in-chief. Write down the sum, at two places. Divide it, at one place, by 14; this gives the measure for a hall. Divide the same sum by 35; the quotient is the measure of the terrace.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) That is to say: if an officer belongs to the Brahmanical class, the difference meant is that between the measure of the chief commander's house and a private Brahman's; if an officer be a Kshatriya, we are directed to subtract the number allotted to a private Kshatriya's house from the measure of the commander's mansion; and so forth.\n\n\\(^2\\) The P\u0101ra\u00e7ava class traces, theoretically, or rather fancifully, its origin to the intermarriage of a Brahman and a \u00c7\u016bdra woman.

In the centre is Brahman, occupying nine squares; east of him Aryaman; to the south of whom, at the interval of one compartment, is placed Savitar; at the same interval (proceeding westward) from the latter, Vivasvant. Then follow Indra, Mitra, R\u0101j\u0101yakshman, Prthv\u012bdhara, and \u0100pavatsa. These are all stationed round Brahman.\n\n48. In the intermediate compartment (between \u0100pavatsa and Agni), in the north-east direction, is placed \u0100pa\u1e25; southeast (between Savitar and Anila), S\u0101vitra; south-west, Jaya; north-west, Rudra.\n\n49. \u0100pa\u1e25, \u0100pavatsa, Parjanya, Agni, and Diti form a group of deities occupying one compartment each, in the north-western corner. In the same manner there are five deities, each of them possessing one compartment, in the other corners.\n\n50. The remaining exterior deities, twenty in number, have two squares each. Finally, to the share of the four deities, Aryaman, Vivasvant, Mitra, and Prthv\u012bdhara, are allotted three compartments, severally, in the east, south, and so forth.\n\n51. The spirit of the house area has his head directed north-westwards and his face turned downwards. His head is held by Agni, his face by \u0100pa\u1e25, his (right) pap by Aryaman, and his chest by \u0100pavatsa.\n\n52. Parjanya and the (three) next exterior deities occupy his (right) eye, ear, bosom, and shoulder. Satya and the four subsequent lie on his (right) arm; Savitar and S\u0101vitra on his (right) hand.\n\n53. Vitatha and Bh\u1e5bhatkshata are stationed on his side; Vivasvant on the belly; the thigh is occupied by Yama; the knee by Gandharva, the lower leg by Bh\u1e5bngar\u0101ja, and the hip by M\u1e5bga.\n\n54. In the same manner as these are stationed on the right side, the other deities (such as have been specified) have their place on the left.\u00b9 The penis is taken by Indra and Jayanta;\u00b2 the heart by Brahman; and the foot by the Pitars.\n\n\u00b9 E.g. Prthv\u012bdhara on the left pap; Diti on the left eye; etc.\n\u00b2 In the diagram, Jaya.\n55. One may also, should one prefer it, divide the area into sixty-four compartments, and draw, besides, oblique lines from angle to angle. Of this area Brahman possesses four squares, and each of the deities, placed in oblique direction near him, half a square.\\(^1\\)\n\n| Roga | A. | Mu. | Bhal. | So. | Bhu. | Adi. | Dit\u00ee | Agni |\n|------|----|-----|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|\n| \u010cosha | hi | khya | l\u00e2ta | ma | jaga | li | Parjanya |\n| Asara | Rud. | Prthv\u00eedhara | \u0100pah | \u0100pa\u015b | Jayanta |\n| Varuna | Mi. | Brahman | Arya. | Indra |\n| Kusumad | tra | Brahman | man | S\u00fbrya |\n| Sugr\u00eeva | Jaya | Vivasvant | Sav | S\u0101v\u012bt | Satya |\n| Dauv\u00eer | Gan. | Ya. | Brhat | Vita | Pi. | Bhar\u00e7a |\n| Pit | Mrga | r\u00e2ja | dharva | ma | kshala | tha | shan | Antar |\n|      |     |     |       |     |       |     | Anila |\n\n56. The eight standing in the extreme corners, have to their share half a compartment, and those next to them on both sides have one and a half. The remaining twenty out of those enumerated possess two squares.\n\n57. The meeting points of the longer diagonals and the very middle points of the compartments must be considered the vulnerable spots,\\(^2\\) which one will do wisely not to hurt.\n\n58.

That member of the body where the householder feels an itching, or that spot where at a sacrifice an evil omen is produced, or where the fire shows unnatural symptoms, contains a wounding point.\n\n60. If the wounding point consists of wood, there will be loss of wealth; if it is something made of bone, there will be suffering amongst cattle, disease and unsafety. [If the point is something of iron, there is danger from the sword; skullbones and hairs denote death.]\n\n[61. If it is charcoal, you may predict unsafety on account of thieves; if it is ashes, continual danger from fire. In fact, any wounding point, unless it be gold or silver, on a vulnerable spot, is most disastrous.]\n\n[62. A heap of chaff, whether found on a vulnerable spot, or on any other, prevents the acquisition of wealth.] A peg, also, on a vulnerable spot, is mischievous.\n\n63, 64. The nine meeting points of the lines drawn from Roga to Anila, from the Pitars to Agni, from Vitatha to \u00c7osha, from Mukhya to Bh\u1e5b\u00e7a, from Jayanta to Bhrngar\u0101ja, and from Aditi to Sugriva, are declared to be the excessively vulnerable spots. The dimension of a vulnerable spot is set down at one-eighth of a compartment.\n\n65. A long diagonal has in breadth as many digits as each square numbers cubits.

Danger from fire, birth of a girl, abundant wealth, favour with the monarch, wrathfulness, falsehood, and thievishness (are the results of the door standing) eastwards.\n\n73. Few sons, servitude, lowness, increase of food, drink and progeny, cruelty, ungratefulness, poverty, and loss of children and strength (are the consequences, if the door stands) southwards.\n\n74. Suffering of a son, increase of enemies, no acquisition of wealth or sons, happy possession of sons, wealth and power, riches, danger from the king, loss of wealth, and sickness (await the owner, where the door faces the) west.\n\n75. Death or captivity, increase of enemies, acquisition of wealth and sons, happy possession of all good things, getting sons and wealth, enmity with one's own son, faults in the wife, and poverty (may be expected where the door is placed on the northern edge).\n\n76. A door being hindered by a road, tree, corner, well, column or water spring, brings ill luck; but on its being removed to a distance equal to twice its height, it will not do any harm.\n\n77. A door that is impeded by the road is destructive; one that is hindered by a tree will be noxious to boys; a door with mud before it threatens grief; when water is flowing near it, expenses are predicted.\n\n78. A door being injured by a well occasions epilepsy; by a temple, destruction; by a column, failings of the housewife. Where a door faces Brahman,\u00b9 the family will perish.\n\n79. A door which opens of itself produces madness; one\n\n\u00b9 There is a long inquiry in the Comm., in order to find out how to reconcile this statement with that in st. 75. The upshot is that the one cannot by any means be made to agree with the other.

A door whose dimensions are too large causes danger from the king; a low one forebodes robbery and brings calamity.\n\n80. A door placed above another, and one that is too narrow, promises no good; a somewhat yawning one threatens famine; a curved one destroys the family.\n\n81. A door being excessively pinched (by the threshold) gives rise to distress; one that is bent inwards tends to evil; one bent outwards causes absence from home; one standing awry in regard to the quarters produces vexation by robbers.\n\n82. One should not have the principal entrance out-done by other doors, owing to a loftier appearance of the latter, and must richly ornament it with auspicious objects, as water-pots, fruit, foliage, images of goblins, and the like.\n\n83.

Part of the corresponding passage from K\u0101tyapa is translated in R\u00e1m R\u00e1z, Arch. p. 17.\nKshatriyas; a yellow one to Vai\u00e7yas; and a black one to \u00c7\u00fbdras. A smell like ghee, blood, food and spirituous liquor, denotes a ground suited to Brahmans and the rest, in succession.\n\n97. A soil covered with sacrificial grass, \u00c7ara, bent grass and Saccharum spontaneum, promotes the weal of the classes respectively. Likewise a sweet, astringent, sour and pungent earth.\n\n98. At a period indicated by the astrologer, let the house-owner go to a piece of ground which has been ploughed, abounds with seed grown up, has served for a resting-place of cows, or has got the approval of the Brahmans.\n\n99. He has to worship the deities with various sorts of sweetmeats, with curds, unground barley-corns, fragrant flowers and incenses, and to pay honour to the architects and Brahmans.\n\n100. Then\u2014touching his head, if he be a Brahman; the breast, if a Kshatriya; the thigh, if a Vai\u00e7ya; the foot, if a \u00c7\u00fbdra\u2014let him draw a line, the first act when a house is to be built.\n\n101. It is allowed to make the line by means of the thumb, middle finger, or forefinger, as well as by means of gold, precious stone, silver, pearl, curds, fruits, flowers, or un-ground barley-corns.\n\n102. A line scratched with a sword causes death by the sword; with an iron object, captivity; with ashes, danger from fire; with grass, danger from robbers; and with wood, danger from the king.\n\n103. A crooked line, drawn with the foot, occasions danger from the sword and troubles; so also does a deformed line. One made by means of leather, charcoal, a bone or tooth, brings misfortune upon him that makes it.\n\n104. Hostility may be predicted from a line being scratched from right to left; good luck, from one being drawn from left to right. Harsh words, spitting and sneezing (during the act) are said to be inauspicious.\n\n105. When the edifice is half-built or finished, let the architect enter it and observe the omens, on what spot the house-owner happens to stand, and what limb he is touching.\n106. Should, on that moment, an ominous bird, being scorched by the sun,\\(^1\\) emit hoarse sounds, you may predict that on the spot (where the house-owner is stationed) there is a bone of a member corresponding to the member touched.\\(^2\\)\n\n107. And by other animals, like elephants, horses, dogs, shrieking in return at the time of augury, may be known that the specified spot contains a bone from such an animal and belonging to a corresponding limb of the body.\n\n108. The sound of an ass when the measuring line is being extended announces that there is a bone hidden. You may predict that there will be another \"wounding point\" (as it is termed), on seeing a dog or jackal leaping over the measuring line.\n\n109. When a bird of augury sweetly warbles in a quiet quarter, then it may be foretold that a treasure lies hidden at the corresponding spot, or in that part of the house-spirit's body upon which the owner is standing.\n\n110. By the measuring line snapping asunder may be predicted death; by the plug drooping its top, great sickness; by the house-owner and architect falling short in their memory, death.\n\n111. The waterpot dropping from the shoulder forebodes headache; its being overturned, calamity in the family; its getting broken, death of the workmen; its slipping from the hands, death of the house-owner.\n\n112. Having made an oblation, one has to lay the first stone in the south-east angle, and then, proceeding from left to right, the rest. Similarly the pillars ought to be raised.\n\n113. The pillar must be raised, decorated with an umbrella, garlands, cloth, scented with incense, and smeared with\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e., facing the quarter in which the sun is standing at that period. The eastern quarter is \"scorched\" (\\(dip\\), \\(pradip\\)) from sunrise upwards to the end of the first \\(prahara\\); during the same period the north-east is termed \\(angari\\), the south-east \\(dh\u0101min\\) or \\(dh\u0101mita\\), the rest \\(g\u0101nta\\).

S. 20, 9, and 11, 44.\nfeeble, and of birds alighting on them, are the same with those specified at the banner of Indra, where the good omens have been enumerated at the same time.\n\n115. A dwelling too elevated on the north-east side causes the loss of property and sons; one that has a bad smell, the death of a son; one that is not straight, destruction of kinsmen. In a habitation which does not face any distinct quarter, no children will be born.\n\n116. Let him who is anxious for the weal of his house raise the soil on every side to the same level; and if there must needs be a fault, let it be on the east or north side.\n\n117. If an elevation is to be found in the east, there will be enmity with friends; if in the south, peril of death; if in the west, loss of wealth; if in the north, heart-burning.\n\n118. A chapel is to be made in the north-east; a kitchen in the south-east; a (room for) vessels and utensils in the south-west; a treasury and granary in the north-west.\n\n119. By water being found to the east, south-east, etc., of a habitation, the results will be, respectively, loss of sons, danger from fire, peril from enemies, quarrel with the housewife, wickedness of the same, poverty, increase of wealth, and increase of progeny.\n\n120. In cutting timber, one has to avoid trees inhabited by birds, or broken, withered, scorched, standing near temples, on cemeteries, milky trees, *Terminalia bellerica*, Azadiracht, and *Premna spinosa*.\n\n121. Having presented an oblation, and paid worship at night, let the carpenter hew the tree in the daytime, from left to right. It is a lucky token if the tree falls north or east; coming down in another direction, it is not acceptable.\n\n122. If the cut shows no unnatural phenomena, the timber will be fit for building material; if a yellow circle is visible on it, you may foretell that there is a great lizard within the tree.\n\n---\n\n1 The translation renders the obvious meaning of the author; as to his words, they express, in the former half of the couplet, precisely the reverse of what is intended; instead of \"\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0935\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0928\u094d\" it ought to have been \"\u0930\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0935\u0930\u094d\u091c\u093f\u0924\u092e\u094d\".\n123. A madder-hued ring on the cut denotes a frog; a dark one, a snake; a red one, a chameleon; a bean-coloured one, a stone; a brown one, a mouse; a sword-hued one, water.\n\n124. Let him who desires to prosper sleep not above grain, cows, persons to be venerated, fire and deities, nor in the same straight line with the diagonals, nor with his head turned northward or westward, nor naked, nor with wet feet.\n\n125. Amid the shouts of Brahmans the proprietor has to make his entrance into his newly-built house, it being strewed with a great many flowers, adorned with archways, and decorated with waterpots filled, the gods being worshipped with incense, perfumes, and oblations.\n\nChapter LIV.\n\nOn the Exploration of Water-springs.\n\n1. Forthwith I will explain the meritorious and reputable art how to explore springs to obtain water. Even as there are veins in the human body, so, too, in the earth, some of them running higher, others deeper.\n\n2. Although all the water falling from heaven has the same colour and taste, yet it becomes different in taste, and of various colours, owing to the difference of soil.\\(^1\\) Hence an examination of it may be based on its analogy with the soil.\n\n3. Indra, Agni, Yama, Nir\u1e5bti, Varu\u1e47a, V\u0101yu, Soma, and \u010civa, are to be considered the rulers of the quarters, east, south-east, and so on in succession.\n\n4. Eight veins are denominated after the ruler of the region; a ninth, in the centre, is called the great vein. There are hundreds of others, that issue from different quarters, and are known by their own names.\\(^2\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf. Su\u1e63ruta, i., p. 169, l. 9 sqq.\n\n\\(^2\\) This statement is couched in somewhat hyperbolical language; yet it appears from st. 23 below, that some at least of these veins were endowed with elegant names.\n5. The veins running above the infernal regions, and those that are found in the four cardinal points, are good; those that issue from the intermediate points are evil. I now proceed to describe the tokens of the veins.\n\n6, 7. If you find rotang in a waterless country, there will be, at a distance of three cubits from thence, and at a depth of $1\\frac{1}{2}$ man's length,\u00b9 a vein flowing from the west. The (further) signs are: at a depth of $\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. a pale yellow frog, then yellow clay and a stone protruding from it; beneath there is water.\n\n8. Northwards from a roseapple-tree, at a distance of three cubits, and a depth of 2 m. l. under ground, will be an easterly vein; there (will appear as further indications) clay of a smell like iron, then pale yellow clay, and, at 1 m. l. deep, a frog.\n\n9, 10. Where an ant-hill is near a roseapple-tree, there will be sweet water, 2 m. l. deep, on the south side. (The signs are:) a fish at a depth of $\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., and a pigeon-coloured pebble. There, also, will be dark clay and much water for a long time.\n\n11. To the west of a glomerous fig-tree, at three cubits' distance, and $2\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. under ground, there will be a vein of good water. (The signs are:) a white snake at a depth of 1 m. l., and a stone resembling collyrium.\n\n12, 13. If an ant-hill is seen to the north of a *Terminalia Arjuna*, there is water in a westerly direction, three cubits from the tree and $3\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. deep. (The indications are:) a great fair-hued lizard at a depth of $\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l.; grey clay 1 m.l. underground; further, black, yellow, white clay blended with sand; at last water, one may predict, in immense quantity.\n\n14, 15. At the above-mentioned number of cubits to the south of a *Vitex Negundo*, with an ant-hill annexed, there will be water, sweet and never drying up, at a depth of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. A *rohit* fish at $\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., then red-brown clay, further\n\n\u00b9 Comm.: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0947\u0937\u094d\u0920\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0915\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0940 \u092d\u0948\u0937\u0903\u0964 \u0938 \u091a \u0935\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0915\u092e\u0938\u0941-\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u0903 (= 5 cubits) \u092e\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\npale yellow clay, then sand mixed with gravel (are the indications); beneath it is water.\n\n16. If an ant-hill appears to the east of a jujube-tree, one may announce that there is water on the west side,\\(^1\\) at 3 m. l. A fair house-lizard (being found) at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l. (is a further indication).\n\n17. Should a jujube-tree, along with a *Butea frondosa*, stand to the west, then there is water \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) m. l. deep, the sign being a newt at 1 m. l.\n\n18. Three cubits more to the south of a spot where a Bilva and a glomerous fig-tree stand connected, there will be water at 3 m. l., the indication being a black frog at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l.\n\n19, 20. If an ant-hill is seen near an oppositifolious fig tree, there is a water-vein running in the west, at a depth of \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) m. l. (The tokens are :) whitish clay and a milk-coloured stone. At \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l. will be perceived a mouse of a colour like the water-lily.\n\n21, 22. Where in a waterless region a Kampilla-tree is seen, a southern vein runs at three cubits' distance to the west. First appears (as an indication) clay of a colour like blue lotus and like pigeons; at one cubit is a fish with the smell of a he-goat; below, is a little brackish water.\n\n23. Two cubits more to the north-west of a *Bignonia* is a water-vein, bearing the name of Kumud\u0101, and flowing at 3 m. l.\n\n24.

In the westerly direction, also, is a vein, which will dry up after three years.\n\n27, 28. Where an ant-hill, along with sacrificial grass and indigo,\\(^1\\) is stationed north-east of a Bauhinia, there is water, never drying up, between the tree and the ant-hill, at a depth of \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l. As signs are to be mentioned: a snake of the colour of a lotus calix, at 1 m. l.; red earth, and a coryndon stone.\n\n29, 30. If an Echites is surrounded by ant-hills, it may be predicted that to the north of it is water, at 5 m.l.; the signs being, a yellowish-green frog at \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l., earth like yellow orpiment, and a stone of the colour of a dark cloud; under it is a northern vein yielding good water.\n\n31, 32. A frog being seen under any tree shows that water is to be found at a cubit's distance, at \\(4\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l. At 1 m. l. will be discovered an ichneumon, then dark clay, further on yellow, at last white clay, and a stone of the colour of a frog.\n\n33, 34. In case a snake's abode\\(^2\\) appears standing south of a Karanj-tree, there is a vein in the south at two cubits, at \\(3\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l. depth. At \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l. is a tortoise; and there will then be discovered, first, an eastern vein; further on, a northern vein with sweet water; beneath lies a yellowish-green stone; then again water.\n\n35, 36. An abode of snakes standing north of a Bassia is an indication that water will be found on the western side of the tree, five cubits off, at \\(7\\frac{1}{2}\\) m. l. (The signs are:) first, a big snake at 1 m. l.; then deep-purple earth, and a stone of the colour of dolichos. Beneath is an eastern vein, supplying water which is always foamy.\n\n37. Where a smooth ant-hill, combined with sacrificial and bent grass, stands south of a Tilaka-tree, an eastern vein will be discovered in a westerly direction at 5 m. l.\n\n\\(^1\\) The Comm. reads \u0938\u0915\u0943\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0903 \u0938\u093f\u0924\u094d, and explains accordingly, \"a white ant-hill with sacrificial grass.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) This word and ant-hill are interchangeable terms.\n38, 39. In case an abode of snakes is stationed west of a Nauclea, there is water three cubits from it, at $5\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. It is a northern vein that flows there, having a smell like iron, and inexhaustible. (As tokens will be found:) a gold-tinged frog, at 1 m. l.; and then yellow clay.\n\n40. If either a t\u00e2l or a cocoa-tree be surrounded by ant-hills, there is, six cubits further to the west of it, a southern vein, at 4 m. l.\n\n41, 42. On perceiving an abode of snakes on the west side of a wood apple-tree, one may predict that water will be discovered at seven cubits' distance, by digging 5 m. l. deep. (The signs are): a spotted snake at 1 m. l.; black clay and a protruding stone; white clay. Underneath runs a vein from the west; then another from the north.\n\n43, 44. Should a jujube-tree or a snake's abode appear to the left (i.e. northwards) of an Acmantaka-tree, water will be found six cubits distant, in a northerly direction, at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., (the indications being) a tortoise at 1 m. l., a grey stone, clay mingled with sand. The first vein issues from the southern quarter; the second, from the north-west.\n\n45, 46. Should an ant-hill rise on the left side (i.e. northwards) of a yellow sandal-tree, there will be water three cubits to the east from thence, at $5\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l. (The indications are): a black snake at 1 m. l.; yellow clay and an emerald-like stone; then black earth. First there will be found a vein coming from the west; afterwards another from the south.\n\n47. Where, in a waterless region, the characteristics of an aquatic vegetation, or soft andropogon and bent grass, are conspicuous, there is water at 1 m. l.\n\n48. *Clerodendron syphonanthus*, Ipomoea, Croton, S\u00fbkara-p\u00e2di, Lakshman\u00e2, and double-jessamine denote water to be near, two cubits from thence to the south, at 3 m. l.\n\n---\n\n1 A word \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0940, as given in the dictionaries, has no existence but in corrupt manuscripts; the name of the plant is \u0906\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0940. That this reading of good manuscripts is the only legitimate one is proved by the fact that the plant is also called \u0917\u0941\u0921\u093c\u093f\u092f\u093e, which is, of course, virtually the same with Bh\u00e2rangi.\n49. Bushes and trees, growing low, looking smooth and having their boughs hanging down, have water near them; whereas hollow, coarse trees, with shattered leaves, lack water.\n\n50, 51. If Tilaka, Spondias, Crataeva, marking nut, Bilva, ebony, Alangium, Pinj\u0101ra, Sir\u012bsa, Anjana, Grewia, Dalbergia, and Sida appear very sleek, and surrounded by ant-hills, there is water three cubits from thence to the north, at $4\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l.\n\n52. Where a plot is grown with grass in the midst of a grassless plain, or where a grassless spot is conspicuous in the midst of a soil abounding with grass, a water-vein is indicated; or one may predict that a treasure will be discovered on the spot.\n\n53. Where trees with thorns and those devoid of them grow intermixedly, you will discover three cubits further to the east, by digging $3\\frac{3}{4}$ m. l., water, or, perchance, a treasure.\n\n54. Where the soil, being struck by the feet, sounds deep, there is water, at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l.; the vein issues from the north.\n\n55. If one of the branches of a tree is bent or faded, you will be sure to obtain water beneath the branch after digging 3 m. l.\n\n56. A tree that shows unnatural symptoms in its fruits and blossoms points to a vein, three cubits to the east, at 4 m. l.; under the surface (will appear) a stone and yellow earth.\n\n57. If a Solanum Jacquinii is seen without thorns and with white blossoms, one may predict there is water below, at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l.\n\n58. Where in a waterless country a betelnut-tree shows two tops, it may be asserted for certain that on the west side there will be water, at 3 m. l.\n\n59. In case you see a white blossoming Pterospermum or Butea, there will be water, two cubits to the south, at 3 m. l.\n\n60. Where the ground steams or smokes, there is water at 2 m. l.; and it may be stated that the vein will yield an abundant supply of water.\n\n1 Comm. \u092c\u093e\u0932\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0928\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0917\u094d\u0927\u0915\u093e (v.l. \u0928\u093f\u0926\u093f\u0917\u094d\u0927\u0915\u093e).\n61. Where, on a single spot of a field, the sprouting corn perishes, or looks thin and exceedingly pale, there is a great vein at 2 m. l.\n\n62. Now am I to set forth how a vein is discovered in a desert country. The water-veins run below the earth's surface in the guise of camels' necks (i.e. syphons).\n\n63, 64. If an ant-hill is stationed north-east of a Pilu-tree, there will be water to the west; you may hold for certain that the vein flowing in the north is at the depth of 5 m. l. The first indication is a frog; then red-brown clay; after that yellowish-green clay; at 1 m. l. lies a stone; there is certainly water underneath.\n\n65, 66. Should the ant-hill stand on the eastern side of the Pilu-tree, then it may be predicted that in a southerly direction there is water, at 7 m. l., at a distance of four cubits and a half. (The signs are:) at 1 m. l. a snake, half white, half black, one cubit long. A vein from the south there supplies plenty of brackish water.\n\n67. From a snake's abode standing to the north of a Karil-tree, one may infer that there is sweet water southward, at 10 m. l., the token being a yellow frog at 1 m. l.\n\n68. If to the west of an Andersonia there is an abode of snakes, you will find, at three cubits more to the south, after digging 12 m. l., a western vein of brackish water.\n\n69. An ant-hill being visible to the east of a Terminalia Arjuna indicates that you will come at a vein at a cubit's distance to the west, by digging 14 m. l. (An indication is:) a great brown lizard at 1 m. l.\n\n70, 71. Or, if there be a snake's abode to the left (i.e. north) of any tree denominated after gold, there is water two cubits from thence in a southern direction, at 15 m. l. The water is brackish. (The tokens under the surface are:) an ichneumon at $\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., and a copper-coloured stone along with red earth. The vein is one issuing from the south.\n\n72, 73. Where a jujube-tree and an Andersonia stand conjoined, whether an ant-hill be near or not, there is water three cubits further to the west, at 16 m. l. (Below the surface will be discovered :) first, water of good taste, produced\nby a southern vein; then, a northern vein; at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l. a leaden-hued stone, white clay, and a scorpion.\n\n74. Should a jujube-tree appear conjointly with a Karil, there will be water in the west, three cubits off, at 18 m. l. It is a north-eastern vein, rich in water.\n\n75. On the east side of a jujube combined with a Pilu, water will be found, never drying, but brackish, at 20 m. l.\n\n76. Where a Terminalia Arjuna stands conjointly with a Karil, or with a Bilva, water will be found two cubits further off in the west, at 25 m. l.\n\n77. Should it happen that bent grass and sacrificial grass on the top of an ant-hill appear of a pale yellow colour, then sink a well in the middle thereof, for there is water at 21 m. l.\n\n78. Where bent grass, along with Andropogon serratus,\\(^1\\) is seen growing on an ant-hill, there is water three cubits further off to the south, at 25 m. l.\n\n79, 80. If an Andersonia, conjointly with three other trees of various kinds, is stationed in the midst of three ant-hills, there will be water to the north, at an interval of four cubits sixteen digits, and at a depth of 40 m. l., where a stone will be found, under which the vein runs.\n\n81. At a distance of five cubits, in a westerly direction, from a spot where a knotty Sami-tree is seen, having an ant-hill on its north side, there will be water at 50 m. l.\n\n82. If the middlemost of five ant-hills stationed at one place be white, it indicates a vein at 55 m. l.\n\n83. Where a Sami-tree has a Butea near it, water is on the west side, at 60 m. l. First (you will discover below the surface) a snake at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l.; afterwards yellow clay mixed with sand.\n\n84. One cubit eastward of a spot where a white Andersonia is surrounded by an ant-hill, will be water at 70 m. l.\n\n85. Where a white Sami shows a great many thorns, there is water in a southerly direction, at 75 m. l., while a snake will come to sight at \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) m. l.\n\n\\(^1\\) R. in the text \u0905\u0938\u0941\u0930\u0940\u0915\u093e\u0926\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0915\u0903 as one word, though the Comm. understands it otherwise.\n86. The existence of water in a woody tract of land may not be determined on such indications as apply to a desert only. The number of m. l. which has been given in st. 6, sqq., has to be doubled in the case of a desert.\n\n87, 88, 89. A roseapple-tree and the plants Teori, bowstring hemp, \u00c7icum\u00e2ri, Echites, \u00c7iv\u00e2, \u00c7y\u00e2m\u00e2, Dioscorea, Cardiospermum, Garu\u0111aveg\u00e2, S\u00fbkarika, Glycine and Ricinus, growing by a snake's abode, denote water to be near the ant-hill, three cubits off to the south, at 3 m. l. The latter number applies to a watery country, but for a woody tract the depth is to be fixed at 5 m. l., and for a desert at 7 m. l., if the indications be the same.\n\n90. Where some ground, otherwise uniform and devoid of grass, trees, ant-hills or shrubs, contains a piece of unusual appearance, there is water.\n\n91. And where the earth is smooth, low, sandy or resounding, there is water at $4\\frac{1}{2}$ or 5 m. l.\n\n92. To the south of smooth trees there will be water at 4 m. l. The same may be said, should a tree in the midst of a thick wood show uncommon symptoms.\n\n93. Where the soil slopes downwards, there is water at $1\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., in the case of a woody or watery tract of country. Where insects are frequent, without having their abode in that place, there, too, is water.\n\n94. An isolated cold spot in a warm ground denotes cold water; a single warm spot in a cold ground, warm water, at $3\\frac{1}{2}$ m. l., and at four cubits' distance, if a rainbow, fish or ant-hill be conspicuous.\n\n95. If in a row of ant-hills one is prominent above the rest, there is water beneath it. There is water also, where the corn in the field withers or does not come up at all.\n\n96. A banyan, a Butea and a glomerous fig-tree standing conjoined denote water, at 3 m. l. The same may be said from a banyan and Pipal appearing in close connexion. The vein lies northward.\n\n97. A well being situated in the south-east of a village or town is likely to occasion constant danger from fire and men.\n\n98. A well in the south-west causes loss of children, and\none in the north-west threatens the wife. Wells in any other direction are productive of good.\n\n99. Thus much have I composed in \u0101ry\u0101 couplets, with constant reference to the work, \"Exploration of Watersprings,\" by the Seer S\u0101rasvat\u0101.\u2014I will now expound the system of Manu also, in \u0101ry\u0101 verses.\n\n100. A water-vein will be found in those parts where trees, shrubs and creepers appear covered with entire leaves and smooth; where lotus,\\(^1\\) Asteracantha, Andropogon, Trichosanthes, Cyperus, K\u0101\u00e7a or sacrificial grass, Nalik\u0101 or reed grows.\n\n101, 102. Where betelnut, roseapple, Terminalia Arjuna, rotang wax, or milky trees, shrubs and creepers, or mushrooms, Ricinus, Mesua,\\(^2\\) lotus, Nauclea n\u012bpa, Karanj, and Vitex Negundo; or beleric myrobalan or jessamine; there is water at 3 m. l. Where one hill rises upon another, there also is water at 3 m. l. at the foot.\n\n103. Where the soil abounds with reed-grass, K\u0101\u00e7a and sacrificial grass, and consists of blue clay mingled with gravel, or where the clay is black or red, there is much delicious water.\n\n104. A copper-coloured earth mixed with gravel, yields water of an astringent taste; red-brown earth, brackish water; a pale yellow ground is an indication of salt, and a blue soil of sweet water.\n\n105. Pot-herbs, Vatica robusta, Terminalia Arjuna, Bilva, Shorea, Gmelina arborea, Ruellia (?), Grislea, and Sissoo are signs that water is far off; so, too, are trees, shrubs, and creepers looking coarse and having hollow leaves.\n\n106. A soil the colour of which resembles that of the sun, fire, ashes, camels or asses, is said to be waterless. If the ground be red, and Karil trees exhibit red sprouts and a milky sap, there is water under a stone.\n\n107.

A pond extending in a direction from east to west retains the water much longer than one running from north to south, because the latter is more often exposed to rupture by the agency of billows roused by the wind.

I have formerly,\u00b9 after studying the opinions of Baladeva and others, set forth how rain-water is got after full-moon's day of Jyaishtha. The manner how to find spring-water has, secondly, been told by me, Var\u00e1ha-Mihira, in this chapter, thanks to the Sages.'\n\n---\n\n**Chapter LV.**\n\n*Culture of Trees.*\n\n1. Considering that water reservoirs without shade on the margin are not lovely, one ought to have gardens laid out on the banks of the water.\n\n2. A soft soil is favourable to all sorts of trees. Let one thereon sow sesamum, which must be reaped when in bloom. This is the first work to prepare the ground.\n\n3. Then plant in the garden or by the house, in the first place, auspicious trees, as Arishta, A\u00e7oka, Rottleria, Siris, and Priyangu-trees.\n\n4, 5. Bread-fruit, A\u00e7oka, plantain, rose-apple, Lakucha, pomegranate, grape, P\u00e1livata, citron, and *Gaertnera racemosa*, are trees that, on being smeared with cow-dung, should be\n\n\u00b9 Ch. 23, 1, sqq.\nplanted by slips, or carefully grafted on the root-stump or stem (of a different tree).\u00b9\n\n6. Trees having no branches yet, must be transplanted in the dewy season; those that have their branches developed, in winter-time; and those that are possessed with goodly stems, in the rainy season, care being taken that they are stationed in the particular direction suiting them severally.\n\n7. Let trees, when being transplanted, be smeared all over the stem down to the root with ghee, root of Andropogon, oil wax, worm-seed, milk, and cow-dung.\n\n8. The planter, duly purified, has to pay honour to the tree with washing and unguents before planting it. The tree, once set, will show the same foliage as it had before.\n\n9. When the trees have been planted, they need to be watered morning and evening in summer;\u00b2 during the day in the cold season, and whenever the soil is dry during the rains.\n\n10, 11. Rose-apple, rotang, V\u0101n\u012bra-rotang,\u00b3 Nauclea, globose fig, Terminalia Arjuna, citron, grape, Lakucha, pomegranate, Dalbergia, Karanj, Tilaka, bread-fruit, Timira, and Spondias, are the sixteen trees, which, according to generally received opinion, require a moist ground.\n\n12. The greatest space to be left between two trees is twenty cubits; the middling, sixteen; and the smallest, twelve.\n\n13. Trees which, by growing too near one another, touch each other, and get their roots intermingled, are hindered, and do not yield fruit properly.\n\n\u00b9 Comm.: \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u092e\u0942\u0932\u091a\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0947 \u0939\u093e\u0932\u093e \u0924\u0925\u094d\u092f\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u094b\u092a\u0930\u093f \u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0940\u092f\u094b \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b \u0930\u094b\u092a\u0923\u0940\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0941\u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0927\u0940\u0928\u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0902 \u0939\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0916\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0927\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0915\u094b\u092a\u0930\u093f \u0935\u093f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0940\u092f\u094b \u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b \u0930\u094b\u092a\u0923\u0940\u092f\u0903\u0964 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0902 \u0938\u0943\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0902 \u0926\u093e\u092a\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092f\u0947\u0926\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0965\n\n\u00b2 The reading \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0947\u0924\u0940\u0902 is preferable to \u091a\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0947\u0924\u093f, because the latter does not occur, for aught we know, but in the sense of \u201cend of summer.\u201d; yet, etymologically, it might as well signify \u201cwithin summer-time.\u201d\n\n\u00b3 Vetasa and v\u0101n\u012bra clearly denote two varieties of rotang; the Indian lexicographers know nothing about the difference; for the distinction of plants they are not to be trusted, at least the edited works of Amara, etc.\n14. By the agency of milk, wind or heat, diseases are extinguished, and the growth of plants, shrubs, growth of trees, flowers of trees, and the growing of figs.\n\n20. To heal the trees, first trim them with a knife, then cover them with turmeric, ghee, and wool, and sprinkle them with milk and water.\n\n25. If once a tree loses its power of bearing fruit, a sprinkling with a refrigerated decoction of milk mixed with honey, ghee, beans, wheat, and barley, will be conducive to a new birth of the growth of fruits and blossoms.\n\n30.

The several sorts of soil which we indicated, when treating of house-building, as suited to Brahmans, etc., are likewise recommended to persons of the different classes, when they wish to erect temples.\n\n10. Let the area of a temple always be divided into sixty-four squares, while it is highly commendable to place the middle door in one of the four cardinal points.\n\n11. The height of any temple must be twice its own width, and the flight of steps equal to a third part of the whole height of the edifice.\n\n12. The adytum measures half the extent of the whole, and has its separate walls all around. Its door is \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the adytum in breadth and twice as high.\n\n13. The side-frame of the door has a breadth of \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the altitude; likewise the threshold; the thickness of both door-posts is commonly stated to be equal to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the breadth.\n\n14. A door with three, five, seven, or nine-fold side frames is much approved. At the lower end, as far as the fourth part of the altitude of the doorpost, should be stationed the statues of the two doorkeepers.\n\n15. Let the remaining part be ornamented with (sculptured) birds of good augury, Grivrksha-figures, crosses, jars, couples, foliage, tendrils, and goblins.\n\n16. The idol, along with the seat (i.e. pedestal), ought to have a height equal to that of the door, diminished by \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\), of which two-thirds are appropriated to the image, and one-third to the seat.\n\n17, 18, 19.

The Padma (i.e. lotus) has the shape of a lotus, measures 8 cubits, has one spire, and only one story.\u00b3\n\n24. The Garuda and Nandin show the form of the sun-eagle, are 24 cubits wide, must be constructed with seven stories, and adorned with twenty cupolas.\u2074\n\n25. The Kunjara (i.e. elephant) has a figure like an elephant's back, and is 16 cubits long, and broad at the bottom. The Guhar\u0101ja likewise measures 16 cubits. Both have a roof with three dormer windows.\u2075\n\n26. The V\u1e5bsha (i.e. bull) has a single story and one turret, is everywhere round, and measures 12 cubits. The Hansa has the form of a swan; and the Gh\u0101\u1e6da, being shaped like a water-jar, has an extension of 8 cubits.\u2076\n\n\u00b9 Comm. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u0915\u093e\u0937\u094d\u0920\u092f\u0903:\n\n\u092e\u0926\u0930\u0903 \u0917\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0935\u0941\u0903 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0942\u0932\u093f\u0915\u0903\u0964\n\u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0915\u0930\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092f\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0926\u094b\u093d\u092a\u093f \u0926\u093f\u0935\u094b\u092f\u0903\u0965\n\n\u00b2 A copious description of diverse Vim\u0101nas or pyramidal shrines is to be found in R\u00e1m R\u00e1z, Arch., p. 51, sqq.; and p. 48.\n\n\u00b3 It must be understood that the signs of a Padma apply also to a Samudga, barring the shape.\n\n\u2074 The same is more clearly expressed by K\u0101\u00e7yapa:\n\n\u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u094b \u0917\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0930\u0903 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u0935\u093f\u092d\u0942\u0924\u093f\u0903\u0964\n\u0928\u0935\u0940 \u0924\u0926\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0940\u092f\u0903 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0939\u093f\u0924\u0903 \u092a\u0941\u0937\u0903\u0965\n\u0915\u0930\u0923\u093e \u0918\u091f\u0941\u0918\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0940\u092f\u0903 \u0938\u092e\u092d\u0942\u092e\u093f\u0915\u0903\u0964\n\u0926\u0936\u092d\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0930\u094d\u0926\u0947\u0936\u0947\u0928 \u0927\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093f\u092f\u0902 \u0935\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0935\u0947\u0924\u0941 \u0924\u0947\u0965\n\n\u2075 The Comm. paraphrases \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0903 by \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0903 (v.l. \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0903); in K\u0101\u00e7yapa the word is used as m. or n. \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0903.\n\n\u2076 To a Hansa belong the same qualifications as to the V\u1e5bsha, except-\n27.

The Quadrangle has five cupolas whereas the rest have one only.\n\n29, 30. A story's altitude is of 108 digits, according to Maya, but Viprakarman pronounces it to be of 3 cubits and a half (i.e. 54 digits).

The remaining toes should be less by one-eighth, in succession. The prescribed elevation of the great toe is \\(1\\frac{1}{4}\\) d.\n\n20. The (measure of the) nail of the great toe is by the experts set down at \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) d.; that of the other toes at \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) d., or a little lessened for each succeeding toe.\n\n21. The circuit of the leg at the extremity is stated to be of fourteen, and the breadth of five d.; but in the middle part the width is seven, and the circumference twenty-one.\n\n22. The knees are, in the middle, eight d. in thickness, and twenty-four in circumference. The upper legs are, in their middle part, fourteen d. thick, their circuit being double.\n\n23. The hip is eighteen d. broad and forty-four in circuit. The navel is one d. in depth and in extent.\n\n24. The circumference of the middle, at the height of the navel, is of forty-two digits.

The shoulders should be made eight d. broad. The arms, as well as the fore-arms, measure twelve in length, the arms being six d. broad, and the fore-arms four.\n\n22. The arms measure, at the upper end, sixteen, and at the wrist twelve digits. The palm is six broad and seven long.\n\n23. The middle finger is five d.; the fore-finger is half a joint smaller; the ring-finger is equal to the fore-finger and the little finger less by a whole joint.\n\n24. The thumb must have two joints, while the other fingers have three. The measure of a nail is equal to half a joint of the fingers respectively.\n\n25. An image should be represented in such a way that its equipment, dress, ornaments, and outward form be in agreement with the country. By possessing the required characteristics an idol will by its very presence bestow prosperity.\n\n26. Rama, the son of Dasaratha, and Bali, the son of Vibhavana, are a hundred and twenty digits in height; the others, according to their being of the greatest, middling, or smallest size, measure less, 96, or 84, respectively.\n\n27. Our Lord Vishnu may be represented either with eight arms, with four, or with two arms, his breast being marked by the Gajraja-figure and adorned with the Kaustubha gem.\n\n28. He is darkish as lin blossom, clad in a yellow garment, shows a serene face, wears earrings and a topped crown, and has the neck, chest, shoulders, and arms thick.\n\n29. In his right hands he bears a sword, a club, and an arrow, while with the fourth hand he bestows his blessings.

Of a two-armed image the right hand is (represented as) giving a blessing, and the left as holding a conch. In this manner let the idol of Vish\u1e47u be framed by those who are desirous of happiness.\n\n36. Baladeva must be made having a plough in his hand, with eyes lively from drink, and wearing a single earring. His complexion is fair like a conch shell, the moon, or lotus fibre.\n\n37. The goddess Ek\u0101nan\u00e7\u0101\u00b9 should be made betwixt Baladeva and K\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a, with the left hand resting on her hip, and with the other holding\u00b2 a lotus.\n\n38. If it is intended to make her four-armed, then let her hold a lotus and a book in her left hands, while, on the right, she confers a boon on the supplicants with one hand and holds a rosary in the other.\n\n39. The left hands of an eight-armed Ek\u0101nan\u00e7\u0101 should contain a drinking pot, a bow, a lotus, and a book; the right arms a gift, an arrow, a mirror, and a rosary.\n\n40. S\u0101mba is figured with a club in his hand; Pradyumna as handsome, and holding a bow. Both are accompanied by their wives, bearing a buckler and a sword.\n\n41. Brahman (the Creator) has four faces, a drinking pot in his hand, and is seated on a lotus. Skanda looks boy-like, holds a javelin, and has a peacock for ensign.\n\n42. Indra has a white, four-tusked elephant, in his hand the thunderbolt, and, besides, another characteristic, viz. a third eye placed horizontally on his forehead.\n\n43. \u00c7iva has a crescent on his head, a bull for ensign, and\n\n\u00b9 Ek\u0101nan\u00e7\u0101 is one of the forms of Durg\u0101 in her quality of Hecate; cf.

Or, also, his left part may consist of the half-part of P\u0101rvat\u012b.\n\n44. The Buddha ought to be represented seated upon a lotus, and looking as if he were the father of mankind, with hands and feet marked by lotuses, with a placid countenance, and very short hair.\\(^1\\)\n\n45. The god of the Jainas is figured naked, young, handsome, with a calm countenance, and arms reaching down to the knees; his breast is marked with the \u0106r\u012bvat\u015ba figure.\n\n46. The Sun ought to be made with elevated nose, forehead, lower leg, thigh, cheek and breast, and clad in the dress of the Northerners, so as to be covered from the feet upwards to the bosom.\n\n47. He holds two lotuses growing out of his hands, wears a diadem and a necklace hanging down, has his face adorned with earrings, and a girdle\\(^2\\) round his waist.\n\n48. The Sun when made with a body protected by a corslet, a complexion fair, like the interior of the white water-lily, a smiling and placid face, and a light crown brilliant through the gems, bestows bliss upon the maker.\n\n49. A statue (of him) one cubit high is beneficial; one that measures two cubits in altitude brings wealth; an image of three cubits promotes peace; and one of four, abundance.\n\n50. An idol (of the Sun) with excessive limbs bodes peril from the monarch; one with undersized limbs, infirmity to the maker; one with a thin belly, danger of famine; one that is lean, loss of wealth.\n\n51. When it shows a wound, you may predict the maker's death by the sword. By being bent to the left, it destroys his wife; by being bent to the right, life.\n\n52.

Sink the quadrangular portion into a pit in the earth, and put the middle member into the cavity of the pedestal. The pedestal is visible upwards to its cavity, in all directions, over an extent equal to its height.\\(^2\\)\n\n55. A phallus being excessively lean and long, destroys the country; one which has lost its side, tends to the ruin of the town; one damaged at the top is pernicious.\n\n56.

The solemn ingress into the forest ought to take place on a day propitious to the maker, calculated by the astrologer and boding luck, when, moreover, the auguries are favourable for setting out.\n\n2, 3, 4. Trees growing on cemeteries, roads, temple precincts, ant-hills, public gardens, hermitages, sacred spots, near river confluences, or such trees as require being watered from jars, or such as are stinted, hurt by younger or upspringing trees and creepers, or injured by lightning and wind, or fallen spontaneously, damaged by elephants, sear, parched by fire, or inhabited by bees,\u2014all such have to be avoided; whereas those with sleek leaves, blossoms, and fruits, insure good luck. On going to the tree selected, let one pay worship to it with an oblation and flowers.\n\n5. Propitious to Brahmans are Deodar, sandal-tree, Sami and Bassia. Soap-berry, Pipal, Khayir, and Bilva-tree promote the prosperity of Kshatriyas.\n\n6. Terminalia tomentosa, Khayir, Seduari and Dalbergia promise well to Vai\u00e7yas; and ebony, Rottleria, Terminalia tomentosa, Terminalia Arjuna, mango and Shorea, to \u00c7\u00fbdras.\n\n7. Mark the quarters on the tree, as well as its upper and lower end, since a phallus or an idol ought to be thus placed that its sides are turned to the same directions.\n\n8. Let due honour be paid to the tree with milk porridge, sweetmeats, boiled rice, curds, sesasum seeds, partially squeezed out,\\(^1\\) spouted cakes,\\(^2\\) and such like, along with spirituous liquors, flowers, incense, and perfumes.\n\n9. In the night do worship to the gods, Manes, imps,\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm.\n\n\\(^2\\) Utpala gives no definition of *ullopik\u0101*, which at any rate is a sort of sweetmeat; *ullup* means \u201cto bedrop, to spout,\u201d not as the Dict. of B. and R. i. v. has it, \u201cto pick up, to take out.\u201d\ngiants, serpents, demons, goblins, urchins,\\(^1\\) etc., and, in touching the tree, say:\n\n10. \"Thou art destined to serve for the idol of such and such a god. Hail to thee, O tree! accept our worship fittingly.\"\n\n11. \"May those beings who are living here, on receiving our tribute of honour paid in due form, take up their abode elsewhere! May they now excuse us! Reverence be to them!\"\n\n12. The next morning, having sprinkled the tree with water, begin to cut it on its north-eastern side with an axe smeared with honey and ghee, and proceed cutting in such a way as to keep the tree always to your right.\n\n13. If the tree comes down to the east, north-east, or north, it brings good speed; its coming down to the south-east, south, and so forth, will have for results, respectively, burning by fire, famine, sickness, loss of horses.\n\n14. The omens observed at the cutting and falling down, as well as the tokens seen in the interior of the timber-wood, which are not mentioned in this chapter, have previously been indicated by me in the chapters on Indra's banner and on house-building. Those have to be taken into account on this occasion also.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter LX.**\n\n*Setting up of Statues.*\n\n1. Let a skilled man construct in the north\\(^2\\) or east a shed for the inauguration ceremony, with four archways, and covered with sprouts from auspicious trees.\n\n2. For the east side of the shed are prescribed variegated wreaths and streamers; for the south-east side, red ones; for the south and south-west, black ones.\n\n3. They must be white in the west, pale yellow in the\n\n\\(^1\\) Comm. \u0935\u093f\u0932\u093e\u092f\u0915\u093e \u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:, i.e. vexing spirits, or in German \"Poltergeister.\"\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. has y\u0101my\u0101ydm, \"in the south.\"\nnorth-west, variegated on the north side, and yellow in the north-east.\n\n4. An idol, being of wood or clay, promises long life, fortune, strength, and victory; one of precious stone, tends to the weal of the people at large; a golden one yields prosperity.\n\n5. One of silver bestows renown; one of copper, increase of progeny. A statue or phallus of stone insures a great acquirement of ground.\n\n6. An image being hurt by a pin kills a person of eminence and the family; one being damaged with a pit, produces diseases and endless calamities.\n\n7. After smearing (with cow-dung) a plot of ground within the shed, and strewing it with sand, then, with sacrificial grass, lay the head, pillow, and feet of the statue on a throne.\n\n8, 9, 10. Let the image, with the head to the east, be bathed with an infusion of wavy-leaved fig, Pipal, glomerous fig, Sir\u00ees, and banyan, mixed with all sorts of auspiciously named plants, with sacrificial and other grass, with clay dug up by elephants and bulls from mountains, ant-hills, confluences, river banks, and lotus-grown lakes, joined to water from holy bathing-places and the five products of cows,\\(^1\\) the whole combined with scents and water containing gold and jewels. Let the bathing be performed amid the sounds of various musical instruments, solemn shouts, and the recital of holy texts.\n\n11. Eminent Brahmans have to mutter prayers addressed to Indra, in the east; prayers to Agni, in the south-east; for doing which they ought to be honourably rewarded.\n\n12. Let the special priest make an offering also to Fire, with prayers addressed to the god whose idol is being consecrated. The symptoms of the fire have been indicated by me in treating of the raising of Indra's banner.\n\n13. A fire wholly shrouded with smoke, turned to the left and casting sparks at every instant, is not auspicious. The reciting priest's failing in his memory or stepping forward is pronounced to be unpropitious.\n\n\\(^1\\) Viz., cow's stale, dung, milk, curds, and ghee.\n14. When the statue has been bathed, clad in a new garment, smartly adorned and honoured with flowers and perfumes, let the person, whose function it is to set it up, put it on a nicely-spread bed.\n\n15. After the sleeping idol has been consecrated with wakes, dancing, and song, they have to proceed to its setting up at a period indicated by the astrologer.\n\n16. Let the image, worshipped with flowers, unguents, amid the sounds of horns and musical instruments, be led, with all precaution, round the shrine, in such a manner that the latter is always kept on the right side.\u00b9\n\n17. Thereupon, make a copious oblation to treat Brahmins and fashionable people, and, after a piece of gold has been deposited in the cavity of the seat, let the image be placed upon the base.\n\n18. By particularly honouring the setter-up, astrologer, Brahmins, fashionable people, and carpenter, one shall inherit good things in this world, and heaven in the next.\n\n19. The priests of Vishnu are generally styled Bh\u0101gavatas; those of the Sun, Magi; of \u00c7iva, Ash-smear\u00e8d priests;\u00b2 those of the divine Mothers, are termed Adepts in the rites of the Mothers\u2019 circle; those of Brahman, Priests; the followers of the all-benevolent Saint (i.e. the Buddha) are known as \u00c7\u0101kyas; those of the Jinas, as Naked Monks. These different priests have to perform, agreeably to the rule peculiar to each sect, the ceremony in honour of the god of whom they are the devotees.\n\n20, 21. The raising of idols is favourable when the sun is in his northern course, the moon during the bright half of the month being stationed in a sign, half-sign, etc., of Jupiter\u2019s domain, an immovable sign and immovable\u00b3 ninth-\n\n\u00b9 Comm. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u092f\u093e\u0938\u0928\u092e\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0923\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e\u092f \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0915\u0947\u0928 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0947\u0928\u0941\u0939\u0948 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093f\u0924\u0964\n\u00b2 Comm. \u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u092a\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0903\u0964\n\u00b3 Comm. \u0935\u0943\u0937\u0915\u0941\u092e\u094d\u092d\u094b\u0930\u094d\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0924\u094d\u0935\u092e\u094d\u0964 \u0924\u0925\u093e\u092c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093f\u0902\u0936\u0941\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093f-\u092e\u0940\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0947 \u0938\u094d\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0935\u093e\u0902\u0936\u0915\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092f\u0964\npart being on the horizon, the benevolent planets standing in\nthe fifth, ninth, first, fourth, seventh, or tenth House, and the\nmalign in the Houses of Increase (i.e. third, sixth, tenth, and\neleventh), whilst the lunar asterism of the date may be some\nof the fixed or mild ones,\u00b9 \u00c7ravana, Tishya or Sv\u0101ti, on a fit\nday of the week, Tuesday excepted.\n\n22. Here have I given in succinct form a general descrip-\ntion of a ceremony that tends to the weal of everybody, but\nin the work of S\u0101vitra\u2019s, the inauguration and setting up are\ntreated separately.\n\nChapter LXI.\n\nSigns of Cows.\n\n1. Henceforth I give a brief account of the knowledge\nof the good and evil signs of cows which Par\u0101\u00e7ara of yore\ncommunicated to Brhadratha. As a general rule, all cows\nare of good omen; yet I will enumerate the divers charac-\nteristics in conformity to authoritative lore.\n\n2. Kine with dripping, filthy, coarse, or mouse-like eyes\nbring no good; nor those that have wavering, flat horns, are\ndark red or of the colour of donkeys.\n\n3, 4. Cows with ten, seven, or four teeth, with drooping\nhornless head, depressed back, short thick neck, a middle\nshaped like a barleycorn, split hoofs, a blackish excessively\nlong tongue, very slender or very big ankles, too large hump,\nlean body, and having too few or superfluous limbs, are held\nin bad esteem.\n\n5.

As in the larger and almost-regal treasure trove of Kooch Bih\u00e1r, the specimens in the present instance prove to be essentially of home or indigenous fabric. With the exception of a single northern piece of the supreme Sult\u00e1n of India, they are one and all the produce of the mints of Bengal proper, and mark with singular fidelity the varied incidents of the alternate rise and fall of the provincial governors during the unsettled relations existing between suzerain and vassal from A.H. 614 to 627, when Altamsh came into real and effectual possession of the south-eastern portion of his Empire.\n\nOne of the most instructive facts disclosed by these few pieces is, that the rich and comparatively undisturbed territory of Bengal felt the want of a supply of silver money long before a similar demand arose in the harassed provinces of the north-west. The southern coins date, as far as can be seen, some nine years prior to Altamsh\u2019s earliest effort at a silver coinage in his northern dominions; and even Riz\u00e1jah\u2019s silver money of deferred date bears every token of exclusive manufacture in the subordinate Lakhnaut\u00ed mint.\n\nI have already quoted the testimony of Minh\u00e1j-us-Sir\u00e1j, to the effect, that on the first conquest of Bengal by the Muslims, they found no metallic or other circulating media of exchange except that supplied by couriers; even the compromise of the mixed silver and copper jitals of the various Hind\u00fa dynasties of the central R\u00e1jp\u00fat tribes was unknown in the sea-board marts of the south.\n\nThe chronicles of the proximate kingdom of Orissa, whose boundaries touched if they did not often trench upon the ancient kingdom of Gaur, explain how so infinitesimal\n\n---\n\n1 J.R.A.S.

It would appear, from the official records preserved in the Temple at P\u00far\u00ed, that although there was no silver money in use, gold in convenient weights, if not in the form of absolute coin,\\(^1\\) was freely interchangeable with the more bulky heaps of cowries. In these same official Palm-leaf documents we find the powerful King of Orissa, Anang Bhim Deo (A.D. 1174\u20131201), describing the geographical limits of his kingdom, specifying, with close exactitude, its now proved superficial area (39,407 square miles); and adding that, as the revenues of his predecessors of the Kesar\u00ed line had amounted, with a more limited extent of territory, to 15,00,000 marhs of gold, so his own added boundaries had raised the State income to 35,00,000 marhs. Mr. Stirling (our most trusted Revenue authority), relying upon still-extant local tradition, defined the marh at 5 m\u00e1shas\\(^2\\) weight;\\(^3\\) while Dr. Hunter, under later and more vague native inspiration, pronounces it to be \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of a karish\u00e1, which measure may be assumed to represent the local pronunciation of the old widely-spread karsha of Manu, corresponding with the normal weight of the gold suvarna, i.e. 80 ratis.\\(^3\\) Taking the rati at 1\u00b775 grains, this will make Mr. Stirling\u2019s return amount to 43\u00b775 grains \\((5 \\times 5 = 25; 25 \\times 1\u00b775 = 43\u00b775)\\) per marh; whereas Dr. Hunter\u2019s estimate, under the same figures, would only produce 35 grains \\((140 \\div 4 = 35)\\); but, as he assumes the modern karish\u00e1 to be equal to \u201cone Tol\u00e1h or one Rupee\u201d of our modern system,\u2014the amount of which however he does not further define,\\(^4\\)\u2014and taking the 180 grain total as the said to have been built by Mukund Deo, the last Gajpati of Orissa.\u201d\u2014Blochmann, As.

Dr. Hunter, like myself, has endeavoured to make his antiquarian researches instructive in their application to the defects of our own government in India, consequent upon the too frequent disregard of the superior local knowledge and hereditary instincts of the races we are appointed to rule over.\n\nAfter enumerating the ascertained totals of the revenue of the province at various periods, the author goes on to say, \"From time immemorial Orissa, like some other parts of India, has used a local currency of cowries. When the province passed into our hands in 1803, the public accounts were kept and the revenue was paid in these little shells.\" We \"however stipulated that the landholders should henceforth pay their land-tax in silver, and fixed the rate of exchange at 51\u00b720 cowries to the rupee.\" (In 1804 the official exchange was 5120, and the practical rate of exchange from 6460 to 7680.) . . . . \"Had our first administrators contented themselves with taking payment in silver at the current rate of the cowrie exchange, the Orissa land-tax would now have been double what it is at present. But had they resolved to collect it at a grain valuation, according to Akbar's wise policy, it would now be more than double; for the prices of food have rather more than doubled since 1804. The system of paying the land-tax by a grain valuation appears to me to be the best means of giving stability to the Indian revenues.\"\u2014Orissa, ii., p. 172. Dr. Hunter had not seen my notice of \"The Revenues of the Mughal Empire\" (Tr\u00fcbner, 1872) when this was written. I had equally appreciated the equity and suitability of the system of estimate by agricultural produce, which had come down to Akbar's time from the earliest dawn of the civilization of the nation at large; but I had to condemn Akbar for introducing a new element in the shape of a settlement to be paid in silver, on the average of the prices of previous years\u2014an assessment he hoped, in defiance of the proverbial uncertainty of Indian seasons, to make immutable; furnishing, in effect, the leading idea wo so unwisely followed in that deplorable measure, Lord Cornwallis's \"Permanent Settlement of Bengal.\"\n\n1 Prinsep's Essays, U.T., p. 7.\n2 Chronicles of Path\u00e1n Kings, pp. 3, 167, 223, 224 (note). Dr. A. Weber, in the Zeitschrift for 1861, p. 139, cites the parallel designation of Sata Kris\u00e1na, from the text of the Black Yajur Veda (circa 800 B.C.). The commentator uses the local name above quoted.\nestimates rests upon so erratic a test as the growth of the seed of the Gunj\u00e1 creeper (*Abrus precatorius*), under the varied incidents of soil and climate. Nevertheless this small compact grain, checked in early times by other products of nature, is seen to have had the remarkable faculty of securing a uniform average throughout the entire continent of India, which only came to be disturbed when monarchs, like Sh\u00edr Sh\u00e1h and Akbar, in their vanity, raised the weight of the coinage without any reference to the number of *ratis* inherited from Hind\u00fa sources as the *given* standard, officially recognized in the old, but altogether disregarded and left undefined in the reformed Muhammadan mintages.\n\nI may as well take this opportunity of disposing of the other technical questions bearing upon the general subject; and, without recapitulating the investigations elsewhere given at large,\u00b9 I may state generally, that I understand the *rati* to have been 1\u00b775 grains, the 100-*rati* piece\u2014reproduced in the ordinary Dehli *tankah*\u2014175 grains. The R\u00e1jp\u00fat *jital*, composed of mixed silver and copper, preserved in the early Dehli currencies of the Muslims, is $\\frac{1}{4}$ in value of the 175-grain silver coin; but the number of *jitals* in any given composite piece was dependent upon the proportional amount of the silver added to the ruling copper basis. The *k\u00e1ni*, like the *jital*, is $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the *tankah*; but the *k\u00e1ni* is found to be the practical as well as the theoretical divisor, applicable alike to land and other measures, preserving its more special identity in the southern peninsula. Both terms have now been found in conjunction on a single piece of Metropolitan fabric, where the *jital* is authoritatively declared to be of the value of one *k\u00e1ni*.\u00b2 In more advanced days under the Path\u00e1ns, immense quantities of pieces were coined to meet the current exchange answering to $\\frac{1}{8}$ or $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the *tankah*; and under Muhammad Tughlak, amid other useful breaks in the too-uniform descending scale of the small change, a new division was introduced, in the form\n\n\u00b9 Numismatic Chronicle (n.s.), iv., p. 40, et seqq.

Of course these rates were constantly liable to fluctuation. Indeed, we can trace the effect of the influx of the gold of the Dakhin, after its conquest, in the fall of that metal, evidenced by the obvious readjustment of the weights of the gold and silver coinage at the Imperial seat of Government. But the copper rate must have had a very extended lease of immutability, as this ratio of $64:1$ was maintained from the most primitive ages up to the time of Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1488\u20131517).\n\nAs regards the application of these data to the examples specially under review, it would seem that the Bengal silver coinage was, from the first, deficient in weight in reference to the corresponding issues of the Dehli mint; but the Dehli silver coins were avowedly designed to fall in with the concurrent gold pieces of identical weight, and of full standard in metal: whereas we must suppose that the Lakhnauti silver pieces, in introducing a new element, were graduated to exchange in even sums against the extant gold currency of Bengal and Orissa. Now the gold *mark* weighed, as we have seen, $43\\cdot75$ grains, which, with gold as $1$ to $8$ of silver, would require $350$ grains of the latter metal as its equiva-\n\n---\n\n1 I was mistaken in my first impression that the Bengal *tankahs* themselves might have a claim to this obnoxious designation.

In my previous article in this Journal, I was led by Ibn Batutah's indiscriminate use of the terms \"Dirhams and Dinars,\" in their local application in Bengal, to suppose that his definition of coin exchanges referred to the relative values of gold and silver, and that it in so far supported my estimate of $1:8$ (J.R.A.S., II., p. 61, note 1). I now find that towards the close of Muhammad bin Tughlak's reign, the exchange had come for the moment to be $1:10$ (\"Chronicles\", p. 227), in lieu of the ordinary $1:8$. The entire difficulty of the obscure passage in the Journal of the African Voyager has, however, been set at rest by the more comprehensive tables of values furnished by the Egyptian traveller Shaikh Mubarak *Anbati* (Notices et Extraits, xiii., p. 51), which shows that the *dirar* of silver (*i.e.* the *tankah*) was equal to $8$ dirhams (*hashi-kani*).

On the definite appointment of 'Ali Mard\u00e1n Khilj\u00ed to the kingdom of Bengal by Kutb-ud-d\u00edn Aibeg, he paid his devoirs to the new Viceroy by meeting him on the K\u00fasi, and accom-\n\nafter his first success against the King of Bengal at Nuddea (lat. 23\u00b0 26', long. 85\u00b0 22'), contented himself with destroying that town, and withdrew his troops nearer to his base of communications, to a position about 90 miles to the northward, somewhere about the site of the future Lakhnauti, Deok\u00f3t again being some 60 miles N.N.E.\n\nMinh\u00e1j-us-Sir\u00e1j, in describing Lakhn\u00e1ti, at a later date (641 A.H.), mentions that habitations were located on both sides of the Ganges, but that the city of Lakhnauti proper was situated on the western bank. The author adds, that an embankment or causeway (\u062c\u0633\u0631) extended for a distance of ten days' journey through the capital from Deok\u00f3t to Nagore in Birbh\u00f3m, (lat. 23\u00b0 56', long. 87\u00b0 22').\u2014Stewart's Bengal, p. 57.

Gour was the capital, forming the centre division, and surrounded by five great provinces.\n\n\"1. Barendra, bounded by the Mahananda on the west; by the Padma, or great branch of the Ganges, on the south; by the Kortoya on the east; and by adjacent governments on the north.\n\n\"2.

The author continues, \"It is possible that the R\u00e1ja only retired to his remote capital, Bikramp\u00far, near Dacca, where there still resides a family possessing considerable estates, who pretend to be his descendants. We also find that Soonergong, in the vicinity of Bikramp\u00far, continued to be a place of refuge to the Gour malcontents, and was not finally subjugated until long after the overthrow of R\u00e1ja Laksmana.\"\u2014Hamilton's Hindust\u00e1n (1820), i., p. 114.\n\nText, p. 168.\u2014Stewart's Bengal, p. 51.

When Kutb-ud-d\u00edn died at L\u00e1hor, in 607 A.H., 'Ali Mard\u00e1n assumed independence under the title of 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn; but after a reign of about two years, he was slain by the Khilj\u00ed nobles, and His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn was thereupon elected in his stead (608 A.H.). History is silent as to when he first arrogated kingly state, and merely records Shams-ud-d\u00edn Altamsh\u2019s expedition against him in 622 A.H., with the object of enforcing his allegiance to the Imperial crown, when, after some doubtful successes, peace was established on the surrender of 38 elephants, the payment of 80 laks [of tankahe?], and the distinct recognition of Altamsh\u2019s suzerainty in the public prayers, with the superscription of his titles on the local coinage. The Emperor, on his return towards Dehli, made over the government of Bih\u00e1r to \u2019Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn J\u00e1mi, who, however, was not long left undisturbed, for the Southern potentate speedily re-annexed that section of his former dominions,\u2014an aggression which was met, in A.H. 624, by the advance of N\u00e1sir-ud-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad, the eldest son of Altamsh, in force, who, in the absence of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn \u2019Awz on distant enterprises, succeeded in obtaining possession of the new seat of Government. In the subsequent engagement the Bengal army was defeated, and Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn killed, after a reign estimated by the local annalist at 12 years.\n\nThis is all the information we are able to gather from the incidental biographical notices furnished by our sole authority, Minh\u00e1j-us-Sir\u00e1j, that most intelligent employ\u00e9 of the Rulers of Dehli, and welcomed visitor at the Court of Lakhnaut\u00ed in A.H. 641, where he saw and appreciated the material undertakings of this self-made king, whose memory he lauds enthusiastically. A tribute Altamsh had virtually anticipated, when he was at last permitted to behold the glories of his adversaries\u2019 capital, in 627 A.H., and then conceded the tardy justice of decreeing, that in virtue of his good works, Ghi\u00e1s-ud-d\u00edn \u2019Awz should, in his grave, be endowed with\n\n---\n\n1 Allowing 'Al\u00ed Mard\u00e1n from 607-8 to 609-10, this leaves an interval up to 612, during which His\u00e1m-ud-d\u00edn \u2019Awz was content to remain head of the Khilj\u00ed oligarchy and local governor.\nThe date of A.H. 614, the earliest numismatic record connected by the Banga Minta, is further remarkable as the epoch of Alauddin's final assertion of supremacy on the defeat of his last powerful competitor in Hindustan, Nasir-ud-din Khusroh, after he had already disposed of his other prominent rival, Taj-ud-din Ilduz, in 612 A.H. The issue of these provincial coins, at this conjuncture, would seem to attest the first voluntary recognition of Alamsh by Hisam-ud-din 'Azz, who was at this time in undisturbed possession of Bengal and its dependencies. The adoption of the Cavalier device on the obverse may have been suggested by the conventional acceptance of that design on the money of the\n\n---\n\n1 Tarakhi-i-Nasiri, Tezir, p. 163. Dr. Blochmann has an interesting paper in the September number of the Indian Antiquary (p. 259) on Muhammadan Titles. Among other questions discussed is the derivation and early application of the title of Sultan. The author remarks that \"the first clear case of Sultan having been used as a title belongs to the time of Rukn-ud-danlah, deputy over Fars, under the Khalifah Al Mut'adid,\" A.H. 338, or A.D. 949. MM.

In the new mintage, however, the R\u00e1jput horseman with his spear is superseded by the T\u00farki Cavalier with the historical mace,\\(^1\\) and the general outline of the coarse Northern steed may perchance have been heightened to record a triumph, or to carry a menace to the subjected Beng\u00e1l\u00eds,\\(^2\\) who had left their king to escape ignominiously, and virtually surrendered their capital to the eighteen troopers of Muhammad Bakhty\u00e1r's advance guard.\n\nAmong other peculiarities of these coins is the tenor of their legends, which differ from the ordinarily adopted Imperial intitulations of the Sult\u00e1n, who is here designated as \\(\\text{\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0627\u0646}\\), the slave or freedman of Kutb-ud-d\u00edn Aibeg,\u2014a term which may have concealed a latent taunt to one who was now supreme in the chance virtue of his arms, or may otherwise indicate the independent Khilj\u00ed method of discriminating the followers of Kutb-ud-d\u00edn as opposed to the Mu\u2019izz\u00ed faction of the nobles of Hind\u00fast\u00e1n, who had already tried conclusions with each other, to the disadvantage of the latter.\n\n\\(^1\\) Mahm\u00f3d of Ghazn\u00ee\u2019s favourite weapon.

So much credence was attached to this ancient legend, that we find Lord Ellenborough in 1842 instructing his generals, in sober earnestness, to \u201cbring away from the tomb of Mahm\u00f3d of Ghazn\u00ee his club which hangs over it.\u201d Muhammad Bakhty\u00e1r himself had also won glory by the use of his mace in his gladiatorial encounter, single-handed, with an elephant, who was compelled to retreat before the first blow of his powerful arm.\n\n\\(^2\\) The name of \\(\\text{Aswapatis}\\), \u201cLords of Horses,\u201d was subsequently applied specifically in Orissa to the Muhammadan conquerors.

During this period the Gajapatis, \u2018Lords of Elephants,\u2019 ruled in Orissa and the north of Madras; the Narapatis, \u2018Lords of Men,\u2019 held the country to the southward.

The all-powerful 'Al\u00e1-ud-d\u00edn Muhammad Kh\u00e1rim\u00ed, whose outposts extended over so large a portion of Asia, had been coining money in the inconvenient proximity of Ghazn\u00ed throughout the years 613, 614\u2013616 A.H.;\u00b9 and no one could foretell when he might follow the ordinary precedent, and advance into Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. As fate determined, however, it was left to his son Jal\u00e1l-ud-d\u00edn to swim the Indus, at the risk of his life, as a fugitive before the hosts of Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n, in 618 A.H.\n\nThe mention of Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n suggests to me the desirability of repeating a correction, I have already recorded elsewhere, of a singular delusion, shared alike by native copyists and English commentators, regarding one of the supposed incidents of the sufficiently diversified career of this scourge of the world, to the effect that his unkempt savages had penetrated down to the impossible limit of the lower Ganges. The whole series of mistakes, Asiatic or European, may now be traced back to a simple clerical error in the transcription from a chance leading copy of the ordinarily rare work of Minh\u00e1j-us-Sir\u00e1j\u2014where the name of Chang\u00edz Kh\u00e1n has been substituted for the more obvious designation of the ancient town of J\u00e1n\u00edgar.\n\n\u00b9 J.R.A.S. IX., p. 381; XVII., p. 202; Chronicles of Path\u00e1n Kings, p. 86.\nModern authors, examining a single passage, might well have felt reserve in reconstructing at hazard a primary version; but the editors of the Calcutta official printed text have gone so far towards perpetuating the enigma they were unable to unravel, as to add to the difficulties of solution by making Changiz Kh\u00e1n fight (so far on his way to Lakhnaut\u00ed) the memorable battle of Perw\u00e1n [35\u00b0 9' N., 69\u00b0 16' E.] on the conveniently converging site of Budaon (p. 348), which was situated on one of the favourite main lines of transit to the south, east of the Ganges. This conglomeration is, however, the less excusable, as Stewart, in his History of Bengal, had already pointed out Ferishtah\u2019s palpable mistake to the same effect; and the editors themselves unconsciously admit the preferable variant of \u062c\u0627\u062c\u067e\u0648\u0631 inserted in the foot-note, p. 199. Dr. Hunter, I see, in his new work on Orissa (ii. 4), incautiously follows Stewart\u2019s first impressions, in the notion that the \u201cvanity\u201d of Muhammadan historians had intentionally \u201cconverted the attack of the humble Orissians into an invasion of Tartars\u201d (Stewart, p. 62).\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Stirling, in his most exhaustive memoir on Orissa, published in the Asiatic Researches in 1822, observes:\u2014\u201cMajor Stewart, in his History of Bengal, places an invasion of Orissa by the Mussalmans of Bengal during this reign, that is A.D. 1243. The Chronicles of the country contain no mention of such an event. I have not Major Stewart\u2019s authorities at hand to refer to, but strongly suspect that he has been led into an error by mistaking some word resembling Jaipur, for Jaipur in Orissa. He expresses himself thus: \u2018In the year 614 (A.D. 1243), the Raja of Jagepur (Orissa) having given some cause of offence, Toghrul Khan marched to Ketasun, on the frontier of Jagepur, where he found the army of the Raja had thrown up intrenchments to oppose him.\u2019 Now, in the first place, Jaipur was never a separate principality, as here described; and there is no such place in Orissa as Ketasun. Ferishtah is altogether silent on this subject in his history of Bengal, but in his general history he ascribes the siege of Gour, in the very year in question, to a party of Mogul Tartars who had invaded Bengal by way of Chitta, Thibet, etc. Dow\u2019s mistake of a similar nature is scarcely worth noticing. He makes Sultan Balu pursue the rebel Toghral into Jajnagar (A.D. 1279), which he calls Orissa, whereas it is evident from the mention of Sunargoon as lying on the road, that Jajnagar is some place beyond the Ganges.\u201d \u2014Stirling, As. Res. xv., p. 274.\n\nIt seems to have escaped Mr. Stirling\u2019s notice, that Stewart had already corrected his own error in speaking of \u201cJagepore\u201d as \u201cOrissa,\u201d pp. 61 and 65, by placing that town in its proper position in \u201cTipperah,\u201d in a later passage (p. 70); and he further improved upon his advanced knowledge by saying in a note, at p. 72, \u201cJagenagar is said to have been a town in Orissa, near Cuttack; but this passage proves it to have been situated on the eastern side of the Burhampooter. The Jagenagar mentioned by Ferishtah should have been written Jagepore.\u201d [?] Stewart, Hist. Bengal, p. 72. Dow, i. p. 202 (4to. edit.). Briggs, i. p. 260.

There are two coins of this type in his collection in the British Museum. Maraden remarks, \u201cThe date of this coin, the earliest of those belonging to the princes who governed Bengal in the name of the Kings of Dehli, but who took all opportunities of rendering themselves independent, is expressed distinctly in words. . . . The titles and patronymics of the Sult\u00e1n by whom it was struck are for the most part illegible; not so much from obliteration, as from the original imperfect formation of the characters.\u201d\n\n2 The term \u064a\u062f\u064a is of frequent occurrence on the early Muslim coinages, and is usually associated with the name of the officer\u2014whatever his condition\u2014responsible for the mint issues, as \u0639\u0644\u064a \u064a\u062f\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f which is translated by Fr\u00e6hn as \u201cmanibus\u201d (i.e. cur\u00e2 et oper\u00e2), Ahmadie or \u201ccurante,\u201d\u2014a definition accepted in later days on the Continent as \u201cpar les mains de, par les soins de,\u201d etc.\nof a specific date, with the still more unusual definition of the day of the month, which is preserved constant and unvaried throughout the entire issue. More remarkable still is the abnormal departure from the conventional form of coin legends, in the omission of the preliminary \"Al Sult\u00e1n,\" and the abrupt introduction of the regnal title of the once probational His\u00e1m-ud-din, under his more ambitious designation of Ghi\u00e1s-ud-din. In short, the entire drift of the altered superscription points to an intentional reproduction of some formal phraseology, such as would be eminently consistent with an official transcript of the revered precept emanating from Baghd\u00e1d.\n\nI should infer from these coincidences that a formal diploma had by this time been conceded by the Supreme Pontiff, admitting the newly-erected kingdom of Bengal within the boundaries of Isl\u00e1m, and confirming the reigning monarch in possession, with added titles and dignities. The date so prominently repeated may either be that upon which the patent was originally sealed, or more probably it points to the auspicious moment of the reception of the ambassadors, who conveyed the formal document and paraphernalia of investment, at the Court of Lakhnaut\u00ed. This assignment in no way disturbs my previous attribution of the inaugural piece of Altamsh,\\(^1\\) marking his attainment of the like honours in A.H. 626. The very concession to the Bengal potentate possibly led his once suzerain to seek a parallel sanctification of his own rights, which he had previously been content to hold by the sword: and the difficulty of communication with Baghd\u00e1d over alien kingdoms and disturbed frontiers would account for a delay of the emissaries on the one part and the other, which would not affect the open ocean passage between the mouths of the Ganges and the sea port of Bussorah.\n\nIn the present instance it would seem to imply a more or less direct intervention by the Commander of the Faithful himself in favour of his nominee.\n\n\\(^1\\) Initial Coinage of Bengal, J.R.A.S.

But the year 691 A.H. may be said to inaugurate a new era, represented by the mintsages of the more firmly-established local kings of the family of Nasir-ud-din Mahmud, the son of Balban, who, perhaps wisely, preferred the placid repose of a quasi-viceroyalty at Lakhnauti, to the turmoils of the Imperial throne, to which he was the acknowledged heir.

Proceedings, November, 1871, p. 247.\nof regnant vassals in partibus infidelium against absent Muhammadan Emperors.\n\nThere is nothing, however, to cause surprise in the assumption of royal titles by Tughril on this occasion, as, although he had been a firm adherent of the Empress Riziah, had been endowed by her with the honours of the red umbrella, and had coined assiduously the only silver money bearing her name hitherto discovered, his devotion to the Imperial throne was confessedly shaken after her death, and in this self-same year, 640 A.H., taking advantage of the weakness of the reigning monarch at Dehli, he proceeded to annex the province of Karra M\u00e1nikp\u00far, which in itself constituted an overt act of rebellion against his Suzerain.\u00b9\n\nThe next division of the Initial Coinage of Bengal brings us into much more definite contact with the realities of medi\u00e6val remains, and reminds me that on my first endeavour to identify the Kai K\u00e1\u00fas of the Kooch Bih\u00e1r coins, I was obliged to crave indulgence in the mere reading of the dates so incoherently defined on his mintages. I had, for the time, to abandon all faith in the units, to claim only dubious credence for the decimals; though the hundreds necessarily remained beyond cavil, even had the Bengal Mint-officials blundered in the definition of the alien Semitic legends with more than their accustomed licence.\n\nI was, however, venturesome enough on that occasion to suggest\u2014in dotted lines and duly reserved square brackets\u2014that the then obscure Kai K\u00e1\u00fas ought to have a place in the family tree of the house of Balban, a claim which had escaped the record of contemporary biographers, or the knowledge of later commentators on the local events in Bengal. I have since found abundant testimony towards establishing his true place both under the one and the other aspect.\n\nOn a recent occasion of reviewing my previous Essay on the Initial Coinage of Bengal, I embodied, with more confi-\n\n\u00b9 Minh\u00e1j-us-Sir\u00e1j, Persian text, p. 243.

Nassau Lees. Dr. Blochmann was so obliging as to forward me an impression of the original, that I might satisfy myself of the accuracy of the translation now given; but I have unfortunately mislaid the facsimile reproduction, and therefore abstain for the moment from any further comments.\n\n\u00b9 Dr. Blochmann continues:\u2014\"As mentioned above, this inscription is quoted by Mr. Thomas in his Chronicles of the Path\u00e1n Kings, p. 140, where a 'rough' translation by Colonel Nassau Lees is given. The 'translation' leaves out the name of the builder, and wrongly puts his titles in apposition to the words Khusrav\u0101z zam\u0101n. The absence of a facsimile has led Mr. Thomas to state that Kai K\u0101\u016bs confessed allegiance to 'Al\u0101-ud-din of Dihli, who is the Sikandar-usg\u0101ni par excellence;' but the grammatical construction of the sentence, and the idiom, show that the words 'Sikandar-usg\u0101ni, Ulugh-i-'Azam Humay\u016bn and Zafar Kh\u0101n,' are merely titles of Bahr\u0101m \u1e32tgin. He must have been a Malik of high rank, as the titles are high; but my Tribeni inscriptions (about to be published in this volume) give Maliks not only similar titles, but also the phrase 'May God perpetuate his rule and kingdom,' and even julus names, if I may say so. 'Shih\u0101b-ul-Haqq-wad-din,' therefore, is merely the julus name of Malik Zafar Kh\u0101n, and shows, moreover, that the Sikandar-usg\u0101ni cannot be 'Al\u0101-ud-din, whose full julus name with the kunyah was 'Al\u0101-ud-din Abulmusaffar Muhammad Sh\u0101h.' This inscription is further referred to by Mr. W. M. Bourke (1872, p. 143), who expresses a hope that his new \"rubbings,\" now submitted to the Society, may resolve Dr. Blochmann's doubt regarding a portion of this Inscription, and supply the date in his No. 4 Inscription.\"\nInscription C.\n\nInscription of Shams-ud-Din Firuz of Bengal, on Zafar Khan's Madrasah, at Tribeni, dated A.H. 713.\n\nThe text goes on to say that the inscription was engraved under the direction of Khan Muhammad Zafar Khan, on the 1st of Muharram, 713 A.H. Zafar Khan's Mosque, in the same locality, bears the earlier date of 698 A.H. (A.D. 1298).\n\n1 Tribeni or Triveni (as Mr. Money writes it, J.A.S.B., 1847, p. 393), N. of Hugli. Dr. Blochmann adds, \"Tribeni is often called Tripani ('three streams'), and by the Muhammadians Tripani Shahpur, or Firuzabad (see also Ain-i-Akbari (Gladwin), ii., p. 5; J.R.A.S. (n.s.) II. (1866), p. 202, Note 1, and Note 1, p. 205). Dr. Blochmann, in adverting to Marsden's coin of Taj-ud-din Firuz Shah (No. DCCCLXXXVIII., and Laidley, J.A.S.B., 1846, pl. v., fig. 17), has followed the old authorities in attributing the piece to a Bengal king of that name, and does not seem to be aware that the coin was minted in the Dakhan in 807 A.H., during the reign of the Bahmani Firuz Shah (A.H. 800 to 825). See my Chronicles of the Pathan Kings, p. 345. On the other part, I have to thank Dr. Blochmann for a rectification, to which he seems to attach an undue importance.\u2014J.A.S.B., July, 1872, p. 119. In my recent work just quoted, I had occasion to notice, en passant, the contemporary coins of the local dynasties more or less connected with the central Muhammedan Imperialism. Among other hitherto unpublished specimens, I described a coin of \"Ahmad Shah bin Ahmad Shah, Alwali, Al Bahmani,\" (p. 343), dated 856 A.H., and I submitted, without any reserve, in illustration of the piece itself, a facsimile of the original, designed and executed by an independent artist\u2014which may be seen to be defective in both the subordinate points, in which Dr. Blochmann has the advantage of me in a better preserved and more fully legible coin lately acquired by Colonel Hyde. I take no blame to myself for reading the absolutely detached \u0631\u0642\u0649 \u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0627\u0644 of the one specimen for the improved \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0645\u064a of the other, nor am I surprised at the appearance of the concluding word when it is to be found in the very next page of my work, where I had full authority for its citation.\n\nVol. VI.\u2014[New Series.]\nInscriptions D. E. F.\n\nFurther Inscriptions of Shams-ud-din Firuz.\n\nDr. Blochmann contributes the following remarks towards the elucidation of some unpublished records of this king:\n\n\"The inscriptions at Tribeni near Hugli mention the same king (Shams-ud-din Firuz) as having reigned in 1313 A.D. Two of Mr. Broadley's inscriptions\u2014and this will show the value of his discoveries\u2014prove\u2014\n\n1. That Firuz already reigned in 1309 over (Western) Bengal, or Lakhnauti.\n\n2. That South Bihar under him belonged to Bengal, whilst other inscriptions show that Bihar in 1352 again belonged to Delhi.\n\n3. That Shams-ud-din had a son of the name of Haim Kh\u00e1n, who in 1309 and 1315\u2014and hence most likely during the intervening years\u2014was governor of Bihar.\"\u00b9\n\nAs respects the later numismatic accessions to this henceforth second period of the Muslim annals of Bengal, they may be said to be confined to minor varieties and repetitions of known types, whose dates are, as yet, imperfectly ascertained. A single coin of mark claims attention, in the shape of a gold piece of Bahadur Shah, part of his tribute or recognition money (similar to the silver piece No. 9, O.S.) coined in his own name, but with the full acknowledgment of the supremacy of Muhammad bin Tughlak. The piece itself is the property of Mr. Delmerick\u2014to whom we owe the first notice of the unique coin of the Bactrian king Plato, which has lately been secured for the British Museum;\u00b2\u2014a medal, I may remark, en passant, that contributes the most striking testimony to the value of numismatic inquiries perhaps ever adduced, in confirming by the single date, hitherto known in the entire Bactrian series, which appears on its surface, the\n\n\u00b9 \"The two inscriptions of Haim Kh\u00e1n contain the dates 1309 and 1315; the former inscription seems to have belonged to a Sarai, the latter to a Mosque.\" J.A.S.B., Proceedings, 1871, p. 246.\n\u00b2 J.A.S.B., February, 1872, p. 34.\nexact epoch of Eukratides' death in B.C. 165, which had already been speculatively fixed from less definite data.\\(^1\\) The specific determination of this era is of the highest importance as giving us a standpoint, so to say critical, towards the close of a dynasty, whose members left so few positive traces behind them, and whose annals were little likely to have been preserved either by the hostile races who succeeded them, or their indifferent cousins who remained in the ancestral homes of the West.\n\nI have little left to say, in conclusion, beyond momentarily adverting to one of the confessed difficulties of the day, the identification of the easily-shifted sites of Eastern cities, whose removal, apart from the caprice of the rulers, was, in this locality, at all times liable to be suggested, if not enforced, by Nature herself, in the ever-changing channels of the waters of the Delta of the Ganges.\\(^2\\)\n\nWith regard to the emplacement of Pundua or \"Fir\u00fazpur,\" a possible claimant has appeared in the shape of the \"Pundooah\" (28\u00b0 3\u2032\u201388\u00b0 18\u2032) near H\u00faghl\u00ed, which is in a measure connected with the area of Shams-ud-d\u00edn Fir\u00faz of Bengal's extant memorials at Tribeni, one of the subordinate villages of which still retains the alternative name of \"Fir\u00fazb\u00e1d.\"\\(^3\\)\n\nBut I am satisfied that the Pandua, near Maldah,\\(^4\\) is the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Prinsep's Essays, ii., p. 175.

As a strong presumptive proof of the wanderings of that river, from one side of the Delta to the other, it may be observed, that there is no appearance of virgin earth between the Tipera hills on the east and the district of Burdw\u00e1n on the west; nor below Dacca and Bauleah on the north. In all the sections of the numerous creeks and rivers of the Delta, nothing appears but sand and black mould in regular strata, until the clay is reached, which forms the lower part of their beds; nor is there any substance so coarse as gravel either in the Delta, or nearer the sea than 400 miles (by the course of the Ganges) at Oudanulla, where a rocky point, part of the base of the neighbouring hills, projects into the river.\"\u2014Hamilton's Hindustan, i., p. 123.\n\n\\(^3\\) J.A.S.

Rennell remarks: \"Pundua, or Purruah, mentioned as a royal residence in Bengal, in the year 1353 (Dow, i. 340), [4to. edit. i., 326; Briggs, i., 449], is about seven miles to the north of Mauldah, and ten from the nearest part of Gour. Many of its ruins y. t remain,\nreal place of mintage of the coins bearing the royal designation of this prince, which later in point of time supersedes the discarded record of \"Lakhnauti\" on the local currency. While the group of \"Seven Villages\" or Townships in Lower Bengal is defined solely by the appropriate mint term of \"Satgaon,\" whose leading centre perhaps oscillated according to the progressive changes of the convenient wharves and landing-places of that emporium. If I could be equally certain of the very reasonable identification of \"Jugdula\" (25\u00b0 10\u2032\u201387\u00b0 58\u2032) of our recent surveys,\u00b9 with the \"Akddalah\" of the Muhammadan historians,\u00b2 the case would be complete and final in favour of the northern metropolis.\n\nColonel Haughton's recent investigations enable him to say that Gh\u00e1sp\u00far is also \"near Gaur, about one mile N.W. of Maldah.\"\u00b3 And Dr. Blochmann very safely affirms that Muazzam\u00e1b\u00e1d is in Sonargaon.\u2074 A small incidental note will be found at p. 9 ant\u00e8, on Deok\u00f3t and the Muslim Lakhnauti, but the subject under its geographical aspect, promises to repay more ample investigation.\n\nparticularly the Addeena mosque, and the pavement of a very long street, which lies in the line of the road leading from Mauldah to Dinagepour.\"\u2014Rennell, Map, etc., p. 66.\n\nStewart's understanding of the localities may be traced in the following passage: \"Ily\u00e1s took post himself in the fort of Akdala; leaving his son to defend the city of Pundua (near Mauldah), which for some time past he had made his capital.

Translated from the Chinese (and intended to illustrate Plates XXIX. and L., 'Tree and Serpent Worship'). By S. Beal.\n\nFrom a brief examination of a work in the India Office Library, called \"K'ai yuen shi kiou,\" (one volume of which is unfortunately missing), I find that the number of books included in the Chinese Buddhist Canon, down to the time of Tchi-Shing, the compiler of the work in question (who lived A.D. 730 during the Tang dynasty (618-904 A.D.), and shortly after Hwen-Thsang), amounted altogether to 1076, divided into 5048 chapters (kiouen), and included within 480 wrappers (chih). Of these, 330 belong to the \"Little vehicle,\" and 968 to the \"Great vehicle,\" leaving 108 miscellaneous and unclassified. Of the \"Little vehicle,\" 240 are S\u016btras, in 618 chapters, and 48 wrappers; 54 belong to the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka, in 446 chapters and 45 wrappers; 36 belong to the Abidharma Pi\u1e6daka, in 698 chapters and 72 wrappers. Of the 968 belonging to the \"Great vehicle,\" 515 are S\u016btras, in 2173 chapters and 203 wrappers; 26 belong to the Vinaya Pi\u1e6daka, in 54 chapters and 5 wrappers; and 97 belong to the Abidharma Pi\u1e6daka, in 518 chapters and 50 wrappers.\n\nAmongst other works named in this valuable Thesaurus is one bearing the title \"Fu-pen-hing-tsi-king,\" i.e. \"Miscellaneous Notices respecting the Birth and History of Buddha,\" translated by Djinak\u00fbta (or Dj\u00f1\u0101nak\u00fbta), a native of Gandh\u0101ra, in Northern India, who lived in the time of the Sui dynasty (581-617 A.D.). From this work I have selected the following legend of Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha, to illustrate two of the sculptures occurring at Sanchi and Amravati, and represented in Pl. XXIX. and Pl. L., \"Tree and Serpent Worship.\" I can have little doubt that these\nidentifications will be allowed to be plausible at least, and perhaps more than plausible.\n\nThe legend begins with the previous history of Dipa\u00f1kara, when he was an attendant on Ratnabhava Buddha:\n\nAt this time the world-honoured one addressed Ananda as follows:\u2014\u201cAnanda! I remember in ages gone by, too numerous for me to utter, that there was a sacred Chakravarti R\u0101ja, called Sudarsana, who, having subdued the four regions (i.e. the world), governed men according to law. During his reign there were no punishments of whipping or death\u2014no soldier\u2019s weapons to torture or destroy, but all was prosperity and peace, and the people lived virtually and religiously. Ananda! the city in which Sudarsana lived was called Jambunada, the walls from east to west were twelve yojanas in length, and from north to south seven yojanas. Ananda! that city of Jambunada was in a remarkable degree beautifully adorned and clean. The four precious substances were exclusively used in the garniture of it,\u2014to wit, yellow gold, white silver, crystal and cornelian. Around the city there were seven distinct walls, each wall seven \u2018sin\u2019 (i.e. 56 cubits) in height, and three \u2018sin\u2019 (24 cubits) in breadth. Around this city, moreover, were seven successive railings beautifully carved, etc. [Here follows the usual description of a perfectly adorned city.] At this time, Ananda! there was a Buddha born called Ratnabhava, etc. This Buddha had formerly as a Boddhisatwa lived in this city of Jambunada; and now he approached the city one day early in the morning to beg, at which time countless Devas descended to do him honour, and surrounded him as with a retinue, etc. At this time there was a certain village outside the city, one of whose inhabitants was going to be married to a person within the city, and on entering within the walls, he saw the place fully adorned and swept. Being filled with astonishment and reverence, he asked some one he met\u2014\u2018What is going on here?\u2019 The person replied\u2014\u2018There is a Buddha born called Ratnabhava, etc.; he is just going to enter the city to beg his food, and therefore these preparations have been made.\u2019 And then he went on to tell\nthe villager all about the excellences, etc., of Tath\u0101gata, and of the Law and the Church. The villager, having heard the glorious nature of the three gems thus described, was filled with joy. He exulted amazingly, and reflected thus, 'Ratnabhava, etc., is seldom seen in the world. I will now go straight to him.' So thinking, he forthwith mixed with a crowd of citizens, and went together with them to the place where Ratnabhava was. Having arrived there, he thought within himself, 'If this Tath\u0101gata has indeed acquired entire wisdom so as to know all hearts, he will know mine, and therefore he ought first of all to address himself to me in some consolatory figure or parable.' At this time Ratnabhava Buddha, knowing that man's heart, took the lead, and immediately addressed him and spoke. Then that villager was filled with joy; he exulted exceedingly. And because his vow was thus fulfilled, he respectfully requested Buddha to partake of his hospitality on the succeeding day. Then Buddha remained silent, on which the villager, accepting this silence for consent, was filled with joy, and went back to his house to make due preparations. Then the four Devarajas, Brahma, Sakra, and the rest, and all the multitude of Devas, bearing every kind of offering, came to present them to Tath\u0101gata. At that time the villager, coming to his house, on that very night arranged every kind of delicate food, of exquisite flavour and most pleasing taste. Having arranged it thus, he got up very early the next day, and began sweeping his house and sprinkling all sorts of perfumed water about it, and scattering all round flowers of the greatest beauty and choicest odor; then having arranged a seat, he sent messengers to tell Buddha, saying, 'All things are ready, oh, would that you would come to my humble dwelling!'\n\n\"Then Ratnabhava, early in the morning, putting on his robes, and taking his alms-bowl, surrounded by numberless followers, went to receive the proffered hospitality. Arrived there, his disciples took their seats in due order. The villager, having seen Ratnabhava seated, immediately with his own hand offered to Tath\u0101gata every kind of exquisite food and drink, speaking thus, 'Eat, my Lord, and all the\ncongregation, according to your desire.\u2019 When they had so eaten, still the provisions remained unexhausted, on which the villager thought thus, \u2018The meats and the drinks remain undiminished; doubtless this is in consequence of the miraculous power of Tath\u0101gata adding continually to them according to the decrease from consumption. Now, then, I will go call my relatives to come and behold Tath\u0101gata, so that when they have seen and have eaten, and are full, I may have further joy.\u2019 Again, he thought thus, \u2018Wonderful! wonderful, indeed, beyond all calculation, is the extent of the power of Buddha: for here come all my relatives, unbidden by any one, to assist and help me; there is no need for me, therefore, to invite a single person; and without using any effort, all things again arrange themselves as I would have them do.\u2019 Then Ratnabhava, after the feast, repeated such portions of the Law as were appropriate, for the sake of the villager, to his great joy; [the result of which was that he attained a new heart and entire peace.] Thus the villager and his friends, having heard the Law, arrived at Supreme Wisdom, and each went to his home. (This happy result having followed, the villager then said:) \u2018Oh, may I in future attain to the perfect knowledge of this Ratnabhava Tath\u0101gata.\u2019 And again he said, \u2018Oh, would that I, in the midst of the great congregation, might thus be able to deliver the Law, and cause the hearts of men to rejoice, just as this Ratnabhava Tath\u0101gata has preached among his congregation, and caused the Bhikshus to arrive at peace and unity of conduct!\u2019 Then that villager, having paid full and repeated reverence to Tath\u0101gata, entered the community, shaved his head, left his home, and became a Bhikshu.\n\n\u201cAnanda, after an innumerable number of asa\u1e45khyeyas of ages, this Bhikshu again encountered a Buddha, who was born in the world under the name of Prabh\u0101kara Tath\u0101gata. Then this Bhikshu, paying religious worship to this Buddha, and observing the precepts of personal purity, became one of his disciples, as before. In this condition he once more prayed, \u2018Oh, that I, in virtue of the merit I have acquired, may, during my future births from age to age, escape being\nborn in the inferior paths!\u2019 At this time Prabh\u0101kara Buddha, well acquainted with his prayer, delivered this prediction in reference to him, and said, \u2018Virtuous one, in ages to come, after endless asamkhyeas of kalpas, you shall attain the condition of Buddha Tath\u0101gata, etc., and your name shall be Dipa\u00f1kara.\u2019 [And so he was born, after the manner of every Buddha, from the right side of his mother.] Meantime Dipa\u00f1kara B\u00f3dhisatwa, with every faculty and function perfect, and of great grace of person, day by day grew up to manhood. Dwelling in the palace provided for him, he indulged himself in every pleasure [the five pleasures]. But, in the midst of all, a thought arose in him that all these joys were but for a moment. Having thought of this, he left his home, shaved his head, and became a recluse; he put on the kash\u0101ya garments of a hermit, and left all connexions with the world. Then he sought the attainment of Supreme Wisdom, and arrived at complete emancipation. Afterwards, using his Divine faculty of sight, he reflected thus: \u2018Who will be the first to hear and receive the true Law?\u2019 Immediately he saw that the world was without any one fit for so high a privilege. Again he reflected (looked) three times, but still found no one. Thus he lived in the world three thousand years, but still remained alone without any disciple. After three thousand years, Dipa\u00f1kara thought thus: \u2018All men are sunk in sin, and fascinated this long time by the deceptions of sense. I must now convert them, and give them understanding.\u2019 Reflecting thus, he caused the appearance of a city to proceed from his lamp and fix itself in space. He made all the buildings to appear as if constructed of crystal, and outside the city every kind of T\u0101la-tree made of the seven precious substances, and avenues and gardens (as before described). Suddenly the people of Djambu (i.e. of the world) saw this city from its four walls emit very fierce flames, bright and burning hot. Then great fear filled their breasts, and they congregated together and spoke thus\u2014\u2018Alas! alas! see how yonder abode is burning in flames, surely it will be soon entirely destroyed!\u2019 Then they looked for some Buddha to appear to convert and save\nthose wretched people. But they only saw the flames still burning, and the people in vain seeking for refuge and shelter. Desiring protection, there was none to protect; they looked for salvation, but there was no one able to save! Then they said again\u2014'Oh, would that that city could be brought near to us, or we to them, that we might extinguish the conflagration!' Just then they saw Devas, N\u0101gas, Yakshas, Gandharvas, those who were men and not men (Kinnaras), come forth from that city, and cry out, 'Why do the flames burn so? Whence comes this fire?' Then there appeared three porchways, one of gold, another of silver, the third of crystal; in the middle of the way were T\u0101la-trees made of the seven precious substances; from the midst of these trees there came a voice, which said, 'Oh, all ye men! Assemble ye in one place, if ye indeed desire to see Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha Tath\u0101gata, etc., for that Buddha not long hence will descend to Jambudv\u012bpa.' Then all the people of Jambudv\u012bpa went straightway towards those covered ways to see Dipa\u00f1kara coming forth from the city and descend to Jambudv\u012bpa. At this time Dipa\u00f1kara, having appeared, took his seat on the Lion throne, and for the sake of those people began to deliver the Law, i.e. in praise of charity, purity, abstinence, and in recommendation of the merit of the religious profession; and then seeing that there were signs of conversion, he delivered the whole Law, as former Buddhas had done, viz. that relating to the four Truths\u2014sorrow, accumulation, deliverance, and the paths. Then on the first day of this preaching there were 6000 myriads of men converted, who became Rahats, and their hearts freed from all external laws. The second day he converted 5000 myriads of men; the third day 4000 myriads, till the seventh day. After this Dipa\u00f1kara remained in the world one kalpa.\"\n\nAgain, Buddha spoke thus to Ananda:\u2014\"I remember, in countless ages gone by, there was a king called 'Niang-nu,' (Satrunjaya), of the Kshatriya caste, and duly anointed, accord-\n\n1 Vide Jul. ii. 390, n. Compare this account with pl. xxix. fig. 1, Tree and Serpent Worship. The horned figures on the right of the plate evidently represent Kinnaras. (Vide Jul. ut supr.)\ning to the rule of his ancestors (shan). He lived in a great city called Padma (or Paduma), twelve yojanas long, seven yojanas broad; the ground even and smooth [here follows the usual description of a city], equal in every respect to the city Arka of Vaisravana, the Northern Ruler,\u2014on every side equally glorious, so perfectly adorned and beautiful was it.\n\nAnanda! that Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja had a certain rich and eminent Brahman, whose name was S\u016bryapati, brave and strong, possessed of every species of wealth\u2014gold, gems, elephants, horses, slaves, cattle of every kind, without stint. Within his treasure-house was found every kind of precious substance\u2014yellow gold, white silver, true pearls, lapis lazuli, crystal, cornelian, coral, all entirely complete as the (treasury of) Vaisravana, the Northern King.\n\n\"Ananda! at this time S\u016bryapati, the great Brahman, on account of the exceeding affection he bore to the King, constantly had conversation with him; and every day, for a short time at least during the day, went to visit him, with scarce any deviation. Ananda! that Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja at this time had a certain business in hand, which he entrusted to the Brahman S\u016bryapati to settle, desiring him to decide and judge concerning it well and truly. S\u016bryapati having equitably disposed of the case, it afterwards entered into the King's head that he would do something to double the prosperity and happiness of this Brahman, and so he divided his kingdom with him, and built him a city called Yen-ch\u00fc [lord of the boundary], with streets and gates perfectly adorned, and lovely even as the city Padma itself. Ananda! that S\u016bryapati R\u0101ja [called R\u0101ja, because he now possessed half the kingdom] had a queen called Chandrottara. Ananda, when Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha descended from the Tusita heaven, he was incarnated in the womb of Chandrottara, entering through her right side, in the palace of S\u016bryapati. Ananda, after a time Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja got to hear the news that the chief lady of S\u016bryapati had brought forth in the royal palace a boy called Dipa\u00f1kara, very beautiful to behold, and able to give great joy; unequalled in the world, endowed with all the characteristic marks, pure as a golden\nfigure. The young child having been born, his horoscope was taken, and the Brahmins declared that he would be either a Chakravarti or a Buddha; if the former, he would possess the seven insignia, viz. a golden discus, a Divine pearl, a priceless woman, an elephant, horse, lordly minister and treasurer, and every prosperity would attend his reign; but if he be a recluse, then he would arrive at complete enlightenment, and be known by the ten names belonging to a Buddha. Ananda! this child became a recluse, and fulfilled the functions and mission of a Buddha. At this time, Satru\u00f1jaya reflected thus:\u2014'Seldom indeed does a \"Lord of the World\" come to be born; it is difficult to hear such a one, and difficult to see him.' So Satru\u00f1jaya sent messengers to the abode of S\u00fbryapati to speak to him thus: 'We hear now that the queen of your majesty has borne a beautiful boy, endowed with all the peculiar marks. We desire to invite that Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha, etc., to come and live at our city of Padma, and to receive our offerings, and we will send an escort to meet him.' Then those ambassadors, thus instructed, went to the city Yen-ch\u00fc, and delivered their message. Then S\u00fbryapati R\u00e2ja, having received the message, was sorrowful, and quickly assembled his council and ministers, and spoke thus:\u2014'Consider well, I pray you, what answer is to be given to this message.' Then all the ministers addressed the King, and said: 'Concerning this matter, we think Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha himself should be consulted; for he has great charity and compassion.' The R\u00e2ja S\u00fbryapati replied: 'Such also is my opinion.' Then the R\u00e2ja and all his ministers went in a body to the place where Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha was, and having arrived there, (they delivered the message). Then that Buddha assayed to tranquillize the King, and said: 'Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja! compose your heart, and be not distressed; have no fear or grief on this score; for in truth I myself at this time wish to go forth and travel abroad through the various places of the earth, to teach and convert men; for my love extends even to the whole human race.' Then Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha set out, surrounded by an innumerable body of disciples, and departed.\nMeanwhile S\u016bryapati escorted him to the borders of his territory, and then, having worshipped at his feet and performed three circuits round him, with many tears, he left him, and returned to his own palace.\n\n\"Now Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja, hearing that Dipa\u1e45kara was coming to his dominions, even to the city of Padma, surrounded by clouds of followers, was filled with joy, and ordered forthwith all the roads to be swept, watered, and garnished, even like the fairy city of the Gandharvas. Then the King Satru\u00f1jaya published an edict to all within and without the city for a distance of twelve yojanas, to the effect that whatever persons there were within such distance, none whatever should purchase for themselves flowers or perfume; but in whatever places such were to be bought, that they should be reserved for the King as offerings to Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha. Then Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja, accompanied by the four kinds of military escort, in great display, went forth out of the city to meet that Dipa\u1e45kara Buddha.\n\n\"At this time, on the southern face of the Him\u0101layas belonging to that country, there was a certain Brahmach\u0101ri called Ratna(?). His father and mother belonging to the caste of Brahmins, for seven generations past, without the least defilement or reproach, perfectly versed in the four Vedas, etc. His pure birth was affirmed by the horoscope of a talented soothsayer, and 500 children of illustrious families were present on the auspicious occasion to present him with offerings. [Ananda! you must know that this Ratna, the Brahman, was none other than Maitreya B\u014ddhisatwa that now is.]\n\n\"Now amongst the 500 young men who ever attended the person of Ratna, to hear from his mouth the mode of reciting the Sacred Books, there was a particular Brahmach\u0101ri called Megha, conspicuous among the rest, almost equal to his master in learning, sixteen years old, and of very graceful appearance, of pure birth during seven generations, his family without reproach, his horoscope also a perfect one. He was incomparable in the world, his body like yellow gold, and his head-dress (or hair) the same; his voice soft and sweet, as\nthe voice of Brahm\u0101. This youth, having learned from the mouth of Ratna the mode of reciting the Sacred Books perfectly, desired at length permission to return home. Ratna, being loth to let Megha go, addressed him thus: \u2018My son (manara), I have yet one Shaster handed down from Rishis of old times, unknown by sound or by sight to heretics and Brahmins; wait with me, and I will teach it to you.\u2019 The youth replied, \u2018Oh, would that you would instruct me in it!\u2019 Then the Brahman taught him this also. Afterwards the youth requested once more to know what else he had to acquire. The Brahman replied, \u2018There are certain household rules peculiar to the Brahman caste, these also you must learn from my mouth for your own guidance and profit.\u2019 The youth replied, \u2018Would that you would teach me these rules!\u2019 [The Brahman gave his consent on condition the youth would in return make certain offerings to him.] Then the youth replied, \u2018I have no such gifts as these to offer to my lord; but I will, by your permission, go beg them all over the world, and then come back and give them to you.\u2019 On this the Brahman gave him permission to go even as he desired. Then Megha, having prostrated himself before his master, and having walked round him three times in token of respect, departed.\n\n\u201cAt this time Megha heard that there was a place 500 y\u014djanas off from the Snowy Mountains called Survacha (?). In that city there was a distinguished Brahman called Tsai-tse-tai, exceedingly rich. This Brahman desired to make offerings to the 60,000 Brahmans who, according to appointment, were met together in assembly called M\u014dcha. Accordingly he had prepared for each individual a parasol, etc., and for the head Brahman (Sthavira) very excellent gifts of gold, together with 1000 cows with their calves, 500 damsels, their bodies beautifully ornamented, among whom Shen-chi was chief. And now the year of the Pa\u00f1cha assembly having expired all but one day, the Brahman youth Megha arrived from the Snowy Mountains, and came to the city, even to the place where the assembly was being held. Then those 60,000 Brahmans, seeing the youth afar off, immediately raised a\ngreat cry, and said, 'Bravo! How well selected is this place for the Pa\u00f1cha assembly, for here comes Brahm\u0101 Deva himself to receive the offerings of this congregation!' Then Megha, the young man, replied to these 60,000 Brahmins, and said, 'Call not out in this way, as if I were Brahm\u0101 Deva, for I am in truth a man, and not Brahm\u0101.' Then the Brahmins said, 'Then who are you?' To which he replied, 'Is it possible that you have not heard of the Brahmach\u0101ri who resides on the southern side of the Snowy Mountains, whose name is Ratna, so thoroughly versed in every kind of religious works, with his 500 disciples, of whom Megha is the chief, a youth of sixteen years of age, completely instructed, and equal to his master, with a voice as sweet as that of Brahm\u0101 Deva? Have you Brahmins heard of this before or not?' Then they all answered, 'We have.' Then said Megha, 'Well, then, I am that well-instructed youth.' On this those Brahmins were filled with joy, and cried with a loud voice, 'Bravo! Bravo! This assembly is well constituted now that Megha has come to receive its offerings!'\n\n\"At this time the wife of the Brahman Tsai-tse-tih, with Shen-chi and the other damsels, from the top of the balcony saw afar off this youth, so beautiful in appearance, and beyond compare for grace. Then having seen him they conceived great joy in their hearts, and turning to the four quarters of the heavens they did reverence to all the Devas and Spirits, and their hearts secretly entertained this thought, 'Oh, would that this fair youth might overcome in his discourse the Sthavira and all the Brahmins, so that we might get rid of these ungracious companions, and not be given to such contemptible people in marriage!' Then Megha, advancing into the assembly, respectfully turned round three times, after which he advanced straight up to the Sthavira, and, with soft and courteous voice, addressed him thus, 'Venerable sir, what Shaster can you recite?' Then all the 60,000 Brahmins cried out together, 'Megha, respectable youth! ask not such a question of our President, as to what Shaster he can recite; for in truth he is able, according to the rules of our caste, to recite thoroughly from beginning to end all\nthe Shasters [or it may be \u2018recite and maintain\u2019]. Then the youth Megha replied, \u2018Ye Brahmins, your President may indeed be able to recite from memory all the medical and polite treatises [or works on mechanical arts], but it is only my master who possesses the scarce and rarely found literature of the Brahmins. For instance, let me ask you, have you a Shaster called \u201cSien-yeou\u201d or no?\u2019 Then the 60,000 Brahmins all replied, \u2018As yet we never heard of such a treatise even by name, much less have we got it, and still less are we able to recite it.\u2019 Then Megha replied, \u2018My master, teaching me the different works of the Law, amongst others instructed me in this Shaster of the Veda called Sien-yeou; and, moreover, I can recite it.\u2019 Then all those Brahmins composing the assembly said, \u2018Be pleased to explain and give us the pleasure of hearing this new Shaster.\u2019 Then the youth Megha, occupying a place appointed by the President, with the voice of Brahm\u0101, recited that Shaster of the Veda known as Sien-yeou. Then all those Brahmins, filled with joy, cried out with one voice, \u2018Precisely according to our own heart and mind!\u2019 Then they joyously requested him to become their President, and partake of the best drink and food provided for such a dignified office. Then Megha, pushing the President, commanded him to come down from his seat, and take his place below; and then himself ascending the seat of honour, received the water and food, after which also he accepted such of the offerings as were fit.\n\n\u201cThen the great Brahman Ts\u2019ai-tse-tih was distressed with the thought that he had not arranged the laws of the assembly according to the rules of the highest doctrine, forasmuch as the youth Megha declined to accept some of the offerings, whereupon he spake thus, after a profound reverence, to Megha, \u2018My Lord will surely receive these my gifts, and not cause me to be deficient in my duty to the assembly!\u2019 On which Megha replied, \u2018Illustrious Brahman, your gifts are superabundant; it is not that there is anything wanting,\n\n1 Sien-yeou is equivalent to \u201cFormer Existence,\u201d the work therefore would be one of the P\u016br\u0101nas.\nbut only that some things are good for me to accept, and others not; and therefore I decline the latter.'\n\n\"Then the vanquished President thought thus within himself, 'For a long time have I coveted these gifts, and now this stripling has come and pushed me down from my place of honour, and taken my reward. If in future births, in return for my present merit, I am born in the world with this youth, then may I have an opportunity of returning him a due recompense!' [Ananda! at that time I was Megha, and the Brahman was D\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dap\u0101\u1e47i, and the Sthavira was Devadatta, and so in every birth Devadatta through his ignorance has opposed and hated me.]\n\n\"Then Megha, taking with him the various gifts he had received, desired to return towards the Snowy Mountains, in order to offer them to the Brahmach\u0101ri there. And so he passed through various villages, towns, cities, and countries, staying and going as he list, observing men and things, till at last he arrived at the city of Paduma and entered it, when lo! he beheld it adorned and beautified to a degree that cannot be described (as we have mentioned above). Then the youth thought thus within himself, 'Why is this city of Paduma thus adorned? Is it possible that some one desires to hold a M\u014dcha meeting here? Or perhaps there is about to be a public sacrifice made in honour of the stars and heavenly mansions; or perhaps there is a public thanksgiving for prosperity, or some distribution of reward; or perhaps this is the time for the assembly of Brahmans; or perhaps the people of this city have heard of my fame, and reported that I am coming, and so desire all the Brahmans to hold a disputation with me; and yet there is no one here who seems to recognize me, or to do me reverence.' Then I asked a man I met, and said, 'My good fellow, why is this city so beautifully adorned and decorated?' To which he replied, 'Most learned youth, is it possible that you have not heard that Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha Tath\u0101gata, etc., has lately expressed a desire to come to this city of Paduma, to declare the Law and\n\n1 The Legend is now narrated in the first person, as Megha is one with S\u0101ky\u0101 Buddha in a former birth.\nconvert the people, and that on his account all these preparations are being made, and that our King Satru\u00f1jaya has ordered all the people to assist in advancing these decorations, and so the inhabitants, wishing to promote their own merit and to honour Dipa\u00f1kara, have adorned the city as you see?\"\n\n\"At this time, Ananda! I remembered that in our Law it is thus written, 'Whatever man possesses the thirty-two signs of supereminent beauty, he will either be a Chakravarti or else a Buddha, of this there can be no doubt.'\n\n\"Then, Ananda! I thought thus, 'I will go straight to the resting place (and examine and see, and if satisfied I will) worship and offer an offering to this Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha, and ask for myself that in future time I may arrive at the same state of perfection, then afterwards I will go and present my offering to my master the Brahmach\u0101ri.'\n\n\"Then again I reflected thus, 'What sacrifice can I offer to this Buddha, and by what means can I increase in myself the seeds of virtue?' Then I considered that all the Buddhas, honoured of men, desire not offerings of money, but only such holy donations as are prescribed in the Law, and that I as yet had no acquaintance with the true meaning of the Law. Nevertheless, I thought I will go and seek to purchase the most beautiful flower I can find, and then offer it to him with the prayer 'that in future time I also may become a Buddha.' Forthwith I went to a hair-dresser's house, and spoke thus to him, 'Sir, can you sell me that flower?' Whereupon he replied to me thus, 'Respectable youth, is it possible that you have not heard of the orders given by our King Satru\u00f1jaya that \"whatever chaplets of flowers there are in the city that not one of these shall on any account be sold, because the King himself desires to obtain all such flowers to present them to Buddha\"? On hearing this, I went again and again to the different hair-dressing shops, to try and purchase a wreath of flowers; but in vain, for I got from them no other answer than that I had before received, and could obtain none. Then, as I passed from street to street, making every private inquiry to accomplish my end,\nI chanced to see a dark-clad water girl, whose name was Bhadr\u0101, secretly take a seven-stalked Utpala flower and put it inside her water pitcher, and then go onwards upon her way. Seeing this I was greatly rejoiced, and forthwith went up to her, and said, 'What are you going to do with that Utpala flower which I saw you put in your pitcher? I will give you 500 gold pieces for it if you will sell it to me.' Whereupon the girl replied, 'Virtuous youth, have you not heard that Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha, honoured of men, Tath\u0101gata, etc., is now about to enter the city in consequence of the King's invitation? For so it is, that Satru\u00f1jaya, our King, has conceived a peculiar reverence for him; and being desirous to establish firmly in himself some ground of merit, has issued orders to all within the city and twelve yojanas round it, that whatever scented unguents or flowers there be, on no account should these be sold to any private individual, as the King himself would buy up all for the purpose of presenting them (to Buddha). Now in our neighbourhood there is a certain hair-dresser called Satrusaha; he has a wife who privately took from me 500 pieces of money, and gave me in return this seven-stalked flower; and the reason why I thus transgressed the edict of the King was because I wanted very much to make an offering to Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha Tath\u0101gata, etc., and was unable except in this way to obtain the means of accomplishing my wish.'\n\n\"Then I addressed the girl again, and said, 'My good girl, the explanation you have just given, and made known to me, will justify you in taking my 500 gold pieces, and giving me five stalks of the Utpala flower, and keeping two yourself.' Then the young girl replied, 'Respectable youth, what will you do with the flowers if I give them to you?' Then I replied, 'It is a difficult thing to see a living Buddha (Tath\u0101gata), and difficult to meet with him when born. Having now the good fortune to encounter Dipa\u00f1kara, I wish to buy this flower to honour him therewith, and to sow for myself some seeds of merit, that hereafter I may arrive at the condition of perfection also.'\n\n\"Then the young girl spake to me thus again, 'I perceive\nfrom your external appearance, and also from the qualifications of your mind, so resolute in your love of the Law, that you will certainly hereafter obtain complete enlightenment. M\u0101nava! if you will promise me that up to the time of your perfection in every successive birth you will take me as your wife, and that if you arrive at perfection you will permit me to follow you as a disciple, and devote myself to obtain the condition of a Rahat in your retinue of followers,\u2014if you will promise me this,\u2014then I will give you five stalks of this Utpala flower; but if you will not make such a promise, I will not give them to you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then I replied, \u2018My good girl, I am of the Brahman caste, perfectly pure, and thoroughly conversant with the four Vedas (or discourses of the Vedas, or perhaps Vedangas). In these Vedas it is thus said, \u201cIf a man wishes to obtain perfection or the condition of a B\u014ddhisatwa, then that man should nourish in himself a principle of love and pity for all creatures, and seek his object in perfect tranquillity whatever may betide him, so that he should not even grudge to sacrifice his body, but be ready to give it up for the sake of men, and much more (to give up) his wife and his children, his maidens and his riches, not to desire to retain them for a moment.\u201d My good girl, I now desire and pray that I may obtain supreme wisdom, prompted by my desire to give peace and joy to all creatures; and therefore in pity for them, if a man should come and ask of me my wife and children as a sacrifice, and you through any love to me should throw an obstacle in the way, then you would break my heart, and my vow would be unfulfilled; whilst you, on your part, would be exceedingly guilty. But if you also will promise and vow that through all time you will make no difficulty in letting me give up everything I possess in charity, then I will enter into a contract with you that you shall ever be my wife.\u2019\n\n\u2018Then she replied to me thus, \u2018M\u0101nava! suppose there came a person to your side, and begged my body of you, I would not grudge to give myself up, much less would I grudge children or riches.\u2019 Then I said, \u2018Let it be even so then; according to your vow I promise through future time\nto have you as my wife.' Then that maiden received from me the 500 gold pieces, and gave to me the five stalks of the Utpala flower. 'The other two stalks,' she said, 'offer for my sake, that we may together have the same destiny.' Adding this, 'You wish now to establish a ground of merit for yourself: take these two flowers also, and offer them for my sake, and pray that we may be ever born together and not separated through lapse of days.'\n\n\"Then Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha began to enter the city Paduma from without, whereupon I, taking in my hands these seven stalks of the Utpala (five in one and two in the other), beheld from far Buddha approaching,\\(^1\\) his body beautiful and upright, shining with splendor and grace, his mind calm and at rest, his senses collected and peaceful as a glassy lake; thus with steps like the king of the elephants, he advanced, surrounded by countless disciples and Devas, who scattered around him endless flowers of every variety and scented perfumes. Then Satru\u00f1jaya R\u0101ja, accompanied by the four sorts of military escort, proceeded from the gates of the city to meet Dipa\u00f1kara Buddha. At this time the concourse of people was simply innumerable, with all sorts of diverse beings, Kinnaras, Kumbhandas, and Dragons, who brought flowers and every sort of scented wood, and scattered them above the person of this Tath\u0101gata. These flowers, instead of falling to the earth, formed a canopy over the head of Dipa\u00f1kara, moving with him as he went, and standing still as he rested. Then, on witnessing this, I conceived much reverence in my heart for the person of Buddha, and taking the seven stalks of the Utpala flower, I cast them above Dipa\u00f1kara, making this vow, 'If in future time I shall become Buddha, and teach the Law just as this Buddha, and receive the reverence of all men in like manner, then let these flowers remain in mid-air, the leaves hanging downwards and the flowers standing upwards, crowning the canopy that shades the head of Buddha, and moves as he moves, and\n\n\\(^1\\) There can be no doubt, I should suppose, that this legend is intended to be perpetuated on the right hand pillar of plate L., \"Tree and Serpent Worship.\" The Legend is alluded to by Fahien (Buddhist Pilgrims, p. 43).\nrests as he rests.' And so it was, when I beheld this portent fulfilled, that I conceived much faith in my heart as well as reverence.\n\n\"Ananda! at this time the countless multitudes of people were spreading their priceless garments in the way, made of K\u0101sik\u0101 (wool of K\u0101si), fine white wool, etc.; they covered the earth with them completely. Then I, Ananda! seeing this, and having on me only a deer-skin doublet, I took this off to spread on the ground. Then all the people in anger took my poor garment from the place where it lay and dragged it away and flung it on one side; whilst I in grief thought, 'Alas for me! Will not the world-honoured Dipa\u00f1kara pity my case and think of me in my distress?' No sooner had I thought thus, than Buddha, knowing my heart, took pity on me. Accordingly, by his Divine power, he caused to appear on the ground as it were a portion of the road covered with mud,\\(^1\\) on which those men in astonishment looked at one another, but not one of them entered the muddy place to help Dipa\u00f1kara across. Then I, after some thought, spread out my skin garment on the muddy spot, and undoing my hair, covered the garment with my hair, so that Buddha might cross over in perfect comfort, as on a bridge. So, none of the people having put their foot on this covering, Buddha first crossed over, and then I made a vow, 'Oh, that all the disciples might likewise pass across!' And then I prayed again that I might in future ages become a Buddha, even as Dipa\u00f1kara, possessed of the same miraculous power, and worshipped alike by gods and men; and then I vowed again if Dipa\u00f1kara does not now give me a prediction of becoming Buddha, I will not rise from out this mud, but I will remain even as I am. Then the earth quaked six times (in prospect of the coming prediction, and in consequence of the earnestness of my vow).\"\n\n[Dipa\u00f1kara then passes over, but permits none of the\n\n\\(^1\\) This fable is alluded to in Julien, ii. 97. I think the left hand pillar, plate L., \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" represents Gop\u0101la (or rather Gopi) with her daisies of cream; whilst the central figure represents the dragon Gop\u0101la. Vide Jul. ii. 98.\nBhikshus to follow on the same path. He then predicts that Megha will become a Buddha (S\u0101kya Muni), on condition that he leaves all his wealth, shaves his head, and follows him as a disciple. Then Megha ascended into the air the distance of seven T\u0101la-trees, and did reverence to Dipa\u00f1kara.]\n\n[These Legends, when all are translated, will explain many obscure references in Buddhist literature, and also throw some light on the rise of Romance literature in Europe.

IX., ante pp. 213-274, on Hiouen-Thsang's Journey from Patna to Ballabhi. By James Fergusson, D.C.L., F.R.S.\n\nSince the above paper was printed off, it has occurred to me that the Konkanapoura mentioned at page 266 has nothing whatever to do with the Concans now below the Gh\u00e2ts, as I was inclined to think was possible, but may have been the capital of the Kongadesa or Chera kingdom, which we know, at the period of Hiouen-Thsang's visit, was one of the three great kingdoms occupying the south of the peninsula.\u00b9\n\nThe most northern capital of this kingdom we are acquainted with was T\u00e2lak\u00e2d, east of Seringapatam; but their dominions extended northward beyond this, as the seventh king of this race, certainly before Hiouen-Thsang's time, ruled over the greater portion of Karn\u00e2ta; and it is said, \"Muganda Pattana, at which the twenty-first and twenty-second kings are said to have resided, was, according to the introductory note, 48 miles north-east from Seringapatam,\"\u00b2\u2014no great distance from the locality where I have placed Konkanapoura; but their residence at Hiouen-Thsang's time may have been anywhere well within their dominions. There is therefore every probability that the capital of the Konga kingdom in the seventh century may have been at least as far north as I have placed it, but by no power of stretching can it be shown that the permanent dominions of the Cheras extended northward beyond the limit of the present Mysore kingdom. Though, therefore, this identification may not help us much in fixing the site of Konkanapoura, it seems fatal to the idea of Conjeveram being the Kantchipura of the Pilgrim. Any place 2000 li north-west from that city would fall beyond the Tungabhadra river, and therefore quite outside the Kongadesa; but starting from N\u00e2gapatam, the route is perfectly intelligible, and may be considered certain within very narrow limits.\n\n\u00b9 Wilson's Mackenzie MSS. i., p. 199, et seqq.

VI.\nContributions towards a Glossary of the Assyrian Language.\n\nBy H. F. Talbot.\n\nPART III.\n\n292. Urmakh. \ud808\udd97\ud808\udc97, a Lion.\u2014The meaning of this word is ascertained by four bas-reliefs (see R, plate 7), one of which represents the King pouring a libation on four dead lions before an altar, which he calls Urmakhi sha adduku, the lions which I had slain. \ud808\udd97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udd97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udd97 adduku, is the pluperfect tense; the perfect would be adduk, I slew.\n\nThe second bas-relief represents a lion seized by the ear and killed with a spear; and the inscription says, Urmakh . . . . . . as uzni-su azbat, I seized by his ear, as ashmar esha gati-ya, and with the spear which was in my hands (I destroyed his life).\n\nThe third represents a lion seized by the tail and killed with a mace. The inscription says, Urmakh, a Lion . . . . . , as kun azbat, I seized by the tail, as khutbul esha gati-ya, and with a mace which was in my hands, eli-su umatti, I put him to death. The verb \ud808\udd97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 umatti, is no doubt derived from mut, death (see No. 239).\n\nThe fourth represents warriors spearing lions\u2014unfortunately a great part of this inscription is defaced and illegible. I read however \ud808\udd97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udd97 \ud808\udd97 illat urmakhi suatunu uparriru(?), \u201cthe rest of those lions they slew.\u201d The meaning of Urmakh is therefore well established.\n\nI think, however, that the true name of the Lion was Ur, as in Hebrew, where it is named Ari \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9; and so in Syriac Aria;\nand that \\( \\text{lu-amdakhi} \\) meant properly a full grown lion. The syllable \\( \\text{lu-amdakhi} \\) is usually added to various words, as \\( \\text{lu-amdakhi} \\), \"a finely grown tree,\" from \\( \\text{lu-amdakhi} \\), \"a tree.\" Bellito 58, and \\( \\text{ga makhi} \\), a great ox, from \\( \\text{ga} \\).\n\nDoes the adverb \\( \\text{urish lu-amdakhi} \\) mean \"like a lion\"? \\( \\text{urish lu-amdakhi} \\), I fought like a lion. Fig. vi. 2. written \\( \\text{urish lu-amdakhi} \\).\n\n293. Kurra, \\( \\text{kurra} \\).\u2014This word occurs continually, but it is uncertain how it ought to be pronounced; because the spelling never varies, and the first syllable \\( \\text{ku} \\) has a great many different values. I consider the value \\( \\text{ku} \\) the most probable in this word, for two reasons: first, because \\( \\text{kurra} \\) is very like the Sanskrit \\( \\text{ghora} \\), a horse; and secondly, because the horse bears the same name \\( \\text{kurra} \\) in the Melo-Scythic language\u2014according to Oppert\u2014and in that language the syllable \\( \\text{ku} \\) has only the value \\( \\text{ku} \\).\n\nIts form is \\( \\text{kurra} \\), being slightly different from the Assyrian letter.\n\n294. Gammal, \\( \\text{gammal} \\).\u2014Norris, p. 180, also gives the form \\( \\text{gammalu} \\). The origin of this most ancient and widely diffused word has not been ascertained. Some derive it from the Semitic \\( \\text{hamal} \\), to carry: which is not bad, since the camel is one of the most useful beasts of burden. But since the Sanskrit word is \\( \\text{kramla} \\), Furst suggests that this form may come from the Sanskrit \\( \\text{krama} \\), strength, and may mean \"an enduring powerful animal.\"\u2014Dict. p. 293.\n\nPerhaps \\( \\text{gammal} \\) may have originally meant the \"great\" animal; for I find that \\( \\text{gamal} \\) meant great in the old Assyrian language; at least I think that this may be inferred from two glosses which succeed each other in 2 R 39, lines 41 and 42, \\( \\text{gishlu gamala} \\), great danger\u2014\\( \\text{gishlu turru} \\), little danger. And again from 2 B 30, 23, \\( \\text{Subat elitu} \\), \"a lofty house,\" translated \\( \\text{ku sha eli gamma} \\). I also think that in 2 R 32, 69 and 71, there is an opposition between \\( \\text{gamma} \\) (great) and \\( \\text{tarda} \\) (small). The latter is explained by \\( \\text{ildu} \\) (young).\n295. **Aabba.** \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0, a kind of Camel: probably pronounced *yobba.*\u2014The meaning is ascertained by two epigraphs of the Obelisk.  \n\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \u0161a sunai tsiri-sin, Camels with two humps.\n\n296. **Utrati.** \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0, Bactrian Camels.\u2014I think this word may be cognate with Pers. *Ustur* a Camel. The meaning is ascertained by the following passages cited by Norris, p. 185:\u2014  \nVII utrati \u0161a \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0 gungulip\u012b-sin, seven Camels having two humps. The other passage is similar.\n\nThere is a difficult passage in the third Epigraph of the Obelisk, in which the word \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \u0161a \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0 pirati occurs. Perhaps we should read \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0 instead of \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0, in which case the word would be *utrati,* and the passage would stand thus: \u201cTribute of the land of Mutsirri, *aabba* \u0161a sunai tsiri-sin; alap nari Sakie izutzu utrati, Camels with two humps; the tribe of the river Saki call them *utrati.*\u201d\n\nIn support of this translation I may observe, that the two passages which I have quoted from Norris, p. 185, are a proof that *utrati* were really two-humped camels. I think the Epigraph says that they were so called by the tribe of the Sac\u0153. There is nothing improbable in this, and if my translation is correct, it helps us to find the position of the land of Mutsirri\u2014which will be the territory of the Sac\u0153, or at any rate somewhere near it.\n\nI am aware that previous translators of this passage have rendered \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 alap \u201ca Bull,\u201d but this gives no satisfactory meaning, and I prefer to view it as being the Hebrew \u02bealap \u201ca tribe\u201d [see Furst\u2019s Lex. p. 97]. *Itzuzu* or *izuzu* \u2018they call it,\u2019 is a frequent verb\u2014it is the Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05d6\u05d5\u05bc, the reduplicate or more forcible form of \u05d9\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05d6\u05d5\u05bc \u2018to utter.\u2019\n\n297. **Anakati.** \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udf0b\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0\ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0, She Camels. B.M. 68, 2.  \n\u2014This word has the sign \ud808\ude4c \u201cfemale\u201d prefixed, as well as \ud808\ude4c\ud808\udda0 \u201canimal.\u201d The word was first recognized by Dr. Hincks and was one of the first proofs given that the Assyrian was a Semitic Language. *Camelus femina,* Buxtorf, p. 147, and he says more about the word in p. 1387. In modern Arabic a she-camel is *Nakat* without the vowel.\n298. **Alap.** \u1e24a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, a Bull.\u2014Agrees with the Hebrew \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r.\n\nIn Syll. 174 Alap is rendered by \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r which usually means the sacred image of a Bull. The plural is \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, see 2 R38, 29, where it is rendered by \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r \u201coxen.\u201d Mr. Norris (Dict. p. 647) gives a good example of this word from 2 R16, 28, pan alpi, \u2018the front of the oxen,\u2019 rendered in P.C. by \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r.\n\n299. **Ga.** \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, an Ox.\u2014This is a very common word. At first sight it seems an example of an Indo-Germanic word used in Semitic. Sans. ga, go (bos). But this supposition is not necessary, for we find the same root in Hebrew.\u2014See Gesenius \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 mugit bos.\n\n300. **Am.** \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, a Buffalo.\u2014A Proto-Chaldean word; in Assyrian Riema.\n\nMiri bulthuti sha \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r uzabbit, Young buffaloes I captured alive, R 28, 6; Anaku kima am ikdi pan\u016bsun azbat, I myself like a fiery bull, took the lead (of my army), Sen. T. iii, 74. I believe ikdi \u2018fiery\u2019 is the Chald. \u05d0\u05b2\u05e8\u05b5\u05d3 \u2018ardens.\u2019\n\n301. **Riema,** a Buffalo. Heb. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05dc bubalus.\u2014Kima riemi rabi garna-su ittanassi, like a great buffalo he raised his horn\u2014(tablet 133 otherwise 102b). Of this there is a P.C. version. Kima riemi rabi, is rendered Am rab kim.\n\n302. **Zini.** \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, Sheep.\u2014Agrees with the Heb. \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r or \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r a flock (either of sheep or goats). Marsit lu-zini, the young of sheep, Annals i, 52; see also Obelisk 137 and Tig. vii, 12. Other inscriptions, as R 28, 22, and R 37, 50, write the word in the form \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r.\n\nThe singular of the word \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r \u2018a flock\u2019 is \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r or \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r \u2018a sheep;\u2019 for which the Ch. and Syr. substitute \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r or \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r, by a remarkable law of permutation of the letters \u1e25 and \u1e25 which occur in many other words, as \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r for \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r (terra), \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r for \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r (lana), &c. This Syriac word \u1e25a\u1e63\u1e63\u0101r resembles the Greek (accus. case) \u1f44\u03b1\u03bd \u2018a sheep.\u2019\n\nThe word Zini is usually preceded by Lu, which appears to mean \u2018animal;\u2019 but sometimes it stands alone, as in one copy of Tig. vii, 12.\n303. **Gin\u00e1.** \\( \\text{\u05d2\u05b4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0} \\), a Sheep; plural ginie \\( \\text{\u05d2\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9} \\). Sheep.\u2014I think this word is the Chaldee and Syriac \\( \\text{\u05d2\u05b4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0} \\), which is equivalent to the Hebrew \\( \\text{\u05d2\u05b4\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0} \\). (see the preceding article). Instead of the letter \\( \\text{\u05d2} \\) Ain the Arabic substitutes the aspirate Ghain in this word [Arab. Ghanam, a sheep].\n\nThis word occurs in Phill. ii, 36. \u201cEvery day I presented eight sheep to the god Nergal.\u201d And again ii, 39, eli ginie labri gin\u00e1 usatir, to the former sheep I added one sheep more.\n\nNebuchadnezzar's inscription in the Chaldee of Babylon uses ginie; the Assyrian inscriptions of Nineveh use zini (No. 302).\n\n304. **Hukludi.** \\( \\text{\u05d4\u05bb\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9} \\), Sheep. Chald. \\( \\text{\u05d4\u05bb\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9} \\). Bellino lines 17, 18, 23 and 31.\u2014The parallel passage in Sen. T. i. 50 and following lines, three times substitutes tsieni \u201csheep.\u201d\n\nIn 2R38, 26 the word hukludi seems to be represented by its first syllable \\( \\text{\u05d4\u05bb\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9} \\) alone. Three explanations are given, one of which is Rubutz. I think this is the Heb. \\( \\text{\u05e8\u05b7\u05d1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05ea} \\) a flock of sheep or herd of cattle (properly lying down, or feeding in great tranquillity).\n\n305. **Kupi.** \\( \\text{\u05e7\u05bb\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9} \\), Monkeys.\u2014Pagie u kupi tarbit saddi sun, ( . . . . ) and monkeys, natives of their mountains.\u2014Opp. Eg. p. 79 [part of the plunder of Thebes]. Oppert translates kupi by simias, which I think probable, since the Hebrew agrees; \\( \\text{\u05e7\u05bb\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9} \\) kup, simia.\n\n306. **Nakhira.** \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b0\u05d9\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0} \\), Dolphins.\u2014So called from their spouting water from their nostrils. From Heb. \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b7\u05d7\u05b0\u05e8} \\) nakhar, to snort: Syriac nakhira, a nostril. As elippi sha Arvadaia irkab, nakhira as yabba rabti iduk; on ships of Arvad he embarked, dolphins in the Great Sea he slew.\u2014R28, 3. The Great Sea is the Mediterranean. Arvad or Aradus was an ancient and celebrated seaport. In the long lists of presents and tribute offered to the Assyrian Kings we find mentioned ka nakhiri binuta yabba, the teeth of dolphins, creatures of the sea.\n\nI gave this translation of the passage in October, 1859 (Journ. R.A.S. Vol. 19, p. 127), but I have since found that the curious word nakhira had been previously recognized by Oppert.\n307. **Nameru.** The king of Egypt sent to the king of Elamite a number of rare animals for his museum or menagerie.\u2014See, in among these are mentioned\u2014Nameru (see further in the form Nameru).\u2014Botta, Vol. 19, p. 133), that Nameru was the Egyptian name of Khnum, which we know from Herodotus was the native name of the Crocodile. M. Oppert has accepted this explanation of the word. Egyptian names often begin with N (see Champollion's grammar).\n\n308. **Arabu.** Locusts.\u2014See. Arabu, a locust.\n\nIn the description of the great invasion of the Elamites, which preceded the battle of Khurad, the following simile occurs:\n\n\"Then is a mighty swarm of locusts covers the face of the earth; they rushed in destroying multitudes against me kima akha imma abu jana maha, bishamiru-una episki dakhmati abu taru.\"\n\nThis recalls to mind the description in the prophet Joel of the utter desolation of Judah by the Assyrian armies, who spread over it as a cloud of destroying locusts, obscuring the face of heaven\u2014\n\n\"That which the palmer-worm hath left, hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left, hath the canker-worm eaten . . . . For a nation is come up upon my land, strong and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion . . . . the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness.\"\u2014Joel ii. 3.\n\nThen the simile of the locusts is still further continued: \"They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the wall; they shall climb up into the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.\"\u2014Joel ii. 9.\n\n309. **Ishati.** Fire. Flames.\u2014\"140 villages which are on Mount Arzabia I took, and burnt with fire,\" in ishati ashruj.\u2014Botta 76, 11. Often expressed by the monogram.\n\nThus, in a short prayer to the god of Fire [tablet K 44 side 2, lines 10, 11], the P.C. illa, is translated in Assyrian by as ishati-ka illi \"with\nthy celestial fire.\" (The P.C. pronoun \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 zu 'thy' answers to the Assyrian \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 ka). These are two examples to be added to that given in Dict. 496 (which Mr. Norris says is the only one he had found) in ishati ikalu (whoever) \"in fire shall burn it.\"\u20143 Mich. i, 34 (spelt as in the other examples).\n\nA second monogram very frequently used is \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7. The word ishat agrees exactly with the Hebrew \u05be\u05d0 (fire). In Syll. 473, 474 the monogram \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 is rendered izzu or itzu \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7. If this means \"fire,\" izzu may be likewise derived from \u05be\u05d0 ignis.\n\n310. Izzit, \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, a Fire Altar.\u2014Agrees with Heb. \u05be\u05d0 'a burnt offering,' from \u05be\u05d0 'fire.' \u05be\u05d0 also signifies the fire itself, in Jeremiah. R 7, ix, A, \"The four Lions which I had slain i:bat panu izzit sha Ishtar billat takhazi,\" \"I took them before the fire-altar of Ishtar queen of battles.\" And so the bas-relief represents the scene.\n\n311. Kal\u00fb, \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, to Burn. Heb. \u05be\u05d0 to burn.\u2014 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, ikal\u00fb, \"he shall burn it,\" 3 Mich. i, 34. In Bellino 47, concerning a Canal dried up and abandoned, Its ki-makkhi-sun nakmuti ukalli muanna su, \"the beautiful ki trees (on its banks) had been burnt as firewood, years ago.\" \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, ukalli, 'they had been burnt.' In this passage I believe that su belongs to the Hebrew verb \u05be\u05d0 'to be': mu-anna su (sunt anni). Compare the participle sut of the same verb, if I mistake not, in Nabonidus R 68, 8. Urukh sar sut makhri: Urukh, rex qui fuit olim. In the following example of the verb kalah the syllable kal is represented by the peculiar sign \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, \"Whoever in flames shall burn them,\" \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 in ishati ikall\u00fb. Tig. viii, 66.\n\n312. Akmu, \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7, I burned.\u2014This is a very common verb. Opp. Khors. 5 line 5, \"The cities of the land of Manna I burned with fire,\" as isati akmu \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7. So in R 40, 67, et passim. The theme of this verb appears to be kam\u00fb \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 \ud808\udc97\ud808\uddb7 'to burn,' which stand nexts to nakmil\nA GLOSSARY OF THE\n\n\u2018to be burnt\u2019 in 2R34, 69. As a further proof of this, see 2R35, 15, where the verb kam\u00e9 is explained first by the verb sarabu which is the Heb. \u2018to burn;\u2019 and secondly by the verb kal\u00e9 which is the Heb. \u2018to burn.\u2019\u2014See No. 311.\n\n313. Nakmut. a Burning.\u2014The cities of Susiana had been set on fire. Kutar nakmuti-sun kima im-kab kabti pan shamie raputi usaktim. \u201cThe smoke of their burning, like a mighty cloud, obscured the face of high heaven.\u201d\u2014R40, 68.\n\nUsaktim is the S conjugation of katim \u2018to conceal\u2019 Heb. The simple verb katim is found in R41, 47, where \u2018a cloud of dust\u2019 conceals the heavens. See another example of the word nakmut in No. 311, where it is written in the form Bellino 47.\n\n314. Kutar. Smoke. Heb. fumus. (see the preceding article).\n\n315. Kutra. Incense. Heb. \u2018incense offered to the gods,\u2019 \u2018suffimentum\u2019: \u2018thymiama.\u2019\u2014This word is the same as the last, in a different acceptation. It only occurs in one passage, where Sargina receives tribute from Ithamar king of the Sabaeans\u2014but the reading is doubtful (see art. Ishbi, No. 115).\n\n316. Khutarati. Fragrant: sweet smelling. Arab. \u2018to be fragrant\u2019; same as Heb. \u2018to burn incense\u2019; \u2018to exhale fragrance.\u2019\u2014In the tribute of Jehu son of Omri recorded on the second Epigraph of the Obelisk, \u201cfragrant woods\u201d are mentioned; and similarly in the first Epigraph.\n\n317. Burukhati. Fragrant: incense breathing.\u2014A word formed \u2018per metathesin\u2019 from bukhurati which is the Arabic bukhur \u201cperfume, odour, or anything which diffuses fragrance, as aloes, musk, thyme, storax, frankincense, &c.\u201d Catafago\u2019s Dict. p. 42. In the fourth Epigraph of the Obelisk, in the tribute of a king called Marduk-polassar, \u2018odoriferous woods\u2019 are mentioned.\n318. Kasar. \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97, a King.\u2014This very curious word appears to me to be the origin of the German Kaiser. This idea was published by Norris in his Dict. p. 624, but it has been known to me for some time. Mr. Norris's reference to 43 II 42 c is wrong. It should be 33 II 42 c. The passage referred to is \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 i.e. \"Kasar signifies a King.\" This stands among a number of other terms, each of which signifies a King. Mr. Norris has given no other example of the word: I will therefore add one, which is found in the same page and column, l. 18.\n\nKasar mu I kan, kitsir matti-su,\n\nVI thu kaspa salat\u00ee: \"The King's first year. Abundance in his land. Six thu of silver . . . . . .\" According to Hincks (Norris's Dict. p. 461) six thu would be one-tenth of a muna.\n\nPerhaps however \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 should be read shatti-su 'in his year,' i.e. 'in his first or regnal year;' which would correspond in meaning with the P.C. \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97.\n\n319. Bil. \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97, a Lord, a Chief. Often written \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97. Heb. \u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u2014In 2 R 36, lines 7, 8, 9, we find three names for the Leader of an Army, or the General in command: alik makhri, bil pani, and bil emuki, to which correspond the P.C. terms \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 and \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97. Norris has given a copious account of the word Bil and its derivatives (Dict. p. 84).\n\n320. Bilt\u00fb. \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97, Government. Lordship. 2 R 36, 61.\u2014The orthography agrees with that of the preceding article Bil \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97.\u2014Several variations of the word are given in the opposite column, namely \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 bilitu, \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 bilatu, \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 ebiltu (in which the initial vowel is remarkable), and \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 bahilatu.\n\n321. Bahilat. \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97, sometimes \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97 \ud808\ude61\ud808\udc97, Government.

It agrees exactly with the Heb. \u05d1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea \u05be\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea 'a City,' see Gesenius p. 163. \"Of all the kings of former days, my fathers who went before me, who reigned before me over Assyria, and governed the city of\nBel\" (umahiru bahilat Bel)\u2014Bellino 38. So also in the Phillips cylinder (l. 3), Nebuchadnezzar is called mustishir bahulati Bel, Shemesh, u Marduk, ruler of the cities of Bel, the Sun, and Marduk, i.e. of all the cities where those deities were worshipped.\n\n322. Sham\u00fb. \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, Heaven.\u2014The singular of Shamie, the Heavens (Gloss. No. 2). Seldom occurs. 2 R 48, 26. Sham\u00fb, Kiti, Ilu, Ishtar, Heaven, Earth, God, Goddess.\u2014Gesenius says that the singular of the Hebrew \u05e9\u05de\u05d9\u05dd \u2018the Heavens\u2019 is lost.

And in line 17 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 tsit Samsi, sunrise; \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 erib Samsi, sunset. Expressed in the P.C. language by \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 Tara, sunrise: \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 Miga, sunset. The temple of Tara the rising sun is very much spoken of in the inscriptions of Babylon.

In B.M. 12, 16 we read, tamdi rabti sha dimu samsi, the great sea of the setting sun: written \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 with the divine sign \ud808\udc97 which is wanting in the former example.\n\n324. Shamas. \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97, the Sun.\u2014Same as the last, but so differently written that I have thought it best to give it separately. The Arabic pronunciation is Shams, as Shams-ed-din \u2018Sun of Religion,\u2019 a well known name in Arabian story. Sir J.G. Wilkinson pronounces Shems (Thebes, &c. p. 582). In B.M. 73, 16 the king receives tribute from Samsi queen of the Arabians \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97 sha mamat Shamas titiku, \u2018who still retains the very ancient worship of the Sun.\u2019 This curious fact was known to us from various passages of authors. Herodotus says the Arabians worship only the Sun and Moon, whom they call Orotul and Allat (see what I have said on this subject in Gloss. No. 25). Allat I now consider to be the Arabic Halalat \u2018the new moon\u2019 (Catafago\u2019s Dict.). The passage which I have quoted\nfrom B.M. 73, 16 has been well explained by Oppert (Khors. p. 78). I agree with him, except as to the feminine verb *titiku*, which I would derive from Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u2018antiquus,\u2019 from verb \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u2018antiquus esse.\u2019 We have here the Hiphil of this verb, \u2018ex antiquo tenet.\u2019 [Schindler renders \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df perseverare \u2018to continue.\u2019] This queen of the Arabians *Samsi* evidently took her name from her deity *Samas* the Sun, of which it is a female form. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df for \u2018worship\u2019 is found in several other passages.\n\n**325. Tamu.**\n\nThis word is so important and common that I will add a few more examples of it [see No. 24]. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df sha tamu \u2018of a day,\u2019 i.e. \u2018every day.\u2019\u2014Phill. ii, 36. \u201cEvery day I gave 8 sheep unto Nergal and Lash the gods of the temple of Mislam and Tigga.\u201d\n\n\u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df Tami uma \u2018on the same day.\u2019\u2014In 1 Mich. iii, 23 (R pl. 70) a curse is pronounced on him who shall destroy the landmark. Ishtar billat shamie u kiti, Tami uma ana makhar Ili u Sarri ana silikti lirtidad-su, \u201cmay Ishtar queen of heaven and earth, on one and the same day before both god and the king, plunge him into ruin.\u201d Here the P.C. word *silik* (evil) is of doubtful pronunciation: I think Norris reads *hul* (Dict. 419): the spelling is *si-lik*. *Lirtidad* is the opt. of the T conjugation of a verb *radad*. The root in its simplest form may be the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df otherwise \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df (aliquem) precipitavit, conject, pr\u00e6cipitem dedit. (Ges.) The LXX have \u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03af\u03b7\u03c3\u03b5. Job xvi, 11. But the Hiphil of \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df also means \u2018deorsum misit,\u2019 ex gr. \u2018in Orcum.\u2019 Ges. I suppose therefore that the two roots \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df and \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df are cognate. A similar imprecation in Tig. viii, 87 says, \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df I tama l\u00e1 titzu likbi, \u2018may he not call one day happy!\u2019 This is nearly Rawlinson\u2019s translation (in 1857), and it seems to be undoubtedly correct. In E.I.H. viii, 64 Nebuchadnezzar boasts that he built the temple of Babylon in fifteen days. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df In XV tamu sibir-sha usaklil. This is the famous passage which shows the truthfulness of the historian Berosus, who relates this fact in his history. This remarkable confirmation of the results of Assyrian decipherment was first\nannounced by Sir H. Rawlinson at a lecture at the Royal Institution in May 1855.\n\n326. Kharran. \u1e2aR\u0331N R\u0331N \u1e24R\u0331N, a Road: and thence, more particularly, an Inroad, a hostile expedition.\u2014Plural Kharranat \u1e2aR\u0331N R\u0331N \u1e24R\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N or \u1e2aR\u0331N R\u0331N \u1e24R\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N, or more briefly \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N, or, omitting the termination nat, \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N. A peculiar monogram \u1e2aR\u0331N stands for this word, see 2R 38, 22 \u1e2aR\u0331N. \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N. This is fully confirmed by other examples. When Tiglath Pileser had made an end of his wars and his conquests, he concludes his account of them with the following words (Tig. vi, 49), Ezib kharranat akhi mad\u0101tu sha ana litati-ya l\u00e1 kirba, \u2018I omit many other hostile expeditions, which I did not insert in my historic tablets.\u2019 This simple phrase gave great trouble to the translators of 1857. Rawlinson\u2019s translation is much the best, (\u201cI have omitted many . . . . expeditions\u201d). Hincks and myself mistook the word madatu which means \u2018many\u2019 for madatu \u2018tribute,\u2019 which is spelt the same. This error of course destroyed the sense of the passage. Other words which we did not then understand were \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N akhi \u2018other,\u2019 litati \u2018tablets\u2019 or \u2018records,\u2019 and kirba to include, insert, introduce; a verb often used of writing on tablets. I have only lately remarked that this passage (Tig. vi, 49) has been copied in another inscription (R 28, 34) which is unfortunately much mutilated;\u2014Ezib kharranat akhi \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N [then comes a fracture]. The words which follow are likewise similar in both inscriptions.\u2014\u201cIn good roads I went in my Chariot; in bad roads on foot. I pursued my enemies and conquered them.\u201d The parallelism of the passages is therefore established. The plural kharranat must be restored in the following passage. Bukhar-sun usappikh, uparrir kharranat-zun, \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N I put to flight their army, I destroyed their hostile invasion. Bavian 39 (Norris 82). For, exactly the same thing is said in Sen. T. iv, 42 (Norris 81), only interchanging the substantives \u1e2aR\u0331N \u1e62\u0331N I kharranat-zu usappikh uparrir bukhar-su. Hence uparrir and usappikh had nearly the same meaning. The latter appears to be the Heb. \u05e0\u05e1\u05d7 or \u05e0\u05e1\u05d7.\nfudit (put to flight) Ges. 967. Bukhar 'an army' is from the Assyrian verb pahkar 'to assemble.'\n\nSee also Gloss. No. 53.\n\n327. Asbut. \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 Oracles; or adj. Oracular. Ch. Magus.\n\nOn Sargina's invasion, Merodach Baladan hastily collected the holy images, to prevent them from falling into the invader's hands and being carried off to Nineveh. \"Iri-su asbuti u ili asib libbi-sun ki istin upakhir, ana Dur-Yakin usarib; the gods dwelling in the Oracle-Cities he collected them every one, and brought them into the city of Dur-Yakina.\"\u2014Opp. Khors. pl. 14. The translation of 'iri-su asbuti,' urbes ejus oraculis insignes, is due to Oppert. I think it is correct, and if so it is of great importance, because some modern scholars have supposed the word \u1f41\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2, which occurs repeatedly in the book of Daniel, to be a corruption of the Greek \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2,\u2014whereas we now see it in an Assyrian inscription of the eighth century B.C.\n\nThe city of Asbit or Asbat, \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 is mentioned 2R67, 11 among the makhazi (holy cities) of Babylonia, where great sacrifices were offered on solemn occasions. Perhaps Asbat means 'the oracle.'\n\nMoreover, if we turn to 2R15, 5 we shall find that \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 is explained by \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 namga (the Oracle) \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 (of the divine Kua). This Kua was a famous shrine of Marduk, mentioned in the E.I.H. inscription and elsewhere. Namga may be the well known Hebrew word Nam, 'a divine voice,' which occurs so often in the Old Testament in the phrase \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 \u05d0\u05de\u05e8 'saith the Lord:' (ga being merely a P.C. case ending, which is added to many words, as \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 for \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 'good, fortunate, holy:' and \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 for the Assyrian \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 'a field' in 2R15, 18). The text 2R15, 5 after explaining that Assabut means the divine Kua, adds \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 ushatzi 'it spoke.' If we now turn to line 4 of the same plate, we find another form of the word \u1f41\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2, namely ussab or \u1f41\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03c2 ussabi (in the gen. case). The Bit ussabi is explained \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 \u1f08\u03c3\u03b2\u03bf\u03c4 Bit galla 'the great Temple,' Kua 'of the Oracle.'\nHence *mashapti* an 'oracle' or 'prediction,' if I have rightly read the word, in my translation of the \"War in Syria.\" Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, Vol. 8, p. 266.\n\n328. **Tugu.** \u05b4\u05bc\u05bd\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05bc\u05bd\u05d0, a Multitude.\u2014Heb. \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05d1\u05b7\u05e8 'to multiply,' which occurs Genes. xlviii., 16, 'let them grow into a multitude'\u2014Botta 163, 6. \"Zukullat gai gammali tsieni . . . . . ummanat Ashur gashati \u05d9\u05b4\u05bd\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05bd\u05d0 tami mushi (\u05d0\u05b4\u05bd\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05bd\u05d0) tugu la nibi ishlulunu; the herds of oxen camels and sheep the active soldiers of Ashur for three days and nights, a multitude without number, carried off for spoil.\"\n\n329. **Dugut.** \u05b4\u05bd\u05ea\u05b0\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05bd\u05d0\u05b6\u05bd\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 adj.

But there is no Hebrew numeral ashla. A surveyor's rope or chain, however, having a fixed length and being divided into parts, naturally acquired a numerical value, and this accounts for the form of the adjective which we are now considering. The scientific defence of the city of Dur-Yakina by Merodach Baladan, described in Opp. Khors. pl. 14, has given much trouble to inter-\npreters. Yet I think the account is pretty clear. On the approach of Sargina's army, Merodach Baladan withdrew into his city, and prepared for a vigorous defence. The first thing he did was what the commandant of an attacked fortress generally does at the present day. He threw down and levelled everything within a certain distance of the Citadel. In this level space he then dug a broad and deep fosse, and filled it with water from the neighbouring Euphrates. At first there were bridges over it, (no doubt for convenience), but on Sargina's approach he cut them down. Nevertheless the city was taken by storm, but Merodach Baladan escaped during the darkness of the night.\n\n\"Ashlat\u00e2n lapan dur-su rabi unissi, he levelled everything to the distance of a rope's length from his great citadel.\" The verb unissi or unissi stands here for the very common verb umissi 'he levelled.' The substitution of N for M is frequent in Assyrian words. Thus, for instance, we find khansha 'fifty' instead of khamsha; and mitzut for nitzut 'hostile.'\n\n333. Misikhta. also written\n\nMeasure. Agrees exactly with the Heb. misikh 'mensuravit.'\n\n\"Amsukh misikhta, I measured the measure.\"\u2014Bellino line 52.\n\nI will take the occasion of this word to call attention to some very curious speculations of Mr. Norris on the measurement of Sargina's palace (see Dict. p. 524). He seems not to have been aware that I proposed a similar theory (though the details are very different) in a paper read before the R. S. of Literature in March, 1861. I will therefore reprint a portion of it, from Vol. 7 of the Transactions, p. 178.\n\n\"In line 45 of the same inscription [Sargina's cylinder] when Sargina was about to build his palace at Khorsabad, we find, what is very curious, that he was prompted by a superstitious feeling to build the palace of such a size that the number of cubits contained in its area corresponded exactly with the number of his own name!\u2014So ancient was the idea that the letters in a man's name, translated into numbers, had a mysterious influence over his destiny, and so\nfar was it from being only a late Jewish superstition.\u2014It follows, that Sargina must have used habitually an alphabetic and not the cuneiform writing; for, can we suppose that numerical values attached to all the cuneiform signs, so that a Cuneiform name could be read with certainty as a number?\" And again in p. 181 I said, \"I now proceed to another portion of the text (line 55), where we find a series of numbers. The sign \\( \\text{\\(\\Delta\\)} \\) is four times repeated; then \\( \\text{\\(\\Upsilon\\)} \\) three times; then follows one vas (or sus), three kani, and two hu, which last we know to be cubits, since the word is explained by amma in the E.I.H. inscription, Heb. amma \\( \\text{\\(\\text{\u05d0\u05de\u05d4}\\)} \\) 'a cubit'\u2014I am unable to say what sum these numerals when added together amount to. But there immediately follows: \"Nibit mu-ya, the number of my name, misikhti dur-su ashkunu, I determined should be the measure of the palace.\" Nibit is sometimes used for 'name' (as, 'ashkira nibit-zu') and sometimes for 'number,' as in the phrase la nibi 'numberless.' 'The number of a man's name,' brings to mind a passage in the Apocalypse.\"\u2014Transactions R.S.L. Vol. 7.\n\nThese speculations, being now supported by the concurrent opinion of Mr. Norris, will I hope be further examined.\n\n334. Kizir or Kitzir. \\( \\text{\\(\\text{\u05db\u05d9\u05d6\u05d9\u05e8}\\)} \\).\u2014This word has various meanings. Mr. Norris has an excellent article upon it (Dict. p. 549). I will at present only consider one of its meanings. In No. 318 I have translated it 'abundance,' a sense which it bears in Arabic. But on further consideration of the passage, compared with one in 2R15, 20 I suspect that Kizir in Assyrian is equivalent to Kasar 'a King' in Proto-Chaldean. The text of 2R33, 17 is obscure, but if we suppose that the scribe wrote sar-ka by mistake for ka-sar it becomes all right. I will give this line (so altered) and the following line, to show this.\n\nLine 17. P.C. Kasar tuta-uddu. Assyrian. Kizir ushatzi (the King spoke, or decreed).\n\nLine 18. P.C. Kasar mu I kan. Assyrian. Kizir shattu-su (the King in his first or regnal year).\n\nN.B.\u2014The P.C. verb tuta-uddu (usually tutan-uddu) is very common; it always answers to the Assyrian ushatzi.\nI now proceed to the passage 2 R15, 20.\n\nThe P.C. text has \u1e2ai\u1e2b kasarda bita kumtu turri; of which the Assyrian version is In libbi kizir, bit uzakhar (within the palace I built a small new house): i.e. within the precinct of the palace, which usually contained many separate buildings.\n\nN.B.\u2014These are words of frequent occurrence, namely \u1e2ai\u1e2b kum \u2018new\u2019 \u1e2ai\u1e2b turri \u2018small,\u2019 answering to the Assyrian \u1e2ai\u1e2b zakhar \u2018small.\u2019 With respect to kasarda, since we have from sar \u2018king\u2019 the adjective sarda \u2018royal\u2019 or \u2018crown,\u2019 I presume that kasar \u2018king\u2019 has the adjective kasarda \u2018anything royal\u2019 ex.gr. \u2018a royal palace.\u2019 If these remarks are correct, Kizir must have meant \u2018a Palace\u2019 in Assyrian. Surely this must be identical with the Arabic word \u1e33asr \u2018a Palace.\u2019 If so, we must either give up the connexion of the word Kasar with the German Kaiser, or suppose that both of them had the same origin as the Arabic Kasr.\n\n\u00b6 In the fourth line of the same plate 2 R15 the P.C. Bit kasarda is translated by the Assyrian \u1e2ai\u1e2b \u1e2ai\u1e2b Bit kiziri. This word kiziri is the genitive case of kizir \u1e2ai\u1e2b \u1e2ai\u1e2b. This passage confirms the other.\n\n\u00b6 It will be said that Kaiser is derived from the Latin C\u00e6sar. The connexion is of course evident, but some think that the Roman patronymic C\u00e6sar meant originally that the family was \u2018of royal descent.\u2019\n\n\u00b6 The beautiful building at Seville, known as the Alcazar or Royal Palace (Arab. al kasr), much resembles in its name the cuneiform Kasar.\n\n\u00b6 The Czar of Russia bears the same eastern name. The derivation from C\u00e6sar is now generally rejected, because in the Russian bible Czar or Tzar signifies \u2018a King,\u2019 as in the Lord\u2019s Prayer \u2018thy kingdom\u2019 is rendered t.ar-stvoe twoe.\u2014Old Russian books speak of the Tzar of Kasan, the Tzar of the Krim, the Tzar of the golden horde, and other petty Tartarian and Siberian kings are named tzars. Therefore, says Mr. Tooke (quoted in Rees\u2019s Cyclop\u00e6dia)\nwe may suppose with the highest probability that the Russian nation finding these tzars among the neighbouring people borrowed the title from them.\n\nThe word \\( \\text{Kizurat} \\), which occurs 2R57, 12 among the titles of a great goddess apparently Beltis, does not belong here. The passage says that Beltis was surrounded (kizurat) right and left with light of exceeding splendour. Another title is \\( \\text{Sarat abei} \\), 'Queen of the heavenly Abyss or Ocean,' probably the original \\( \\Omega \\kappa \\epsilon \\alpha \\nu \\sigma \\) of the Greeks. \\( \\Omega \\kappa \\epsilon \\alpha \\nu \\sigma \\tau \\epsilon \\Theta \\epsilon \\omega \\nu \\gamma \\epsilon \\varepsilon \\tau \\omega \\) \u2014(Hom.).\n\n335. Uduri. \\( \\text{Bactrian Camels. Apparently the same as Uturati (see No. 296).\u2014The latter word may mean 'She Camels'\u2014compare Anakati (No. 297). The inscription of Esarhaddon col. iv, line 17 relates a campaign in 'distant Media'\u2014Ga, tsieni, uduri; 'their oxen, sheep and camels' (I carried off to Assyria). As this 'distant Media' perhaps comprised Bactria, the Uduri were probably Bactrian Camels.}\n\nI find another example of Alap 'a bull' (No. 298) in 2R49, 45 where \\( \\text{Albu} \\) is explained \\( \\text{Gla, 'an Ox.'} \\)\n\nHukludi 'sheep' (No. 304) occurs as one of the constellations in 2R49, 67, along with urmak 'the lion;' allab \\( \\text{the bull;} \\) \\( \\text{the fish'} &c.&c. Compare Aries, Taurus, Leo, Pisces of the Greek Zodiac.\n\nThe constellation \\( \\text{Laba} \\) (ibid. line 42) may be 'the Lioness;' Heb. \\( \\text{or} \\) but I have not found the word elsewhere.\n\n336. Zamad. \\( \\text{a Yoke. Hebrew} \\) 'jugum.'\u2014\\( \\text{zamad sha rukubi 'yoke of a chariot.'} \\) 2R27, 24.\n\nNorris gives another example of the word (Dict. p. 353) \\( \\text{rukub zamat-zu 'his yoked chariot.'} \\)\n\n337. Elu. \\( \\text{a Yoke.\u2014This is exactly the Hebrew word} \\) 'jugum.' It occurs in 2R27, 25 next to zamad (see last article). \\( \\text{elu sha rukubi 'yoke of a chariot.'} \\)\n338. **Dapanu**. \\( \\text{\ud800\udf95\ud800\udf81\ud800\udfa1} \\), a Yoke.\u2014This occurs in 2 R 27, 23 along with the two preceding words *zamad* and *eld*. That they have all the same meaning seems scarcely doubtful. \\( \\text{\ud800\udf95\ud800\udf81\ud800\udfa1} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\), *dapanu sha rukubi* \u2018yoke of a chariot.\u2019\n\nThis word *Dapanu*, if I mistake not, is a metathesis or transposition (and a very remarkable one) of the Chald. and Syr. *Padanu* \u2018a yoke,\u2019 \\( \\text{\ud800\udf9b\ud800\udfa1} \\). Such permutations are frequent in Hebrew, and also in Assyrian, as *tikbi* for *tibki*, a measure of length (both of which forms are in use); and *bidmuk* for *midbuk* \u2018an altar,\u2019 the former being the Assyrian, the latter the Hebrew form.\n\nI think I find the same meaning of *Dapanu* in the following passage. *Lib libbi sha* (....) \u2018descendant of (....);\u2019 *sarri dapini nakur Ashur* \u2018the king who subjugated (or yoked) the enemies of Ashur.\u2019\u2014Tig. vii, 56. \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) *Nakur* for *Nakiri* \u2018enemies.\u2019\n\n339. **Nab\u00fb**. \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa7} \\) (a Prophet. Also a Prophecy, Oracle, or Oracular Voice. The Hebrew agrees.\u2014\\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b8\u05d0} \\) *naba* \u2018to prophecy\u2019 *(etiam insanire, fureri, ut \u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, \u1f51\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd Ges.)* \\( \\text{\u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05d4} \\) \u2018a prophet.\u2019 This interesting word is in common use at the present day. Arab. *Nabi*, the Prophet. In 2 R 7, 36 there is an important list of the various meanings of the word *nab\u00fb* \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa7} \\). It was, in the first place, identified with the name of the god *Nebo* or *Nabo*, written \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa7} \\) or \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa7} \\). It is also explained by the word \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) *Asbat* \u2018an Oracle.\u2019 This important verification of the word *Asbat* was accidentally omitted in its proper place in No. 327.\n\n340. **Nabi**. \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfa7} \\) the Gods.\u2014In Sargon\u2019s cylinder line 45 (or line 55 of Oppert\u2019s folio edition) the King says: \u201cIn a great crowd and affluence of the people of every rank, I lifted up my hands (*attali kati*) to the gods dwelling at Niniveh (\\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) *sibat Ninua).*\u2014*Sikri pi-ya kin\u00fb ki uluni eli Nabi tsiri bili-ya*, \u2018when the prayers of my zealous lips had arisen to the great gods my lords, *mahatish ikhibu* \u2018they were greatly pleased;\u2019 *epish ar, khirie nahar iktuni* \u2018and commanded me to build the city and excavate the river.\u2019\u2014Here *sikri* \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) or \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) \\( \\text{\ud800\udfa4\ud800\udfa7} \\) is the Arabic *shukr* prayer, praise, thanksgiving\u2014*shakar Allah* \u2018to praise God.\u2019 (This\nword may be related to the Latin *sacra* 'religious rites,' which originally came to Italy from the East.)\n\n*Nabi tsiri bili-ya* 'the great gods my lords.' *Nabi* was therefore a Proto-Chaldean name for the gods. It is evidently the plural of *Nabu* (see last article), but I do not find *Nabu* used in Assyrian for 'a god' simply, though it sometimes means the god *Nebo* in particular. But if we turn to the Scythian language we shall find proof almost certain that *Nab* or *Nabo* meant 'a god' in that dialect. The ancient symbol for 'a god' was a star. This must have been invented by a nation who worshipped the stars, and all the host of heaven, as their gods. In process of time the star * degenerated into the form* (which we find in the Assyrian writing). And the plural word * 'the gods' degenerated into*. This latter form the Assyrians used (writing it) to express the syllable *Nab*; for the simple reason that *Nap* or *Annap* meant 'gods' in Scythic. This curious discovery was made by Mr. Norris some years ago. Similarly 'the stars' * came to be written*. But the Michaux stones in the British Museum preserve the ancient form.\n\n*Annap* is used both for 'a god' and 'gods.' This word however reduces itself to *Nap* or *Nab* since the first syllable *An* is the sign of 'divinity,' perhaps not pronounced (see Mr. Norris's Scythic Vocabulary, p. 199).\n\n341. **Munnabta.** , a Ventriloquist. Inspired Man. Prophet. In 2 R7, 47 this is placed among the words derived from *Nabu* a Prophet, or Oracle. Among the various explanations there given of *Nabu* one is especially remarkable in line 38, where it is rendered , *Ka Kabal*, or *Ka Kabil* 'Voice within,' or 'Internal Voice.' And, as if to prevent doubt, the Assyrian scribe has altered , *ka* into the full word , *kagu* which in P.C. means 'a Voice:' (see Syll. 476-481 where *kagu* becomes *ka* by reduction, and is then explained (*inter alia*) by , *pi* 'the voice'). Now if we turn to line 47 we shall find that *Munnabta* is explained , 'a man possessing an Internal Voice' i.e. 'a Ventriloquist.' It is unnecessary to observe that ventriloquism might have played an\nimportant part among the tricks by which the pagan and idolatrous priests deceived their votaries. See Rees's Cyclop\u00e6dia, art. Ventriquinus. The LXX call such a person \u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03c5\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2, other authors have \u0395\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, showing that he was supposed to have a prophetic or oracular spirit within him.\n\n342. Nibitta. \u0722\u0712\u0323\u072c\u0323\u0710 \u0729\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0715\u0323\u0722\u0323\u0710 an Oracle. In 2R7, 42 this word is placed among the words correlated to Nabu 'an Oracle.'\u2014This gloss enables us to explain the names of certain cities, as \u0722\u0712\u0323\u072c\u0323\u0710 \u0729\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0715\u0323\u0722\u0323\u0710 Nibit Laguda 'the Oracle of Laguda;' which is frequently mentioned in Sargon's inscriptions.\n\n343. Zamat. \u0719\u0323\u0721\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u0710, A kind of precious stone.\u2014In No. 30 I have offered the conjecture that this stone was the Onyx. I have since found the following strong confirmation of it. In 2R40, 48 is the gloss \u0719\u0323\u0721\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u0710 \u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0721\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u0710 from which we learn that the zamat stone was also called the tsibru. Now if we consult Schindler's Lexicon we shall find that \u071b\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u071d\u0323\u0726\u0323\u072a\u0323\u0710 tsipra means the Onyx stone; therefore I think the zamat is proved to be the Onyx. But \u071b\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u071d\u0323\u0726\u0323\u072a\u0323\u0710 tsipra has yet another meaning, that of unguis 'a nail.' So in Greek the word \u039f\u1f50\u03b2\u03be signifies both the precious stone and the nail. Some say, this was because the stone is semi-transparent, but this is uncertain. At any rate, the resemblance holds good in both languages.\n\n344. Kabaz. \u071f\u0323\u0712\u0323\u0719\u0323\u0710 \u0710\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0720\u0323\u0710, a Furnace \u0720\u0323\u0710. The Hebrew word is \u0720\u0323\u0710, but the final N is merely formative, as is evident from the Arabic khabb\u0101z 'a baker,' whence khubz 'bread.' In 2R27, 47 we find kabaz sha ishati explained by \u071f\u0323\u0712\u0323\u0719\u0323\u0710 \u0710\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0720\u0323\u0710 \u071f\u0323\u0718\u0323\u0721\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u071d\u0323\u0722\u0323\u0710 kum tintin 'a fire-furnace.' Here \u071f\u0323\u0718\u0323\u0721\u0323\u0710 \u071b\u0323\u071d\u0323\u0722\u0323\u0710 kum 'fire' is explained by \u071b\u0323\u071d\u0323\u0722\u0323\u0710 \u0710\u0323\u0720\u0323\u0710 \u0720\u0323\u0710 ishati as in Gloss. No. 309 (of which it affords another useful example); and kabaz is explained by tintin. This is the Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 'a furnace,' from \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 tannan 'to smoke' in Syr. and Ch. (see Gesen.) The reduplicate \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 arises naturally, as in many other verbs.\n\nHence, if I mistake not, we may perceive the true origin of the name of Mount Etna, viz. that it was so called by the Ph\u0153nician sailors \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 Etnan \"the Furnace,\" or \"the Smoking Mountain.\"\n[A Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 (acc. case).] The similarity of the verb \u03b1\u1f34\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u2018to burn\u2019 may be fortuitous.\n\n345. Kishti. Thorns. Heb. \u05e7\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u2018thorns.\u2019 Exod. xxii, 6\u2014from root \u05e7\u05b8\u05e1\u05b7\u05d7 \u2018to cut.\u2019\u2014Ikhlubu kireb kishti, \u2018they hid themselves among the thorns\u2019: (flight of Tivumman king of the Susians and his son\u2014bas relief in the British Museum). This passage has a very singular resemblance to 2 Chron. xxxiii, 11, \u201cThe Assyrians took Manasseh among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.\u201d\u2014The Hebrew text has \u05e7\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u2018thorns.\u2019\n\n346. Isku. \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05d5, a Weapon. It would take too long at present to examine the various meanings of this word. I will therefore confine myself here to giving a passage in which it has clearly the general meaning of a \u2018weapon.\u2019 Ursa king of Urarda, having been defeated by Sargina, slew himself with a sword of iron which he held in his own hand (see the passage which I have quoted in No. 104). Now the same event is more briefly related in Botta 36, 14 in these terms: \u201cI caused the death of Ursa king of Urarda, who in despair ended his life with his own weapon,\u201d in isku ramani-su usut\u0101 napishtu\u0161. We know from the other passage that this \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05d5 was a sword of iron.\n\n347. Urrut. \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05d8 Hasty, sudden, eager, violent.\u2014From the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 or \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 a root which denotes any ardent passion of the mind, as zeal, anger, indignation, &c.\n\nUrrut is used in Assyrian more as an adverb than an adjective.\n\nOppert\u2019s Egyptian campaign p. 65 [When I heard that Egypt had revolted] instantly I gave command to my army to march thither, urrut ta\u2019emu askun sunuti, kharranu Mitsur usaskin. The next line says: \u2018eagerly and in haste they went,\u2019 urish khantish irdu.\n\nBy the help of this clear and unmistakable passage we are enabled to translate three others which occur in R pl. 41, and which until now have offered difficulty. In line 2 \u201cShadu-nakhundi king of Susiana, after his defeat, did not complete three months (i.e. did not live three months). Deprived of his Crown, he died a violent death,\u201d (urrut imtut).\u2014In line 53 of same plate; \u201cI prayed to the gods to give me Victory. They heard my prayers eagerly\nASSYRIAN LANGUAGE.\n\nand came to my assistance.\"\u2014In line 75 of same plate, in the account of the battle which then ensued, we read [I saw that the Chiefs of the Enemy wore gold-hilted daggers and armlets and anklets of shining gold]: eagerly I attacked them, (urrut ubul sunuti).\u2014In Sh. Ph. iv, 23 (quoted by Norris 299) we read, ultu pan nakharat isku-ya uruti iblakhu, they fled from the terrors of my impetuous arms. (R34, 23) written\n\n348. Urish. adv. Hotly. Fiercely.\u2014Like the last word, from Heb. 'to be hot.'\u2014I fiercely assaulted the cities on the mountain, urish lu-asnik. Tig. iii, 57. And in Tig. vi, 2 urish amdakhiz, I fought fiercely.\u2014Hence the etym. of urish proposed in No. 292 was incorrect.\n\n349. Salmish. adv. Perfectly. Heb. perfecit.\u2014In 2R36, 25 the King prays that he may always walk before the gods in perfect holiness, as well as in prosperity. The prayer ends salmish ittalluku makhar-su. The use of the plural sign for mish is curious.\u2014It resumes its original value mi-ish.\n\nThe same phrase is found in tablet K 211 or 170a in which the king decrees honours to a nobleman called Bulshaya for his zealous services. Line 13 says, Lib-su gummuru ana bel(ni-su) 'his heart was perfect unto his Lord; in makhri-ya in kinati izi(ti) ittallaku salmish 'with ardent zeal he walked before me perfectly' I have restored the final letter which is broken off. In the above, gummur is the Heb. gumur 'perfecit;' Chald. 'perfectus.' The word is common in Assyrian. Tiglath calls himself sar gimir 'the perfect king.' Kinati 'zeal' is the Heb. kinat studium ardens erga aliquem\u2014\u03ba\u03b7\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. Ges. Iziti may be 'ardent,' from izit 'fire,' but the word is broken and therefore doubtful. makhri is the oblique case of makhar which is found in the first example.\n\nSalmish also signifies 'safely,' see Gloss. No. 230. salmish atura I returned safely. Oppert's Egypt p. 59. In this phrase also an example occurs (Opp. Eg. p. 76)\nwhere salmish is written also in same work p. 80, salmish isunu-mma, 'they brought them safely' [from Thebes to Niniveh: viz. the spoils of Egypt.]\n\n350. Kamish. adv. For ever. Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd manere, durare.\n\n'May the gods put him for ever under the power of his enemies,' lisasibu-su kamish Sarg. 67, also Botta 61 l. ult. and many other inscriptions. Here has the value mish as in the preceding article salmish. But in other texts we find kamish written at full length as in Esar. ii, 5 'In front of the great gate of the entrance of Niniveh I placed them to remain for ever,' usu\u0161il sunuti kamish.\n\n351. Azmish. adv. Nobly: or Strongly.\u2014This is another example of used for mish. E.I.H. iii, 62, Bit azmish udammik, 'I built the temple grandly.' Porter's transcript of the same passage in the cursive character replaces by mish. Azmish may mean 'nolly,' from izmi which more than once replaces in the texts Rubu 'a nobleman': or 'strongly' from Heb. \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 fortis fuit: potens fuit: which is the root of izmi.\n\n352. Labbish. or adv. From the Heart. Heartily. From Heb. \u05d4\u05b7\u05dc 'the heart' (same in Arab. and Syr.).\n\nlabbish annadir 'I vowed from my heart,' Opp. Khors. l. 40. The verb annadir is the Heb. \u05e0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e8 nadar 'vovit.' Again, R 41, 54. I prayed to all the gods to give me victory. They heard my prayer, and came to my assistance. Then I vowed from my heart labbish annadir atribi-sha 'their sacrifices.'\u2014The vow of the King is, to increase the number or beauty of the victims offered to the gods. Atribi from \u05d0\u05b2\u05d8\u05b5\u05d1\u05b6\u05df esca, cibus. The gods were supposed to eat the altar-offerings.\n\n353. Nisakku. or more simply Nisak. The King's lieutenant. A Prince representing the King. Perhaps the Chald. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b8\u05e9\u05c1 'princeps,' but of this I am\nnot certain.\u2014In art. 287 of this glossary I translated the line *nisat nigut l\u00e1 eli-sun usakin*, \u2018a Chief of the assembly I did not impose on them.\u2019\u2014I was led to this translation by the context. The king did not wish to unduly influence the Assembly, or overawe its deliberations.\u2014I have since found the following confirmation. In 2R32, 7 *Nisakku* is explained *Nuab*. Now I have shown in No. 179 that *Nuab* meant a Viceroy or Vicegerent. The word remains in Arabic to the present day: \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0628 nuab \u2018lieutenant, substitute, viceroy, vicegerent,\u2019 Catafago\u2019s dict. p. 291.\n\n354. **Lisik.** \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 a Cell, a closed strong chamber.\u2014In B.M. 33, 16 Sargina restores an ancient Palace, and replaces its *timin* or sacred clay cylinder in a strong cell, which he fences round with large stones. *Eli pilu danni timmin-su kima Lisik sadi zakri asbuk.* Although I have only met with this word once, yet it agrees so very well with the Hebrew that I think it worth pointing out. Heb. \u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4 or \u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea Cella, conclave. plur. \u05db\u05b6\u05bc\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea. Often used in Hebrew for cells where treasure was kept. The LXX render it \u03b3\u03b1\u03b6\u03bf\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03c5.\n\n355. **Illat.** \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 Armed force, an Army. This is apparently the Heb. \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc Hil \u2018an army.\u2019 Yet it may possibly be the Heb. \u05d4\u05d9\u05dc \u2018force,\u2019 \u2018strength.\u2019\n\n*Upahir illat-zu* \u2018he collected his forces,\u2019 Opp. Eg. p. 77. The verb *pahir* or *pakhir* is especially used of assembling an army; whence *bu\u1e25ar* is \u2018an assembled army.\u2019\n\n*Uparriru illat-zu* \u2018I had destroyed his forces,\u2019 Sen. T. iii, 53. Same phrase in Opp. Eg. p. 78, but with the meaning \u2018they destroyed his forces. Similar expressions are *uparrir bu\u1e25ar-su*, Sen. T. iv, 42 and *uparrir kharranat-zun*, Bavian 39 (Norris 82). In fact *Bu\u1e25ar*, *Kharranat* and *Illat* all mean \u2018an army.\u2019\n\n356. **Nasik.** \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 a Prince. pl. Nasikkan \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 Chald. \u03a0\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03ba\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03c2 Princeps.\n\nIn R20, 24 a man named \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 \u3008\ud800\udfbc\u3009 is said to be *Nasik* of the land of Dagara, and that he revolted *itabalkat*. The other copy has simply *balkat*; the first seems a Hithpael form.\u2014In R42, 15\nwe read that the king of the Susians, and the kings of Babylon, and the princes (nasikkan) of Chald\u00e6a fled from the battle.\u2014See also No. 353.\n\n357. Rihu. a King or Governor. This word is explained in Syll. 345 by the monogram which is known to mean \u2018a King.\u2019\u2014The pronunciation of the monogram is also given as Siba, which can also be proved by various other texts.\u2014If is another form of the word (which is uncertain), Sargina calls himself Rihu sha sarrut mati kilallan ukinu, the king who wields the sovereignty of all nations. (Sarg. 31.) The plural appears to be Ri'eti. In B.M. 40, 52 the king commands to make for the adornment of his palace sacred bulls of stone, and zalmat ri'eti, statues of kings. But there is another form of the word Rihu much used, which appears to read Rihamu, Riham, or Rihum, just as we find indifferently written Rubu or Rubam, which is another term for \u2018a king.\u2019 The Assyrian form of Rihum or Rihu is Rihu kinu sha Ashur Marduk sarrut la-shanan usallimu-su, the glorious king to whom Ashur and Marduk have given an unequalled kingdom.\u2014Sarg. 3.\n\nThe Babylonian form is . In R51, 2 Nebuchadnezzar is called Riham kinu, &c. &c. The same phrase is found in R 52, 3 and R65, 2.\n\nIt will be observed that in the word Rihu the letters (usually bit) and (usually mal or bit) take the unusual sound of hu. This is said to be because mal, bit, and hu all signified \u2018a house\u2019 or . In fact, I find that Hu is \u2018a house\u2019 in all the Turkish family of languages.\n\nSince in this word has the value of U, which is generally expressed by (a nearly resembling form) it may be surmised that these forms were originally the same, and that ancient usage alone was the reason why was retained in this word.\n\nRihu is the Heb. Rex, but which originally meant Pastor gregis. So Homer calls a king \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03bb\u03b1\u1ff6\u03bd.\n358. **Rihut.** In the Senkereh inscription R51, 8, Marduk Shik ili, 'Chief of the gods;' mati u nisi ana rihiti iddina, 'has given the land and the people unto my governance.'\n\nBut in R65, 10 we find Marduk bil rabu 'Marduk the great Lord,' nisat rabsati ana rihiti itinam, 'has given the wide world into my governance.'\u2014Observe the two different ways in which iddina or itinam is spelt. The final M is merely emphatic.\n\n359. **Irtihu.** This verb has two different meanings, being used by the Assyrians to express the T conjugation both of 'to see' and 'to rule.' But this very circumstance gives it a great interest, for it illustrates both the acumen of Gesenius and the utility of the Assyrian language in explaining the Hebrew.\u2014Gesenius says, p. 942, \"I suspect that the verbs \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 and \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 had the same origin\u2014that of viewing or overlooking\"\u2014(suspicor ejusdem stirpis esse verba \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4 et propri\u00e8 adspiciendi vim habere). That such is the case appears very probable from the examples which I am about to adduce.\n\nIrtihu 'he rules,' from \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4. R15, 59 Ummanat Ashur kinish irtihu, Nobly did he reign over the loyal people of Ashur.\n\nIrtihu 'he beholds,' from \u05e8\u05d0\u05d4. Botta 169 l. penult. 'Men of all the lands whom the Sun beholds, I placed in my new City,' Nisi mati mal Shams irtihu This is repeated in more poetical language in Oppert's Sargon (folio edition, p. 20, l. 2) Bahilat arbahi lishan akhitu, admie la mitharti, asibut sadi u mati mal irtihu Bir Ili bil gimri, People of mingled foreign languages, men quite uncivilized, dwellers in all the hills and plains which the Light of the Gods the lord of the universe beholds. The same phrase is found without variation in p. 8 of the same book l. 103.\n360. **Aklu.** Wise. Prudent. Intelligent. This is the Arabic \u0639\u0627\u0642\u0644 akil, or \u0639\u0642\u0644 akli 'prudent,' 'wise,' &c., from \u0639\u0642\u0644 akl intellect, knowledge, prudence, wisdom, &c. Catafago's dict. 162: with whom Schindler agrees, who writes and transcribes the word \u0639\u0627\u0642\u0644 aqal, prudens, sapiens from \u0639\u0642\u0644 aql, 'mens,' &c. &c.\n\nThis word occurs frequently in the accounts of the Assyrian parliament or assembly of notables. Along with the men of rank, senators, &c., assembled in the king's palace, we always find mentioned \u0639\u0627\u0642\u0644 akli, Sapiri, the Wise men and the Learned men, who are sometimes described (ex. gr. Botta 51, 95) as mudut ini kala-ma knowing (or skilled) in arts of every kind.\n\n361. **Sapiru.** a Learned man. From the Heb. and Chald. scriba regius, \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2, librorum sacrorum peritus \u2014amicus regis qui ei ab epistolis est (the king's private secretary). Ges. which is from any book or writing, in Hebrew, and likewise in Assyrian, ex. gr. siprati 'letters,' Opp. Eg. p. 61, l. 5.\n\n362. **Khaip\u00e1.** Chiefs. Botta 75, 4. Arbaia rukuti, anibut mat bari sha aklu sapiru la idu, sha ana sar yamma bilat-zun la ishmama; 'Chiefs of the distant Arabians, inhabiting a savage land, which my wise men and my learned men knew nothing about; and who had paid tribute to no former king.'\n\n\u2014The word Khaipa for 'an Arabian Chief' is interesting, being still retained in the Arabic Kabba a King or Chief (Richardson's diet. p. 1112).\n\n363. **Kipi.** a Chief.\u2014Bellino l. 18, \"I received the tribute of Nebo-bil-mu Chief (Kipi) of Ararat.\"\u2014This chief's name may mean 'Nebo lord of names,' The plural is Kipani which is chiefly found in the account of Ashurbanipal's Egyptian wars.\n\n364. **Kaga.** Voice. Speech. Explained in Syll. 477 by the Assyrian Pi 'the voice,' which is the Heb. \u05e4\u05d4 or \u05e4\u05d9 the mouth. The shorter form Ka is\nmore frequently used. It has the same meaning, as appears from 2R8, 29 and also l. 31 where ka mu is translated pi-ya. In 2R10 the Assyrian iktabi \u2018he shall say,\u2019 or \u2018he shall speak,\u2019 is rendered in P.C. bannan ka he shall utter? speech (or voice).\n\n365. Kagasuni. They call it.\u2014A verb derived from Kaga \u2018speech\u2019 (Accad.) B.M.17, 6 In eli Til kamri sha Ar-khumut kagasuni Ar ebus, Ar Kar-Ashur mu-su abbi. \u201cOn the ruined Acropolis of what men call the New Town I built a city: Kar Ashur was the name I gave to it.\u201d Khumut means \u2018new.\u2019\u2014The old Acropolis being destroyed, probably in some former war, the inhabitants having rebuilt some of the houses below, naturally called it the New Town. Tiglath rebuilt the upper city or Acropolis and called it Kar-Ashur, \u201cAshur\u2019s fortress.\u201d\u2014Another account of this transaction is found in 2R67, 10. Instead of kagasuni we find igabbusuni \u2018they call it.\u2019 This verb explains the other: There is a third account but greatly mutilated in B.M.52, 1, which evidently had igabbusuni, and after Kar Ashur mu-su abbi, it adds isku Ashur bil-ya in libbi ar-sib the religion of Ashur my lord in it I established. Arzib seems connected with Arzip \u2018I raised up.\u2019\n\nThe verb kagasuni clearly shows that the P.C. kaga \u2018speech\u2019 was commonly used in Assyrian. The ancient language of the early Chaldeans died out slowly, and many of its words remained in use for a long period.\n\n366. Id or It. The Hand. This word is the same in all three languages, P.C., Assyrian, and Hebrew. In the latter it is. I have already given an example of the P.C. word in No. 47, It zida mu, in my right hand. The word It also means \u2018side,\u2019 that is \u2018direction.\u2019 In tablet K 50 there are five carefully written lines, the first of which begins \u2018on the side of the South.\u2019 The three next lines begin respectively \u2018on the side of the North\u2019\u2014\u2018East\u2019\u2014\u2018West.\u2019 After which comes another line It im arba \u2018on all four sides,\u2019 or \u2018in the direction of each of the four cardinal points.\u2019 This last\nexpression is found in col. 1 of the Senkerch inscription (R51, 20) where the king says that former persons had made searches im arba \u2018in all the four directions,\u2019 and had turned up the very foundations of the temple in order to find the clay tablets (ussurati). Very similar to this statement is that which I have quoted in No. 46, \u2018They dug right and left, before and behind.\u2019\n\n367. Sar. a Song or Hymn to the gods. Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc, as in the well-known \u2018Song of Solomon\u2019 or \u2018Song of Songs\u2019 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc. Plural \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc or else by reduplication \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc Sar Sar.\n\nIn tablet K48 it is said \u2018On the West side\u2019 (i.e. of the Library) \u2018there are nine songs.\u2019 These are then all specified in order. The first is to Ashur, called which I believe meant \u2018the good god\u2019 (often stands for \u2018good\u2019). Then follow the names or titles of eight other gods. The four last are Bil sha hukma, Lord of knowledge; and Nin sha hukma Lady of knowledge: and after them the Lord and Lady and of which is Accadian and unknown to me. In another part of the tablet there was a much longer statement, but it is defaced. There remains however a recapitulation in one line \u201cAltogether, fifteen songs on the East side.\u201d One of the songs (the second) was to the Lord of mikhira and I rather think it is preserved. For, the reverse of the tablet begins Suan bil mikhira bil kiti, Ode to the Lord of Heaven? and Lord of Earth.\u2014This passage identifies the meaning of the very common Accadian word Suan \u2018an Ode\u2019 with Sar \u2018a Song.\u2019\n\n368. Ailu. a Stag or Deer. Heb. cervus. Occurs in a list of animals 2 R6, 11. Also in R28, 20 we find, \u201che caught in hunter\u2019s toils (tsadirati) many armi, turakhi, nali, and ailu, spelt\n369. Urku. \u00dcr\u00fcn. a Dog. Not found in Hebrew, which employs the word Kaleb.\u2014In a list of animals 2R6, 13 (quoted by Norris p. 511) we find the Assyrian Kalbu rendered in P.C. Urku. But the first syllable being broken off, this example is inconclusive. The next line has miranu \u2018the young of any animal,\u2019 and the P.C. has tur \u2018young,\u2019 the rest being broken off. Then comes Kaleb Elamti, a dog of Elm or Susiana, spelt Kaleb; and Kaleb Parsi, a dog of Persia. This name is very uncommon. Next follows Kaleb mie, kaleb urtsi \u2018a water dog,\u2019 and an earth dog, i.e. terrier.\u2014\u2018water\u2019 is the usual spelling, but for \u2018earth\u2019 Heb. is unusual, and perhaps the word has not that meaning. Lower down the column we find the interesting word Sagu \u2018the Sagu dog.\u2019 This is the Persian word Sag \u2018a dog.\u2019 Then we have P.C. \u2018a wicked dog,\u2019 and zaidu, perhaps \u2018a hunting dog\u2019 Heb. zid \u2018venator\u2019 a hunter. Next comes Kaleb illati (meaning uncertain), and Kalbata \u2018a female dog.\u2019 Elsewhere natru \u2018a watch dog,\u2019 from Heb. natar \u2018to watch,\u2019 custodivit, and nadhirta, probably \u2018a female watch dog.\u2019\u2014In line 33 we have munasikta, or rather munasikat \u2018a biter;\u2019 feminine, from masc. munasik: Heb. \u05e9\u05c2\u05d5\u05d7 \u2018to bite.\u2019 This epithet of a dog was known to us before. Several small clay models of dogs are in the British Museum. They have all got names. One of them is Munasik garisu \u2018Biter of his enemies.\u2019 I will return to this little inscription further on.\n\nTablet K 236 has 20 lines, each of which commences with the word \u2018dogs,\u2019 followed by a short sentence, different in each line, but for the most part hard to decipher.

They are examples of the curious Assyrian tan conjugation, which had an intensive force. I have mentioned the little models of dogs; one of these is named \u0e21\u05b5\u05d3\u05b8\u05d0 \u05e7\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d5 \u05d2\u05b7\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05d7\u05b2\u05d5 \u05de\u05b5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05d6 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 'he that barks at evil doers.' The verb shazzu or shatza is used for 'clamare,' to make a loud noise of any kind. I should not be surprised if the verb istanazzu, which as I have said, occurs three times on this tablet, were the tan conjugation of shaaza. In that case it may mean 'they barked loudly, or often.'\n\nAs to the verb ibtanakhura it may be the tan conjugation of that verb of which ibkhura 'they assembled' is the simple form. Bukhur 'an assemblage or troop,' is a frequent word. Hence I would render line 3 'the dogs assembled in troops and barked loudly.' The two verbs are thus written in the original, \u05de\u05b5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05d6 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05e0\u05b7\u05df \u05d0\u05b2\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05b4\u05d9.\n\nAnother of the model dogs is called \u05de\u05b5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b5\u05d6 \u05e0\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05ea\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05dc\u05b6\u05d0 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05e0\u05b7\u05df \u05d0\u05b2\u05e4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d4 \u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05b4\u05d9 Kasid aihi 'Conqueror of his enemies.'

From the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 'firmiter adhesisit,' an interesting verb, since from it is formed the name of Hezekiah \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 \u05d0\u05b6\u05ea\u05be\u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 'the firm\nadherent of Jehovah,' \u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9 or \u05d9\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9; a name which in those days when so many kings of Judah had lapsed into idolatry, was more than usually impressive. It may also be rendered 'he who cleaves to Jehovah.'\n\nIn 2 R 38, 35 the following passage occurs\u2014I have denoted the lines by numbers.\u2014(1 to 6) Marduk ana supti-su usari(ma). Kisek turi ummani sunuti (7) ka, du, bit, ekil, u khar, (8, 9, 10) ana Marduk u Zarpanita uzakki sunuti. i.e. (1 to 6) \"I brought Marduk into his new Temple [or, raised him on his Throne]. A band of Youths who were to be his faithful adherents, (7) at the gate\u2014on the road\u2014in the house\u2014in the field\u2014in the forest, (8, 9, 10) unto Marduk and Zarpanita I bound them firmly.\" Line 7 means, of course, 'always and everywhere,' I bound them to this service\u2014A band of devotees. I think I have seen the same form of oath in modern times, as taken by some religious brotherhoods, to be faithful to their Order on all occasions, or under every trial. The form of line 7, consisting of five short words, is precisely like what I have quoted in No. 222 from 2 R 13, 28. Bit, ekil, khar, ardu, shallat. Indeed three of the words happen to be the same as in that line. But there is a little uncertainty about line 7. Ka may be 'speech;' du often means 'to walk, or go,' but is sometimes short for duruk 'a road.' Khar is short for kharri\u0161 'a forest,' which is sometimes written at length. Line 7 may therefore mean 'in speaking\u2014in walking\u2014at home\u2014in field or forest,' they devote themselves to the service of their god.\n\nSupti 'a dwelling' or 'a seat, or throne' is spelt \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 as in several other passages.

Zakhar, adj. White.\u2014Written in the oblique case \nor (I have not met with the nominative). Agrees entirely with the Heb. albus.\u2014In 2 R 7 E Sennacherib speaks of the white alabaster which he met with in the mountains of Nypur, apparently in his fifth campaign, when he passed through those mountains, see R 39, 69 . He caused bas reliefs, (shallut zavati) to be carved of this beautiful stone, and sent them to Niniveh. The stone is named which seems connected with the \u0391\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd of the Greeks, since may have had the sound of al, allah, or alu, and may have sounded ash-tar. However this may be, the passage is curious.\n\n(stone) (alabaster) (which) (like) (white flour of wheat) [or in the other copy salu-su] (its flour, i.e. white powder or dust) nuzuku (shone or glittered). That is to say, 'Alabaster stone, whose white dust glittered like white flour.'\u2014Alabaster was perhaps at that time a novelty to the king. We may imagine him viewing with interest the progress of his sculptors, and the tables in the workshops covered with the white powder fallen from the stones. He was struck by its resemblance to flour, which is the case with no other stone used in sculpture unless perhaps Parian marble.\n\nis the flour of wheat, see Tig. vi, 103. Norris 721. Salu is the Chald. or farina, otherwise written Sch. 1224. Buxt. 1493. I know not how was pronounced, but if Sim it resembles the Latin simila, Gr. \u03c3\u03b5\u03bc\u03af\u03b4\u03b1-\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2, Chald. Arab. simid or semid, 'the finest flour of wheat,'\u2014Sch. 1225. Buxt. 1495.\n\nAlabaster is the same substance (chemically speaking) as gypsum and plaster of Paris (sulphate of lime); and every one knows how great is the resemblance, externally, of plaster of Paris to the whitest flour.\nThere is a curious passage in this same inscription, which says \"This stone he himself [the King] chose carefully in the mountains of Nypur: \u03bd\u03b1\u03c0 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1. From Ch. and Syr. da-nu-si, in another conjugation u-d-n-a, solicitus fuit; vel, attentus, studiosus fuit (Schindler).\n\n376. Nu-zuk. verb, to be White, Bright, or Shining. (may also be written nu-zuk or nutzuk). This is the Syriac \u03bd\u03b1\u03c0 \u1f11\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. The derived adjective \u03bd\u03b1\u03c0 \u1f00\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03c2 means (1) purus, (2) \u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2, splendens, albicans, ex gr. as an epithet of a star: or of pellucid sparkling water: or of white linen or byssus. Castelli 563. Schaaf's lex. gives a similar account of the word.\n\nHence, precious stones in general are called Nisikti stones in Assyrian, see my No. 170, corrected by No. 250. Nisikta occurs in Syriac as a fem. plural \u1f19\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c3\u03c9, see Schaaf p. 357.\n\nExamples of the verb nuzuk. Tig. vii, 95 describes the building of a Bit illat or 'apartment of splendour' of which the internal walls \"mahatish nutsuku, were very bright or glistening\u2014by the effect of the sculptor's chisel.\" They were therefore probably of white marble.\n\nIn R 7 E we find: Shalu-su nutsuku, 'its powder was shining white' (see these passages more fully given in Nos. 371 and 375).\n\nAnother interesting example of the word is found in B.M. 40, 5, where Sennacherib says 'I made shallat ruzati (bas reliefs) of the stone called itsir rabu \u2014\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1 \"sha zimi nutsuku kima tami, 'of which the broken pieces, or chips, were white and glistening like the day (or sky)', .......... kilallan in shaddi-sun aduk, ana sipri hekali-ya usalida kireb ir Nin\u00e1, 'all of them I sculptured in their own mountains, and for the embellishment of my palace I had them carried to Niniveh'.\u2014It is evident how close this statement is to that in R 7 E quoted in No. 375; extending even to the fact that Sennacherib had the slabs of stone sculptured on the spot where they were quarried.\nin the mountains, (probably those of Nypur); and to the remarkable whiteness of the chips or fragments. The two passages therefore confirm and explain each other. The *itsir rabu* may be 'white marble,' for two reasons, first because the name seems cognate with the verb *usatsir* which is always employed in the sense of skilful or artistic work, and is a causative conjugation of the Heb. finxit, formavit; secondly because of its having bright white fragments, a character which few other stones possess.\n\n*Zimi* Chald. rejectamenta here probably 'chips' or 'fragments' left by the sculptors. *Abduk*, from the verb *patak* or *pitik* 'to sculpture,' which occurs very frequently. This word has been skilfully restored by Mr. Norris p. 848.\n\n377. *Naru.* , a Tablet, usually made of stone. This word is seldom employed; the usual term for a stone tablet being the Accadian of which the pronunciation is uncertain. But the word *Naru* is used on some of the Michaux stones, and in the tablet K 240, which contains an instructive list of words synonymous with 'a tablet.' We find, besides , , , , and , ; Sikkatu and Masuktu (which two last appear related to each other). Also two curious words denoting a sepulchral stone or monument, , , Abna abi bani 'monument of a Father,' and , , Abna makhritu 'monument of the departed.' This word makhritu is often used in Assyrian for 'the late,' 'the deceased,' just as the Greeks use \u1f41 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 in speaking of a person very recently dead. Indeed I think the Greek word is borrowed from the Assyrian, although the Greeks themselves doubtless assimilated it to their own language, and derived it from \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 'blessed'. This tablet gives some other synonyms for a 'monumental stone' viz., , erimmatu (this may possibly be Heb. 'a heap or mound,' which is the Eppa of the Greeks). Also, Kapirru Heb. 'sepulcrum'; Matsabu Heb. matsaba\n'cippest,' a sepulchral monument; and finally, \u30a2\u53d9\u8ff0 Anatu, which may mean 'stone of sorrow' or 'sorrowful memorial,' from Heb. \u05e0\u05b4\u05a4\u05d9\u05dd to mourn or lament.\n\n\u00b6 Examples of the P.C., or Accadian word Tig. viii, 68. Sha bit-ellan ashar la mari pisirish inakimu, 'he who shall hide my tablets contemptuously in some back building, in a place where they cannot be seen'\u2014\n\nillan 'behind.' Pisirish from Ch. and Syr. \u05d0\u05b1\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9 supsavit, contempsit, neglexit\u2014Inakimu 'shall hide,' from nakam; (hence Bit nakimmat, or nakamti, a room shut up; a treasury).\n\nThe following example is found in 1 Mich. iv, 21 (R pl. 70), 'May the great gods whose names are written in this tablet, curse him with a curse which cannot be removed!' Ili rab\u00ee, mala in nari anni mu-sun zakru, arrat la napsuri liruru su!\n\nMala 'whosoever.' Zakru 'are written;' from \u05d9\u05b7\u05e2 in Assyrian 'to write,' but in Hebrew 'to record.' Nari is substituted in 3 Mich. for in this passage.\n\n\u00b6 It is uncertain how the word was pronounced, but probably Nad\u00e2. For one of the values of is da (see Norris p. vii and p. 268, quoting Sard. i, 25 dar\u00eesh 'for ever.') Moreover in tablet K 240, already mentioned, next to Nad\u00e2, stands Nad\u00e2; and\n\n\u00b0 \u0646 \u0633 \u0645 \u0646 \u0639 \u064a \u0631 \u0644 \u062a \u0646 y Constr. 4 Nuru. (\u0646 \u0633 \u0645 \u0646 \u0639 \u064a \u0631 \u0644 \u062a \u0646 y or \u0646 \u0633 \u0645 \u0646 \u0639 \u064a \u0631 \u0644 \u062a \u0646 y a Tablet. (seemingly a variation of the last word).\u2014Tig. vi, 15 describes how the city of Khunutsa was taken and destroyed. The whole city was burnt. The Citadel with its three great towers of brick was thrown down, burnt, and reduced to ruins and rubbish. The very site of the city was obliterated, by heaps of stones thrown over it. The account then continues as follows : Nuru takabar ebus, kisiti mati sha in Ya bil-ya aksudu. Ir suatu ana la zabati, u Dur-su la razapi in eli althur: bit sha agamri in eli-su urzip, naru takabar sa-atun in libbi usasi'b\u2014'I made tablets\nof bronze, obtained in the lands which in the name of Jah my lord I had conquered. I displayed upon them that city [Khunutsa] as it was before it was taken; and its Citadel, as it was before it was burnt. Then I erected a building of brick, and those tablets of bronze I placed therein. In this passage Razapi, is the Chald. 'to burn;' subst. 'coals of fire.'\n\nAnother example is found in Opp. Khors. line 135\u2014Nuru ekili-sun, sha ultu tami ulluti in isiti mitti Zuti ekim\u00fb, ramanasssun utirru; 'the tablets [i.e. landmarks] of their fields, which a long while ago from many estates the Zuti had carried off, I restored to themselves [i.e. the right owners]. These Nuru or landmarks were a sort of title deeds, showing to every passer by to what family a field belonged. The Zuti appear to have been a tribe of savage warriors, allies of Merodach Baladan. They were all put to death by Sargina. Isiti estates, holdings, possessions; from isa to have or possess. Ekim\u00fb, observe the lengthened vowel which marks the pluperfect tense, 'they had seized (a long time ago). So in the first example of this article, aksud is 'I acquired or took,' but aksudu (pluperf.) 'I had acquired' (some time before).\n\n379. Liki. verb 'to Receive.' Heb. \u05dc\u05b4\u05e7\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 'cepit, accepit,' etiam 'cepit auribus; percepit.' Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03c9. In 2 R 66, 7 the goddess Beltis has the following epithets: Samat ikribi, likat unnini; 'She who hears our prayers, and receives our supplications.' Here is the feminine participle. This example is fully confirmed by another taken from the tablet 120 otherwise 89b where Ashurbanipal addresses Marduk . Liki unnini-ya. Simi kala-ya; Receive my prayers! Hear my voice!\n\nSimi is the Heb. \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05de\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 'to hear:' its participle feminine is samat 'she who hears,' auditrix (see the first example)\u2014Kala 'voice' is evidently the Chald. \u05e7\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d4 Heb. \u05e7\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d4 'voice.' I do not recollect however to have met the word elsewhere.\n380. Zitta. Oil. (Lat. Oleum. Oliva). Heb. Zit Syr. Zita, and the same in all the Semitic languages. I have only found the word hitherto in the name of the city Bit-Zitta, 'the City of Olives' which is mentioned as one of those captured by Sennacherib on the seacoast of Palestine R 38, 39.\n\n381. Suman or Summanu. Butter. The same with the Chald. Butyrum; Arab. \u0633\u0645\u0646 and \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0646 (Schindler). This appears to me to be the meaning of the gloss in 2 R 7, 29 \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0646 \u0634\u0627 \u063a\u0627, 'butter of the Cow.' All this column consists of words beginning with SM therefore I read sumannu or summanu. \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0646 is a term for unctuous substances in general, as grease, fat, oil, unguent, &c. Hence for distinction's sake the Arabic expresses 'butter' by \u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u0646 \u0628\u0643\u0631\u064a 'butyrum de vacc\u00e2.' (Sch.)\n\n382. Bara. adj. Fat. Heb. pinguis, ex gr. decem boves pingues 1 Kings iv, 23. But the word may equally well be read \u05de\u05e8\u05d0 (which Norris prefers, p. 847) for, the Hebrew is also written \u05de\u05d9\u05e8\u05d0, which is a good example of the connexion between the letters B and M.\n\nPhill. i, 16. Sha tamu I ga makhi bara. 'Every day one ox, large and fat, and one other ox (&c. &c.) I allotted to the gods of Babylon as their portion.' This has much resemblance to what we read in 1 Kings iv, 23\u2014'Solomon's provision for one day was ten fat oxen and twenty other oxen,' (&c. &c.)\n\n383. Pattaruna. adj. Fat. Agrees well with the Heb. Padar 'fat;' the final N augmenting the meaning, as in many other words.\n\nEsar. iii, 59. Ga makkhi pattaruna, 'oxen large and fat.' This was part of the tribute of Bel-basa king of Gambuli, whom Esarhaddon thereupon confirmed in his kingdom, and having made his capital city Shapi-Bel into a strong fortress, commissioned him to watch the frontier of Elam.\n\n384. Paklut. adj. Fat.\n\nGa makhe pakluti, 'oxen large and fat' Phill. iii, 9. I know not whether the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2 is related.\n385. **La**. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 a Bull or Ox.\u20142 R 25, 7 explains La by **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 Allou \u2018bull\u2019 Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 (Gloss. No. 298). Also I find on a tablet the Accadian Ga kim \u2018like a bull\u2019 rendered by the Assyrian kinu Lie. Moreover the sacred images of bulls are often called **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 Lu shaddi. And see Norris p. 855 where they are called in one copy Lu shaddi and in the other **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9. This last is explained by **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 shaedu (good spirit or genius) in Norris p. 32. Hence I think that lu shaddi is but another form of lu shaedi divine bulla.\n\n386. **Suru.** **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 a Bull. Agrees with the Heb. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** Sur \u2018a bull.\u2019 In 2 R 25, 8 we find the explanation **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 i.e. Suru means Albu (a bull).\n\nAnother example, from Sen. T. v, 74. (Norris p. 867) Kima suri maruti \u2018like fattened oxen\u2019 **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9. This occurs in the account of the battle of Khaluli. The Chiefs of the Enemy, wearing collars of gold and swords with golden sheaths, appeared to Sennacherib an easy prey, and a tempting booty, just as the capture might be of a herd of fat beoves, offering no resistance.\n\n387. **Kurutz.** **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 A piece cut off\u2014a joint\u2014a morsel. Exactly the Chald. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** kurutz \u2018frustum\u2019: which occurs in Daniel iii, 8 and vi, 25 **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 comedit frusta (Ges.): and the same phrase is found in Syriac.\n\nNibritu izbat-zunuti. Ana buri-sun seri abli-sun binti-sun ekilu, ikzutzu kurutzu. A Famine seized them. For food they ate the limbs of their sons and daughters, and cut them up into morsels. Smith\u2019s Assurbanipal* p. 163. Ikzutzu is from the Heb. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** amputavit, abscedit, dissecut.\n\n388. **Buru.** **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 Food. Heb. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u2018cibus,\u2019 from **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u2018comedit,\u2019 er. gr. **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd** \u2018to eat bread.\u2019 Gesenius thinks this Hebrew word cognate with Bopa and vorare. Add the Germ. Brad, which closely resembles **\u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b9\u05d4\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd**, and the Welsh Bara \u2018bread.\u2019 An example of the word Buru will be found in\n\n* Quotations from this new work will usually be denoted by the abbreviation Assur.\nthe last article. Another occurs in Smith's Assurbanipal p. 193 in the narrative of a shipwreck, ana buri-sun, 'for their food' [the following words are lost].\n\n389. Lu, a Table. Heb. Luh Tabula. Lu as libbi ekulu ishtu, the table at which he used to eat and drink. Assur. p. 227.\n\n390. Maskita. Wine mixed with Spices. In Hebrew Psalm 75, 9\u2014Gesenius says 'vinum mixtum, i.e. aromatibus.'\u2014See also Proverbs ix, 2. Isaiah v, 22. Kurun maskita sha Sar: spiced wine for the king. 2 R 44, 10.\n\n391. Kurun. Wine. Often replaced by the monogram . Seems related to the Heb. a Vine, or Vineyard.\n\nAkul akalu, siti kurunnu! eat food, drink wine! Assur. 125 translated by Mr. G. Smith. In R 7 No. ix A the king is represented pouring a libation upon four dead lions before an altar and the inscription says: Kurun akk\u00e1 eli-sun, I poured a libation of wine upon them. Kurun is written , akk\u00e1 from the Heb. 'libavit.'\u2014 water and wine' 2 R 44, 8; opposite which is written which may be kasim 'goblets' Heb.\u2014Same page l. 13 followed by kharrubu, may be flasks or skins of wine. Ch. uter, lagena vini.\n\nThe sign for 'wood' or 'vegetable' is sometimes prefixed ex gr. Oppert's Sargon folio p. 16 in the description of a famine. \"The poor people could get no food: Ina zabal karani akula ana khareu, with the skins (or dregs) of grapes (they found) food for their bellies.\" refuse; food; belly. I have supplied the letter which seems wanting after akula. But the meaning of the passage and even its reading, is uncertain.\n\nSometimes are tangled creepers Anglic\u00e8 Bines, F. Lianes.\u2014See Assur. 267 in the account of Assurbanipal's army struggling through a forest, and impeded by\nperhaps thorns or brambles for I find in 2 R 45, 59. this word, or \nwhich is equivalent to it (putting the Accadian plural ra instead of the Assyrian) explained by akhartannu or akhartan probably 'thorns' from the Syriac a sharp point, and when used as a verb 'to pierce.'\n\nIn Bavian 19 we read that Sennacherib planted near Niniveh Woods and Vineyards.\n\nThe monogram is explained karana in 2 R 45, 58 and also in Syl. 173.\n\n392. Azzari. a Bird. This is the same as izzuri 'a bird' (Gloss. No. 10): but so distinct a form deserves to be mentioned. Kima azzari edish ipparesid, like a bird he fled away alone. R 39, 48.\n\n393. Atalu. an Eclipse. Syriac shadow. In 3 R 58 No. 8 l. ult. the usual symbol for an eclipse (divine darkness) is explained by the gloss Atalu.\n\n394. Mi. Night. Five days and nights\u20143 R 12, slab ii, 30. Day and night. 2 R 32, 4. See more examples under Zalmu No. 396 and Mi No. 268.\n\n395. Takhatu. Night. (see Gloss. No. 26.) Another example of this word is found in 3 R 55, 50 \"Offer a sacrifice (likruth) to the god Yem and Ishtar in the night time, as takhati.\u2014In 3 R 66 Yom, Ishtar, and other gods are sacrificed to by starlight, (reverse col. 1, 13) and by moonlight (obverse col. 5, 25).\n\n396. Zalmu. Darkness. This is exactly the Arabic zalm 'dark' otherwise zal\u0101m (in Catafago p. 433).\u2014In 3 R 59, No. 7 and No. 9 (darkness) is twice explained by zalmu, and in 2 R 49, 42 by zalmi. The Hebrew equivalent is 'umbra' Psalm xxxix, 7 (the original root is)\u2014(Gesenius says that imago is the same word; because an imago is the \u03c3\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1 of the object.\n\nIn 2 R 37, 30 a bird (probably the Owl) is called Itsur musi\nASSYRIAN LANGUAGE.\n\n(bird of night) and also zulamu, and zalamdu. These two words are evidently derived from zalam or zalmu darkness.\n\n397. Kil. Sand. See the account of the shipwreck of Tammaritu king of Elam in Assur. p. 192. \"The ship of Tammaritu was caught by a terrible tempest. The steersman of the ship leaped from the ship upon the sand. Tammaritu following after him was thrown, on the dangerous rocky ground, and very much injured.\"\n\nThe last two clauses stand thus in the original. Sikudi abati the steersman of the ship, sul leaped, ultu kireb elip suatu from out of that ship, ana kili upon the sand. Tammaritu ana arka su after him, issi was thrown. Marustu haggar namratsi the dangerous stony ground, uparriru's much wounded him.\n\nHere we have sikudi 'the watchman' from Heb. to watch or keep guard. I translate it however 'the steersman,' according to the lines of \u00c6schylus (Sept. c. Theb. l. 3) \u039f\u1f30\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd\u2014\u03b2\u03bb\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b7 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd \u1f51\u03c0\u03bd\u03c9 'the ever-watching or ever-watchful steersman'\u2014abati 'the ship.' This is a most interesting word, because it occurs once, and once only, in the Old Testament, being in all probability the of Job ix, 26 where the commentators disagree exceedingly as to its meaning (except that it is a ship of some kind). It is therefore very satisfactory to find it in Assyrian.\n\nSul 'he leaped' is the Ch. and Syr. 'cum impetu cucurrit.' Kilu 'the sand' agrees entirely with the Chald. and Heb. 'arena in litore maris.'\n\n398. Urku, a Dog. Some further examples may be added to those contained in No. 369. Assur. p. 166 \"I caused their flesh to be eaten by dogs, usakil kalbi (or urki)\u2014Usakil is the S conjugation of akal 'to eat' Heb. Again in the next page 'I threw their bodies as food to the dogs' rihit kalbi (or urki). Rihit 'food' from Heb. to feed.\n\nIn 2 R 42, 67 there is a gloss which identifies the meaning of urku with the Heb. kaleb. For, is there\nexplained by lishan kalbi the tongue of a dog. In the preceding line the Accadian voice or mouth, takes the place of lishan. Moreover, if we can trust these glosses, one of the synonyms of Urku was Tsir. This, if true, is curious, because I have shown in Art. No. 108 of this glossary that the Assyrian mythology possessed (no doubt in Hades) a seven-headed monster called a Tsir, and therefore it was probably a seven-headed dog, a sort of Cerberus.\n\nIn 3 R 65, No. 2 reverse, urmakh and urku (lion and dog) are repeatedly mentioned together. This tablet relates dreams of some portentous births; such as (1) having the head of a lion or dog (2) altogether like a lion or dog (kilullan kima like, urmakh a lion).\n\nIn tablet K 217 there is a list of urku \u2018dogs\u2019 and ur shal which I suppose means \u2018female dogs,\u2019 but this is uncertain.\n\n399. Kun. otherwise a Tail. 2 R 34, 21\n\nKun sha kalbi, \u2018tail of a dog,\u2019\n\nKunut-zun \u2018their tails\u2019 occurs in the tablet about dogs and lions 3 R 65 No. 2 reverse line 64, which also speaks of \u2018their heads,\u2019 \u2018their faces,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\nI have already noticed in a former article, that in the dog tablet K 236 kunut-zun \u2018their tails\u2019 occurs twice, written and the passage in the hunting scene, Urmakh as kun azbat \u201cI seized the Lion by his tail,\u201d where the sculpture confirms the inscription.\n\nI will add a very different example of the word, viz. the Assyrian description of a Comet. \u201cStar which has before it a corona or glory (tsipra Heb. \u2018corona caput ambiens\u2019) and behind it a tail.\u201d 3 R 52, 55, this curious passage has been noted by Sir H. Rawlinson and Mr. G. Smith. The original words are Kakkab sha as pan-su tsipra, as arka-su kun.\n\nIn 2 R 20, 41 we find Nuzur sha kun, which apparently means \u2018wagging the tail\u2019 from Hebrew.\n400. **Khuraza.** \u91d1 Gold. Heb. \u05d6\u05d4\u05d1. A different spelling of the word has been given already in No. 29.\n\n(\u91d1) is translated on a tablet Khuraza russ\u00e1.\n\n401. **Anak.** Lead. Agrees exactly with the Heb. Anak \u94c5 plumbum. In an \"Ode to Fire\" I find: \"Thou, O Fire, art the melter of bronze and lead.\" Sha eri u anaki mubullil-sun atta! Written \u91d1 and \u91d1. Mubullil is the participle of bullul to melt, Heb \u91d1 fudit.\n\n402. **Anna.** \u94f6 Lead. This is the Accadian word which translates the Assyrian Anak in the preceding passage. It occurs very frequently, even in Assyrian writings, while Anak is seldom found.\n\n403. **Nazir.** \u91d1 a Royal Crown. Agrees exactly with the Heb. \u05e0\u05d6\u05e8 which Gesenius renders Diadema: specialiter regis. I find on a tablet nazir rabu rendered in Accadian \u91d1 mir rabu, which means as we know 'a great crown,' see the art. Mir No. 156. It is added that this nazir was worn 'on his head,' as risi-su \u91d1 I.\n\nSaul wore his nazir on his head in battle. 2 Sam. i, 10.\n\n404. **Amia.** \u91d1 a Crown (in Accadian). In 2 R 24, 60 and also 32, 13 we have \u91d1 rendered by the Assyrian \u91d1 Ag\u00fa, 'a crown.' And on the tablets amia-kim is frequently rendered kima agie, \u91d1 being the plural of Ag\u00fa.\n\n405. **Karpa.** \u91d1 a water-vessel or flaggon. Same as the Syriac garba \u91d1 Chald. \u91d1 uter, lagena, hydria. Compare also the Greek \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03c0\u03ae\u03c2 used by Homer and Pindar for a water-vessel or pitcher. The Accadian word corresponding is \u91d1 Duk, perhaps connected with the Greek \u03a4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03cc\u03c2 a vessel or urn.\n\nMie sunuti ana karpati tar-ma, return those waters into the pitcher! (Tablet.)\n\nAnd I find among the curses, two consecutive lines: \"May they pour him out like water: may they break him like the pitcher!\" The Accadian words are \u91d1 A-kim, and \u91d1 Duk-kim; the Assyrian kima mie and kima karpati.\nBut the word \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 or karpa is sometimes used for a very costly vessel, apparently one employed in the Mysteries, as in the following two lines, of which the first only has been published by Mr. G. Smith in his Assurbanipal, p. 332.\n\nAs passuri illiti, akalu illiti akul!\nAs karpati \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 illiti, mie illiti siti!\nEat the precious food, out of a precious dish!\nDrink the precious drink, out of a precious vessel!\n\nAn epithet \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 whose meaning is at present unknown, is here given to the vessel.\n\n406. Immiri. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Sheep or Lambs. Chald. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Agnus; which makes in the plural \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. I think there can be no doubt of this word. An Accadian tablet has, in two consecutive lines,\n\nGa kim 'like oxen': translated kima Alpi.\nLu kim 'like sheep': translated kima Immiri.\n\nSome have rendered Immiri by 'asses,' supposing it to be the Heb. \ufffd\ufffd, but this is quite unsuitable. In Phill. iii, 12, 'fat oxen' are sacrificed, and immediately afterwards immir gukallam, probably 'fat sheep.' So also in 2 R 38, 30 kub\u00fa alpi 'a drove of oxen' stands next to kub\u00fa imiri 'a flock of sheep.'\n\nThe following is another example of the word. Kima immiri itbukh-su, 'it slays him like a sheep.' The verb \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 itbukh is the Heb. \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05d1\u05b0\u05e2\u05b5\u05d4 'mactavit pecudem.'\n\n407. Suhi. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Lambs. Heb. \u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d9 ovis, vel agnus. In Opp. Khors. 19 l. ult. suhi maruti (fat lambs) are offered to the gods at a festival, along with ga makhi bitruti (fattened oxon).\n\n408. Huk. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 a Flock. 2 R 38, 26 where it is explained by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Kal\u00fa a drove or flock. The word is commonly written \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 as in my art. 304, but I now think this is a compound word, \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 'flock,' \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 'sheep,' \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 'many':\u2014'Large flocks of sheep.'\n409. **Maruti.** Fat. Heb. pinguis, saginatus. *Suh\u00ee maruti* 'fat lambs'; *Suri maruti* 'fat oxen.' Sen. T. v. 74. Layard's Inscriptions, 34, 1.\n\n410. **Bitruti.** Fat. *Ga makkhi bitruti*, fine fat oxen. XVI pasilli bitruti, sixteen fat (\u2026) Phill. ii, 27, and Opp. Khors. 19 l. ult. These were offered in the temple every day.\n\n411. **Dussuti.** Fat. Probably from the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05df to be fat. *dussuti* \u2026 lu-akki, fat sheep I sacrificed. Bavian 33, quoted by Norris Dict. p. 639.\n\n412. **Bunnanni.** Statues. A very common word, used in such phrases as \"Whoever destroys my bunnanni, let him be accursed!\" The meaning is ascertained by a tablet, which translates bunnanni and zalam by the same word. The latter is the Heb. \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4 a statue.\n\n413. **Ekal**, or **Hekal.** a Palace: the Hebrew \u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0. This word is very seldom found phonetically written: it is generally expressed by \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 which means 'the Great House.' In Assyrian this would sound Bit Rab, but in Accadian He-kal, from He 'house' and Kal or Gal 'great.' In ancient Egyptian also He signified 'a house.' The Turkish family of languages in general have Hu. Hence we see that the cuneiform texts give us a clear and simple etymology of the Hebrew \u05d3\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05da\u05b0, respecting which there is nothing satisfactory in the lexicons.\n\nExample: \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 this means \"at the gate of the temple\"; and immediately afterwards it is phonetically written \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 as bab Ekalli.\n\n414. **Bu.** the Mouth. This word is given by Norris (Dict. p. 63) quoting 39 II where it is explained by the Accadian Ka 'the mouth' a very common word. He adds that it is the Heb. \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e2\u05b5\u05df the mouth. But as he adduces no example I will give one from a tablet, which says of the waters of the Euphrates Bu illu sha Bit-a ullil sunuti, \"the grand mouth of\nKakku, or Kak. \n\nA sword. Perhaps connected with the Heb. root \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b5\u05dd 'to cut.' Occurs rather frequently. Expressed in Assyrian by \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b5\u05dd (see my No. 392). But since the sign \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b5\u05dd determinative of wooden objects seems unsuitable, I conjecture that \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d4\u05b5\u05dd is a very ancient\ncorruption of the Accadian kak obtained by removing the vertical wedge a little towards the right hand. Example: \"The god (....) lord of the sword, will never give him his sword of strength, upon the battle field.\" This stands thus in Assyrian: Bil kakki kak dannuti-su ai ittan-su ashar gibli u takhzi. The Accadian has 'Lord of the sword,' and 'his strong sword.'\n\n417. Kakkab. a Star. Agrees exactly with the Heb. Examples: as kakkab shamami val utaddu \"to the stars of heaven he paid no attention\" (or did not observe them). The Accadian version has 'stars' 'of heaven.' Again: kima kakkab shamami 'like the stars of heaven': where the Accadian renders 'heaven' by simply.\n\nI have already given the adverb kakkabish shamami 'like the stars of heaven' see No. 246. Its spelling is\n\n418. Kakkad. the Head. I find this to be a very frequent word. It seems an abbreviation of the old Hebrew Kadkad 'the head.' I formerly read Hakkad (see No. 108) but I have now adopted the pronunciation given by Oppert and others. Occasionally I find kaksu written for kakkadu, which may be only a more rapid pronunciation.\n\nThe three last words together with Kaggar 'the Earth' (see No. 109) comprise all the substantives at present known to me which begin with the syllable kak.\n\n419. Nin. a Lord. In 2 R 58, 56 the god H\u00e9a (or Bita) is called the Nin (or Lord) of the Bright Face (or Bright Eye). Nin being written in Col. 1, but in Col. 2.\n\n420. Nini. This is explained by Ili (gods) in Syllab. 688. It therefore seems to be properly the plural of the preceding word Nin (No. 419). I have found some\nA GLOSSARY OF THE\n\nexamples of its actual usage. In 2 R 59, 14 a goddess is called\n\\[ \\text{bilat 'qeer, } \\text{niini (of the gods).} \\] In 2 R 59, 14\nwe find \\[ \\text{bilat 'qeer, ili (of the gods).} \\] It\nis evident that the niini of the first passage are the ili of the\nsecond. But in the following passage \\[ \\text{niini} \\] is singular and\nmeans Nin (a Lord): \"The god Y-a \\[ \\text{niini} \\] raba (great lord)\nof heaven and earth.\" 3 R 44, col. 4, 3.\n\n421. Nin. \\[ \\text{niini} \\] a Lady. Written the same as Nin (a Lord) but\nmay have been pronounced somewhat differently. Occurs very\nfrequently. It is often put in opposition to \\[ \\text{bil} \\] Bil (Dominus).\nThus, in Art. No. 367 I have mentioned the Bil and Nin (god and\ngoddess) of knowledge; and the Bil and Nin of \\[ \\text{niini} \\] who are found on the photograph of tablet K 48. But on some\nof the tablets are longer lists of deities, given in pairs, the Bil and\nthe Nin of each kind.\n\n\\[ \\text{niini} \\] or Nin also means a Wife. Ex. gr. Tarku king of Egypt\ndied. Arkina Urdmani tar nin-na as guzu-su usib: \"afterwards\nUrdmani the son of his wife sat upon his throne\" (Smith's\nAssurbanipal p. 47).\n\n\\[ \\text{niini} \\] or Nin is sometimes 'a Woman,' ex. gr. Nin khisakkti\nhekali-m malabusa: all the favourite women of his palace (ibid.\np. 200).\n\nNin, as I have said, means both Lord and Lady. The same\nambiguity of meaning is found in the word \\[ \\text{dam} \\] Dam 'conjux'\nwhich is used both for husband and wife [see No. 423]. There\nmay have been some original connexion between the signs \\[ \\text{niini} \\]\nand \\[ \\text{dam} \\] which only differ by a single stroke, and they are\nboth represented by the Latin Dominus and Domina.\n\n422. Alti. \\[ \\text{alti} \\] a Wife. Rendered in Accadian by\n\\[ \\text{dam} \\] Dam. Thus the goddess ( . . . . ) is the Alti or wife\nof the god ( . . . . ). 2 R 18, 40. The same expression occurs on\nother tablets.\n\nAnother word for 'wife' is Ashat, see No. 57, of which the\nfollowing is a new example.\n&c., &c. [This ornament belongs] to Hipa wife of [Sinesses]. \nSha Hipa ashat-zu sha Sinesses. North British Review, No. 105, \np. 234 (correcting an error).\n\n423. **Dam.** a Consort: used (like the Latin *conjug*), for \neither husband or wife. It is an Accadian word.\n\n2 R 10, line 2. If a wife to her \nhusband [shall say] my husband [thou art not]....\n\nIn line 9 these words recur, but with an opposite meaning: \n\u201cif a husband to his wife shall say \u2018thou art not my wife\u2019.... \n&c., &c.\u201d In consequence probably of this ambiguity of meaning \nwe frequently find after the name of a god, that of the goddess his \nwife thus expressed dam-bi shal \u2018his female consort.\u2019\n\n424. **Shal makra.** a Concubine. Means \nliterally, \u2018an additional or irregular or casual wife.\u2019 The word \nmakra is the Heb. \u05de\u05b7\u05e7\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 fortuitus: thus, the second month of \nAdar, called Ve-Adar by the Hebrews, was called by the Assyrians \nArakhu makru \u2018the casual month\u2019 See Norris\u2019s Dictionary p. 50.\n\nOppert\u2019s Khors. Inscr. pl. 12, l. 3. \u201cI destroyed his city. \nI carried off his wife, his sons and daughters, his wealth and \ntreasures, his concubines, the regalia of his palace, with the people \nof his land. I left none of them.\u201d Here the word used is \nIt occurs also in a curious passage in \n2 R 16, col. ii, 67. \u201cShal makra sha bil-su imsu-su, ibbati \nkhisukhta-su-ma innapiritsi: the concubine whom her lord neg-\nlects, will break to pieces her pretty trinkets that she loved.\u201d The \nverb in this sentence is a tense of the Heb. \u05e4\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc \u2018to break.\u2019 \nIbbati from Heb. \u05e4\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05dc pulcher.\n\n425. **Zikriti.** Concubines. (Some-\ntimes written without the ). Often mentioned as captured \nalong with the family and treasures of a monarch. Assur. p. 132, \n165, 200, &c.\n\n426. **Marhita.** a Wife. See 2 R 36, lines 44 \nand 46, where it is explained by khirta and ashata.\nRelated to the Arabic Marra or Mara, \u0283a a woman or wife. It seems to be a diminutive, like ummanita from umman 'mother.'\n\n427. Khirat. \u0283a \u0283a a Wife: otherwise \u0283a \u0283a Khirtu: plur. \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a Khirati. Gula the great goddess, wife (khirat) of the meridian sun (1 Mich. iv. 6). The gods and their great wives, khirati-sun rabati. Botta 153, 12.\n\n\u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a Khiraita (wife) was the name of one of the goddesses, who was queen of the city called Susanna, otherwise Sisanna. 2 R 59, 18 and 60, 17: of which name the god Sin \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a forms an integral part.\n\n428. Amilu. \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a or \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a a Man. A very common word on the tablets, but little used in the historical inscriptions, except in the Persian period: gen. Amili \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a Amilu Parsai, a Persian (see No. 103). Plur. Amilut \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a Sha amilut iddinnu, sha tuki ana amilut iddinnu, who men gave, who their fortunes to men gave.\n\nAmilutu is likewise used in the singular, and written \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a ex. gr. l\u00fa sarru, l\u00fa issakku, l\u00fa amilutu mala suma nabu whether he be a king, or a priest, or any man however his name is called.\n\n429. Imatti. \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a the Right Hand: put for imanti from \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a 'dexter,' as libitta for libinta.\n\nThe god \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a or Im was the Jupiter Tonans of the Latins. We read that the lightnings of Im (\u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a rikhisti Im) were held in his right hand (as imatti Im) where the meaning is clearly ascertained by the Accadian version \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a It zida being the Right Hand.\n\n430. Simta. \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a \u0283a a Fabric. (Heb. \u05e9\u05d5\u05de to make, compose or put together).\n\n\"O Fire! of every thing which can be named, the fabric thou makest! Of bronze and lead the melter art thou! Of gold and silver the purifier art thou!\" The first of these lines stands thus in the original: Nin sha suma nab\u00fa simta taskan-ma. Here Nin\nmust mean 'everything.' It usually means 'nothing' or 'no one.' Similar changes occur in other languages: thus the French aucun originally meant 'some,' but now it has the meaning of 'none.'\n\n431. **Atmu.** Food. 3R 58, No. 5 (sometimes has a final vowel \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 or ). Atmu kienu as pi nisi ishkan, 'there shall be abundant food in the mouths of men.'\u2014In Oppert's Sargon, folio edition, in the description of a famine: Atmu risiti (the food of the poor) edir-imma (was entirely wanting). This verb is privatus fuit: diminutus fuit: defuit. (Schindler).\n\nThe etymology of Atmu is rather doubtful. We may compare the Heb. \u05d0\u05db \"to eat.\"\n\n432. **Takabar.** Copper (Accadian). A very frequent word. Esar. vi, 8, of a new palace: Sikkat kaspa ibbi u takabar namri uratt\u00e1 kireb-sha, 'with plates of pure silver and polished copper I lined its interior.'\n\n433. **Kiebar.** Copper. In 2R 18, 54 the Accadian takabar kim is rendered in Assyrian kim\u0105 kiebar. And so it is in other places.\n\nKiebar seems related to Cuprum: \u1f04\u03be\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 Cyprium: Copper; and even the Accadian Takabar seems referable to the same root.\n\n434. **Pasalli.** Sculptured images of metal. Heb. \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc\u05d9 sculptura, idolum. 3R 13, 29. Sennacherib placed in his new palace great beams (timmi danni) of cypress, cedar, and other woods which were covered with pasalli (images) and kaspi (silver). Compare Isaiah xxx, 22. \u05e4\u05e1\u05dc\u05d9 \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05db\u05b6\u05dd pasili kaspa, idols of silver.\n\n435. **Padi.** a Sceptre. Nabiu nash padi tsirti tsirti, 'Nebo bearing the sceptre lofty ... lofty' .... (the rest is broken off). The Accadian renders padi by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 'sceptre' (see No.141 of the Glossary) and gives a complete sense, viz. Gathula (lifting up) \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 (the lofty sceptre) sidie (governing) \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 (mankind).\n\nSimilarly, Neriglissar says that Nebo had given him his own sceptre of justice, to rule the people, and govern the land\u2014R 67, 12, and similar mentions of the divine sceptre of Nebo are frequent.\n436. \u1f08nat. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 a Goddess. Feminine of \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 'a god' (No. 1 of this Glossary). Occurs rarely. Prayer of Assurbanipal to Ishtar of Arbola [Assur. p. 121] Umma atti bilat biliti, O thou queen of queens; ilat kabli, goddess of war; bilat takhasi, lady of battles; malikat ili, queen of the gods!\u2014In page 277 we have another example.\u2014Beltis the great goddess, kadirti ilati, written \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae.\n\n437. Shadu. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 (or \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5), (often merely \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2) A Lord. Heb. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 dominus, \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 domina. Ex. from a tablet \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 Shadu rubu, the great lord, \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae ab'i father [of the god . . . .]. On an old transcript which I have of K 33 I find a singular passage \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 Shadu linir kunusi, \"May the Lord enlighten you!\" (\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 to enlighten, teach, instruct). This is repeated no less than nine times, but the verb, in the optative mood, is varied each time. The nine optatives are as follows: I am at present unable to explain them.\n\n\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae linir. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae linikh.\n\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae likattin. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae likhitis. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae libuhi.\n\u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae likla. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae liktum. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae libnuka.\n\nBy the phrase 'may the Lord protect you!' is meant the Chief of the gods, Assur at Nineveh, probably Marduk at Babylon. Compare R 37, 10 \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f38\u03bb\u03c5 \u1f08\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae Ashur shadu rubu.\n\n438. \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 a King. The pronunciation is unknown. Mr. G. Smith, No. 330, renders it Sar, but this is only the meaning, not the sound.\n\nThis is a very interesting word, being evidently identical with the Scytho-Median \u03b8\u03b1\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 'a King,' which Norris in p. 18 of his memoir on the Scythic language (Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xv.) renders (provisionally only) as Ko, and of which the true phonetic value has never been discovered.\nIt occurs frequently on the astrological tablets, for instance \\(3R60, 96\\) \\(\\text{Sar kussati ilabbar}\\) the king of the nation shall grow old upon his throne. In l. 102 also \\(\\text{gu'a 'the throne.'}\\)\n\n439. **Irsu.** \\(\\text{a King. In B.M. 38, 2 and R 43, 2 Sennacherib is called Lulimu irsu 'the noble king.' In 3R 12, 1 the phrase is Irsu itpisu, for which Taylor has Rihu itpisu, while Oppert (folio p. 15, 34) has Sarru itpisu.}\\)\n\n440. **Ukku.** \\(\\text{a King. (meant 'great man:' identical with the Medo-Scythic ukku 'great,' see Norris's Scythic vocabulary p. 181). Several examples of this word occur in 2R 47, which are all rendered by the Assyrian Sar. The phrase Sar ana Sar, king to king (sends greeting) is rendered Uk ku Uk; the syntax of which is, Uk ku (unto a king) Uk (another king) sends greeting. This phrase Sar ana Sar is common on the Omen tablets.}\\)\n\n441. **Lila,** the Night. More examples of this important word are desirable (see some in No. 25). I find the following on a tablet: *Lila ana mazarti tushasib, usib:* 'at night thou didst set me to watch; and I sat (watching).' Here *lila* is written \\(\\text{innun-ku.}\\)\n\nThe Accadian version of *ana mazarti* is *innun-ku.*\n\n442. **Lilita.** \\(\\text{a Goblin of the Night. This is a very interesting word, because it is exactly the Hebrew Spectrum Nocturnum. In a numerous list of sprites and demons the following occurs L\u00fa lil\u00fa, l\u00fa lilita \"whether it be a male or female goblin of the night.\"}\\)\n\n443. **Gallil.** \\(\\text{verb, to be wicked. (Amilut) l\u00fa ugalil, l\u00fa udammik, nin val idi: 'no one knows (of a man) whether he be wicked, or whether he be righteous.' The meaning of the two verbs is fixed by the Accadian translation (wicked) and (righteous). [The second verb dammik is very common and its meaning well known.]}\\)\n\n444. **Gall\u00fa.** \\(\\text{an Evil Spirit, sometimes written In Accadian. Apparently derived from the verb gallil 'to be wicked,' see last article. These}\\)\nspirits are frequently mentioned, and the epithet 'wicked' is given to them. They had sometimes the form of bulls, and were very injurious to men. The Accad version is 'like an evil spirit.' The Accad version is\n\n445. Nara, (verb) to Help or Succour. I have only found this verb, which is the root of the common word Nirarut 'assistance,' in the following passage 3 R 15,9. A battle was impending during a hazardous expedition to recover his father's throne. Esarhaddon had prayed to the gods. The divine response was: Alik! la katta! idu-ka nittallak, ninara girri-ka: \"go! fear not! we march by thy side, we assist thy expedition!\" The verbs are written nittallak, and ninara.\n\nKatta is a doubtful word, but may be the Heb. 'timor.'\n\nPerhaps the phrase Shadu linir kunusi! in No. 437 should be rendered \"May the Lord help you!\" from the verb nara of this article.\n\n446. Ida, to Help. In Assur. p. 68, the king of Lydia submits to Assurbanipal saying \"the King whom God assists, art Thou!\" Sar sha Il idu su, atta! Ida comes from Id 'the side' Heb. To help a person, to take his side. Hence the further use of the Heb. in the sense of auxilium.\n\nPerhaps idu in the above sentence is a substantive. We might translate \"the King who God is (by) his side, art Thou!\"\n\n447. Khisa, to make haste, Heb. festinavit. In R 41,16 it is related that Suzub the Chaldean returned in great haste from the land of Elam, and seized the crown of Babylon: ultu Nura-ki ikhis-amma. He then stripped off the gold from the temples of Bel and Zirpanita, and sent it to Umman-Minan king of Elam, as a bribe, with this urgent appeal for help:\n\nBukkhir umman-ko, collect thy army!\nDik\u00e1 karasi-ka, strike thy camp!\n\nana Babel khis-amma, make haste to Babylon!\n\nid\u00e1-ni ziz, stand by our side!\n\nIn my version of bukkhir and dika I follow Norris Dict. 474.\n\nThe use of \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7 in Hebrew is quite similar. Ps. xxii, 19. haste thee (to help me!). Furst says: \"to haste to, with \u05dc\u05b0 of the person\"\u2014which would be ana in Assyrian. Thus: Khisa ana Babel, 'haste to Babylon,' would be in Hebrew \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05e2\u05b7 \u05dc\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05dc.\n\nZiz frequently means 'to stand.' Thus in Assur. p. 124 makhar-sha taxiz thou didst stand before her.\n\n448. Etik, to change; forsake; remove from. Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 dimovit, transtulit. In Assur. p. 41, we read that Necho and the other kings of Egypt adie Assur etiku 'forsook the faith of Assur.' Hence I see that the passage quoted in No. 324 ought to have been translated \"the queen of the Arabians,\" sha mamit Shamas titiku \"who has now forsaken the worship of the Sun.\"\n\n449. Zahin, to Adorn. Assur. p. 156. Ikbud limut, he devised evil, ana ekim makhazi, to capture the holy cities, subat Ili, the dwellings of the gods, sha isriti-sun uddisu, whose temples I had restored, uzahinu khuraza ukaspa, and had adorned them with gold and silver, kireb-sun astakkanu simati, and had placed treasures within them. (See also No. 224.)\n\n450. Naplits, to Bless, to regard with favour. Bit-ka naplits! alu-ka naplits! bless thy temple, bless thy city! Babilu u bit Sagagathu naplits! bless Babylon and the temple of Sagagathu!\n\nAna bit Tara khadish naplits! bless joyfully the temple of Tara! Senk. ii, 17. The verb is written\nin this passage, and also in Birs. N. ii, 18 and R 52, 25 without variation of spelling. In Oppert's \"Inscription of Khorsabad,\" l. 12, Ili rabi (the great gods) \\( \\text{Ili rabi} \\) ispaluni (blessed me). In same, l. 188, Hekali satina Assur abu ili in nummur bun-su illiti kinish lippalis! \\( \\text{Hekali satina Assur abu ili in nummur bun-su illiti kinish lippalis!} \\) lippalis, may he bless (those palaces!) On a tablet concerning a man afflicted with an evil spirit \u201cMarduk ippalitzu, Marduk will look on him with pity\u201d: written \\( \\text{Marduk ippalitzu} \\). Again, in Assur. p. 290 Anaku khalish appalis-su, \u2018I inclined myself to him with favour\u2019\u2014written \\( \\text{Anaku khalish appalis-su} \\). The change of \\( \\text{E} \\) for \\( \\text{E} \\) (see last example) is rather capricious.\n\nThis verb naplits is a quadriliteral, unless we suppose it a niphal form from palis.\n\n451. \\( \\text{Arar} \\), to Curse. Agrees exactly with the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e8 maledixit: execratus est.\n\n\\( \\text{Liruru} \\), may they curse! Michaux stone col. iv, 24 \u201cMay the gods whose names are written on this stone, curse him with a curse which cannot be removed! arrat la napsuri liruru-su!\u201d And so in Tiglath Pileser\u2019s inscription Arrati marusta liruru-su!\u2019 may they curse him with perilous curses! R. 16, 76.\n\n452. \\( \\text{Gur} \\), \\( \\text{Gur} \\) to Scold, or Reprehend. Exactly the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05df increpitum, objurgavit aliquem, ut pater filium, \u05d9\u05b8\u05db\u05b4\u05d9\u05df et increpitum eum pater ejus\u2019 Gen. xxxvii, 10 (Gesenius).\n\nIn 2 R 10, 15 is one of the old laws of Assyria.\n\nApilu (if a master) arda igur-ma (shall scold his servant, and); imtut ikhtalik (shall threaten him with death)........ &c. &c. [he shall pay a heavy fine.]\n\n453. \\( \\text{Kubie} \\), \\( \\text{Kubie} \\) Curses. \\( \\text{I:zarrakh-su} \\) (he will be enraged with him) \\( \\text{kubie igabnu-su} \\) (and will speak curses unto him). This is the Hebrew \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9. Gesenius says: \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9 maledixit: execratus est (Numbers xxiii, 13) \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b5\u05d9 \u201cCurse me them from thence!\u201d (story of Balakam).\n\nAnother example: \\( \\text{Kubie agabbi} \\) (I spoke curses, or sharp words) manman val isiman-anni (but no one heard). In these two\nexamples kubie is used in conjunction with the verb gabba \u2018to speak,\u2019 and seems derived from it. I believe that kubie meant originally \u2018words.\u2019 Gesenius states, what is very important, that the verb \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9 is the same as \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9 which sometimes means \u2018to curse,\u2019 but sometimes simply \u2018to speak or name.\u2019 Hence we perceive the true connexion of the Assyrian verb gabba \u2018to speak\u2019 so constantly used, with the Hebrew, namely that it is the verb \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9 reduced to \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9 by the rejection of the initial N.\n\n454. Guk. or the monogram to Swell: perhaps to Burst. This seems to be the Heb. or erupit: prorupit: effusus est.\n\nTarku king of Ethiopia had captured Memphis which belonged to Assurbanipal. Allaku khanthu (a rapid messenger) as kireb Ninua illik-amma (came to Nineveh) usanni yaati (and told me the news). Eli ipsiti unnati (on account of these doings) libbi igug (my heart swelled) izzarukh kabatti (and my liver was enraged). Assur. p. 17.\n\n455. Zarikh, to be enraged\u2014to burst with rage. Heb. supercrevit (to swell greatly): effusus est (to burst).\n\nizzarrakh, he will be enraged (phrase on a tablet). izzarukh kabatti, my liver swelled with rage. Assur. p. 17, but in this passage Oppert (Egyptian Campaigns p. 64) reads izzarikh. Compare also the phrase tsirikha igabbi \u2018he will speak angry words;\u2019 and that in Assur. p. 212 Suparamati annati as tsirikhti libbi-ya, \u201cconcerning these matters in the indignation of my heart [I took up arms, &c.]\u201d written tsirikhti.\n\n456. Kallam, to Speak. A purely Arabic word, used of divine speech, ex. gr. kalam Allah, \u2018the word of God,\u2019 which came to Jonah. (Jonah i, 1, Wright\u2019s edition).\n\nUkallimu \u2018they spoke\u2019 Tukallima \u2018thou spakest.\u2019 In Assur. p. 235 the gods, who had uttered a prophecy in ancient times,\n\"now spoke it again to later people\" eninna ukallima nisi arkati. And in Assur. p. 250 a passage perfectly similar, except that it is in the second person, tukallima \"thou spakest it again to later people.\"\n\n457. Anakhut. an Injury. Chald. afflictus est. In 3 R plate 4 No. 4 Suzub king of Babylon irsa anakhat, sustained an injury [by falling from his horse]. In Assur. p. 239, a grandson of Marduk-Baladan heard very bad news, and tktum libba-su (his heart was smitten) irsa anakuttu (he sustained great affliction): napista-su pan\u00fas-su val igir (his life had no value in his sight): ikhounka mitutu (he wished for death). He said to his swordbearer, 'slay me with the sword!' Then he and his swordbearer slew each other.\n\nThe two spellings of anakhat differ, but the verb irsa being the same identifies the word.\n\nBesides this use of the word anakhat, it occurs continually in the following phrase, \"In future times, when these buildings shall grow old and decay, blessed be the king my successor who shall repair their injuries!\" (ankhut-zun luttish). Or, when only one palace is spoken of, ankhut-sa luttish.\n\n458. Enakh, (verb) to be Injured: to Decay (Chald. This and the last No. apparently belong to the same root: they generally occur together.\n\nEnuma sigurratu shatina usalbaru enakhu, when these towers shall grow old and decay.\u2014Tig. viii, 52. Enuma hekal satu ilabbiru inakhu, Esar. vi, 61 written The same phrase in Bellino 63, but written innakhu.\n\n459. Arba. to Catch in a Snare. Heb. insidiatus est. In 3 R 4 No. 4, Sennacherib goes in chase of four large eagles, among the mountains. He says: \"Two of them maskanati arba I caught with (nets?).\n\n460. Belbel, to Melt Heb. fudit. Sha eriu anaki mubullil-sun atta, Thou, O Fire, art the melter of brass and lead. (tablet).\n461. **Shallal.** to Spoil: *subst.* Spoil. Agrees exactly with the Heb. spoliavit.\n\n\\[ \\text{Asallal (I will carry off) the people of Shushan, &c.} \\]\n\nAssur. 179. *Isallal* occurs 3 R 56, 17 *mat isallal*, he will plunder the land. *Salal*, the spoil, or carrying off, of his god Masdia. Opp. Khors. ix, 3. These forms are comparatively rare: but *ashlula* 'I spoiled' occurs very frequently.\u2014*Sha sarri Elam makhruti istulu*, [all the valuables] \"which the former kings of Elam had carried off.\" Written *istulu*. Assur. p. 226.\n\n462. **Makhar**, to Pray. *Amkhur* or *Amkhar* 'I prayed'\u2014ex. gr. *Assur u Ishtar amkhur* I prayed to Assur and Ishtar. (Assur. p. 191). *Amkhar sakuti Ishtar*, I prayed to the lofty Ishtar (Assur. 120). *As sat musi suatu sha amkhuru-si* in the nighttime of that night in which I had prayed to her (Assur. p. 123)\u2014*Ki sha ana Assur amkhuru*, as I had prayed to Assur [so it fell out]. Assur. p. 67.\n\n*T* conjugation *Imdakharunima* they besought me. Assur. p. 81.\n\n463. **Labat**, to Overthrow. Agrees with the Heb. praeceps ruinit: praecipitavit: praeceps ruinit.\n\n*S* conjugation *Sulbit*, ex. gr. *Isriti Elam adi la basi usalbit*, I overthrew the temples of Elam until none were left.\n\n464. **Lebesh**, to Clothe. The same in Hebrew, vestivit.\n\nAssur. p. 27. *Lubultu birmi ulabbis-su*, 'I clothed him with scarlet raiment.' Written *Sallbis*. Phill. i, 37. *Papakha Nabiu sha kireb bit-saggathu, sibbu-su, sigaru-su, u babnaku-su khurassi usalbis*. \"The chapel of Nebo which is within the temple of Saggathu, its gates, its doors and its . . . . with gold I covered.\" Written *usalbis*. This verb is a common one.\n\n465. **Kala**, to Speak, a rather doubtful word, suggested by the two following examples, and the analogy of the Hebrew *Vox*\nA GLOSSARY OF THE\n\n\\[\\text{he did not utter prayers.} \\quad \\text{Liki unnini-ya. Simi kala-ya. \"Receive my prayers! Hear my voice!\" This latter example I have considered in No. 379.

Ikribi-ya sunukhuti, \"my repeated prayers.\" Written }\\]\n\n467. Zibu. \\[\\text{a kind of Antelope. Heb. Dorcas. A tablet mentions Zibu surrukhu 'swift antelopes.' The word stands between ga makhe 'fine oxen' and tsieni (\u2026) sheep. The epithet given to the sheep I do not know. Offerings to the gods are here spoken of. Similar offerings are mentioned in Opp. Khors. l. 172, where the epithet surrukhi is given to another animal (called ) and the Zibi or antelopes ( ) have the epithet illuti 'excellent,' while another animal has the epithet ibbuti 'pretty.' In both these texts, it will be observed, occurs, I must leave it doubtful whether it is an animal or the epithet of one.}\\]\n\nMr. Norris's translation of Opp. Khors. l. 172, will be found in his dictionary p. 308. He thinks the Zibi were birds, because a bird of that name is mentioned in 2 R 37, 4.\n\nThe Syriac form of \\[\\text{is tabia . The Assyrian inscriptions very seldom name any females. One exception is the princess Tabna whom Esarhaddon (iii, 13) appointed to be queen over a Syrian or Arabian nation. I think her name meant Dorcas, as that was a favourite female name. See Acts ix, 36, \"Tabitha which by interpretation is called Dorcas.\" Gesenius says: Hebr\u00e6i pariter atque Arabes tanti faciebant dorcadis pulchritudinem ut ei compararent quidquid pulchrum est et venustum.}\\]\n\n468. Nimru, a Leopard. Heb. \\[\\text{Pardus. Nimri, leopards, together with many other wild animals, in my Calah I collected.\u2014B.M. 44, 19.}\\]\nThe spots on this animal may be compared to Eyes. This affords a very simple etym of the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b5\u05e5, viz. from the Assyrian Namri in the sense of Eyes or Vision.\n\n469. Urbarra. \u05d0\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b2\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9 a Tiger (?). It is frequently said in the omen tablets, \"If the weather and seasons are so-and-so, nanthur Urmakh Urbarra, Lions and Tigers (?) will be seen. 3 R 61, col. ii, 10. The translation is conjectural.\n\n470. Mu. \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 Water. Chald. \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 which singular is not found in Hebrew, but only the plural \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 or \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9. Josephus gives M\u03c9, from which he derives the name of Moses. The plural Mie 'waters' is very common in Assyrian, but the singular is comparatively rare, and therefore I will give an example or two of it. Speaking of the Euphrates: \"Mu-sha as abzie kinish kunn\u016b its water . . . . in the Ocean.\" Sometimes it is written simply \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 ex. gr. elish isaggu mu, from above they drank water (Ch. \u05d0\u05b6\u05dc\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4\u05bc bibit). Here the Accadian translation of \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 by \u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9 'water' identifies its meaning.\n\n471. Aminna. \u05d0\u05b8\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d4 (Accad.) a kind of Crown. Evidently derived from Amia 'a crown' (see No. 404). In 2 R 30, 19 Aminna is explained by Ag\u00fa el\u00fa 'lofty crown.'\n\n472. Izkati. \u05d0\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9 Fetters. Exactly the Hebrew \u05d0\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9 catena, vincula, Jerem. xl, 1. As biriti anbar, izkati anbar, utammikhu kati u shapie, with bonds of iron and fetters of iron they held their hands and feet. Assur. p. 26 (same words in p. 44). As zizzi izkati anbar, biriti anbar utammikh, [two chiefs] in strong fetters of iron and bonds of iron he bound. Assur. p. 66; and same words in Assur. p. 113.\n\n473. Sigaru. \u05e1\u05b4\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 Chains. Probably from the Hebrew root \u05e1\u05b4\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 to lock or close (Levit. xiii, 4, to imprison a person).\n\nIn Assur. p. 261, Sigaru askun-su, 'I placed chains on him' [and threw him into the great central prison of Nineveh.]\n\n474. Zulul. \u05e6\u05b8\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc Shade. Heb. \u05e6\u05b8\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc\u05dc obumbrate. Ikhtallubu kishti sha zulul-sin rapsu, they passed through forests\nwhose shade was vast. Assur. p. 267. Norris p. 348, gives the form Zalul. In that passage I think it means the shade of an umbrella of state.\n\nZalul is very frequently used for 'the roof of a building,' which shades it. E.I.H. ix. 8. \"Tall Cedars, the growth of lofty mountains, I laid for its roof, ana zululi-sha usatriz.\" Written Zululi. And in E.I.H. col. iii. in the account of the splendours of the chapel of Nebo, Zululu occurs several times. Ex.gr. \"The Cedar roof of the Kua (shrine or oracle) I covered with shining silver, usalbis kaspi namri. Another roof I covered with gold and precious stones,\" &c. &c.\n\n475. Zubati. Victims. Heb. Zubah hostia: victima. I find the following passage in an address to the deity, asking for pardon of sins, and varying the phrase in different ways. Killati-ya mahadati kima zubati sukhat! \"Slay my many sins, as if they were victims!\" This prayer realizes to us one of the primitive ideas and objects of sacrifice. In slaying the victim (the Sin-Offering) the sin was also slain or destroyed. So in Leviticus, chap. 1, when any man of the children of Israel brought a sheep gont or bullock to the door of the tabernacle, he first put his hand upon its head, to transfer his own guilt upon the victim, and after that it was sacrificed.\n\nI must remark that sukhat was a verb proper to sacrifices, the Hebrew mactavit pecudem; ex.gr. Levit. i, 5, 'and he shall kill the bullock.'\n\nThe Accadian translation of kima zubati is ku kim. Hence the name of a victim in Accadian was Ku. And the term for 'a sacrificing priest' was Bil Ku 'master of sacrifice,' see Assur. 184 and again p. 186 with prefixed, denoting 'an office.'\n\n476. Zibi. Vultures. In Assur. p. 166 some criminals are put to death, and the king says: \"I gave their flesh to be eaten by dogs, wolves(? vulture-birds (zibi-khu): eagle-birds (it-khu, the birds of heaven and the fishes of the deep. In 2 R 37, 4 in a long list of birds, we find the Zibu\nexplained Kharrukhai, which in Mr. Norris's opinion (Dictionary, p. 308) means 'bird of the desert.' I suppose from Heb. \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, Arab. \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064f\u0648\u0646 (Sch. p. 653) related to \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df, &c., implying desolation from extreme dryness\u2014burnt-up land. This etym seems not improbable.\n\n477. Zibi. GIFTS.\n\nNatan zibi, a giving of gifts i.e. liberality. In Tig. vii, 52 and the Annals i, 25 the King is praised for his pious care of the temples: Ip\u0161it kati-su u natan-zibi-su ili rabi itibu (or iramu) 'the works of his hands and his great generosity pleased the gods.'\n\nZibi may come from a verb ziba 'to give,' which I find in 2 R 13, 37 Siparta-su (his money) la shakilta (not weighed, i.e. without stint) sha ana sibruti izilu (which he had given for . . . .). And I think it occurs also in the name of the temple of Ziba-tila (giver of life) an epithet of the goddess Gula at Babylon.\n\n478. Zariri. GOLD (?).\n\nThis appears to be the Persian Zar 'gold,' a word which may have become known to the Assyrians in very ancient times. In Botta pl. 18 quater; pl. 152; and elsewhere it is said: \"I offered to the gods katri of pure gold and bright silver, katri zariri russi, kasbu ibbi.\" Now, russi is the standing epithet of 'gold,' insomuch that the Accadian is rendered in Assyrian khuraza russ\u00e1 (see No. 400). Hence I think that the substantive joined to it in the preceding passage of Botta probably means 'gold.' In the other texts in which zariri occurs the meaning of 'gold' suits very well. E.I.H. iii, 10 (quoted by Norris p. 382) \"I adorned the shrine of Marduk with zariri and abni (with gold and precious stones).\" Also, Assur. p. 227 \"I captured fine chariots of various descriptions sha akhitzu-sin zariri zakhal\u00fa, whose exterior was gilt and adorned with figures.\" Compare E.I.H. ix, 12 \"doors, &c., ikhitz kaspa khurassu, whose exterior was silver and gold.\" Heb. \u05d7\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05df 'exterior.'\n\nIt appears to me, that in Elam the Persian words Zar 'gold' and Sim 'silver' were current, but that they were usually employed with the Persian case-ending ra (making Zar-ra and Sim-ra). For, when Assurbanipal took Susa, the capital of Elam,\n(Assur. p. 226) he carried off all the 'pure gold' zarir\u00fa russ\u00fa, and 'bright silver' ismar\u00fa ibbl\u00fa, of the Elamite kings. Here ismar\u00fa (or simar\u00fa) is written \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008.\n\nIf this is correct, a further consequence is, that Zar and Sim are very ancient Persian words.\n\n479. Ismar\u00fa. \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 Silver. See preceding article for one example. Another is found in E.I.H. iii, 56 in the account of the very splendid decorations of the chapel of Nebo. Not only were the cedar roofs plated with silver, but the very approaches were equally splendid. Tallakti papakha (the path to the chapel) u malaku bit (and the way to the temple) aguri ismar\u00ed \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 \"with slabs of silver\" \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 gub\u00fa \"were paved.\" \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 reads 'aguri,' the i being borrowed from the next word (in quick pronunciation). Agurri are slabs or flat plates of any kind, ex.gr. of alabaster\u2014agurri zamat illiti. E.I.H. col. iii.\n\nThe last two words of the above translation \"were paved\" require a particular examination. In the East India House slab lithographed in the British Museum series plate 54 they stand thus (line 57) \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 gub\u00fa. But here Porter's transcript, which is of equal authority with the India House slab, differs from it very notably, reading \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 Agurri ismar\u00ed gubuthu. This verb gubuthu I propose to render \"they were paved.\" Indeed, I think that we have here the Hebrew word Gabbatha 'a pavement,' which is found in the New Testament (John xix, 13) \"He sat down in a place that is called the Pavement, (\u03bb\u03b9\u03b8\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd) but in the Hebrew Gabbatha.\" This is the more interesting since Hebrew and Syriac scholars seem unable to confirm by other examples this interpretation of gabbatha. But here we have it, if I am not mistaken, preserved in the Assyrian language.\n\n480. Busha. \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 Treasures. R 63, 20, of a Palace. \"Former kings busha-sun in kirbi unakkimu, stored up their treasures within it.\" A very common word.\n\n481. Garsu. \u3008\u3008\u3008 \u1f18 \u1f18 \u1f18\u3009\u3009\u3008 Wealth. Treasure. Opp. Khors. 10, l. 87\n[I carried off his gold and silver] *garsu hekali-su sha niba la is\u00fa*, 'the treasures of his palace which had no number' [were innumerable]. This word is very common. It may be the Persian *Gaza*, Ch. and Syr. *Ganza*.\n\n482. **Risiti.**  the First, or Best. From *Ris* or *Rish* 'the first.' Heb. \n\nBellino l. 20 and Sen. B.l. 9 (see 3 R 12) \"I sacrificed one bull, ten sheep, ten Kuruni (some horned animal(?), probably deer): twenty (animals) kalima risiti-su \"the best of every kind.\" I think these twenty comprise the preceding ten sheep and ten deer, and it is merely added that they were victims of especial beauty. *Kalima* 'of every kind' is a very common word.\n\n483. **Khallul.**  to Clothe.\n\n*Zabi sunuti sha naru suatu ikhr\u00fa*, \"those soldiers who had dug that canal\" [with yellow cloth and scarlet dresses] *ukhallul sunuti* \"I clothed them.\" Written Bavian 33. In R 19, 93 the king executes a Rebel Chief. *Akutz tzu-su* (or *masak-su*), *Dur sha ali Ninua ukhallul*. \"I flayed off his skin, and with it clothed the wall of the palace of Nineveh.\" This is repeated two or three times in the same page, with some variations. Dr. Hincks first explained the meaning. In this second example *ukhallul* is written exactly as in the Bavian inscription.\n\n\"The Cedar roof of the chapel of Nebo with gold I covered,\" *ukhallilu* Porter's transcript of E.I.H. iii, 45. The India House slab has *usalbush* \"I clothed,\" the S conjugation of *\u05dc\u05b8\u05d1\u05e9\u05c1* 'to clothe.'\n\n484. **Zalukh,** to Pour. Chald. *fluxit*; whence *Imbres*.\n\nIn Opp. Khors. l. 131 the king destroys the enemy: *Azlish unakkis* \"I cut them off like azli;\" *imat m\u00fati azlukha*, \"and I poured upon them the storm of death.\" Written azlukha. Sargon l. 29 is very similar. *Gimir bakhulati-sun azlish udabikhu* \"all their people he slaughtered like azli;\" *as mati nakhiri izlubku imat m\u00fati* \"and upon the hostile lands he poured a storm of death.\" Here Oppert reads *naplish* instead of *azlish*, and the correction *as mati* is due to him. *Izlukhu* is written .\nThe meaning is fixed by the somewhat similar passage of Nerigl. i, 27 quoted by Norris, p. 482, which substitutes for izlukhu the verb izannu 'they pour down' which almost always denotes Rain and Storms.\n\n485. Dabakh, to Slaughter. Chald. \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9, but in Hebrew \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd 'mactavit peculem.'\n\nudabikhu 'he slaughtered;' see the preceding article. The letter is omitted in some copies.\n\n486. Shur, to set Free, to Liberate. Chald. \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9 solvit (ex. gr. de vinculis. Ges.). Dan. iii, 25 \"Lo! I see four men loose\" (soluti). In R 39, 7. Sittuti-sun (the rest of them) who had committed no crime, usshur-sun akbi (I commanded them to be set at liberty). Written usshur. This seems to be a Hiphil form of the verb.\n\n487. Tillukh. \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 to Meditate. Schindler's Lexicon gives us the verb \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 meaning in Chald. and Syr. 'to doubt' and in Arabic 'to think' or 'meditate.'\n\nOld proverb: As tami ussus, as musi tillukh; \"Work by day: think by night.\" Schindler's example of \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \"meditatus sum nocte\" is very apposite. Psalm 77. The word ussus is doubtful; the Accadian renders it by the verb gu (reduplicated). But in another passage ussa is rendered or by the verb du 'to go' (reduplicated). 'Activity' seems to be meant.\n\n488. Naziq, to Hurt or Injure. Chald. \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03c4\u03cc\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 (Aphel in Ezra inaziq) Lusit, nocuit, damno affecit, (Schindler). Asakku sha mat inazzakhu (or inaziqu) \"Demons who hurt mankind.\" For which reason the later Chaldeans called them Maziqi (or Hurters) see Schindler p. 1101. Maziq. Daemon nocens hominibus: and more about them in Buxtorf p. 1325.\n\nMat, sometimes Matu is very often used for people\u2014men\u2014mankind, &c. It is rendered in Accadian by , sometimes by .\n\nOther examples:\nLibba-su nazkhu 'his heart is hurt.' In 2 R 38, 34 the king gives to the gods a great number of precious stones. He names nine or ten kinds, and then says: u abni il, sha mu-su nazqu, written This, I think, may mean \"and other stones whose names are injured\"\u2014viz., in the record which the scribe was copying. I prefer this to the translation given in No. 60.\n\nThe Accadian has Ziga \"to hurt.\"\n\n489. Asakku. a Daemon or Goblin. Probably from nazik 'to hurt,' because they harmed men (see last article). They were called in Accadian Itpa.\n\n490. Udukku. or sometimes merely an Evil Spirit: in Accadian The old Babylonians were firm believers in demoniacal possession, and practised exorcism or the casting out of unclean spirits. A tablet published some years ago by the British Museum (2 R 18) has not yet attracted the attention it deserves. It says, of a sick man, \"May the goddess . . . . wife of the god . . . . pani-su ana ashri shanuma likun, turn his face in another direction, udukku sinu litzi-ma, as akhati lizbat, that the evil spirit may come out of him, and be thrust aside: sidi tuki, lamassi tuki, as zumri-su lu-kayan, that good spirits and good powers may dwell in his body. 2 R 18, 41. Written lu-kayan.\n\n491. Kimi. some small animals good for food.\n\nIt is said of certain malignant daemons, that they devour men as if they were Kimi. Matu kima kimi igammu. The verb is the Chald. gama 'to swallow' Matu is rendered in Accadian by ; kima kimi by ku kim; and igamma by written twice, with added. This probably means 'eating,' being composed of placed within the sign Ka, or mouth.\n\nBut what are Kimi? I find them in a list (apparently) of small birds in 2 R 5, 38 with the Accadian version Kuda\nwhich is probably a mere variant of \ud808\udd60\u0161u\u0161an \u0161a hu. I think therefore\nthat we may translate\u2014these heroes men as if they were sparrows.\u201d\n\n492. Im. \ud808\ude17\ud808\udd77  a Storm.

In 2 R 50 lines 1\u201423 is a long list of the principal Ziggurratu of Babylonia, commencing with those of Suanna (a name of Babylon) and Borsippa.\n\n497. Shalkh\u00fa. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 a Fortress. Perhaps from the verb shalkhu to preserve; keep safe; in the same way as the chief tower of a Norman castle was called the Keep. This word occurs frequently. In 2 R 50, 25 we read that Imgur Bel was the Dur of Suanna-ki (Babylon); and Nibit-Bel was its Shalkh\u00fa. The exact distinction between the two has not been ascertained: both were fortresses.\n\n498. Rish. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 the Head. gen. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Risi. (Of a sick man) Musi u urra as risi-su lu-kayan, \u2018day and night may it stand at his head!\u2019 (some charm). Written \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. This is varied in 2 R 18, 49 to as risi-su lizbat. Elsewhere to the same effect, as rish amilu \u2018at the man\u2019s head\u2019 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. The symbol \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 is written for Rish, and the Accadian often has \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \u2018for the head\u2019 ex gr. 2 R 18, 49. But the most usual form is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97.\n\n499. Tsir. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 the Back. plur. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Tsiri.

Kabat. The Liver (hence metaphorically Anger, Indignation). Also frequently the Heart.\n\nBoth the heart and the liver were supposed by the ancients to be the seat of the wrathful passions. Fervens difficili bile tumet jecur. (Hor.) quant\u00e0 jecur ardeat ir\u00e0. (Juv.) rabie jecur incendente feruntur (Juv.).\n\nHeb. \u05db\u05d1\u05d3 kabad jecur (same in Arabic). \u05db\u05d1\u05d3 also means \u2018animus\u2019 Thren. ii. 11. Ad terram effusum est jecur meum (\u05db\u05d1\u05d3). Hyperbolice dictum de gravissimo vulnere jecoris, i.e. animi. Gesen.\u2014Figuratively for \u2018my heart is wounded.\u2019 Furst.\nThis word occurs very frequently in the Assyrian writings, but strange to say, it has been overlooked by all, except Oppert (Egyptian Campaigns p. 64). Kabatti (my heart\u2014my liver\u2014my indignation) has, wherever it occurs, been mistaken for Kabitti (great or numerous), of course to the great injury of the sense, which can be cleared up materially in perhaps fifty instances by restoring the true translation.\n\nYet the Assyrians have been very careful to distinguish the two words, for they always write \\(\\text{Kabatti}\\) (the heart) with the sign \\(\\text{bat}\\), but \\(\\text{Kabitti}\\) (numerous) with the sign \\(\\text{bit}\\).\n\nI will give a good many examples of the word, in order to justify the foregoing remarks.\n\nI. \\(\\text{Kabatti}\\) is the Heart or Liver, i.e. wrath: indignation. Assur. p. 17. Eli ipsiti annati libbi igug-ma, izzarukk kabatti, \u2018about these doings my heart swelled, my liver was enraged.\u2019 This is a favorite phrase in the Assyrian writings, recurring in Assur. pages 30 and 38; and twice in the broken cylinder of Esarhaddon (3 R 15 col. i, 2 and col. ii, 13).\n\nII. Nukh kabatti is a frequent phrase. Placere cordi alicujus. Placare iram alicujus. Heb. quiescere, to be calm, also quiescere fecit, tranquillavit (Gesen.) to calm the feelings of another. answers both to placare and placere. Examples. In Assur. 121 the king prays to Ishtar: \u201cO goddess who in the presence of thy father always speakest good of me, so as to gladden the mind of Assur, and please the heart of Marduk\u201d . . . . . . . Here observe the parallelism\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Suthup libbi Assur} \\\\\n\\text{Nukkhi kabatti Marduk}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThe original text is \\(\\text{Suthup libbi Assur}\\)\n\nIn Assur. 223 the king ravages the land of Elam. \u201cI destroyed their cities: I made an end of the people who dwelt in them: I broke their gods to pieces (\\text{usabbir ili-sun}) and by so doing I calmed the anger of the Lord of Lords (Assur). Written\nThe two next examples should be compared together, because they illustrate one another. In Assur. 105 Urtaki king of Elam and his chief counsellor come to an evil end. \"Libbi Assur aggu (the heart of Assur vengeful) val inukh sunuti (did not let them rest) val ipsukh sunuti (gave them no repose). Kabatti Ishtar (the wrath of Ishtar) the years of his reign ended. The throne of Elam passed to another.\" Here ipsukh is from the same verb just mentioned. In Assur. p. 108 there is another account of the same event. \"Libbi (the hearts) ili rabi bili-ya (of the great gods my lords) val inukh, val ipsukh (did not let him rest) Sezuzu kabatti bilti-sun, the fiery anger of their divinities [destroyed his reign and ended his years. The throne of Elam passed to another\"].\n\nThe adjective Sezuzu 'fiery' (usually written) from the verb combussit in the S conjugation, is elsewhere an epithet of lightning, thunderbolts, &c.\n\nThe next example is very different. It seems to be some advice to the students. I take it from the photograph of tablet 143 (or 112 a). Aggu libba-kun linukha! may it calm the anger of your minds! lippashra kabatta-kun, may it reconcile your hearts! Written Lippashra is the optative mood of the Rabbinic verb to pacify or reconcile, see Sch. 1498. Observe how constantly the words Lib (the mind) and Kabat (the heart) accompany each other. So also in the Vocabulary (2 R 36, 53) Libbu, and Kabattu stand next but one to each other.\n\nIII. Kabat often means the Heart, viewed as the seat of Intelligence. Bellino l. 42 \"Then I Sennacherib king of Assyria, by command of the Gods, to complete this great work in uzni-ya\nibsi-ma, kabatti uplam-ma, resolved in my mind, and brought my heart to it.\u201d\u2014More fully given in the Bull inscriptions 3 R 13, 22. B.M. 41, 25. B.M. 60, 27 where among other things, he says \u201cin mirish kubatti-ya (in the skilfulness of my heart) I made figures of bronze, and finished them artistically.\u201d\u2014Mirish comes I think from the root solers, astatus (Schindler p. 660).\n\nIV. Prayers for the king are very frequent. Thus in 2 R 36, 24 As khiga siri, khut libbi, namar kabatti, salmish, &c. \u201cwith sound limbs, cheerful mind, and bright heart, may he walk in perfection before thee!\u201d Observe, the three adjectives stand before their substantives.\n\nIn Esar vi, 55 the sacred stone bulls and lions are called \u201cthe guardians of my royal treasures, and the gladdeners of my heart, mukhadli kabatti-ya. The same text is found in 3 R 16 col. vi, 12.\n\nV. The form Kubat occurs in Assur. p. 153, where the king says the gods have adorned kubat-su \u2018his heart\u2019 in kitti u misari \u2018with good faith and justice.\u2019 Therefore he received without suspicion the ambassadors of his faithless brother and loaded them with honours.\n\nVI. The form Gabat occurs in Assur. p. 118, in the account of the illness of Tiumman inflicted on him by the anger of the gods. \u201cHis lips were swollen, his eyes grew dim, and gabat-zu (his liver) issakin us libbi-sha (was inflamed in its interior).\u201d\n\nOn the other hand the adjective kabittu (much : many : numerous) always requires to be preceded by a substantive. It is generally written with the syllable Bit, sometimes though rarely with Bi-it, but never with Bat. Example: Shallatu kabittu ana kireb Assur-ki ashlula \u201cmuch plunder to Assyria I carried away,\u201d Botta 147, 12.\n\nI turn now to the verb Kubat or Kabad, to have in the heart : to plot or meditate : of which I will give several examples:\n\n1. Opp. Khors. l. 112 \u201cThe king of Commagene, a Syrian heretic, not worshipping the gods, kapidu sinieti (plotting rebellion)\u201d\ndabibu zalulti (meditating treason). Written \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u Kapidu.\n\n2. Assur. 164 \u201cThe people who had plotted (usakpidu) along with my rebellious brother.\u201d Written \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u Kapidu.\n\n3. Assur. 156 Ikbut limut, he devised evil.\n\n4. Same page, Ikbudu limuttu, they devised evil.\n\nBut when the verb kabat is joined to libba as in the phrase ikbud libba-su, it is doubtful whether we ought to translate \u201che devised in his heart\u201d or \u201che hardened his heart\u201d i.e., \u201cobstinately resolved\u201d (not to pay tribute, or the like). This would be the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d4 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e4\u05b6\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 \u2018the heart of Pharaoh was hardened.\u2019 It is to be observed however that Hebraists refer \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d4 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 jecur and \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05d4 \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 gravis to the same root. The Assyrian usage confirms this, for it seems to intermix the meanings.\n\n501. Issu. \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u New.\n\nWe read in F 25 of R plate 7 Sha bit-zu labiru inakkaru, issu ibannu, \u201cthose who had pulled down their old houses and built new ones.\u201d In 2 R 46, 11 there is mention of a ship which is \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u or old, and of one which is \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u or new. The Assyrian translation of these terms is \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u labirtu \u2018old\u2019 and \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u issitu \u2018new.\u2019\n\n502. Issut. \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u Newness. A word of very frequent occurrence.\n\nBellino l. 20. Nagu suatu ana issuti azbat, \u2018that city I built again.\u2019\n\n503. Issish. \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u Newly. Occurs very frequently.\n\nPhill. ii, 41. The temple of Tara to the Sun and Moon my lords newly I built (issish ebos). The Sun and Moon are \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u.\n\nThis adverb is also spelt \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u ex. gr. Assipar(? ramani-su issish ibannu \u201che built it newly, according to his own plan(? )\u201d where issish is rendered in Accadian by \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u \u1e2aa\u1e63\u1e63u.\nI do not think it has been observed by students, that adverbs are formed in the Accadian language by adding \\textit{ka}. Of this I have collected numerous examples.\n\n504. Bilut. \\textit{ka} Lordship. Sovereignty. \\textit{sha bilut Sumir u Akkad ramana's stirra}, who the government of Sumir and Akkad had turned to himself. Sen. T. iv. 36. I give this example on account of the unusual spelling. Norris (dict., p. 147 l. 5) first pointed out that \\textit{ka} has lost for one of its values. See another proof of the same in the next article \\textit{Ilut}.\n\n505. Ilut. \\textit{ka} Divinity. The word is very common but I have only once met with it thus written. \\textit{Ilut-ka} 'thy divinity.' The Accadian version agrees.\n\n506. Padi. \\textit{ka} Sceptre (see No. 435). As this is an important word I will give another example, taken from one of the tablets. \"O Father, creator of gods and men....... Proclaimer of my Sovereignty! Giver of my sceptre!...........\"\n\nThe original ha-\\textit{Nabu surru}, \\textit{natan padi} (\\textit{ka} \\textit{padi}). The final \\textit{i} is the pronoun, for the Accadian version adds \\textit{mu} (my) in both instances.\n\nThe spelling \\textit{Pada} is also found, \\textit{ex gr.} \"The gods of heaven and earth exalted his sceptre over the races of men,\" \\textit{shurudu pada-su il kissat niri}. (Observe the preposition \\textit{II}, written \\textit{ka}).\n\n507. Kakku. A Sword (see No. 416). I will add some more examples of this word. It is written \\textit{ka} \\textit{kakku} in the Babylonian inscriptions.\n\n1. Neriglissar l. 13 \"Nebo gave him the sceptre of justice, and the god (.....) \\textit{gaburu ili} (greatest of the gods) \\textit{iddim-su kakku-su} (gave him his sword).\"\n\n2. E. I. H. iv. 50. I built a temple to the god (.....) who is the breaker of the sword of my enemies \\textit{musabir kakku nakiri-ya}. But it is written \\textit{ka} \\textit{kakku} in Assyrian inscriptions.\n\n1. 2 R 19, \\textit{Kakku sha bulukhti milammi-su} 'his sword of awful brightness' rendered in Accadian by \\textit{ka} \\textit{immini ani}.\n\n2. Same plate L 63, the Accadian \\textit{ka} \\textit{immini ani}.\nis translated Kakku kalbu sha Anu 'the great sword of Anu.' There is another example in same plate l. 61.\n\n508. Maskanati. Nets. Bulthu II in libbi-su maskanati arba, 'two of them (eagles) I caught alive in Nets.' 3 R 4 No. 4 l. 40. I think this may be the same as the Heb. maskat a Web, from plexuit, texuit: 'to weave a web, or net.' The word is found in Judges xvi, 13 (story of Samson).\n\n509. a City. This is the most usual sign for 'City.' It was sometimes pronounced Ar (Heb. urbs, oppidum), but more often Alu: a word peculiar to the Assyrians (see No. 495). In consequence of this, it has a double value when used as a mere phonetic syllable. It generally sounds Ar, of which many examples occur, but sometimes, though much more rarely, it sounds Ala. Compare Assur. p. 61 with p. 69. The land of Tabal is written in one Tapala, in the other showing that was familiarly pronounced Ala.\n\nAlussu (his city). Ituru alussun, (the gods) returned to their cities. Opp. Khors.\n\nNorris p. 554 and p. 577 thinks the plural is alan, in which I agree with him, for I find alani in the photograph of tablet 133. Speaking of fine marbles, alabaster, &c. Alani isallal sunuti \"he will plunder them from the cities.\" Here alani is rendered which proves the meaning. For isallal, spelt in the same manner, see the art. shallal, No. 461. The barbarous custom of pulling down fine buildings in order to build new ones is here alluded to.\n\nAlan (Cities) in E. I. H. vii, 31 Aramu bana alan-sun \"I raised high the building of their cities.\"\n\n510. Salim. Peace. A remarkable spelling of this word is found on the Omen tablet 3 R 59, 47. \"If the Sun and Moon, &c. &c. there will be Peace among nations\" Salim kissati.\n\n511. Sadirati. Hunter's Nets. From the Heb. to hunt (wild animals): to lay nets for (birds and\nfishes) whence \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 venatio: venator. \u201cGreat numbers of wild animals he caught in nets, or hunter's toils,\u201d as sadirati utismikk. R 28, 20.\n\n512. Urbarra. (See No. 469). That this was some great wild beast is evident from R 28, 23 where a very early monarch, Ashurnakhbal, pursues it in the chase. If not a tiger I think it is a panther or great leopard. In 2 R 49, 41 the constellations Urmak and Urbarra stand next each other.\n\n513. Gubbani. \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 Lakes, Pools, or Ponds. Heb. \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 palus, piscina, cisterna.\n\nAs eli gubbani sha mie attadi usmanni, \u201cover against pools of water I pitched my camp.\u201d (This was preparatory to crossing an arid desert). Assur. p. 269.\n\n514. Isirtu. \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 Straight. Hebrew \u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2 rectus. Assur. 235 Kharran isirtu ullus libbi tazbata ana Bit-Anna, \u201cshe took the straight road to the temple of Anna, with a joyful heart.\u201d\n\n515. Makhiri. \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 Commerce. Agrees exactly with the Hebrew \u05d9\u05d5\u05e9\u05e2 to buy or sell.\n\nAssur. 275 \u201cThey sold a camel for half a shekel of silver in the street of Commerce (or of the Merchants)\u201d \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014. \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 as \u2026\u2026.. \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03b9 isammu as bab makhiri.

Auch unter dem Titel: Einleitung in die Psychologie und Sprachwissenschaft.\n\nDer Verfasser betrachtet seine Einleitung als Erneuerung und Erweiterung seines seit l\u00e4ngerer Zeit vergriffenen Werkes \u201eGrammatik, Logik und Psychologie\u201c. Haupts\u00e4chlich ist hier der Abschnitt desselben, der dort den eigentlichen Schwerpunkt des Ganzen bildet, nicht blo\u00df beinahe um das Doppelseite erweitert, sondern auch durch die Grundz\u00fcge einer psychologischen Mechanik begr\u00fcndet worden. Die positive Darlegung des Verh\u00e4ltnisses der Logik zur Grammatik konnte hier noch nicht gegeben werden; denn sie setzt eine genauere Darstellung der Grammatik voraus. Die folgenden Abschnitte des fr\u00fcheren Werkes: \u201eDie Grammatik\u201c, ihre \u201ePrincipien\u201c und Hauptpunkte\u201c, endlich \u201edie Verschiedenheit der Sprachen\u201c bilden den Gegenstand des zweiten Theiles der allgemeinen Sprachwissenschaft. Die neue Bearbeitung dieses Theiles, der bisher durch die Charakteristik der haupts\u00e4chlichsten Typen des Sprachbaues vertreten war, soll in zwei oder drei B\u00e4nden zun\u00e4chst die Sprachst\u00e4mme ethnologisch charakterisieren, besonders aber den indogermanischen Typus ausf\u00fchrlich darstellen und dann die Geschichte der Sprachen, besonders des Griechischen, Lateinischen und Deutschen enthalten.\n\nGrimm (Jacob), Ueber den Ursprung der Sprache. Aus den Abhandlungen der k\u00f6niglichen Akademie der Wissenschaften vom Jahre 1851. Sechste Auflage. 1866. 8. geh. 10 Sgr.\n\nZeitschrift f\u00fcr V\u00f6lkerpsychologie und Sprachwissenschaft.\n\nHerausgegeben von Prof. Dr. M. Lazarus und Prof. Dr. H. Steinthal. Erster bis siebenter Band (1859 bis 1872). gr. 8. Preis des Bandes von 4 Heften (von ca. 8 Bogen) 3 Thlr.\n\nDie Aufgabe, welche sich diese Zeitschrift gestellt hat, ist im Allgemeinen: eine Erkenntniss des Volksgesistes zu bereiten, wie die bisherige Psychologie eine des individuellen Geistes erstrebte. Es soll die Geschichte der Menschheit, der einzelnen V\u00f6lker und ihrer Bestrebungen, nicht nur als Thatache kennen gelernt, sondern auch nach ihren innersten Gr\u00fcnden\nbegriffen werden. Demnach kann alles, was im Verlauf der Geschichte als Saat oder Frucht, als Bedingung oder Erfolg des \u00f6ffentlichen Geisteslebens sich darstellt, Gegenstand des Betrachtung dieser Zeitschrift werden, alle Arten von Streubungen und Leistungen der Culturlebens bis hinauf zu den Ideen, welche den Genius einer Nation erf\u00fcllen und bewegen.\n\nDie Sprache ist diejenige Erscheinung im Leben eines Volksgeistes, \u00fcber welche uns die Thatsachen am vollkommensten vorliegen, und aus der mannigfaltige Lichtstrahlen auf andere Gebiete desselben geworfen werden. Die Sprachwissenschaft, wie sie hier bearbeitet werden soll, verschieden von Philologie und rein empirischer Linguistik, hat auf dem Wege der exacten Forschung vornehmlich die psychologischen Gesetze zu begr\u00fcnden, nach welchen die Idee der Sprache sich im Menschen verwirklicht. Die Zeitschrift wird von \u00fcbersichtlichen Darstellungen eigenth\u00fcmlicher Sprachbildungen, Charakteristiken der verschiedenen Sprachst\u00e4mme oder einzelner Sprachen oder auch besonderer Gruppen von Formen, wie z. B. Verbal-Formen ausgehend, zu allgemeinen sprachwissenschaftlichen Aufs\u00e4tzen \u00fcbergreifen, in welchen durch Thatsachen aus den verschiedenen Sprachen psychologische Gesetze entweder gewonnen oder unterst\u00fctzt werden.\n\nEin Verzeichniss der selbst\u00e4ndigen und gr\u00f6sseren Arbeiten in den bisher erschienenen B\u00e4nden findet sich S. 33 d.

Der Zweck der darin gef\u00fchrten Untersuchungen ist ein doppelter. Wenn einerseits nachgewiesen wird, dass die indogermanischen Sprachen in den von ihnen ausgebildeten Sprachformen entweder eine vollkommene Identit\u00e4t zeigen oder zur Darstellung derselben sich verwandter Mittel bedienen, ist andererseits das unabl\u00f6sige Streben des Verfassers darauf gerichtet, der Entstehung und Bedeutung dieser Sprachformen auf die Spur zu kommen und so den Organismus des Sprachk\u00f6rpers zu erkennen. Dient die erstere dieser engverkn\u00fcpften Richtungen vorz\u00fcglich dazu, die Geschichte der Sprache aufzuhellen, so sucht die andere das Wesen derselben zu ergr\u00fcnden, d. h. in der letzten Instanz den Schleier zu l\u00fcften, welcher das Verh\u00e4ltniss zwischen dem Gedanken und dem lautlichen Ausdruck desselben bedeckt h\u00e4lt.\n\nDer Druck der neuen (dritten) Auflage wurde noch unter den Augen des verewigten Verfassers begonnen und von einem Sch\u00fcler desselben \u00fcberwacht. Nach dem Hinscheiden des Verfassers hat Herr Prof. Kuhn die G\u00fcte gehabt die Oberaufsicht \u00fcber den Druck zu \u00fcbernehmen.\nDie \u201eBeitr\u00e4ge\u201c, die gewisserma\u00dfen als Erg\u00e4nzungshefte f\u00fcr die \u201eZeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung\u201c zu betrachten sind, haben sich der Mitarbeiternart der ausgezeichnetsten Gelehrten zu erfreuen. Obwohl die meisten Arbeiten den weiten Kreis der indogermanischen Sprachen behandeln, werden das Lateinische, Griechische und Deutsche keineswegs ausgeschlossen. Die \u201eBeitr\u00e4ge\u201c bilde somit eine unentbehrliche Erg\u00e4nzung der Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung.\n\nDelbr\u00fcck (B.), Ablativ Localis Instrumentalis im Alt-indischen, Griechischen, Lateinischen, Deutschen.

Zu diesem\nBehufe unterschied und verglich er innerhalb des Lettischen alle Dialekte\ngenau und zog zur Vergleichung auch die n\u00e4chstverwandten Sprachen,\nnamentlich das Littauische und Slavische, f\u00fcr die Erkl\u00e4rung des Lettischen\nherbei.

Um die \u00dcbereinstimmung beider Sprachen hinsichtlich ihres Accentuationsverfahrens in allen Einzelheiten nachzuweisen, war es notwendig den ganzen Sprachorganismus in Betracht zu ziehen, so dass die obige Schrift ausser der vergleichenden Accentuationslehre, die ihre eigentliche Bestimmung ist, auch die Grundz\u00fcge einer vergleichenden Formenlehre der betreffenden Sprachen darbietet, wobei es nicht vermieden werden konnte, gelegentlich auch anderen Gliedern der indo-europ\u00e4ischen Sprachfamilie einen Blick zuzuwenden. Am ausf\u00fchrlichsten ist die Wortbildung behandelt worden und am Schlusse eine tabellarische Zusammenstellung der gewonnenen Resultate gegeben, wodurch Jeder leicht zu der \u00dcberzeugung gelangen wird, dass in diesem Theile der Grammatik die Jahrtausende, welche das Griechische vom Sanskrit trennen, es nicht vermocht haben, in Bezug auf Form und Betonung in der einen oder anderen der verglichenen Sprachen solche \u00c4nderungen hervorzubringen, die nur einen augenblicklichen Zweifel an der urspr\u00fcnglichen Identit\u00e4t derselben veranlassen k\u00f6nnten.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ueber einige Demonstrativst\u00e4mme und ihren Zusammenhang mit verschiedenen Pr\u00e4positionen und Conjunctionen im Sanskrit und den mit ihm verwandten Sprachen. 1830. gr. 4. 7\u00bd Sgr.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Ueber den Einfluss der Pronomina auf die Wortbildung im Sanskrit und den mit ihm verwandten Sprachen. 1832. gr. 4. 7\u00bd Sgr.\n\nGrimm (Jacob), Ueber die Vertretung m\u00e4nnlicher durch weibliche Namensformen.

Hierdurch f\u00e4llt nicht selten Licht auf die \u00e4lteste Geschichte der europ\u00e4ischen Volksst\u00e4mme und namentlich auf den Zusammenhang derselben in der Periode ihrer Sprachbildung.\n\nDurch die Beschr\u00e4nkung auf eine kleinere Zahl von Sprachen wird der Vorteil erreicht, die einzelnen Sprachen sch\u00e4rfer zu erfassen, als es bei der Ausdehnung \u00fcber ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Gebiet m\u00f6glich w\u00e4re; f\u00fcr die gew\u00e4hlten Sprachen aber entscheid man sich, weil sie unter den indogermanischen zu der reichsten Entwicklung gelangt sind.\n\nGesammtregister zu den ersten zehn B\u00e4nden der Zeitschrift f\u00fcr vergleichende Sprachforschung auf dem Gebiete des Deutschen, Griechischen und Lateinischen.

Er dehnt aber den Kreis der Vergleichung auch auf die klassischen Sprachen und endlich selbst auf die semitischen aus.

Abgesehen von dem Nutzen, den eine derartige Vergleichung nach dieser Seite hin gew\u00e4hrte, ist es aber auch an und f\u00fcr sich interessant, die wesentlichen der mittelalterlichen Kunstlyrik verschiedener L\u00e4nder gemeinsamen Z\u00fcge zu verfolgen, und auch hierauf waren die Bem\u00fchungen des Herausgebers gerichtet.\n\nDas Glossarium endlich ist dazu bestimmt, minder Ge\u00fcbten das Studium einer veralteten Sprache zu erleichtern, ohne deren gr\u00fcndliche Erforschung die Kenntnis des Neufranz\u00f6sischen l\u00fcckenhaft bleiben m\u00fcsse.

Nicht nur sind die grammatischen Formen und ihre graphische Darstellung bis in die kleinsten Details wiedergefunden, sondern auch mit reichlichen Beispielen unterst\u00fctzt worden, welche sich dem Verf. in allen Museen Europas und in \u00c4gypten in F\u00fclle darboten. Um die Einheit des Ganzen und die Branchbarkeit f\u00fcr das Studium des \u00c4gyptischen zu erh\u00f6hen, hat der Verf. \u00fcberall die etwaige entsprechende hieroglyphische Form (mit steter Hinweisung auf die Grammaire \u00e9gyptienne Champollion's d. J.) in Parallele gestellt und nat\u00fcrlich als Hauptbeweismittel f\u00fcr die Richtigkeit der gewonnenen grammatischen Bedeutung das Koptische herbeigezogen, gest\u00fctzt auf die Grammatiken Peyron's, vorz\u00fcglich aber Schwartz's. Um ein Beispiel f\u00fcr die Ausdehnung der gewonnenen Formen zu geben, welche im Vergleich mit Champollion's eben genannter hieroglyphischer Grammatik weit \u00fcber dieselbe hinausgeht, so bemerken wir, dass vom Verbum allein achtzehn verschiedene Formen aufgefunden worden sind, w\u00e4hrend deren Zahl im Hieroglyphischen kaum die H\u00e4lfte davon \u00fcbersteigt.\n\nZehn Tafeln geben die genauesten und treuesten Facsimiles von verschiedenen demotischen Inschriften aus den Museen von Paris, Leyden, Turin, Dresden und aus \u00c4gypten.\n\nDie Verlagsbuchhandlung hat zu diesem Werke die ganze demotische Schrift in mehr als dreihundert Haupttypen schneiden und gie\u00dfen lassen, wor\u00fcber das folgende \u201eM\u00e9moire\u201c Auskunft zu geben bestimmt ist.\nBrugsch (Dr. H.), M\u00e9moire sur la reproduction imprim\u00e9e des caract\u00e8res de l'ancienne \u00e9criture d\u00e9motique des \u00c9gyptiens, au moyen de types mobiles et de l'imprimerie. 1855. kl. 4. geh. 7\u00bd Sgr.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 Inscriptio Rosettana hieroglyphica vel interpretatio decreti Rosettani sacra lingua litterisque sacris veterum Aegyptiorum redactae partis.

Dabei erstreckt sie sich \u00fcber alle drei koptische Dialecte in gleicher Weise. Was ihr aber den gr\u00f6\u00dften Vorzug gibt, ist die vergleichend-genetische Methode, welche vom Verfasser mit Scharfsinn und Umsicht angewandt ist. Es ist hier zum ersten Male eine wissenschaftliche Lautehre der koptischen Sprache gegeben, welche die sichere Basis f\u00fcr die Formenlehre bildet.

Worauf es dem Verfasser ankam, das war, in den Sprachen ein Abbild des Bewusstseins der Neger nach seinem Inhalt und vorz\u00fcglich nach seiner Form aufzuweisen. Die Lautlehre durfte nicht fehlen und ist nach der strengen Methode der neuen vergleichenden Sprachforschung bearbeitet. Es wird aber weiter aus der Lautform die innere Form gedeutet. Sowohl die Begriffsbildung als auch die psychischen Bewegungen in der Bildung der Urtheile werden aus der Wort- und Satzlehre entwickelt, wie sie sich eigenth\u00fcmlich im Geiste des Negers gestaltet haben. Da Niemandem zugemuthet werden durfte, da\u00df Lust habe, die Neger-Sprachen auch ged\u00e4chtnissm\u00e4\u00dfig zu erlernen, so ist die Darstellung so eingerichtet, da\u00df es m\u00f6glich ist, ohne Belastung des Ged\u00e4chtnisses jene Sprachen in dem Princip ihrer Gestaltung und Wirkung zu erfassen.\nZweite Abtheilung.\n\nLiteraturgeschichte, Mythologie, Sagengeschichte, Sitten und V\u00f6lkerkunde.\n\nSteinthal (H.), Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaft bei den Griechen und R\u00f6mern, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf die Logik. 1863. gr. 8. geh. 3 Thlr. 25 Sgr.\n\nNach der allgemeinen Einleitung, in welcher Wesen und Beziehungen der Geschichte, sowie die Keime der Sprachwissenschaft bei verschiedenen V\u00f6lkern dargelegt werden, wird zun\u00e4chst die Geschichte der Sprachbe- trachtung bei den Philosophen gegeben und dann die Stellung der Grammatiker im Zusammenhange mit dem allgemeinen Geiste der Griechen in der Zeit nach Alexander und mit der Entwicklung des griechischen Geistes \u00fcberhaupt dargelegt. Hierauf wird das Object, an welchem sich die griechische Grammatik entwickelte, n\u00e4mlich die Sprache der alten Classiker und im Gegens\u00e4tze zu ihr die sp\u00e4tere Sprache, endlich die Eigenth\u00fcmlichkeit des Textes der homerischen Dichtungen, im Verh\u00e4ltnisse zur grammatischen Th\u00e4tigkeit charakterisiert, wobei das Wesen der vielbesprochenen \u039a\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03ae ausf\u00fchrlicher zu bestimmen versucht wird. Dann folgt der Versuch einer gr\u00fcndlichen Darstellung des Kampfes f\u00fcr und gegen die Analogie und Anomalie. Endlich wird die Grammatik der Alten sowohl nach ihrem allgemeinen Geiste, als auch nach ihren wesentlichen Ergebnissen im Einzelnen angef\u00fchrt, insofern letztere entweder an sich wichtig sind oder als die Verwirklichung grammatischer Ideen zu gelten haben.\n\nBastian (X., Med. et Phil.
