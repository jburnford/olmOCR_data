Tenison-Woods, F.G.S., F.L.S., Hon. Mem.\nRoy. As. Soc. (Straits Branch).\n\n(Plates XXVII.-XXX.)\n\nDefinition of the Region.\u2014The species included in the following list are those indigenous to the Malay Peninsula in the states south of Keddah and the Indian Archipelago, exclusive of New Guinea. With the exception of the arbitrary line dividing the Malay Peninsula, the limits of this region form a province in natural history in the molluscan sub-kingdom. The reason for excluding New Guinea is that its fauna seems to belong more to the Pacific and Australian regions. The Philippine Islands are not included, because they form of themselves a peculiar province with very marked features, entitling them to separate consideration.\n\nThe physical geography of the Malaysian region is another reason for considering its pulmonate mollusca separately. The region consists of an immense number of islands of varying sizes, from mere barren granite rocks to continental islands like Sumatra and Borneo. All those that are of any size are densely clothed with vegetation. The climate is very hot, moist, and varies but little. Granite is the prevailing rock, with overlying palaeozoic strata and a few outliers of Devonian limestone. There are also in Borneo and Sumatra rather extensive developments of carbonaceous sandstone and a few patches of tertiary limestone. The south-east portion of the region is made up exclusively of modern volcanic rocks.\n\nIt is known that climate, vegetation, and soil have all powerful influences in the development of the land mollusca, which live on decayed leaves and vegetation, flourishing best amid moisture and\nheat. All these conditions are found pre-eminently in the region I have specified, and perhaps in no country of the world are they more favourably united for the development of terrestrial mollusca.\n\nSoil also has a remarkable influence. Some species prefer granite formations; but the predilection of land mollusca for limestone rocks is very striking. In the Malay Peninsula there is quite a number of small isolated limestone outliers in the form of hills and table-lands, mostly of a precipitous character. These are all distinguished by an abundance of genera and species of land-shells. The restricted habitat of some is most remarkable, and each patch of limestone seems to have its own species. It has been remarked by various naturalists how few means of dispersal the land-shells have, and thus it is that we find each island with its own fauna, no matter how small it is. Some of these species are peculiar and exceptional types. It must be admitted, however, that some types are very wide-spread, such for instance, as the forms of which *Helix citrina* L., and *Bulimus perversus* L., are the types.\n\nIt is highly probable that we have in the Malay Peninsula and its islands the remains of a very ancient continent. None of the younger formations have any place except in Sumatra and Borneo. At any rate there are no rocks which would justify the supposition that the region has been completely submerged within modern geological times. For these reasons, therefore, we have in the molluscan sub-kingdom a fauna of great antiquity. The circumstances also favour the restriction of species, because the land is so broken up into islands. Thus specific peculiarities become propagated and restricted. It may be said, in keeping with this, that though the species or varieties of the region are very numerous, yet the types are comparatively few. I take here the opportunity of noting that though I give a list of all the species enumerated by various authors known to me, I am very far from endorsing their views as to the value of the specific distinctions in any case. Probably the number of species, and even the genera, will admit of extensive reduction hereafter. In\nlooking through a large collection with every gradation of shape and colour between one species and another, one cannot help being struck with the slender evidence on which some species rest. One is inclined to say that the species are comparatively few, but the variations are great in extent and endless in number.\n\nNevertheless, there are certain peculiar genera which stamp a character on the region, besides certain abnormal species. The facies of the region is Indian. All traces of African influences have disappeared. There is no Achatina, few Pupas, whilst Cyclostoma is beginning to take a subordinate place. Amongst the Cyclophoridae we find peculiar though wide-spread types; and amongst the Helicidae unmistakable uniformity. The individuals have all marked characters, so that a small amount of experience suffices to enable us to tell at a glance whether any individual shell is a member of the Malayan fauna.\n\nThere are in the region we are dealing with about 380 known species or varieties of land-shells divisible into the following genera:\u2014Streptaxis, Ennea, Vitrina, Helicarion, Nanina, Trochonanina, Hyalinia, Trochomorpha, Patula, Helix, Cochlostyla, Bulimus, Bulimina, Stenogyra, Rhodina, Glessula, Pupa, Hypselostoma, Clausilia, Cyclotus, Opisthoporus, Pterocyclos, Spiraculum, Cyclophorus, Leptopoma, Alycaeus, Diplommatina, Opisthostoma, Pupina, Megalomastoma, Hybocystis, Georissa. Of these the dominant genera are Nanina, Helix, Cyclophorus, Bulimus, and Clausilia. And this is the case in the Indian fauna. There is in fact the strongest resemblance between the relative proportion of certain genera in the two provinces; the difference being the complete disappearance from the Malayan Peninsula of Achatina and some other African genera. The large predominance of forms of Helix resembles India almost to the very number of species. The peculiar form of Vitrina distinguished as Nanina, but with slender claims to a generic position, is a feature shared by Ceylon, and to some extent by the Philippine Islands. Nanina is a thin, depressed, umbilicated shell, with a keel at the periphery, highly polished and with a tendency to bi-partite colouring.\nSome of the peculiar genera of this region have extraordinary organs which are not seen elsewhere. Thus *Opisthoporus* is a depressed shell furnished with a little open tube behind the mouth. *Pterocyclos* has an almost similar tube formed by a notch in the peristome at its junction with the superior whorl, an arrangement which is slightly modified in an allied genus named *Spiraculum*. *Alyceus* has the last whorl swollen, constricted and strongly twisted near the mouth. All these species have peculiar opercula composed of a calcareous spiral series of concentric plates. In the family Pupininae there are the strongest modifications of the last whorl which becomes twisted and constricted in the most erratic manner. In *Opisthostoma* it is elevated vertically in the air like an elephant's trunk. In *Hybocystis* we have a very peculiar form of land-shell, of which a full description is given at the end of the list. It is an approach to *Megalomastoma*, and may be said to be confined to Burmah and the Malay Peninsula.\n\nAs the limits of the region here dealt with are so little explored, no such things as sub-provinces can be made, unless it be in the way of considering each island a sub-province in itself. It is obvious to any one who considers the size and extent of any of the islands, that only a very small portion of them can have been well explored for their molluscan fauna. The total number of known species or varieties, amounting as it does to scarcely 400, can only be considered as an instalment of the actual census. The large island of Borneo alone might be expected to furnish such a number, when we remember how the climate, soil, and vegetation of this region favour the development of the molluscan fauna. Yet the species of Borneo can scarcely be said to be known at all.\n\nIn dealing with the genera and species of the various authors, it has already been stated that the specific or generic value in any individual case is a matter for which the authors themselves are alone responsible. Yet it must be borne in mind that the difficulty of dealing with some of the larger genera renders sub-division of some kind absolutely necessary. Thus in the immense genus\nHelix it is no use to catalogue species without adopting sectional divisions, which has been done in the present list. It must be admitted that they are not easy to identify, as the features are so feeble, and there is so little to go upon. Still the sections may be of some assistance, and they are meant to have no higher value in classification.\n\nWith the genera it is different, and except in such a case as Nanina the divisions are well marked, and can hardly be mistaken one for another. In the smaller genera the features are very pronounced, that is genera small in point of numbers, not of size. I believe it may further be said that all the species of the genera Trochomorpha, Bulimus, Cyclotus, Cyclophorus and Alycaeus, though perhaps not well distinguished from one another, are referable to a type which has certain well-defined geographical limits. With a little experience a species of Cyclophorus, for instance from the Malayan Peninsula, could be easily recognized as belonging to the region; but it would require a prolonged familiarity to distinguish between the characteristic types of the various islands, as for instance Java and Sumatra. The Bornean shells are easily recognized, though there are strong resemblances to the types of the Philippine Islands.\n\nAmongst the shells enumerated there is no foreign element. No molluscan animals, as far as it is known, have been introduced from foreign regions, and become naturalized in the region now described; but the large introduction of European and Chinese plants will alter this state of things before long, if it has not done so already.\n\nThe following list has been taken from various sources. No special study has ever been made of the land mollusca of the Malayan Archipelago. But owing to the labours of Pfeiffer and Albers, the task of compiling this list has been very much facilitated. The whole references in the case of every species have not been given. As far as possible the references are made to three or four of the most easily accessible works, where more than one author has given a description. The work of Pfeiffer\n(\"Monographia Heliceorum Viventium,\" 8 vols.), is taken as the standard, but corrected according to his most recent determinations of species before his decease as contained in \"Nomenclator Heliceorum Viventium.\" These works with his \"Monographia Pneumonopomorum Viventium,\" may be said to contain nearly all that has been done in this department of natural science. All that one requires in addition are the essays of Nevill, Benson, De Morgan, von M\u00f6llendorff and Hungerford, and these are principally contained in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Calcutta branch.\n\nTo facilitate reference, a catalogue of works, mentioning species quoted in the list, is given. It is not by any means intended as an exhaustive bibliography of the subject, but it is hoped that no author is omitted who has described any Malayan land shell. It may be necessary to add that I have not been able to verify the references of every species, which of course would impose a vast amount of labour, and enormously increase the time required for the preparation of the catalogue. But in a great many instances, perhaps the majority, I have consulted the original authors especially in the case of the older conchologists.\n\nIt should be mentioned that Pfeiffer's nomenclature of the families has been adopted, following also his orthography.\n\nLAND MOLLUSCA.\n\nFamily STREPTAXID\u00c6.\n\n1.

HELIX, Linn\u00e6us.\n\nShell of variable form, smooth, rugose, striate, ribbed or tuberculate, sometimes pilose; orbicular-convex, planorboid, trochiform, sub-turricated, or short bulimiform (monstrosities sinistral, or with the whorls more or less uncoiled); aperture oblique, oval,\nor semilunar, with or without interior teeth on the margin or parietal wall; lip simple or thickened internally or reflected; umbilicus covered to widely open.\n\nAnimal capable of complete retraction within the shell; the jaw finely striate, or ribbed, sulcate, or plicate.\n\nRadula:\u2014central teeth tricuspid, laterals bicuspid or tricuspid, with an obsolete internal cusp; marginals usually wider than high, short, with two or three small cusps.\n\nDistribution:\u2014world-wide; about 3,400 species known. Pfeiffer, Albers, Beck, Swainson, F\u00e9ussac, Tryon, H. and A. Adams, and others have proposed a great number of groups in which it is generally found that similar ones have a similar geographical distribution. Unfortunately there has been a lamentable want of consent amongst these and other authors as to the grouping, and there is no accepted system which is followed by the generality of conchologists; it would seem in fact as if each one had his own. In this list the system of Pfeiffer is followed, who makes 86 sections and 67 sub-sections.\n\nSection 22, Hygromia. Sub-section 1, Fruticola.\n\nHelix miliacea, von Mart. = H. milium, von Mart.

Dr. Hungerford has some doubts about its being a *Geotrochus*, a group which has not yet been observed in the Indian region.

Between 300 and 400 species, mostly South American.\u2020\n\n* It cannot be questioned that Scopoli rather than Adanson should be given as the authority for this genus, although the author of the work referred to in the text says distinctly, \"Proprium itaque ex his constituo, et duce celeberrimo Adansonio Bulimos voco, ut eo facilius adnoscantur. Solam testam nec animal inhabitans vidi, quod diversum esse \u00e0 Limace affirmat Adansonius.\" p. 67.\n\nCf. Histoire Naturelle du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal (Paris, 1757), where M. Adanson writes the name Bulin. The Latin (?) name on pl. 1 looks very much like Bulimus in consequence of the strokes of the \"n\" and \"u\" being confused. A brief account of this curious work may be useful. It is divided into two parts; the first of 190 pages is devoted to the \"Voyage au S\u00e9n\u00e9gal;\" the second part is a \"Histoire des Coquillages,\" consisting of:\n\n1. Pr\u00e9face, 28 pp.; 2. D\u00e9finitions des parties des coquillages, 32 pp. (a most useful series of observations well deserving of study); 3. Table des rapports ou des combinaisons autrement appel\u00e9es syst\u00e8mes ou arrangements m\u00e9thodiques, 26 pp.; 4. Table chronologique des auteurs, 4 pp.; 5. Division g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, 4 pp.; 6. Coquillages (including index), 275 pp.; 7. Plates, 19 pp. At p. 5 of the Coquillages is a full description which extends to three pages of Le Bulin or Bulinus, from which only the first sentence need be cited, as it shows the author is dealing with a fresh-water shell. \"Je donne le nom de Bulin \u00e0 un petit coquillage d'eau douce, qui vit commun\u00e9ment sur la lentille de marais et sur le lemma, dans les marais et les \u00e9tangs de Podor.\" Therefore Scopoli's genus, spelled differently, is justly regarded as new.\n\n\u2020 It is a curious feature in the Philippine and some of the Malay species that the varieties of pattern, which constitute their chief ornament, reside only in the epidermis. The colours of the shell rarely describe any sort of configuration; they are mostly blended into a uniform tint, over which a fanciful pattern is produced by the epidermis forming a double porous membrane in some places, and a single one only in others, developed, moreover, with the same continuous regularity as the textile marking of a Volute or Cone. This phenomenon is easily detected by immersing the shell in water, when the light portion or upper porous layer of epidermis becomes saturated, and the ground color of the shell is seen through it; as the moisture evaporates, the epidermis resumes its light appearance. Sir David Brewster, in reply to a letter from Mr. Broderip on this subject, says: \"It appears to me, from very careful observations, that the epidermis consists of two layers, and that it is only the upper layer which is porous wherever the pattern is white. These white or porous portions of the\nSection Amphidromus.\n\nBulimus loricatus, Pfr. Proc. Zool. Soc. 1854, p. 293; (Amphidromus) Pfr. Vers. p. 147; Mon. Hel.

Sub-umbilicate, ovate, oblong, often sinistral, colour various, but generally uniformly light green, lemon yellow, or white; or marked variously with spots or bands, such as a deep brown oblique streak, white with red spot, red lip, white lip, variously spotted with a bluish throat. This well-known and widely-spread shell which is found all through the Archipelago (Borneo?), Malay Peninsula, Moluccas and Burmah, was known to the early conchologists, twelve authorities being quoted by Linnaeus for this species and B. dextra, which is evidently a variety. It is unnecessary to reproduce the authorities which occupy nearly two pages of Pfeiffer's Mon. Hel. (Vol. III. p. 308). It is very common about Malacca, and on wet days especially may be gathered off the leaves of the trees where it is with difficulty distinguished on account of the similarity of its colour. Without quoting authorities, it may be mentioned that it has been known by the following names:\u2014Bulimus, Helix, Limax, Orthostylus, perversa, dextra, sinistra, atricalllosa, interrupta, aurea, citrina, sultana, javanica, macassariensis.\n\nB. leucoxarthus, von Mart. = B. leucoxanthus, von Mart.

I found a good many on a dead tree which had been felled in the clearing of a coffee plantation. At daybreak in the morning I generally found one or two walking about.

IV. p. 90.\n\nThis remarkable and exceedingly interesting genus, which forms one of the peculiar features of the terrestrial molluscan fauna of the Malay Peninsula, deserves the fullest details in this list. Fortunately its history as a species has been well marked out by M. P. Fischer in the \"Journal de Conchyliologie\" (XXV. 3rd series, 1885, p. 180), an epitome of whose researches will now be given.\n\nThe genus was proposed by Benson in 1859 for a Burmese shell which had been hitherto described as a species of *Megalomastoma*, and in its young stages as a species of *Otopoma*. Some years before Dr. Gould, the American naturalist, had described the same shell, for which he had proposed the generic name of *Pollicaria*; but as the genus was insufficiently defined, and included species of different genera, Benson's genus has been preferred as complying with every condition of necessary exactness.\n\nThe shell is ovoid and pupiform, but deviating from its axis in the last whorls in the manner of certain species of *Streptaxis*. The ante-penultimate whorl is much developed and flattened in\nfront above the mouth, which is sub-circular and angular anteriorly in young specimens, which also present a little canalicate prolongation, which is obliterated little by little as the animal is developed, leaving when completely closed only the appearance of a triangular area traversed longitudinally by a linear scar, and leaving in that state a rounded double peristome. Internal lip relatively less thick, deeper coloured, and more shining; external reflected, but not always perfectly united with the inner. Operculum testaceous, somewhat thick, with a central nucleus, and composed of two plates; external face multispiral, slightly concave in the middle; internal face few whorls, also slightly concave in the middle; margin with a feeble keel.\n\nThe foot is not divided as in the Cyclostomidae, where there are two longitudinal parts independent of each other for crawling. The animal is long, with a very thin mantle, whose anterior border is simple and not papillose; head and muzzle short, thick, the latter grooved transversely on its upper face; buccal orifice, when open, oval, and showing the extremity of the radula, but when the mouth is closed it is a simple slit; tentacles short, thick, transversely striate, slightly constricted at the base, of a uniform reddish color; eyes at the external base well pigmented and placed on short, obtuse, and slightly convex peduncles; foot thick, fleshy, wide, short, oval, obtuse, truncate in front, round behind. There is a large pedal sinus in front, but no trace of that longitudinal division which is common in the family of Cyclostomidae, but the foot is rather that of the family of Cyclophoridae. The upper part of the foot carries the operculum, the adherence of which is circular, with an umbilicated non-central projection, which corresponds to the nucleus of the internal face, so that half the organ is free, like the genus Cyclophorus. The sexes are distinct, the females being a little larger in size. The mouth has two mandibular plates, brown, chitinous, and solid, visible to the naked eye, but when magnified displaying a faceted structure roughly hexagonal or rounded. This may possibly be some arrangement connected with the eyes of the animal, or a faceted eye-structure like that which exists\nin the head of insects. All the Cyclophoridae have similar organs. The radula has the following formula \\((2, 1, 1, 2) \\times 66\\). It is long, a little curved at the end, but relatively shorter than amongst the most of the Cyclophoridae. The teeth are in oblique rows from the median line to the outer margin. The central teeth are a little oblong, slightly constricted in the centre like an hour-glass, and widely and roundly notched at the base. There is a central wide, short, obtuse cusp, with the rudiment of a lateral one. The first lateral teeth are larger, oblique, elongate, with a narrow base, curving over outwardly on the summit in a direction opposite to the other teeth. The free edge is bicuspid, the outer short, wide, obtuse, the inner small and short. The two marginal teeth are bicuspid, the internal cusp more feeble than the external, which is triangular.\n\nM. Fischer, in the \"Manuel de Conchyliologie,\" p. 71, gives his reasons for classing *Hyboecystis* between *Pupina* and *Cataulus*, but he admits that it differs from the majority of Cyclophoridae by its bicuspid marginal and lateral teeth, and the obtuse cusps of the median tooth. These characters united to those of the shell and of the operculum determine the genus. In the position of *Hyboecystis* Dr. Pfeiffer takes a different view, and places it in the great family of Cyclostomaceae, in the sub-family Cyclotea. Stoliczka (Jour. As. Soc. Beng. 1871, p. 150) agrees with M. Fischer.\n\nThe following is the explanation of the figures given in the plate:\n\nFig. 1.
