a Musalm\u00e1n period lasting from 1300 to about 1660; a Mar\u00e1tha period from 1660 to 1800; and a British period since 1800. The chief interest in the history of the Th\u00e1na coast is that, with comparatively few and short breaks, some one of its ports, Sop\u00e1ra, Chaul, Kaly\u00e1n, Th\u00e1na, Sanj\u00e1n, or Bombay, has, from pre-historic times, taken a leading part in the foreign commerce of Western India. From pre-historic times the Th\u00e1na coast has had relations with lands beyond the Indian Ocean. From B.C. 2500 to B.C. 500 there are signs of trade with Egypt, Ph\u0153nicia, and Babylon; from B.C. 250 to A.D. 250 there are dealings with, perhaps settlements of, Greeks and Parthians; from A.D. 250 to A.D. 640 there are Persian alliances and Persian settlements; from A.D. 700 to A.D. 1200 there are Musalm\u00e1n trade relations and Musalm\u00e1n settlements from Arabia and Persia; in 1530 there is the part conquest by the Portuguese; and in 1664 the settlement of the British. The share of the Hindus in these dealings with foreigners has by no means been confined to providing in India valued articles of trade. As far back as record remains, for courage and enterprise, as traders, settlers, and travellers both by land and by sea, the Hindus hold a high place among the dwellers on the shores of the Indian Ocean.\u00b9\n\nThe openings through the Sahy\u00e1dris by the Tal, the N\u00e1na, the M\u00e1lsej, and the Bor passes, have from the beginning of local history (B.C. 225) caused trade to centre in the Th\u00e1na ports. During these two thousand years the trade of the Th\u00e1na ports, from time to time, has varied, from a great foreign commerce to a local traffic. The trade has risen to foreign commerce when the Th\u00e1na coast has been under a power which ruled both the Konkan and the Deccan; it has shrunk to a local traffic when Th\u00e1na and the Deccan have been under different rulers.\n\n\u00b9 Of the Hindu share in the early navigation of the Indian Ocean a notice is given in Appendix A. Authorities in favour of early Hindu settlements on the coasts of Arabia and the Persian Gulf are cited in footnote 3 p. 404. The following instances, taken from one of Wilford's Essays (As. Res. X. 106, 107), point to a still wider distribution of the early Hindus; at the same time the vague use of India and Indians among Greek and Roman writers makes the application of some of these references to Hindus somewhat doubtful. Wilford notices Hindu seers in Persia and in Palestine 700 years before Christ; Hindus in the army of Xerxes B.C. 480; Hindu elephant-drivers among the Carthagians B.C. 300, and among the Romans B.C. 250; Hindu male and female servants in Greece; and Hindu merchants in Germany (B.C. 60), perhaps in England.\nThe earliest known fact in the history of the Th\u00e1na coast belongs to the third century before Christ (B.C. 225). It is the engraving of Ashok's edicts on basalt boulders at Sop\u00e1ra about six miles north of Bassein. Sop\u00e1ra must then have been the capital of the country and probably a centre of trade. The history of Sop\u00e1ra may doubtfully be traced to much earlier times. According to Buddhist writings Sop\u00e1ra was a royal seat and a great centre of commerce during the lifetime of Gautama Buddha (B.C. 540). But the story is legendary, or at least partly legendary, and there is no reason to suppose that Gautama ever left Northern India. A passage in the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1r\u00e1t describes Arjun stopping at the most holy Shurp\u00e1rak on his way to Somn\u00e1th Pattan or Ver\u00e1val in South K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and gives an account of Arjun's visit to a place full of Br\u00e1hman temples, apparently at or near the Kanheri Caves.\n\nThis early Buddhist and Br\u00e1hman fame, and the resemblance of the name to Sofer or Ophir, have raised the belief that Sop\u00e1ra is Solomon's Ophir, a famous centre of trade about a thousand years before Christ. This identification leads back to the still earlier trade between Egypt and the holy land of Punt (B.C. 2500-1600); and this to the pre-historic traffic from the Th\u00e1na coast to Persia, Arabia, and Africa.\n\n---\n\n1 Burnouf's Introduction, \u00c0 l'Histoire du Buddhisme Indien, I. 235-270.\n2 Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata (Bom. Ed.), Vanaparva, cap. 118. This passage may be an interpolation. By passages such as these the revivers of Br\u00e1hmanism (A.D. 600-1000) effaced the memory of Buddhism. The Buddhist cave temples became the work of the P\u00e1ndavs, and the two colossal rock-cut Buddhas in the great Kanheri cave became statues of Bhim the giant P\u00e1dav. At the same time the story of Purna given below (p. 406) seems to show that Kanheri was a Br\u00e1hmanic centre before it became Buddhist.\n3 Vincent (Commerce of the Ancients, II. 45, 281, 423), Heeren (Hist. Res., III. 408), and Reinaud (Abu-l-fida, clxxiv. and Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 291) hold, that by the help of the regular winds Hind\u00fas and Arabs have from pre-historic times traded from West India to Arabia, Africa, and Persia. This belief is supported by the mention in Genesis (B.C. 1700, cap. xxviii.) of Arabs trafficking in Indian spices; by the early use of Indian articles among the Egyptians (Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, Popular Edition, II. 237; Rawlinson's Herodotus, II. 64, 275; Mrs. Manning's Ancient India, II. 349; Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 602, Ed. 1874; J. Madras Lit. and Scien. 1878, 202); and, according to Wilford (As. Res. X. 100), and Lassen by the Hindu colonization of Socotra and of the east coast of Arabia. It is also supported by the mention in later times (B.C. 200; Ind. Alt. II. 586) of settlements of Ad\u00e9n Arabs on the Indian coast and of colonists in Socotra who traded with India (Agatharcides, B.C. 177, in Vincent, II. 38; and Geog. Vet. Scrip. I. 66); by the Arab form of Pliny's (A.D. 77) Ziterus or Jazro, and of Ptolemy's (A.D. 150) Melizygerus on the Konkan coast; by the correspondence of Sefareh-el-Hende and Sefareh-el-Zinge, that is Sof\u00e1la or Sop\u00e1ra in Th\u00e1na and Sof\u00e1la in Africa (Vincent, II. 281, 422); and by the statement in the Periplus (Vincent, II. 423) that the trade between India, Africa, and Arabia was much older than the time of the Greeks.\n\nWhether the early Egyptians traded to the west coast of India is doubtful. The holy land of Punt, to which as far back as B.C. 2500 the Egyptian king Sankh-ha-ra sent an expedition, was formerly (Campion's L'Egypte, I. 98) supposed to be India, but later writers place it nearer Egypt; Brugsch (Egypt Under the Pharaohs, I. 114) on the Somali coast; and Duncker (History of Antiquity, I. 150, 157, 314) in South Arabia. As early as B.C. 1600 the Egyptians had many Indian products, agates, h\u00e6matite, the lotus, indigo, pepper, cardamoms, ginger, cinnamon, and Indian muslins (Wilkinson's Ancient Egyptians, Pop. Ed., II. 237; Rawlinson's Herodotus, II. 64, 168, 173, 275); but it is doubtful whether they traded direct to India.\n\nOf the Ph\u0153nician connection with Ophir or Soph\u00e9r (B.C. 1100-850), details are given under Sop\u00e1ra. The chief exports from Ophir were gold, tin, sandalwood, cotton, nard,\nThe question of the identification of Sop\u00e1ra with Solomon's Ophir is discussed in the account of Sop\u00e1ra given under Places of Interest. As far as information goes, the identification, though not unlikely, is doubtful, and the carving of Ashok's edicts (B.C. 225) remains the earliest known fact in the history of the Th\u00e1na coast. The Mah\u00e1wanso mentions that Ashok sent Dharmarakshita, a Yavan or Greek, to preach Buddhism in Apar\u00e1nta or the Konkan, and that he lectured to 70,000 people, of whom 1000 men and more than 1000 women, all of them Kshatriyas, entered the priesthood. It\n\nbdellium, sugar, cassia or cinnamon, pepper, peacocks, apes, rice, ebony, and ivory (Max M\u00fcller's Science of Language, 190; Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 92). The imports were probably wine, slaves, clay and metal dishes, ornaments, arms, fish-purple, glass, silver, and embroidered and woven stuffs (Duncker, II. 70, 72, 73, 284-291, 306).\n\nThe connection between India and the Persian Gulf seems to pass even further back than the connection with Arabia and with Africa. The voyage is shorter, sailing in the Persian Gulf is easier, and the inland route is less barren. Babylonian tradition opens with a reference to a race who came from the southern sea, a people who brought the Babylonians their gods, and who taught them the arts. According to one account these teachers came from Egypt; according to another account the chief teacher was Andubar the Indian (Heeren's Historical Researches, II. 145; Rawlinson in J. R. A. S. [New Series] XII. 201-208, 218). Rawlinson holds that from very early times, Gerrha, on the mainland close to Bahrein island on the west shore of the gulf, was an emporium of the Indian trade, and identifies Apir an old name for Gerrha with Solomon's Ophir (Ditto, 214). The original traders seem to have been Phenicians, who, according to ancient accounts, moved from Bahrein north-west to the Mediterranean coast (Rawlinson's Herodotus, IV. 241; Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 589; Rawlinson J. R. A. S. XII. N. S. 219).\n\nThe head of the Persian Gulf seems also from very early times to have been connected by trade with India. In the ninth century before Christ, Isaiah (xliii. 14) described the Babylonians as rejoicing in their ships, and, at the close of the seventh century, Nebuchadnezar (B.C. 606-561) built quays and embankments of solid masonry on the Persian Gulf, and traded with Ceylon and Western India (Rawlinson's Herod. I. 513; Heeren, I. 415-417), sending to India fabrics of wool and linen, pottery, glass, jewels, lime, and ointment, and bringing back wood, spices, ivory, ebony, precious stones, cochineal, pearls, and gold. (Heeren's Historical Researches, II. 209, 247; Duncker, I. 305). In the sixth century before Christ the men of Dedan or Bahrein brought ebony and ivory to Tyre (B.C. 588; Ezekiel, xxvii. 15).\n\nThe Persians (B.C. 538-330) despised trade and seem to have blocked the mouths of the Tigris (Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 606; Rooke's Arrian, II. 149; Heeren, II. 247-249) and in India a trade-hating class rose to power and introduced into Manu's Code (B.C. 300) a rule making seafaring a crime (Ind. Ant. IV. 138). This clause is contrary to other provisions of the code (Heeren's Hist. Res. III. 349, 350, 359) and to the respect with which merchants are spoken of in the Rigved and the R\u00e1m\u00e1yan, and in later times by the Buddhists. (For the vigour of Hindu trade in early Vedic and R\u00e1m\u00e1yan times, see Wilson's Rigved, I. 152; Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 581; Mrs. Manning's Ancient India, II. 347; Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 122; Heeren's Hist. Res. III. 353, 366, 381. For the Buddhist respect for merchants, see Burnouf's Introduction, 250; Rhys Davids' Buddhist Birth Stories, I. 138, 149, 157; and Mrs. Manning, II. 354). This Br\u00e1hman and Persian hate of trade, especially of trade by sea, perhaps explains the decay of foreign commerce before the time of Alexander the Great (B.C. 325). In spite of all his inquiries in Sindh, and in spite of the voyage of Nearchus from Kar\u00e1chi to the Persian Gulf, one vessel, laden with frankincense, seems to have been the only sign of sea-trade at the mouths of the Indus, in the Persian Gulf, or along the east coast of Arabia. Rooke's Arrian, II. 262, 282, 285; Vincent, II. 380. The Buddhists (perhaps about B.C. 250) are mentioned as increasing the trade to Persia (Ind. Ant. II. 147). In the second and first century before Christ the old Bahrein trade revived, Gerrha on the mainland having much trade with India (Heeren, II. 100, 103, 118, 124-125). Among the chief imports were cotton and teak. These were supposed to grow at Bahrein, but almost certainly came from India (Heeren, II. 237-239).\n\n1 Turnour's Mah\u00e1wanso, 73; Bigandet's Life of Gaudama, 388; Cunningham's Bhilsa Topes, 117.\nis not known whether at the time of the mission the Konkan formed part of Ashok's empire, or was under a friendly ruler.\n\nThe Buddhist legend of Purna of Sop\u00e1ra belongs, in its present form, to the late or Mah\u00e1yan School of Buddhism (A.D. 100-400), and is so full of wonders that it is probably not earlier than the third or fourth century after Christ. Its descriptions cannot be taken to apply to any particular date. They are given here as they profess to describe the introduction of Buddhism and the state of Sop\u00e1ra at that time, and as several of the particulars agree with recent discoveries near Sop\u00e1ra.\n\nIn the legend of Purna, translated by Burnouf from Nepalese and Tibetan sources apparently of the third or fourth century after Christ, Sop\u00e1ra is described as the seat of a king, a city with several hundred thousand inhabitants, with eighteen gates and a temple of Buddha adorned with friezes of carved sandalwood. It covered a space 1000 yards in area, and its buildings and towers rose to a height of 500 feet. It was a great place of trade. Caravans of merchants came from Shr\u00e1wasti near Benares, and large ships with '500' (the stock phrase for a large number) merchants, both local and foreign, traded to distant lands. There was much risk in these voyages. A safe return was the cause of great rejoicing; two or three successful voyages made a merchant a man of mark; no one who had made six safe voyages had ever been known to tempt Providence by trying a seventh. The trade was in cloth, fine and coarse, blue yellow red and white. One of the most valued articles was the sandalwood known as goshirsh or cow's head, perhaps from the shape of the logs. This was brought apparently from the K\u00e1nares or Malab\u00e1r coast. The coinage was gold and many of the merchants had great fortunes. A strong merchant guild ruled the trade of the city.\n\nAt this time the religion of the country was Br\u00e1hmanism. There were large nunneries of religious widows, monasteries where seers or rishis lived in comfort in fruit and flower gardens, and bark-clad hermits who lived on bare hill-tops. The gods on whom the laymen called in times of trouble were Shiv, Varuna, Kubera, Shakra, Brahma, Hari, Shankar, and divinities, apparently m\u00e1ticas or Devis. Besides the gods many supernatural beings, Asuras, Mahoragas, Y\u00e1kshas, and D\u00e1navs were believed to have power over men for good or for evil.\n\nPurna, the son of a rich Sop\u00e1ra merchant and a slave girl, whose worth and skill had raised him to be one of the leading merchants of Sop\u00e1ra, turned the people of the Konkan from this old faith to Buddhism. Sailing with some Benares merchants to the land of\n\n---\n\n1 Apparently Ashok addressed his edicts to countries where he did not rule. One copy of the edicts was addressed to the people of Chola, Pida, Kerala, and Tambrapani. Tennent's Ceylon, I. 368.\n2 The wonders worked by Buddha and the furniture of the monasteries, seats, tapestries figured cushions and carved pedestals, point to a late date.\n3 Trading companies are mentioned in Y\u00e1jnavalkya's Code, b.c. 300. Oppert in Madras Journal (1873), 194.\n4 Burnouf, 256, 264.\n5 It is interesting to note that, though at first despised as the son of a slave girl, when Purna proved himself able and successful, the merchants of Sop\u00e1ra sought him in marriage for their daughters. Burnouf, 249.\nthe sandal tree, Purna was delighted by the strange songs which they chanted morning and evening. They were not songs, the merchants told him, but the holy sayings of Buddha. On his return to Sop\u0101ra Purna gave up his merchant's life and went to Benares, where Gantama received him into the Buddhist priesthood. He urged that he might be allowed to preach to the people of the Konkan. The people of the Konkan had the worst name for fierceness, rudeness, and cruelty. Buddha feared that the patience of so young a disciple might not be proof against their insults. Purna, he said, the men of the Konkan are fierce, cruel, and unmannerly. When they cover you with evil and coarse abuse, what will you think of them? If the men of the Konkan cover me with evil and coarse abuse, I shall think them kindly and gentle people for abusing me instead of cuffing or stoning me. They are rough overbearing fellows those men of the Konkan. What will you think of them, Purna, if they cuff you or stone you? If they cuff me or stone me, I shall think them kindly and gentle for using hands and stones instead of staves and swords. They are a rough set, Purna, those men of the Konkan. If they beat you with staves and cut you with swords, what will you think of them? If they beat me with staves or cut me with swords, I shall think them a kindly people for not killing me outright. They are a wild people, Purna, if they kill you outright what will you think of them? If they kill me outright, I shall think the men of the Konkan kindly and gentle, freeing me with so little pain from this miserable body of death. Good, Purna, good, so perfect a patience is fit to dwell in the Konkan, even to make it its home. Go Purna, freed from evil free others, safe over the sea of sorrow help others to cross, comforted give comfort, in perfect rest guide others to rest.\n\nPurna goes to the Konkan, and, while he wanders about begging, he is met by a countryman who is starting to shoot deer. The hunter sees the ill-omened shaven-faced priest, and draws his bow to shoot him. Purna throws off his outer robe and calls to the hunter, 'Shoot, I have come to the Konkan to be a sacrifice.' The hunter, struck by his freedom from fear, spares his life and becomes his disciple. The new religion spreads. Many men and women adopt a religious life, and '500' monasteries are built and furnished with hundreds of beds, seats, tapestries, figured cushions, and carved pedestals.\n\nPurna becomes famous. A body of merchants in danger of shipwreck call on him for help, and he appears and stills the storm. On their return the merchants build a Buddhist temple in Sop\u0101ra.\n\n---\n\n1 The word used is Shron-Apar\u0101nta or Sunapar\u0101nta. Apar\u0101nta, the behind or western land, is admitted to be the Konkan. The following suggestion is offered in explanation of Shron. The fact of a Greek or Yavan element in the coast population seems probable, from the Greek trade with the country, from the mention of Yavans in several of the West Indian cave inscriptions, and from the fact that the Apostle whom Ashok chose to preach Buddhism in the Konkan, and his viceroy in K\u0101thi\u0101war (Ind. Ant. VII. 257), were Yavans. Shron may then be Son or Sonag, a word for Yavan still in use in Southern India (Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 5), and of which Son the name for the coast and part-foreign Kolis of Th\u0101na may be a trace. Hardy (Manual of Buddhism, Sec. Ed. 215, 536) seems to think Son was a later name, and that the correct form was Yon and is connected with Hun.\n\n2 Burnouf's Introduction, 254.\nPurna asks Buddha to honour the temple with his presence. He comes, with his chief disciples, flying through the air. On his way, apparently near Sop\u0101ra, he stops at several places. At one of these places live '500' widows, whom Buddha visits and converts. In answer to their prayer he gives them some of his hair and his nails, and they build a mound or stupa over them. The spirit of the Jetvan wood, who had come with Buddha from Benares, plants a branch of the vakul or Mimusops elengi tree in the yard near the stupa, and the stupa is worshipped, by some under the name of the Widows' Stupa, and by others under the name of the Vakul stupa. This second name is interesting from its resemblance to the Vak\u0101l or Brahma Tekri, a holy hill about a mile to the south of Sop\u0101ra, which is covered with tombs and has several P\u0101li inscriptions of about the second century before Christ.\n\nAccompanied by the '500' widows Buddha visited another hermitage full of flowers, fruit, and water, where lived '500' monks. Drunk with the good things of this life these seers or rishis thought of nothing beyond. Buddha destroyed the flowers and fruit, dried the water, and withered the grass. The seers in despair blamed Bhagavat for ruining their happy life. By another exercise of power, he brought back their bloom to the wasted fruits and flowers, and its greenness to the withered grass. The seers became his disciples, and with the '500' widows of Vakul passed with Buddha, through the air, to the hill of Musala. On Musala hill there lived a seer or rishi, who was known as Vakkali or the bark-robe wearer. This rishi saw Buddha afar off, and, on seeing him, there rose in his heart a feeling of goodwill. He thought to himself, shall I come down from this hill and go to meet Buddha, for he doubtless is coming here intending to convert me. Why should not I throw myself from the top of this hill? The seer threw himself over the cliff, and Buddha caught him, so that he received no hurt. He was taught the law and became a disciple, gaining the highest place in his master's trust. This passage has the special interest of apparently referring to the sage Musala, who lived on the top of Padan rock near Goregaon station, about eighteen miles south of Sop\u0101ra. From the Musala rock Buddha went to Sop\u0101ra, which had been cleaned and beautified, and a guard stationed at each of its eighteen gates. Fearing to offend the rest by choosing any one guard as his escort, Buddha flew through the air into the middle of the city. He was escorted to the new temple adorned with friezes of carved sandalwood, where he taught the law and converted 'hundreds of thousands.' While in Sop\u0101ra Buddha became aware of the approach of the N\u0101ga kings Krishna and Gautama. They came on the waves of the sea with '500' N\u0101gas. Buddha knew that if the N\u0101gas entered Sop\u0101ra the city would be destroyed. So he went to meet them, and converted them to his faith.\n\n1 Details are given in Places of Interest, Ghoregaon, and Appendix, Padan.\n2 Burnouf's Introduction, \u00c0 l'Histoire du Buddhisme Indien, 234-275. Purna rose to the highest rank. He became a Bodhisattva or potential Buddha, and in future times will appear as Buddha. Perhaps, but this is doubtful, he is Maitreya or the next Buddha (see Appendix to Places of Interest). Purna's story is given with much the same details as by Burnouf in Hardy's Manual of Buddhism, 58, 267, and in St. Hilaire's Buddhism, 152-154.\nThe relics found in the Sop\u00e1ra mound show, that in the second century after Christ Sop\u00e1ra had workers of considerable skill and taste. The bricks are of excellent material and the large stone coffin is carefully made, the lines are clear and exact, and the surface is skilfully smoothed. The crystal casket is also prettily shaped and highly finished. The brass gods are excellent castings, sharper and truer than modern Hindu brassware. The skill of the gold and silver smiths is shown in the finely stamped silver coin, in the variety and grace of the gold flowers, and in the shape and tracery of the small central gold casket.\n\nShort P\u00e1li inscriptions found on the Vak\u00e1l or Brahma hill, about two miles south of Sop\u00e1ra, seem to show that about B.C. 200 the tribe of the Kodas or Kottas, who seem about that time to have been ruling near Mirat and afterwards (A.D. 190) near Patna, had a settlement at Sop\u00e1ra.\n\nUnder Ashok the west coast of India was enriched by the opening of a direct sea-trade with Egypt, and apparently eastwards with the great Deccan trade centre of Tagara. But the direct trade with Egypt was never large, and it centred at Broach, not at Sop\u00e1ra.\n\nThe next dynasty known to have been connected with the Th\u00e1na coast are the Sh\u00e1takarnis, Sh\u00e1tav\u00e1hans, or \u00c1ndhrabhrityas, whose inscription in the N\u00e1na pass makes it probable that they held the Konkan about B.C. 100. During their rule the Konkan was\n\n---\n\n1 Pandit Bhagv\u00e1nlal Indraji gives the following note on the Kodas or Kottas. The inscriptions found on the Brahma hill seem all to belong to Kodas (Sk.-Kottas), and the hill apparently was their burial-ground. One of the inscriptions reads, 'Of Kalav\u00e1da a Koda.' A coin from Saharanpur near Mirat has K\u00e1dasa, that is 'Of K\u00e1da,' on both sides, in letters which closely resemble the Vak\u00e1l hill letters. Skandagupta's inscription on the Allahabad pillar, in A.D. 190, states that, while playing in Pushp\u00e1rvaya (Pataliputra or Patna), he punished a scion of the Koda family.\n\nThe Kods are one of many historical tribes whose names survive in Mar\u00e1tha surnames. In Kelva-M\u00e1him there are twenty or thirty houses of Kods who are husbandmen, holding a lower position than Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s or Kunbis, about the same as Kolis, and higher than V\u00e1rlis. They eat animal food except beef, burn their dead, and do not differ in their customs from other Th\u00e1na Kunbis or Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. They do not marry with any caste except their own. They are also found in N\u00e1sik. A miserable remnant of the same tribe, or of a tribe of the same name, also occurs on the Nilgiri hills. They number about 1100, are rude craftsmen, very dirty in their habits, and much avoided. They speak a rude K\u00e1narese. Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, Int. 37, App. 512. There were Kotta chiefs in Ceylon in 1527, but Kottah seems to have been the name of their town. Tennent's Ceylon, II. 11. Kods seem to be also a Telugu tribe. Further details are given under Places of Interest, Sop\u00e1ra, p. 325 and in the Appendix.\n\n2 Duncker's Ancient History, IV. 528; Wilford in As. Res. I. 369; Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 11. The second Ptolemy Philadelphus (B.C. 270) made a harbour in the east of Egypt, and joined it with Copius on the Nile near Thebes. Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 594. The Egyptian ships started from Berenike about half way down the Red Sea, passed by Mocha and Ad\u00e9n, coasted eastern Arabia, crossed the mouth of the Persian Gulf to near Kar\u00e1chi, and from Kar\u00e1chi sailed down the Indian coast. Chambers' Ancient History, 269. Gold and silver plate and female slaves are noted among the imports from Egypt. The direct trade to Egypt was never great. By the second century before Christ the trade between Egypt and India centred in Ad\u00e9n. Agatharcides in Vincent, II. 33.\n\n3 The Sh\u00e1takarnis are supposed to have had their original capital at Dharmikot in Gantur near the mouth of the Krishna, and to be the Andr\u00f3i of Pliny (A.D. 77) and of the Peutinger Table (A.D. 100). They are said to be the first Telugus who admitted a Sanskrit element into their language. Muir's Sanskrit Texts, II. 438. They are described in early Hindu writings as a border tribe (Ditto, I. 358) and as Dasyus of\nenriched by the great development of the western trade, which followed the establishment of the Parthian empire under Mithridates I. (B.C. 174-136) and the Roman conquest of Egypt in B.C. 30. Under the Romans the direct trade between Egypt and India gained an importance it never had under the Ptolemies. In a few years (B.C. 25) the Indian fleet in the Red Sea increased from a few ships to 120 sail. The Romans seem to have kept to the old Egyptian coasting route across the Persian Gulf to Karachi, till Hippalus discovered the monsoons about A.D. 47. The monsoon was first used to carry ships to Zizerus (Janjira ?) and afterwards to Musiris, probably Muriyi-Kotta on the Malab\u00e1r coast. The Roman passion for spices probably made the Malab\u00e1r trade the more important branch. But the trade to the Konkan was in some ways more convenient than to Malab\u00e1r, and there was a well-known route along the Arab coast to Fartak Point, and from Fartak Point across to the Konkan. It is doubtful which of the Konkan ports was the centre of the Egyptian trade; the references seem to point to Simulla or Chaul and to Zizerus, perhaps Janjira or Rajapuri.\n\nLittle is known about Parthian rule in Persia (B.C. 255-A.D. 235). They are said to have been averse from sea-going and opposed to commerce. But, according to Reinaud, under the Arsacid\u00e6 or Parthian dynasty the Persians took a great part in oriental navigation. There was a considerable Indian trade up the Persian Gulf and by land to Palmyra, and it seems to have been under Parthian influence that the Persians overcame their horror of the sea and rose to be the\n\nKahatriya descent (Ditto, II. 422). Their Puranic name, Andhrabhrityas or Andhra servants, is supposed to be a trace of an original dependence on the Mauryas. The date of their rise to power is doubtful, because of the difficulty of deciding whether the dynasties recorded in the Purans as succeeding the Mauryas followed each other, or ruled at the same time in different parts of India.\n\n1 Strabo (B.C. 25) in Vincent, II. 86. 2 Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 97.\n3 There was a street of spice shops in Rome in the time of Augustus (B.C. 36-A.D. 17), and Nero is said to have used a whole year's crop at the funeral of Popasa. Robertson's India, 56-57. Heeren's As. Res. II. Ap. ix. 455. According to Pliny, India drained Rome of \u00a31,400,000 (Sesterces 550,000,000) a year (Hist. Nat. XII. 18). Vincent (II. 48) calculates the amount at \u00a3800,000.\n4 If you are going to Broach, says the Periplus (McCrindle, 138), you are not kept more than three days at the mouth of the Red Sea. If you are going to the Malab\u00e1r coast, you must often change your tack.\n5 According to Pliny (A.D. 79) the practice of ships engaged in the Indian trade was to start from Muos Hormus, at the mouth of the gulf of Suez, about the beginning of July, and slip about 250 miles down the coast to Berenike in the modern Foul Bay. To load at Berenike and sail thirty days to Okellis the modern Ghalla or Cella a little north of Guardafui. From Ghalla to coast along east Arabia to near Cape Fartak, and, in about forty days make the Konkan, near the end of September. To stay in the Konkan till the middle of December or the middle of January, reach the Arab or the African coast in about a month, wait at Aden or some other port till about March when the south wind set in, and then to make for Berenike. To unload at Berenike and pass on to Muos Hormus at the mouth of the gulf of Suez, Vincent's Commerce, II. 319, 474. Pliny's Natural History, Bk. VI. ch. XXIII.\n6 Pliny (A.D. 77) has (McCrindle's Megasthenes, 142) a Perimula, a cape and trade centre about half way between Tropina or Kochin and Patala or Haidarabad in Sindh. This position answers to Symulla or Timulla, that is probably Chanl (compare Yule in Ind. Ant. II. 96). Zizerus Pliny's other mart on the Konkan coast seems to be Jazra or Janjira. But this again is made doubtful by the forms Milizegeris and Melizegara which appear in the better informed Ptolemy and Periplus.\n7 Heeren's As. Res. II. Ap. IX. 445; Lassen's Ind. Alt. III. 76 (Ed. 1858).\n8 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, lxxvii.\ngreatest sea-traders in the east. The trade connection between the Th\u00e1na coast and the Parthian rulers in the Persian Gulf has a special interest at this period, as, in the latter part of the first century after Christ, the Sh\u00e1takarn\u00eds or \u00c1ndhras were driven from the Konkan and North Deccan by foreigners, apparently Skythians or Parthians from North India. The leaders of these foreigners were Nah\u00e1pan and his son-in-law Ushadv\u00e1t, who, under Nah\u00e1pan, seems to have been governor of the Konkan and of the North Deccan. Nah\u00e1pan seems at first to have been the general of a greater ruler in Upper India. He afterwards made himself independent and was the founder of the Kshatras, a Persian title meaning representative, agent, or viceroy. This dynasty, which is also called the Sinh dynasty, ruled in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r from A.D. 78 to A.D. 328. Ushadv\u00e1t and his family had probably been converted to Buddhism in Upper India. Soon after conquering the \u00c1ndhras, they ceased to be foreigners, married Hindus, and gave up their foreign names. They did much for Buddhism, and were also liberal to Br\u00e1hmans.\n\n1 See Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, lxxvii. The Parthians sent silk and spices to Rome. Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, VI, 425. The men of Gerrha on the west coast of the Persian Gulf received cotton, spices, and other Indian articles, and sent them partly up the Euphrates and partly on camels across Arabia to Palmyra. This traffic is noticed by Agatharcides, B.C. 177, Strabo, B.C. 30, and Pliny A.D. 70, and in the Periplus A.D. 247. Vincent's Comparative History, II, 361-362. Pliny has several references to Parthian trade and riches. Bk. V. ch. XXV.; Bk. VI. ch. XXV. and XXVII.\n\n2 According to Rawlinson (Anc. Mon. VI. 29), the oldest form of the Parthians' name is Parthwa. The early Hindu form is Parada, and the Paradas seem to have been known to Hindus as rulers in Merv and Beluchist\u00e1n, and to have been closely connected with Hindus, as far back as B.C. 500. Lassen's Ind. Alt. III. 593. Though they had Arian and Persian names, and affected Persian habits and liked to be thought Persians, Rawlinson considers that the Parthians were of Skythian or Turanian origin. Rawlinson's Anc. Mon. VI. 21-28. Besides as Paradas the Parthians are supposed to have been known to the Hind\u00fas as Tushur\u00e1nas (Wilford, As. Res. IX. 219), and perhaps as Arsaks. N\u00e1sik Inscriptions, Trans. Sec. Int. Cong. 307, 309. Cunningham, who considers them closely connected with the Sus or Sakas (Arch. Survey, II. 46-47), places Parthians in power in North-west India from the second century before Christ. Wilson (Ariana Antiqua, 336-338, 340) assigns the Indo-Parthian dynasty to the first century after Christ. Their date is still considered doubtful. Thomas' Prinsep, II. 174. A passage in the Periplus (Vet. Geog. Scrip. I. 22) speaks of rival Parthians ruling in Sindh about the middle of the third century after Christ. Early Hindu writings mention the Paradas with the Palhavs as tribes created by the sage Vasishtha's wonder-working cow. See below p. 413 note 7.\n\n3 There are six inscriptions of Nah\u00e1pan's family in Cave VIII. at N\u00e1sik, one at K\u00e1li, and one by Nah\u00e1pan's minister at Junnar. Besides smaller grants to Buddhist monks, Ushadv\u00e1t, who seems to have governed in the Konkan and North Deccan under Nah\u00e1pan, records (A.D. 100) the building of quadrangular rest-houses and halting places at Sop\u00e1ra and the making of ferries across the P\u00e1rd\u00ed, Daman, and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu rivers. Trans. Sec. Int. Cong. 328, 333, 335, 354; Arch. Sur. X. 33, 52. A curious instance of their liberality to Br\u00e1hmans is recorded in N\u00e1sik Cave XVII. (Trans. Sec. Int. Cong. 327). This grant consisted of the gift of eight wives to Br\u00e1hmans, the word used, bh\u00e1rya or a wedded woman instead of kanya or a maiden, seeming to show that the women were chosen out of the king's household. (As regards the loose marriage rules of the early Br\u00e1hmans compare Muir's Sanskrit Texts, I. 131, 132; footnote 136-137; 282; 407; II. 466). The admission into Hinduism of Nah\u00e1pan's family, and similar admissions in the Panj\u00e1b (Lassen's Ind. Alt. II. 806-832) support Wilford's remark (As. Res. X. 90-91) that there is nothing in the theory or practice of Hinduism to prevent foreigners, who are willing to conform to the Hindu religion and manners, being admitted to be Hindus. Two instances in modern Konkan history illustrate the process by which a foreign conqueror may become a Hindu, and may be raised to the highest place among Hindu warriors. In 1674 on Raigad hill in Kolaba, by lavish bounty to Br\u00e1hmans and by scrupulous observance of religious ceremonial, Shiv\u00e1ji was, by G\u00e1g\u00e1bh\u00e1tt a learned Br\u00e1hman from Benares (who cannot have thought Shiv\u00e1ji more than a Shudra), raised to the\nNorth Konkan seems to have remained under Nah\u00e1pan\u2019s successors till, about the middle of the second century (A.D. 124), the great Sh\u00e1takarni Gautamiputra drove the Kshatrapas from the Deccan and Konkan, including the holy Krishnagiri or Kanher\u00ed hills. The great wealth of the Konkan during the rule of the Sh\u00e1takarni kings is shown by many wonderful remains, the Kanheri caves in S\u00e1lsette, the N\u00e1sik caves on the route through the Tal pass, the works on the N\u00e1na pass, the Bedsa, Bh\u00e1ja, K\u00e1rti, and Kond\u00e1ne caves along the Bor pass route, the stupa at Sop\u00e1ra and perhaps those at Elephanta and Kaly\u00e1n. These remains prove great wealth both among the rulers and the traders, and show that the architects and sculptors were men of skill, and were probably foreigners. The chief cause of the great wealth of the Konkan was that the power of its rulers stretched across India to the mouth of the Krishna, and enabled them to bring to the Th\u00e1na ports, not only the local inland trade, but the rich products of the coast of Bengal and the far east, through Masulipatam, Tagar, and Paithan.\n\nWestwards there were special openings for a rich commerce. The Parthian emperors (B.C. 255-A.D. 235), however rude they may once have been, had grown rich, luxurious, and fond of trade. This was already the case in the time of Strabo (B.C. 30), and in the early part of the second century after Christ, during the forty years of rest (A.D. 116-150) that followed Hadrian\u2019s peace with Chosroes, the exchange of wealth between the Parthian and the Roman empires greatly increased. The markets of Palmyra were supplied not only from Gerhha near Bahr\u00e9in across Arabia, but from the head of the Persian Gulf up the Euphrates by Babylon and Ktesiphon to the new (A.D. 60) mart of Vologesocerta. Palmyra inscriptions of the middle of the second century (A.D. 138, 141, 246) show that merchants had a safe pass through Parthia, and that one of the main lines of trade lay through Vologesocerta. The details of this trade, perfumes, pearls, precious stones, cotton, rich silk, famous silks dyed with Indian purple and embroidered with gold and\n\nhighest place among Kshatriyas. Grant Duff, 177. About the same time (1650) success in two sea fights enabled the grandfather of R\u00e1nhoji Angria, who was a Musalm\u00e1n negro from the Persian Gulf, to become a Hindu and to marry the daughter of a Mar\u00e1tha chief.

(A.D. 124) built the Great Chaitya Cave No. III. at N\u00e1sik; at K\u00e1rti two inscriptions, in the Great Chaitya and in Cave XII., are dated the seventh and twenty-fourth years of V\u00e1sishthiputra Pulum\u00e1vi (A.D. 140); and there are three inscriptions of Ysjnashri Sh\u00e1takarni Gautamiputra (A.D. 160), two in Kanheri Caves 3 and 61, and one in N\u00e1sik Cave XV. Trans. Sec. Or. Cong. 311, 339; Arch. Sur. X. 34, 36; Places of Interest, Kanheri Caves. The frequent mention of Dharmikot (Dhemuk\u00e1kata) as the residence of donors and others connected with the Poona, N\u00e1sik, and Th\u00e1na caves (five in K\u00e1rti, Burgess\u2019 Arch. Sur.

Cong.; one in Shal\u00e1rv\u00e1di, ditto 38; and one in Kanheri, Bombay Gazetteer, XIV. 188), are evidence of the close political and commercial connection between the east and the west coast.\n\n3 Heeren, III. 483. After the fall of Babylon and Ctesiphon, Trajan sailed down the Tigris to the Persian Gulf, embarked on the south sea, made inquiries about India, and regretted he could not go there. Dio Cassius in Rawlinson\u2019s Ancient Monarchies, IV. 313. According to another, but incorrect, account Trajan went to Z\u00edzerus. Kerr\u2019s Voyages, II. 40. Rawlinson (Anc. Mon. VI, 383) describes the Parthians as luxurious and fond of wine and dancing.\nprecious stones, point to a close connection with India, and, through India, with China. Hindus seem to have settled at Palmyra for purposes of trade, as in 273, after the fall of Palmyra, Indians swelled the train of captives who graced Aurelian's triumph. Except the ruins of Hatra, or Al-Hadhra, their own land contains few traces of Parthian buildings. But the great rock temples in and near the Th\u00e1na district, that date from the centuries before and after Christ, seem to have been planned and sculptured by Parthian or Persian artists. Harpharan of Abulama, whose name appears in one of the K\u00e1rli inscriptions, was probably a Parthian or Persian. And so closely alike are the animal capitals of the pillars at K\u00e1rli, Bedsa, and N\u00e1sik, to capitals at Persepolis and Susa, that, according to Fergusson, the early Buddhists of Western India either belonged to the Persian empire or drew their art from it.\n\nThis close connection between India and Persia supports the view, that the Palhavs who are mentioned with Shaks and Yavans in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1n and in N\u00e1sik and Jun\u00e1gad inscriptions of the first and second centuries, and who figure as a dynasty in the Deccan between the fifth and seventh centuries, were of Persian or of Parthian origin. Like many other foreigners, these Palhavs have become Hindus and are lost in the great mixture of tribes which the name Mar\u00e1tha covers.\n\n1 Heeren, II. 440, 445, 453, 455. 2 Heeren, II. 446.\n3 Fergusson says (Hist. of Arch. II. 492) the Parthians have left no material trace of their existence, and Gardner (Marsden's Numismata Parthia, 2, 3) remarks that architecture and sculpture ceased during the Parthian period. Fergusson even fixes the building of Hatra at A.D. 250, about fifteen years after the close of Parthian rule. But Rawlinson (Anc. Mon. VI. 381) shows that Hatra was a place of importance under the Parthians, and fixes its date at about A.D. 150. He thinks it was the work of Parthian artists with little foreign help. There is a further mention that Pacorus II. (78-110) enlarged and beautified Ctesiphon (Ditto, 294), and that the Parthian palace at Babylon was magnificent and the emperor surrounded with much pomp and show. Ditto, 416.\n4 Arch. Sur. X. 36. Abulama is probably Obollah near Basra. See below p. 420 n. 3.\n5 Nineveh and Persepolis, 360; Rude Stone Monuments, 456. Rawlinson's Description of the Halls at Hatra (Anc. Mon. VI. 379) has several points of likeness to Western India Cave Temples: Semicircular vaulted roofs, no windows, the light coming through an archway at the east end, and a number of small rooms opening from a central hall. Among the Sop\u00e2ra relics the resemblance between Maitreya's head-dress and the Parthian helmet adopted by Mithridates I. about B.C. 150 is worthy of notice. See Frontispiece in Gardner's Parthian Section of Marsden's Numismata Orientalia, p. 18; also Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, VI. 91.\n6 See Mr. Fleet's K\u00e1nares Dynasties, 14-15.\n7 Several Hindu references show, that the great inflow of foreign nations in the centuries before and after the Christian era was not confined to the north of India. The incorporation of foreign nations (Ind. Ant. IV. 168), Shaks, Yavans, Kambojas, Paradas, and Pahnava, is mentioned in the Vishnu Pur\u00e1n. Wilson's Translation, 374. Tod's contention (Annals of R\u00e1jasth\u00e1n, I. 82-85), that the Agnikula Rajputs are of un-Sanskrit origin, is supported by a reference quoted by Lassen (Ind. Alt. II. 805) to a king Vrigi of M\u00e1wa, who, apparently about the time of Christ, introduced new divisions into the four castes, and by the boast of Gautamiputra Sh\u00e1takarni (A.D. 120) in one of the N\u00e1sik caves, that he had stopped the confusion of castes. Second International Congress, 311.\n\nThe Palhavs, who are mentioned in the text, seem to have been known to the Hindus in very early times, as living near the Hindu Kush. Lassen's Ind. Alt. I. 1028. Early Hindu writings mention the Palhavs, with the Paradas and others, as outside tribes created from the tail of the Br\u00e1hman Vasishtha's wonder-working cow to help him in his great struggle with the Kshatriya ruler Vishv\u00e1mitra. Muir's Sanskrit Texts, I. 391,398. Other passages describe them as degraded Kshatriyas.\nBesides with the Persian Gulf, during the rule of the Sh\u00e1takarnis or Andrhabhrityas, the Konkan ports had a great trade with the Red Sea.\n\nThe Konkan is the part of the west coast, which was best known to the Greeks at the time of the geographer Ptolemy (A.D. 135-150). It was from Greeks, who had for many years traded to Symulla or Timulla, probably Chaul, that Ptolemy gained much of his information about Western India. And from the mention of gifts by Yavans to the Kanheri, N\u00e1sik, K\u00e1li, and Junnar caves, some of the Greeks seem to have settled in the country and become Buddhists. So, also, Indians seem to have gone to Alexandria, and perhaps gave Ptolemy his surprising knowledge of places of Hindu pilgrimage. Ptolemy had the mistaken idea that the Indian coast stretched east and west instead of north and south. This confuses his account, but his knowledge of names is curiously exact and full. He divides the west coast into Surastrene or Saur\u00e1shtra, corresponding to Cutch, K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and North Gujar\u00e1t; Larike, that is L\u00e1t Desh, or South Gujar\u00e1t; Ariake or\n\nwho were forced to wear beards. Ditto, I. 482-484, 486, 488. As a Deccan dynasty the head-quarters of their power was in the east, near Masulipatam (Ind. Ant. VI. 85) and Kanchi or Konjvir\u00e1m, where they were great builders (Ind. Ant. VIII. 25). Though the Palhavs' are best known in the east, they must either have spread their power to the west or a branch of them must have reached the west coast by sea. In the second century after Christ, a Palhav, with the Sanskrit name Suvi\u015bhkh the son of an un-Sanskrit Kulaipa, was viceroy of Gujar\u00e1t and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war under the Sinh king Rudr\u00e1d\u00e1man (Ind. Ant. VII. 263); the Brihat-Sanhita (A.D. 500) puts the Palhavs in the south-west of India (J. R. A. S. New Series, V. 84); and General Cunningham (Ancient Geog. 319) notices a Palhav prince of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war in A.D. 720. The surnames Palhav and P\u00e1lhav are still not uncommon among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Kunbis of the Konkan coast. The close connection between the Palhavs and the Parthians and Persians, the Parthian immigration from Upper India which has been noticed above, and the relations by sea between the Th\u00e1na coast and the Persian Gulf, support Wilford's belief (As. Res. IX. 156, 233; X. 91) that there is a strong Persian element in the Konkanasth Br\u00e1hmans and in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The history of the Pars\u00eds, who for a time lost most of their peculiarities (see Population Chapter, p. 252), shows how easily a settlement of Persians may embrace Hinduism. Pandit Bhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1l also notices the Paraj\u00e1\u00e1s, a class of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war craftsmen, whose name, appearance, and peculiarities of custom and dress seem to point to a Persian or a Parthian origin. It is worthy of note, that in modern times (1500-1680) one of the chief recruiting grounds of the Bij\u00e1pur kings was Khor\u00e1s\u00e1n, the ancient Parthia, and that the immigrants entered the Deccan mostly, if not entirely, from the Persian Gulf through the Konkan ports.

The geographer to whom Ptolemy admits that he owed most (Book I. chap. VI. VII.) was Marinus of Tyre.\n\n2 Lassen's Ind. Ant. IV. 79. In the first century after Christ, Dionysius, a wise man, was sent (J. As. Soc. Ben. VII. [1] 226) from Egypt to India to examine the chief marts, and in 138 Partenius the Stoic of Alexandria came to India as a Christian missionary and took back the first clear ideas of the Shramans and Br\u00e1hmans, and of Buddha 'whom the Indians honoured as a god, because of his holy life.' Hough's Christianity, I. 51. Compare Assemani in Rich's Khurd\u00edst\u00e1n, II. 120, 122.\n\n3 Ptolemy conversed with several Hindus in Alexandria. Wilford in As. Res. X. 101, 105. As early as the first century Indian Christians were settled in Alexandria. Hough's Christianity in India, I. 44. In the time of Pliny (A.D. 77) many Indians lived in Egypt. Dion Chrysostom mentions Indians in Alexandria about A.D. 100, and Indians told Clemens (192-217) about Buddha. J. R. A. S. XIX. 278. Br\u00e1hmans are mentioned in Constantinople. Oppert in Madras Lit. and Scien. XI. 1878, 210. It was about this time (A.D. 24-57) that according to one account 20,000 Hindu families colonised J\u00e1va (Raffles' Java, II. 69) and Bali.

But from the fact that the Sh\u00e1takarnis ruled the Deccan as well as the Konkan, there seems reason to suppose that it was the same trade which is described by the author of the Periplus as centering at Broach about a hundred years later.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Damurika appears in Peutinger's Tables, A.D. 100.\n\n\\(^2\\) The meaning of S\u00e1dan's Ariake is doubtful. The question is discussed later on, p. 417. Perhaps because of Pliny's account of the Konkan pirates, Ptolemy's phrase Ariake Andron Peiraton has been taken to mean Pirate Ariake. But Ptolemy has no mention of pirates on the Konkan coast, and, though this does not carry much weight in the case of Ptolemy, the phrase Andron Peiraton is not correct Greek for pirates. This and the close resemblance of the words suggests that Andron Peiraton may originally have been Andhra-Bhrityon.\n\n\\(^3\\) These are N\u00e1sauri, Nas\u00fariya; the Vaitarna river, called Goaris from the town Goreh about forty miles from its mouth; Dunga, either Tung\u00e1r hill or Dugad near the Vajr\u00e1h\u00e1i springs; the Binda or Bas\u00e9in creek, apparently from Bh\u00e1yndar opposite Bassein; the cape and mart of Symulla, the cape apparently the south point of Bombay harbour, and the mart Chaul. South of Symulla is Balepatna, the city of P\u00e1l near Mah\u00e1d with Buddhist caves, and not far from P\u00e1l is Hippokura, apparently a Greek form of Ghr\u00f3degaon in Ko\u015b\u00e1la. Ptolemy notices that Paithan was the capital of Siri-Polomei, probably Shri-Pulum\u00e1yi (A.D.140), and mentions N\u00e1na-Guna which he thought was a river, but which apparently is the N\u00e1na Gh\u00e1t the direct route from Paithan to the coast.\n\n\\(^4\\) McCrindle's Periplus, 125. Goods passed from the top of the Sahy\u00e1dris eastward in wagons across the Deccan to Paithan, and, from Paithan, ten days further east to Tagar, the greatest mart in southern India. At Tagar goods were collected from the parts along the coast, that is apparently the coast of Bengal. There seems reason to believe that this was one of the lines along which silk and some of the finer spices found their way west from the Eastern Archipelago and China. (Compare Heeren, III. 384). Near the mouth of the Krishna, Ptolemy has a Maisolia, apparently the modern Masulipatam, and close by an Alosyque, the place from which vessels set sail for Malacca or the Golden Chersonese Bertius' Ed., Asia Map X. and XI. So important was the town that the God\u00e1var\u00ed was known to Ptolemy as the Maisilos river (Ditto). The Periplus has also a Masalia on the Coromandel coast, where immense quantities of fine muslins were made. McCrindle, 145; Vincent, II. 523. It seems probable that molochinon the Periplus name for one of the cloths which are mentioned as coming to Broach through Tagar from the parts along the coast, is, as Vincent suspected, a mistake (Commerce, II, 412, 741-742) and should be Masulinon or Masuli cloth. McCrindle, 136; Vincent, II. 412. This and not Marco Polo's Mohsel near Nineveh (Yule's Edition, I. 59) would then be the origin of the English muslin. Masulitina the Arab name for muslin (Yule, I. 59) favours the Indian origin, and in Marco Polo's time (290) Mutapali near Masulipatam was (Yule, II. 296) famous for the most delicate work like tissue of spider's web. The trade in cloth between Masulipatam and Th\u00e1na was kept up till modern times. In the middle of the seventeenth century, Thevenot notices (Harris, II. 373-384) how chintzes and other cloths from Masulipatam came through Golkonda by Ch\u00e1ndor, N\u00e1sik, and the Tal pass to the Th\u00e1na ports. And about the same time Baldaus (Churchill, III. 589) describes Masulipatam as a very populous city where the trade of Europe and China met, and where was a great concourse of merchants from Cambay, Surat, Goa, and other places on the west coast. It is worthy of note that the dark spotted turban cloth now worn by some Bombay Prabhus, Musalm\u00e1ns, and P\u00e1risis, which was probably adopted by them from the old Hindu Th\u00e1na traders,\nThe chief trade was with the Red Sea and Egypt in the west, and, apparently, inland by Paithan and Tagar to the shores of the Bay of Bengal, and, across the Bay of Bengal, with Malacca or the Golden Chersonese and China. The chief exports to Egypt were, of articles of food, sesamum, oil, sugar, and perhaps rice and ginger; of dress, cotton of different kinds from the Deccan, and from the eastern coast silk thread and silk; of spices and drugs, spikenard, coccus, bdellium, and long pepper; of dyes, lac and indigo; of ornaments, diamonds, opals, onyx stones found in large quantities near Paithan, and perhaps emeralds, turquoises, and pearls; of metals, iron or steel, and perhaps gold. The imports were wines of several kinds, Italian, Laodicean, and Arabian; of dress, cloth and variegated sashes; of spices and drugs, frankincense, gum, stibium for the eyes, and storax; of metals, brass or copper, tin, and lead; also gold and silver coins; of ornaments, coral, costly silver vases, plate, and glass; and of slaves, handsome young women for the king of the country.\n\nThe merchants of the Thana ports were Hindus, Buddhism favouring trade, and owing many of its finest monuments to the\n\ncomes from Masulipatam and is known as Bandari, that is Masulibandari, cloth. The close connection between the Thana rock temples and traders from Dharmikot near the mouth of the Krishna has been already noticed.\n\n1 Pearls which Pliny (A.D. 77) mentions as one of the chief exports from Perimula, that is apparently Simulla or Chaul (Yule in Ind. Ant. II. 96), and which in the twelfth century (Idrisi in Elliot and Dowson, I. 85) appear as one of the exports of Sopara, are still found in the Bassein creek (see above, p. 55). Besides pearls the Thana ports seem for long to have sent westwards another precious stone, generally called an emerald, but which may have been a Golconda diamond, or may have included several kinds of stone. In very early times (A.D. 500) the Sopara stone was famous (Jour. R. A. S. New Series, VII). Pliny has a Lithos Kallianos (Vincent, II. 731), whose name (though this is made less likely by the export of a Lithos Kallianos from Sindh in the Periplus Vincent, II. 390) suggests that it may be the Sopara stone whose place of export may have changed to Kalyan. Masudi's (913) Sanjan stone, also described as an emerald (Prairies d'Or, III. 47, 48), is perhaps still the same stone or stones, the trade or the workers having moved to Sanjan. Compare the modern fame of Cambay stones, most of which come from long distances to Cambay. Cambay Statistical Account, Bombay Gazetteer, VI. 198-207.\n\n2 Indian steel was famous. The chisels that drilled the granite of the Egyptian obelisks are said to have been of Indian steel. Shaw's Egypt, 364. Indian steel is mentioned in the Periplus and in Antonine's Digest.\n\n3 As regards the use of wine, drinking scenes are common in the Umravati sculptures (A.D. 400) and in the later Ajanta paintings (A.D. 500-600). Rawlinson notices (Anc. Mon. VI. 383) that the Parthians were fond of wine, and Hiuen Thsang (640) notices that some of the Maratha soldiers were much given to the use of intoxicating liquor. Julien's Mem, Occ. III., 150.\n\n4 Pliny notices that the Indians took lead in exchange for pearls and precious stones.

Besides Hindus the leading merchants seem to have been Greeks and Arabs, some of them settled in India, others foreigners. Christian traders from the Persian Gulf seem also to have been settled at Kalyan and Sopara. Except as archers no Romans seem to have come to India.\n\nThe shipping of the Thana coast included small coasting craft, medium-sized vessels that went to Persia, and large Indian, Arab, and Greek ships that traded to Yemen and Egypt. The Greek or Egyptian ships were large well-found and well-manned, and carried archers as a guard against pirates. They were rounder and roomier than ships of war, and, as a sign that they were merchantmen, they hung a basket from the mast-head. The hull was smeared with wax and was ornamented with pictures of the gods, especially with a painting of the guardian divinity on the stern. The owners were Greeks, Hindus, and Arabs, and the pilots and sailors were Hindus and Arabs.\n\nAbout the close of the second century (A.D. 178) Rudradaman, one of the greatest of the Kshatrap kings of Gujar\u0101t, has recorded a double defeat of a Shatakarni and the recovery of the north Konkan. About the beginning of the third century, according to the author of the Periplus of the Erythrean sea whose date is probably A.D. 247, the elder Saraganes, one of the Shatakarnis, raised\n\n---\n\n1 The K\u0101rli and Kanheri Cathedral caves were made by merchants; and there are many inscriptions in the Kuda, Kanheri, and Nasik caves, which record minor gifts by merchants.

In addition to the former references the author of the Periplus notices Indian settlements in Socotra and at Azania on the Ethiopian coast. McCrindle, 93.\n\n2 Details of early Christian settlers are given in the Population Chapter and in the account of Sopara. Their high priest or Catholicus had his head-quarters at Ctesiphon.

Vincent writes, 'The merchants have Greek names, Diogenes, Theophilus, and Sopater. I have not met a single Roman name' (Vincent, II. 69, 209, 305). According to Wilford (As. Res. X. 114) there was a Greek colony in Kalyan. The fondness of the Greeks for founding trade colonies (Heeren, II. 282), and the mention in Pentinger's Tables (VIII.) of a temple of Augustus at Muziris favour Wilford's statement.\n\n4 Vincent, II. 33, 37, 38.\n\n5 Pliny's Nat.

Lindsay (Merchant Shipping, I. 108) thinks that these Greek boats were like the grain ships, which plied between Alexandria and Rome, in one of which St. Paul was shipwrecked (A.D. 62). This vessel was of considerable size, able to carry 276 passengers and crew, besides a cargo of wheat. It was decked, had a high poop and forecastle, and bulwarks of battens. It had one main mast and one large square sail, a small mizen mast, and a little pole at the bow with a square sail. These ships went at a great pace before the wind, but could not make much way on a wind.\n\n7 Ind. Ant. VII. 262.\n\n8 Reinaud's paper fixing the date of the Periplus has been translated in the Indian Antiquary of December 1879. The detailed account of the Kathiawar and Gujar\u0101t coasts, compared with Ptolemy's scanty and confused notes, and the fact that the author corrects Ptolemy's great error about the direction of the west coast of India support M. Reinaud's view that the Periplus is later than Ptolemy.\nKaly\u00e1n to the rank of a regular mart. When the author of the Periplus wrote, the Sh\u00e1takarnis had again lost their hold of the Th\u00e1na coast, and it had passed to a king named Sandanes, who stopped all foreign trade. If Greek vessels, even by accident, came to a Konkan port, a guard was put on board, and they were taken to Barugaza or Broach.\n\nThe Konkan places mentioned by the author of the Periplus are Sop\u00e1ra (Ouppara), Kaly\u00e1n, (Kalliena), Chaul (Semulla), and P\u00e1l near Mah\u00e1d (Palaiapatma). Though the direct commerce with Egypt had been driven from the Konkan ports, there was still a considerable trade. Coasting vessels went south to meet the Egyptian ships at Musiris and Nelkynda on the Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r coast, or further south to Ceylon; or on to ports on the Coromandel coast, chiefly to bring back the fine cloths of Masulipatam. There was an important trade with Gedrosia on the east coast and with Apologos, probably Obollah, at the head of the Persian Gulf. The chief trade with Gedrosia was in timber, teak, squared wood, and blocks of ebony, with a return of wine, dates, cloth, purple, gold,\n\n1 McCrindle's Periplus, 128. This Sandanes seems to be the family or dynasty, which gives its name to Ptolemy's 'Sadan's Aria,' which includes most of the North Konkan. What dynasty is meant is uncertain. Prof. Bhand\u00e1rkar contributes the following note: Among the western countries or tribes mentioned by Varahamihira, is one bearing the name of Sh\u00e1ntik\u00e1s (Brihat S. chap. xiv, verse 20). The first part of the name must in vernacular pronunciation have become S\u00e1ndi, since \u00e1t is often changed to ad in the Pr\u00e1krits, as in Saundala for Shakuntala, Andeura for Antahpura, and in other cases. As to the final syllable ka of the word Sh\u00e1ntika it is clearly a suffix, and this suffix is in later Sanskrit very generally applied to all nouns. When it is added to nouns ending in n as hasin an elephant, the final n is dropped and thus hastin becomes hasika. Sh\u00e1ntika therefore, without the suffix ka, is Sh\u00e1ntin, the nominative plural of which is Sh\u00e1ntinah. This Sh\u00e1ntinah is S\u00e1ndino in the Pr\u00e1krits, and from this last form, that is the vernacular pronunciation of the day, the Greeks must have derived their Sandines or Sadinoi. The name Sh\u00e1ntika occurs in the M\u00e1r\u00e1ndeya Pur\u00e1na (chap. lviii.), where, as well as in the Brihat Sambhita, it is associated with \u00c1par\u00e1ntaka or \u00c1par\u00e1ntika, the name of another western people living on the coast. \u00c1paranta generally means northern Konkan. When the Kshatraps Nahap\u00e1n displaced the Sh\u00e1tavahanas or Andhrabhrityas in the Deccan, the Sh\u00e1ntinah or S\u00e1ndino must have asserted their independence in the Konkan, and thus it was that their chief called Sandanes by the author of the Periplus came to be master of Kaly\u00e1n. It was probably to render his independence secure against the victorious Kshatraps, that he prohibited intercourse between his territories and the Deccan, and sent away the Greek ships to Barygaza. There could be no reason for such a prohibition in the time of the 'Elder Saraganes' or Sh\u00e1takarni, since he ruled over the country, above the Sahy\u00e1dris, as well as below.\n\nAnother suggestion may perhaps be offered. That Ptolemy's Sadan and the Periplus Sandanes stand for the Kshatrap or Sinha rulers of Gujar\u00e1t. The natural explanation of Sandanes' conduct in carrying the Greek ships to Broach is that it was done to force foreign commerce to his seaport of Broach. If the S\u00e1dhans are the Kshatraps, the word Sadan or Sandanes would be the Sanskrit S\u00e1dhana, an agent or representative (see Williams' Sanskrit Dictionary), that is a translation of the Persian Kshatrep. In support of the use of the word S\u00e1dh\u00e1n as an agent may be cited Bardesanes' account of the Hindu embassy, which he met in Babylon on its way to Rome about A.D. 218, where the headman, or ambassador, is called Sandanes, apparently S\u00e1dh\u00e1n (J. R. A. S., XIX, 290, 291). The suggestion is supported by the Jain work K\u00e1lak\u00e1ch\u00e1rya Katha (J. B. B. R. A. S., IX, 139-142), which speaks of the Kshatraps as the S\u00e1dh\u00e1n-Sinhas. Wilford explains the word by S\u00e1dh\u00e1n lord (As. Res. IX. 76, 198). He compares the phrase S\u00e1dh\u00e1n Engriz a polite term for the English.\n\n2 McCrindle, 128, 129.\n\n3 Musiris is identified with Muyirikotta and Nelkynda with Kannettri.

There was also trade in muslin, corn, oil, cotton, and female slaves with the east coast of Arabia, Socotra where Indians were settled, Aden, and Moosa near Mocha. And there was a trade to Zanzibar and the African ports, taking corn, rice, butter, sesamum, cotton, sashes, sugar, and iron, and bringing back slaves, tortoiseshell, and cinnamon. Lastly there was a trade to Aduli, the sea-port of Abyssinia, the Indian ships bringing cloth, iron, cotton, sashes, muslin, and lac, and taking ivory and rhinoceros' horns.\n\nA copper-plate, found by Dr. Bird in 1839 in a relic mound in front of the great Kanheri cave (No. 3), is dated in the 245th year of the Trikutakas. From the form of the letters, which seem to belong to the fifth century, Dr. Burgess ascribes the plate to the Gupta era in A.D. 176, and thus makes the date of the plate A.D. 421. Trikuta, or the three hills, is mentioned by K\u00e1lid\u00e1s (A.D. 500) as a city on a lofty site built by Raghu when he conquered the Konkan. The name is the same as Trigiri, the Sanskrit form of Tagara, and Pandit Bhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1l identifies the city with Junnar in west Poona, a place of great importance, on a high site, and between the three hills of Shivneri, Gameshlena, and M\u00e1nmodi. The discovery of two hoards of silver coins bearing the legend of Krishnar\u00e1ja, one in 1881 in Bombay Island the other in Mulgaon in S\u00e1lsette in June 1882, seems to show that the early R\u00e1shtrakuta king Krishna (A.D. 375-400), whose coins have already been found in B\u00e1gl\u00e1n in N\u00e1sik, also held possession of the North Konkan.\n\nDuring this time the Sassanian dynasty (230-650) had risen to power in Persia. They were on terms of close friendship with the rulers of Western India, and became the leading traders in the eastern seas. In the beginning of the sixth century (A.D. 525) the Egyptian merchant and monk Kosmas Indikopleustes describes Kaly\u00e1n (Kalliana) as the seat of one of the five chief rulers of Western India, a king who had from 500 to 600 elephants. Kaly\u00e1n had much traffic with Ceylon, which was then the great centre of trade in the east, sending copper, steel, ebony, and much\n\n---\n\n1 Vincent, II. 378, 379.

There were also the conquest of Sindh and embassies to the rulers of southern India under Naush\u00edrv\u00e1n (531-578), and an embassy of Khosro P\u00e1rviz (591-628) to the king of B\u00e1d\u00e1m\u00ed, Pulikesh\u00ed II. (609-640). Jour. R. A. S. XI. 165. It was under the Sassanians that the Persians brought chess and the Arabian Nights from India (Reinand's Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 135). Wilford (As. Res. IX. 156, 233; X. 91) traces the foreign element in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and in the Chitp\u00e1van or Konkanast Br\u00e1hmans to Persian immigration during Sassanian rule. But it seems likely that if there is a Persian element in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Konkanast Br\u00e1hmans, it dates from before the time of the Sassanians.

Of the exports to the Persian Gulf, one of the chief was timber for house-building, aloes, pepper, ginger, spices, cotton cloth, and silk.\\(^2\\) The trade with Egypt began to fall off about the close of the third century, and by the sixth century it had almost ceased.\\(^3\\) The traffic with the African ports was brisk and had developed an import of gold. The merchants were Hindus, Arabs, Persians, and perhaps Christians from Persia.\\(^4\\) The Hindus seem to have been as great travellers as during the times of Greek trade, and were found settled in Persia, Alexandria, Ceylon, J\u00e1va, and China.\\(^5\\)\n\nThe chief of Kaly\u00e1n described by Kosmas was perhaps either a Maurya or a Nala as Kirtivarma (550-567), the first of the Ch\u00e1lukyas who turned his arms against the Konkan, is described as the night of death to the Nalas and Mauryas.\\(^6\\) And Kirtivarma's grandson Pulikesi II. (610-640), under whom the Konkan was conquered, describes his general Chanda-danda, as a great wave which drove before it the watery stores of the pools, which are the Mauryas. The Ch\u00e1lukya general, with hundreds of ships, attacked the Maurya capital Puri, the goddess of the fortunes of the western ocean.\\(^7\\) A stone inscription from V\u00e1da in the north of Th\u00e1na of the fourth or fifth century shows that a Mauryan king of the name of Suketuvarma was then ruling in the Konkan.\\(^8\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cosmas in J.

The two small landing-places of the name of More, in Elephanta and in Karanja, are perhaps relics of Mauryan power. The only trace of the Nalas occurs in a local story of a Nal R\u00e1ja, who married his daughter to the Malang or Arab devotee who gave his name to Malanggad hill. (See Places of Interest, Malanggad). Nal is still a Mar\u00e1tha surname.\nAnd it is probable that the group of figures in the Lon\u00e1d cave six miles south-east of Bhiwndi, which belongs to the sixth or seventh century, represents the court of a Mauryan king.\\(^1\\)\n\nDuring the reign of the great Naushervan (531-578), when the Persians were the rulers of the commerce of the eastern seas, the relations between Western India and Persia were extremely close.\\(^2\\) On the Arab (625 and 638) overthrow of Yezdejard III., the last of the Sassanians, several bands of Persians sought refuge on the Th\u00e1na coast and were kindly received by J\u00e1dav R\u00e1na, apparently a Y\u00e1dav chief of Sanj\u00e1n.\\(^3\\) In the years immediately after their conquest of Persia the Arabs made several raids on the coasts of Western India; one of these in 637 from Bahrein and Oman in the Persian Gulf plundered the Konkan coast near Th\u00e1na.\\(^4\\)\n\nNo further notice\\(^5\\) of the North Konkan has been traced till the rise of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras, twenty of whom, as far as present information\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The attitude of some of the figures, whose hands are laid on their mouths apparently out of respect to the king, suggests Persian influence. The laying of the hand on the mouth is a sign of respect in the Persepolis Pictures (Heeren's As. Res. I. 178), and the P\u00e1rs\u00eds still cover the mouth in sign of worship.\n\n\\(^2\\) Yule (Cathay, I. 56) notices that about this time the lower Euphrates was called Hind or India, but this seems to have been an ancient practice. Rawlinson, J. R. G. S. XXVII. 186. As to the extent of the Persian trade at this time, see Reinaud's Memoir Sur l'Inde, 124. In the fifth and sixth centuries, besides the Persian trade, there was an active Arab trade up the Persian Gulf and the Euphrates to Hira on the right or west bank of the river, not far from the ruins of Babylon. There was also much traffic with Oballah near the mouth of the joint river not far from Basra. Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccclxxxii.\n\nOballah is also at this time (A.D. 400-600) noticed as the terminus of the Indian and Chinese vessels which were too large to pass up the river to Hira. (Ditto and Yule's Cathay, lxvii, 55). So close was its connection with India that the Talmud writers always speak of it as Hindike or Indian Oballah (Rawlinson in J. R. G. S. XXVII. 186). According to Masudi (915) Oballah was the only port under the Sassanian kings (Prairies d'Or, III. 164.) McCrindle (Periplus, 103; compare Vincent, II. 377) identifies it with the Apologos of the Periplus (A.D. 247) which he holds took the place of Ptolemy's (A.D. 150) Teredon or Diridctus. Reinaud (Ind. Ant. VIII. 330) holds that Oballah is a corruption of the Greek Apologos, a custom house. But Vincent's view (II. 355) that Apologos is a Greek form of the original Oballah or Obollah seems much more likely. In Vincent's opinion (Ditto, II. 356) the town was founded by the Parthians. At the time of the Arab conquest of Persia (637) Abillah is mentioned as the port of entry at the mouth of the Euphrates (J. R. A. S. XII. 208). In spite of the rivalry of the new Arab port of Basrah, Oballah continued a considerable centre of trade. It is mentioned by Tabari in the ninth century (Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccclxxxi.) Masudi (913) notices it as a leading town (Prairies d'Or, I. 230-231); Idrisi (1135) as a very rich and flourishing city (Janbert's Ed. I. 369); and it appears in the fourteenth century in Abu-l-fida (Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, 72). It was important enough to give the Persian Gulf the name of the Gulf of Oballah (D'Herbelot's Bibliotheque Orientale, III. 61). According to D'Herbelot when he wrote (about 1670) Oballah was still a strong well peopled town (Ditto). The importance of the town and the likeness of the names suggest that Oballah is the Abulamah from which came the Persian or Parthian Harpharan of Abulamah who records the gift of a cave in K\u00e1rl\u00ed inscription 20. This identification supports the close connection by sea between the Parthians and the west coast of India in the centuries before and after the Christian era. See above p. 413.\n\n\\(^3\\) See above pp. 247-249.\n\n\\(^4\\) Elliot and Dowson's History, I. 415, 416. As the companion fleet which was sent to Dibal or Dirul in Sindh made a trade settlement at that town, this attack on Th\u00e1na was probably more than a plundering raid. The Kahph Umar (639-643), who had not been consulted, was displeased with the expedition and forbade any further attempt.\n\n\\(^5\\) Hiwen Tsang's (642) Konkanspura, about 330 miles from the Dr\u00e1vid country, was thought by General Cunningham (Anc. Geog. 552) to be Kaly\u00e1n, or some other place in the Konkan. Dr. Burnell (Ind. Ant. VII. 39) has identified it with Konkanahalli in Mysor.\ngoes, ruled in the North Konkan from about A.D. 810 to A.D. 1260, a period of 450 years.\n\nWho the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras were has not been ascertained. The name is variously spelt Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra, Shail\u00e1h\u00e1ra, Shril\u00e1ra, Shil\u00e1ra, and Sil\u00e1ra; even the same inscription has more than one form, and one inscription has the three forms Sil\u00e1ra, Shil\u00e1ra, and Shril\u00e1ra. Lassen suggests that the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras are of Afghan origin, as Sil\u00e1r K\u00e1firs are still found in Afghanistan. But the southern ending Ayya of the names of almost all their ministers and the un-Sanskrit names of some of the chiefs favour the view that they were of southern or Dravidian origin.\n\n1 As far as at present known, the family tree of the Th\u00e1na Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras was as follows:\n\n(1) Kapardi.\n(2) Pulashakti.\n(3) Kapardi (II.) named Laghu or the younger, (Shak 775-799, A.D. 863-877).\n(4) Vappuvanna.\n(5) Jhanjha, (A.D. 916).\n(6) Gogri.\n(7) Vajjadadev.\n(8) Apar\u00e1jit (Shak 919, A.D. 997).\n(9) Vajjadadev (II.).\n(10) Arikeshari (Shak 980, A.D. 1017).\n(11) Chhittar\u00e9j (Shak 948, A.D. 1009).\n(12) N\u00e1g\u00e1rjun.\n(13) Mumumuni (Shak 982, A.D. 1060).\n(14) Amantidev (Shak 1003 and 1016, A.D. 1081 and 1094).\n(15) Apar\u00e1ditya (Shak 1060, A.D. 1138).\n(16) Harip\u00e1ddev (Shak 1071, 1072, and 1075, A.D. 1149, 1150, and 1153).\n(17) Malik\u00e1rjun (Shak 1078 and 1082, A.D. 1156 and 1160).\n(18) Apar\u00e1diya (II.) (Shak 1106 and 1109, A.D. 1154 and 1157).\n(19) Keshidev (Shak 1125 and 1181, A.D. 1203 and 1238).\n(20) Someshvar (Shak 1171 and 1182, A.D. 1249 and 1260).\n\nBesides the Th\u00e1na branch of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras, there was a South Konkan branch whose head-quarters are unknown and a Kolhapur branch whose head-quarters seem to have been at Panhalgadh the modern Panhala (J. B. R. A. S. XIII. 17). From the single inscription which has been found, the South Konkan branch appears to have included ten kings who ruled from about 808 to 1008, at first under the R\u00e1shttrakutas and then under the Ch\u00e1lukyas. The Kolhapur branch, of which eleven inscriptions are recorded, had sixteen kings who ruled from about 840 (?) to 1190. One of this dynasty Vijay\u00e1rv\u00e9d\u00e9v (1151) is described as restoring the dethroned lords of Th\u00e1na and Goa. J. B. R. A. S.

The story of the origin of the name is that Jimutv\u00e1han the mythical founder was the son of a spirit or Vidy\u00e1dhara, who under a curse became a man. At this time Vi\u00e1hnu's eagle, Garuda, conquered the serpent king V\u00e1suki and forced V\u00e1suki to give him one of his serpent subjects for his daily food. After a time it came to the lot of the serpent Shankhachuda to be sacrificed. He was taken to a stone, shila, and left for the eagle to devour. Jimutv\u00e1han resolved to save the victim, and placed himself on the rock instead of the serpent. When Garuda came, Jimutv\u00e1han said he was the victim and Garuda devoured him except his head. Meantime Jimutv\u00e1han's wife came, and finding her husband slain, reproached Garuda, who restored him to life and at her request ceased to devour the serpents. For this act of self-sacrifice Jimutv\u00e1han gained the name of the Rock-devoured, Shil\u00e1h\u00e1ra. J. R. A. S. (Old Series), IV. 113. Tawney's Kath\u00e1 Sarit S\u00e1gara, I. 174-186. A stanza from this story forms the beginning of all Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra copper-plate inscriptions.\nThe Silaharas seem to have remained under the Rashtrakutas till about the close of the tenth century, A.D. 997, when Aparajit assumed independent power. The Thana Silaharas seem to have held the greater part of the present districts of Thana and Kolaba. Their capital seems to have been Puri, and their places of note were Hamjamam probably Sanjan in Dahanu, Thana (Shristhanak), Sopara (Shurprak), Chaul (Chemuli), Lonad (Lavanatata), and Uran. As the Yadavs call themselves lords of the excellent city of Dvaravati pura or Dwarka and the Kadambas call themselves lords of the excellent city of Banavasi pura or Banavasi, so the Silaharas call themselves lords of the excellent city of Tagarapura or Tagar. This title would furnish a clue to the origin of the Silaharas if, unfortunately, the site of Tagar was not uncertain.\n\n1 See below, p. 424. The early Silaharas, though they call themselves Rajas and Konkan Chakravartis, seem to have been only Mahamandaleshvaras or Mahasamantadhipatis, that is great nobles. In two Kanheri cave inscriptions (Arch. Sur. X. 61, 62) the third Silahara king Kapardi II. (A.D. 853 to 877) is mentioned as a subordinate of the Rashtrakutas. Of the later Silaharas Anantapal A.D. 1094 and Aparaditya A.D. 1138 claim to be independent. Ind. Ant. IX. 45.\n\n2 The Silahara Puri, if, as seems likely, it is the same as the Maurya Puri (Ind. Ant. VIII. 244), was a coast town. Of the possible coast towns Thana and Chaul may be rejected, as they appear under the names of Shristhanak and Chemuli in inscriptions in which Puri also occurs (As. Res. I. 361, 364; Ind. Ant. IX. 38). Kalyan and Sopara may be given up as unsuitable for an attack by sea, and to Sopara there is the further objection that it appears in the same copper-plate in which Puri occurs. (Ind. Ant. IX. 38). There remain Mangalpuri or Magdhan in Salsette, Gharapuri or Elephanta, and Rajapuri or Janjira. Neither Mangalpuri (see Places of Interest, Magdhan) nor Rajapuri has remains of an old capital, so that perhaps the most likely identification of Puri is the Moreh landing or Bandar on the north-east corner of Gharapuri or Elephanta, where many ancient remains have been found. See Places of Interest, Elephanta, and Appendix A, Puri.\n\n3 Other places of less note mentioned in the inscriptions are Bhadran, Padgha, and Baggan villages, and the Kumbhari river in Bhiwandi, Kanheri in Bassein, and Chanje (Chadiye) village near Uran.\n\n4 Tagar has been identified by Wilford (As. Res. I. 369) with Devgiri or Daulatabad and by Dr. Burgess with Roza about four miles from Daulatabad (Bidar and Aurangabad, 55); Lassen and Yule place it doubtfully at Kulburga (Ditto); Pandit Bhagwanlal, already stated, at Junnar; Grant Duff (Maratha, 11) near Bhir on the Godavari; and Mr. J. F. Fleet, C.S., (Kanarese Dynasties, 99-103) at Kolhapur. Prof. Bhandarkar observes, 'The identification of Tagar with Devgiri is based on the supposition that the former name is a corruption of the latter. But that it is not so is proved by its occurrence as Tagar in the Silahara grants (A.D. 997-1094), and in a Chalukya grant of A.D. 612, the language of all of which is Sanskrit. The modern Junnar cannot have been Tagar, since the Greeks place Tagar ten days' journey to the east of Paithan. On the supposition that Junnar was Tagar, one would expect the Chalukya plate issued to a Brahman of Tagar to have been found at or near Junnar. But it was found at Haidarabad in the Deccan. The author of the Peripilus calls Tagar 'the greatest city' in Dakhinabades or Dakhinapath. The Silahara princes or chiefs, who formed three distinct branches of a dynasty that ruled over two parts of the Konkan and the country about Kolhapur, trace their origin to Jimutvahana, the Vidyadhara or demigod, and style themselves 'The lords of the excellent city of Tagar.' From this it would appear that the Silaharas were an ancient family, and that their original seat was Tagar whence they spread to the confines of the country. Tagar therefore was probably the centre of one of the earliest Aryan settlements in the Dandakaranya or 'forest of Dandaka,' as the Deccan or Maharashtra was called. These early settlements followed the course of the Godavari. Hence it is that in the formula repeated at the beginning of any religious ceremony in Maharashtra, the place where the ceremony is performed is alluded to by giving its bearing from the Godavari. People in Khandaesh use the words 'Godavarya uttara tire,' that is 'on the northern bank of the Godavari,' while those to the south of the river, as far as the borders of the country, use the expression 'Godavarya Dakshina tire' that is 'on the southern bank of the Godavari.' If then Tagar\nBesides the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra references, the only known Sanskrit notice of Tagar is in a Ch\u00e1lukya copper-plate found near Haidarabad in the Deccan and dated A.D. 612. As has been already noticed, the references to Tagar in Ptolemy and in the Periplus point to a city considerably to the east of Paithan, and the phrase in the Periplus, 'That many articles brought into Tagar from the parts along the coast were sent by wagons to Broach,' seems to show that Tagar was in communication with the Bay of Bengal, and was supported by the eastern trade, which in later times enriched M\u00e1lkhet, Kaly\u00e1n, Bidar, Golkonda, and Haidarabad.\n\nFrom numerous references and grants the Th\u00e1na Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras seem to have been worshippers of Shiv.\n\nOf Kapardi, the first of the Th\u00e1na Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras, nothing is known except that he claims descent from Jimutv\u00e1han. Pulashakti his son and successor, in an undated inscription in Kanheri Cave 78, is mentioned as the governor of Mangalpuri in the Konkan, and as the humble servant of (the R\u00e1shtakuta king) Amoghvarsh. The third king, Pulashakti's son, Kapardi II. was called the younger, laghu. Two inscriptions in Kanheri Caves 10 and 78, dated A.D. 853 and 877, seem to show that he was subordinate to the R\u00e1shtakutas. The son of Kapardi II. was the fourth king, Vappavanna, and his son was Jhanjha the fifth king. Jhanjha is mentioned by the Arab historian Masudi as ruling over Saimur (Chaul) in A.D. 916. He must have been a staunch Shaivite, as, according to a Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra copper-plate of A.D. 1094, he built twelve temples of Shambhu. According to an unpublished copper-plate in the possession of Pandit Bhagvanlal, Jhanjha had a daughter named Lasthiyavva, who was married to Bhillam the fourth king of the Ch\u00e1ndor Y\u00e1davs.\n\nThe next king was Jhanjha's brother Goggi, and after him came Goggi's son Vajjaddev. Of the eighth king, Vajjaddev's son Aparajit or Birundakaram, a copper-plate dated 997 (Shak 919) has lately been found at Bher, about ten miles north of Bhiwandi.\n\nwas one of the earliest of the \u00c1ryan settlements, it must be situated on or near the banks of the God\u00e1vari, as the ancient town of Paithan is; and its bearing from Paithan given by the Greek geographers agrees with this supposition, as the course of the God\u00e1vari from that point is nearly easterly. Tagar must therefore be looked for to the east of Paithan. If the name has undergone corruption, it must, by the Pr\u00e1krit law of dropping the initial mutes, be first changed to Taaraura, and thence to T\u00e1rur or Terur. Can it be the modern D\u00e1rur or Dh\u00e1run in the Nizam's dominions, twenty-five miles east of Grant Duff's Blair and seventy miles south-east of Paithan?\n\n1 Ind. Ant. VI. 75. 2 McCrindle, 126.\n3 The most marked passages are in a copper-plate of A.D. 1094, where the fifth king Thanjha is mentioned as having built twelve temples to Shambhu, and the tenth king, Arikeshari, as having, by direction of his father, visited Someshvar or Somnath, offering up before him the whole earth (Ind. Ant. IX. 37). The Kolhapur Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras appear to have been tolerant kings, as one copper-plate records grants to Mah\u00e1dev, Buddha, and Arhat (Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XIII. 17). Compare Mr. Fleet's K\u00e1nares Dynasties, 103.\n4 Prairies d'Or, II. 85. 5 Ind. Ant. IX. 35.\n6 The text is, 'Bh\u00e1ry\u00e1 yasya ca Jhanjhar\u00e1jatanay\u00e1 shri Lasthiyav\u00e1dhyaya.'

The next king was Apar\u0101j\u012bt's son Vajjadadev. The next king Arikeshari, Vajjadadev's brother, in a copper-plate grant dated A.D. 1097, is styled the lord of 1400 Konkan villages. Mention is also made of the cities of Shristh\u0101n\u0101k, Puri, and Hamyaman probably Sanj\u0101n. The eleventh king was Vajjadadev's son Chhittar\u0101jdev. In a copper-plate dated Shak 948 (A.D. 1025) he is styled the ruler of the 1400 Konkan villages, the chief of which were Puri and Hamyaman. The twelfth king was N\u0101g\u0101rjun, the younger brother of Chhittar\u0101jdev. After him came N\u0101g\u0101rjun's younger brother Mumuni or M\u0101mv\u0101ni, who is mentioned in an inscription dated A.D. 1060 (Shak 982). The fourteenth king was Mumuni or M\u0101mv\u0101ni's son Anantp\u0101l or Anantdev, whose name occurs in two grants dated A.D. 1081 and 1096. In the 1096 grant he is mentioned as ruling over the whole Konkan 1400 villages, the chief temple is in Lavanatata (Lon\u0101d), on the fourth of the dark half of Ash\u0101dha (June-July) Shak 919 (A.D. 997), as a Dakshin\u0101yana gift, that is a gift made on the occasion of the sun beginning to pass to the south. Apar\u0101j\u012bt's ministers were Sangalaiya and Sih\u0101paiya. The inscription was written by Sangalaiya's son Annapai.

Of Gomma and Aiyapdev nothing is known; of the third name only Bhillam the son-in-law of Hanjanha can be made out.\n3 Asiatic Researches, I. 357-367. This grant was found in 1787 while digging foundations in Th\u0101na fort. Arikeshari's ministers were V\u0101sapaiya and V\u0101rdhapaiva. The grant consists of several villages given to a family priest, the illustrious Tikka-paiya son of the illustrious astrologer Chhochhipaiya, an inhabitant of Shristh\u0101n\u0101k (Th\u0101na) on the occasion of a full eclipse of the moon in K\u0101rtik (October-November) Shak 939 (A.D. 1017) Pingala Samvatsara. The grant was written by the illustrious N\u0101g\u0101laiya, the great bard, and engraved on plates of copper by Vedapaiya's son M\u0101dharpaiya.\n4 Ind. Ant. V. 276-281. His ministers were the chief functionary Sarvadhih\u0101r\u012b the illustrious N\u0101ganaiya, the minister for peace and war the illustrious Sihapaiya, and the minister for peace and war for Karn\u0101ta (Kau\u015ba) the illustrious Kapardi. The grant, which is dated Sunday the fifteenth of the bright half of K\u0101rtik (October-November) Shak 948 (A.D. 1026) Kshaya Samvatsara is of a field in the village of Nour (the modern Naura two miles north of Bhandup) in the taluka of Shatashasthi (S\u0101lsette), included in Shristh\u0101n\u0101k (Th\u0101na). The donee is a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 Amadevaiya the son of Vipranadamaiya, who belonged to the Chhandogash\u0101kh\u0101 of the S\u0101mved.\n5 Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XII. 329-332. In this inscription, which is in the Ambarn\u0101th temple near Kaly\u0101n, he is called M\u0101mv\u0101nir\u0101jdev and his ministers are named Vinta (paiya), N\u0101ga\u1e47aiya, Vakadaiya, Jogalaiya, P\u0101dhiseya, and Bh\u0101laiya. The inscription records the construction of a temple of Chhittar\u0101jdev, that is a temple, the merit of building which counts to Chhittar\u0101jdev.\n6 The A.D. 1081 grant was found in Veher in S\u0101lsette and the 1096 grant in Kh\u0101rep\u0101tan in Devgad in the Ratn\u0101giri district. The Veher stone was found in 1881 and records a grant by Anantdev in Shak 1003 (A.D. 1081), the chief minister being Rudrapai. The inscription mentions Ajap\u0101laiya son of M\u0101taiya of the Vy\u0101dika family and the grant of some dr\u0101mmas to khird\u0101s\u0101 mand\u0101[?] (Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101). The Kh\u0101rep\u0101tan copper-plates were found several years ago and give the names of all the thirteen Sil\u0101h\u0101ra kings before Anantdev. Ind. Ant. IX, 33-46.\nof which was Puri and next to it Hanjamana probably Sanj\u00e1n, and as having cast into the ocean of the edge of his sword those wicked heaps of sin, who at a time of misfortune, caused by the rise to power of hostile relatives, devastated the whole Konkan, harassing gods and Br\u0101hmans.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe names of six Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra kings later than Anantdev have been made out from land-grant stones. As these stones do not give a pedigree, the order and relationship of the kings cannot be determined.\n\nThe first of these kings is Apar\u00e1ditya, who is mentioned in a stone dated A.D. 1138 (Shak 1060).\\(^2\\) The next king is Harip\u00e1ldev, who is mentioned in three stones dated 1149, 1150, and 1153 (Shak 1071, 1072 and 1075).\\(^3\\)\n\nThe next king is Mallik\u00e1rjun, of whom two grants are recorded, one from Chiplun in Ratn\u00e1giri dated 1156 (Shak 1078), the other from Bassein dated 1160 (Shak 1082). This Mallik\u00e1rjun seems to be the Konkan king, who was defeated near Bals\u00e1r by A\u2019mbada the general of the Gujar\u00e1t king Kum\u00e1rp\u00e1l Solanki (A.D. 1143-1174).\\(^4\\) Next comes\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This account refers to some civil strife of which nothing is known (Ind. Ant. IX, 41). Anantdev\u2019s ministers were the illustrious Nauvitaka V\u00e1sada, Rishibhadra, the illustrious P\u00e1dhise\u00f1 Mah\u00e1devayya prabhu, and Somanaya prabhu. The grant is dated the first day of the bright half of Magh (January-February) in the year Shak 1016 (A.D. 1094), Bh\u00e1v Samvatsara. It consists of an exemption from tolls for all carts belonging to the great minister the illustrious B\u00e1bhavana shresthi, the son of the great minister Durgashreshthi or Valipavan\u00e1, probably P\u00e1lpattana or the city of P\u00e1l near Mah\u00e1d in Kol\u00e1ha, and his brother the illustrious Dhanamahreshthi. Their carts may come into any of the ports, Shristh\u00e1nak, N\u00e1gapur perhaps N\u00e1gothna, Shurpr\u00e1k, Chemuli, and others included within the Konkan 1400. They are also freed from the toll on the ingress or egress of those who carry on the business of norika (?).\n\n\\(^2\\) This stone, which was found in 1881 at Ch\u00e1nje near Uran in the Karanja petty division, records the grant of a field in N\u00e1gum, probably the modern N\u00e1gao\u1e47 about four miles west of Uran, for the merit of his mother Lil\u00e1devi; and another grant of a garden in Chadija (Ch\u00e1nge) village. This is the Apar\u00e1ditya \u2018king of the Konkan,\u2019 who is mentioned in Manhas\u2019s Shrikanthacharita (a book found by Dr. B\u00fchler in Kashmir and ascribed by him to A.D. 1135-1145) as sending Tejakanth from Shurpr\u00e1k (Sop\u00e1ra) to the literary congress held at Kashmir, of which details are given in that book. Jour. B.B. R. A. S. XII. Extra Number, 51 ; cvx.\n\n\\(^3\\) The 1149 stone is built into the plinth of the back veranda of the house of one Jair\u00e1m B\u00e1h\u015bkar Son\u00e1r at Sop\u00e1ra. It records a gift. The name of the king is doubtful. It may be also read Kurp\u00e1ldev. The 1150 stone was found near Ag\u00e1shi in 1881. It is dated 1st M\u00e1rgh\u00e1sh\u00edr (December-January), in the Pramoda Samvatsara, Shak 1072 (A.D. 1150). Harip\u00e1l\u2019s ministers were Vespad\u00e1l, Lakshman prabhu, Padm\u00e1shiv\u00e1ra, and V\u00e1sugi n\u00e1yak. The grant is of the permanent income of Shr\u00ednvadi in charge of a Pattakil (P\u00e1til) named R\u00e1ja, to the family priest Brahmadevbhatt son of Div\u00e1karbhatt and grandson of Govardhanbhatt, by prince Ahavamalla enjoying the village of Vatt\u00e1rak (Vst\u00e1r) in Shurpr\u00e1k (Sop\u00e1ra). The witnesses to the grant are Risi Mh\u00e1tara, head of Vatt\u00e1rak village, N\u00e1guj\u00ed Mh\u00e1tara, Anantm\u00e1yak, and Ch\u00e1ngdev Mh\u00e1tara. Pandit Bhagv\u00e1nl\u00e1. There is another inscription of Harip\u00e1ldev on a stone found in Karanjon in Bassein. The inscription is of thirteen lines, which are very hard to read. In the third and fourth lines can be read very doubtfully \u2018the illustrious Harip\u00e1ldev, the chief of the Mah\u00e1mandaleshvaras, adorned with all the royal titles.\u2019 The 1153 stone was found near Borivli station in 1882. The inscription is in nine lines, and bears date Shak 1075, Shrimukh Samvatsara and the name of king Harip\u00e1l.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Kum\u00e1rp\u00e1l Charitra (A.D. 1170) which gives details of this defeat of Mallik\u00e1rjun (see below p. 436) describes Mallik\u00e1rjun\u2019s father as Mah\u00e1nand, and his capital as Shat\u00e1nandap\u00far \u2018surrounded by the ocean\u2019 (Shat\u00e1nandap\u00fare jaladhiveshtite Mah\u00e1nando raja). Mah\u00e1nand is an addition to the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra table, but the form appears doubtful and does not correspond with the name of any of the preceding or succeeding kings. \u2018Surrounded by the ocean\u2019 might apply to a town either in S\u00e1lsetse or on Sop\u00e1ra island. But the epithet applies much better to a town on Elephanta island.\nApar\u0101ditya II., of whom there are four land-grant stones, three of them dated, one in 1184 (Shak 1106) and two in 1187 (Shak 1109), and one undated.\n\nThe next king is Keshidev, son of Apar\u0101rka (Apar\u0101ditya II.), two of whose land-grant stones have been found, one dated 1203 (Shak 1125) the other 1238 (Shak 1161).\n\nThe next is Someshvar, two of whose land-grant stones have been found, one dated 1249 (Shak 1171) the other 1260 (Shak 1182).\n\nand the similarity in name suggests that Shat\u0101nandapur may be Santapur an old name for Elephanta. See Places of Interest, 31-82. Mallik\u0101rjun\u2019s Chiplun stone was found in 1880 by Mr. Falle, of the Marine Survey, under a wall in Chiplun (Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XIV. p. xxxv.) It is now in the museum of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The writing gives the name of Mallik\u0101rjun and bears date Shak 1078 (A.D. 1156). His ministers were N\u0101gala\u015bya and Lakshmanaiya\u2019s son Anantug\u012b (Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l). The Basein stone styles the king \u2018Shri-Sil\u0101h\u0101ra Mallik\u0101rjun\u2019 and the date given is Shak 1082 (A.D. 1160).

Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l.\n\n1 The 1184 (Shak 1106) stone was found in February 1882 about a mile south-west of Lon\u0101d in Bhiwandi. Of the two Shak 1109 (A.D. 1187) stones, one found near Government House, Parel, records a grant by Apar\u0101ditya, the ruler of the Konkan, of 24 dramma coins after exempting other taxes, the fixed revenue of one cart in the village of Mah\u016bl (probably the modern Mahul near Kurda) connected with Shatashashthi, which is in the possession of Anantpai prabhu, for performing the worship by five rites of (the god) Vaidyan\u0101th, lord of Darbh\u0101vati. The last line of the inscription shows that it was written by a K\u0101yasth named V\u0101lig Pandit (Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XII. 335). The second Shak 1109 (A.D. 1187) stone is in the museum of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. It is dated Shak 1109 (A.D. 1187) Vishv\u0101vasu Samavatsara, on Sunday the sixth of the bright half of Chaitra (April-May). The grantor is the great minister Lakshma\u1e47nayaka, son of Bh\u0101skar\u1e47ayaka, and something is said in the grant about the god Somn\u0101th of Sur\u0101shtra (Ind. Ant. IX. 49). The fourth stone, which bears no date, was found near Kalambhoom in Basein in 1882. It gives the name of Apar\u0101ditya, and from the late form of the letters probably belongs to this king. A fifth stone has recently been found near Basein. The date is doubtful; it looks like Shak 1107 (A.D. 1185). Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l.\n\n2 The Shak 1125 (A.D. 1203) stone was found in 1881 near M\u0101ndvi in Basein. It records the grant of something for offerings, naivedya, to the god Lakshmin\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47 in the reign of the illustrious Keshidev. Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l. The Shak 1161 (A.D. 1238) stone was found near Lon\u0101d village in Bhiwandi in February 1882. It bears date the thirteenth of the dark half of M\u0101gh (February-March) and records the grant by Keshidev the son of Apar\u0101rka of the village of Brahmapuri, to one Kavi Soman, devoted to the worship of Shompeshvar Mah\u0101dev. The inscription describes Brahmapuri as \u2018pleasing by reason of its Shaiva temples.\u2019 A field or hamlet called M\u0101jaspalli in B\u0101gr\u0101m, the modern B\u0101gaon near Lon\u0101d, is granted by the same inscription to four worshippers in front of the image of Shompeshvar. Apar\u0101rka, Keshidev\u2019s father, is probably the Apar\u0101ditya (arka and \u0101ditya both meaning the sun) the author of the commentary called Apar\u0101rka on Y\u0101navalkya\u2019s law book the Mit\u0101kshara. At the end of the commentary is written: Thus ends the Penance Chapter in the commentary on the Hindu law of Y\u0101navalkya made by the illustrious Apar\u0101ditya of the family of Jimutvahan, the Sil\u0101h\u0101ra king of the dynasty of the illustrious Vidy\u0101dhara. Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XII. 335 and Extra Number, 52. Apar\u0101rka is cited by an author of the beginning of the thirteenth century. Jour. B. B. R. A. S. IX. 161.\n\n3 The Shak 1171 (A.D. 1249) stone was found in R\u0101nvad near Uran. In this stone the Sil\u0101h\u0101ra king Someshvar grants land in Padivase village in Uran to purify him from sins. The Shak 1182 (A.D. 1260) stone was found in Ch\u0101nje also near Uran. It records the grant by the Konkan monarch Someshvar of 162 p\u0101rutha (Parthian?) dramma coins, being the fixed income of a garden in Konthalesth\u0101n in Chadiche (Ch\u0101nje) village in Uran, to Utt\u0101reshvar Mah\u0101dev of Shri-Sth\u0101nak (Th\u0101na). The boundary on the west is the royal or high road, r\u0101jpath. Someshvar\u2019s ministers were Jh\u0101mpadprabhu, Main\u0101ku, Bebalaprabhu, Peramde Pandit, and P\u0101dhigovemaku, Pandit Bhagv\u0101nl\u0101l.\nThough, with few exceptions, the names of the Th\u00e1na Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras are Sanskrit the names of almost all their ministers and of many of the grantees point to a K\u00e1narese or a Telugu source. They appear to be southerners, and ayyas or high-caste Dravidian Hindus seem to have had considerable influence at their court. K\u00e1yasths, probably the ancestors of the present K\u00e1yasth Prabhus, are also mentioned.\n\nThough their grants are written in Sanskrit, sometimes pure sometimes faulty, from the last three lines of one of their stone inscriptions, the language of the country appears to have been a corrupt Pr\u00e1krit, the mother of the modern Mar\u00e1thi. The same remark applies to the names of towns. For, though inscriptions give such Sanskritized forms as Shri-Sth\u00e1nak, Shurpr\u00e1k, and Hanjaman or Han\u00fdaman, the writings of contemporary Arab travellers show that the present names Th\u00e1na, Sop\u00e1ra, and Sanj\u00e1n were then in use.\n\nOn the condition of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra kingdom the inscriptions throw little light. The administration appears to have been carried on by the king assisted by a great councillor or great minister, a great minister for peace and war, two treasury lords, and sometimes a (chief) secretary. The subordinate machinery seems to have consisted of heads of districts r\u00e1shtras, heads of sub-divisions vishayas, heads of towns, and heads of villages. They had a king's high road, r\u00e1jpath, passing to the west of the village of Gomvani a little north of Bh\u00e1ndup, following nearly the same line as the present road from Bombay to Th\u00e1na; and there was another king's high-road near Uran. At their ports, among which Sop\u00e1ra, Th\u00e1na, Chaul, and perhaps N\u00e1gothna are mentioned, a customs duty was levied. The dramma was the current coin. The Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras seem to have been fond of building. The Muhammadans in the beginning of the thirteenth century and the Portuguese in the sixteenth century destroyed temples and stone-faced reservoirs by the score. The statements of travellers and the remains at Ambarn\u00e1th, Pel\u00e1r,\n\n---\n\n1 Ind. Ant. IX. 46. This southern element is one reason for looking for Tagar in the Telugu-speaking districts. Ayya the K\u00e1narese for master is the term in ordinary use in the Bombay Karn\u00e1tak for Jangam or Lingayat priests. The S\u00e1rasvat Br\u00e1hmans of North K\u00e1nara are at present passing through the stage, which the upper classes of the North Konkan seem to have passed through about 500 years ago, of discarding the southern ayya for the northern r\u0101o.\n\n2 Jour.

V. 280; and IX. 38. The name pattakil (modern p\u00e1t\u00edl) used in stone inscriptions seems to show that the villages were in charge of headmen.\n\n5 Drammas, which are still found in the Konkan, are believed by Pandit Bhagv\u00e1n\u00edl to be the coins of a corrupt Sassanian type which are better known as Gadhi\u00e1 paisa or ass-money. Jour. B. B. R. A. S. XII. 325-325. The P\u00e1rvatha Drammas mentioned in note 3, p. 427, seem to be Parthian Drammas. Perhaps they are the same as the coins mentioned by Abu-l-fida as Khur\u00e1sani dirhems, and by Masudi (Prairies d'Or, I. 382) and Sulaim\u00e1n (Elliot and Dowson, I. 3) as T\u00e1tariya or Tahiriye dirhems. General Cunningham (Anc. Geog. 313) identifies these T\u00e1tariya dirhems with the Scythic or Indo-Sassanian coins of Kabul and north-west India of the centuries before and after Christ, and Mr. Thomas (Elliot and Dowson, I. 4) with the Musalm\u00e1n dynasty of Tahirides who ruled in Khur\u00e1san in the ninth century.\n\u00c1tgaon, P\u00e1rol, W\u00e1lukeshvar in Bombay, and Lon\u00e1d prove that the masonry was of well-dressed close-fitting blocks of stone, and that the sculptures were carved with much skill and richness. Many of them seem to have been disfigured by indecency. Some of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras seem to have encouraged learning. One of them Apar\u00e1ditya II. (1187) was an author, and another Apar\u00e1ditya I. (1138) is mentioned as sending a Konkan representative to a great meeting of learned men in K\u00e1shmir.\n\nMusalm\u00e1n writers supplement the scanty information which local sources supply of Th\u00e1na under the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras.\n\nThe chief local centres of trade were Th\u00e1na, which is mentioned as a mart by the Arab writers of the ninth and tenth centuries, as a pretty town in the twelfth century, and as the head-quarters of a chief and a place of much traffic and of many ships at the end of the thirteenth century. Chaul (Saimur) is mentioned as a place of trade and a great city in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and as a large and well-built town in the twelfth. Sari\u00e1n was a mart and great city in the tenth century, and large and prosperous in the twelfth. Sop\u00e1ra was a mart in the tenth and eleventh centuries, and one of the chief marts in India in the twelfth. The chief ports with which the Th\u00e1na coast was connected were Kulam or Quilon and Kalikat in Malab\u00e1r; Broach, Cambay, and Somn\u00e1th in Gujar\u00e1t; Dihval in Sindh; Basr\u00e1h, Obollah, Siraf, Kis, and Ormuz on the Persian Gulf; Kalatu or Kalhat, Dufar, Shohr, and Aden on the east Arabian coast; Socotra at the mouth of the Red Sea; Jidda within the Red Sea; Zaila, Makdashu, Mombaza, and Quilon on the African coast; and Kalah in the Malay Peninsula, J\u00e1va, Malacca, and China.\n\nThe articles that formed the trade of the Th\u00e1na ports were, of Food, rice grown in the Konkan and sent to the Arabian and African ports; salt made in the Th\u00e1na creeks and sent in bags inland to Devgiri and other Deccan centres; cocoanuts, mangoes, lemons, and betelnuts and leaves grown in Th\u00e1na and probably sent inland and by sea to Sindh, the Persian Gulf, and the\n\n---\n\n1 Details of these remains are given under Places of Interest.

Of Spices, pepper, ginger, turbit, cinnamon, and cloves came from J\u00e1va and Ceylon in Chinese ships and from the Malab\u00e1r coast. Of articles of Dress, cotton was brought from Kh\u00e1ndesh and the Deccan and either worked into cloth or sent raw to Ethiopia. Good cotton cloth of Konkan or Deccan weaving went to Ceylon, the Straits, and China; and delicate and beautiful fabrics, probably the muslins of Burh\u00e1npur and Paithan, went to Kalikat and probably to Persia and Arabia. Silks were made locally and probably brought from Persia and from China. There was a large manufacture of laced shoes in Sop\u00e1ra and Sanj\u00e1n, and a great export of excellent leather, chiefly to Arabia. Of Precious Stones pearls were found in the creeks near Sop\u00e1ra, and were brought from Travankor, from Ceylon, and from Sof\u00e1la in Africa; emeralds, equal to the best in brightness and colour but hard and heavy, were exported from Sanj\u00e1n; coral was brought from the Red Sea; and ivory was brought from Sof\u00e1la and Madagascar and used locally and sent to the Persian Gulf. Of Drugs and Perfumes, Th\u00e1na was famous for the drug tab\u00e1shir, which was made from the inner rind of the bamboo and sent to all marts both east and west; brown incense, probably the resin of the gugal, Balsamodendron mukul, perhaps the bdellium of the ancients, was gathered in the Th\u00e1na forests and probably sent to Arabia and China; white incense was brought from the Arabian coast; sandalwood and ambergris came from Socotra and the African coast; and aloes, camphor, sandal, sapan or brazil wood, lign aloes or eaglewood, and spikenard from Siam, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, either direct or through Ceylon.

Of articles used as Money, cauries came from the Maldives and from Sof\u00e1la in Africa, dirhams from Khur\u00e1san and dinars from Sindh, gold-dust from Sof\u00e1la, and gold and silver from Malacca, Sumatra, and China. Of other Metals, iron was brought from Sof\u00e1la and made into steel; copper was brought from Persia and from China in large quantities as ballast, and lead and tin came from Malacca. Of Timber, teak and bamboos were sent from Sanj\u00e1n to the Persian Gulf and there used for house-building; and fancy woods, such as sandal and brazil wood, were brought from Kalah in the Malay Peninsula. The chief trade in Animals was, towards the close of the period (1290), a great import of horses from the Persian Gulf and from Arabia. No ships came to Th\u00e1na without horses, and the Th\u00e1na chief was so anxious to secure them that he agreed not to trouble the pirates so long as they let him have the horses as his share of the plunder. This great demand for horses seems to have risen from the scare among the Hindu rulers of the Deccan caused by the Musalm\u00e1n cavalry. As many as 10,000 horses a year are said to have been imported. Of Human Beings, women, eunuchs, and boys are said to have been brought by Jews through the Persian Gulf, and slaves are mentioned as sent from Sof\u00e1la in Africa.\n\nThe merchants who carried on the Th\u00e1na trade were local Hindu, Musalm\u00e1n, and P\u00e1rsi traders, and Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns from Gujar\u00e1t and from the Malab\u00e1r coast. There were also foreign Persians and Arabs, Jews, Europeans, and perhaps a chance Chinaman. The fact noticed by several of the Arab writers of the ninth and tenth centuries, that the language of the Th\u00e1na ports was L\u00e1r, seems to show that, as is still the case in Bombay, the trade tongue of the Th\u00e1na ports was Gujar\u00e1ti, and the leading traders\n\n---\n\n1 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, II, 186, 190.\n2 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, lviii.\n3 Maldives Al Biruni (1020) in Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, cclxxxviii.; Sof\u00e1la Ibn Aluardy (950), Ditto, ccvii.\n4 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccvii., cdxv.; Marco Polo, II, 229, \u00a7225.\n5 Ibn Aluardy (950) Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccvii.\n6 Yule's Marco Polo, II, 325, 330.\n7 Masudi (916) Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, cdxv.; Abu Mohalhal (940) Yule's Cathay, cxci.\n8 Ibn Khurd\u00e1dha (900) Elliot, I, 15; Ouseley's Persia, I, 175. Bil\u00e1duri, \u00a750 (Elliot, I, 129) mentions that the largest teak tree ever known was sent from Sind\u00e1n to the Khalif. But it is doubtful whether this Sind\u00e1n is not the Kutch Sanj\u00e1n and the teak Malab\u00e1r teak. Idrisi, 1135, (Major's India in XV. Century, xxvi.) calls the Konkan the land of teak, s\u00e1g, and notices, that teak was used for house building in the Persian Gulf. Besides for house-building the bamboos were used for spear handles. They were in great demand among the Arabs, and were known as El-Khatif bamboos from the town of that name on the mainland near Bahrein island. Like the Bahrein cotton and teak, which were famous in Persia and Arabia in the century before Christ, these El-Khatif bamboos were Indian. See Rawlinson in J. R. A. S. XII. (New Series), 225.\n9 Mohalhal (940) (Yule's Cathay, cxci.) has Saimuri wood brought to Saimur or Chaul for sale. This may be sandalwood from the Kanara forests, for which Sop\u00e1ra in early times was famous. But the passage is doubtful. It may refer to Timur in the extreme east whose sandalwood was also famous.\n10 Yule's Marco Polo, II, 330.

The local Musalm\u00e1n merchants, settlers chiefly from the Persian Gulf, held a strong position. In 916, when Masudi visited Chaul, there were 10,000 Persian and Arab-settlers in that city alone. The Balh\u00e1ras or Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras were famous for their kindness to Arabs, allowing them to have mosques and a headman to settle disputes. By the beginning of the tenth century the Parsis seem to have risen to wealth in Sanj\u00e1n, and to have spread and built fire-temples in Chaul. Hindus, as in former periods, freely left their homes and crossed the seas. Hiwen Thsang, about 650, heard that in Saur\u00e1shth\u00e1n probably Ctesiphon in Persia, there were several Br\u00e1hman and Buddhist monasteries. In the best days of the Bagd\u00e1d Khalifat (700-900), learned Hindus were much sought for, and many physicians and astronomers were settled at the court of the Khalifs, and afterwards (1290) at the court of Arghun the Moghal king of Persia. Indian merchants were settled in Arabia and at Kish in the Persian Gulf. Of foreign merchants, besides Persians and Arabs, the great carriers at the beginning of the tenth century were Jews. They could speak Persian, Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and Russian, and passed to India either down the Red Sea or by Antioch and Bagd\u00e1d through the Persian Gulf. At the same time, Russian, Spanish, and French merchants also passed through Mesopotamia to India.\n\nThe ships that carried the trade of the Th\u00e1na ports were Konkan Gujar\u00e1t and Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r vessels, boats built in the Persian Gulf, and perhaps an occasional junk from Java or China.

Their sacred threads (which Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis used to wear), their tenderness of life, their temperance, their trust in omens, and their faithfulness as agents all point to Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1nis from Th\u00e1na or from Cambay.\n\n2 Masudi's Prairies d'Or, II. 85, 86.\n\n3 Reinand's Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 157; Julien's Mem.

These agents took charge of the goods and sold them in the most loyal manner, seeking zealously the profit of the foreigner and asking no commission except what he pleased to give. However immoral he may be in bargaining, the Gujar\u00e1t V\u00e1n\u00ed agent is still loyal to his employer.\n\n8 Ibn Khurd\u00e1dba (912) Reinand's Abu-l-fida, lix. About this time (883) the Indian sea and the west coast of India were first visited by Englishmen, Sighelm or Suithelm bishop of Shireburn, and Athalstan the ambassadors from Alfred the Great (871-900) to the Indian Christians of St. Thomas. Turner (Anglo-Saxons, 317) is doubtful whether the ambassadors went by the Red Sea or the Persian Gulf. According to Reinand (Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 210) they probably took ship in the Persian Gulf and sailed to Quilon. Alfred's wealth of spices and other oriental products suggests that religion was not the only motive that prompted this embassy.

The Arab vessels, some of which were built at Shir\u00e1z in the Persian Gulf, were of two kinds, a larger that sailed to Africe, Calcutta, Malacca, and China, and a smaller that went to India.\u00b9 Marco Polo described the ships of the Persian Gulf, perhaps these were the smaller vessels, as wretched affairs with no iron, bound with wooden bolts, and stitched with twine. They had one mast, one sail, one rudder, and no deck. A cover of hides was spread over the cargo, and on this horses were put and taken to India. It was a perilous business voyaging in one of these ships, and many were lost.\u00b2 Great Chinese junks occasionally visited the Th\u00e1na ports.\u00b3 The war ships shown in the Eksar memorial stones of the eleventh or twelfth century are high-peaked vessels with one mast and nine or ten cars aside.\u2074\n\nThe chief sailors were Hindus, Arabs, and Chinese. European travellers had no high opinion of their skill or courage as seamen. According to John of Monte Corvino (1292) the Persian Gulf mariners were few and far from good. If a ship made her voyage it was by God\u2019s guidance, not by the skill of man.\u2075 Though all made voyages across the sea, they preferred as much as possible to hug the coast.\u2076\n\nBesides storms the Indian seas were full of dangers. Whales, water-spouts, and the giant bird the Ruk kept seamen in unceasing alarm.\u2077 But the worst of all dangers was from pirates. During the greater part of this period the sea swarmed with pirates. In the eighth and ninth centuries, Sang\u00e1rs, Kerks, and Meds sallied from the coasts of Sindh, Cutch, and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and ravaged the banks of the Euphrates and even the coasts of the Red Sea as far as Jidda.\u2078 In the seventh century the islands of Bahrein in the\n\n\u00b9 Reinaud\u2019s Abu-l-fida, cdxii.\n\u00b2 Yule\u2019s Marco Polo, I. 102; John of Monte Corvino (1292) Yule\u2019s Cathay, I. 218; Reinaud\u2019s Abu-l-fida, cdxxiii.\n\u00b3 It is possible (Yule\u2019s Ed. I. liii.) that Marco Polo\u2019s fleet of thirteen Chinese ships passed the stormy months of 1292 (May-September) in Bombay harbour. Polo has left the following details of the ships. They were made of a double thickness of firwood, fastened with good iron nails, and daubed with lime, chopped hemp, and wood oil. They could carry from 5000 to 6000 baskets of pepper. They were divided into some thirteen water-tight compartments, and were fitted with from fifty to sixty cabins in which the merchants lived greatly at their ease. They had large sweeps each pulled by four men and four regular and two extra masts. They had twelve sails and one rudder. The crew varied from 200 to 300 men.

Towards the close of the thirteenth century Marco Polo found Bombay harbour haunted by sea-robbers. From the Malabar and Gujar\u00e1t ports numbers of corsairs, as many as a hundred vessels, stayed out the whole summer with their wives and children. They stretched, five or six miles apart, in fleets of from twenty to thirty boats, and whenever one caught sight of a merchant vessel, he raised a smoke, and all who saw, gathered, boarded, and plundered the ship, but let it go hoping again to fall in with it. Socotra was still frequented by pirates, who encamped there and offered their plunder for sale.\n\nWhile its local rulers were the Silaharas, the overlords of the Konkan, to whom the Silaharas paid obeisance during the latter part of the eighth and the ninth centuries, were the Rashtrakutas of Malkhet, sixty miles south-east of Sholapur. Their power for a time included a great part of the present Gujar\u00e1t where their headquarters were at Broach. The Arab merchant Sulaiman (A.D. 850) found the Konkan (Komkam) under the Balhara, the chief of Indian princes. The Balhara and his people were most friendly to Arabs. He was at war with the Gujar (Juzr) king, who, except in the matter of cavalry, was greatly his inferior. Sixty years later Masudi (916) makes the whole province of L\u00e4r, from Chaul (Saimur) to Cambay, subject to the Balhara, whose capital was Mankir (Malkhet) the 'great centre' in the Kanarese-speaking country about 640 miles from the coast. He was overlord of the Konkan (Kemker) and of the whole province of L\u00e4r in which were Chaul (Saimur), Thana, and Sup\u00e1ra, where the Lariya language was spoken. The Balhara was the most friendly to Musalmans of all Indian kings. He was exposed to the attacks of the Gujar (Juzr) king who was rich in camels and horses. The name Balhara was the name of the founder of the dynasty, and all the princes took it on succeeding to the throne.

Tod (Western India, 147, 160) held that Balhara meant the leaders of the Balla tribe, whose name appears in the ancient capital Valabhi (A.D. 480), probably the present village of Valleh about twenty miles west of Bhavnagar in Kathiawar. Elliot (History, I. 354) has adopted Tod's suggestion, modifying it slightly so as to make Balhara stand for the Ballahi, or\nL\u00e1ra was governed by Jhanja the fifth of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra rulers. For fifty years more (950) the R\u00e1shtarakutas continued overlords of the Konkan, and of L\u00e1ra as far north as Cambay. Soon after the beginning of the reign of Mulr\u00e1j (943-997), the Chaulukya or Solanki ruler of North Gujar\u00e1t, his dominions were invaded from the south by B\u00e1rap, or Dv\u00e1rap, the general of Tailap II.

B\u00e1rap established himself in South Gujar\u00e1t or L\u00e1t, and, according to Gujar\u00e1t accounts, towards the close of Mulr\u00e1j\u2019s reign, was attacked and defeated, though after his victory Mulr\u00e1j withdrew north of the Narbada. In this war B\u00e1rap is said to have been helped by the chiefs of the islands, perhaps a reference to the Th\u00e1na Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras. It appears from a copper-plate lately (1881) found in Surat, that, after Mulr\u00e1j\u2019s invasion, B\u00e1rap and four successors continued to rule L\u00e1t till 1050.\n\nBallabh, R\u00e9. Reinaud (Memoir Sur l\u2019Inde, I45) explained Balhara by Malvar\u00e1i lord of M\u00e1lva, and Mr. Thomas has lately adopted the view that Balh\u00e1ra is Bara R\u00e9i, or great king, and holds that his capital was Monghir in Beh\u00e1r (Numismata Orientalia, Vol. III.) The objection to these views is, as the following passages show, that the two Arab travellers who knew the country of the Balh\u00e1ras, Sulaim\u00e1n (850) and Masudi (915), agree in placing it in the Konkan and Deccan. Sulaim\u00e1n (Elliot and Dowson, I. 4) says the Balh\u00e1ra\u2019s territory begins at the Konkam or Koukan, Masudi says (Prairies d\u2019Or, I. 177, 331), the capital of the Balh\u00e1ra is Mankir, the sea-board Saimur or Chaul, Sop\u00e1ta, and Th\u00e1na, and again (I. 383) the Balh\u00e1ra\u2019s kingdom is called the Konkan (Kemker). Again the Balh\u00e1ra of Mankir ruled in Sind\u00e1n, Sanjan in north Th\u00e1na, and the neighbourhood of Cambay in Gujar\u00e1t (Ditto, I. 294; III. 47). This Gujar\u00e1t power of the R\u00e1shtarakutas at the opening of the tenth century is proved by local inscriptions. Ind. Ant. VI. 145. Finally L\u00e1ra, or the North Konkan coast, was under the Balh\u00e1ra, and Masudi in 916 (H. 304) visited Saimur, or Chaul, one of the chief of the Balh\u00e1ra towns (Ditto, II. 85), which was then under a local prince named Jandja. This is the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra Jhanja. (See above, p. 424.)\n\nIdrisi (1135) is the only authority who places the seat of Balh\u00e1ra power in Gujar\u00e1t (Jaubert, I. 176; Elliot, I. 87, 88). The Anhilv\u00e1da sovereigns had before this (R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 62) adopted the title of King of Kings, r\u00e9j\u00e9 of r\u00e9j\u00e1s, and Idrisi seems to have taken for granted that this title was Balh\u00e1ra, which Ibn Khurd\u00e1dbha (912), who never was in India, had, by mistake, translated king of kings (Elliot, I. 13). The true origin of the title Balh\u00e1ra, that it was the name of the founder of the dynasty, is given by Masudi (Prairies d\u2019Or, I. 162), and neither Sulaim\u00e1n (850), Al Istakhir (951), nor Ibn Haukal (970), all of whom visited India, translate Balh\u00e1ra, king of kings (see Elliot, I. 4, 27, 34). The details of the Balh\u00e1ra kings given by Sulaim\u00e1n, Masudi, Al Istakhir, and Ibn Haukal, show that their territory began from the Konkan and stretched across India, and that their capital was Mankir, inland in the K\u00e1narase (Kiriah) speaking country. These details point to the R\u00e1shtarakutas of M\u00e1lkhott, who were overlords of the Konkan from about 750 to 970. At the same time the R\u00e1shtarakutas seem to have no claim to the title Balh\u00e1ra. As far as present information goes the name never appears as one of the titles of the dynasty, not even as a title of one of the kings. Dr. B\u00fchler (Ind. Ant. VI. 64) has suggested that the proper form of Balh\u00e1ra is Bhatt\u00e1raka or lord; but so extreme a change seems hardly possible. It seems more likely that Balh\u00e1ra, or Al Balh\u00e1ra as it is written, should be read Al Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra, the difference between the two words disappearing in a manuscript written without diacritical points. The Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras were then the rulers of the Konkan, and, as Masudi states, the title Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra is the name of the founder of the dynasty. None of the Musalm\u00e1n writers, who mention the Balh\u00e1ra, seems to have visited either the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra or the R\u00e1shtarakuta capital. To strangers, whose informants were coast-town merchants, confusion between the local rulers and their Deccan overlords was not unnatural. This identification of Balh\u00e1ra with Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra has been suggested by Pandit Bhagy\u00e1n\u00e1lal Indraj\u00ed.\n\n1 Prairies d\u2019Or, II. 85. Jhanja (see above, p. 424) is the fifth Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra king.\n2 See Al Istakhir (950) and Ibn Haukal (943-976) in Elliot, I. 27, 34.\n3 Ind. Ant. V. 317; VI. 184; R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 38, 46.\n4 The kings are B\u00e1rappa, who is described as having obtained L\u00e1tdesh; (2) Agniraj (Gongiraj?), who freed and reconquered the land encroached on by his enemies;\nBetween the overthrow of the power of M\u00e1lkhet (A.D. 970) and the establishment of the overlordship of Gujar\u00e1t (A.D. 1151), the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra rulers of the North Konkan claim independence, and, during part at least of this time, Th\u00e1na was the capital of the Konkan. Between the death of Mulr\u00e1j (997) and the succession of Bhimdev I. (1022-1072), the power of Gujar\u00e1t did not increase. But Bhimdev took the title of R\u00e1ja of R\u00e1j\u00e1s, and spent most of his reign in spreading his power northwards and in a great contest with Visaldev of Ajmir. Neither Bhimr\u00e1j nor his successor Karan (1072-1094) advanced his borders to the south. Nor does Sidhr\u00e1j (1094-1143), the glory of the Gujar\u00e1t Ch\u00e1lukyas, though he spread his arms over so much of the Deccan as to fill with fear the chief of Kolhapur, seem to have exercised control over the Konkan. Idrisi (1135), whose details of Anhilv\u00e1da (Nahrw\u00e1ra) seem to belong to Sidhr\u00e1j\u2019s reign, calls him King of Kings. He shows how wealthy and prosperous Gujar\u00e1t then was, but gives no information about the extent of Sidhr\u00e1j\u2019s power. Idrisi\u2019s mention of Th\u00e1na (Bana) seems to show that it was unconnected with Gujar\u00e1t, and this is borne out by the account of Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l\u2019s (1143-1174) invasion of the Konkan. Hearing that Mallik\u00e1rjun (a Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra) king of the Konkan, the son of king Mah\u00e1nand who was ruling in the seagirt city of Shat\u00e1nand, had adopted the title of Grandfather of Kings, R\u00e1japit\u00e1maha, Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l sent his general \u00c1mbad against him. \u00c1mbad advanced as far as the K\u00e1veri (Kalvini) near Navs\u00e1ri, crossed the river, and in a battle fought with Mallik\u00e1rjun on the south bank of the river, was defeated and forced to retire. A second expedition was more successful. The K\u00e1veri was bridged, Mallik\u00e1rjun defeated and slain, his capital taken and plundered, and the authority of the Anhilv\u00e1da sovereign proclaimed. \u00c1mbad returned laden with gold, jewels, vessels of precious metals, pearls, elephants, and coined money. He was received graciously and ennobled with\n\n(3) Kirtir\u00e1j, who became the king of L\u00e1tdehs; (4) Vatsar\u00e1j, the opening part of whose reign and the closing part of whose father\u2019s reign were occupied in foreign wars; (6) Trilochanp\u00e1l (1050) the grantor, whose reign also was disturbed by wars. There are three copper-plates, the middle plate inscribed on both sides and the outer plates on the inner sides. They are well preserved and held by a copper-ring bearing upon it the royal seal, stamped with a figure of the god Shiv. The date is the fifteenth of the dark half of Paush (January-February) Sh\u00e1k 972 (A.D. 1050). The plate states that the king bathed at Agast\u00edtiirth, the modern Bhagv\u00e1d\u00e1ndi twenty miles north-west of Surat, and granted the village of Erath\u00e1na, modern Erth\u00e1n, six miles north-east of Olp\u00e1d in Surat, Mr. Haril\u00e1l H.

In an inscription dated 1034 Jayasimha the fourth western Ch\u00e1lukya (1018-1040) claims to have seized the seven Konkans. Bom. Arch. Sur. Rep.

He says the title means King of Kings. He seems to have heard from Musalm\u00e1n merchants that Sidhr\u00e1j had the title of King of Kings, and concluded that this title was Balh\u00e1ra which Ibn Khurd\u00e1d\u00e1b (912) had translated king of kings, apparently without reason.

For the mention of the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras as one of the thirty-six tribes subject to Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l, see Tod\u2019s Western India, 181, 188.\nKonkan.\n\nTH\u00c1NA.\n\nMallik\u00e1rjun\u2019s title of Grandfather of Kings. The Konkan is included among the eighteen districts, and the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras are mentioned among the thirty-six tribes who were subject to Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l. But Gujar\u00e1t power was shortlived, if the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra ruler of Kolhapur is right in his boast that in 1151 he replaced the dethroned kings of Th\u00e1na.\n\nDuring at least the latter part of the thirteenth century the North Konkan seems to have been ruled by viceroys of the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs, whose head-quarters were at Karn\u00e1l\u00e1 and Bassein. Two grants dated 1273 and 1291, found near Th\u00e1na, record the gift of two villages Anjor in Kaly\u00e1n and V\u00e1vla in S\u00e1lsette (called Shasthashthi in the inscription), by two Konkan viceroys of R\u00e1mchandra dev (1271-1309) the fifth Y\u00e1dav ruler of Devgiri. Two stone inscriptions dated 1280 (S. 1202) and 1288 (S. 1210), recording gifts by R\u00e1mchandra dev\u2019s officers have also recently (1882) been found near Bhiwndi and Bassein.\n\nIn the thirteenth century, while the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs held the inland parts of the district, it seems probable that the Anhilv\u00e1da kings kept a hold on certain places along the coast. At the close of the thirteenth century Gujar\u00e1t, according to Rashid-ud-din (1310), included Cambay, Somn\u00e1th, and Konkan-Th\u00e1na. But his statements\n\n---\n\n1 The title \u2018Grandfather of Kings, Rajapit\u00e1amaha,\u2019 occurs along with their other titles in three Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra copper-plates (As. Res. I. 359; Jour. R. A. S. [O. S.], V. 186; Ind. Ant. IX. 35, 38). Mr. Wathen suggests, \u2018Like a Brahmadeva among Kings, that is \u2018First among Kings,\u2019 and Mr. Telang, while translating the phrase as \u2018The grandfather of the king,\u2019 suggests the same meaning as Mr. Wathen. The Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l Charitra, which gives a detailed account of this invasion, has the following passage in explanation of the term Rajapit\u00e1amaha: \u2018One day while the Ch\u00e1lukya universal ruler (Kum\u00e1r P\u00e1l) was sitting at ease, he heard a bard pronounce Rajapit\u00e1amaha as the title of Mallik\u00e1rjun king of the Konkan\u2019 (in the verse), \u2018Thus shines King Mallik\u00e1rjun who bears the title Rajapit\u00e1amaha, having conquered all great kings by the irresistible might of his arms and made them obedient to himself like grandsons.\u2019\n\n2 J. B. B. R. A. S. XIII. 16. The local Bimbh\u00e1kh\u00fd\u00e1n, or Bimb\u2019s story, and the traditional rule of Bimb R\u00e1ja at Bombay-M\u00e1him seem to be founded on the conquest of the coast tract by the Solanki rulers of Gujar\u00e1t in 1150. The stories have been lately re-written, the names changed to suit modern Mar\u00e1tha names, and much of the value of the stories destroyed. The people generally believe that Bimb was a prince of Paithan near Ahmadnagar. But this seems to be due to a confusion between Paithan and Patan or Anhilv\u00e1da Patan, the Solanki capital of Gujar\u00e1t. In the Population Chapter reasons have been stated for holding that the Prabhus, P\u00e1chk\u00e1lshis, and Palsi Br\u00e1hmans are of Gujar\u00e1t or part-Gujar\u00e1t origin. The question is doubtful, as some of the references to Bhim, in copies of local grants, belong to the latter part of the thirteenth century (1286-1292), when the Devgiri Y\u00e1davs were the overlords of the North Konkan. The position of Bimbsth\u00e1n, apparently the old name of Bhiwndi, is also in favour of a Deccan Bimb. A good account of the old legends is given in Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. I. 132-136.\n\n3 J. R. A. S. [O. S.], II. 388; V. 178-187. The text of one of the inscriptions runs, \u2018Under the orders of Shri R\u00e1m this Shrikrishna dev governs the whole province of the Konkan.\u2019 This would show that the Y\u00e1davs had overthrown the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ras and were governing the Konkan by their own viceroys about 1270. How long before this the Y\u00e1davs had ceased to hold the Konkan as overlords and begun to govern through viceroys is not difficult to determine, as the Sil\u00e1h\u00e1ra Someshvara calls himself king of the Konkan in 1260. For the Bhiwndi (Kalv\u00e1r) and Bassein stones recently found, see Places of Interest, Appendix A.\n\n4 Ras M\u00e1la, 188, 189. They seem to have had considerable power at sea. Bhimdev II. (1179-1225) had ships that went to Sindh, and Arjun dev (1260) had a Musalm\u00e1n admiral. Tod\u2019s Western India, 207; Ras M\u00e1la, 161.\nare confused,\u00b9 and, according to Marco Polo, in his time (1290) there was a prince of Th\u00e1na, who was tributary to no one. The people were idolaters with a language of their own. The harbour was harassed by corsairs, with whom the chief of Th\u00e1na had a covenant.\u00b2 There were other petty chiefs on the coast, n\u00e1iks, r\u00e1j\u00e1s or r\u00e1\u00eds, who were probably more or less dependent on the Anhilv\u00e1da kings.\n\nSECTION II.\u2014MUSALM\u00c1NS (1300-1500).\n\nEarly in the fourteenth century the Turk rulers of Delhi forced their way into Th\u00e1na from two sides. From the north Alp Kh\u00e1n (1300-1318),\u00b3 who established the power of Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji (1297-1317) in Gujar\u00e1t, came south as far as Sanj\u00e1n, then a place of wealth and trade, and, after a sturdy and at first successful resistance, defeated the chief of Sanj\u00e1n and his warlike subjects the P\u00e1rsis.\u2074 The conquest of Sanj\u00e1n probably took place between 1312 and 1318. Up to 1309 the south of Gujar\u00e1t, of which Navs\u00e1ri was the centre, had been under the Y\u00e1dav king R\u00e1mchandra of Devgiri, and after his death it remained under his son Shankar, till he refused to pay tribute and was killed in 1312.\u2075 In 1318, when Harp\u00e1ldev, Shankar\u2019s son-in-law, refused to acknowledge Musalm\u00e1n supremacy, a Gujar\u00e1t force seems to have taken Navs\u00e1ri, as mention is soon after made (1320) of the appointment to Navs\u00e1ri of Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r, the chief of the merchants.\u2076 After the fall of Devgiri (1318) the Emperor Mub\u00e1r\u00edk I. (1317-1321), in the short season of vigour with which he opened his reign, ordered his outposts to be extended to the sea, and occupied M\u00e1him near Bombay and S\u00e1lsette.\u2077 The strong Musalm\u00e1n element in the coast towns probably made this an easy conquest; as no reference to it has been traced in the chief Musalm\u00e1n histories.\u2078\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Elliot, I. 67. In another passage of the same section he makes Konkan-Th\u00e1na separate from Gujar\u00e1t.\n\u00b2 Yule\u2019s Marco Polo, II. 330. More than two hundred years later Barbosa complains of the same piratical tribe at the port of Th\u00e1na. \u2018And there are in this port (Tanamayambu) small vessels of rovers like watch-boats, which go out to sea, and, if they meet with any small ship less strong than themselves, they capture and plunder it, and sometimes kill their crews.\u2019 Barbosa\u2019s East Africa and Malabar, 69.\n\u00b3 The conqueror of Gujar\u00e1t (1298) was Ulugh Kh\u00e1n or Great Kh\u00e1n (Elliot and Dowson, III. 439); the governor of Gujar\u00e1t (1300-1318) was Alp Kh\u00e1n (Ditto, 208).\n\u2074 A translation of the poetical P\u00e1rsi account is given in Jour. Bom. Br. Roy. As. Soc. I. 167-191. The P\u00e1rsis generally refer their defeat to a general of Mahmud Begada\u2019s (1459-1513) about 150 years later. But the completeness of Alp Kh\u00e1n\u2019s conquest of Gujar\u00e1t, the fact that Mahmud Begada had no distinguished general of the name of Alp Kh\u00e1n, and that Abu-l-fida (1300-1320) mentions Sanj\u00e1n as the last town in Gujar\u00e1t, (Elliot and Dowson, I. 403), seem to show that the conqueror of the P\u00e1rsis was Al\u00e1-ud-din\u2019s general Alp Kh\u00e1n.\n\u2075 In 1306, when the Daulatabad king agreed to pay tribute, Al\u00e1-ud-din Khilji gave him the title of R\u00e1\u00ed Rayan and added Navs\u00e1ri to his possessions, Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, I. 360.\n\u2076 Forbes\u2019 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 224.\n\u2077 Murphy in Bom. Geog. Soc. Trans. I. 123. Ferishta (Briggs, I. 389) notices that in 1318 Mub\u00e1r\u00edk ordered a chain of posts to be established from Devgiri to Dy\u00e1ra-Samudra. The power of the Musalm\u00e1ns on the Th\u00e1na coast is shown by the issue in 1325, at Daman, of gold mohars and din\u00e1rs to mark the accession of Sultan Mahmud Tughluk, Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahm\u00e1di, 169.\n\u2078 Malik K\u00e1fur, in his expedition to the Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r coast in 1310, found Musalm\u00e1ns who had been subjects of Hindus. They were half Hindus and not strict in their religion, but, as they could repeat the kal\u00edma, they were spared. Amir Khusru in Elliot and Dowson, III, 90.\nTH\u0100NA.\n\nThat the Turk rulers of Delhi did conquer the coast and establish a garrison at Th\u0101na, is shown by the accounts of the French friars Jordanus and Odericus, who were in Th\u0101na between 1321 and 1324. The friars state that the Saracens, or Muhammadans, held the whole country, having lately usurped the dominion. They had destroyed an infinite number of idol temples and likewise many churches, of which they made mosques for Muhammad, taking their endowments and property. Under the Emperor of Delhi, Th\u0101na was governed by a military officer or malik, and by a religious officer or k\u0101z\u012b. Stirred by the k\u0101z\u012b the military governor murdered four Christian friars, and for this cruelty was recalled by the Emperor and put to death. The two travellers have recorded many interesting details of Th\u0101na. The heat was horrible, so great that to stand bareheaded in the sun for a single mass (half an hour), was certain death. Gold, iron, and electrum were found in the country, other metals were imported. The country was full of trees, the jack, the mango, the cocos palm, the fan or brab palm and the forest palm, the banian tree with its twenty or thirty trunks, a stupendous carob tree perhaps the baobab Adansonia digitata, and a tree, apparently the teak, so hard that the sharpest arrow could not pierce it. There was plenty of victual, rice, much wheat, sesamum, butter, green ginger in abundance, and quantities of sugarcane. There were numerous black lions, leopards, lynxes, rhinoceroses, and crocodiles, monkeys and baboons, bats (the fruit-eating bat or flying-fox) as big as kites, and rats (the bandicoot) as big as dogs. There were no horses, camels, or elephants, and only a few small worthless asses. All the carrying, riding, and ploughing was done by oxen, fine animals with horns a good half pace in length, and a hump on the back like a camel. The oxen were honoured as fathers and worshipped by some, perhaps by most. The people were pagans, Hindus and Parsis, who worshipped fire, serpents, and trees, especially the basil plant. There were also Saracens or Musalmans, most jealous of their faith; scattered Nestorian Christians, kindly but ignorant and schismatic; and Dumbries, a class of drudges and load-carriers who had no object of worship and ate carrion and carcasses. The men and women were black, clothed in nothing but a strip of cotton tied round the loins and the end flung over the naked back. Their food was rice gruel, butter and oil, and their drink milk and very intoxicating palm wine. The fighting was child's play. When they went to the wars they went naked with a round target, a frail and paltry affair, and holding\n\n---\n\n1 Jordanus seems to have been in Th\u0101na and Sop\u0101ra between 1321 and 1324, and Oderic about 1322. The dates are discussed in Yule's Cathay, I. 68. The details in the text are taken from Yule's Jordanus and the Travels of Oderic, and the letters of Jordanus in Yule's Cathay, I. 57-70 and 225-230. Some account of the great Christian movement of which these Th\u0101na missions formed a part is given in Appendix B.\n\n2 Jordanus' Mirabilia, 23.\n\n3 Malik was a favourite title among the Khiljis who had adopted Afghan ways. Many local governors bore the title of Malik (Briggs' Ferishta, I. 292-391). The Emperor of Delhi appears as Dal Dili. Oderic's meaning is explained by Yule (Cathay, I. 58), in whose opinion both Jordanus and Oderic are careful and correct writers.\n\n4 Yule (Mirabilia, 21) makes Jordanus' Dumbries be Doms. One division or clan of the N\u0101sik Mh\u0101rs is called Dombs; and Steele (Deccan Castes, 117) mentions Domb\u0101ris as tumblers and rope-dancers chiefly found in the Karn\u0101tak.\na kind of spit in their hands. They were clean in their feeding, true in speech, and eminent in justice, maintaining carefully the privileges of every class as they had come down from old times. The pagans were ready to hear a preacher and open to conversion; the Saracens were full of hate for Christian teachers, killing four and imprisoning and ill-treating a fifth. Among the pagans, when a woman was married, she was set on a horse and the husband got on the crupper and held a knife pointed at her throat. They had nothing on, except a high cap on their head like a mitre, wrought with white flowers, and all the maidens of the place went singing in a row in front of them till they reached the house, and there the bride and bridegroom were left alone, and when they got up in the morning they went naked as before. The noble and rich dead were burnt, and their wives burnt with them with as much joy as if they were going to be wedded. Most of the dead were carried with great pomp to the fields and cast forth to the beasts and birds, the great heat of the sun consuming them in a few days. There was trade with Broach, the Malab\u00e1r coast, the Persian gulf, and Ethiopia. The coast was infested with pirates.\n\nUnder the strong rule of Muhammad Tughl\u00eek (1325-1350) the Musalm\u00e1ns probably maintained their supremacy in the north Konkan, but their interest in this part of their dominions was small. The route taken by the traveller Ibn Batuta (1343) shows that, at this time, the trade between Daulatabad and the coast did not pass to the Th\u00e1na ports, but went round by Nandurb\u00e1r and Songad to Cambay. At this time two important Hindu chiefs held territory on the direct route between Daulatabad and the coast, M\u00e1ndev chief of B\u00e1gl\u00e1n, and the chief of Jawh\u00e1r, who, in 1341, was recognised by the Delhi court as the lord of twenty-two forts and of a country yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a390,000 (Rs. 9,00,000). Some parts of the Th\u00e1na coast may in name have remained subordinate to Gujar\u00e1t. But the connection with the Deccan seems to have been very small. In 1350, when the new or Moghal nobles were summoned into Daulatabad, none came from the Konkan. Shortly after, when the Bahmanis\n\n---\n\n1 In the Population Chapter (p. 251) this exposition of the dead has been taken as a proof of Persian or P\u00e1rsi influence. It is however worthy of note that in J\u00e1va a sect of Hindus are said (1818) to expose their dead to the air as an offering to the sun. As. Res.

According to one of the local Konkan stories, about 1350, a Naw\u00e1b of Vadnagar, that is Gujar\u00e1t, defeated the Hindu chief of M\u00e1l\u00edm.\n3 Lee's Ibn Batuta, 162-164; Yule's Cathay, II. 415. Ibn Batuta (1343) mentions one Amir Husain flying to an infidel prince named Burabrah, perhaps Bohrijr\u00e1\u00ed, who dwelt in the lofty mountains between Daulatabad and Konkan-Th\u00e1na. Elliot and Dowson, III. 619.\n4 Briggs' Ferishta, I. 437; compare II. 321-323.\n5 Bom. Gov. Sel., (New Series), XXVI. 14; Aitchison's Treaties, IV. 321. The Mackenzie Manuscripts ('Wilson's Mackenzie Manuscripts, I. cvi) mention a ferryman (Koll?) chieftain named Jayaba (apparently a southern or un-Sanskrit chief), who defeated and deposed the nephew of Gauri R\u00e1ja and became master of the Konkan from Junnar to Ankola in Kanara: Jayaba extended his power above the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, but was checked by the Musalm\u00e1ns. Seven princes descended from Jayaba ruled the Konkan. This family of chiefs has not been identified. Their head-quarters were probably either in central or south Konkan, not in Th\u00e1na.\n6 Briggs' Ferishta, I. 437.\nestablished themselves as independent rulers and moved the capital of the Deccan from Daulatabad south to Kulbarga, their connection with the north Konkan grew still fainter. Though they held Navsari to the north and Chaul to the south, they seem to have had little concern with the lands now under Thana. In 1380, when orphan schools were founded in their leading towns, no mention is made of any of the Thana ports. Musalm\u00e1n supremacy can have been little more than a name. It appears from a stone dated A.D. 1464, that the Hindu chief of Bhiwandi had power to make land-grants.\n\nIn the fifteenth century the interest of the Musalmans in the North Konkan revived. The establishment of a separate dynasty of Gujar\u00e1t kings, at the close of the fourteenth century, added much to the vigour and strength of the Musalmans on the northern frontier. Mosaffar (1390-1412), the founder of the Gujar\u00e1t dynasty, and his grandson and successor Ahmad I. (1413-1441), brought most of the Gujar\u00e1t chiefs to subjection and ranked high among the rulers of Rajputana and of Western India. In 1429, apparently as a regular outpost and not as a new possession, they had a garrison under a captain, Kutb Khan, at Mahim near Bombay, and another garrison overruling Thana. Apparently at both places, certainly at Mahim, there was a friendly, probably a tributary, Hindu chief or rai. The whole coast from Navsari to Bombay, though apparently under Hindu chiefs who were independent enough to make grants of land, was sufficiently under Musalm\u00e1n control to enable their army to pass unopposed from Gujar\u00e1t to Mahim. About the same time Sultan Ahmad Bahmani (1422-1435), king of the Deccan, made vigorous efforts to bring the Konkan under his control. In 1429 the Bahmani minister Malik-ul-Tujjar led a strong force into the Konkan, and secured a rich booty, including several elephants and camel-loads of gold and silver. Malik-ul-Tujjar seems to have spread his master's power to the shore of the mainland, and, in 1429, on the death of the Gujar\u00e1t commandant Kutb Khan, he seized on Mahim and Salsette. Hearing of this insult, the strong and warlike Ahmad Shah of Gujar\u00e1t gathered a fleet of seventeen sail from Diu, Gogha, and Cambay, and\n\n---\n\n1 In 1357 Hasan the founder of the Bahmani dynasty is (Briggs' Ferishta, II. 295) mentioned as visiting Navsari. About the same time, when the Bahmanis distributed their territory into four provinces, the north-west province is described (Briggs' Ferishta, II. 295) as the tract comprehending Chaul on the sea-coast and going between Junnar, Daulatabad, Bir, and Paithan.\n\n2 The towns named are Kulbarga, Bidar, Kandh\u00e1r, Elichpur, Daulatabad, Chaul, and Dabul. Briggs' Ferishta, II. 350.\n\n3 To illustrate the relations between the local Hindu chiefs and their Musalm\u00e1n overlords may be compared the mention of the rai of Mahim in 1429 (see text, p. 441); Varthema's statement in 1500 that the king of Chaul, then part of Mahmud Begada's dominions, was a pagan (Badger's Edition, II. 114); the position of the apparently Hindu chief of Thana, in 1528, when his territory in Bombay was invaded by the Portuguese (see below, p. 450) and the grant of Tegnapatam to the English in 1691, under the seal of a local Hindu chief and by a kaul from the Subba of the Karnatak (Bruce's Annals, III. 120).\n\n4 A Devnagari land-grant stone has been found at Sanj\u00e1n dated A.D. 1432 (S. 1354), and another at Kopr\u00e1d, about ten miles north of Bassein, dated A.D. 1464 (S. 1386). The Kopr\u00e1d stone has the special interest of giving a Musalm\u00e1n date (H. 864) and several Musalm\u00e1n names. Details are given under Places of Interest, Kopr\u00e1d and Sanj\u00e1n.\nsent it to M\u0101him along with a land army under his youngest son Zafar Kh\u00e1n and his general Malik Iftik\u00e1r Kh\u00e1n. The joint force attacked Th\u00e1na by land and sea, and compelled the Deccan general to retire to M\u0101him. Here he was joined by a force under Al\u00e1-ud-din, the son of the Deccan monarch, and strengthened his position by throwing up a wattled stockade along the shore of the creek. After waiting some days the Gujar\u00e1t troops took heart, assaulted the stockade, and, after a severe struggle, drove the Deccanis to Bombay, where they were again routed and withdrew to the mainland. Reinforced from the Deccan, they came back and attacked Th\u00e1na, but were once more defeated and compelled to retire. Among the plunder the Gujar\u00e1t troops secured some beautiful gold and silver embroidery. A year or two later (1432) Ahmad of Gujar\u00e1t arranged a marriage between his son and the daughter of the chief of M\u0101hum. An attempt of the Deccan king to take the place of Gujar\u00e1t as overlord of B\u00e1gl\u00e1n proved as complete a failure as his attack on Th\u00e1na and Bombay.\n\nAfter this, several expeditions, Dil\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n\u2019s in 1436, Malik-ul-Tuj\u00e1r\u2019s in 1453, and Mahmud Gaw\u00e1n\u2019s in 1469, were sent from the Deccan to conquer the Konkan. They seem to have been almost entirely confined to central and southern Konkan, the present districts of Kol\u00e1ba and Ratn\u00e1giri. Much of the country was overrun and many chiefs were forced to pay tribute, but almost the only permanent posts were at Chaul and D\u00e1bhol. The inland parts continued to be held by Hindu rulers, of whom the r\u0101\u00eds of M\u0101huli in Th\u00e1na, R\u00e1\u00edri or R\u00e1ygad in Kol\u00e1ba, and Vish\u00e1lga in Ratn\u00e1giri were perhaps the chief. About 1465 Mahmud Begada increased Gujar\u00e1t power in north Th\u00e1na, marching between the Konkan and Gujar\u00e1t, taking the extraordinary hill-fort of Bavur, perhaps Bav\u00e1ra for Bagv\u00e1da, and from that advancing to Dura (?) and Parn\u00e1la, apparently P\u00e1rnena, defeating the infidels, and forcing the chief to give up his forts. The chief threw himself on Mahmud\u2019s mercy, and on paying tribute his land was restored.\n\nAbout 1480 the Bahamis divided their territory into eight provinces. By establishing Junnar as the head of one of the provinces the Deccan was brought into closer relations with the north Konkan. A few years later (1485), in the decay of Bahmani rule, one Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n Gal\u00e1ni, the son of the governor of Goa, seized D\u00e1bhol and other places in the south Konkan, and proclaimed himself king of Dari\u00e1b\u00e1r, or the sea coast. In 1484 he harassed the Gujar\u00e1t harbours and, in 1490, sent his slave, Y\u00e1kut an Abyssinian, with twenty ships to lay M\u0101him or Bombay waste. Y\u00e1kut seized many\n\n---\n\n1 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II, 412-414; IV, 28-30; Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 36; R\u00e1s M\u0101la, 269.\n2 This was probably the fine embroidered muslin for which Burh\u00e1npur was famous.\n3 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 36.\n4 Watson\u2019s Gujar\u00e1t, 36.\n5 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II, 424, 436, and 483.\n6 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II, 483.\n7 Naime\u2019s Konkan, 26.\n8 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, IV, 51.

Mahmud Begada then wrote to Mahmud Bahmani, explaining that Gujar\u00e1t troops could not reach Bah\u00e1dur Kh\u00e1n without passing through Deccan lands, and urging him to punish Bah\u00e1dur. The leading Bahmani nobles, Adil Kh\u00e1n and Ahmad Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h, who were both planning to establish themselves as independent rulers, were jealous of Bah\u00e1dur\u2019s attempt to bring the coast into his hands. They gladly joined Mahmud Bahmani, and, in 1493, Bah\u00e1dur was attacked near Kolhapur, defeated, and slain. Mahim and the Gujar\u00e1t ships were restored to Mahmud Begada.\n\nDuring this time (1485-1493) Ahmad Niz\u00e1m, the son of the Bahmani prime minister, was placed by his father in charge of the province of Daulatabad. He made Junnar his head-quarters and took many Poona and Th\u00e1na forts, among them Manranjan or R\u00e1jmachi and M\u00e1luli. In 1490 he increased his power in the Konkan by taking Danda-R\u00e1jpuri, and, about the same time, on hearing of his father\u2019s assassination at the Bidar court, he declared himself independent of the Bahmani kings. Meanwhile Mahmud Begada was strengthening his hold on the Konkan, and, about 1495, divided his dominions into five parts, of one of which Th\u00e1na was the head. Some years later (1508) Mahmud Begada still further increased his power. He effected his designs against Bassein and Bombay, established a garrison at N\u00e1gothna, and sent an army to Chaul. At this time, when Gujar\u00e1t power was at its highest, according to the Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, Daman, Bassein and Bombay were included within Gujar\u00e1t limits. And among the ports which yielded revenue to the Gujar\u00e1t kings were Agashi, Danda near Kelva-Mahim, Sorab perhaps Sop\u00e1ra, Bassein, Bhiwdi, Kaly\u00e1n, Bombay, and Panvel. The claim of the Gujar\u00e1t historian to so large a share of the north Konkan coast is supported by the Italian traveller Varthema, who, in 1502, placed Chaul in Gujar\u00e1t. So, also, the early Portuguese accounts, though they make the Bet or Kaly\u00e1n river the border line between Gujar\u00e1t and the Deccan, notice that in 1530 there was a Gujar\u00e1t governor of N\u00e1gothna, and that in 1540 there were Gujar\u00e1t commandants of the hill-forts of Karn\u00e1la in Panvel and of S\u00e1nkshi in Pen.\n\nOf the trade of the Th\u00e1na ports during the two hundred years between the Muhammadan conquest and the arrival of the Portuguese information is scanty. For the first forty years of this period Th\u00e1na was the port of the Musalm\u00e1n rulers of Daulatabad.\n\n---\n\n1 R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 290.\n2 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, II. 543.\n3 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 190-191.\n4 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 198-199.\n5 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, III. 191-192.\n6 Briggs\u2019 Ferishta, IV. 62.\n7 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 214.\n8 Bird\u2019s Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 110, 111. Bird gives Danda-R\u00e1jpuri in Janjira, but perhaps Danda, near Kelva-Mahim was meant.\n9 All of these ports were not necessarily under Gujar\u00e1t, as in the same list are included D\u00e1bhol, Goa, Kalikat, Kulam or Quilon, and the M\u00e1ldives. Ditto 129, 130.\n10 Badger\u2019s Varthema, 114.\n11 Faria y Souza (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VI. 83) says \u2018The river Bate, falling into the sea near Bombaim, divides the kingdoms of Gujar\u00e1t and Deccan.\u2019\nThen, when the Bahmanis (1347) moved their capital to Kulbarga, trade passed south to Chaul and to D\u00e1bhol in Ratn\u00e1giri. Towards the end of the fifteenth century, though some traffic continued from M\u00e1him and Th\u00e1na through the Tal pass to Burh\u00e1npur, the trade of the north Konkan ports was further reduced by their conquest by the Ahmadabad kings. The establishment of Ahmadnagar as a separate kingdom, a few years before the close of the fifteenth century (1496), again raised Chaul to the rank of a first class port. During this period Persia was prosperous, and a great trade centered in the ports of the Persian Gulf. The constant demand for horses kept up a close connection between the Th\u00e1na and east Arabian ports, and there was a considerable trade with the Zanzibar coast. The great wealth and power of Venice, and the capture of Constantinople by the Turks (1453), turned the commerce between Europe and Asia to the Red Sea route, but in India the bulk of the Red Sea trade settled in the Malab\u00e1r ports. There is little trace of direct trade between Th\u00e1na ports and Ceylon, the Eastern Archipelago, or China. This trade seems also to have centered in Malab\u00e1r. The chief Th\u00e1na ports during these two hundred years were Th\u00e1na, a considerable town and a celebrated place of trade, Chaul a centre of trade, Sop\u00e1ra a place of consequence, and M\u00e1him a port and centre of trade. The chief ports which had dealings with the Th\u00e1na coast were Quilon and Kalikat in Malab\u00e1r, Cambay in Gujar\u00e1t, Ormuz in the Persian Gulf, Dhafar in east Arabia, Aden Jidda and \u00c6thiopia in the Red Sea, and the African ports. Compared with the previous period, the chief changes in the articles of trade were the apparent increase in the export of rice, wheat, and betelnut and leaves to the Persian and Arab coasts; in the export of fine Deccan-made muslins; in the import of the rich silks of Venice, the brocades and cloth of gold of Persia, and the satins of China; and in the import of woollen cloth, camlets, mirrors, arms, gold and silver ornaments, and other articles from Venice. Of articles of Food, rice, green ginger, sugarcane, butter, and sesamum oil were produced in Th\u00e1na and sent probably to the Arab and African ports. Wheat was exported probably to Ormuz.\n\n1 Vasco da Gama, 1497, found the people of Corrientes in East Africa clothed in cotton, silk, and satin. At Mozambique Moorish merchants from the Red Sea and India exchanged Indian goods for Sof\u00e1la gold. In the warehouses were pepper, ginger, cotton, silver, pearls, rubies, velvets, and other Indian articles. Momhaza had all Indian commodities, and Melinda had Indian wares and Indian merchants. Stevenson's Sketch of Discovery, 340-341.\n\n2 In the fifteenth century the revenues of Venice and the wealth of its merchants exceeded anything known in other parts of Europe. In 1420 its shipping included 3000 trading vessels with 17,000 sailors, 300 large ships with 8000 sailors, and 45 galleasses or caracks with 11,000 sailors.

Of Spices, pepper ginger and cardamoms came from the Malab\u00e1r coast, cinnamon from Ceylon, cubeb nutmegs mace and cardamoms from Java, and cloves from Sumatra. These spices were sent to the Deccan, and probably to Africa, Arabia, and Persia. Of articles of Dress, cotton cloth made in Th\u00e1na, and gold and silver embroidered muslins and fine gaunze from Burh\u00e1npur and other Deccan cities were sent to Persia, Arabia, Africa, and China, where one cotton coat was worth three silk coats; velvet was made in Th\u00e1na, and silks were brought from the Deccan, China, Persia, and Europe, interchanged, and exported to Africa and Arabia; woollen cloth came from Europe by the Red Sea. Of Precious Stones, diamonds 'the best under heaven' were sent from India, and pearls and rubies from Abyssinia, Persia, and Ceylon. \u00c6thiopia was rich in precious stones, and coral came from the Red Sea. There was a large demand for pearls and other precious stones in Africa. Of Metals, silver came from China and probably through the Red Sea from Germany and went to Sof\u00e1l\u00e1; tin was brought from Sumatra and probably through the Red Sea from England; gold, iron, and electrum were not imported.

The system must have been much the same in Th\u00e1na during the time of the Khal\u00edfs of Baghd\u00e1d (700-1000); in Kaly\u00e1n during the times of the Sassanians (300-600); in Chaul during the times of the Egyptian Greeks (B.C. 100-A.D. 200); and perhaps at Sop\u00e1ra at the time of Solomon (B.C. 1000). The great centre of foreign trade was not necessarily a large city. There were perhaps few inhabitants except during December January February and March when vessels from all parts of Asia thronged the port, and, when, from the Deccan and from Upper India, came great caravans of oxen with packs like donkeys, and, on the tops of the packs, long white sacks laid crosswise, one man driving thirty or forty beasts before him. The caravans stopped about a league from the city, and there traders from all the cities and towns in the country set up shops of goods and of cloth. During those four months the place was a fair, and then the merchants went back to their homes till the next season.\u2075\n\nAmong the merchants who carried on trade in the Th\u00e1na ports were Hindus, Musalm\u00e1ns, Egyptians, and a small but increasing number of Europeans.\u2076 Hindus continued to travel and trade to foreign ports, being met in Ormuz, Aden, Zanzibar, and Malacca.\u2077 There would seem to have been little change in the style of ships that frequented the Th\u00e1na coast. Of the local or Indian ships some were very great, but they were put together with a needle and thread without iron and with no decks. They took in so much\n\n\u00b9 Jordanus' Mirabilia (1320), 48; Ibn Batuta (1340) in Yule's Cathay, II. 478.\n\u00b2 Robertson's India, 137. It seems probable that, during the fifteenth century, fire-arms were introduced from Venice into India through Egypt. Like bindikia or bullet in Egypt (Cresay's Ottoman Turks, I. 233 note 1), the Indian word banduk or gun seems to be a corruption of Binikia, that is Vinikia or Venetian. The Portuguese (1498) found the Indian Moors or Musalm\u00e1ns as well armed as, sometimes better armed than, themselves.

The Arab ships in the Red Sea had timbers sewn with cords, and sails of rush mats; those at Aden were plank-sewn and had cotton sails. The Persian Gulf boats were very frail and uncouth, stitched with twine and with no iron. The Chinese ships, though it is doubtful if any came further than the Malab\u00e1r coast, were much the same as those described by Marco Polo. The European travellers speak slightingly of the skill of the eastern sailors. 'Weather such as our mariners would deem splendid is to them awfully perilous. One European at sea is worth a hundred of them.' The Indian seas continued cursed with pirates. The Indian ships were armed against them with archers and Abyssinian soldiers. In the fifteenth century Abd-er-Razzak, 1440, notices pirates in the Persian Gulf and at Kalikut, and, about thirty years later, Nikitin complains that the sea was infested with pirates neither Christians nor Musalm\u00e1ns, who prayed to stone idols and knew not Christ. During this century the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Ahmadabad made several expeditions against the pirates of Dw\u00e1rka in K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, of Bals\u00e1r in south Surat, and foreign corsairs from the Malab\u00e1r coast.\n\nSECTION III.\u2014PORTUGUESE (1500-1670).\n\nIn 1498, when the whole coast line from Goa to Bassein had lately passed to Bij\u00e1pur and Gujar\u00e1t, the Portuguese rounded the Cape of Good Hope and appeared on the Kalikut coast. Their object was to treat all Indian ships as friends and all Indian rulers as allies. Their only rivals were the Moors of Mecca, and the Arab and Egyptian merchants who had then the monopoly of the trade between Europe and Asia. The first Gujar\u00e1t ships that were taken by the Portuguese were restored unharmed and with a friendly message.

Ferishta says, 'The Portuguese, observing their treaty, have made no further encroachment on the Adil Sh\u00e1hi territory.'} With the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h or Ahmadnagar dynasty the Portuguese continued faithful allies, never attacking them except on three occasions and on each occasion in self-defence.\\footnote{In 1530 when the Gujar\u00e1t kings forced Ahmadnagar to break with the Portuguese (Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 237, and Faria in Kerr, VI. 231); in 1572 when the Bij\u00e1pur Ahmadnagar and Kalikat kings joined against the Portuguese (Briggs' Ferishta, III. 234); and in 1594 when the Ahmadnagar kings attempted to fortify Korle hill at the mouth of the Chaul river. (Da Cunha's Chaul, 60).} Mahmud Begada, the Gujar\u00e1t king, was too staunch a Musalm\u00e1n to be on friendly terms with a Christian power, and he was too successful a sea captain to admit the Portuguese claim to rule the sea. He entered into an alliance with the Mameluke Sultan of Egypt\\footnote{Faria in Kerr, VI. 111. Kausu-al-Gauri, known as Campson Gauri (1500-1516), who was killed near Aleppo by Selim, emperor of the Turks.} and the Zamorin of Kalikat to unite in driving the Portuguese from the Indian seas. Timber was sent from Bassein to Mecca to help the Egyptians to build a fleet,\\footnote{Part of the Egyptian fleet was made at Suez from timber brought from Dalmatia, Faria in Kerr, VI. 111; Mickle's Lusiad, I. cxx.} and, in 1507, an Egyptian fleet of twelve sail and 1500 men under Amir Husain arrived in the Cambay gulf. On their arrival Mahmud sent his fleet along with the Egyptian vessels down the coast, and himself led an army by land to help the fleets, should the Portuguese be found in any of the Gujar\u00e1t ports.\\footnote{Forbes' R\u00e1s M\u00e1la, 291; Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 215.} The result was the defeat of the Portuguese at Chaul, a loss that was soon after (2nd February 1509) redeemed by the destruction off Diu of the joint Gujar\u00e1t, Kalikat, and Egyptian fleets.\\footnote{Faria in Kerr, VI. 119. Among the spoil were many Latin, Italian, and Portuguese books, probably the property of Christian galley slaves.} In 1507 the Portuguese seem to have tried to raise the Hindu chiefs on the Th\u00e1na coast against Mahmud Begada, as Mahmud is described as settling disturbances at Bassein and effecting his designs against Bassein and Bombay.\\footnote{Briggs' Ferishta, IV. 74, 75.

In 1510 some Portuguese were shipwrecked at Nabanda and taken to Champ\u00e1ner. The Gujar\u00e1t and Bassein minister wrote a friendly letter to Albuquerque (Commentaries, II. 212). In 1512 a Gujar\u00e1t ambassador visited Goa. Albuquerque made three demands, that they were to employ no Turks, that their ships were to trade only with Goa, and that the Portuguese were to be allowed to build a fort at Diu. Commentaries, III. 245.} A few years later (1514) the southern boundary of Gujar\u00e1t had shrunk from Chaul to Bombay.\\footnote{About 1514 Barbosa (Stanley's Barbossa, 68, 69) describes Chaul as eight leagues south from the borders of Gujar\u00e1t or Cambay.}\n\nAt this time the Th\u00e1na ports seem to have been places of little trade. The commerce between the Deccan and the sea either centred in Chaul and D\u00e1bhol, or passed by land to Surat and R\u00e1nder,\nwhich were great places of trade in all classes of merchandise.\\footnote{Stanley's Barbosa, 66, 67. Surat was a city of very great trade in all classes of merchandise, a very important seaport whose customs-house yielded a large revenue to the king of Gujar\u00e1t. Ravel or R\u00e1nder was a rich and agreeable place, trading with Bengal, Pegu, Sumatra, and Malacca, with large fine ships and the best supply of Chinese goods. Chaul was a place of great commerce and D\u00e1bhol a place of very great trade. Ditto 69, 72.}\n\nBassein was a good seaport where much merchandise changed hands, but all apparently came from the Malab\u00e1r coast. Bombay, M\u00e1l\u00edm, and Th\u00e1na were mixed into one, Tanamayambu, a sea-port at the end of Cambay or Gujar\u00e1t. It had a fortress and a pleasant Moorish town with many rich gardens, great Moorish mosques, and Gentile temples. It had little trade and was pestered with pirates, who went out to sea, and if they met with any ships less strong than themselves, captured and plundered them sometimes killing the crews.\\footnote{Stanley's Barbosa, 68-69. According to Faria, Chaul belonged to Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h in 1508. Kerr, VI, 111.}\n\nIn 1516, Dom Jo\u00e3o de Monoy entered the B\u00e1ndra creek and defeated the commandant of M\u00e1l\u00edm fort, and, in the same year, a Portuguese factory was established at Chaul. In 1521 an order came from Portugal to build forts at Chaul and at Diu. A fleet started for Diu, but their request to be allowed to build a fort was refused, and the place was so strongly fortified that the fleet sailed to Ormuz without attacking it.\\footnote{Faria in Kerr, VI, 180.} The Portuguese were more successful at Chaul, where, on the promise that he would be allowed to import horses, Burh\u00e1n I., king of Ahmadnagar, gave them leave to build a fort.\\footnote{Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 36-37.} Malik Eliaz sent the Gujar\u00e1t fleet from Diu to blockade the Chaul river, and stop the building of the fort. In this he was helped by the Musalm\u00e1n governor of Chaul. But though the Portuguese fleet suffered severely, the building was pushed on, and, in 1522, Malik Eliaz was forced to withdraw.\\footnote{Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 39.} The fort was finished in 1524, and, after that, the Portuguese fleet was able to sail freely in the Bombay harbour.\\footnote{Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 171.} In 1526 a Portuguese factory was established at Bassein.\\footnote{Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 171.} In February 1528 the Gujar\u00e1t fleet of eighty barks, under a brave Moor named Alish\u00e1h (Alexiath), appeared at the mouth of the Chaul river and did much damage to the Ahmadnagar territory and to Portuguese trade. Against the Gujar\u00e1t fleet, Sampayo the Portuguese viceroy, sailed with forty vessels, carrying 1000 Portuguese soldiers and a large force of armed natives. The viceroy took command of the sailing ships and placed Heitor de Sylveira in charge of the row-boats. On reaching Chaul, one Jo\u00e3o de Avelar, with eighty Portuguese, was sent to help the Ahmadnagar king. A thousand natives were given him, and with their help he scaled a fort belonging to the king of Cambay, which till then had been thought impregnable. He slew the garrison and delivered the fort to the Niz\u00e1m.\n\nOn leaving Chaul for Diu, 'on the day after Shrove Tuesday,' Sampayo came unexpectedly on the Cambay fleet in Bombay harbour. After a furious cannonade the Portuguese boarded the enemy and\nAlish\u00e1h fled, hoping to escape by the M\u00e1him creek. But the Portuguese had stationed boats at Bandra, and all Alish\u00e1h\u2019s vessels but seven were taken. Of the seventy-three prizes thirty-three were fit for work and were kept; the rest were burned. Besides the vessels many prisoners were made, and much artillery and abundance of ammunition were taken.\\(^1\\) After the victory Sampayo went back to Goa, leaving Heitor de Sylveira with twenty-two row-boats to harass the Gujar\u00e1t coasts. Sylveira remained some time on the pleasantly-wooded island of Bombay or M\u00e1him. It had much game and plenty of meat and rice, and proved so agreeable a resting-place that his men gave it the name of Boa Vida or the Island of Good Life.\\(^2\\) After resting his men in Bombay, Sylveira went up the river N\u00e1gothna, landed, and burnt six Gujar\u00e1t towns. On his way back to his boats he was attacked by the commandant of N\u00e1gothna, but beat him off with loss. Sylveira next went to Bassein, which he found well fortified and defended with cannon. He entered the river at night and stormed the fortifications. Next day he was met by Alish\u00e1h at the head of 3500 men. But he drove them off with great slaughter, and plundered and burnt the city of Bassein.\\(^3\\) Terrified with these exploits, the lord of the great city of Th\u00e1na agreed to become tributary to the Portuguese, and Sylveira returned to Chaul.\\(^4\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Faria in Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VI. 209, 210. This summary of Faria\u2019s account of the battle of Bombay seems to differ in some particulars from the account in De Barros\u2019 Asia (Decada, IV. part I. 208-210, Lisbon Ed. of 1777). According to De Barros the Portuguese caught sight of the Gujar\u00e1t fleet off a promontory. As Sylveira drew near, the Gujar\u00e1t fleet retired behind the promontory, and he sent some ships to guard the mouth of the Bandra river. When Sylveira drew near, the Gujar\u00e1t ships set sail and ran into the river, and when they found that the mouth of the river was occupied, they tried to reach M\u00e1him fort, but, before they reached M\u00e1him, they were surrounded and captured by the Portuguese boats which had been sent to guard the mouth of the creek. This account is not altogether clear. Apparently what happened was, that when the Gujar\u00e1t boats saw the Portuguese, they drew back from the Frongs Point into the Bombay harbour, and when the Portuguese fleet attacked them, they fled up the harbour \u2018to the mouth of the river (that is the Bombay harbour or east mouth of the M\u00e1him creek) not daring to try their fortune in the open sea.\u2019 The Portuguese captain learned from his local pilots that the Gujar\u00e1t fleet probably meant to retreat through the Bandra creek, and accordingly sent boats to guard its mouth. The Gujar\u00e1t fleet entered the creek by Sion, and, on nearing M\u00e1him, saw the Portuguese boats blocking the entrance of the creek. To avoid them they made for the Musalm\u00e1n fort of M\u00e1him, at the south end of the present Bandra causeway, but the Portuguese saw their object and coming up the creek cut them off. De Barros\u2019 account has been supposed (\u2018Lateen\u2019 in Times of India, 21st April 1882) to favour the view that the fight was not in the harbour, but in the open sea off Malabar point. To this view the objections are, that when the Gujar\u00e1t fleet retired behind Colaba point on catching sight of the Portuguese, they must have gone into Back Bay a dangerous and unlikely movement. That if they came out again to fight, they must have seen the Portuguese boats being sent on to Bandra, and that when, in their flight, the Gujar\u00e1t fleet found the mouth of the Bandra creek blocked, they could not have attempted to take shelter in M\u00e1him. The attempt to take shelter in M\u00e1him, when the mouth of the creek was found to be blocked, shows that the Gujar\u00e1t fleet was leaving not entering the Bandra or M\u00e1him river.\n\n\\(^2\\) Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Primeiro Roteiro, 70.\n\n\\(^3\\) This capture of Bassein was deemed a great exploit, as the entrance to the river was very difficult. Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Primeiro Roteiro, 110.\n\n\\(^4\\) Faria in Kerr, VI. 209, 211. Da Cunha\u2019s Chaul and Bassein, 170. This previous agreement, not the unimportance of Bombay, seems to be the reason why Bombay is not mentioned in the Bassein treaty of 1533. Apparently this lord of Th\u00e1na was a Hindu chief, not a Musalm\u00e1n governor. In the outlying parts of their territory the Gujar\u00e1t kings seem to have made free use of Hindu governors, probably tributary chiefs. In 1503 the governor of Chaul was a Hindu (Badger\u2019s Varthema, 114), and in 1514 the governor of Surat was a Hindu. (Stanley\u2019s Barbosa, 68).\n1530 Antonio de Sylveira, on his way back from plundering Surat and R\u00e1nder, destroyed the towns of Daman and Ag\u00e1shi, at the latter place burning 300 of the enemies' ships. In the same year the Portuguese made a successful raid into the Ahmadnagar-Konkan, as Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m had been forced by his superior Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h of Gujar\u00e1t to join with him in a campaign against the Portuguese.\n\nIn 1531 a great Portuguese fleet, collected by Nuno da Cunha for the capture of Diu, was reviewed in Bombay harbour and a parade was held on the Bombay esplanade. From Bombay the fleet of 400 sail with 3600 Portuguese soldiers and 1450 Portuguese seamen, 2000 K\u00e1nara and Malab\u00e1r soldiers, 8000 slaves, and about 5000 native seamen, sailed to Daman. They found it deserted, and, passing north, took the pirate stronghold of Little Bet in the south of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, and advanced to Diu, but failed to make any impression on its fortifications. Nuno returned to Goa, leaving Antonio de Saldanha with sixty sail to plunder the Cambay ports. On his way south Antonio destroyed Bals\u00e1r, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, Kelva-M\u00e1him, and Ag\u00e1shi. In 1532 Nuno da Cunha ordered Diogo de Sylveira to plunder the Gujar\u00e1t coasts, and himself advanced, with 150 vessels manned by 3000 Portuguese soldiers and 200 K\u00e1narese, against Bassein, whose fortifications were being strengthened. Though Bassein was garrisoned by 12,000 men, the Portuguese dashed against the fort, took it by assault, and razed its walls. Th\u00e1na and B\u00e1ndra were forced to pay tribute, the coast towns between Bassein and T\u00e1r\u00e1pur were burnt, and an attempt was made to take the fort of Daman. Nuno da Cunha again urged the king of Gujar\u00e1t to let the Portuguese build a fort at Diu. But again the negotiations failed. Soon after this a quarrel between Hum\u00e1yun king of Delhi and Bah\u00e1dur of Gujar\u00e1t gave the friendship of the Portuguese a special importance. As Bah\u00e1dur continued to refuse to allow the Portuguese to build a fort at Diu, Nuno entered into negotiations with Hum\u00e1yun and again pillaged the Gujar\u00e1t coast and took Daman. After the loss of Daman, to win them from their alliance with Hum\u00e1yun, Bah\u00e1dur (1533) made a treaty with the Portuguese, ceding Bassein and its dependencies, and agreeing that Gujar\u00e1t ships bound from Cambay to the Red Sea should touch at Bassein and pay dues; that no Cambay ships should sail without a Portuguese pass; that no war ships should be built in Gujar\u00e1t; and that no alliance should be made with the Turks. In 1535, defeated by Hum\u00e1yun and apparently ruined, Bah\u00e1dur, on promise of their active assistance, agreed to let the Portuguese build a fort at Diu. Bah\u00e1dur had written for help to the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey. But, as time pressed, he did not wait for his answer, but made a treaty with the Portuguese. Under the new agreement the centre of trade was Diu not Bassein, and the fort at Diu was to be built on the site.\n\n---\n\n1 Faria in Kerr, VI. 221.\n2 Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 237; Briggs' Ferishta, III. 219; Faria in Kerr, VI. 231.\n3 Faria in Kerr, VI. 223.\n4 Faria in Kerr, VI. 225.\n5 Faria in Kerr, VI. 227. When Bah\u00e1dur, in the next year, allowed the Portuguese to build a fort at Diu, several of these humiliating terms were cancelled. Faria gives 1534.\nwhich seemed best to the Portuguese Governor-General. In return for this concession the Portuguese did their best to help Bah\u00e1dur to regain his kingdom. They repelled a Moghal attack on Bassein, and a body of 500 Portuguese were most useful in helping Bah\u00e1dur to free Gujar\u00e1t from the Moghals. In 1585 the Portuguese built a fort at Bassein, and the Diu fort was pressed on and finished.\n\nWhen his affairs were again prosperous Bah\u00e1dur repented of having allowed the Portuguese to build at Diu, and invited the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey and the chief of Aden to attack the Portuguese. In 1536 Bah\u00e1dur came to Diu, and, to tempt Nuno da Cunha the Portuguese governor to enter the city, paid his ship a visit. Treachery was planned on both sides, and, when Bah\u00e1dur was landing, a scuffle arose and he and the Portuguese governor of Diu were slain. Two years later, tempted by the great value of a jewelled belt which he had received from Bah\u00e1dur, the Sult\u00e1n of Turkey sent a great expedition to take Diu. His admiral Sulaim\u00e1n besieged the port for two months (September - November 1538). But the heroic defence of the Portuguese garrison, and the well-founded suspicion of the Gujar\u00e1t Musalm\u00e1ns, that if the Turks took Diu they would keep it, forced him to retire defeated. After the withdrawal of the Turks a treaty of peace was concluded between the Portuguese and the king of Gujar\u00e1t. In 1540 Mahmud Sh\u00e1h III. of Gujar\u00e1t besieged Bassein, but failed to take it, and, in the same year, Burh\u00e1n Niz\u00e1m of Ahmadnagar took from their Gujar\u00e1t commandants the forts of Karn\u00e1l\u00e1 in Panvel and of Sangaza or S\u00e1nkshi in Pen. The Gujar\u00e1t commandants applied for help to the Portuguese who retook the forts. They held them for a short time, but, finding them costly, handed them to Ahmadnagar.\n\nIn 1546 the Portuguese gained great honour by the second famous defence of Diu. So completely did they defeat the whole strength of Gujar\u00e1t, that in 1548 Mahmud Sh\u00e1h made overtures for peace and concluded a treaty much in favour of the Portuguese. In 1556 the great hill fort of Asheri and the important station of Manor on the Vaitarna river were taken by the Portuguese. In 1560 Changiz Kh\u00e1n, one of the leading Gujar\u00e1t nobles, in return for help in taking Surat, ceded to the Portuguese the belt of coast from the Vaitarna to Daman. Sidi Bofeta, the commandant of Daman, refused to surrender the fort. But a Portuguese force took the forts\n\n---\n\n1 Faria (Kerr, VI. 236) gives 21st September 1536 as the date of the treaty. Apparently it should be 1535, as, according to the Musalm\u00e1n historians, Hum\u00e1yun took Ch\u00e1mp\u00e1ner in April 1535. Bird's Mir\u00e1t-i-Ahmadi, 249. In the hope of being the first to carry the news of this treaty to Portugal, one Diogo Botelho of Diu sailed in a boat 163 feet long, nine feet broad, and 4\u00bd deep, manned by his own slaves with three Portuguese and two others. After a time the slaves mutinied and were all killed. Botelho persevered and reached Lisbon safe. The bark was destroyed that it might not be known that so small a boat could travel to India.

Daman was strongly garrisoned and was highly valued as a guard to the district of Bassein. In the same year (1560) a body of 3000 Moghal horse attacked Daman, but were driven off with the loss of their baggage. They seem to have seized P\u00e1rnera and to have remained there till they were driven out in 1568. In 1569 the Portuguese attacked the Jawh\u00e1r Kolis, and passed through their country as far east as the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dris. In 1570 the kings of Ahmadnagar, Bij\u00e1pur, Kalikat, and Achin in Sumatra formed a great league against the Portuguese. Mortaza of Ahmadnagar, who was stirred to great exertions by the hope of securing Chaul, Bassein, and Daman, led a mighty army against Chaul. The siege was pressed with vigour and with great loss of life, but, such was the courage and skill of the defence, that after wasting several months Mortaza was forced to retire. The Bij\u00e1pur attack on Goa was equally unsuccessful and the Portuguese gained much honour and respect. From Ch\u00e1ul, Mortaza sent a body of 5000 horse to ravage the Portuguese territories in Th\u00e1na, but the Portuguese drove them off and invaded Ahmadnagar territory, attacking Kaly\u00e1n and burning its suburbs. In 1581 Portugal was conquered by Spain and its eastern possessions passed to the Spaniards without a struggle. In 1583, on his final conquest of Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, the Emperor Akbar attempted to win back Bassein and Daman. But the Portuguese met the Moghals with so vigorous a defence that they were forced to retire. A favourable treaty was afterwards concluded, partly by the good offices of a Portuguese lady who was an inmate of Akbar\u2019s household. In the same year the Portuguese ravaged the Koli country, but suffered considerable loss from the activity of the enemy who, they said, jumped from tree to tree like monkeys. In 1594 the Ahmadnagar king attacked Chaul or Revdanda, and detached a body of horse to ravage Bassein.\n\nThough, for fifty years more, they lost none of their Th\u00e1na possessions, the power of the Portuguese began to wane at the close of the sixteenth century. In 1597 the Dutch, \u2018the scourge\u2019 of Portuguese pride, appeared in Indian seas. In 1609 the governor of Musalm\u00e1n Chaul attacked and harassed the Portuguese at sea. Two years later Malik Ambar, the Ahmadnagar minister, sent an army to take Bassein and S\u00e1lsette but failed. In 1612, in consequence of an injury done to their fleet at Surat the Moghals besieged Daman, Bassein, and Chaul, desolated the country, and had to be bought off. In the same year the naval fame of the Portuguese received a serious blow by the defeat of a great Portuguese fleet.\n\n---\n\n1 Faria in Kerr, VI. 413; Faria gives 1558.\n2 Faria, in Kerr, VI. 421.\n3 Faria, in Kerr, VI. 422.\n4 Nairne\u2019s Konkan, 45.\n5 Faria in Kerr, VI. 423, 437.

And for the next thirty-five years, though they suffered serious loss in other places, the Portuguese continued to hold their Th\u00e1na possessions without loss in area and apparently with an increase of wealth.\\footnote{The revenue of Bassein is said to have risen from Xeraphins 172,920 in 1688 to Rs. 194,748 in 1709, Rs. 310,770 in 1718, and Rs. 914,125 in 1729.

Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 87.} In 1640 Portugal made itself independent of Spain, and, for a few years, fresh interest was shown in its eastern possessions.\n\nDuring the sixteenth century hardly any references have been traced to the inland parts of south and east Th\u00e1na. Except the forts of Karn\u00e1l\u00e1 and S\u00e1nkshi, which remained under Gujar\u00e1t till the middle of the century, south and east Th\u00e1na were under the Ahmadnagar kings, several of the hill-forts being held by local tributary chiefs. These districts, of which Kaly\u00e1n was the head, passed to the Moghals when Ahmadnagar was taken in 1600. They were soon after recovered by Malik Ambar, the Ahmadnagar minister, who held them till his death in 1626, and is said to have surveyed the land and improved the revenue system. After Malik Ambar's death the south of Th\u00e1na or Kaly\u00e1n was kept by the Moghals for ten years and then made over to Bij\u00e1pur. During all this time the wild north-east, apparently as far south as about Bhiwndi and the hill fort of M\u00e1huli, was held by the R\u00e1ja of Jawh\u00e1r and other Koli chiefs. The Kolis had three leading towns, Tavar to the north of Daman, Vazen perhaps V\u00e1sind, and Darila apparently Dheri near Umbargaon, a considerable town of great stone and tiled houses.\\footnote{Nairne's Konkan, 45.}\n\nIn 1534, when Bassein and S\u00e1lsette were ceded to the Portuguese, they found the land guarded by stockades and fortified posts. Besides the land revenue which was taken in kind,\\footnote{Authorities in Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 158.} there was a miscellaneous cash revenue from cesses on cocoanut oil, opium, cotton, palm spirits, vegetables, fish, sugarcane, and betel-leaf, and on butchers, dyers, fishermen, and shepherds.\\footnote{Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Primeiro Roteiro, 112. After its formal cession in 1533, Bombay was rented in perpetuity to Garcia d'Orta, a Lisbon physician, known for his Dialogues on Indian Simples and Drugs. He paid a yearly quit-rent of about \u00a371 12s. (1432 pardos). He mentions his island as Bombaim and Mombaim in his Dialogues, and notices a mango tree that yielded two crops a year. He lived in India from 1534 to 1572. Dr. G. Da Cunha.} In 1538, four years after it came under Portuguese management, Bassein is described as a difficult river, with an excellent beach for small boats in the stormy season. The town was large, the resort of many people and nations. The land was level, and the soil rich and strong. In the rains it was under water and walking was impossible. There were great groves of trees, and many reservoirs and lakes notable for their flights of steps and for their buildings and carvings.\\footnote{Collec\u00e7\u00e3o de Monumentos Ineditos, V.} S\u00e1lsette\nwas famous for the ruins of the great and beautiful city of Th\u00e1na, and\nthe mighty cave temple of Kanheri. The island was very rich and\nwell provided with food, and with poultry and small and big game.\nIn the hills was plenty of timber for ships and galleys.\\footnote{Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Primeiro Roteiro, 70, 72.} Though\nterribly ruined by the ravages of the Portuguese and of the Gujar\u00e1t\nkings, Th\u00e1na was a great city, with 900 gold-lace looms and 1200\nwhite-cloth looms. The low pleasantly-wooded island of Bombay\nhad much game and plenty of meat and rice; its crops were never\nknown to fail.\\footnote{Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro Primeiro Roteiro, 70.}\n\nWhatever damage they may have done when they first conquered\nthe country, the Musalm\u00e1ns seem, long before the Portuguese\ncame, to have ceased to interfere with the religion of the Hindus.\nThe Portuguese found many sacred ponds and fine temples near\nBassein, and De Castro is full of the beauty of the buildings at\nTh\u00e1na whose stones and bricks were fitted without mortar.\\footnote{Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro calls them meskitas or mosques. But the details given\nbelow show that many of the buildings were temples. See Da Cunha, 185.}\n\nOn their transfer to the Portuguese in 1534, the Th\u00e1na coast\nwas made a separate charge and placed under a General of the\nNorth, the second layman in India whose head-quarters were at\nBassein. Lands were granted in estates of a varying number of\nvillages to Portuguese officers and soldiers, who paid a quit-rent\noriginally in cash, but afterwards partly in cash and partly in grain.\nMany of the villages near Bassein and Sop\u00e1ra were originally\ngranted by the Viceroy Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro about 1538. About\ntwelve years later, it was found that the produce of some of the\nvillages had been fraudulently under-estimated and a slight increase\nin the rents was made. The state revenue seems to have been\na very small share of the produce. The receipts are returned as\nvarying from \u00a3676 (Rs. 6760) and 2482 mud\u00e1s of rice in 1539 to\n\u00a34897 (Rs. 48,970) in 1547.\\footnote{The figures are compiled from the Collec\u00e7\u00e3o de Monumentos Ineditos, V. 139-153.\nThe returns have been reduced from fed\u00e9us into rupees, on the basis of thirty fed\u00e9us\nto a pard\u00e3o and two parddos to a rupee. The mud\u00e1s varied so greatly, that it is\nimpossible to ascertain what quantity of rice they represent. The details are given\nin Appendix C.}\n\nFrom 1560, when they had gained the whole coast from Daman to\nKaranja, the Portuguese divided their Th\u00e1na territories into two\nparts, Daman and Bassein. Under Daman were four districts;\nSanj\u00e1n, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, and M\u00e1him; under Bassein were seven\ndistricts, Asheri, Manor, Bassein proper or Saiv\u00e1n, S\u00e1lsette,\nBombay, Bel\u00e1pur or Sh\u00e1b\u00e1z, and Karanja. These divisions\nincluded th\u00e1nad\u00e1ris or village groups under an officer styled th\u00e1nad\u00e1r,\ntowns or kasbes, custom-houses or m\u00e1nduis, villages or aldeas,\nhamlets or sarredores the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1 sadetors meaning cut off or\ndivided, and wards of towns or large villages called pacarias the\nMar\u00e1thhi p\u00e1kh\u00e1dis meaning a dividing lane. There were also lands\nor terras, and gardens or hortas, the modern oarts. Of the seven\ndivisions of the Bassein territory, Asheri had thirty-eight villages\nand six part-villages or p\u0101kh\u0101dis. Manor had forty-two villages and a hamlet, or sadetor. Saiv\u00e1n or Saibana, on the left or south bank of the T\u00e1nsa about fifteen miles north-east of Bassein, was the head-quarters of six petty divisions. These were the town of Bassein with sixteen wards or p\u0101kh\u0101dis and eight gardens; the town of Ag\u00e1shi, apparently, known as the Kasbe, with twenty wards or p\u0101kh\u0101dis and ten gardens; the sub-division or pargana of Salga with eighteen villages and three lands or terras; the division of Hera or Vir\u00e1r with twenty villages; the division of K\u00e1man, six miles east of Bassein, with twenty-five villages and two hamlets or sadetors; and the division of Anj\u00e1r or Anjore, on the Bassein creek near the mouth of the K\u00e1mv\u00e1di, with eighteen villages and seven hamlets or sadetors. S\u00e1lsette had two divisions, the isle of S\u00e1lsette with one pargana and ninety-nine villages, and the town of Th\u00e1na with eight wards or p\u0101kh\u0101dis. The island of Bel\u00e1pur, or Sh\u00e1b\u00e1z or Sabayo, had three sub-divisions, Panechan or Panchnad to the east of the Persik hills with thirty villages, Kairana the coast strip from opposite Th\u00e1na to opposite Trombay with seventeen villages, and Sabayo or Sh\u00e1b\u00e1z, now called Bel\u00e1pur, with seventeen villages\u00b2.\n\nThe island of Karanja or Uran included the town or kasbe of Karanja, the land of Bendolae or Bhendkula, and the three islands of N\u00e1ve or Hog Island, Sheve, and Elephanta.\u00b3\n\nThough subject to occasional inroads from Gujar\u00e1t, the Koli chiefs of Jawh\u00e1r, the Moghals, and Ahmadnagar, the Portuguese territory was fairly free from attacks by land or sea. Internal order was well preserved. The only notice of riot or rebellion was in 1613 (13th April), when fighting went on in Karanja and other towns for several days and many Portuguese were killed.\u2074\n\nOn the cession of S\u00e1lsette and Bassein, in 1538, the Portuguese built places of special strength at Bassein, Asheri, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, M\u00e1him, Daman, and Chaul; they raised royal fortifications at the headquarters of each sub-division; they guarded the entrances to their territories with forts and stockades; they armed several of their colleges and monasteries; and, in each village, the proprietor built a watch-tower or moated grange.\u2075 The hill of Asheri, which wanted little help from art, was strongly guarded from the time of its capture in 1556. The present fortifications of Bassein belong\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Da Cunha\u2019s Chaul and Bassein, 206.

In 1617 the friendship of the Jaeda (Y\u00e1dav) chief of S\u00e1rcota, apparently S\u00e1vta six miles east of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, was so important that the Portuguese allowed him to perform his own rites when he came to Daman.

Chron. de Tis, I. 29, 35.\nto about the close of the sixteenth century,\u00b9 and the beautiful fort of Th\u00e1na was not begun till about 1730, and was unfinished when S\u00e1lsette was taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in 1739.\u00b2 Of creek-bank defences the most notable were four wooden stockades at Sop\u00e1ra made by General Luis de Mello Pereira, soon after the cession of Bassein (1534).\u00b3 Of fortified custom-houses or factories the chief was at Manor,\u2074 and fortified religious houses are mentioned at Yerangal near Versova, and at B\u00e1ndra in S\u00e1lsette.\u2075\n\nIn the north-east, south of Asheri and Manor, a line of forts, along the east or left bank of the Vaitarna, guarded Kelva-M\u00e1him from the raids of the Koli chiefs of Jawh\u00e1r. Of this line of forts traces remain in the villages of Haloli, S\u00e1kda, Dhaisar, and P\u00e1rgaon.\n\nSouth of the T\u00e1nsa river, the fort of M\u00e1ndvi about fifteen miles north-east of Bassein and the stockaded post at the sub-divisional town of Sa\u00edv\u00e1n, five miles east of M\u00e1ndvi, guarded the rich lands of Sop\u00e1ra and Bassein from attacks along the left or south bank of the T\u00e1nsa valley. The Tung\u00e1r and K\u00e1mandurg range, running south from M\u00e1ndvi, protected the eastern frontier as far as the valley of the K\u00e1mv\u00e1di or Bhiwndi river and the Bassein creek. The entrance to Bassein along the right or north bank of this creek was blocked by a line of forts, K\u00e1mbe about two miles west of Bhiwndi, then Ju-N\u00e1ndikna, Gava (Gaunna of the maps), Phiringp\u00e1da, Paigaon, Navgad or Sassu-Navghar, and the striking fortified hillock near the sub-divisional town of K\u00e1man. Further south there was a fortlet named Santa Cruz, on the river bank opposite Kaly\u00e1n, and in the mainland across from Th\u00e1na are remains of mansions or granges which seem to have been fortified. Another row of watch-towers guarded the coast from Shirgaon, fifty miles south to D\u00e1ntivra at the mouth of the Vaitarna.\u2076\n\nUnder the General of the North, these forts were commanded by officers, of whom the chief were the captains of Bassein, Daman, Chaul, and S\u00e1lsette. Besides them, between the Vaitarna and Karanja, were fourteen commandants of forts and stockaded posts.\u2077\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 There was a fort at Bassein from the time of its conquest in 1534; but the present fortifications are not older than about the close of the sixteenth century. Nairne's Konkan, 46. Gemelli Careri (1695) noticed that they were still unfinished. Churchill's Voyages, IV. 191.\n\n\u00b2 S\u00e1lsette was never well defended. There were coast forts at Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi and Versova, a small watch-tower at B\u00e1ndra, and at Th\u00e1na three small fordlets, one to the north of the city a square fort with two bastions named Reis Magos, and two round towers to the south, St. Pedro and St. Jeronimo. In 1728 complaints were made of the defenceless state of the island, and the present beautiful fort was begun. But, according to an English writer (Grose, I. 48-51), from the greed of the Jesuits, it was never finished. See Da Cunha's Bassein, 200.\n\n\u00b3 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 159. See Places of Interest, Sop\u00e1ra.\n\n\u2074 In 1728 Manor is described as not worthy to be called a fort. O. Chron. de Tis, I. 58.\n\n\u2075 Nairne's Konkan, 60. In 1673 the Jesuit college at B\u00e1ndra had seven guns mounted in front and a good store of small arms. Fryer's New Account, 71.\n\n\u2076 Two miles south of Shirgaon fort is Mahim fort, half a mile further the Phadke tower, a mile more the Madla tower, another mile the Alib\u00e1g fort and P\u00e1n tower, further south is the Danda fort, and near Danda the T\u00e1nkicha tower. South of this, almost every village, Usarni, Mathana, Yedvan, Kori, and D\u00e1ntivra has its fort. A little inland are forts at Kartala, Chatalo, and Vir\u00e1than. Mr. W. B. Mulock, C.S.\n\n\u2077 Nairne's Konkan, 50.\nThe captains and commandants were chosen from certain noble families who had a right to the posts. The commands were usually held for a term of three years; but this was not always the case, as the captain of Karanja is mentioned as holding the command for life.\\(^1\\) Under the captain in all important places, the garrison consisted of a certain number of Portuguese soldiers, some native troops, and some slaves.\\(^2\\) To guard the open country nine flying companies, or volantes, were enlisted, and afterwards, as the Moghals and Marathas grew more troublesome, fresh companies of sepoys were formed. There were also two troops of horse, one at Bassein the other at Daman.\\(^3\\) Finally, there was a militia, the owners of every village supplying a few men.\\(^4\\) At sea the Portuguese early established their supremacy and forced Indian traders to take their passes. The coast was guarded by a line of forts, and companies were named from the Goa army-corps to man country boats.\\(^5\\)\n\nTo keep the rule of the sea was no easy task. In 1570 there were two centres of hostile shipping, one on the Malabar coast the other in the Persian gulf. Some writers describe these rivals of the Portuguese as peaceful traders. A few may have been driven from trade by Portuguese exactions. But the bulk of them were pirates and rovers, who not only seized Portuguese ships and ships carrying Portuguese passes, but landed and pillaged the Portuguese coasts.\\(^6\\) So dangerous were they that (1570) the Portuguese had to keep two fleets to act against them, the fleet of the north and the fleet of the south.\\(^7\\) In the beginning of the seventeenth century after the arrival of the Dutch (1597) and the English (1609), the Portuguese ceased to be the first naval power. Till 1624 they continued strong enough to force native craft to carry their passes. But with the English capture of Ormuz in 1623 and the Dutch\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 203. Of the post of captain, Fryer (1673) says: 'The several capitaneos are triennial, which are the alternate governments entailed on the families of the conquerors, and therefore made circular. Every one in his course has his turn to make in some place or other for three years, and upon these they can borrow or take up money as certain as upon their hereditary estates, the next incumbent being security for the payment.' New Account, 73.\n\n\\(^2\\) In Asheri, in the sixteenth century, there is said to have been a garrison of about 700 including women and children. The Europeans were chiefly pardoned criminals. In 1720 there were 150 men and three corporals. (Details are given under Asheri in Places of Interest). In 1634 the Bassein garrison was 2400 strong, of whom 400 were Europeans, 200 Native Christians, and 1800 slaves. O. Chron. de Tis, III, 243. The Thana garrison, in 1634, was a captain, eight soldiers, and four guns. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 181. The Karanja garrison, in 1634, included a captain, six soldiers, one bombardier, and five messengers. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 202. Native soldiers, or piez, are mentioned as early as 1534.

In Bassein and Chaul criminal and civil cases were settled by magistrates, who were subordinate to the captain of the fort and were often forced to decide as the captain pleased.\\(^4\\) From the decision of the magistrate in early times an appeal lay to the Supreme Court or Rela\u00e7\u00e3o at Goa. Afterwards, about 1587, one of the bench of six or eight judges, or desembargadores, was appointed to Bassein. These judges, besides appeals, heard important civil and criminal suits. The cases were conducted by native pleaders, who are said not to have had much knowledge of law.\\(^5\\)\n\nOf the Portuguese land system the available details are given in the Land Administration Chapter.

But, at least in later times, the holder seems to have generally succeeded in having the grant renewed.\\(^1\\)\n\nNo right in the land was conceded to the husbandmen or tenants. They seem to have been treated as part of the estate and not allowed to leave it.\\(^2\\) Besides the villages tilled by their tenants, large landholders generally set apart some of their land as a home farm, and worked it by slaves most of them Africans.\\(^3\\) Lands not granted on quit-rents were let from year to year, by the heads of villages, or m\u00e1ht\u00e1ras, to husbandmen who paid partly by a share of the crop and partly by money cesses.\\(^4\\) These lands were under the supervision of state factors or veadors. Towards the close of the seventeenth century (1688), about one-half of the revenue of the province of Bassein was drawn from quit-rents.\\(^5\\) The rest was partly land revenue collected from peasant-holders, partly the proceeds of cesses.\\(^6\\)\n\nFrom the beginning to the close of their rule in Th\u00e1na, with ebbs and flows of zeal and of success, the conversion of the people to Christianity continued one of the chief objects on which the Portuguese spent their energy and their wealth. In 1534 Goa was made the see of a bishop, and, about the same time, when the Gujar\u00e1t king ceded Bassein and S\u00e1lsette, the great Franciscan Antonio do Porto devoted himself to the spread of Christianity.\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gemelli Careri in Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 200, 201.

They were held in high esteem by the Indian Portuguese, who made them Christians and sometimes raised them to be priests (New Account, I. 10). Hamilton also notices (Ditto, I. 24) the import of slaves from \u00c6thiopia. In driving off the Maskat Arabs from Diu in 1670 African slaves are noted (Ditto, 140) as behaving with great gallantry.

Eight of them came in 1500. The Dominicans were next, arriving in 1513, but they were never so powerful or so successful as the Franciscans. The rise of the Jesuits dates from the arrival of St. Francis Xavier in 1542. A fourth religious body, the Hospitallers, came to India about 1681, but never rose to power. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 99, 227. Gemelli Careri mentions a fifth body the Recolets at T\u00e1rapur: these were a branch of Franciscans. Churchill IV. 198.\nBetween 1534 and 1552 he destroyed 200 temples, made over 10,000 converts, built twelve churches, and, by founding orphanages and monasteries, secured a supply of native priests. Upto 1542 the work of conversion was almost solely carried on by the Franciscans. In 1542 the great St. Francis Xavier landed at Goa, and, with the help of a large body of Jesuits who arrived in the following year, Christianity spread rapidly. St. Xavier took much interest in Bassein. He established a Jesuit seminary in 1548, sent missionaries to Th\u00e1na and Chaul in 1552, and thrice visited Bassein in 1544, 1548, and 1552. Between 1570 and 1590 the Jesuits were most successful in Bassein. They took pains to make Br\u00e1hman and other high-caste converts, knowing that if the Br\u00e1hmans became Christians, many of the lower classes would follow their example, and they made the baptism of converts an occasion of great splendour and rejoicing. With these encouragements the number of converts rose from 1600 in 1573 to 9400 in 1588.\n\nAt Th\u00e1na, about 1560, Gonsala Rodrigues, the superior of the Jesuit monastery, did much to spread Christianity by buying young children and collecting orphans. In three years he baptised from 5000 to 6000 souls. From a special grant this Father founded a Christian village in the waste and wooded but well-watered valley of Veh\u00e1r. Ground was bought and divided into holdings, and, in a few years, there was a population of 3000. They had 100 bullocks and ploughs, and an ample store of field tools all held in common. The villagers had religious teaching every day, and, in the evening, joined in singing the Christian doctrines. Close to the village was a famous shrine to a three-headed god, which pilgrims from Gujar\u00e1t and from K\u00e1nara used to visit. This temple came into the possession of the Christians, the idol was broken, and the temple enlarged and dedicated to the Christian Trinity. The devil, jealous of the Christians, did what he could to mar their success. He appeared and frightened the people, and possessed some of them. The evil spirits would not be exorcised till they were\n\n---\n\n1 Among the temples destroyed by Antonio do Porto some were at Ag\u00e1shi, some at Bassein, and some at Th\u00e1na. At most of the old places of pilgrimage, especially at the sacred pools or tirths, temples were thrown down. Some of the pools were filled with earth. At others, as at one famous pool between Bassein and Ag\u00e1shi, the pool was converted, a chapel built to Our Lady of Healing, and the pilgrimage and cure-working continued. Among Antonio do Porto's reforms was the conversion of the Great Cave (III.) at Kanheri into a church of St. Michael, and the Br\u00e1hman caves at Mandapeshvar into a church of Our Lady of the Conception. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 163, 185, 191. Among the churches built were several by Antonio do Porto at Th\u00e1na and Bassein, and there were three on Karanja. Of his orphanages one was at Ag\u00e1shi, one of 130 boys at Th\u00e1na, one of 300 boys at Veh\u00e1r, and one at Mandapeshvar with 100 orphans (Ditto 159, 188, 192, 202). Of asylums or misericordias there was one in almost every settlement (Ditto 93, 102, 226). Among the converts the two most interesting were the heads of the Hindu monastery at Kanheri. They seem to have been Buddhists. After conversion one was called Paulo Rapozo and the other Francisco de Santa Maria. They were treated with much respect, and Francisco converted several of the other monks to Christianity. Paulo Rapozo was presented with three villages which he left to the college of Mountpezier or Mandapeshvar. Ditto 191.\n\n2 Nairne's Konkan, 52.\n\n3 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 234.\n\n4 Oriente Conquistado, 2nd Ed. p. 85. The lower Hindus sold their children to Musalm\u00e1ns and Christians.

The place was unhealthy and the village had to be moved to a higher site.\\(^1\\) While the Jesuits were so successful in Bassein and in Th\u00e1na, Manuel Gomes a Franciscan made (1575-1590) so many converts in S\u00e1lsette, about 6000 in B\u00e1ndra alone, that he gained the name of the Apostle of S\u00e1lsette, and won for his order the high post of Christian Fathers in all the villages of S\u00e1lsette and Karanja.\\(^2\\)\n\nDuring the seventeenth century the conversion of Hindus, and the building of churches and monasteries was continued, and the church, especially the Jesuits, grew in wealth and power.\\(^3\\) In 1634 there were sixty-three friars at Bassein, thirty of them Franciscans, fifteen Jesuits, ten Dominicans, and eight Augustines.\\(^4\\) The parts about Bassein were thickly peopled with Christians, and the city was studded with Franciscan, Dominican, and Jesuit chapels.\\(^5\\) At Th\u00e1na there was a cathedral and many churches.\\(^6\\) In 1664 the Jesuits suffered by the transfer of Bombay to the English. But the church was richer and more powerful than ever. In 1673 there were, in Th\u00e1na, seven churches and colleges, and in Bassein six churches, four colleges, and two convents.\\(^7\\) All the people in S\u00e1lsette were Christians,\\(^8\\) and the B\u00e1ndra Jesuits lived sumptuously, most of S\u00e1lsette being theirs.\\(^9\\)\n\nPersuasion seems to have been the chief means of conversion. Two hundred years earlier, in 1320, three or four Latin friars, in spite of Musalm\u00e1n persecution, found the Hindus and P\u00e1rsis ready to listen and be converted. The zeal of the early Portuguese friars, their generous gifts of alms, and their kind care of orphans, made many believe that the new faith was better than the old faith, and, in later times, other converts were won by the splendour of the Christian churches and the pomp of the Christian ceremonies. Converts, especially high caste converts, were treated with honour and distinction, and, for the first fifteen years after conversion, the poorer class of Christians were freed from the payment of tithes and first fruits.\\(^10\\) The fact that the people of B\u00e1ndra remained Hindus till about 1580, seems to show that the earlier conversions were the result of persuasion and encouragement, not of force. At the same time, from before the middle of the sixteenth century, the persuasion and encouragement to become Christians were accompanied by rules discouraging and suppressing Hinduism. In 1546 the king of Portugal ordered idols to be broken, idol-makers and performers of Hindu rites to be punished, and mosques to pay tribute.\\(^11\\) These orders were not enforced and were renewed in\n\n---\n\n1 Oriente Conquistado, 2nd Ed. p. 32.\n2 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 196. The duties of the Christian Father, or Pater Christianorum, were to further Christianity, to foster Christians, and to gather others to Christ. (Ditto 102). The Jesuits held this office in Goa and Kochin, and the Dominicans in Chaul and Diu. Ditto.\n3 Among seventeenth century churches were three in Th\u00e1na built in 1605, the Jesuit college of St. Anne's in B\u00e1ndra begun in 1620, and the chapel of Mount Mary, also at B\u00e1ndra, probably about 1640.\n4 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 241.\n5 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 101.\n6 Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 182.\n7 Nairne's Konkan, 54.\n8 Fryer's New Account, 73.\n9 Fryer's New Account, 70.\n10 Nairne's Konkan, 55.\n11 Nairne's Konkan, 55.\n1555. Feasts and ceremonies, and Brahman preachings washings and burnings were forbidden; any one found with idols was to be sent to the galleys and his property forfeited. These orders were for a time evaded by the grant of licenses, but they seem to have been enforced in 1581.\n\nIn 1560 the Inquisition was established in Goa, and by 1580 agents of the Inquisition, called commissaries, were at work in Chaul, Bassein, and Daman, collecting offenders and sending them for trial and punishment to Goa. During the seventeenth century the power and wealth of the church increased. In 1678 they are said to have held most of Salsette. In 1695 the revenue of the church was said to be greater than the revenue of the king, and in 1720 the power of the church was so great that they supervised the General of the North and made his government both uneasy and precarious. The wealth of the church came partly from fines, tithes, first fruits, and state grants of money, but chiefly from gifts of land made both by the King and by private persons.\n\nOn the whole Portuguese rule did good to the country. Till the middle of the seventeenth century order was well kept and life and property were fairly safe, large areas of salt waste and salt marsh were reclaimed, tillage was spread, and better and richer crops were grown. The country was covered with fine buildings; the church was rich and bountiful; the nobles and landlords were wealthy and prosperous, and the tenants, though they had little freedom, seem to have been well off. In 1630, Goez wrote that the persecution of the Portuguese had driven the people into the neighbouring territories, and that between Bassein and Daman the greater part of\n\n---\n\n1 Nairne's Konkan, 55.\n2 Nairne's Konkan, 55. The view that during the sixteenth century there was practical freedom from religious persecution in Portuguese territory is supported by Fulke Greville's remark in 1599, that at Goa people of all nations were allowed to live after their own manners and religion, only in matters of justice they were ruled by Portuguese law. Bruce's Annals, I, 126. This tolerance seems to have lasted till much later times, as Baldens about 1662 (Churchill's Voyages, III, 545) notices that Kanarins, Moors, and Pagans of all nations, and Hamilton, about 1700 (New Account, I, 251), notices that many Gentooes lived in Goa. Careri (Churchill's Voyages, IV, 203) about the same time states that most of the merchants in Goa were idolaters and Muhammadans who lived by themselves and had no public use of their religion.\n3 Dellon in 1683 gives an account of the cruelties practised at the Goa Inquisition. Compare Hough's Christianity in India, I, 212-237. The Goa Inquisition was closed in 1774; it was again opened in 1779, and was finally suppressed in 1812. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 235.\n4 Fryer's New Account, 70. Fryer (1673) is one of the few English writers who takes the side of the priests. 'All had now bowed to the cross, had they not been prevented by unhappy pretenders who preferred merchandise and private piques to the welfare of religion. It is morally probable, had not the Dutch and we interfered, all might have been Christians in these parts of the world.'

Of money grants the vicar of Karanja got \u00a328 (reis 42,000); orphanages and monasteries got cash grants; the Christian Fathers were paid by the state, an old mosque fund was made over to the church. There were many grants of lands, and, unlike land grants to private persons, lands given to the church belonged to it for ever. Da Cunha's Chaul and Bassein, 102, 187, 201, 203, 235.\nthe land was untilled. If this account is correct the districts soon recovered their prosperity. In 1634 the island of Karanja was so well managed that its surplus revenue was used to help to spread religion in and out of India.\n\nDuring the sixteenth and the first part of the seventeenth centuries, the wild north-east of Th\u00e1na remained under the Koli chiefs of Jawh\u00e1r, and, except for a year or two at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the south-east or Kaly\u00e1n district remained under Ahmadnagar. On Malik Ambar\u2019s death, in 1626, Kaly\u00e1n passed to the Moghals. In 1632 Sh\u00e1hji, Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s father, in the name of a child of the Ahmadnagar family, seized N\u00e1sik, Trimbak, Sangamner, Junnar, and Kaly\u00e1n. In 1635 a Moghal officer was sent to recover the Konkan from Sh\u00e1hji, and forced him to take refuge in the hill-fort of M\u00e1luli, and at last to surrender. In 1636, as Adil Kh\u00e1n of Bij\u00e1pur agreed to pay tribute, the Konkan was made over to him, and in the following year (1637) Sh\u00e1hji entered the service of Bij\u00e1pur. For ten years the province of Kaly\u00e1n, which is represented as stretching from the Vaitarna to the N\u00e1gothma river, remained under Bij\u00e1pur. The places specially noticed as ceded to Bij\u00e1pur are Jival or Chaul, B\u00e1bal or P\u00e1bal perhaps the port of Panvel, Danda-R\u00e1jpuri, and Ch\u00e1k\u00e1n in west Poona. In 1648, by the capture of Kaly\u00e1n, Shiv\u00e1ji began the series of aggressions, which, after a century of disorder, ended in the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s gaining the whole of Th\u00e1na, except the island of Bombay and some tracts in the wild north-east. Kaly\u00e1n town was retaken by the Moghals about 1661; but Shiv\u00e1ji seems to have continued to hold part of the Kaly\u00e1n district, as in 1663 he collected a force near Kaly\u00e1n, and, in 1666, seems to have had an officer whom he styled governor of Kaly\u00e1n.\n\nIn the North Konkan ports, the sixteenth and the first half of the seventeenth centuries, between the arrival of the Portuguese and the establishment of the English at Bombay, was on the whole a time of declining trade. At the beginning of the sixteenth century, Chaul and Th\u00e1na, especially Chaul, were great centres of foreign trade, having direct dealings westwards with the Persian Gulf, the Arabian coast, Egypt, and the African coast; south with Ceylon; and east with Chittagong, Achin in Sumatra, and Malacca. In the latter\n\n---\n\n1 Calcutta Review, V. 271, in Da Cunha\u2019s Chaul and Bassein, 143. \u2018T\u00e1r\u00e1pur was very rich, the best and most prosperous of the Daman districts.\u2019 Do Couto, VIII, 28, 208 in Nairne\u2019s Konkan, 44.\n2 Da Cunha\u2019s Chaul and Bassein, 203.\n3 Musalm\u00e1n writers include the north-east of Th\u00e1na in B\u00e1g\u00e1n, which, according to their accounts, stretched to the sea.

Still Bassein, M\u00e1him, Th\u00e1na, and Chaul maintained a large coasting traffic with the Malab\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, and Sindh ports, and a considerable foreign trade with the Persian Gulf, the Arabian and African coasts, and, to some extent, with Ceylon and the east. In the seventeenth century the direct European trade, centering in Surat in the hands of the British and the Dutch, passed more completely from the Konkan ports, and in the decay of Portuguese power the foreign trade with Persia, Arabia, Africa, and the east declined.\u00b9 There remained little but a coasting traffic, chiefly north with Surat and south with Goa.\n\nUnder the Portuguese, foreign trade was a monopoly of the king. Most of the local sea trade was in the hands of free-traders or interlopers, whom the Portuguese government tried to put down.\u00b2 The Bassein timber trade was chiefly carried on by the captains of forts and other government officers.\u00b3\n\nDuring this period the chief local marts were Chaul, Th\u00e1na, M\u00e1him, and Bassein; and among places of less importance were Panvel, Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwndi, Kelva-M\u00e1him, Ag\u00e1shi, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur and Bombay.\u2074 The chief marts with which the Th\u00e1na ports were connected were, in India, Cambay Diu and Surat in Gujar\u00e1t, and Diul-Sindhi in Sindh; Goa, Kalikat, Kochin, and Kulam on the Malab\u00e1r coast; and Chittagong on the Bay of Bengal. Of foreign marts there were Ormuz and Maskat in the Persian Gulf, and Shehr Julfar and Kalat on the Arabian coast; Socotra and Aden at the mouth of the Red Sea; Mocha Jidda and the Abyssinian coast on the Red Sea; Zaila, Quiloa, Brava, Mombaza, Melinda, Megadozo, and Sof\u00e1la in East Africa; Colombo in the south; and, in the east, Malacca and Achin.\u2075\n\nThe articles of trade between the Konkan coast and these different marts were, of Food, rice, pulse, vegetables, cocoanuts, and\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 The Portuguese lost Ormuz in the Persian Gulf in 1622, Maskat in 1650; and the east African ports between 1624 and 1698.

The early Portuguese were greatly struck with the basalt columns of Dh\u00e1rvi in west Salsette. In 1538 Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro wrote: Opposite Bassein is a mine of obelisks, a wonderful display of the power of nature. There is an infinite number of them arranged with such order and agreement that they seem to be organ pipes. Some of the pillars are four-sided, some five-sided, and some eight-sided. Each is so polished and perfect that it seems wrought by the hand of Phidias or other excellent workman. All stand very straight. Some touch, but each is self-contained, none springing out of or resting on another. They are about six feet broad. How long they are, it is impossible to say, for the only interest people take in them is in breaking not in measuring them. They stand from thirteen to sixteen cubits out of the ground, and apparently run underground as deep as the sea. If so the smallest obelisks would be ninety feet high. Had the hill held a mine of ore it would have been levelled with the plain; had the obelisks been pearls, at great danger to life the bottom of the sea would have been scoured for them. But because they are simply wonderful, men are too timid, too lazy to find out about them.

Apparently fine muslins came by sea from Bengal, Barbosa, 179.\nand velvets, and silk stuffs, brocades, and coloured silks were brought through the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and round the Cape of Good Hope. Of Woollens, blankets were made in Th\u00e1na, and rugs, scarlet woollens, coarse camlets, and Norwich stuffs were brought from Europe round the Cape, and by the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. There was an export of sandals and an import of Spanish shoes. Among miscellaneous articles of dress brought from Europe were gloves, belts, girdles, beaver hats, and plumes of feathers. Of Personal Ornaments, jewels, pearls, and strings of agate beads went from Chaul to the Arabian coast, and turquoises, pearls, and lapis lazuli came to the Konkan from the Persian Gulf; ivory came from Abyssinia and was a great article of trade at Chaul; and cut and branch coral came from Europe. Of Spices, in which there was a great trade, pepper came from the Malab\u00e1r coast and Sumatra, cinnamon from Ceylon, camphor from Borneo, and cloves from the Moluccas, partly direct partly through the Malab\u00e1r ports. These spices were used locally, sent inland, or re-exported to Persia and Arabia. Of Drugs, opium is mentioned as brought from Burh\u00e1npur in Kh\u00e1ndesh and from Aden. Of dyes, indigo was brought from Burh\u00e1npur, madder from Arabia, dragon\u2019s blood from Socotra, vermilion from Ormuz, Aden, and Europe, and pigeon\u2019s dung from Africa.

Of new comers there were the Portuguese, and, occasionally, though they had few direct dealings with the north Konkan, English, Dutch, French, and Danes. In the beginning of the sixteenth century many Moorish merchants are noticed at Chaul, and trading from Chaul to the Malab\u00e1r coast.\\(^8\\) Hindus, as in previous periods, are found at long distances from India.

Between 1550 and 1600 great ships built at Ag\u00e1shi and Bassein made many voyages to Europe,\\(^11\\) and, in 1634, the English had four pinnaces built for the coast trade, two at Daman and two at Bassein.\\(^12\\) The Portuguese historian Gaspar Correa gives a fuller description than any previous writer of the craft which were built at this time in the Konkan ports. The local boats in ordinary use were of two kinds, one which had the planking joined and sewn together with coir thread, the other whose planks were fastened with thin nails with broad heads which were rivetted inside with other broad heads fitted on.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ormuz, Stanley's Barbosa, 42; Aden, ditto 28; the Cape, Vasco da Gama's Three Voyages, 344; much of the quicksilver went inland, Stanley's Barbosa, 70.\n\n\\(^2\\) 1627, O.

Albuquerque (1510) found large numbers of Hindus who seem to have been chiefly southerners 'Quilons and Chitins' in Malacca. They were governed by a Hindu in accordance with Hindu customs (Com. III., 146; compare Barbosa, 193, 194). There were Hindu rulers in Java and Sumatra. (Ditto, III., 73, 79, 151-161). Four Malab\u00e1rs went with Vasco da Gama (1500) to Portugal and came back to Kalikat; on their return the Zamorin would not see them as they were only fishermen. Kerr's Voyages, II., 406. In 1612 (Kerr's Voyages, VIII., 476) Sarris got a letter from the Sh\u00e1ibandar of Mocha in the Banian language and character; and in 1660 Baldaeus (Churchill, III., 513-515) mentions Banian temples at Mocha. In 1603 Benedict Goes found Br\u00e1hmans at Gialalabath south of the Oxus; the king of Bokh\u00e1ra allowed them to levy a toll. Yule's Cathay, II., 559.

No place had better timber than Bassein. Ditto, 115.\n\n\\(^12\\) Bruce's Annals, I., 334.\nThe ships sewn with coir had keels, those fastened with nails were flat-bottomed; in other respects they were alike. The planks of the ship-sides went as high as the cargo, and above the planks were cloths thicker than bed-sacking and pitched with bitumen mixed with fish and cocoanut oil. Above the cloths were cane mats of the length of the ship, woven and very strong, a defence against the sea which let no water pass through. Inside, instead of decks, were chambers for the cargo covered with dried and woven palm-leaves, forming a shelving roof off which the rain ran and left the goods dry and unhurt. Above the palm-leaves cane mats were stretched, and on these the seamen walked without doing any harm. The crew were lodged above; no one had quarters below where the merchandise was stored. There was one large mast and two ropes on the sides, and one rope at the prow like a stay, and two halliards which came down to the stern and helped to hold the mast. The yard had two-thirds of its length abaft and one-third before the mast, and the sail was longer abaft than forward by one-third. They had only a single sheet, and the tack of the sail at the bow was made fast to the end of a sprit, almost as large as the mast with which they brought the sail very forward, so that they steered very close to the wind and set the sails very flat. They had no top-masts and no more than one large sail. The rudder, which was very large and of thin planks, was moved by ropes which ran along the outside of the ship. The anchors were of hard wood, and they fastened stones to the shanks so that they went to the bottom. They carried their drinking water in square and high tanks.\n\nOf Gujar\u00e1t boats the ordinary deep-sea traders were apparently from 100 to 150 tons burden. Besides these, there were in the sixteenth century some great vessels from 600 to 1000 tons burden, and in the seventeenth century, in the pilgrim traffic between Surat and Mocha, still larger ships were used, from 1400 to 1600 tons and able to carry 1700 passengers.\n\nGoa was also a great ship-building place. In 1508 the Portuguese found that the carpenters and caulkers of the king of Bij\u00e1pur had built ships and galleys after the model of the Portuguese, and in 1510 twelve very large ships were built after the model of the Flor de la Mar.\n\n---\n\n1 Vasco da Gama's Three Voyages, 239-242. A full account of the Portuguese shipping about 1600 is given in Pyrard, II, 118.\n2 In 1612, Downton in Kerr's Voyages, VIII, 426.\n3 In 1510 Albuquerque found a beautiful fleet at Ormuz rigged out with flags, standards, and coloured ensigns. One of them was 600 tons and another 1000 tons, with many guns and fire-arms, and with men in sword-proof dresses. She was so well fitted that she required nothing from the king's magazine. She had three great stone anchors. Com. I, 105; II, 122.\n4 1618, Terry in Kerr's Voyages, IX, 391, 392. One reason for building such large ships was that they might put to sea in the stormy months and avoid the Portuguese.\n5 The Gujaratis load their great ships of 900, 1200, and 1500 tons at Gogha, and steal out unknown to the Portuguese. These ships were called Monsoon Junks (Kerr's Voyages, IX, 230). They are described as ill-built like an overgrown lighter broad and short but exceeding big (Terry's Voyage, 130). The scantlings of the Rahimi of 1500 tons were length 153 feet, breadth 42 feet, depth 31 feet. Kerr's Voyages, VIII, 487. Part of the crew in these big vessels were often Dutch. Baldens in Churchill, III, 513.\n6 Com. of Alb, II, 82.\nAccording to Varthema (1500) the Kalikat boats were open and of three or four hundred butts in size. They were built without oakum, as the planks were joined with very great skill. They laid on pitch outside and used an immense quantity of iron nails. The sails were of cotton, and at the foot of each sail was a second sail which they spread to catch the wind. Their anchors were of stone fastened by two large ropes. One of these Kalikat vessels is mentioned of 140 tons, with fifty-two of a crew, twenty to bail out water and for other purposes below, eight for the helm, four for the top and yard business, and twenty boys to dress provisions. Very large boats are mentioned as trading to the Coromandel coast.\n\nMany foreign ships visited the Th\u00e1na ports. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Maskat was a great ship-building place. In 1510 Albuquerque found two very large ships ready to launch and a fleet of thirty-four ships great and small. The establishment of Portuguese power in the Persian Gulf seems to have depressed the local seamen, as in the beginning of the seventeenth century the Persian Gulf boats are described as from forty to sixty tons, the planks sewn with date fibre and the tackle of date fibre. The anchor was the only bit of iron. The Red Sea ships were larger and better built and were managed with great skill. In the beginning of the sixteenth century large junks from Java and Malacca came to the Coromandel and Malab\u00e1r coasts, and may occasionally have visited Chaul.\n\nThe greatest change in the shipping of this period was the introduction of the square-rigged Portuguese vessels. They caused much astonishment at Anjidiv; the people had never seen any ships like them. The vessels in Vasco da Gama\u2019s first fleet (1497-1500) varied from two hundred to fifty tons. The size was\n\n---\n\n1 Badger\u2019s Varthema, 152-154. Of these larger ships the flat-bottomed were called Sambuchis and those with keels Capels. Sambuchis seem to be Sambuks and Capels the same as Caravels, round lateen-rigged boats of 200 tons, (Com. of Alb. I. 4). Of smaller boats there were praus of ten paces, all of one piece with oars and a cane mast; almadias also all of one piece with a mast and oars; and katurs two-prowed, thirteen paces long, and very narrow and swift. These katurs were used by pirates (Ditto). A few years later Barbosa (p. 147) describes the ships of the Moors of Kalikat, as of about 200 tons, with keels but without nails, the planks sewn with mat cords, well pitched, the timber very good. They were without decks, but had divisions for stowing the merchandise separately.\n\n2 1612, Downton in Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VIII. 425.\n\n3 1500, Vasco da Gama\u2019s Three Voyages, 339. They carried more than 1000 measures of rice of 105 pecks each.\n\n4 Commentaries, I. 71, 81, 82.\n\n5 John Eldred in Kerr\u2019s Voyages, VIII. 6.\n\n6 One is mentioned in 1500 of 600 tons and 300 fighting men and bands of music with seven elephants (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, II. 412); another in 1502 had 700 men (Vasco da Gama\u2019s Three Voyages, 315); another in the same year had 300 passengers (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, II. 435-436).\n\n7 Stanley\u2019s Barbosa, 193; Albuquerque\u2019s Commentaries, III. 63. So skilful were the J\u00e1va boat-builders that Albuquerque (1511) brought sixty of them to Goa. Ditto, III. 168.\n\n8 1498, Kerr\u2019s Voyages, II. 388. What astonished the people was the number of ropes and the number of sails; it was not the size of the ships, Vasco da Gama\u2019s Three Voyages, 145, 149.\n\n9 The details were, the San Gabriel, the San Raphael, the Birrio, and a transport for provisions called a naveta (Lindsay\u2019s Merchant Shipping, II. 4). The size of these boats is generally given at from 100 to 200 tons (Kerr\u2019s Voyages, II. 521). But\nsoon increased to 600 and 700 tons, a change which had the important effect of forcing foreign trade to centre at one or two great ports. Of smaller vessels the Portuguese had caravels and galleys. Before the close of the sixteenth century the size of the European East Indiamen had greatly increased. As early as 1590, the Portuguese had ships of 1600 tons; in 1609 the Dutch had ships of 1000 tons; and in 1615 there was an English ship of 1293 tons. Hindu captains and sailors are mentioned, but the favourite seamen were Arabs and Abyssinians. A great advance had been made in navigation. The Musalmans of Mozambique (1498) used Genoese compasses, and regulated their voyages by quadrants and sea charts; the Moors were so well instructed in so many arts of navigation that they yielded little to the Portuguese. Trade was still harassed by pirates, though they seem to have been less formidable than they had been in the fifteenth century or than they again were in the seventeenth century. Before the pirates were put down by the Portuguese, Bombay harbour, Goa, and Porka on the Kalikat coast were noted centres of piracy.\n\nMr. Lindsay thinks they were larger between 250 and 300 tons register. The picture he gives shows the San Gabriel to have been a three-masted vessel with a high narrow poop and a high forecastle. The Gujarat batela and the Arab botel seem from their name (Port. batel a boat) and from the shape of their sterns to have been copied from Portuguese models. See Appendix A.\n\n1 The 1502 fleet was one 700, one 500, one 450, one 350, one 230, and one 160-ton ships, Kerr's Voyages, II. 521; in the 1503 fleet was one 600-ton ship.

Of galleys Dom Jo\u00e3o de Castro (1540) notices three kinds: bastardos from 20 to 300 tons, 130 soldiers and 140 men decked, with sails and 27 benches of three oars; subtis, 25 benches of three oars, the crew and size the same as bastardos; and fustas, smaller with 17 benches of two oars. Primeiro Roteiro, 275.\n\n3 In 1592 a Portuguese carack of 1600 tons was caught and taken as a prize to Dartmouth. It was 165 feet long, 46 feet broad, and 31 feet draught. Its main mast was 121 feet long and its main yard 106 feet. It had seven stories, one main orlop, three close decks, one forecastle, and a spar deck.

In 1616 a Portuguese carack of 1600 tons had a brilliant fight with four English vessels. Low's Indian Navy, I. 25-27. The first English fleet in the east included one ship of 600 tons with 200 men, one of 200 tons with 100 men, one of 260 tons with 80 men, one of 240 tons with 80 men, and one of 100 tons with forty men.

In 1514, the Bombay pirate boats were small vessels like watch-boats, which went out to sea plundering and sometimes killing the crew of any weak boat they met. Stanley's Barbosa, 69.\nIn November 1664, the island of Bombay passed from the Portuguese to the English. The English had for years been anxious to gain a station on the Konkan coast. In June 1661, as part of the dower of his sister Katherine, the King of Portugal ceded the island and harbour of Bombay, which the English understood to include Salsette and the other harbour islands. In March 1662 a fleet of five men-of-war, under the command of the Earl of Marlborough, with Sir Abraham Shipman and 400 men accompanied by a new Portuguese Viceroy, left England for Bombay. Part of the fleet reached Bombay in September 1662 and the rest in October 1662. On being asked to make over Bombay and Salsette to the English, the governor contended that the island of Bombay had alone been ceded, and on the ground of some alleged irregularity in the form of the letters or patent, he refused to give up even Bombay. The Portuguese Viceroy declined to interfere, and Sir Abraham Shipman was forced to retire first to Suvali at the mouth of the Tapti, and then to the small island of Anjidiv off the Karwar coast. Here, cooped up and with no proper supplies, the English force remained for more than two years, losing their general and three hundred of the four hundred men. In November 1664, Sir Abraham Shipman's successor Mr. Humfrey Cooke, to preserve the remnant of his troops, agreed to accept Bombay without its dependencies, and to grant special privileges to its Portuguese residents.\n\nIn 1498, the Goa pirate craft are described as small brigandines filled with men, ornamented with flags and streamers, beating drums, and sounding trumpets. Kerr's Voyages, II, 387. Some pirate boats caught at Goa, in 1500, had small guns and cannon, javelins, long swords, large wooden bucklers covered with hides, long light bows, and long broad-pointed arrows. Vasco da Gama's Three Voyages, 252. There was already a European element in the Goa pirates. Ditto, 244.\n\n1 In 1625 the Directors proposed that the Company should take Bombay. Accordingly, in 1626, the President at Surat suggested to the Dutch a joint occupation of the island, but the Dutch declined, and the scheme was abandoned (Bruce's Annals, I, 273). In 1640 the Surat Council brought Bombay to notice as the best place on the west coast of India for a station (Ditto, I, 366), and, in 1652, they suggested that Bombay and Bassein should be bought from the Portuguese (I, 472). In 1654, in an address to Cromwell, the Company mentioned Bassein and Bombay as the most suitable places for an English settlement in India (I, 488). In 1659 the Surat Council recommended that an application should be made to the King of Portugal to cede some place on the west coast, Danda-Rajpuri, Bombay, or Versova (Ditto, I, 543). Finally, at the close of 1661 (7th December), in a letter which must have crossed the Directors' letter telling of the cession of Bombay, the President at Surat wrote (Ditto, II, 111) that, unless a station could be obtained which would place the Company's servants out of the reach of the Moghal and Shivaji and render them independent of the overbearing Dutch, it would be more prudent to bring off their property and servants, than to leave them exposed to continual risks and dangers.\n\nIt was its isolated position rather than its harbour that made the English covet Bombay. Then and till much later, Bombay harbour was by many considered too big. In 1857, in meeting objections urged against Karwar on the ground of its smallness, Captain Taylor wrote (27th July 1857), 'Harbours can be too large as well as too small. The storms of 1837 and 1854 show us that Bombay would be a better port if it was not open to the south-west, and had not an expanse of eight milcs of water to the south-east.'\n\n2 According to Captain Hamilton (1680-1720), 'the royalties appending on Bombay reached as far as Versova in Salsette.' (New Account, I, 183). This does not agree with other writers and is probably inaccurate.\n\n3 Cooke renounced all claims to the neighbouring islands, promised to exempt the Portuguese from customs, to restore deserters, runaway slaves, husbandmen, and craftsmen, and not to interfere with the Roman Catholic religion. Trans. Bom.\nisland was handed over, only 119 Englishmen landed in Bombay. At the time of the transfer the island is said to have had 10,000 inhabitants and to have yielded a revenue of about \u00a32800 (Rs.28,000).\n\nThe cession of Bombay and its dependencies was part of a scheme under which England and Portugal were to join in resisting the growing power of the Dutch. A close alliance between the English and the Portuguese seemed their only chance of safety. In 1656 the Dutch had driven the Portuguese from Ceylon. They were besieging the English at Bantam and blockading the Portuguese at Goa; 'If the Dutch took Goa, Diu must follow, and if Diu fell, the English Company might wind up their affairs.' The scheme was ruined by the looseness of the connection between the Portuguese in Europe and the Portuguese in India. The local Portuguese feeling against the cession of territory was strong, and the expression of the King's surprise and grief at their disobedience failed to overcome it. Bitter hatred, instead of friendship, took the place of the old rivalry between the Portuguese and the English.\n\nWithout the dependencies which were to have furnished supplies and a revenue, the island was costly, and, whatever its value as a place of trade, it was no addition of strength in a struggle with the Dutch. The King determined to grant the prayer of the Company and to hand them Bombay as a trading station. On the first of September 1668, the ship Constantinople arrived at Surat, bringing the copy of a Royal Charter bestowing Bombay on the Honourable Company. The island was granted 'in as ample a manner as it came to the crown,' and was to be held on the payment of a yearly quit-rent of \u00a310 in gold. With the island were granted all stores arms and ammunition, together with such political powers as were necessary for its defence and government. In these three years of English management the revenue of the island had risen from about \u00a33000 to about \u00a36500.\n\nGeog. Soc. III. 68-71. These terms were never ratified either by the English or by the Portuguese. Anderson's English in Western India, 53. According to Mr. James Douglas, Kolaba Point or Old Woman's Island was at first refused as not being part of Bombay. It and 'Putachos,' apparently Butcher's Island, seem to have been taken in 1666.

Bruce, II, 175, 214. Of the relations between the Portuguese in India and the Portuguese in Europe, Fryer writes (New Account, 62), 'The Portuguese in East India will talk big of their King and how nearly allied to them, as if they were all cousin-germans at least. But for his commands, if contrary to their factions, they value them no more than if they were merely titular.'\n\n6 Bruce's Annals, II, 199. The troops which formed the Company's first military establishment in Bombay numbered 198, of whom five were commissioned officers, 139 non-commissioned officers and privates, and fifty-four hat-wearing half-castes or topazes. There were twenty-one pieces of cannon and proportionate stores. Ditto, 240.\n\n7 The details are given in Warden's Landed Tenures of Bombay, 8.\nThe factors at first thought so poorly of their new possession, that, in 1668, they proposed to the Surat Council that Bombay should be given up, and the factory moved to Janjira rock. But soon after, they began to esteem it 'a place of more consequence than they had formerly thought.' Under the able management of Gerald Aungier (1669-1677) the revenue rose from \u00a36500 to \u00a39260 and the population from ten thousand to sixty thousand, while the military force was increased to four hundred Europeans and 1500 Portuguese native militia.\n\nIn 1674 the traveller Fryer found the weak Government house, which under the Portuguese had been famous chiefly for its beautiful garden, loaded with cannon and strengthened by carefully guarded ramparts. Outside the fortified house, were the English burying-place and fields where cows and buffaloes grazed. At a short distance from the fort lay the town, in which confusedly lived the English, Portuguese, Topazes, Gentoos, Moors, and Koli Christians mostly fishermen. The town was about a mile in length with low houses, roofed with palm-leaves, all but a few left by the Portuguese and some built by the Company. There was a 'reasonable handsome' bazar, and at the end next the fort, a pretty house and church of the Portugals with orchards of Indian fruit.\n\nA mile further up the harbour was a great fishing town, with a Portuguese church and religious house; then Parel with another church and estates belonging to the Jesuits. At Mahim the Portuguese had a complete church and house, the English a pretty customs-house and guard-house, and the Moors a tomb. The north and north-west were covered with coccos, jacks, and mangoes. In the middle was Varli with an English watch. Malabar hill was a rocky wooded mountain, with, on its seaward slope, the remains of a stupendous pagoda. Of the rest of the island, 40,000 acres of what might have been good land was salt marsh. In Kamathipura there was water enough for boats, and at high tides the waves flooded the present Bhendi Bazar and flowed in a salt stream near the temple of Mumbadevi. Once a day Bombay was a group of islets, and the spring-tides destroyed all but the barren hills.\n\nTen years more of fair prosperity were followed by about twenty years of deep depression (1688-1710). Then, after the union of the London and the English Companies, there came a steady, though at first slow, advance. But for fifty years more the English gained no fresh territory, and, except at sea, took no part in the struggles between the Moghals, Marathas, Sidis, Angrias, and Portuguese.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff, 99.\n2 Anderson, 56; Low's Indian Navy, I. 61.\n3 Of the \u00a36500 of revenue in 1667, \u00a32000 were from the land. The Portuguese quitrents were supposed to represent one-fourth of the crop. Bruce's Annals, III. 105.\n4 Fryer's New Account, 61-70. Stones of this old temple are still preserved near the Valukeshvar reservoir.\n5 Bruce's Annals, II. 215; Anderson, 53, 54; Hamilton's Description of Hindustan, II. 154.\n6 Of the position of the English in Bombay, Fryer wrote in 1673: 'Our present concern is with the Portugals, Shivaji, and the Moghal. From the first is desired no more than a mutual friendship, from the second an appearance only, from the last a nearer commerce. The first and second become necessary for provisions for the belly.'\nSECTION III.\u2014THE MAR\u00c1TH\u00c1S.\n\nOn his escape from Delhi at the close of 1666, Shiv\u00e1ji drove the Moghals out of most of the south-east of Th\u00e1na. They continued to hold the great hill-forts of Karn\u00e1la and M\u00e1luli, but, after heavy fighting, lost them also in 1670. In 1670 the Portuguese defeated Shiv\u00e1ji at sea. But he came perilously near them on land, taking several forts in the north-east of Th\u00e1na and attacking Ghobandar in S\u00e1lsette. This advance of Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s led the English to send him an envoy, and an alliance was agreed to, in which he promised to respect the English possessions. In 1672 the Sidi of Janjira, whose appointment as Moghal admiral had lately (1662) increased his importance, blockaded the Karanja river and made a fort at its mouth. In October of the same year (1672) a Sidi and Moghal squadron landed troops on the banks of the N\u00e1gothna river, laid the country waste, and carried off the people as slaves.\n\nIn February 1673 a Dutch fleet, under their Governor General, appeared before Bombay and caused such alarm that the settlers fled to the Portuguese territories. But the Governor, Gerald Aungier, had given so much care to the fortifications and to strengthening the garrison and organizing the militia that, after hovering about the mouth of the harbour for some time, the Dutch retired without attempting an attack. Another cause of difficulty in Bombay were the Sid\u00eds. Nearly every season between 1672 and 1680, sometimes with leave sometimes without leave, the Sid\u00eds came to Bombay to winter, that is to pass the stormy south-west monsoon (May-October). In 1674 they scared the people from Sion fort in the north-east of the Island, but were attacked by English troops, and an agreement was made that not more than 300 of the Sidi\u2019s men were to remain on shore at one time and that none of them were to have any arms except a sword. These visits placed the English in an unpleasant dilemma. If they allowed the Sid\u00eds to land, they roused the suspicion and anger of Shiv\u00e1ji; if they forbad the Sid\u00eds landing they displeased the Moghals.\n\nand building, the third for the gross of our trade. Wherefore offices of civility must be performed to each of these: but they, sometimes interfering, are the occasion of jealousies, these three being so diametrically opposite one to another. For, while the Moghal brings his fleet either to winter or to recruit in this bay, Seva takes offence: on the other hand, the Moghal would soon put a stop to all business should he be denied. The Portugals, in league with neither, think it a mean compliance in us to allow either of them countenance, especially to furnish them with guns and weapons to turn upon Christians which they wisely make an Inquisition crime.

An embassy sent by the Bombay Government found him friendly. He granted them leave to trade to any part of his territory on paying an import duty of two and a half per cent; he allowed them to establish factories at R\u00e1j\u00e1pur and D\u00e1bhol in Ratn\u00e1giri, at Chaul in Kol\u00e1ba, and at Kaly\u00e1n; and he arranged to make good part of their losses from his sack of R\u00e1j\u00e1pur in Ratn\u00e1giri. In the same year (1674) Moro Pandit, a Mar\u00e1tha general, took up his quarters in Kaly\u00e1n and called on the Portuguese to pay a chauth or twenty-five per cent tribute for Bassein.\n\nOf the state of the district between 1673 and 1675, Fryer has left several interesting details. Under the great Gerald Aungier, the English were founding a marine, fortifying Bombay, bringing the settlement into order, and making the island an asylum for traders and craftsmen; but trade was small and the climate was deadly. In S\u00e1lsette and Bassein the Portuguese were 'effeminated in courage'; they kept their lands only because they lived among mean-spirited neighbours. Still S\u00e1lsette was rich, with pleasant villages and country seats, the ground excellent either of itself or by the care of its inhabitants, yielding fine cabbages, coleworts and radishes, garden fruit, 'uncomparable' water-melons, and onions as sweet and well-tasted as an apple. S\u00e1lsette supplied with provisions not only the adjoining islands but Goa also. Every half mile, along the Bassein creek from Th\u00e1na to Bassein, were 'delicate' country mansions. In B\u00e1ndra the Jesuits lived in a great college with much splendour. Rural churches were scattered over the island, and Th\u00e1na and B\u00e1ndra were considerable towns. Bassein was a great city with six churches, four convents, and two colleges, and stately dwellings graced with covered balconies and large two-storied windows. The land was plain and fruitful in sugarcane, rice, and other grain. Much of it had lately been destroyed by the Arabs of Maskat, who, without resistance, often set fire to the Portuguese villages, carried off their gentry into slavery, butchered their priests, and robbed their churches. Every year the Portuguese had a 'lusty' squadron at sea, but no sooner was the squadron passed than the Arabs landed and worked mischief.\n\nOn his way to Junnar in Poona, in April 1675, Fryer found, on both sides of the Kaly\u00e1n river, stately villages and dwellings of\n\n---\n\n1 Anderson's English in Western India, 77.\n2 Fryer's New Account, 65-70.

Frag. 220.\n4 New Account, 70-73.\n5 Fryer's New Account, 75. Orme (Hist. Frag. 46) states that the Arabs numbered 600, fewer than the Bassein garrison, but the garrison remained panic-struck within their walls. This pusillanimity, adds Orme, exposed them to the contempt of all their neighbours. In 1670 the Arabs had seized and sacked Din. Hamilton's New Account, I. 139. In 1674, according to Chardin, the Arabs were routed at Daman. Orme's Hist. Frag. 218.\nPortuguese nobles, till, on the right, about a mile from Kaly\u00e1n, they yielded to Shiv\u00e1ji. Kaly\u00e1n was destroyed by the fury of the Portugals, afterwards of the Moghal, then of Shiv\u00e1ji, and now lately of the Moghal whose flames were hardly extinguished. By these incursions the town was so ruined that the houses were mean kennels and the people beggars. Titv\u00e1la, seven miles east, across rocky barren and parched ways, was, like Kaly\u00e1n, reeking in ashes. The Moghals laid waste all in their road, both villages, fodder, and corn, carrying off cattle and women and children for slaves, and burning the woods so that runaways might have no shelter. Then the way led across some better country, with arable grounds, heaths, and forests, some of them on fire for two or three miles together. In the poor village of Murb\u00e1d, where Fryer next stopped, the people had no provisions. Though several villages were in sight and the people greedy enough to take money, with diligent search and much ado, only one hen was found. All the land was ploughed, but Shiv\u00e1ji coming reaped the harvest, leaving the tillers hardly enough to keep body and soul together. From Murb\u00e1d the path led over hilly, but none of the worst ways, across burnt grass-lands; then over a fine meadow checkered with brooks and thriving villages, to the foot of the hills, to Dehir (Dhasai), a garrison town of Shiv\u00e1ji's, where he stabled his choicest horses. Here all were in arms, not suffering their women to stir out of the town. The town was crowded with people miserably poor. The garrison was a ragged regiment, their weapons more a cause of laughter than of terror.\n\nOn his return from Junnar (May 24th), Fryer came by the N\u00e1na pass through Murb\u00e1d and Barfta, perhaps Barvi about three miles north-east of Kaly\u00e1n. The misery of the people seems to have struck him even more than on his way inland. His bearers could buy nothing, the people being 'harried out of their wits,' mistrusting their own countrymen as well as strangers, living as it were wildly, betaking themselves to the thickets and wildernesses among the hills upon the approach of any new face. At Barfta the 'Coombies or woodmen,' who lived in beehive-like huts lined with broad teak leaves, were not strong enough to aid their herds against the devouring jaws of wild beasts. Fires had to be kept up, lest the horse might 'lose one of his quarters or the oxen serve the wild beasts for a supper.' A strict watch was added, whose mutual answerings in a high tone were deafened by the roaring of tigers, the cries of jackals, and the yellings of baloos or overgrown wolves. The poor Coombies were all so harassed that they dared not till the ground, never expecting to reap what they sowed. Nor did they remain in their houses, but sought lurking places in deserts and caverns. So obvious were the hardships that Fryer's bearers often reflected on their own happiness under English rule.\n\nDuring these years (1673-1677) the relations of the English and Portuguese were still unfriendly. Enraged at the refusal of the Deputy Governor to give up a Malab\u00e1r ship that had sought refuge\n\n---\n\n1 Fryer's New Account, 124.\n2 Fryer's New Account, 127.\n3 Fryer's New Account, 142.\nin Bombay, the Portuguese General Manuel de Saldanha raised a force of 1200 men and marched against Bombay. But, on finding that this display of strength had no effect, he beat a retreat. Shortly after some Portuguese priests were found in Bombay, stirring up the Portuguese residents against the English, and an order was issued requiring \u2018all vagabond Padres\u2019 to leave the island. The Portuguese authorities continued to starve Bombay, forbidding the export of rice from Bandra and placing an almost prohibitive duty on fruits, vegetables, and fowls. They tried to levy a ten per cent duty on all supplies passing Th\u00e1na and Karanja on their way to Bombay, but this the English steadily resisted.\n\nIn 1675 Shiv\u00e1ji drove the Moghals from their Th\u00e1na possessions, and, passing west along the T\u00e1nsa, began to fortify opposite the Portuguese town of S\u00e1iv\u00e1n (Sibon). This produced some \u2018slender hostilities,\u2019 but the work went on. In the following year Shiv\u00e1ji sent a force to P\u00e1rnera in the south of Surat, and repaired and garrisoned the fort. In 1678 Shiv\u00e1ji tried to burn the Musalm\u00e1n boats in Bombay harbour. Failing in his first attempt he went back to Kaly\u00e1n and tried to cross to Th\u00e1na, but was stopped by Portuguese boats. In the same year the N\u00e1gothna river was the scene of a struggle between some English troops from Bombay and Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s general. In October 1679, to guard the southern shores of Bombay harbour against the Sidi\u2019s raids, Shiv\u00e1ji took possession of the small rocky island of Kh\u00e1nderi or Kenery at the mouth of the harbour. This island was claimed both by the Portuguese and by the English, but it had been neglected as it was supposed to have no fresh water. On its capture by Shiv\u00e1ji the English and Sidis attempted to turn out the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The English sent an aged captain, or according to another account a drunk lieutenant, in a small vessel to find out what the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s meant by landing on the island. The officer was induced to land, and he and his crew were cut off. The Revenge, a pink, and seven native craft were ordered to lie at anchor and block all approach to the rock. On this, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacked the English fleet, took one grab, and put to flight all except the Revenge. The little man-of-war was commanded by Captain Minchin, and the gallant Captain Keigwin was with him as Commodore. These officers allowed the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to board, and then, sweeping the decks with their great guns, destroyed some hundreds, sunk four of the enemy\u2019s vessels, and put the rest to flight. In spite of this success the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s\n\n---\n\n1 Bruce\u2019s Annals, II. 392; Anderson\u2019s English in Western India, 86.

In 1675 (May 25th) Fryer found at Kaly\u00e1n \u2018a pragmatical Portugal who had fled to this place for designing the death of a fidalgo. He was about to accept the pay of Shiv\u00e1ji, and was marching at the head of forty men. He was a bold desperate fellow, a rich lout, no gentleman, a fit instrument to ruin his nation.\u2019 New Account, 144.\n\n3 Orme\u2019s Hist. Frag. 55.\n\n4 Nairne\u2019s Konkan, 67.\ncontinued to hold Kh\u00e1nderi. Soon after (9th January 1680), as a counter movement, Sidi K\u00e1sim entrenched himself on Underi or Henery rock, about two miles to the east of Kh\u00e1nderi, and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in vain tried to drive him out. The possession of these islands by enemies, or, at best, by doubtful friends, imperilled Bombay. The Deputy Governor prayed the Court for leave to expel them. In reply he was censured for not having called out the Company\u2019s ships and prevented the capture. But, owing to want of funds and the depressed state of trade, he was ordered to make no attempt to recover the islands, and was advised to avoid interference in all wars between Indian powers. An agreement was accordingly made acquiescing in Shiv\u00e1ji\u2019s possession of Kh\u00e1nderi.\n\nOn the death of Shiv\u00e1ji on the 5th of April 1680, Sambh\u00e1ji, his son and successor, by supporting the Emperor\u2019s rebel son Sult\u00e1n Akbar, brought on himself the anger of Aurangzeb. In the fights that followed between the Sidis and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s the shores of the Bombay harbour were often ravaged. The English in Bombay were in constant alarm, as, from ill-advised reductions, they had only one armed ship and less than a hundred Europeans in the garrison. In 1682 a Moghal army came from Junnar to Kaly\u00e1n. The Portuguese had before this lost their hold of Shab\u00e1z or Bel\u00e1pur near Panvel, as the Sidi is mentioned as building a fort at Bel\u00e1pur to guard it against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. After the rains the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Sidis again fought in Bombay harbour, and Sambh\u00e1ji is mentioned as preparing to fortify the island of Elephanta and as ordering his admiral Daulat-Kh\u00e1n to invade Bombay, where the militia were embodied and 3000 of Aurangzeb\u2019s troops were landed at M\u00e1zgaon to help in the defence. In 1683 the Moghals ravaged Kaly\u00e1n, and the Portuguese fought with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Sambh\u00e1ji, who was repulsed before Chaul, seized the island of Karanja and plundered some places north of Bassein. In consequence of the capture of Bantam by the Dutch, Bombay was made the head English station in the East Indies, forty European recruits were sent, and 200 Rajputs ordered to be enrolled. At the close of the year Captain Keigwin, the commandant of the Bombay garrison, enraged by continued reductions in pay and privileges, revolted from the Company, seized and confined the Deputy Governor, and, with the concurrence of the garrison and the people of the island, declared that the island was under the King\u2019s protection. Mr. Child, the President, came from Surat to Bombay, but, failing to arouse any feeling in favour of the Company, returned to Surat. The revolt continued till October 1684, when Sir Thomas Grantham, a King\u2019s officer and Vice-Admiral of the Indian fleet, arrived from England, and coming to Bombay in November 1684, landed without attendants, and persuaded Keigwin to give up the island and retire to England. Keigwin had ruled with honesty and success. He made a favourable\n\n---\n\n1 Bruce\u2019s Annals, II. 447-448; Anderson\u2019s English in Western India, 82; Low\u2019s Indian Navy, I. 65-69.\n2 Nairne\u2019s Konkan, 74; Bruce\u2019s Annals, II. 489.\n3 Nairne\u2019s Konkan, 74; Bruce\u2019s Annals, II. 60.\n4 Bruce\u2019s Annals, II. 512-541; Anderson\u2019s English in Western India, 105.\ntreaty with Sambh\u00e1ji and repressed the Sidi, forbidding him to come to M\u00e1zgaon except for water. He claimed, perhaps with justice, that his vigorous management had saved the island from falling into the hands either of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s or of the Moghals. In 1684 Kaly\u00e1n was again ravaged by the Moghals. The war between the Portuguese and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was renewed, the Portuguese retaking Karanja, Santa Cruz opposite Kaly\u00e1n, and the great hill-fort of Asheri. Sambh\u00e1ji in return ravaged the Portuguese territory and invested Bassein.\n\nIn 1687, under the influence of Sir Josiah Child, the Court of Directors, disgusted with the uncertain nature of their trading privileges in Surat and in Bengal, full of admiration for the Dutch system of independent and self-supporting centres of trade, and encouraged by the support they received from the Crown, determined to shake off their submission to the Moghal, to raise their leading Indian factories to be Regencies, to strengthen them so that they could not be taken by native attack, and to use their power at sea as a means of preventing Aurangzeb from interfering with their trade. With this object independent settlements were to be established at Bombay, Madras, and Chittagong. Bombay was to be the chief seat of power, as strong as art and money could make it, and S\u00e1lsette was to be seized and garrisoned. Mr., now Sir John, Child, the brother of Sir Josiah Child, was appointed Captain General and Admiral of the Company's forces by sea and land. He was directed to leave Surat and establish his head-quarters in Bombay, to make an alliance with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and to seize as many Moghal ships as he could; until the independence of the Company's stations was acknowledged. With this object a strong force both in ships and men was sent to Chittagong and to Bombay. These schemes and preparations failed. In Bengal, hostilities were begun before the whole force arrived; they were prosecuted with little success, and agreements were hurriedly patched up on the old basis of dependence on the Moghal. In the west matters went still worse. Sir John Child issued orders for the capture of Moghal ships while Mr. Harris and the other factors were still at Surat. With these hostages there was no chance that the fear of the destruction of the Moghal sea-trade would induce Aurangzeb to admit the independence of the English settlements. Aurangzeb at this time, besides his successes against Sambh\u00e1ji, had reduced both Bij\u00e1pur and Golconda. The attempt to wring concessions from him was hopeless and had to be given up, and envoys were sent to Bij\u00e1pur to negotiate a peace and regain the former privileges. In the midst of these disappointments and failures Sir John Child died in Bombay on the 4th of February 1690.\n\nOn the 27th of February 1690 Aurangzeb passed an order granting the English leave to trade. The terms of this order were humiliating. The English had to admit their fault, crave pardon, pay a heavy fine, promise that they would go back to their old position of simple traders, and dismiss Child 'the origin of all the\n\n---\n\n1 Nairne's Konkan, 74; Bruce's Annals, II. 498.\n2 Nairne's Konkan, 75.\n3 Orme's Hist.

Before this pardon was granted (14th February 1689) the Sidi fleet and army had invaded Bombay, gained possession of Mahim, Mazgaon, and Sion, and held the Governor and the garrison as if besieged in the town and castle. The treaty with the English contained an order to the Sidi to withdraw from Bombay. But the English did not regain possession of Mazgaon, Mahim, and Sion, till the 22nd of June 1690. So weak were the defences of the island and so powerless was the garrison, reduced by pestilence to thirty-five English, that, in Mr. Harris' opinion, if it had not been for the jealousy of Mukhtyar Khan the Moghal general, the Sidi might have conquered the island. This foolhardy and ill-managed attempt of the Childs to raise the Company to the position of an independent power is said to have cost the Company \u00a3416,000 (Rs. 41,60,000). During the decline of Maratha vigour, that followed the capture and death of Sambhaji, the Moghals overran most of the North Konkan. In 1689 they made several inroads into Portuguese territory, plundering small towns and threatening Bassein. In 1690 a band of ruffians, under a leader named Kaka, came plundering close to Bassein, and two years later the Sidi attacked Bassein and threatened Salsette. In 1694 Aurangzeb declared war on the Portuguese, and his troops ravaged the country so cruelly that the people had to take shelter within the walls of Bassein and Daman. Fortunately for the Portuguese Aurangzeb was in want of cannon to use against the Marathas, and, on the promise of a supply, made a favourable treaty with the Portuguese. But there seemed neither rest nor security for the rich peace-loving Portuguese. No sooner were matters settled with Aurangzeb than bands of Maskat Arabs landed in Salsette, burnt the Portuguese villages and churches, killed their priests, and carried off 1400 prisoners into slavery. Next year the Portuguese were somewhat encouraged by, what was now an unusual event, a sea victory over the Marathas.\n\nBombay continued very depressed. In 1694 trade was in a miserable state; the revenue had fallen from \u00a35208 to \u00a31416 (Rs. 52,080 - Rs. 14,160), the cocoa-palms were almost totally neglected, and there were only a hundred Europeans in the garrison. In 1696 want of funds required a reduction of sixty Christians and\n\n---\n\n1 Bruce's Annals, II. 550-642.\n2 Bruce's Annals, III. 94. The Jesuits had been active in helping the Sidi.

The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Moors, Arabs, and Portuguese were ready to attack Bombay, and if reinforcements were not sent the island must be lost.\u00b3 In 1702 the safety of the island was threatened by the Portuguese stopping the supply of provisions for the garrison, and giving secret help to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Added to this the plague broke out in the island, carried off some hundreds of the natives, and reduced the Europeans to the small number of seventy-six men. The plague was followed by a storm which destroyed the produce of the island and wrecked the greater part of the shipping.\u2074 In 1705 matters were little better. The garrison was very weak, the Hindu companies were disbanded for neglect of duty, the Surat trade was at a stand, and the trade with the Malab\u00e1r coast was harassed by K\u00e1nhoji \u00c1ngria, a Shiv\u00e1ji, or Mar\u00e1tha robber.\u2075 In 1708 the king of Persia proposed to send an envoy to arrange with the English a joint attack on the Mar\u00e1tha and Arab pirates. But the Governor was forced to decline; Bombay was in no state to receive an envoy \u2018either by the appearance of its strength, or by having disposable shipping for the service solicited.\u2019\u2076 The \u2018Unfortunate Isle of the East\u2019 was plague-stricken, empty, and ruined. Of 800 Europeans only fifty were left, six civilians, six commissioned officers, and not quite forty English soldiers. There was only one horse fit to ride and one pair of oxen able to draw a coach.\u2077 Bombay that had been one of the pleasantest places in India was brought to be one of the most dismal deserts.\u2078\n\nBetween Aurangzeb\u2019s treaty with the Portuguese in 1694 and his death in 1708, with the coast strip under the Portuguese and Kaly\u00e1n under the Moghals, Th\u00e1na seems to have been freer from war and plunder than it had been for years. Of the parts under the Moghals no details have been traced. But, in spite of all they had suffered, the Portuguese lands were richly tilled, and the people, except the lowest classes, were well-to-do. According to the Musalm\u00e1n historian Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n,\u2079 Bassein and Daman were very strong and the villages round them were flourishing, yielding a very large revenue. The Portuguese tilled the skirts of the hills and grew the best crops, sugarcane, pine-apples, and rice, with gardens of cocoa-palms and vast numbers of betel vines. Unlike the English, they attacked no ships except ships that refused their passes, or Arab and Maskat vessels with which they were always at war. The greatest act of Portuguese tyranny was, that they taught and brought up as Christians the children of any of their Musalm\u00e1n or Hindu subjects.\n\n\u00b9 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 194; Anderson\u2019s English in Western India, 123.\n\u00b2 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 215.\n\u00b3 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 439.\n\u2074 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 502-503.\n\u2075 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 596-597.\n\u2076 Bruce\u2019s Annals, III. 652.\n\u2077 Anderson\u2019s English in Western India, 128, 163, 171-172.\n\u2078 Hamilton\u2019s New Account, I. 240.\n\u2079 Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n\u2019s Muntakhabu-l-Lub\u00e1b in Elliot and Dowson, VII, 211-212, and 345-346.

They built villages and in all matters acted with much kindness to the people, and did not vex them with oppressive taxes. They set apart a quarter for the Musalm\u00e1ns and appointed a k\u00e1zi to settle all matters of taxes and marriages. Only the call to prayer was not allowed. A poor traveller might pass through their territory and meet with no trouble, except that he would not be able to say his prayers at his ease. Their places of worship were very conspicuous with burning tapers of camphor and figures of the Lord Jesus and Mary, very gaudy in wood, wax, and paint. They were strict in stopping tobacco, and a traveller might not carry more than for his own use. When they married, the girl was given as the dowry. They left the management of all affairs in the house and out of the house to their wives. They had only one wife and concubines were not allowed.\n\nIn the beginning of 1695 the Italian traveller Gemelli Careri spent some time at Daman and Bassein, and in S\u00e1lsette. Daman was a fairly pretty town in the Italian style. It had three broad streets and four cross streets, lined with regular rows of one-storied tiled dwellings, with oyster-shell windows instead of glass, and each house with its garden of fruit-trees. There were several good monasteries and four modern bastions, well-built though ill-supplied with cannon. There was a good garrison, a captain, and a revenue factor. The people were Portuguese, half-castes or mestizos, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Hindus. Most of the Hindus lived in old Daman on the right bank of the river, a place of ill-planned streets and cottages, with mud walls and roofs thatched with palm-leaves. The Portuguese lived in great style, with slaves and palanquins. Out-of-doors they rode in coaches drawn by oxen. The food was not good. The beef and pork were ill-tasted, they seldom killed sheep, and everybody could not go to the price of fowls. Their bread was excellent, and native fruits and many European herbs were plentiful. Under their coats the men wore an odd sort of breeches called candales, which when tied left something like the tops of boots on the leg. Others wore a short doublet, and under the doublet wide silk breeches, and some let their breeches hang to their ankles serving as hose.\n\nT\u00e1rapur was well inhabited with monasteries of Dominicans and Recolets or Franciscans. At Bassein the fortifications were not finished. The people of fashion wore silk and thin muslins with long breeches to the heels, without stockings, and with sandals instead of shoes. A bride was richly dressed in the French fashion. For fifteen miles between Bassein and Cassabo, that is Ag\u00e1shi, was\n\n---\n\n1 Muntakhabu-l-Lub\u00e1b in Elliot and Dowson, VII. 345.\n2 Muntakhabu-l-Lub\u00e1b in Elliot and Dowson, VII. 211-212 and 345-346.\n3 Churchill's Voyages, IV. 185-200.\n4 The number of slaves varied from six to ten in a small establishment and from thirty to forty in a large establishment. They carried umbrellas and palanquins and did other menial work. They cost little to buy, fifteen to twenty Naples crowns, and scarcely anything to keep, only a dish of rice once a day. They were blacks brought by Portuguese ships from Africa. Some were sold in war, some by their parents, and others, in despair, barbarously sold themselves. Churchill's Voyages, IV. 203.\nnothing but delightful gardens planted with several sorts of country fruit-trees, as palms, figs, mangoes, and others with abundance of sugarcanes. The gardens were always green and fruitful, watered with engines. The gentry, tempted by the cool pleasant lanes, had all pleasure houses at Agashi, where they went in the hottest weather. About this time, besides the risk of slaughter by Pendh\u00e1ri freebooters and Maskat pirates, the people of Bassein were haunted by another form of sudden death. A plague, a pestilential disease called carazzo, exactly like a bubo, had for some years infested the north coast; cities were emptied in a few hours; Surat, Daman, Bassein, and Th\u00e1na had all suffered.\n\nS\u00e1lsette, the best part of which belonged to the Jesuits, was very rich yielding abundance of sugarcane, rice, and fruit. There were several villages of poor wretched Gentiles, Moors, and Christians living in wattle and daub houses covered with straw or palm-leaves. The peasants were worse than vassals to the lords of the villages. They were bound to till the land or to farm as much as might put them in a condition to pay the landlord. They fled like slaves from one village to another, and their landlords brought them back by force. Those who held from large proprietors paid their rent in grain, sometimes with the addition of personal service. Those who held direct from the state paid the Government factor or treasurer a monthly imposition according to what they were worth. The chief places in the island were B\u00e1ndra, Versova, and Th\u00e1na. Th\u00e1na stood in open country excellent good for India. It had three monasteries and a famous manufacture of calicoes.\n\nCareri makes no mention of the loss and havoc caused by recent raids and disturbances. But he tells of fierce fights at sea with the Maskat pirates, of the Malabars, pirates of several nations, Moors, Hindus, Jews, and Christians, who with a great number of boats full of men fell on all they met; and of Savaji, the mortal enemy of the Portuguese, so strong that he could fight both the Moghals and the Portuguese. He brought into the field fifty thousand horse and as many or more foot, much better soldiers than the Moghals, for they lived a whole day on a piece of dry bread while the Moghals marched at their ease, carrying their women and abundance of provision and tents, so that they seemed a moving city. Savaji\u2019s subjects were robbers by sea and by land. It was dangerous at any time to sail along their coast, and impossible without a large convoy. When a ship passed their forts, the Savajis ran out in small well-manned boats, and robbed friend and foe. This was the pay their king allowed them.\n\nDuring the first fifty years of the British possession of Bombay the trade of the Th\u00e1na coast shows a gradual falling off in all the\n\n---\n\n1 This plague devastated Upper India from 1617 to 1625.

Churchill, IV. 193.\nports except in Bombay. In Bombay between 1664 and 1684 'trade flourished and increased wonderfully.' This was the turning point in the modern history of the trade of the Th\u00e1na coast, when, as of old, it began to draw to itself the chief foreign commerce of Western India. Between 1684 and 1688 Bombay was the centre of English commerce with Western India. Then came the collapse and the years of deadly depression and of strife between the London and the English Companies, ending in 1702 in the formation of the New United Company.\n\nIn the beginning of the eighteenth century Hamilton enters on his map of the Th\u00e1na coast, Daman, Cape St. John, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, Bassein, Bombay, and Chaul. Besides these he mentions, between Daman and Bassein, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, M\u00e1him-Kellem or Kelva-M\u00e1him and the island of Vaccas or \u00c1g\u00e1shi, and between Bassein and Bombay, Versova, B\u00e1ndra, and M\u00e1him. Of these ports Daman, in former times a place of good trade, was reduced to poverty; D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, Kelva-M\u00e1him and the island of Vaccas were 'of small account in the table of trade;' Bassein was a place of small trade, its riches dead and buried in the churches; Versova was a small town driving a small trade in dry-fish; B\u00e1ndra was most conspicuous, but it had no trade as the mouth of the river was pestered with rocks; Bombay, as noticed above, had fallen very low. Trade was so bad that, according to Hamilton, in 1696 the Governor Sir John Gayer preferred a prison in Surat where he could employ his money, to Government house in Bombay where there was no chance of trade. Th\u00e1na, Kaly\u00e1n, and Panvel are passed over in silence. Chaul, once a noted place of trade, was miserably poor.\n\nNo details have been traced of the trade of Bombay at this period. Apparently vessels from Bombay occasionally traded to England, and to almost all the known Asiatic and east African ports. The following summary serves to show the character of the trade in which, a few years before, Bombay had played a considerable part, and in which, after a few years of almost complete effacement, it again acquired a large and growing share.\n\nOf Indian ports north of the Th\u00e1na coast, there were in Sindh, Tatta with a very large and rich trade; Cutchnagar apparently Cutchigad six miles north of Dw\u00e1rka; M\u00e1ngrol, and Pormain with considerable traffic; Diu, one of the best cities in India, but three-\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's New Account, I. 186.\n2 Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n, who seems to have visited Bombay before Child's troubles began, was much struck by its strength and richness. Inside of the fortress from the gate, on each side of the road, was a line of English youths of twelve or fourteen years, shouldering excellent muskets. At every step were young Englishmen with sprouting beards, handsome and well-clothed with fine muskets in their hands. Further on were Englishmen with long beards alike in age, accoutrements, and dress. Further on were Englishmen with white beards, clothed in brocade, with muskets on their shoulders, drawn up in two ranks in perfect array. Next were some English children, handsome and wearing pearls on the borders of their hats. Altogether there must have been nearly seven thousand musketeers, dressed and armed as for a review. Elliot and Dowson, VII. 351-352.\n3 Hamilton's knowledge of this coast lasted over about forty years from about 1680 to 1720.\n4 Hamilton's New Account, I. 179, 243.\nfourths empty; Gogha, a pretty large town with some trade; Cambay, a large city, a place of good trade; Broach, famous for its fine cloth and for its cotton \u2018the best in the world\u2019; Surat, a great city with a very considerable trade \u2018in spite of convulsions\u2019; Navsari, with a good manufacture of coarse and fine cloth; and Gandevi, with excellent teak exported and used in building houses and ships.\n\nSouth of Chaul to Goa the coast towns were small and poor, empty and tradeless, the coast harassed by pirates. Even Goa had little trade except in palm-juice arrack, which was bought yearly in great quantities by the English for punch. Between Goa and Cape Comorin, Karwar, Honavar, and Bhatkal had a good trade. Mangalore was the greatest mart in Kanara, and Kannanur, Kaliyat, and Kochin were all centres of considerable commerce. On the east coast Fort St. David was one of the most prosperous places; Madras was a well-peopled colony, and Masulipatam, Calcutta, and Hugli were great centres of trade.\n\nIn the Persian Gulf, on the east coast, were Gombroon with English and Dutch factories and a good trade, Cong with a small trade, Bushire with a pretty good trade, and Bassora and Bagdad great cities much depressed by a pestilence and by the conquest of the Turks. On the west of the gulf, Maskat was strongly fortified and well supplied with merchandise. On the east coast of Arabia were Kuria-Muria, Doffar, and Kassin, inhospitable ports with a dislike of strangers and only a small trade. Aden was a place of little commerce. Its trade had passed to Mocha, the port of the great inland city of Sunan, with English and Dutch factories. Of the Red Sea marts, Jidda on the east coast and Massua on the west coast were the most important. On the east coast of Africa, Magadoxo, Patta, Mombas, and Mozambique had little trade with India, partly because of the English pirates of Mozambique and partly because the coast as far south as Mombassa had lately (1692-1698) passed from the Portuguese to the Imam of Maskat. South of Mombassa there was little trade except some Portuguese traffic with Sena and some British dealing with Natal. Passing east, by the south of India, the rich trade of Ceylon was almost entirely in the hands of the Dutch and the English. On the east coast of the Bay of Bengal the chief places of trade were Chittagong, Arrakan, Syrian the only open port in Pegu, whose glory was laid in the dust by late wars with Siam and by its conquest by Burmah. Further east were Merji and Tenasserim, Malacca under the Dutch apparently with much lessened trade, Achin in Sumatra a rich and important mart for Indian goods, and Bencolin also in Sumatra with an English colony. The rich spice trade of Java and Borneo was in the hands of the Dutch. Siam and Cambodia were rich and were anxious to trade with the English. Cochin-China\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton mentions Danda-Rajpuri or Janjira, Zeferdon or Shrivardhan in Janjira, Dabhol, Rajapur, Gheria, Malvan, and Vengurla.

In China, 'the richest and best governed empire in the world,' the chief places where the English traded were Canton, Amoy, and Souchou. Amoy at the beginning of the eighteenth century was a great centre of English trade, but it was closed some years later by order of the Emperor. Japan in 1655 had risen on the Portuguese and killed the Christians, and the Dutch had taken advantage of Charles II.'s marriage with the Infanta of Portugal to persuade the Japanese to forbid the English to trade.\n\nThe trade between Bombay and other Th\u00e1na ports was chiefly in grain, vegetables, fruit, fowls, and mutton for the Bombay market, and in teak from Bassein for house and ship building. This local trade was much hampered by the demands of the Portuguese and by taxes in Bombay. The barrier of customs-houses, English Portuguese and Mar\u00e1thi, and the disturbed state of the Deccan prevented any considerable inland trade. Gujar\u00e1t chiefly exported corn, cloth, and cotton, and the K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r ports yielded cotton, corn, cloth, pulse, and butter, and took pepper, sugar, and betelnut. From the South Konkan ports almost the only exports were cattle from Janjira and arrack from Goa. The K\u00e1nara ports yielded teak and poon timber, and the Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r coast rice, sandalwood, pepper, betelnuts, and plenty of iron and steel. The east Madras ports yielded diamonds, the best tobacco in India, and beautiful chintz, and Calcutta and Hugli yielded saltpetre, piecegoods, silk, and opium.\n\nOutside of India the ports in the Persian Gulf took Indian cloth and timber, and European broadcloth and hardware; they exported dates, rose-water, honey, and dry-fish. The east Arab ports took coarse calicoes, and exported myrrh, olibanum, frankincense, pearls, horses, and a red resin. Aden exported horses, finely shaped and mettlesome but very dear \u00a350 or \u00a360 being thought a small price for one. Mokha exported coffee, myrrh, and frankincense; Socotra exported aloes, and the Abyssinian ports low-gold, ivory, slaves, coffee, and ostrich feathers. The only dealings with the East African ports was a little Portuguese traffic in gold with Sena, and a British traffic in ivory with Natal. Ceylon was famous for its cinnamon, emeralds, sapphires, and cats-eyes. Syrian in Pegu imported Indian goods, European hats, and silver and lead which passed for money; it exported timber, ivory, lac, iron, tin, earth-oil, rubies, and diamonds. Achin and Bencolin in Sum\u00e1tra took large quantities of Indian goods, and exported fine gold-dust and ivory. Si\u00e1m had timber and agala wood. Cambodia had ivory, stick-lac, gum, and raw silk. Tonquin was rich in gold and copper, abundance of raw silk, lacquered ware, and coarse porcelain; the Chinese ports took putchoc from Cutch as incense, and exported gold, copper, raw and wrought silks, lacquered ware, porcelain, tea, and rhubarb.

The exports were indigo, pepper, coffee, drugs, cotton-wool, cloth, cotton, myrrh, aloes, saltpetre, bock-muslins, and dori\u00e1s.\n\nAmong the Bombay merchants, the number of English, both in the Company's service and as private traders, had increased. The other merchants were chiefly Armenians, Hindus, and Musalm\u00e1ns. As in former times, Hindu traders were settled at great distances from India. In 1669, among the schemes for increasing the population of Bombay was one for tempting Persian Banians to settle in the Island. About 1700, at Bandar Ab\u00e1s the Banians were strong enough and rich enough to prevent the slaughter of cattle by paying a fine. Banians were also settled at Cong and Bassora, and at Mokha.\n\nSome of the ships used by the English were of great size. Hamilton was at one time in command of a vessel that drew twenty-one feet. The native merchants had also large fleets of fine vessels. One Muhammadan merchant of Surat had a fleet of twenty sail varying from 200 to 800 tons. English captains were in much request with the Moghals of India, who gave them handsome salaries and other indulgences.\n\nThe sea seems to have been specially troubled with pirates. The most dangerous were the Europeans, of whom Captains Every, Kidd, and Green were the most notorious. Hamilton notices two nests of European pirates, near Madagascar and on the east coast of the Bay of Bengal. Next to the European pirates the most formidable were the Maskat Arabs, who sometimes with fleets of as many as 1500 men scoured the west coast of India. Along the west coast of India were many nests of pirates, of which the chief were the Sanganiyas on the north coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1war, the Warels of Chh\u00e1ni on the south coast, the Sidis, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Angri\u00e1s and S\u00e1vants in the Konkan, and the pirates of Porka on the Mal\u00e1b\u00e1r coast.\n\nAfter the union of the London and the English Companies in 1708, Bombay began to recover from its deep depression.

The Town Wall was finished in 1716, and the Cathedral was begun in November 1715 and finished in 1718. In all other parts of Th\u00e1na, the death of Aurangzeb was the beginning of fresh struggles and loss. The release of Sh\u00e1hn, which happened soon after Aurangzeb\u2019s death, caused a division among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and, in the struggles between the heads of the state, \u00c1ngria made himself nearly independent, and spread his power over the south of Th\u00e1na as far east as the R\u00e1jma\u010di fort near the Bor pass and as far north as Bhiwandi. The coast districts suffered more than ever from the raids of Arab pirates. Four times between 1712 and 1720 they fought the Portuguese fleet which they formerly used carefully to avoid.\n\nAbout this time (1713) B\u00e1la\u00ed Vishvan\u00e1th, a Chitp\u00e1van Br\u00e1hman of Shrivardhan near B\u00e1ukot, rose to be the leading adviser of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra branch of the Mar\u00e1tha state. His power was increased by the formal withdrawal of the Moghals from the Konkan in 1720, and by the settlement of the dispute between the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra and the Kolhapur branches of the house of Shiv\u00e1ji in 1730. Between 1713 and 1727 \u00c1ngria\u2019s power was at its highest. On several occasions, in 1717, 1719, 1720, and 1722, the English from Bombay, sometimes alone sometimes with the Portuguese, attacked Vijaydurg, Kh\u00e1nderi, and Kol\u00e1ba, but never with success.\n\nAbout 1720 the relations between the Portuguese and the English were more than usually strained. The Bombay Government found that the Portuguese priests were stirring up their people, who numbered about 5000 or one-third of the population of the island, against the English. They accordingly resolved, that instead of the Viceroy of Goa appointing the priests, the congregations should choose their priests, and that the priest chosen by the people should be nominated by the Bombay Government. Enraged at this change the Portuguese General of the North forbade the transport of provisions to Bombay, and seized English craft in the M\u00e1him river. Governor Boone retaliated (5th July 1720) by proclaiming the lands of all absentee Portuguese confiscated to Government, and among other properties Parel was taken from the Jesuits and made a Government House. The British messengers who were sent to B\u00e1ndra to make the proclamation were seized, carried to Th\u00e1na in irons, and there hoisted on a gibbet. On their return, sound in limb \u2018but very sore and mighty terrified,\u2019 a small body of British troops was sent to M\u00e1him.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Quar. Rev.

Two years later some Portuguese, found contrary to agreement repairing a fort apparently at Kurla, were attacked and driven off with the loss of twenty or thirty lives.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1727 the Portuguese made some efforts to check the decay of their power. An officer was sent to examine the defences of their Th\u00e1na possessions and suggest reforms, and a scheme was started for buying back the island of Bombay. The officer sent to examine the defences found the management most loose and corrupt.\\(^2\\) There was no systematic defence. The militia was in confusion. There was no discipline: some were called captains and some corporals, but all were heads. Of the troops of horse, the Daman troop was never more than forty strong, and the Bassein troop never more than eight. So weak were they that the infantry had to go into the field while the horse stayed in the fort, the troopers being filled with vices and the horses full of disease from want of exercise.\\(^3\\)\n\nBassein had ninety pieces of artillery from three to twenty-four pounders. The garrison was eighty men, almost all natives, many of them sick or past work. Of twelve artillerymen five were useless. There was no discipline. If it was hot or if it was wet, the men on guard left their posts and took shelter in some neighbouring house. The walls were ruined in many places, and, towards the sea side, a sand-hill rose as high as the curtain of the wall. Some rice dams had turned the force of the tide on to the north wall and endangered it. The country between Bassein and Ag\u00e1sha was green, fertile, and well-wooded, the gem of the province. But the creek which used to guard it on the land side had been allowed to silt, and in places might be crossed dry-shod. The hill of Nilla, Nil Dungri about two miles east of Sop\u00e1ra, had been fortified without the help of an engineer. The bastions were so small that there was no room to work a four-pounder gun. At Sop\u00e1ra, the great gap near Bolinj had been strengthened by a stockade, but the pillars were rotting and were hardly able to hold two cannon. The palm stockade at Sa\u00edv\u00e1n was so decayed that a few shots would bring it to the ground. Five companies of a nominal strength of 250 men guarded the Sa\u00edv\u00e1n villages. In the decay of honour the actual strength of each company was not more than ten or twelve men, and they were little better than thieves, fleecing their friends but never facing the foe. So thoroughly had they forgotten their drill that they could not even talk of it. Through K\u00e1man there was an easy entrance to S\u00e1lsette. It was deplorable to see so rich an island, with its seventy-one villages, supporting Bassein and great part of Goa, so utterly unguarded. It was open to attack from the Sidi, the English, or the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Hamilton's New Account, I. 182; Grose's Voyage, I. 46; Bom. Quar. Rev. III. 60-63. In 1722 there was also a customs dispute which led to blows. O Chron. de Tis. II. 34.\n\n\\(^2\\) The report is given in O. Chron. de Tis. I. 30-34, 50-53.\n\n\\(^3\\) O. Chron. de Tis. I. 29-35.\nAt Th\u00e1na, to guard the dry ford across the creek, there were to the south the towers of Sam Pedro and Sam Jeronimo, one with four soldiers and four guns, the other with two soldiers and two guns, and to the north was the Deis Magos with four soldiers and four pieces of artillery. These towers were of no use. They stopped the shipping, but could never stop an enemy. A royal fort should be built and the creek guarded. The Versova fort was small, ugly, old, and ruined. It had a garrison of fifty men and ten pieces of artillery, but only two of the pieces were serviceable. The fort at Shabaz, or Bel\u00e1pur, had four companies of 180 men, with fourteen guns from four to twelve pounders. On the Karanja island were 400 men able to carry arms. The fort on the plain had a garrison of fifty men, one artilleryman, and six one to six-pounder guns.\n\nIn the north, Manor was not worthy of the name of a fort, the wall in places being not more than six feet high. There was a garrison of 104 men, and eight guns of which five were useless. The magazine was bad and the bastions ruined. The captain took contracts for timber, and, neglecting his duty, employed his men in the menial work of hawling logs. There were 150 men on Asheri, but, as at Manor, they were timber-draggers rather than soldiers. All showed neglect and waste, many of the men being old and useless.\n\nThe Kelva-M\u00e1him fort was irregular and feeble. There was a garrison of sixty men, of whom seven were white; there were fifteen two to ten-pounder guns but no artillerymen. Many of the arms were unserviceable. There was also a stockade with a captain and thirty men, fourteen of whom had been sent to Santa Cruz opposite Kaly\u00e1n. At T\u00e1rapur were sixty men and twenty three to twelve-pounder guns. There were no artillerymen. Of the sixty men thirty were at Santa Cruz. Things seemed beyond cure. The abuses were so ingrained that they seemed natural. Besides there was no money and even were money spent and things put straight, unless there were more Europeans all would again go wrong. In the last twenty years decay had been most rapid.\n\nThe troops consisted of several small detachments, each on a different footing from the other. Three companies belonged to the army of Goa, six were flying companies, two belonged to the administration, and seven were of sepoys. Besides these, nine companies had lately been raised, but they had no pay and were fed by their captains. There ought to be a force of twenty companies, regular muster rolls, and pay certificates and better pay. Half the men should be white. The only power that was to be dreaded was the Mar\u00e1tha court. Friendly relations should be established with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Yearly presents would save many of the raids, which during the last thirteen years had ruined the miserable lands of Daman. The Portuguese nobles, as was originally the case, should be forced to build a moated fort or tower in each village and keep a body of twenty men able to carry arms.\n\nThis exposure was not in vain. A beautiful fort was begun at Th\u00e1na, and judging by the result a few years later, other leading\nfortifications were repaired and the garrisons strengthened and made more serviceable. As regards the scheme of buying back Bombay the Viceroy Jo\u00e3o de Saldanha da Gama, on the 18th of January 1727, sent the King a long report estimating what the purchase would cost and how the funds could be raised. The negotiations, or at least inquiries and calculations for the English do not seem to have been consulted, went on till the overthrow of the Portuguese in 1739.\n\nK\u00e1hoji\u2019s death in 1731 and the struggles that followed among his sons lessened the power of the \u00c1ngri\u00e1s. A few years later (1734), the death of Y\u00e1kub Kh\u00e1n and a disputed succession lowered the power of the Sidis, and in 1735 the Peshwa took many of his forts. The Konkanasth Br\u00e1hmans, now the first power in the Konkan, were able to turn their whole strength against the Portuguese, whom they hated as Christians and as strangers, and for whose ports and rich coast-lands they had long hungered. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s began to press the Portuguese. Year after year news reached Bombay that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had seized a fresh Portuguese fort, or appropriated the revenues of one more Portuguese district. In 1731 Th\u00e1na was threatened, and the Government of Bombay, who felt that the success of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s endangered their island, sent three hundred men to garrison Th\u00e1na, but soon after withdrew the aid.\n\nIn 1737, by siding with Sambh\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1ngria against the Peshwa\u2019s friend M\u00e1n\u00e1ji \u00c1ngria, the Portuguese gave the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s a pretext\n\n---\n\n1 Archivo Portuguez Oriental Fas. 6. Supplement New Goa, 1876, 287-292. The following are the chief details of the result of this inquiry: \u2018Bombay had two towns or kasb\u00e1s, Bombay and M\u00e1him; it had eight villages, M\u00e1gaon, Varli, Parel, Vad\u00e1lia (between Parel and M\u00e1tunga), N\u00e1gaoon (south of Vad\u00e1lia and north of Parel), M\u00e1tunga, Dh\u00e1rav\u00ed, and the island of Kol\u00eds or Kol\u00e1ba; it had seven hamlets, two Aivaris and Gauvari under Vad\u00e1lia; two, Bamanvali and Coltem? under Dh\u00e1rav\u00ed, and three, Bhoiv\u00e1da, Pomala, and Salgado under Parel; and it had five Koli quarters under Bombay, M\u00e1gaon, Varli, Parel, and Sion. There were three salt-pans, at Kauli north of M\u00e1tunga, Siwri, and Vad\u00e1lia. The estimated produce and revenue of the different parts of the island were, or the towns, Bombay 40,000 cocoapalms, some rice lands, and old rice-lands now built on, and M\u00e1him 70,000 cocoapalms and 592 mud\u00e1s of rice. Of the eight villages, M\u00e1gaon yielded 184 mud\u00e1s of rice and had 250 brah-palms, with a yearly revenue of about Xms. 4000; Varli 34 mud\u00e1s worth about Xms. 7000; Parel, including its three hamlets, 154 mud\u00e1s and some brah-palms yielding about Xms. 4000; Vad\u00e1lia, with its two hamlets, 75 mud\u00e1s and some brah-palms Xms. 1900; N\u00e1gaoon, 42 mud\u00e1s and some brah-palms Xms. 1000; M\u00e1tunga 65 mud\u00e1s and 100 brah-palms Xms. 1700; Sion, 54 mud\u00e1s and a few palms Xms. 1400; Dh\u00e1rav\u00ed, with two hamlets, 23 mud\u00e1s and a few brah-palms Xms. 625. Kol\u00e1ba worth Xms. 4000 to Xms. 5000. The salt-pans yielded Xms. 2300 and the Koli suburbs about Xms. 7000. There were two distilleries, bandh\u00e1rostis (?), at Bombay and at M\u00e1him. Of other sources of revenue the Bombay and M\u00e1him customs-houses yielded about Xms. 52,000, a tobacco tax Xms. 19,000, an excise Xms. 12,000, quit-rents Xms. 3000, and the M\u00e1him ferry Xms. 1200. The total was roughly estimated at Xms. 169,000. The fortifications of the island were, the castle with six bastions begun in 1716, well armed; a small fort on Dongri; a small bastion at M\u00e1gaon, with a sergeant and 24 men and 3 guns; Siwri fort on the shore, with a sub\u00e9dar and 50 sepoys and from 8 to 10 guns; the small tower and breastwork of Sion, with a captain and 62 men and nine or ten guns; three bastions at M\u00e1him, with 100 men and 30 guns; a fort on Varli hill, with an ensign and 25 men and seven or eight guns; the island of Patecas (Butcher\u2019s Island) belonging to M\u00e1gaon, with a fort, begun by General Boone in 1722, and about seventy seamen and six or seven guns.\n\n2 Grant Duff, 231-232.\n\n3 Bom. Quar. Rev, IV. 78.\nfor attacking them. The time favoured the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Goa was harassed by the Bhonsles, and \u00c1ngria\u2019s fleet was at the Peshwa\u2019s service. The first step taken by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was to attack the island fort of Arn\u00e1la, off the mouth of the Vaitarna. The fort was taken and the commandant and the garrison put to the sword. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s next (April 1737) attacked S\u00e1lsette, took Ghod-bandar and put the garrison to the sword, and, gaining command of the river, prevented help being sent from Bassein to Th\u00e1na.\n\nAt Th\u00e1na, though the fort was well advanced, the defences were unfinished. The captain fled to Karanja, and though the garrison made a gallant defence, successfully driving back two assaults, in the end they were forced to capitulate. The English sent men and ammunition to B\u00e1ndra, but the defences were useless and the place was abandoned, and fell to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s without a struggle. In 1738 the Portuguese made strenuous efforts to regain what they had lost. They defeated the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at Asheri, and a gallant attack on Th\u00e1na might have succeeded, had not the English warned the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s of the Portuguese preparations and supplied the garrison with powder and shot. In January 1739 Chimmaji \u00c1ppa, the Peshwa\u2019s brother, took command of the Mar\u00e1tha troops, and, in spite of obstinate resistance, captured most of the northern forts, Katalv\u00e1da, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, Kelve, Shrigaon, and T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, whose walls were scaled by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Portuguese \u2018fighting with the bravery of Europeans,\u2019 till they were overwhelmed by numbers. Versova and Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi in S\u00e1lsette, which still held out for the Portuguese, next surrendered, and the siege of Bassein was begun. The commandant of Bassein offered to pay tribute, but the offer was refused; he appealed to the English at first in vain, but he afterwards received from them a loan of \u00a31500 (Rs. 15,000). The siege was pressed with the greatest skill and perseverance, and \u00c1ngria\u2019s fleet blocked all hope of succour. Still, with the help of some Portuguese lately come from Europe, so gallant was the resistance, little less brilliant than the heroic defences of Diu and Chaul, that before Bassein was taken three months (17th February - 16th May) had passed and 5000 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were slain. The terms were honourable both to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and to the Portuguese. The garrison was allowed to march out with the honours of war, and those who wished to leave the country were granted eight days in which to collect their property. Most of the large landholders gave up their estates and\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Quar. Rev. III. 273.

The Mar\u00e1tha management of the siege greatly impressed the English. Gross (1750) wrote, \u2018The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, taught by European deserters, raised regular batteries, threw in bomb-shells, and proceeded by sap and mine.\u2019 (Voyage, I. 80). They paid the European gunners well, he says in another passage (79), but never let them leave, and in old age suffered them to linger in misery and poverty.\n5 Da Cunha\u2019s Chaul and Bassein, 149.\nsailed for Goa. Except five churches, four in Bassein and one in S\u00e1lsette, which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s general agreed to spare, every trace of Portuguese rule seemed fated to pass away. A high authority, Governor Duncan, in Regulation I. of 1803, traces the fall of the Portuguese to the unwise zeal of their priests and to their harsh treatment of their Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n subjects. Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n's statements, that the Portuguese treated their people kindly, and that, till the close of the seventeenth century, Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns continued to settle in Portuguese territory, prove that harshness and bigotry were not the causes of the fall of the Portuguese. The causes of their fall were that the Portuguese in Europe, careless of their Indian possessions, failed to keep the European garrison at its proper strength; that the officials in India, keen only to make money, let their defences fall to ruin; and that the hardy vigour of both gentry and priests had turned to softness and sloth. All rested in an empty trust in the name which their forefathers had left, wilfully blind to the law that to be rich and weak is to court attack and ruin.\n\nOn the fall of Bassein, the Government of Bombay sent boats to bring away the garrison. To the commandant the Bombay Government paid the attention which his courage and misfortunes deserved. They allowed his officers and about eight hundred of his men to remain on the island during the monsoon, and advanced a monthly allowance of four thousand rupees for their maintenance. Though most of the S\u00e1lsette gentry retired to Goa, many families took refuge in Bombay. It was melancholy, says Grose (1750), to see the Portuguese nobles reduced on a sudden from riches to beggary. Besides what they did publicly to help the Portuguese, the English showed much private generosity. One gentleman, John de Souza Ferras, was extremely pitied by the English. He had owned a considerable estate in S\u00e1lsette, and had endeared himself to the English by his kindness and hospitality. He continued many years in Bombay caressed and esteemed. At the close of the rains the Portuguese troops refused to leave Bombay, till their arrears were paid. This demand was met by the Bombay Government, who advanced a sum of \u00a35300 (Rs. 53,000). On the 29th of September the Portuguese were taken to Chaul in native vessels, under a Government convoy. The commandant and the Viceroy of Goa united in sending the Governor of Bombay the warmest acknowledgments of his kindness. But the sufferings of the Portuguese\n\n---\n\n1 Nairne's Konkan, 84.\n2 So also according to Grose [Voyage, I. 167 (1750)] the Portuguese cruelty had not a little share in determining the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to invade them.\n3 Elliot and Dowson, VII. 211-212, 345-346.\n4 The conduct of the British in refusing to help the Portuguese has been severely blamed (Nairne's Konkan, 83; Bom. Quar. Rev. IV. 82). Portuguese writers go so far as to state that the English supplied the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s with engineers and with bombs (Jo\u017e\u00e9 de Noronha, 1772, in O. Chron. de Tia. II. 16). According to Grose, who wrote in 1750, the reasons why the English did not help the Portuguese were, \"the foul practices of the Bandra Jesuits against the English interest in 1720, their remissness in failing to finish the Thana fort, and the danger of enraging the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, whose conduct of the war against the Portuguese deeply impressed the English. Voyage, I. 48-51.\n5 Bom. Quar. Rev. IV. 86-87.\n6 Grose's Voyage, I. 73.\ntroops were not over. From Chaul they marched by land, and, on the 15th of November, when within two hours march of shelter in Goa, they were attacked and routed by Khem S\u00e1vant with the loss of two hundred of their best men. The English Commodore saw the miserable remnant arrive in Goa with 'care and grief in every face.' As they were no longer able to hold them, the Portuguese offered the English Chaul and Korl\u00e1i fort on the south bank of the Chaul river. The English could not spare the men to garrison these places, but trusted that by ceding them to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s they would gain their regard, and might be able to arrange terms between the Portuguese and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Portuguese placed their interests in the hands of the English. The negotiation was entrusted to Captain Inchbird, and though the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at first demanded Daman and a share in the Goa customs, as well as Chaul, Inchbird succeeded in satisfying them with Chaul alone. Articles of peace were signed on the 14th of October 1740.\n\nExcept the island of Bombay, the wild north-east, and some groups of \u00c1ngria's villages in the south-east corner, of which, at his leisure he could take what parts were worth taking, the Peshwa was now ruler of the whole of Th\u00e1na. The change caused great uneasiness in Bombay. Soon after the fall of Bassein two envoys were sent to the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Captain Inchbird to treat with Chimn\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1ppa at Bassein, and Captain Gordon to conciliate the R\u00e1ja of S\u00e1t\u00e1ra in the Deccan. Bombay was little prepared to stand such an attack as had been made on Bassein. The town wall was only eleven feet high and could be easily breached by heavy ordnance; there was no ditch, and the trees and houses in front of the wall offered shelter to an attacking force. A ditch was promptly begun, the merchants opening their treasure and subscribing \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000) 'as much as could be expected in the low state of trade'; all Native troops were forced to take their turn at the work; gentlemen and civilians were provided with arms and encouraged to learn their use; half-castes or topazes were enlisted and their pay was raised; the embodying of a battalion of sepoys was discussed; and the costly and long-delayed work of clearing of its houses and trees a broad space round the town walls was begun. Though the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s scoffed at it, threatening to fill it with their slippers, it was the ditch that saved Bombay from attack.\n\nThe embassies were skilfully conducted and were successful. Captain Inchbird concluded a favourable treaty with Chimn\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1ppa, and Captain Gordon returned from the Deccan with the assurance that the leading Mar\u00e1tha chiefs admitted the value of English trade and would not molest Bombay. The feeling of security brought by these successful embassies soon passed away. When their fleet\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Quar. Rev. IV. 88.\n2 Bom. Quar. Rev. IV. 87-89.\n3 Bom. Quar. Rev.

III, 333-336.\nleft, convoying some merchantmen, \u00c1ngria became insolent, and news came of the gathering of a great Mar\u00e1tha force at Th\u00e1na. Alarm turned to panic. Numbers fled burying or carrying away their valuables. Should the fleet be sent to convoy merchantmen, or should trade be sacrificed and the fleet kept to guard the harbour? This dilemma was solved in a disastrous way for Bombay. On the 9th of November a frightful storm destroyed their three finest grabs, completely armed and equipped and commanded by three experienced captains. Instantly Sambh\u00e1ji \u00c1ngria appeared in the harbour, and carried away fourteen fishing boats and eighty-four of their crews. Remonstrance was vain, retaliation impossible.\n\nThe immediate danger passed over, but for nearly twenty years Bombay lived in fear and trembling. In 1750, Grose laments that the friendly, or, at worst, harmless belt of Portuguese territory that used to guard them from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s was gone. They were face to face with a power, unfriendly at heart, whose officers were always pressing the government to lead them to Bombay, and let them raze its wretched fort and pillage its markets. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were proverbially treacherous and unbindable by treaties, and since European deserters had taught them how to carry on sieges, they were very formidable enemies. It was Governor Bourchier's (1750-1760) chief claim to praise that he succeeded in keeping the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in good humour. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s knew that they gained much by European trade. But there was no trusting to their keeping this in mind. A change of ministers, a clamour for the sack of Bombay, a scheme to humour the troops, was enough to make them break their pledges of friendship even though they knew that the breach was against their interests. To all human appearance, Bombay ceased to be tolerable the instant the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s resolved on its conquest. Even could the fort hold out, it could be blockaded, and supplies cut off.\n\nGrose gives interesting particulars of these terrible Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, who had taken Th\u00e1na and Bassein, and who held Bombay in the hollow of their hands. Most of them were land-tillers called Kurumbis, of all shades from deep black to light brown, the hill-men fairer than the coast-men. They were clean-limbed and straight, some of them muscular and large bodied, but from their vegetable diet, light, easily overborne in battle both by Moors and by Europeans. Their features were regular, even delicate. They shaved the head except the top-knot and two side curls, which, showing from the helmet, gave them an unmanly look. The rest of their dress was mean, a roll of coarse muslin round the head, a bit of cloth round the middle, and a loose mantle on the shoulders also used as bedding. The officers did not much outfigure the men. To look at, no troops were so despicable. The men lived on rice and water carried in a leather bottle; the officers fared little better. Their pay was small, generally in rice, tobacco, salt, or clothes.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Quar. Rev. IV. 96-97. 2 Grose's Voyage, I. 44. 3 Grose's Voyage, I. 96.\nhorses were small but hardy, clever in rough roads, and needing little fodder. The men were armed with indifferent muskets mostly matchlocks. These they used in bush firing, retreating in haste to the main body when they had let them off. Their chief trust was in their swords and targets. Their swords were of admirable temper, and they were trained swordsmen. European broadswords they held in contempt. Their targets were light and round, swelling to a point and covered with a lacquer, so smooth and hard that it would turn aside a pistol shot, even a musket shot at a little distance. They were amazingly rapid and cunning. The English would have no chance with them. They might pillage Bombay any day.\n\nFortunately for Bombay the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s remained friendly until two events, the destruction of \u00c1ngria's power in 1757 and the crushing defeat of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s at P\u00e1nipat in 1761, raised the English to a position of comparative independence. In 1755 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and English made a joint expedition against \u00c1ngria. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s proved feeble and lukewarm allies, but the English fleet under Commodore James took the important coast forts of Suvardurg and B\u00e1nkot in the north of Ratn\u00e1giri. In 1757, strengthened by the presence of Admiral Watson and of Colonel Clive, the English attacked and took the great coast fort of Vijaydurg in Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\n---\n\n1 Grose's Voyage, I. 83. In spite of this Mar\u00e1tha thunder cloud, Bombay was advancing rapidly to wealth and importance. In 1753 (1st December) the Government wrote to the Court; 'The number of inhabitants has so greatly increased that the crowded people are murmuring to have the town enlarged. Some very considerable bankers from Aurangabad and Poona have opened shops to the great advantage of trade.' (Warden's Landed Tenures, 77). This increase in prosperity was partly due to very liberal instructions about attracting strangers to Bombay in a letter from the Court dated 15th March 1748. (See Bom. Quar. Rev. V. 164). Bombay was no longer the Britons' burying-ground. The climate was better or was better understood, and much greater pains were taken to keep the town clean (Bom. Quar. Rev. V. 168). The strong dyks at the Great Breach, which was greatly damaged by a storm in 1728 (Bom. Quar. Rev. III. 331), had been repaired and the sea kept out of a large tract in the centre of the island. Mild management and religious indifference, allowing Hindus, Musalm\u00e1ns, P\u00e1rs\u00eds, even Catholic Christians the free practice of their forms of worship, had tempted so many settlers that every inch of the island was tilled, and, in proportion to its size, yielded much more than S\u00e1lsette. Among the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Bombay had a perilously great name for wealth. Its noble harbour was the centre of trade between Western and Upper India and the Malabar coast, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. Its well-built though badly placed castle and its costly moat made it one of the strongest of the Company's Indian possessions. The military force was of three branches, Europeans, Natives, and a local militia. The Europeans were either sent from England or were Dutch French and Portuguese deserters, or they were topazes that is half-Portuguese. The sepoys had English officers, wore the Indian dress, and carried muskets, swords, and targets. They were faithful and with European help they were staunch. The local militia of land-fillers and palm-tappers would prove useful against an invader. Next to \u00c1ngria, perhaps equal to \u00c1ngria, the English were the first naval power on the west coast. They had succeeded to the old Portuguese position of granting passes to native craft.* Were it not for the English navy, the seas would swarm with pirates and no unarmed vessel could escape. The English navy consisted partly of beautifully modelled English-built galleys carrying eighteen to twenty guns, provided with oars, and specially useful in a calm. They had also a few grabs, modelled after \u00c1ngria's grabs, with prows best suited for carrying chase guns, and a competent number of galivats or row-boats. Large European ships were also occasionally stationed at Bombay. The marine was chiefly manned by English or European deserters and drafts from the land forces, Grose's Voyage, I. 40, 43, 48, 50.\n\n* Passes were granted by Child at least as early as 1687. Hamilton's New Account, I. 202, 216. The form of pass used in 1734 is printed in Bom.Quar.Rev.IV.188.\nburnt \u00c1ngria's fleet, and utterly destroyed his power.\\(^1\\) They were still so afraid of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s that the empty threat of an invasion of Bombay made the English break off a favourable agreement with Faris Kh\u00e1n at Surat.\\(^2\\) In the next year they gained command of Surat castle and became Admirals of the Moghal fleet. So encouraged were they with this success that, in 1760, they were bold enough to side with the Sidi against the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and to hoist the English flag at Janjira.\\(^3\\) The defeat of P\u00e1nipat in 1761, the death of the Peshwa B\u00e1j\u00e1li B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, and the succession of a minor, freed the British from present fear of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s.\\(^4\\) Before the year was over they were in treaty with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s for the cession of S\u00e1lsette and Bassein. Raghn\u00fan\u00e1thr\u00e1v the regent for M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v refused to cede S\u00e1lsette, but granted another important concession, the independence of the Sidi.\\(^5\\) In 1766 M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v had so far retrieved Mar\u00e1tha affairs, that he refused to listen to any proposal for the cession of S\u00e1lsette and the harbour islands.\\(^6\\)\n\nOn the conquest of Bassein in 1739 the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s introduced a regular and efficient government. Under the name of B\u00e1jipur or B\u00e1jir\u00e1v's city, Bassein was made the head-quarters of the governor or sarsubhed\u00e1r of the Konkan. Under the sarsubhed\u00e1r were district officers, styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs, whose charges generally yielded about \u00a350,000 (Rs. 5,00,000) a year; and who, besides managing the revenue, administered civil and criminal justice and police. Under the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were village headmen, or p\u00e1tils. In S\u00e1lsette the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s raised the land assessment and levied many fresh cesses. In spite of these extra levies the island was fairly prosperous, till, in 1761, on the death of B\u00e1jir\u00e1v, the system of farming the revenue was introduced. In Bassein grants were given to high-caste Hindus to tempt them to settle. The Native Christians were taxed and the proceeds spent in feeding Br\u00e1hmans to purify them and make them Hindus.\\(^7\\) In 1768 the district of Kaly\u00e1n, stretching from the Pen river to the Vaitarna, had 742 villages yielding a land revenue of \u00a345,000 (Rs. 4,50,000) and a customs revenue of \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000).\\(^8\\)\n\nAt the close of 1760 (November-December) the French scholar Anquetil du Perron made a journey from Surat to visit the Kanheri and \u00calephanta caves. Both in going and coming his route lay along the coast. He travelled in a palanquin with eight bearers, four armed sepoys, and a P\u00e1rsi servant. He was himself armed with a pair of pistols and a sword, and had two passports one for the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Details are given in Orme's History, I. 408, 417, and in Grose's Voyage, II. 214-227.

Throughout the whole of Th\u00e1na order seems to have been well established. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s found it difficult to protect their shores against pirates, but they were busy repairing and building forts. Both in going and in coming, Du Perron was free from the exactions either of highwaymen or of officials. Of the appearance of the country between Daman and S\u00e1lsette he gives few details, except that from N\u00e1rgol southwards, he occasionally mentions palm groves and notices the beautiful orchards of Ag\u00e1shi. There were Christians in several of the villages where he halted, and, though many of their churches and buildings were in ruins or in disrepair, some were in order, and, at Ag\u00e1shi, the road was full of Christians, going to church as freely as in a Christian land. With S\u00e1lsette he was much taken. It was no wonder that it had tempted the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and if only the English could get hold of it, Bombay would be one of the best settlements in the east. If well managed it would yield \u00a3240,000 (Rs. 24,00,000) a year. It was full of villages almost all Christian. There were several ruined churches and convents, and the European priests had left. But the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had allowed the Christians to keep some of their churches, and the native priests, under a native Vicar General, kept up the festivals of the church with as much pomp as at Goa. Their processions were made without the slightest danger, even with a certain respect on the part of the Hindus. A festival at Th\u00e1na in which Du Perron took part was attended by several thousand Christians. The Mar\u00e1tha chief of the island did not live in S\u00e1lsette, but on the mainland in a fort commanding Th\u00e1na. About the same time (1750) the traveller Tiefenthaler described the people of the inland parts of Th\u00e1na as a kind of savages brought up in thick forests, black and naked except a strip of cloth round the loins.\n\nMeanwhile, Bombay had been growing larger, richer, and healthier. In 1757 I've describes it as the most flourishing town in the world 'the grand store-house of all Arabian and Persian commerce.' In 1764 Niebuhr found the climate pleasant, the healthiness much improved since some ponds had been filled with earth. The products were rice, cocoanuts, and salt. The population had lately greatly increased. The old castle was not of much consequence, but the town was guarded on the land side by a good rampart, a large moat, and ravelins in front of the three gates. There were also towers at M\u00e1him, Riva north of Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi, Si\u00f3n, Suri, M\u00e1zgaon, and Varli. There were 300 native troops on the island, and, thanks to a Swiss, the artillery were in excellent order. The greatest work was the dock. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s still continued to treat the English with rudeness. In 1760 they carried off a Bombay cruiser. War seemed certain, but the English had sent a large number of troops to Calcutta and Madras, and they chose a friendly settlement. Another writer makes the population sixty thousand, and the sale of woollens and other English goods \u00a3140,000 (Rs. 14,00,000) a year. Still, he adds, the island\n\n---\n\n1 Three chief sets of pirates harassed the Th\u00e1na coasts at this time; the Sanganians from the gulf of Cutch, the Mask\u00e1t Arabs, and the Malab\u00e1ris.

In 1766 Forbes found the climate in general healthy and pleasant, though a considerable tract was overflowed by the sea. The merchants traded with all the principal seaports and interior cities of India, and extended their commerce to the Persian and Arabian gulfs, the coast of Africa, Malacca, China, and the eastern islands. The provision markets were well supplied from S\u00e1lsette and the mainland, and every spot that would admit of cultivation was sown with rice or planted with cocoa palms. The town was about two miles in circumference, surrounded by modern fortifications. There were three excellent docks and a spacious marine-yard, where teak ships of all sizes were made by skilful P\u00e1rsis, the exact imitators of the best European models. Of public buildings there were a Government house, customs-house, marine-house, barracks, mint, treasury, theatre, and prison. There were three hospitals, a Protestant church, and a charity school. The English houses were comfortable and well furnished, not yet deserted for country villas. The street in the black town contained many good Asiatic houses, kept by Indians especially by P\u00e1rsis. Bombay was one of the first marts in India, a place of great trade. The government was simple and regular, managed with order and propriety, but the revenue was always inadequate to the expenses. The outlay was seriously increased by the building of new fortifications in 1768. The Court of Directors and the Bombay Government agreed that, without the possession of some of the neighbouring lands, Bombay could not be held. The most suitable lands were S\u00e1lsette and Bassein, S\u00e1lsette for its rice and vegetables, Bassein for its timber. No chance of gaining these lands was to be allowed to pass. With this object a British envoy was sent to Poona in 1771. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s refused to cede any land and added 500 men to the Th\u00e1na garrison. In consequence of this refusal, knowing that the Portuguese had lately made vigorous reforms, and hearing that a fleet was on its way from Brazil to recover their late possessions, the Bombay Government determined to take S\u00e1lsette by force.\n\nOn the 12th of December, 120 European artillery, 200 artillery lascars, 500 European infantry, and 1000 sepoys, under the\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay in 1781, 6-7. Niebuhr (Voyage, II. 2) gives the population at 140,000, on the estimate of an Englishman who had been in Bombay twenty years. There had been 70,000 when he came, and since he had come the number was doubled. Sixty thousand is probably correct. The difference is probably partly due to the large section of the people who lived in Bombay only during the busy season. See below p. 516.\n\n2 Ship-building in Bombay dated from 1735, when Lavji Nasarv\u00e1nji came from Surat, and in the next year was sent to open a teak trade with the Bhils and other wild tribes of the forests to the north.

The force at Goa was 2240 infantry, 530 marines, 2000 natives, and 6000 sepoys. An army of 12,000 arrived from Brazil at Goa, and preparations were made to seize Bassein. (Chaul and Bassein, 130; Bombay in 1781, 73 footnote). The day after (13th December) the English sailed for Th\u00e1na, the Portuguese fleet entered Bombay harbour and protested. O. Chron. de Tis.

On the 28th, after a serious repulse, the fort was carried by assault and most of the garrison were put to the sword.\\(^1\\) A second British force took Versova, and a third occupied Karanja, Elephanta, and Hog Island.\\(^2\\) By the first of January 1775, S\u00e1lsette and its dependencies, including Bassein, were in the possession of the British. In his dispute with N\u00e1na Fadnavis as to the legitimacy of the child whom N\u00e1na had declared heir to the late Peshwa, Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v had been arrested and forced to retire to Gujar\u00e1t. On the 6th of March 1775, to obtain the help of the English, he agreed to a treaty, known as the treaty of Surat, under which S\u00e1lsette and Bassein were ceded to the English.\\(^3\\) Bassein was soon after restored, but S\u00e1lsette, Karanja, Hog Island, and Kh\u00e1nderi, which at the time of cession were estimated to yield a yearly revenue of \u00a335,000 (Rs. 3,50,000), were given over to the English.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn August 1775, Parsons found Bombay an elegant town with numerous and handsome gentlemen's houses, well laid out streets, and a clean sandy soil. The esplanade was very large, and as smooth and even as a bowling green. Inside of the walls was a spacious green where several regiments could drill. Bombay castle was very large and strong, and the works round the town were so many and the bastions so strong and well placed, and the whole defended with so broad and deep a ditch, that, with a sufficient garrison and provisions, it might bid defiance to any force. Its dry-dock was perhaps better, and its graving dock and rope-walk were as good as any in England. The ships built in Bombay were as strong, handsome, and well finished as any ships built in Europe.\\(^5\\)\n\nAt this time S\u00e1lsette is described as having good water and a fruitful soil, yielding chiefly rice, capable of great improvement, and formerly the granary of Goa. Karanja yielded rice to the yearly value of \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000) and Elephanta about \u00a3800 (Rs. 8000).\\(^6\\) In 1774 Forbes, on his way to the Kanheri caves, passed through a country of salt wastes, rice fields, cocoa groves, wooded hills, and rich vallies. The island was infested by tigers and was full of the ruins of Portuguese churches, convents, and villas.\\(^7\\)\n\nShortly after the cession (May, 1775) the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from Bassein\n\n---\n\n1 Forbes (Or. Mem. I. 452) says that the expedition against Th\u00e1na was in consequence of a treaty between the Select Committee of Bombay and Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v Peshwa, by which the islands were ceded to the British. But the first treaty with Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v was after, not before, the taking of Th\u00e1na.\n\n2 Forbes' Or. Mem. I. 453. In the fourteen years before the conquest of S\u00e1lsette the revenue of Bombay amounted to \u00a31,019,000 and the expenditure to \u00a33,974,000; it had cost the Company nearly three millions sterling. The details are given in Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. lii, liii, lviii.\n\n3 Bombay in 1781, 101-102.\n\n4 Aitchison's Treaties, V. 21-28. The Portuguese objected strongly to the action of the English in seizing S\u00e1lsette. The correspondence continued till 1780, when Mr. Hornby showed that the English Government had both justice and technical right in their favour. To this letter the Goa government were unable to answer. But representations through the court of Lisbon to the English Government were more successful. A despatch came out denouncing the conquest of S\u00e1lsette as unseasonable, impolitic, unjust, and unauthorised, and advising the Bombay Government to cancel the treaty. But the cession had long been formally confirmed and no action was taken. Chaul and Bassein, 156.\n\n5 Parsons' Travels, 214-217.\n\n6 Bombay in 1781, 2, 3.\n\n7 Forbes' Or.

In October he marched up the Bor pass, but was driven out of the Deccan, and, seeking shelter with \u00c1ngria, was made prisoner, and the Konkan speedily reduced to order.\\(^3\\)\n\nMeanwhile the English Government in Calcutta, which had lately been made Supreme, disapproved of the support given to Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v, declared the treaty of Surat invalid, and sent their agent Colonel Upton to Poona to negotiate with the ministerial party. Under the terms of a treaty dated at Purandhar, near Poona, on the 1st of March 1776, it was agreed that an alliance between the British and the ministerial party should take the place of the alliance between the British and Raghun\u00e1thr\u00e1v or R\u00e1ghoba. At the same time the British were to continue in possession of S\u00e1lsette, Karanja, Elephanta, and Hog Island.\\(^4\\) In spite of this treaty, the feeling of the ruling party at Poona of which N\u00e1na Fadnavis was the head, was strongly hostile to the English. When news arrived that war between England and France was imminent, N\u00e1na determined to make use of the French to lower the power of the English. In April 1778, St. Lubin and some other Frenchmen landed at Chaul and proceeded to Poona, and were there received with the highest honour.\\(^5\\) On St. Lubin\u2019s promise to bring a completely equipped French force to Poona, N\u00e1na concluded an alliance between France and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, granting the French the free use of the port of Chaul.\\(^6\\) At the same time N\u00e1na treated the English Agent at Poona with marked discourtesy. A considerable party at Poona, whose leaders were Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m and Moroba, were hostile to N\u00e1na and were anxious to see R\u00e1ghoba in power. Disappointed with the failure of the Purandhar treaty, and feeling that only by the overthrow of N\u00e1na could French influence at Poona be destroyed, the Governor General encouraged the Bombay Government to come to an arrangement with Sakh\u00e1r\u00e1m\u2019s party, and promised to send a force overland by Oudh and Ber\u00e1r to act with them in setting R\u00e1ghoba in power in Poona.

Colonel Leslie crossed the Jamna in May 1778, but, getting mixed with local disputes in Bundelkhand, he made little progress, and died on the 3rd of October 1778.\n\nOn receipt of the instructions from the Supreme Government, the Governor of Bombay decided to make a fresh alliance with R\u00e1ghoba on the terms of the Surat treaty of 1775. The English undertook to establish R\u00e1ghoba in Poona, but stipulated that, unless he could prove that the young Peshwa was not the son of N\u00e1r\u00e1y\u00e1nr\u00e1v, R\u00e1ghoba was to be placed in power merely as regent. In return R\u00e1ghoba promised to cede Bassein and Kh\u00e1nd\u00e9ri island, the \u00c1tgaons which formed part of S\u00e1lsette, and several districts in Gujar\u00e1t. He also promised that, without the consent of the English, no European should be allowed to settle in the Peshwa's territory. The treaty was concluded in Bombay on the 24th of November 1778. On the 22nd of November, hearing that the ministerial party were taking steps to oppose R\u00e1ghoba's march to Poona, a force of 3900 men was ordered to leave Bombay. The military command was given to Colonel Egerton, but all negotiations were to be carried on by Messrs. Carnac and Mostyn who accompanied the force. On the 25th of November the first division, under Captain Stewart, took possession of the Bor pass and of the village of Khand\u00e1la. Colonel Egerton, with the second division, seized Bel\u00e1pur, and, on the 26th November, encamped at Panvel. On the 15th December the whole army reached Khopivli, or Campoli, at the foot of the Bor pass. Here, though they heard that the ministerial troops were gathering to bar their passage to Poona, they remained till the 23rd of December, spending the time in making a road for the guns up the Bor pass. Meanwhile the Mar\u00e1tha horse ranged in large bodies between Khopivli and Panvel, and caused much annoyance to the camp. To add to their misfortunes, Mr. Mostyn, who alone had a thorough knowledge of Poona affairs, fell sick and returned to Bombay where he died on the 1st of January. Colonel Egerton's health also gave way. He resigned the command and left for Bombay, but the country was so full of Mar\u00e1tha horse that he was forced to return. On his return he resumed his place in the committee, but was succeeded in the command by Colonel Cockburn.\n\nWhen the English force reached the Deccan, contrary to R\u00e1ghoba's assurances, they found that the country was full of hostile horse, and that none of the chiefs were inclined to support R\u00e1ghoba's cause. In skirmishes between Khand\u00e1la and K\u00e1rli, the British force was unfortunate in losing Colonel Cay and Captain Stewart, two of its best officers. When they reached Talegaon, eighteen\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff's Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, 420.\n2 Aitkison's Treaties, V. 34-38.

A council was called, and, in spite of all that the ablest officers could urge, the majority determined to retreat. The retreating force was soon surrounded by Maratha horse, and, but for the courage and skill of Captain Hartley who commanded the rear guard, the greater part of the second division must have been destroyed. At Vadgaon, about four miles west of Talegaon and twenty east of Khandala, a second council was called and the majority agreed that the troops could not stand another day of such fierce fighting. Accordingly, on the 15th, they entered into treaty with Nana Fadnavis and Sindia. Nana Fadnavis made the surrender of Raghoba a preliminary to any agreement. But the English were spared the dishonour of giving him up, as Raghoba had already placed himself under the protection of Sindia. Disappointed of the object he had most at heart, Nana declared that orders must be sent to Colonel Goddard to conduct his detachment back to Bengal, and that the English must surrender all the Maratha territory they had acquired, and that, until the lands were handed over, the army must remain at Vadgaon. The negotiations with Sindia were more successful. On the promise of the cession of Broach, he arranged that the army should be released, and they retired to Bombay guarded by the troops they had been accustomed to see fly before them. In Bombay, joy at the return of the army was lost in the shame of the terms to which its leaders had submitted. At the council regret and recriminations were silenced. 'Our first duty,' said Governor Hornby (29th January), 'is to retrieve our affairs, our next is to inquire into the cause of failure.' He praised the courage of the army, blamed the commanding officers, and advised Colonel Egerton and Colonel Cockburn to abstain for the present from military duty. For his skill and courage in command of the rear guard he promoted Captain Hartley to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nAs Messrs. Carnac and Egerton had no authority to conclude a treaty, he held that the convention of Vadgaon was not binding. As regarded future dealings with the Marathas, he (19th February) gave his opinion that power in Poona was not in the hands of Nana but in the hands of Sindia, that Sindia was opposed to a French alliance and had shown himself friendly to the British, and that the British should make every effort to conclude an agreement with Sindia. As Raghoba was now a puppet in Sindia's hands, no further attempt should be made to raise him to power. The main objects of the English were to keep the French and Nana from any share in the government of Poona, and to preserve for the Company the territory they then held. Nana was told that Messrs. Carnac\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay in 1781, 188. About this time (1780) the Dutch were anxious to establish themselves at Bassein, but the negotiations failed.

The depressed state of the English in 1780 is shown by the Maratha piracies to which they had to submit. The governor of Bassein, one of the Peshwa's admirals, used to attack English ships, and, if they succeeded in proving the offence, all they gained was the explanation that their ship was supposed to belong to some other nation.\nand Egerton had no power to conclude a treaty, and that the English repudiated the Vadgaon convention. An attempt was made to open negotiations with Sindia. But Hornby had overestimated Sindia's goodwill to the English. The Marathas insisted that the terms of the Vadgaon convention should be carried out, and that Salsette and the Gujar\u00e1t territories should be ceded. To enforce their demands preparations were made for attacking Salsette, but precautions prevented the attack, and the safe arrival of Colonel Goddard at Surat, on the 25th of February, changed the face of affairs.\n\nOn Colonel Lewis' death on the 3rd of October, Colonel Goddard succeeded to the command of the army in Bundelkhand, and, in spite of great difficulty and danger, led his men through Bhop\u00e1l and Hoshangabad to the banks of the Narbada, which he reached on the 16th of January 1779. His instructions were to act as the Bombay Government advised, and his advice from Bombay was to push on to Junnar. On the 24th of January he received a letter from Mr. Carnac, dated the 11th, telling him that matters had changed, and advising him to give up Junnar and to march either to Bombay or to Surat, or, if he was not strong enough to do this, to stay in Ber\u00e1r. Colonel Goddard pushed on and reached Charv\u00e1h, opposite Burh\u00e1npur, on the 30th of January. On the 2nd of February he received a letter from Mr. Carnac and Colonel Egerton, dated Khopivli the 19th of January, telling him not to act on their letter of the 16th, as, on consideration, they found that they had no power to give the orders which that letter contained. No letter dated the 16th had been received. But the probability that the Bombay force had met with a heavy disaster, led Goddard to press on to Surat. On the 9th he received Mr. Carnac's letter of the 16th of January ordering his return to Bengal. After this, the march was carried on with such spirit that Surat was reached on the 25th of February, 300 miles, much of it wild and rugged, in nineteen days.\n\nOn hearing that Colonel Goddard was safe in Surat the Supreme Government made him their minister to treat with the Marathas. The treaty of Purandhar was to be renewed, provided the Marathas agreed to withdraw claims based on the Vadgaon convention and never to admit French forces into their dominions. At the request of the Bombay Government, Goddard visited Bombay on the 15th of March 1779. He agreed with the Bombay Government that no steps should be taken, till a further letter was received from the Supreme Council. He then returned to his army at Surat. On the 29th of May he wrote to the Poona Court telling them that he had been charged with negotiations at Poona, and expressing the wish of the Supreme Council to conclude a lasting treaty with the Marathas. In the struggle for power between N\u00e1na and Sindia, N\u00e1na was most anxious to gain possession of R\u00e1ghoba. In case N\u00e1na might succeed, Sindia sent R\u00e1ghoba under escort to Burh\u00e1npur, and, on the way, R\u00e1ghoba, suspecting that he would be thrown into confinement, escaped with a body of troops to Gujar\u00e1t, and threw himself on the protection of Colonel Goddard. Goddard agreed to protect him,\n\n---\n\n1 Bombay in 1781, 289.  \n2 Grant Duff, 424.\nand, on the 12th of June, R\u00e1ghoba joined the English camp. During the rains, negotiations went on between Colonel Goddard and the Poona Court. But, as the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s claimed the cession of S\u00e1lsette and demanded the surrender of R\u00e1ghoba, no advance was made.\n\nAt the close of the year General Goddard visited Bombay. Mr. Hornby proposed that the British should form an alliance with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r and attack the Peshwa's territory. This proposal was approved by the Supreme Government, and four companies of European infantry and two battalions of sepoys, under Colonel Hartley, were sent from Bombay to help Goddard in Surat.\n\nOn the 1st of January 1780, Goddard marched from Surat, took Dabhoi, and agreed with the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r to divide the Peshwa's Gujjar\u00e1t possessions, the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r keeping the north and the British the south. Ahmadabad fell on the 15th of February, and the success was followed by the defeat of part of Sindia's army. At the request of the Bombay Government, Hartley was ordered from Baroda to Bombay on the 8th of May. This reinforcement was much wanted in the Konkan. To prevent the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s cutting off Bombay supplies, small bodies of troops had been posted at different parts of the Konkan. Four European subalterns, in charge of two companies of sepoys, took post on one of the Sahy\u00e1dri passes, and another force under Captain Richard Campbell seized Kaly\u00e1n. Enraged at the loss of Kaly\u00e1n, N\u00e1na Fadnavis despatched a large force who took the British post on the Sahy\u00e1dris, and, on arriving near Kaly\u00e1n, sent a message to Captain Campbell demanding the surrender of the town. Campbell told them they were welcome to Kaly\u00e1n if they could take it, and made a spirited defence. A Mar\u00e1tha assault was planned for the 25th of May, but Colonel Hartley arrived, and, on the night of the 24th, surprised the Mar\u00e1tha camp, pursuing them for miles, and killing a great number. During the rest of the fair season the British remained unmolested in the Konkan. Shortly before the relief of Kaly\u00e1n, the bravery and skill of Lieutenant Welsh had (23rd April) gained a great advantage to the British, by the capture of the three forts of P\u00e1rnera, Bagv\u00e1da, and Indragad, on the borders of Gujjar\u00e1t and the Konkan. After the beginning of the rains the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacked the different posts in small parties, but Kaly\u00e1n was well garrisoned and was not molested.\n\nOn the third of August, the night on which the fort of Gw\u00e1lior was surprised by Captain Popham, Captain Abington marched about ten miles south from Kaly\u00e1n, and attempted to surprise the important fort of Malanggad or B\u00e1wa Malang. He secured the lower hill, but the garrison were able to retreat to the upper fort, and its mass of sheer rock defied assault. Meanwhile the Bombay Government were hardpressed for funds. They had looked for help to Bengal, but the whole strength of Bengal was strained to meet Haidar Ali's attack on Madras. Bombay had no resource but in its\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff, 429.  \n2 Grant Duff, 430-433.  \n3 Grant Duff, 434.  \n4 Grant Duff, 435.

The only means of raising a revenue was to overrun the enemies' territory as soon as the rains were over. With this object Goddard was asked to besiege Bassein, and, early in October, five battalions were placed under Colonel Hartley, with orders to drive out as many of the enemy's posts as possible and secure the rice harvest. He was to arrange his movements so as to hold the country between the Sahyadris and Bassein, and prevent the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s from strengthening that fort. Colonel Hartley's first service was, on the 1st of October, to relieve Captain Abington whose retreat from Malanggad to Kaly\u00e1n had been cut off by a force of Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The relief was completely successful and was effected with little loss. The troops pursued the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s to the Bor pass and enabled the Bombay Government to gather the greater part of the Th\u00e1na revenue. General Goddard arrived before Bassein on the 13th of November. On account of its strength he determined to attack by regular approaches, and completed his first battery on the 28th of November. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s strained every nerve to recover the Konkan and relieve Bassein. Large bodies of troops were hurried down, and Colonel Hartley, after a month's fighting, was forced to retire towards Dugad about nine miles east of Bassein. Finding that they could not succour Bassein, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s determined to destroy Hartley's army. On the 10th of December upwards of 20,000 men thrice attacked the Bombay division in front and rear, but each time were repulsed with slight loss though two of the slain were officers. On the eleventh the attack was repeated with heavier loss to the British, including two more officers. During the night Hartley fortified two heights that covered his flanks. Next morning at daybreak the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attempted a surprise. But they were met with so deadly a fire that they were forced to retire with the loss of their leader R\u00e1mchandra, who was slain, and of Signior Noronha, a Portuguese officer, who was wounded. Bassein had fallen on the day before the battle of Dugad (11th December), and, on the day after the battle, Goddard joined Hartley's camp. Though Bassein had fallen, Goddard was detained for about a month (18th January 1781) by the island fort of Arn\u00e1la about ten miles north of Bassein.\n\nHaidar Ali's success in Madras made the Supreme Government anxious to come to terms with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In the hope that a show of vigour might make the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s more willing for peace, Goddard pushed to the foot of the Bor pass, his advanced party forcing the pass on the night of the 8th of February and encamping at Khand\u00e1l\u00e1, while Goddard, with the head-quarters, remained below at Khopivli. This movement proved a failure. Nan\u00e1 Fadnavis was in no way affected by it. He refused to treat with the British unless the treaty included his ally Haidar\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff, 438.\n2 Grant Duff, 440. The British loss at Bassein was only thirteen, one of them, Sir John Gordon, an officer. Details of the siege of Bassein and of Hartley's battle at Dugad are given under Places of Interest, Bassein and Dugad.\n3 The total strength of his force was 6152 men, 640 Europeans and 5512 Natives. Grant Duff, 443 note.\nAli, and he sent a force of 12,000 men to cut off Goddard's communication with Panvel. On the 15th of March the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacked a convoy of grain near Chauk and caused severe loss. Goddard proposed to make a fort on the Bor pass and Mr. Hornby proposed to garrison R\u00e1jm\u00e1chi, but neither suggestion was carried out and Goddard prepared to return to Bombay. N\u00e1na kept on sending troops into the Konkan, and held the country between Khopivli and Panvel in such strength, that a convoy, sent by Goddard for grain, was unable to return from Panvel without the help of every disposable man from the Bombay garrison, or without the loss of 106 men killed and wounded. On the 19th of April Goddard brought his guns and baggage from the top of the Bor pass and prepared to march towards Panvel. Every movement was watched by three great bodies of Mar\u00e1tha horse. There were 15,000 men at the foot of the Kusur pass, 12,000 near Bhim\u00e1shankar, and 25,000 at the top of the Bor pass. On the 20th, the moment that Goddard began his march, the Deccan force poured into the Konkan and captured much of his baggage. On the 20th, Goddard moved seven miles to Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur, and next day seven miles to Chauk. On the way his loss was severe, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s attacking the rear, assailing the front, and keeping up a steady fire from behind rocks and bushes. On the 22nd the British halted at Chauk. Early in the morning of the 23rd, the baggage was sent ahead and some distance was covered before the enemy came up. Then the attack was so severe that Goddard made a show of pitching his tents and the enemy withdrew. The army reached Panvel on the evening of the 23rd April, without further annoyance, but with the loss of 466 killed and wounded, of whom eighteen were European officers. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s considered Goddard's retreat one of their greatest victories. From Panvel part of Goddard's army was drafted to Madras; the rest were moved to Kaly\u00e1n and there spent the rains. A large Mar\u00e1tha force was sent towards Gujar\u00e1t and their garrisons strengthened.\n\nDuring the rains (June-November 1781) the Bombay Government were extremely hardpressed for money. Several schemes for carrying on the war on a large scale had to be set aside for want of funds. During the next fair season defensive operations continued in the Konkan. But the great power of Haidar Ali made peace with the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s so important that, at last, on the 17th May 1782 the treaty of Salb\u00e1\u00ed was concluded. One of its chief provisions was the restoration of all territory conquered from the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s since the treaty of Purandhar in 1775. This reduced the British possessions in the north Konkan to Bombay, S\u00e1lsette, and the three small islands of Elephanta, Karanja, and Hog Island.\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff, 447.\n2 Grant Duff, 447.\n3 One suggestion which was fully considered, but finally rejected, was that certain Mar\u00e1tha deshmukhs, whose ancestors had held lands under the Muhammadians, should put the English in possession of the Konkan, the English giving them \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) for each of the larger and \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) for each of the smaller forts, and allowing them to keep all money, jewels, and wares they might capture. Grant-Duff, 450-451.\n4 Aitchison's Treaties, V. 41. Grant Duff, 452. The treaty was not finally exchanged till the 24th February 1783.\nBassein had to be given up, but from Mar\u00e1tha delay in completing the treaty it was not actually transferred till April 1783. About the time when the treaty of Salb\u00e1i was concluded, the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s confirmed the Jawh\u00e1r-chief in the small territory which they had left him.\n\nDuring the disturbances that ended in the treaty of Salb\u00e1i the district had suffered severely. In February 1781, every village, hut, and stack, on the high road between Kaly\u00e1n and Khopivli, had been burnt, and most of the people had fled. Even the rich coast tract seems to have become impoverished, as the loss of seventy-five carts and forty-four oxen is said to have caused great distress to the district of Bassein. The scarcity of money in Bombay made a liberal policy in S\u00e1lsette impossible. The island showed few signs of improvement. Mr. Forbes, who revisited the Kanheri caves in 1783, was astonished to find that, during the ten years S\u00e1lsette had been under the Company, tillage had not spread. The gentle hills and valleys in the centre of the island were still in their former state of wildness.\n\nIn the Mar\u00e1tha districts, on the way to the hot springs of Vajr\u00e1b\u00e1i, about twelve miles north of Bhiwandi, were fields of rice, pulse, and a little tobacco. Mango trees abounded and there were a few lime trees, plantains, and guavas round the Vajr\u00e1b\u00e1i temples. Grass grew to a surprising height and there was abundance of flowers and fragrant herbs. The people were lazy, living from hand to mouth, partly because industry was never the character of the Mar\u00e1tha, partly from the unhappy constitution of the government and the confused state of the country. Four years later, in the rains of 1787 (15th August-11th September) the Polish traveller Dr. Hov\u00e9 made several botanical trips through S\u00e1lsette and the neighbouring mainland. S\u00e1lsette showed signs of great decay; it was thinly peopled and poorly tilled. From Versova to Th\u00e1na Hov\u00e9 did not find a single village or any signs of tillage. There was teak of an amazing height and thickness, and there were remains of churches, chapels, and large buildings all pining in decay. Near Th\u00e1na there was some rich rice tillage, and at Dh\u00e1r\u00e1vi, in the west, rice, sugar-\n\n---\n\n1 Grant Duff, 457.

On his way to the caves, he and his palanquin-bearers met a string of about a hundred girls, carrying baskets of dried fish to market. As Macneil drew near, the girls took to flight, the bearers chasing them and taking by force some handfuls of fish from as many of the baskets as they could lay hold of. Macneil forbore punishing his men, as he learned 'that custom hallowed the act and that the tax was a constant perquisite of these gentlemen of the road.'\n6 Or. Mem. IV. 248.\n7 Tours, 13-16. According to Hov\u00e9 the practice of sowing rice in beds and planting it out in tufts had only lately been introduced from Gujar\u00e1t. It saved seed and trebled the outturn. Ditto, 13.\ncane, and vegetables were grown. But in the south-east, while there were remains of wells and marks of former tillage, there was a large waste area of level land fit for sugarcane and rice. The produce of the island was not enough to maintain the garrison and town of Th\u00e1na.\\(^1\\) The Mar\u00e1tha mainland was even more deserted than S\u00e1lsette. Between Th\u00e1na and Vajr\u00e1b\u00e1\u00ed there was not a single village; and travelling was dangerous from tigers, of whom five were seen in one day, from buffaloes who pursued Europeans like enemies, and from natives who were such enthusiasts for their religion that they looked on Europeans as the lowest on earth and did not scruple to kill them.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn the January following (1788) Hov\u00e9 travelled down the west coast from Surat to Bassein. The Th\u00e1na part of the country was well watered and on the whole fertile. The hills yielded the finest teak and the valleys high grass, and on some of the flats, near N\u00e1rgol, grew a luxuriant wild sugarcane.\\(^3\\) The extreme north was very wild, the hills were covered with unbroken forest, and the valleys were overgrown with grass. Further south, between Umbargaon and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, the ruggedness disappeared, the coast lands were plain and rich, and the hills yellow and bare. South of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, almost the whole way to Bassein, the coast strip was rich and well tilled with rice, sugarcane, and plantains.\\(^4\\) During the day the thermometer was never less than \\(89^\\circ\\), but the nights were unexpectedly cold, small pools of water being frozen over near Maroli on the night of the thirteenth January. The valleys were full of brushwood and bastard poon, Sterculia foetida. Along the coast, between Umbargaon and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, were large groves of brab-palms, and further north, near Maroli, the country abounded in teak of a prodigious size, several of the trees measuring over twelve feet in girth and not less than eighty feet high.\\(^5\\) In the rich coast strip between D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and Bassein, rice, yams, and turmeric were grown. There were also sugarcane gardens with plantains and pomegranates, the canes very flourishing, fifteen feet high and thick in proportion.\\(^6\\) In the north there were many tigers. Not a day passed that several were not started. Some of the villages had herds of cattle hunch-backed and small, miniatures of the Gujar\u00e1t oxen, and so moderate in price that any number might have been bought at 2s. (Re. 1) a head. There were some sheep with wool as soft and white as Gujar\u00e1t cotton.\\(^7\\) Except the rich coast the country was poorly peopled and badly tilled. From the north to Bassein Hov\u00e9 did not see more than thirteen villages. The people were dark, slender, active, and long-lived. They ate all animal food except the ox, and drank liquor freely.

According to Hov\u00e9 the growth of sugarcane had been introduced only eight years before (1780). It had spread so rapidly that, instead of importing sugar, the people of Bassein were able to send it to Bombay and Surat. They had not learned the art of refining sugar.  \n\\(^7\\) Tours, 101.\nclothing was of wool. Their villages, especially in the hills, were small, of not more than thirteen families. They were pining in poverty and destitute of comfort. Though the country was so rough the coast route was passable for carts, Hov\u00e9 had a horse and two carts, and he talks of hundreds of hackeries, between Umbergaon and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, coming to load jars of palm-juice.\n\nThe country seems to have been free from robbers. All along the route, especially in the north, were posts of mounted guardsmen who lived in small thatched huts, tilled a plot of land, and were armed with a sabre, a spear, and a matchlock. One of their chief duties was to give alarm on the appearance of an enemy. They stopped travellers, and, if they had not passes, took them to the chief officer of the district, who closely examined them. There were also posts at every ferry, and no one could pass without heavily feeding the head of the watch. The Mar\u00e1tha officers pillaged openly and forced travellers to give whatever they chose to ask. Gujar\u00e1t, though full of robbers, was less troublesome and cheaper to travel in.\u00b9\n\nIn 1783 Forbes found Bombay greatly increased since 1774. The troubles on the mainland had driven people to Bombay, and a flourishing commerce had drawn others. Provisions and supplies were plentiful, but prices were high, double what they used to be. The island was almost covered with houses and gardens. It would soon be a city like Surat or Ahmadabad.\u00b2\n\nIn 1790 Th\u00e1na, with other parts of Western India, suffered from a failure of rain and from famine.\u00b3 In 1793 a great part of S\u00e1lsette appeared to be lying waste. But an attempt had lately been made to grow sugarcane and indigo, and a Dr. Stewart from Bombay was superintending the infant plantations.\u2074 Shortly after this a few large estates were granted to British subjects with the view of improving the country.\u2075 In 1801 a permanent settlement was offered to the holders of land in S\u00e1lsette, but only four landholders accepted the offer.\u2076 During the last fifteen years of the eighteenth century, trade, especially the Chinese cotton trade, had brought much money into Bombay.

Francklin (Pinkerton's Voyages, IX. 236) describes Bombay in 1786 as very beautiful and as populous for its size as any island in the world. It had a splendid harbour, an excellent dock, and a ship-building yard with very ingenious and dexterous shipwrights, not inferior to the best in England. Merchants and others had come to settle from the Deccan, the Malabar and Coromandel coasts, and from Gujar\u00e1t.

The country suffered severely from the raids of Deccan Kolis. A gang over 1000 strong divided into two or three parties, robbed villages at their leisure, shared the spoil, and disappeared to their homes. The guards posted in different places among the hills could do nothing to stop them.\\(^2\\)\n\n**SECTION IV.\u2014ENGLISH (1800-1882.)**\n\nIn 1802, after the victory of Yeshvantr\u00e1v Holkar, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v Peshwa retired to Mah\u00e1d in south Kol\u00e1ba. From Mah\u00e1d, followed by Holkar, he fled to Suvarndurg; finding Suvarndurg ruined, he sailed to Chaul, and after a few days, delayed by head winds, landed on the 15th of December at Manori in S\u00e1sette, and reached Bassein on the seventeenth with thirty followers.\\(^3\\) On his arrival at Bassein B\u00e1jir\u00e1v was met by Colonel Close, the British agent at Poona. The terms of a treaty, under which the British should uphold the power of the Peshwa, had already been considered. Discussion was renewed on the 18th of December and concluded on the 31st.\\(^4\\) Under the terms of the treaty then framed, which is known as the treaty of Bassein, the English agreed to guard the Peshwa's territory against all enemies, and the Peshwa agreed to have no dealings with any European nation but the English. A subsidiary force of 6000 Native Infantry, with the usual proportion of field pieces and of European artillerymen, was to be furnished by the English and stationed in the Peshwa's territory. For the support of this force, the Peshwa was to cede to the English districts yielding a yearly revenue of \u00a3260,000 (Rs. 26,00,000).\\(^5\\) It was also arranged that the Peshwa was to maintain a force of 5000 cavalry and 3000 infantry with a due proportion of artillery,\\(^6\\) and that he should enter into no negotiations without consulting the British Government. To ensure the Peshwa's safety a field detachment was sent to Bassein, and a considerable stockade of palmyra trees was raised to defend the Sop\u00e1ra bridge.\\(^7\\) The Peshwa remained in Bassein till the 27th of April (1803). Then, escorted by a British force of 2200 men, including the 78th Regiment part of the 84th and some artillery, he moved to Kaly\u00e1n, and, after staying a week at Kaly\u00e1n, marched to Poona by the Bor pass.\\(^8\\)\n\nDuring the famine years of 1803 and 1804 there was much distress\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Manuscript Records in Nairne's Konkan, 124.

The country had not suffered from the ravages of Holkar, and therefore the famine pressed less heavily than above the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. But numbers of starving people came from the Deccan, and at Panvel and other places the mortality was heavy.\\(^1\\) Ten years later the famine of 1811 and 1812, which wasted M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, Gujar\u00e1t, Cutch, and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, extended to Th\u00e1na. Th\u00e1na does not seem to have suffered from the plague of locusts, which in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and north Gujar\u00e1t destroyed the harvest of 1811. But as was the case further north, the rains of 1812 seem to have failed or nearly failed on the Th\u00e1na coast,\\(^2\\) and, in addition to local distress, the country was covered with bands of famine-stricken strangers from M\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Gujar\u00e1t. There was known to be food and wealth in Bombay, and all the ferries between the mainland and the island were crowded with half-famished people streaming in converging lines from all parts of the country. Bombay held a supply of grain enough to last its own population of about 200,000 for fifteen months. The question arose whether strangers should be prevented from landing and grain prevented from leaving the island. After much debate, it was decided that no attempt should be made to keep refugees from landing on the island, and that grain merchants should be left free to export grain to places where the famine was more severe. The grain merchants, assured that they would not be hampered in disposing of their stocks, imported freely, and Bombay became the granary of Western India. As grain continued comparatively cheap in Bombay, crowds flocked to it from the famine-stricken north. It was estimated that about 20,000 strangers found their way to the island. The wharfs and roads were lined with crowds of wretched half-starved objects; the eastern or land side of Bombay was strewn with the dead and dying.\\(^3\\) Much was done to help the strangers. English and native committees were appointed to buy rice. Huge boilers were provided in a cocoa-palm grove about half a mile from the fort, and care was taken to provide cooks for each caste. As pestilence accompanied the famine, great hospital sheds were built outside of the fort. In spite of these efforts to save the famished strangers, the death-rate rose from about fifteen to thirty or forty a day and sometimes to over a hundred. Back Bay was lined by a row of funeral fires that never ceased to blaze night or day, and a few hundred yards from the beach was a long line of coasting vessels, laden with faggots and billets for the funeral piles.\\(^4\\)\n\nFor fifteen years (1803-1817) the English guarantee secured peace over the whole district, and, except for an occasional P\u00f3ndh\u00e1ri raid, fair security to person and property.\\(^5\\) Trusting to English support,\n\n---\n\n1 The details are given in Chapter IV, p. 303.\n2 On the 16th of December 1816, Shaikh Dalu a Pendh\u00e1ri leader descended into the Konkan by the \u00c1mba pass in Ratn\u00e1giri, and, marching north, plundered the west of Th\u00e1na and returned by way of the T\u00e1pt\u00ed to Burh\u00e1npur.

Authority was handed to the revenue farmers and no complaints were listened to. The farmer had no motive to be lenient. His term of power was most uncertain. At any time a higher bid might put an end to his contract, and, if he failed to pay, his property was confiscated and himself thrown into prison.\n\nThe Th\u00e1na ports shown in the map in Milburn's Oriental Commerce (1800-1812) are Daman, D\u00e1h\u00e1n\u00fa, Sirgaon, Ag\u00e1shi, Elephanta, Bassein, Versova, Bombay, Karanja, Kol\u00e1ba, and Chaul.\n\nThe Bombay trade-returns for the early years of the nineteenth century seem to show that the great development of Bombay, of which details are given later on, was accompanied by the revival of a considerable trade in the other ports of the Th\u00e1na coast. The 1802 returns show a total trade between the Bassein ports and Bombay and Surat, valued at about three and a half l\u00e1khs of rupees, of which about two l\u00e1khs were exports and one and a half l\u00e1khs imports. In 1805 the total value of the trade had risen to about nine l\u00e1khs, of which four and a half l\u00e1khs were exports and four and a quarter l\u00e1khs imports. In 1815 it again fell to about seven l\u00e1khs, of which about three and three-quarters were exports and three and a quarter were imports. According to Milburn, the Bassein trade during the five years ending 1806 averaged about nine l\u00e1khs of rupees, of which about five l\u00e1khs were exports and four l\u00e1khs were imports. The details for 1805 are, under exports, piecegoods, grain, iron, sugar, cocoanuts, cocoa-kernels, betelnut, dates, pepper, turmeric, and treasure; and under imports, grain, ivory, oil, timber, hemp, piecegoods, and betelnut.\n\nIn the beginning of the nineteenth century, the climate of Bombay, though healthy, was still somewhat treacherous, exposure\n\n---\n\n1 Nairne's Konkan, 110. Details are given in the Land Administration Chapter.\n2 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 143, 168. Milburn mentions the making of beautiful teak ships of 800 tons at Daman, 168.\n3 In 1801 a reporter of external commerce was appointed at Bombay, and Milburn states (Or. Com. I. 181) that the returns from 1801 to 1806 may be considered accurate. At the same time, in an enquiry into the details of local trade, the fact that the main head is Bombay and Surat, not Bombay, is puzzling. After the beginning of the nineteenth century, almost the whole of the foreign trade of Surat passed through Bombay (Surat Papers, 278, 374, 384; Bombay Gazetteer, II. 128; Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, II. 156), so that in the foreign trade the double head does not cause confusion; but in the local trade with the Bassein coast the returns are not easy to follow.\n4 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, II. 157.\n5 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 213.\n6 Hamilton's Description of Hindust\u00e1n, II. 158; Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 213. These entries seem to imply a direct trade between Bassein and the Arab and African coasts. Even with a direct trade the appearance of iron and dates among the exports, and of timber and betelnut among the imports is peculiar. Another head in the returns 'Commerce between the Island of Bombay and Bombay and Surat' shows for the five years ending 1806 an average trade valued at 28 l\u00e1khs, of which about 13 l\u00e1khs were exports from the island of Bombay and neighbouring villages, and about 15 l\u00e1khs were imports. This seems to include the trade between Surat and Bombay. Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 204. The export of iron and dates from Th\u00e1na ports is explained by the fact that they were re-exports received from Bombay and sent from Bassein or some of the main local centres to smaller outlying ports.\nto the land-wind being followed by fever and frequently by the loss of the use of limbs. The charming island was intersected by beautifully macadamised roads long before that grand improvement was heard of in England. The fort or walled town was nearly a mile long and about a quarter of a mile broad. The fortifications were numerous and well planned, very strong to the sea but liable to be taken from the land. The broad deep ditch, which could be filled at pleasure, made it one of the strongest places the Company had in India. Besides the fort, there were several redoubts in other parts of the island, especially one at M\u0101him. If properly garrisoned Bombay could bid defiance to any force that could be brought against it. The fort had five gates, two Marine Gates on the south, the Apollo and Church Gates to the west, and the B\u0101z\u0101r Gate to the north. Between the two harbour gates was the castle, a regular quadrangle well built of strong hard stone. To the west of the castle was the dockyard large, well planned, and full of stores. The dry dock had scarce its equal for size, and there was a rope-walk as long as any in England, except the walk in the King's Yard at Portsmouth. In the centre of the fort was an open green, where, in the fine weather, were packed bales of cotton and other merchandise. Round the green were many large, well built, and handsome houses. To the left of Church Gate street, looking west from the Green, were, close together, the commodious and airy church and Government house, and, on the right, the theatre a neat handsome structure, and behind the theatre, the b\u0101z\u0101r very crowded and populous where the native merchants chiefly lived. Some of the houses were high and large with wooden pillars in front supporting wooden verandas. In February 1803 a great fire destroyed three-fourths of the b\u0101z\u0101r, with the barracks, the custom-house, and many other public buildings. Had not many houses near the castle been battered down with artillery, the whole town would have been destroyed. The private loss was estimated at about fifty l\u0101khs of rupees.\n\n1 Valentia's Travels (1804), II. 182. Even Mackintosh (1804-1811) does not complain much of the climate.

To Mackintosh, the disappointed London-loving man of thought, to whom half a dozen Indian victories were not so interesting as one letter from Mark Lane, Bombay was, 'a cursed country,' 'a remote second-rate settlement in a distant quarter of Asia' (Life, I. 218, 221, 222). To Basil Hall, the cheerful travel-loving man of action, in the noble range of the eastern world few places could compare with Bombay. A week or two in Bombay and a visit to Elephanta, K\u0101rli, and Poonah, was the shortest cheapest and most enjoyable way of seeing all that was most characteristic of the oriental world. Fragments, 2nd Series, III. 6-7.\n\n3 Valsntia (1804) says, 'One-third of the town was reduced to ashes; the rest was saved with the greatest difficulty. The old Government house caught fire more than once.' Had they not put it out, the magazine would have caught fire too and several thousand barrels of gunpowder would have scattered the city to all points of the compass. Travels, II. 175.\nAfter the fire the town was rebuilt and much improved. In 1813 the buildings within the fort were valued at one crore and five l\u0101khs of rupees, and their yearly rental estimated at Rs. 5,27,360.\n\nTo the north of the fort was the Esplanade 800 yards broad, and since 1802 clear of huts. Beyond the esplanade, hid among cocoa-palms, was the Black Town. The improvements in rebuilding the fort and the clearing of the esplanade had driven the poor to settle in the Company's salt rice land. This was scarcely recovered from the sea, a low muddy tract, a shallow lake during the rainy season. On Colaba there was a light-house and a signal station, barracks, and many delightful villas. In 1812 the number of houses (apparently in the island, but this is not clear) was about 20,000, and the number of people 235,000, of whom 160,000 were fixed and 60,000 migratory. The Europeans had bungalows or villas, and all sorts of country-houses and some very splendid retreats from the bustle of business; the rich natives owned large houses, the children living in part of the house even after they were married; the poor classes lived in small huts thatched with palm-leaves, or, as at present, were crowded into great buildings or ch\u0101ls, a hundred or even 300 persons being stowed under one roof.\n\nBombay was 'a jumble of nations.' Besides Europeans, it had people from almost every Asiatic nation, P\u0101rsis, Muhammadans, Gentoes, Arabs, and Roman Catholics. Among European merchants there were five houses of agency. The agency business alone did not pay, as the profits were absorbed by interest in cash balances and\n\n---\n\n1 Hamilton's Hindust\u00e1n, II. 154; Warden, 75; and Milburn, I. lxxxv.\n2 An account of the difficulties and delays in clearing the esplanade is given in Bom.

The population of Bombay, wrote Basil Hall in 1812 (Fragments, 2nd Series, III. 11), is wonderfully varied. There is no caste, dress, or custom in India, the Malay Peninsula, J\u0101va, China, or the Phillippine Islands, that we may not see in Bombay. Hall's estimate in 1812 was, Hindus 104,000, Musalm\u00e1ns 28,000, P\u0101rsis 13,000, Jews 800, Native Christians 14,500, total permanent residents about 160,000; Europeans 1700, Native troops 3000, migratory population 50,000, total about 215,000. Hall's Fragments, 2nd Series, III. 43. This estimate was perhaps excessive, as further information in 1816 showed only 162,000. The details were: Europeans 4300, Native Christians 11,500, Jews 800, Muhammadans 28,000, Hindus 103,800, P\u0101rsis 13,150, or a total of 161,550. Hamilton's Hindust\u00e1n, II. 159. Ten years later the total population of the island was by special census taken in August, September, October, and November, found to be 162,570. Of these 20,000 were temporary and 10,000 military. Of the remaining 132,570, 13,000 were in the Fort, 47,000 in Dongri, 31,000 in Byeulla, 4500 in M\u00e1zgaon, 2500 on the Malab\u00e1r Hill, 13,000 in Girgaon, 17,500 in Mahim, and 2500 in Colaba. Arranged according to race, of the regular population of 130,000, 938 were English, 8000 were Portuguese, 10,500 were P\u0101rsis, 1250 were Jews, 39 were Armenians, 26,000 Musalm\u00e1ns, 82,500 Hindus, 3000 Mh\u0101rs, and 48 Chinese.

Without trade these houses could scarce gain a subsistence. They allowed nine per cent for money deposited in their hands, and their command of capital enabled them to embrace every opportunity that occurred. The late wars had offered great and uncommon openings, and especially shipowners had made large and sudden fortunes. The return of peace would drive merchants back to their former pursuits, the Indian and China commerce. Besides the five houses of agency there were four European wine merchants and shopkeepers. Parsis, an active industrious and clever people, 'possessed of considerable local knowledge,' ranked next to the Europeans. They lived in the north of the fort, and were not remarkably cleanly in their domestic concerns or in the streets where they lived. Many of them were rich, and each of the European houses of agency had one of the principal Parsi merchants concerned with them in their foreign speculations. They were become the brokers and Banians of the Europeans. There were sixteen leading Parsi firms and two Parsi China agents. In addition to their success as traders the Parsis had a monopoly of the dockyard, and had almost entirely made Bombay their own. Hardly a house or a foot of land belonged to any one else. Besides the Parsis there were three Portuguese, four Armenian, and fifteen Hindu firms possessed of great property and men of much integrity. Finally there were four firms of Bohoras or Muhammadan Jews, who carried on great trade with Gujarat and other places to the north. The people were orderly. During the seven years ending 1811 there was only one capital punishment.\n\nBombay had suffered long from the dearness of provisions. Full advantage was not taken of the conquest of Salsette, till, in 1802, Governor Duncan made the Sion causeway and took off import dues. This was of 'infinite service' to the farmers and gardeners who supplied the markets. Within ten years Hall could venture to say that there was no spot on the earth's surface where the means of subsistence were cheaper or in greater variety and even profusion.\n\nThe chief product of Bombay was its ships. There were six firms of builders all of them Parsis, who had an absolute monopoly of the docks. In the first ten years of the century many merchant\n\n---\n\n1 In 1804 Valentia speaks of the trade as inferior to what it had been. During the great war between England and France, the Arabs as neutral parties had got into their hands a great part of the trade. Travels, II. 180, 181. In 1810 there was a trade crisis threatening commercial credit. Life of Mackintosh, II. 38.\n2 Baxter Son and Co., John Mitchell and Co., Wooller and Co., R. McLean and Co., Mackintosh (1804, Life, I, 229) mentions two barristers 'gentleman-like men.'\n3 Hamilton's Hindustan, II, 154.\n4 Valentia's Travels, II, 186. The Parsis suffered severely in the trade crisis of 1810. Mackintosh wrote (July 30th, 1810), Nasarvanji Manejji has failed for \u00a3150,000, 'a trifle for a Parsi'; Dady's two sons are in danger. I should not wonder if the Parsis have seen their brightest days. Life of Mackintosh, II, 38.\n5 Life of Mackintosh, II, 110, 112.

In beauty of construction, excellent workmanship, and durability, they were superior to any class of merchant ships in the world. Bombay was the first place out of Europe, where a ship of the line was built.\\(^1\\) For the skill of its naval architects, the superiority of its timber, and the excellence of its dock, Bombay might be considered of the first importance in the British empire in India.\\(^2\\)\n\nThough Bombay did not from its own products furnish any considerable article of export, or even food enough for its people,\\(^3\\) all European and Asiatic commodities could be procured in it. It was the emporium of Persia, Arabia, and the west of India.\\(^4\\) Besides this Bombay had a great trade with England. 'Of the lists of European and other commodities suitable for the British Presidencies those for Bombay were the most extensive. There was scarcely an article manufactured in England that was not taken to Bombay in considerable quantities.'\\(^5\\) During the early years of the nineteenth century, of the two main branches of trade, the Asiatic or country trade, so called because it was carried in Indian ships and with Indian capital, was entirely in the hands of private persons.\\(^6\\) The trade with England was carried on partly by the Company partly by private merchants. Of the whole trade with England the Company imported into Bombay about the same amount of treasure as the private traders, and under merchandise imported and exported half as much again as private traders.\\(^7\\) During the five years ending 1806 imports averaged 412 l\u0101khs, of which 92 l\u0101khs were treasure; and exports averaged 318 l\u0101khs, of which 36 l\u0101khs were treasure.\n\nIn 1805, of the whole trade valued at 741 l\u0101khs of rupees, 411 were imports and 330 exports.\\(^8\\) Of the whole amount, 443 l\u0101khs or\n\n---\n\n1 The largest ship ever built in Bombay was the Ganges, a frigate pierced to carry 92 guns and of 2289 tons. Low's Indian Navy, I. 298. Of other men-of-war there were launched one of 74 guns, two of 38 guns, two of 36, two of 18, and two of 10 guns. For commercial purposes there were built up to about 1816 nine ships of 1000 tons, five of 800, six of 700, five about 600 tons, and 35 smaller vessels. Hamilton's Hindustan, II. 156.\n\n2 Milburn (Oriental Commerce, I. 172) says, all the ships were of Malabar teak. Hamilton (Hindustan, II. 156) says, the teak comes from the forests to the north and east of Bassein, Hamilton was correct. Compare Pennant's Outlines of the Globe (1798), I. 81; Rennell's Memoir of a Map of Hindustan, 180. Valentia (1804) is not so complimentary to the Parsi management of the dockyard as some other writers. They used bad timber and scamped the work. Frauds were common; the system called loudly for reform. Travels, II. 179-180.\n\n3 Onions seem to be the one article for which Bombay has all along been noted, 'Bombay produces most excellent onions; other provisions are scarce and dear.' Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 272.\n\n4 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 181. Hamilton (Hindustan, II. 156) notices Bombay as a specially good place to buy gums and drugs of all kinds, Mokha coffee, carnelians, agates, and blue and other Surat cloths.\n\n5 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. Preface. This great import of miscellaneous British ware was to some extent abnormal, to supply the stocks which were destroyed in the fire of 1803. Ditto. 6 Milburn's Oriental Commerce, I. 181, 241.\n\n7 The private trade with England was subject to certain conditions, till, in 1813, all restrictions ceased. The monopoly of the trade between England and China was continued to the Company for thirty years more.\n\n8 There was also the Company's trade of 17\u00bd l\u0101khs, 3\u00bd l\u0101khs of imports and 14\u00bd l\u0101khs of exports.\n59\u00b764 per cent were with India, and 253 l\u0101khs or 84\u00b714 per cent with other parts of Asia and East Africa; 3 l\u0101khs or 0\u00b740 per cent were with America; and 42 l\u0101khs or 5\u00b766 per cent with Europe. Of the Indian trade about 39 l\u0101khs, 18 of them imports and 21 exports, were with Th\u0101na ports; about 208 l\u0101khs, 100 imports and 108 exports, with Gujar\u0101t; about 42 l\u0101khs, 26 imports and 16 exports, with Cutch and Sindh; about 54 l\u0101khs, 14 imports and 40 exports, with the South Konkan; about 25 l\u0101khs, 18 imports and 7 exports, with Malab\u0101r; 1\u00bc, \u00be imports and \u00bd exports, with Ceylon; \u00bc, 2 exports and \u00bd imports, with Coromandel; and 70\u00bc, 68 imports and 2\u00be exports, with Bengal.\n\nOf the 253 l\u0101khs of trade with foreign Asia and East Africa, fifty l\u0101khs, 29 imports and 21 exports, were with the Persian Gulf; 41 l\u0101khs, 26 imports and 15 exports, with the Arabian Gulf; 5 l\u0101khs, 4 imports and 1 exports, with the Straits; and 157 l\u0101khs, 85 imports and 72 exports, with China. Of three l\u0101khs of trade with America, 2 were imports and 1 exports. Of the 42 l\u0101khs of trade with Europe, 14\u00bd l\u0101khs, 9 imports and 5\u00bd exports, were with Lisbon; 1\u00bd l\u0101khs, all imports of wine, with Madeira; and 26\u00be l\u0101khs, 19 imports and 7\u00be exports, with England.\n\nThe most important branch of the foreign trade of Bombay was with China. The basis of this trade was the export of cotton from Bombay. This export of cotton dated from about 1770, when a famine in China led the Chinese government to issue an edict ordering the cultivation of grain. Sometimes as much as 80,000 bales of 375 pounds each were sent in a year from Bombay to China. But in 1805 the golden days of the cotton trade were over. Scanty supplies and frauds had induced Madras and Bengal to compete, and had tempted the Chinese to grow their cotton at home.

In 1763 Niebuhr found 125 Banians in Sana in Yemen, who paid 300 crowns to live in the city; in Mokha there were 700 Banians, many of them considerable merchants and very honest men, and Rajputs and other Indians who were goldsmiths and mechanics. They were considered strangers as they went back to India when they made money. They suffered many mortifications. There were Banians also at Maskat where they were better off, keeping their own law and practising their own religion. In the beginning of the nineteenth century, in the Persian Gulf the Company\u2019s broker at Maskat was a Hindu, who was so desirous of saving the lives of the bullocks that meat had to be brought on board clandestinely. In the Arabian Gulf the greatest part of the foreign trade in Mokha was in the hands of Banians who had partners in Aden. The Banians were safe to deal with, because if one failed his companions paid. At Masuah on the west shore of the Red Sea the Banians were comfortable men of good property. Karamchand would receive a cargo, and, considering himself responsible for the whole, would dispose of it to smaller people worthy of credit. The smaller people took it into the interior and in three months returned with value in other goods. Hindus were also settled in Batavia in J\u00e1va.

Lord Valentia about the same time (1804) found Banians at Aden, Mokha, Berbera on the Somali coast, and Masuah on the Abyssinian coast. Most of them came from Jigat in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war; they came young and stayed till they had made a sufficiency. They suffered great extortion at Mokha especially just before their return to India. They lived according to their own laws and showed great obedience to the head Banian. They were inoffensive and timid, but bound by no tie of honesty. The Masuah Banians were very comfortable, being allowed wives if they pleased. Travels, II. 48, 57, 88, 229, 253, 378-379. In November 1835 the traveller Wellsted (Travels in Arabia, I. 18, 20) found 1500 Banians in Maskat. They chiefly belonged to the north-west of India, and had come to Maskat by sea from Porbandar in K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. They had a small temple, and about 200 well-fed sheep and mischievous cows which they adored. They burned\nwent to Holland and became a skilful navigator and shipwright.\\(^1\\) In 1781, a Hindu of the name of Harim\u00e1n, according to some accounts a Chitp\u00e1v\u00e1n Br\u00e1hman and according to others a Prabhu, was sent on a mission by Raghus\u00e1tr\u00e1v to England.\\(^2\\) The best seamen in India were to be found in Bombay. They came from the Gujar\u00e1t, K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and Cutch coasts. They seem to have been both Hindus and Musalm\u00e1ns, but the most famous were the Muhammadan lask\u00e1rs of Gogha.\\(^3\\)\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, especially since 1759, when the English were appointed Admirals of the Moghal fleet, much had been done to give security to vessels trading in the Arabian Sea.\\(^4\\) But the west coast of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, M\u00e1lvan in Ratn\u00e1giri, and Maskat in the Persian Gulf, remained centres of piracy till their power was crushed between 1810 and 1820.\\(^5\\)\n\nUnder British protection, in spite of Mar\u00e1tha exactions, Th\u00e1na like other parts of the Peshwa's possessions greatly improved.\\(^6\\) By 1816 the Peshwa had amassed \u00a35,000,000 (Rs. 5,00,00,000).\\(^7\\) Under the influence of his favourite Trimbakji Denglia he became estranged from the English, and busied himself in forming plans for\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Burnse' Bokh\u00e1ra, III. 7.

Quar. Rev. IV. 99); in 1756 and 1757 \u00c1ngria's head-quarters at Suvardurg and Gheria were captured (Low's Indian Navy, I. 128-136); and between 1759 and 1788 nearly 100 pirate vessels of Cutch, Okh\u00e1mandal, and south K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r had been destroyed. Low's Indian Navy, I. 151. In 1804 Valentia complained that the English were held in little respect in the Persian Gulf, as they allowed their vessels to be plundered by the Joh\u00e1smis of Maskat and Bahrain (Travels, II. 193). In 1809 an expedition was sent against the Joh\u00e1smis; their stronghold R\u00e1s-el-Khaimah was taken and fifty of their vessels burnt. This checked the Joh\u00e1smis for a time. A few years later many Wah\u00e1b\u00eds joined them. They fitted up a fleet of more than a hundred large swift vessels from 200 to 400 tons and kept the whole coast of Arabia, the entrance to the Red Sea, and the northern coasts of India in alarm. In 1819 a second expedition was sent against them and they were destroyed. Low's Indian Navy, I. 310-366. Since 1700 (see above, p. 488) the character of the Joh\u00e1smis seems to have changed greatly for the worse. After a hard fight if they succeeded in boarding the enemy's vessel, they purified the ship with perfumes, and bound and brought forward the prisoners and cut their throats saying Allah Akbar. Wellsted's Arabia, I. 243-253.\n\n\\(^5\\) An expedition was sent against the M\u00e1lvan pirates in Ratn\u00e1giri in 1812 (Low's Indian Navy, I. 277); against Cutch and D\u00edv\u00e1rka in west K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r in 1815 and 1820 (Ditto, 280, 281), and against Maskat in 1809 and in 1819 (Ditto, I. 360-366).\n\n\\(^6\\) Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha Wars, 245.\n\n\\(^7\\) Of a revenue of 120 lakhs of rupees Bajir\u00e1v saved yearly about fifty lakhs, He had collected treasure exceeding fifty millions of rupees.

For his share in the murder of the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s envoy Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri, Trimbakji Denglia was imprisoned in the Th\u00e1na fort. He escaped on the 12th of September, and, with the connivance and help of the Peshwa, devoted himself to raising the wild tribes of Kh\u00e1ndesh and Ahmadnagar. During the next six months the Peshwa did his utmost to secure the support of the Mar\u00e1tha chiefs and of the Pendh\u00e1ris. As his hostility to the English was scarcely concealed, on the 6th of June 1817, the Peshwa was forced to enter into a fresh treaty. Under this treaty, which is known as the treaty of Poona, B\u00e1jir\u00e1v acknowledged that Trimbakji Denglia was the murderer of Gang\u00e1dhar Sh\u00e1stri, he bound himself to have no dealings with other states except through the British, and, as he had failed to maintain them, he agreed that the English should supply his share (5000 horse and 3000 foot) of the subsidiary force, and that fresh lands should be ceded to enable the English to support this new contingent. Among the territories ceded under this agreement were the districts of Bel\u00e1pur, \u00c1tgaon, and Kaly\u00e1n, and the rest of the North Konkan to Gujar\u00e1t.\n\nEarly in 1817, some months before the treaty of Poona was concluded, four bodies of Pendh\u00e1ris swept from the Deccan to plunder the Konkan. One body, six or seven hundred strong, was at Panvel, and, either this or another force, advanced to Bhiwndi, but were prevented by the rivers from passing into the rich coast districts of Bassein and M\u00e1l\u00edn. From Bhiwndi they marched through Asheri and T\u00e1r\u00e1spur to the Portuguese frontier. The people of the richer villages fled to the forests, and next year in some places only a few had come back. After the rains (November 1817); when he openly broke with the English and attempted to crush their detachment at Poona, the Peshwa let loose on the Konkan Trimbakji Denglia\u2019s hordes of Bhils and R\u00e1moshis. They held the Sahy\u00e1dri passes and entered Kaly\u00e1n, driving many of the people to take refuge in Bassein and M\u00e1luli. The Bombay troops kept the country between Panvel and Khopivli. But the Bhils held the Bor pass and despatches from General Smith, then near Poona, to the Commander-in-Chief in Bombay had to be sent by B\u00e1nkot. In December the Peshwa was close to the N\u00e1na pass and measures had to be taken to prevent his entering the Konkan. B\u00e1pur\u00e1v L\u00e1mbia, one of his supporters, took the fort of Kotaligad, about twelve miles east of Neral, but it was retaken without loss by Captain Brooks on the 30th of December. In January 1818 Colonel Prother, with a force of 380 Europeans, 800 Native Infantry, and a battering train, took the important forts of Karn\u00e1la, Rajm\u00e1chi, and Koari. The acquisition of the north Konkan was completed by Capt. Barrow\u2019s\n\n---\n\n1 Aitchison\u2019s Treaties, V. 64-71.\n2 The other cessions were the Peshwa\u2019s share of Gujar\u00e1t, the tribute of K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r, and the districts of Dh\u00e1rw\u00e1r and Kus\u00edgal.

As the bulk of the people were friendly the districts did not require a strong garrison. Th\u00e1na was maintained as a military station, and, for some years, detachments were kept at Panvel, (Kaly\u00e1n?), Bhiwandi, and Bassein. Of the inland forts Captain Dickinson, who was sent to survey them, considered Asheri, Malanggad, and M\u00e1lhuli impregnable, but from their isolated position useless. Of the Sahy\u00e1dri forts Gorakhgad near Murb\u00e1d, Kotaligad near Neral, and Sidgad near Gorakhgad, for a short time, were held by small detachments. The inner works of the rest of the inland forts were, as far as possible, destroyed. The coast forts, of which Arn\u00e1la and T\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00far were the chief, were in better order than the inland forts. They gave the people a feeling of security against pirates, and were allowed to remain untouched.\n\nDuring the rains of 1818 two important prisoners were kept in the north Konkan, Chimm\u00e1j\u00ed \u00c1ppa the Peshwa's brother at Bassein and Trimbak\u00ed Dengl\u00eda at Th\u00e1na. At the time of their transfer to the British, the Th\u00e1na districts for miles round the forts had scarcely an inhabitant. The few people were almost without tools; there was hardly a craftsman even of the humblest description. In other parts the people were poor and numbers of villages were empty. The forests were held by most degraded, almost savage, Kolis, Bhils, K\u00e1thkaris, and Th\u00e1kurs who lost no chance of plunder. There were two exceptions to the general wretchedness, Kaly\u00e1n whose villages were large and well-peopled and the country prosperous, and the garden of Bassein, where every inch of land was highly tilled, much of it under sugarcane, garden crops, and rice. From the Vaitarna north to the Damanganga was an excellent road, 'perhaps for its length (78 miles) unequalled by any in the world.' But the country had lately been pillaged by Pendh\u00e1ris. S\u00e1lsette, though so long under British management, was a striking contrast to the rich garden lands of Bassein. In the south the valleys were well tilled, but the greater part of the island lay empty and waste, almost wholly covered with brushwood. The revenue was about \u00a325,000 (Rs. 2,50,000), and the population estimated at 50,000. The people were excessively fond of liquor, but so quiet and orderly, that in 1813, for two years no native of the island had been committed for trial.\n\nDetails of the development of the district under British rule are given in the Chapters on Trade and on Land Administration. Since 1818 order has been well preserved. The chief exceptions are the Koli gang robbers who continued to trouble the district till about 1830; a Musalm\u00e1n and Hindu riot in Bhiwandi in 1837; the alarm and disquiet of the 1857 mutinies; an income-tax disturbance in Bassein in 1860; and two recent outbreaks of gang robberies in 1874 and in 1877.\n\n---\n\n1 Blue Book, Nairne's Konkan, 114.\n2 There was general joy in the districts that were handed over to the British, Pendh\u00e1ri and Mar\u00e1tha Wars, 112.\n3 Nairne's Konkan, 128.\n4 Nairne's Konkan, 117.\n5 Nairne's Konkan, 117.\n6 Nairne's Konkan, 118.\n7 Dickinson's Report.\n8 Nairne's Konkan, 126.\n9 Hamilton's Hindust\u00e1n, II. 150.\n10 Dickinson's Report.\n11 Dickinson's Report.\n12 \u00a323,580 (Rs. 2,35,800) in 1813.\n13 Hamilton's Hindust\u00e1n, II. 172.\nDuring the first twelve years of British rule the hill country both above and below the Sahy\u00e1dris, was infested with gangs of Bhil and Koli robbers. Their head-quarters were almost always in the Deccan, but their raids swept across the whole of Th\u00e1na, and caused widespread discomfort and alarm. The leading spirit was one R\u00e1mji Bh\u00e1ngria a Koli. For a time he was won from his wild life and placed in charge of the police of a sub-division. He proved an able officer, but resenting an order stopping his levy of gifts he withdrew from Government service. At the same time the pay and allowances of other leading Koli families were reduced, and many of them were thrown out of work by the dismantling of the forts. In spite of general discontent, the presence of British troops prevented an outbreak, till, in 1827, the Kolis learned that the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra R\u00e1moshis, who had been in revolt for three years, had gained all they had fought for. Judging that to show themselves formidable was the surest way of gaining redress, the Kolis, at the close of 1828, went out in revolt. Captain Mackintosh, who was put in charge of a body of police, found great difficulty in gaining news of their movements. In time he won over a certain number of Kolis, found the names of all persons likely to help the outlaws, and noted their favourite hiding and watering places. A large body of troops was collected. Some were posted in the Konkan and others along the crest of the Sahy\u00e1dris, and light parties, perpetually on the move, kept surprising the Kolis in their hiding places. So hot was the pursuit that the insurgents were forced to break into small parties. All the watering places were guarded, and, in a few months, the two chiefs and more than eighty of their followers were caught and marched into Ahmadnagar.\n\nThere has long been ill-feeling between the Musalm\u00e1ns and the Hindus of Bhiwndi. In April 1837 the Muharram chanced to fall at the same time as the Hindu festival of R\u00e1mn\u00e1vami, or R\u00e1ma\u2019s birth-day. The Musalm\u00e1ns determined not to allow the idol of Vithoba, the local representative of R\u00e1ma, to be carried about the streets during the ten days of the Muharram. On the 14th April, Vithoba\u2019s birth-day, when his image ought to have been carried through the town, the Musalm\u00e1ns gathered in front of his temple. The Hindus, fearing violence, gave up their procession and went to their homes. To be revenged on the Musalm\u00e1ns the V\u00e1n\u00ed\u00e1s agreed to close their shops, and the low class Hindus promised to take no part in the Muharram. Next day (15th April) the want of supplies irritated the Musalm\u00e1ns, and in the evening they were further enraged by finding that of their seven or eight Muharram biers or t\u00e1buts, only two could be moved, because the usual Hindu bearers refused to touch them and the Mah\u00e1rs would neither play music nor carry torches. According to the Musalm\u00e1n account, as the procession passed an empty house, the t\u00e1buts were battered with stones. On this the Musalm\u00e1ns broke into open riot, entered Vithoba\u2019s temple, stripped the idol of its jewels, broke some trellis work and images, and handled an old sickly Mah\u00e1r so roughly that he soon after died. Forty-eight\n\n1 Mackintosh in Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. I. 256-264.\nMusalmans were arrested, and twenty-one convicted and sentenced to long terms of imprisonment.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1840 a rising in the Th\u00e1na jail was speedily suppressed by a detachment of the fifteenth regiment of Native Infantry.\\(^2\\) In 1853, in consequence of an order forbidding the digging of pits for Holi fires in the high roads, the Hindu merchants of Th\u00e1na closed their shops. Police guards were set over the shops and the owners were compelled to open them and the opposition ceased.\\(^3\\)\n\nExcept that Vengao near Karjat was the birthplace of the infamous N\u00e1na S\u00e1heb, Th\u00e1na had no share in the 1857 mutinies. R\u00e1gho Vishvan\u00e1th, a relative of N\u00e1na S\u00e1heb\u2019s, who was found stirring up the people of Vengao, was arrested and confined in the Th\u00e1na jail. To prevent the spread of false or of damaging rumours, the editors of native newspapers were warned to make no statements of alleged mutinies without the permission of Government. In pursuance of orders to disarm the district, 997 arms were destroyed and 5204 registered. Armed parties passing through the district were disarmed, and the import or transport of brimstone, sulphur, and other warlike stores was forbidden. Passports were issued to strangers travelling through the district, and no Arabs were allowed to land at the ports.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn 1860 the levy of the income-tax met with considerable opposition. In Th\u00e1na, Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwndi, Panvel, and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, the people gathered, and, going to the leading Government officials, threw the income-tax forms on the ground and refused to take them. In these towns the leading men of the different communities were called together, the foolishness of the people\u2019s conduct was explained to them, and they were persuaded to take their own forms and induce others to take theirs. In Bassein the opposition was more general and better organised. On the 4th of December about 4000 people gathered in front of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s office, and threw down their notices and forms. The late Mr. Hunter of the Civil Service, the special income-tax officer, reached Bassein on the next day, and received from the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r a list of the men who had taken a leading part in the disturbance. Mr. Hunter, who was staying at the traveller\u2019s bungalow, asked the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r to send him the men whose names were entered in the list. They came accompanied by a great crowd. Mr. Hunter made the crowd sit down near the bungalow and spoke to them. They listened quietly and Mr. Hunter, hoping that he had brought them to a better mind, gave the leading men another opportunity of taking the income-tax forms. One of them, by name Govardhand\u00e1s, refused, and behaved with such insolence that Mr. Hunter ordered him into custody. On this the people grew unruly, forced their way into the house, and made such an uproar that Mr. Hunter, finding he had lost control of them, determined to retire to his boat. The house was three-quarters of a mile from the pier, and, on the way, egged on by Govardhand\u00e1s, the mob attacked\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. W. B. Mulock, C.

He reached the boat without much injury, but when his servants tried to push off, they were prevented by showers of stones and were kept in this position for three-quarters of an hour, when Mr. Hunter\u2019s clerk persuaded the people to let him go. Govardhand\u00e1s, the leader in the riot, was sentenced to a month\u2019s imprisonment and a fine of \u00a340 (Rs. 400).\n\nIn 1874 Honia Bh\u00e1goji Kenglia, a Koli of Jamburi in Poona, became the leader of a large band of robbers. A special party of police, under an European officer, was sent to hunt him, but he moved with such secrecy and speed that he remained at large for two years. At length, on the 15th of August 1876, Honia was caught near N\u00e1ndgaon in Karjat, and condemned to transportation for life. Most of his gang were shortly after seized and sentenced to heavy terms of imprisonment. In 1877, the gang robberies that were organised by V\u00e1sudev Balv\u00e1nt Phadke in Poona, and other parts of the Deccan, extended to Th\u00e1na. Several serious robberies were committed, the most notable being the sack of a rich Br\u00e1hman\u2019s house in Panvel. The fortunate surprise and death in May 1879 of the leader of this gang, by Major H. Daniell, prevented disorder from spreading. And, after the brilliant capture in July 1879 of V\u00e1sudev Balv\u00e1nt Phadke, also by Major H. Daniell at Deveh Nadige in Indi in Kal\u00e1dg\u00ed, order was soon restored.\n\nUnder British rule the trade of the district has developed from 411 l\u00e1khs of import and 330 of export in 1805 to 2357 l\u00e1khs of import and 2921 of export in 1881, an increase of about sevenfold. This trade, both by land and by sea, is almost entirely local. The foreign trade of the Th\u00e1na coast continues to centre in Bombay. The great increase, six hundred to eight hundredfold in the trade of Bombay since the beginning of the century, has not directly benefited the Th\u00e1na district. The passage of goods across the district by rail and the competition of steamers may even have taken from the cartmen and seamen of Th\u00e1na former means of employment. Still indirectly Th\u00e1na has gained. It is chiefly to the increase of work and the growth of population which have accompanied the development of trade in Bombay, that the Th\u00e1na district owes its advance in wealth and prosperity. The trade of Bombay furnishes employment for numbers of the upper classes as clerks and traders, and for numbers of the lower classes as craftsmen and labourers. Since 1820, the growth of Bombay has probably increased about sixfold the demand for the lime, stones, sand, tiles, and wood used in its buildings, and for the salt, grass, straw, grain, vegetables, fruit, and liquor consumed by its people and animals, perishable or bulky articles in the supply of which Th\u00e1na so favourably competes with more distant districts.\n\n1 Police Reports for 1879, Commissioner C. D.\u2019s Report, p. 9.\n2 A comparison of the average trade returns of Bombay during the five years ending 1881, with the corresponding average of the five years ending 1806, shows an increase in the value of exports from 282 l\u00e1khs to 2921 l\u00e1khs or 936 per cent; in the value of imports from 320 l\u00e1khs to 2357 l\u00e1khs or 637 per cent; and, in the total value of the trade from 602 l\u00e1khs to 5278 l\u00e1khs or 777 per cent.\n3 Compared with those for 1826 the census returns for 1881 show an increase from 1,32,570 to 7,73,196 or 483\u00b723 per cent in the people, and from 19,927 to 29,823 or 49\u00b766 per cent in the houses of the Town and Island of Bombay.\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nLAND ADMINISTRATION.\u00b9\n\nSECTION I.\u2014ACQUISITION, CHANGES, AND STAFF.\n\nOf the territories that form the district of Th\u00e1na, the islands of S\u00e1lsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja were conquered by the British at the close of 1774. In the following year Raghn\u00e1thr\u00e1v Peshwa, under the treaty of Surat, ceded Bassein and its dependencies. This cession was confirmed in 1778. But four years later, under the treaty of S\u00e1lbai (1782), Bassein and its dependencies were restored to the Peshwa, and the British possession of S\u00e1lsette, Elephanta, Hog Island, and Karanja was confirmed. The rest of the district was ceded by the Peshwa under the treaty of Poona in June 1817.\n\nIn 1817, on the acquisition of the Konkan, Th\u00e1na, which had been the civil station of S\u00e1lsette, became the head-quarters of the North Konkan, and at first B\u00e1nkot and in 1820 Ratn\u00e1giri became the headquarters of the South Konkan including Kol\u00e1ba. In 1830 Kol\u00e1ba, or the three sub-divisions north of the B\u00e1nkot creek, S\u00e1nkshi R\u00e1jpuri and R\u00e1ygad, were transferred from the South to the North Konkan, which was then raised to be a principal collectorate with the South Konkan as a subordinate collectorate.\u00b2 This arrangement lasted for only two years. In the beginning of 1833 these two divisions of the Konkan were, without territorial change, formed into the two collectorates of Th\u00e1na and Ratn\u00e1giri.\u00b3 Twenty years later\n\n\u00b9 Materials for the Administrative History of Th\u00e1na include, besides a paper on Tenures by Mr. W.

In 1841 Bhiwandi with Shirol was severed from Kaly\u00e1n and made a separate sub-division; Taloja was made a sub-division, which was subsequently in 1861 divided by the survey between Kaly\u00e1n and Panvel; and the greater portion of the T\u00e1r\u00e1pur petty division was taken from Sanj\u00e1n and joined to the newly formed sub-division of M\u00e1him. As regards the changes in 1866, S\u00e1lsette and Bassein alone remained untouched;\\(^3\\) the boundaries of Sanj\u00e1n, now styled D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, M\u00e1him, Bhiwandi, Murb\u00e1d, Kaly\u00e1n, and Panvel, were more or less altered; the V\u00e1da petty division was raised to be a sub-division; the Kinhabli petty division was abolished, part being added to Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur and part to Murb\u00e1d; the Kolvan sub-division was styled Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur and the Mokh\u00e1da petty division was made subordinate to it; fourteen villages from Panvel and as many from Nasr\u00e1pur, now styled Karj\u00e1t, were transferred to the S\u00e1nkshi sub-division of Kol\u00e1ba; the S\u00e1i petty division in Panvel was abolished; and Uran, which had been separated from S\u00e1lsette in 1861, was placed under Panvel.\\(^4\\)\n\nThe present (1882) sub-divisions are, beginning from the north D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, M\u00e1him, V\u00e1da, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, Bhiwandi, Bassein, S\u00e1lsette, Kaly\u00e1n, Murb\u00e1d, Karj\u00e1t, and Panvel.\n\nThe revenue administration of the district is entrusted to an officer styled Collector on a yearly pay of \u00a32790 (Rs. 27,900). This officer, who is also Political Agent, chief magistrate, district registrar, and executive head of the district, is helped in his work of general supervision by a staff of four assistants of whom two are covenanted and two uncovenanted servants of Government. The sanctioned yearly salaries of the covenanted assistants range from \u00a3600 to \u00a31200 (Rs. 6000-Rs. 12,000) and those of the uncovenanted assistants from \u00a3360 to \u00a3720 (Rs. 3600-Rs. 7200).\\(^5\\)\n\nFor fiscal and other administrative purposes the lands under the Collector's charge are distributed over eleven sub-divisions. Eight of these are generally entrusted to the covenanted assistant collectors and three to the uncovenanted assistant or district deputy collector. As a rule no sub-division is kept by the Collector under his own direct supervision. The head-quarter or hazur deputy collector is entrusted with the charge of the treasury. These officers are also magistrates, and those who have revenue\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gov. of India's Order 2367, 1st October 1852.\n\n\\(^2\\) Gov. Notification, 10th July 1869.\n\n\\(^3\\) Gov.

These functionaries who are also entrusted with magisterial powers have yearly salaries varying from \u00a3180 to \u00a3300 (Rs. 1800 - Rs. 3000). Four of the fiscal sub-divisions contain petty divisions, pet\u00e1s or mah\u00e1ls, under the charge of officers styled mah\u00e1lkaris, who, except that they have no treasury to superintend save in the petty divisions of Mokh\u00e1da and Umbargaon, exercise the revenue and magisterial powers generally entrusted to a m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r. The mah\u00e1lkaris' yearly pay varies from \u00a372 to \u00a396 (Rs. 720 - Rs. 960).\n\nIn revenue and police matters the charge of the 2114 Government villages is entrusted to 2256 headmen or p\u00e1t\u00eds, of whom 145 are stipendiary and 2111 hereditary. Of the stipendiary headmen, five perform police duties only and 140 police and revenue duties. Of the hereditary headmen 174 perform revenue, 50 perform police, and 1887 perform revenue and police duties. The headmen's yearly emoluments, which are in proportion to the revenue of the village, consist partly of cash payments and partly of remission of assessment on land and palm trees. The cash emoluments vary from 1\u00bdd. to \u00a313 3s. 6d. (11 pies - Rs. 131-12) and average about \u00a31 16s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 18-3-3), while the remissions from land and palm assessment together range from \u00bdd. to \u00a35 15s. 10\u00bdd. (3 pies - Rs. 57-15-3) and average about 7s. 5d. (Rs. 3-11-4). Of \u00a34942 (Rs. 49,420) the total yearly charge on account of village headmen, \u00a34105 (Rs. 41,050) are paid in cash and \u00a3837 (Rs. 8370) are met by grants of land and by remissions of assessment on land and on palm trees.\n\nTo keep the village accounts, draw up statistics, and help the village headmen, there is a body of 314 village accountants or tal\u00e1tis. All of these village accountants are stipendiary. Each has an average charge of about seven villages, containing about 2890 inhabitants and yielding an average yearly revenue of about \u00a3440 (Rs. 4400). Their yearly pay varies from \u00a312 to \u00a321 12s. (Rs. 120 - Rs. 216) and averages about \u00a317 13s. 5d. (Rs. 176-11-4). It amounts to a total cost of \u00a35549 (Rs. 55,490).\n\nUnder the headmen and accountants are the village servants, with a total strength of 2544. Those men are liable both for revenue and for police duties. They are Hindus generally of the Koli and Mh\u00e1r castes. The total yearly grant for the support of this establishment amounts to \u00a32144 (Rs. 21,440), being 16s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 8-6-10) to each man, or a cost to each village of \u00a31 0s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 10-2-3). Of this charge \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) are met by grants of land and \u00a31744 (Rs. 17,440) are paid in cash.\n\n---\n\n1 P\u00e1t\u00edl apparently pattakil, or plate, that is lease, holder is probably a Dravidian word. In the 2114 villages are included 38 iz\u00e1fat or special service, 4 vatan or service, and 12 shar\u00e1kat\u00ed or share villages.\nIn alienated villages the village officers and servants are paid by the alienses and perform police duties for Government.\n\nThe average yearly cost of village establishments may be thus summarised:\n\n| Thana Village Establishments |\n|-----------------------------|\n| \u00a3     | Rs.   |\n| Headmen ... ... ... ...    | 4942 | 49,420 |\n| Accountants ... ... ... ... | 5649 | 56,490 |\n| Servants ... ... ... ...    | 2144 | 21,440 |\n| Total ... ... ... ...       | 12,635 | 1,26,350 |\n\nThis is equal to a charge of \u00a35 19s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 59-12-3) a village, or 9\u00b715 per cent of the whole of the district land revenue.\u00b9\n\nSECTION II.\u2014TENURES.\u00b2\n\nThe tenures of the district belong to two main classes, survey and special tenures. By far the largest part of the district is held on the survey tenure of ownership with power to transfer, subject to the payment of a rent which is liable to revision at the end of thirty years.\n\nWhen a survey-holder does not himself till the land he sublets it either on the half-share or ardhel, or on the contract or khand system. Under the ardhel or half-share, which is the most common form of subletting, the survey occupant pays the Government assessment and contributes half the seed and one bullock for the plough, and in return he takes half the gross produce, including half of the straw at harvest time. The tenant supplies the labour, half of the seed, and the second bullock. This system is commonest in the wilder inland tracts, where the tenant is too poor to undertake the whole responsibility of cultivation. This is also the usual arrangement during the first couple of years after new land has been broken for tillage or reclaimed from salt waste.\n\nThe contract system is called khand, or makta, and is also known as the farmer\u2019s share system or sv\u00e1mitva. Under it the survey occupant pays the Government assessment and sublets the land on condition of receiving a share called sv\u00e1mitva, which varies in different parts of the district from six to twelve mans the acre. The tenant provides seed, plough, bullocks, labour, and manure, except such bush-loppings and grass as he may cut from the holder\u2019s upland.\n\nThe special tenures may be arranged under two groups, those that almost entirely ceased on the introduction of the revenue survey and those that are still continued. Of the special forms of tenure that have almost entirely merged in the revenue survey\n\n\u00b9 The cost of village establishments, except the pay of the accountants who receive fixed monthly salaries, is liable to variation in consequence of the confiscation or escheat of service lands or of the commutation of a land into a cash allowance. But such changes are rare. The figures in the text fairly represent the average strength and cost of village establishments.\n\n\u00b2 Most of this section is contributed by Mr. W. B. Mulock, C.S., Collector of Thana, September 1881.\ntenure details are given later on in the Administrative History. Briefly they are the *dhep* or lump also called the *taka*, *toka*, or *hon*,\u00b9 the *k\u00e1s* or estate, the *n\u00e1ngarbandi* or plough system, the *suti* or special remission settlement, and the *p\u00e1ndharpesha* or high-class villagers' settlement.\n\nUnder the *dhep* or lump system, which seems to have been handed down from very early times, a certain quantity of grain was paid for an unmeasured plot or lump of land. A modification of this system was found in Kolvan, now V\u00e1da and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur including Mokh\u00e1da. Under this modification, the land was divided into unmeasured plots of mixed rice and upland, each known as a *k\u00e1s* or estate.\u00b2 A plough cess or *n\u00e1ngarbandi* was also in force in the wilder parts of the district. Under it a husbandman could till as much land as he pleased and as long as he pleased, provided he paid a certain amount of grain on every pair of bullocks he used.\u00b3\n\nIn 1870, in the case known as the One Teak Tree Case, \u00c1tm\u00e1r\u00e1m Tipnis against the Collector of Th\u00e1na, the plaintiff claimed that as a holder under the *suti* tenure, he had proprietary rights in the land he held, and that these rights included the ownership of all trees on his holding. The claim was thrown out both by the assistant and by the District Judge. On appeal the case was returned by the High Court to the District Judge for re-trial. The District Judge then decided that a *sutidd\u00e1r*, or holder under the *suti* tenure, was a proprietor, and, under rule ten of the Joint Rules, he had a right to the possession of the trees in his land, and could dispose of them as he pleased. Government employed Mr. A. K. Nairne, C.S., then first assistant collector, who had a special knowledge of Konkan land-tenures, to investigate the history of the *suti* tenure. The result of Mr. Nairne's inquiries was to show that the *suti* tenure carried, with it no special right to transfer land or dispose of trees. Mr. Nairne\u2074 showed that the term *suti* was very rarely used in the\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 MS. Sel. 160, 711-714; Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 867 of 1838, 289.\n\u00b2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 417. 'The *k\u00e1sbandi* is now (1881) in force only in thirteen villages in Mokh\u00e1da. Under it the rice lands were broken into separate survey and part numbers, while the upland was measured into one large survey number. A share of this upland together with the rice land in his occupation was roughly measured by chain and entered as the owner's holding or *kh\u00e1tta*, but it was not made into a separate number. Neither description of land can be held or thrown up independently of the other. The *k\u00e1sbandi* and plough-cess or *n\u00e1ngarbandi* systems of Mokh\u00e1da, which at the introduction of the survey (1865) were continued for ten years, are to be replaced as soon as possible by the ordinary field survey under Government Resolution 2788 of 28th May 1879.' Mr. Mulock, C. S.\n\u00b3 'This *n\u00e1ngarbandi* system obtains (1881) in twenty-three villages in Karjat, in sixty-seven villages in Mokh\u00e1da, and in a few villages in Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur. Under it the rice lands were measured, classified, and allotted, while the upland of the village was left in one large number, and the assessment levied at a rate varying from 6s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 3-Rs. 12) for each plough. In Karjat in the south and in Mokh\u00e1da in the north-east, there is (1881) a tenure which was recognised at the time of the survey and called by the Survey Superintendent *dalli* cultivation (Gov. Sel. XCVI. 13, 421). The assessment is levied on the *kud\u00e1l*, or hoe, of those who are too poor to own a plough and bullocks. The land thus tilled is found along the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds in the hands of Kolis, Th\u00e1kurs, and K\u00e1thkaris; the tax on each hoe is 1s. 6d. (as. 12).' Mr. Mulock, C. S.\n\u2074 These details are taken from a printed paper by Mr. Nairne, showing all the rights known to exist in the North Konkan over teak and blackwood in Government villages and lands.\nold British records; that when it did occur it was explained as an hereditary occupancy right subject to the payment of the Government rental; that it did not carry with it the right to transfer the land; and that it was limited to rice lands and did not extend to hill-grain or varkas lands. It was less favourable to the landholder than the survey tenure, and disappeared on the introduction of the survey settlement. The people still speak of rice land held under the survey tenure as suti, and sutid\u00e1r is used with the same meaning as kh\u00e1ted\u00e1r or survey occupant. On receipt of Mr. Nairne\u2019s report Government (Resolution 6646 of 27th November 1875) expressed their regret that it was not before them when they determined not to appeal against the District Judge\u2019s decision. Since 1875, section 40 of the Land Revenue Code has settled that, unless teak blackwood or sandalwood has been expressly and clearly conceded, the right of Government is indisputable.\n\nFormerly some of the higher classes of villagers, who represented themselves or their ancestors as the original reclaimers of the land from waste, were allowed to hold their land at specially low rates. These classes were known as p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, that is the villagers proper. They included Br\u00e1hmans, Prabhus, Goldsmiths, Blacksmiths, Coppersmiths, Carpenters, Saddlers, and others who did not themselves till the soil. To make up for the special expense they incurred in hiring labour, they were allowed to hold their lands at specially easy rates. The practice is said to have been older than the time of the Peshw\u00e1s. Under the British the question of continuing or putting a stop to these privileges has given rise to much difference of opinion. These opinions, which are noted below in the Administrative History, may be shortly summarised. In 1820 Government agreed to continue to the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s their specially easy rates. But in 1823, at the first settlement of the district, they decided that, with certain reservations, the practice of taking specially low rates from privileged classes should be abolished. This order was not enforced. In 1825 the Collector brought the matter to the notice of Government and the orders of 1823 were repeated. In 1826 a second attempt to carry them out met with so much opposition that it was abandoned by Sir John Malcolm in 1828. It was then decided that those who had held as p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s at the beginning of British rule should have their privileges confirmed. Prescription and usage were to be considered\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. W. B. Mulock, C. S. Mr. Nairne does not explain the meaning of the word suti. It apparently means exempt or remitted. Mr. Ebden suggests the probable explanation of the word, namely, that it originated in Trimbak Vin\u00e1yak\u2019s survey which introduced acre, or bigha, rates with the concession known as \u2018sav\u00e1i suti,\u2019 or the one and a quarter remission, that is instead of one and a quarter only one bigha was entered in the books (see Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI, 78). This one and a quarter remission was one of the privileges claimed by the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s. This explanation supports Mr. Nairne\u2019s view that the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s were sutidd\u00e1s with special privileges. Mr. Nairne\u2019s Paper, page 6 para. 8.\n\n2 Gov.

The claims of those who could be proved to have assumed the place of p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s since the beginning of British rule were to be disregarded. The privilege was deemed to be personal. It was allowed to pass to the holder's heirs, but not to the purchaser if the land was sold. In 1836, when engaged in his great revision and reduction of rates, Mr. Davies urged that the privileges of the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s should be continued. Other classes had gained by the establishment of order under the British. But the upper classes had suffered from the loss of civil and military employment, from the prohibition of slavery, and from the want of field labour. Mr. Davies held, and in this he was supported by Mr. Williamson the Revenue Commissioner, that the p\u00e1ndharpesha privilege was to pay lower rates than the actual cultivators paid, a short rate, or kam dar, as opposed to the full rate, or bhar dar. The special privilege was continued in Panvel and in Nasr\u00e1pur or Karjat. But Government held that the distinction between short and full rates was odious in principle and not desirable in practice. Government had no wish to raise the rates paid by the privileged holders to the level of those paid by ordinary husbandmen. But they held that the fact that Government saw fit to lower the husbandman's rates did not give the privileged classes any claim to a proportional reduction in their rates. Accordingly in the revisions of Kaly\u00e1n and Taloja the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s were not allowed a specially low rate. Their claim that, wherever reduction was made in the rates paid by the regular husbandmen, a like reduction should be made in their rates, was thus finally decided against the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s.\n\nDuring the introduction of the revenue survey (1852-1866) another point was raised. If the new survey rates proved higher than the former p\u00e1ndharpesha payments, must the demand be limited to the former payment, or could the increased rates be levied? Captain Francis held that the increase could not fairly be levied, and proposed that the former rate of payment should be continued as a j\u00fadi or quit-rent. From this view Captain Wingate (682, 16th September 1853) differed. He held that the p\u00e1ndharpesha privileges were purely presumptive and personal; it was within the power of Government to stop them when they chose. He held that the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s were more able to pay the survey rates than ordinary kunbis were, and saw no reason why their exemption should be continued. If Government deemed it advisable to make a concession, he thought that, where they were lighter than the survey rates, the old rates might be continued for ten years. The Collector, Mr. Seton Karr, thought no exemption even of a temporary nature should be made in favour of the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s. Government did not agree with Captain Wingate or Mr. Seton Karr. The privileges\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 365 of 25th March 1828, in Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 24.\n2 Bom. Gov. Rev.

The matter was referred for the opinion of the Legal Remembrancer and the Alienation Commissioner.\n\nAt the introduction of the survey into Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur in 1855 and into Karjat in 1856, p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s who paid less than the survey rates were allowed to continue their former payments on condition that the privilege was to cease with the expiry of the survey lease, and that, in case of death or transfer, the land was to be subjected to the full assessment. Government in reviewing the Karjat settlement (Resolution 1700 of 9th April 1857) stated that the question of p\u00e1ndharpesha remissions was still under the consideration of the Alienation Department. No mention of p\u00e1ndharpesha claims occurs in the survey reports of Panvel (1856). In Kaly\u00e1n (1859) and in Murb\u00e1d (1860) their claims were urged and disallowed. On the 5th February 1859, a resolution (No. 476) was issued directing the Superintendent of survey in future to levy a proportionate increase from p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s as from other landholders. Districts already settled were not to be affected by this order. The Revenue Commissioner in his 1567A of 4th June 1864 brought to notice that only in Nasr\u00e1pur had an erroneous settlement been made, and requested that matters should be rectified. Government in their Resolution 2467 of 29th June 1864, and the Secretary of State in his Despatch 25 of 25th April 1865, approved of this suggestion, and the Commissioner of survey (328 dated 23rd October 1865) reported that the necessary changes had been made and that the amount remitted to the pandharpesh\u00e1s had been reduced from \u00a3233 to \u00a321 (Rs. 2330-Rs. 210). Subsequently the Revenue Commissioner (3780 of 2nd November 1865) found that the remission was only \u00a318 (Rs. 180) which was distributed over 167 holdings. Government (Resolution 4785 of 23rd November 1865) directed that until the revision of the survey settlement the remission should be continued where it was above one rupee. When less than a rupee the yearly remission was to be converted into a lump payment equal to the annual remission during the remainder of the survey lease. Almost all the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, who were entitled to remissions of less than a rupee, took twenty years' purchase, and thus a large number of these claims were extinguished. The Secretary of State signified his assent to this arrangement in his Despatch 16 of 16th March 1867. In Karjat and Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur alone is a remission, sav\u00e1i sut, still allowed to these higher classes, and the whole amount remitted is only \u00a314 (Rs. 140). This amount steadily decreases and all vestige of special privilege will disappear at the revision settlement which will take place in a few years (1883-85).\n\nOf tenures different from the survey tenures, besides grant or in\u00e1m lands held either rent-free or on the payment of a quit-rent, there are four local varieties, the service or vatan, the special service or iz\u00e1fat, the embankment or shilotri, and the leasehold improperly termed khoti.\n\n---\n\n1 Gov.

Soon after the acquisition of the district by the British, a proclamation was issued (1st December 1819) calling on all who had titles to rent-free or quit-rent land to produce and register them. In 1827 clause 8 section 42 of Regulation XVII. of 1827 prescribed that, as the proclamation mentioned in clause 5 had been issued in the Northern Konkan, no deed which had not been registered within one year after the proclamation should be held by the Collector or by any court of justice to preclude the assessment of land in the manner specified in clause 6. A number of deeds were registered, inquiries regarding many claims to exemption were held, and decisions were passed under Chapters IX. and X. of the Regulation. Nevertheless, on the holders of all of these villages,\n\n\u00b9 In Panvel, Shirdhon, Kushivli, and N\u00e1ndgaon, granted in 1862-63 to the G\u00e1ikw\u00e1r\u2019s Div\u00e1n R\u00e1o S\u00e1heb Ganesh S\u00e1d\u00e1shiv Oze for his services during the 1857 mutiny; and P\u00e1nja and Dongri granted in 1834-35 to a pensioned m\u00e1n\u00e1t\u00e1d\u00e1r of S\u00e1lsette Mr. Manoel de Souza.

These villages, which yielded an estimated yearly revenue of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000), had been granted by \u00c1ngria to his minister Vin\u00e1yak Parashr\u00e1m. On the lapse of the Kol\u00e1ba state in 1840, Mr. Davies the Political Agent found that, under a new deed dated 1826-27, the grant to the minister had been raised to \u00a32671 (Rs. 26,710).

The holders of four of these villages, Dongasta in V\u00e1da, Kulgaon in Kaly\u00e1n, Mulgaon in Kaly\u00e1n, and Chindhran in Panvel, demanded an inquiry into their titles, which in every case resulted in a decision in favour of the continuance of their exemption. The proprietors of three villages, Tis in Kaly\u00e1n, Kanheri in Bhiwandi, and Phena in Bhiwandi, have alone received title-deeds or sanads. The remaining title-deeds were not granted owing to the difficulty of calculating the quit-rent, or judi, under the Summary Settlement Act on forest lands which have not been assessed by the survey. The question of assessing forest lands under Rule 2 Section 6 of the Act is still under consideration, and until the matter is settled no deeds can be issued for villages which contain forests.\n\nThe in\u00e1md\u00e1rs\u00b2 of forty-one\u00b3 of the villages have signed an agreement in the form given in footnote 3 below. The legal effect of these agreements is doubtful, but the records show that they were not in all cases taken in acknowledgment of the in\u00e1md\u00e1rs' rights but merely as a token of their consent to agree to this form of settlement, in the event of its being decided that they were entitled to be offered the summary settlement in respect of the forest.\u2074 None of the in\u00e1m villages have been surveyed excepting N\u00e1nala in S\u00e1lsette. In other cases the quit-rent paid is one-eighth of the approximate survey assessment of the village together with the former or original quit-rent. In most in\u00e1m villages there are old occupants whose rents are not raised. Tenants taking new land hold on the yearly or eks\u00e1li tenure, and they pay rents fixed by the in\u00e1md\u00e1r which are generally about the same as the rates prevailing in the surrounding Government villages. In\u00e1md\u00e1rs take their rents either murk\u00e1bandi or mudkebandi, also known as mud\u00e1bandi that is a certain share of each muda of grain; or dhephbandi that is a certain amount of grain levied on a lump area; or bigh\u00e1vni that is a certain bigha rate. As a rule cash is taken in place of grain.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 Notice was issued, but it was cancelled because the In\u00e1m Commissioner had already inquired into and admitted the claim. Mr. E. J. Ebden, C.S.\n\n\u00b2 Nos. 2-4, 6-14, 20, 24-31, 34, 35, 37, 39, 41, 42, 44, 45, 49, 50, 52, 54, 55, 59, 62, 67, 68, 70, 71, and 73 in footnote 3, p. 556. The proprietor of Talegaon (63) in Panvel did not sign the form of agreement. He sent an expression of his readiness to pay 'one-eighth of the produce according to the Government order.' Mr. E. J. Ebden, C.S.\n\n\u00b3 In a few cases one man holds two or three villages and passed one agreement for the lot. Mr. E. J. Ebden, C.S. The form of agreement is as follows: To the Collector of Th\u00e1na; I, \u2014\u2014\u2014 in\u00e1md\u00e1r of \u2014\u2014\u2014 village, pass this written agreement to the effect that, as I cannot agree with Government as to the value of the forests of the said village on the proceeds of which one-eighth is to be levied as summary settlement under Bombay Act VII. of 1863, I agree under the following conditions to pay one-eighth on the proceeds remaining after deducting one-third on account of protecting the forests, whenever cuttings take place. Prior to cutting the forests I will inform Government by detailed petition as to the description of forests to be cut and the period within which the cutting is to be effected. I will give passes with the timber in such form as may be ordered. In case of removal without a pass the timber may be considered Government property. I will show to Government the actual receipts from forests, and will keep such accounts in connection therewith as may be directed by Government. I thus pass this agreement to the above effect. Signed \u2014\u2014\u2014 In\u00e1md\u00e1r.\ncondition of the occupants in in\u00e1m villages does not greatly differ from the condition of landholders in Government villages. About one-third of the in\u00e1md\u00e1rs are in debt, and have mortgaged or sold their estates. The frequency with which they apply to the revenue authorities for assistance, under section 86 of the Land Revenue Code, seems to show that they find much difficulty in collecting their rents.\n\nFor detached pieces of in\u00e1m land under Bombay Act VII. of 1863, six hundred title deeds have been issued for personal grants, j\u00e1t in\u00e1ms, and eight hundred and fifty-six for charitable and religious grants, dharm\u00e1daya and devasth\u00e1n in\u00e1ms.\u00b9\n\nThirty-five title deeds for personal and charitable grants have still to be issued, exclusive of those for entire villages.\n\nFrom returns received by Government in 1861, it appeared that the value of the grants, or vatans, of hereditary district officers amounted over the whole Presidency to \u00a3130,000 (Rs. 13,00,000) or more than double the cost of the stipendiary establishments. The portion of these grants received by individuals actually performing service was little more than one-fifth. The rest was enjoyed without any return to the state.\u00b2\n\nThe grants or vatans consisted of cash and land in about the proportion of six to seven; four-fifths of the portion received by those actually serving was cash. Government in return for an expenditure on hereditary service grants double the amount spent in maintaining stipendiaries, received the service of a body of persons three-fifths of whom were under-paid hirelings unconnected with the grantee and with no special motives for zeal or good conduct. The right of Government to receive important service from the hereditary district officers in return for their emoluments had always been recognized. But, during the early years of British rule, it was feared that, by utilizing hereditary officers to any extent, undue power would be thrown into their hands and would be used to the injury and oppression of the people. As information regarding the country was collected and the power to counteract the injurious influences of the hereditary district officers increased, the rights of Government as regards service were pressed more or less in all collectorates. On the other hand, the introduction of the revenue survey settlements rendered nearly useless the services which these hereditary officers had hitherto rendered. Government Resolution 720, dated 7th March 1863, appointed Mr. Stewart Gordon President, and the Honorable M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Vithal Vinchurkar and R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Keshav R\u00e1mchandra Jog members of a commission to settle the rights of Government and to hear the objections of the district officers to\n\n\u00b9 Th\u00e1na Grants, Title Deeds.\n\n| Sub-Division | Personal | Religious |\n|--------------|----------|-----------|\n| D\u00e1h\u00e1nu       | 50       | 66        |\n| M\u00e1lhm        | 150      | 133       |\n| V\u00e1da         | 5        | 1         |\n| Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur     | 22       | 44        |\n|              |          |           |\n| Murb\u00e1d       | 3        | 23        |\n| Kaly\u00e1n       | 96       | 133       |\n| Bhiw\u00e1di      | 40       | 75        |\n| H\u00e1s\u00e9in       | 146      | 84        |\n|              |          |           |\n| S\u00e1sette      | 4        | 61        |\n| Panvel       | 28       | 127       |\n| Karj\u00e1t       | 58       | 109       |\n| Total        | 600      | 856       |\n\n\u00b2 Gov. Res. of 13th June 1861.\na scheme proposed for commuting service by the district officers foregoing a certain portion of their emoluments. The terms to be offered by the commission were to vary according to the circumstances of each district. But the general principle was the continuance of emoluments in land and cash, after deducting a chauth\u00e1\u00ed or one-fourth in commutation of service to those who agreed to abandon all but a nominal right to serve. All perquisites or lazima haks, levied in kind from the people, were abolished on the introduction of the settlement. Those who declined to abandon their right to serve were to be called on to render a fair amount of service corresponding to the value of their grants.\n\nIn Th\u00e1na district hereditary officers were found only in M\u00e1him, Kolvan, Murb\u00e1d, Kayl\u00e1n, Bh\u00edwandi, Panvel, and Nasr\u00e1pur. The emoluments in cash and land of ninety-four officers, deshmulkhs, deshp\u00e1ndes, d\u00e9s\u00e1\u00eds, chaudhris, adhik\u00e1r\u00eds, sarp\u00e1tils, sarkhots, kulkarn\u00eds, and th\u00e1nges or kulkarn\u00eds' messengers, amounted after deducting the quit-rent to \u00a34978 (Rs. 49,780). In return for this, on the basis of the payments made by the grants to clerks and others acting for them, it was calculated that service worth \u00a31161 (Rs. 11,610) was rendered. The cases of these ninety-four officers were settled by the commission who decided to take five annas in the rupee, or a sum total of \u00a31555 (Rs. 15,550) in commutation of service.\n\nNo title deeds or sanads have yet been issued under the Gordon settlement, but Government have ruled, Resolution 2915 of 23rd May 1881, that the conditions of the title deeds to be issued to the grantees of Th\u00e1na are those set forth in a report by Mr. Naylor and printed in the preamble to Government Resolution 6018, dated 25th October 1875, under which the grant is to be continued so long as any male heir, lineal collateral or adopted, remains within the limits of the grantee's family. This settlement has been recognised by section 15 of Bombay Act III. of 1874. A special officer Mr. Vishnu R\u00e1mcandra is now (1882) employed in issuing hereditary service title deeds or vatan sanads.\n\nBesides parts of villages, four entire villages have been granted\n\n---\n\n1 Government Resolution 1029 of 21st March 1866.\n2 Government Resolution 3904 of 20th October 1881. The following is the form of hereditary service title-deed or vatan sanad: Whereas in the district of _______ certain lands and cash allowances are entered in the Government accounts of the year 18____ as held on service tenure as follows [name of the vatan, land assessment, cash allowances, and total emoluments after deducting original quit-rent], and whereas the holders thereof have agreed to pay to Government a fixed annual payment in lieu of service, It is hereby declared that the said lands and cash allowances shall be continued hereditarily by the British Government, on the following conditions: that is to say, that the said holders and their heirs shall continue faithful subjects of the British Government, and shall render to the same the following fixed yearly dues: Original quit-rent, rupees _______, in lieu of service rupees _______, total rupees _______. In consideration of the fulfilment of which conditions (1st) The said lands and cash allowances shall be continued without demand of service, and without increase of land tax over the above fixed amounts, and without objection or question on the part of Government as to the rights of any holders thereof, so long as any male heir to the vatan, lineal, collateral, or adopted, within the limits of the valand\u00e1r family, shall be in existence. (2nd) No succession fee or nazar\u00e1na or other demand on the part of Government will be imposed on account of the succession of heirs, lineal, collateral, or adopted, within the limits of the valand\u00e1r family, and permission to make such adoptions need not hereafter be obtained from Government. (3rd) When all the sharers of the vatan agree to request it, the general privilege of\nin return for hereditary service, Nagaon in M\u00e1him, Tilgaon in V\u00e1da, and Vadhap and Hedavli in Karjat. In the case of these villages Government forewent the services of the grantees, and instead of service, levied five annas in the rupee on the revenues of the villages. Besides to these four villages, as is noticed later on, the service settlement was applied by mistake to eight villages held under the special service tenure known as iz\u00e1fat; but Government have cancelled the vatan settlement with respect to these. Two-thirds of the share or shar\u00e1kati village of Anjur and half of the shar\u00e1kati village of H\u00e1tnoli have also been subjected to the same settlement. Forest rights in service or vatan villages are determined in each case by the agreements passed. Thus in 1866 the holder of Tilgaon passed an agreement to pay five annas on its forest cuttings; in 1854 the holder of Vadhap passed an agreement to take a third share of the forest cuttings as payment for protection; and, in 1870, the holder of Hedavli passed an agreement to pay to Government a six-anna share of the proceeds of its cuttings.\n\nThe forest agreements passed in the cases of the seven iz\u00e1fat villages are mentioned later on under iz\u00e1fat.\n\nShar\u00e1kati or share villages are villages whose revenues are divided between Government and a private holder, or between two private holders. Of twelve shar\u00e1kati villages, seven are part private or in\u00e1m and part Government; three are part private and part special service tenure or iz\u00e1fat; and two are part ordinary service or vatan and part Government.\n\nadopting at any time any person (without restriction as to family), who can be legally adopted, will be granted by Government to the vatan, on the payment from that time forward in perpetuity of an annual succession fee or nazard\u00e1na of one anna in each rupee of the above total emoluments of the vatan.

Under the Ahmadnagar kings, a practice probably handed down from pre-Musalm\u00e1n times, the services of hereditary district officers were rewarded by the grant of villages free of rent. Under the early Ahmadnagar rulers these officers seem to have also been revenue contractors. But, in the beginning of the seventeenth century, under Malik Ambar\u2019s settlement, they ceased to be revenue contractors and acted only as district officers. At the same time they were continued in the enjoyment of their rent-free villages. Under the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s (1720) the system was changed. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s found that the only well-managed villages were those held rent-free by the hereditary officers. They accordingly changed their pay to a percentage, 6\u00b769 per cent, of their collections, and levied the full rental from the former rent-free villages. At the same time they allowed the officers to continue to style the former rent-free villages *iz\u00e1fat*, and to keep the position of village holders. Under the farming system, in the later Mar\u00e1tha days (1800-1817) when the old survey rates were disregarded, the district hereditary officers lost their importance, their power and their duties ceased, and their claims on the revenue were divided and sold to many families, Br\u00e1hmans, Prabhus, and Musalm\u00e1ns. The English found these officers almost useless and their pay scattered and broken.\n\nOn the English acquisition of the district 124 *iz\u00e1fat* villages, found in the hands of hereditary officers, were resumed and managed by Government. In 1830 the Principal Collector reported that twenty of these *iz\u00e1fat* villages had been restored, and that he proposed to restore the rest. He stated that these villages formed part of the lands granted to hereditary officers, and that under the Mar\u00e1tha government had the holders wished to give them up on account of their not producing the full revenue, they were not allowed to do so, but the full rent was deducted from the amount payable by Government to them on account of their claims on the general revenue. Acting on this view, in Resolution 4010 of 12th December 1831, Government directed that the villages should be restored. But most *iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs* declined to take them back. In 1856, on the introduction of the survey into Nasr\u00e1pur now Karjat, the Superintendent of survey suggested that the holders of *iz\u00e1fat* villages should be allowed to choose or to refuse the survey settlement. On the other hand, the Collector held that as the villages were not generally conferred under special deed, as they were resumable by\n\n---\n\n1 *Iz\u00e1fat* villages are villages whose rents have been set apart as the payment of zamind\u00e1rs, that is *deshmukhs* and *deshp\u00e1ndes*.

Government do not appear to have passed definite orders on the subject, but, when the question arose at the settlement of Panvel at the close of the same year, under Resolution 1127 of 5th April 1859, they sanctioned the grant of a lease on the terms of the survey.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn 1859 the matter was referred to the Revenue Commissioner for Alienations, who directed the Collector of Th\u00e1na to call on the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs of Panvel for proof of their having held their villages at a fixed rental. They failed to bring forward any proof, and in 1859, when the survey settlement was introduced into Kaly\u00e1n, the Superintendent of survey expressed the opinion that the option which had been allowed to iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs of taking or refusing the survey settlement required reconsideration as no such privilege had been conferred at former settlements, but revisions of assessment had invariably been extended to their villages. On this Government, in a Resolution 2662 of 9th July 1859, decided that the iz\u00e1fat villages of the Konkan were held on condition of paying the full assessment, that, as regards assessment, they were precisely in the same position as any other village or lands, and that there was no objection to the Collector's enforcing the assessment.\n\nIn 1860, when the settlement was extended to Murb\u00e1d, the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs refused the terms offered to the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs of other parts of the district. The Superintendent of survey suggested that they should be offered a lease of thirty years, and, in villages where all the lands were let to tenants at full survey rates, as they had no remuneration, they were to be allowed ten per cent for the management of the village, the amount to be deducted from the survey rental in preference to having it shown as a cash payment. This lenient treatment of the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs' claims was sanctioned by Government in Resolution 1178 of 12th March 1861. In 1860, when Bh\u00edwandi was settled, the revision was applied to the iz\u00e1fat villages on the above terms, and the Superintendent reported to the Commissioner, in his 449 of 30th June 1862, that the plan of settlement sanctioned by Government for Murb\u00e1d had been extended to all iz\u00e1fat villages in the settled sub-divisions, except Nasr\u00e1pur or Karj\u00e1t. In 1863 a Commission was appointed, consisting of Mr. Stewart Gordon as President, the Honorable M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v Vith\u00e1l Vinchurkar and R\u00e1o Bah\u00e1dur Keshav R\u00e1mchandra Jog, to settle the claims of the district hereditary officers of Th\u00e1na. They recommended (Rep. 57 of 30th April 1864) that a contribution in lieu of service at the rate of five annas in each rupee of registered emoluments should be imposed, and that the registered emoluments should be fixed temporarily in iz\u00e1fat villages and elsewhere, until the survey rates were determined when they alone should be adopted. In forwarding the report to Government, the Revenue Commissioner Mr. Ellis (1477A of 14th May 1864), expressed his opinion that the condition appeared to apply rather to in\u00e1m service villages than to villages\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 134-138.\nheld on the iz\u00e1fat tenure as ordinarily found in the Th\u00e1na collectorate. Iz\u00e1fat villages were held in connection with the district hereditary officers' grants and were, therefore, fairly included in the vatan settlement, but under the survey a special arrangement had been made for such villages. The iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1r was forbidden from levying from the cultivators more than the survey rates; he was responsible for the full revenue on all the arable land of the village, and received a deduction of ten per cent. This in Mr. Ellis' opinion was not more than a fair return for the management, and he recommended that all villages so settled should be specially freed from liability to pay under the proposed settlement, as the deduction of ten per cent was made in return for the management of the village, a service which the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1r continued to perform as heretofore. Government sanctioned the suggestions of the committee with the modifications recommended by the Revenue Commissioner, thus refusing to allow the five-anna vatan settlement to be extended to iz\u00e1fat villages.\n\nIn 1865 when the survey settlement was introduced into Kolvan, now V\u00e1da and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur including Mokh\u00e1da, the Superintendent of survey reported that there were thirteen iz\u00e1fat villages. The holders of eight of these villages prayed that the introduction of the survey might be delayed as they claimed to hold at a fixed rate. The Commissioner of survey, in forwarding this report, added that the Superintendent explained that the settlement was deferred at the request of the Collector, the late Mr. Stewart Gordon. At the same time, as there was nothing special in the tenure or general terms on which the villages were held, he recommended that the Murb\u00e1d settlement should be applied to them. This proposal was sanctioned by Government in their Resolution 3183 of 5th September 1866. In 1867 a question arose as to the forest rights of these eight villages, and much confusion was caused by the district officers incorrectly reporting to Government that Mr. Gordon had extended his vatan settlement to them. The fact was that only in the cases of K\u00e1mb\u00e1ra and Varla had he, prior to the receipt of Government Resolution 4289 of 28th October 1864, taken agreements from the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs to pay five annas quit-rent on their forest cuttings. In the K\u00e1mb\u00e1ra agreement it was particularly stipulated that the agreement was conditional on Government sanctioning the vatan settlement. A further misunderstanding appears to have risen in 1867 from an agreement made in 1854 by Dr. Gibson, Conservator of Forests, with the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs of\n\n---\n\n1 Gov.

An order should therefore be issued to the Kolvan m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00edd\u00e1r to let the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1r cut his forests whenever he may apply for leave to do so.' Mr. Mulock, C.S.\n5 See Government Letter 272 of 11th January 1850.\nKurung and P\u00e1thraj to protect the teak in their forests. Under this agreement, after deducting expenses, the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs were to get a one-third share (5 annas in the rupee) of the produce when their forests were cut by Government. The five annas to be paid to the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs for protecting the forests was confused with the five annas vatan settlement to be taken by Government for commutation of service under the Gordon settlement. The result was that orders were passed conflicting with those issued by Government at the survey settlements of the district. The one-third (5 annas) or Gordon vatan settlement was applied and forest rights were conceded, on condition that when the forest was cut the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1r should pay a quit-rent of one-third (5 annas in the rupee) of the forest produce. This settlement was extended to Vars\u00e1la under the orders of Government, and to Bhopavli, K\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, \u00c1mgaon, Varla, V\u00e1rnol, Adoshi, and Dolh\u00e1ra under the orders of the Commissioner. Of these villages only the four last were in the hands of the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs, the others being under attachment. Government have lately held with respect to these villages that the agreements passed were invalid; that the orders of the Commissioners were issued under a misapprehension of the facts and should be cancelled; and that, for the future, the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs should be allowed to hold the villages on the liberal terms sanctioned in connection with the survey settlement. If they refuse to pay the revenue, the villages should be declared forfeited under section 153 of the Land Revenue Code. Government have always exercised the power of attaching iz\u00e1fat villages, in cases where proper accounts are not kept, and the Collector has been authorized to demand security from the holder for the payment of the revenue.\n\nIn respect to forest rights Dr. Gibson took agreements from the holder of M\u00e1sla in 1850, and from the holders of \u00c1divli, P\u00e1thraj, and Kurung in 1854, to protect their teak forests on condition that Government gave them a one-third share of the produce of the forest cuttings. An inquiry made in 1858 showed that, according to the custom of the country, iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs had not exercised forest rights and Government refused to recognize the claim to forests in the Shera village of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, and in the P\u00e1thraj, Kurung, and \u00c1divli villages of the Karjat sub-division. From the holders of the iz\u00e1fat villages to which the vatan settlement had been improperly applied, agreements were taken to the effect that they were to pay Government five annas (in the case of \u00c1mgaon six annas) on the receipts from their forests when they cut them, and elaborate rules regarding the cutting of their forests have been sanctioned by Government. Nine of the iz\u00e1fat villages are now under attachment and managed by Government. Shera, Varaskol, Devli, and Bhopavli have been under attachment ever since the introduction of the survey. K\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, \u00c1mgaon, and Vars\u00e1la were attached in August 1878, and \u00c1divli and V\u00e1var have been recently attached. There are at present (1882) in all thirty-eight iz\u00e1fat.\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Res. 4938 of 26th July 1882.  \n2 Gov. Res. 1015 of 17th March 1864.  \n3 Gov. Res. 975 of 10th March 1860.  \n4 Gov.

In Panvel there are two Government reclamations, thirty-eight held by single proprietors, and five by bodies of husbandmen. The Government reclamations are repaired at state expense, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r estimating the cost of the repairs, which are carried out twice in the year, in May before the rains and in September towards their close. The portions of the embankment requiring repairs are measured with a rod or dand, thirty feet (20 h\u00e1ts) long, and the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r pays the p\u00e1t\u00edl the estimated cost. The husbandmen who till the reclamation generally repair it and the gangs of labourers are called jol. To meet the cost of these repairs, at the time of the survey settlement, the acre rates were raised from 1s. to 2s. (as. 8-Re. 1). The m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, district k\u00e1rkun, tal\u00e1ti, and p\u00e1t\u00edl see to the repairs. They are always well carried out, and complaints of carelessness are rarely if ever received. In some cases, especially in Bassein, a yearly lump sum is paid by Government for the embankments, and, if this is not enough, the p\u00e1t\u00edl and the husbandmen have to finish the repairs without pay.

A description of the assessment levied on such lands is given in Sections XXXVI. and LIX. of the same Regulation. Mr. Mulock, C.S.\n\nThe word shil seems to mean a gap, and to be derived from the K\u00e1marese shila split, referring to the gaps at the small water-ways that were left till the bank was finished and then shut with gates. The language suggests that the practice dates from pre-Aryan times, but this and other Dravidian revenue terms may have been introduced during the sway of the Silh\u00e1ra or R\u00e1shtrak\u00fata dynasties; both of whom seem to have had a strong southern element. See History, pp. 422, 428, 434. Major Jervis (Konkan, 78) was of opinion that the special arrangements for encouraging the reclamation of salt waste were introduced by the Ahmadnagar government. But, when the Portuguese established their power, special grants were in force in Salsetts and Bassein, parts of the district never held by the Ahmadnagar kings. The Portuguese greatly encouraged these reclamations by rules of gradually increasing rental on the same principles as Todar Mal's rules for the rental of waste lands, and in accordance with the Mar\u00e1tha practice about fresh navkird, or renewed kirde\u00e1r tillage.\nor proprietors' reclamations, stand in the public accounts in the name of the proprietor. Formerly it was usual for the proprietor to take one man of rice a bigha for the repairs, now the contract, khand makta or scumitva, system has been applied to these lands and from five to ten mans an acre are taken as rent. The proprietor is responsible for the repairs, and he makes private arrangements with his tenants. Kul\u00e1rag or peasant-held reclamations are shown in the accounts, with a share of the land and of the assessment entered against each cultivator's name. All combine for the repairs, the headman calling the rest when their services are wanted. Complaints of the repairs being scamped or of a sharer refusing to do his part of the work are unknown.\n\nThe term khot or revenue farmer is incorrectly applied to eighteen holders of large estates, comprising fifty-three villages in S\u00e1lsette. These estates have in all cases been granted by the British Government. The chief of these estates are the Kurla, the M\u00e1l\u00e1d, the Pavai, the Goregaon, the Devnar, the Vovla, and the Bh\u00e1ndup. The Kurla estate includes seven villages, Kurla, Mohili, Kole Kaly\u00e1n, Marol, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1r, \u00c1salpa, and Parj\u00e1pur. It was granted in 1809 to Mr. Hormasji Bamanji V\u00e1dia in exchange for a piece of ground belonging to him in Bombay, near the Apollo Gate. The difference between the revenue of these villages and the yearly interest on the amount at which the plot of ground in Bombay was valued was made payable yearly to Government. In 1840-41 this yearly rent was redeemed by the payment of a lump sum of \u00a32500 (Rs. 25,000), and the estate was conveyed in fee simple, exclusive of excise rights. Certain lands in these villages are held direct from Government by original occupants. The survey settlement was introduced into them in 1878. The M\u00e1l\u00e1d estate consists of seven villages, M\u00e1l\u00e1d, Dahisar, M\u00e1g\u00e1tma, Tulshi, \u00c1ra, Eksar, Kanheri, and part of P\u00e1h\u00e1di. It was granted in 1806 to Mr. \u00c1rdesar D\u00e1di in exchange for a plot of ground in the Fort of Bombay, known as Harjvan L\u00e1la's garden, which was taken by Government subject to the payment of the difference between the revenue of the villages and the yearly interest of the amount at which the Bombay plot of ground was valued. The villages were finally conveyed in fee simple by indenture dated 25th January 1819, subject to the yearly payment of \u00a3244 (Rs. 2440). The excise rights have lately (1880), under section 65 of the \u00c1bk\u00e1ri Act (V. of 1878), been bought by Government for \u00a35165 (Rs. 51,650). The villages of M\u00e1l\u00e1d, Kanheri, \u00c1ra, and Tulshi were, on the 6th October 1868, bought by Mr. Ahmadbh\u00e1i Habibbh\u00e1i from the trustees of Messrs. \u00c1rdesar Kharsedji D\u00e1di and Hormasji Kharsedji D\u00e1di. The Pavai estate includes six villages, Pavai, Tirand\u00e1j, Kopri Khurd, S\u00e1ki, Paspoli, and Tung\u00e1va. It was originally given in perpetual farm to Dr. Helenus Scott in 1799. But, owing to his death and the non-payment of rent, it was attached by Government. In 1829 it was again leased in perpetual farm to the late Mr. Fr\u00e1mji K\u00e1vasji, and, in 1837, was conveyed to him on payment of \u00a34747 (Rs. 47,470) in feesimple, burdened with the charge of maintaining a reservoir on the Duncan Road in Bombay. The excise rights of the estate were bought by Government in 1879 for \u00a35000 (Rs. 50,000) under section 64 of the\nChapter VIII.\n\nLand Administration.\n\nTenures.\n\nLeasehold Villages.\n\n\u00c1bk\u00e1ri Act. The villages are at present under the management of an official assignee. The Goregaon estate includes six villages, Goregaon, M\u00e1j\u00e1s, Poisar, Mogra, Bandivli, Oshivra, and part of a seventh P\u00e1h\u00e1di. It was granted in farm in 1830 to Mr. Kharsedji K\u00e1vasji, and was subsequently (22nd September 1847), on the payment of a lump sum of \u00a33000 (Rs. 30,000), conveyed by deed in fee simple, subject to the yearly payment of one rupee. This estate has changed hands more than once. In 1849 it was bought from the family of the grantee by Mr. M\u00e1nekji Limji for \u00a324,600 (Rs. 2,46,000), and in 1869 it was bought from Mr. M\u00e1nekji's son by the present owner Mr. Bayramji Jiji bh\u00e1hi. At the request of the owner the survey has been introduced. The Devnar estate includes five villages, Devnar, Borla, Kirol, Chena, and Vars\u00e1va Borbh\u00e1t. It was granted in perpetual lease to Mr. Dh\u00e1kji D\u00e1d\u00e1ji in 1809 on a rental of \u00a3518 (Rs. 5180). In addition to this a sum of \u00a339 (Rs. 390) is paid for lands held by husbandmen direct from Government. Only two of the villages, Chena and Vars\u00e1va Borbh\u00e1t, remain in the family of the original grantee; the other three have been sold to different buyers. In 1880 the excise rights were bought under section 66 of the \u00c1bk\u00e1ri Act.\n\nThe Vovla estate includes three villages, Vovla, Vadavli, and Chitalsar M\u00e1np\u00e1da. It was granted by the East India Company in 1803 to Mr. Gop\u00e1lr\u00e1v B\u00e1puji, a Vakil of the Gaikw\u00e1r of Baroda. In 1859 an adoption was made without Government sanction, and, in 1862, the matter was compromised under section 48 of Regulation XVII. of 1837 by the payment of five annas in the rupee on the rental fixed by the survey, and the village was continued to the adopted heir. This arrangement was confirmed by Government Resolution 3169 of 19th August 1862, and Government Resolution 6766, dated 2nd December 1875, gave the proprietor sole forest rights. The Bh\u00e1ndup estate includes the village of Bh\u00e1ndup and lands in N\u00e1hur and K\u00e1njur. These, in 1803, were leased in perpetuity to Mr. Luke Ashburner for a yearly rental of \u00a3235 (Rs. 2350). A plot of ground in Bh\u00e1ndup was excepted, and, in 1839-40, it was granted rent-free for forty years to the late Mr. K\u00e1vasji M\u00e1nekji, the father of the present proprietors. Since the introduction of the new excise system the large Bh\u00e1ndup distillery has been closed, and owing to family disputes the estate is now in the hands of an official assignee.\n\nBesides these thirty-six villages, seventeen S\u00e1lsotte villages have been granted by the British Government on lease or in in\u00e1m, making a total of fifty-three out of the 107 S\u00e1lsotte villages. In 1799 Chendavli was leased in perpetuity to Dr. Helenus Scott, and was sold in 1828 by the Civil Court when Mr. Vik\u00e1ji Meherji of T\u00e1r\u00e1pur purchased it. In 1805 Vy\u00e1rvli was farmed in perpetuity to Gregoria Manuel de Silva, but no deed was passed. In 1829-30 Hary\u00e1li was granted half in perpetual in\u00e1m and half in perpetual farm to Merv\u00e1n\u00edji Rastamji D\u00e1rukh\u00e1n\u00e1v\u00e1la. In 1830-31 Chinchveli, Dindoshi, and \u00c1kur\u00ed were leased in perpetuity to Lakshman Harishchandra, subject to a yearly payment of \u00a378 (Rs. 780); M\u00e1rvli and M\u00e1hul were given, the former in in\u00e1m in 1837 and the latter in perpetual farm in 1831 to Fr\u00e1mj\u00ed Pestanji, the head servant of Government House. In 1830-31 Valnai and V\u00e1dhvan were\ngranted in hereditary *in\u00e1m* to Mr. Hormasji Rastamji, the treasurer of the S\u00e1t\u00e1ra Residency. In 1831 Borivda was leased to Krishnar\u00e1v Raghun\u00e1th. In 1833-34 K\u00e1njur and Vikhroli were leased in perpetual farm to Fr\u00e1mj\u00ed K\u00e1vasji, subject to an annual payment of \u00a393 (Rs. 930). In 1836-37 \u00c1nik was leased for ninety-nine years to Fr\u00e1mj\u00ed Nasarv\u00e1nji. In 1842-43 Vila P\u00e1rla and Ju were granted in *in\u00e1m* to Mr. Navroji Jamsedji, and, in 1844-45 Gh\u00e1tkopar was leased for ninety-nine years to Ratanji Edalji.\n\nIn almost all of these leases the rental is specified in *mudas*, or rice measures, and not in cash. This *muda* calculation was made according to a system peculiar to S\u00e1lsette, called the *tij\u00e1i* or one-third. Under this system the Government rental is found by multiplying the quantity of *dhep* by two, dividing it by three, and multiplying the quotient by twenty the number of rupees at which each *muda* of land is assessed.\\(^1\\)\n\nExcept the Kurla and M\u00e1l\u00e1d estates, which were given in exchange for land in Bombay, the estates were granted to encourage the investment of capital in land, the increase of population, and the growth of better crops. Except the Kurla, M\u00e1l\u00e1d, Pavai, and Goregaon estates, which are held in fee-simple or freehold, these leased villages were charged fairly high rentals, and in most cases were subject to the following conditions. Lands occupied at the time of the lease on the *shilotri*, or, according to some deeds, on the *suti* tenure, were not to become the lessee's, unless he satisfied or bought out the incumbents. The happiness and prosperity of the people were to be promoted, and the lessee was to protect and befriend them. The lessee was to build reservoirs and embankments, to sink wells, and to grow the better class of crops. The rates of assessment were not to be raised, and no innovation was to be introduced without express sanction. The lessee was to continue all village charitable and religious allowances. Waste land was granted free for forty years. On the forty-first year all land, except what was totally unfit for tillage, was to be assessed. The lessee was to recover and pay into the treasury, over and above the amount mentioned in his lease, all amounts due on leases granted in the estate. The village was not to change hands without Government leave. The lessee was to possess and exercise the authority of a farmer under Chapter VI. of Regulation XVII. of 1827. But he was to exercise no magisterial or judicial authority, unless it was duly conferred on him. He was not to make or sell opium, poisonous substances, tobacco, or hemp flowers. The Collector was to have power to inspect the village, and examine what improvement and progress were made. Suits regarding the lease were to be brought in the District Court. Any new system of revenue introduced by Government in other villages of the district was to be applicable to these grant villages.\n\nForest rights seem to have been conceded in the case of the large.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Thus, 231 *mudd\u00e1s* multiplied by two and divided by three give 154 real *mudd\u00e1s* which, when multiplied by twenty, give Rs. 3080. Mr. Langford's Letter 72, of 16th November 1842, to the Chief Secretary to Government.\nfreehold estates, Pavai, M\u00e1l\u00e1d, Kurla, and Goregaon, as also in those of Devnar, Valnai, Vovla, and Hary\u00e1li. In the other leases the concession is not so clear. The Privy Council has held that the Gh\u00e1tkopar lease did not give the forests, although the waste land was granted free for forty years.\\(^1\\) Although these leaseholders style themselves proprietors, they cannot claim the ownership of the soil, for the Court of Directors were most reluctant to part with the ownership of the soil and its alienation was jealously watched. In their despatch No. 20, dated 28th June 1843, sanctioning the reduction of the revenue of Kharsedji K\u00e1vasji's Goregaon estate, the Court wrote: 'Although we should have much preferred that any favour of which Kharsedji K\u00e1vasji might be thought deserving should have been shown in the shape of a gratuitous permanent reduction on the amount of his rent rather than by permitting him to redeem the whole, yet, in consideration of the very strong manner in which you solicit our compliance with your recommendation, we shall not refuse our sanction to the arrangement which you have proposed. As, however, we entertain strong objections to the entire alienation of the absolute property in the soil, we desire that you will cause a nominal rent (say of one rupee per annum) to be reserved in the deed, payable on demand to the Collector or other officer exercising revenue authority in the district as an acknowledgment that the ultimate title to the land is still vested in the Government.'\n\nIn thirty-four of the leasehold and in one in\u00e1m village N\u00e1n\u00e1la, the survey has been introduced, in some at the request of the leaseholder and in others in accordance with the terms of the deeds. In Kurla, Marol, \u00c1salpa, Mohili, Parj\u00e1pur, Sh\u00e1lh\u00e1r, Hary\u00e1li, Chitalsar M\u00e1np\u00e1da, \u00c1nik, N\u00e1n\u00e1la, Borivda, M\u00e1l\u00e1d, Kanheri, \u00c1ra, Vila P\u00e1rla, Ju, Chinchavli, Dindoshi, \u00c1kurli, Vovla, and Vadavli, survey rates were introduced under Government Resolution 3125 of 25th May 1876; in Kole Kaly\u00e1n, B\u00e1ndivli, Mogra, Oshivra, Goregaon, Poisar, M\u00e1j\u00e1s, P\u00e1h\u00e1di, and Gh\u00e1tkopar, under Government Resolution 678 of 2nd February 1877; in Valnai and V\u00e1dhvan, and also in Dahisar, Eksar, and M\u00e1g\u00e1tna, under Government Resolution 5521 of 18th October 1880.\n\nThe object with which Government granted these villages has been defeated and the results are disappointing. Few of the estates remain in the families of the original grantees. They have been sold chiefly owing to money difficulties. The owners rarely live on their estates, or take much interest in them or in the welfare of their people. Passing through S\u00e1sette either by the Peninsula or the Baroda railway the line lies almost exclusively through these alienated villages, and their neglected state contrasts unfavourably with the Government lands elsewhere. Much of this is due to the high price which firewood and hay fetch in the Bombay market. Brushwood and grass are among the most profitable crops the leaseholders can grow, while the system of selling to dealers or contractors relieves the leaseholders of the anxieties and troubles of\n\n\\(^1\\) Vol. 10, Weekly Reporter 13, Pr. C.\nagriculture. In 1880 the Deputy Superintendent of survey (669 of 21st May 1880), in reporting on the introduction of the new survey into Valnai and V\u00e1dhvan, wrote: 'These villages are situated about three miles to the north of the P\u00e1h\u00e1di station of the Baroda railway, Valnai being to the west and V\u00e1dhvan to the east of the line. V\u00e1dhvan is uninhabited, and, owing to the difficulty of getting tenants, much of the rice and hill crop land has been uncultivated for years. The whole of the rice lands in this village are now under grass and are leased to Bombay grass-dealers. The increase in the assessment of V\u00e1dhvan is very small, compared with that of the neighbouring village of Valnai. This is owing to the fact that all the rice land in V\u00e1dhvan has remained untilled for so long a period, that it is unfit for rice cultivation without a considerable outlay of money on embankments and levelling, and a lower classification valuation has been put on it than on the rice lands of Valnai. Whilst in S\u00e1lsette, I consulted some of the proprietors how it was that hill lands in S\u00e1lsette yielded larger profits under grass than under grain. Some of them could give no information as their hill lands were never tilled. The result of information obtained from one or two proprietors who possessed some accounts of the cultivation was to show an average acre outturn of \u00a31 15s. 4d. (Rs. 17-10-8).\u00b9\n\nThe yearly produce of an acre of good land under grass is about 3000 pounds of hay worth at the present rate about \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15). As the cost of cutting and carting grass is much less than of raising grain, land pays better under grass. This estimate is mainly based on figures supplied by the proprietor of a village close to B\u00e1ndra. From inquiries made in villages further from Bombay, I believe that when grass has to be carted more than twenty miles, the profits from grain and from grass are much the same, but the cultivation of hill grains in west S\u00e1lsette is so limited that without experiments it is difficult to obtain reliable information.' These remarks explain why villages which were populous when granted are now uninhabited. It pays the leaseholders to oust or get rid of their tenants and turn their rice fields into meadow, and this process is quietly but surely going on.\n\nAnother large estate of 3688 acres, exclusive of salt marsh,\u00b2 was granted by deed dated 1870 to R\u00e1mchandra Lakshmanji of Bombay, on a lease of 999 years, in the villages of Ghodbandar, Bh\u00e1yndar, and Mira. This estate was granted because the villagers refused to keep the large Bh\u00e1yndar embankments in repair.\n\nThe conditions attaching to the grant were that the lessee should pay a yearly rent of \u00a3679 (Rs. 6790); that he should keep the embankments, dams, and sluices in repair; that he should demand no rent from in\u00e1m d\u00e1rs; that he should demand only survey rates for suti and varkas lands; that he should keep boundary marks in repair; that he should pay patils' and hereditary officers' claims and\n\n\u00b9 The details are, 1st year, 8 mans of nichni valued at Rs. 29; 2nd year, 6 mans of vari valued at Rs. 18; 3rd year, 2 mans of udid valued at Rs. 6; total Rs. 53; yearly average Rs. 17-10-8. Mr. Mulock, C.S.\n\n\u00b2 The details were, in\u00e1m lands 26 acres, suti lands 351 acres, early and hill-crop lands 434 acres, and yearly tenant land 2877 acres. Mr. Mulock, C.S.\nallowances; that he should not interfere with rights of way; that he should surrender land free of cost for the Bh\u00e1yndar railway station; that he should give notice of the assignment of lands; that he should not assign lands without leave; and that the salt marsh lands were liable to resumption if not reclaimed within twenty years. This estate has been the cause of much litigation, owing to an attempt of the leaseholder to levy from the yearly tenants one-half instead of one-third of the produce. The district court and the High Court on appeal (appeal 292 of 1880) have decided that the leaseholder's claim to levy one-half is contrary to the custom of the country.\n\nChikhal.\n\nChikhal, or extra cultivation, is in Section III. of Regulation I of 1808 described as spare grounds allotted to the cultivators for the rearing of surplus batty or rice plants by the Portuguese land-holder, who furnished him with seed on condition of the cultivator's rendering, besides the original amount of seed, a third or sometimes only a fourth or a still less proportion of the produce. The practice is stated to be still occasionally continued between private occupants, or by Government supplying from its unoccupied lands space for the rearing of rice seedlings.\n\nGatkuli and Eks\u00e1li.\n\nGatkuli\u00b9 and Eks\u00e1li tenants were tenants-at-will, or yearly tenants holding their land from Government from year to year, on such terms as Government chose to impose.\n\nSECTION III.\u2014HISTORY.\n\nMost of the forms of assessment that were in force when Th\u00e1na was ceded to the British, and which continue in use in a few village groups in the north-east of the district, can be traced to the Hindu chiefs who held the country before the arrival of the Musalm\u00e1ns. Rice lands were, without measuring them, divided into parcels or blocks which were estimated to require a certain amount of seed or to yield a certain quantity of grain. This system was known under several names, dhep, hund\u00e1bandi, mud\u00e1bandi, k\u00e1sbandi, talkbandi, and tok\u00e1bandi.\u00b2 The principle of all of these was the same, though in some cases slight changes were introduced apparently by the Musalm\u00e1ns.\u00b3 At the time of their cession to the British this form of assessment was in use in the coast districts under the name of dhep. According to some accounts it had been introduced by the Musalm\u00e1ns (1320-1540),\u2074\n\n\u00b9 Properly land whose occupant is missing.\n\u00b2 Of these words dhep, a lump, is Mar\u00e1thi, apparently of Dravidian or at least un-Sanskrit origin; hunda, a lump sum or quantity of grain, is apparently the K\u00e1narese hund\u00e1lit lump or gross; murka which ought to be written muda a measure of grain (25-28 mans) is a K\u00e1narese word still in use; k\u00e1s an unmeasured parcel of land is an un-Sanskrit Mar\u00e1thi word; tok, properly thok, is an un-Sanskrit Mar\u00e1thi word meaning lump or mass; talka is doubtful, it is said to be Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed and to mean both a coin and a measure of land (120 bigh\u00e1s). In this case talkbandi, properly tok\u00e1bandi, would imply that the land has been measured. If so it has no place in this set of terms and must have been confused with, or mis-written for tok\u00e1bandi or thok\u00e1bandi.\n\u00b3 Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821, in MS. Sel. 160, 137-139; Mr. Davidson, 7th Aug. 1837, in Bom. Gov. Rev. Rsc. 867 of 1838, 289.\n\u2074 Rev. Answers 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 711-714. Malik Ambar (1600) is by mistake mentioned as the Musalm\u00e1n governor who introduced the system.\nand according to others by the Portuguese (1540-1740). But both the system and the name were found in use by the Portuguese, and as the word is un-Sanskrit Marathi, there seems no reason to doubt that this form of assessment dates from very early times. The levy of a plough cess, a sickle cess, or a pickaxe cess, which, till the introduction of the revenue survey, was the form of assessment almost universal in hill and forest tracts, seems also to date from early Hindu times, and the practice of measuring palm and other garden lands into bigh\u00e1s seems to belong to the pre-Musalm\u00e1n \u00c1ryan or part-\u00c1ryan rulers. Finally, the K\u00e1narese term shilotar shows that from early times special rules have been in force to encourage the reclamation of salt wastes.\n\nLittle is known of the revenue changes introduced by the Musalm\u00e1n rulers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Deccan Musalm\u00e1ns in Kaly\u00e1n and in the south of the district are said to have fixed the government share at one-third of the estimated produce. In 1469, when the Bahmani kings established their authority in the inland parts, they found the land so deserted that even the memory of village boundaries was lost. People were so few that the new villages included several of the old, and lands were given to all who would till them. During the first year no rent was taken, and for some years the government demand was limited to a basketful of grain. Of the changes introduced along the coast by the Gujar\u00e1t Musalm\u00e1ns in the fifteenth century nothing has been traced. This and the fact that grants of land continued to be made by Hindu chiefs till the sixteenth century seem to show that, except their military possession of certain outposts, the authority of the Gujar\u00e1t kings was limited to the receipt of tribute.\n\nDuring the sixteenth century, in the south-east and south, the officers of the Ahmadnagar government are said to have measured the rice land and reduced the government share to one-sixth, and in the uplands to have continued the levy of a plough cess. Extra cesses and vexatious practices are said to have been stopped, and the husbandmen to have been treated as proprietary holders, kul\u00edrag, and charged only a light rent payable partly in money, partly in grain. Except trade dues and the levies of revenue\n\n---\n\n1 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. 2.\n2 Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821, in MS. Sel. 160, 137-139. The plough or n\u00e1ngar cess system still (1881) obtains in Karjat and in the Mokh\u00e1da petty division of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur; and the hoe or kud\u00e1l\u00ed assessment is still (1881) in use in Karjat.\n3 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. 6 cl. 2. Bigha is the Sanskrit vigr\u00e1h division or portion.\n4 The rules which the Portuguese found in force for granting lands for reclamation at rates rising in five years from one-fourth to a full rental are supposed by Major Jervis (Konkan, 87) to have been introduced by the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi government. But the Niz\u00e1m Sh\u00e1hi kings never held Bassein, and the name shilotri is as noticed above of Dravidian origin.\n5 Hund\u00e1bandi was the name in use in Sanj\u00e1n, and takbandi (probably tok\u00e1bandi) in Manor, V\u00e1sh\u00e1la, V\u00e1da, Kolvan, and the D\u00e1ngs. Jervis' Konkan, 101.\n6 Elphinstone's History, 4th Ed. 1857, 667. For forty years the Bahmanis had been trying to conquer the Konkan. They probably held the south-east of Th\u00e1na as over-lords.\n7 The expression is a basket of grain an acre, but as the land was not then measured, it probably means on a plot or parcel of ground. See Jervis' Konkan, 89.\nofficers for their house expenses, there were no extra charges. The revenue was gathered by village accountants or kulkarnis, and brought by subordinate agents to the government treasury.\n\nMeanwhile almost the whole of the coast had passed from the Musalm\u00e1n kings of Gujar\u00e1t to the Portuguese. In the poor and wild Sanj\u00e1n and T\u00e1r\u00e1pur districts to the north of Bassein the old form of assessment was kept unchanged. The rice lands remained divided in blocks, roughly estimated to yield a certain quantity of grain, and in the hill lands the levy of a plough or sickle cess was continued. Some of the richer lands of Bassein are said to have been surveyed. In the rest of Bassein and in Salsette a new system was introduced. The lands were divided into estates and given to European landlords at a quit-rent, or foro, of from four to ten per cent of the former rentals. Under these landlords who were called proprietors or fazendeiros, the actual cultivators, except those who were their slaves, held on the old lump or dhep rates which are said to have represented half the produce. In each village the distribution of the rental among the husbandmen was entrusted to a mhat\u00e1ra or elder. There would also seem to have been village clerks, known as prabhus, who were paid by a money cess levied on the landlords. Except establishing this class of large landowners the Portuguese are said to have made little change in the revenue system. Some items of land revenue were, as was the case under the former rulers, levied in money. The chief of these were a land cess on palm orchards assessed by the bigha; a tree cess on brab palms paid by Bhand\u00e1ris or liquor-drawers; a cess on the punavem a dye-yielding flower; and a cess on millstones and\n\n---\n\n1 Jervis' Konkan, 82, 83.\n2 Besides Salsette Mr. Marriott (11th July 1821) mentions as Portuguese districts, Bassein Island, M\u00e1nikpur, K\u00e1man, S\u00e1yvan, Mishim, Kelva, Shrigaon, T\u00e1r\u00e1pur, Chinchin, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, Nehar, Sanj\u00e1n, Manor, Asheri, Bel\u00e1pur, \u00c1tgaon. MS. Sel. 160, 132-133.\n3 Major Jervis (Konkan, 82) states that the quantity taken from the land was determined by the amount of seed required to sow the field. This does not seem to agree with the other accounts of the muda tenure. See below, p. 565.\n4 In 1818, the land tax in Bassein was levied not according to the extent of the land, but according to a survey made by the Portuguese. Mr. Marriott, 17th Oct. 1818, Rev. Diary 135 of 1818, 5158-5161.\n5 Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821 in MS. Sel. 160, 133: Reg. I. 1808, sec. II. Major Jervis (Konkan, 84) says the rent was one-third or one-fourth of the produce. This seems to be a mistake. East India Papers, III. 774, give from four to ten per cent of the rent.\n6 Many of these slaves were Africans. Nairne's Konkan, 50.\n7 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. II.\n8 Mr. Nairne thinks that these mhad\u00e1ras were chosen only in villages managed directly by government officers. But it rather seems that they were appointed in all villages except those whose lands were worked as a home farm by the landlord's slaves. Mhat\u00e1ra (Sk. mahattar) appears in some of the early Hindu grants in the sense of headman.\n9 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. VI, cl. 4.\n10 The changes are shown in detail in Reg. I. of 1808, section VI. cl. 1-4. The chief are an increase in some villages in the size of the muda or grain measure; addition to make up for waste in carrying the rice from the farmyard to the granary; for wastage in the granary; and to meet the cost of guards. Other additions were a wedding gift to the landlord's daughter and an allowance to the landlord's wife. There was also a levy to meet the cost of taking the rice to the boat station and to meet the cost of a harvest home, augairah.\npaving stones and on salt pans. Fishermen paid three cesses, one known as rend doli on stake nets, a poll tax ang dena at different rates according to ages, and a fish cess rend m\u00e1sli on dry fish. Under excise the Portuguese raised money from liquor farms rend d\u00e1ru, from a still cess rend bhatti, and from a privilege allowing the people of a village to buy their liquor where they chose. Finally there was a shop tax, duk\u00e1v\u00e1ri, levied on grocers and other dealers.\n\nIn addition to the original quit-rent, cesses were from time to time levied from the landowners. But the rents were probably never high and their pressure was much lightened by the easy terms on which salt-marsh lands were granted for reclamation. The result was a great development of the districts under Portuguese rule. The landlords are described as living in much splendour in fine country-houses and as being enriched beyond measure; and the bulk of the people, though they were little better than tenants-at-will, were in great demand and apparently fairly off. Large areas of land were redeemed from salt waste, the yield of rice was greatly increased, and the finest crops were grown, sugarcane and pine apples, cocoa-palms and betel vines. Even as late as the end of the seventeenth century Musalm\u00e1n writers praise the Portuguese for the justness of their rule and the lightness of their taxes.\n\nIn the sixteenth century, while the coast lands were under the Portuguese, inland Th\u00e1na in the wilder north kept to the old Hindu system. In the south-east and south, under Musalm\u00e1n governors, it was managed by Hindu officers styled zamind\u00e1rs. These men, holding the posts of deshmukh and deshpande, performed the duties of district officers, and collected the revenue from the landholders partly in money and partly in grain. They were paid by the grant of certain rent-free villages termed iz\u00e1f\u00e1t. Early in the seventeenth century Malik Ambar, the Ahmadnagar minister, started a new system based on the system introduced in Moghal territories by Akbar\u2019s minister Todar Mal. According to Major Jervis, Malik Ambar\u2019s chief change was to make the settlement direct with the village, instead of with the district hereditary revenue\n\n---\n\n1 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. VI. cl. 2, 3. According to Mr. Marriott (11th July 1821), the Portuguese realised but a small excise revenue. MS. Sel. 160, 133.\n2 Jervis (Konkan, 86) says the charge rose in five years from a fourth to a full rental. But these terms are much less favourable than those that were afterwards granted by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, and it seems probable, looking at the position of the proprietors, that they were allowed to improve their estates in this way without being called on to pay a higher rent.\n3 The accounts of the state of the husbandmen vary greatly. Major Jervis (Konkan, 86) speaks of them as \u2018by all accounts extremely happy and easy in their circumstances.\u2019 Mr. Nairne (Konkan, 50) doubts if prosperity extended to the lower classes. He quotes passages which speak of the husbandmen as poor wretches worse than vassals. But the pity of the writers seems to have been roused by their want of freedom rather than by their want of food or clothes.\n4 Kh\u00e1fi Kh\u00e1n\u2019s Muntakhab-I-Lub\u00e1b in Elliot\u2019s History, VII. 344, 345.\n5 Mr. Marriott to Government, 14th August 1820, in Th\u00e1na Collector\u2019s Outward File, 1820, 163. Replies to Revenue Questions, 31st October 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 774. The charge of these officers was a mah\u00e1l of which there were sixty-one at the time of the introduction of British rule.\nsuperintendents and accountants who had gradually assumed the place of revenue farmers. His next step was to find out the yield of the land. With this object he arranged the rice lands into four classes, first, second, third, and fourth, *aval*, *dum*, *sim*, and *ch\u00e1rsim*. The uplands were classified in a more general way. The government share was apparently fixed at one-third and the outturn of the field was ascertained by inquiries lasting over a term of years. Finally the quantity of grain due to government was changed into a money payment. The village headmen were made hereditary and became security for the realization of the government dues. Malik Ambar's system nominally stretched from the Vaitarna to the S\u00e1vitra except the Habshi's land, but it does not seem to have been anything like completely carried out.\n\nLater in the seventeenth century Shiv\u00e1j\u00ed, by his minister Ann\u00e1ji Dattu (1668-1681), made a fresh survey and assessment in the southern districts of Th\u00e1na. Under this survey the rice lands were measured into *bigh\u00e1s* of 4014 square yards; the lands were divided into twelve classes; and, from tests taken during three successive years, the government demand was fixed at about forty per cent of the produce. The rates varied from $5\\frac{1}{2}$ bushels on the richest to twenty-three bushels on the poorest lands. Except in a few cases, where they were measured, and, according to the years of fallow required, three, five, six, or seven acres were counted as one, hill lands, *varkas* or *dongar*, were assessed by the plough *n\u00e1ngar*, large allowances being made for rocky barren spots. The plough rates were for *n\u00e1chni* $5\\frac{1}{2}$ to $6\\frac{1}{2}$ bushels ($3\\frac{1}{2}-3$ mans), for *vari* $4\\frac{1}{2}$ to $5\\frac{1}{2}$ bushels ($2\\frac{1}{2}-3$ mans), for *harik* $5\\frac{1}{2}$ bushels (3 mans), and for\n\n---\n\n1 Major Jervis (Konkan, 66) states that the officers were given a definite assignment in money with a percentage on the collections. But this does not agree with other accounts which state that under the Nagar system the revenue officers were paid by the grant of villages free of rent and that the change to a fixed percentage on the collections was made by the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. Mr. Marriott, 14th August 1820, in Th\u00e1na Collector's Outward File, 1820, 163.\n\n2 Major Jervis' account (Konkan, 67) fails to give the process by which the yield was found out, and he does not mention the share that was claimed by Government. In another passage (Konkan, 67) he says the rules were much the same as those of Todar Mal. Apparently the land was not measured.\n\n3 Jervis' Konkan, 68. Grant Duff (43) gives the following summary of the changes introduced by Malik Ambar: 'He abolished revenue farming, and committed the management to Brahman agents under Muhammadao superintendence; he restored such parts of the village establishment as had fallen into decay; and he revived a mode of assessing the fields by collecting a moderate proportion of the actual produce in kind, which after the experience of several seasons was commuted for a payment in money settled annually according to the cultivation.' It is stated that his assessment was equal to two-fifths of the produce, but tradition says his money commutation was only one-third. Captain Francis (18th January 1855) in Bombay Gov. Sel. XCVI, 2, 3. It seems probable that several of these changes were not introduced into the Konkan.\n\n4 The classes were, first, *aval*; second, *dum* or *duyam*; third, *sim*; fourth, *ch\u00e1rvam* or *ch\u00e1rsim*; fifth, husband *raup\u00e1l*; sixth, salt *kh\u00e1rvat*; seventh, rocky *b\u00f3val*; eighth, stony *kh\u00e1di*; ninth, pulse *kariyd* or *turvat*; tenth, hemp *tdg\u00e1t*; eleventh, seed-beds *rauh*; and twelfth, tree-root *m\u00e1nat*. Jervis' Konkan, 94, 95.\n\n5 The details in bushels\u2014the acre are, first, $5\\frac{1}{2}$ (12 mans the *bigha*), second 45 (10 mans), third $36\\frac{1}{2}$ (8 mans), fourth $28\\frac{1}{2}$ (6\u00bd mans), bushlands $36\\frac{1}{2}$ (8 mans), salt $34\\frac{1}{2}$ (7\u00bd mans), rocky stony and pulse land $28\\frac{1}{2}$ (6\u00bd mans), seed-beds, hemp, and uncleared root lands $23$ (5 mans). Jervis' Konkan, 94, 95. These rates are said to have differed very little from Malik Ambar's rates. Konkan, 125.\nother inferior produce 2\u00b718 bushels (1\u00bc mans). In garden lands the produce was estimated by calculation, and half was taken in kind by the government. It does not seem certain that Shiv\u00e1ji's rates were introduced into Th\u00e1na. If they were they lasted for only a few years. From 1682, till the close of Aurangzeb's reign (1707), Kaly\u00e1n was several times ravaged by the Moghals and seems to have been nominally recovered by them. In 1710 the south of the district passed to \u00c1ngria. But he held it for only ten years when it was taken by the Peshwa. Between 1733 and 1739 the Portuguese territories passed to the Peshwa, and in the following years, much of north Th\u00e1na was wrested from the Jawh\u00e1r chief. Except the Portuguese possessions, when Th\u00e1na passed to the Peshwa it was in a wretched state. The people were few and poor, and large areas of land had passed out of tillage.\n\nThe eighty-seven years (1730-1817) of Mar\u00e1tha management form three periods. Thirty years during which no marked change was introduced; thirty years when fresh surveys were made, new cesses were levied, and revenue farming became general; and twenty-seven years when revenue farming was universal and exactions unlimited. Under the Peshw\u00e1s the management of the district was nominally entrusted to an officer styled sarsubhed\u00e1r. But, as a rule, these officers seem, at least during the later years of the Peshwa's government, to have lived in Poona and to have deputed officers styled m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs or subhed\u00e1rs to act for them. Their duties were to enquire into crimes and punish offenders. This power extended to the taking of life, confiscation of property, expulsion from caste or residence, corporal punishment, and fine. These punishments were inflicted in case of murder, highway gang and aggravated robberies, on coiners, immoral characters, oppressors, and persons supposed to deal in witchcraft. No reference was made to Poona, nor had the subhed\u00e1rs written orders in support of their authority. Only in very particular crimes such as treason were the accused sent to Poona. The subhed\u00e1rs had authority to grant rent-free and increasing ist\u00e1va leases to persons offering to reclaim waste lands, and to grant land that had never been tilled to Br\u00e1hmans and temples. The mah\u00e1lkar\u00eds or heads of petty divisions of which there were over sixty, and the heads of villages had authority to make similar grants, which were confirmed\n\n---\n\n1 Jervis' Konkan, 96. Of other crops turmeric paid 5 mans on a bigha of \u00beths the actual measurement, hemp 5 mans on one of \u00beths, and sugarcanes 3\u00bd-6\u00bd mans of raw sugar on the customary bigha.\n\n2 The only change noticed as having been introduced by \u00c1ngria was taking more of the rent in commuted money rates (Replies to Rev. Questions, 31st October 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 774; Jervis' Konkan, 115). Details of Angria's system are given in the Kol\u00e1ba District Account.\n\n3 The details for this period are not satisfactory. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s seem to have re-assessed the rich lands of S\u00e1leste and Bassein, and to have continued the system of plot assessment in Sanj\u00e1n and T\u00e1r\u00e1pur. In hill lands they seem to have introduced revised plough rates, and from the wild Jawh\u00e1r lands to have occasionally levied a vague acre tax. In the south they seem, as far as they could, to have applied the elaborate system of rents, cesses, and forced labour which had earlier been in force in Ratn\u00e1giri. Jervis' Konkan, 88-89 and 125-126.\n\n4 Rev. Answers, 31st October 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 790-792.\nby deeds passed by the m\u00e1latd\u00e1r. These alienations were not entered in the revenue statement sent to head-quarters. The district officers were not authorized to alienate the government land, and whenever they took upon themselves to alienate land, they would account for it in the rent statement as having been given for houses or gardens. They had no authority to punish or degrade the rich or to grant remissions to husbandmen. These matters were settled in Poona. During the time of N\u00e1na Fadnavis (1795) the yearly salaries of sarsubhed\u00e1rs varied from \u00a3500 to \u00a31000 (Rs. 5000 - Rs. 10,000); and of subhed\u00e1rs from \u00a350 to \u00a3200 (Rs. 500 - Rs. 2000). These amounts were paid from Poona. Besides their pay some of them were granted allowances for keeping palanquins, p\u00e1lkhis, and state umbrellas, abd\u00e1girs. They were also granted servants' allowance, table allowance, and special allowances for particular services.\n\nThe hereditary district officers, the revenue superintendent des\u00e1i or deshmukh, and the accountant deshp\u00e1nd\u00e9, of whom there were two for each of the sixty-one petty divisions, were continued at first in much the same position as under the Muhammadans. The chief change was that instead of giving them rent-free iz\u00e1dfat villages, they were paid a fixed percentage (6\u00bd) on their revenue collections. They were allowed to continue to hold their former villages but were forced to pay their full assessment. When the practice of farming villages and sub-divisions became universal the hereditary district officers became almost useless. Their families were broken and their pay scattered and alienated.\u00b9\n\nVillage headmen were continued and were introduced into those parts of the Portuguese territory where they had not been before. In S\u00e1lsette (1741) no hereditary district officers were appointed, but, in their place, managers, hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, were nominated to whom the headmen paid the village rent. Two new upper classes were introduced, high caste landholders known as p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, and village revenue farmers incorrectly called khots. The p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s were found necessary in the Portuguese territories from which all landlords had fled to Bombay and Goa. In other parts of the land, as the revenue was taken in advance, it was also advisable to have some men of capital who could help the very poor husbandmen. Further, the country had suffered greatly from the disorders which had marked the close of the seventeenth and the beginning of the eighteenth centuries. Much of the land had fallen waste and the ordinary husbandmen, many of the best of whom had given up tillage for military service, were unfit to bear the risk and outlay of bringing the land under tillage. For these reasons men of the upper class, chiefly Br\u00e1hmans and Pr\u00e1bhus and a few Musalm\u00e1ns, were encouraged to take land.\u00b2\n\nColonel Francis states that the new settlers were allowed to hold land at specially low rates.\u00b3 But it seems doubtful whether at first they were\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Marriott, 14th August 1820, in Th\u00e1na Collector's Outward File, 1820, 162-164.\n\u00b2 The Br\u00e1hmans would seem to have been chiefly Konkanasth Br\u00e1hmans, and the Pr\u00e1bhus were probably K\u00e1yasth Pr\u00e1bhus.\n\u00b3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 75-76.\ngiven any special concessions in addition to the very light rates always levied on newly tilled lands, which in S\u00e1lssette were two-thirds, half, one-third, or even one-fourth of the old Portuguese rates.\\(^1\\) The terms offered in the case of lands that had long been waste were even more liberal, freedom from assessment for eight, ten, twelve, or fifteen years according to the state of the land and then several years of slowly increasing rental.\\(^2\\) These p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, besides their high position as large landholders, filled many offices, and hundreds of them acted as agents for the commandants of the hill forts. They were allowed by the state to buy and keep slaves to till their land.\\(^3\\) Afterwards (1800) when the country was given over to be rack-rented by revenue farmers, the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s would seem to have been able to resist the payment of the additional cesses, and this would seem to be the reason why, at the beginning of British rule, they were found to be holding land at lower rates than the Kunbis.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn the waste state of the district more help was wanted to spread tillage than the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s could give, and, from the beginning of Mar\u00e1tha rule, the practice of revenue farming was introduced. The practice as first introduced differed in two important points from the revenue farming that brought ruin on the district in the latter part of the Peshwa's rule. Farming was at first almost entirely confined to villages. The managers of sub-divisions were, as a rule, paid state servants who exercised an effective check on the abuses of revenue farmers.\\(^5\\) The farm was also granted for a term of years, generally six years, and it was for the farmer's interest to improve the village. He aided tillage by making advances of seed and money, by granting waste lands on specially low terms, and by striving to improve the village resources.\\(^6\\)\n\nIn the lands that were conquered from \u00c1ngria and the Jawh\u00e1r chief the Peshw\u00e1s do not seem for several years to have made any marked change in the system of assessment. In the Portuguese territory they levied not only the tax formerly received by the Portuguese government, but the rents collected by the landlords. As no part of the rent was spent in improving the country this change had a bad effect. But the injury was to some extent met\n\n---\n\n1 Reg. I. of 1808, sec. VIII. cl. 4.\n2 Replies to Rev.

Rec. 700 of 1836, 163-165.\n4 Of the origin of the specially low rates paid by the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s the records contain several explanations. Mr. Marriott in one place (Letter, 29th January 1820, in MS. Sel. 160, 56-61) explains the lower rate as a special concession to Br\u00e1hmans. But the lower rates were not confined to Br\u00e1hmans, and he afterwards (12th May 1820, MS. Sel. 160, 78-80) suggests that the special terms may have been originally granted to help to bring waste under tillage. Mr. Bax (5th May 1827, MS. Sel. 160, 421) traces the easy rates to their ignorance of field work. The explanation given in the text is Mr. Simson's. (23rd August 1826, MS. Sel. 160, 304). But though the chief difference was due to their power of resisting exactions, it would seem that originally they had been assessed at lighter rates than the others. See Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836, 150.\n5 This was not always the case. Replies to Rev. Queries, MS. Sel. 160, 754, 755.\n6 Replies to Rev. Queries, MS. Sel. 160, 746-748, 754, 755. Except when a deed or sanad was obtained from the public officers, the farmer's concessions were for one year only; ditto 747.\nby the easy terms which the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s soon began to offer for the tillage of waste lands, and for about twenty-three years the districts were fairly prosperous.\\(^1\\) Then (1761), during the minority of M\u00e1dhavr\u00e1v, the practice of farming villages for a year was introduced, many fresh cesses were levied, and the people were ground down by vague extras, *mogham chadh*, and by heavy demands for unpaid labour, *beg\u00e1r*. To some extent the higher classes were free from or were able to withstand these fresh demands. But this only increased the misery of the poor on whom the whole burden was thrown together with every kind of oppression to enforce its exaction. In 1772 an attempt was made to improve matters but with little success, and, in 1774, when S\u00e1lsette passed to the British, its state was most depressed.\\(^2\\) Inquiries then showed that the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s had introduced forty-six money and twenty-four grain cesses. These cesses included almost every possible subject of taxation, a charge for embankments, for religious worship, for cattle grazing, and for cutting firewood. Husbandmen, besides paying for their land, had to pay a straw and grass tax, and, if they grew vegetables, their onions, water melons, and pepper had to pay; if they had cows they had to pay a dairy tax; and if they had trees they had to pay liquor, oil, or fruit taxes. Fishermen had to pay a creek tax, two fish taxes, a prawn tax, and a boat tax. Traders had to pay a shop tax and a police cess.\\(^3\\)\n\nAbout the year 1770 a vigorous attempt was made to simplify and improve the system of assessment. The first survey of which record remains\\(^4\\) was in 1771-72, when the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* Trimbak Vin\u00e1yak surveyed Kaly\u00e1n, divided the land into *bigh\u00e1s*, arranged them into three classes according to the nature of the soil, and assessed each class at a *bigha* rate. In the same year the Vaish\u00e1khara petty division was surveyed by the *saranj\u00e1md\u00e1r* of Sinnar. In 1785-86 the three petty divisions, *mah\u00e1ls*, of Nasr\u00e1pur, Kothal Khal\u00e1t\u00ed, and Nehar were surveyed by the commandant of Shivgad. In 1788-89 Trimbak Vin\u00e1yak\u2019s survey of Kaly\u00e1n was revised by the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav. In 1793-94 the lands of Bassein, Ag\u00e1shi, Sanj\u00e1n, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, Nehar, and M\u00e1him were surveyed by the *m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r* Sad\u00e1shiv Raghun\u00e1th who measured the land into *bigh\u00e1s* and fixed the assessment. In 1795-96 a like survey of the petty division of V\u00e1sra was made by R\u00e1mr\u00e1v N\u00e1r\u00e1yan the commandant of R\u00e9jm\u00e1chi fort.\\(^5\\) In some of these surveys the land was divided into several classes according to the nature of the soil, each class being assessed at a different rate. In other surveys no distinction was drawn between the different classes of land; good and bad paid the same rent.\\(^6\\)\n\n---\n\n1 After twenty-three years cesses began to be added.

Sel. 160, 713, 714.\n6 Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821, in MS. Sel. 160, 139.\nOf the Mar\u00e1tha surveys the one most highly spoken of by the people was Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav's revised survey of Kaly\u00e1n (1788-89). He visited the land, classified it according to its fertility which he ascertained by experiments lasting over ten years, and fixed the government share at the money value of one-third of its average produce. The rates were 10s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-5) for first class land, 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) for second class, and 6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-3) for third class. Only the rice lands were measured. The hill lands were assessed at a money rate of 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) on a nominal bigha, which was an area estimated equal to a bigha with a due allowance for rock and underwood. Before fixing the amount of the village rental the new estimates were compared with the standard rates, dar d\u00e1m shirasta, all differences between the old rates and the proposed rates were referred to Poona, and the final amount determined according to the orders of the government. The total rentals, kam\u00e1ls, fixed in this way settled the demands for future years. Without orders from Poona the local officers had no power to ask anything over the full rental, kam\u00e1l jama.\n\nThese surveys remained in use for only a few years. With the close of N\u00e1na Fadnavis' management (1800) the attempt to levy a moderate and fair rental was given up. During the reign of the last Peshwa (1800-1817), who, under British protection, was heedless of unpopularity and anxious only to amass wealth, the practice of farming was extended from the farming of villages to the farming of sub-divisions t\u00e1luk\u00e1s and districts pr\u00e1nts. The farms were given to the highest bidders and the length of the lease was lowered from six to five or even to one year. Some one at court secured the farm; he sub-let it to a second speculator, and he again perhaps to three or four others. Between the original farmer and the people there were often several grades of middlemen, all of whom looked for a profit. Besides this the tenure of the farms was uncertain. On some frivolous pretext leases were often taken from one farmer and given to another. A revenue farmer had to make the most of his chance so long as it lasted.

Sel. 160, 142. The great famine of 1790 must also have thrown the revenue arrangements into confusion.\n\n5 The farmers were wholly unrestricted as to the amount of revenue to be levied from the people whom they were also permitted to fine at their discretion and\nmah\u00e1lkaris, generally became the revenue farmers, and, knowing\nthe secret sources of wealth, either raised the rates or levied fresh\ncesses.\\(^1\\) Up to the close of the eighteenth century the local officer\nhad no power to add to the rental. But under the last Peshwa the\nfarmer could raise the rent of any field he chose. If the holder\nrefused to pay the higher rate his land was taken from him and\ngiven to any one who would agree to the new rates.\\(^2\\) Thus in\nNasr\u00e1pur and several other sub-divisions, instead of three classes\npaying 10s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-5), 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4), and 6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-3),\na uniform rate of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) was levied from all lands that could\nyield an average crop. This rate was enforced from the Kumbis.\nBut the higher class of landholders, the Br\u00e1hman and Prabhu\np\u00e1ndharp\u00e9sh\u00e1s refused to pay more than 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4).\\(^3\\)\nIn other parts, such as south Kaly\u00e1n, Bassein and Sanj\u00e1n, the rents\nwere not changed, but cesses were added equal to fifty per cent\nof the old rental.\\(^4\\) In addition to these levies large sums were\ntaken from the husbandmen to meet village expenses. The sums\nwere levied by the headmen by an assessment in addition to the\ngovernment rental. The sum collected was spent in feeding\nreligious beggars, in giving village feasts, and in meeting sundry\nother charges.\\(^5\\)\n\nIn villages let to revenue farmers the farmer, or khot, made the\nsettlement with the husbandmen. In villages not let to farmers\nthe government officer or mah\u00e1lkari made the settlement with the\nheadman, p\u00e1t\u00edl or k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri, of the village.\\(^6\\) The p\u00e1t\u00edl settled the\npayments to be made by the different villagers. The whole rental\nwas levied by instalments.

When this was done the mah\u00e1lkaris and m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs were allowed interest on the payments made till they became due. If there was any shortcoming in the payment of a village rental the farmer had to make it good.\\(^1\\)\n\nIn the parts of the Kaly\u00e1n district that had been surveyed the villages paid a bigha cash rate. In other parts of Th\u00e1na the rent was a share of the produce. In the north of the district this share of the produce was taken in kind. In other parts it was commuted for a money payment which was fixed either on an average of the prices ruling at harvest time,\\(^2\\) or on the highest market price in the previous year.\\(^3\\) The villages made their money payments in Surat or Chinchvad rupees or by an assignment, han\u00e1la, on a banker. The mah\u00e1lkaris made similar transfers to the subhed\u00e1rs who took exchange bills from the local moneylenders on Poona bankers, from whom the amounts were recovered and paid into the Poona treasury. Occasionally drafts, var\u00e1ts, were granted to individuals for advances made by them at Poona, and the amounts collected from those on whom the drafts were drawn. Exchange was charged at the rate of ten per cent.\\(^4\\) Against the tyranny of the farmers there was no redress. Up to the end of the eighteenth century, if a local moneylender or revenue farmer was overbearing, the people complained to the local officers, and if the local officers gave them no redress they appealed to the government at Poona. Under N\u00e1na Fadnav\u00eds speedy justice was done. But under the last Peshwa the ill-used poor seldom had a hearing.\\(^5\\) Though sorely oppressed by these exactions the people did not fall into utter poverty. This would seem to have been mainly due to the fact that the Deccan was so ruined by the wars at the beginning of the present century that for many years after it continued to draw supplies of men and of grain from the Konkan. Many of the husbandmen entered military service,\\(^6\\) and the large area of arable waste gave those who remained not only the chance of moving from one village to another, but of securing waste lands which were offered on lease on very easy terms.\\(^7\\) In the disturbed state of the Deccan there was a great demand for Konkan rice.

XCVI, 125) the extensive tract of land known as the kh\u00e1r\u00e9d\u00e1pt was all or nearly all reclaimed under the Peshwa's rule, when it was customary to give leases of from twenty to thirty years before the full assessment was demanded. But the practice of giving leases for reclaiming salt lands was much older, and it seems probable that much of the kh\u00e1r\u00e9d\u00e1pt was reclaimed at a much earlier date. See Bom. Gov. Sel. CXLIV. 3.\n\np 310\u201471\nestablished and the people found a ready market for their grain near their homes and at high prices.\\(^1\\)\n\n**SECTION IV.\u2014BRITISH MANAGEMENT.**\n\nUnder British management S\u00e1lsette and Karanja improved but showly. In 1774, when S\u00e1lsette and Karanja were conquered by the English, the people were much depressed and the revenue was in arrears.\\(^2\\) A resident or chief and factors were appointed to S\u00e1lsette and a resident to Karanja.\\(^3\\) The system of collecting the revenue remained for a time unchanged. The villages continued to be put to auction, and the right of farming their revenues was as before made over to the highest bidder. The result was unsatisfactory. The people were wretched and the farmers often failed to pay the amounts they had bid. In 1788 revenue contracting was given up and the management of the villages was entrusted to Government officers. But the great famine of 1790 undid any improvement which the change of system might have caused. During the twenty-one years ending 1795, while the average amount claimed was \u00a319,556 (Rs. 1,95,560), the average collections were not more than \u00a317,721 (Rs. 1,77,210).\\(^4\\)\n\nIn 1798-99 a new system was introduced. All available Portuguese and Mar\u00e1tha records were examined, the petty taxes levied by the Portuguese and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s were abolished, the average produce of each village was ascertained, and the Government demand was fixed at one-third of the estimated average produce for all lands except shilotri lands, which, as they had been held on specially easy terms, were charged little more than one-fifth.\\(^5\\) In 1801 the grain share was for a term of ten years commuted to a money rental at the rate of \u00a32 (Rs. 20) the muda (25 mans) for white and \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 16) for red rice.\\(^6\\) At the same time arrangements were made for bridging the channel between S\u00e1lsette and Bombay. This work, the Sion causeway, was begun in 1799 and finished in 1803. In that year S\u00e1lsette again suffered very severely from famine. But the distress did lasting good to the island by forcing the repeal of the heavy customs dues which till then had been levied on all produce passing to Bombay.\\(^7\\) From this time the state of the island steadily improved. In 1807 (April) the Government share of rice had risen to 8324 mud\u00e1s or 860 mud\u00e1s more than the Government share in 1774. In the next year the returns showed 49,530 people, 11,328 houses, 16,995 cattle, 492 carts, and 431 boats. The part of the island near B\u00e1ndra was specially prosperous; it had a brisk coasting trade, and a good market for its vegetables.\\(^8\\) In 1810-11 the commutation rates were raised from \u00a32 to \u00a32 5s. (Rs. 20-Rs. 22\u00bd) for a muda of white rice and from \u00a31 12s. to \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 16-Rs. 17) for a muda of red rice.

In 1819 the state of Salsette was satisfactory. The average yearly rental had risen from \u00a318,924 (Rs. 1,89,240) in the ten years ending 1798 to \u00a322,763 (Rs. 2,27,630) in the twenty-one years ending 1819. To the state of Karanja the only reference that has been traced is, that much of the land was in the hands of middlemen who took from the husbandmen one-half of the produce.\n\nFrom the cession of the Peshwa's possessions in 1817, the revenue history of the district belongs to three periods. Eighteen years (1817-1835) of few changes in assessment and little advance in prosperity; nineteen years (1835-1854) of reduced rental and rapid advance; and twenty-seven years (1854-1881), since the beginning of the revenue survey, of slightly enhanced rates and gradual progress. The chief changes in the eighteen years ending 1835 were the establishment of village accountants in the place of revenue farmers, the reduction in the number of cesses, and the correction of individual cases of unequal assessment. The chief obstacles to progress were the prevalence of gang robberies, the want of a trained or trustworthy native agency, and a great fall in produce prices. When they were ceded to the British, the Peshwa's territories in the north Konkan were suffering from the excesses of gangs of robbers; much arable land was waste; the bulk of the people were miserably poor; and, in spite of the most minute and pitiless exactions, the revenue of the district was less than \u00a3140,000 (Rs. 14,00,000). To the general poverty Bassein was a marked exception. It was rich with sugarcane and plantains; perhaps in all India there was no spot more highly tilled. Under the system of revenue contracting and by the division and sale of their shares in the revenue the hereditary district officers had ceased to be of use. The stipendiary officers were almost all revenue contractors for sub-divisions and petty divisions, and the chief power in the villages was in the hands of the village contractor or khot. The village staff was generally represented by headmen and mahrds, and there was occasionally an assistant to the headman, who was called madhvi.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Langford, 28th November 1840, Bom.

So long as the rent was paid the land remained the property of the sut\u00edd\u00e1r, but if the sut\u00edd\u00e1r failed to pay his rent, Government could give it to another, provided there was no unexpired lease or ka\u00fal.\u2074 Lands known as sheri lands were the property of the state, and had either never been included in the village or had lapsed to the state. The profits went to government or to the revenue farmer, or other direct holder under government.\u2075 To encourage the tillage of arable waste the sub-divisional officer or kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r had been allowed to grant yearly leases of waste land at light rents under a tenure known as chikhal or dulandi.\u2076 It would seem that the prosperity of Bassein was in great measure due to the abuse of this privilege. By bribing the state officers the owners of the gardens arranged that their gardens should be examined a few weeks after the crop had been cleared off the ground. They were then entered as waste and granted at a nominal rent for the next year.\u2077 Another somewhat important tenure was the special service or iz\u00e1fat, on which the hereditary district officers held certain villages.

In 1845 in answer to the question how far the village communities were fit to manage local funds, the Collector Mr. Law reported that, compared with other Bombay provinces, the Konkan was remarkable for the feebleness of its village institutions. Except that every village had its hereditary p\u00e1til, village institutions could scarcely be said to exist. The p\u00e1tils were for the most part so incompetent and ignorant that they could not be trusted with the Government collections. They were not regarded with the same respect as the Deccan p\u00e1tils, probably because of the large number of Br\u00e1hmans and other high castes who were engaged in tillage. 9th September 1845, Th\u00e1na Collector's File, Reports on General Condition, 1843-1853.\n\n\u00b2 Mr. Marriott, 22nd June 1818, in MS.

The fraud was not found out till 1826, when it had reached an alarming height. Ditto. In 1822, before the true explanation of the prosperity of Bassein was known, the Bombay Government wrote (East India Papers, III, 774), 'The cultivation of sugarcane and plantains is very costly, somewhat hazardous, and requires a constantly floating large capital, the security of which seems not to have been affected by the rapacity of the Mar\u00e1tha officers.'\nfull rental from them and allowed the officers to remain their nominal proprietors, paying them by a percentage on their collections. Two classes of men held their lands on specially easy rates. These were the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s of whom an account has already been given, and the duland\u00eds or people of two villages who lived in one village and held land in another. The object of this practice was to take advantage of the very low rates at which waste land was let.\n\nThere were six leading forms of assessment, bigh\u00e1mi or bigha rate, dhep an unmeasured lump or parcel of land, toka or hunda meaning much the same as dhep, mogham or vague, ardhel or half share, and n\u00e1ngar or koyta a plough or sickle tax. The bigha rate varied greatly in different places. It was taken in money or in grain, or it was a cash commutation of a grain rent. The dhep or lump system, which has already been described, prevailed chiefly in Bassein and other places that had been under the Portuguese. Under this system the land was not measured, but the outturn of the crop was tested for three years and the rent fixed at one-half of the average yield. According to their yield the lands were arranged in the following order: eight adholis equal to one kudu, twenty kudus to one khandi, and four khandis to one muda. The muda ought to have been a fixed measure, but partly from the disorders that had crept in under the farming system, when the burden of the land tax was shifted more and more on the poorer holders, and partly from the opportunity for fraud which the ignorance of the first British officers offered, the muda varied from six to thirty-two mans. The form of assessment in use in the wild north-east was called toka or hunda, that is a piece or unmeasured plot of land varying from two to six bigh\u00e1s from which a grain rent was taken. The plot was divided into annas or sixteenths. The rent did not seem to be fixed in accordance with any rule or principle, but the amount was generally small. The vague, or mogham, assessment was a lump charge in kind or money, on a plot of land without reference to any standard of area or outturn. The half crop, or ardhel, system varied from year to year with the harvest; it was in force chiefly in lands reclaimed from the sea. The plough n\u00e1ngar, the hoe kudal, the sickle koyta, and the pickaxe, kurh\u00e1d, cesses, which were chiefly found in the wilder parts, varied in different places.\n\n1 Izbtfat villages were sometimes resumed and given to others in farm, the hakes being paid to the zamindars to whom they belonged.

It was thought best to continue the existing system till detailed information should be available.\\(^6\\) Though no great changes were made, the ordinary land tenure was so far modified that holders were allowed to sell, mortgage, or otherwise transfer their land, on condition that the person to whom it was made over was liable to pay the Government demand.\\(^7\\) The Collector proposed that the privileges of the *p\u00e1ndharpehs\u00e1s* should cease, but Government held that there was no sufficient reason why they should be discontinued.\\(^8\\) As regards the *dulandis*, the people who tilled in one village and lived in another, Government agreed with the Collector that as there was arable waste land in almost every village, nothing was gained by people going to other villages to till. They therefore decided to put a stop to the practice of granting outsiders specially easy rates.\\(^9\\)\n\nIn the Collector\u2019s opinion the land was not directly over-assessed. On the whole it perhaps paid less than the English collected in S\u00e1sette and Karanja. What made the Government demand oppressive was the number of extra cesses and the variety of rates which opened opportunities for fraud. The chief object was to sweep away the extra cesses and consolidate the Government demand into one fair tax, to let the people know beforehand what they had to pay, and to take their rents from them at the time when payment was easiest.\\(^10\\) The Collector proposed that the country should be surveyed and the Government demand fixed at one-third of the estimated produce.\\(^11\\) The rental should be, he thought, taken in\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821, in MS.

In this way he hoped that a class of landholders would be formed \u2018on the most unerring principles of nature.\u2019 Bom. Gov. Letter, 19th April 1822; East India Papers, III. 767.\nmoney not in grain. Grain payments required a costly machinery and left openings for fraud. As information would at first be scanty and perhaps misleading, it was not safe to make the rates permanent; they might, he thought, be introduced for twelve years.\n\nBefore deciding on his proposals Government called on Mr. Marriott to furnish a return of the different sources of revenue, especially of the cesses or taxes. In reply Mr. Marriott drew up a list of thirty-six cesses, and stated that there were many more which varied so greatly in different places that he thought it unnecessary to prepare a complete list. Government were not satisfied with this statement of cesses, and, in calling for a fuller list, noticed that whatever the defects of the present system might be Government could not attempt to change it without the fullest information. In December 1818, after a personal explanation of his views by Mr. Marriott, his proposals were sanctioned, and consent was given to the beginning of a survey. In November 1819 another order was issued limiting Mr. Marriott's operations to inquiry. No changes were to be introduced without specific instructions. Before this second order reached him Mr. Marriott had issued a proclamation to the effect that cesses were to be abolished. He was accordingly allowed to carry out this part of his plan and arrange for a corresponding change in the land revenue, to make good the loss caused by the repeal of the cesses. No other changes were to be made, and even for this change no promise of permanency was to be given and the Collector was to report on every step he took.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Marriott pressed on the work of survey. The principle of the survey was to ascertain the extent of land in cultivation, in view of an assessment on the basis that one-third of the gross produce should go to Government; to find out the area of arable waste; to discover the different kinds of tillage; and to classify the lands. A statement of the different kinds of land showed 236,089 bigh\u00e1s under tillage and 59,671 bigh\u00e1s of arable waste. The unit of measure was the rod of nine feet and 19-2 quarter inches which had been used in 1808 in surveying. After measuring them the rice lands were arranged into four classes each assessed at different rates. Garden land was, as before, assessed at a cash rental, except that instead of separate land and tree taxes only one cess was levied. To stimulate the spread of tillage waste lands were put to auction free of charge to the man who agreed to bring them under tillage in the shortest time. A class to whom the Collector was specially anxious to offer every inducement to settle were the wild hill tribes, the Kolis, Bhils, K\u00e1thkaris, and Th\u00e1kurs.

This rod was about eight per cent less than the old Mar\u00e1tha rod. But the people did not suffer, as in the Mar\u00e1tha surveys no account was taken of fractions between fifteen and twenty rods, and even 154 rods were entered as one pind or twenty rods. (MS. Sel. 160, 107-108). The table of measures was one rod of 9'4 feet equal to five hands and five fists, 20 square rods equal to one square pind, and 20 square pinds equal to one bigha of 35,344 square feet or about four-fifths of an acre.

They gained a scanty livelihood, partly by tilling forest patches and partly by hunting, but chiefly by plundering their more settled neighbours. Not only were they wretched themselves, but their love of plunder kept the villagers in constant alarm. So long as these tribes remained in the state in which they were, there was no hope for improvement in the parts of the country where they lived. It was of the highest consequence to win them to honest work by assuring them the enjoyment of a moderate share of the produce of their labour.\\(^1\\) Another class whom it was most important to reclaim to husbandry were the men, who, during the past disturbances, had forsaken their fields for military service. To these men the Collector offered plots of arable waste to be held free for eight years and then to be charged at the same rates as the surrounding fields.\\(^2\\) In consideration of the poverty of the district\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Mr. Marriott, 22nd June 1813, in MS.

Even with this deduction the spread of tillage and the transfer to Government of the revenue contractors' profits would, he estimated, raise the revenue of the ceded districts to \u00a3153,714 (Rs. 15,37,140) or \u00a314,555 (Rs. 1,45,550) more than the territory was expected to yield. The proposed system might, he thought, be introduced for six years and be applied both to the old or conquered, and to the new or ceded districts. The whole revenue would be \u00a3158,014 (Rs. 15,80,140), to which the conquered lands Salsette and Karanja would contribute \u00a34300 (Rs. 43,000).\n\nIn 1819 and again in 1820 the Collector complained of the size of his charge, of its poor and scattered villages, and of the labour caused by the small sums in which the revenue was collected. He urged that Th\u00e1na might be divided into two districts. Government were unable to agree to this proposal. The system of management was native agency and European superintendence, and no reduction in the size of the district could be made. In addition to the want of sufficient European superintendence the Collector had no trained or trustworthy native agency. The village accountants, or tal\u00e1tis, who were chosen in 1820, knew little of their charges. They lived in the sub-divisional towns and visited their villages only when the crops were being threshed. There was no check over them. Except when specially ordered the sub-divisional officers, or kam\u00e1visd\u00e1rs, never moved from their towns, and the Collector's secretary, daftard\u00e1r, never left head-quarters. To collect information of the revenue payments of the different villages was a hopeless task. The number of cesses and the variety of practice made it most difficult to find out what the different lands were supposed to pay. Even if this was ascertained the nominal assessment was often no guide to what the land had actually been paying. All classes were interested in keeping back information. The revenue farmer concealed the source of his gains and the villager kept dark the amount of his payments, trusting that the farmer would not make them known. To all these obstacles were added the trouble caused by the excesses of large gangs of freebooters, and ravages of cholera in 1818 and 1819 so severe that the district did not recover for ten years.\n\nUnder the weight of these troubles Mr. Marriott seems to have felt that his new survey and assessment would not by themselves\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Marriott, 11th July 1821, in MS.

In 1820 (14th August), looking at the state of the district, its wretched impoverished peasantry, its large tract of arable waste, and the great loss from bands of hill robbers, it seemed to him that the only hope for improvement was the creation of a class of large landholders. When the Government demand of a village was fixed by his survey, the village should, he thought, be leased for a term of five years to the chief representatives of the old district officials, the deshmukhs and deshp\u00e1ndes, and in cases where the old families had disappeared new appointments should be made. He proposed that the new class of landholders should be allowed to bring arable waste under tillage free of rent for five years, and that they should be made responsible for the police of the villages they held in farm. These proposals did not meet with the approval of the Government. They were opposed to the creation of a class of large landholders and their views were upheld by the Court of Directors.\n\nAs regards the survey Government admitted that the Collector had shown the existence of much disorder and abuse, and agreed with him that a good survey would remove many of the evils. But a survey which was not based on a full inquiry into the circumstance of the land could be a good survey, and they were doubtful whether the new settlement was based on a sufficiently minute knowledge of the district. Before the new assessment could be introduced the Government must clearly know how the land was measured and classified, how the crop was estimated, how the commutation from a grain to a money rental was fixed, and how the estimates were tested. A statement of the former and present rent of each village was also required. Mr. Marriott in a letter of the 10th July 1821 furnished certain observations and explanations, but the Government did not consider them satisfactory. It appeared that the person employed in the survey must have been too numerous to admit of the Collector's carefully testing their work. Mr. Marriott would have thought, have acted more wisely, if he had taken and personally supervised one sub-division. The measurements of his survey, if they were correct, would be useful, but the new rate could not safely be brought into use over the whole district. The Collector was directed to introduce the new settlement in one sub-division or in such extent of country as he could personally superintend, and to be careful to hear all complaints. In other parts of the district the character of the work was to be tested by the remeasurement and classification of a few villages by a fresh staff of surveyors. In taking these tests the measuring and the fixing of rates were to be entrusted to different sets of men. The assessors were to consult the natives as to the classing of the land and were to settle differences by calling councils or panch\u00e1yats from neighbouring villages.\n\nThese inquiries seem to have shown that the original measurement\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Marriott, 14th August 1820, in Th\u00e1na Collector's Outward File, 1820, 169-170.\n2 Revenue Letter to Bombay, 13th February 1822, East India Papers, III. 771-77.\n3 Gov. Letter, 21st Sept. 1821, in MS. Sel.160, 154-157. Compare East India Paper III. 776.\n4 Gov. Letter, 27th Nov. 1822, East India Papers, III. 777.\nand assessments were untrustworthy, and the attempt to introduce a survey and settlement was abandoned. Except that in most villages village accountants took the place of revenue contractors, the revenue continued to be collected on the same system as was in use when the district was ceded to the British. The season of 1824 was disastrous and the people suffered severely. This together with a demand for grain from the Deccan would seem for some years to have kept produce prices high, and the assessment though clumsy and irregular seems to have been moderate. The poverty of the people was in a great degree the result of their foolishness. Hard drinking, or rather gross intoxication, was so common that the Collector thought it would be advisable to cut down all but a few of the liquor-yielding trees. Bishop Heber, who travelled during the rains (June 27, 28) from Panvel to Khandala, describes the people as living in small and mean cottages with steep thatched roofs and very low side walls of loose stones. There was a general look of poverty both in their dress and field-tools. But their cattle were larger and better bred than Bengal cattle, and were in better case than might have been expected after so long a drought.\n\nIn 1825 the number of sub-divisions, talukas, was reduced from seventeen to nine, namely, Panvel, Salsette, Mahim, Bassein, Murbad, Sanjan, Nasirapur, Sakurli, and Kolvan. The Collector, Mr. Simson, again urged on Government the need of a survey. The existing system was full of mistakes and unevenness; nothing but the close inquiries of a survey could set it right. The Collector's proposals were approved; but the press of other duties on the Collector and his assistants and the want of any special staff of officers delayed the work. In 1825 and 1826 some parts of the district seem to have been surveyed by the Collector, partly by a revision of Mr. Marriott's measurements and partly by fresh measurements of his own.

Rec. 700 of 1836, 157) the establishment of peace had a powerful and instantaneous effect on grain prices. But in another passage (28th February 1836, Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836, 56-57) he says, that in 1820 the Poona demand still kept prices high. According to a calculation made for Nasirapur in 1836, in the early years of British rule, the cost of tillage of a bigha of sixty-two yards was 10s. (Rs. 5), the carriage to market 4s. (Rs. 2), the customs charges 1s. 6d. (12 as.), and the rent 9s. 6d. (Rs. 4-12). Rice was then Rs. 17 a khandi and the margin of profit 9s. (Rs. 4-8) a bigha. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836, 55-57.\n3 'I do not mean,' wrote Mr. Simson in 1826 (30th September), 'that the people are not occasionally called on to pay more than they are able. But I am confident that the portion of their payment that comes to the state is below what the most considerate would admit Government to be entitled to on every principle of kindness to the husbandman and regard to the general good of the country.'

The average number of villages in each sub-division was about 250, and the average yearly land and excise revenue of each village was between \u00a350 and \u00a360 (Rs. 500 and Rs. 600).

Under the British they had no direct duties, but were useful referees in cases of dispute and had considerable influence. They were paid three-fifths of five per cent on the revenue of their sub-divisions except in Nasr\u00e1pur where they were paid three-fifths of fifteen per cent. The sub-divisional accountants, deshp\u0101ndes or kulkarnis, kept the accounts of the revenue collections and balances.

He lived at Poona and received from \u00a3150 to \u00a3200 (Rs.1500 - Rs.2000) a year.\n\nThe officer who had the closest connection with the people was the village accountant or tal\u0101ti. He had charge of from eight to ten villages and was paid from \u00a312 to \u00a318 (Rs.120 - Rs.180) a year. The tal\u0101ti\u2019s duties were to live in his charge and visit each village frequently every month, to make known the people\u2019s wants to the sub-divisional manager, to superintend their general interests, to furnish the village accounts to the sub-divisional office, and to give to each landholder an account current showing his dues and payments. The dues were entered as soon as they were fixed at the yearly rent settlement.\n\nOf other village officers the chief was the p\u0101til. The p\u0101til\u2019s duties were to report when any settlers came to his village and when any of the old inhabitants left it, to stimulate the spread of tillage and explain its increase or decrease, to help in the rent settlement, to gather the village rental, and to pay it into the sub-divisional office. He was vested with the powers of a police officer and with a general control over the villagers. He saw that no part of their property was taken away. He sheltered them from oppression and tried to settle their disputes. In the Kaly\u00e1n sub-division the p\u0101til was paid by Government two-thirds of the proceeds of a five per cent charge on the village revenue. In the coast tracts in Bassein, S\u0101lsette, Bel\u00e1pur, Atgaon, and Kolvan, he was paid in land from half a bigha to ten or even twenty bigh\u00e1s. He was free from the house tax, the buffalo tax, and the tree tax. He was helped by the people who worked in his fields, and at marriages or other great ceremonies made him small presents in money or clothes. He had a claim to the service of village craftsmen, though from the want of craftsmen, this claim was of little value.\n\nUnder the p\u0101til there were in some villages assistants called madhv\u012bs who corresponded to the Deccan ch\u0101udh\u1e5bis. In some places they had a share of land or of the p\u0101til\u2019s percentage, and they were always free from the house, buffalo, and tree cesses.\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Simson, 11th November 1823, in MS. Sel. 160, 679-680.\n2 The estimated total receipts of the p\u0101t\u012bls were \u00a36400 (Rs.64,000). Of this \u00a35400 (Rs.54,000) represented the value of their lands estimated at p\u0101ndotra or five per cent of the early crop lands of the villages; \u00a3500 (Rs.5000) the value of their exemption from taxation; and \u00a3500 (Rs.5000) the proceeds of cesses levied direct from the people. The highest per cent of their share of the village revenue was 15 per cent at M\u0101him and the lowest 2\u00bd at Ag\u0101shi; the average amounted to 8\u00bd. MS. Sel. 160, 788-789.\nThe only other member of the village establishment was the Mh\u00e1r, who was styled kotv\u00e1l, k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri, n\u00e1yakv\u00e1di, and bhopi. Their duties were to watch the fields, to keep cattle from straying, to carry out the p\u00e1t\u00edl\u2019s orders and to act as porters. They got a share, generally one-third of the village officer\u2019s five per cent, panchotra, and apparently though this is not clearly stated, some grant of land in the coast districts where the five per cent allowance was not in force. They were also freed either entirely or partly from paying the house, buffalo, and tree cesses. From the rich they received presents of grain or money at marriages and other ceremonies, and from all villagers a small allowance of grain about one man from every field. Accountants or kulkarnis, gate-keepers or veskars, threshing-floor keepers or hav\u00e1ld\u00e1rs, and the twelve servants or b\u00e1ra bal\u00fat\u00e1s were unknown.\n\nThe forms of assessment differed little from those in use at the beginning of British rule. They were six in number, three of them in rice lands, a bigha rate bigh\u00e1vni, a lump assessment dhep, and a vague form of lump assessment hund\u00e1bandi or tok\u00e1bandi, one on garden lands, one on cold weather crops, and one on hill lands. Of the three forms of rice assessment the bigha rate was in force in the south-east sub-divisions, the dhep in the coast lands, and the hunda and tokibandi in the wilder north and north-east. The bigha rate included about three-fifths of the whole rice tillage. It was of two classes sweet rice land and salt rice land. In most sweet rice land the payment was in money and averaged 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) a bigha; in salt rice land the rent was taken in kind, and, according as Government or the landholder repaired the embankment, varied from one-half to one-third of the crop. The lump, or dhep, system was in force along the coast over an area of a little less than two-fifths of the whole rice tillage. A muda represented on an average the rental of about three bigh\u00e1s. But as already explained, from fraud and other irregular causes, the muda was in practice an arbitrary quantity varying from six to thirty-two mans. The tok\u00e1bandi the less regular form of the lump assessment was in use in about one-tenth of the area under the dhep system. It was found in the wild north-east and was said to have been introduced by the Jawh\u00e1r chiefs. The rates, though apparently fixed on no principle, had the advantage of being very light. Hund\u00e1bandi, also a lump assessment and very like the tok\u00e1bandi, was found in the inland parts of Sanj\u00e1n and included all cesses besides the land rent. Where the rents were payable in kind commutation cash rates were yearly fixed by the Collector. It was usual to fix the commutation rates according to the actual market price, deducting about ten per cent in favour of the husbandmen. If the people did not approve of the rates, they were allowed to pay in grain and the grain was sold by auction on account of Government. The only lands that were assessed as garden lands were in Bassein,\n\n---\n\n1 Rev. Answers, 31st October 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 789.\n2 Mr. Simson, 11th November 1828, in MS.

In Bassein and M\u00e1him they paid both a bigha rate and a tree tax, and in S\u00e1lsette a bigha rate of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd). In Kaly\u00e1n, rice lands that yielded a cold-weather crop such as til, khur\u0101shi, or hemp, were charged 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) a bigha in addition to the bigha rate for rice. The plough, hoe, sickle, and pickaxe cesses continued unchanged in uplands and hill lands.\n\nMost of the minor land cesses had been repealed, and of those that were not repealed almost all were in abeyance. Though the other cesses had been greatly reduced there remained many taxes on trade, houses, market stalls, female buffaloes, tobacco, grocery, cattle, and liquor trees. Transit dues, wood-cutting fees, ferry fees, and liquor licenses yielded between \u00a330,000 and \u00a340,000 (Rs. 3,-4 l\u0101khs).\n\nRevenue superintendence was, in the first instance, vested in the village headmen and accountants. The village officials were checked by the sub-divisional manager, kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r, and his establishment, and the sub-divisional establishment was in turn controlled by the head-quarter secretary or daftard\u00e1r, who made the yearly rent settlement, jam\u00e1bandi. When the landholder paid his rent a receipt was passed by the tal\u00e1t\u00ed in the p\u00e1t\u012bl's name and in his presence; when the village revenue was paid the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r granted a receipt; and when the sub-divisional revenue was paid at headquarters the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r received a receipt from the Collector.\n\nVillages were managed by Government officers and their rents collected from the individual landholders. Except in the case of waste lands neither villages nor holdings were granted in lease. The village rent settlement, jam\u00e1bandi, was made with the landholders. A husbandman paid for his fields what he had paid the year before. If he took fresh land that had been tilled by some one else he paid the rent the former holder had paid; if the land had been fallow he was allowed certain remissions; and if he took waste land he paid according to the lease system, the basis of which was one-third of the estimated yield, the share of grain being changeable into a money rent. The settlement was in the first instance made by the accountant and the p\u00e1t\u012bl. After inquiries the accountant drew up a statement of the changes in the tillage area, noting the causes of change. The assessments of fallow lands were deducted and those of freshly tilled lands were added. These statements were examined by the kam\u00e1visd\u00e1r and his clerks, who visited the village near harvest time. They corrected errors and confirmed the amended statements. The amended statements were kept with the p\u00e1t\u012bl and accountant until the daftard\u00e1r came to make the yearly rent settlement. The daftard\u00e1r examined the accounts, and, if he thought them unsatisfactory, he set his clerks to make local inquiries. Then the\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Simson, 11th Nov. 1828, in MS. Sel. 160, 668-669.

The amount due from each landholder was fixed and a list of the payments to be made by each was fastened on the village office or ch\u0101vdi, bearing the seal and signature of the Collector or of his assistant. The details of the settlement were entered in the village revenue statement or chittha, in which all changes were shown in full.\\(^1\\) The land revenue was collected in three instalments, the first between the beginning of December and the middle of January, the second between the middle of January and the end of February, and the third between the end of February and the 13th of April. S\u012byar revenue was collected before land revenue between the middle of October and the end of November, and garden rents were taken as late as the middle or end of May.\\(^2\\) As a safeguard for the payment of the revenue it had formerly been usual to make one village responsible for another, according to the system known as the chain surety, s\u0101nkli j\u0101min. But in 1828 security was as a rule no longer required.\\(^3\\) With the object of increasing the area under tillage the sub-divisional manager, at the rent settlement time, explained to the people that Government would make advances for the purchase of cattle or seed, or to support the husbandman till his crop was ripe. He found out what the wants of the village were and applied for sanction to the payment of advances. Leases for waste lands were granted and a register forwarded to head-quarters.\\(^4\\)\n\nThere was not much difficulty in getting in the rents. Improvements had lately been made and the assessment was so light that in ordinary years it could be realized without pressure.\\(^5\\) Deficiencies arising from the failure of individuals to pay were always remitted at the time of settling the next year's rent.\\(^6\\) Besides the Government rental the villagers continued to pay the p\u0101t\u012bl about ten per cent more to meet the village charges.\\(^7\\)\n\nIn 1828 a survey seems to have been introduced into one or two of the petty divisions of Panvel.

One cause of this failure would seem to be the marked fall in prices. The Panvel returns show for a khandi of rice \u00a31 13s. (Rs. 16\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) in 1826-27, \u00a31 10s.

By this arrangement the nine taluk\u00e1s of the northern district and the three most northern taluk\u00e1s of the southern district, together yielding a land and customs revenue of \u00a3280,000 (Rs. 28,00,000), were placed under a Principal Collector at Th\u00e1na, and the five remaining taluk\u00e1s, with a revenue of \u00a3100,000 (Rs. 10,00,000), were attached to Ratn\u00e1giri.\n\nIn August 1830 Mr. Reid, the Principal Collector, wrote strongly in favour of the grant of villages in lease to the headmen or other men of capital. In his opinion the grant of periodical leases would yield the best results. Every inducement should, he thought, be held out to engage the more respectable classes to become intimately connected with the husbandmen, whose poverty destroyed all hope of advancement, if they were left to their own resources. Though there was not much available capital in the Northern Konkan, many respectable persons might, he thought, be willing to invest in land the little they possessed if favourable terms were offered them. The measure he considered would not only simplify the revenue management, but might be of much use in improving the police. Still in spite of the Collector's strong feeling in its favour and of the approval and sanction of Government, except in S\u00e1lsette where several villages were granted in lease, the system does not seem to have been carried out in any part of the district. In spite of the fall of prices 1829 would seem to have been a good season and the Northern Konkan with a marked increase in land and customs revenue is reported to have been flourishing. But 1830-31 and again 1832-33 were bad years, and, though after the second failure of crops there was a considerable rise, produce prices were still very low, and, especially in the Kaly\u00e1n division where the rents were taken in cash, the people were greatly depressed. 'In the past fifteen years,' wrote the Collector in 1833, 'the district instead of improving has gone back. The face of the country has the same primitive and wild appearance that it has worn for ages.' He complained of the roughness and want of system in the assessment and asked that some change might be made. In his opinion the system of granting villages in lease had been most successful in S\u00e1lsette and should be extended to the rest\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Reid, Principal Collector, 12th August 1830, in MS. Sel. 160, 856-857.\n2 In 1830 Mr. Reid found that owing to the continued cheapness of grain, except in S\u00e1lsette, no villages had been granted for a term of years, a measure which had been proposed by Mr. Boyd.

Rec. 870 of 1838, 101) it rose from \u00a31 (Rs. 10) in 1831-32 to \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) in 1833-34. Three causes seem to have combined to lower prices, the spread of tillage, the import to Bombay of grain from Malabar, and the burden of transit duties, Mr. Davies, 19th May 1836, in Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836, 155-157.\n6 In the southern sub-divisions (S\u00e1nkshi, R\u00e1juri, and R\u00e1vgad) now in Kolaba where the assessment was taken almost wholly in kind, matters were not so bad.

Major Jervis who wrote about the same time (1835), though he held that, except in some places on the coast, both the acre rate and the rate on estimated produce were very light, admitted that the district was less flourishing than the cess-burdened south. This in his opinion was due to the great scarcity of water, the unhealthiness of the wastes and forests, the scanty supply of people and cattle, and the want of rich proprietors. The hilly tracts in the south of Thana, though much richer than the Ratnagiri hills, were so overrun with forest, brushwood, bamboo, and lemon grass, and the ripening crops were so exposed to the attacks of locusts, deer, bears, and wild hogs, water was so scarce, and the people so reduced by former misrule that there was little tillage.\n\nFrom this year begins the second period, the time of revised and reduced assessment. In consequence of the Collector's account of the very unsatisfactory state of his charge a special inquiry was ordered. The inquiry shewed a pressing need for reducing the Government demand. The revision of assessments was sanctioned, and between 1835 and 1842 was carried out except in the north of the district. The reductions were very liberal including about twenty per cent of the rental and the abolition of transit duties. The result was a rapid spread of tillage and a marked improvement in the state of many of the people. In 1835 the previous season had been bad. The rainfall was scanty and untimely, and a large area was thrown out of tillage. In May of that year, Mr. Williamson, the Revenue Commissioner, examined the Kalyan sub-division. What he saw satisfied him that from the fall in the money value of rice, the money rate, though not originally excessive, had come to represent far too large a share of the produce. Mr. Williamson calculated that the average produce of a bigha of good rice land was about 22 mans, which, according to the market prices of late years, was worth about \u00a31 4s. 3d. (Rs. 12-2). The cost of labour in preparing the land might, he thought, be estimated at about 12s. (Rs. 6), and as the rent was 10s. 3d. (Rs. 5-2) only one rupee of profit was left. A few months later (November 1835) he wrote, that the condition of Kalyan, Panvel, and Nasirapur, the proportion the rent bore to the produce, the yearly remissions, the balances, the untilled tracts, the wretched state of the bulk of the people, were convincing evidence of over-assessment. The rental of these sub-divisions should, he thought, be revised. Nowhere was a change more wanted than in Nasirapur, under the Sahyadri hills, whose highly taxed produce was carried over bad roads to distant markets. In some parts of Nasirapur, known as the Koli Khalti mahals, the people were better off as they were allowed to\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Giberne, 15th August 1833, in Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 550 of 1834, 297-306.

Still the assessment was too high, the villages lay close under the Sahy\u00e1dris, and to take their produce to market the people had a long rough journey. Kaly\u00e1n was in much the same state. About 14,000 bigh\u00e1s of arable land lay waste and the people were miserably clothed and very wretched. Panvel, near a good market, was rather better. In none of the three sub-divisions were there either roads or carts.\n\nIn consequence of Mr. Williamson\u2019s report Mr. Davies was chosen to revise the assessment. The measurements of Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav\u2019s survey were accepted, and the work of revising the rates was begun in 1836. In Nasr\u00e1pur inquiries showed that the rents had for years been largely in arrears, eighteen per cent behind in the ten years ending 1834-35, and twenty-nine per cent during the last seven of the ten. This was not due to any weakness on the part of the collectors of revenue or to any understanding between them and the people. On the contrary the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r had ruined himself by the extreme rigour of his collections. The chief objects of the revision were, in Mr. Davies\u2019 opinion, to lower the rental, to reduce the number of rates of assessment, and to abolish cesses. His inquiries into the state of the people showed that they were suffering grievously from the fall in the value of produce. Fifteen years before when the Deccan was crowded with troops, the produce of the villages under the Sahy\u00e1dris was in keen demand for the Poona market. The husbandmen found a ready sale for their rice, either on the spot or in some local market, and realised about \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 17) a khandi. In 1835 eighteen years of peace had made the Deccan a supplier not a consumer of grain, and the husbandmen of the inland parts of Th\u00e1na had no market nearer than Bombay. Sea communication chiefly with the Malabar coast kept the Bombay market well supplied, and the price of rice in Bombay was about \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 17) the khandi, or nearly the same price that fifteen years before the husbandman had realised in his field or in the local markets. Of this \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 17) not more than \u00a31 (Rs. 10), and in many years less than \u00a31 (Rs. 10) reached the husbandmen. The cause of these ruinously low prices was partly the roughness of the country and the want of roads. There were no carts and the cost of pack bullocks was heavy. But the chief cause was the transit dues which were equal to a charge of about 4s. 3d. (Rs. 2-2) on every khandi of rice. Under this burden the husbandman\u2019s profit was reduced to almost nothing, and until the duties were repealed little improvement could be looked for.\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Rev.

His chief proposals were in the case of the Kunbis to reduce Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav's two classes of 10s. (Rs. 5) and 8s. (Rs. 4) to one class of 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd), and to fix a second class at 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) instead of 6s. (Rs. 3). In the case of hill tribes, Th\u00e1kurs and K\u00e1thkaris, he proposed a reduction from 5s. to 3s. (Rs. 2\u00bd - Rs. 1\u00bd) in the plough rate and from 3s. to 2s. (Rs. 1\u00bd - Re. 1) in the billhook or kuh\u00e1d rate. In the case of the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, who in several respects had suffered seriously from the change from the Mar\u00e1tha to the English Government, he proposed that their specially low rates should be continued and that they should pay 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) instead of 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd). This represented a fall in the Government land-tax from \u00a313,048 to \u00a310,680 (Rs. 1,30,480 - Rs. 1,06,800) or about twenty per cent. Inquiries into the subject of cesses showed that though they were very numerous, very troublesome, and very liable to abuse, they did not yield more than four per cent of the whole revenue. Mr. Davies recommended that half of them should be abolished.\n\nMr. Davies embodied the results of his\n\n(Rs. 4-12), cost of tillage 10s. (Rs. 5), carriage to market 4s. (Rs. 2), customs 1s. 6d.

(Rs. 5-8), exchange 5\u00bcd. (3\u00bd annas), customs 4s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-2-6), tillage 10s. (Rs. 5), carriage and freight 5s. 6d. (Rs. 2-12), total \u00a31 11s. 3d. (Rs. 15-10), value in Bombay \u00a31 1\u00bcs. (Rs. 17), balance 2s. \u00bed. (Rs. 1-6). Mr. Davies, 28th February 1836, in Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836, 56-64.\n\n1 See footnote 1 on page 559.\n\n2 Of the hill Th\u00e1kurs and K\u00e1thkaris he wrote, 'They are as distinct in habits, religion, and appearance from all other classes, as if they belonged to another country. They cannot properly be termed cultivators, although they endeavour to eke out a scanty subsistence by tilling patches of mountain land. For the rest they are hunters, robbers, or basket-makers according to circumstances. Yet even these poor wretches have been taught to feel the weight of a land tax. The common method of assessing them is to rate their ploughs at a certain rate, generally 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) besides exchange, or the tax is levied on the billhook with which they clear the land; 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) per billhook has been hitherto demanded. Those hereditary oppressors of the people, the district officers, take from many of them perquisites in kind also. I would recommend that the rate per plough be reduced to 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) and that of the kuh\u00e1d or billhook to 2s. (Re. 1). The very small extent of cultivation at present carried on by these poor but laborious classes (the assessment of which does not exceed \u00a340 (Rs. 400) throughout the whole tiluka of Nasr\u00e1pur), as well as the policy of reclaiming them and making them industrious members of the community which they now harass by robbing, is of more consequence than any small loss of revenue.'

The chief changes were reducing the old bigha rates of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) to 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) in Bor\u00e9ti; 8s. 3d. (Rs. 4\u00bd), 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd), and 6s. (Rs. 3) in Vankal; 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) in Nasr\u00e1pur and to 8s. 3d. (Rs. 4\u00bd) in V\u00e1sundri and V\u00e1sra. Mr. Langford, 26th February 1842, in Bom. Gov. Rev.

The cesses belonged to two main classes those levied from husbandmen and those levied from traders and craftsmen. The husbandman's cesses came under four groups, tas\u00e1r, kas\u00e1r, pati, and veth. Under tas\u00e1r came eight levies on straw, pulse, gunny bags, butter, fowls, rain-shades, firewood, and gourds. Kas\u00e1r included a number of exactions levied in connection with the commutation of grain for cash. Under pati there were a host of levies including a tobacco tax, a hearth tax, and a cart tax. Of veth or unpaid service, there were three instances, fort service, grain carrying service, and pati's service. Of non-agricultural cesses there was a license, moht\u00e1rfa, tax on traders, a levy in kind from all craftsmen, a special levy on rice cleaners, on firewood for funerals, on stamping measures, on cotton, and on salt. Many of these cesses were illegal but the people went on paying them fearing to annoy the officers who benefited by them. See Mr. Davies, 8th October 1836, in Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 746 of 1836, 195-231, 271-272; and Mr. Giberne, 13th April 1837, in Rev. Rec. 775 of 1837, 111-114.\nenquiries in two elaborate and masterly reports. His conclusions were accepted and his proposals for simplifying and lightening the Nasr\u00e1pur assessment were approved and sanctioned. His demonstration of the crushing effect of the transit duties was rewarded by their abolition over the whole Presidency.\n\nIn the next season (1836-37), of the six petty divisions of Panvel five were revised by Mr. Davies. Only three of the five had before been measured. In the other two the land was taxed 'under a most extraordinary system.' The data, if there ever had been data, were lost and forgotten, and the general principle was for Government to demand the same amount in lump every year leaving the internal adjustment to the p\u00e1t\u00eds and the people. Payments were generally in grain, and if remissions were granted they were apportioned according to the share that each man had paid. The villages had been surveyed by Mr. Simson in 1827-28. But the rates he had proposed were too high and things had remained unchanged. In the three petty divisions that had been surveyed and assessed by Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav (1788), the original three grades had, as in other parts of the district, been forced by the owners into one class, and, on this, other rates in money and kind but chiefly in kind, had been heaped till the assessment ate up half the crop. The assessment was levied neither on the land nor on the crop but on the individual. The p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00f3s formed one class and the Kunbis another, and among the Kunbis there were endless varieties of payments originally based on the circumstances of the individual, or the immediate wants of the revenue contractor. As long as the proprietary right of a landholder sheltered him, so long only was the farmer kept from exacting the utmost rental. Once the landholder was driven from his field by the farmer's exactions the assessment became half of the crop. So elaborately had this system been carried out, that in one village accountant's charge there were often as many as eighteen grades of assessment, eight in kind and ten in cash. The number of rates puzzled the people, delayed the preparation of the village accounts, and gave the accountant an opening for fraud. The revenue contractors had raised the rates by trickery as well as by force. Proofs were abundant that it had been by no means uncommon for a contractor to persuade the people to heap low dams across their fields and grow rice. At first there was little increase in the contractors' demands. But when the banks were finished the land was entered as kharif and full rice rates were levied ever after. Its position on the coast, its freedom from the bulk of the transit dues, and its nearness to Bombay helped to keep prices high in Panvel. While in Murb\u00e1d and other inland parts the people did\n\n---\n\n1 Dated 28th February 1836 and 19th May 1836, Bom. Rev. Rec. 700 of 1836.\n2 Gov.

(Rs. 13).\u00b9\n\nIn spite of this advantage the state of Panvel was bad. The people were poor, depressed, and ignorant; there were no roads and no carts, and few husbandmen had any bullocks. They had to hire cattle from the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s and had to pay for the season twelve mans of rice for a pair of bullocks and fourteen mans for a pair of buffaloes.\u00b2 The chief changes which Mr. Davies proposed, all of which were approved and sanctioned by Government, were to lower the rental until it represented about one-third of the whole yield, to group the lands into three classes, to abolish extra cesses, to make rates uniform, and to pay the hereditary district officers from the Government rental.\u00b3 With the consent of the people the new rates were taken in cash instead of in kind. In this year, also, in Bel\u00e1pur or Taloja, instead of the old commuted grain rates, a uniform money rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) a bigha was introduced; the change involved a reduction of \u00a31850 (Rs. 18,500) in the Government rental.\u2074\n\nIn 1837 the revision was extended to Murb\u00e1d which was described as more highly assessed and worse off for markets than almost any part of the Konkan. It was depressed by a more than commonly excessive taxation and much of its rich land lay waste.\u2075 The local price of rice had fallen from about \u00a31 12s. (Rs. 16) to from 16s. to \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 8-Rs. 12) the khandi. Of a rental of \u00a312,000 (Rs. 1,20,000) \u00a34700 (Rs. 47,000) were outstanding. The people had improved little if at all under British management.\u2076\n\nThe original Mar\u00e1tha bigha rates of 10s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-5) for first class, 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) for second class, and 6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-3) for third class rice land had been raised by the farmers to one rate of 11s. (Rs. 5-8) for Kunbis, 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) for p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, and\n\n\u00b9 The details are, 1826-27, \u00a31 13s. (Rs. 13\u00bd); 1827-28, \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15); 1828-29, \u00a31 5s. (Rs. 12\u00bd); 1829-30, \u00a31 1s.

Rec. 775 of 1837, 125-138.\n6s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-3) for Th\u00e1kurs. Under the English these rates had remained unchanged. The abolition of the transit dues had done great good in Murb\u00e1d, as the habits of the people enabled them to gain the full benefit of the remission by carrying their produce to good markets. The local price of rice had risen from 18s. or \u00a31 (Rs. 9 or Rs. 10) a khandi to \u00a31 6s. (Rs. 13). Still the rates pressed very heavily and left an estimated bigha profit of only 6s. to 9s. (Rs. 3 - Rs. 4\u00bd). A reduction was proposed in rice land for Kunbis from 11s. to 8s. (Rs. 5\u00bd - Rs. 4), for p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s from 8s. 6d. to 7s. (Rs. 4\u00bd - Rs. 3\u00bd), and for Th\u00e1kurs from 6s. 4\u00bdd. to 6s. (Rs. 3-3 - Rs. 3), and in uplands from 3s. 2\u00bdd. to 2s. (Rs. 1-9-6 - Re. 1). These proposals were approved by the Commissioner and sanctioned by Government. They represented a sacrifice of \u00a31396 (Rs. 13,960), being a fall from \u00a39383 to \u00a37987 (Rs. 93,830 - Rs. 79,870).\n\nIn the same year (1836-37) the garden lands of Bassein were examined by Mr. Williamson. So heavily were they taxed that a large area had fallen out of tillage and a reduction of nearly 100 per cent was found necessary. In the next season (1837) an important change was made in the assessment of the Bassein petty division of M\u00e1nikpur. The people were Christians, hardworking and skilful husbandmen. They were very highly assessed paying cesses besides a very heavy parcel or toka rate. They got fair prices for their rice, the average market rate during the ten years ending 1836 being 30s. (Rs. 15) a khandi, of which the growers probably secured from \u00a31 4s. to \u00a31 6s. (Rs. 12-Rs. 13). Mr. Giberne was satisfied that a reduction should be made, and his proposals to introduce bigha rates of 7s., 6s., and 5s., were sanctioned by Government though they involved a sacrifice of from \u00a3605 (Rs. 6050) to \u00a3396 (Rs. 3960) or a reduction of 34 per cent. In this year also the garden rates in M\u00e1him were revised by Mr. Davidson. Kaly\u00e1n was considered one of the most highly assessed parts of the district. But no officer could be spared to revise the rates. As he was unable to go into the details of the settlement,\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Coles, 5th April 1837, Rev. Rec. 775 of 1837, 125-126. In some parts, Khedul, Jada, Sirosi, and V\u00e1sh\u00e1khra, the land had not been surveyed, and was assessed on the parcel, tok\u00e1bandi or hund\u00e1bandi, system.

LXXIII. 12.\nMr. Giberne in 1837-38 proposed, and his suggestion was approved, that all existing rates should be reduced by 2s. (Re. 1) for Kunbis and by 1s. (8 as.) for p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s, until arrangements could be made for a complete revision. This change implied a sacrifice of \u00a32214 (Rs. 22,140) of revenue and was probably a greater reduction even than that made by Mr. Davies. The amount of the reduction continued to be entered as a remission until 1842-43, when it was finally written off. In 1840 Mr. Giberne revised Bhiwandi, reducing the assessment by \u00a31300 (Rs. 13,000). His proposals were finally sanctioned in 1842-43.\n\nThis completed the parts of the district in which the general pitch of assessment was too high. However rough and in individual cases oppressive the rates in the rest of the district might be, they were on the whole moderate. The people were freed from the burden of transit duties, and, as a rule, had a sure and easy market for their produce. Except a small portion of Bassein where a heavy irregular cess had caused much injury, the coast districts were in fair condition. Salsette was specially flourishing. It was one of the happiest parts of the British territory. Owing to the failure of rain in 1835 about thirty-seven per cent was untilled, but in ordinary years not a spot of arable land was waste. Care had been taken that the assessment should not represent more than one-third of the produce. And though the soil yielded only second and third class rice, there was a good market close at hand. Prices were fairly high, ranging, in a fair season, from \u00a31 16s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 18-Rs. 20) the muda, and grass and straw fetched a high price as well as grain. The roads were good and there were no cesses or tolls. Farm stock was abundant. There were more than 2000 carts and the people were fairly clothed.\n\nThe effect of the general lowering of the Government demand was a fall in the rental from \u00a3294,600 (Rs. 29,46,000) in 1833-34 to \u00a3170,400 (Rs. 17,04,000) in 1837-38 or a sacrifice of \u00a3124,200 (Rs. 12,42,000). The result of these liberal remissions was immediate and most marked. All and more than had been hoped from the change was realised. In Nasrapur in 1836-37 the second year of revised rates, increased tillage yielded a rental of \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) and the revised rates were collected without a murmur. The next season 1837-38 was unfavourable, and much loss was caused by a storm on the 15th of June that washed away the rice banks. In the parts of the district where reductions had not been made large remissions were neces-\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Langford, 26th February 1842, in Rev. Rec. 1348 of 1842, 50-51. See also Rev.

In the revised sub-divisions, not only was the revenue realised without complaint, but there was a great spread of tillage yielding in Nasr\u00e1pur a revenue of \u00a3640 (Rs. 6400) and of \u00a3550 (Rs. 5500) in Kaly\u00e1n. Next year (1838-39) a failure of rain caused much distress. Most liberal remissions had to be made amounting in Sanj\u00e1n to one-half of the rental, and in R\u00e1jpuri to one-fourth. In the revised districts one-fifth had to be granted in Kaly\u00e1n, but a fifteenth was enough in Murb\u00e1d, a twentieth in Nasr\u00e1pur, and a thirtieth in Panvel. In spite of the bad season there was a marked spread of tillage especially in Murb\u00e1d and Kaly\u00e1n. The next season (1839-40) was more favourable and the revised sub-divisions again compared well with the others. In them less remission than in other parts of the district had to be granted, and all the revenue except \u00a313 (Rs. 130) was realised.\n\nIn the opinion of Government the result of the abolition of transit duties and other objectionable items was highly satisfactory. New markets had been opened to the people, tillage was spreading, land had become an object of contention, and the old holders were coming back to their original fields. The improvement continued in 1840-41. The revenue rose from \u00a3145,862 to \u00a3154,481 (Rs. 14,58,620 - Rs. 15,44,810), the remissions fell from \u00a310,924 to \u00a34164 (Rs. 1,09,240 - Rs. 41,640), and, at the close of the year, the outstanding were only \u00a3632 (Rs. 6320). The progress of the revised districts was most marked. In Kaly\u00e1n, where revenue had risen and tillage spread more than anywhere else, there were no complaints, the people were anxious that present rates should continue. In Nasr\u00e1pur tillage had risen from 27,367 bigh\u00e1s in 1834-35 to 31,254 bigh\u00e1s in 1838-39 and collections from \u00a38831 (Rs. 88,310) in 1835-36 to \u00a311,649 (Rs. 1,16,490) in 1840-41. In Murb\u00e1d in five years the spread of tillage more than made good the sacrifice of revenue, the rental in 1840-41 being \u00a39398 (Rs. 93,980) or \u00a316 (Rs. 160) above the maximum levied in 1836. In Panvel the collections rose from \u00a316,686 (Rs. 166,860) in 1837-38 to \u00a317,263 (Rs. 1,72,630) in 1840-41 or an increase of \u00a3577 (Rs. 5,770).\n\nWhile the assessment of the south and south-east was thus lightened\u2014\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Coles, 18th September 1838, in Rev.

Mr. Simson, Rev. Com., 1st April 1842, in Rev. Rec. 1348 of 1842, 12.\ned and simplified, the original clumsy and uncertain practice was continued in the north and along the coast. About Kolv\u00e1n the largest, poorest, and most secluded part of the district the information was very scanty. When the British occupied the country no trustworthy papers were found. The village headmen and district officers went over the villages with the British officers, and gave them a note of the amount and the character of the assessment on the different plots of land. In 1842 there were no fewer than six modes of assessment. Of these the most common, including about one-half of the whole; was the mud\u00e1b\u00e1ndi. Under this the khandi of land varied from one to nine bigh\u00e1s, and the assessment from 6s. to \u00a33 (Rs. 3-Rs. 30). The second mode was the tok\u00e1b\u00e1ndi. The toka of land varied, according to its character, from a half to four bigh\u00e1s, and its rental varied according as it was near or far from a market. The plough-cess or n\u00e1ngarbandi was in force over a small area in Mokh\u00e1da, the cess varying from 4s. to \u00a31 8s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 14), and the greatest area under one plough being ten bigh\u00e1s. A special form of the parcel or plot cess, locally known as k\u00e1sbandi, was in force to a small extent. The plots or holdings varied in size from nine to forty bigh\u00e1s and paid from \u00a33 to \u00a316 (Rs. 30-Rs. 160). The rates had never been changed and the revenue collected in this way amounted to \u00a3172 (Rs. 1720). These four were old systems and had been in force when the lands had formed part of the Jawh\u00e1r state. In some cases the assessment was high. But in the Collector's opinion excess of assessment should be met by individual reductions; the country was too wild and too thinly peopled to be surveyed. The remaining systems were the bigha rate or bigh\u00e1vni, and the hill tillage or dongar dali. The bigha rate of 8s. (Rs. 4) was in use over only a very small area. Hill tillage prevailed in Tal\u00e1sri, Vaish\u00e1khra, and G\u00e1rgaon, the wild parts of Mokh\u00e1da. The p\u00e1t\u00edls and tal\u00e1t\u00eds made a rough guess survey of these lands and levied a bigha rate. Unlike other parts of the Konkan, the people of Mokh\u00e1da who were mostly K\u00e1thkaris V\u00e1rlis and Th\u00e1kurs, were unsettled, rarely spending two years in the same spot. They moved from place to place, squatting where they found arable waste and having their patches of tillage roughly measured when the crop was ripe. They suffered much oppression at the hands of the p\u00e1t\u00edls and tal\u00e1t\u00eds. If the land cultivated was varkas, it paid a bigha rate of 1s. (8 as.). In 1842, on the recommendation of the Collector a tax of 1s. (as. 8) was fixed for every pickaxe, kudal, and the bigha rate was abolished. The other parts of the district, Sanj\u00e1n M\u00e1h\u00edm and Bassein except Bassein island, were in 1842 described as thinly peopled and miserably tilled. Mr. Vibart was convinced that this was in great measure owing to the wretched revenue system, and that a fixed bigha rate would cause a great spread of tillage.\n\nThree years later (1845) Mr. Davidson, then assistant collector, prepared a careful account of the three coast sub-divisions, Bassein\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Langford, Collector, 26th February 1842, in Rev. Rec. 1348 of 1842, 56.\n2 Mr. Langford, 26th February 1842, in Rev. Rec. 1348 of 1842, 56-59.\n3 Mr. Vibart, Rev. Com., 311 of 24th February 1842.\nM\u00e1him and Sanj\u00e1n, and also of Kolvan and Bhiwndi. The population of these five sub-divisions was estimated at 207,000, but the number was probably greater. The people were poor; but this, in Mr. Davidson's opinion, was not because Government took too much from them, but because their ignorance and superstition made them the victims of Br\u00e1hmans and moneylenders. There was plenty of waste land, but the people were too few to till it, and the ravages of small-pox kept their numbers from increasing. There were four chief modes of assessment hund\u00e1bandi, n\u00e1ngarbandi, mud\u00e1bandi or dhep, and bighoti. The principle of the hunda was a fixed payment either in money or in kind, or both in money and kind, according to the value of the land. The principle was just and simple, but was marred in practice by the ignorance of the size and character of the holdings. The local officers were the referees in all disputes, and there was little doubt that they defrauded Government and tyrannised over the villagers. The plough-cess, though well suited to the wilder tracts, was open to the objection that it favoured careless tillage. The mud\u00e1bandi or dhep system prevailed over a large area. The principle of this mode of assessment was fair, a plot of land equal to the production of a certain quantity of rice. But necessity and fraud had set aside the original principle of assessment. There were no records and no system either in the area of land entered as a muda, or in the quantity of grain that the muda contained. Government were nearly as unfit to do justice to themselves or their husbandmen as they were under the hund\u00e1bandi system. Mr. Davidson argued that all of these forms of assessment should be superseded by a bigha rate.\u00b9 The Collector agreed with Mr. Davidson that the existing practice was defective and confused; the chief obstacle to improvement lay in the difficulty of getting officers qualified to carry out a survey.\u00b2\n\nOf the produce, cost, and profit of the gardens, dry lands, liquor-yielding trees, and fisheries of Bassein, M\u00e1him, Sanj\u00e1n, Kolvan, and Bhiwndi, Mr. Davidson prepared the following estimates. In Bassein under garden lands 5338 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 8,09,297, with a tillage cost of Rs. 7,25,706, a rental of Rs. 29,915, and a profit of Rs. 53,676, of which Rs. 19,500 were from 300 bigh\u00e1s of cocoa-palms, Rs. 16,000 from 3200 bigh\u00e1s of sugarcane, and Rs. 12,300 from 1640 bigh\u00e1s of plantains. Under dry lands 20,177 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 2,82,116, with a tillage cost of Rs. 1,51,215, a rental of Rs. 80,565, and a profit of Rs. 50,336, of which Rs. 50,300 were from 20,120 bigh\u00e1s of early crops. Under liquor-yielding trees 25,000 palms and 147 date trees yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 1,25,257, with a cost of Rs. 62,610, a rental of Rs. 46,949, and a profit of Rs. 15,698.\u00b3 Fisheries yielded\n\n\u00b9 25th December 1845, Th\u00e1na Collector's File, General Condition, 1843-1853.\n\u00b2 Mr. Law, Collector, 8th April 1846, Th\u00e1na Collector's File, 1843-1853.\n\u00b3 As regards the assessment of cocoa and betel palms it appears that before 1837 palm plantations paid, besides a tree cess, a bigha tax of 8s. (Rs. 4). These had the effect of discouraging their growth, and in 1837 a consolidated bigha rate of from 2s. to 16s. (Re. 1-Rs. 5) was levied.

Under dry lands, 19,418 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 4,61,132, with a tillage cost of Rs. 2,25,788, a rental of Rs. 77,835, and a profit of Rs. 1,58,009, of which Rs. 1,57,763 were from 19,173 bigh\u00e1s of early crops. Under liquor-yielding trees, 17,000 palm and 18,300 date trees yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 70,281, with a cost of Rs. 19,204, a rental of Rs. 5894, and a profit of Rs. 45,688.

Under dry land, 38,036 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 4,52,091, with a tillage cost of Rs. 2,37,247, a rental of Rs. 87,092, and a profit of Rs. 1,57,752, of which Rs. 97,420 were from 24,355 bigh\u00e1s of early crops, Rs. 25,800 from 12,900 bigh\u00e1s of upland or varkas crops, and Rs. 4158 from 693 bigh\u00e1s of late crops. Under liquor-yielding trees, 13,791 palm and 138,249 date trees yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 1,99,194, with a cost of Rs. 19,729, a rental of Rs. 20,729, and a profit of Rs. 1,58,765. Fisheries yielded Rs. 30,432 and left a profit of Rs. 22,415, the charges amounting to Rs. 8017.\n\nIn Kolvan, now V\u00e1da and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, there were no garden crops. Under dry land 15,973 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 1,75,815, with a tillage cost of Rs. 86,598, a rental of Rs. 45,265, and a profit of Rs. 43,952, of which Rs. 39,920 were from 10,644 bigh\u00e1s of early, and 3972 from 5296 bigh\u00e1s of upland crops. Under liquor-yielding trees 1417 palm trees yielded a produce worth Rs. 1417, with a cost of Rs. 354, a rental of Rs. 465, and a profit of Rs. 598; and 7500 moha trees yielded a produce worth Rs. 6250, with a cost of Rs. 3750 and a profit of Rs. 2500.\n\nIn Bhiwndi, garden land measured only eleven bigh\u00e1s all under sugarcane. It yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 660, with a tillage cost of Rs. 570, a rental of Rs. 58, and a profit of Rs. 32. Under dry land, 32,182 bigh\u00e1s yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 5,00,367, with a tillage cost of Rs. 3,15,050, a rental of Rs. 1,10,239, and a profit of Rs. 75,078, of which Rs. 55,258 were from 26,000 bigh\u00e1s of early, Rs. 9773 from 3224 bigh\u00e1s of upland, and Rs. 9614 from 2814 bigh\u00e1s of late crops. Under liquor-yielding trees, 8711 palm trees yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 29,379, with a cost of Rs. 10,844, a rental of Rs. 2722, and a profit of Rs. 16,313. Moha trees yielded a gross produce worth Rs. 36,982 and left a profit of Rs. 2435, the charges amounting to Rs. 34,547. Fisheries yielded\nRs. 6110 and left a profit of Rs. 790, the charges amounting to Rs. 5320.\\(^1\\)\n\nBy the very liberal sacrifices of land revenue between 1835 and 1842 Government raised the mass of the landholders from labourers to be owners of valuable properties. Numbers of the people were unfit for their new position. Finding themselves with a large margin of profit they spent recklessly, out of proportion to their means. The prey was sighted from afar by the thrifty greedy V\u00e1nis of M\u00e1rw\u00e1r. They flocked to the district in crowds and settled in even its remotest villages. They tempted the people with the offer of money and took written bonds payable at a hundred per cent interest. If the borrower did not pay, the rate of interest was doubled, and, if he again failed, a decree of the civil court was passed against him and his lands and his house were sold. The M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris grew rich in a few years, made over their interest to young retainers, and carried their spoils to their own country. Numbers of the people of the district were turned out of their lands and their homes, and reduced to be the M\u00e1rw\u00e1ris\u2019 tenants or their labourers.\\(^2\\)\n\nIn 1844 an important change was made by abolishing most of the cesses that had hitherto been levied and introducing a salt-tax in their place. The chief taxes that were remitted were the license mohtarfa cess yielding \u00a31306 (Rs. 13,060), and a fisherman\u2019s cess yielding \u00a3325 (Rs. 33,250).\\(^3\\)\n\nIn 1846 a census was taken and showed a total population of 554,937. These returns were believed to be incomplete, and a second census taken five years later showed an increase of about 38,255.\\(^4\\)\n\nIn 1850 the Revenue Commissioner Mr. Shaw urged that Th\u00e1na and Kol\u00e1ba should be made separate districts. The unwieldy size of the present district, its nearness to Bombay, the large number of petitions, and the weight of the magisterial and current duties made it too heavy a charge to be well managed.\\(^5\\) According to the Collector Mr. Law, if the proposal to divide the Konkan into three districts was carried out, Th\u00e1na with eleven sub-divisions would have an area of about 4000 square miles, a population of nearly 525,000, and a revenue of about \u00a3150,000 (Rs. 15,00,000); Kol\u00e1ba with five sub-divisions would have an area of nearly 1500 square miles, a popu-\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Davidson, 25th December 1845, Th\u00e1na Collector\u2019s File, Reports on General Condition, 1843-1853.\n\n2 Mr. Law, Collector, 8th April 1846, Th\u00e1na Collector\u2019s File, Gen.

Government agreed that the change was desirable. The measure was delayed only until arrangements could be made for the introduction of a complete revenue survey. The first sixteen years of revised assessments (1837-1853), though none of them very prosperous, seem, except 1838-39, to have been fairly favourable. The returns point to a steady development, revenue collections rising, in spite of the large reductions in rates, from \u00a394,904 (Rs. 9,49,040) in 1837-38 to \u00a3105,146 (Rs. 10,51,460) in 1852-53, and outstandings falling from \u00a33185 (Rs. 31,850) to \u00a31204 (Rs. 12,040). The details are shown in the following statement:\n\n| Years | Rental | Remissions | Outstandings | Collections |\n|-------|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|\n| 1837-38 | 10,49,249 | 68,358 | 81,846 | 94,045 |\n| 1838-39 | 11,21,252 | 1,98,176 | 17,572 | 9,65,474 |\n| 1839-40 | 10,98,620 | 54,560 | 9374 | 10,35,690 |\n| 1840-41 | 11,21,209 | 39,986 | 4416 | 10,76,808 |\n| 1841-42 | 9,61,724 | 58,747 | 4418 | 9,88,669 |\n| 1842-43 | 9,90,049 | 14,686 | 3263 | 9,72,110 |\n| 1843-44 | 9,85,014 | 15,732 | 10,268 | 9,59,142 |\n| 1844-45 | 9,84,975 | 16,449 | 5837 | 9,62,688 |\n\nIn 1852 arrangements were at last completed for introducing the revenue survey into Thana, and under Captain, now General, Francis operations were begun in November of that year by the measurement of the lands of Nasirapur. The plan of the survey was to measure in detail every rice and cold-weather crop holding, and to measure the uplands, the grass, and the hill-grain lands as a whole, calculating their area by scale measurement from a map constructed from a circuit survey of the village. To measure the rice and cold-weather crop lands a double process was in most cases necessary. The land was first divided into section or survey numbers, and then the individual holdings which each survey number contained.\n\n---\n\n1 The Collector, 7th October 1850, Thana Collector's File, Statistics, 1836-1860.\n2 Mr. Compton, first assistant collector, 16th October 1851, Thana Collector's File, General Condition, 1843-1853.

Nasr\u00e1pur had an area of 237,824 acres or 371\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) square miles, 300 villages, and 62,761 inhabitants. It was bounded by the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds on the east, by S\u00e1nkshi now Pen in Kol\u00e9ba on the south, by a range of hills on the west, and by Kaly\u00e1n and Murb\u00e1d on the north.\n\nThe first block of villages in which survey measurements were introduced was the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s division of Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur, a tract bounded by the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00ed hills on the east, S\u00e1nkshi now Pen in Kol\u00e9ba on the south, Panvel on the west, and the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division of Nasr\u00e1pur on the north. It had an area of 84,182 acres or about 131\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) square miles, 123 villages of which 116 were Government and seven were alienated, and thirty-two hamlets of which twenty-nine were Government and three were alienated. The population was about 25,000 almost all of whom were husbandmen. The rainfall was from eighty to 100 inches and there was a considerable forest area. Of 12,685 arable acres 12,641 were under rice. A second crop, generally of v\u00e1l or gram and sometimes of tur and til, was not unfrequently grown. There was a large area (71,497) of uplands and hill lands, from which occasional crops of the coarser hill grains were raised, but which were generally fallow, given either to grass, or left for the growth of brushwood to be used as wood-ash manure.\n\nTill late in the eighteenth century the rice lands had remained unmeasured, the rental being fixed on a lump or dhep of land. In 1771-72 the rice lands were measured into bigh\u00e1s. A few years later (1788-89) they were remeasured by Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav and the lands divided into three classes, the first class paying a bigha rate of 10s. (Rs. 5), the second of 8s. (Rs. 4), and the third of 6s. (Rs. 3).\\(^2\\) Under the farming system that was soon after introduced, the difference of class was disregarded, and the Government demand raised to an uniform rate of 11s. (Rs. 5\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). These rates were continued under the British until the revision of rates by Mr. Davies in 1835-36. Under Mr. Davies\u2019 settlement the old measurements were accepted. Instead of the old first and second classes of land, a first class at 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)) was introduced and the old third class at 6s. (Rs. 3) was made a second class at 7s. (Rs. 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). These were the rates at which Kunbis were charged. The privilege of specially low rates previously enjoyed by high class or p\u00e1ndharpesh landholders was continued, and their rate fixed at 7s. (Rs. 3\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)). These rates were really lighter than they seemed, as strict survey measurements showed that the bigha, though nominally one of \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)th of an acre, really included \\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)th. There was very little cold-weather tillage, only forty-four acres, which when tilled would seem to have been assessed at a little over 2s. (Re. 1)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bom. Gov. Sel., XCVI. 3-4.\n\n\\(^2\\) See footnote 1 on p. 559.\nan acre. Mr. Davies' arrangement for upland tillage was, that when the ground was fallow no rent was charged, and that every holder of rice land was for each rice field allowed a customary share of upland, the grass and brushwood of which was burned for ash manure. When hill-grains or oilseed was grown the area was either roughly measured and charged at 2s. (Re. 1) a bigha, or a plough cess of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was levied. If hemp, tobacco, pepper, or other rich crops were grown, specially heavy rates had to be paid. In some of the wilder parts the tillage of patches of forest land was charged at the rate of 1s. 6d. (12 as.) on each sickle or koyta, and, under a special provision, the K\u00e1thkaris were allowed to till half a bigha of hill land free of charge. The effect of Mr. Davies' revision was a reduction in the Government demand from about \u00a34700 to \u00a33700 (Rs. 47,000 - Rs. 37,000) or about twenty per cent. This reduction was accompanied by the abolition of customs duties, which, according to Mr. Davies' calculations, had represented a further charge of from twenty-five to thirty per cent on the produce of a bigha. Further relief was soon after given by the remission of very heavy outstanding balances. The condition of the district was also improved by the making of roads.\n\nThe result of these changes was a rapid spread of tillage from about 7000 acres in 1835-36 to about 11,000 acres in 1845-46 with a corresponding rise in collections from about \u00a33150 to \u00a34550 (Rs. 31,500 - Rs. 45,500). The next eight years showed a steady but much slower progress to a tillage area of nearly 12,000 acres and a rental of about \u00a34700 (Rs. 47,000). In 1853-54 not more than 1000 acres of arable land were left waste. The chief rice market was Panvel, and besides the mail road to Bombay, roads had been opened to Panvel, to Pen in the south, and to Kaly\u00e1n in the north-west. The revenue was easily paid. In 1853-54 of \u00a34725 (Rs. 47,250) only \u00a317 (Rs. 170) or one-quarter per cent had to be remitted. The people were generally fairly off, and but for their besetting sin of drunkenness would have been very well-to-do. Under these circumstances the Survey superintendent was of opinion that no great reduction of assessment was required. For rice lands he proposed acre rates varying from 8s. 6d. to 4s. 3d. (Rs. 4\u00bd - Rs. 2\u00bd) and averaging 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd).\n\n---\n\n1 The details were, hemp Rs. 5, brinjals and tobacco Rs. 4-2, and pepper Rs. 1-9. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 8.\n2 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 5.\n3 The system of classification adopted in the case of rice lands was based on their division into the two main classes of early or halva and late or garva. Of the early there were two groups, the p\u0101npik or rain crop, coarse inferior kinds that ripen about the end of September, and the remaining kinds of halva that ripen in October. All the finer kinds of rice belong to the late or garva class which fetched from 4s. to 8s. (Rs. 2-Rs. 4) a khandi more than the early kinds. A calculation of the value of the different rice crops showed that if 16 annas were taken to represent the outturn of the late, or garva, kinds of rice, from 14 to 12 annas would be the proportionate value of the better, and from 9 to 10 annas of the inferior early crops. The rules for classifying the fields according to their soil and their supply of water, were based on the calculation of the value of the crop. Thus in the case of a halva field falling into the second water class, its rate would be 6 annas for water, and 7 or 8 annas for soil that is a total of 13 or 14 annas. Again p\u0101npik fields would probably be fourth class as regards water and third class as regards soil. This gives 10 annas for the best p\u0101npik fields. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 16-18.\ncrop land he proposed a maximum rate of 2s. 6d. (Re. 1\u00bd) and an average of about 2s. (Re. 1). Instead of the former system of making uplands pay only when they were cropped, Captain Francis proposed that a yearly charge should be levied whether they were tilled or not, and that, as each rice field had a plot of upland allotted to it, the charge for the upland should be combined with the charge for the rice field. He proposed to arrange the villages into four classes according to the proportion that upland bore to rice land. The proposed addition was in the first class from 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) to 9s. 9d. (Rs. 4-14) or about fourteen per cent, in the second class from 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) to 9s. 3d. (Rs. 4-10) or about nine per cent, and in the third class from 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4-4) to 8s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-7) or about four and a half per cent. In the fourth class there would be no increase on the rice rate of 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd) as there was little or no upland.\n\nIn four villages where the proportion of hill land to rice was specially large, he was of opinion that the plough rate, or n\u00e1ngarbandi, system should be continued. A plough tax should also, he thought, be levied on any upland taken for tillage by any one who did not hold rice land. As regards forest clearings he thought that the sickle cess and the special provision in favour of K\u00e1thkaris should be continued. There was no very large body of upper class or p\u00e1ndharpesh landholders, and the assessment of the land that they held on specially low rates was only \u00a3487 10s. (Rs. 4875). Captain Francis was of opinion that it would not be advisable entirely to do away with their privileges, and that it would be better to fix a maximum rate and remit the balance between that maximum and the actual assessment. This privilege should, he considered, be limited to the individuals holding land under the p\u00e1ndharpesha tenure and should cease on their death. The effect of these proposals was to lower the Government demand from \u00a35074 to \u00a34662 (Rs. 50,740-Rs. 46,620), a reduction of about 8\u00bd per cent.\n\nThe Collector in forwarding the Superintendent's report, approved of his classification and proposals for rice land, late-crop land, and forest patches. But the scheme for adding a charge for uplands to the payment of rice lands was, he thought, unsuitable. His chief objections were that many husbandmen held rice land without uplands and others held uplands without rice-lands, and that there were no means for ensuring that in the case of sales of land the rice and uplands would be sold together. Captain Francis in reply contended, that in very few if in any cases was rice land held without uplands, and that if a man held uplands without rice lands he would under the proposed scheme have to pay for it. It was the custom, he said, never to sell rice without its upland.\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Francis afterwards found that some of the rice lands should, on account of their specially good supply of water, have their rates raised. He accordingly altered the rates to 9s. (Rs. 4-8) for the first class, 8s. 9d. (Rs. 4-6) for the second class, and 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-5) for the third class. The addition for uplands was proportionately lowered and the whole demand remained the same. This change was approved by Government. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 9, 67-68.\n\n2 Mr. Seton Karr, 387 of 22nd February 1855, in Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 34.\n\n3 Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 37-43.\nthe Collector maintained the correctness of his former views, stating that cases of men holding rice land without upland were not uncommon, and that sales of rice land and of upland by themselves, though not usual, were not unknown. The Revenue Commissioner considered that the Superintendent's settlement might be introduced experimentally. He so far agreed with the Collector as to the unfairness of letting a man with a very small patch of rice land have rights over a large tract of upland, that he proposed that a minimum of rice land should be fixed beyond which the ownership of rice land would not carry the right to use uplands. The Superintendent was directed to watch and inquire into the custom of selling rice and uplands separately.\n\nThe proposed settlement was reviewed by Government in their letter 3370, 2nd September 1856. Though the sanction to its experimental introduction was confirmed, the proposals did not meet with the full approval of Government. As regards the reduction of nearly ten per cent, Government were not satisfied that in the prosperous state of the sub-division this was necessary. They did not approve Captain Francis' plan of including the charge on the uplands in the rice payments. They thought that it did not sufficiently provide for the inequalities in the amount of the upland held along with rice land and did not provide for the case of separate sales of rice land and upland. Government were of opinion that though the minute survey of upland holdings might on the score of expense be unadvisable, it was necessary that the area given to upland holdings should be marked off from the village grazing lands and from the Government forest and grass lands. Further, that though the upland holdings were not surveyed, that their boundaries should be marked and that a list of the fields should be made. This would be sufficiently checked by the scientific survey of the whole village area, and would give a fair representation of the different fields and of the unoccupied hill lands or waste. If this were done Government held that there would be little difficulty in assessing a fixed yearly rental on each of the holdings, to be paid whether the land was tilled or left fallow. This was to be done in future surveys, but Government granted their sanction to the experimental settlement of the mah\u00e1lkari's division of Nasr\u00e1pur.\n\nAs regards the claims of the p\u00e1ndharapesh\u00e1s to specially low taxation, Government were inclined to doubt whether it was advisable or possible to repeal their privileges.\n\nThe survey settlement was next introduced in the m\u00e1ml\u00e1t\u00e1d\u00e1r's portion of the Nasr\u00e1pur sub-division. It had an area of 153,642 acres or 240 square miles, 177 villages, and 37,761 inhabitants. It was bounded by the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds on the east, the mah\u00e1lkari's division of Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur on the south, a range of hills on the west, and Kaly\u00e1n and Murb\u00e1d on the north.

Eastwards the land was \nvery rugged, the woods deepened into forests, and the rice lands \nnarrowed into straggling patches. In the centre and west was \na thinly wooded plain crossed near the south by two of the western \nSahy\u00e1di spurs. The fall of rain though usually less than on the \ncoast was abundant, and a failure of crops was rare. Its two \nrivers, the Pej and the Ulh\u00e1s, were generally dry in the hot season \nand there was commonly a great want of drinking water. Of the \n177 villages, seven were held rent-free, six were held on special \nservice or iz\u00e1fat tenure, and the remaining 164, of which one was \nkhoti or held by a revenue farmer, were managed by Government.\u00b9 \nOf its 87,761 people, or 157 to the square mile, all were husbandmen; \nit was doubtful whether a single family was supported by manufac-\ntures. The Kunbi, or Mar\u00e1tha was the most numerous caste, and \nnext to them came the Br\u00e1hmans and Prabhus who were known as \np\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s.\n\nThree of the five petty divisions or tarafs had been measured \nby Trimbak Vin\u00e1yak and two by Sad\u00e1shiv Keshav. The returns \nwere nominally in bigh\u00e1s, but in Trimbak\u2019s measurements 1\u00bd \nbigha was recorded as a bigha, and in Sad\u00e1shiv\u2019s the bigha in-\nstead of three-fourths was nearly equal to a full acre. The high \nrates introduced by the revenue farmers were continued till Mr. \nDavies\u2019 revision in 1835-36. Mr. Davies adopted several rates \nin rice lands of which 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) was the highest and 8s. 6d. \n(Rs. 4\u00bc) the most general. In some villages he fixed the rates at \n7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd), and in a few under the Sahy\u00e1dis the rate was as low as \n5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd). The effect of the new rates was to lower the \nGovernment demand from \u00a36375 to \u00a35177 (Rs. 63,750 - Rs. 51,770), \na reduction of between eighteen and twenty per cent. The value \nof this relief was increased by the abolition of transit dues and the \nremission of outstanding balances. The result was an increase in \nthe tillage area from about 13,000 acres in 1836-37 to about 17,000 \nin 1846-47 and 19,000 in 1854-55, and a corresponding advance in \nrevenue from about \u00a34100 to \u00a36400 (Rs. 41,000 - Rs. 64,000). In \n1854-55 there were less than 2000 acres of arable waste, the revenue \nof \u00a36449 (Rs. 64,490) was recovered without difficulty and with only \n\u00a338 (Rs. 380) remissions, and the people, though not entirely out of \ndebt, were less dependent on the moneylender than in any part of \nthe Deccan of which Captain Francis had revised the assessment. \nPanvel and Kaly\u00e1n the two chief rice markets were easily reached \nalong good roads and the railway between Kaly\u00e1n and Poona would \nbe soon opened. Under these circumstances there seemed no reason \nfor lowering the assessment. Captain Francis proposed that the \nrice lands should be divided into six classes, paying rates varying \nfrom 9s. to 6s. (Rs. 4\u00bd - Rs. 3). Two hill-top villages were specially \nassessed at 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd). Late crop lands, of which there was an \narea of 1191 acres, were proposed for assessment at 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd). \nAs regards uplands he divided the villages into five classes,\n\n\u00b9 Two of the 164 villages had no land. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 75.\nand proposed that those who had uplands in the proportion of eight to ten acres to one of rice should pay 1s. (8 as.), those who had from five to six acres 9d. (6 as.), those who had three to four acres 6d. (4 as.), those who had from 1\u00bd to two acres 3d. (2 as.), and no charge should be made for those who had less than one acre. The highest rate for rice and upland combined was 10s. (Rs. 5). Twenty villages close to the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds with a very large area of upland should in his opinion be kept under the plough rate system. The result of the whole proposals was a reduction from \u00a36931 to \u00a36660 (Rs. 69,310 - Rs. 66,600) or about four per cent.\n\nThe p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s claimed the deduction of one-quarter of the area besides their specially low rates. To this deduction of area Captain Francis was satisfied they had no better claim than other landholders. As regards their specially easy rates he recommended that, as in the other division of the t\u00e1luka, the concession should be continued to the actual holders. The khot who held the village of Kh\u00e1ndas held under a deed of N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Ball\u00e1l Peshwa. The lands of this village were measured and assessed, and showed a rental of \u00a3149 (Rs. 1490), or more than \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) in excess of the khot\u2019s payment. The six special service or iz\u00e1fat villages were also measured and assessed. Except in one, where it was much less, the actual payments differed little from the survey rates.\n\nIn forwarding Captain Francis\u2019 report, the Collector Mr. Seton Karr approved of the proposals for rice and late-crop lands, but, as in the case of the other part of the sub-division, he objected to the system proposed for uplands. He thought that the privileges of the p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s should at once be stopped. The khots dealt most harshly with their tenants, and the tenure should in his opinion, if possible, be abolished. He thought that the special service, or iz\u00e1fat, villages might be leased to the holders at the survey rental and that they should not be allowed to rack-rent their tenants-at-will. Captain Francis\u2019 proposals were sanctioned as a temporary measure in April 1857.\n\nThe survey of Panvel was begun in 1853-54 and finished in 1854-55. Under the Revenue Commissioner\u2019s sanction the new settlement was provisionally introduced in 1856-57. The sub-division was bounded on the west by the sea, on the south for ten miles by the \u00c1vra creek, then along a chain of hills that separated Panvel from Pen till it met Nasr\u00e1pur, whence branching to the north it stretched to Prabal hill and skirting M\u00e1ther\u00e1n extended nearly to Malanggad hill. From Malanggad there was no well marked boundary to the Taloja creek which formed its north-west limit on to the coast. It had an abundant and regular rainfall of over 100 inches, and had great natural advantages being intersected by two tidal rivers and many tidal creeks, and having the important market of Bombay close at hand. It contained a superficial area of 207 square miles with 229 villages, of which thirty-six were alienated, seven were service, and 186 were Government. Of the Government\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Letter 1700, 9th April 1857. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 97.\nvillages some were only reclaimed salt wastes with no village sites. Of the whole number 143 belonged to the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's and forty-three to the mah\u00e1lkari's charge. Of 111,949 acres the whole surveyed area, 19,141 were sweet rice land, 10,358 salt rice, 2086 late crops and garden, and 80,364 uplands and hill lands. There were upwards of 50,000 people, about a third of them \u00c1gri Kunbis, about 8200 Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Kunbis, 2600 Musalm\u00e1ns, and 2250 Br\u00e1hmans and Pr\u00e1bhus. Of the two parts of the sub-division the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's share had been under British management since the cession of the Konkan by the Peshwa, and the mah\u00e1lkari's was part of the Kol\u00e1ba state that lapsed in 1840. In the mah\u00e1lkari's villages no change had been made since their transfer to the British. In the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's villages the high rates which were continued for several years after the beginning of British rule were revised by Mr. Davies in 1836-37, who lowered the Government demand from \u00a39918 to \u00a37428 (Rs. 99,180 - Rs. 74,280), a reduction of about 25 per cent. Mr. Davies found the people very impoverished and in some of the Auroli villages introduced a low uniform rice rate of 6s. (Rs. 3). The effect of these reductions was the gradual rise of tillage from about 19,000 acres in 1836-37 to about 24,000 acres in 1855-56, or within about 1000 acres of the whole arable area. The revenue during the same time rose from about \u00a37400 to \u00a38200 (Rs. 74,000 - Rs. 82,000). The effect on the people had been a complete change from a state of abject poverty to contentment, and, in some cases, to wealth. The people were generally thriving, the command of the Bombay market enabling them to realize a good profit for their straw and grass as well as for their rice. The \u00c1gris, the bulk of the husbandmen, though careful in money dealings, indulged so freely in spirits, that in many villages scarcely a sober man could be found after eight o'clock at night.\n\nThe position of Panvel, on the sea coast with many of its villages intersected by salt water creeks, introduced a new element in the system of settling the survey rates. The rice lands belonged to two main classes, sweet and salt. The conditions influencing the sweet rice lands were the same as in Nasr\u00e1pur and the same system of classification was followed. In the salt rice lands the conditions were very different. There was no burning of brushwood, no sowing in seed beds and no planting; the seed was soaked till it sprouted, and was then sown broadcast and trodden into the ground. The salt rice lands varied greatly in character, from barren lands subject to partial overflow at spring tides, to lands long reclaimed and yearly washed with fresh water, whose yield was little less than the yield in sweet rice lands. As regards soil they were arranged under two orders, reddish soils found at a distance from the sea and fairly free from salt, and black soils, a larger class, varying in fruitfulness according to the amount of salt they held. In a rupee, that is in sixteen parts, eight were allotted to soil and eight to water. To meet the difference in soil due to the quantity of salt, a table of faults was applied ranging from eight ann\u00e1s to three. In applying a water rate, as was the case with the sweet rice lands, which according to their crop were grouped into halva or early and garva or late, the salt rice lands were...\nformed into two classes according as they yielded the more valuable choka or white, or the poorer rata or red. These were found to correspond very closely with the sweet rice classes and the scale required little adjustment. As regards the sweet rice lands Captain Francis proposed to divide them into six classes, twenty-eight villages paying 10s. 6d. (Rs. 5\u00bd), fifty-eight paying 10s. (Rs. 5), thirty paying 9s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd), twenty-six paying 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd), twenty-one paying 8s. 6d. (Rs. 4\u00bd), and thirteen paying 8s. (Rs. 4). Six specially rich and well placed villages were charged 12s. (Rs. 6).\n\nA few reclamations or khars being well washed with fresh water, yielded a sweet late crop and could be charged sweet rice rates. With this exception the salt rice lands belonged to two classes those near the sea and those safe from flooding. The best lands were rated at 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd), and the more exposed lands at 8s. 6d. to 8s. (Rs. 4\u00bd-Rs. 4). In the case of the latter the specially low rates for the red or rata rice came in and lowered the charge to 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd), and in a few spots to 2s. (Re. 1). The result of these rates was a total rental of \u00a38650 (Rs. 86,500) or an increase of about 3\u00bd per cent. In the mahalkari's petty division where unrevised grain rates were in force, the area under tillage had risen from about 4000 acres in 1840 to 6000 in 1855-56, leaving almost no arable land untilled. Under the system of grain commutation payments, large remissions averaging about \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000) a year were granted and the collections varied greatly from year to year. They fell from about \u00a32400 (Rs. 24,000) in 1840 to a little over \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000) in 1848 and then rose irregularly to \u00a32400 (Rs. 24,000) in 1853-54. Very high commutation rates in the year before the survey had forced them up to \u00a32732 (Rs. 27,320). Compared with that year the proposed rates in the petty division showed a fall from \u00a32732 to \u00a32216 (Rs. 27,320-Rs. 22,160) or a reduction of about 19 per cent. But on the average of ten years the fall was \u00a37 (Rs. 70) only. Taking the figures of the sub-division and the petty division together, the proposed rates showed a total of \u00a310,866 (Rs. 1,08,660), or an increase of \u00a3624 (Rs. 6240) on the average collections in the ten previous years.\n\nLate crop and garden lands were of little importance. Gram tur and til were the crops, and the total rental, if all the waste was taken for tillage, would not come to more than \u00a3263 (Rs. 2630). The rates proposed were 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd), except in Panvel where, as both the soil and the market were specially good, a rate of 3s. 6d. (Re. 1\u00bd) was proposed. In the hot weather, with the help of lever lifts or budkis, a small strip on stream banks grew onions, vegetables, and a little sugarcane. The proposed rate was 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and the probable revenue \u00a328 (Rs. 280).\n\nAs regards uplands a new system was introduced in accordance with Government orders. Uplands were of two classes, those held in connection with rice tillage and those which remained with Government. The land was measured by taking points fixed at the time of measuring the rice lands or the survey of the village circuit and joining them together, the new lines being marked by boundary stones. The area was then calculated from its outline on the map. In some cases where there was a specially large area of upland,\nmeasurement by the chain and cross-staff was necessary. But as a rule it was found enough to take the map as the basis for dividing the land into numbers. About 26,000 acres were measured in this way at an average cost of 1\u00bdd. (11 pies) an acre. Captain Francis proposed an acre rate of 6d. (4 as.) on the coast and 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) on the inland uplands. This would give from the allotted land, that is the land held along with rice fields, a revenue of \u00a3289 (Rs. 2890) and from the other lands a revenue of \u00a3153 (Rs. 1530) or a total of \u00a3442 (Rs. 4420), a sum \u00a3170 (Rs. 1700) in excess of the average revenue from uplands during the ten previous years. A further sum of \u00a340 (Rs. 400) was due from forest or doli tillage.\n\nThere were no p\u00e1ndharpesh\u00e1s enjoying the favour of specially easy rates. The seven special service or iz\u00e1fat villages were surveyed and assessed. In all cases the survey rental was higher than that formerly paid. But it was proposed, as in Nasr\u00e1pur, to offer the villages to the iz\u00e1fatd\u00e1rs on a thirty years' lease on condition of their paying the survey rental. The question of the tenure of the embanked or reclaimed lands was one of importance. These reclaimed lands were held in two ways: either there was one owner, called shilotrid\u00e1r, who represented the original reclamer, or the land was held by a body of men called kul\u00e1rag. In the first instance the owner was responsible for the repair of the dams and levied a special man of grain to meet the cost. The owners were said to be very exacting. Where the reclamation was held by a body of husbandmen no special man of grain was levied for repairs. The holders paid direct to Government and arranged among themselves for the repair of the dams. In Government reclamations the man was levied and Government was responsible for the repairs. Captain Francis thought that in the case of reclamations held by a private person or by a body of men the present plan should continue. In Government reclamations instead of the man of rice an acre fee of 1s. (8 as.) should be levied and the amount set apart as a fund to meet any expenses required for repairs. The repairs would be carried out by the villagers and the payment made by the assistant collectors. As regards the question of the grant of leases to reclaim salt wastes, Captain Francis was of opinion that the term of the lease should vary from fifteen to twenty years.\n\nMr. Jones the Collector, though he thought some of the rates rather high, approved of Captain Francis' proposal. The proposals were also approved by the Revenue Commissioner and were sanctioned by Government on the 5th of April 1859.\n\nThe next part of the district settled was Kaly\u00e1n. At the time of settlement (1859) Kaly\u00e1n was bounded on the north by the Kaly\u00e1n creek and its tributary the Bh\u00e1tsa river, on the east by Murb\u00e1d, on the south by Nasr\u00e1pur, and on the west by the Malanggad hills. The area was about 215 square miles, the length from north to\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Jones, 23 of 5th January 1857, in Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 122-126.\n2 Gov. Letter 1127 of 1859. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 134-138.\n3 These 215 square miles or 137,729 acres contained 19,906 acres of rice land, 1755 of late crop land, 180 of garden land, 54,715 of uplands, 48,124 of unarable and hill land, and about 13,049 acres occupied by alienated villages. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 269.\nsouth varying from eighteen to twenty-three miles, and the breadth from east to west from six to thirteen. The people numbered 35,000 or 160 to the square mile. Of 165 villages, 147 were Government, three were held on iz\u00e1fat or special service tenure, and two were partially and thirteen entirely alienated. Of these only the thirteen entirely alienated villages were excluded from the survey settlement. Of the Ulh\u00e1s, K\u00e1l\u00fa, and Bh\u00e1tsa rivers that crossed the sub-division and fell into the Kaly\u00e1n creek, the Ulh\u00e1s and K\u00e1l\u00fa were navigable for only a short distance from their meeting with the main creek. Boats of small tonnage could pass up the Bh\u00e1tsa as far as V\u00e1sundri about ten miles above Kaly\u00e1n. As Kaly\u00e1n was partly a coast and partly an inland tract, some of its villages had a navigable river for the transport of their produce, while a few were rather far from market and difficult of access by carts. On the whole its means of communication were good. Besides its river and the made road from Kaly\u00e1n to Chauk, Kaly\u00e1n was crossed in two directions by the Peninsula railway, by the K\u00e4mpoli (Khopoli) branch to the south and the V\u00e1sind branch to the north. Except Kaly\u00e1n the railway stations were little used. A small quantity of rice was shipped for Bombay from V\u00e1sundri and one or two villages on the Bh\u00e1tsa; with this exception the whole rice produce was brought to Kaly\u00e1n for export to Bombay. There were several warehouses in the town where the rice was cleaned before it was shipped. Kaly\u00e1n was a fairly large town with above 7000 people.\n\nDuring the ten years ending 1841-42, remissions were large and collections irregular. The two years 1834-35 and 1835-36 showed the greatest fluctuations. In 1834-35 the remissions were about \u00a3335 (Rs. 3350) and the collections \u00a37136 (Rs. 71,360), which was the largest amount realised during the ten years. In the succeeding year (1835-36) the remissions amounted to \u00a32240 (Rs. 22,400) and the revenue to \u00a35307 (Rs. 53,070). For the latter half of this period of ten years (1837-1842) the revenue averaged about \u00a35900 (Rs. 59,000). During the whole period of these ten years (1832-1842) the largest remissions \u00a32240 (Rs. 22,400) were granted in 1835-36, and the smallest revenue, about \u00a35300 (Rs. 53,000), was collected in 1832-33 and 1835-36. In 1842-43 Mr. Giberne's reduced assessment, which had been introduced in 1837-38, was finally sanctioned by Government, and from that date during the sixteen years ending 1857-58 remissions were small, and collections rose steadily from about \u00a37200 (Rs. 72,000) in 1842-43 to about \u00a37800 (Rs. 78,000) in 1857-58. During the twenty-six years ending 1857-58 collections averaged \u00a37000 (Rs. 70,000) and during the ten years ending 1857-58 \u00a37700 (Rs. 77,000), while during the five years before Mr. Giberne's assessment the average was estimated at \u00a35900 (Rs. 59,000).\n\n---\n\n1 Under the Peshw\u00e1s, Kaly\u00e1n formed one of the pr\u00e1n\u00e1s or districts of the Konkan. Besides the present sub-division of Kaly\u00e1n it included Murb\u00e1d, Tal\u00f3ja, and Bhiwndi, and part of Nasr\u00e1pur. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 267.\n\n2 Mr. Giberne's assessment was introduced in 1837-38, but, until it was sanctioned by Government in 1842-43, the reduction was shown as remission. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 275.\nMr. Giberne's assessment had placed the sub-division on a fair footing. It was followed by an immediate increase of revenue, and for the last ten years collections had been subject to very little fluctuation. At the same time the cultivators had recovered from great poverty, and in 1859 were fairly off.\n\nThe survey was begun in 1854-55 and finished in 1858-59. The new rates were based chiefly on the standard of assessment adopted in the neighbouring sub-division of Nasr\u00e1pur. The highest rates varied according to nearness to market from 12s. to 9s. (Rs. 6 - Rs. 4\u00bd) for ordinary rice lands, with an addition of from 3s. to 4s. (Rs. 1\u00bd-Rs. 2) for certain rice lands within the limits of the Kaly\u00e1n township, which yielded a second crop of vegetables. Including the Kaly\u00e1n town, thirteen villages within a radius of three miles from Kaly\u00e1n were placed in the first class and charged a highest rice acre rate of 12s. (Rs. 6). The second class consisted of forty-five villages and were charged a rate of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd). These villages lay close to the former group and stretched to a short distance beyond the stations of Badl\u00e1pur on the south and Titv\u00e1la on the north. A lower rate was fixed chiefly because these villages were generally about half a day's journey from Kaly\u00e1n, and had to undergo some small expense in bringing their produce to market. This expense was assumed to be covered by a reduction of 1s. (8 as.). In the third class were placed ninety-one villages with a highest acre rate of 10s. (Rs. 5). The three remaining villages in a forest tract on the outskirts of Murb\u00e1d were charged a lower rate of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) on account of their distance from market and because of their somewhat unhealthy climate.\n\nIn a considerable area of land belonging to the town of Kaly\u00e1n an early crop of rice was followed by a cold weather crop of onions, vegetables, and other garden produce raised by irrigation from ponds and wells. The land cultivated in this way, being essentially rice land, was classed as rice land and an extra water rate was imposed of 4s. (Rs. 2) where water was obtained from reservoirs by channels or 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd) where it was drawn from wells. There was another small tract of land chiefly in the town of Kaly\u00e1n where nothing but garden crops were grown; the rate fixed for this land was 6s. (Rs. 3).\n\nFor cold weather crop lands, which measured only 1775 acres, a maximum rate of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was fixed.\n\nAll the arable uplands, and the steeper hill slopes whose grass and brushwood were taken for wood-ash manure, were divided into numbers and charged a highest acre rate of 6d. (4 as.).\n\n---\n\n1 'As regards climate, there is no appreciable difference in the two sub-divisions of Nasr\u00e1pur and Kaly\u00e1n, the fall of rain being pretty much the same in both. They are very similar in respect to fertility. There is in fact in the case of Kaly\u00e1n the one circumstance of proximity to market to be taken into consideration in determining the amount of increase to be made to the Nasr\u00e1pur rate, and that being estimated at 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd), 12s. (Rs. 6) will be the maximum rate for Kaly\u00e1n rice land.' Captain Francis, 11th March 1859, Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 270-271.\n\n2 The special water rate which had been levied before the survey revision was 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd). As the value of garden produce had increased nearly fifty per cent since the opening of the railway, the rate was raised to 4s. (Rs. 2). Bom. Gov., Sel. XCVI, 272.\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n**Kaly\u00e1n Settlement, 1858-59.**\n\n| LAND | FORMER Collections in 1857-58 | SURVEY ASSESSMENT Tillage in 1857-58 | Waste | Total |\n|------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Rice | Rs. 71,362                    | Rs. 70,768                          | Rs. 4,675 | Rs. 75,888 |\n| Late crop | Rs. 1,841                  | Rs. 1,504                           | Rs. 340 | Rs. 2,144 |\n| Garden | Rs. 391                      |                                     | Rs. 165 | Rs. 556 |\n| Upland | Rs. 4718                     | Rs. 7,783                           | Rs. 3,928 | Rs. 11,711 |\n| Total | Rs. 77,951                    | Rs. 80,241                          | Rs. 9,808 | Rs. 90,049 |\n\nThe result of the new settlement was an increase of about three per cent in revenue. A further increase of \u00a31000 to \u00a31200 (Rs. 10,000 - Rs. 12,000) was expected as the arable waste came under tillage.\n\nThe survey settlement was in the same year (1859) introduced into Taloja, which was the smallest sub-division in the Th\u00e1na district with a total area of only 169 square miles. It was bounded by the Kaly\u00e1n tidal river on the north, by the Chanderi and Malanggad hills on the east, by Panvel on the south-east, by the Taloja creek on the south, and by the Th\u00e1na river on the west. The general surface was flat, with a gentle rise from the Panvel creek on the south and the Kaly\u00e1n creek on the north to a raised belt of land that running east and west formed the water-parting between the two rivers. Of 150 villages, 148 were Government, one was alienated, and one was a shar\u0101kati or share village paying Government half of its assessed rental.\n\nThough bounded on three sides by tidal creeks Taloja did not enjoy convenient water carriage. The boat stations on the Th\u00e1na creek were available only for the villages in the narrow belt between the creek and the Persik hills, for the hills being too high and rugged for carts or bullocks, shut out the inland villages from the advantage of water communication. Along the Kaly\u00e1n creek there was scarcely a spot where boats could be anchored. Taloja was the only port convenient for any considerable number of villages. In respect of land communications the subdivision was also rather unfavourably placed. Though the railway passed through the southern part of the sub-division, there was no station within its limits and the only made road was the small piece from Th\u00e1na creek to Persik point. At the same time the surface of the sub-division was generally flat; and during the fine weather there were many rough cart tracks which served for the transport of produce. Rice was the staple product and Kaly\u00e1n and Panvel were\n\n---\n\n1 Taloja originally formed part of the Peshwa's district or prant of Kaly\u00e1n. It was afterwards put under Panvel, and, in 1849, at the general re-distribution of sub-divisions, was formed into a separate sub-division. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 278.\n\n2 Of the 169 square miles or 108,386 acres, 30,392 were rice land, 3984 late crop land, 11 garden, 33,181 upland, and 40,039 unarable and hill land. 779 acres were included in one alienated village. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 278-279.\nthe markets to which the bulk of the rice was taken. A small quantity was sent from Taloja direct to Bombay, and the Khairna belt of villages, lying between the Th\u00e1na creek and the Persik hills, exported the greater part of their produce direct to that market.\n\nIn 1835-36 the assessment rates were reduced by Mr. Davies by about \u00a31800 (Rs. 18,000) or nearly twenty-five per cent. Before Mr. Davies' revision the rental had been taken in commuted grain rates. In their place he introduced in many of the best villages an uniform bigha rate of 6s. (Rs. 3). During the three years ending 1834-35 the average collections amounted to \u00a37684 (Rs. 76,840), the largest sum realized being about \u00a38400 (Rs. 84,000) in 1833-34. During these years remissions averaged \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), the largest sum remitted being about \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) in 1832-33. In the twenty years (1838-39 to 1857-58) after the introduction of Mr. Davies' rates, the remissions averaged about \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). During the ten years ending 1847-48 the yearly collections averaged only about \u00a37110 (Rs. 71,100) or about \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) less than before the revision. For the next five years there was little increase. But in 1852-53 the revenue reached its former standard and continued to rise, till in 1857-58 it stood as high as \u00a38200 (Rs. 82,000). The spread of tillage was from about 24,000 acres in 1832-33 to about 29,000 acres in 1857-58.\n\nThe survey was begun in 1854-55 and finished in 1858-59. The rates were fixed on the same scale as in Kaly\u00e1n, except that there was an additional acre rate for salt-rice lands. The first group, extending from Kalva the village next the Th\u00e1na ferry to Tehtavli about five miles distant, included twelve villages of the Khairna belt, and was charged a highest rice acre rate of 12s. (Rs. 6). The remaining villages of the Khairna belt, those along the course of the Taloja creek as far as the town of Taloja, and a group on the north-east corner a few miles from Kaly\u00e1n, formed the second group of thirty-three villages for which a rate of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) was fixed. For the rest of the sub-division, except seven villages, a rate of 10s. (Rs. 5) was fixed. The seven excepted villages lay under the Chanderi range of hills, in a valley far from markets and with an unhealthy climate. For these a rate of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) was fixed. There was a small extent of salt-rice land in some of the villages near the different creeks. But these salt-rice lands, or kh\u00e1rs, were not generally good. They were in many cases exposed to the south-west monsoon, particularly those along the borders of the Th\u00e1na creek where the chief part of the salt rice cultivation lay. These lands were not so good as the corresponding lands in Panvel, and a highest rate of only 8s. (Rs. 4) was fixed.\n\nOf land under garden cultivation there was a very small extent of eleven acres for which a rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) was fixed. The rate fixed for late-crop or rabi land was 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd). A good deal of the land classed and assessed as late-crop seemed capable of being brought under rice cultivation at a small outlay. In its existing state it was fitted only for the cultivation of cold-weather crops.\n\nIn this sub-division uplands were more than ordinarily valuable, on account of the ease and cheapness with which grass could be carried\nto Bombay along the Taloja and Th\u00e1na creeks. A considerable quantity was yearly sent to that market. But as the produce of great part of the uplands was always used for ash manure, the usual rate of four annas was fixed. From the operation of this rate the grass lands of the Khairna belt were excepted and reserved for annual auction sale.\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n| Taloja Settlement, 1858-59. |\n|-----------------------------|\n| **LAND** | **FORMER.** | **SURVEY ASSESSMENT.** |\n|           | Collections in 1857-58. | Tillage in 1857-58. | Waste. | Total. |\n| Blue      | Rs. 78,962 | Rs. 95,181 | Rs. 6,007 | Rs. 101,133 |\n| Late crop | 4065       | 3598       | 1412     | 8350     |\n| Garden    |            | 28         | 9        | 37       |\n| Upland    | 1598       | 2720       | 4021     | 7741     |\n| **Total** | 82,085     | 102,897    | 11,449   | 114,346  |\n\nThe statement shows that the increase in revenue in consequence of the survey rates amounted to twenty-five per cent on the land (1858) under tillage; and that a rise of fifteen per cent more would take place when all available land was brought under tillage.\n\nThe next sub-division to which the survey was extended was Murb\u00e1d, where measurements were begun in 1856-57 and the settlement completed in 1859-60. Murb\u00e1d was bounded on the north by Kolvan, on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, on the south by Nasr\u00e1pur, and on the west by Kaly\u00e1n. As regards distance from markets climate and general productiveness, there was little difference between Murb\u00e1d and Nasr\u00e1pur. Except perhaps some villages in Kolvan no part of Th\u00e1na was worse off for markets. There was not a mile of made road and much of the country was too rough for carts. Almost all its rice was carried to Kaly\u00e1n, carts were used for seven or eight miles beyond the town of Murb\u00e1d, but the road was very rough and roundabout. Another cart track in the north passed to V\u00e1sind, but by far the most of the rice crop went to market on pack bullocks.\n\nAlmost the whole population was engaged in husbandry. Unlike the people of the coast who added to their means by fishing salt-making and labour, the Murb\u00e1d people were entirely dependent on their fields. Though this was in some ways an evil it would seem to have had the good effect of improving the style of tillage. The land was unusually well cultivated and the people were fairly off.\n\nThe reduction of rates in 1837-38 had been followed by a most marked improvement. During the fifteen years ending 1858-59 the revenue of the mah\u00e1lkari's division was steadily increasing.\n\n---\n\n1 Rates were reduced in the best parts of the district from 11s. to 8s. 6d., 8s., and 7s. 6d. (Rs. 5\u00bd to Rs. 4\u00bd, Rs. 4, and Rs. 3\u00bd). In the poorer parts they were reduced to 6s., 5s., 4s., and 3s. (Rs. 3, Rs. 2\u00bd, Rs. 2, and Re. 1\u00bd) the bigha. Bom. Gov., Sel. LXII, 10.\nwhile remissions had almost entirely disappeared. In 1860 the people were generally well off and a yearly increasing revenue was paid with ease. There seemed to be no call for a reduction in rates.\n\nOf 252 villages, 155 constituted the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s and 97 the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s charge. Of these four were alienated and five were held on special service or iz\u00e1fat tenure. The 248 villages, 243 Government and five iz\u00e1fat, into which the survey settlement was introduced, were arranged in five classes with highest acre rates varying from 9s. to 4s. (Rs. 4\u00bd - Rs. 2). The first class including sixty-seven villages was charged a highest acre rate of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd). Most of these villages were on the western side of the sub-division adjoining Kaly\u00e1n, the line being drawn to include those a few miles beyond the town of Murb\u00e1d, and then taken across to the northern side to include those bordering on V\u00e1sind. All the villages in this class had a cart road to Kaly\u00e1n or to the V\u00e1sind railway station. The second class including 115 villages was charged a highest acre rate of 8s. (Rs. 4). This group, which was generally further from market and mostly inaccessible to carts, was made up of a string of villages immediately east of the first class together with a few of the wilder villages on the Kaly\u00e1n border. Fifteen villages, for the most part east of the second group and generally further from market, were placed in the third class and charged a highest acre rate of 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd). The fourth class consisted of fifteen villages and was charged a highest acre rate of 6s. (Rs. 3). Some of them were close to the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, and others in the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s charge, though at some distance from the hills, were difficult of access. The fifth class consisted of thirty-five of the wildest villages divided into two groups, one of twenty-one charged at a rate of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and the other of fourteen charged at a rate of 4s. (Rs. 2).\u00b9 The lowest rate of 4s. (Rs. 2) was made specially to suit a few villages in the north-east, bordering on Kolvan. They were very out of the way, being in the rough country near the Sahy\u00e1dris, the people were almost all Kolis, and they had lately suffered severely in some of the plundering expeditions of the Koli outlaw R\u00e1ghoji N\u00e1ik.\n\nThere was no garden cultivation. The area of cold-weather tillage was very small and in 1859 yielded a revenue of only \u00a31 18s. (Rs. 19). The existing rate of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was continued. The uplands were valuable for cultivation only. The grass had no local value and the coast markets were too far off to admit of its profitable transport. It was used entirely for ash manure. For grass uplands an acre rate of three annas was fixed. In some few villages the uplands were particularly well suited for the growth of hill grains, and a few villages on the borders of Kaly\u00e1n might find a market for their grass in that sub-division. For these two classes of villages an acre rate of four annas was fixed.\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n\u00b9 One village, Gorakgad, was omitted because it had no rice land. Bom. Gov. Sel. LXII. 7.\nAt the time of settlement (1860) the Bhiwndi sub-division had a length from north to south of twelve to twenty-two miles and a greatest breadth of nineteen miles. In shape it was an irregular triangle with the apex on the Kaly\u00e1n river in the south. It was bounded by Bassein on the west, by Kolvan on the north, and by Kaly\u00e1n and Taloja on the east and south. The total area was 258 square miles or 164,954 acres. Of 205, the total number of villages, ninety-nine formed the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s charge and 106 the mah\u00e1lkari\u2019s. Of the 205 villages, 199 were settled, of which 189 were Government, five service, and five share villages; the six villages into which the survey was not introduced were alienated. Most of the sub-division, especially the villages lying between the town of Bhiwndi and the great tidal creeks to the south and east, suffered from a scanty supply of drinking water during the latter part of the hot weather.\n\nCommunications were good. The town of Bhiwndi was a fair local market and Bombay was within easy distance by water. Other parts of the sub-division were helped by the railway and by the Bombay-\u00c1gra road. The villages in the north-east, near the Mahuli hills, were wild, thinly peopled, generally inaccessible to carts, and at a long distance from markets. In the remaining villages the bulk of the husbandmen were (1860) well off and some near Bhiwndi were rich.\n\nMr. Giberne revised the assessment rates in 1840-41, and the reductions he proposed, which amounted to about \u00a31311 (Rs. 13,110), were sanctioned by Government in 1842. In the following year (1842-43) when the reductions were permanently sanctioned, the remissions were reduced to a little above \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000). A perceptible decrease of tillage took place in 1843-44 and the revenue in that year amounted only to about \u00a39380 (Rs. 93,800). From that time it steadily rose till it reached \u00a311,786 (Rs. 1,17,860) in 1859-60 when remissions were only a little above \u00a390 (Rs. 900). The spread of tillage in the four or five years before the survey settlement (1854-1859) was chiefly due to the high price of grain,\n\n---\n\n1 The price of rice in the Bhiwndi market varied in 1840-41 from \u00a32 16s. to \u00a33 4s. (Rs. 28-Rs. 32) the mud\u00e1, while in 1859-60 it ranged from \u00a35 4s. to \u00a35 14s. (Rs. 52-Rs. 57). The very high price in 1860 was chiefly owing to the local failure of crops in 1859-60. But the average of the five years ending 1859-60 shows an increase of about 60 per cent over the average of the five years ending 1844-45, the figures of the first average being \u00a33 17s. (Rs. 38\u00bd) for coarse and \u00a34 4s. (Rs. 42) for fine rice, and those\nwhich, in the five years ending 1859-60, averaged about sixty per cent over the prices in the five years ending 1844-45.\n\nThe 199 surveyed villages were arranged under seven classes with highest rice rates varying from 12s. to 6s. (Rs. 6-Rs. 3). The first class consisted of Bhiwandi and the five neighbouring villages, which could avail themselves of the Bhiwandi market without any expense of carriage. The rate fixed for them was 12s. (Rs. 6). In the second class were seventeen villages occupying the tract between the creeks on the south and east, the lands of villages near Bhiwandi not included in the first class, and lands of villages on or adjoining the N\u00e1sik road and not above five or six miles from the town of Bhiwandi. The rate fixed for this group was 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd). The third class consisted of seventy-four villages, including the villages near the N\u00e1sik road and stretching to the eastern boundary of the sub-division near V\u00e1sind and a group of villages, about four or five miles from the road, in the central part of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's division of Bhiwandi. The rate fixed for this third class was 10s. (Rs. 5). The rates fixed for kh\u00e1r\u00e1p\u00e1t or salt-rice land, of which there was a small area, were 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and 8s. (Rs. 4), the second rate being applied to villages near the salt creeks or in places exposed to the influence of the tide. The main considerations on which the rates for the remaining four classes were fixed, were distance from Bhiwandi and difficulty of access to that market, a belt of country about five miles broad being assigned to each group of villages. The rates fixed for these four classes were 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) for thirty-five villages, 8s. (Rs. 4) for thirty-nine villages, 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) for nineteen villages, and 6s. (Rs. 3) for nine villages. The last nine villages were those in the north-east near M\u00e1luli.\n\nThe late crop or rabi area was small. The rate fixed was 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd). Garden tillage was almost confined to m\u00e1lva b\u00e1g\u00e1yat a term applied to the cultivation by irrigation from rivers, wells, and ponds, during the fair season. No change was made in the existing highest rate of 6s. (Rs. 3) for this cultivation. Vegetables, v\u00e1l, and other\n\nof the second average \u00a32 4s. (Rs. 22) and \u00a32 12s. (Rs. 26). Bom. Gov.

Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI, 324.\npulses were also grown as second crops in rice lands by well irrigation in a few villages near Bhiwandi. The lands in such cases were classed as rice in the first instance, and then, as in Kaly\u00e1n, an extra water-rate was imposed on account of the second crop. The highest acre rate in such cases was 12s. (Rs. 6) besides 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) of water rate, or 15s. (Rs. 7\u00bd) in all.\n\nThe uplands were not more valuable than in Kaly\u00e1n and Taloja. The highest acre rates fixed were four annas and three annas, the latter being applied to the distant and wild villages whose rice rates were fixed at 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) and 6s. (Rs. 3).\n\nExclusive of arable waste the survey settlement, compared with the collections of the ten previous years, showed an increase of \u00a31348 (Rs.13,480); compared with the collections of 1859-60 the increase was \u00a3961 (Rs. 9610).\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n**Bhiwandi Settlement, 1860-61.**\n\n| Divisions | Former | Survey |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n|           | 1859-60 |        |\n|           | Rice   | Rabi and Garden | Up-land | Total | Rice | Rabi and Garden | Up-land | Total | Waste | Total |\n| Mamlatd\u00e1r's... | Rs. 68,000 | Rs. 61,300 | Rs. 2752 | Rs. 4020 | Rs. 68,078 | Rs. 63,610 | Rs. 2801 | Rs. 4113 | Rs. 75,524 | Rs. 4437 | Rs. 79,981 |\n| Mah\u00e1lkari's ... | Rs. 47,848 | Rs. 45,170 | Rs. 1139 | Rs. 3327 | Rs. 46,656 | Rs. 47,058 | Rs. 1194 | Rs. 3546 | Rs. 51,796 | Rs. 3173 | Rs. 54,969 |\n| Total ... | Rs. 1,13,848 | Rs. 1,06,470 | Rs. 3891 | Rs. 7565 | Rs. 1,17,714 | Rs. 1,15,668 | Rs. 3965 | Rs. 7659 | Rs. 1,27,320 | Rs. 7610 | Rs. 1,34,860 |\n\nWhen it was settled in 1861 the S\u00e1sette sub-division included the islands of S\u00e1sette and Karanja. Karanja or Uran which was a petty division under a mah\u00e1lkari was not classed, and the work of settlement was confined to the mamlatd\u00e1r's charge the fifty-three villages of the island of S\u00e1sette. These villages were arranged in three groups. The first group consisted of fourteen villages, Bandra, Danda, six adjoining villages on the Ghodbunder road and six villages round Trombay. For the sweet rice land in this group a highest acre rate of 16s. (Rs. 8) was fixed applicable to single crop land only. In cases where onions, pulse, and vegetables were grown as a second crop in the hot season, and there was a considerable extent of this cultivation in the rice lands of S\u00e1sette, an extra water rate was imposed, calculated on the scale of four annas the rupee, so that the highest acre rate for the best double crop lands came to \u00a31 (Rs. 10). The second class consisted of twenty-two villages some between Bh\u00e1ndup and Th\u00e1na, others surrounding Th\u00e1na, and others near the Ghodbunder road adjoining the Bandra group; for these a rate of 14s. (Rs. 7) was fixed in addition to an extra double crop levy calculated as above. For sixteen villages most adjoining Ghodbunder and a few on the north-eastern boundary the rate fixed was 12s. (Rs. 6), subject to the increase of four annas the rupee where there was irrigation sufficient for a double crop. In the case of salt-rice lands 12s. (Rs. 6) and 10s. (Rs. 5) were fixed for the first group and for some villages of the second group, 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) was\nfixed for the third group, and in Bh\u00e1yndar which had no sweet rice land, a rate of 8s. (Rs. 4) was fixed.\n\nOf garden lands the most valuable were the cocoa palm and graft mango gardens, the latter being peculiar to S\u00e1lsette. From the high price of the fruit of graft mango trees in Bombay their cultivation yielded a large return. Instead of the existing rate of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd), the highest rate fixed for these gardens was \u00a31 (Rs. 10), to be applied only to such as were fully planted with at least sixty trees to the acre. A decreasing scale of rates, formed with reference to the number of trees to the acre, was applied to thinly planted gardens. In this way the assessment rates for mango gardens varied from \u00a31 to 6s. (Rs. 10-Rs. 3). For cocoa-palm gardens three classes of acre rates were fixed, \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15), \u00a31 4s. (Rs. 12), and \u00a31 (Rs. 10). The first rate \u00a31 10s. (Rs. 15) was applied only to B\u00e1ndra, D\u00e1nda, and Ves\u00e1va, which had the best gardens of this kind. The other two classes of rates were apportioned to the other garden villages, regard being had to position and the character of the cultivation in applying the higher or lower of the two rates. For country vegetable, or m\u00e1lva, cultivation, which was usually confined to the rainy season, an acre rate of 8s. (Rs. 4) was fixed. So high was the price of grass in the Bombay market that in some cases it paid to set apart the poorer rice fields for the growth of grass. For this reason the S\u00e1lsette uplands were most valuable and acre rates were fixed at 6s. (Rs. 3), 4s. (Rs. 2), 2s. (Re. 1), and 1s. (as. 8). For late crop or rabi land three acre rates were fixed, 6s. (Rs. 3), 4s. (Rs. 2), and 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd).\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n| Crop       | Collections | Survey Rental |\n|------------|-------------|---------------|\n|            | 1840-1860   | 1850-1860     | 1859-60 | Tillage | Waste | Total |\n| Rice Garden | Rs.         | Rs.           | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.   | Rs.   |\n| Upland     |             |               |         |         |       |       |\n| Total      | 63,600      | 65,290        | 64,068  | 81,488  | 4642  | 85,130|\n\nIn 1862, at the time of settlement, Bassein consisted of a tract from twelve to sixteen miles long and from fifteen to eighteen broad, and of a total area of about 250 square miles. To the north was the Vaitarna, to the east a range of small hills, to the south the Bassein river, and to the west the sea. Of 104 villages all but four alienated villages were surveyed and assessed. In the centre of the sub-division was a large chain of hills, from 1500 to 2000 feet high, whose slopes were covered with thick brushwood which from October to January made the country most unhealthy. On the other hand, for about three miles along the coast, there was a belt of very rich alluvial soil, which was irrigated by a good supply of water raised by Persian wheels from unbuilt wells only a few feet deep. Red plantains and sugarcane were the chief products.\n\n---\n\n1 See Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. and Th\u00e1na Collector's S\u00e1lsette Survey File.\nBoth had a good market, the plantains in Bombay and the sugarcane in Bassein where it was used by the Bassein Sugar Factory Company. The gardeners, who were chiefly Native Christians, were hardworking skilful husbandmen. The sub-division had the advantage of good markets at Bassein and at Ag\u00e1shi, a considerable town on the coast. The two tidal rivers by which it was enclosed supplied an outlet to the sea, while the Baroda railway furnished easy communication by land. The rates on garden lands had been thoroughly revised by the Revenue Commissioner Mr. Williamson in 1836-37 when, owing to over-assessment and the want of a market, the people were sunk in poverty and the gardens fallen out of cultivation. Mr. Williamson's revision of rates, which over the whole area of garden land represented a reduction of about a hundred per cent, had proved very successful. The people had amassed much capital and the land was in a high state of cultivation. About the time of the revision of garden rates the rice rates had also been greatly reduced in several villages.\n\nIn 1862 three forms of assessment were in use, *dhepganna* and *hund\u00e1bandi* forms of a contract payment for an indefinite area of land, and a *bigha* rate which had been introduced in some lands shortly before 1862. During the twenty years ending 1860-61 the collections ranged from \u00a38665 (Rs. 86,650) in 1841-42 to \u00a310,644 (Rs. 1,06,440) in 1860-61.\n\nThe survey was begun in 1858-59 and finished in 1861-62. The 100 villages were arranged in four classes. The first class of twenty-nine villages had a highest acre rate of 12s. (Rs. 6), the same as the highest rate in Bh\u00edwndi. These were coast villages near local markets and ports whose lands were also the most productive in the sub-division. The second class, consisting of thirty-five villages, was charged highest acre rates of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) and 10s. (Rs. 5). Besides villages near the first class, this group included villages on the banks of the Bassein river and others near the town of Bh\u00edwndi. The third class consisted of twenty-three villages further inland and consequently further from markets and ports. The rates fixed for this class were 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and 8s. (Rs. 4). The fourth class consisted of thirteen villages on the outskirts of the sub-division, mostly on the borders of M\u00e1l\u00edm, running to the foot of the hills under Takmak fort. These, which were more or less wild and feverish, were charged 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) and 6s. (Rs. 3).\n\nAs regards the garden lands, the large amount of capital that had been amassed and the rise of about fifty per cent in the value of garden produce, were considered to justify a considerable increase in the rates. On the basis of difference in productive power they were arranged under three classes. The best garden lands were in the villages round Bassein where the people had the advantage of nearness to a good market. These lands formed the first group and were charged a highest acre rate of 16s. (Rs. 8). The second\n\n---\n\n1 The intermediate rates of 11s., 9s., and 7s. (Rs. 5\u00bd, Rs. 4\u00bd, and Rs. 3\u00bd) were fixed with a view to distribute the assessment more fairly over the villages on the outskirts of each group. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 879.\ngroup included all the villages along the coast which lay beyond those of the first class and were charged at the rate of 14s. (Rs. 7) an acre. The third group included a small batch of villages on the inland border of the garden tract. They were charged at the rate of 12s. (Rs. 6) an acre. Compared with the previous rates there was no change in the highest class. But the second and third classes were raised from 8s. to 14s. and 12s. (Rs. 4 to Rs. 7 and Rs. 6). The reason of this great advance was that, when the former rates were introduced, these lands were out of tillage and specially light rates were required to induce the people to take them up.\n\nIn some of the coast villages there was a small area of late crop or rabi land, which though unsuited for grain yielded good pulse and other crops. It sometimes grew unwatered, or nipani, sugar-cane. For this land an acre rate of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was fixed. The uplands of villages near markets were charged 6d. (4 as.) and those of the more outlying villages 4\u00bdd. (3 as.) an acre.\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n| Years          | Rice | Garden | Late crop and Upland | Total | Waste | Total |\n|----------------|------|--------|----------------------|-------|-------|-------|\n|                | Rs.  | Rs.    | Rs.                  | Rs.   | Rs.   | Rs.   |\n| 1851-52 to 1860-61 | ...  | 82,335 | 29,771               | 1324  | 1,06,440 |       |\n| 1860-61        | 84,917 | 28,879 | 3851                 | 1,18,647 | 8296 | 1,16,948 |\n| Survey Rental  |      |        |                      |       |       |       |\n| Increase       | 2582 | 7108   | 2517                 | 12,207 | 8296 | 20,503 |\n\nThe 1860-61 land revenue collections of \u00a310,644 (Rs. 1,06,440) were higher than in any of the previous nineteen years. The 1862 settlement showed an increase from \u00a310,644 to \u00a311,865 (Rs. 1,06,440-Rs. 1,18,650) or a rise of \u00a31221 (Rs. 12,210). More than half of this rise was due to the enhanced rates on garden lands by which the rental had been raised from \u00a32277 to \u00a32988 (Rs 22,770-Rs. 29,880). In rice lands, though in individual cases there were great changes both of enhancement and of decrease, the general result was a very slight increase of about three per cent. Compared with the average collections of the ten years before the settlement, the rates fixed in 1862 yielded an increase from \u00a39723 to \u00a311,865 (Rs. 97,230-Rs. 1,18,650) or a rise of \u00a32142 (Rs. 21,420). There was also the prospect of a further increase of \u00a3830 (Rs. 8300) from the cultivation of arable waste.\n\nIn Mahim the survey was begun in 1858 and finished in 1862. At the time of settlement (1863) the Mahim sub-division was 24\u00bd miles from north to south and from sixteen to nine miles from east to west. It was bounded on the north by Sanjan; on the east lofty but irregular hills separated it from Kolvan and Jawhar; on the south the Vaitarna separated it from Bassein; and on the west was the sea. Of the total area of 330 square miles or 211,200 acres, 33,135 were arable, 33,469 upland, and the rest hill and forest. For some distance inland, the country was fairly flat and much broken by swamps and creeks; the interior was very hilly and\ncovered with forest. At the close of the rains, both inland and on the coast, the climate was very unhealthy, and fever especially prevalent. The rainfall at Mahim was 96\u00b73 in 1861 and 71\u00b797 inches in 1862, the corresponding Bassein figures being 79\u00b75 and 61\u00b711 inches and the Sanjan figures 103\u00b75 and 67\u00b72 inches. There were no made roads, but, during the fair season, most of the subdivision was passable for carts. The chief cart road, running parallel with the coast, was crossed by numerous broad creeks at Dantivra, Kelva-Mahim, Saptati, and Tarapur, which rendered traffic most tedious. Another cart track from Bhiwandi passed through this sub-division between two ranges of hills and joined the coast line beyond Tarapur. This route avoided the large creeks but was very hilly and broken. There were also cart tracks by which traffic could be conveyed from all parts of the sub-division to the different ports on the west of the range of hills which run north and south nearly through the centre of the sub-division. The villages to the east of that range were saved from isolation by the Vaitarna, which being navigable to Manor afforded an outlet for field produce and timber. The chief markets were Mahim, Kelva, Shirgaon, Tarapur, and Manor. There were ports on the seaboard at Dantivra, Kelva-Mahim, and Tarapur. Much rice and wood were exported to Surat, Bombay, and Thana.\n\nDuring the twenty years ending 1861-62 the average net rental had amounted to about \u00a37400 (Rs. 74,000), and during the ten years ending 1861-62 to a little over \u00a38200 (Rs. 82,000). Except in 1845-46 when they amounted to about \u00a37400 (Rs. 74,000), between 1842-43 and 1855-56 collections varied from \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000) in 1843-44 to \u00a37200 (Rs. 72,000) in 1851-52 and 1855-56; in no case since 1843-44 had they fallen below \u00a36400 (Rs. 64,000). After 1855-56 they continued to rise until in 1860-61 they reached \u00a310,200 (Rs. 1,02,000), the highest sum collected during the twenty years ending 1861-62; they then fell in the next year to \u00a39200 (Rs. 92,000). The largest remissions were \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000) granted in 1849-50, \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) in 1853-54, and \u00a3610 (Rs. 6100) in 1855-56; in none of the remaining years did remissions amount to more than \u00a3250 (Rs. 2500).\n\nThe existing rates of assessment were very unequal. Of the 168 villages, two alienated and one khoti village were excluded from the survey settlement. Of the 165 settled villages 164 were Government and one was shared or sharakati. They were arranged in four classes with highest acre rates varying from 1s. to 5s.\n\n---\n\n1 The rice land of Tarapur paid an acre rate of about 2s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bd), and the neighbouring village of Kudan 5s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 2\u00b714\u00b76). Duntan, which had some excellent rice land, paid only 3s. 8d. (Re. 1\u00b713\u00b74), and the neighbouring village of Kambohi 5s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 2\u00b714\u00b76). Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXIII, 11-12.\n\n2 Of the khoti villages Mr., now Sir H., Ellis wrote, 'The Vehloli village though called khoti is not held on the same tenure as the khoti villages of the South Konkan, which are liable to revision without reference to the wishes of the holders. This village is held at a rental which is not to be raised on survey, a tenure more like the uthad jamabandi of Gujar\u00e1t than the khoti tenure of the South Konkan.' 7th April 1863, in Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXIII. 5\u00b76,11.\nThe first class with highest rates of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) and 10s. (Rs. 5) consisted of sixty-five villages situated along the coast and the Vaitarna river. The second class with highest rates of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and 8s. (Rs. 4) consisted of forty-three villages adjoining the first group and within a few miles of water carriage. The third class with rates of 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) and 6s. (Rs. 3) consisted of fifty-four villages, chiefly within the ranges of hills and removed from the river. The fourth class, with a highest acre rate of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) consisted of three villages, at the foot of Takmak and surrounded by hills.\n\nThe area under garden cultivation was small. In only nine villages were garden crops grown to any extent and in eight of them the garden rates had been revised by Mr. Duncan Davidson in 1837. The rates fixed in 1863 were 12s. (Rs. 6) for villages on the coast and 10s. (Rs. 5) for the rest. At these rates the survey rental showed an increase of \u00a3115 (Rs. 1150) on the collections of 1861-62, which were larger than any during the twenty preceding years. In the opinion of the settlement officer the increase was justified by the high value of produce and the increased facility of transport which the railway would give. The late crop land of which there were only 130 acres did not materially differ from that of Bassein. It was assessed at the Bassein acre rate of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd).\n\nIn most parts of Mahim the grass was coarse and rank; only in the hills, which were difficult of access, was it fit for hay. For this reason the rate fixed for uplands in villages along the coast and whose position brought them into the 10s. (Rs. 5) and 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) rates, was 4\u00bdd. (3 as.), and for villages in the interior 3d. (2 as.).\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n1 For sweet rice land the maximum rate was fixed at 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) and for salt rice land at 8s. (Rs. 4). These rates applied to all coast villages. They were reduced by eight annas as the villages were further inland or less favourably situated as regards communication, until among the hills the rate was reduced to 6s. (Rs. 3); and in three villages where the people, chiefly Varlis, were exceedingly poor and the country very unhealthy, the rate was fixed at 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd). As was usual in other settled sub-divisions these rates were liable to be enhanced by two annas where ansota, or a second crop was grown. Bom. Gov. Sel.

It yielded sugarcane, plantains, betel leaves, ginger, turmeric, and chillies. Bom. Gov. Sel.

It was bounded on the north-west by Daman, on the north and north-east by the Damanganga river separating it from Surat, on the east by Daman, on the south by the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division of Sanj\u00e1n, and on the west by the sea. The total area was about 206 square miles or 132,114 acres, divided into sixty-nine Government villages, in all of which the survey settlement was introduced. The villages along the coast, though not free from fever between October and the close of the year, had a fair climate and were generally rather thickly peopled. They had the advantage of coast harbours for the export of their produce, and were within easy distance of the Baroda railway. None of the inland villages were far from these means of communication, the eastern border of Umbargaon being in no place more than eighteen miles from the coast. But the scanty population and the unhealthy climate of the inland villages outweighed their advantages. Especially in the north near the Damanganga river, the country was unusually flat for the Konkan and could be crossed by carts in all directions. Though neither of them were made, the main coast road from Surat to Bombay, and, a few miles inland, the track known as the Army Road, always used by troops on their march to Gujar\u00e1t, were both broad serviceable lines of communication. The greater part of the Umbargaon produce went to Surat. Besides Umbargaon which was the best port, there were other places along the coast where boats anchored to land and take in produce. But except a small traffic with Surat there was no trade.\n\nThe greater part of the Umbargaon petty division was held under the hund\u00e1bandi or unmeasured plot system and paid an assessment fixed in the lump on a certain combined area of rice and upland. The boundaries of these hund\u00e1s or unmeasured plots were never well marked, probably owing to the wild character of the district, and in the lapse of time their original limits seem to have been entirely lost. Survey inquiries showed marked discrepancies in the size and value of the hund\u00e1s, and proved that a large portion of the land had been held at nominal rates. In some cases the survey rates raised individual holdings from 7s. 4\u00bdd. to \u00a36 5s. 9d. (Rs. 3-11-\n\n---\n\n1 Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXXVIII. 13.\nRs. 62-14). Still, in spite of these instances of increase, the people readily accepted the settlement and showed themselves most anxious to secure the waste.\n\nThe sixty-nine villages were divided into five classes. The first class included almost all villages near the coast. They were fifteen in number and were charged a highest rice acre-rate of 12s. (Rs. 6). The second class for which highest rates of 11s. (Rs. 5\u00bd) and 10s. (Rs. 5) were fixed, consisted of twenty-four villages generally fairly peopled and from three to six miles from the coast. The third class for which the rates of 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd) and 8s. (Rs. 4) were fixed, consisted of ten villages which though somewhat unhealthy were fairly tilled. They lay east of the preceding group, and stretched eight or ten miles inland. Nine wild, unhealthy, and thinly peopled villages, situated further east than the third class, constituted the fourth class and were charged 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) and 6s. (Rs. 3). The fifth was a special class including eleven unhealthy and thinly peopled inland villages for which 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and 4s. (Rs. 2) were fixed.\n\nThe soil and climate of the coast villages were well suited to the growth of cocoa palms and other garden crops. But their natural advantages had not been turned to account, as there were only ten acres under garden tillage. The highest acre rate for garden lands in coast villages was fixed at 12s. (Rs. 6). There was also a small area of garden land in some of the more inland villages, where cultivation was almost confined to vegetables irrigated from unbuilt wells worked in the cold season only. The rate fixed for these lands\n\n---\n\n1 The following are instances of the great increase in village rentals caused by the introduction of the survey rates:\n\n**Umbargaon Settlement, 1864.**\n\n| Villages | Old settlement | Survey assessment | Increase per cent. |\n|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Chimbva  | Rs. 100        | Rs. 469           | 369                |\n| Khunavda | Rs. 110        | Rs. 352           | 220                |\n| Dahad    | Rs. 111        | Rs. 286           | 158                |\n| Anklas   | Rs. 312        | Rs. 932           | 198                |\n\nThe increase in the following single holdings was still more marked:\n\n**Umbargaon, 1864.**\n\n| Old settlement | Survey assessment | Increase |\n|----------------|-------------------|----------|\n| Rs. a.         | Rs. a.            | Rs. a.   |\n| 1 12           | 24 3             | 22 7     |\n| 2 9            | 20 11            | 18 2     |\n| 3 11           | 62 14            | 59 3     |\n| 7 0            | 51 14            | 44 14    |\n| 10 12          | 104 4            | 93 8     |\n\n2 The rates of 11s., 9s., 7s., and 5s. (Rs. 5\u00bd, Rs. 4\u00bd, Rs. 3\u00bd, and Rs. 2\u00bd) were intermediate rates adopted with a view to meet the case of villages in such a position that the rate of the group above them was too high and that of the group below them too low. These intermediate rates obviated inequalities of assessment in neighbouring villages. Bom. Gov. Sel. LXXXVIII. 7.\nwas 6s. (Rs. 3). For cold weather or late crop land the former rate of 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was continued. The uplands were unlike those of any other sub-division. The soil was of a dullish black of considerable depth and too retentive of moisture for the growth of *n\u00e1chni* and *n\u00e1gli* the chief upland crops of other sub-divisions. At the same time it was suitable for the castor-oil plant which was widely grown in some parts. The people also grew an inferior rice in these black soils. Though more valuable than the ordinary uplands, these lands required a three years' fallow after two or three years of cropping. Thus, on the average, the soil yielded a return only every other season. The rate fixed for this land was 1s. 3d. (10 as.) to be paid every year, an amount equal to an acre rate of 2s. 6d. (Re. 1\u00bd) on lands capable of continuous cultivation.\n\nThe following statement shows the effect of the survey:\n\n**Umbargaon Settlement, 1864-65.**\n\n| SETTLEMENT | 1863-64 | COLLECTIONS |\n|------------|---------|-------------|\n|            |         |             |\n|            | Rice.   | Upland     | Waste.    | TOTAL | 1863-64. | 1844-45 | 1854-55 | 1862-63 |\n|            | Rs.     | and Dry    | Rs.       | Rs.   | Rs.       | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Existing   | 47,776  | crop.      | No record.| (a)59,090| 70,776 | 42,038  | 44,786  | 47,792  |\n| Survey...  | 54,195  | crop.      |           | (a)59,090|        |          |          |          |\n| Increase   | 6859    | Garden.    |           | (a)59,090|        |          |          |          |\n\n(a) The actual collections were Rs. 43,683.

(Rs. 43) were abolished.\n\nIn 1865, when it was settled, Kolvan was a very large and diversified sub-division. It was irregular in shape, especially along its western frontier, the Tal\u00e1sri petty division in the north-west being almost detached from the rest of the sub-division by a strip of the Jawh\u00e1r state. It was bounded on the north by Peint, on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dri hills, on the south by Bhiwndi and Murbad, and on the west by M\u00e1him and Jawh\u00e1r. Its area of 950 square miles was divided into six chief *tarafs*, two *pet\u00e1s*, and one *mah\u00e1l.*\n\nAs a whole Kolvan was wild and broken, with many hills and large forests. The most open parts were in the south where there were pretty wide stretches of rice land. The east under the Sahy\u00e1dris and the west near M\u00e1him and Jawh\u00e1r, were rougher, and there was less rice tillage. Northwards beyond the Vaitarna the country gradually rose, the roads or paths were nearly impassable, and the ravines very steep. Towards Mokh\u00e1da were long waving uplands or downs, broken by steep and rocky ravines, rice tillage being almost confined to isolated patches along the banks of small streams. In the north of Mokh\u00e1da and in\n\n---\n\n1 The *tarafs* were \u00c1ghai, S\u00e1kurl\u00ed, P\u00e1ulb\u00e1ra, Konepatti, G\u00e1rgaon, and Kohoj; the *pet\u00e1s* were V\u00e1da and Mokh\u00e1da; the *mah\u00e1l* was Tal\u00e1sri. Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 413.\nTal\u00e1sri the country was impassable except on foot, and rice was all but superseded by hill grains. There were some good forests, the best being G\u00e1tes in V\u00e1da. The climate varied in different parts. In the south \u00c1ghai, P\u00e1ulb\u00e1ra, and Konepatti, were fairly healthy, but the rest of the sub-division was most unhealthy at the close of the rains, not to be entered safely by Europeans until the end of January. On the other hand, in the hot weather when the south and east suffered from a heat, perhaps more intense than in any other part of the district, Mokh\u00e1da in the north enjoyed a climate, little if at all, inferior to that of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n. The population varied with the country. There were no towns, scarcely even a large village, except where railway servants had gathered. In the more open parts the people were mostly Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s and Kunbis, while in Mokh\u00e1da and Tal\u00e1sri they were chiefly Kolis and Th\u00e1kurs. The whole population was estimated at about 55,000 or fifty-eight to the square mile. Except the railway between Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur and the reversing station on the Tal pass, and the Bombay\u2013\u00c1gra road which ran almost parallel to the railway and was in excellent order, there were no roads but the rudest cart tracks. Mokh\u00e1da and Tal\u00e1sri were impassable even to beasts of burden.\n\nIn addition to the usual suti or permanent and ek\u00e1li or yearly tenures common to the greater part of the Konkan, there were two distinct tenures in Kolv\u00e1n, the k\u00e1sbandi or estate system and the n\u00e1ngarbandi or plough-cess system. The k\u00e1sbandi, an ancient tenure, was intermediate between the suti and then\u00e1ngarbandi system. Under it the cultivator held a certain parcel of rice and upland, which together formed an estate or k\u00e1s, the two descriptions of soil being held together and the ownership being well known and acknowledged. In the plough-rate, or n\u00e1ngarbandi, system the revenue was raised by a plough cess, each holder cultivating wherever he pleased and as much land as he could, but no individual, as a rule, claiming ownership over any particular spot. In consequence of this diversity of tenure some modification was introduced in the mode of measurement, and the settlement of villages in which the k\u00e1sbandi and n\u00e1ngarbandi systems prevailed.\n\n1 In the thirteen k\u00e1sbandi villages of Mokh\u00e1da, as in other parts of the Konkan, the rice lands were broken into separate survey numbers and sub-numbers. The whole of the upland, which, under the old system was lumped with the rice, was measured into one large survey number, and the portion of this number which together with the rice land in his occupation formed the estate or k\u00e1s of each individual, was roughly measured by chain and entered together with his rice land in the owner's holding, but not made into a separate number. Under the new settlement neither the rice nor the upland could be held or thrown up independently of the other, but the rice land with its allotted portion of upland was treated as one survey number. The portion of the upland that was not attached to any individual holding was too large to be taken by the people in addition to their own land, and was therefore broken into separate numbers varying from fifteen to thirty acres, to be taken by any individual on application, at the survey rates. There were sixty-seven plough-rate or n\u00e1ngarbandi villages, situated chiefly in Mokh\u00e1da and Tal\u00e1sri, and a few in S\u00e1kurl\u00ed. In these the rents were levied by a tax of from Rs. 3 to Rs. 12 on each plough. The old system was taken as the basis of the new settlement and considerable modifications were made. The rice lands were measured and classified as usual and entered in the name of the actual holder,\nAt the time of settlement there were 835 villages in the Kolvan sub-division. In 325 of them the survey settlement was introduced in 1865-66. The highest acre rate fixed for rice land was from 10s. to 6s. (Rs. 5 - Rs. 3) in the more open portions of the sub-division, while Mokhada and Talasri, on account of their isolated position and want of roads, were granted a special rate of not more than 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd) and 4s. (Rs. 2). There were no garden lands. Cold weather crop lands, which were but of small extent, had a highest acre rate of 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd). For uplands the highest rate was fixed at 6d. (4 as.) and the lowest, for some villages of Talasri, at 1\u00bdd. (1 anna). Wood-ash or dali numbers were marked off in a few villages on the rugged sides of the Sahyadris and in Talasri. The area was small and the total assessment only \u00a325 (Rs. 250).\n\nDuring the twenty years ending 1863-64 the average collections had amounted to \u00a35983 (Rs. 59,830), and during the last ten of those years to \u00a36409 (Rs. 64,090). With insignificant remissions the revenue seems to have steadily increased since 1844-45. Compared with \u00a37096 (Rs. 70,960) the collections of 1863-64, the survey rental \u00a310,081 (Rs. 1,00,810) showed an increase of \u00a32985 (Rs. 29,850) or 42 per cent. Of this \u00a32398 (Rs. 23,980) were on account of land in actual occupation, while \u00a3587 (Rs. 5870) was the rental expected to be realised when the whole arable assessed waste came under tillage.\n\nThe survey assessment absorbed various levies known as lajima, lagantaka, mohtarfa, and telikhut, which in 1864-65 yielded a sum of \u00a336 (Rs. 360). In Mokhada the patils had usually some fields which they tilled free of rent and called their inam. As the people were most anxious that their patils might be allowed to hold these lands free, and as the lands were of small extent, they were\n\nthe assessment being leviable from each individual as in other parts of the district. Half the gains in this case were to go to the headman if he signed the agreement, and the other half to the cultivators. To protect the patil in case the number of ploughs in any particular village should be seriously diminished, a condition was inserted in the agreement, that if the number of ploughs were reduced by one half, a petition for remission would be entertained. The uplands, mal or varkas, of the village were left in one large number, and assessed at a lump sum fixed on its quality and extent at from three amas to one anna the acre, the amount being payable by the whole body of cultivators. The loss in this case was to be borne by all the parties concerned. Major Waddington, 20th Dec. 1863, in Bom. Gov. Sel.

In Tal\u00e1sri the p\u00e1t\u00edls had formerly been freed from payment to the extent of the value of a plough, half a plough, or less, according to the size of their village. In place of this arrangement they were granted five per cent of the net revenue of their villages. It was also arranged that the term of the survey lease in estate and plough rate villages should be limited to ten years, and, in the rest of the sub-division, should come to an end at the same time as the Bhiwndi leases.\n\nThe survey settlement was introduced into the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division of the Sanj\u00e1n or D\u00e1h\u00e1nu sub-division in 1866-67. It lay to the north of the M\u00e1him sub-division, and contained an area of 470 square miles and a population of 31,696 or 67 per square mile. There was a marked difference in the character of the villages. Those of the westerly parts were open and with fine rice lands traversed by rail and with sea transit within easy reach, while the others were very rough and wild, and with no means of communication. The population was unequally distributed. While the two coast village groups, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and Chinchni, containing 32 villages and an area of 80 square miles, had a population of 166 to the square mile, the 140 villages which formed the rest of the division and contained 390 square miles, had no more than sixty souls to the square mile. In point of climate and means of communication the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r\u2019s division differed little from the subordinate Umbargaon petty division settled in 1864-65.\n\nThe principal tenures were the hund\u00e1bandi or an assessment fixed in the lump for a certain extent of rice and hill-crop land combined; the mudk\u00e9bandi (mudd\u00e1bandi) or lump assessment in grain commuted into a money payment; and the nangarbandi or plough tax tenure. The two former were found in the village groups of Chinchni, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, and Asheri, and the last prevailed throughout the whole of the rest of the sub-division.\n\nThe 172 villages were arranged in five classes. Sixteen villages along the coast were placed in the first class with a highest acre rate of 12s. (Rs. 6). Three villages immediately adjoining the first group were placed in the second class with a highest acre rate of 10s. (Rs. 5). Seven villages near the railway and two of them near Manor formed the third class with a highest acre rate of 8s. (Rs. 4). The fourth class consisted of twenty-one villages for which highest acre rates of 7s. (Rs. 3\u00bd) and 6s. (Rs. 3) were fixed. This group occupied the more open and better cultivated parts of Asheri and Gambhirgad and some of the poorer villages of Chinchni. The fifth class consisted of 124 villages with highest acre rates of 5s. and 4s. (Rs. 2\u00bd and Rs. 2). It included the village groups of B\u00e1rrha, Udva, B\u00e1l\u00e1pur, and Dharampur, and parts of Asheri and Gambhirgad. The remaining village had no rice land.\n\nFor the cocoa-palm gardens which were confined to the two villages of Chinchni and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, a highest acre rate of 12s. (Rs. 6)\n\n---\n\n1 A short lease was advisable for the upland settlement. And as the villages, for which the ten-year lease was recommended, were in the same division (the Mokh\u00e1da peta), no confusion was likely to result. Major Francis, 27th June 1866, in Bom. Gov. Sel. XCVI. 428.\nwas fixed. It raised the payment from \u00a3102 to \u00a3125 (Rs. 1020-Rs. 1250).\n\nFor late crop land which was small, the highest acre rate 3s. (Re. 1\u00bd) was retained. The total assessment under this head was only \u00a34 6s. (Rs. 43).\n\nFor hill crop land the usual highest acre rate of 6d. (4 as.) in the coast villages, and 4\u00bdd. and 3d. (3 and 2 annas) in those further inland and more scantily populated, were retained.\n\nThe rates on liquor-yielding palms varied from 6d. (4 as.) a year on each tree in villages on the coast to 3d. (2 as.) in the inland villages. On date trees a uniform rate of one anna was fixed. In 1865-66 the number of persons licensed to sell liquor was 887 and the payment on account of them was \u00a3380 (Rs. 3800). Under the new settlement the number of shops fell to 156 and the amount of tax levied for 1866-67 was \u00a3651 (Rs. 6510).\n\nThe following statement shows the effects of the survey:\n\nSanjan Settlement, 1866.\n\n| YEAR | RICH. | LATE CROP. | GARDEN. | UPLAND. | TOTAL |\n|------|-------|------------|---------|---------|-------|\n|      | Acres.| Assessment | Acres.| Assessment | Acres.| Assessment | Acres.| Assessment |\n| 1846-1865 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Rs. 31,037 |\n| 1866-1865 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Rs. 34,390 |\n| 1866-67 | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | Rs. 45,577 |\n| Survey | 27,167 | 49,142 | 48 | 43 | 247 | 1248 | 75,895 | 9156 | 108,397 | Rs. 55,359 |\n\nIn addition to the assessment on the cultivated lands, a further sum of \u00a3190 (Rs. 1900) assessed on the waste lands raised the total settlement to \u00a36149 (Rs. 61,490).\n\nThe increase on the twenty years average was very great, no less than 92 per cent. But the old settlement was so imperfect that it was useless as a means of estimating what assessment the division could bear. The incidence of the old payments had been very unequal. In 1868 the Superintendent wrote, \"The completion of the Baroda railway which crosses the district with three stations within reach of many parts of it has greatly increased the value of land, and when the low rates of the wild villages in which the principal increase occurs are taken into consideration, no fear need be entertained regarding the fairness of the settlement.\" Several b\u0101bs or cesses, such as mah\u0101l majkur, tup, udid, were abolished.\n\nIn 1856 when the survey settlement was introduced in Panvel, Uran consisting of nineteen villages formed part of S\u0101lsette. This group was subsequently transferred to Panvel before the settlement of S\u0101lsette in 1861. Consequently the survey assessment was not introduced in it till November 1866. At this time the Uran petty division comprised the tract of country lying between the Karanja hill on the west and the tablelands of Panvel on the east including Hog Island and the island of Elephanta. Great part of this tract was a low-lying swamp, flooded formerly by the backwaters of the harbour flowing round Hog Island on the one side and on the other\n\n---\n\n1 Major Waddington, 474, 14th October 1868.\nby the tidal waters, which, after passing round the south headland of Karanja, flowed inland up the N\u00e1gothna and Pen creeks. By reclamation works, composed chiefly of large embankments, almost the whole of this tract had been brought under salt rice cultivation. The revenue had been subject to but little fluctuation; cultivation had been steady, and the rates being fixed in cash payments had not been subject to change.\n\nLying on the eastern side of the harbour and immediately opposite to Bombay, this division of nineteen villages was very favourably situated with regard to the export of its grain and grass. Of the nineteen villages only nine had sweet rice land. For six of these the highest survey rate fixed was 16s. (Rs. 8) and for three 14s. (Rs. 7). Of the remaining ten villages with salt rice lands, for five the corresponding rate was 10s. (Rs. 5), for four 9s. (Rs. 4\u00bd), and for one, Hog Island which occupied the most exposed situation, 8s. (Rs. 4).\u00b9 The garden lands were of small extent, and the crops grown were chiefly vegetables. For these a highest survey rate of 10s. (Rs. 5) was fixed. For lands where cocoanuts, betelnuts, and other more valuable crops were raised, the highest rate fixed was \u00a31 (Rs. 10). Considering the value of grass and the ease with which it was sent to Bombay, the highest rate for hill crop lands was fixed at 4s. (Rs. 2).\n\nThe effect of this settlement was an increase in revenue from \u00a32212 to \u00a32979 (Rs. 22,120-Rs. 29,790) or about thirty-four per cent on the previous year's payments. There was besides waste land assessed at \u00a3122 (Rs. 1220).\n\nThe following statement\u00b2 gives the acreage and rental, and shows the financial effect of the survey settlement in each of the present sub-divisions of the Th\u00e1na district:\n\n\u00b9 In some of the villages the cultivation was exposed to considerable risk from the tidal floods, and the Superintendent assessed those villages at lower rates. Major Francis, 20th November 1866.\n\n\u00b2 Compiled from information supplied by Mr. Harrison, Deputy Superintendent of Survey. The statement in the text has been compiled on the basis of the present (1882) sub-divisions. Taking the district in the village group or Survey Blocks in which the survey was actually introduced, the returns show an increase on the whole of about sixteen per cent. The details are given in the following statement:\n\n**Th\u00e1na Survey Effects, 1854-1866.**\n\n| Sub-Division | Former | Survey | Increase per cent. | Decrease per cent. |\n|--------------|--------|--------|-------------------|--------------------|\n| Kh\u00e1l\u00e1ipur    | Rs. 50,740 | Rs. 46,624 | ...               | 8\u00b712               |\n| Nasr\u00e1pur     | Rs. 69,000 | Rs. 60,597 | ...               | 3\u00b791               |\n| Panam\u00e1       | Rs. 1,02,425 | Rs. 1,09,664 | 6\u00b709             | ...                |\n| Kaly\u00e1n       | Rs. 77,951 | Rs. 80,241 | 2\u00b798             | ...                |\n| Tal\u00f3ja       | Rs. 92,065 | Rs. 1,02,897 | 25\u00b735            | ...                |\n| Murb\u00e1d       | Rs. 1,28,345 | Rs. 1,29,180 | 0\u00b773             | ...                |\n| Bh\u00edwandi     | Rs. 1,13,845 | Rs. 1,27,320 | 11\u00b783            | ...                |\n| S\u00e1lsette     | Rs. 65,280 | Rs. 74,240 | 13\u00b790            | ...                |\n| Band\u00e1        | Rs. 65,280 | Rs. 13,647 | 22\u00b702            | ...                |\n| M\u00e1h\u00edm        | Rs. 91,586 | Rs. 99,907 | 7\u00b774             | ...                |\n| Umbargaon    | Rs. 44,786 | Rs. 66,655 | 48\u00b785            | ...                |\n| Kolvan       | Rs. 64,091 | Rs. 94,929 | 48\u00b713            | ...                |\n| Sanj\u00e1n       | Rs. 84,360 | Rs. 50,589 | 78\u00b742            | ...                |\n| Uran         | Rs. 22,120 | Rs. 29,790 | 84\u00b767            | ...                |\n\nTotal: Rs. 10,44,360 | Rs. 12,11,638 | 16\u00b701 | ...\nThe available revenue returns show that a marked increase of revenue accompanied and has followed the introduction of the revenue survey. The collections rose from \u00a395,550 (Rs. 9,55,500) in 1855 when the revenue assessment was introduced in 114 villages to \u00a3129,099 (Rs. 12,90,990) in 1866, when the new rates had been introduced over the whole 1956 villages. Between 1866 and 1878 collections have slowly but steadily increased to \u00a3131,649 (Rs. 13,16,490) in 1870-71, \u00a3132,670 (Rs. 13,26,700) in 1875-76, and \u00a3132,771 (Rs. 13,27,710) in 1877-78. This increase in rental is not solely, probably not mainly, due to the survey settlement. The spread of tillage and rise in revenue, during the years of the unnatural prosperity that was caused by the American war, were as marked in the unrevised as in the revised sub-divisions, and since the time of unnatural prosperity has passed, though evenness and certainty of tenure have no doubt helped, the main causes of increased revenue seem to be the spread of population all over the district and the greater demand in Bombay for almost all kinds of field produce.\n\nThe following statement gives the land revenue receipts before, during, and since the introduction of the revenue survey settlement:\n\n| Years | Government | Alienate | Total |\n|-------|------------|----------|-------|\n|       | Occupied   | Waste    |       |\n|       | Assessment | Remis.   |        |\n|       |            | Collections |        |\n|       |            | Assessment |        |\n|       |            | Grazing fees |        |\n|       |            | Assessment |        |\n|       |            | Quitrent |        |\n|       |            | Assessment |        |\n|       |            | Collections |        |\n|       |            | Outstanding Villages |        |\n\nThis statement is supplied by Mr. Harrison, Deputy Superintendent of Survey.\nAs far as information is available, during the thirty-four years ending 1879-80, population has increased from 554,937 to 908,548 or 63\u00b772 per cent; houses from 117,705 to 174,428 or 48\u00b719 per cent; carts from 19,780 to 26,327 or 33\u00b709 per cent; ploughs from 70,352 to 87,422 or 24\u00b726 per cent; and wells from 10,959 to 11,163 or 1\u00b786 per cent; live-stock returns show a fall from 435,302 to 396,654 or 8\u00b787 per cent. The land revenue collections have risen from \u00a395,798 to \u00a3138,069 (Rs. 9,57,980-Rs. 13,80,690) or 44\u00b712 per cent; the tillage area has spread from 970,220 acres in 1868-69 to 1,015,841 acres in 1879-80 or 4\u00b765 per cent; nine municipalities, eleven dispensaries, and 150 schools have been established. The Baroda railway runs north and south for about 100 miles along the coast. The Peninsula railway crosses twenty-six miles of country, and then dividing has a length of forty miles along its south-eastern and of forty-two miles along its north-eastern branch. The two main trunk roads through the Tal and Bor passes were in use before the beginning of this period. Besides them several of the small Sahyadri passes have been opened for traffic, and in different parts of the district, about 230 miles of road have been made and are kept in repair.\n\nThe following statement shows these results in tabular form:\n\n**Th\u00e1na Development, 1846-1880.**\n\n| YEARS | POPULATION | HOUSES | CARTS | PLOUGHS | LIVE STOCK | WELLS | LAND REVENUE |\n|-------|------------|--------|-------|---------|------------|-------|--------------|\n|       |            |        |       |         | Cattle.    | Sheep and Goats. | Total. |              |\n| 1845-46 | 554,937   | 117,705 | 19,780 | 70,352  | 386,655    | 48,644 | 436,302      | 10,959 | \u00a395,798     |\n| 1879-80 | 908,548   | 174,428 | 26,327 | 87,422  | 354,838    | 42,316 | 396,654      | 11,163 | \u00a3138,069    |\n| Increase per cent | 63\u00b772 | 48\u00b719 | 33\u00b709 | 24\u00b726 | ... | ... | ... | 1\u00b786 | 44\u00b712 |\n| Decrease per cent | ... | ... | ... | ... | 8\u00b735 | 13 | 8\u00b787 | ... | ... |\n\nSECTION V.\u2014SEASON REPORTS.\n\nThe following is a summary of the chief available facts regarding the state of the district during the last thirty years:\n\nDuring the early part of the rains of 1851, the rain was so heavy and incessant that embankments were destroyed and the crops near creeks and rivers were injured or lost. Many of the sweet and salt rice fields were left waste, and in those that were re-sown the crops were not so good as usual. During the latter part of the season no rain fell and the late rice, and rice in dry or salt lands failed. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3103,711 to \u00a3104,276 (Rs. 10,37,110-Rs. 10,42,760), \u00a32080 (Rs. 20,800) were remitted, and \u00a31491 (Rs. 14,910) left outstanding.\n\nThe season of 1852-53 was tolerably favourable, though in parts of the district, some land was left waste for want of rice plants, and, in others, loss was caused by delayed planting, and near rivers by floods and blight. Unusually high spring tides in April and May damaged some of the salt rice lands. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3104,276 to \u00a3106,350 (Rs. 10,42,760-\nRs. 10,63,500), \u00a32157 (Rs. 21,570) were remitted, and \u00a31204 (Rs. 12,040) left outstanding.\n\nIn 1853-54 a failure of the latter rains greatly damaged the crops, and the breach of embankments by spring tides caused serious loss. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3106,350 to \u00a3106,192 (Rs. 10,63,500 - Rs. 10,61,920), \u00a31504 (Rs. 15,040) were remitted, and \u00a31904 (Rs. 19,040) left outstanding.\n\nThe rains of 1854-55 were favourable. All classes agreed that the harvest was the best for seven or eight years. In Kolvan and Sai the late rain harmed the crops, and in Bassein the salt rice crops were partially injured by grubs; everywhere else the yield was abundant. A hurricane on the 1st November caused great damage in some of the coast villages. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3106,192 to \u00a3105,087 (Rs. 10,61,920 - Rs. 10,50,870), \u00a31135 (Rs. 11,350) were remitted, and \u00a31848 (Rs. 18,480) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices averaged thirty-four pounds.\n\nIn 1855-56 the rainfall was very scanty. The monsoon began favourably but after the middle of July it suddenly stopped, or at best fell scantily, causing much injury to the crops. Nearly one-sixth of the area prepared for tillage was thrown waste and much young rice ready for planting was left to wither. In the beginning of September rain again began to fall plentifully and continued till the end of the month. In spite of this seasonable fall considerable remissions were necessary. As is usual in irregular seasons the health of the district was greatly affected. Fever was prevalent especially in the sub-divisions of Thana and Kalyan. Cholera broke out here and there, and though it did not spread, it caused considerable loss of life. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3105,087 to \u00a3104,667 (Rs. 10,50,870 - Rs. 10,46,670), \u00a33010 (Rs. 30,100) were remitted, and \u00a32016 (Rs. 20,160) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirty-four to thirty-three pounds.\n\nThe season of 1856-57 was favourable for all kinds of produce. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3104,667 to \u00a3106,770 (Rs. 10,46,670 - Rs. 10,67,700), \u00a31590 (Rs. 15,900) were remitted, and \u00a31658 (Rs. 16,580) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirty-three to thirty pounds.\n\nThe rainfall in 1857-58 was plentiful, except in Mahim and Bassein. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3106,770 to \u00a3108,382 (Rs. 10,67,700 - Rs. 10,83,820), \u00a31381 (Rs. 13,810) were remitted, and \u00a32318 (Rs. 23,180) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirty to twenty-seven pounds.\n\nIn 1858-59 the early rain was not favourable but the late rains were abundant and seasonable. The land revenue for collection rose\n\n---\n\n1 In this year some advance was made in making roads. Rs. 20 a mile were sanctioned for the repair of roads and the removal of obstacles. The south branch of the Peninsula railway was carried from Kalyan to Khopoli (Kampoli) and was opened for traffic in the beginning of 1856. Bom. Gov. Rev. Rec. 19 of 1856, part 3, 1010.\nfrom \u00a3108,382 to \u00a3111,031 (Rs. 10,83,820 - Rs. 11,10,310), \u00a33746 (Rs. 37,460) were remitted, and \u00a31729 (Rs. 17,290) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from twenty-seven to twenty-three pounds.\n\nThe season of 1859-60, though unfavourable in parts, was generally good. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3111,031 to \u00a3114,226 (Rs. 11,10,310 - Rs. 11,42,260), \u00a32557 (Rs. 25,570) were remitted, and \u00a3204 (Rs. 2040) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from twenty-three to twenty-four and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1860-61 the rainfall, a little above ninety inches, was abundant and seasonable. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3114,226 to \u00a3117,311 (Rs. 11,42,260 - Rs. 11,73,110), \u00a34854 (Rs. 48,540) were remitted, and \u00a3230 (Rs. 2300) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from twenty-four and a half to twenty-eight pounds.\n\nIn 1861-62 the rainfall of 141\u00b752 inches was abundant and seasonable and the crops were excellent. Public health was generally good; but cattle-disease was prevalent. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3117,311 to \u00a3118,298 (Rs. 11,73,110 - Rs. 11,82,980), \u00a33048 (Rs. 30,480) were remitted, and \u00a3147 (Rs. 1470) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from twenty-eight to twenty-three and a half pounds.\n\nThe rainfall of 1862-63, amounting to 96\u00b734 inches, was on the whole favourable, though there was a long break during the rice-planting time. Cholera was prevalent but did not cause any serious loss of life. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3118,298 to \u00a3122,545 (Rs. 11,82,980 - Rs. 12,25,450), \u00a32392 (Rs. 23,920) were remitted, and \u00a347 (Rs. 470) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from twenty-three and a half to seventeen pounds.\n\nThe rains of 1863-64 were, on the whole, favourable. The rainfall of 115\u00b701 inches was sufficient and seasonable and the crops were good. Public health was moderately good. Cholera was widespread but not unusually fatal. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3122,545 to \u00a3125,875 (Rs. 12,25,450 - Rs. 12,58,750), \u00a33699 (Rs. 36,990) were remitted, and \u00a327 (Rs. 270) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from seventeen to fifteen and a half pounds.\n\nThe season of 1864-65 was favourable to almost all crops. The rainfall of 94\u00b718 inches was seasonable and the yield fair. Public health was good and there was no cattle-disease. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3125,875 to \u00a3144,107 (Rs. 12,58,750 - Rs. 14,41,070), \u00a32868 (Rs. 28,680) were remitted, and \u00a39 (Rs. 90) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from fifteen and a half to thirteen and a half pounds.\n\nThe season of 1865-66 was on the whole favourable. The rainfall of 110\u00b729 inches was sufficient and the harvest was fair. Except for a rather widespread outbreak of cholera in June public health was on the whole good. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3144,107 to \u00a3141,066 (Rs. 14,41,070 - Rs. 14,10,660), \u00a3225 (Rs. 2250) were remitted, and \u00a357 (Rs. 570) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirteen and a half to nine pounds.\nThe season of 1866-67 was, on the whole, favourable, though the fall of rain, 113\u00b772 inches, was rather heavy in the beginning and scanty towards the close. Rice and some other crops suffered slightly on account of this irregularity; yet the outturn was, on the whole, satisfactory. Public health was good. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3141,066 to \u00a3138,861 (Rs. 14,10,660 - Rs. 13,68,610), \u00a31948 (Rs. 19,480) were remitted, and \u00a3186 (Rs. 1960) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from nine to eleven pounds.\n\nIn 1867-68 the rainfall of 110\u00b749 inches was favourable, and public health generally good. The land revenue for collection rose from \u00a3136,861 to \u00a3138,674 (Rs. 13,68,610 - Rs. 13,86,740), \u00a3270 (Rs. 2700) were remitted, and \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from eleven to twelve pounds.\n\nIn 1868-69 the rainfall of 103\u00b753 inches was hardly sufficient. The crops were fair and public health generally good. The land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3138,674 to \u00a3137,687 (Rs. 13,86,740 - Rs. 13,76,870), \u00a31416 (Rs. 14,160) were remitted, and \u00a3210 (Rs. 2100) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from twelve to thirteen pounds.\n\nIn 1869-70 the rainfall of 100\u00b770 inches was favourable and the crops flourishing. Cholera prevailed in part of the district during most of the season. The tillage area rose from 970,220 to 975,751 acres and the land revenue for collection from \u00a3137,687 to \u00a3138,274 (Rs. 13,76,870 - Rs. 13,82,740), \u00a3112 (Rs. 1120) were remitted, and \u00a3143 (Rs. 1430) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirteen to twelve pounds.\n\nIn 1870-71 the rainfall of 97\u00b724 inches was seasonable and sufficient. There were several cases of cholera, but the disease was never general. The tillage area fell from 975,751 to 974,092 acres, while the land revenue rose from \u00a3138,274 to \u00a3139,628 (Rs. 13,82,740 - Rs. 13,96,280), \u00a372 (Rs. 720) were remitted, and \u00a3134 (Rs. 1340) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from twelve to fifteen and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1871-72 the rainfall of 65\u00b721 inches was unseasonable and the crops were below the average. Public health was generally good. The tillage area again fell from 974,092 to 968,462 acres, while the land revenue rose from \u00a3139,628 to \u00a3140,690 (Rs. 13,96,280 - Rs. 14,06,900), \u00a3122 (Rs. 1220) were remitted, and \u00a3314 (Rs. 3140) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from fifteen and a half to thirteen and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1872-73 the rainfall of 94\u00b751 inches was copious and seasonable. Public health was generally good. The tillage area rose from 968,462 to 970,998 acres and the land revenue from \u00a3140,690 to \u00a3141,188 (Rs. 14,06,900 - Rs. 14,11,880), \u00a396 (Rs. 960) were remitted, and \u00a3319 (Rs. 3190) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from thirteen and a half to fourteen pounds.\n\nIn 1873-74 the rainfall of 86\u00b731 inches, though sufficient, was in most sub-divisions unseasonable. The rice harvest suffered slightly, but the yield of vari and n\u00e1gli was satisfactory. Fever prevailed slightly in\nsome sub-divisions, but on the whole public health was good. The tillage area rose from 970,998 to 971,915 acres, and the land revenue from \u00a3141,188 to \u00a3142,129 (Rs. 14,11,880 - Rs. 14,21,290), \u00a3134 (Rs. 1340) were remitted, and \u00a3101 (Rs. 1010) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from fourteen to fifteen and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1874-75 there was an unusually heavy rainfall of 120\u00b714 inches. Though generally more than sufficient for field work it was unseasonable in a few sub-divisions and excessive in others. The yield on the whole was satisfactory. Public health was good. Fever prevailed slightly and cattle-disease raged over almost all the district. The tillage area rose from 971,915 to 982,261 acres while the land revenue fell from \u00a3142,129 to \u00a3141,440 (Rs. 14,21,290 - Rs. 14,14,400), \u00a373 (Rs. 730) were remitted, and \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices remained unchanged at fifteen and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1875-76 the rainfall of 118\u00b751 inches was abundant and the harvest was good. Cholera prevailed throughout the district and fever in a few sub-divisions. There was a good deal of cattle-disease. The tillage area rose from 982,261 to 1,011,391 acres; but the land revenue fell from \u00a3141,440 to \u00a3141,140 (Rs. 14,14,400 - Rs. 14,11,400), \u00a3111 (Rs. 1110) were remitted, and \u00a345 (Rs. 450) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from fifteen and a half to fifteen pounds.\n\nIn 1876-77 the rainfall of 83\u00b761 inches was short and untimely. Owing to the failure of the late rains the crops suffered and a scarcity of water was feared. In D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and M\u00e1him, the rainfall was about two-thirds of the average. In Murb\u00e1d and Kaly\u00e1n it was about equal to the average, and in Karj\u00e1t it was greater. Public health was not good. Cholera raged in most of the sub-divisions during the rains, small-pox in some, and cattle disease in four sub-divisions. The tillage area rose from 1,011,391 to 1,012,190 acres, and the land revenue from \u00a3141,140 to \u00a3141,689 (Rs. 14,11,400 - Rs. 14,16,890), \u00a3188 (Rs. 1880) were remitted, and \u00a3163 (Rs. 1630) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from fifteen to thirteen pounds.\n\nIn 1877-78 the rainfall of 63\u00b786 inches was both scanty and unseasonable. It was especially unfavourable in the coast sub-divisions of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and M\u00e1him where the crops suffered seriously, and, particularly in M\u00e1him, much land bordering on the sea remained waste. The crops in the V\u00e1da, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1p\u00far, Murb\u00e1d, and Bhiw\u00e1di sub-divisions suffered; but in the remaining sub-divisions they were fair. Public health was not good. Cholera prevailed throughout the district; small-pox in three and cattle-disease in six sub-divisions. The tillage area rose from 1,012,190 to 1,015,261 acres, and the land revenue from \u00a3141,689 to \u00a3141,932 (Rs. 14,16,890 - Rs. 14,19,320), \u00a327 (Rs. 270) were remitted, and \u00a3278 (Rs. 2780) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from thirteen to twelve and a half pounds.\n\nIn spite of a rainfall of 144\u00b786 inches the season of 1878-79 was not unfavourable, especially for rice. A too long continuance of rain, and in some parts the appearance of locusts were the only drawbacks\nto what would have been an excellent harvest. The district was on the whole more free from cholera and small-pox than in the year before. The tillage area fell from 1,015,261 to 1,014,421 acres, and the land revenue from \u00a3141,932 to \u00a3140,331 (Rs. 14,19,320 - Rs. 14,03,310), \u00a316 (Rs. 160) were remitted, and \u00a3297 (Rs. 2970) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices rose from twelve and a half to eleven and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1879-80 the rainfall of 98\u00b715 inches was an average one, but it fell unfavourably. A break in July delayed field work and was followed by excessive rain in August and a somewhat short fall later on. The rice especially early and salt-land rice suffered considerably. But the inferior crops of n\u00e1gli and vari, which afford the staple food, were good. No great change occurred in the prices of cereals. Rice and tur fell very slightly and wheat rose. The prices of labour remained stationary. A few trifling advances for purchase of seed and cattle were made to the poorer classes. The season was not healthy. There was some cholera and small-pox, but fever was very prevalent. The tillage area rose from 1,014,421 to 1,015,341 acres, and the land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3140,331 to \u00a3138,107 (Rs. 14,03,310 - Rs. 13,81,070), \u00a321 (Rs. 210) were remitted, and \u00a338 (Rs. 380) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from eleven and a half to twelve and a half pounds.\n\nIn 1880-81 the rainfall of 95\u00b736 inches was rather unseasonable. The crops in all the sub-divisions but two suffered slightly, and in D\u00e1l\u00e1nu about one-third of the rice was lost. N\u00e1gli and vari were good. The prices of cereals fell considerably; and wages remained unchanged. A few trifling advances were made to the poorer classes for the purchase of seed and cattle. The season was not healthy. There was a little cholera and small-pox and much fever. The tillage area rose from 1,015,341 to 1,015,703 acres, but the land revenue for collection fell from \u00a3138,107 to \u00a3137,825 (Rs. 13,81,070 - Rs. 13,78,250), \u00a318 (Rs. 180) were remitted, and \u00a374 (Rs. 740) left outstanding. Rice rupee prices fell from twelve and a half to fifteen and a half pounds.\n\nThe following statement shows in tabular form the available yearly statistics of rainfall, prices, tillage, and land revenue during the thirty years ending 1880-81:\n\n| Years | Rainfall | Tillage Area | Remissions | Land Revenue for Collection | Outstandings | Collections | Rice Rupee Prices |\n|-------|----------|--------------|------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|\n|       | Inches   | Acres        | Rs.        | Rs.                         | Rs.          | Rs.         | Lbs.            |\n| 1851-52 | ...      | ...          | 20,796     | 10,42,737                   | 14,915       | 10,27,842    | ...              |\n| 1852-53 | ...      | ...          | 21,572     | 10,65,501                   | 12,048       | 10,51,468    | ...              |\n| 1853-54 | ...      | ...          | 15,037     | 10,61,922                   | 19,042       | 10,42,680    | ...              |\n| 1854-55 | ...      | ...          | 11,353     | 10,56,867                   | 18,478       | 10,32,288    | ...              |\n| 1855-56 | ...      | ...          | 23,103     | 10,67,676                   | 20,152       | 10,32,385    | ...              |\n| 1856-57 | ...      | ...          | 15,597     | 10,67,708                   | 16,551       | 10,51,122    | 30               |\n| 1857-58 | ...      | ...          | 18,812     | 10,85,825                   | 23,177       | 10,80,646    | 27               |\n| 1858-59 | ...      | ...          | 37,459     | 11,10,310                   | 17,394       | 10,93,018    | 28               |\n\n1 From the yearly Administration Reports.

As noticed at page 314 the different price returns vary so greatly that they cannot be considered more than estimates.\n## Thana Revenue Statistics, 1851-1881\u2014continued.\n\n| YEARS\u2014continued. | Rainfall. | Tillage Area. | Remissions. | Land Revenue for Collection. | Outstandings. | Collections. | Rice Rupee-prices. |\n|------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|\n|                  | Inches    | Acres         | Rs.         | Rs.                           | Rs.          | Rs.          | Lbs.             |\n| 1859-60          |           |               | 25,671      | 11,42,263                      | 2037         | 11,40,226    | 24\u00bd              |\n| 1860-61          | 90-05     |               | 48,542      | 11,73,116                      | 2300         | 11,70,615    | 28               |\n| 1861-62          | 141-32    |               | 30,479      | 11,82,976                      | 1473         | 11,81,501    | 22\u00bd              |\n| 1862-63          | 96-34     |               | 23,014      | 12,25,448                      | 478          | 12,24,975    | 17               |\n| 1863-64          | 115-01    |               | 83,991      | 12,67,750                      | 271          | 12,66,475    | 15\u00bd              |\n| 1864-65          | 94-18     |               | 28,676      | 14,41,089                      | 87           | 14,40,082    | 18\u00bd              |\n| 1865-66          | 110-29    |               | 2253        | 14,10,663                      | 1570         | 14,09,093    | 9                |\n| 1866-67          | 113-72    |               | 19,479      | 13,68,608                      | 1365         | 13,67,248    | 11               |\n| 1867-68          | 110-49    |               | 2700        | 13,86,741                      | 1201         | 13,85,540    | 12               |\n| 1868-69          | 106-53    |               | 970,920     | 14,15,171                      | 2100         | 14,14,773    | 13               |\n| 1869-70          | 106-70    |               | 976,751     | 14,15,872                      | 1430         | 14,15,212    | 12               |\n| 1870-71          | 97-24     |               | 974,092     | 13,96,278                      | 1940         | 13,94,398    | 15\u00bd              |\n| 1871-72          | 66-21     |               | 965,452     | 14,06,904                      | 3143         | 14,05,761    | 13\u00bd              |\n| 1872-73          | 94-51     |               | 970,998     | 14,11,876                      | 3180         | 14,08,687    | 14               |\n| 1873-74          | 86-31     |               | 971,916     | 14,21,291                      | 1009         | 14,20,282    | 16\u00bd              |\n| 1874-75          | 120-14    |               | 977,377     | 14,31,563                      | 1043         | 14,30,511    | 15               |\n| 1875-76          | 118-51    |               | 1,013,301   | 14,41,406                      | 446          | 14,40,259    | 15               |\n| 1876-77          | 58-81     |               | 1,012,190   | 14,10,893                      | 1334         | 14,10,259    | 13               |\n| 1877-78          | 65-98     |               | 1,015,461   | 14,19,322                      | 2777         | 14,16,545    | 12\u00bd              |\n| 1878-79          | 144-98    |               | 1,014,421   | 14,03,307                      | 2972         | 14,00,335    | 11\u00bd              |\n| 1879-80          | 88-15     |               | 1,015,941   | 13,81,074                      | 379          | 13,80,695    | 12\u00bd              |\n| 1880-81          | 95-36     |               | 1,016,703   | 13,78,254                      | 738          | 13,77,915    | 12\u00bd              |\n\n### Chapter VIII.\n#### Land Administration.\n##### Revenue Statistics.\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nJUSTICE.\n\nIn 1774, on the conquest of S\u00e1lsette, Karanja, Hog Island, and Elephanta, a resident and factors were appointed for S\u00e1lsette and Karanja, and a resident for Hog Island and Elephanta. The Government provided that 'the residents or chiefs should investigate all except capital offences and misdemeanours, through the means of two sensible and respectable men of each caste who were to be selected and appointed for the purpose.' Disputes regarding property were to be decided by arbitration. The arrangement continued till 1799, when an officer styled Judge and Magistrate with civil, criminal, and police jurisdiction was appointed in place of the residents and factors. The Judge had under him judicial officers styled native commissioners. In 1803 the jurisdiction of the Judge and Magistrate of Th\u00e1na was extended to B\u00e1nkot and its dependencies. In 1817, on the overthrow of the Peshwa, the districts of Bel\u00e1pur, \u00c1tgaon, and Kaly\u00e1n, and all territories to the north as far as the Daman river, lying between the Sahy\u00e1dris and the sea, were annexed to the zillah court of S\u00e1lsette whose title was changed into the zillah court of the Northern Konkan. The laws and regulations established for the administration of justice in Surat, Broach, and Kaira were declared to be in force in the district of the Northern Konkan. In 1818 the office of district Magistrate was transferred from the district Judge to the Collector. In 1819 the jurisdiction of the Judge of the North Konkan was extended south as far as the \u00c1pta river. In 1830, when three northern sub-divisions of Ratn\u00e1giri were placed under the control of the Th\u00e1na district Judge, Ratn\u00e1giri was for purposes of civil and criminal justice, reduced to a detached station of the Th\u00e1na district with a senior assistant and sessions judge. Ratn\u00e1giri remained a detached station under Th\u00e1na till 1869.\n\nIn 1828, the earliest year for which records are available, of 8032 cases filed 7910 were original and 122 were appeals. Of 8032 cases, 6399 original suits and fifty appeals were disposed of, leaving at the end of the year 1583 cases undecided. The total value of the suits decided was \u00a330,033 (Rs. 3,00,330) or an average of \u00a34 12s. (Rs. 46).\n\n1 An account of the Portuguese administration of justices is given above, page 459.\n2 Reg. III, of 1799 section 3, and Reg. V, of 1799 section 2.\n3 The designation native commissioner was abolished by Act XXIV, of 1836. In its stead three grades were appointed, principal sadar amin, sadar amin, and munsif.\n4 Reg. III, of 1803 sec. 2.\n5 Reg. VI, of 1817 sec. 2.\n6 Reg. III, of 1819 sec. 9.\nIn 1850 there were ten civil courts and 5694 suits disposed of, the average duration of each suit being one month and twenty-five days. Ten years later (1860) the number of courts remained the same, but the number of suits fell to 5574 and the average duration rose to two months and five days. In 1870 the number of courts was reduced to nine, the number of suits had risen to 8399, and the average duration to three months and eighteen days. At present (1881), excluding the first class subordinate judge of N\u00e1sik, who exercises special jurisdiction above \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), there are eight judges. Of these the District Judge is the chief with original civil jurisdiction in cases in which Government or Government servants are parties and with power to hear appeals, except in cases valued above \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000) when the appeal lies direct to the High Court. The assistant judge tries original cases below \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) and hears such appeals as are transferred to him by the District Judge. There are six second class subordinate judges, who have power to try original cases of not more than \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000). They are stationed at Th\u00e1na, Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwandi, Murb\u00e1d, Panvel, and Bassein and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu. The Bassein and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu subordinate judge holds his court for six months from November till January and from June till August at Bassein, and for five months from February till April and in September and October at D\u00e1h\u00e1nu. The subordinate judges have an average charge of about 700 square miles with 150,000 people.\n\nThe average distance of the Th\u00e1na subordinate judge's court from its six furthest villages is fifteen miles; of the Kaly\u00e1n court thirty-four miles; of the Murb\u00e1d court twenty miles; of the Panvel court twenty-six miles; and of the Bassein and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu courts, thirty-two miles in Bassein and forty in D\u00e1h\u00e1nu.\n\nExclusive of suits decided by the first class subordinate judge of N\u00e1sik who exercises special jurisdiction in cases valued at more than \u00a3500 (Rs. 5000), the average number of cases decided during the twelve years ending 1881 is 7166. Except in 1873 when there was a considerable increase, the number of suits has of late years fallen from 8399 in 1870 to 5737 in 1880. In 1881 there was an increase to 7152. Of the whole number of decisions during the twelve years ending 1881, 43\u00b771 per cent have, on an average, been given against the defendant in his absence. During the first five years the proportion of cases decided in the defendant's absence fell gradually from 54\u00b720 in 1870 to 43\u00b774 in 1874. It rose slightly (44\u00b71) in 1875 and has since, except in 1880 when there was a slight rise, continued to fall to 34\u00b77 in 1881. Of contested cases 16\u00b704 per cent during the twelve years ending 1881, have been decided for the defendant, the proportion varying from 19 in 1874 and 1877 to 11 in 1878 and\n\n| Year | Suits | Decided | Percentage |\n|------|-------|---------|------------|\n| 1870 | 8399  | 4553    | 54\u00b720      |\n| 1871 | 8254  | 4378    | 52\u00b778      |\n| 1872 | 8050  | 4237    | 52\u00b763      |\n| 1873 | 8781  | 4220    | 48\u00b724      |\n| 1874 | 7488  | 3681    | 49\u00b724      |\n| 1875 | 6954  | 3068    | 44\u00b710      |\n| 1876 | 7034  | 3763    | 53\u00b720      |\n| 1877 | 6564  | 2440    | 37\u00b710      |\n| 1878 | 5276  | 1877    | 35\u00b750      |\n| 1879 | 5393  | 2061    | 38\u00b740      |\n| 1880 | 5717  | 2002    | 35\u00b740      |\n| 1881 | 7152  | 2488    | 34\u00b770      |\n| Total| 85,992| 37,590  | 43\u00b771      |\nChapter IX.\n\nJustice.\n\nCivil Suits, 1870-1881.\n\n1879. In 191 or 2\u00b767 per cent of the suits decided in 1881 the decree was executed by putting the plaintiff in possession of the immovable property claimed. This class of cases fell from 189 out of 3899 in 1870 to 182 out of 5276 in 1878. In 1879 it rose to 269 out of 5893 and fell to 191 out of 7152 in 1881.\n\nIn 20\u00b781 per cent of the 1881 decisions decrees for money due were executed by the attachment or sale of property. Of these 11\u00b746 per cent were by the sale of movable property and 9\u00b731 per cent by the sale of immovable property. Compared with 1870 the 1881 returns show a fall in the attachments or sales of movable property from 1760 to 823 and from 1626 to 666 in the attachments or sales of immovable property. The number of decrees executed by the arrest of debtors during the twelve years ending 1881 has fallen from 619 in 1870 to 187 in 1881. The following table shows that during the same twelve years (1870-1881) the number of civil prisoners, with a slight rise in 1873 and again in 1877, fell from 168 in 1870 to 66 in 1878. It rose to 82 in 1879 and 89 in 1880, and in 1881 again fell to 75:\n\nThana Civil Prisoners, 1870-1881.\n\n| Year | Prisoners | Days | Release |\n|------|-----------|------|---------|\n|      |           |      | By satisfying the decree. | At creditors' request. | No subsistence allowance. | Disclosure of property. | Time expiry. |\n| 1870 | 168       | 52   | 7       | 36     | 96    | 11    | 18 |\n| 1871 | 155       | 44   | 13      | 33     | 82    | 11    | 16 |\n| 1872 | 95        | 47   | 2       | 21     | 63    | 5     | 4 |\n| 1873 | 106       | 34   | 2       | 28     | 62    | 2     | 11 |\n| 1874 | 91        | 31   | 2       | 13     | 53    | 6     | 8 |\n| 1875 | 73        | 38   | 7       | 18     | 38    | 5     | 3 |\n| 1876 | 70        | 27   | 6       | 24     | 35    | 2     | 3 |\n| 1877 | 74        | 43   | 3       | 13     | 44    | 1     | 13 |\n| 1878 | 66        | 51   | 2       | 10     | 25    | ...   | 20 |\n| 1879 | 62        | 30   | 4       | 10     | 46    | 4     | 18 |\n| 1880 | 59        | 34   | 3       | 33     | 48    | 3     | 2 |\n| 1881 | 75        | 32   | ...     | 24     | 46    | ...   | 5 |\n\nThe following statement shows the working of the district civil courts during the twelve years ending 1881:\n\nThana Civil Courts, 1870-1881.\n\n| Year | Suite disposed of | Average value in Rs. | UNCONTESTED | CONTESTED | EXECUTION OF DECREE |\n|------|------------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|---------------------|\n|      |                  |                      | DECREES     | JUDGMENT FOR PLAINTIFF | ARREST OF DEBTOR | DECREE HOLDER PUT IN POSSESSION OF IMMOVABLE PROPERTY | ATTACHMENT OR SALE OF PROPERTY |\n|      |                  |                      | DISMISSED | JUDGMENT FOR DEFENDANT | MIXED | IMMovable | MOVable |\n| 1870 | 8939             | 9\u00b74                 | 4558       | 81068     | 932   | 8591     | 1208   | 831    | 271   | 1806   | 619   | 159    | 1439   | 1750   |\n| 1871 | 8284             | 10\u00b79                | 4378       | 191391    | 915   | 8591     | 1213   | 291    | 194   | 1593   | 447   | 178    | 1746   | 1856   |\n| 1872 | 8050             | 12\u00b72                | 4237       | 110110    | 6544  | 1070     | 964    | 189   | 1506  | 501   | 173    | 1478   | 1650   |\n| 1873 | 8781             | 17\u00b70                | 4220       | 831716    | 1158  | 1217     | 1165   | 261   | 228   | 1654   | 204   | 182    | 2828   | 2401   |\n| 1874 | 7868             | 12\u00b78                | 3442       | 421600    | 1123  | 6218     | 1095   | 316   | 244   | 1655   | 178   | 182    | 2456   | 2221   |\n| 1875 | 8954             | 9\u00b78                 | 3068       | 123144    | 818   | 5459     | 1157   | 249   | 96    | 1502   | 161   | 126    | 1804   | 1664   |\n| 1876 | 7084             | 12\u00b72                | 3063       | 301413    | 5413  | 3413     | 1157   | 249   | 96    | 1502   | 161   | 126    | 1804   | 1664   |\n| 1877 | 7084             | 12\u00b72                | 3063       | 301413    | 5413  | 3413     | 1157   | 249   | 96    | 1502   | 161   | 126    | 1804   | 1664   |\n| 1878 | 5278             | 9\u00b712                | 1877       | 1431088   | 561   | 8639     | 1839   | 196   | 102   | 1637   | 88    | 192    | 1359   | 1809   |\n| 1879 | 5939             | 8\u00b730                | 2039       | 1771058   | 818   | 4090     | 1491   | 216   | 96    | 1803   | 88    | 289    | 1135   | 1279   |\n| 1880 | 5737             | 8\u00b730                | 2092       | 1281917   | 812   | 5049     | 1414   | 225   | 188   | 1788   | 189   | 147    | 1434   | 1171   |\n| 1881 | 7152             | 8\u00b700                | 2436       | 1741431   | 908   | 4994     | 1977   | 317   | 364   | 2168   | 187   | 191    | 666    | 823    |\nThere are no arbitration courts in the district. Mr., now Sir W. Wedderburn, Bart., C. S., when acting Judge of Th\u00e1na in 1876, proposed to establish an arbitration court, and held a meeting of the chief residents to consult their wishes. The Government pleader and several members of the community were appointed a committee to frame rules for the guidance of the proposed court. After Sir W. Wedderburn left the district nothing further seems to have been done.\n\nUnder the registration department there were till April 1882 thirteen sub-registrars, eight of whom were special officers and five were the head clerks of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs or mah\u00e1lkaris. The offices which were managed by m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs' head-clerks were Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, V\u00e1da, Murb\u00e1d, and Umbargaon. Since April 1882, instead of m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1rs' head clerks special officers have been appointed. In addition to the supervision of the Collector as District Registrar, these officers are subject to the special scrutiny of an inspector of registration under the control of the Inspector General of Registration and Stamps. According to the registration report for 1880-81, the registration receipts for the year amounted to \u00a31280 (Rs. 12,800) and the charges to \u00a3942 (Rs. 9420), leaving a net income of \u00a3338 (Rs. 3380). Of the total number of registrations during the year, nine were wills, 4533 were deeds relating to immovable property, and 113 were deeds relating to movable property. Of the 4533 documents relating to immovable property, 2121 were deeds of sale, thirty-three were deeds of gift, 1787 were mortgage deeds, 464 were leases, and 128 were miscellaneous deeds. The total value of property affected by registration was \u00a3178,557 (Rs. 17,85,570), \u00a3140,510 (Rs. 14,05,100) of which were the value of the immovable and \u00a338,047 (Rs. 3,80,470) the value of the movable property registered.\n\nAt present (1882) thirty-five officers share the administration of criminal justice. Of these, one is the District Magistrate, four are magistrates of the first class, thirteen of the second class, and seventeen of the third class. Of the magistrates of the first class, three are covenanted European civilians; and two the huzur and the district deputy collectors are natives of India. The District Magistrate has the general supervision of the whole district, while each of the first class magistrates, as assistant or deputy collector, has the charge of an average area of 1333 square miles and 284,350 people. The huzur deputy collector, unlike other magistrates, has no revenue charge, but exercises the powers of a first class magistrate in the sub-division of S\u00e1lsette, an extent of 241 square miles with a population of 107,219. He also hears cases which arise on the Peninsula railway between Kurla and Badlapur. Unlike other first class magistrates, the huzur deputy collector has not power to hear appeals. In 1881 the District Magistrate decided twenty-two original and appeal cases, and the other first class magistrates 452 original and appeal cases. Except the Superintendent of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n Hill, who is an European medical officer, the thirty second and third class magistrates are natives of India. The average charge of the eleven second and third class magistrates, who are also\nm\u00e9latd\u00e1rs or mah\u00e1lkaris, is 385 square miles with a population of 82,595. In 1881 these magistrates decided 5869 original criminal cases. At Kurla there is at present an honorary magistrate with third class powers.\n\nTo decide petty cases of assault and other minor offences, 2108 village headmen, under section 14 of the Bombay Village Police Act, have power to confine offenders for twenty-four hours in the village lock-up. The average yearly emoluments of these village magistrates in cash, land, and palm-trees amount to about \u00a32 8s. (Rs. 24).\n\nThe rugged nature of the country and the wild character of the Sahy\u00e1dri Kolis have made the district of Th\u00e1na liable to outbursts of dacoity and gang robbery. For about twenty years after the beginning of British rule (1818-1840) security of life and property was imperfectly established. Since 1840 there have been three periods marked by an excessive number of gang robberies, R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngria's disturbances between 1844 and 1848; Honia N\u00e1ik's between 1874 and 1876; and V\u00e1sudev Phadke's between 1877 and 1879. Besides these disturbances caused by gangs of hill robbers, there has been an unruly element along the sea coast, the remains of the old pirates against whom the coast was formerly protected by lines of small forts. These pirate raids on coast villages were most numerous between 1829 and 1837.\n\nAt the beginning of British rule the hill Kolis and R\u00e1mshis of Th\u00e1na, Ahmadnagar, and N\u00e1sik, led by Devb\u00e1r\u00e1v Dalvi, Kond\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik, Um\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik, Bharg\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik, and R\u00e1mji Kirva, caused such mischief and terror, that a reward of \u00a33 (Rs. 50) was offered for the capture of every armed man and of \u00a310 (Rs. 100) for the capture of every leader.\u00b9 The Collector proposed to grant R\u00e1mji Kirva a sum as blackmail to ensure freedom from Koli raids, but the proposal was not approved.\u00b2 In 1820 Devb\u00e1r\u00e1v appeared at the head of a band of armed men in Panvel, and sent round a small bundle of hay and charcoal in token that he meant to burn and lay waste the country. He was bold enough to send a parcel of his symbols to the m\u00e9latd\u00e1r's office. The m\u00e9latd\u00e1r at once sent out a body of armed peons who divided into parties. After searching the woods for a day and a night, one of the parties came across Devb\u00e1r\u00e1v and his gang, and in the scuffle Devb\u00e1r\u00e1v was shot and his body brought to Th\u00e1na. During the six years ending 1825, the number of gang robberies varied from 147 in 1824 to thirty-two in 1821 and averaged eighty. The number of persons implicated varied from 1094 in 1825 to 132 in 1820, and the number of persons arrested varied from 112 in 1821 to twenty-eight in 1825.\u00b3 In 1827\n\n\u00b9 Inward Register (1817), 153. In 1820 the reward for the capture of a leading robber was raised to \u00a315 (Rs. 150). Collector to Government, 20th June 1820.\n\u00b2 Mr. W. B. Mulock's Extracts from Th\u00e1na Records.\n\u00b3 Outward Register (1826), 451. In 1820 there were 47 robberies, 132 robbers, and 41 arrests; in 1821, 32 robberies, 193 robbers, and 112 arrests; in 1822, 76 robberies, 733 robbers, and 73 arrests; in 1823, 81 robberies, 807 robbers, and 72 arrests; in 1824, 147 robberies, 204 robbers, and 80 arrests; and in 1825, 100 robberies, 1094 robbers, and 28 arrests.\na band of R\u00e1moshis, who then infested the Purandhar hills in Poona, under one Um\u00e1ji, crossed the Sahy\u00e1dris with horses, tents, and 300 men, and camped at the foot of Prabal hill about twelve miles east of Panvel. From Prabal they sent a proclamation, calling on the people to pay their rents to them not to Government, and distributing bundles of straw, charcoal, and fuel in sign of the ruin which would follow if rents were not paid to them. On the 10th of December a gang of about 200 men, armed with fire-arms and other offensive weapons, attacked the Murb\u00e1d treasury, beat and wounded the guard, and carried off between \u00a31200 and \u00a31300 (Rs. 12,000-Rs. 13,000) of treasure. In 1828 and 1829 disturbances were still more general. The Ahmadnagar Kolis, who heard that the demands of the Purandhar R\u00e1moshis were granted, formed into large bands, and coming down the Sahy\u00e1dri passes, caused much loss and suffering in Th\u00e1na. These Koli disturbances have been noticed in the History Chapter. Captain Mackintosh was appointed to put down the disorders, and after very severe labour was successful in 1834. Even after these gangs were suppressed, so unsettled were the rugged inland tracts, that in 1836 the people of Nasr\u00e1pur were afraid to roof their houses with tiles or to show any signs of being well-to-do.\n\nBesides from hill robbers Th\u00e1na suffered at this time from raids of sea robbers. At Shirgaon in M\u00e1him, on the night of the 9th March 1829, a gang of seventy-five to a hundred men, armed with clubs and swords, landed from a boat and plundered the p\u00e1t\u00edl's house. On their way back they were met by the police, and after wounding two constables, made good their escape. In 1834-35 in Uran and S\u00e1lsette in fourteen robberies one person was killed, fourteen were wounded, and property valued at \u00a32238 (Rs. 22,380) was carried off. In 1836 four robberies, two by landmen and two by seamen, were committed by gangs of more than thirty men. The coast robbers landed from boats and entered villages in disguise. They sent out spies to discover the most profitable houses to attack, and carried out their plans with such skill and vigilance that they generally succeeded in making off in their boats before the police could arrive. In 1837 three raids were made on coast villages by gangs of about twenty-five pirates, Cutchis, Khoj\u00e1s from Bombay, and some Th\u00e1na Kolis. In 1839 there were no inroads of large gangs of hill robbers, but numbers of small bands committed as many as ten robberies a month.\n\n---\n\n1 The proclamation ran: 'Know all men that we R\u00e1jeshri Um\u00e1ji N\u00e1ik and Bharg\u00e9ji N\u00e1ik from our camp at the fort of Purandhar do hereby give notice in the year Sursam Suma Ashrin Maig\u00fat\u00e1n Va alaf 1827 to all P\u00e1t\u00eds, Mh\u00e1rs, and others of the villages of Ratn\u00e1giri in South Konkan and S\u00e1lsette in North Konkan, that they are not to pay any portion of the revenue to the British Government, and that any instance of disobedience to this mandate shall be punished by fire and sword. All revenues are to be paid to us. This proclamation is sent to you that you may make and keep a copy of it and act according to it without any demurring on pain of having your village razed to the ground.' Given under our hand this 25th December 1827.\n\n2 Magistrate to Government, 519 of 15th December 1827.\n\n3 Second Assistant Collector, 26th June 1836.\n\n4 Collector's Letter, 10th March 1829.\n\n5 Magistrate's Report, 13th Novr. 1837.\n\n6 Magistrate's Report, 4th April 1839.\nIn 1844 began the disorders, of which R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngria was the head. There was an increase in the number of gang robberies while the detections and recoveries of stolen property were extremely small. Much valuable merchandise, especially opium, passed along the \u00c1gra road, and the wild nature of the country and the neighbourhood of the Jawh\u00e1r and Dharampur territories made detection and punishment difficult and uncommon. The road from Bhiwndi to the foot of the Tal pass was infested by organized gangs of as many as two hundred robbers, with a proportion of well-mounted horsemen. In December 1843 three opium robberies were committed, and opium to the value of \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000) was carried off. In the beginning of January 1844 there were two more opium robberies one of eight the other of forty-three chests. Cloth-dealers and other merchants were plundered, officers' baggage was cut off, and the post was stopped. No travellers were allowed to pass without a permit from the robbers and the road-side villages were deserted. Even in Bhiwndi, where there was a detachment of the Native Veteran Battalion, the terror was so great that the people shut themselves in their houses. The cotton and opium carriers who were camped in the town were attacked and the troops had to be called out. In January 1844 the police along the \u00c1gra road were strengthened, and fifty of the Poona Irregular Horse were placed temporarily at the disposal of the District Magistrate to protect the traffic. The leading spirit among the freebooters was a Koli named R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngria, the son of a robber chief who had once been an officer in the police. In October 1843, at the head of a large gang, R\u00e1ghoji came down the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and committed several robberies. The hill police acted against him with great vigour, and though R\u00e1ghoji escaped, many of his leading men were caught and the strength of his gang was much reduced. In 1845 R\u00e1ghoji again appeared burning villages in Panvel, and spread the greatest terror by killing two village headmen who were known to have helped the police. A reward of \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) was offered for R\u00e1ghoji's arrest, and a special party of police under Captain Giberne was detached in their pursuit. So active and unceasing were the efforts of the police, that, before the year was over, four of his leading men J\u00e1vji N\u00e1ik, Padu Nirmal, Lakshman Pil\u00e1ji B\u00e1nde, and B\u00e1pu Bh\u00e1ngria were captured. R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngria, the head of the insurrection, alone remained at large, and in spite of all efforts he continued uncaptured till January 1848. At the close of December 1847, the late General Gell, then lieutenant and adjutant of the Gh\u00e1t Light Infantry, heard that R\u00e1ghoji had left the hills and was making for Pandharpur, the great Deccan place of worship. Mr. Gell started with a party of his men, and, after marching eighty-two miles in thirty-two hours, reached Kad-Kumbe about\n\n---\n\n1 This account is compiled from a letter from the commandant of the detachment of the Native Veteran Battalion, Bhiwndi, 5th January 1844; Civil Surgeon of N\u00e1sik to Collector of Th\u00e1na, 18th January 1844; Mr. Davidson to Commandant 23rd Regt.

In the evening they marched on to Pandharpur, and Mr. Gell entered the town about dawn dressed as a native. Spies were sent out to see if R\u00e1ghoji\u2019s party had come, and about ten o\u2019clock brought word that they were close to the town. Mr. Gell rode with a few of his men to an open space on the bank of the Bhima. Here one of a number of groups, who were coming and going to the river, was pointed out as R\u00e1ghoji\u2019s party. Mr. Gell rode to the men and stopped them. None of them tried to escape, and when Mr. Gell\u2019s men came up, R\u00e1mji, the lance n\u00e1ik, threw his arms round a small slight man in the dress of a Gos\u00e1i, calling out that he was R\u00e1ghoji. The others were recognised as members of R\u00e1ghoji\u2019s gang, and the Gos\u00e1i confessed that he was R\u00e1ghoji Bh\u00e1ngria. R\u00e1ghoji was tried by a special commissioner on a charge of treason and sentenced to death on the 13th of April 1848.\n\nThe statement in the margin shows that, during the five years ending 1848, gang robberies fell from 198 to 45.\n\nDuring the two years ending 1876 the district was much disturbed by gang robberies, organized by one Honia Bh\u00e1goji Kenglia, a Koli of Jamburi in Poona. Honia\u2019s robberies extended over the western parts of Poona, N\u00e1sik, and Ahmadnagar. They became so numerous and daring, that, in 1874, a special police party of 175 armed men under Colonel Scott and Mr. W. F. Sinclair, C.S., was detached for his arrest, proclamations were issued offering rewards of \u00a3100 (Rs. 1000) for Honia and of \u00a320 to \u00a360 (Rs. 200-Rs. 600) for his followers, and military guards were set over the Bassein, Kaly\u00e1n, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, Bhiwndi and Murb\u00e1d treasuries. In spite of these special measures Honia managed to evade pursuit in Th\u00e1na, Ahmednagar and Poona till, in July 1876, he and most of his leading men were captured by Major H. Daniell. Honia was tried in Poona and sentenced to transportation for life.\n\nThe increase of gang robbery in the Deccan, which followed the famine of 1876 and 1877, spread to Th\u00e1na. Bands of Kolis and R\u00e1moshis came down the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds, and committed serious robberies. The attempt of the Br\u00e1hman intriguer V\u00e1sudev Balvant Phadke, to turn these robbers into insurgents, added to the difficulties of the time. Military guards were set over the Karjat, Murb\u00e1d, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, V\u00e1da, Kaly\u00e1n and Bhiwndi treasuries, and bodies of police were organized under chosen European officers. When V\u00e1sudev Phadke left his gang in April 1879, one Daulata R\u00e1moshi became their leader. After plundering some villages in the Sirur sub-division of Poona, the gang descended the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds by the Kusur pass. On the 10th of May (1879), between seven and eleven at night, from thirty to forty men of this gang, armed with swords, sticks, and pistols, appeared at the village of Neri about three miles east of Panvel, wounded five men, and carried away\nproperty valued at \u00a3607 (Rs. 6070). At midnight the dacoits came to the village of Palaspe, wounded three men, and took away property valued at \u00a36000 (Rs. 60,000). On the return of the gang to the Deccan, Major Daniell pursued it, killed several men among them the leader Daulata, and recovered the greater portion of the property taken from Palaspe. The fortunate dispersion of this band of robbers and the loss of their chief prevented the repetition of any robbery on so large a scale. V\u00e1sudev Phadke's attempts to organize an insurrection were unable to make head against the activity of the police in Poona and S\u00e1t\u00e1r\u00e1, and the risk of any serious outbreak ceased with the brilliant pursuit and capture of V\u00e1sudev by Major Daniell in July 1879.\n\nOf minor forms of gang robbery, the commonest are waylaying and robbing travellers, and housebreaking which is seldom accompanied by violence. The practice of poisoning travellers by sweetmeats mixed with thorn-apple, dhota, Datura hummatu, and then robbing is not uncommon. Cases of assaulting creditors and burning their houses sometimes occur, but they are unusual. Except some settlements of K\u00e1thkaris, who are much given to petty pilfering, there are no criminal classes; nor is there any crime to which the upper classes are specially addicted. Drunkenness was until lately one of the chief causes of crime. The wild character of most of the district and the neighbourhood of the Portuguese territory of Daman, and of the states of Jawh\u00e1r and Dharampur, are the chief special difficulties in the way of bringing offenders to justice.\n\nIn 1880, the total strength of the district or regular police force was 842. This included the District Superintendent, two subordinate officers, 150 inferior officers, and 689 foot constables. The cost of maintaining this force was, for the Superintendent a yearly salary of \u00a3780 (Rs. 7800); for the two subordinate officers yearly salaries of not less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200); and for the 150 inferior subordinate officers yearly salaries of less than \u00a3120 (Rs. 1200), a total yearly cost of \u00a33832 8s. (Rs. 38,324); the 689 foot constables cost altogether a yearly sum of \u00a36680 16s. (Rs. 66,808), representing a yearly average salary to each constable of \u00a39 14s. (Rs. 97). Besides his pay, a total sum of \u00a3241 16s. (Rs. 2418) was yearly granted for the horse and travelling allowance of the Superintendent; \u00a3219 4s. (Rs. 2192) for the pay and allowance of his establishment; and \u00a3637 2s. (Rs. 6371) for contingencies and other petty charges. Thus the total yearly cost of maintaining the police force amounted in 1880 to \u00a312,391 6s. (Rs. 1,23,913). On an area of 4242 square miles and a population of 900,271, these figures give one man for about every five miles and about 1000 people. The cost of the force is \u00a32 18s. 6d. (Rs. 29-4) the square mile, or a little over 3\u00bdd. (2 as. 4 pies) a head of the population. Exclusive of the Superintendent, 358 were provided with fire-arms and 483 with swords or swords and batons. Besides the Superintendent, 111, fifty-one of them officers and sixty constables, could read and write.\n\nThe Superintendent was an European and the rest were natives\nof India. Of these one officer and one man were Christians; thirteen officers and thirty men Musalm\u00e1ns; eleven officers and seventeen men Br\u00e1hmans; eighty-four officers and 469 men Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s; three officers and forty men Kolis; thirty-seven officers and 117 men Hindus of other castes; one officer was a P\u00e1rsi; and two constables were Jews and one was a Rajput.\n\nThe following statement, for the seven years ending 1880, shows a total of 120 murders, thirty-eight culpable homicides, 189 cases of grievous hurt, 460 dacoities and robberies, and 38,493 other offences. The number of murders varied from twenty-one in 1879 to twelve in 1880, and averaged sixteen; culpable homicides varied from one in 1874 to nine in 1877, and averaged about five; cases of grievous hurt varied from twenty-one in 1876 to thirty-four in 1879, and averaged twenty-seven; dacoities and robberies varied from twenty-five in 1875 to 145 in 1879, and averaged sixty-five; and other offences varied from 3265 in 1880 to 6834 in 1879, and averaged 5499. Of the whole number of persons arrested the convictions varied from 32\u00b709 in 1876 to 54\u00b73 in 1874, and averaged 39\u00b71. The percentage of stolen property recovered varied from 21\u00b71 in 1876 to 45\u00b71 in 1875, and averaged 36\u00b79. The following are the details:\n\n**Th\u00e1na Crime and Police, 1874-1880.**\n\n| Year | Murder and Attempt to Murder | Culpable Homicide | Grievous Hurt | Dacoities and Robberies |\n|------|-----------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|\n|      | Cases. | Arrests. | Convictions. | Percentage. | Cases. | Arrests. | Convictions. | Percentage. | Cases. | Arrests. | Convictions. | Percentage. |\n| 1874 | 16     | 32      | 13          | 40\u00b70%       | 1     | 1        | ...         | ...         | 33     | 69      | 62         | 89\u00b78%     |\n| 1875 | 18     | 38      | 21          | 63\u00b76%       | 3     | 7        | 2           | 28\u00b76%       | 22     | 68      | 38         | 66\u00b78%     |\n| 1876 | 15     | 38      | 14          | 36\u00b73%       | 6     | 26       | 5           | 23\u00b707%      | 21     | 51      | 30         | 60\u00b73%     |\n| 1877 | 20     | 42      | 22          | 52\u00b74%       | 9     | 15       | 8           | 57\u00b76%       | 100    | 49      | 60         | 96\u00b70%     |\n| 1878 | 20     | 42      | 17          | 40\u00b75%       | 6     | 8        | 7           | 87\u00b76%       | 25     | 63      | 92         | 42\u00b75%     |\n| 1879 | 21     | 36      | 14          | 40\u00b70%       | 6     | 6        | 4           | 66\u00b76%       | 34     | 65      | 39         | 60\u00b70%     |\n| 1880 | 12     | 15      | 12          | 80\u00b70%       | 7     | 9        | 6           | 66\u00b76%       | 24     | 56      | 20         | 25\u00b77%     |\n| Total| 120    | 230     | 108         | 44\u00b73%       | 38    | 72       | 30          | 41\u00b76%       | 189    | 444     | 240        | 54\u00b705%    |\n\n**Offences and Convictions\u2014continued.**\n\n| Year | Other Offences | Total | Property |\n|------|----------------|-------|----------|\n|      | Cases. | Arrests. | Convictions. | Percentage. | Cases. | Arrests. | Convictions. | Percentage. | Sholen. | Recovered. | Percentage. |\n| 1874 | 5825   | 6187   | 3324     | 53\u00b77%     | 6767   | 6542   | 3554     | 54\u00b780%     | 2670    | 1080      | 39\u00b77%     |\n| 1875 | 5827   | 9457   | 3664     | 38\u00b76%     | 5855   | 9627   | 3762     | 38\u00b790%     | 2817    | 1276      | 45\u00b71%     |\n| 1876 | 5802   | 10,875 | 3467     | 31\u00b78%     | 6881   | 11,055 | 5046     | 32\u00b709%     | 5190    | 1125      | 21\u00b71%     |\n| 1877 | 5716   | 11,350 | 4098     | 36\u00b77%     | 6825   | 11,722 | 4286     | 38\u00b760%     | 4997    | 1514      | 30\u00b75%     |\n| 1878 | 5964   | 11,059 | 4076     | 36\u00b73%     | 6940   | 11,840 | 4648     | 38\u00b706%     | 5012    | 1492      | 34\u00b78%     |\n| 1879 | 6334   | 11,573 | 4521     | 39\u00b77%     | 7040   | 11,940 | 4648     | 38\u00b706%     | 13,012  | 3492      | 44\u00b78%     |\n| 1880 | 3285   | 4985   | 2405     | 47\u00b703%    | 3359   | 6200   | 2520     | 47\u00b730%     | 4607    | 1556      | 33\u00b77%     |\n| Total| 38,493 | 65,496 | 25,396   | 38\u00b77%     | 39,300 | 67,414 | 26,446   | 39\u00b71%      | 39,287  | 14,600    | 36\u00b79%     |\nCorresponding details are available for the five years ending 1849:\n\n| Year | Murder | Homicide | Grievous hurt | Robbery | Arson | Miscellaneous | Total | Arrests | Convictions | Percentage | Property stolen | Property recovered | Percentage |\n|------|--------|----------|---------------|---------|-------|--------------|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|\n| 1845 | 92     | 1        | 51            | 201     | 31    | 7147         | 7459  | 19687   | 4955        | 38\u00b730       | 5228            | 876               | 7\u00b718        |\n| 1846 | 14     | 27       | 175           | 7704    | 7704  | 7938         | 13626 | 4096    | 36\u00b766       | ...         | ...             | ...               | ...         |\n| 1847 | 30     | 5        | 40            | 90      | 18    | 5994         | 9167  | 15745   | 5064        | 32\u00b716       | ...             | ...               | ...         |\n| 1848 | 22     | 3        | 76            | 78      | 22    | 9400         | 9239  | 16632   | 4849        | 29\u00b715       | 6559            | 956               | 17\u00b725       |\n| 1849 | 26     | 5        | 47            | 108     | 10    | 10203        | 10420 | 18866   | 5099        | 27\u00b776       | 9499            | 768               | 8\u00b703        |\n| Total| 104    | 22       | 241           | 850     | 110   | 43088        | 44215 | 77366   | 24963       | 32\u00b729       | ...             | ...               | ...         |\n\nDuring the five years ending 1849, of a population of 554,937 or about thirty-eight per cent less than in 1880, murders varied from fourteen to twenty-six and averaged twenty-one; homicides varied from one to eight and averaged four; grievous hurts varied from twenty-seven to seventy-six and averaged forty-eight; and robberies varied from seventy-six to 201 and averaged 130; arsons varied from eight to thirty-one and averaged twenty-two; and miscellaneous offences varied from 7147 to 10,203 and averaged 8617. The percentage of convictions on the number of arrests varied from 27\u00b776 to 38\u00b730 and averaged 32\u00b729. The returns of the recovery of property alleged to be stolen are incomplete; they are shown as varying from 7\u00b718 per cent in 1845 to 17\u00b725 per cent in 1848.\n\nA comparison of the two statements shows that the amount of crime in the five years ending 1849 was comparatively larger than in the seven years ending 1880. In the five years ending 1849 there was a yearly average of 8843 crimes, or, on the basis of the 1846 census, one crime to every sixty-three inhabitants. In the seven years ending 1880, there was an average of 5614 crimes a year, or, according to the 1881 census, one crime to every 161 inhabitants. A comparison of the yearly average of dacoities and robberies during these periods shows a fall from 130 in the first to sixty-six in the second period.\n\nBesides the lock-ups at each m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r's office, there is a central jail at Th\u00e1na. The number of convicts in the Th\u00e1na jail on the 31st December 1880 was 650, of which 570 were males and eighty females. Of these 210 males and twenty-seven females were sentenced for a term not exceeding one year; 224 males and thirty females were for terms above one year and not more than five years; and thirty-one males and nine females were for terms of between five and ten years. Eighteen males and four females were life prisoners, and eighty-seven males and ten females were under sentences of transportation. The convicts are employed in-doors in weaving cotton cloth and carpets and in wood and metal work. Out of doors they are employed in road-making, gardening, and quarrying. The daily average number of sick in the jail was 25\u00b76 among males, and four among females. The number of deaths during the year was four from fever and twenty-nine from bowel complaints. There was no cholera during the year. In 1880 diet cost \u00a32060 4s. (Rs. 20,602) or an average of \u00a32 16s. (Rs. 28) to each prisoner.\nCHAPTER X.\n\nREVENUE AND FINANCE.\n\nThe earliest available District Balance Sheet is for 1819-20. Though, since 1819-20, many changes have been made in the keeping of accounts, most of the items can be brought under corresponding heads in the forms now in use. Exclusive of \u00a315,027 (Rs. 1,50,270) the adjustment on account of alienated land, the total transactions entered in the district balance sheet for 1879-80 amounted under receipts to \u00a3422,276 (Rs. 42,22,760) against \u00a3198,422 (Rs. 19,84,220) in 1819-20, and under charges to \u00a3443,170 (Rs. 44,31,700) against \u00a3218,050 (Rs. 21,80,500). Leaving aside departmental miscellaneous receipts and payments in return for services rendered, such as post and telegraph receipts, the revenue for the year 1879-80 under all heads, Imperial, provincial, local, and municipal, came to \u00a3307,960 (Rs. 30,79,600), or on the 1881 population of 900,227 a charge of 6s. 10d. per head. As there are no population details for 1819-20, the share per head in that year cannot be given.\n\nDuring the sixty-one years between 1819 and 1880 the following changes have taken place under the chief heads of receipts and charges.\n\nLand receipts, forming 45\u00b789 per cent of the whole revenue, have risen from \u00a3135,255 (Rs. 13,52,550) in 1819-20 to \u00a3141,345 (Rs. 14,13,450) in 1879-80; land charges have actually increased, but, from a change in the heads of account to which they are debited, they show an apparent fall from \u00a329,247 to \u00a324,948 (Rs. 2,92,470 - Rs. 2,49,480).\n\nThe following statement shows the land revenue collected in each of the fifty years ending 1879-80:\n\n| Year | Land Revenue |\n|------|--------------|\n| 1830-31 | 105,845      |\n| 1831-32 | 106,485      |\n| 1832-33 | 107,125      |\n| 1833-34 | 107,765      |\n| 1834-35 | 108,405      |\n| 1835-36 | 109,045      |\n| 1836-37 | 109,685      |\n| 1837-38 | 110,325      |\n| 1838-39 | 110,965      |\n| 1839-40 | 111,605      |\n\n* Figures for the years 1830-31 to 1836-37 have been taken from statement No. 7 (after deducting those for Kolaba) in Mr. Bell's A'fikari Report, dated 1st October 1889; figures for the subsequent years have been taken from Statement A which accompanies the Collector's yearly Administration Reports. These figures are exclusive of alienated revenues which are mere items of adjustment by credit and debit.\n\nThis total is made of the following items: \u00a3246,123 land revenue, stamps, forest, excise, law and justice, and assessed taxes; \u00a31041 customs; \u00a322,500 salt; \u00a33302 registration, education, and police; and \u00a328,994 local and municipal funds; total \u00a3307,960.\n\nB 310\u201481\nStamp receipts have risen from \u00a32411 to \u00a316,379 (Rs. 24,110-Rs. 1,63,790), and stamp expenditure has fallen from \u00a3751 (Rs. 7510) in 1819-20 to \u00a3436 (Rs. 4360) in 1879-80.\n\nExcise receipts have risen from \u00a33867 to \u00a362,450 (Rs. 38,670-Rs. 6,24,500) and excise expenditure from \u00a3502 to \u00a31841 (Rs. 5020-Rs. 18,410). From very early times the coast districts of Th\u00e1na seem to have had a lavish supply of palm-liquor. An inscription of the second century after Christ mentions the grant of 32,000 cocoa-palms in the village of N\u00e1rgol (N\u00e1nagol) one mile north of Umbargaon, and in the fourteenth century the European traveller Jordanus (1320) notices the abundance and strength of the palm-liquor and the drunkenness of the people. In S\u00e1lsette the Portuguese levied bud-dene,\u00b9 a duty for leave to draw the juice of the palm: they farmed the right of selling palm and moha spirits; and they charged the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds a still-tax for the right of distilling and selling spirits in their houses. The Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, contrary to their usual practice, seem not to have forbidden the use of liquor, but to have levied a tree cess, a still cess, and a tavern cess. On the acquisition of S\u00e1lsette in 1774, the British Government continued the levy of the bud-dene on brab and date palms, but farmed the excise cess on the manufacture and sale of palm-spirit, combining it with the farm of the manufacture and sale of moha spirits. This combined monopoly raised the revenue; but the change was unpopular both with the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds and with Government. The spirit was not so pure as it used to be, and much more of it was drunk. In 1808 Government introduced the Bengal still system, under which the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds or distillers paid a fixed still rate under a license entitling the holder both to distil and sell palm-spirit. This system was continued till 1816, but without good results. In 1816-17 the Central or Sadar Distillery system was introduced. In certain suitable places a space was walled round, and the Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds were allowed to set up stills, paying a duty in S\u00e1lsette of 6d. (4 as.) on every gallon of spirits removed. This system was completely successful in preventing the illicit distilling and sale of spirits, and in bringing the use of liquor under control; but financially the result was unsatisfactory. During the nine years ending 1825-26 the excise revenue of S\u00e1lsette fell from \u00a37600 to \u00a34071 (Rs. 76,000-Rs. 40,710).\u00b2 The cause of this fall in revenue was the heavy cost of the staff, as each distillery had its superintendent and establishment, involving an expense, which in the opinion of Government, overbalanced the advantages of greater regularity in collecting the duty and of complete control. In other parts of the district where liquor-making was uncontrolled, except by a light direct tax, drunkenness was universal. In 1826 (30th September) Mr. Simson, the Collector, was so impressed with the hard drinking\n\n\u00b9 Bud-dene is the cess levied as assessment to land revenue on toddy-producing trees.

(8 as.) a gallon on spirits was imposed and the right of collecting it was farmed. The Bhand\u00e1ris resisted the levy by a general strike. The measure was withdrawn, and from 1829 the Bhand\u00e1ris were required to sell licensed spirits at a fixed price to the farmer, who alone was allowed to retail. In S\u00e1sette, Bassein, and M\u00e1him the farmer sublet his farm and the sub-farmer allowed the Bhand\u00e1ris to distil in their own houses and sell whatever they chose. So long as the Bhand\u00e1ri paid he was free to manufacture and sell as much as he could. In Sanj\u00e1n the farmer dealt directly with the Bhand\u00e1ris or Talv\u00e1dis, and taxed them at 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2.-Rs.3) according to the number of trees they undertook to tap. This tax was known as the tapping-knife or autband\u00ed cess.\u00b9 The payment of the tax entitled the palm-tapper or talv\u00e1di to set up a still and open a shop. A special duty was imposed of 1s. (8 as.) a gallon on all spirits brought within or sent beyond the limits of any farm, and levied according to agreement either by Government or by the farmer.\n\nIn 1833 Mr. Giberne, the Collector, reported to Government that in Bassein the farming system had failed, the Bhand\u00e1ris assaulted and harassed the farmer's agents and set fire to his warehouses. He recommended that certain concessions should be made in the Bhand\u00e1ris' favour. He advised that in Sanj\u00e1n the tapping-knife system should be recognised, and suggested that it should be worked by direct Government agency. Government recognised the tapping-knife cess in Sanj\u00e1n, but left it to be collected by the farmer. They approved of the grant of concessions to the Bassein Bhand\u00e1ris, directed the Collector to fix the price at which the Bhand\u00e1ris should sell to the farmer; permitted the free import of spirits inland from the coast; allowed the Bhand\u00e1ris to sell to the farmer of another division, if the local farmer declined to take their stock; forbade the distilling of moha where palm-spirit was made and drunk; affirmed the farmer's right to make sure that the distiller sold him all the spirit he distilled, and required the number and situation of the shops in a farm to be fixed. Notwithstanding these concessions, the Bassein Bhand\u00e1ris continued unruly and discontented, and complaints were heard from other parts of the district. Mr. Simson, the Collector, and his assistant Mr. Davies examined the Bhand\u00e1ris' complaints and urged Government to do away with the farming system in all parts of the districts where palm-spirit was used, to levy a consolidated tree tax which would include both the old stem cess and the excise or tapping cess, and to\n\n\u00b9Aut means a tool.

On this report Government ordered that farming should be discontinued at the end of the terms for which the existing farms were granted; that the Revenue Commissioners should draft rules legalising the levy of a tree tax fixed at a maximum of 6s. (Rs. 3) a tree; and that, pending the passing of such an Act, the Collector should control the manufacture and sale of spirits under the provisions of Regulation XXI. of 1827. The Collector arranged that the Bhand\u00e1ris should make spirits on their own account under the superintendence of a farmer of excise; that they should retail spirits within the farm limits on the payment to the farmer of an excise duty of 6d. (4 as.) a gallon of spirit or 1\u00bdd. (1 anna) a gallon of raw palm-juice; that they should sell spirits to the farmer without payment of excise; and that they should pay Government a yearly tree cess of 4s. (Rs. 2). Though they differed considerably from those contemplated by Government, and though the Bassein distillers alone agreed to them, Government sanctioned these proposals. They were introduced in 1836-37, and are the origin of the tapping or excise cess now levied on all tapped palm trees.\n\nIn 1837, to place the excise system on a better footing, Government appointed a committee consisting of Mr. Giberne as President and Messrs. Davies, Young, and Davidson as members. Towards the close of the year the committee reported that they were unable to propose any improvement on the farming system; they recommended that farming should be continued, that the number of shops should be restricted, that in certain places the making and selling of other than local spirits should be forbidden, that the number of Bhand\u00e1ris allowed to work stills should be limited, and that the free use of unfermented palm-juice should be allowed on paying the bud-dene cess. The committee also recommended that the new arrangements introduced into Bassein in 1836-37 should not be interfered with, as they had brought peace and order into what had been one of the most troublesome parts of the district. Government approved of the report, but the proposals were not carried out as the Imperial Government contemplated legislation. In 1844, owing to the peculiarities of the country and the temper of its people, Government sanctioned the continuance of the system introduced into Bassein in 1836-37, though they agreed with the Collector in condemning its principle and opposed its extension to other parts of the district. In 1845-46 and 1846-47, at the urgent request of the Collector, the Sanj\u00e1n tapping-knife tax was brought under direct Government management, but in 1847-48 the tax was again farmed.\n\nAct III. of 1852 legalised the levy of a tapping cess, and Government directed the Revenue Commissioners to frame rules for the guidance of Collectors in managing the excise revenue. The Commissioners submitted a report which is known as the \u00c1bk\u00e1ri Joint Report No. 6 of 1852, and in 1855 supplemented it by a second report, No. 2 of 6th January 1855. The Commissioners disapproved of the tapping-knife system, and advocated the universal adoption of farming. They proposed to forbid the distilling of spirits above a\ncertain strength, the removal of spirits from the distillery to the retail shop without a pass, the adulteration of spirits, the sub-letting of farms, the sale of more than one sher of spirits to any one person in one day, and the keeping of shops open after sunset. In their supplemental report the Commissioners discussed the question of fixing the amount of palm-juice that might be retailed to one person in a single day; they insisted on the farmer's keeping simple accounts for Government inspection; and, as they could not agree on the point, they left it for Government to decide whether the farms should be sold by shops or by divisions. Government decided that all liquor-shops in one sub-division should be farmed to one person. These orders were unsuited to the coast districts, and the district officers kept to the old system and in time gained the Commissioners' consent to that course. The land and excise assessments were so mixed that no proper system could be introduced, until the land had been surveyed and assessed. The old system continued with such changes as were practicable and were urgently required. In 1853, contrary to his license, the Sanj\u00e1n farmer was found to have opened extra shops for the sale of moha spirits. The farm of the tapping-knife cess was accordingly abolished, and in its stead direct Government management was introduced. In 1854 the system of direct management was extended to D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and Chinchni-T\u00e1r\u00e1pur.\n\nIn 1856 there were in S\u00e1lsette forty-one farms or saj\u00e1s of one to four villages. The number of shops was regulated according to the size of the villages. In M\u00e1khim the toddy-drawers made liquor in small rude stills, and sold it at a fixed price to the farmer, who retailed it at certain places according to the terms of his agreement. In other parts of the district each Bhand\u00e1ri had a still and a spirit-shop in his own house. Under this system the revenue was small and the temptation to drunkenness strong. Among the Panyel \u00c1gris, after eight at night there was scarcely a sober man in the village. In the same year the Bh\u00e1ndup and Uran distilleries were placed specially under the Commissioner of Customs, and the duty hitherto levied as customs was fixed at 1s. 1\u00bdd. (9 as.) the gallon. In 1861, in connection with a draft Opium Act prepared by Mr. Spooner, Government made an effort to put the excise system on a better footing. The Commissioners were desired to draft an excise bill, but, from press of work, they begged to be excused, and in 1864 Government entrusted the duty to a special commission. In 1865-66 the Survey Commissioner remodelled the tapping-knife system in Umbargaon. Meanwhile, in consequence of frequent changes among its members, the commission had failed to complete their Draft Excise Bill. In 1868 Mr. Bell, C. S., was entrusted with the work, and in the following year he submitted an elaborate report dated 1st October 1869. The report gave rise to a discussion, which lasted over several years without leading to any satisfactory conclusion.\n\nThe system that continued in force in Th\u00e1na was the levy of the bud-dene cess on palm-trees, the proceeds of which were credited\n\n---\n\n1 Gov. Sel. XCVI. 101-102; and Revenue Record, 199 of 1856, 1007.\nto land revenue. Except in a few cases, in which an extra or tapping cess was likewise levied, the payment of this tree-cess under certain conditions entitled the payers to draw and distil palm-juice without any further charge. The details of the arrangement varied greatly in different parts of the district. In Panvel the monopoly of the retail sale of palm and other country liquor was yearly sold by auction. The payers of the bud-dene cess were not allowed to distil, only to sell the palm-juice to the farmer who enjoyed the exclusive right of distilling. In Uran the bud-dene cess was paid by the person who held the distilling monopoly, and, as the survey occupants had refused to pay the bud-dene cess which in 1868 was fixed by the survey department on the palm trees in their holdings, the monopolist employed his own servants to tap the trees. In S\u00e1lsette, under a system introduced by Government Resolution 3550 of 14th October 1863, the monopoly of the retail sale of palm-juice and other country liquor was yearly sold by auction, and it was only to the monopolists that the payers of the bud-dene and tapping cesses could sell palm-juice. Payers of the bud-dene cess were allowed to draw, distil, and sell to the monopolist on payment of an additional or tapping cess at the rate of 4s. 3d. (Rs. 2-2-0) on each brab-palm, 3s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-10-6) on each cocoa-palm, and 1s. 0\u00bed. (8 as. 6 pies) on each date-palm. No tapping license was granted for fewer than fifteen, and no supplementary license for fewer than five trees. In Bassein and Ag\u00e1shi the bud-dene cess was compounded with an excise cess varying from 2s. 4\u00bdd. to 2s. 2\u00bdd. (Re. 1-2-11-Re. 1-1-6) on each cocoa and brab palm, and 8\u00bdd. (5 as. 9 pies) on each date-palm. Any one paying the compound rates for not less than fifteen trees could, on passing a stamped agreement, distil the palm-juice and open a shop in his own village for its sale. In the S\u00e1iv\u00e1n, K\u00e1man, and M\u00e1nikpur divisions of Bassein, and over the whole of M\u00e1him, the monopoly of the retail sale of palm and other country liquor was yearly sold by auction, and the payers of the bud-dene cess were allowed to draw, distil, and sell only to the monopolist. In the Umbargaon division of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu any landholder or any person owning trees enough to represent a tree-cess of \u00a31 (Rs. 10), or any other person willing to pay \u00a31 (Rs. 10), could on paying a further sum of 2s. (Re. 1) get a license to distil and sell liquor within the limits of his village. Persons who were unwilling to take out a distilling license could tap the trees and sell the juice to the holders of a distilling license, but not to others. In other parts of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu no distilling and selling license was given for less than sixteen brab-palms assessed at 4\u00bdd. and 6d. (3-4 as.), or for less than twenty-six brab-palms assessed at 3d. (2 as.), or for less than fifty-one date-palms, provided that the total assessment in each case was not less than \u00a31 (Rs. 10). To make up the required minimum number of date trees, brab-trees were added, one brab being counted equal to three date trees if assessed at 4\u00bdd. and 6d. (3-4 as.), or equal to two date trees if assessed at 3d. (2 as.). Any man could tap a cocoa-palm growing on his land, and distil the juice on paying a fee of 4s. 3d. (Rs. 2-2) on each tree and 2s. 1\u00bdd. (Re.1-1) for the license. Cocoa-palms on unoccupied lands were put to auction, and in addition to the sum bid at auction, the above rates\nwere levied. In the inland sub-divisions of Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwndi, Karjat, V\u00e1da, and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, there are few palm trees, and most of the liquor drunk is made from moha. The right to distil and retail moha liquor in certain tracts or groups of villages was yearly sold by auction. A tree-cess was levied on all palms tapped for liquor in this part of the district, but the payer was forbidden to sell the produce to any one but the liquor-farmer.\n\nThe only special excise staff was in S\u00e1lsette for collecting the tapping cess and preventing illicit tapping. This establishment, which was maintained at a yearly cost of \u00a3406 (Rs. 4060), included one inspector, nine sub-inspectors, and eleven peons. The result of this system was unsatisfactory. It was impossible to supervise the countless stills that were at work all over the district, and the abundance of spirit and the lowness of the excise made liquor so cheap that drunkenness was universal. In addition to these evils a marked increase of smuggling followed the enhanced excise rates which were introduced into the Town and Island of Bombay in 1874. The work of introducing a new excise system was entrusted to Mr. C. B. Pritchard, C.S., the Commissioner of Customs. Mr. Pritchard's recommendations were embodied in Act V. of 1878, and the new system was introduced from the 1st of January 1879. The mixed interests of the landholders and the Bhandaris, and the dislike of the consumers to a system which increased the price of liquor, made the carrying out of the desired reforms a task of much difficulty. But the energy, untiring efforts, and determined will of Messrs. A. C. Jervoise, C. S., and W. B. Mulock, C. S., the Collectors of Th\u00e1na, have enabled the Commissioner of \u00c1bk\u00e1ri to place the system on a sound and permanent footing.\u00b9\n\nThe main principles of the reform were, (1) to confine the manufacture of moha spirit to central distilleries and to collect the excise revenue by a still-head duty fixed according to the alcoholic strength of the liquor; and, (2) to introduce a tree tax on all tapped palm trees and to regulate the palm tax in places where palm juice was distilled so as to correspond with the still-head duty on moha and equalise the price of the two liquors. The next step was to separate the excise cess from the bud-dene cess, and to strip the bud-dene cess of the privilege of tapping, distilling, and sale. This was effected by fixing in addition to the old bud-dene cess a distinct excise tax on each tree tapped. As a temporary measure, and pending the introduction of a general rate of taxation after the enforcement of the Anglo-Portuguese treaty of 1879, the new excise tax was graduated on a scale falling from a highest rate in sub-divisions near Bombay to a lowest rate near the Portuguese settlement of Daman.\n\nIn 1882, except in the Umbargao petty division where it was 3s. (Rs. 1\u00bd), the still-head duty on every gallon of moha liquor of 25\u00b0 under proof was fixed at 3s. 6d. (Rs. 1\u00bc). The following statement gives the 1882-83 rates of the excise cess on palm trees:\n\n\u00b9 Commissioner's Report 1821, 25th March 1881.\nThe chief remaining provisions of the new system were: (1) The dividing of the district into three ranges, the north-coast range including Bassein, M\u00e1him, and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, the south coast range including S\u00e1lsette and Panvel, and the inland range including Sh\u00e1hapur, V\u00e1da, Murb\u00e1d, Bh\u00edwandi, Kaly\u00e1n, and Karjat. Each range was placed under an European inspector with a staff of sub-inspectors and excise police; (2), the buying of all rights under which landholders were free from the payment of excise taxation; (3), and the leasing for \u00a33200 (Rs. 32,000) a year of the excise rights of the Jawh\u00e1r state.\n\nIn 1878-79 the right to retail palm and other country liquor in S\u00e1lsette and Panvel was farmed. The farmer was required to bring all the moha liquor he required from the Uran distilleries and pay the still-head duty in addition to the amount of his farm, and to buy his palm-juice from licensed tappers, who were forbidden to sell the produce to any one but the farmer. The Bhand\u00e1ris strongly opposed the increased tree-cess, and, in 1878-79, no palm trees were tapped in Bassein and very few in M\u00e1him and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu. The few Bhand\u00e1ris who took out tapping licenses in M\u00e1him and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, were allowed to distil. The D\u00e1h\u00e1nu tappers were also allowed to open palm and other country spirit shops, while the M\u00e1him tappers were required to sell all their produce to the liquor farmer. The liquor contracts were given separately for each sub-division, and the farmers were allowed to make and sell moha spirit on paying the regular still-head duty.\n\nIn the six remaining inland sub-divisions, where there are few palm trees, the distilling of palm-juice was stopped, but any person wishing to tap was given a license on paying the tree-tax. The license entitled the tapper to sell palm-juice in its raw state. In 1878-79 the right to retail moha spirit was farmed for three years, the farmer being forced to bring all the liquor from the Uran distilleries under passes granted by a supervisor straight to a central store at Kaly\u00e1n. The inspector in charge of the Kaly\u00e1n store kept an account of the liquor received and distributed.\n\nIn 1879-80 a single farm system was introduced for Bassein, M\u00e1him, and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, and in 1880-81 for S\u00e1lsette and Panvel. Under this system the two groups of sub-divisions were farmed together, the farmer guaranteeing a certain minimum payment for the year for the tree-tax on trees to be tapped, for still-head duty on moha liquor to be sold by him, and for the privilege of opening shops and\nselling liquor. If the amount due on account of the tree-tax on the trees tapped and the amount due on account of still-head duty on the moha sold exceeded the minimum sums guaranteed, the farmer was bound to make good the excess. The farmer for S\u00e1lssette and Panvel was prohibited from distilling moha, and was required to bring it from the Uran distilleries. By the single farm system indiscriminate tapping, selling, and distilling by Bhand\u00e1ris were stopped, and greater security was obtained for the realization of Government demands by the substitution of a single contractor employing his own men to draw and distil palm-juice in place of a number of separate tappers each directly answerable to Government for the petty sums due by him.\n\nUnder Act V. of 1878 the sale of foreign liquor, including beer, porter and all other intoxicating foreign drinks, was forbidden without a license of \u00a35 6s. 3d. (Rs. 53-2) for shops authorised to sell by the pint and of \u00a310 12s. 6d. (Rs. 106-4) for shops authorised to sell either by the pint or by the glass. In 1879-80 the license fees under this head realised \u00a3324 (Rs. 3240) against an average of \u00a3109 (Rs. 1090) in the five years ending 1876-77.\n\nIn 1878-79, when the new tree-tax and still-head duties were introduced, additional establishments were entertained and paid partly from the liquor farmer's contributions and partly from provincial funds. On the 1st of August 1879 the establishment was remodelled and fixed at the following strength: Three European inspectors on a monthly pay varying from \u00a315 to \u00a325 (Rs. 150 - Rs. 250), thirty-six sub-inspectors on a monthly pay varying from \u00a31 10s. to \u00a37 (Rs. 15 - Rs. 70), six head constables on a monthly pay varying from \u00a31 4s. to \u00a32 (Rs. 12 - Rs. 20), and ninety-six constables on a monthly pay of 16s. (Rs. 8) each, that is a total yearly charge of \u00a32853 (Rs. 28,530).\n\nThese changes have largely enhanced the price of liquor. Formerly a man could get drunk for 1\u00bdd. (1 anna), now it costs him at least 3d. (2 as.). This has greatly lessened the amount of liquor-drinking and greatly increased the excise revenue. In 1879-80 only sixty-one stills were worked instead of 3525 in 1877-78; the number of trees tapped fell from 151,348 to 38,167, and the number of toddy-shops from 971 to 405. At the same time the excise revenue rose from \u00a347,250 (Rs. 4,72,500), the average of the five years ending 1876-77, to \u00a361,038 (Rs. 6,10,380) in 1879-80. This great change has impoverished palm-tappers and liquor-sellers, and is naturally unpopular with liquor-drinkers. On the other hand, the district officers agree that there has been a marked decrease in drunkenness; that assaults and other offences due to excessive drinking are less common; that many landholders have shaken themselves free from their indebtedness to liquor-sellers, and that unskilled labourers work steadier and better than they used to work, and either spend on comforts or save part of what they used to waste on drink. The enhanced price of liquor, and the unrestricted possession of the moha berry have however acted as incentives to illicit distillation in the inland parts of the district, and prosecutions and convictions have been numerous.\nPrevious to 1880-81 licenses for the sale of intoxicating drugs, bh\u0101ng g\u0101nja and m\u0101jam, in shops or groups of shops were sold by auction and the sums obtained were small. A new system has been introduced since the 1st of January 1881, and rules have been passed for regulating the manufacture, sale, and transport of these drugs. The result of the greater security against illicit sale and consumption which the licensed retailers enjoy under these rules than when the traffic was free is shown by the rise in the average yearly receipts from \u00a3192 (Rs. 1920) during the ten years ending 1881-82 to \u00a3452 10s. (Rs. 4525) in 1882-83. Most of the drugs come from Ahmadnagar to Panvel, and are there shipped to other parts of the Presidency.\n\nLaw and justice receipts, chiefly fines, have risen from \u00a31127 to \u00a33560 (Rs. 11,270 - Rs. 35,600), and charges from \u00a310,744 to \u00a319,404 (Rs. 1,07,440 - Rs. 1,94,040). The rise in the expenditure is due to an increase in the pay of officers and establishment.\n\nForest receipts have risen from nothing to \u00a316,072 (Rs. 1,60,720), and charges from \u00a345 to \u00a38474 (Rs. 450 to Rs. 84,740). A statement of the yearly receipts and charges for the ten years ending 1879-80 is given above at page 37.\n\nThe following table shows, exclusive of official salaries, the amount realised from the different assessed taxes levied between 1860-61 and 1879-80. The variety of rates and incidence prevent any satisfactory comparison of results:\n\n| Year | Yield |\n|------|-------|\n| Income Tax | \u00a3 |\n| 1860-61 | 7597 |\n| 1861-62 | 12,994 |\n| 1862-63 | 15,222 |\n| 1863-64 | 6456 |\n| 1864-65 | 6808 |\n| 1865-66 | 2714 |\n| 1866-67 | 20 |\n\n| Year | Yield |\n|------|-------|\n| License Tax | \u00a3 |\n| 1867-68 | 4062 |\n| Certificate Tax | |\n| 1888-69 | 8077 |\n| Income Tax | |\n| 1869-70 | 6426 |\n\n| Year | Yield |\n|------|-------|\n| Income Tax\u2014contd. | \u00a3 |\n| 1870-71 | 9610 |\n| 1871-72 | 3512 |\n| 1872-73 | 2065 |\n| License Tax | |\n| 1878-79 | 6778 |\n| 1879-80 | 6316 |\n\nCustoms and opium receipts have fallen from \u00a344,431 to \u00a31041 (Rs. 4,44,310 - Rs. 10,410). This is due to the abolition of transit duties, the reduction of customs duties, and the creation of new departments to which the customs and opium revenues are credited. The large expenditure in 1819-20 represents the payments made to landholders on account of hereditary land and sea-customs allowances, which have since been commuted. The opium revenue has risen from \u00a3860 (Rs. 8600) in 1879-80 to \u00a31930 (Rs. 19,300) in 1882-83. This increase is due to the system introduced in 1880-81, under which holders of licenses to sell opium are required to purchase monthly from Government a certain minimum quantity of opium.\n\n1 Government Resolution No. 4421, dated 8th August 1880.\nDetails of the salt revenue have been given in the Trade Chapter. According to the Th\u00e1na returns salt receipts have risen from \u00a3211 to \u00a3110,629 (Rs. 2110 - Rs. 11,06,290), but the revenue from Th\u00e1na salt is very much greater than the amount shown in the balance sheet. In 1880-81 it amounted to \u00a3785,902 (Rs. 78,59,020). The reason why so small an amount is credited to salt in the Th\u00e1na accounts is, that the greater part of the payments are made direct at the Salt Collector's office in Bombay. On the basis of ten pounds of salt a head, at 4s. (Rs. 2) the Bengal man, the revenue demand from the salt consumed in the district may be estimated at about \u00a322,000 (Rs. 2,20,000).\n\nThe public works receipts are chiefly derived from tolls levied on Provincial roads.\n\nIn 1879-80 military receipts amounted to \u00a3571 (Rs. 5710), and charges, chiefly pension payments, to \u00a33468 (Rs. 34,680).\n\nIn 1879-80 mint receipts amounted to \u00a3154 (Rs. 1540), and charges to \u00a31585 (Rs. 15,850).\n\nIn 1879-80 post receipts amounted to \u00a34165 (Rs. 41,650), and post charges to \u00a32502 (Rs. 25,020).\n\nIn 1879-80 telegraph receipts amounted to \u00a315 (Rs. 150), and telegraph charges to \u00a3135 (Rs. 1350).\n\nIn 1879-80 registration receipts amounted to \u00a31265 (Rs. 12,650), and registration charges to \u00a3945 (Rs. 9450).\n\nIn 1879-80 education receipts including local funds amounted to \u00a36940 (Rs. 69,400), and education charges to \u00a38317 (Rs. 83,170).\n\nIn 1879-80 police receipts amounted to \u00a31097 (Rs. 10,970), and police charges to \u00a316,563 (Rs. 1,65,630).\n\nIn 1879-80 medical receipts amounted to \u00a31 (Rs. 10), and medical charges to \u00a33993 (Rs. 39,930).\n\nIn 1879-80 jail receipts amounted to \u00a31240 (Rs. 12,400), and jail charges to \u00a37250 (Rs. 72,500).\n\nTransfer receipts have risen from \u00a310,438 to \u00a341,658 (Rs. 1,04,380 - Rs. 4,16,580), and transfer charges from \u00a3142,600 to \u00a3270,782 (Rs. 14,26,000 - Rs. 27,07,820). The increased revenue is due to receipts on account of local funds, to remittances from other treasuries, and to Savings Banks deposits. The increased charges are due to a large surplus balance remitted to other treasuries, to the expenditure on account of local funds, and to the repayment of deposits.\n\nIn the following balance sheets the figures shown in black type on both sides of the 1879-80 balance sheet are book adjustments. On the receipt side the item of \u00a315,027 (Rs. 1,50,270) represents the additional revenue the district would yield, had none of its land been alienated. On the debit side the items of \u00a32062 (Rs. 20,620) under land revenue and \u00a369 (Rs. 690) under police are the rentals of the lands granted for service to village headmen and watchmen. The item of \u00a312,896 (Rs. 1,28,960), shown under allowances and assignments, represents the rental of lands granted to hereditary officers whose services have been dispensed with, and of religious and charitable land-grants. Cash allowances to village and district officers who render service are treated as actual charges and debited to land revenue.\n### Chapter X.\n\n#### Revenue and Finance.\n\n**Balance Sheets, 1820 and 1850.**\n\n| Head                  | Receipts 1819-20 | Receipts 1879-80 |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Land Revenue          | \u00a3135,265         | \u00a3141,245         |\n| Stamps                | 2411             | 1879             |\n| Excise                | 3867             | 62,450           |\n| Justice               | 1127             | 3500             |\n| Forests               | 16,072           |                  |\n| Assessed Taxes        | 682              | 228              |\n| Interest              |                  | 30               |\n| Customs and Opium     | 44,451           | 1041             |\n| Salt                  | 211              | 110,689          |\n| Public Works          |                  | 7102             |\n| Military              | 571              |                  |\n| Mint                  | 154              |                  |\n| Post                  | 4195             |                  |\n| Telegraph             | 15               |                  |\n| Registration          | 1265             |                  |\n| Education             | 8940             |                  |\n| Police                | 1097             |                  |\n| Medicine              | 1                |                  |\n| Jail                 | 1240             |                  |\n| Sales of Books        | 28               |                  |\n| **Total**             | **187,984**      | **330,818**      |\n\n| Head                  | Charges 1819-20 | Charges 1879-80 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Land Revenue          | 29,247          | 24,948          |\n| Stamps                | 751             | 436             |\n| Excise                | 502             | 1841            |\n| Justice               | { Civil }       | { Criminal }    |\n|                       | 10,744          | 18,582          |\n| Forests               | 45              | 8474            |\n| Assessed Taxes        | 10,888          | 14,587          |\n| Allowances            |                  | 12,896          |\n| Pensions              |                  | 5068            |\n| Ecclesiastical        | 162             | 692             |\n| Miscellaneous         | 783             | 1791            |\n| Customs               | 19,598          | 1               |\n| Military              |                  | 24,107          |\n| Public Works          | 2750            | 24,402          |\n| Mint                  |                  | 3468            |\n| Post                  |                  | 2302            |\n| Telegraph             |                  | 126             |\n| Registration          |                  | 945             |\n| Education             |                  | 8317            |\n| Police                |                  | 10,583          |\n| Medicine              |                  | 69              |\n| Jail                  |                  | 3983            |\n| Office Rent           |                  | 7250            |\n| Printing              |                  | 16              |\n| Miscellaneous         |                  | 17              |\n| Public Works          |                  | 1791            |\n| **Total**             | **75,450**      | **172,388**     |\n\n**Transfer Items.**\n\n| Head                  | Receipts 1819-20 | Receipts 1879-80 |\n|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Deposits and Loans    | 8482             | 13,584           |\n| Cash Remittances      | 1978             | 13,308           |\n| Local Funds           |                  | 15,916           |\n| **Total**             | **10,438**       | **41,858**       |\n\n| Head                  | Charges 1819-20 | Charges 1879-80 |\n|-----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Deposits and Loans    | 4467            | 11,602          |\n| Cash Remittances      | 138,138         | 256,753         |\n| Interest              |                  | 247             |\n| Local Funds           |                  | 2180            |\n| **Total**             | **142,600**     | **270,783**     |\n\n**GRAND TOTAL** | **198,423** | **422,276** | **15,027** |\n\n---\n\n**Revenue other than Imperial.**\n\nLocal Funds.\n\nThe district local funds, which since 1863 have been collected to promote rural education and supply roads, water, drains, rest-houses, and dispensaries, amounted in 1879-80 to \u00a321,163 (Rs. 2,11,630), and the expenditure to \u00a319,565 (Rs. 1,95,650). This revenue is drawn from three sources, a special cess of one-sixteenth in addition to the land tax, the proceeds of certain subordinate local funds, and some miscellaneous items of revenue. The special land cess, of which two-thirds are set apart as a road fund and the rest as a school fund, yielded in 1879-80 a revenue of \u00a39298 (Rs. 92,980). Smaller heads, including a ferry fund, a cattle-pound fund, a travellers' bungalow fund, and a school fee fund yielded \u00a36368 (Rs. 63,680). Government and private subscriptions amounted to \u00a34099 (Rs. 40,990), and miscellaneous receipts, including certain items of land revenue, to \u00a31398 (Rs. 13,980). This revenue is administered by committees partly of official and partly of private members. Besides the district committee consisting of the\nCollector, assistant and deputy collectors, the executive engineer, and the education inspector as official and the proprietor of an alienated village and six landholders as non-official members, each sub-division has its own committee, consisting of an assistant collector, the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r, a public works officer, and the deputy education inspector as official and the proprietor of an alienated village and three landholders as non-official members. The sub-divisional committees bring their local requirements to the notice of the district committee which prepares the yearly budget.\n\nFor administrative purposes the local funds of the district are divided into two main sections, one set apart for public works and the other for instruction. The 1879-80 receipts and disbursements under these two heads were as follows:\n\n**TH\u00c1NA LOCAL FUNDS, 1879-80.**\n\n| PUBLIC WORKS. | CHARGES. |\n|---------------|----------|\n| **Receipts.** | **Charges.** |\n| \u00a3             | \u00a3        |\n| Balance on 1st April 1879 | Establishment | 1920 |\n| Two-thirds of the Land Cess | New Works | 4871 |\n| Tolls | Repairs | 5826 |\n| Ferries | Medical Charges | 879 |\n| Cattle-pounds | Miscellaneous | 366 |\n| Travellers' Bungalows | Balance on 31st March 1880 | 5802 |\n| Contributions | Total | 19,470 |\n| Miscellaneous | Total | 19,470 |\n\n| INSTRUCTION. |\n|---------------|\n| **Receipts.** |\n| \u00a3 |\n| Balance on 1st April 1879 | 1210 |\n| One-third of the Land Cess | 8009 |\n| School-fees fund | 555 |\n| Contributions, Government and Municipal | 2208 |\n| Ditto Private | 97 |\n| Miscellaneous | 98 |\n| **Total** | 7187 |\n\nSince 1863 from local funds about 460 miles of road have been made and kept in order and partly planted with trees. To improve the water-supply 917 wells, 29 ponds, and 27 water-courses have been made or repaired. To help village instruction, ninety-eight schools, and for the comfort of travellers 33 rest-houses have been built or repaired. Besides these works, five dispensaries and 472 cattle-pounds have been made or repaired.\n\nThere are nine municipalities, seven of them, Th\u00e1na, Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwndi, Panvel, Bassein, M\u00e1him, and Uran established under Act XXVI. of 1850 and two of them B\u00e1ndra and Kurla established under Act VI. of 1873. These municipalities are administered by a body of commissioners, with the Collector as President and the assistant or deputy collector in charge of the sub-division as vice-president. The Th\u00e1na and Kurla municipalities have an executive commissioner.\ninstead of a managing committee. In 1879-80 the total municipal revenue amounted to \u00a37831 (Rs. 78,310). Of this \u00a31978 (Rs. 19,780) were recovered from octroi dues, \u00a31740 (Rs. 17,400) from house tax, \u00a32324 (Rs. 23,240) from tolls and wheel taxes, \u00a3715 (Rs. 7150) from assessed taxes, and \u00a31074 (Rs. 10,740) from miscellaneous sources.\n\nThe following statement gives for each of the municipalities the receipts, charges, and incidence of taxation during the year ending the 31st of March 1880:\n\n### Th\u00e1na Municipal Details, 1879-80.\n\n| Name    | Date       | People, 1881 | Receipts |\n|---------|------------|--------------|----------|\n|         |            |              | Octroi   | House-tax | Tolls and Wheel-tax | Assessed taxes | Miscellaneous | Total | Incidence |\n| Panvel  | Feb. 1855  | 10,361       | \u00a3        | \u00a3         | \u00a3                 | \u00a3             | \u00a3           | \u00a3     | s. d.     |\n| Kaly\u00e1n  | May 1855   | 12,610       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Mahim   | Jan. 1855  | 7,122        |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Th\u00e1na   | Oct. 1862  | 13,658       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Bassein | March 1864 | 10,357       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Bhiwandi| Jan. 1865  | 13,837       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Uran    | Aug. 1866  | 10,149       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Bandra  | March 1876 | 14,987       |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| Kuria   | Feb. 1878  | 9715         |          |          |                   |               |             |       |           |\n| **Total**|            | **103,884**  | **1978** | **1740** | **2324**           | **715**       | **1074**   | **7831**|           |\n\n### Charges.\n\n| Name    | Staff | Safety | Health | Schools | Works | Miscellaneous | Total |\n|---------|-------|--------|--------|---------|-------|---------------|-------|\n| Panvel  |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Kaly\u00e1n  |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Mahim   |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Th\u00e1na   |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Bassein |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Bhiwandi|       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Uran    |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Bandra  |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| Kuria   |       |        |        |         |       |               |       |\n| **Total**| **787**| **594**| **2824**| **382**| **737**| **1225**       | **713**| **7282**|\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINSTRUCTION.\n\nIn 1879-80 there were 154 Government schools or an average of one school for every fourteen inhabited villages, alienated as well as Government, with 7842 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 5560 pupils or 6\u00b731 per cent of 123,228 the population between six and fourteen years of age.\n\nExcluding superintendence charges the expenditure on these schools amounted in 1879-80 to \u00a36106 (Rs. 61,060), of which \u00a32593 (Rs. 25,930) were debited to Government and \u00a33513 (Rs. 35,130) to local and other funds.\n\nIn 1879-80, under the Director of Public Instruction and the Educational Inspector, Central Division, the education of the district was conducted by a local staff 291 strong, consisting of a deputy educational inspector with a yearly salary of \u00a3210 (Rs. 2100), and masters and assistant-masters of schools with yearly salaries ranging from \u00a3150 (Rs. 1500) to \u00a37 4s. (Rs. 72).\n\nOf the 154 Government schools, 117 taught Marathi, four Gujarati, seven Urdu, and one Portuguese. In thirteen of the schools Marathi and Gujarati were taught, in four Marathi and Urdu, and in two Marathi and Portuguese. In two of the six remaining schools instruction was given in English Marathi and Sanskrit, in three in English and Marathi, and in one in English and Portuguese. Of the 117 Marathi schools six were exclusively for girls.\n\nBesides these Government schools, there were four primary schools inspected by the educational department, of which one is attached to the jail and a second to the police head-quarters. There were no private schools aided by Government.\n\nBefore Government took the education of the district under their care every large village had a school. These schools were generally taught by Brahmins and attended by boys under twelve years of age. Since the introduction of state education these local private schools have suffered greatly. Still it is the feeling among husbandmen and traders that the chief objects of schooling are to teach boys the fluent reading and writing of the current or Modi Maratha hand and arithmetic. These subjects they think are better taught in private schools than in Government schools, and for this reason in large villages and country towns several private schools continued to compete successfully with Government schools till within the last year or two when the Government schools began to give more\nattention to the teaching of Modi or Marathi writing. In 1879-80 there were sixty-three of these private schools with an attendance of about 1095 pupils. The teacher's education is limited, but they teach the alphabet, the multiplication table, and some of the simpler rules of arithmetic with skill and success. The masters are mostly Br\u00e1hmans. In many cases they are men who have failed to get Government or other employment. They have no fixed fees and depend on what the parents or guardians of their pupils are inclined to pay. In addition to the fees they levy small fortnightly contributions and receive occasional presents. The entrance fee, which is offered to the teacher in the name of Sarasvati the goddess of learning, varies from 3d. (2 as.) for a poor boy to 2s. (Re. 1) for the son of well-to-do parents. When a boy has finished his first or ujalni course and is taught to write on paper, the teacher gets from 1\u00bdd. to 2s. (anna 1-Re. 1). On the last day of each half of the Hindu month, that is on every full-moon or Purnima and every new-moon or Amav\u00e1sya, the master gets from all except the poorest pupils, a quarter to a full sher of rice according as the boy's parents are rich or poor. Such of the parents as are well disposed to the teacher or are satisfied with their boys' progress, give the master a turban or a pair of waistcloths on the occasion of the pupil's thread-ceremony or marriage. Altogether the income of the teacher of a private school varies from about \u00a33 to \u00a37 (Rs. 30 - Rs. 70) a year. Boys of six to eight are taught reckoning tables or ujalni. They are then made to trace letters on a sanded board or to write them on a blackboard with a reed pen dipped in wet chalk. The pupils seldom learn to write well, but mental arithmetic is taught to perfection and the method of teaching the tables has been adopted in Government schools. The boys go to their teacher's house in the morning and evening. As his house is often small the pupils are grouped in the veranda where they work their sums and shout their tables. The position of the teacher as a Brahman, and the religious element in some of their teaching, help them in their competition with the secular state schools. The course of study in these private schools is soon finished. Most of the boys leave before they are twelve.\n\nThe following figures show the increased means for learning to read and write offered by Government to the people during the last fifty-three years. The first Government vernacular school was opened at Bassein in 1827, and the second three years after at Kaly\u00e1n. Five years later a school was established at Th\u00e1na, and in the following thirteen years two schools were added one at Panvel and the other at M\u00e1l\u00edm. Thus in 1850 there were only five Government schools in the district. The first English school was opened at Th\u00e1na in 1851. Within about four years ten new schools were opened at different places, raising the number to sixteen. In 1857-58 the number of schools had risen to twenty-seven with 1588 names on the rolls. By 1870 the number of schools had risen to 123, and the number of pupils to 7027. The attendance was\n\n---\n\n1 Of the sixty-three village schoolmasters in 1879-80 twenty-two were Br\u00e1hmans, eleven were Marath\u00e1s, fifteen were other Hindus, and fifteen were Musalm\u00e1ns.\nregular, about 5290 boys being on an average present. In 1877-78 the number of schools had risen to 151, but the number on the rolls had fallen from 7027 to 6975 and the average attendance from 5290 to 5077. In 1879-80, the number of schools rose to 154, the names on the rolls to 7842, and the average attendance to 5560. A comparison with the returns for 1857-58 gives for 1879-80 an increase from twenty-seven to 154 in the number of schools, and from 1588 to 7842 in the number of pupils.\n\nBefore 1867 there were no girls' schools. In 1871-72 there were six schools with 248 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 180. In 1879-80 the number of schools was still six, but the number of pupils had risen to 363 and the average attendance to 217.\n\nIn 1881 of 822,400, the total Hindu population, 8458 (males 8326, females 132) or 1\u00b702 per cent were under instruction; 19,766 (males 19,611, females 155) or 2\u00b740 per cent were instructed; 794,176 (males 395,394, females 398,782) or 96\u00b756 per cent were illiterate. Of 42,391 the total Musalm\u00e1n population 1404 (males 1299, females 105) or 3\u00b731 per cent were under instruction; 2626 (males 2594, females 32) or 6\u00b719 per cent were instructed; 38,361 (males 19,019, females 19,342) or 90\u00b749 per cent were illiterate. Of 39,545, the total Christian population, 1221 (males 969, females 252) or 3\u00b708 per cent were under instruction; 1515 (males 1344, females 171) or 3\u00b783 per cent were instructed; 36,809 (males 17,589, females 19,220) or 93\u00b708 per cent were illiterate.

Of 363, the total number of girls on the rolls of the six schools in 1879-80, 318 were Hindus, two were Musalm\u00e1ns, and forty-three were entered as \u2018Others.\u2019\n\nThe following tables, prepared from special returns furnished by the Education Department, show in detail the number of schools and pupils with their cost to Government:\n\n**TH\u00c1'NA SCHOOL RETURN, 1855-56, 1865-66 AND 1879-80.**\n\n| Class          | Schools | Hindus | Musalm\u00e1ns |\n|----------------|---------|--------|-----------|\n|                |         |        |           |\n|                | 1855-56 | 1865-66| 1879-80   |\n| Government     |         |        |           |\n| High School    | ...     | 1      | 100       |\n| Anglo-Vernacular| 14     | 4      | 72        |\n| Vernacular     | Boys    | 16     | 65        |\n|                | Girls   | 6      |           |\n| Inspected      |         |        |           |\n| Vernacular     |         | 4      |           |\n| Total          | 16      | 79     | 168       |\n\n| Class          | Pupils, &c. | Total |\n|----------------|-------------|-------|\n|                |             |       |\n|                | 1855-56     | 1865-66| 1879-80 |\n| Government     |             |       |         |\n| High School    |             | 20    | 124     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular|         | 85    | 110     |\n| Vernacular     | Boys        | 96    | 106     |\n|                | Girls       | 43    |         |\n| Inspected      |             |       |         |\n| Vernacular     |             | 148   |         |\n| Total          | 133        | 283   | 971     |\n\n| Class          | Average daily attendance |\n|----------------|--------------------------|\n|                |                          |\n|                | 1855-56     | 1865-66| 1879-80 |\n| Government     |              |        |         |\n| High School    |              | 124    |         |\n| Anglo-Vernacular|            | 69     | 1635    |\n| Vernacular     | Boys        | 106    | 2010    |\n|                | Girls       | 43     |         |\n| Inspected      |              |        |         |\n| Vernacular     |              | 148    |         |\n| Total          | 133        | 283    | 971     |\n### Chapter XI.\n#### Instruction.\n##### Schools, 1855-1880.\n\n#### TH\u00c1NA SCHOOL RETURN, 1855-56, 1865-66 AND 1879-80\u2014continued.\n\n| Class | Fee | Cost per pupil |\n|-------|-----|----------------|\n|       |     | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| High School |     |     |     |     |\n| Government |     |     |     |     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular | 1s. to 2s. | 4d. to 9d. | 2s. to 3s. | 1 1 3 | 1 9 4\u00bd | 1 0 10\u00bd |\n| Vernacular | Boys | 1\u00bdd. | 4d. to 8d. | 3d. to 9d. | 0 8 11 | 0 17 1\u00bd | 0 16 1\u00bd |\n|           | Girls |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| Inspected |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| Vernacular |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n| Total |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |\n\n#### Receipts.\n\n| Class | Government | Local Cess | Municipalities |\n|-------|------------|------------|---------------|\n|       | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| High School |     |     |     |\n| Government |     |     |     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular | 60 | 682 | 247 |\n| Vernacular | Boys | 292 | 450 | 167 |\n|           | Girls |     |     | 251 |\n| Inspected |     |     |     |\n| Vernacular |     |     |     |\n| Total | 852 | 1142 | 2598 |\n\n#### Receipts\u2014continued.\n\n| Class | Private | Fee | Total |\n|-------|---------|-----|-------|\n|       | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| High School |     |     |     |\n| Government |     |     |     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular | 584 | 520 | 71 |\n| Vernacular | Boys | 65 | 18 | 28 |\n|           | Girls |     |     |     |\n| Inspected |     |     |     |\n| Vernacular |     |     |     |\n| Total | 85 | 582 | 278 |\n\n#### Expenditure.\n\n| Class | Instruction and Inspection | Buildings | Scholarships | Total |\n|-------|----------------------------|-----------|--------------|-------|\n|       | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. | \u00a3 s. d. |\n| High School |     |     |     |     |\n| Government |     |     |     |     |\n| Anglo-Vernacular | 124 | 1511 | 518 | 604 |\n| Vernacular | Boys | 881 | 1768 | 894 |\n|           | Girls |     |     | 251 |\n| Inspected |     |     |     |     |\n| Vernacular |     |     |     |     |\n| Total | 456 | 8279 | 5547 | 897 | 596 | 11 | 84 | 486 | 3937 | 6107 |\nA comparison of the present (1879-80) provision for teaching the district town and village population gives the following results. In the town of Th\u00e1na, there were in 1879-80 six schools with 661 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 473 pupils. Of these six schools, one was a high school, two were Mar\u00e1thi, one Urdu, one Anglo-Portuguese, and one a girls\u2019 school. The average yearly cost of each pupil in the high school was \u00a32 12s. (Rs. 26); in the other schools it varied from 13s. (Rs. 6\u00bd) to \u00a31 1s. (Rs. 10\u00bd). In addition to the six Government schools, there were seven private schools, one with 162 boys on the roll. Of these private schools one was an Anglo-vernacular school teaching to the fifth standard which has since been closed, four were Mar\u00e1thi schools, one an Urdu school, and one a Gujar\u00e1ti school. In 1879-80, in the town of Kaly\u00e1n there were five Government schools with 451 names on the roll, and an average attendance of 339 pupils. Of these schools one was a first grade Anglo-vernacular school, one an Urdu school, one a Mar\u00e1thi school, one a Gujar\u00e1ti school, and one a girls\u2019 school. The average yearly cost of each boy in the English school was \u00a34 13s. 11d. (Rs. 46-15-6) and in the Urdu school 16s. 10d. (Rs. 8-7). In the other schools it varied from 11s. 7d. to 17s. 3d. (Rs. 5-13-Rs. 8-10). In the town of Bhiwandi there were three Government schools, two for boys and one for girls. The number of boys on the rolls was 280, the average attendance 182, the average yearly cost for each pupil in the boys\u2019 school was 19s. 6d. (Rs. 9\u00be) and in the girls\u2019 school 16s. 6d. (Rs. 8\u00bc). In the town of Panvel there were three Government schools, a second grade Anglo-vernacular school, an Urdu school, and a girls\u2019 school, with 271 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 197. The average yearly cost for each pupil was 16s. 6d. (Rs. 8\u00bc) in the Anglo-vernacular school and in the rest it varied from 5s. 6d. to 19s. 6d. (Rs. 2\u00be-Rs. 9\u00be). In the town of M\u00e1lh\u00edm there were two Government schools for boys with 267 names on the rolls and an average attendance of 186. The average yearly cost of each pupil was 10s. 4d. (Rs. 5-3). In the town of Bassein there were two Government schools, one of them a second grade Anglo-vernacular school. There were 232 names on the rolls, and an average yearly cost of 14s. 9d. (Rs. 7-6) in the English school and 12s. 9d. (Rs. 6-6) in the Mar\u00e1thi school.\nExclusive of the six towns of Th\u00e1na, Kaly\u00e1n, Bhiwndi, Panvel, M\u00e1l\u00edm, and Bassein, the district of Th\u00e1na was in 1879-80 provided with 133 schools or an average of one school to every sixteen inhabited villages. The following statement shows the distribution of these schools by sub-divisions:\n\n**Th\u00e1na Village Schools, 1879-80.**\n\n| Sub-Division | Villages | People, 1881 | Schools |\n|--------------|----------|--------------|---------|\n| D\u00e1h\u00e1nu      | 212      | 108,615      | 11      |\n| M\u00e1l\u00edm       | 188      | 69,767       | 11      |\n| Bassein     | 92       | 58,302       | 14      |\n| Bhiwndi     | 194      | 61,265       | 8       |\n| Shah\u00e1pur    | 276      | 107,149      | 14      |\n| Vada        | 156      | 30,497       | 6       |\n| S\u00e1lssette   | 113      | 92,763       | 16      |\n| Kaly\u00e1n      | 228      | 64,891       | 9       |\n| Murb\u00e1d      | 172      | 63,932       | 7       |\n| Panvel      | 217      | 88,226       | 18      |\n| Karjat      | 270      | 88,105       | 17      |\n\nIn 1880 there were six libraries and two reading-rooms in the district. The Th\u00e1na Native General Library was founded in 1850 chiefly through the liberality of Mr. Key who was then judge. The library is recognised and registered by Government. In 1879-80 the library included a stock of 947 books, 712 of which were English and 235 in ancient and modern oriental languages. Of the 712 English books, 128 were selections from Government records, seventeen were on religion, nineteen on law, fifty-five on science and arts, fifteen were travels and voyages, 136 were histories and biographies, ten were poetical and dramatic works, twenty-one were books of general literature, 107 were works of fiction, fifty-two were magazines, and 152 were on miscellaneous subjects. Of the 235 works in oriental languages, three were Sanskrit, two Persian, seven Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed, 198 Mar\u00e1th\u00ed, and twenty-five Gujar\u00e1ti. The library subscribes to two daily newspapers, the Bombay Gazette and the Bombay Sam\u00e1ch\u00e1r, and to one weekly paper the Poona Dny\u00e1n Pr\u00e1k\u00e1sh. It also receives, free of charge, the Arunodaya and the Suryodaya. No periodical was subscribed for, but the Bombay Educational Record was received free of cost. In 1879-80, there were on the library lists forty-five subscribers, seven of them first class paying 2s. (Re. 1) a month, twelve second class paying 1s. (8 as.), twenty-three third class paying 6d. (4 as.), and three fourth class paying 3d. (2 as.). In 1879-80 the total receipts were \u00a347 (Rs. 470).\n\nThe Bassein Library was started in 1863 by the people of the town. In 1879-80 it had nineteen subscribers and a stock of 320 books. It is supported partly by monthly subscriptions and partly by a municipal grant. In 1880 it had a revenue of \u00a319 (Rs. 190) and took three vernacular and four English newspapers, and three monthly magazines. The monthly rates of subscription were 1s. 6d. (12 as.), 6d. (4 as.), and 3d. (2 as.). In 1880 there were thirteen subscribers and a revenue of \u00a35 4s. (Rs. 52). The Kaly\u00e1n Library was founded in 1864 by the people of the town, and is supported by monthly subscriptions. In 1879-80 the library contained 335 books and had forty-three subscribers. It took four English and five vernacular newspapers and four monthly magazines. There were four rates of subscription, 2s. (Re. 1), 1s. (8 as.), 6d. (4 as.), and 3d. (2 as.). In 1880 the income and the expenditure amounted to \u00a335 (Rs. 350).\nThe Uran Native General Library was opened in 1865 by the people of the town. In 1879-80 it was maintained by a contribution of \u00a36 (Rs. 60) from the municipal fund. The library has 271 books and subscribes to one English and two vernacular newspapers.\n\nThe Native General Library at Bhiwandi was started in 1865 by the people of the town, and is maintained partly by monthly subscriptions and partly from funds received from the municipality. In 1879-80 it subscribed to twelve newspapers, two of them English and ten vernacular. The subscribers were divided into two classes, those of the first class paying a monthly subscription of 1s. (8 as.) and those of the second paying 6d. (4 as.). In 1879-80 there were twenty-six subscribers and a revenue of \u00a322 (Rs. 220) all of which was spent. The Bhiwandi Library contains 482 books.\n\nThe Panvel Library was founded by the people of the town in 1867. It is supported partly from subscriptions and partly from a municipal grant. In 1879-80 it had 216 books and took one vernacular newspaper and two monthly magazines. There were twelve subscribers, some paying 1s. 6d. (12 as.) a month, others 1s. (8 as.), and the rest 6d. (4 as.).\n\nThe Kelve-Mahim Reading-room was founded by the people of Mahim in 1877, and is supported solely by the subscribers. In 1879-80 it subscribed to four Marathi newspapers and to six monthly magazines. The Shahapur Reading-room was opened in 1876 and is maintained entirely by subscription. It takes four vernacular newspapers. The yearly charges are about \u00a33 (Rs. 30).\n\nThere are four weekly Marathi newspapers in the district. The Arunodaya or Dawn is of seventeen years' standing. It is published at Thana on Sundays, at a yearly subscription of 10s. (Rs. 5). The Suryodaya or Sunrise is of sixteen years' standing. It is published at Thana on Mondays, at a yearly subscription of 10s. (Rs. 5). The Hindu Punch of eleven years' standing is published at Thana on Thursdays, at a yearly subscription of 4s. (Rs. 2). The Vasai Samachar or the Bassein News is of five years' standing. It is published at Bassein on Sundays, at a yearly subscription of 5s. (Rs. 2\u00bd).\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nHEALTH.\u00b9\n\nThe low level of the plains of the district, its heavy rainfall, and the large area of salt marsh, forests, and rice fields, make the climate hot, damp, and feverish. The most feverish months are October November and December, when, after the south-west monsoon is over and under a powerful sun, decaying vegetable matter produces an atmosphere charged with fevers and throat and bowel affections.\n\nThe chief disease is malarial fever complicated by enlarged spleen and enlarged liver. Malarial bloodlessness and scurvy also largely prevail and complicate nearly every disease that comes under treatment. Many of the people of the district are under-fed and under-clothed, and indulge freely, some of them excessively, in country liquor. This fondness for liquor is one of the causes of the poor physique and meagre appearance of many of the lower classes in Th\u00e1na. Syphilis, gonorrhoea, and skin diseases are common. Children suffer from intestinal worms, which are generally round, though the thread-worm is also common. Guineaworm is endemic and gives rise to various affections of the cellular tissue which last for months. Epidemics of cholera used to be frequent. They still occasionally occur, but at least in the town of Th\u00e1na, the introduction of pure water has diminished the virulence of the outbreaks.\n\nThe chief causes of disease are impure air, scanty and impure water, scanty and improper food, and scanty clothing. As regards food, rice is often taken in excessively large quantities causing chronic dyspepsia and swelling and weakening of the stomach. The working in the fields without covering from the sun in the hot months or with only a blanket or leaf-shade to ward off the raw damp of the south-west monsoon severely try the constitutions of the peasantry.\n\nIntermittent fevers of the daily-recurring or quotidian type are the prevailing affections, the hospital returns showing about twenty-five per cent of fever cases.\u00b2 Remittent fever is comparatively rare; when it does occur it is complicated with jaundice and congested liver or spleen. One of the most painful followers of malarial fevers\n\n\u00b9 The details of diseases and epidemics have been compiled from information supplied by Surgeon K. R. Kirtikar, Civil Surgeon of Th\u00e1na.\n\u00b2 Of a total of 95,005 admissions in 1879 and 94,017 in 1880, 26,307 or 27\u00b76 per cent and 25,244 or 26\u00b78 per cent were for malarial fevers.\nis hemicrania a pain on one side of the head which is not amenable to nerve-sedatives or to quinine. Repeated attacks of malarial fever not uncommonly produce intense bloodlessness or anaemia which sometimes proves rapidly fatal. During the five years ending 1870 the number of deaths returned from fever averaged 5393. In 1871 it rose to 12,763 or nearly four times the number in 1867. During the ten years ending 1881 deaths from fever averaged 14,352, the total varying from 17,109 in 1881 to 11,678 in 1875.\n\nDuring 1879 there were 15,541 and during 1880 there were 15,905 admissions for bowel affections. Of these 5151 in 1879 and 4834 in 1880 were for diarrhoea. Among children many bowel diseases are due to round worms, a disease from which grown men also largely suffer. This affection seems to prevail chiefly among the poorer classes who give their children crude molasses. Natives who can afford to use purified crystal sugar seldom suffer from round worms. Apart from the irritation they cause to the whole intestinal canal these worms indirectly cause congestion of the liver, jaundice, fever, and other affections. The disease is well treated by native practitioners who are generally successful in killing the worm by using santonine.\n\nDysentery caused 2187 admissions in 1879 and 1914 in 1880. It is doubtful whether these dysentery cases are not the result of aggravated diarrhoea rather than examples of the specific affection which is technically known as dysentery.\n\nNext in numerical importance come skin diseases, for which there were 7136 admissions in 1879 and 7525 in 1880. The chief skin diseases are scabies, eczema, and ringworm. Nearly all skin diseases in the Konkan are complicated with an eczematous condition showing that the skin is deficient in nerve tone. Few of these skin diseases are cured without constitutional treatment by iron, cod-liver oil, and nutritious diet.\n\nThere were 6665 admissions in 1879 and 6156 in 1880 for affections of the breathing organs, chiefly bronchial catarrh and bronchitis. Pneumonia is rare.\n\nLiver and spleen diseases pure and simple are rare. As a rule, they are complications of malarial fevers. Heart disease is rare. A large number of men suffer from gonorrhoea and syphilis which are often terribly neglected. Leprosy and phthisis also prevail to about an equal extent. The chief cause of affections of the cellular tissue is guineaworm which is endemic in the Konkan. The entrance of this worm into the body of man is the direct result of bathing or washing in or wading through streamlets and ponds containing its minute germs. The stagnant waters after the rains are doubtless filled with the germs of these parasites and with countless other earth-worms whose structure is closely like that of the guineaworm. The affections resulting from the existence of this parasite under the skin, and from its sometimes marvellous journeys from one part of the limb to another, are as troublesome as they are destructive of the tissue they invade. It is hoped that the introduction of water-works in Th\u00e1na, Alib\u00e1g, and other Konkan towns will reduce the number of cases of guineaworm.\nAs Bombay is within such easy reach there is little field for operative surgery in Th\u00e1na. The chief chronic diseases requiring surgical interference are taken by friends to Bombay where there is large hospital accommodation and the highest surgical skill. Accidental injuries alone are treated in Th\u00e1na.\n\nNo details are available of the severe outbreaks of small-pox and cholera in 1819 and 1820 which so lowered the number of the people that for ten years the population is said not to have recovered its former strength. The records of the sixteen years ending April 1882 show that cholera was absent only in 1873 and 1874. In 1875 there was a very fierce outbreak of cholera. Till April no cases occurred. In April four or five were recorded in Kaly\u00e1n and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur. In May the disease spread to Bhiwndi, Kaly\u00e1n, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, Karj\u00e1t, Bassein, M\u00e1him, and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, 182 of 336 seizures proving fatal. In June the cholera spread throughout the district, the whole number of seizures being 2351 and of deaths 1676. In July the seizures rose to 2660, but the deaths fell to 1545, and in August the seizures fell to 2388 while the deaths rose to 1653. From September the disease began to abate. The seizures fell gradually from 676 in September to 305 in October, 144 in November, and 106 in December; and the deaths fell from 492 in September to 234 in October, ninety-three in November and eighty-eight in December. The total number of deaths in the year was 5969. The peculiar feature of the outbreak was the large area affected; few villages escaped. At Th\u00e1na the attack was most virulent and bonfires of sulphur and pitch were kept burning day and night at a daily cost of \u00a325 (Rs. 250). The attack was favoured by the filthy state of the town, the scanty and impure water, and the defective drainage. In 1876 cholera prevailed in all months except March, April, and November. The largest number of cases were registered in June and August and the smallest number in February and May. In the beginning of the year the cases were most numerous in V\u00e1da, in the middle of the year in D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, and at the end of the year in Karj\u00e1t. The available details of the D\u00e1h\u00e1nu outbreak show that the disease appeared on the 28th of May at the village of N\u00e1rgol, on the 1st of June at P\u00e1lgdud, on the 4th of June at Gholvad on the Baroda railway and on the 6th at Umbargaoon. It continued till the 23rd of June but only nine villages suffered. The outbreak was fiercest at Gholvad where the villagers are reported to have been panic-struck and to have died in the streets, in some cases within half an hour after seizure. The disease was mostly confined to Mochis, Dubl\u00e1s, V\u00e1r\u00eds, K\u00e1mlis, M\u00e1ngel\u00e1s and Dheds who are generally poor, badly fed, much given to liquor-drinking and whose habits are dirty. No accurate records of the seizure and deaths in this outbreak are available.\n\nIn 1877 cholera prevailed from April to December in Panvel, Th\u00e1na, and Kaly\u00e1n. The greatest mortality was in May and July and the least in November. In 1878 cholera prevailed throughout the year. In the beginning of the year it was in S\u00e1lsette, Panvel, and Karj\u00e1t; in February it was in M\u00e1him and Bassein; in April at Bhiwndi, and in May in D\u00e1h\u00e1nu. The largest number of deaths\nwas recorded in July and the smallest in December. In 1879 cholera began in April in Bassein and continued till the close of the year. In June it travelled through D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and S\u00e1lsette, in August through M\u00e1him, Bhiwandi, Panvel, and the town of Th\u00e1na. The greatest number of deaths were in June and July and the least in April and October. In 1880 it prevailed during the first four months causing seventy deaths, of which forty were registered in February and four in March. In January, February and March the disease was confined to Karjat. It appeared in the town of Th\u00e1na at the end of March and continued in April. In 1881 cholera prevailed from April to November, the largest number of cases having been registered in August and the smallest in October and April. The disease began among the fishermen of Kelva M\u00e1him in April and prevailed in Bassein from May to July, when also it appeared in Bhiwandi and Kaly\u00e1n. In August and September it prevailed in Th\u00e1na town and in Dhok\u00e1ti, Majevdeh, and Rabodi, villages to the north of Th\u00e1na. A few cases occurred in Th\u00e1na jail. In November it prevailed in Kaly\u00e1n. During the current year (1882) cholera visited S\u00e1lsette and Panvel in January, Kaly\u00e1n and Karjat in February, and Bhiwandi in March. In June it reappeared in Panvel and Karjat and a few cases occurred at Murb\u00e1d. It thus appears that cholera is almost never absent from the Th\u00e1na district; that now and then it assumes an epidemic form; and that the progress of the epidemic seems to depend on the frequency of human intercourse not on neighbourhood.\n\nSmall-pox still prevails in the Konkan, but the epidemics are rarer and less virulent than they used to be. In 1877 of 27,369 deaths from small-pox in the Bombay Presidency 1301 were registered in Th\u00e1na. The corresponding returns were in 1878 eighty-one out of 4475; in 1879 five out of 1156; in 1880 five out of 940; and in 1881 sixteen out of 539.\n\nFrom year to year the mortality returns show a marked variation in the ravages of disease. In the year 1873 the death rate in the Th\u00e1na district was 33\u00b722 per thousand though the year was elsewhere healthy; in 1876 in the whole of the district it was 19\u00b742 per thousand and in 1877, 27\u00b786 per thousand; in 1878 it was 24\u00b774; in 1879, 20\u00b766 and in 1880, 20\u00b722. In the Sanitary Commissioner's report for 1880 the mean annual mortality for the previous fourteen years is given as 17\u00b753 per thousand. The greatest mortality is from fevers. This in 1879 was as much as 16\u00b776 and in 1880 as much as 17\u00b770 per thousand. During the fourteen years ending 1880 the deaths from fever averaged 12\u00b774 per thousand.\n\nIn the year 1881, besides one civil hospital at Th\u00e1na there were twelve dispensaries, seven being supported from local funds, four from endowments, and one by Government. In 1881, 103,680 patients were treated, 566 of them in-door and 103,114 out-door. The total amount spent in checking disease in the same year was \u00a34728 (Rs. 47,280). The following details are taken from the 1881 report:\n\nThe Th\u00e1na civil hospital was established in 1836. The commonest diseases are ague, skin diseases, dysentery, and diarrhoea. The\nnumber treated was 381 in-door against 248, and 1989 out-door patients against 1692 in the previous year. Ten major operations were performed, of which two proved fatal.

The prevailing diseases are fevers, worms, rheumatic and respiratory affections, and skin diseases. Twenty-three in-door and 15,038 out-door patients were treated against forty and 16,149 in the previous year. In August fifteen cases of cholera occurred with five deaths. The cost was \u00a3536 6s. (Rs. 5363).\n\nThe Bhiwandi dispensary, established in 1866, is held in a hired building. The commonest diseases are malarial fevers, intestinal worms, and skin affections. 8451 out-door patients were treated against 8755 in 1880; the cost was \u00a3442 10s. (Rs. 4425).\n\nThe Kelva M\u00e1him dispensary, established in 1872, is conveniently lodged in a hired building in good repair.

The commonest diseases are ague, respiratory and rheumatic affections, diseases of the ear, eye, stomach and bowels, and skin diseases. The number treated was 9121 out-door and nineteen in-door patients and the cost \u00a3154 2s. (Rs. 1541).\n\nThe Rustomji W\u00e1dia dispensary at Th\u00e1na was established in 1865. It has a building of its own.

(Rs. 1882).\nThe Rukmanibai dispensary, called after Lady Mangaldas Nathubhai, at Kalyan, was established in 1865 by Sir Mangaldas Nathubhai, C.S.I. It is a large handsome building of which details are given in the account of Kalyan. Intestinal worms, fevers, respiratory affections, and skin diseases are the most common forms of disease. The number treated was 5474 out-door and fifty-nine in-door patients, and the cost \u00a3515 (Rs. 5150).\n\nThe Mithibai dispensary at Kurla, called after Mithibai the mother of Mr. Bomanji Hormasi Wadia, was opened in 1855.

DeSouza dispensary at Uran, called after the wife of Mr. M. DeSouza, was established in 1859. The prevailing diseases are ague, rheumatism, respiratory affections, bowel complaints including worms, diseases of the eye, ear, and skin affections. There was no epidemic disease. Three major operations were performed with success. 5322 out-door patients were treated at a cost of \u00a3340 (Rs. 3400).\n\nThe Government dispensary at Matheran was opened about 1856. It is held in a part of the Superintendent's office. The commonest diseases are intestinal worms, fevers, respiratory diseases, and skin diseases. The number of patients was 374, and the cost \u00a372 16s. (Rs. 728).\n\nAccording to the 1881 census returns 3197 (males 1787, females 1410) persons or 0\u00b735 per cent of the population were infirm. Of the total number 2881 (males 1594, females 1287) were Hindus; 141 (males 83, females 58) were Musalmans; 111 were Christians and 64 came under the head of Others. Of 3197, the total number of infirm persons, 396 (males 244, females 152) or 12\u00b738 per cent were of unsound mind; 1397 (males 635, females 762) or 43\u00b76 per cent were blind; 655 (males 393, females 262) or 20\u00b74 per cent were deaf and dumb; and 749 (males 515, females 234) or 23\u00b74 per cent were lepers.\n\nThe details are:\n\n| Thana Infirmes, 1881. |\n|----------------------|\n| **Hindus.** | **Musalmans.** | **Christians.** | **Others.** | **Total.** |\n| Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| Insane | 214 | 188 | 12 | 5 | 13 | 7 | 5 | 2 | 344 | 152 |\n| Blind | 571 | 697 | 20 | 40 | 17 | 15 | 18 | 10 | 835 | 762 |\n| Deaf and Dumb | 854 | 232 | 24 | 7 | 10 | 11 | 5 | 12 | 923 | 282 |\n| Lepers | 455 | 220 | 18 | 6 | 34 | 4 | 8 | 4 | 515 | 234 |\n| Total | 1584 | 1287 | 83 | 58 | 74 | 37 | 36 | 28 | 1767 | 1410 |\n\nIn 1881-82, under the supervision of the Deputy Sanitary Commissioner Konkan Registration District, the work of vaccination was carried on by sixteen vaccinators with yearly salaries varying from \u00a316 16s. (Rs. 168) to \u00a328 16s. (Rs. 288). Of the operators thirteen were distributed over the rural parts of the district, two for each of\nthe sub-divisions of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, and one for each of the other nine sub-divisions. Of the three remaining operators one was posted in Th\u00e1na, a second in Panvel and Uran, and a third in Kaly\u00e1n and Bhiwandi. Vaccination was also practised by the medical officers of twelve dispensaries. The total number of persons vaccinated was 23,726 besides 1007 revaccinated as compared with 11,284 vaccinations in 1869-70.\n\nThe following abstract shows the sex, religion, and age of the persons vaccinated:\n\n**Th\u00e1na Vaccination Details, 1869-70 and 1881-82.**\n\n| Years | Sex | Caste | Age |\n|-------|-----|-------|-----|\n|       | Males | Females | Hindus | Mus\u00e1l-m\u00e1ns | P\u00e1ris | Christians | Others | Under one year | Above two years | Total |\n| 1869-70 | ... | 5911 | 5373 | 10,357 | 326 | 88 | 459 | 104 | 4507 | 6777 | 11,284 |\n| 1881-82 | ... | 12,165 | 11,561 | 21,089 | 824 | 66 | 1264 | 503 | 11,439 | 15,237 | 23,726 |\n\nThe total cost of these operations in 1881-82 was \u00a3823 (Rs. 8230) or about 8\u00bd d. (5\u00bd as.) for each successful case. The entire charge was made up of the following items: supervision and inspection \u00a3358 6s. (Rs. 3588), establishment \u00a3436 6s. (Rs. 4363) and contingencies \u00a328 8s. (Rs. 284). Of these the supervising and inspecting charges were wholly met from Government provincial funds while \u00a3384 8s. (Rs. 3844) were borne by the local funds of the different sub-divisions, and \u00a380 6s. (Rs. 803) were paid by the municipalities of Th\u00e1na, Panvel, Uran, Kaly\u00e1n, and Bhiwandi for the entertainment of three vaccinators.\n\nBesides cow-pox the chief cattle-diseases are ph\u00e1nsi, khurkhut, and v\u00e1gchavda. When attacked with ph\u00e1nsi, which prevails in the hot months, especially in seasons of drought, the tongue becomes black and the veins on the tongue swell. Saliva runs freely, food is refused and the animal shortly dies. In khurkhut, which prevails during or immediately after the rains and which is less fatal than ph\u00e1nsi, the mouth and feet of the animal are affected and give an offensive smell. The rubbing of teakwood oil and making the animal stand in mud are the ordinary remedies. In v\u00e1gchavda the animal\u2019s body swells and saliva oozes from the mouth. The animal is branded and a tola or two of tiger\u2019s fat is given mixed with grass or bread.\n\nThe total number of deaths in the sixteen years ending 1881, as shown in the Sanitary Commissioner\u2019s yearly reports, is 245,326, or an average yearly mortality of 15,382, or seventeen per thousand. Of the average number of deaths 11,453, or 74\u00b76 per cent were returned as due to fevers, 1026 or 6\u00b76 per cent to cholera, 408 or 2\u00b76 per cent to small-pox, 375 or 2\u00b74 per cent to bowel complaints, and 1688 or 11\u00b70 per cent to miscellaneous diseases. Deaths from violence or accidents averaged 380 or 2\u00b74 per cent of the average mortality of the district. During the eleven years ending 1881 the number of births was returned at 190,050 souls or an average yearly birth-rate of 18,679 souls, or twenty per thousand.

It includes the petty-division of Umbargaon and encloses part of the Jawh\u00e1r state. It is bounded on the north by Surat and Daman, on the east by Daman Mokh\u00e1da and Jawh\u00e1r, on the south by Jawh\u00e1r and M\u00e1him, and on the west by the sea. Its area is 643 square miles, its population\u00b9 (1881) 109,322 or 170 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a312,684 (Rs. 1,26,840).\n\nThe whole of the 643 square miles are occupied by Government villages. They contain 178,323 acres or 48\u00b73 per cent of arable assessed land, 120,264 acres or 29\u00b72 per cent of arable unassessed, 42,990 acres or 10\u00b74 per cent of unarable, and 70,313 acres or 17\u00b708 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. Of the 298,587 arable acres 8624 are alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81, of the remaining 289,963 acres of arable Government land, 77,540 or 26\u00b77 per cent were under tillage.\n\nThe country is rolling and picturesque, most of the interior being occupied by forest-clad hills in small detached ranges of varying height. Towards the coast are broad flats, hardly above sea level and seamed by tidal creeks.\n\nThough pleasant and equable, the climate of the coast villages is feverish for two or three months after the rains, and, except in the hot weather, the interior is very unhealthy. During the ten years ending 1881, there was an average rainfall of sixty-three inches.\n\nThe sub-division is watered by four chief streams, the Damanganga in the north, the K\u00e1l\u00fa in the east, the Surya in the south, and the Varuli in the west. The supply of water is fair especially on the coast. In 1881-82 there were four river dams, 157 ponds, 685 wells eight with and 677 without steps, and 217 rivers streams and springs.\n\nThough the soil is said to be fit for garden tillage, garden crops are not grown to any great extent. Rice is the chief crop, but much n\u00e1chni is raised in the interior and the castor plant is common in the north.\n\nIn 1866-67, when the survey rates were introduced, 7853 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 7582 holdings with an average area of $22\\frac{3}{4}$ acres and an average rental of about \u00a31 14s. (Rs. 17). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of $5\\frac{1}{2}$ acres at a yearly rent of 8s. 8\u00bdd. (Rs. 4\u00b75\u00b78). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to 1\u00bd acres, and the incidence of the land tax to 2s. 4d. (Re. 1\u00b72\u00b78).\n\nIn 212 Government villages rates were fixed in 1863-64 and 1866-67 for thirty years in the petty-division of Umbargaon and\n\n\u00b9 The revised population (109,322) is about 700 more than the original total given above at p. 2.\nfor twenty-seven years in the sub-division of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu. The 158,669 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 4\u00bdd. (2 as. 11 ps.) for dry crop, 7s. 11\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-15-10) for garden land, and 4s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-7) for rice, yielded \u00a311,950 16s. (Rs. 1,19,508). The remaining 11,043 acres of arable waste was rated at \u00a3439 (Rs. 4390) and alienations at \u00a3702 16s. (Rs. 7028). Deducting alienations \u00a3702 16s. (Rs. 7028), and adding quit-rents \u00a3462 18s. (Rs. 4629) and grass lands \u00a326 18s. (Rs. 269), the total rental of the 212 villages amounted to \u00a312,879 14s. (Rs. 1,28,797).

It is bounded on the north by D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, on the east by Jawh\u00e1r and V\u00e1da, on the south by the Vaitarna and Bassein, and on the west by the sea. Its area is 419 square miles; its population (1881) 77,360\\(^1\\) or 184 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a311,765 (Rs. 1,17,650).\n\nOf 419 square miles, about nine miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 112,086 acres or 42\u00b77 per cent of arable land, 16,606 acres or 6\u00b73 per cent of unarable land, 18,406 acres or 7 per cent of grass or kuran, and 115,305 acres or 43\u00b79 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From the 112,086 arable acres fourteen acres of alienated land have to be taken. In 1880-81, of the balance of 112,072 acres of arable Government land, 43,281 or 38\u00b76 per cent were under tillage.\n\nA high range of forest-clad hills divides the sub-division from north to south, and until lately, when (1881) a good road was made through the Chah\u00e1d pass in the middle of the range, formed a barrier impassable to carts except for two miles north of Mah\u00e1gaoon. To the east of this range, and parallel to it, flows the Surya river till it falls into the Vaitarna. The north-east corner of the sub-division is full of high hills with jagged peaks, of which Asheri is the chief; in the south-east Takmak rises 2000 feet above the sea; the rest of the inland strip is a rolling country little raised above the level of the streams. The land to the west of the central range is low, flat, and broken by swamps and tidal creeks.\n\nOn the coast the climate is equable and pleasant, but in the interior the heat of the hot weather is intense. Especially during and after the rains the climate is unhealthy and feverish, both inland and on the coast. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged sixty-four inches.\n\nBeyond the tidal limit, the Vaitarna and the Surya rivers supply fresh water throughout the year. Elsewhere also the supply is\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (77,360) is about 470 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nM\u00e1h\u00edm.\n\nWater.\n\nThe Vaitarna rises in the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and meets the eastern boundary of the sub-division. It then runs north for about eight miles along the border, and enters the sub-division after it is joined by the Deherja at Teneh. From Teneh it takes a sudden bend south-west for eight miles till it is met by the Surya. After its junction with the Surya it runs south for about twelve miles, and, thence west along the border of the sub-division to the sea. It is navigable for good-sized native craft of twenty-five tons (100 khandis) to Manor twenty-five miles from its mouth. In the bend of the Vaitarna two ranges of forest-clad hills enclose a valley along which runs a streamlet. There is a hot spring on the bank of this streamlet at S\u00e1tivli, and another near S\u00e1ye ou the bank of the Vaitarna not far from Manor. In 1881-82 there were 270 ponds, 1284 wells nine with and 1275 without steps, and 154 rivers streams and springs.\n\nSoil.\n\nThe soil varies from red to black and sandy black. The staple crop is rice. The area of dry-crop land, including varkas or uplands, is larger than of rice land. N\u00e1chni and pulses are grown to some extent, and on the coast there is considerable garden cultivation of plantains and betel leaf. The palmyra-palm abounds everywhere.\n\nHoldings, 1879-80.\n\nIn 1862-63, when survey rates were introduced, 6846 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 6785 holdings with an average area of $12\\frac{1}{2}$ acres and an average rental of \u00a31 15s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs.17-8-10). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of $3\\frac{7}{10}$ acres at a yearly rental of 9s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-14-1). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ acres and the incidence of the land-tax to 3s. \u00bed. (Re.1-8-5).\n\nRental, 1879-80.\n\nIn 190 Government villages rates were fixed in 1862-63 for thirty years. The 77,272 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 3\u00bdd. (2 as. 7 ps.) for dry crop, Rs. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-1-9) for garden land, and 5s. 5d. (Rs. 2-11-4) for rice, yielded \u00a311,006 8s. (Rs. 1,10,064). The remaining 8115 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3331 4s. (Rs. 3312) and alienations at \u00a3860 (Rs. 8600). Deducting alienations \u00a3860 (Rs. 8600), and adding quit-rents \u00a3512 8s. (Rs. 5124) and grass lands \u00a360 18s.

Of the remaining 42,749 acres 532 were twice cropped. Of the 48,281 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 40,232 or 92\u00b795 per cent, of which 36,048 were under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 2014 under n\u00e1chni or r\u00e1gi Eleusine coracana, 1990 under kodra Paspalum scrobiculatum, and 180 under chenna Panicum miliaceum.

It is bounded on the north by the Jawh\u00e1r state and the Deherja river which separates it from part of Bassein, on the east by Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur, on the south by the T\u00e1nsa river which separates it from Bhiwndi, and on the west by the Vaitarna and the hilly country on its south bank which separate it from Bassein and M\u00e1him. Its area is 309 square miles, its population (1881)\n36,497 or 118 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a34895 (Rs. 48,950).\n\nOf its 309 square miles, about forty-two are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remaining 170,880 contain 56,688 acres or 33\u00b71 per cent of arable land; 19,286 acres or 11\u00b72 per cent of unarable land; 42,344 acres or 24\u00b77 per cent of village forests and pastures; 42,838 acres or 25\u00b71 per cent of Government forest; and 9724 acres or 5\u00b76 per cent of alienated land in Government villages. From 170,880 acres the total area of Government villages, 9724 acres have to be taken on account of the alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81, of the balance of 161,156 acres the area of Government land, 27,482 acres or 17\u00b705 per cent were under tillage.\n\nAlong the valley of the Vaitarna which divides the sub-division from north to south, the land is well cultivated and the villages are fairly numerous. The rest of the sub-division, especially in the north-west and the east, is very hilly and the population extremely scanty. There are no made roads, and, during the rains, the country tracks are impassable.\n\nFrom October to February the climate is exceedingly unhealthy, fever being rife in every village. In the hot weather abundant shade makes the climate less unpleasant than in some other parts of the district. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged ninety-four inches.\n\nIn the interior the supply of water from the Vaitarna and the Behya is constant and fair. In other parts, where it is obtained from wells, the supply is doubtful and the water bad. The Behya, taking its source in the hills of Mokh\u00e1da, flows into the Vaitarna near V\u00e1da after a winding south-westerly course of over fifty miles. The united waters of the Vaitarna and the Behya then flow into the sea under the name of Vaitarna. The rivers are nowhere navigable. In 1881-82 there were thirty-one ponds, 249 wells twelve with and 237 without steps, and 143 rivers streams and springs.\n\nRice is the chief crop, but n\u00e1chni tur and vari are also largely cultivated. Much gram is grown on the banks of the Vaitarna. The whole sub-division is wooded, the forests in some parts stretching for miles. The chief trees are teak, \u00e1in, moha, and khair.\n\nIn 1864-65, when the survey rates were introduced, 2311 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 3261 holdings with an average area of 28\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a32 2s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 21-0-9). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 6\u00be acres at a yearly rent of 10s. 1\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-1-0).

It is bounded on the north by the Vaitarna river and Mahim, on the east by V\u00e1da and Bhiwndi, on the south by the Th\u00e1na or Bassein creek, and on the west by the sea. Its area is 221 square miles, its population\u00b9 (1881) 68,967 or 312 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a312,671 (Rs. 1,26,710).\n\n**Area.**\n\nOf the 221 square miles 5\u00bd square miles are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 64,098 acres or 46\u00b74 per cent of arable land; 2559 acres or 2\u00b707 per cent of unarable land; 328 acres or 0\u00b724 per cent of grass or kur\u00e1n; and 70,635 acres or 51\u00b72 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From 137,920 acres, the total area of the Government villages, 2095 acres have to be taken on account of the alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81, of the balance of 135,825 acres the area of Government land, 36,541 or 26\u00b79 per cent were under tillage.\n\n**Aspect.**\n\nIn the centre of the sub-division is Tung\u00e1r hill, and south from it runs a high range, in which K\u00e1mandurg is conspicuous, separating Bassein from Bhiwndi. To the north-west of Tung\u00e1r are lower but considerable hills, of which the chief are Nilimora, Baronde, and Jivdhan. These hills vary in height from 1500 to 2000 feet. The country to the east and west of Tung\u00e1r is almost on the sea level, and is intersected on either side by important creeks navigable by boats of considerable size. The coast district is thickly peopled and abounds in large rich villages.\n\n**Climate.**\n\nOn the coast the climate is generally pleasant and equable, but at times it is very hot. Inland in the hot weather, the heat is great; and in the cold weather, the variation in temperature between day and night is great. In the rains, the weather is unhealthy and feverish, and towards the close of the hot weather cholera is of usual occurrence. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged 71\u00b787 inches.\n\n**Water.**\n\nThere are no important fresh-water streams and the supply from ponds and wells is poor. In 1881-82 there were 191 ponds, 2624 wells twenty-five with and the rest without steps, and forty rivers\n\n\u00b9 The revised population (68,967) is about 300 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nstreams and springs. Most of the wells are little better than holes, sometimes only a foot deep.\n\nThe soil varies from red to black and sandy black. In a narrow belt of coast land about three miles broad, the soil is a rich alluvial, with a good supply of water a few feet from the surface. When watered from wells worked by Persian wheels it is excellently suited for garden tillage, plantains sugarcane and coconuts being the chief products. In other parts the staple crop is rice and n\u00e1chni, some of the coast villages having fertile patches which grow tur and other late crops except gram.\n\nIn 1879-80 there were 8064 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s with an average area of 6\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a31 9s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 14-13-1). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 2\u00bd acres at a yearly rent of 12s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 6-1-7). If distributed among the whole population of the subdivision, the share to each would amount to \u00be of an acre and the incidence of the land tax to 3s. 5\u00bdd. (Re. 1-11-8).\n\nIn eighty-eight Government villages rates were fixed in 1861-62 for thirty years. The 46,011 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 1s. 1\u00bdd. (9 as 3 ps.) for dry crop, 10s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 5-1-9) for garden land, and 5s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-14-9) for rice, yielded \u00a311,568 16s. (Rs. 1,15,688). The remaining 1063 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a395 18s. (Rs. 959) and alienations at \u00a3757 6s. (Rs. 7573). Deducting alienations \u00a3757 6s. (Rs. 7573), and adding quit-rents \u00a3270 14s. (Rs. 2707) and grass lands \u00a310 2s. (Rs. 101), the total rental of the eighty-eight villages amounted to \u00a311,945 10s. (Rs. 1,19,455).

Of the remaining 36,081 acres, 460 were twice cropped. Of the 36,541 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 31,835 acres or 87.1 per cent, 29,587 acres of which were under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 1846 under n\u00e1chni Eleusine coracana, 64 under chenna Panicum miliaceum, and 338 under kodra.\nPaspalum scrobiculatum.

Its area is 250 square miles, its (1881) population 75,363\\(^1\\) or 301 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a313,925 (Rs. 1,39,250).\n\nOf its 250 square miles, twenty are occupied by the lands of either totally or partly alienated villages. The remainder contains 73,300 acres or 49\u00b78 per cent of arable land, 7259 acres or 4\u00b79 per cent of Government forests, and 66,641 acres or 45\u00b72 per cent of village pastures and forests. From 147,200 acres, the total area of Government villages, 854 have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81 of the balance of 146,346 acres the area of Government land, 49,950 acres or 34\u00b71 per cent were under tillage.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (75,363) is about 270 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nThe centre of the sub-division is well peopled and richly tilled. Except in the south, it is surrounded by the hills which form the water-shed of the river K\u00e1mv\u00e1di which runs through the sub-division from north to south. In the west the country is hilly and thinly peopled, but in the east along the Bh\u00e1tsa there is a tract of low-lying and well-tilled land. Except along the \u00c1gra road and a short branch from it, traffic is very difficult during the rainy season.\n\nIn the west, after the rains, the climate is feverish; other parts are generally healthy, less relaxing and freer from fever than Th\u00e1na. In the hot weather the temperature is moist and close, though the neighbourhood of the sea makes the south more pleasant than the inland parts. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged ninety-four inches at the town of Bhiwndi; it is heavier in the north-west where the hills are higher and more numerous.\n\nWater is fairly abundant. In the north the T\u00e1nsa supplies the villages along its banks throughout the year; in other parts, the supply is obtained from ponds and wells, but the water is far from wholesome. The chief rivers are the T\u00e1nsa, the K\u00e1mv\u00e1di, the Santanu, and the Karbhani. The K\u00e1mv\u00e1di is a shallow stream, at spring-tides navigable to small boats as far as Bhiwndi. It dries during the hot weather. In 1881-82 there were ninety ponds, two river dams, twelve water-lifts, 911 wells seventy with and the rest without steps, and 147 rivers streams and springs.\n\nRice is the chief product, though the coarse black soil is not particularly suited for its growth. Nachmi and vari are also grown in large quantities, and a small rabi or winter-crop is also raised. The hills, especially in the west, are well wooded, the chief trees being teak, blackwood, \u00e1in, and some varieties of palm. In villages near Bhiwndi pulses and vegetables are grown as a second crop in rice land by well irrigation. There is also a little salt rice-land.\n\nIn 1860-61, when survey rates were introduced, 7437 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 7433 holdings with an average area of $14\\frac{9}{10}$ acres and an average rental of \u00a31 17s. 11\u00bdd. (Rs. 18-15-6). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 4 acres at a yearly rent of \u00a31 14s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 17-4-6). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to $\\frac{1}{50}$ acres and the incidence of the land tax to 3s. 10\u00bdd. (Re.1-14-10).\n\nIn 192 Government villages rates were fixed in 1860-61 for thirty years. The 74,149 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 7\u00bdd. (4 as. 10 ps.) for dry crop, 2s. 9\u00bdd. (Re. 1-6-2) for garden land, and 7s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-10-10) for rice, yielded \u00a313,594 8s. (Rs. 1,35,944). The remaining 2169 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3297 12s. (Rs. 2976) and alienations at \u00a31423 14s. (Rs. 14,237). Deducting alienations \u00a31423 14s. (Rs. 14,237), and adding quit-rents \u00a3188 (Rs. 1880) and grass lands \u00a319 16s. (Rs. 198), the total rental of the 192 villages amounted to \u00a314,099 16s. (Rs. 1,40,998). The following statement gives the details:\n\nb 310\u201386\nIn 1881 75,363 people owned 2011 carts, 7637 ploughs, 11,139 oxen, 7607 cows, 9311 buffaloes, 81 horses, 18 asses, and 2077 sheep and goats.\n\nIn 1880-81, of 74,174 acres the total area of tilled land, 24,628 acres or 33\u00b72 per cent were fallow. Of the remaining 49,546 acres 404 were twice cropped.

It is a strip of country fifty miles long and from five to thirty miles broad, stretching in the east of the district below the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. It is bounded on the north by Daman Dharampur and Peint in N\u00e1sik, on the north-east by the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds which separate it from N\u00e1sik and Ahmadnagar, on the south by the K\u00e1l\u00fa and Sh\u00e1i rivers which separate it from Murb\u00e1d, and on the west by Jawh\u00e1r and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, V\u00e1da, Rhiwndi, and Kaly\u00e1n. Its area is 870 square miles, its (1881) population 107,729\\(^1\\) or 123 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a311,995 (Rs. 1,19,950).\n\nOf its 282 villages ten are alienated and unsurveyed. The rest contain an area of 543,384 acres or about 849 square miles, of which 250,871 acres or 46.1 per cent are arable land, 77,888 acres or 14.3 per cent are unarable, 13,820 acres or 2.5 per cent are Government forests, 175,398 acres or 32.5 per cent are village pastures and forests, 9660 acres or 1.7 per cent are grass lands or kurans, and 15,747 acres or 2.9 per cent are village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From the 250,871 acres of arable land 25,607 have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81 of the balance of 225,264 acres of arable Government land 98,289 acres 43.6 per cent were under tillage.\n\nSh\u00e1h\u00e1pur is very wild, broken by hills and covered with large forests. The openest parts are in the south, in P\u00e1ulb\u00e1ra, Konepatti, and Agayri, where are wide tracts of good rice lands. North of Konepatti and beyond the Vaitarna, the country gradually rises, the roads or paths are nearly impassable, and the ravines are steep. Towards Mokh\u00e1da, instead of broad rice fields, there are long waving uplands seamed by steep rocky ravines, the rice being almost confined to isolated patches in the bottoms of small streams. Further north the country is impassable except on foot, and rice is superseded by upland grains. The east near the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and the west near Jawh\u00e1r are rough with little rice tillage. The only made road is the Bombay-Agra road which passes north-east and south-west nearly on the same line as the Peninsula railway.\n\nThe climate is very unpleasant except in the rains when it is generally healthy. For four months after the rains fever prevails, and from March to June the heat is intense and oppressive. In some parts the climate is very injurious especially to Europeans; but Mokh\u00e1da, which is considerably above the level of the sea, has a climate little inferior to that of M\u00e1ther\u00e1n. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged 102 inches.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (107,729) is about 590 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nThe Vaitarna in the north, the Bh\u00e1t\u1e63a in the centre, and the K\u00e1l\u016b in the south supply water to the villages in their neighbourhood throughout the year. In the rest of the sub-division the people depend on wells and ponds whose water, though generally good, fails towards the close of the hot weather (May). In 1881-82 there were 42 ponds, one temporary and three permanent river dams, 612 wells fifty-one with and the rest without steps, and 368 rivers streams and springs.\n\nThe soil is mostly red and stony. The leading crops are rice, n\u00e1chni, vari, til, and khur\u00e1sni. Trees grow freely, chiefly teak, \u00e1in, mangoes, and moha.\n\nIn 1879-80 there were 8880 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s with an average area of 26 acres and an average rental of \u00a31 7s. 11d. (Rs. 13-15-4). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 6 acres at a yearly rent of \u00a31 6s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 13-1-7). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to 2\u00bd acres and the incidence of the land-tax to 2s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 1-3-0).\n\nIn 270 Government villages rates were fixed in 1864-65 and 1865-66 for twenty-six years for the sub-division of Sh\u00e1h\u00e1pur and ten years for the petty division of Mokh\u00e1da.\u00b9 The 207,813 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 3\u00bdd. (2 as. 1 pie) for dry crop, and 5s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 2-12-10) for rice, yielded \u00a310,793 16s. (Rs. 107,938). The remaining 17,900 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3511 8s. (Rs. 5114) and alienations at \u00a31537 14s. (Rs. 15,377). Deducting alienations \u00a31537 14s. (Rs. 15,377), and adding quit-rents \u00a3706 16s. (Rs. 7068) and grass lands \u00a353 18s. (Rs. 539), the total rental of the 270 villages amounted to \u00a312,065 18s. (Rs. 1,20,659).

The guarantee was extended for a year more and was to have expired in 1875-76.\n98,226 acres 63 were twice cropped. Of the 98,289 acres under tillage grain crops occupied 75,159 acres or 76\u00b74 per cent, 30,689 of which were under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 31,048 under n\u00e1chni or r\u00e1g\u00ed Eleusine coracana, and 13,422 under chenna Panicum miliaceum. Pulses occupied 14,364 acres or 14\u00b76 per cent, of which 40 acres were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 3661 under cajan pea tur Cajanus indicus, 221 under horse gram kulih Dolichos biflorus, 9571 under black gram udd Phascolus mungo, and 871 under other pulses. Oil-seeds occupied 8382 acres or 8\u00b75 per cent, all of which was under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum. Fibres occupied 330 acres or 0\u00b74 per cent, of which sixty were under Bombay hemp san Crotalaria juncea, and 270 under amb\u00e1di Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied fifty-four acres or 0\u00b705 per cent, all under garden produce, fruits and vegetables.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show, that of 107,729 people, 105,122 or 97\u00b758 per cent were Hindus, 2486 or 2\u00b730 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 93 Christians, 27 P\u00e1rsis, and 1 a Jew.

It is bounded on the north and northeast by the Bassein or Th\u00e1na creek, on the east by the Bassein or Th\u00e1na creek Kaly\u00e1n and Panvel, on the south by the Bombay harbour, and on the west by the sea. Its area is 241 square miles, its (1881) population 108,149\u00b9 or 448 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a315,330 (Rs. 1,53,300).\n\nOf its 241 square miles, about thirty-seven are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 79,486 acres or 60\u00b79 per cent of arable land, 13,223 acres or 10\u00b715 per cent of unarable land; 22,653 acres or 17\u00b73 per cent of forest and grass or\n\n\u00b9 The revised population (108,149) is about 900 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nS\u00e1lsette.\n\nAspect.\n\nkuran; and 14,912 acres or 11\u00b74 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From 130,274 acres, the total area of Government villages, 17,244 acres have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81 of the balance of 113,030 acres the actual area of Government land, 23,477 acres or 20\u00b77 per cent were under tillage.\n\nAlong the centre of the island from north to south runs a broad range of hills, gradually falling southwards till it sinks into the plain near Kurla, and, after a break, crops up again in the southernmost point of the island at Trombay.\n\nTowards the east along the foot of the hills, rough wood-lands are separated from the creeks and tidal swamps by a belt of rice land prettily wooded and well supplied with ponds. Spurs from the main range of central hills run west, towards the sea, from which they are separated by a wide plain broken by isolated hillocks. The low-lands are much intersected by tidal creeks, which, especially on the north-west, split the sea-face of S\u00e1lsette into many small islands.\n\nClimate.\n\nOn the west coast the climate is pleasant and equable. In Th\u00e1na the cold weather is agreeable, but the hot weather and the rains are oppressive. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly rainfall averaged ninety-eight inches.\n\nWater.\n\nThere are no large fresh-water streams. One of the largest carries the waste and escape water of the Veh\u00e1r lake southward into the M\u00e1him creek. Next to the Veh\u00e1r outlet is perhaps the stream which rises at the Kanheri caves and flowing north-west past Mandapeshvar falls into the Ves\u00e1va creek. The supply of water from wells is of fair quality and is pretty constant. In 1881-82 there were 294 ponds, one river dam, 2080 wells forty-six with and the rest without steps, and fifty-six rivers streams and springs.\n\nSoil.\n\nThe soil varies from red to black and sandy black. The staple crop is rice, except a small area which is given to n\u00e1chn\u00ed. Most of the uplands are reserved for grass for the Bombay market. The coast abounds in cocoa gardens, and the palmyra or brab-palm grows plentifully over most of the island.\n\nHoldings, 1879-80.\n\nIn 1879-80 there were 8808 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s with an average area of 6\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a31 12s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 16-1-11). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 2\u00bd acres at a yearly rent of 18s. \u00bdd. (Rs. 6-8-4). If distributed among the whole population, the share to each would amount to \u2154 of an acre and the incidence of the land-tax to 2s. 7\u00bdd. (Re. 1-5).\n\nRental, 1879-80.\n\nIn eighty-six Government villages rates were fixed in 1860-61 for thirty years. The 57,076 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 2s. 1\u00bdd. (Re. 1-0-9) for dry crop, 13s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 6-14-11) for garden lands, and 7s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-9-7) for rice, yielded \u00a316,773 12s. (Rs. 1,67,736). The remaining 735 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a31171 8s. (Rs. 11,714) and alienations at \u00a3976 (Rs. 9760). Deducting alienations \u00a3976 (Rs. 9760), and adding quit-rents \u00a3258 16s. (Rs. 2588) and grass lands \u00a346 6s. (Rs. 465), the total rental of the eighty-six villages amounted to \u00a318,250 2s. (Rs. 1,82,501). The following statement gives the details:\nIn 1881 108,149 people owned 2012 carts, 5853 ploughs, 10,098 oxen, 4901 cows, 5446 buffaloes, 236 horses, two asses, and 1187 sheep and goats.\n\nIn 1880-81, of 44,393 acres the total area of occupied land, 21,150 acres or 47\u00b76 per cent were fallow. Of the remaining 23,243 acres 284 acres were twice cropped. Of the 23,477 acres under tillage grain crops occupied 22,094 acres or 94\u00b71 per cent, 21,952 acres of which were under rice *bh\u00e1t* Oryza sativa, 131 under *udchhi* Eleusine coracana, and 11 under *chenna* Panicum miliaceum. Pulses occupied only three acres under black gram *udid* Phaseolus mungo. Fibres occupied 42 acres or 0\u00b72 per cent all under *amb\u00e1di* Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 1338 acres or 5\u00b77 per cent, of which 212 were under chillies *mirchi* Capsicum frutescens, and 1126 under vegetables and fruits and other garden crops. No oil-seeds were grown.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show, that of 108,149 people 75,624 or 69\u00b792 per cent were Hindus, 7036 or 6\u00b750 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 24,248 or 22\u00b742 per cent Christians, 948 or 0\u00b787 per cent P\u00e1rsis, and 293 or 0\u00b727 per cent Jews.

The rest contains 100,716 acres or 58\u00b78 per cent of arable land, 26,097 acres or 15\u00b72 per cent of unarable land, 12,285 acres or 7\u00b72 per cent of forest, and 32,262 acres or 18\u00b78 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From 100,716 acres the total arable area, 1783 acres have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81, of the balance of 98,933 acres the area of Government arable land, 42,108 acres or 42\u00b75 per cent were under tillage.\n\nAspect.\n\nThe sub-division is triangular in form, the narrowest tract or the vertex being in the north. The west is a rich open plain. In the south and east, ranges of hills, running parallel with the boundary line, throw out spurs into the heart of the sub-division. For the transport of produce Kaly\u00e1n has the advantage of the large tidal Ulh\u00e1s creek, and of the Peninsula railway to the Tal pass in the north-east and to the Bor pass in the south-east.\n\nClimate.\n\nExcept that the heat of April and May is accompanied by disagreeable east winds, and that fever is prevalent in the cold season, the climate of Kaly\u00e1n is fairly healthy and agreeable. The rainfall is uniform. During the ten years ending 1881 it averaged eighty-six inches.\n\nWater.\n\nKaly\u00e1n is watered by three rivers, the K\u00e1l\u00fa in the north flowing from east to west, the Ulh\u00e1s flowing through the sub-division from south to north, and the Bh\u00e1tsa, the largest of the three, flowing south-west along the northern boundary of the sub-division. The Bh\u00e1tsa receives the water of the two other streams not far from the head of the Th\u00e1na or Bassein creek. In the beds of these rivers water remains in pools throughout the year, but in other parts of the subdivision the want of water is seriously felt during the hot season. The K\u00e1l\u00fa is navigable to country craft of about ten tons as far as Pise Bandar about nine miles above Kaly\u00e1n, and boats of small tonnage get up the Bh\u00e1tsa as far as the village of V\u00e1sundre about ten miles from Kaly\u00e1n. In 1881-82 there were 107 ponds, 983 wells seventy-six with and the rest without steps, and 197 rivers streams and springs.\n\nSoil.\n\nThe prevailing soil is black, and the east, though rocky in parts, is excellent pasture land. A tract of land near Kaly\u00e1n, where rice is grown during the monsoon, has a second crop of onions, vegetables, and other garden produce, raised during the fair season by pond and well water.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (77,988) is about 330 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nIn 1858-59, when survey rates were introduced, 9196 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 9322 holdings, with an average area of 10\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a31 9s. 11\u00bdd. (Rs. 14-15-11). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 4\u00be acres at a yearly rent of 12s. 11\u00bdd. (Rs. 6-7-10). If distributed among the whole population, the share to each would amount to 1\u00bc acres and the incidence of the land-tax to 2s. 9\u00bdd. (Rs. 1-6-6).\n\nIn 221 Government villages rates were fixed in 1858-59 for thirty years. The 90,603 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 6\u00bdd. (4 as. 5 ps.) for dry crop, 6s. 11d. (Rs. 3-7-4) for garden lands, and 7s. 4d. (Rs. 3-10-8) for rice, yielded \u00a313,324 14s. (Rs. 1,33,247). The remaining 5595 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3285 12s. (Rs. 2856) and alienations at \u00a31437 2s. (Rs. 14,371). Deducting alienations \u00a31437 2s. (Rs. 14,371), and adding quit-rents \u00a320 14s. (Rs. 207) and grass lands \u00a33 (Rs. 30), the total rental of the 221 villages amounted to \u00a313,634 6s. (Rs. 1,36,343).

Of the remaining 41,604 acres 504 were twice cropped. Of the 42,108 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 37,843 acres or 89\u00b78 per cent, 32,576 of which were under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 3979 under n\u00e1chni Eleusine coracana, and 1288 under chenna Panicum miliaceum.

Its area is 351 square miles, its (1881) population 63,932 or 182 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a39060 (Rs. 90,600).\n\nArea.\n\nOf its 351 square miles 10\u00be are occupied by the lands of alienated or part-alienated villages. The remainder contains 127,495 acres or 58\u00b75 per cent of arable land, 16,498 acres or 7\u00b75 per cent of Government forests, 61,072 acres or 28\u00b704 per cent of public pastures and forest land, 7875 acres or 3\u00b76 per cent of grass or kuran, and 4820 acres or 2\u00b72 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river-beds. From 217,760 acres the total area of the Government villages, 341 acres have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81, of the balance of 217,419 acres the actual area of Government land, 51,550 acres or 23\u00b77 per cent were under tillage.\n\nAspect.\n\nMost of the sub-division is very hilly and is fairly wooded, though the trees are of no great size. The only large area of level land is in the east towards the foot of the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Murb\u00e1d is difficult of access, and suffers from the want of means of exporting its produce. The people are mostly Th\u00e1kurs, Kolis, and Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, the Th\u00e1kurs and Kolis being found in villages below the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds and the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s in the west.\n\nClimate.\n\nIn the hot weather, the climate is oppressive though not unhealthy, and after the rains and in the cold season it is very feverish. The rainfall in the villages near the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds is very heavy, but at\nMurb\u00e1d in the west it has averaged ninety inches during the ten years ending 1881.\n\nThe supply of water is scanty. Two chief rivers, the K\u00e1l\u00fa in the north and the Murb\u00e1di in the centre, pass through Murb\u00e1d. These rivers cease to run and the wells dry early in the hot season. The water supplied by wells is fairly good. In 1881-82 there were forty-three ponds, 565 wells fifty-nine with and the rest without steps, and 229 rivers streams and springs.\n\nThe soil of Murb\u00e1d is poor. The uplands are of little or no value except as supplying brushwood for manure. There is no market for the grass. The staple crop is rice, but small quantities of n\u00e1chni, vari, and til are also grown.\n\nIn 1879-80, 7180 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded with an average area of 14\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a31 5s. 3\u00bdd. (Rs. 12-12-5). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 4\u00bd acres at a yearly rent of 7s. 4\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-10-9). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to 1\u00be acres and the incidence of the land-tax to 8s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 1-9-11).\n\nIn 170 Government villages rates were fixed in 1859-60 for thirty years. The 101,679 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 4\u00bd. (2as. 8ps.) for dry crop, and 6s. 2\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-1-4) for rice, yielded \u00a38750 4s. (Rs. 87,502). The remaining 6049 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3186 (Rs. 1860) and alienations at \u00a3498 10s. (Rs. 4985). Deducting alienations \u00a3498 10s. (Rs. 4985), and adding quit-rents \u00a3213 8s. (Rs. 2134) and grass lands \u00a312 6s. (Rs. 123), the total rental of the 170 villages amounted to \u00a39161 18s. (Rs. 91,619).

Its area is 307 square miles, its (1881) population 101,181\\(^1\\) or 329\u00b76 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a319,814 (Rs. 1,98,140).\n\nOf 307 square miles, 91 are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 76,691 acres or 55\u00b74 per cent of arable land; 8959 acres or 6\u00b75 per cent of unarable land; 39,132 acres or 28\u00b73 per cent of forest land; 4021 acres or 2\u00b79 per cent of salt land; 6926 acres or 5\u00b701 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds; and 2512 acres or 1\u00b78 per cent of surveyed alienated land in Government villages. From 138,241 acres the total area of the Government villages, 2512 acres have to be taken on account of alienated land in Government villages. In 1880-81 of the balance of 135,729 acres the actual area of Government land, 49,830 acres or 36\u00b77 per cent were under tillage.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (101,181) is about 2700 more than the original total given above at page 2.\nPanvel has along its eastern boundary the lofty B\u00e1va Malang, M\u00e1ther\u00e1n, and Prabal ranges, and the M\u00e1nikgad range on the southeast. It is traversed from north (Ulva) to south (S\u00e1i) by the Karn\u00e1la or Funnel Hill range which is almost denuded of forest, while on either side of the creek, which separates Uran from the sub-division, lie extensive salt-rice lands reclaimed from the sea and very extensive salt pans. In the Uran petty division there is another but lower range of hills.\n\nPanvel has many natural advantages. Its sea-board gives it the command of water carriage to Bombay, and the K\u00e1lundri and P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga which partly enclose the sub-division, and numerous other navigable streams and creeks which intersect the salt-rice lands, afford easy water carriage, while the Bombay-Poona road supplies excellent land communication.\n\nThe climate, though damp and unhealthy for Europeans, is temperate except in the hot weather when it is extremely warm. Cholera prevails at times in the hot weather and in the rains; and there is much fever during the cold months. The rainfall is abundant and regular, averaging over 100 inches. During the ten years ending 1881 the yearly fall averaged 107 inches.\n\nSeveral small streams flow down the western slopes of the M\u00e1ther\u00e1n hills and gather into the K\u00e1lundri river. At Panvel, nine miles from the sea, the K\u00e1lundri meets the tide and below Panvel it is navigable for boats of thirty tons at high tides. In the extreme south the P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga with a winding westerly course falls into the south-east corner of the Bombay harbour. It is navigable for boats of twenty-five tons as far as S\u00e1i about six miles from its mouth, and for boats of twelve tons as far as Apta eight miles above S\u00e1i. Panvel, Ghota, P\u00e1la, Gulsunda, and Vindhane depend on their streams for their supply of water, which, except at Gulsunda where it is abundant, becomes scanty in the hot weather. The water of most of the wells and ponds also fails towards the end of the hot season. In 1881-82, there were 195 ponds, four river dams, 898 wells ninety-three with and 805 without steps, and 179 rivers streams and springs.\n\nThe soil is red, a little stony, and moderately rich. Rice is the staple crop, but n\u00e1chni and vari are also grown. In the west the soil is salt and much salt rice is grown. The kh\u00e1rs or salt-rice lands are of two kinds, the red soils in the inland parts under the hills and the black soils which cover a much larger area near the coast and creek banks.\n\nIn 1856-57, when the survey rates were introduced, 12,930 holdings or khat\u00e1s were recorded. In 1879-80 there were 13,105 holdings, with an average area of 6\u00bd acres and an average rental of \u00a31 8s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs.14-3-7). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 2\u00bd acres at a yearly rent of 12s. 10\u00bdd. (Rs. 6-6-10). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to \u00bd of an acre and the incidence of the land-tax to 3s. 10\u00bdd. (Re. 1-15-3).\nChapter XIII.\n\nSub-divisions.\n\nPanvel.\n\nRental, 1879-80.\n\nIn 238 Government villages rates were fixed in 1856-57 and 1866-67, for thirty years for the sub-division of Panvel and twenty years for the petty-division of Uran. The 83,864 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 8\u00bdd. (5 as. 7 ps.) for dry crop, 8s. 7\u00bdd. (Rs. 4-5-1) for garden lands, and 7s. 6\u00bdd. (Rs. 3-12-2) for rice, yielded \u00a317,946 10s. (Rs. 1,794,465). The remaining 4766 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3593 2s. (Rs. 5931) and alienations at \u00a33730 18s. (Rs. 37,309). Deducting alienations \u00a33730 18s. (Rs. 37,309), and adding quit-rents \u00a3381 (Rs. 3810) and grass lands \u00a326 (Rs. 260), the total rental of the 238 villages amounted to \u00a318,946 12s. (Rs. 1,89,466).

Of the remaining 49,466 acres 364 were twice cropped. Of the 49,830 acres under tillage, grain crops occupied 46,535 or 93\u00b74 per cent, 43,936 of which were under rice bh\u00e1t Oryza sativa, 1859 under n\u00e1chni Eleusine coracana, and 740 under chenna Panicum miliaceum. Pulses occupied 2382 acres or 4\u00b77 per cent, of which 1868 were under gram harbhara Cicer arietinum, 10 under cajan pea tur Cajanus indicus, 16 under green gram mug Phaseolus radiatus, 124 under black gram udid Phaseolus mungo, and 364 under other pulses. Oilseeds occupied 434 acres or 0\u00b78 per cent, all of it under gingelly seed til Sesamum indicum. Fibres occupied 29 acres or 0\u00b705 per cent all under amb\u00e1di Hibiscus cannabinus. Miscellaneous crops occupied 450 acres or 0\u00b79 per cent, of which 16 were under sugarcane us Saccharum officinarum, and 434 under fruits vegetables and other garden crops.\n\nPeople, 1881.\n\nThe 1881 population returns show, that of 101,181 people 94,144 or 93\u00b704 per cent were Hindus, 5920 or 5\u00b785 per cent Musalm\u00e1ns, 500 or 0\u00b749 per cent Jews, 486 or 0\u00b748 per cent Christians, and 131 or 0\u00b712 per cent P\u00e1rsis. The details of the Hindu castes are: 3476 Br\u00e1hmans; 904 K\u00e1yasth Pr\u00e1bhus, and 101 P\u00e1t\u00e1ne Pr\u00e1bhus, writers; 1123 V\u00e1nis, 328 Jains, 166 Loh\u00e1ns, and 72 Ling\u00e1yats, traders; 41,992 \u00c1gris, 16,177 Kunbis, 749 M\u00e1lis, 106 K\u00e1m\u00e1th\u00eds, 69 Vanj\u00e1r\u00eds, and 51 Ch\u00e1rans, husbandmen and gardeners; 132 Telis, oil-pressers; 39 Rang\u00e1r\u00eds, dyers; 25 S\u00e1lis, weavers; 1143\nSon\u00e1rs, gold and silver smiths; 662 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 484 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 358 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 211 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle-sellers; 173 Shimp\u00eds, tailors; 171 Beld\u00e1rs and 9 P\u00e1tharvats, stone-masons; 15 T\u00e1mbats, coppersmiths; 75 Guravvs, temple servants; 26 Ghadshis, singers; 5 Bh\u00e1ts, bards; 664 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 124 Parits, washermen; 411 Dhangars, shepherds; 315 Gaylis, milk-sellers; 147 Bhois, river-fishers; 118 Kh\u00e1rvis, sailors; 629 Bhand\u00e1ris and 316 K\u00e1lans, palm-juice drawers; 372 Pardeshis, messengers; 207 Buruds, bamboo-workers; 24 Ghas\u00e1dis, tinkers; 8 Kh\u00e1tiks, butchers; 8 Halv\u00e1\u00eds sweetmeat-makers; 6 Lodhis, labourers; 7636 Konkanis, 4309 K\u00e1thkaris, 3611 Th\u00e1kurs, 887 Bhils, 107 Vadars and 29 K\u00e1ik\u00e1dis, early tribes; 1092 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs, leather-workers; 4429 Mh\u00e1rs and 71 M\u00e1ngs, village servants; 29 Bhangis, scavengers; 77 Gos\u00e1vis and Bair\u00e1gis, 76 Jangams, 70 Gondhlis, 28 Bhar\u00e1dis, and 2 Chitrakathis, religious beggars and wanderers.\n\nKarjat, in the south-east of the district, includes the petty-division of Kh\u00e1l\u00e1pur. It is bounded on the north by Kaly\u00e1n and Murb\u00e1d, on the east by the Sahy\u00e1dris which separate it from the M\u00e1val subdivision of Poona, on the south by Pen in Kol\u00e1ba, and on the west by the M\u00e1ther\u00e1n hills and Panvel. Its area is 353 square miles, its (1881) population 82,063\\(^1\\) or 232 to the square mile, and its (1880) land revenue \u00a312,061 (Rs. 1,20,610).\n\nOf its 353 square miles, thirty-two are occupied by the lands of alienated villages. The remainder contains 81,203 acres or 39\u00b74 per cent of arable land, 50,522 acres or 24\u00b75 per cent of unarable land, 46,476 acres or 22\u00b76 per cent of forest, and 27,239 acres or 13\u00b72 per cent of village sites, roads, ponds, and river beds. From 81,203 arable acres, 515 the area of alienated land in Government villages has to be taken. In 1880-81, of the balance of 80,688 acres the area of arable Government land, 41,476 acres or 51\u00b74 per cent were under tillage.\n\nKarjat is the rough hilly tract between the Sahy\u00e1dris and the M\u00e1ther\u00e1n hills. Along its northern side, the country is prettily diversified with hills and dales, the low lands divided into rice fields and the higher grounds covered with teak, \u00e1in, and other common forest trees and a little blackwood. Towards the east, near the Sahy\u00e1dris the country becomes very rugged, the woodlands thicken into forest, and the flat rice grounds disappear.\n\nThe climate varies greatly at different seasons. In January and February the nights and early mornings are sometimes excessively cold, and in the hot months, except on the hill tops, the heat is most oppressive. During the ten years ending 1881 the rainfall averaged 121 inches.\n\nThe Ulh\u00e1s, with the Dh\u00e1vri Chil\u00e1r Posri and other tributaries, and the P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga have their source near the Bor pass in the Sahy\u00e1dris and flow, the Ulh\u00e1s with a northerly and the P\u00e1t\u00e1lganga with a north-westerly course. Except in p\u00f3ols these streams are\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The revised population (82,063) is about 1900 more than the original total given above at page 2.\ndry during the hot season. The rainfall though usually less than in Th\u00e1na is generally sufficient, and a failure of the rice crop is rare. But the storage of water is defective, and during the hot season the supply of drinking water is very scanty. In 1881-82 there were eighty-six ponds, three river dams, 642 wells seventy-five with and the rest without steps, and 302 rivers streams and springs.\n\nThe rice soil is a sticky black, richer than most of the district except Panvel. The uplands are reddish. The staple crops are rice, n\u00e1chni and vari.\n\nIn 1879-80 11,287 holdings or kh\u00e1t\u00e1s were recorded, with an average area of 6\\(\\frac{9}{10}\\) acres and an average rental of \u00a31 1s. 3\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. (Rs. 10-10-6). If equally divided among the agricultural population, these holdings would represent an allotment of 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) acres at a yearly rent of 14s. 9\\(\\frac{5}{8}\\)d. (Rs. 7-6-5). If distributed among the whole population of the sub-division, the share to each would amount to one acre and the incidence of the land-tax to 3s. 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)d. (Re. 1-8-11).\n\nIn 273 Government villages rates were fixed in 1854-55 and 1855-56 for thirty years. The 75,762 occupied acres, at average acre rates of 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (1 anna 5 pies) for dry crop, 1s. 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)d. (15 as.) for garden land, and 7s. 3d. (Rs. 3-10) for rice, yielded \u00a311,688 8s. (Rs. 1,16,884). The remaining 484 acres of arable waste were rated at \u00a3159 12s. (Rs. 1596) and alienations at \u00a3941 (Rs. 9410). Deducting alienations \u00a3941 (Rs. 9410), and adding quit-rents \u00a3173 6s. (Rs. 1733) and grass lands \u00a314 8s. (Rs. 144), the total rental of the 278 villages amounted to \u00a312,035 14s.

The details of the Hindu castes are 2652 Br\u00e1hmans; 530 K\u00e1yasth Prabhus, writers; 817 V\u00e1nis, 159 Jains, and 68 Ling\u00e1yats, traders; 29,326 Kunbis, 10,194 \u00c1gr\u00eds, 199 Vanj\u00e1ris, 113 M\u00e1l\u00eds, 49 Ch\u00e1rans, 30 K\u00e1m\u00e1th\u00eds, and 7 Hetk\u00e1ris, husbandmen; 567 Tal\u00eds, oil-pressers; 61 Koshtis, weavers; 30 S\u00e1l\u00eds, weavers; 6 Khatris, weavers; 2 Sangars, blanket-makers; 673 Son\u00e1rs, gold and silver smiths; 509 Kumbh\u00e1rs, potters; 337 Loh\u00e1rs, blacksmiths; 212 Shimpis, tailors; 203 Beld\u00e1rs and 16 P\u00e1tharvats, stone masons; 158 Sut\u00e1rs, carpenters; 114 K\u00e1s\u00e1rs, bangle-sellers; 55 K\u00e1t\u00e1ris, turners; 9 T\u00e1mbats, coppersmiths; 215 Gur\u00e1ys, temple servants; 15 Bh\u00e1ts, bards; 12 Bhorpis, mimics; 11-Ghadshis, singers; 560 Nh\u00e1vis, barbers; 235 Parits, washermen; 629 Dhang\u00e1rs, shepherds; 516 Gavlis, milk-sellers; 240 Bhois, river-fishers; 425 K\u00e1lans and 61 Bhand\u00e1r\u00eds, palm-juice drawers; 246 Pardeshis, messengers; 86 Bur\u00fads, bamboo-workers; 20 Ghis\u00e1dis, tinkers; 17 Kh\u00e1t\u00edks, butchers; and one Halv\u00e1i, sweetmeat-maker; 8616 Th\u00e1kurs, 6586 K\u00e1thkar\u00eds, 3719 Konkan\u00eds, 48 Vadars, and one Bhil, early tribes; 927 Ch\u00e1mbh\u00e1rs and 80 Mochis, leather-workers; 7159 Mh\u00e1rs and 107 M\u00e1ngs, village servants; 41 Dheds, sweepers; 11 Bhangis, scavengers; 190 Gos\u00e1vis and Bair\u00e1g\u00eds, 65 Jangams, 71 Bhar\u00e1dis, 34 Gondhlis, 13 Kolh\u00e1tis, and 5 V\u00e1sudevs, religious beggars and wanderers.\nJAWH\u00c1R.\n\nThe petty state of Jawh\u00e1r in Th\u00e1na lies between $19^\\circ 43'$ and $20^\\circ 5'$ north latitude and $72^\\circ 55'$ and $73^\\circ 20'$ east longitude. It has an area of about 500 square miles,\\(^1\\) a population, according to the 1881 census, of about 48,000 souls or ninety to the square mile, and for the five years ending 1880, an average yearly revenue of nearly \u00a310,000 (Rs. 1,00,000).\n\nJawh\u00e1r is surrounded by Th\u00e1na, D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and Mokh\u00e1da lie on the north, Mokh\u00e1da on the east, V\u00e1da on the south, and D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and M\u00e1him on the west. Most of the state is a plateau raised about 1000 feet above the Konkan plain. Except towards the south and west where it is somewhat level, the country is hilly and rocky with numerous rivers streams and large forests. Its chief streams are the Deharji, the Surya, the Pinjali, and the V\u00e1gh. Except the V\u00e1gh which flows into the Damanganga these streams fall into the Vaitarna. The Deharji and the Surya have their sources in Jawh\u00e1r, and the Pinjali rises in the Shir pass near Khod\u00e1le and forms the southern boundary of the state. The V\u00e1gh rises below Vatvad and flows north, forming the eastern boundary of the state. The lands of Jawh\u00e1r are distributed over three sub-divisions, or mah\u00e1ls, Malv\u00e1da with an area of about 150 square miles and a population of nearly 20,000 souls, Kariyat Haveli with 360 square miles and nearly 25,000 inhabitants, and Ganj\u00e1d with 30 square miles and nearly 5000 inhabitants.\n\nAt Jawh\u00e1r, which is on a tableland, the water-supply is defective, the springs in the neighbouring valleys being small and much below the level of the town. The Chief has improved the water-supply by enlarging the Surya reservoir and by embanking a low piece of ground. Both these works are (1882) in progress.\n\nThough from its height above the sea it is decidedly cooler than the rest of Th\u00e1na, the Jawh\u00e1r climate is variable and feverish. A heavy rainfall, lasting from June to October and averaging about 120 inches,\\(^1\\) is followed by nearly three months of damp weather, warm at first, and later on often chilly. After December comes a gradual change, until, in February or March, the hot season sets in. The heat is great in the lower villages, but on the raised plateau on which Jawh\u00e1r stands it is less severe than in other parts of Th\u00e1na. The climate in the hot-weather is like that of Mokh\u00e1da and N\u00e1sik, the nights being always cool. No record of thermometer readings has been kept.\n\n\\(^1\\) In Mr. Mulock's opinion the area of the state is about 300 square miles.\n\n\\(^2\\) The details are, 1873, 85\u00b016'; 1874, 122\u00b094'; 1875, 143\u00b043'; 1876, 105\u00b01'; 1877, 62\u00b027'; 1878, 180\u00b067'; 1879, 131\u00b055'; 1880, 119\u00b028'; 1881, 111\u00b016'.\nExcept good building stone, nothing is known about the Jawh\u00e1r minerals. The chief forest trees are teak, *sag*, Tectona grandis; blackwood, *sisam*, Dalbergia sissoo; *khair*, Acacia catechu; *ain*, Terminalia tomentosa; *palas*, Butea frondosa; *tivas*, Ougeinia dalbergioides; *kalam*, Stephegyne parvifolia; *\u00e1sam*, Briedelia retusa; and *hed*, Nauclea cordifolia. Though the reckless forest management of former Chiefs has left few trees fit for cutting, there is no village without its forest. The timber season begins about November and closes before the rains set in. The bulk of the timber is carried to Manor in the M\u00e1him sub-division, and thence shipped to Gogha. Traders are allowed to cut timber under a permit. When leave is given, twenty-five per cent of the fees are recovered at once, and an agreement made regarding the time for cutting and carrying away the timber. After the trees are cut, they are inspected by the *mah\u00e1lkari*, the head sub-divisional revenue officer, and, when he is satisfied that the agreement has been properly carried out, the timber is allowed to be taken away. During the fair season, tolls or *n\u00e1kh\u00e1s* are set at suitable points along the chief timber routes, and the cartmen's permits are examined. Including a charge of 6d. (as. 4) for marking, a cart of timber has to pay 6s. 9d. (Rs. 3-6), either for one trip or for as many trips as it can make during the eight months.\n\nIn 1878 an attempt was made to introduce some system into the forest cuttings by fixing, in each year, the parts of the forest in which cutting may go on. The forest establishment, consisting of one inspector and two peons, is kept up only during the eight working months. In 1881 the forest receipts amounted to \u00a38290 (Rs. 82,900) and the charges to \u00a3158 (Rs. 1580). The Domestic Animals are cows, buffaloes, bullocks, sheep, and horses. The cows vary in price from \u00a31 to \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 10-Rs. 25) and the he-buffaloes from \u00a32 to \u00a35 (Rs. 20-Rs. 50). Of Wild Animals there are the Tiger, *v\u00e1gh*, Felis tigris; the Panther, *bibla*, Felis pardus; the Bear, *ashval*, Ursus labiatus; the Hy\u00e6na, *taras*, Hy\u00e6na striata; the Fox, *khokad* or *lokri*, Vulpes bengalensis; the Jackal, *kotha*, Canis aureus; the *sambhar*, Rusa aristotelis; the Spotted Deer, *chital*, Axis maculatus; the Barking Deer, *bhelkar*, Cervulus aureus; and the Wild Dog, *kolsunda*, Cuon rutilans.\n\nAccording to the 1861 census the population was 48,556 of whom 47,964 were Hindus, 501 were Musalm\u00e1ns, and ninety-one were Christians, P\u00e1rsis, and Others. Of the total number of 48,556 souls, 25,174 or 51\u00b78 per cent were males and 23,382 or 48\u00b71 per cent were females. In 1881 there were 116 villages of which 102 had less than 1000 inhabitants, eleven had between 1000 and 2000, and three between 2000 and 3000. There were also 9375 houses of which 8307 were occupied and 1068 unoccupied. Of 48,556 the total population 41,095 (20,895 males, 20,200 females) or 84\u00b763 per cent were early tribes. Of the early tribes 21,816 (11,135 males, 10,681 females) or 53\u00b708 per cent of the whole were V\u00e1rlis; 7671 (3873 males, 3798 females) Th\u00e1kurs; 3246 (1659 males, 1587 females) K\u00e1thkaris or K\u00e1thodis, and 8362 (4228 males, 4134 females) other early tribes. Besides the early tribes there were 5943 (2941 males, 3002 females) Kolis, 4773 (2706 males, 2067 females) Kunbis, and 6869 (3891 males, 2978 females) other Hindus.\nThe people especially the V\u00e1rlis are poor. Their staple food is rice and n\u00e1chni; their clothing is coarse and scanty. A few well-to-do families wear silver ornaments, and one or two wear gold ornaments. But the ornaments of most of the people are of brass and copper, and those of the poorest are of wood. They keep the same holidays as other Th\u00e1na Hindus, and at their festivals freely indulge in liquor and flesh. The Kolis are of four divisions, R\u00e1j Kolis, Mah\u00e1dev Kolis, Malh\u00e1r Kolis, and Dhor Kolis. The R\u00e1j Kolis are Mah\u00e1dev Kolis, who have taken the name R\u00e1j Kolis because they are connected with the Chief. The Dhor Kolis are said to have been R\u00e1j or Malh\u00e1r Kolis, who became Dhor or cattle eaters and married K\u00e1thkari girls, and so have fallen to the rank of Mh\u00e1rs and K\u00e1thkaris. The Th\u00e1kurs, who are like R\u00e1j and Malh\u00e1r Kolis in their habits and dress, are of two main divisions, Ma-Th\u00e1kurs and Ka-Th\u00e1kurs. Ma-Th\u00e1kurs call a Br\u00e1hman to their marriages; Ka-Th\u00e1kurs call no Br\u00e1hman. The Ka-Th\u00e1kurs are said formerly to have called a Br\u00e1hman and to have given up the practice, because at a wedding both the bride and the bridegroom died soon after the Br\u00e1hman had finished the ceremony. This seems improbable as in other respects, such as visiting sacred shrines and bathing in sacred pools, the Ma-Th\u00e1kurs are much better Hindus than the Ka-Th\u00e1kurs. Of the origin of the two names Ma-Th\u00e1kur and Ka-Th\u00e1kur, the people seem to have no explanation. According to one story both speak a stammering Mar\u00e1thi, the M\u00e1s putting in a meaningless m and the K\u00e1s a meaningless k. The Kunbis, who are generally called Konkani Kunbis or Kunbis from the southern Konkan, are like the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. In their habits and religion they resemble the R\u00e1j Kolis and are less wild than the V\u00e1rlis and K\u00e1thodis. They are good husbandmen. The V\u00e1rlis are strict Hindus like the R\u00e1j and Malh\u00e1r Kolis, Th\u00e1kurs, and Kunbis. They worship the ordinary gods, but do not call a Br\u00e1hman to their marriages. They are idle and fond of wandering. They are poor husbandmen and almost penniless. The K\u00e1thkaris, or K\u00e1thodis as they are more often called, like the Dhor Kolis, eat cow\u2019s flesh and worship the tiger-god.\n\nInquiries during the first management of the state (1859-1864) brought to light a curious form of vassalage, which was common in the establishment of most large Mar\u00e1tha families. There were about eighty state vassals, the bondsmen called d\u00e1ses and the bondswomen d\u00e1s\u00eds. These people were said to be the offspring of women who had been found guilty of adultery, and in punishment had been made slaves of the state and their boys called d\u00e1s and their girls d\u00e1s\u00ed. These vassals did service in the Chief\u2019s household and were supported at his expense. All children of a d\u00e1s and the sons of a d\u00e1s\u00ed were free and had to provide for themselves, so that the number of vassals never became very large.\n\nExcept in Malv\u00e1da and Ganj\u00e1d the soil is stony and unsuited for the better class of crops. From the hilly nature of the country most of the fields are uplands, or varkas, and over a good deal of the area the tillage system is dalhi, or sowing seed in wood ashes. The chief crops raised are rice, bh\u00e1t, Oryza sativa; n\u00e1chni or n\u00e1gli, Eleusine coracana; hemp, t\u00e1g, Crotalaria juncea; and gram, Cicer arietinum,\nin the better class of soil in Malv\u00e1da and Ganj\u00e1d. Among the husbandmen R\u00e1j Kolis, Malh\u00e1r Kolis, Th\u00e1kurs, and Kunbis are fairly off, but V\u00e1rlis, Dhor Kolis, and K\u00e1thkaris are very poor. There is no regular market. The state buys every year a quantity of tobacco for distribution during the rains to each landholder, and recovers the price at a fixed rate along with the instalments of land revenue. The wages of field labourers are very low, being 8s. (Rs. 4) a month; but the wages of craftsmen are high, being from 2s. to 3s. (Re.1-Rs.1\u00bd) a day for a carpenter and a mason. In 1877, owing to the failure of crops, one-fourth of the assessment in the Ganj\u00e1d and one-eighth in the Malv\u00e1da sub-division were remitted. In 1876 the practice of fixing the market prices of articles, and, in 1877, the practice of exacting forced labour were stopped.\n\nTrade.\n\nIn so wild and rugged a country communication is difficult. Eastward the S\u00e1hy\u00e1dris can be crossed by laden bullocks and horses through the Chinchut\u00e1ra and Gonde passes to the north of, and through the Dhondm\u00e1re and Shir passes to the south of, the high hill of Vatvad. These routes lie through Mokh\u00e1da, and, owing to the hilly nature of the ground and the deep rocky banks of the V\u00e1gh river, the difficulties to traffic are very great. How great these obstacles are is shown by the fact that, except one or two in Mokh\u00e1da town, there is not a cart in the Mokh\u00e1da sub-division. Occasionally carts bring timber through the Tal\u00e1sari pass, and in this direction the produce of the state finds an outlet towards Peint, and Nagar-Haveli in Dharampur. The westerly route, about thirty-five miles from Jawh\u00e1r to the D\u00e1h\u00e1nu railway station, crosses the K\u00e1satv\u00e1di and Deng passes by a well-engineered and metalled road, built between 1872 and 1874 by the public works department, during the minority of the present Chief at a cost of \u00a39500 (Rs.95,000). The making of twenty-five miles of the road in D\u00e1h\u00e1nu was begun and stopped until some arrangement could be concluded for taking off the heavy transit dues levied, in the detached Jawh\u00e1r sub-division of Ganj\u00e1d, on goods passing from the eastern or inland portion of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu to the sea coast. The Chief proposed to forego all dues on traffic passing along the new road, provided Government made and repaired the road to the west of Talavali and forewent their right to levy tolls. This arrangement has been sanctioned.\u00b9\n\nExport and transit dues on British goods are levied in thirty-two places in Jawh\u00e1r. Almost no article escapes untaxed. The rates on grain vary from 1s. 4\u00bdd. to 1s. 6d. (annas 11-12) a bullock cart; the rates on cattle are 1s. 3d. (annas 10) a head, those on timber from 6d. to 1s. (annas 4-8) a cart, and those on liquor, hides, and moha, from 9d. to 3s. (annas 6-Rs.1\u00bd) a bullock cart. A high line of hills runs parallel to the sea coast from opposite Sanj\u00e1n to the south of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu, and the roads across these hills pass through J\u00e1mshet, Kar\u00e1doho, or Aine in the Ganj\u00e1d sub-division. All timber and grain from the east of D\u00e1h\u00e1nu have to pass one of these tolls on their way to S\u00e1vta near D\u00e1h\u00e1nu or to the railway. The heavy dues\n\n\u00b9 Bom. Gov. Res. 4470 of the 19th September 1881, and India Gov. Letter 1096 of 2nd September 1881.\nformerly gave rise to many complaints and much correspondence, especially from the forest department. The yearly average exports of grain have been roughly calculated at 1500 to 2000 khandis, and the average annual receipts from export duties at \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000), a very heavy demand which seriously cripples the trade of the state.\n\nUp to the first Muhammadan invasion of the Deccan (1294) the greater part of the northern Konkan was held by Koli and V\u00e1rli chiefs. Jawh\u00e1r was held by a V\u00e1rli chief and from him it passed to a Koli named Paupera. According to the Kolis' story, Paupera who was apparently called Jayaba, had a small mud fort at Mukne near the Tal pass. Once when visiting a shrine at Pimpri, he was blessed by five Koli mendicants and saluted as the ruler of Jawh\u00e1r. Paupera thereupon collected a body of Kolis, marched northwards, and was acknowledged by the people of Peint and Dharampur. He went to Surat and as far north as K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r where he remained for seven years. On his return from K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r he went to Jawh\u00e1r and asked the V\u00e1rli chief to give him as much land as the hide of a bullock could cover. The V\u00e1rli chief agreed, but when the hide was cut into fine shreds or strips, it enclosed the whole of the V\u00e1rli chief's possessions. Gambhirgad about twelve miles north-west of Jawh\u00e1r and the country round were given to the V\u00e1rli chief, and Paupera became the sole master of Jawh\u00e1r.\n\nPaupera had two sons, Nemsh\u00e1h and Holkarr\u00e1v. Nemsh\u00e1h the elder succeeded to the chiefship on Jayaba's death, and, about the middle of the fourteenth century (1343), was given the title of Sh\u00e1h and recognized by the Delhi Emperor as chief of a tract of land containing about twenty-two forts and yielding a revenue of \u00a390,000 (Rs. 9,00,000). So important was this in the history of Jawh\u00e1r that the 5th of June 1343, the day on which Nemsh\u00e1h received the title of Sh\u00e1h from the Delhi Emperor, was made the beginning of a new era. This era which at present (1882) is 540 is still used in public documents. In the fifteenth century, during the time of their highest prosperity, the territories of the Ahmadabad kings stretched as far south as N\u00e1gothna and Chaul, and they probably held most of the sea coast, though they did not interfere with the inland parts of Jawh\u00e1r. By the middle of the sixteenth century Jawh\u00e1r limits were straitened by the advance of the Portuguese, who, besides their\n\n---\n\n1 Captain Macintosh in Bom, Geog. Soc. I. 239-240. The mention of Ankola, apparently Ankola in north K\u00e1\u00f1ara, was thought (see above p. 440 note 5) to show that Jayaba the ferryman, or Koli who defeated the nephew of the Gauri chief and founded a dynasty, belonged to central or south Konkan and not to Th\u00e1na. According to the story the Gauri R\u00e1ja is said to have ruled at N\u00e1sik and Trimbak and to have been the brother of R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja the chief of Daulatabad. His nephew is said to have governed the Konkan below the Sahy\u00e1dr\u00eds. Jayaba defeated him, became master of the Konkan, and attempted to spread his power in the Deccan but was checked by the Musalm\u00e1ns. The facts that R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja, the Y\u00e1dav chief of Devgiri or Daulatabad had a viceroy in Th\u00e1na about 1300 (1286-1292); that in the early part of the fourteenth century, the Musalm\u00e1n hold of the Konkan was very weak; and that Jayaba's son was acknowledged an independent chief in 1343, make it probable that the Jayaba, the ferryman, mentioned in the Mackenzie Manuscripts (Wilson's Edition, I. cvi.) is the founder of the Jawh\u00e1r family. The mention of Ankola on the extreme south of the Konkan is perhaps to be explained by the fact (Fleet's K\u00e1\u00f1arese Dynasties, 74) that R\u00e1m R\u00e1ja held the whole of the Konkan as far south as Mysor.\n\n2 Bom, Gov. Sel. XXVI, 14.\n\n3 Aitchison's Treaties, IV. (1876), 321.\ncoast possessions, held the strong hill of Asheri and had several stockaded forts in the inland parts of north Th\u00e1na. They had constant quarrels and made several treaties with the chief of the Kolis, whose followers they describe as causing much mischief, jumping like monkeys from tree to tree.\\(^1\\) About this time the Koli chiefs seem to have held the wild north-east apparently as far south as about Bhiwandi and the hill-fort of M\u00e1huli. Besides these the Kolis had three leading towns, Tavar to the north of Daman, Vazen perhaps V\u00e1sind, and Darila apparently Dheri near Umbargaon a large town of stone and tiled houses.\\(^2\\) In the decay of Portuguese power (1600-1650) the Kolis regained their importance. The Moghal generals, to whom mountain warfare was hateful, were glad to secure the alliance of the Jawh\u00e1r Kolis. At the close of the seventeenth century (1690), with the help of the Musalm\u00e1ns, the Jawh\u00e1r chief marched over the north Konkan with 4000 soldiers, plundering the Portuguese villages and churches. About the beginning of the eighteenth century, except the sea coast, the Jawh\u00e1r rulers held the whole of the north Konkan from Bassein to Daman, as well as some districts as far south as Bhiwandi.\\(^3\\) Their lands were strengthened by ten forts, and they enjoyed a yearly revenue of about \u00a335,000 (Rs. 3,50,000), chiefly from transit duties.\n\nLater on, in the eighteenth century, the Jawh\u00e1r chief had to meet a more formidable foe than the Portuguese. Their successes between 1739 and 1760 threw into the hands of the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s not only the Portuguese coast tracts, but great part of the southern districts of Jawh\u00e1r. The Jawh\u00e1r chief became dependent on the Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s. The Peshwa levied the b\u00e1bti and sardeshmukhi cesses, employed the chief and his troops, more than once attached the state to punish the chief for not putting down Koli raids, and levied a yearly tribute or nazar of \u00a3100 (Rs.1000).\\(^4\\) In 1742, on the death of Vikramsh\u00e1h, one of his widows, S\u00e1i Kuvarb\u00e1\u00ed, was allowed by the Peshwa to adopt a son. Shortly after, the other widow Mohan-kuvarb\u00e1\u00ed succeeded in effecting the death of the adopted son, and the Peshwa assumed the management of the state. The state was again attached in 1758, and a third time in 1761.\\(^5\\) In 1782 an arrangement was made with the Peshwa, under which the Jawh\u00e1r chief was allowed to keep territory yielding a yearly revenue of from \u00a31500 to \u00a32000 (Rs.15,000-Rs.20,000). In 1798, on the death of Patangsh\u00e1h II. the Peshwa allowed his son Vikramsh\u00e1h III. to succeed, but made him agree to manage his affairs in submission to the Peshwa's government, to pay a succession fee of \u00a3300 (Rs. 3000), and to be subject to the supervision of the m\u00e1mlatd\u00e1r of Trimbak.\\(^6\\) In 1805, in consequence of a Bhil outbreak near R\u00e1mnagar, the Peshwa sent a force and ordered the Jawh\u00e1r chief to place himself under the orders of his officers.\\(^7\\) Vikramsh\u00e1h III. died without heirs\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Da Cunha's Bassein, 257.  \n\\(^2\\) Nairne's Konkan, 45.  \n\\(^3\\) Bom.

The succession was disputed by the widows of two brothers of the late chief. To prevent disorder the Collector of the north Konkan went to Jawhar and installed the posthumous child as Patangshah III. During his minority the management of the state was entrusted to Patangshah's mother Sagunabai, and a joint yearly allowance of \u00a3200 (Rs. 2000) was fixed for the maintenance of the other two widows and their sons. The succession fee due to the British Government was, without affecting its future payment, remitted as a favour. In 1835 there were eighty-three villages and a yearly state revenue of \u00a31000 (Rs. 10,000) of which \u00a3600 (Rs. 6000) were from transit and excise duties and \u00a3400 (Rs. 4000) from land revenue. In succession to Patangshah III., who died without heirs at Bombay in 1865 (11th June), his widow adopted Narayanrao grandson of Madhavrao, Patangshah III.'s uncle. This Narayanrao called Vikramshah IV. died on the 23rd July 1865. It seems that before the disposal of Narayanrao's body his young widow Lakshmibai, at the advice of Gopikabai his mother and guardian, adopted as her son Malharrao the present Chief, who was then about ten years. As is shown in the accompanying family tree, he was the son of one Madhavrao, a descendant of Lavjirao, a brother of Krishnashah the ninth chief.\n\nAt the time of Malharrao's adoption the state was attached, and the maiatdari of Dahani was for a time placed in charge. When the adoption was sanctioned, the management of the state was entrusted to the Rani Gopikabai, on condition that a succession fee of \u00a32000 (Rs. 20,000) was paid and that the young Chief should be taught English and be sent to the Poona High School; that not more than half of the state income should be spent; that an officer should be chosen to manage the state, who could not be dismissed without the approval of the British Government; and that provision should be made for the administration of civil and criminal justice. On these terms the young Chief was invested at Poona on the 29th October 1866, and installed in Jawhar on the 28th March 1867. The average of six years' receipts between 1859-60 and 1864-65 showed a yearly revenue of \u00a310,125 (Rs. 1,01,250), and on the 29th April 1866 a credit balance of \u00a312,475 (Rs. 1,24,750). The expenses of the establishment were reduced, so that the expenditure was not more than one-half of the revenue. Schools were opened; important roads were made through the Kasatwadi and Dheng passes, at a cost of \u00a39500 (Rs. 95,000); and wells dug and the water-supply improved.\n\nIn 1869 an enquiry by the late Mr. Havelock, C.S., showed that the Jawhar accounts were carelessly kept, and confused, if not falsified. The manager Knvarji Shapurji was tried, and, though acquitted of criminal conduct, was found incompetent, and replaced in March 1870 by Mr. Jaisingrao Angria. Mr. Jaising was succeeded by Mr. Shivram Nilkant, who remained in charge till the young Chief came of age in 1877. The young Chief, with a suitable establishment, went to Poona and studied under a private tutor. In 1874 he was married to a daughter of Mahad Khan Patil of the village of Kalusta, near Igatpuri in Nasik. The marriage took place on 31st August 1874.\nplace at Jawh\u00e1r on the 20th April 1874, in the presence of the Political Agent Mr. J. W. Robertson. On the 28th March 1875 the R\u00e1ni regent Gopik\u00e1b\u00e1i died, and the direct management of the state was assumed by the Collector and Political Agent.\\(^1\\) In December 1875 the Chief was withdrawn from the Poona High School, and for a time attended the Poona Judge's Court that he might learn how the business of a British Court was carried on. At the end of May 1876 he was allowed to take a share in the management of the state, and on the 22nd January 1877 he assumed complete charge.\\(^2\\) The Chief, who is (1882) twenty-eight years old and has a son, enjoys second class jurisdiction, which, according to Government Resolution 670 of the 5th of February 1877, gives him power to carry out capital sentences in the case of his own subjects only. Otherwise he has full jurisdiction over native British subjects committing crimes in his territory, subject to the advice of the Political Agent, should there be ground for his intervention. Except the succession fee, the Chief pays no tribute to the British Government. He has no military force. Adoption is allowed only by the sanction of Government, and in matters of succession the family follows the rule of primogeniture.\n\nSixteen chiefs seem to have ruled over Jawh\u00e1r. The names of the first eight are (1) Paupera or Jayaba, (2) Nemsh\u00e1h I., or Dhulb\u00e1r\u00e1v, (3) Bhimsh\u00e1h, (4) Mahamadsh\u00e1h, (5) Krishnash\u00e1h I. adopted son of Mahamadsh\u00e1h, (6) Nemsh\u00e1h II., (7) Vikramsh\u00e1h I., and (8) Patangsh\u00e1h I. The names of the remaining eight rulers are shown in the following family tree:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n(8) & \\text{ Patangsh\u00e1h I.} \\\\\n& \\downarrow \\\\\n(9) & \\text{ Krishnash\u00e1h II.

Res. 2532, 13th April 1875.  \n\\(^2\\) Gov. Res. 7127, 8th December 1876.\nGanj\u00e1d, each in charge of an officer styled mah\u00e1lkari, whose monthly pay is \u00a32 10s. (Rs. 25). These officers perform civil criminal police registration and forest duties under the minister or k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri, whose monthly pay is \u00a310 (Rs.100). They supervise the collection of the land revenue made by the village accountants tal\u00e1tis, the village headmen p\u00e1tils, and the forest inspectors. They also examine their accounts and records, submit periodical reports and returns to the minister, and carry out his orders.\n\nThe land is held to belong to the state, but so long as the holder pays his rent he cannot be ousted. The holders of land are the actual husbandmen. There is no class of big landlords or middlemen. The land tenure varies in different parts of the state. In Kariyat-Haveli land is measured and assessed by the plough or n\u00e1ngar. Under this system a rough estimate of the tillage area is framed from the number of bullocks and he-buffaloes employed by each landholder, a pair being considered to represent a plough. The cattle are counted in July and August by village headmen and accountants, and the assessment is levied at rates varying from 10s. to 16s. (Rs.5-Rs. 8) a plough. In the Malv\u00e1da division the assessment is based on the supposed productiveness of the soil.\n\nCertain areas of land, locally known as mudka or muda and thoka, are measured and their outturn ascertained, and, with these as a standard, the assessment on other areas and classes of land is fixed. The assessment on each mudka varies from \u00a31 4s. to \u00a34 (Rs.12-Rs.40), and the assessment on each thoka from 2s. to \u00a31 (Re.1-Rs.10). A third system of defining the areas of land, similar to that adopted by the survey department, is in force in the Ganj\u00e1d division. Under this system, which is known as bigh\u00e1wni, the assessment rates vary from 4s. to 11s. 6d. (Rs.2-Rs.5\u00bd) a bigha or three-quarters of an acre. The upland or varkas area is measured every year and assessed at 3s. (Rs.1\u00bd) a bigha. In 1878 it was determined to introduce into the whole of Jawh\u00e1r the system of revenue survey in force in the neighbouring Th\u00e1na villages. The rates were not reduced, but the mode of assessment was improved and leases on favourable terms were granted. The work of measuring is now in progress.\n\nThirty years ago (1854) justice was very imperfectly administered. In civil cases, when the dispute was about a debt, the parties were brought into court, and, when the claim appeared just, the debtor was warned to pay. If he refused to pay, his property was sometimes attached or himself imprisoned, but, as a rule, nothing was done to enforce payment. When the debtor paid, the state took a share and handed over the rest to the creditor. In criminal matters light offences were punished with fines levied by subordinate officers, from whose decisions an appeal lay to the Chief, who investigated the matter, but kept no record of his proceedings. In cases of adultery a fine varying from \u00a33 10s. to \u00a310 (Rs.35-Rs.100) was imposed on the parties concerned. In default of payment the woman was kept by the Chief as a bondswoman. Persons convicted of witchcraft were fined, and, in default of payment, had their nose and tongue cut off. Only in\ncases of murder and gang-robbery were written depositions taken. Sentences of fine, imprisonment, whipping, or the stocks, were finally passed according to the Chief's discretion. During the Political Agent's management of the state (1865-1877) four civil courts were established. Of these the courts of the mah\u00e1lkaris of Kariyat-Haveli and Malv\u00e1da were authorised to dispose of suits of less than \u00a320 (Rs. 200). Claims over that amount and appeals from the mah\u00e1lkaris' decisions were heard in the minister's court. The fourth court, that of the Political Agent, exercised the powers of the High Court. In 1878 a new mah\u00e1lkari's court was established in the Ganj\u00e1d sub-division, with the same powers as the courts in other sub-divisions. In 1879 the court in each mah\u00e1l was abolished, and an itinerant judge was appointed. There are thus three courts, the itinerant judge's and k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri's courts for original, and the Chief's court for appellate suits. In judicial proceedings the Penal Code and Acts IX. of 1859 and X. of 1872, modified by certain local practices and usages, are generally followed. A fee of 12\u00bd per cent (2 as. in the rupee) is levied as a stamp duty on all plaints. In 1881, of 133 cases including arrears, two were disposed of by the k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri and ninety-four by the circuit judge. The average length of time taken to dispose of a case was both in the k\u00e1rbh\u00e1ri's court and in the circuit judge's court two months. Only one appeal was disposed of in the Chief's court. In 1881 there were 135 applications for the execution of decrees, of which 107 were disposed of. Civil prisoners are confined in a separate room attached to the criminal jail.\n\nIn 1872, registration was introduced based on the principles of the Indian Registration Act, the minister being appointed registrar and the mah\u00e1lkaris sub-registrars. In 1881, nineteen documents were registered, transferring property of the value of \u00a3405 (Rs. 4050). The registration fee is a half per cent; and the whole receipts amounted to \u00a33 16s. (Rs. 38). Under the management of the Political Agent five criminal courts were established. Three of these were the courts of mah\u00e1lkaris, invested with the powers of third class magistrates, the fourth was the minister's court with the powers of a second class magistrate and power to commit cases beyond his jurisdiction to the Political Agent, the fifth was the court of the Political Agent, who exercised the powers of a sessions judge and heard appeals from the decisions of subordinate magistrates. Since the Chief has assumed charge of the state, he decides first class magisterial and sessions cases, and hears appeals.\n\nIn 1881, 195 criminal cases of which 174 were original and twenty-one were appeal were disposed of. The people are orderly and free from crime. Robbery, insult, assault, house-trespass, theft, hurt, mischief, and misappropriation of property are the most usual forms of crime.\n\nUp to 1875-76 the state police force comprised only six constables and one head constable, who were posted in the town of Jawh\u00e1r, and occasionally told off on duty to other places. In that year the police force was increased by the addition of one chief constable and six constables. At present (1881) the state police is twenty-one strong,\nand is maintained at a monthly cost of \u00a317 (Rs. 170). In 1881, of 248, the total number of persons arrested, 158 were convicted; and of the property of \u00a321 14s. (Rs. 217), alleged to have been stolen, \u00a320 8s. (Rs. 204) or 94 per cent were recovered. There are no mounted police.\n\nThe jail is under the charge of an officer called th\u00e1ned\u00e1r. It is in a healthy position near the Chief's residence. It has room for about fifty prisoners, who are employed in keeping the town clean and in in-door work. The health of the convicts is attended to by a native medical practitioner belonging to the state. In 1881 there were ninety-two convicts on the jail roll and the jail charges amounted to \u00a353 (Rs. 530). There are no jail receipts.\n\nExcluding \u00a334,428 (Rs. 3,44,280) invested in Government securities, the state revenue amounted in 1880-81 to \u00a39010 (Rs. 90,100), of which \u00a32435 (Rs. 24,350) or 27 per cent of the whole were from land, \u00a32784 (Rs. 27,840) from forests, \u00a32191 (Rs. 21,910) from excise, \u00a3535 (Rs. 5350) from transit duties, and \u00a31065 (Rs. 10,650) from other sources. The total charges amounted to \u00a36520 (Rs. 65,200), of which \u00a31526 (Rs. 15,260) were spent on establishments, \u00a3762 (Rs. 7620) on public works, \u00a3304 (Rs. 3040) on medicine and education, and \u00a33928 (Rs. 39,280) on miscellaneous accounts. The excise revenue is under the exclusive management of the British Government, to whom, in 1880, the chief sold his revenue for five years at a yearly sum of \u00a33200 (Rs. 32,000).\n\nIn 1879 four primary schools were supported by the state. In 1881 the number of schools rose to six. Of these one at the town of Jawh\u00e1r, which teaches English up to the second standard, is held in a large school-house lately built by the Chief. In 1881 it was attended by 116 pupils Br\u00e1hmans, Prabhus, V\u00e1nis, Son\u00e1s, Shimpis, Parits, Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s, Kol\u00eds, and Musalm\u00e1ns, and had an average monthly attendance of seventy-nine pupils. The other five schools, at Malavda, Kurja, Deheri, Ny\u00e1h\u00e1le-Khurd, and Alavde, had 172 pupils and a monthly attendance of 105 pupils. According to the 1872 census the number of persons able to read and write was 208.\n\nUntil 1878 there was no dispensary. The Chief employed a native medical practitioner who occasionally dispensed European medicines. In 1878 a dispensary was opened in Jawh\u00e1r in a building made by the Chief. In 1881 it was attended by 1133 persons, of whom fifteen were in-door patients. The cases treated were malarial fever, bronchitis, dysentery, and diarrhoea. In 1879 the vaccinator, who is paid \u00a324 (Rs. 240) a year, with the help of a peon on \u00a37 4s. (Rs. 72) a year, performed 2050 operations, all of which were successful. The average number of births and deaths registered during the five years ending 1879 was 237 births and 219 deaths; the returns are very incomplete.\n\nJawh\u00e1r, the capital of the state, is a growing place of about two hundred houses. It is built on either side of a broad street, which runs north and south between two deep gorges, on a tableland about 1000 feet above the sea. The place is healthy and free from excessive heat. The water supply is at present scanty, but the\nChief is considering a plan for making a reservoir and bringing the water into the town by pipes. Within the last few years the Chief has done much for Jawh\u00e1r. He has built a large public office, school-house, and dispensary, and, by free grants of timber, has induced the townspeople to rebuild their houses in a much better style than formerly. The only remains are near the Chief's residence, the ruins of a large palace and music-room or nag\u00e1rh\u00e1na, which were built by Krishnash\u00e1h about 1750, and destroyed by fire in 1822. On the same tableland as the present town is old Jawh\u00e1r. There is now nothing to mark the site of the old town. In 1881 a stone step well was found completely hidden in the ground. The only place of interest in the state is said to be the ruined fort of Bhopatgad, about ten miles south-east of Jawh\u00e1r.\nTH\u00c1NA BOATS.\n\nAs it contains Sop\u00e1ra the great ancient centre and Bombay the great modern centre of the sea trade of Western India, the Th\u00e1na coast has a special interest in connection with the disputed question whether the Hindus were among the earliest sailors on the Indian Ocean.\n\nVincent was satisfied that the direct trade between Western India and Eastern Africa and Arabia dated from pre-historic times. He assumed\n\n1 These notes have had the advantage of additions and corrections by the following gentlemen: Mr. E. J. Ebden, C. S.; Mr. G. C. Whitworth, C. S.; Capt. J. S. King; Dr. G. Da Cunha; Mr. E. H. Aitken; Mr. J. Miller; Professor Mirza Hair\u00e1t; Munshi Lutfullah; and Munshi Ghul\u00e1m Muhammad.\n\n2 Commerce of the Ancients, II, 159. Vincent considered that the Hindus never were seamen (II, 404), and that the first sailors and the first carriers on the Indian Ocean were Arabs (II, 2 and 480). Again, he says, the Arabs were the only nation who could furnish mariners, carriers, or merchants in the Indian Ocean (II, 62). The ancient practice of applying the name India to the coasts of Persia, Arabia, and east Africa, as well as to Hindust\u00e1n, has been considered (Sir W. Jones in As. Res., III, 2, 4, 5, 7) to point to Hindu settlements on those coasts. Yule (Cathay, 182 note; Marco Polo, II, 359) seems to find in the Arab-Persian words Sind, Hind, and Zang, a sufficient explanation of the \"Three Indies,\" a phrase which, with variations in detail, he traces through the writings of geographers and travellers from the fourth to the fourteenth century, and which survives in the modern expression Indies or East Indies. Marco Polo, II, 335, 365. But the words Sind, Hind, and Zang do not explain how the word India came to be used of Abyssinia, nor do they account for the confusion between Ethiopians and Indians that runs through the whole of Greek and Roman literature. The Persian Zang or Ethiopian may by general writers have been used vaguely to include all eastern Africa. But the geographers, at least Masudi (915) Ibn Haukal (970) Al Biruni (1020) and Idrisi (1150), were careful to use the Arab Habash for Abyssinia and to confine Zang to the Zanzibar coast. [See Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, lxxxv, ccxcii, ccccv, ccccxi; Fragments, 125. Kosmas (530) also confines Zingian to the Zanzibar coast, J. R. A. S. XX, 292]. The words Sind, Hind, and Zang also fail to explain the Arab and Christian name of \"Land of India\" for the country near the head of the Persian Gulf, a use which, according to Rawlinson, still remains (J. R. G. S. XXVII, 186). Finally, they do not account for the Arab practice of including J\u00e1va and other Malay islands in India (Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, cccxxxii, cccxci).\n\nThe practice of applying the name India to the coasts of Persia, Arabia, and Africa may, as Rawlinson suggests (Herodotus, I, 650), date from the time when the whole coast was held by a single Cushite or Ethiopian race. But the peaceful or forceful settlement of large bodies of Hindus along the shore of the Indian Ocean is shown to be possible by the great Hindu invasions of the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea which took place during the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries (Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, cccxxxiv; Memoir Sur l'Inde, 200; Rawlinson Proc. R. G. S. I, 40). Marco Polo's (1290) description of the Hindu pirates or seafaring tribes who, with their wives and children on board, lived at sea during the whole fair season (Yule's Ed., II, 324-325), shows how easily, in times of political or religious distress, a large body of Hindu emigrants may have been provided with a passage across the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe following summary of existing Indian settlements in Africa is from Keith Johnston's Africa (London, 1878). The trade of Masuh on the Abyssinian coast is chiefly in the hands of resident Banians or Indian Muhammedans who act as go-betweens (p. 251). In Zanzibar the wholesale and retail trade is in the hand of East Indians, of whom in 1873 there were over 4000 of all castes and of every trade. They are generally termed Hindi or Banyans. The Hindi are more especially Muhammedans, Khojas, Bohoras and Memans, the Banyans, Bhatis and Lohan\u00e1s. There were\nthat the rule of Manu making sea-faring a crime and the modern Br\u00e1hman feeling against the sea applied to all Hindus at all times. He therefore also Laskars or Indian seamen (pp. 297, 299, 300, 301). There were Cutch men in Madagascar (p. 504), and at Lourenzo Marquez on the north of Delagoa Bay there was a large proportion of half-castes, Banyans, Musalm\u00e1ns, and Br\u00e1hmans (437). Finally, in central Africa at Tahorah to the south of Lake Nyans, Cameron in 1873 found a thousand Beluchis, an outpost of the Sultan of Zanzibar (p. 332).\n\nTo the special notices given in the text and in the History Chapter on Hindu settlements in Persia and on the African coast, the following general remarks may be added:\n\n**Persian Gulf.** Oderic (1320) speaks of the Lower Euphrates as 'India within land' (Yule's Cathay, I. cclxxiii.), and Marco Polo (1290) brings Greater India or Hindustan nearly as far west as Ormuz. (Yule's Marco Polo, II. 336). Under the Arabs (640-1000) the lands near the head of the Persian Gulf were colonised by Jats and Sangh\u00e1rs (?) (Jat\u00e1n and S\u00e1g\u00e1n) from the mouth of the Indus, and were termed Hind (Rawlinson in J. R. A. S., New Series, XII. 208 and Proc. R. G. S. I. 40; Yule's Cathay, I. 55 note 3), Masudi (Prairies d'Or, IV. 225) states that at the time of the Arab conquest (A.D. 640) the land near Basra was called India, and this practice seems to go back to the beginning of the Christian era. (Rawlinson in J. R. G. S. XXVII. 186). The formidable invasions of the Persian Gulf from India by sea during the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries (compare text and Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccclxxxii., and Rawlinson Proc. R. G. S. I. 40) are perhaps one reason why the country on the coast was called India. See invasions from India may also be the reason, why the early Persians (p.c. 330) built no cities near the coast (Elliot and Dowson, I. 513), and why they dammed the Tigris (Rooke's Arrian, II. 149; Elliot and Dowson, I. 513). It seems also possible that the Indian-named tribes who some time before the Christian era were deported to near the Caucasus may have been Indian pirates or invaders from the Persian Gulf (Elliot and Dowson, I. 512). As is noticed in the text (p. 404 note 3) one of the earliest fragments of history is the doubtful settlement in the Persian Gulf of the Indian Andub\u00e1r who taught the Babylonians religion and crafts. (Rawlinson in J. R. A. S. XII. (N. S.), 209).\n\n**Africa.** The references in the History Chapter show that from very early times the connection between Western India and Eastern Africa has centred in three places, in Socotra and in the Abyssinian and Zanzibar coasts. In addition to its Sanskrit name Masudi (915) notices (Prairies d'Or, III. 37) that, before the Greeks came, the island of Sokotra was colonised by Hindus, and passages in Masudi, Marco Polo, and Ibn Batuta (Prairies d'Or, III. 37; Yule's Marco Polo, II. 325, 344, 345) show that from the tenth to the fourteenth century the island was a centre of Hindu piracy. It has been recently argued (Philological Museum, II. 146 in Smith's Dict. of Greek and Roman Geography, I. 60) that the Memnones of Ethiopia came from Western India, and, in the early part of the century, Wilford's Essay on Egypt (As. Res. III. 295-402) satisfied Sir W. Jones (Ditte 467) that the early Hindus had a knowledge of Misr and the Nile. Jordanus (1320) calls Abyssinia India the Lesser (Yule's Marco Polo, II. 365), and Marco Polo (1290) and Benjamin of Tudela (1150) call Abyssinia or Abash Middle India (Ditte 360, 365). In the fifth and sixth centuries Abyssinia was in close connection with India (J. R. A. S. XX. 292); mention is made of Indian and Ethiopian elephants being used in the wars of the kings of Abyssinia (Marco Polo, II. 368). Apollonius (A.D. 100) a doubtful authority, mentions acolyry from India to Ethiopia (Priaulx in J. R. A. S. XVIII. 92). In Roman and Greek writers from Virgil to Homer India and Ethiopia are used as convertible terms (see Smith's Anc. Geog. II. 43), a confusion which, in Sir William Jones' opinion (As. Res. III. 4, 5), can be explained only by Indian settlements in Abyssinia. As regards Zanzibar settlements Jordanus (1320) calls the Zanzibar coast India Tertia (Yule's Cathay, 182), and Marco Polo (1290) calls Zanzibar an Indian island (Yule's Ed. II. 356). Ritter holds that the Hindu colonies in Zanzibar were not confined to the coast. He notices that in modern times banyan trees or Indian figs have been found planted near the falls of the Congo river on the west coast of Africa, in nearly the same latitude as Zanzibar (Erdkunde, Band IV. Abh. II. 661). The existence of a highway of trade across Africa from the Congo river was known to the Portuguese before they rounded the Cape of Good Hope. (Ditto and compare Stevenson's Sketch of Discovery, 336). When they reached Mozambique they found that the people of the coast easily understood a Kafir of Guinea who was in Paulo da Gama's boat (Three Voyages of Vasco da Gama, 79). Ptolemy (A.D. 150), who had a considerable knowledge of Central Africa, shows two inland trade routes from about Zanzibar, one west to the Atlantic, the other north to near Tripoli (see Africa Map V. in Bertius' Ed.). The traffic across Africa still remains. Cameron in 1874, who\nconcluded that the first seamen were Arabs, and that the Hindus, though they may have been merchants and shipowners, were never sailors. On the\n\ncrossed from near Zanzibar to the Congo river, found the traffic of the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic meet in the heart of Central Africa (Keith Johnston's Africa, 349). Al Biruni (1020) notices that the Comayris to the south of Zanzibar professed the Indian religion (Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccxviii.) and Smei (1811) detected an Indian element in the Sawahills of the Zanzibar coast. ('Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. VI. 93). The fact that the people of Madagascar are of the same stock as the Malays (Keith Johnston's Africa, 531), or perhaps rather of the pre-Malay Polynesians (Fornander's The Polynesian Race (1878), I. 140), shows across what wide stretches of sea early settlements were made.\n\nHindu settlements in Africa have the special interest that recent writers on the rude stone monuments of the east and the west are inclined to explain the sameness in character and in certain details to a movement of an eastern tribe through Africa into Western Europe. Col. Leslies (Early Tribes of Scotland, II. 478) holds that the remains of rude stone monuments furnish proof of a Celtic migration from the heart of Africa through Spain and France to the north of Scotland. This implies no more direct connection between West India and East Africa than the general accepted view of the spreading of races from Central Asia. But Dr. Fergusson goes further and holds that the apparent Indian element in the monuments in Algiers is due to some western movement of an Indian people, probably within historic times, or to the influence of Buddhist missionaries. (Rude Stone Monuments, 414, 426, 496, 498, 507).\n\nTwo somewhat doubtful instances of large Indian settlements in East Africa remain to be noticed. In the Central Soudan to the west of Abyssinia is a settlement of Kanuris whose name and certain peculiarities of language suggest a connection with the Indian Dravidians (Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 80; Keith Johnston's Africa, 176, 188).\n\nAnother section of the people of Africa whose language undoubtedly points to an Indian origin are the gypsy tribes of Egypt.* In 1799 (As. Res. III. 7) Sir W. Jones suggested that the famous pirates the Sanghars or Sanganians of Sindh, Cutch, and Kathiawar had settled on the shores of the Red Sea and passed through Egypt into south-east Europe as the Zingari or Zingari that is the gypsies. There are two difficulties in the way of this theory. The present gypsys of Egypt seem to have no trace (Newbold in J. R. A. S. XVI. 285-300) of the word Sanghar or Zingari, and, except the Helebi who may have come from Yemen, their language points to a passage from India through Persia, Turkey, and Arabia. The second difficulty is that though the earliest form of the name by which the gypsies were known in Europe At-sykanoi, or asakanoi seems connected with Sanghar, the form Tchinghani or Zingeneh is known in Turkey, Syria, and Persia and may have passed from Asia Minor into Greece.\u2020 In spite of these difficulties the following evidence may be offered in support of Sir William Jones' suggestion that part of the gypsies passed west by sea through Egypt to Europe.\n\nThe Sanghars are still widely spread in India. Besides in Cutch and Kathiawar under the names Sangar and Singhar they seem to occur to the south-east of Agra, in Umarkot, the Gangetic provinces, and eastern India. (Elliot's Races, North-West Provinces, I. 332; Elliot's Supplementary Glossary, 51; Bombay Gazetteer, V. 95-96 Cutch). Perhaps also they are the same as the Changars, a low-class Panjab tribe whose similarity in habits has already led to their proposed identification with the Zingari or Gypsies (Trumpp in Edin. Rev. CXLVIII. 142). So famous were the Sanghars or Sanganians in the seventeenth century that in Ogilby's Atlas (1670) Cutch is referred to (p. 293) as Sanga. Sanghars or Sengars appear in the list of Rajput tribes, but according to Tod (Rajasthan (Madras Edn.) I. 75-107) they\n\n*Among English Gypsys the words for water, fire, hair, and eye are pani, yog, bal, yak; among Norwegian Gypsys, j\u00f8nn, jog, hol, jak; among Persian Gypsys pdni, \u00e6t\u00e6, bdi, \u00e6ki, and among Egyptian Gypsys pani, \u00e3g, bal, ankh. The corresponding Gujarati words are g\u00e3ni, \u00e3g, vi, d\u00e3kh.\n\n\u2020The chief modern forms of the name are in Spain Zineali, in Italy Zingari, in Germany Zigeuner, in Russia Ziganich, in Turkey Tchighian, in Syria Jigani, and in India Zingari. In the fifteenth century the name appears as Sekane in Hungary and in the sixteenth and perhaps as early as the ninth century as Sakani in Spain and as Skedros or Skedroli or Sakandri or Al-Sikandal. Between the tenth and the seventh century they appear in Persia as Sag\u00e1n. Besides from the Sanganians or Sanghara these names have been derived from the Changars a Panjab tribe. Trumpp in Ed. Rev. CXLVIII. 142; from Sak\u00e1n that is Sak\u00e1n or Skythian by Rawlinson Proc. R. G. S. I. 40; from Zang (P) negro Burton in Academy 27th March 1875; from Zang (P) rust (or ruddy) Cape King; from Zingar a saddler Capl. Newbold J. R. A. S. XVI. 310; from the Kurd or the Zohranian; Thomson's Cyclopaedia II. 324; and from two gypsy words chen moon and kam sun by Leland. The Gypsies, 341.\nother hand, from the Sanskrit name Socotra, that is Sukhatara or the Fortunate, and from certain Hindu-like divisions and customs among\n\nwere never famous. Ibn Batuta (1340), Marco Polo (1290), and Masudi (920) mention Sokotra as a centre of Hindu piracy (Masudi's Prairies d'Or, III. 37; Yule's Marco Polo, II. 328,344, 345). That the Sokotra pirates were the Sangh\u00e1rs, J\u00e1ts or Jats, and Kerks who from Sindh, Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war ruled the Indian seas is made probable by Masudi's statement (III. 37) that Sokotra was a station for the Indian b\u00e1v\u00e1riy, a name which Al Biruni (1020) applies to the pirates of Cutch and Somn\u00e1th and which he derives from b\u00e1ira or b\u00e9ra the name of their boat. (Al Biruni in Elliot and Dowson, I. 65, 539). It curiously supports the connection between the Sangh\u00e1rs and the Zingari or Gypsies, that b\u00e9ra the name of the Cutch pirate craft is also the Romani or Gypsy word for boat (Encyclopaedia Britannica, Ninth Edition, X. 614; Borrow's Romani Word Book, 22). In the eighth century the Sangh\u00e1rs seem to appear as the Tang\u00e1meras or Sang\u00e1meras whom the Arab writers associate in piracy with the Meds Kerks and J\u00e1ts (Elliot and Dowson, I. 376, 508). According to Arab writers these tribes, taking their wives and children, went in mighty fleets moving long distances as far as Jidda on the Red Sea and occasionally settling in great strength. In the sixth century their piracies and raids are said to have made Naushirvan the Sassanian insist on the cession of the Beluchistan coast (Indian Antiquary, VIII. 335).\n\nIn much earlier times the Sangh\u00e1rs perhaps again appear in the Sangadas or Sang\u00e1ras whom Alexander's Greeks (a.c. 325) found to the west of the Indus and between its eastern and western mouths (McCrindle's Commerce and Navigation of the Erythrean Sea, 177; Vincent's Commerce of the Ancients, I. 198). Apart from this doubtful mention in Alexander's times the evidence seems sufficient to support Sir William Jones' suggestion that from early times the Sangh\u00e1rs or Sanganianos of Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1war were in a position to make settlements on the shores of the Red Sea. Sir William Jones' theory that the gypsies of Europe passed from India through Egypt seems to have been accepted for a time. A fuller knowledge of the Romani or European gypsy tongue proved the correctness of his main contention that the gypsies came from north-west India. At the same time the traces of Persian and Armenian in Romani and the absence of traces of Coptic or Arabic discredited the view that the gypsies entered Europe from Egypt.\n\nThat some perhaps most European Gypsies passed west through Persia and Asia Minor to eastern Europe seems beyond doubt. Besides the evidence of language, within the last two thousand years there are traces or records of at least six westerly movements among the frontier tribes of north-west India which may be included under the general term J\u00e1t.\u2020 The last movement seems to have been caused by Taimur's conquests (1398-1420) and the wanderers seem to have picked up and carried with them into Europe a number of the earlier Indian settlers in Persia and western Asia. At the same time it seems probable that under the name of At Sigkanoi or Asikani an earlier horde entered Europe from Egypt. The argument that because Romani has no Coptic or Arab words the gypsies never passed through Egypt loses its force when it is remembered that there is no trace of Arabic, Syrian, or Turkish in Romani, though some of the gypsies are known to have settled in Asia Minor on their way west. (Edin. Rev. CXLVIII. 144). Therefore, even though it left no trace in their language, the Asikani or Singani may have passed through Egypt on their way to Europe. But is it the case that there are no traces of Egypt in the Romani tongue? The earliest Greek form of their name At Sigkanoi, and a later form Asigani, suggest that the initial At or A is the Arabic Al the, and that the Al was changed into At because like\n\n---\n\n* Their settlements and raids on the Persian Gulf in the eighth and ninth centuries were on so great a scale that the whole strength of the Khalifa was brought against them and when defeated they were transported to Asia Minor (Ditte and Enc. Brit., I. 509-513); 2, the bringing of the Lurs or Indian musicians to Perse by Behram Gor about A.D. 450 and their subsequent dispersion (Hawlinson in Proc. R. G. S. I. 40); 3, the deporting of Kerks, Sang\u00e1ras, and J\u00e1ts in the eighth and ninth centuries from the Persian Gulf to Asia Minor. (Ditte and Enc. Brit. X. 617); 4, a doubtful migration of J\u00e1ts westward after their defeat in India by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1025; 5, a displacement of the Indian element in Persia and Asia Minor during the conquests of the Seljuki (12th century) and Osmanli Turks (14th century); 6, a final westward movement at the close of the fourteenth century the result of Taimur's ravages,\n\n\u2020 These six movements are: 1, a doubtful transplanting of Kerks, Sindis, Kolis, Mede, and other west Indian tribes into time before the Christian era. (Elliot and Dowson, I. 509-513); 2, the bringing of the Lurs or Indian musicians to Perse by Behram Gor about A.D. 450 and their subsequent dispersion (Hawlinson in Proc. R. G. S. I. 40); 3, the deporting of Kerks, Sang\u00e1ras, and J\u00e1ts in the eighth and ninth centuries from the Persian Gulf to Asia Minor. (Ditte and Enc. Brit. X. 617); 4, a doubtful migration of J\u00e1ts westward after their defeat in India by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1025; 5, a displacement of the Indian element in Persia and Asia Minor during the conquests of the Seljuki (12th century) and Osmanli Turks (14th century); 6, a final westward movement at the close of the fourteenth century the result of Taimur's ravages,\nthe people of east Arabia, Lassen came to the conclusion that the first sailors and colonizers on the Indian Ocean came from India.\\(^1\\) This view is adopted by Duncker, who agrees with Lassen that the mention by Agatharcides (B.C. 200) of leather boats on the Sabean or Yemen coast shows that the Arabs were not deep-sea sailors.\\(^2\\) It is also accepted by the recent African traveller Schweinfurth who holds that the shipping and the coast towns of the Red Sea are of Indian origin.\\(^3\\) Though this opinion is somewhat extreme, there is little doubt that from the earliest times the Hindus have been among the chief sailors and colonizers of the Indian Ocean.\\(^4\\) In timber, iron, sail-cloth, and cordage, India has always been rich, and the examples given in the History Chapter show that from the earliest historic times Hindus have been able and willing to make long voyages on the Indian Ocean and to settle on its most distant shores.\n\nAn examination of the names of the vessels which now ply on the Th\u00e1na coast, and of the words that denote their parts and their gear, shows that, of the names of vessels about two-thirds and of the names of the parts of vessels and of shipping gear about four-fifths are of Indian origin. At the same time it seems unlikely that sailing and boat-building did not spring up of themselves in the Red Sea. The high shores of the Red Sea\n\n---\n\n**Appendix A.**\n\n**Th\u00e1na Boats.**\n\n**Early Sailors.**\n\n---\n\nthe modern Turkish the old Arab form of the name was Tehingani. Next to Sangani or Zingari the best known name for the gypsies is Rom. Rom besides a gypsy means in their speech a man and a husband and Rom also means a man and a husband in modern Coptic (Ed. Rev. CL.XVIII. 140). Again the gypsies use guphtos (Ditto 142) apparently Egyptian or Copt, as a term of reproach. That they came from Egypt to Europe is supported by the fact that the At Sigkanoi are first noticed (14th century) in Crete, the part of Europe nearest Egypt, and that they are there described as of the race of Ham (Enc. Brit., Ninth Edition, X. 612). In the beginning of the fifteenth century (1417-1438), when they seem to have been joined by a second horde from Armenia and Asia Minor, the Secanae Zingari or Sangh\u00e1rs stated that they came from Egypt and their statement was accepted all over Europe. Besides the name of Egyptian, which has been shortened into Guphtos in Greece, Gitanu in Spain, and Gypsy in England, the Sekan\u00e6 or Zingari were in Cyprus, perhaps also in Austria, called Agariens or the children of Hagar, Nubians in some parts, Farawni in Turkey, and Pharaoh-nepek or children of Pharaoh in Magyar or Hungary. A curious trace of the belief in the Gypsy connection with Egypt remained till lately in the oath administered to Gypsies in Hungarian courts of justice, 'As king Pharaoh was engulfed in the Red Sea may I be if I speak not the truth' (Ed. Rev. CXLVIII. 120, 121, 122; Enc. Brit., Ninth Edition, X. 612). Again their leaders' titles mark the first gypsies as belonging to south-east Europe and Egypt. In 1417 the first band of Secan\u00e6 who appeared in Germany was led by the duke of Little Egypt, and in Scotland in 1500 the 'Egyptians' were led by the earls of Cyprus and Greece, and by the count of Little Egypt. (Enc. Brit., Ninth Edition, X. 612; Ed. Rev. CXLVIII. 117). Some of the earliest bands (1420) knew that they originally came from India. (Enc. Brit., Ninth Edition, X. 613), and others of the same horde seem (the passage is doubtful) to have said that they came from India through Ethiopia (Ed. Rev. CXLVIII. 121). Their knowledge of their Indian origin seems a reason for holding that the Sicanae or Sangh\u00e1rs were correct in stating that they were settled in Egypt before they came to Europe.\n\nWhether any of the Sangh\u00e1rs or Zingari passed along north Africa to Spain is doubtful. Gypsies were very early in Spain (1447) but the presence of Greek in the Spanish Romani seems to show that they came overland from eastern Europe. (Enc. Brit. X. 613-615). Of the gypsies of north Africa some were deported from the south of France in 1802 (Ditto 613), others have apparently come from Spain, and a third doubtful element seems to be passing west across Africa.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Ind.

The early history of the Phoenicians seems to point to the islands and narrows of the Persian Gulf as a third very early centre of seamanship and ship-building,\\(^4\\) and there is also a strong Persian element in modern Hindu seafaring terms.\n\nOf the words in use for the different grades of seamen only a small number are Hindu. Of the terms for the higher grades nakhoda or chief captain is the Persian nakhuda,\\(^5\\) sarang, properly sarhang, is a word meaning commander or boatswain from sar head and hang the Persian army or soldier; and malim or navigator is the Arab muallim teacher or master. Tanda, or captain of a small boat, alone seems to be Hindu from tanda a band or crew. Hindus generally call Hindu seamen or boatmen by their caste name, kharev in Gujar\u00e1t, koli on the Mar\u00e1tha coast, and ambi on the Karn\u00e1tak rivers. The only general terms in use for sailor are the Arabic khalasi from khal\u00e1s freedom or discharge, and lashkar from the Persian lashkar an army. The use of these Persian and Arab terms does not arise from the want of Hindu words. Captain in Sanskrit is nauik\u00e1dhyaksh and nauk\u00e1dh\u00edpati, and sailor is samudraya and ndvik. But none of these words are in common use. The fondness for foreign terms for seamen is shown by the general adoption, at least in Bombay harbour, of the English or part-English kapta and botv\u00e1la.\n\nAmong the present Hindu sailors and boatmen of Western India the chief deep-sea sailors who make voyages across the Indian Ocean are the Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s of Gujar\u00e1t and Cutch. These men are of Rajput or part-Rajput descent, and perhaps represent the fresh seafaring element that was introduced into the Hindus of Western India between the first and the sixth century after Christ. The only Hindu sailors of the North Konkan coast who now make voyages across the Indian Ocean are the Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1s of Daman. They sail Portuguese brigs of about a hundred tons in all weathers, steering by the compass and by charts, and voyaging as far as Mozambique, journeys which sometimes take as long as eight months.\\(^6\\) During 1881, exclusive of Daman and Bombay traders, the chief long voyages made by native craft were two dhingis, probably Kar\u00e1chi boats, which went from Jait\u00e1pur in Ratn\u00e1giri to Urmada in Makran; one ganja of Kar\u00e1chi which went from Bals\u00e1r to Madagascar; a Cutch ganja which went from Broach to Arabia; and a Bombay b\u00e1rcas of 35\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) tons which went from Broach to Arabia. Two of the captains were Musalm\u00e1ns, the rest were Cutch Hindus of the Kh\u00e1rv\u00e1 caste.\\(^7\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Laborde's Arabia Petraea, 300, 301.\n\\(^2\\) Chapter IX. 26.\n\\(^3\\) Laborde's Arabia Petraea, 301; Mr. James Douglas, Book of Bombay, \u00c1ngria's Kolaba.\n\\(^4\\) Lassen Ind.

Aitken.\nFor purposes of comparison the present names of the different craft that belong to or visit the Th\u00e1na coast may be arranged under three heads: General terms meaning ship, vessel, or craft; names of trading and fishing vessels; and names of small craft or canoes.\n\nThere are seven general terms meaning vessel or craft, \u00e1rm\u00e1r, b\u00e1rkas, galbat, ghur\u00e1b, jah\u00e1z, n\u00e1v, and tirkati.\n\nB\u00e1rkas is in general use in Th\u00e1na in the sense of coasting craft. It includes such small vessels as the mashva to which the term galbat is not applied. On the other hand it does not include canoes; a hodi is not a b\u00e1rkas. According to the W\u00e1gh or Head P\u00e1t\u00edl of the Alib\u00e1g Kolis a canoe or hodi is called a barakin. The origin of the words b\u00e1rkas and barakin is doubtful. The early Portuguese (1500-1510) in the Straits of Babelmandeb found b\u00e1rkas applied to small boats attached to ships. In Europe also the bark was originally a small boat. As barca in Portuguese means a great boat and barquinha a little boat, the use of barakin near Chaul favours the view that the word came to India from the Portuguese. But, as is noticed later, bark seems to be one of the boat names which the east and the west have in common. Barca is used in the Latin writers of the fifth century, and two or three hundred years later barge and barka are the names of the Danish and Norman pirate boats.\n\nGalbat is generally used of large foreign vessels such as English ships and steamers. The word seems to be the Amharic or Abyssinian jaiba a boat, the Arabic jum being pronounced hard in Yemen and final h being interchangeable with t. The early Portuguese (1510) found geluas or jeluas small boats in the Straits of Babelmandeb. The word is interesting as it seems to be the origin of the English jolly-boat. Jolly-boat is generally derived from yawl, but as the yawl was itself a small boat, it is difficult to explain the addition of the word boat. The word jolly-boat appears as gelly watte in several of the seventeenth century voyages. Kerr (Voyages, VIII, 169) suggests that the original form is galivat, and Dr. Da Cunha notices that galeota is a Portuguese word for a vessel. In the last century the galivat was a war boat, a large row boat of about seventy tons with one main and one small mast. It carried six or eight three or four pounder guns and was generally used to tow the ghur\u00e1b. The word galba seems also to be the origin of galley, galleon, and galleass, names said to have been brought into the Mediterranean by the Venetians from the Saracens about the fifteenth century. The same word seems to appear in gauloi, which, according to Stevenson, was the Phoenician word for a merchantman.\n\nGhur\u00e1b, according to Candy's Mar\u00e1thi Dictionary, means Arab. But, as the word is used by the Arabs, this seems unlikely. A more likely derivation seems to be the Arabic ghurr\u00e1b crow. As is shown in the\n\n---\n\n1 Commentaries of Albuquerque, II, 230 and III, 98. In the seventeenth century the words bark and frigate were applied to small vessels, grabs, and pinnaces. Kerr's Voyages, VIII, 130, 265, 351.\n2 Skeat (Etymological Dictionary, S. V.) makes bark and barge the same, and traces both to the Egyptian hari a row-boat. Captain King and Munshi Lutfullah suggest that the Red Sea b\u00e1rkas may be a distinct word and be derived from the Persian b\u00e1r-kash or weight dragger. See below under Barge.\n3 Captain J. S. King; compare Rigby in Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. VI, 93.\n4 Commentaries of Albuquerque, II, 230 and III, 20.

The word is now used of large deep-sea Arab and Indian vessels, especially of the Konkan p\u00e1tim\u00e1r.\n\nJah\u00e1z is a general term for a large vessel. The word in Arabic means vessel in the general sense of utensil; in Persian it means a ship. It is used by Friar Oderic in 1320, and is the ordinary Musalm\u00e1n word for a vessel.\n\nN\u00e1v.\n\nN\u00e1v is used chiefly of creek ferry-boats about the size of a machva (3-20 tons). The word is of Sanskrit origin, and is one of the few sea terms which the \u00c1ryan languages have in common.\n\nT\u00edrkat\u00ed.\n\nT\u00edrkat\u00ed in Mar\u00e1thi and tarkat\u00ed in Gujar\u00e1ti, perhaps tink\u00e1thi or three-masted, is the common Hindu word for an European sailing ship. It corresponds to the Arabic safari or voyager. Steamers are known as \u00e1gbots.\n\nForeign Vessels.\n\nOf the twenty-four vessels that are found on the Th\u00e1na coast, five are foreign and nineteen are local. The five foreign vessels are the baghla, the dha\u00fa, the botel, the dhangi, and the kothia.\n\nBaghla.\n\nBaghla is a large deep-sea vessel of Arab or Red Sea origin. The name is generally derived from the Arabic baghla, a mule, because of its carrying power. A better derivation seems to be from baghghal slow, the trading vessel, opposed to sambuk the passenger-boat apparently from sabk fast or outstripping. The shape of the baghla is said to have remained unchanged since early Egyptian times. Ganja the name for a large baghla with a figure-head is of doubtful origin.\n\nDha\u00fa.\n\nDha\u00fa is a large vessel which is falling into disuse. They never visit the Th\u00e1na coast. Their origin is in the Red Sea. The word is used vaguely and is applied to baghl\u00e1s. It seems to appear in Nikitin's (1470) travels as the tavas in which people sailed from Persia to India.\n\nBotel.\n\nBotel is a large vessel found both on the Arab coast and in the Persian Gulf. According to Dr. G. DaCunha, the word, like the Gujar\u00e1t batila, and the Suaheli or Zanzib\u00e1r coast batilla comes from the Portuguese batel a boat. This derivation is confirmed by Captain Low, who, without noticing the similarity of name, says, 'The batil has more of the European form than any other Indian vessel. The after-part shows the origin to have been Portuguese; they are said to be of the same shape as the vessel in which Vasco da Gama came to India.' The Portuguese batel is the same as the French bateau and the Celtic bat. The word seems to belong to the east as well as to the west, as it appears in the bahita of J\u00e1va. It seems also to be used both in the east and in the west in the double sense which the word vessel bears, that is both a sailing and a drinking vessel, boat and bottle in the west corresponding curiously to batel and battlu the K\u00e1narese for a cup or small vessel.\n\n---\n\n1 Pictet's Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes, II. 179-180.\n2 Capt.

The word is said to mean a log in Beluchi. It seems also to be Dravidian and is said to be in use on the God\u00e1vari. In Gujar\u00e1t the larger vessel seems to be called *danga*, and, besides it, there is a smaller *dhangi* like a canoe, except that it is always built never dug out. In this sense the word *dhingy* has been adopted into English.\n\n*Kothia* is a large ship belonging to Cutch and K\u00e1thi\u00e1w\u00e1r. The origin of the word is doubtful. It perhaps means means hollowed, akin to *koth\u00e1r* a granary. It appears in the Periplus (A.D. 250) under the form *kotimba*, as one of the local vessels that piloted Greek ships to the Narmada.\n\nThe nineteen local vessels are the *arm\u00e1r*, *baly\u00e1v*, *bat\u00edla*, *chhab\u00edna*, *ghur\u00e1b*, *hod\u00e1ga*, *machva*, *mah\u00e1ngiri*, *manja*, *mum*, *mumbda*, *pad\u00edo*, *palav*, *p\u00e1n-w\u00e1la*, *p\u00e1t\u00edm\u00e1r*, *phani*, *shyb\u00e1r*, *suval*, and *tarappa*.\n\n*Arm\u00e1r* is said to be used in Kol\u00e1ba like *ghur\u00e1b* as a big vessel, originally a vessel of war. The word is doubtful. *Arm\u00e1r* by itself is never used as a kind of ship in Portuguese. The nearest word to it is *armada* a navy.\n\n*Bal\u00e1v* or *Baly\u00e1v* is the Konkan fishing or racing boat. The word is apparently Indian, the same as the *bal\u00fam* a canoe. *Dob\u00e1sh*, literally two-tongued or interpreters, the ship-chandlers' boats in Bombay harbour are *bal\u00e1vs*. These are the 'balloons' of the early English writers. Most of the present Bombay yachts are balloons.\n\n*Batila* is a Gujar\u00e1t boat. Like the Arab *botel* the word seems to be of Portuguese origin.\n\n*Chhab\u00edna* is a passenger boat with a covered cabin. It is apparently a Persian word meaning a guard-boat.\n\n*Ghur\u00e1b* is said to be a Konkan trader of about 200 *khandis*. This is the old war vessel or grab of which an account is given in the Trade Chapter. The probable origin of the name is given above.\n\n*Hod\u00e1ga* is an Alib\u00e1g name for the *p\u00e1t\u00edm\u00e1r*. The word is K\u00e1narese.\n\n*Machva* is of Sanskrit origin, as if *matsyav\u00e1ha* or fish carrier. Except in Uran the Konkan *machva* is used not for fishing but in the coasting trade. The Gujar\u00e1t *machva*, a differently built boat from the Konkan *machva*, is used for fishing. *Machva* is also a general term in Gujar\u00e1t for small craft of one and a half to ten tons (5-30 *khandis*).\n\n*Mah\u00e1ngiri* is a greater or longer *machva*. The origin is doubtful. According to Molesworth (Mar\u00e1thi Dictionary), it is the Sanskrit *mah\u00e1giri* that is great hill, so called because of its bulk. This seems unlikely. Perhaps the word may be the Persian *mahi* fish and *giri* catch. The same word seems to appear in the class of M\u00e1ngela fishermen who are found in D\u00e1h\u00e1nu and in S\u00e1lsette. Like the *machva*, the Th\u00e1na *mah\u00e1ngiri* is a coasting trader not a fishing boat.\n\n*Manja* is said to be the same as *machva*. The word is doubtful, but apparently Indian. Mr. Whitworth states that the Gujar\u00e1t *manja* is an undocked craft of the same shape bow and stern, and from thirty to seventy\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. J.

The word is perhaps connected with manji a hod in the sense of a load carrier.\n\nMum also is doubtful; it is apparently un-Sanskrit Hindu. Mum is used of a water vessel as well as of a sailing vessel. The word suggests a connection with mumbe or Bombay, Mumbe and Trumbe, Bombay and Trombay, forming one of the popular jingling name couplets. Molesworth notices a mumba or greater mum.\n\nPad\u00e1o is a small trading vessel. It is apparently of Dravidian origin, as the word seems to mean undecked from pad open, opposed to the kapal or decked boat.1 Parao is one of the Malay words for a boat.2 The word may be compared with the Greek prora a boat and with the English prow or forepart of a boat.\n\nPalav seems not to be in use. The word is Sanskrit. Palva is the name of one of the J\u00e1va boats, and it is one of the few boat names which the Aryan tribes have in common.3 It has been thought to give its name to the P\u00e1lva or Apollo Bandar in Bombay, but it is doubtful whether the Hindu P\u00e1lva is not a corruption of the English Apollo.\n\nP\u00e1nwala is used of small fast-sailing p\u00e1tim\u00e1rs from Chaul which bring fruit and vegetables to Bombay. The name probably comes from p\u00e1n or betel-leaf.4\n\nP\u00e1tim\u00e1r is a fast sailer and coaster south of Bombay, apparently the Hindi p\u00e1th-m\u00edr courier or messenger.5 The Musalm\u00e1ns have twisted the word into phatem\u00e1ri to make it the Arabic snake (m\u00edr) of victory (phateh). The Portuguese (1510, Commentaries of Albuquerque, II. 78) found it on the Malab\u00e1r coast. The name was used by the people of the Malab\u00e1r Coast, who perhaps adopted it from the p\u00e1th-m\u00edrs or Br\u00e1hman couriers from the north who were high in favour with the Nair women. These Br\u00e1hmans are said to have come from Gujar\u00e1t. They seem to have played the same part as the Chitp\u00e1vans played, who, before the Peshwa rose to power, were chiefly known as harkar\u00e1rs or spies. Dr. Da Cunha states that patamar has been adopted by the Portuguese as a vessel carrying advices, and in Admiral Smyth's Sailor's Word Book Patamar appears as an excellent old class of advice boat. Mr. Whitworth finds it known in Gujar\u00e1t as a Malab\u00e1r boat, too sharp and deep for the Gujar\u00e1t rivers.\n\nPhani is a small coasting trader, apparently of Indian origin. Its odd wedge-shaped prow suggests that the word is phani a wedge.6\n\nShyb\u00e1r, apparently the Persian royal carrier, shahi-b\u00e1r, is a great p\u00e1thim\u00e1r. The Gujar\u00e1t form is chib\u00e1r. Hamilton (1700, New Account, I. 134) calls the shyb\u00e1r a half galley. The word is now used for very large vessels employed in the Malab\u00e1r timber-trade.\n\nSw\u00e1l is said to be a South-Konkan name for the machva. The word is apparently Indian.\n\nTarappa is a ferry-boat, the use being now confined to the double raft-like ferry-boats used for horses and carts. The word is of Sanskrit origin, one of several words tar\u00e1l\u00fa, tarandhu, tarani, and tarti, all from tar across. It appears in the Periplus (A.D. 250) as trappaga, one of the local boats.\n\n---\n\n1 Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, 2nd Ed., 501.\n2 Crawfurd's Dictionary of the Archipelago, II. 167.\n3 Crawfurd's Dictionary of the Archipelago, II. 167; Pictet's Origines Indo-Europ\u00e9ennes, II. 181.\n4 Mr. Miller.\n5 Captain J.

The word seems connected with the Arab and Persian trunki, a vessel not now in use. Hamilton (1700, New Account, I. 56) described the trunki as an undecked bark, and Grose (1750, Voyage, I. 18) speaks of it as an uncouth vessel of from 70 to 100 tons. Valentia (1800, Travels, II. 379) describes it as a big dhow used in India and Yemen.\n\nThere are eight words in use for jolly-boats and canoes, b\u00e1mbot, barakin, dhangi, hodi, pagar, shipil, sambuk, and toni.\n\nB\u00e1mbot is now in common use for a canoe or small ferry-boat not only in Bombay harbour but in the Ratn\u00e1giri creeks. In spite of its general use it seems to be derived from the English bumboat, the boats that convey provisions and vegetables to ships. The Ratn\u00e1giri Musalm\u00e1ns, who are employed in large numbers as watermen in the Bombay harbour, probably took the word home with them.\n\nBarakin and Dhangi have been mentioned above.\n\nHodi seems to be an un-Sanskrit Hindu word.\n\nShipil, said to mean a small hodi, is of doubtful origin; it is apparently Indian. The Sanskrit sip is a sacrificial vessel shaped like a boat, and shipil is a shell. The word seems connected with the English ship which also meant a drinking vessel.\n\nSambuk is used in Kol\u00e1ba as the small boat of a p\u00e1tim\u00e1r. The word is also applied to low-lying baghl\u00e1s from Yemen. It is the Arab sanbuk or sanabik, perhaps, as opposed to the slow baghla, from the Arab sabk fast or outstripping. In Barbosa (1500, Stanley's Edition 5, 64-68, 171) sanbucs and sambucos are generally small vessels of the Malab\u00e1r country. It occurs frequently in Vasco da Gama's Three Voyages (79, 80, 109, 246, 333). Early in the sixteenth century Varthema (Badger's Ed., 154) described the sambuchi of Kalikat as a flat-bottomed boat, and Albuquerque (1510, Com. I. 18) described it as a Moorish boat. In the seventh century this word was introduced by the Arabs into Spain, and has been adopted as xabeque into several European languages (Taylor's Words and Places, 443). Almadia a small canoe, though apparently not known on the Th\u00e1na coast, has a history closely like the history of the sambuk. The word which is the Arabic el-madiya or ferry was brought by the Arabs into Spain, where it still means a raft (Taylor's Words and Places, 443). The same word almaidia is noticed among the Kalikat shipping (Badger's Varthema, 154) as a small bark of one piece, and is mentioned by Albuquerque (Com. I. 26) and by Barbosa (9) on the African coast as hollowed out of a single trunk. It is still used in Portuguese as a small canoe.\n\nToni is a dug-out canoe. It is used in Bombay harbour instead of hodi, but it is generally believed to have been introduced by the Europeans. Doni is a K\u00e1narese word for a canoe. Smyth gives tonee a canoe of some burden in use on the Malab\u00e1r coast. Doni or dohma is the Somali for a boat. Rigby in Trans. Bom. Geog. Soc. VI. 92; IX. 168.\n\n---\n\n1 McCrindle's Periplus, 118.\n2 Commentaries of Albuquerque, I. 18.\n3 Low's Indian Navy, I. 169.\n4 The origin of the English bumboat is doubtful. Webster gives the improbable bum for buttock from its broad shape; Skeat gives the Dutch bin, the bin being originally a well to keep fish alive; Smyth gives bumbard or bombard the name of a barrel, because these boats used to bring beer to soldiers on duty; Captain King suggests bum to dun, as in bum-bailiff, because the women used to advance on credit and dun the seamen on pay day.\nAppendix A.\n\nTh\u00e1na Boats.\n\nParts of a Vessel.\n\nOf eight names of parts of a vessel, three are Sanskrit-Hindu, three of which one is doubtful un-Sanskrit Hindu, and two of which one is doubtful European. The keel is sometimes called ade an un-Sanskrit Hindu word, and sometimes path\u00e1n a Sanskrit word. The bow is n\u00e1l a Sanskrit word, and a piece of wood at the bow is called bhuvra, perhaps the English board as the word is used in the Bombay harbour in the phrase bord-par on board.\u00b9 The stern is vore also var\u00fam, perhaps un-Sanskrit Hindu from var meaning the high part. The cross beams or thwarts are v\u00e1k, the ordinary Sanskrit-Mar\u00e1thi across or athwart. The long beams are durmedh an un-Sanskrit Hindu word for shaft or post. The side timbers are perchi, perhaps from the Sanskrit per a joint or a space between joints.\n\nFittings.\n\nOf fourteen words for the fittings of a vessel seven are un-Sanskrit Hindu, three Sanskrit, two European, two Arab, and one Hindust\u00e1ni. The rudder or suk\u00e1n is the Arabic suk\u00e1\u00e1n. The mast is dolk\u00e1thi, the moving or swaying post, apparently Hindu, the dol being un-Sanskrit and the kith\u00edr or post Sanskrit. The yard, parm\u00e1n or parb\u00e1n, is said to be Hindust\u00e1ni. For sails there are four words. The main sail is shid, a Hindu word apparently un-Sanskrit. The stern sail is kahabi of unknown origin. The bow-sail is bom, apparently from the European boom and that from the German baum or tree, that is pole, because it is fastened to a boom or loose bow-sprit. Mr. Whitworth notices that the Gujar\u00e1t sailors use the words bom and jib more correctly than the Konkan sailors, using bom for the loose bow-sprit and jib for the jib-sail.\u00b2 The storm-sail is burkas, apparently the Arabic burka a veil. The sheet is n\u00e1de, apparently un-Sanskrit Hindu. The pulley is kappi and the pulley-rope id\u00e1li, both apparently Hindu words. The thole pin is dole apparently Hindu. The oar is either valhe, apparently un-Sanskrit Hindu, halisa among the Musalm\u00e1ns, or phalati properly the steering paddle perhaps the European float. The anchor is n\u00e1ngar, commonly called langar, apparently the Sanskrit l\u00e1nagal meaning plough.\n\nThe two sea terms in commonest use, ghos and d\u00e1m\u00e1n, are Persian. Ghos from goshah, apparently in the sense of corner or point, means the lower end of the sail-yard, the tack. As, in going in a wind, the tack is always fastened on the windward or weather side, the order to the helmsman, ghos or ghos kar, means luff or go into the wind. D\u00e1m\u00e1n, from the Persian and Sanskrit d\u00e1m\u00e1n in the sense of row or fringe, means the sheet of the sail, and, as in sailing into a wind, the sheet is always made fast on the lee side, d\u00e1m\u00e1n means leeward, and the order to the helmsman, d\u00e1m\u00e1n or d\u00e1m\u00e1n kar, means ease off the wind.\n\nWord Adoptions.\n\nThese details show four cases in which the east seems to have taken names of vessels from the west; the adoption of the Portuguese batel in the Arab botil and the Gujar\u00e1t batela; the adoption of the Portuguese bar\u00e7a in the Th\u00e1na b\u00e1rkas or small craft and the Kol\u00e1ba b\u00e1r\u00e1kin or small boat; the adoption from the Portuguese of \u00e1rm\u00e1r by the Kol\u00e1ba Kolis to mean a war-ship, and the adoption of the English bumboat. In seven cases Europe has taken names of boats from Asia, four of them before and three of them since the Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India. Of the four cases before Portuguese times, two belong to the Arab rule in Spain in the eighth\n\n\u00b9 Mr. E. H. Aitken.\n\u00b2 Jib seems an English word, the sail that is easily turned, jib meaning turn as in the phrase a jibbing horse. Like the Gujar\u00e1t sailors some of the Bombay boatmen use jib for the sail and bom for the loose bow-sprit.\ncentury, xabeque from the Arab sonbuk and almaid from the Arab el m'adiya, and two are a trace of the Venetian relations with the Saracens or Egyptians in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, galley, galleon, and galleass apparently from the Red Sea jelua or gelua, and carvel or caravel perhaps from ghurab. Four adoptions have taken place since Portuguese times, patomar a news-boat adopted into Portuguese from the Konkan patim\u00e1r; jolly-boat from gallivat adopted by both the Portuguese and the English; and dinghy adopted by the English from dhangi. In some of these cases it is doubtful whether the word was adopted or whether the word was not common to the east and to the west. Thus the gal of the Indian galbat, of the Red Sea jelua or gelua, and of the Mediterranean galley seems to appear again in the Danish jolle or yawl. So also b\u00e1rkas is found on the Th\u00e1na coast, in the Red Sea, and in most of the languages of western Europe. The Th\u00e1na word shipil for a canoe, as has been noticed, is apparently not derived from the English ship though from their both meaning a drinking and a sailing vessel the words seem to have a common though unconnected origin.\n\nThe names of some Indian vessels, which do not appear in the Th\u00e1na boat-list, offer further examples of a real or of a seeming connection between the shipping of the east and the shipping of the west.\n\nThe late Professor Dowson held that the English word barge came from the Arab b\u00e1raij a large vessel of war. He shows that, unlike its modern representative, the old English barge was a vessel of trade and of war. As barg is the form of barca which appears in several West European languages, the proof of borrowing by the west from the east is perhaps doubtful. But the fact of common possession remains. Under the name k\u00e1tur, the special craft of the pirates of Porka on the Malab\u00e1r coast was famous during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Judging from the descriptions, there seem to have been more than one k\u00e1tur. Varthema (1503; Badger's Edition, 154) makes the chatur a narrow sharp canoe; Barbosa (1510; Stanley's Edition, 157) makes it a small vessel like a brigantine; in the chronicles of Albuquerque (1510; II. 236) it appears as a small man-of-war; and in 1536 (Kerr's Voyages, VI. 238) the barge of King Bah\u00e1dur of Gujar\u00e1t is called a kat\u00fcr. As the word kat\u00fcr has been adopted into Portuguese as a small war vessel, it seems probable that the broad and short English man-of-war's cutter is called after the Indian kat\u00fcr. The quick-sailing sloops with running bow-sprits, known as cutters, are more likely to get their name from their speed. But they may possibly be named after the other or Malay variety of kat\u00fcr.\n\nCaravel or carvel, though now unknown, was a favourite craft with the Portuguese in the sixteenth and with the English in the seventeenth century. It was known in Europe before the Portuguese rounded the Cape of Good Hope. Vasco da Gama had a caravel of fifty tons in his first fleet (1498). The caravel is described in Albuquerque's Commentaries (1510) as a round boat of about 200 tons with lateen sails. At the end of the sixteenth century it appears in Davis' Voyages as a light vessel with high square poop from 100 to 200 tons, invariably lateen-rigged though some carried square sails on the fore-mast. Smith describes it as\n\n---\n\n1 Da Gama's Three Voyages, 26. Da Gama took five lateen-rigged caravels in his second voyage (1502; ditto 281), and brought out some more in 1524 which were fitted with lateen sails in D\u00e1bhol. Ditto 308; Kerr, II. 302.\n2 I. 4.\n3 Note, p. 156. The editor derives it from the Italian caravella. Lindsay (Merchant Shipping, I. 569) notices that the caravel was not always small.\nAppendix A.\n\nTh\u00e1na Boats.\n\nWord Adoptions.\n\nCarack.\n\nDISTRICTS.\n\na light lateen-rigged vessel of small burden formerly used by the Spaniards and Portuguese. The word seems to come through the Italian diminutive caravella and the Latin carabus and Greek karabos from the Arab ghir\u00e1b or khur\u00e1b. Carac, carrac, carack, like carv\u00e9l is no longer in use. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries it was a favourite word for a ship of great burden. Taylor makes it one of the shipping terms which came to Europe from Arabia. But, as far as is known, no word like karak occurs either in Persian or in Arabic. Other accounts state that it was introduced by Hippus the Tyrian, and the early Phoenician connection with the Persian Gulf suggests that the original form may have been kellet, a word still (1810, Rich's Kurdistan, II. 120) in use on the Euphrates. The word seems to appear in the British karak or coracle, the Welsh kyryg or kwryg a round body or vessel.\n\nLateen Sail.\n\nAnother bond of connection between the east and the west is the lateen sail. The ancient sailors in the Mediterranean, the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Romans seem to have used square sails only. In late Roman times (A.D. 100-200) a triangular sail was introduced. It was called Suppara, a word which is very seldom mentioned and is of unknown origin. The word lateen or Latin shows that the knowledge of the triangular sail came to West Europe from the Mediterranean. The Arab word for a lateen sail shira-of-faukani literally top-sail seems to show that they borrowed the lateen sail from Western India where it is the sail or shid. It therefore seems probable that the knowledge and use of the lateen sail spread west from India.\n\nCargo.\n\nAnother seafaring word that seems to have travelled from the east westward is cargo. The usual derivation of cargo is from a low Latin word carricare to load. But the old English form of the word, its present form in Portuguese and Spanish is cargazon, and its use by one of the sixteenth century voyagers shows that cargazon was then applied not to the lading but to the documents referring to the lading, and so suggests the Arab k\u00e1ghaz or papers.\n\n---\n\n1 Lucan Pharsalia, V. 429. 'Summaque pandens Supparas velorum peri\u00fcras colligit auras. And loosing the top Supparas of the sails catches the dying breeze.' See also Statius, VII. 32; Lindsay's Merchant Shipping, XXXVIII. In the passage from the Pharsalia the Suppara seems to be a top sail, and the word Suppara may have that meaning and be a translation of the Arab name shira-of-faukani.\n\n2 The use of a lateen sail, as the main sail, in Europe seems to date from the time of Constantine the Great (A.D. 400), whose fleet is specially mentioned as sailing with a side wind. Stevenson, 266. Another debt which the west owes to the east in the matter of sailing is the device of reefing. See Gaspar Correa's (1514-1583) description of the Indian practice of making the sail as small as they pleased. Three Voyages of Da Gama, 242.\n\n3 The merchants do give the cargazon of all their goods to the broker. C\u00e6sar Frederic (1563-1585); Hakluyt's Voyages, II. 343.\n\nBesides gallies, grabs, galvats, balloons, praws, and shebars, which have been described either in the text or in the History Chapter, the early English accounts mention several curiously named vessels. The chief of these are ketches or dorishis, hoyes, foists, and snows. The Ketch is described as a square-rigged vessel with a large and a small mast. The name is said to be a West Europe corruption of the Turkish kaik or kaigue. According to Low (Indian Navy, I. 65), its other name dorish-comet from the Gujarati dodha one and a half, because its mizzen mast was about half the height of its main mast. The Hoy, which according to Smith took its name from stopping to pick up cargo and passengers when called 'Hoy' to, was a sloop. The Foist was a quick sailing boat from the Portuguese fuista a tree or beam. The Snow was very like a brig, except that in the snow the boom mainsail was hooped to a trysail mast close to the main mast. (Low's Indian Navy, I. 209 note). The word snow is said to come from the German snau, a snout or beak.\nIn connection with the sea trade between the east and the west the disputed question of the origin of the compass claims notice. The magnet and its power of drawing iron were as well known to the Romans (Pliny, A.D. 77, Nat. His. Bk. xxxiv, chap. xiv. and xvi.) as to the early Hindus. But Pliny does not seem to have known that the magnet had power to make iron turn to the north, while the early Hindu astrologers are said to have used the magnet, as they still use the modern compass, in fixing the north and east in laying foundations and in other religious ceremonies. Though the compass now universally, or at least generally, used by Hindu Joshis is the European compass, there is said to have been an older compass, an iron fish that floated in a vessel of oil and pointed to the north. The fact of this older Hindu compass seems placed beyond doubt by the Sanskrit word *mahechh-yantra* or fish machine, which Molesworth gives as a name for the mariner's compass.\n\nIn the eighth and ninth centuries the Khalifas induced learned Br\u00e1hmans to settle at Baghhd\u00e1d, and, under their teaching, the Arabs made great progress in navigation, trigonometry, astronomy, and medicine. The fact that in the Arab word for the polarized needle *kudb-nam\u00e1*, *kudb* the north pole is Arabic and *nam\u00e1* the pointer is Persian, suggests that the Arabs did not know of the polarity of the needle, till after their conquest of Persia, and that they learned it from Br\u00e1hman astrologers. Masudi's (915) accounts of navigation seem to show that the Arabs of his time had not begun to use the needle. When the Arabs began to steer by the needle is not known. Early in the thirteenth century a Mediterranean captain is mentioned as steering at night by the help of a polarized iron needle buoyed on the surface of a jar of water by a cross reed or piece of wood. About the same time captains in the Indian seas are said to have steered by the help of a magnetised iron fish which pointed to the north. Another writer of a slightly earlier date (1218) notices that the magnet which made iron point to the north came from India.\n\nIt is curious that about seventy years later Marco Polo (1290) takes no notice of the Indian knowledge of this north-pointing fish, and that the Italian traveller Nicolo Conti (1420-1440), who was specially acquainted with navigation, says that the Indians never used the compass (India in XVth Century, Nicolo Conti, 27). At the same time Fra Mauro, another Italian writer of the fifteenth century (Vincent's Periplus, II. 673; Stevenson's Sketch of Discovery, 332), notices that all Indian ships carried astronomers, who seem to correspond with Nicolo Conti's (India in XVth Century, 26) Br\u00e1hman astronomers who by supernatural power were\n\n---\n\n1 Colonel J. W. Watson (Nov. 2, 1882) supplies the following valuable note from K\u00e1thi\u00e1war. The modern compass under the name of *h\u00e1lkka yantra* is used by all the coasting crews. But there was an older compass a needle in the shape of a fish which was kept floating in a vessel of oil or water and by some magnetic power always pointed to the north. It is said to have been invented by Mai D\u00e1nav the father-in-law of R\u00e1van. An account of it is given in the K\u00e1shyap Sanhita of Kashyap Rishi.\n\nMr. Miller says (20th October 1882), about fifteen years ago a Kh\u00e1rva from V\u00e1r\u00e1val told me he was going to sail his *kh\u00f3ta* to Aden. I asked him how he steered. He said by the compass. But that his forefathers did not use the compass but steered by a small iron fish floating in a basin of oil and pointing to the north.\n\n2 The Arab knowledge of astronomy dates from the eighth century, Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, xi.; compare Reinaud's Memoir Sur. l'Inde, 309, 311, 315.\n\n3 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccix.\n\n4 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, cciii. ociv. It is worthy of note that these writers do not speak of the needle or fish compass as new inventions. Another account (Stevenson's Sketch, 328) cites a notice of the compass in a French poet of the end of the twelfth century.\nAppendix A.\n\nTh\u00e1na Boats.\n\nMariner's Compass.\n\nable to raise and to still storms. Fra Mauro tells that an Indian ship, in crossing from India to Africa, was driven about 2000 miles to the south and west, and that the astronomer on board brought her back after sailing north for seventy days. In such a storm, when sun and stars must have been hid for days, it seems probable that nothing could have saved the ship but the north-pointing fish. The Br\u00e1hman astrologer's assumption of supernatural power and the fact that the Indian knowledge of a north-pointing fish escaped the notice of Marco Polo and Nicolo Conti, make it probable that the joshis or astrologers kept their knowledge of the fish a secret and claimed to tell the north by supernatural means.\n\nIn the beginning of the fourteenth century, according to a writer in the Encyclopaedia Britannica,\u00b9 the Italian Flavio Gioio worked out the modern compass by combining the north-pointing needle with the old wind-card.\u00b2\n\nThe use of the European compass spread east in the fifteenth century during the close connection between Venice and Egypt. In 1500 the Portuguese found the Turkish and Red Sea Musalm\u00e1ns provided with compasses, whose Italian name of busola or box showed that they came from Italy. The Arabs seem also to have translated busola, the Italian-box, into hokka the Arab box.\u00b3 The Hindu sailors picked up the word hokka, and the astrologers, who soon found the new compass more suitable than the old fish-machine, Sanskritized and adopted it under the title hokkayantra or the box-machine.\n\nThere remains the question whether the knowledge of the polarity of the needle came to the Hindus from the Chinese. The Chinese claim to have known of the polarity of the needle as early as the twelfth century before Christ.\u2074 It is doubtful whether they turned this knowledge to practical account. If they did they seem afterwards to have lost it. None of the Arab writers mention the use of any form of compass by the Chinese, and the Arab writers of the eighth and ninth centuries distinctly notice that the Hindus of that time were ahead of the Chinese in philosophy and astronomy.\u2075 According to Reinaud, in spite of the silence of Marco Polo (1290) and of Ibn Batuta (1350),\u2076 there is no doubt that the Chinese knew of the compass in the twelfth century after Christ and have since improved it into the modern Chinese compass. The modern Chinese compass, like the modern European compass, is a combination of a needle and a wind-card. But the facts that they call their needle the south-pointer, ting nan chin, and that the card is divided into twenty-four instead of into thirty-two points, seem to show that the Chinese and the European compasses are distinct inventions.\u2077 The want of information about the early Hindu use of the fish-machine, and the long period that passed between the introduction of Hindu astronomy and astrology into Persia and the earliest recorded use of the north-pointing fish, make the Hindu share in the discovery of the compass doubtful. Still, so far as it goes, the evidence favours the view that the Hindus found out that the magnet polarized iron, and from this knowledge invented a rough but serviceable seaman's compass in the machchh-yantra or fish machine.\n\n\u00b9 Article Ship-building. Other writers seem more doubtful about the origin of the modern compass, Stevenson's Sketch of Discovery, 328, 334.\n\u00b2 The wind card seems originally to have been made by the Greeks, Reinaud (Abu-l-fida, cc.) gives a specimen of an old Arab wind card.\n\u00b3 Reinaud's Abu-l-fida, ccxi.

Bochum, S.J., has supplied the following note on the great Christian movement in the fourteenth century of which the Mission at Th\u00e1na formed a part.\n\nFrom the beginning of the thirteenth century the Popes of Rome and the French Kings had taken a special interest in the evangelization of the powerful nation of the Moghals. During the seven years ending 1253 four embassies consisting of missionaries of the Order of St. Francis of Assissium and St. Dominic were sent partly by Pope Innocent IV and partly by King Louis IX of France to the Moghal princes in the interior of Asia. In 1289 another papal legate, the Franciscan Friar John de Montecorvino, was commissioned by Pope Nicolas IV to negotiate with the Moghal Kh\u00e1ns of Persia and China. It is to this Friar that the first Roman Catholic Missions in India, 200 years before the arrival of the Portuguese, owe their origin. We are able to trace the steps of these early missionaries in India for a period of nearly sixty years from the last ten years of the thirteenth century to the beginning of the second half of the fourteenth century. Then all trace ceases, a sign that their missionary work in India was suspended or given up. In consequence of the war with the younger brother of Kublai Kh\u00e1n, the Friar John de Montecorvino was unable to continue his journey to China by land from Tauris in Persia. He resolved to take the sea route by India to China. During a stay of thirteen months at Meliapur near Madras he learnt much of the Native Christians of St. Thomas at Meliapur and on the Malab\u00e1r Coast. In 1303, when he was settled in Peking under the protection of the Emperor, he wrote to the Pope asking him to send missionaries to India as well as to China, and in India recommending Quilon as the place best suited for missionary work. In a second letter he repeated the same request. The request was soon complied with. In 1307 a band of missionaries were sent to China; and probably before 1318 a regular mission of Franciscans and Dominicans was established on the Coromandel Coast, though it lasted for only a short time. Corvino's recommendation of Quilon was not forgotten. In 1328 the Dominican Friar Jordanus was appointed Bishop of Quilon by Pope John XXII. Jordanus had come to India in 1321 with a large missionary band of Franciscans and Dominicans, part of whom on their arrival were slain for the faith at Th\u00e1na. They had been sent from Avignon, where the Pope resided, in 1319, and, after preaching the Gospel in Persia, had come to Ormuz where they embarked on a vessel which was bound for Meliapur. At Diu they were separated into two vessels, and all trace of one of the parties was lost. The other, among whom were the Dominican\n\n---\n\n1 Ritter, Erdk.

They are also noticed by the papal legate John de Marignola, who was sent by Pope Benedict XII in 1339 at the head of fifty missionaries to China, where he stayed for four years and then sailed to India.\\(^2\\) He visited the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle at Meliapur and the Christians on the Malab\u00e1r Coast. After fourteen months he returned to Europe, and, in 1353, related to Pope Innocent IV the report of his missionary expeditions in the east.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n1 Wadding, Annales Minorum Ad. An. 1321. The suggestion may be offered that some of the monks who were connected with these missions may have passed inland by N\u00e1sik down the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri. Near N\u00edrmal on the God\u00e1v\u00e1ri, about half-way between Haidarabad and N\u00e1gpur, open air chamber-tombs or dolmens have been found*\\(^*\\) marked with large stone crosses. Jordanus found the poorer classes of Hindus near Sop\u00e1ra most willing to become Christians. Had it not been for the hostility of the Musalm\u00e1ns he felt confident of success. It seems possible that there was at that time a connection between the Sop\u00e1ra Kods and the inland Kods and that some of the Sop\u00e1ra converts may have advised the missionaries to go to a land which they knew would be friendly and which was free from the fear of Musalm\u00e1n interference.\n\nDr. Fergusson (Rude Stone Monuments, 489) notices these crosses beside the rude tombs as illustrations of Pope Gregory the Great's policy not to destroy heathen temples and buildings but to turn them to the service of God. Perhaps the missionary who consecrated the old form of burial was influenced by the feeling to which Colonel Dalton (Ethnology of Bengal, 204) has given expression in his account of the Mundas or eastern Kods, who are probably related to the builders of these cross-adorned tombs. 'I think that Mundas who become Christians may be allowed to keep as much as they wish of their beautiful funeral ceremonial. There is nothing in it repulsive to our religious sentiments.'\n\n2 Yule's Cathay.\n\n3 J. G. Meinert, John de Marignola's Travels in the East, 1339-1353, Prag. 1828, Ritter Asien IV. 2 p. 57-62.

The original of this name seems to be the un-Sanskrit (Dravidian or Kolarian) Mar\u00e1thi shel a he-goat. The Shel\u00e1r tribe are peculiar among Mar\u00e1th\u00e1s or Mar\u00e1thi-Kunbis in refusing to eat the goat. This rule against eating goats' flesh and the resemblance of their name to the word for goat suggest that this is an example of the practice, common among Bengal Kolarians, of adopting the name of an animal as a tribal distinction, making it the crest or totem, called devak in Mar\u00e1thi, and abstaining from feeding on it.\u00b9 This trace of what is considered to be a Kolarian practice is interesting in connection with the apparent relation between the Kods of the Sop\u00e1ra burial circles and the Kols and Gonds of the Central Provinces.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Dalton's Ethnology of Bengal, 161,189; Lubbock's Primitive Condition of Man, 172-173.
