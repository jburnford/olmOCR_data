Penrissen, Sarawak.\n\nAt midday on the 5th of May of this present year of grace, Mr. E. A. W. Cox, of the Sarawak Government service, and myself left Kuching for the upper waters of the Sarawak river on a long talked-of collecting expedition. Our ultimate destination was Penrissen, a mountain of 4,800 feet high, five miles from the \"ulu\" of the left hand branch of the Sarawak river, and about fifty miles as the crow flies from the sea-coast. The mountain had previously been scaled, in part at least, by Signor Beccari, Mr. A. H. Everett, Dr. G. D. Haviland and Mr. Henlerson, but had never, from a zoological point of view, been thoroughly collected over, so that our hopes of obtaining interesting and valuable results ran high.\n\nOur staff consisted of five Dyak collectors, Malay and Chinese boys, and a Chinese cook; to convey these, ourselves and our somewhat bulky baggage, three boats were requisitioned, but as events turned out proved insufficient; however the start was fair and through the lower reaches of the river all went well and comfortably. The night was spent in part at the little village of Selobang, but to catch the tide and to avoid the din of a neighbouring Chinese \"wayang,\" we re-embarked at 12 p.m. and proceeded quietly on our way till at 6.30 in the morning the first \"karungan\" or gravel bed was encountered; here we stopped for breakfast and a delightful bathe in the now somewhat rapid river. At 9 we were on again, and soon began to experience some difficulty in progression. The river abounded with shallows and small rapids; up and over these our heavy and heavily-laden boats, which to use a Malay expression \"ate much water,\" were poled and hauled only with the greatest difficulty and exertion. At the very bad places a general halt had always to be called, whilst the respective crews joined forces and hauled with ropes one boat up at a time. Late in the afternoon we finally won to Segu, and right glad were we to partake of the\nhospitality offered to us by the gentlemen then in charge of the Government coffee-estate at that place. Profiting by our experience we exchanged next day one of our heavy boats with its Malay crew for two lighter boats with crews of Land-Dyaks; these men are experts in the art of poling up against a strong and shallow stream and the women are not far behind the men. It was amusing to hear our new recruits coaching our Malay crews, the latter though secretly acknowledging the superiority of their advisers as polers were too proud to take advice in any form from those they considered in every other respect beneath their notice. With such valuable additions to our forces we proceeded up stream at a fair pace; the scenery was lovely, precipitous walls of limestone carved by the weather into every imaginable shape, rose high on either side. Their summits were clothed with a dense growth of trees and creepers, which in places almost roofed in the narrow channel up which we moved; the river itself here rippling over shallows or dashing through rocky gateways, there running calm and still under an overhanging cliff, ever added fresh beauty and interest to the scene. At night we tied up opposite the village of Burgor, and slept in the boats; an early start was made next morning and by midday, we arrived at Pankalan Ampat, thus completing the first stage of our journey. From here we dispatched messengers to the neighbouring village of Sennah, and in the evening had a visit from the Pengara and his youthful son. Thanks to a formidable looking \"surat\" from the Resident of Sarawak, we met with little difficulty in arranging the important matter of carriers, and were able next day to dispatch the heavy baggage to Sennah, following leisurely ourselves by river, preferring this to the dangers of a Land Dyak road with its picturesque though fragile bamboo bridges slung over nasty-looking places where a fall meant a broken bone or two.\n\nOn arrival at Sennah we were met with a cordial welcome by the Orang Kaya and conducted to the chief house of the village. This, as is usual amongst the Land Dyaks, consisted of four or five big houses all built up on tall piles at the summit of the most precipitous part of the river bank. The approach to the village consisted of notched logs, with or without a frail hand-rail of bamboo; communication between one house and\nanother is established by logs rounded or slightly flattened, generally as slippery as glass; in fact within the village itself no one ever walks on the ground. Beneath the houses pigs root and grunt, fowls cackle and boys fight, in a sodden mass of filth, the effluvium from which percolates freely through the open spaces between the floors of bamboo laths. The particular house in which we temporarily took up our abode was a well-built plank structure with billian attap roof, two large doors led out on to a spacious verandah at the back, which again gave on to a large open space surrounded by fowl-houses and sheds, and with ways leading off to other houses. Here and in the verandah much of the daily work is gone through, the house itself being reserved for cooking, eating and sleeping. In the verandah were a couple of large bell-shaped wooden vessels, half-filled with padi, and nearly all day long women were husking this by repeated thumpings blows administered by 3 or 4 foot poles; when husked, the padi is thrown into circular sieves of rotan, and shaken till the husks and broken grain are separated off. The Land Dyak man presents in his dress no particular feature of interest, a blue or red cloth \"chawat,\" or a pair of Chinese trousers and a head hand-kerchief generally completing his garb. The women however are more picturesque: their sole garment is a short petticoat reaching to the knees, generally of blue cloth with a red border, but their arms from elbow to wrist and their legs from just below the knee to the ankle are encircled by rows of brass rings; a shell armlet and leglet generally topping each series of rings; even the little girls are burdened with these ornaments, though otherwise innocent of clothing, and when a number of girls of different ages are seen together it is quite possible to trace a gradual distortion of the calf of the leg due to the weight of metal borne; generally also several rings of rotan dyed red or black are worn round the waist, and out-of-doors a neat close-fitting cap made of palm leaf. There were few objects of ethnographical interest to be noticed in the house. Unlike the Sea Dyak, these people neither weave their cloth, forge their weapons nor make their pottery, but buy such necessaries from Malay and Chinese traders. However, I saw, coveted and subsequently purchased a curious\nhat known as \"Bok tumbis;\" this was cylindrical, narrower at the top than at the bottom, 9 inches in height, made of coloured beads strung in striking patterns on five threads of rotan, the whole strengthened with uprights of thicker rotan. The top was open, and through the aperture the wearer\u2014always a woman\u2014pulls her hair, allowing it to stream out on all sides, it is only worn in dances during the annual harvest feast; the men on such occasions sometimes wear a necklet of tiger-cat's teeth alternated with the teeth of bats, squirrels and such like small deer. Besides elegantly-carved wooden handles for their parangs, baskets woven from rotan, without any distinctive pattern, and small oval wooden boxes for powder and shot, I could discover no other article which these people make.\n\nThat evening we held a great \"bichara,\" and after overriding the almost countless objections to carry our baggage raised by one man after another, we endeavoured to get information concerning the summit of the mountain, its conformation, the water-supply, the animals and birds, and such like matters: many yarns were spun to us, and we received a large amount of information which subsequently proved to be mainly erroneous. Though Penrissen is the hunting ground of these Sennahs, but few had ascended to any considerable altitude, so they compensated for their lack of the knowledge we wanted by unlimited romancing. Though we rose early next morning, it was nine o'clock before we could make a start on our march to the mountain; our thirty to forty coolies wanted to take only the lightest loads, whilst we naturally wanted them to take those things which we needed most, leaving the rest to follow with further detachments of coolies from outlying villages, and the apportioning of weights was a long task. At length we made a move, and after wading across the river began our tramp. The way lay through old deserted padi farms overgrown with a dense but scrubby jungle; the country was undulating in the extreme, and the path the merest track, a foot or less in breadth, at frequent intervals interrupted by bamboo bridges and batangs, for the most part rotten. As the heat was intense we found walking very trying and difficult, and were glad at twelve o'clock to rest and discuss a meal. At one o'clock we were on again, and soon reached the lower slopes of the\nmountain, and as these up to a height of 2,000 feet are clothed with bamboo jungle, we found the going much more easy. After crossing several mountain torrents, we reached late in the afternoon, at an altitude of 2,500 feet, a huge overhanging boulder of sandstone conglomerate, known to the Sennahs as Batu Tinong, and under this we pitched our camp for the night. A dashing mountain stream was quite close by, and the delight of sitting under a foaming cascade of really cold water after our exhausting day was one not readily to be forgotten. Leeches had proved persistent and troublesome throughout the day, but in my opinion the annoyance caused by them has always been somewhat exaggerated.\n\nNext morning we continued our climb until we had reached an altitude of 3,400 feet, when our guides called a final halt: the position was not particularly inviting, being a very small flat area totally shut in by tall jungle, whilst both to the front and rear the sides of the mountain sloped steeply downwards and upwards; however, as we were informed that there was no water to be had at any greater height, and further that all the Europeans who had previously visited the mountain had encamped here, we had perforce to acquiesce in our guides' decision. Our carriers made a clearing and proceeded to build us a hut; this took two or three hours to complete, as we insisted it should be commodious, solid and watertight; the poles and beams were of course felled in the jungle, and the floor, raised about two feet off the ground, was made with laths and saplings, whilst intertwined palm-leaves served for roof and walls. Every felled tree produced a small harvest of insects; a few interesting butterflies invaded the clearing, amongst them *Cyrestis seminigra*, previously only recorded from Kina Balu, whilst in the undergrowth were found snails, scorpions and centipedes, all delightfully unfamiliar to the low-country naturalist. In securing these specimens and in rigging up shelves and sleeping-bunks in our hut, making all comfortable and snug, we spent the rest of the day.\n\nOn the following day (May 13th) Mr. Cox early started out to explore the mountain at a higher elevation, and at midday returned with the report that after a stiff climb of 400 feet he had reached a magnificent plateau of considerable extent,\nwhere water was abundant and a good view readily obtainable, altogether infinitely superior to our present situation; our chagrin at having been deceived by our guides was great, but we decided to wait till the shooters returned from the jungle round about, whither they had early that morning been sent, before deciding whether it was worth while or not staying on in our present position. When eventually the hunters returned, the results of their labours were not very interesting, except the insects; of birds, a small robin-like species, dull in colour (*Alcippe cinerea*) was the only one at all characteristic of a mountain ornis. Mr. Cox therefore decided to visit next day the actual summit of the mountain, and if much of interest was seen or procured, to stay there for 10 days or a week. In accordance with this idea he and all the collectors, except one, whose services I retained, departed on the 14th.\n\nAt mid-day I received word that they had reached the actual summit. Up to 4,500 feet the climbing had not been particularly difficult, but the last 300 feet was a sheer precipice of sand-stone conglomerate with a few narrow ledges at infrequent intervals, and to scale this, ladders had to be improvised; the summit was found to be quite flat, about half a mile long by two hundred yards broad, a dreary wilderness of pandanus and *rotan*, with hundreds of huge trees in every stage of life, from full and vigorous growth to absolute decay. Animal life was very scarce, and as a strong wind was blowing, bringing up a dense fog, Mr. Cox decided to descend to the foot of the cliff and encamp there. By the bearers of his message he sent down a specimen of the trogon, *Harpectes dulitensis*, and a gigantic earthworm nearly eighteen inches long.\n\nDuring the next five days I collected assiduously round about our hut and on the plateau already alluded to, dismissed our first batch of coolies and awaited the arrival of the rest of our baggage. This came up by degrees, until finally all our belongings could be bestowed in our hut and kitchen.\n\nOn the 18th, Mr. Cox sent down to say that he had moved lower down the mountain on to a peak known as Mt. Prang, altitude 3,900 feet, and as some most curious insect larvae (*Vermileo* sp.) accompanied his letter, I determined to join him and investigate the life-history of the insect as fully as possi-\nble. At this station the hunters had erected a long lean-to on the side of the hill, and from it we had a most magnificent view of the country below us right down to the sea, fifty miles away. Unfortunately at this altitude our view was too frequently interrupted by fog and cloud, which generally swept up towards the middle of the day, and obscured everything till nightfall. From this station we made various expeditions round and about. Birds and mammals were extremely scarce, and the insects did not differ very markedly from those to be caught on the plateau; as, moreover, I had obtained alive several specimens of the fly-larva, *Vermi'eo* sp (?) * we decided to return to our original and comfortable quarters.\n\nWe descended on the 24th, and from then till the 30th lived a calm and uneventful life; our mornings from an early hour to nearly noon were spent in tramping through the jungle, hunting for birds, reptiles, insects, in fact, everything that had life in it; the afternoons in skinning, pinning out insects, bottling and labelling spirit specimens, and the other thousand and one duties which make a collector's life a busy one. An early dinner with bed to follow completed the day.\n\nThe return journey to Sennah was much like the first, save that it was accomplished in one day, one little incident only perhaps is worthy of note:\u2014as we neared the foot of the mountain our carriers suddenly espied a small tree, which to our eyes presented no particular features of interest; however, loads were thrown aside in a hurry and a rush made for the tree, which was quickly hacked down and split up, and from numberless burrows in the wood, hundreds of a peculiarly scented, pinkish larva were extracted. No adults or pupae were to be found, so beyond recognising the larva as that of a beetle, I was unable to determine the species or even family; these larvae when boiled are considered a great delicacy by the natives of the district. They certainly looked much more appetising than the fat white grubs of the big coconut beetle which these people also devour with great gusto.\n\nFrom Sennah we proceeded straight on to Pankalan Ampat, and after waiting a few days for boats and to collect\n\n* See this Journal for description of the habits of this curious larva.\nrevenue we returned to Kuching, arriving on June 4th.\n\nTaken as a whole, the expedition was a great success, but the very great scarcity of mammals and birds was disappointing; only two kinds of monkey were seen. The cry of a solitary Wa-Wa was heard, but occasionally; pigs, deer, kijang and pelandok were noticeable only by their absence, and not a single game bird was procured or even seen. This scarcity I attribute to the fact that 60 per cent of the Dyaks of a by no means thinly populated district are armed with guns, which they constantly use, huge foraging parties going out before every harvest feast and keeping up for days a constant fusillade on anything above the size of a thrush; further I am inclined to suspect that this the Southern end of Sarawak in less faunistically rich than the more Northern regions. Certainly the list of birds which we obtained on Penrissen must compare somewhat unfavourably with those published by the late Mr. John Whitehead and by Mr. Charles Hose of Baram, two gentlemen whose labours on Mts. Kina Balu and Dulit are so well known in the zoological world.\n\nReptiles and amphibia were moderately abundant, and three species of fish were captured in a mountain stream by the use of Tuba. The invertebrate fauna was extremely rich, and much attention was paid to forming large collections of insects, and arthropods in general, and I am confident that, entomologically at least, no mountain in Borneo has been so well worked at as was Penrissen during our stay there.\n\nVery little time was at our disposal to collect satisfactorily the flora of the mountain; the small collections made, however, have proved to be of such interest (see Appendix to the article) that I have determined to send back my collectors to the mountain in October, almost entirely to botanise.\n\nLists of the animals obtained will appear from time to time in this Journal in the order in which they are worked out. At present I am indebted to Mr. Ridley for working out the plants (Phanerogams only) obtained, and to His Lordship the Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak for the appended list of, and remarks on, the ferns.\n\nR. Shelford,\nAPPENDIX I.\n\nList of the Mammals of Penrissen.\n\n1. *Hylobates leuciscus* Schreb. No specimen of this was captured.\n\n2. *Semnopithecus rubicundus* M\u00fcll. Extremely common, not differing in any way from low-country specimens.\n\n3. *Macacus cynomolgus* L. Two specimens were shot near the summit of the mountain, and were remarkable for the great length of the hair round the face.\n\n4. *Hipposiderus* sp. (?) This is perhaps a new species, a matter to be decided by Mr. Oldfield Thomas, of the British Museum.\n\n5. *Tupaia* sp. (?) Closely mimicked by *Sciurus everetti*. The species may possibly be *T. m\u00fclleri*, described lately by Kohlbrugge.\n\n6. *Tupaia minor* Gthr.\n\n7. *Ursus malayanus* Raffles. A large specimen of this bear was encountered as we were on our way down the mountain and, as guns were not handy, the animal made good his escape before a shot could be fired.\n\n8. *Paradoxurus hermaphrodyta* Schreb. This and the following two species are about the only mammals which the Land Dyaks do not eat.\n\n9. *Arctictes binturong* Raffles. Native name \u201ct\u00fbn.\u201d\n\n10. *Herpestes brachyurus* Gray.\n\n11. *Sciurus (Ratufa) bicolor ephippium* M\u00fcll. Somewhat to my surprise this squirrel was exactly the same as the variety obtained round Kuching. It is a species which varies\nmost markedly in different localities, mountain forms being as a rule much darker and redder.\n\n12. *Sciurus hippocurus* Geoff.\n13. *Sciurus tenuis* Horsf.\n14. *Sciurus (Funambulus) everetti* Thos.\n15. *Nannosciurus melanotis* M\u00fcll. and Schleg.\n16. *Mus margarettae* Thos.

Kina Balu and of Mr. C. Hose\u2019s collections on Mt. Dulit. Not only was the number of species obtained small, but bird-life in general, with the exception of Barbets, was most noticeably scarce. I attribute this scarcity partly to the fact that the mountain has long been the happy hunting-ground of the Land Dyaks, 60% of whom are armed with guns; all the game birds seem to have been shot or trapped, for we certainly neither saw nor heard one, whilst hornbills, profiting by a large experience of the sound of a shot, were very difficult to approach. A good collection of low-country birds was made at Pankalan Ampat, at the head of the left-hand branch of the Sarawak river, and about 10 miles from the foot of Penrissen. Amongst other good things we were fortunate enough to obtain there, was a specimen of a kingfisher, rare in Borneo, *Alcedo erythronota*.\n\nWith the exception of a small fly-catcher, too battered for description, and an obscure little greenish Timeling, allied to\nMicornis, all the species obtained are well known, thanks chiefly to the labours of Mr. Hose on Mt. Dulit. As each of the above-mentioned specimens are unique, and as my knowledge of systematic ornithology is somewhat inadequate, I refrain from describing them, until further material can be obtained. I have followed the classification adopted by Mr. Everett in his list of Bornean birds (cf. this Journal No. 20, 1889,) and I have included those species obtained by Mr. Everett in a former expedition to Penrissen.\n\nFAMILY TURDIDE.\n\n1. Myiophonus borneensis Sclater, Ibis 1885, p. 123. One young specimen of this species was obtained, differing so markedly from the adult, that I was inclined to regard it as a new species; a subsequent careful comparison with a skin of a typical female from Mt. Dulit revealed its identity. The back wings and tail are of a very dark brown, and the feathers of the breast and head have the shafts and tips white, the webs of these feathers are not so well developed as in the adult, and there is no trace of any blue coloration on the wings. Feet purple. 4,100 feet.\n\n2. Copsychus saularis L. Sharpe, Cat. B. vii. p. 65. Common everywhere in the low-country.\n\n3. Cittocincla suavis Sclater. Sharpe, Cat. B. vii. p. 87.

Stachyris borneensis Sharpe. Ibis 1887, p. 449. A common species on Penrissen. A nest with three eggs was found, the eggs are white (as is usual in this genus) and measure 21 by 16 mm: the nest is a loose ill-made structure.\n\n7. Malacopterum albigulare Gray. Sharpe, Cat.

We did not meet with this pretty little bird on Penrissen, where Mr. Everett formerly obtained it.\n\n26. *\u00c6githina viridissima* Sharpe. Cat. B. vi. p. 6. A very common low-country bird along the banks of rivers in their upper waters.

Everett).\n\n33. *Erythromyias sp. n* (?)\n\nOne badly shot specimen of a little fly-catcher belonging to this genus was obtained: it was quite impossible to sex the bird and it would be unwise to describe it until further material is obtained. The plumage of the upper parts and wings are as in *E. mulleri*, but the breast is ashy and the lower halves of the outer tail-feathers are white. Penrissen 4,100 feet.\n\n34. *Rhipidura perlata* S. Mull. Sharp, Cat. B. iv. p. 328. Common up to 3000 feet.\n\n35. *Tersiphone affinis* Blyth. Sharp, Cat. B. iv. p. 349. Low country and up to 3000 feet. Known as the \"rain-bird\" by the natives.\n\n36. *Philentoma velatum* Temm. Sharpe, Cat. B. iv. p. 365. Ranges up to 4000 feet. The young male resembles the adult females very closely, but the plumage on the abdomen and rump is generally admixed with earthy brown.\n\n37. *Philentoma pyrrhopterum* Temm. Sharpe, Cat. B. iv. p. 366. Occurs side by side with the preceding species; both are easily called up to the gun. Mr. E. Bartlett former curator of the Sarawak Museum described in this Journal (April 1894) a new species of *Philentoma*, *P. maxuelli*. I have examined the solitary specimen in the Museum collection and have very grave doubts of its distinctness from *P. pyrrhopterum*; a quite asymmetrical patch of chestnut on the breast is the only distinguishing feature, and prefer to regard the bird merely as a some-\nwhat abnormal variation, until further material is obtained; but as seven years have elapsed since the specimen was shot and more or less continuous collecting in the same area has not brought to light a similar one, though both *pyrrhopterum* and *velatum* are common enough, I hold no very strong hopes of matching the specimen with another.\n\n38. *Culicicapa ceylonensis* Swains. Sharpe, Cat. B. iv. p. 369. Penrissen and surrounding low-country.\n\n39. *Siphipa beccariana* Salvad. Sharpe, Cat. B. iv. p. 452. Penrissen 4,000 feet.\n\n40. *Siphipa (?) everetti* Sharpe, Ibis. 1890, p. 366. Penrissen 4000 feet.\n\nI am not at all certain that I have identified this species correctly; its nearest ally seems to be *Stoparola panayensis* Sharpe from the Philippines, judging from a description of that species, the distinction between the genera *Stoparola* and *Siphipa* is a very small one, merely a question of the proportion of culmen-length to breadth at the gape.\n\n**Fam.

We noticed the bird when descending the river from the Dyak village of Sennah to Pankalan Ampat, and about a week later my collectors shot it. Unfortunately by this time I had returned to Kuching, and was consequently unable to sex the bird myself or to make colour notes, and I am afraid that as a result of native carelessness, the present label \"female\" is untrustworthy. The specimen is a very small one, the total length being only 6.5 in. as against 8 in., the total length of the full-grown adult. It possesses the blue pectoral band spotted with white, characteristic only of the male, and the lower parts are not ferruginous as is usual in females: in many small points this specimen differs slightly from Dr. Sharpe's description (l. c.) but nevertheless I am sure that my identification is correct.\n\n65. *Ceyx (?) erythra* Sharpe. Sharpe, Cat. B. xvii. p. 179.\nThe genus Ceyx is in a most confused condition, and I am therefore extremely doubtful about a young specimen of this little Kingfisher which was shot close to the summit of Penrissen. The bill is extremely short; '8 inch, as against 1.5 of the adult, and is black, paler towards the tip instead of coral red. The wing-coverts and scapulars are red and there is no blue spot behind. The wing coverts as in *C. erythra*, but there is a black frontal patch as in *C. dillwyni*: further *C. dillwyni* has been found on Dulit, but *C. erythra* has not; I am therefore completely puzzled as to the correct name for our Penrissen specimen, and must wait until I can see more young specimens of both species before absolutely deciding.\n\n66. *Halcyon concreta* Temm.

Shelley, Cat. B. xix. p. 72.\nAll over the mountain. This bird exhibits considerable variation in plumage in relation both to sex and age (cf. Salvadori Occ. Bor. Tav.

RIDLEY.\n\nThis collection, though a small one, contains a large proportion of novelties, showing that a more complete botanical survey would be well worth making. The plants obtained are of typical Bornean mountain flora facies, and most closely resemble the plants of Kina Balu in North East Borneo.\n\n*Sonerila borneensis* Cogn. at 3,500 feet; flowers white, stamens yellow.\n\n,, ,, Var (?) A smaller plant nearly glabrous, common.\n\n*Begonia borneensis*. A. D. C. At 3,000 feet alt.\n\n*Argostemma gracile* Stapf. Mt. Seruru, a Peak of Penrissen, 4,500 feet. Only previously known from Mt. Kina Balu.\n\n*Ophiorrhiza fibrillosa* n. sp.\n\nStem over a foot tall, rather stout, covered with short scattered brown hairs. Leaves lanceolate acute at both ends 12 nerved, 4 inches longer less, 1\u00bd inch wide green and glabrous above glaucous beneath and nerves covered with red hairs, petiole \u00bd inch long covered with red hairs. Stipules narrow divided into two branches each ending in subulate fibrils, persistent \u00bc inch long hairy. Cymes in terminal axils much shorter than the leaves covered with red wool, about an inch long. Flowers shortly petioled white, Calyx pustular teeth short acute. Corolla tube dilate at base \u00bc inch long, lobes short oblong obtuse pustular. Stamens oblong obtuse, filaments very short. Style slender, stigma broadly bilobed lobes rounded. Fruit absent. At 4,000 feet, flowers white.\n\nAllied to *O. subfalcifolia* Miq. The stipules are peculiar in being broken up into fibrils, and being persistent, and are\ncrowded together in the terminal buds, giving them a curious tufted appearance.\n\n*Rhododendron cuneifolium* var. *subspathulatum*.\n\nA much branched twiggy plant, leaves mostly spathulate apices not truncate as in the type; flower tubular, lobes quite rounded. At 4,500 feet. Flowers red waxy. This might perhaps be distinguished as a separate species, but the materials, comprising but a single flower, are hardly adequate. The type was obtained on Kina Balu by Dr. Haviland.\n\n*Nepenthes tentaculata* Hook fil. The only species seen, on the top of a felled tree, at 4,000 feet altitude. Not rare in North Borneo.\n\n*Eria megalopha* n. sp.\n\nRhizome slender \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch thick covered with short brown sheaths, roots long and wiry. Stems distant \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to an inch apart slender slightly thickened above, covered with brown short scattered sheaths, 4 to 5 inches tall less than \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch through. Leaves 2, narrow lanceolate acuminate base acute 7 nerved \\( 3\\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide. Flower orange from a tuft of papery brown sheaths \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, above the leaves. Pedicel and ovary very slender \\( \\frac{5}{8} \\) inch long. Upper sepal lanceolate \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, lower ones broader subfalcate. Petals linear lorate, narrower. Lip \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch long, base narrow fleshy curved, with a process at base, lateral lobes falcate obtuse broad, terminal one broadly subquadrate margins rounded. Apex broad truncate \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch across; two low rounded ridges between the lateral lobes, and a single large thin keel edge denticulate running the whole length of the midlobe and ending in a projecting point, with three short parallel ridges on each side at right angles to central ridge. Column long arched. At 4,000 feet alt. Flower orange. Allied to *E. neylecta* Ridl. but differs in its very slender stems, remote from each other, and remarkable lip with an unusually large central keel.\n\n*Calanthe Shelfordi* n. sp.\n\nLeaves nine, petiole 3 inches long tapering into the lanceolate acuminate blade 1 foot long, 2 inches across, five nerved,\nherbaceous plicate. Raceme 8 inches long slender. Flowers numerous flesh color, nearly an inch across. Pedicels slender $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long. Sepals oblong lanceolate acute, upper one broadest. Petals broadly spatulate acute. Lip 3 lobed much shorter $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long, lateral lobes short rounded, median elongate linear oblong apex dilated rounded then acute; spur $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long pendulous dilated and hooked at apex; calli on lip 2 small wartlike processes. Clinandrium deep edges thin elevated undulate, rostellum long acuminate. At 4,800 feet near summit. Flowers flesh color. Perhaps as near *C.

The island of Singapore with the small islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong in the Johore strait and a few smaller ones lying within English waters form the area the flora of which is enumerated in this paper. The whole is little more than 200 square miles in extent and consists of undulating country, the highest hill being Bukit Timah with an altitude of 500 feet above sea level. The Geology of the island was the subject of a paper by Mr. J. R. Logan (Journ. As. Soc. Beng. xvi. p. 519, published in 1846), but unfortunately he much misunderstood it, mistaking sedimentary rocks for volcanic ones. The bigger hills, Bukit Timah, Bukit Mandai, and Tanjong Gol, are composed of a grey granite, which crops out again near Bajau, Changi and Pulau Ubin. The rest of the island is covered with sedimentary deposits of clays, gravels, and sands, often very ferruginous and permeated with bands of clay-ironstone, very much resembling that of some of the Wealden beds in Kent. This clay iron-stone has unfortunately received the name of Laterite here, a name properly applied to soils baked by a lava-flow, or other volcanic heat. These sedimentary rocks have never produced any fossils except some obscure traces of vegetable remains. They appear to have been derived from disintegrated and decomposed granite, the ironstone bands being formed in many cases at a much later date. No borings of any depth having been made it is impossible to say how deep these strata are, but it is probable that they are of very great thickness and comparatively modern, as appears to be the case in Selangor and elsewhere. In the south of the island in some spots the strata are very strongly upheaved.\n\nOriginally the island appears to have been covered with a dense forest, except along the mangrove edged rivers and the sandy tract of country lying between Tanjong Ru and Changi point. But soon after it was acquired, a great deal of this forest\nwas felled, partly for the value of the timber and partly for cultivation. Later a very large proportion of the cleared ground was abandoned, and became covered with secondary growth, or lalang, and every year still sees the disappearance of some woodland, so that in several of the localities quoted for certain plants in this list, such as Ang Mo Kio, few traces of any native plants can now be found. The names of many villages and districts are taken from trees which doubtless plentiful fifty years ago are now either very scarce or quite extinct. Such are Kranji (Dialium,) Changi (Balanocarpus), Tampenis (Sloetia siderylon), Tanjong Ru, the Cape of Casuarinas, Kampong Gelam, the village of Melaleuca. Extensively as the indigenous flora has been destroyed in this way, I have succeeded in finding most of the plants collected here by Wallich in 1822; and of those mentioned in his Catalogue which I have not recovered, some at least were evidently wrongly localised, having been probably collected in Penang. Many of the trees, however, which were probably formerly more abundant, are represented now by single specimens.\n\nA few fairly large and representative tracts of jungle remain, and though in most cases much of the more valuable timber has been removed, these contain the most varied and interesting portions of the flora. Among the biggest trees therein are the Dipterocarpea, Dyera, Dichopsis, Irvingia, Kumpassia, species of Mangifera, Artocarpus and Tarrietia. Mixed with these are numerous smaller trees and shrubs of all orders, with rattans, and other palms, and especially in rocky spots and damp watercourses, are ground orchids, Scitamineae, aroids, ferns, Ebermaiera, Pentaphragma, Cyrtandrae and many other smaller plants. Here too grow the curious little saprophytes Thismia, Sciaphila, Aphyllorchis, Burmannia, etc. Many climbing plants such as Uncaria, Willughbeia, Bauhinia, Strychnos and Gnetum form huge lianes climbing to the tops of the trees and covering them with a mat of foliage. On the branches of the loftiest trees grow many epiphytes not met with elsewhere, orchids, ferns, such as the rare Davallia triphylla, Rhododendron, Vaccinium and Dischidia, and it is interesting to note that many of these plants, which in the low country grow only on this elevated position, are to be met with as terrestrial or rock plants at greater elevations in the peninsula. The banks of the larger streams and rivers and a\ngood portion of the coast line where mud is deposited are edged with a thick mangrove jungle composed of *Rhizophoraceae* (*Rhizophora*, *Bruguiera*, *Ceriops*) *Carapa*, *Lumnitzera*, *Avicennia* and *Heritiera* on the branches of which grow abundance of small orchids, ferns, *Lycopodium*, *Psilotum*, *Heptapleurum*, *Pachycentria*, *Medinillopsis* and other epiphytes, while in the mud on suitable spots grow such herbaceous plants as *Acanthus*, *Cryptocoryne ciliata*, *Tristellateia*, *Octocharis* and some *Cyperaceae* and grasses. Inland just behind the mangroves the ground is often sandy and covered with woods of comparatively small trees, *Eugenia*, *Podocarpus*, *Geloniun*, *Arystea*, *Afzelia*, etc., with clumps of the Nibung palm (*Oncosperma tigliariaria*), and on these and on the ground grow many orchids, *Cirrhopterum*, *Bulbophyllum*, *Coelogyne*, *Plocoglottis*, *Platyclinis*, and *Eria*.\n\nThe coast line from Tanjong Ru to Changi is also very sandy, and here is a very distinct flora much resembling that which borders the Pahang river near its mouth. It is rich in grasses and sedges, *Nyris*, *Cyanotis*, and other herbaceous plants, with bushes of *Rhodomyrtus*, *Vaccinium*, *Leucopogon*, *Capparis*, *Eugenia*, etc. Unfortunately a great portion of this district has been put under coconut cultivation, and the greater part of the flora has disappeared, except at Changi point where it still remains.\n\nAs a very large portion of the island has been cleared and cultivated, and often abandoned, there are very large tracts covered either with Lalang (*Imperata cylindrica*) or fern either *Gleichenia Linearis* or bracken, *Pteris aquilina* or in swampy spots with *Selvia* to the exclusion of almost everything else. In many places however secondary growth has sprung up (Belukar). This consists of small trees or shrubs of *Macaranga javanica* and *M. hypoleuca*, *Rhodamnia trinervia*, *Adinandra dumosa*, *Vitis pubescens*, *Melastoma polyanthum*, *Archytea Vahlii*, *Arthrophyllum diversifolium* and a few others.\n\nIn waste ground near villages and in cultivated spots are a number of weeds, many of which are well known as very widely distributed plants, and most of which have probably been introduced accidentally or intentionally at no very great distance of time. These weeds include most of the *Compositae*, Grasses, *Labiatae* and probably all the *Umbelliferae* and *Solana-\nIt is perhaps worth noting that very few of these are to be found in Wallich's collection made in 1822, showing that in all probability they were introduced at a later date. Among these weeds one or two are interesting as not occurring in India, such are *Clitoria cajanifolia*, and *Cleome aculeata*, both South American plants, which also occur as weeds in Java, whence probably they were carried accidentally to Singapore.\n\nThe flora geographically speaking is typically Malayan, and resembles as might be expected that of Johore, and to a certain extent that of the neighbouring coast of Sumatra. A few plants occurring here are as far as is known endemic, but it is probable that most will be re-discovered in the neighbouring countries, when they are more thoroughly explored. These endemic plants not known to occur elsewhere are marked with a *. The absence of certain plants common in the peninsula is somewhat remarkable, such are *Eurya acuminata* and *Grewia umbellata*, and there are several striking plants to be found on the neighbouring islands, and on the coast of Johore, especially near Tanjong Kupang, which are quite absent from our flora. Of the native flora it will be noticed that the greater number of plants are either trees or shrubs, herbaceous plants being comparatively scarce in the forests, and chiefly to be found in the open country in the sandy district of the coast. Those of the forest region being usually epiphytes, orchids, Piperaceae, or Scitamineae, aroids, grasses and sedges, with a few saprophytes.\n\nThe most extensively represented orders here are those of the *Eupobiaceae*, *Urticaceae*, *Rubiaceae* and *Orchidaceae*. The variety of the latter will surprise many residents who have probably seen not more than one or two species growing wild here, but the fact that these plants are very local and frequently occur on the upper branches of the loftiest trees, where they are difficult to see and to obtain, accounts for their being so often overlooked. The largest genera are those of the Figs (*Ficus*) and nutmeg (*Myristica*).\n\nAs in most equatorial regions, the number of species in proportion to the number of individuals is very large. A Malay jungle consists of innumerable trees, shrubs and climbers, all apparently distinct, and individuals of any one species occurring singly here and there, often very far apart, so that these forests\nhave a very different appearance from those of the more temperate zones, which frequently consist of but one or two kinds. The contrast is well seen in comparing the English flora with that of Singapore. In Singapore with an area of 200 square miles we have over 1,900 species of flowering plants, while the flora of the British Isles with an area of 121,115 square miles produces but 1,200 species, while of ferns we have here over 130 species, nearly double the number in Europe, and more than three times the number in the British Isles.\n\nSeasons. There is no great amount of difference in the rainfall throughout the year, although as a rule heavier falls occur in December and January than at other times, so that plants here have no definite resting periods and are nearly all truly evergreen. Certain plants, however, such as *Cratoxylon formosum* and *Ficus Miquelii* shed all their leaves at tolerably regular intervals, remaining quite bare for one or two days, when the young shoots begin to unfold, and in a few days they are quite leafy again. This change is often but not always followed immediately by the appearance of the flowers, and often the young leaves thus produced are of a brighter green, or brilliant red, orange, white or blue. This change takes place usually three or four times a year, and every tree of the kind in the district undergoes the change on the same day. It is not till we get north of Penang that we find a definite period of rest in which all or almost all plants shed their leaves altogether and become quite bare. A good series of observations on these phenological phenomena would probably throw light on the causes of these irregular seasons.\n\nVery few plants have a definite flowering month. A large number flower more or less steadily throughout the year. Others flower at regular periods three or four times a year, almost every plant of a given kind flowering simultaneously in the district. This is best known in the case of the Pigeon orchid, *Dendrobium crumenatum*. In this plant the flowers are produced at periods of a little over a month, or two months. The exact day differs in different parts of the peninsula, but in each district they all appear in the same day, and it is remarkable that plants brought to Singapore even from as far north as Siam open their flowers on the day for Singapore, and not on that for Siam. It\nis not rare however to find certain plants of Pigeon orchid which do not flower on the regular day, but have a distinct day which they appear to keep to with equal regularity. A curious fact is that another species of *Dendrobium* (*D. criniferum*) invariably flowers in Singapore on the day preceding that of *D. crumenatum*, whenever that happens to be. It might be thought that the weather in the district in which the plant was growing was the influencing agent, but this appears to have but little effect on the orchids. On one occasion (Dec. 5, 1893) the pigeon orchids developed their flowers so far that they were obviously ready to open them on that day, but an extraordinarily heavy rain retarded them, and the flowers opened the next day, but except in cases like this the weather previous to the flowering does not seem to make any difference to the date of flowering. Some few plants have a regular annual flowering season, such are *Calanthe curculigoides* in September, and *Grammatophyllum*, July and August.\n\nA certain number of trees flower only every fifth year, notably the *Dipterocarpus*. Every fifth year there appears to be an average higher temperature, and a period of greater dryness in May or June than in other years, and then and only then is it possible to obtain flowers of these trees. Such trees are most of the *Dipterocarpus*, *xanthophyllum Kunstleri*, *Careya* sp. In this case also all the plants in a given district flower simultaneously. It can easily be understood that it is very important to a plant that all should flower on the same day in order that they may be cross-fertilized by the insects that visit them, and this is especially the case in plants in which the flowers last but a single day, as in the case of the Pigeon orchid, but it is difficult to see how this is brought about. A good many trees seem to flower even less often than this and there are not a few which though apparently full grown healthy trees have not given flowers once in ten years.\n\n**Colors of flowers.**\n\nAs is well known the colors of flowers depend to a large extent on the kind of insect fertilizer for which they are destined to prove attractive. The most abundant insects in the thick jungle are the flies (*Diptera*) and these appear often in enormous abundance when certain trees are in bloom. The Oaks and\nChestnuts, Sindora and Kurrimia are particularly attractive to them and the roar of their wings can be heard often at some distance from the tree. The chief of these flies is a black Musca with red eyes. The flowers of fly-fertilized plants are usually small and green or whitish, generally possessing an unpleasant odor. Smaller herbaceous plants growing in dark shady woods often have deep brownish purple flowers sometimes with an odor of carrion, at others sweet and aromatic, such as Amorphophallus, Thottia, Tacca and many orchids. These are also fly-fertilized. Many trees produce masses of white flowers in large panicles or corymbs. These are very attractive to butterflies and bees, such as many of the Eugenias, Evodia, Rhodamnia, and Melanorrhoea. I have noticed as showing the bearing of the color of the flowers on insect visitors, that while Eugenia lineata with corymbs of white flowers attracts innumerable butterflies and bees and the pollen-eating flies (Syrpha), another species of Eugenia with apple-green flowers, which is growing close by was not visited either by butterflies or bees, but by flies similar to those which visit the oaks. Pink flowers are not so common, and are usually visited by bees, as are the deep red blossoms of Cratoxylon arborescens, Gomphia Hookeri, and Eurycoma. Scarlet and bright reds are rare in Singapore except in introduced plants, but we have also the beautiful Aeschynanthus, Rhododendron, some Loranthi, and some species of Hornstedtia. The red flowers are most attractive to the Sun-birds, and to butterflies. Bright yellow flowers are chiefly to be met with in open country especially near the sea; such are Wedelia, Xyris, Philydrum, Utricularia (most), Wormia, Timonius, and Gomphia sumatrana. The rarest color of all is blue, which is also to be met with almost exclusively in open spots. Burmannia coelestis, Commelina, Cyanotis, Utricularia affinis, Evolculus, Monochoria, Desmodium heterophyllum, are almost the only native blue flowers here.\n\nVisitors to the tropics are often surprised by the apparent paucity and inconspicuousness of the flowers. This is partly due to the enormous proportion of foliage, which conceals the flowers, but the fact that the greater number of our flowers are adapted for fertilization by Diptera and small Hymenoptera, the most abundant insects in the forests, and are consequently small and green or whitish, accounts to a large extent for the small\namount of show that the blossoms make in the great masses of foliage.\n\nBotanists. The number of botanists who have collected or studied the flora of Singapore is even more limited than that of Penang. The first of them was naturally Sir Stamford Raffles who aided by William Jack made extensive collections, all or almost all of which were destroyed in the burning of the \"Fame.\" (For an account of Jack and some others of the Singapore botanists, see Journal 25, p. 163). Shortly after the founding of Singapore Nathaniel Wallich came to Singapore to recuperate after his great Nepaul expedition. He remained here about five months and established the first Botanic Garden, Nov. 1822, being Superintendent of it. This Garden, consisting of 48 acres, included the Government Garden on what is now known as Fort Canning Hill. After he returned to Calcutta, Jan. 1823, Dr. Montgomerie took charge of the Garden till 1827. Wallich seems to have promised to send an assistant from Calcutta Gardens, but did not do so. The Garden, which chiefly contained Nutmegs and Cloves, was abolished later, and no trace of it remains. Dr. Wallich seems to have taken some interest in the development of Singapore, and was one of a committee of three to fix on the site of the town. He built a house, Botany Hall, to stay in during his residence here.\n\nHis collection of dried plants was an extensive one, and was eventually distributed with the rest of the East India Company's herbarium. The greater number of species which he discovered here I have been able to find still in Singapore, but some appear to have quite vanished. This is not surprising when it is remembered that at that time the district in which he was collecting, viz. the neighbourhood of the town, was thick jungle, of which nearly every trace has now disappeared under cultivation. In his Catalogue many of the plants are localised \"Singapore et Penang,\" and as I note that many of these are strictly hill plants occurring at a higher elevation than there is in Singapore, I take it that these plants were in a collection of which the exact locality was lost, and that the label perhaps should have been rather \"Singapore or Penang.\" Some few however of the specimens labelled as from this region have never since been found in the peninsula, e.g. Xylia dolabriformis, a\nwell known Indian tree, and it is probable that the locality is quite wrong.\n\nCol. Farquhar, the first Resident of Singapore, and John Prince, Resident Councillor in 1827, who took a little interest in the botany of the island, are commemorated in the names of some plants, e.g. *Myristica Farquhariana*, and *Erycibe Princei*, but little was done in botanical research for many years. In or about 1839, Hugh Cuming well known for his immense botanical and conchological collections in the Philippines, visited Singapore and also ascended Mount Ophir. While in the Straits he seems to have chiefly devoted himself to collecting orchids, and to have sent home a number of live ones, among which were *Coelogyne Cumini*, and *Dendrobium longicollis*. William Lobb, orchid collector for Messrs Veitch, visited Penang and Singapore in 1845, but as mentioned in Journal 25, p. 166, his specimens from the Straits Settlements, Java and India were all mixed up in distribution, so that his localities as quoted in books are quite doubtful. Surgeon-General Maingay during his residence in Singapore made extensive collections, but many of these again were irregularly labelled, and some mentioned in the Flora of British India as from Singapore were probably either collected in Malacca or Penang.\n\nMr. Murton the first head of the present Botanic Gardens, 1875 to 1880, collected a number of plants, of which a few were sent to Kew, and a few, chiefly ferns, are still in the Botanic Gardens Herbarium. N. Cantley, who succeeded him, employed collectors and obtained a very large number of specimens, but unfortunately hardly any were strictly localised, and many labelled from Singapore in the herbarium, are either cultivated plants or from some part of the peninsula, so that in most cases I have been unable to quote safely from his herbarium.\n\nAmong other collectors whose names appear in books, associated to a small extent with Singapore plants, should be mentioned, Dr. Thomas Oxley, who wrote some papers in Logan's Journal, one of which dealt with the Flora of Singapore, but chiefly with Economic plants, while other papers treat of Nutmegs and Gutta percha. He seems to have collected plants, saying that he had collected between 40 and 50 orchids, but what became of his collections and manuscripts, I cannot find\nout. He died in or about 1858.\n\nSir Robert Schomburgk, well known for his explorations in Guiana, where he discovered the Victoria regia, was appointed British Consul in Siam in 1857. He visited Singapore and collected a few plants there, which he sent to Kew, and which were described in the Flora of British India. Some of them, however, were evidently obtained from gardens.\n\nDr. T. Anderson, 1832 to 1870, was Director of Calcutta Botanic Gardens. He appears to have visited Singapore at some time, and obtained several plants of interest. He devoted himself to the Acanthaceae, and Eranthemum Andersoni Mast, a common garden plant here was named after him.\n\nMr. R. W. Hullett made some years ago an excellent herbarium of Singapore plants, which he eventually presented to the Botanic Gardens. Duplicate specimens were sent to Kew and to Calcutta, where they were named, and several new species bear his name.\n\nIn the following list all plants with no collector's name were obtained by myself or by native collectors employed at the Gardens, and the numbers attached are those of my distribution-series. Endemic species, not yet known from elsewhere are marked with an asterisk and introduced plants, which have not properly established themselves but which occur in waste ground and the like, are included in brackets. The Mosses, Lichens, Fungi and Algae, are deferred. Collections of these have been made and submitted to experts, and I hope to publish an account of them at a later date.\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\nDILLENIACE\u00c6.\n\n*Tetracera Assa* Dec.

The wood when fresh cut exhales an unpleasant odor. Large trees are now scarce as the natives cut them when young to make carrying sticks, and gambier stirrers, etc. There is a good deal of difference in the size of the leaves\naccording to the age of the tree. Young shoots from an old stump usually have large leaves, and it seems to me that *S. penangiana* Oliv and *S. Wallichii* King are mere states of *S. sideroxylon*, Teysm. The natives however certainly draw a distinction between some forms calling *S. Wallichii*, Tampenis putih and *S. sideroxylon*, Tampenis Merah, i.e. red and white Tampenis. The plant flowers very readily, even seedlings in a pot sometimes flower and fruit when only a foot and a half tall. The fruit is a soft white drupe enclosed in the four thickened white sepals. These are sweet and eatable and any pressure on them ejects the fruit to some distance so that if a bird attempts to eat them the fruit is thrown out.\n\nCommon in dry woods, open country, etc., especially the broad leaved var. *penangiana*. Tanglin, Chan Chu Kang, Changi, etc.\n\n**Ficus.** The figs are tolerably well represented here, no less than 35 species occurring in the island. They comprise creeping shrubs, big climbers, erect shrubs from two feet tall to trees of great size. The figs, none of which here are eatable, are sought for by birds, especially pigeons, bulbuls and starlings, and by fruit-bats, which frequent the trees when in fruit in great numbers, and distribute the seeds everywhere. The common Malay name for any species of *Ficus* is \"Ara.\" \"Sipadik\" is applied to many scandent species, and \"Kelampong\" to such trees as bear the figs clustered on the stem. Most of the trees are of rapid growth with soft valueless timber.\n\n*F. pisifera* Wall.

T. Haughton who published a list of street names of Singapore Town with their Chinese equivalents in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in the June issue of 1891. The present compilation may be taken as a fairly complete list of the names of roads, streets and lanes in George Town with their respective Chinese names as called by the Hokkiens and Cantonese, two of the more important sections of the Chinese community in Penang, as well as with notes explaining the meaning and giving the derivation of the Chinese names. From a glance at these explanatory notes, it will be observed that the Chinese call their streets generally after some prominent buildings or objects of view, or the nationality of the people residing, or the particular kind of business carried on, in the locality. There are, however, some new and out-of-the-way places which have no Chinese names but which are inserted here partly for the purpose of making the list as complete as possible and partly for the purpose of leaving space for the insertion of any Chinese names that may be evolved in future. To this little compilation are appended (1) a list of some notable buildings and places in George Town (2) a list of some district names in town and up-country, (3) a list of the names of some islets in the vicinity of Penang and (4) a list of names of some places in Province Wellesley and Pindings; all with their Chinese equivalents. In conclusion, the compiler desires to express his best thanks to Mr. Cheam Sheow Heng, the Senior Chinese Interpreter of the Police Courts, and other friends for much valuable information concerning this compilation.\nAcheen Street: (1) Hokkien, Ko\u00e2\u00een la\u00fb-\u00e1 \u9ad8\u6a13\u4ed4 \"a small high tower,\" the high tower is the four-storied corner house at the junction of Acheen Street and Beach Street.

The former of these lived on the river of the same name, the latter along the rivers of the Johore Strait. Some accounts of these two tribes was published by Logan in Vol. i. of Logan's Journal in 1847, and illustrated by outlines of heads. The Kallangs were removed by the Tumunggong of Johore from the Kallang river to Pulai River when the island was ceded to Britain. They formerly consisted of 100 families, but in 1847 the small pox had reduced them to eight. They were said to have lived exclusively in boats, neither building huts nor cultivating any plants. Their language at that time appears to have been Malay, and neither Mr. Logan nor Mr. Thomson who described the Orang Selitar were able to elicit any words of their original language. Of these races it is not easy now to find any traces, as they have become amalgamated with the Malays, adopting not only their language but also their customs and religion. Lately however the authors of this note visited Kampong Roko, on the Kalang river, and made an attempt to collect what information was procurable concerning this interesting people. They were accompanied by Mr. R. H. Yapp (of the Cambridge expedition) who took photographs of some of the older men who were stated to be of this race. Kampong Roko itself is a Malay village of the ordinary type, built on a mud bank of the Kalang river and containing a very mixed population. The natives have for many years employed themselves in fishing and in preparing Nipah leaves for cigarettes-wrappers, so that the ground is covered for a considerable depth with a dense mass of waste fragments of leaves. We visited the village on Nov. 12th, and sought out the oldest inhabitants, the Batin Jenang, and an old man named Rabu, together with one or two others, and spent a long time with them in endeavours to\nobtain information as to the language, traditions, etc., of the Kalangs, but they seemed to have forgotten most of the language, and but little information could be obtained, though what was obtained was of considerable interest. They affirmed that they were Orang Daik (Malay) from Lingga, and stated that there were at least eight tribes who used to visit this district, and were mostly pirates. They were the\n\nOrang Tambus          Orang Sekanak\nOrang Mantang         Orang Barok\nOrang Galang          Orang Moro\nOrang Pusek (or Persik) Orang Sugi\n\nThe first two always lived in boats, having no fixed habitations, and were not piratical. The rest were all bad pirates, who lived on various islands and travelled as far as Siam and Cochin China on piratical expeditions. In the time of Sultan Mahmud, Raja Lang was the chief of the Galangs, and Orang Kaya Mepar (Che Muntel) was chief of the Baroks, and his grandson is now head. They have a village at Singkep, or as one of the men said, on Lingga. The Persiks now live at Pulau Persik between Retik and Daik. They had a Batin as chief, but no Jenang. The Orang Tambus now live in a village in Silat Durian, among the Riau islands. They had a Batin only. The Orang Mantang lived on Pulau Mantang and were very numerous. They had a Batin. The Orang Galang lived mostly in Pulau Karas, in the Riau Archipelago, and had a Batin only. The Orang Sekanak lived on an island between Pulau Retik and Pulau Daik. The Orang Sugi live near Sulit, in Riau, and had a Batin. The Orang Moro lived in Pulau Moro, near Pulau Sugi; but they were also said to belong to the Orang Daik. It should be noted that among the Sakai tribes of the Peninsula, the Batin is usually if not invariably considered as the superior of the Jenang. Here however at Kampong Roko it was stated quite positively that the Jenang was the higher official.\n\nThe following non-Malay words were obtained from these men:\n\nKoyok, a dog. Used by all the above mentioned tribes.\nKiyan, come, come here (lit. thither) cf. Belandas tribe Chan.\nKiyan, go away (lit. hither) cf. Belandas Chun.\nKiyoh, far off.\n\nSika, come here, e.g., Sika makan come here and eat.\n\nThe following words are probably all of Malay origin:\n\nJengkeng or bidah, a boat (sampan or koleh).\n\nLanchang, a sailing vessel.\n\nO-neh or O-ne, friend or comrade, used in addressing other members of the tribe whether young or old, e.g., O-neh Nan Kamana? Where are you going, friend? The O in Oneh may be merely interjectional.\n\nDiko = engkau, also used in addressing other tribesmen, but less polite or less friendly than O-ne.\n\nPohon was used instead of Poko, tree, as on the East Coast and elsewhere.\n\nThe pronunciation was said to be peculiar, thus: s was pronounced like a soft z, e.g., Nazi for Nasi; r like h, e.g., Parang for Pahang; k like kh, e.g., Khain for Kain; Khakhi for Kaki.\n\nToo much stress however must not be laid upon these examples of pronunciation, as although what was heard is faithfully recorded, the personal equation enters too largely into this sort of questions for them to be accepted without repeated checkings. A Sakai, for instance, will occasionally pronounce one and the same word in two distinct ways, probably through nervousness at being questioned by an European.\n\nSlight as these traces are, if taken in conjunction with the important fact that the constitution of these tribes corresponds fairly closely to that of Sakais (as is shown by the Sakai names of the chiefs) they appear to suggest the theory that the Sea-gypsies of Singapore owe their origin largely from Sakai hill-tribes in the Riau-Lingga Archipelago; that these, whether through pressure of the Malay immigration or from other causes, took to the sea, and reinforced probably by more than a sprinkling of mere Malay adventurers, developed into the famous piratical race which under the generic name of Orang Laut became for a space the terror of all who sailed these Eastern seas. Such an evolution of one of the mildest mannered and most timid races of the earth would certainly appear unaccountable, but if it is to be rejected, it involves us in still greater difficulties. The evidences may be briefly enumerated as follows.\n\n(1.) The constitution of the tribe under Jinang and Batin.\n(2). The use of undoubted Sakai words; of these Koyok, Kiyau, and Kiyun are all words allied to those used by the Belandas tribe in Selangor.\n\n(3.) The Sakai \"terumba\" or racial records as preserved by the Besisi tribe in the Kwala Langat district (Selangor), which explicitly state that the ancestors of the original tribe descended to the sea and became sea-folk (turun kalaut jadi raiat laut) and that the sea-folk became pirates (Raiat laut jadi Bajau).\n\nFurther investigations when opportunities occur may supply more extensive information as to these wild tribes, now so nearly vanished. The foregoing notes, incomplete as they are, show that there are still some records worth the attention of any who have the chance of studying the race, and research in the district of Selitar and Pandan, where the tribe, as late as 1847, were in a very primitive state of civilisation, and in the Carimons, and neighbouring islands, may throw more light on the history and relationship of the Orang Laut.\n\nW. W. Skeat.\nH. N. Ridley.\nCases of Lightning Discharge.\n\nBy G. E. V. Thomas, A.M.I.C.E.\n\nCommunicated by H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe study of lightning phenomena is of great interest and importance, and as the conditions which obtain in Malaya are extremely favourable for the observation of such phenomena, as regards the frequency and violence of thunder storms, it is somewhat surprising to find that the accounts so far available are few. Those here given are of interest as being descriptive of unusual effects.\n\nIn well-marked cases of the destructive effect of lightning on trees, the tree struck is completely shattered. Such instances are familiar, probably because they are immediately apparent as the result of a severe storm; but the gradual decay and death of a number of trees in the vicinity of one struck, which would seem to be a frequent after-effect, is a form of damage which, as far as the writer can ascertain, has not previously been noted.\n\nThe following account, from the diary of Mr. H. N. Ridley, Director of Gardens and Forests, S. S., describes such an effect, which occurred in a coco-nut plantation in Singapore.\n\n\"May 3rd 1898. Visited Siglap and saw a place where, more than a month previously, a tree was struck by a tremendous flash. From this tree in a semicircle (there being none on the outer side) eleven more trees died. The deaths appeared to radiate out from struck tree gradually. Three were still standing; they bore young fruit and flowers, but the whole of the foliage looked as if burnt. One was still alive and putting up a fresh leaf. One, covered with fungi, had been dead some time. Why this progressive death? Inspector tells me he saw a similar case where, some time after the death of coco-nuts, some mango-steen trees withered away in like manner.\n\nA similar instance recently occurred in the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, and was brought to the writer's notice by the\nsame observer. In this case two trees (*Erythrina* and *Detarium*) appeared to have been struck simultaneously. Though the damage apparent was very slight and confined to the bark, decay began in the *Erythrina* within ten days. Another *Erythrina* adjoining died soon after, but the *Detarium* was unhurt. Another example occurred on Government Hill, when a sugar palm was struck (May 2nd, 1899). The writer saw the tree two hours afterwards and obtained the following account from a native eye-witness. \"About half past one there was a single peal of thunder, very near, but I saw no flash, only a general glare. Less than one minute afterwards smoke came from the tree and then flames, about half way up the trunk. The fire went up very quickly and I ordered the tree to be cut down.\" When the writer saw the tree, the fibrous material which covers these palms was still smouldering, but the closest examination failed to reveal any traces of damage other than that caused by fire, and the surrounding trees were quite unhurt. Three months afterwards, however, the similar palms in a radius of twelve or fifteen feet from that struck were completely dead.\n\nA remarkable point in this instance is that although the palm struck was over sixty feet in height, and surrounded by others even taller, the flash should have struck it in the middle. Mr. Ridley has noted a similar case in which an explosion took place in the fork of a Rambutan tree only six feet above the ground between the base of the fork and a birds-nest fern, and set fire to the roots of the fern. There was no damage done to this tree except from burns, but a chicken at its base was killed.\n\nThe first of the following accounts, furnished by Mr. A. Knight, is of particular interest, as the phenomena noted were of an unusual kind and did not occur during a storm. Mr. Knight writes:\u2014\"On the 12th September, 1898, I was driving home from town, and when in the lower part of River Valley Road I saw a flash in front, and there was a loud report which made my pony start forward. On reaching my house, Grassdale, I found that the ladies of my household had been much startled by the explosion. Two of them had been near the entrance, standing facing towards town, while two others were walking from the direction of town and were about a third of a mile from the house. To the former two a flame-coloured flash seemed to fall\nin front of them; to the latter two a bright light seemed to be thrown in their faces and the loud report was instantaneous. These two afterwards detected a sulphurous smell, and all felt a sensation like an electric shock. There had been some distant thunder and rain shortly after noon. It had afterwards been bright but stormy looking; and though clouds were gathering in the evening, there was at that time no thunder or lightning. Shortly afterwards there was heavy thunder near, followed by a copious shower. A. K.\"\n\nMr. Knight's second account also describes a form of discharge about which very little is known. It is unfortunate that no photograph was obtained, as it would seem from comments in a recent electrical journal that no photograph ever has been obtained of this phenomenon, and it has been customary to discredit statements as to its appearance. Mr. Knight's note differs from the more usual accounts, in which the ball of fire is said to run about before bursting, but is closely analogous to a case quoted by Dr. Oliver Lodge,* in which however the ball is described as of a reddish yellow colour, changing to vivid white. Mr. Knight's account is as follows:\u2014\"On the 14th October, 1898, there was a very severe thunder squall\u2014strong wind, violent rain and much thunder, not very distant. It came on suddenly, about 7 p.m., as we were going down to dinner; and as I was about to take my seat at the end of the table, facing the back of the house, I saw an explosion in the air, like that of a fireball or bomb, probably four or five feet above the ground, and there was a loud bang. The light appeared greenish white. There is no doubt that it was in the back garden, as it was located there by some neighbours whose line of sight was at right angles with mine.\"\n\nMr. Ridley reports also the two following cases of globular lightning, differing from that of Mr. Knight in that the phenomena occurred outside the storm. \"Some few years ago, I was sitting in my verandah, about 7 p.m.; it was quite dark, and there was a thunderstorm going on over the Economic Garden. Suddenly there was an intensely brilliant flash and instantaneous explosion close to the house. My back was towards the garden,\n\n* Lightning Conductors and Lightning Guards. Prof. O. J. Lodge.\nso that I only saw the reflection of the light. Mr. Feilding was at the time passing along the road below the hill on which my house stands, when he saw a ball of fire descend in a curve, slowly, about 50 yards from the house, close to the ground, between him and the house. It appeared to explode with a tremendous noise. Careful examination of the grass where the ball fell showed no trace of burning or other mark. Simultaneously with this phenomenon, a large tree (Irvinia) in the Economic Garden was struck by lightning, but hardly injured. This stroke was the last flash of the storm.\"\n\n(2) \"A thunderstorm was taking place over the Bukit Timah Road, beyond the Economic Garden, one Sunday about two years ago, at between one and two p.m. The sky was bright, but not cloudless, and the sun brilliant over my house, and I went out on the lawn to look at the distant storm to the North. I saw a zigzag flash apparently about three-quarters of a mile away, and, almost absolutely simultaneously, a peal of thunder came from behind me, and behind the house to the west. I saw nothing to account for this, but Mr. Robertson-Glasgow, who was sitting in a room facing west, saw a luminous body, not ball-shaped, though more or less rounded, moving in a downward curve to the South, till it disappeared behind some trees, and was followed by the thunder. It was less bright than the sunlight.\"\n\nThe only local cases of damage to buildings reported are those at the Cape Rachado and Muka Head Lighthouses. The writer was fortunately able to inspect the former not long after the occurrence, and found it to be an interesting example of side flash, a discharge having left the very fine \"Lightning Rod Conference\" copper conductor at a bend and made sundry holes in solid masonry walls, traversing two rooms and finally being dissipated over the sheet of rain water collected in a courtyard. The Lightkeeper's report shows that in this case the \"expenditure of observers\" deprecated by Dr. Lodge, nearly occurred, as the matting under two low wooden beds, on which some of the lighthouse attendants were lying at the time, was torn to pieces. The report concludes:\u2014\"In that time Serang, Tindal and two Lascars is inside the room grate of the Almighty pity there had not been anything happen.\"\nThe Muka Head case (October 9th, 1897,) affords another example of the inefficacy of the old-fashioned single conductor, which was supposed to protect a building of any size if only it were high enough, and had nicely sharpened points and an earth resistance measuring a fraction of an ohm. From the interesting report by Mr. Wills,* the Lighthouse keeper, it would seem that a flash struck the conductor, leaving evidence by tearing off a gunmetal brace about half way up. The discharge then left the heavy copper rod and proceeded to earth by a thin telephone earth wire, thirty feet of which was completely deflagrated. From some further reports collected by the writer, it would seem that Penang Hill would form an excellent site for observation, as the disturbances noted by the Signal Sergeant stationed there are exceptionally freakful and violent. He states that in April, 1898, a telegraph pole was cut in half horizontally as if it were sawed off.\u201d The telegraph wire was also cut in three or four places and three insulators broken. On another occasion, a discharge passed through a large earthenware jar, making one hole of several inches in diameter, and a second of less than one inch, and finally excavating part of the floor near the jar.\n\nAn attempt to explain the conditions which serve to bring about results like these is not within the scope of the present notes, but the writer may, perhaps, be permitted to invite further lightning notes, accompanied where possible by photographs. Such records are of the greatest possible assistance in promoting the general knowledge of a series of phenomena about which there is still much to be discovered.\n\nG. E. V.

Penrissen, Sarawak, I found in sand beneath some overhanging cliffs numerous small pit-falls exactly like those made by the ant-lion; some of these when examined were found to contain a curious worm-like larva which has since proved to belong to a fly of the genus Vermileo, family Leptidae. The body consists of 11 segments, into the first of which the head can be completely retracted, five annuli can plainly be distinguished on segments 2, 3, and 4, but are less well marked on the others; the 10th consists only of three. The middle annulus of the fourth segment bears on the ventral surface a fleshy knob (abdominal pseudopod) which is surmounted by a small semicircular chitinous comb longitudinally placed; the eighth segment ventrally bears a median tuft of setae, and a fringe of similar setae marks the posterior border of the 9th segment, this also carries on its ventral surface 2 median setigerous papillae. The 10th segment, which is set at somewhat of an angle to the 9th, bears on the dorsal surface at its anterior border a fringe of very strong setae directed backwards. The 11th and last segment terminates in four finger-like processes clothed with delicate hairs, the anus opens on its ventral, two stigmata on its dorsal surface. The last three segments are markedly larger than any of the preceding ones. The larva burrows into the sand head first, until completely buried, and then proceeds to form its pit-fall in the following manner: the more deeply buried tail-end acting as a fixed point, the anterior half of the body is curved about in all directions, each curving motion being followed by a rapid straightening out, which jerks the sand away for some little distance; since the tail is fixed, the result of many of these motions is to produce a circular repression with sloping sides; at the bottom of this lies the larva, ventral surface uppermost, the posterior half of the body still buried, the anterior half exposed and straightened out. If now an ant is introduced into the pit-fall, the exposed part of the larva suddenly curls up in a spiral coil, the prey being generally included\nin the coil and impaled by pressure on the chitinous comb of the 4th segment; a hold is then gained with the mouth, and after a few minutes, with a rapid sinuous motion, the larva straightens out and disappears below the sand, carrying its prey with it. If the larva is not successful in catching its prey the first time, it flings sand about in all directions by rapid switching movements, and the victim, unable to obtain a foothold on the sliding sides of the pit-fall, falls down to the bottom; or occasionally the larva actually strikes like a snake at the victim as it endeavours to escape from the toils, indeed many of the actions of this larva are quite snake-like, and an ant enclosed in one of its coils reminds one of nothing so much as of a small mammal in the grasp of a python. Occasionally the prey seems somewhat out of proportion to the larva, but by means of the numerous setae on the large posterior segments a very firm grip is obtained in the sand, and I have never yet seen an insect of moderate size make good his escape after having been once seized. I brought down to Kuching alive several of these larvae, and one or two pupated; shortly before pupation, the larva leaves its pit-fall and lies close to the surface of the sand, though completely covered; the anterior segments become much swollen and retracted, until the integument bursts, revealing beneath the brownish pupa; by some convulsive movements the whole pupa now appears at the surface, the larval skin being slowly shuffled off backwards, but never becoming entirely freed, so that the posterior end of the pupa always presents a somewhat ragged appearance. Unfortunately the heat of Kuching proved too much for these pupae, and none came to maturity, but shrivelled up; some Leptid flies which I obtained on Penrissen are, however, I am sure, the adult stage.\n\nOn a Male Specimen of Purlisa Giganteus Dist.\n\nA specimen of this handsome Lycaenid butterfly was described and figured by Distant in his Rhopalocera Malayana (p. 250. Tab. XXI. fig. 28. 1885), but the sex was not stated either in this or in two previous descriptions (Distant, Ent. Month. Mag. Vol. XVII. p. 245, 1881, and Waterhouse, Aid. Vol. I. pl. XLVI, 1882), and de Nic\u00e9ville in his \"Butterflies of India,\" Vol. iii. p.\n385, writes:\u2014\"I have not seen this species. The sex of the specimens described is not stated, and it would be hazardous even to guess from the figures and descriptions what sex they may be.\"\n\nWith the capture of an undoubted male specimen on Mt. Matang, Sarawak, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, in March of last year, I am enabled to state with absolute certainty that Distant described a female, and as the male sex has never been described I now append a short account of it.\n\nUpperside; forewing as in the female, hind-wing with the dark fuscous area much smaller, commencing as a narrow band at the external angle it rapidly narrows to a thin marginal line; costal area grey; underside rather paler than in the female. The inner margin of the hind-wing just interior to the submedian nervure is shortly folded opposite the abdomen, the fold containing numerous long scent-hairs. This sexual character though common enough in the Nymphalidae and Papilionidae, is only met with, amongst the Oriental Lycaenidae, in the genus Simiskina. The neuration of both sexes is identical. Mr. H. H. Druce has already recorded this species from Borneo in a paper on the Lycaenidae of the island (P. Z. S., 1895, p. 602), but his specimen was a female.\n\nON THE FEMALE OF Dodona Elvira Staud.\n\nThe male of Dodona Elvira was described by Staudinger in \"Iris,\" Vol. IX. p. 239, pl. V, fig. 6, (1896), together with many other new Bornean species. Females of this species are extremely rare, for though I have caught over one hundred males, I have only been able to secure one female; as that sex has never been described, I do so willingly here:\u2014Larger than male. Upperside ochreous; forewing with base broadly shaded with fuscous, a black spot or costal margin continuous with a fuscous discal fascia, a short line of the same colour, closing the cell and almost fused with the discal fascia. Another black spot on the costal margin, continuous with a very pale fuscous fascia, apex and external margin broadly bordered with black. The border containing some obsolescent, ochreous, submarginal spots. Hindwing as in the male. Underside ground-colour more rufous\nThe fascias are white, tinged with ochreous, instead of silvery, and fascia No. 4 on the forewing is very broad, fusing with the white litura which in the male occurs at the base of the second median interspace. Expanse 48 mm. Matang, 3,000 feet. June 1897.\n\nOn the System of Cataloguing Adopted in the Sarawak Museum\n\nIn the year 1874 an American, Mr. Melvill Dewey, invented and published a system for classifying and cataloguing scientific and other literature by means of employing decimal numbers, this system is known as the Dewey Decimal System. Curiously enough it has received but a small amount of attention in England and her dependencies, a most astonishing fact when one compares its perfect method and simplicity with the systems now in vogue in the majority of large home and colonial libraries. Mr. Dewey is in short the Bertillon of scientific cataloguing, less fortunate than his distinguished prototype, inasmuch as he has still to receive a wide-spread recognition.\n\nThe system consists of dividing the subjects, on which literature has been produced, into groups; to each group a number is assigned: each group is subdivided and each subdivision is characterised by a decimal number, following the group number. Thus, under such a number as 600 would be found all works dealing with Geography; a subdivision of this, Europe, would have the number 600.1; Asia, 600.2, etc. The countries making up these main divisions would again have a number\u2014England 600.11, Scotland 600.12, Ireland 600.13, etc., etc., whilst still greater subdivision can be provided for by the addition of another decimal, thus:\u2014Bedfordshire 600.11.1. Naturally enough countless modifications of this system have been suggested and tried.\n\nOn contemplating the somewhat chaotic system, or rather, lack of system, employed in cataloguing the zoological specimens in the Sarawak Museum, it seemed to me advisable to re-catalogue the collections by means of a modification of the Dewey Decimal System. Each class of animals was marked with a letter:\u2014Mammals, A. Birds, B. Reptiles, C. Amphibia, D. Fishes, E. Each family of these classes was numbered in order\n1, 2, 3, etc., each genus with a decimal number following the family number, each species with another decimal number following that of the genus. Let me illustrate this with an example taken from the catalogue of Fishes.\n\nClass Pisces = E\nOrder 1. Plagiostomata\nSub-order. Selachoiidei\nFam. Carchariidae = E 1\nGenus Carcharias = E 1.1\nSpecies laticaudus = E 1.1.1\nwith specimens a. b. c. d.\nSpecies acutus = E 1.1.2.\nwith specimens a. b. c. d., etc.\nFam. Lamnid\u00e6 = E 2\nGenus Lamna = E 2.1.\nand so on.\n\nBy this means all necessity of check lists, registers and double entries is obviated; a glance at the catalogue reveals the number of specimens of any given species in the collection, the number of duplicates (if any), the desiderata, the number of species in a genus, of genera in a family, whilst the labels of the individual specimens with numbers corresponding to the catalogue numbers are equally eloquent.\n\nIn cataloguing zoological or botanical specimens by this decimal system, one meets with a difficulty which does not occur in cataloguing literature, since literature can be grouped under subject-headings which always remain constant, such as Geography, Geology, Meteorology, etc.; but every biologist knows that new species, new genera, even new families are constantly being created by the systematist, either from newly discovered forms or by the splitting up of old assemblages (for example the Eastern members of the genus Sciurus have been recently divided by Mr. Oldfield Thomas into five genera), all of which necessitates the interpolation of new catalogue numbers into the pre-existing series, and I must confess that, as yet, I have been unable to evolve a perfectly satisfactory means of coping with this difficulty. New species may generally be readily disposed of by being added on to those already catalogued, but new genera cannot be so treated, since, by so doing, they may be separated\nfrom their nearest allies; and the same holds good when treating with new families. It is, of course, necessary when writing the catalogue, to enter and number in order every species, genus and family already recorded from the area in which the collections are made, whether or no the collection undergoing cataloguing contains all those species and genera; if this is done, a double advantage is secured\u2014the dreaded interpolation is only needed when new species or genera are discovered, and the catalogue becomes a complete faunistic list of the collected-over area, and the importance of such faunistic list is well-recognised by every museum curator. My own method of interpolating new genera into a previously catalogued series has been as follows:\u2014The new genus is numbered with a fractional number, the numerator of such a fraction being the number of the nearest ally of the new genus. The denominator the last two figures of the year in which the new genus was described. For example, let us imagine that a new genus closely allied to *Hestia* was discovered this year. The number of genus *Hestia* in the Sarawak Museum catalogue of Lepidoptera is He 1.1. The new genus would consequently be numbered He $\\frac{1}{9}$: the number is cumbersome and somewhat destroys the symmetry of the series, but it is significant, and that feature I have endeavoured to hold constantly in view during my re-cataloguing labours.\n\nR. H. Shelford.\nThe Hot Springs of Ulu Jelai.\n\nBY A. D. MACHADO.\n\nHaving recently occasion to visit the extreme Ulu of the Jelai district, Pahang, in connection with certain prospecting operations which I was then undertaking for the Malayan (Pahang) Exploration Co., I heard from Sakai aborigines of the existence of hot springs in this neighbourhood. These springs I found to be situated on one of the spurs of the main range of hills dividing Pahang from Perak, about Latitude $4^\\circ 20'$ N., and Longitude $101^\\circ 30'$ E. Our Sakai guide, who visited this spot ten or more years ago, described the phenomenon as one eruptive fountain of hot water and steam\u2014the water, according to him, ascending to a considerable height, a true Geyser in fact. I saw quite a different thing. I found seven non-eruptive springs of hot water and steam, the former flowing over sloping terraces or basins of granitic boulders, till finally they joined on to a stream called the Cha-ang, which in turn drained into the Jelai. If the statement of the Sakai is credible, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, there has evidently been a change in the structure of these springs, within the short space of ten years, a very short geological epoch indeed. The usual characteristic sulphurous odour pervaded this place; those curiously fretted rims of the boulders over which the water flowed, due doubtless to the deposition of Silica, sulphur, etc., are also noticeable here. Wild animals, elephants, rhinoceri, deer, etc., visit this spot periodically, judging by their old and fresh tracks, probably for their saline properties, while the Sakais hold this place in great awe and veneration. They seemed quite unable to account for this phenomenon, all the explanation they could give being that they thought it was the work of \"hantus.\" These springs are, in their geological formation, similar to those visited by me in Maliwun, Lower Burma, in Renong, Siamese Malaya, and in other parts of the Malay Peninsula; though, in point of size and importance,\nthey approximate those of Ojigoku in the Hakone district of Japan.\n\nI feel here tempted to say a word in regard to this little-known district of Ulu Jelai. Doubtless for services rendered, the whole of this district has been assigned, or rather alienated by the Pahang Government to the Datoh Maharaja Puba of Jelai, otherwise and better known as the Toh Raja Jelai, who alone has the right to exploit it. With the exception of a dozen Malays, dependents of Toh Raja, who live at a place called Kwala Betok, the furthest Malay outpost up the Jelai, this district is inhabited exclusively by Sakais. These Sakais plant hill paddy for the Toh Raja and tapioca root for themselves, and do in consequence much unnecessary destruction to valuable timber forests. The ten or a dozen Malays at Kwala Betok have established a kind of an octroi or tithes station, where they exact from the Sakai their pound of flesh for the privilege of cultivating Toh Raja\u2019s land, though, to do the Sakais justice, they try by all kinds of subterfuge to evade the payment of these dues\u2014a case of \u201cdiamond cut diamond.\u201d These Malays will tell you that the Sakais are cunning, unreliable and great cheats; while the Sakais, on the other hand, will tell you that the Malays are hard task-masters, are cruel and merciless\u2014a case again of the \u201cpot calling the kettle black.\u201d Taken all in all, this district is fairly rich in economic and mineral products. Rattans are plentiful, and so is Kayu Gaharu (*Aquilaria Malaccensis*) in a lesser degree, while Gutta of almost every description abounds, Gutta Rambong (*Ficus Elastica*) growing wild in places. Of minerals, gold is known to exist; indeed, I have only just located two lodes, which I have my reasons to hope may eventually pay to work. On the Betok, a stream which takes its rise in Ulu Lipis, and which drains into the Jelai at the aforesaid Kwala Betok, having an equal volume of water with the latter stream, tin ore is extremely plentiful and easy to work; so much so, that there is reason to believe that before long a very thriving mining centre will spring up in this corner of the Jelai. The Jelai River, in its upper reaches, abounds in gorges and rapids, formidable obstructions to navigation, thus nullifying its utility as a highway. To those who are venturesome, a descent in bamboo rafts affords exciting experiences.\nPUBLICATIONS OF THE SOCIETY.\n\nJournal No. 1 to No. 33, Price One Dollar each.\n\nEssays Relating to Indo-China, 4 Vols, Price $1 each.\n\nThe Hikayat Abdullah.\n\nThe Wai-seng Lottery, by G.

In other cases, on the contrary, the inscriptions are either entirely illegible, or can only be deciphered with difficulty. I therefore seized the opportunity afforded by a temporary residence in Malacca to make copies of all the inscriptions which are still legible, with a view to placing them on record in the journal of the Society, before time and the action of the weather have wrought any further havoc among them.\n\nCuriously enough, while I was engaged in this work, the Acting Col. Chaplain (Mr. J. Hardy) discovered among the old Dutch records a list of the inscriptions on the tomb-stones made in 1713 by one Michiel de Bruyn, the Sexton, which was of considerable use to me in deciphering some of the more illegible inscriptions. The list is not complete, however, as the worthy Sexton left the Portuguese inscriptions and some of the Dutch ones, which are difficult to decipher, severely alone. A translation of the document is annexed (C).\n\nI have drawn up a list of the inscriptions in brief (A), giving the names and the dates of birth and death, and I also give the inscriptions in full (B), with a translation of each in parallel columns. I further had a plan of the church made, showing the positions of the different stones, which are marked with numbers corresponding to those in the list of inscriptions.\nAnother Dutch document found in Malacca, of which I give a translation (D), shows that at one time there were a good many coats of arms hanging on the walls of the church, but these have all disappeared.\n\nA few stones, which were lying about loose, were removed several years ago by Mr. D. F. A. Hervey, late Resident Councillor Malacca, to the present Protestant Church (Christ Church) at Malacca, where they still remain. The inscriptions on these are, however, almost entirely illegible.\n\nIn concluding these few remarks, I desire to acknowledge the great assistance rendered to me by the late Mr. P. Nuy, Librarian of the Malacca Library, and formerly a member of this Society, in deciphering the inscriptions on the tomb-stones. The two Portuguese inscriptions (Nos. 1 and 24) were deciphered and translated by Mr. H. L Noronha.\n\nE. M.

(Kedah Peak.)\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe great isolated mountain commonly known as Kedah Peak, which forms so conspicuous an object in the view from Penang, has been several times ascended by Europeans, but as far as I am aware no account of it has been published. The following description of its ascent may therefore be useful to those who intend to scale it.\n\nI left Penang on June 4th, 1893, in the \"Rosebud\" launch, accompanied by Mr. Curtis, intending to make the ascent from the village of Yan, which lies at the foot of the mountain and is the best starting point, though there is another route from the Merbau river. The weather was very bad and when we had arrived opposite Yan, a heavy squall came up and we had to fly for shelter to Pulau Song-song, where the water was deep and quiet. With some difficulty, owing to the strong headwind and dense rain which completely hid the view, we managed to get under lee of the island, and shortly after the rain abated we determined as it was rather late to spend the night at Pulau Song-song, especially as the surf was breaking heavily on the coast and would make it difficult for us to land the baggage from the boats. We therefore landed on the island and took up our quarters in a native hut. The village is small and the inhabitants gain their living by catching and curing fish and by collecting turtle eggs. The island is rocky, the prevailing rock being clay ironstone with ferruginous sands and clays. It is thickly wooded with fairly large trees, among which were Swintonia spicifera and Anisoptera Curtisi, both in fruit. The former appeared very abundant and was very conspicuous on account of its masses of red-winged fruits, but the trees were too tall for us to secure good specimens. Strolling along the shore we\ncollected a few interesting plants, among which were *Atalantia monophylla*, forming a bushy tree loaded with its small green oranges, *Cordia Sebestena*, the iron wood tree of Cocos island, with its showy orange flowers, a pretty *Hoya* with white sweet-scented blossoms, and creeping over the sandy banks a pretty *Ruellia* with fairly large violet flowers, *R. prostrata*, not previously recorded from the Malay Peninsula nor have I ever met with it since. Orchids were not wanting on the trees by the beach. *Aerides odoratum* seemed common and was in bud, and some fine plants were secured. It seems to have a liking for the sea shore as I have several times found it abundantly on the smaller islets in the Straits in similar localities. *Eria bractescens*, *Cirrhophetalum Medusae*, the common *Cymbidium* (*C. aloifolium*) and the pigeon orchid *Dendrobium crumenatum* were also found but were not in flower. The maiden hair fern, *Adiantum Capillus-veneris*, also grew on the rocks by the sea.\n\nDuring the night a large turtle landed on the beach near the village and laid about forty eggs in the sand which were easily found next morning by the villagers, as the animal had left a large wide track like that made by pushing down a boat through the sand from its nest to the sea.\n\nNext morning being quite fine we hastened across the Yan. The sea on this coast is very shallow and even small steam launches have to anchor a mile away at least. The mouth of the river is exactly opposite Pulau Song-song. A plantation of coconut palms runs along the coast south of the river, terminating near its mouth, and thus forms a good landmark. The river being tidal is fringed with the common tidal swamp vegetation, the commonest tree being *Avicennia*. The wild date palm, *Phoenix paludosa* is abundant, *Pluchea indica*, *Wedelia biflora* and the common *Acanthus* (*A. ebracteatus* Vahl) are also conspicuous. This latter plant has a great reputation in Penang as a medicine for boils. The seeds are roasted, pulverised and mixed with water, and the liquid drunk. The natives state that the patient will be freed from boils for as many years as there are pounded seeds in the draught. This *acanthus* known here as Jeruju, has the flowers light blue or white, usually the latter in the south of the peninsula and blue in the north and Java, but blue flowers occur in some parts of Singapore. The large and brilliant-\nflowered *A. ilicifolius*, I have only met with in the Lankawi islands; the prickly holly-like foliage is similar, but the flowers are more than twice as large, and of a beautiful blue.\n\nThe village of Yan is not visible from the sea-shore but is situated a few hundred yards from the mouth of the river, which at high water is deep enough to float good-sized tongkangs. There is another route to it through a swampy piece of ground behind the coconut plantation south of the river mouth. This swamp had apparently been under paddy cultivation but at this time was covered with a dense bed of sedges chiefly *Scirpus grossus* which is used in mat making. Among it grew the charming water balsam *Hydrocera triflora*.\n\nThe village is of fair size and there are a good many Chinese settled there who make a living by cutting timber on the slopes of the mountain and by making charcoal. Durians, Mangosteens, Rambai, Bachang and other fruit trees are largely cultivated. The Durian trees were of remarkably large size, and all day but especially in the evening and early morning one could hear the crash of the falling fruit. Squirrels seemed to be doing much damage to them and the village children were provided with pellet-bows made of bamboo and rattan, from which they discharged stones at the little animals. So famous are the Durian trees of Yan that the natives gave a half humorous derivation of the word Durian, from Deri Yan.\n\nThere were many pepper gardens in the neighbourhood and I also saw coffee, patchouli and tobacco cultivated there, but the latter seemed for the most part to be abandoned. Indigo I was told had been tried but apparently without success.\n\nAs in other native states under Siamese influence, such as Kelantan, the women are less confined to the house than in the Southern States and go about more in the villages. There was a good deal of sickness apparently and as the natives had no European medicines and knew nothing about indigenous drugs, there was an extensive levee of applicants for medical treatment every morning. Badly neglected wounds on the feet and legs from falling durians seemed to be the chief ailments.\n\nThe Penghulu Rajah, who had been forewarned of my arrival from Penang, very considerately put an empty house\u2014the best in the village\u2014at my disposal, assisted me to procure coolies and\nsent an armed guard to watch over the house at night while I was there, as well as a patrol who rambled about at night armed with spears and lanterns. The use of the stocks for malefactors was not abolished here, and in one house we saw a native fixed in them by one leg.\n\nThe natives recommended that I should start early in the morning for the Peak, as it rained frequently in the afternoon, so it was determined to remain in Yan for the rest of the day. Mr. Curtis returned to Penang and I occupied the time in collecting in the nearest patch of jungle, where were a number of trees hardly or not at all known to me. Among them a large Magnolia (Talauma sp.) with very large white fruit with pink seeds, Strophanthus Jackianus with its long-tailed orange flowers, a pretty Elettariopsis (E. latiflora) with white, crimson and yellow flowers, and the shrubby Bauhinia mollissima with red flowers, one petal of which is white and yellow, especially claimed attention. Specimens of a small tree called here Nasi Sejuk (cold rice) were brought me by the men. The branches bore a handsome fruit as large and of the same colour as a good orange. It contained several large seeds wrapped in a sweet well-flavoured pulp. The tree proved to be Salacia flavescens.\n\nI secured a specimen of a small prettily marked snake with remarkably large eyes and later in the day a large black and white Typhlops was brought me. These were all the reptiles I saw except the common green tree snake Tragops porcinus and a very large tortoise which I perceived creeping along the bottom of the river in the early morning as I went down to bathe. It burrowed under the bank and I could not get it out. There were said to be no crocodiles in the river.\n\nAbout three miles from Yan is a fine waterfall which is well worth a visit. The route to it follows the telegraph line towards Kedah. The fall is visible for a considerable distance out at sea. After remaining a day at Yan, I started with the coolies to ascend the mountain. Passing through a little open country interspersed with woods, one reaches the dense jungle which covers the mountain-side. A guide is necessary for at least the first part of the way, as there are many tracks made by charcoal-burners and timber-cutters, which are likely to lead the explorer astray. The lower woods would well repay a thorough botanical investi-\ngation, as there seemed to be very many plants of interest, but time did not permit of a careful search. The path was strewn with fruits and seeds of various kinds fallen from the trees. At one place were innumerable fruits of the yellow flowered *Wormia meliosmaefolia*, at another those of the Minyak Kruen, *Dipterocarpus pterygocalyx*. *Melanorrhea Curtisii*, one of the trees known as Rengas, was loaded with its red-winged fruit and formed a conspicuous object. The timber of this tree was in request by the woodmen, and felled trunks could be seen lying in the wood. The heart wood is hard and dark red, and as there is much soft white sap wood, the felled logs are left on the ground till the termites have eaten off the sap wood, when the heart wood untouched by them is dragged to the foot of the hills on buffalo sleds. *Vitex coriacea*, a small tree, was bright with its innumerable violet flowers which attracted hosts of butterflies. Leeches are rather troublesome in this part of the wood but disappeared in the higher parts of the hill. The track is an easy gradient but long and toilsome and was decided by my boy and the plant collector to be worse than that up Mount Ophir. At one spot a fine view towards the northwest is to be obtained, but otherwise the path is entirely closed in by jungle. At about 2000 feet altitude the flora suddenly changes. The trees are smaller and more slender and the ground in the more rocky spots is covered with orchids and ferns. The path traversed a thick scrub of the curious fern *Oleandra neriiformis* as high as one's head. Here and there were open grassy spots on which grew many pink-flowered Sonerilas, white Hedyotis and yellow Xyris, the latter being a new species described as *Xyris Ridleyi*.\n\nThe turf was ploughed up at one of these grassy patches by rhinoceros, but the animals were not seen. The camping ground lies in the highest of these spots between two peaks of the range, the highest of which lying towards the south is a thousand feet above it, and is the summit of Gunong Jerai. There is a good stream of water and plenty of firewood here. The rocks consist of quartzite, sandstones, and micaceous schists and piles of stones were pointed out as relics of tin mining operations abandoned some few years previously. A little way below the camp was an outcrop of iron ore (haematite). Close to the hut were evident very recent traces of a large tiger,\nbut nothing was heard or seen of the beast. Kijang were said to be common here, but none put in an appearance. On one occasion I heard in the evening the cry of a Lotong (*Semnopithecus*) but no other animals were seen or heard except one or two small bats. Birds too were very scarce and mostly small species, as at Mount Ophir. Three fine hawks passed over the camp one afternoon, but kept well out of range. Butterflies and beetles were numerous and among the latter I secured a specimen of *Odontolabris gazella* a well known Ophir insect. One of the men caught also a death's head moth, but it escaped his grasp. The flora round the camp bore some resemblance to that of Mount Ophir, many of the trees being of the same kinds; such were the Conifers, *Dammara orientalis*, *Dacrydium elatum* and *Podocarpus cupressinus*; as also *Tristania merquensis*, *Boeckia frutescens* and *Leptospermum amboinense*. The wild Aniseed, *Ilicium Cambodianum*, with rosy or white flowers and star like capsules, resembling those of the true Star anise of Cochin China but quite odorless, was plentiful in the woods, but the most striking shrub was a beautiful white *Rhododendron* about twelve feet tall which bore bunches of large white flowers with a yellow centre. A plant well worthy of cultivation, but unfortunately neither seeds nor young plants could be obtained.\n\nAmong the smaller plants a charming little sonerila with mauve rarely white flowers, and leaves of every shade of green olive and purple frequently spotted or marbled with white was very abundant. Botanically it was especially interesting from its possessing a tuberous root. *Burmannia disticha* was unusually abundant and fine, both in size and color. One plant was gathered with twenty-six flowers in a head, and growing in masses as it does here its beautiful blue flowers reminded one of the blue hyacinths of the English woods. Another pretty blue flowered plant was a tall grassy leaved *Aneilema (A. giganteum Br.)* which opened its azure flowers only at noon. It was hitherto unknown from the peninsula, though of very wide distribution, occurring in Africa, India, Ceylon, the Malay islands, China and Australia. A curious little sedge, *Scleria Neesii var borneensis*, was another important addition to our flora, as its distribution is confined to Ceylon and Borneo. Twining in the grasses close to the stream in damp spots was a pretty *Utricularia* with large\nyellow flowers. It was described under the name of *U. involvens*, Ridl.\n\nThe ascent to the summit of the mountain is steep in parts but there is a good track through the woods which clothe it to the top. The view from the point is very fine and embraces an extensive tract of country, while on the sea side the Lankawi islands can plainly be seen. The height is estimated at a little over 4000 feet; by my aneroid I calculated it to be a little under, viz., 3495 feet. The southern side is quite precipitous with nearly vertical walls of many hundred feet; at one spot not far from the camp a stream runs over one of these precipices so steep that standing on the edge one cannot see the fall of the stream without bending over. Part of the rocky slopes on this side is coated with turf upon which I was about to step when one of the men restrained me and showed me that at a slight push the whole mass slid off from the smooth rock and went down the side of the precipice. On these rock-slopes grew a pretty *B\u0153a* (*B. elegans*) the only one I have met with which did not grow on limestone rocks, and with it was an *Arundina* with small flowers, not unlike the *Arundina Philippii* of our gardens. The biggest trees on the top were a species of *Pieris*, somewhat resembling an Arbutus with long racemes of white bell-shaped flowers. A new species of *Hedychium* (*H. collinum*) with white flowers was obtained, but only beginning to flower. A white-flowered *Canscora* was common near the top. It was quite distinct from the one which grows around the Kwala Lumpur Caves, and is the second species obtained in the peninsula, none being recorded in the Flora of British India.\n\nOrchids are far more numerous here than on Mount Ophir, and in places form an important portion of vegetation. In some spots the ground was so thickly covered by them that one was nearly up to the waist in them and had to cut one\u2019s way through the masses of tangled stems. Among the most striking were *Spathoglottis aurea*, *Cypripedium barbatum*, *Dendrobium sanguinolentum* and more commonly the pale ochre-colored form *cerinum D. Hughii*, with large thin white flowers tinted with violet, and *D. revolutum*. Bulbophyllums were very abundant, among them were *B. longiflorum* with large pink striped flowers with an orange lip, and *B. hispidum* only met with at the very summit,\nwith clusters of fairly large deep red hairy flowers with a very putrid odour. Upwards of fifty kinds of Orchids were collected here, of which eight kinds were peculiar to the range. As on Mount Ophir Didymocarpi were not common and what species did occur seemed to be endemic. Among the most conspicuous Ophir plants absent were Rhododendron Malayanum and R. jasmiflorum, Arundina speciosa Dendrobium uniflorum, Cladium Mangayi, Lepidosperma Chinense and Balanophora, but this latter being often rather deeply buried in the soil may not be discoverable unless in flower, and may perhaps be found later in the year. On the whole the flora most resembles that of Mount Ophir and is very different from that of the Main Perak hills. The flora of the Lankawi islands which one can see at no great distance from Kedah Peak and where so many remarkable plants have been found by Mr. Curtis is very distinct from that of any part of the peninsula, having in fact a closer relation with that of Tenasserim. I had expected to find on Kedah peak traces of this northern flora, but there was nothing of the kind, the plants are typically Malayan. I remained on the mountain for six days during which the weather was tolerably fine. Rain fell however almost every night. The temperature is fairly cool, the thermometer falling to 70 at sun down. Mosquitoes occur at the camp, which is unusual at this elevation, so those who are troubled by them would do well to take mosquito curtains. The expedition including going from and returning to Penang has, I believe, been done in a day, but it can hardly be worth the labour it entails to make so hurried a visit. The ascent from Yan takes from $3\\frac{1}{2}$ to 4 hours, and if wet it will probably take longer as the track becomes very slippery after rain.\nOn the Use of the Slow Loris in Malay Medicine.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nThe following instructions for the medical and magic uses of the Loris, were copied some time ago from a manuscript in Malay, and are excellent illustrations of Malay ideas as to medicine. In many respects these receipts recall European medical ideas of some four centuries ago. The notion that one drug will act beneficially in all diseases that flesh is heir to is by no means extinct among the more ignorant classes at the present day, while the use of animals, especially if of strange and uncanny appearance, simply because they were odd looking, was formerly quite common in Europe. Thus the viper, and the scinc (Mabusa) were valued highly as late as 1694. (Pomet's Drugs). Still earlier toads, bats and other such animals were used in magic as the Loris is among the Malays and Indians to this day.\n\nThe Kongkang, or Slow Loris (Nycticebus tardigradus) is common all over the peninsula and also occurs in India. Its strange appearance with its large eyes and ape-like hands, its nocturnal habits and its manner of covering its eyes with its hands, have stamped it in the eyes of all Orientals as an uncanny beast closely associated with demons, which it is supposed to have special facilities for seeing. I have been informed that its tears if applied to the eyes impart such clearness of vision that the person using it is able to see ghosts. The method of obtaining the tears is to take the animal among a herd of cows when it commences to weep, but another plan which indeed sounds more likely to succeed was to wrap the animal's body in a white cloth, and throw pepper in its eyes. The tears are collected on a bit of cotton.\n\nFive varieties of the Loris are recognised by the Malays, viz., the Kongkang ayer, the common grey forn, so called\nbecause it is said it can swim; Kongkang angin, which is black. This variety is said to have the power of vanishing when a storm arises, if it is merely tied with a string in a house, but if confined in a cage it cannot do. Kongkang api is red with a white mark on its forehead and nose. Kongkang orang is brownish with a red line over its head and down its back. The white variety Kongkang puteh or Kongkang Kayu is very rare and is the most valuable one for magic purposes. It derives its second name from the peculiar property of causing a tree to fall in any desired direction. To effect this it must be either found dead or killed in a special manner known only to an initiated few, its bones are then laid in a row in the direction in which it is desired that the tree shall fall when felled and the tree will fall exactly on the bones.\n\nIn cutting up a Kongkang for magical purposes it is necessary that the knife used shall be ornamented with gold. The skull if put in a hole in the ground beneath a house will cause ghosts (hantus) to appear. The fur if burnt and given to a woman to eat will cause her to like her husband however much she may have previously disliked him.\n\n**Pasal Pergunaan Kong Kang.**\n\nAyer mata-nya itu jika di pakai pada badan kita yani di masokkan k-dalam suatu bekas di-pakai sperti azimat, Insha Allah sklian yang mmendang kita kaseh sklian-nya.\n\n2.

If the tears of this animal be worn on the body, we can place them in a small case and carry as a sacred wand. All persons beholding our countenance shall by God\u2019s will bear an affectionate feeling towards us.\n\n2. Its blood may be mixed with ink, and written with as a sacred writing; by the will of God any business will prove successful; and it can be mixed with milk and rubbed on the mouth of a pot, when the rice which is to be cooked will never be done.\n3. Its gut is to be dried, and when we want to use it, take a piece and rub it on a stone with dew and civet; when rubbed below the floor of a house, the inmates will fall asleep and will not know we are getting in, and if rubbed on wild animals such as tigers, oxen or elephants, the person approaching will be safe from harm, and if ground up with a little bark of Dadup (Erythrina) and given to a sick person it will cure him at once.\n\n4. The gut when dried and ground with its gall together with rose water and rubbed on the abdomen of a woman in confinement, will assist to cause delivery.\n\n5. The right eye dried and ground to powder and mixed with human or goat's milk and some sweet oil may be used as an eye ointment which will make dim sight bright by the will of God.\n\n6. The left eye ground fine and mixed with rose water, honey and camphor (Sumatran) can be used as an eye ointment or eaten with sirih leaf, the nerves of which meet together causes all who look on us to love us, and if given to a wild beast it will become tame.\n\n7. The heart well dried and ground and mixed with olive oil and rubbed on acts as an aphrodisiac and buried in the front of a house makes it appear respectable.\n\n8. If its backbone is buried beneath the door of the house we can prevent thieves from entering.\n\n9. If the bone of its left leg be kept in the mouth during a conversation with a rajah, it will prevent his doing any acts of tyranny to us, and if we cook it with oil of snake or tiger or olive oil and rub it on the feet of a weak person, it will strengthen him.\n\n10. If its lung is placed beneath the door, the people of the house will be separated.\n\n11. If the liver be dried and a piece taken and rubbed up and given to a woman to eat it will produce in her feelings of love towards us.\nA Review of Dr. A. B. Meyer's \"Negritos.\"\n\nBy R. N. Bland.\n\nA pamphlet with the above title has recently been presented to the Library of the S. B. R. A. S. by the author. It is a translation from the German of two chapters of a larger work, published in 1893, dealing with the Negritos of the Philippines, and is confined to a consideration of the distribution of the Negritos within the Philippines and beyond.\n\nThe author, who is the Director of the Royal Zoological, Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum at Dresden, is a scientific traveller of established reputation. He has since 1875 published over 20 volumes on Anthropological and Ethnographical subjects connected with the far eastern Archipelago. The subject is one that possesses a particular interest in this \"corner of Asia,\" as amongst the natives of the Peninsula we have tribes representing the ancient race of Pigmy negroes, small black men with frizzy hair concerning whom science has speculated since the time of Herodotus.\n\nJakuns, Sakai, Semang, Orang Raiat, Orang Bukit, Orang Panggang, Belenda, Bidnanda are some of the names by which these people are known in different parts of the Peninsula. Possibly the Orang Laut, who to this day inhabit the villages at the mouth of the Rochor River, in the harbour of Singapore, and even the curly-headed \"have-a-dive\" boys of New Harbour are also related to this ancient people, but this is still an open question.\n\nThe author concerns himself only with the distribution of the Negritos in the Far East\u2014that is, where these people are to be met with and where not. In support of his arguments he quotes over 200 different authorities, and more often than not, differs from them.\nThe writers that our author quotes most, and differs from most violently, are MM. de Quatrefages and Hamy, both of them anthropologists of renown. To readers of this Journal, the criticisms of the views of M. de Quatrefages will be of interest, as some of these views are set forth in two articles entitled the \"Pigmies\" published in Nos. 11 and 13 of the Journal, S. B. R. A. S. Let us take some of these references in detail.\n\nP. 23. \"The most prolific writer on the Negritos is de Quatrefages, who published a monograph in the year 1872, entitled \"Etude sur les Mincopies et la race Negrito en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" . . . and then in 1882, together with Hamy, the 'Crania Ethnica.'\n\n\"I will not enter into a detailed discussion of this writer's partially fantastic ideas on the Negrito question. Time will decide whether the views advanced by him with great certainty will hold good, in that traces of the Negritos are found nearly everywhere from India to Japan and New Guinea, and that Negritos and Papuans live together in New Guinea and elsewhere, owned and intermixed, differing from the true Papuans\" . . . The same illustrations too are continually reproduced . . . De Quatrefages' literary references are frequently untrustworthy. He is in spite of his shortcomings respected by many writers as a reliable authority, etc., etc.\"\n\nThe \"Crania Ethnica\" is a constant stumbling-block and rock of offence to our author. He writes of a certain skull described as coming from Borneo. P. 26. \"The mischief caused by this Negrito skull will be carried on in books for some time to come in consequence of this frequent repetition.\" He is strongly of opinion that the existence of Negritos in Borneo has not yet been proved, and is much annoyed with M. de Quatrefages for assuming the contrary on the evidence of a solitary skull.\n\nWriting of the Moluccas of Lesser Sunda isles, our author disputes an opinion of Prof. Flower regarding the existence of a \"small Negroid population\" in certain islands. \"He is,\" he says, \"surely adopting, absolutely without the test of criticism, de Quatrefages' more recent statements (Les Pygm\u00e9es, 1887) which are more or less figments of de Quatrefages' imagination,\" etc.\n\nAgain (with reference to Negritos in Java), \"Flower appears here again to follow de Quatrefages (Pygm\u00e9es, 1887)\"\nblindly, but the statements in question are very much open to controversy.\" As in the case of Borneo, Mr. Meyer holds that the existence of Negritos in Java has not been proved.\n\nIn examining the evidence as to Negritos in Formosa, Herr Meyer again falls foul of \"Crania Ethnica\" and writes, \"For to conclude the occurrence of a race in a country from certain characters in two skulls, when this race has not yet been registered from that country, is in the present embryonic state of craniology, an unwarrantable proceeding, and the two French writers will certainly find no follower in this respect, except such as simply copy their assertions.\"\n\nHere Meyer disputes the existence of Negritos in Japan, on the evidence of certain skulls described by Hamy. He writes: \"In consequence, this Negritos Japanese skull found its way into the 'Crania Ethnica' and was duly recorded in all the writings of de Quatrefages and in many others.\"\n\nAs regards China, Herr Meyer equally questions the evidence as to Negritos. \"De Quatrefages and de Lacouperie looked upon each other as authorities, the assumption of the one standing for truth to the other, and vice versa; in consequence they tried to support each other, but it is more than questionable whether others will have the same belief in the categorical statements of these two writers.\"\n\nIn short, as regards the Dutch possessions, China and Japan, Herr Meyer finds that all accounts of Negritos outside the Philippines are traced on very poor evidence, or properly speaking on none at all. He reminds one of the famous chapter in the \"Natural History of Iceland\" headed \"Snakes\u2014There are none.\" Professor Meyer goes on to discuss the Negritos question as it concerns the Malay Peninsula, the Andamans, the Mergui and Nicobar Islands, Anam, Cochin China, Cambodia, India, Australia, and New Guinea. He glances (p. 72) at the question as to whether we are to regard the Negrito people as the little modified descendants of an extremely ancient race, (\"gens prisca mortalium\") the ancestors of all the Negro tribes, or whether they may be regarded as a type of comparatively recent growth, retrograded to their present condition after centuries of isolation and confinement to a limited space. \"For at the present time our knowledge of the mutability and amount of\nvariation in organic form and their result is still so inadequate,\nthat it is extremely rash to speculate in this general manner on\nthe genetic connection of races, and doubtless easier to set up\na clever hypothesis than to prove its full legitimacy, let alone\nnecessity.\n\nIn his conclusion he deplores the practice of describing\nskulls in detail \"which will never lead to profitable results.\"\nHe thus takes a final shot at the \"Crania Ethnica.\" \"Whoever\nwishes to obtain an idea of the chaos which reigns here let him\nread the 'Crania Ethnica' of de Quatrefages and Hamy: he\nwould need Ariadne's clue to find his way in this labyrinth of\nskull descriptions.\"\n\nHe appeals to \"some able investigator\" to dedicate his\npowers to the Negritos of the Philippines (as the Saranies have\ndone for the Weddas), and hopes that later generations will\nattain to the \"heights of knowledge\" and be able to look back\nto the present time with its gropings in the dark, its daring hy-\npotheses, its paucity of facts, as the childhood of Anthropology.\nA List of Brunie-Malay Words.\n\nCollected by H.

Hanitsch, Ph.D.\n\n(With four plates.)\n\nIntroductory remarks: The first part of this paper, containing the narrative of the expedition to Kina Balu, is based upon diary notes written during the journey and is practically the report which I sent in to the Committee of the Raffles Museum on April 27th of last year. The second part, containing the scientific results, could only be compiled after considerable delay; most of the zoological specimens obtained during the expedition had to be sent for identification to specialists at home and elsewhere, viz., Messrs. G. A. Boulenger, Edgar Smith, L. de Nic\u00e9ville, R. Shelford, D. Sharp and L. A. Borradaile, and I take this opportunity of thanking them for their assistance. Two papers by Mr. Boulenger, the one containing the description of a new Freshwater Fish (A. M. N. H., Ser. 7, Vol. IV., pp. 228-229) and the other that of three new Reptiles and a new Batrachian (ibid. pp. 451-454), and a paper by Mr. Borradaile on Freshwater Crustacea, one of which is new (P. Z. S., 1900, part I, 2 pp.) are reprinted.\n\nThe Government of this Colony had kindly furnished me with credentials to the British North Borneo Government, and my thanks are due to the officials there, chiefly Mr. R. M. Little, Resident of Labuan, and Mr. H. S. Haynes, Magistrate, Province Keppel, who made all arrangements for carriers and who otherwise assisted me in every possible way.\n\nNarrative.\n\nThe Mount of Kina Balu, British North Borneo, was first ascended in the year 1851 by Hugh Low (6), and since then by Spenser St. John (8) in 1858, F. W. Burbidge (4) in 1877, R. M. Little (5) in 1887, John Whitehead (10) in 1887 and 1888, and\nG. D. Haviland (9) in 1892. The idea of attempting the ascent myself occurred to me in January last (i.e. 1899) when I made the acquaintance of Mr. H. T. Burls, M.I.M.E., F.G.S., who was passing through Singapore on his way to North Borneo in order to prospect there for oil, and who wished to ascend Kina Balu apart from his primary business object. After some discussion on the subject in Singapore, we settled the preliminary arrangements for a joint expedition by correspondence after Mr. Burls had arrived in Labuan. H. E. Governor Beaufort, British North Borneo, expressed his willingness to join the expedition.\n\nI left Singapore by the S. S. \u2018Ranee\u2019 on Saturday, March 4th, 1899 accompanied by my assistant P. M. de Fontaine and two native servants, a Chinese cook and a Malay, and reached Labuan, after an unfavourable passage, on Thursday, March 9th. Mr. R. M. Little kindly met me on landing and explained to me the various preparations for transport and carriers which were being made by Mr. Haynes at Gaya. Unfortunately I heard at the same time that Mr. Burls and H. E. Governor Beaufort were prevented from joining the expedition, the former through an accident to his knee, the latter in consequence of his accelerated departure for Europe. However, Mr. Burls kindly offered to take me on a short trip to Brunei the next day, and we slept the night on board his steam launch \u201cMarudu\u201d in order to make an early start for Brunei.\n\nFriday, March 10th. We left about 3.30 a.m. for Brunei, arriving there at 9 a.m., explored the neighbourhood a little, visited a pawnshop where I bought a number of parangs and krisses for the Raffles Museum, and left again in the afternoon. We arrived in Labuan at 8 p.m. and slept on board the \u2018Marudu.\u2019\n\nSaturday, March 11th. Mr. Burls being unable to accompany me, I chartered the steam-launch \u2018Enterprise,\u2019 started from Labuan at 8.45 a.m., and had a pleasant run to Gaya, where I arrived at 7 p.m. We landed at the pier which is in process of being broken up. Since Mat Salleh destroyed the greater part of this village, including the Government offices, in 1897, the latter have been shifted to Gantian, on the mainland of Borneo, and the woodwork of this pier is now required for Gantian. In the darkness we climbed along the remains of the pier (at least \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) mile long), and, when near the other end, were rescued by a\nnative boat. Soon after, we met Mr. Haynes. As Mr. Little in his letter of instructions to Mr. Haynes had recommended that we should take the Tuaran route to Kina Balu, he very kindly promised to accompany me the next day as far as Panjut, a village on the mainland where our luggage carriers were awaiting us. I slept on board the 'Enterprise.'\n\nSunday, March 12th. We left the 'Enterprise' at sunrise and noticed crowds of the long-spined Sea-Urchin *Diadema setosum* in the shallow water below the pier, mostly sticking on to pieces of rotten timber lying at the bottom. From a fisherman we obtained a large number of the huge worm *Sipunculus robustus* which he was digging from the sandy shore for bait. At 8.30 a.m., we left Gaya in two rowing boats manned by Bajous, and had a most pleasant journey. When nearing Gantian, we passed through shallow water with beautiful corals and numbers of the striking red and black starfish *Oreaster nodosus*. At Gantian, usually known as Kabaggu by the natives, we met Mr. C. H. Keasberry, Sub-Treasurer and Postmaster. Then proceeding, we entered the Menkabong river at 1 p.m., passed the village of Mumpelum at 2 p.m., and soon after reached Berunggis where we landed. Here, without waiting for the second boat in De Fontaine's charge, which had dropped somewhat behind, Mr. Haynes and myself, with a few of the men, walked on to Panjut, about 2\u00bd miles distant, passing through swampy fields with exceedingly poor padi\u2014I hear by the way that this year's padi crop has been a failure throughout North Borneo\u2014and reached Panjut at 3.15 p.m. We settled down in a spacious Dusun house, with a splendid verandah, ornamented with about twenty head-trophies, and caused the drums to be beaten, which signal was to call the men to fetch our luggage from Berunggis. After about 1\u00bd hours' waiting, six Dusuns appeared with sledges drawn by water-buffaloes and started off towards our boats. At 6 p.m., as there were no signs of the luggage, I went back to Berunggis to hurry the men on and found that the second and larger boat had been obliged to stop lower down the river, as the tide had gone out, and that only a part of the luggage could be removed that evening. We returned towards Panjut, and feeling somewhat fatigued I mounted a water-buffalo, but as it floundered into a hole, I was promptly thrown off.\nThe harness was broken and the luggage upset, but otherwise no harm was done, and I mounted another buffalo, this time behind a Dusun driver; our progress was now safe, but the odour arising from my driver necessitated my holding my nose at a laterally elevated angle of $45^\\circ$.\n\nMonday, March 13th. We signalled for more men to fetch the rest of our luggage, but, after long waiting, only two men appeared. We followed them towards Berunggis and found a large fair in progress where the Dusuns from the interior were selling and exchanging their jungle produce with the Bajous, from the coast for fish, etc. Here Mr. Haynes introduced me to Malagup, a Dusun chief, who was to accompany me to Kina Balu, in charge of the coolies. Not catching the man's name I asked him directly for it, but was told by Mr. Haynes that the natives, and especially the chiefs, feel offended at being asked for their names directly; one is supposed to know them and in any case must find them out from a third person. Most of the Dusuns had come to the fair on their buffaloes, so that we now found no difficulty in getting sufficient conveyances for our luggage. Mr. Haynes here left me to return to Gantian, and I went back to Panjut, arriving there about 11 a.m. The coolies in the meantime had begun to gather, but appeared most indolent; they tried package after package, but finding them all too heavy, dropped them again in disgust. The situation seemed hopeless; even Malagup had vanished, and in the burning midday sun I had to go to his house, two or three miles distant, to look for him. I rode back on a buffalo to Panjut, but now our patience with the carriers was exhausted. The men had apparently only been awaiting for some forcible language, and at last took up the luggage. We made a start at 2.30 p.m., and after about 10 minutes' walk from Panjut we reached the broad and rapid Tuaran river. Only a single small boat, a dug-out, was available, and it took more than an hour to ferry us all across. Here we met a jovial old Chinaman who invited us to spend the first night in his house, in the village of Bandeian, not quite 2 miles higher up on the right bank of the Tuaran. This we accepted. The first day's march was thus only short, but I was glad to have made a start, and to have got the coolies away from their homes. They camped on a nice grassy ground be-\nbetween the house and the river, whilst I, with my men from Singapore, slept inside.\n\n**Tuesday, March 14th.** We left the Chinaman's house at about 7 a.m., walking through an open cultivated plain, passing many buffaloes grazing there who were apparently on the best of terms with flocks of snow-white herons who stalked about between them, or stood on their broad backs. We reached Menkaladai at 8 a.m., and soon after arrived at the foot of a long chain of hills. The ascent was steep and slippery, sometimes passing through old jungle, more often through high bamboo, lalang and fern. We rested on the top of the hill, and refreshed ourselves with delicious water from the branches of a creeper, called Pokok Gunatol by the natives, which the men cut off with their parangs, for every man was thus armed, some also carrying spears in addition. We marched on, and reached Kappa at 1.30 p.m. This is a miserable village of four or five houses in the midst of the jungle, with no attempt at a clearing, but plenty of filth and pigs about. We settled down in a house adorned with ancient skulls of deer and wild boar.\n\n**Wednesday, March 15th.** We left Kappa at 8 a.m., and walked along mountain ridges through bamboo, fern, and deep grass, or occasional forest. Drizzling rain set in soon and lasted for some hours. In the afternoon we passed through several clearings indicating the vicinity of a village, and reached Kalawat at 4 p.m., though some of the men only turned up at 6 p.m. This was a small but picturesque village, looking like an oasis in the wilderness around: an open grassy space with granite boulders lying about, and clumps of coco-nut palms shading the houses. The houses, however, were few, about five, and small, and their unpromising interiors together with the fineness of the night induced us to pitch our tent and camp outside. Many of the men did likewise. Malagup showed himself useful by buying for us a fowl and a joint of bamboo full of honey for seven cents.\n\n**Thursday, March 16th.** About 2 a.m. I was awakened by a heavy thunderstorm. I felt safe and comfortable in my tent (lent by the P.W.D., Singapore), till suddenly a little rain came trickling through my blanket, and I roused myself to find that it was pouring into the tent which was supposed to be waterproof.\nTo leave the tent and take refuge in the houses seemed impossible; it was pitch dark and the weather outside too awful. So I remained soaking till 6 a.m. when I fled to the next house. This experience cost us dear, since many of our things got wet through and remained so for several days. We left Kalawat in disgust at 9.50 a.m., fine rain falling at the time, but fortunately the sun came out soon after. Our path now descended, and we had an easy march to the Inuman River, arriving there about noon. This is a splendid river, rushing along over boulders and shaded by mighty trees. Here we bathed and the men caught me some remarkable tadpoles with huge suckers (*Rana cavitympanum*). They always found these tadpoles attached to the boulders in the most foaming parts of the river. We crossed by a ford to the left bank, and then over a low watershed and reached the Menternan River. This river we had to ford three times in close succession: the natives apparently making a speciality of short cuts: in this case it seemed to me it would have been much easier to ford the river once and then proceed along the bank, but my guides had different ideas. At 2.45 p.m. we reached Bungol, a large village on the left bank of the Menternan. Here the men begged me for a treat to buy them a bull. As this somewhat startling proposal only involved an expenditure of $3, and it was a splendid young beast, I agreed, and much admired the speed with which the animal was despatched and disappeared in the various cooking pots. I myself had an excellent steak before me about an hour after the bargain had been concluded. Heavy rain fell during the late evening.\n\n*Friday, March 17th.* The day opened somewhat foggy, but fine, and we started at 7.45 a.m., fording the Menternan three times, and ascending Gunong Kampil by a slow incline. Then followed a tremendously steep descent, about 2000' down a grass-covered slope, to the Kadamaian river, which is the local name for the upper course of the Tampassuk. The river here is already deep and difficult to ford on account of its strong current. The men were up to their necks in water, and had to carry the luggage on their heads. Fortunately everything remained dry, with the exception of my camera. We rested on the right bank of the river, and reached Koung at 2.15 p.m., having had fine weather during the march, though rain set in\nsoon after. I heard that the rice coolies were awaiting us in this village. They had left Panjut on March 5th with instructions to proceed to Kiou, but, being afraid of the people of Kiou, they had stopped here.\n\nSaturday, March 18th. We left Koung at 7.40 a.m. and proceeded along the right bank of the Tampassuk, climbing over many cliffs and boulders along the edge of the river. Then we forded the deep and rapid river Lobang near its junction with the Tampassuk, passed through some swampy undulating ground covered with grass, fern and bushwood, forded the small and winding Kiulan river several times, ascended a high and steep hill, and reached Kiou at 12.30 p.m. Kiou is a village of considerable size, the largest we had met so far during our march, scattered over an extensive grassy clearing on an enormous slope, with many clusters of coco-nut palms in the vicinity of the houses. I heard that I was the first European who had visited Kiou for four or five years, but it is apparently more than that, as two men showed me certificates from Dr. G. D. Haviland, dated April 24th, 1892, which stated that the bearers had acted as his guides during his ascent of Kina Balu in March 1892. Dr. Haviland, called 'Tuan Bunga' by the natives, seems to have been the last European here, and before him Mr. John Whitehead in 1887, who is remembered as 'Tuan Burong.' Malagup, the Dusun Chief, here came to me soon after our arrival, saying:\n\nM. 'Tabek, Tuan, itu orang coolie mau satu ayam.'\nR. H. \"Apa? Itu orang coolie samoa samoa mau satu ayam?\"\nM. 'Tabek, Tuan, satu ayam besar.'\nR. H. \"Satu ayam besar? Apa macham ayam besar?\"\nM. 'Tabek, Tuan, satu kerbau.'\n\nThe men had apparently enjoyed the bullock I had given them two days before, but I am afraid my answer to Malagup did not encourage similar requests. Still the men seemed to be bent on pleasure, for they asked me for a holiday the next day, which happened to be a Sunday. To this I agreed. In the morning the weather had been dry, except for a few minutes of drizzling rain. But we had rain all afternoon till late into the night. Aneroid at 3.45 p.m. 2400'; thermometer 76\u00b0 F.\nSunday, March 19th. I ascended with De Fontaine to the top of Kiou hill which is covered with deep jungle and is about 1000' above the village. From a clearing we had a wonderful view of Kina Balu; nothing intervened between here and the foot of the mountain which seemed scarcely more than three miles off, and the top of the mountain, bare and rocky, stood out chiselled clear and sharp against the sky. Our success in collecting was small, but the men brought in a good deal, especially stag-horn beetles and several species of coconut beetles. *Megalophrys nasuta*, the strange frog with the large projecting triangular eye-lids and triangular flap to its nose, seemed to be common here, as we found it the day before in Koung. I interviewed the guides; the one informed me he could only start with us in two days, as he had to get a fowl and seven eggs for sacrifice to the spirits of the mountain. Arguing with him led to no results. The other guide, however, declared that he would be ready on the next morning.\n\nMonday, March 20th. We rose early to make a start for Kina Balu, but the coolies, who had scattered over the whole village, were slow in assembling. I interviewed Malagup at 8 a.m. and tried to expedite matters, but at 10 a.m., as sufficient men had not appeared, I decided to leave some of my luggage behind and start. But we had still to wait for the guide who finally turned up after urgent messages. He now refused to go without his colleague, the fowl and the seven eggs. So at 10.45 a.m., with blessings on the guides, the fowl and the seven eggs, I decided to abandon the start. Things seemed utterly hopeless.\u2014Morning sunny, afternoon dreadfully rainy and dreary.\n\nTuesday, March 21st. Dull morning, rain until daybreak. The men really turned up soon after 6.30 a.m., but a start was not made until 7.30 a.m. After a steep descent we reached an isolated group of houses, which the natives still called Kiou, at 8 a.m., aneroid 1800', then continued the descent to the Kadamaien River which we reached at 8.25 a.m., aneroid 1500', crossed twice by bamboo bridges and twice by fords, passed a little village in the midst of an extensive plantation of Keladi and a little maize, had to cross by a formidable ford just below the place where the river forms a small island, and from there\nour way lay almost exclusively inside the bed of the river which consisted of a never-ending series of foaming cataracts rushing over boulders of granite, and we had to force our way through the one and climb over the other. The men seemed disheartened, and the guides recommended waiting a day for the water to go down. This seemed an empty excuse at the time, but a little experience showed us later on how very variable the height of the water is in these mountainous regions. We still plodded on, and after many difficulties and some mishaps\u2014one of which was the breaking of the ground glass of my camera\u2014we reached at 1 p.m., a spot on the bank of the river sheltered by a huge slanting rock. Here we camped. Aneroid 2150'.\n\nWednesday, March 22nd. I slept little during the night, being kept awake by the comparative cold (about 65\u00b0 F.) and the roaring of the river. Aneroid, 6.30 a.m.: 2050'. We started at 8.25 a.m., proceeding again chiefly in the bed of the Kadamaian. The cataracts and boulders were, if anything, worse than the day before. My sturdy Chinese cookie got washed away by the torrent, but was rescued by the men. After some hours we finally left the river, and began a steep ascent, first along a little brook which came dancing down over precipices, then along an ordinary steep jungle path. Mosquitoes, which during the whole journey, even in the native houses, had been scarcely noticeable, began, from about 3500', to be very troublesome whenever one was still. At 2.45 p.m., we reached a huge ledge of rock similar to the one under which we had camped the previous day. Here we stopped. When changing, as I always did on reaching camp, I found a leach on my leg, the only one during the whole expedition, although I took no special precautions against them. Aneroid 4140'. Sunny morning, foggy late in the afternoon, and a little rain.\n\nThursday, March 23rd. Another cold night, during which, as in fact during the whole expedition, I enjoyed little sleep, feeling the cold chiefly in my joints, notwithstanding plenty of warm clothing and blankets. The morning opened dismal, with drizzling rain. The guides informed me that it would now take two more days to reach the cave (about 9500'), and as at that rate probably two additional days would be required to reach the summit (13,698'), and probably as much time again to descend\nto where we were, say eight days in all, without any time for collecting, and as of the first half of the time allowed for the expedition only two days were left, I decided to proceed no further, but to begin to collect on the spot. I was also influenced by the guides' statement that the next climb would be stiffer than before and would have to be done without shoes, and that most of the men and the bulk of the luggage would have to be left behind. That these statements were no exaggerations, I knew from the accounts of former travellers. It was a severe disappointment to give up the idea of reaching the top, but I saw that a hurried climb with all sorts of discomfort would bring little practical result, and that the aim of the expedition would be served better by collecting now on the lower ranges of the mountain. I therefore made the men go out collecting, and as I promised them little rewards, I was kept busy all morning receiving and bottling specimens. Dismal rainy afternoon, during which I amused myself (and still more the natives) by compiling a little Dusun vocabulary, chiefly with Malagup's help. Temperature at 5 p.m. 66\u00b0. Glorious sunset. Fine moon during the night which, however, did not favour sleep, and though the slanting rock protected us against rain, it was of no use against the moonlight.\n\nFriday, March 24th. The temperature between 3 p.m. on the previous evening and 7 a.m. varied between 60\u00b0 and 64\u00b0 F. Aneroid 4210'. I went out collecting with my men in the vicinity of the camp. The ground was exceedingly steep, and there was a great deal of loose rock about: I had constantly to warn the men to collect at the same level, not below and above each other; the rocks were continually crashing down into the valley like miniature avalanches. Mosquitoes were again very troublesome in parts of this jungle. The men brought in small Mammals (shrews, squirrels, rats), trapped during the night, and also a good many Reptiles, Amphibians and Insects. A welcome surprise: the guides, who were now convinced that I should not attempt to ascend to the summit, presented me with the fowl which had been intended for the spirits of the mountain. Apparently we did not require any spiritual protection in these lower ranges. The natives evidently did not mean to swindle the gods, as the fowl was most excellent and tender. Maximum\nKadamaian River, Kina Balu, British North Borneo, 2000'\n\n(LOOKING UP.)\ntemperature during the day: $67^\\circ$, down to $65^\\circ$ at 5.45 p.m.; fine, but foggy, in the morning; the usual rain in the afternoon.\n\nSaturday, March 25th. Temperature during the night $60.5^\\circ$-$63^\\circ$. Nice clear morning. Many frogs were brought in by the natives. We packed, and began our descent and our way home at 9.45 a.m., as now the first half of my leave had expired (i.e., three of the six weeks.) We reached the Kadamaian at 11.45 a.m., and our old camp, under the ledge of rock, at 1.25 p.m., where I decided to stay a day to collect. The descent to the river was steep and difficult, but this time the river itself offered no dangers and difficulties comparable with those of a few days before, as the water had gone down. Weather fine until 3 p.m., when the usual rain set in.\n\nSunday (Palm Sunday), March 26th. Although the temperature at night time here was only very little higher than in the upper camp ($65^\\circ$-$65^\\circ$, as against $60^\\circ$-$64^\\circ$), we found the change very noticeable and most agreeable. I mended my camera by substituting a piece of oiled paper for the ground glass broken some days before, and took a few views of camp and river. Then we went collecting, the men bringing in a good deal.\n\nMonday, March 27th. Lowest temperature during the night $64^\\circ$; at 6.30 a.m., $65^\\circ$. I took some more photographs, and we started for Kiou at 9.30 a.m., the progress through the river being very easy. We reached the open field at 9.50 a.m., and Kiou at 12.30 p.m. [Two of the photographs are here reproduced, both taken from the same point, but one looking up, the other down, the Kadamaian River. Within the bed of this river our route lay for a considerable distance up and down Kina Balu. But on the day when these photographs were taken, the water was considerably lower than on March 21st and 22nd when we went up the mountain.]\n\nTuesday, March 28th. Early in the morning I went with De Fontaine to the top of Kiou hill to take some photos of Kina Balu, but found it hazy and the sun standing just above the mountain. We waited for matters to improve, and climbed about in search of a favourable spot, finding the heat of the morning scarcely bearable. Finally we took a few views, and returned to Kiou, hot and tired. Then after calling the coolies together, we left the village at 10.30 a.m., went down a steep descent,\nproceeded along our former path, and got a view of the picturesque village of Lobang, perched on a hill in front of us, and, like most of the villages here, fringed round with coco-nut palms. We passed below the village, and reached the river Lobang at 11.45 a.m. We had to ford it as before, and most of the men as usual took the opportunity of having a proper bath, but, for the first time during the expedition, I felt myself disinclined for the exertion. Rain set in soon after, and we reached Koung at 1.55 p.m. I developed a strange dry cough in the evening, which, however, disappeared during the night.\n\nWednesday, March 29th. I had the usual trouble with the coolies before they took up their luggage. Some were scattered over the village, and with Malagup I had to go to a house on the hill to fetch the last stragglers. Whilst the men were still packing, I left Koung by myself at 8.45 a.m., wishing to proceed slowly and intending to await the others at the ford of the Tampassuk which I thought I remembered. But after half an hour's walk, I found that I had lost my way, and endeavoured to return, passing through jungle and wet grass, breast high. At last I heard the shouts of the men, and reached the ford just as the last of them were crossing. I felt pretty well exhausted, but undressed and went through the rapid river, requiring all my energy to keep my balance. When dressing again I had great difficulty in putting on my clothes which were damp with perspiration and with wading through brooks and tall grass during the last hour. I called out for help and then almost immediately collapsed in a faint, though retaining consciousness. I felt as if I had arrived at a very literal 'dead stop,' lying groaning between the boulders on the bank of the river and suffering much from cramp in my limbs. When able to speak again, I got the men to make me a bed of leaves and light a fire, and then to prepare for me a strong soup. After taking this I felt better, and when half-an-hour or so had passed, was able to get up again. A message was sent to the men in front of us to stop. De Fontaine as usual proved most helpful and equal to emergencies, as he had been throughout the whole expedition. All this happened on the left bank of the Tampassuk which, consisting chiefly of sand and boulders, was only a few yards broad and rose at once into the extremely steep Gunong.\nKampil, about 2000' high. Being covered with grass only, this hill was exposed to the full glare of the sun. However, I decided to push on to our next stopping place, Bungol, rather than return to Koung, but progress was exceedingly slow, as after every twenty yards or so of climbing I had to rest. After an hour's time I took a tin of Brand's Essence of Beef, and in another hour a cocktail, and, with the help of a man in front of me, who pulled me up with his stick, I progressed better. The men were most patient and stopped every time with me. At about 2 o'clock the sky darkened, affording at least some protection against the burning sun, and finally the usual thunderstorm broke forth, but with abnormal violence. Still climbing and quite drenched, we reached a little broken-down shed where some of the men, with most of my private luggage and the tent, were awaiting me. Most of the party, however, including Malagup, had gone on to Bungol. Here I partook of more refreshment, and feeling very much better by this and probably also by the cooling rain, I, after a little rest, astonished and amused my men by shouting out 'lakas, lakas' when they were taking up their things at 4.15 p.m. The ascent continued, so did the pouring rain, and finally, near the top of the mountain, we entered thick jungle. Lightning and thunderclaps were now frequent, and were greeted with yells by the men. Now began a slow descent along a clayey and deeply worn jungle path which in many places was transformed into a yellow stream. About 6 p.m. the rain ceased, and we approached the River Menternan with many misgivings. I knew it had to be forded before reaching Bungol, and when we arrived on the bank at 6.15 p.m., I was not surprised to find it a roaring yellow torrent, impossible to cross. But we had some hope, as from the marks along the bank we saw that it was going down rapidly after the heavy thunderstorm. So we decided to wait a little, I trying to keep myself warm by walking about. It got dark now and I lit the stump of a candle which I found in my portmanteau, and the men made long, but fruitless efforts to light a fire. Two or three of our most plucky men were daring enough to cross the river in order to go to Bungol for help and a lamp, but they did not return. Waiting and shivering with cold, we stood about till 8 p.m., when I decided to stay where I was and fix up my tent. I put\non dry clothes, wrapped myself in blankets and felt warm and comfortable, although getting only little sleep. But as the river by this time had gone down considerably, De Fontaine and some of the men managed to cross and reached Bungol in safety. Only a few Dusuns stayed with me, making as usual next to no effort to prepare a sleeping place for themselves, but remaining squatted on the wet ground, some perhaps with a few sticks between it and themselves, but in no case with protection above. My camp-bed broke down partly during the night.\n\nThursday, March 30th. I got up at 6 a.m. and found that there had actually been no rain during the night. Some of the men had already returned from Bungol to help us across the Menternan, so we left at 6.30 a.m., and as I still wore my dry and warm flannels from the previous evening, I had myself carried across the river, which we had to ford three times, and reached Bungol at 7.45 a.m. I felt the need of a day's rest, and decided to remain here, but gave directions to Malagup to proceed with the coolies carrying the luggage which was not immediately required, to Panjut, our starting place on the coast. I gave him instructions to reach there on the Saturday following, and to discharge the coolies on arrival, giving him also a letter for the district officer there to the same effect. I spent the day resting and taking notes. Dull day, drizzling rain from about 1 p.m., heavy rain from 3 p.m.\n\nFriday (Good Friday), March 31st. I had a comfortable night, although only little sleep. We left Bungol at 8.3 a.m., forded the Menternan and Inuman Rivers, climbed the Gunong Kalawat, and reached Kalawat at 1.55 p.m., in fog and rain. It was a heavy day's work, ascending nearly all the time, added to which was the recollection of our march over the same ground two weeks ago, when we had found the down-hill way so easy. This time we did not attempt to camp out in this village, and I managed to get a tiny, but comfortable room all to myself.\n\nSaturday, April 1st. We left Kalawat at 7.30 a.m., caught sight of the sea for the first time again at 9.40, and were overjoyed, like Xenophon and his companions. When approaching Kappa, about 2 p.m., one of the men who had been in advance came running back to say that a 'Tuan' had arrived in the village and wished to see me. It was Mr. Burls on his way to\nwards Kina Balu. He told me that he had left Labuan on March 16th, and, on account of trouble with the carriers, had been detained on his way. The old Chinaman whose hospitality we had enjoyed some weeks ago in Bandaian, had turned up in Kappa before my arrival, and had informed Mr. Burls that gold was to be found one hour\u2019s walk from here. So Mr. Burls sent for the Dusun who was supposed to know the spot, and, on my advice, asked the man to fetch him a piece of the precious metal. The man promised to do so next morning at daybreak.\n\nSunday (Easter), April 2nd. At 7.30 a.m. Mr. Burls heard that the Dusun had not started as yet for the gold, but would do so after his breakfast. This was at last over, but then the Chinaman came to say that the locality was unsafe on account of an enormous snake. The Chinaman\u2019s arms were just long enough to give us an idea of this snake\u2019s diameter. We tried to allay those fears, but were then told that the gold was down a deep hole, that candles were required, and that at least three men would have to go. To my regret I had to leave Kappa in the midst of this interesting discussion, starting at 8.40 a.m. It was a nice morning, after pouring with rain all night until 6 a.m. We began the descent at 10.15 a.m., reached the plain at 10.50, the village of Menkaladai at 11.30, rested a little, and reached the Tuaran River at 2.20 p.m., one of the men taking us through a most swampy \u2018short cut,\u2019 between padi fields. Here we had to wait a little while for a boat, and I reached Panjut somewhat in advance of the others at 3 p.m., with feelings of profound relief. Being transplanted comparatively suddenly from the hilly interior to Panjut, in the plain and near the sea, the people here struck one at once as more comfortable and better off: they had more buffaloes, many goats, and sledges, which indeed would have been impossible inland, and better clothing, and were also oftener intoxicated, a sure sign of civilization. But there were also more flies and ants in the houses, and more mosquitoes at night time, which, however, were not very troublesome. We heard that on the day before there had been a large funeral here, on which occasion five buffaloes were killed.\n\nMonday, April 3rd. As I was absolutely in the dark as to when and where, whether in Gaya or in Labuan, we should be\nable to catch a steamer to take us to Singapore, I sent De Fontaine to Gantian to make enquiries. I spent the day taking notes, the coolies and crowds of villagers as usual standing and squatting round me, and watching every movement, nearly distracting me by their continuous coughing. But I found some music going on in a neighbouring house very soothing.\n\nTuesday, April 4th. De Fontaine came back at 7 a.m., after having travelled part of the night, bringing the dismal news that a coasting steamer had left Gaya for Labuan at midnight. This really made no difference in the end, however, as we heard later on that this boat had no connection in Labuan with boats for Singapore. He had brought with him a large rowing boat, and so I decided to leave at once for Gantian. We started from Panjut at 8.30 a.m., reached Berunggis at 9.15, left there by boat at 9.30, and reached the district office of Menkabong, at the mouth of the Menkabong river, at 12.30. Here we had a rudimentary tiffin, left again at 2 p.m., and, rowing and sailing, reached Gantian at 4.53 p.m. It was a very trying journey: the day was hot and cloudless, and we sat in an open boat cramped between piles of luggage. To my regret, I found Mr. Haynes, who in the meantime had shifted from Gaya to Gantian, down with liver, but Mr. Keasberry kindly took charge of us and put us up in an unfinished wooden house intended for the native clerk. The carpenters with their boards and wood shavings lying about were cleared out in a few minutes, and we established ourselves there in a rough and ready fashion.\n\nWednesday, April 5th. No work done, all feeling the need of a day's rest. I saw some newspapers, for the first time for about a month.\n\nThursday, April 6th. I hired a native boat and went out at 6.30 a.m. to the reefs where I did some collecting, chiefly corals, a native diving for them, and spent the greater part of the day in cleaning and bleaching the corals. A coasting steamer brought the welcome news from Mr. Little, Labuan, that two gentlemen, Messrs Lower and Pavitt, would arrive in Gaya on Sunday next with the steam-launch 'Sri Putri,' and could take me down to Labuan just in time to catch the 'Hecuba' for Singapore. De Fontaine was ill this day.\nFriday, April 7th. I collected more corals, and De Fontaine went out shooting birds and squirrels. There were strange rumours about: trouble was expected with the natives in the neighbourhood, and rough defences, consisting of breast-high boarding with sand between and plenty of barbed wire outside, were erected around the offices. We noticed several little colonies of natives settling down on the shore of the bay just to the north of Gantian, having left their homes out of fear.\n\nSaturday, April 8th. We spent the day in packing and preparing for our return to Singapore.\n\nSunday, April 9th. Messrs Tower and Pavitt arrived here at 8.45 a.m., and informed me of the arrival of their steam-launch in Gaya. I reached Gaya at 12.15 p.m., and we all left for Labuan at 4.40 p.m.\n\nMonday, April 10th. We anchored during the night off Pulo Tiga, reached Labuan at 10.53 a.m. and put our luggage on board the 'Hecuba'. I went to see Mr. Little, made two or three calls and returned to the 'Hecuba' which was to sail at 4 p.m. On my way down to the boat I found the place in great excitement as Governor Beaufort was leaving by her for Singapore, bound for Europe. The natives expressed their farewell good wishes by firing off crackers, and by music and processions. Also a large party of Europeans came on board to see H. E. off. The boat left at 5.15 p.m.\n\nTuesday, April 11th\u2014Thursday, April 13th. At sea. Pleasant passage.\n\nFriday, April 14th. We anchored off Singapore soon after midnight, and landed at Johnston's Pier at 7.15 a.m.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nBarter and Coinage. When preparing for my expedition I was in doubt as to whether I should take with me a supply of barter, as Spenser St. John, Whitehead, and others had done, but was afterwards glad that I had abandoned the idea. The things I would have taken would certainly have been almost useless. What we were asked for in every village to and from Kina Balu was kerosine oil, and the natives always annoyed us by bringing large vessels in the hope of sharing our little supply. Next in demand were soap and matches. Only once in Kiou were we\nasked for cloth and red beads. Thus, with the exception of the last, it is the necessaries of life which would seem to be required, not trifles, though the red beads, as universally worn by the women, may almost also be regarded as necessaries. Instead of barter I had supplied myself with plenty of small silver, but was highly astonished to find these coins were almost unknown; even Malagup, the Dusun chief, living in a comparatively rich district on the coast close to where a large fair is held once or twice a week, did not know the value of a 5-cent piece. These coins were always accepted with distrust, except by a young man in Bungol who had a collection of them. But he had lived in Kudat for some time and spoke Malay fluently. On the other hand, notes (B. N. Borneo has notes down to the value of $1, 50 cents, and 25 cents), silver dollars, and copper cents were always acceptable, copper being apparently the chief currency, though the natives were glad when they could exchange their copper savings for silver dollars with us. In great demand also were the empty provisions tins, especially those with lids, and it was amusing to see the scramble when one threw an empty condensed milk tin away.\n\nOn the March. We generally started at 8 a.m. and reached the next stopping place about 2 p.m., the villages being at convenient distances from each other. The weather as a rule was fine in the morning, but rain set in nearly always in the early afternoon, so that we seldom reached camp without getting wet. However, this made little difference, as we were often soaking wet from fording the rivers. Naturally we always changed on reaching camp and made an attempt to dry our things, but they were generally still wet on the next morning, and when setting out on our march we always put on the wet things from the day before, feeling only little discomfort. There is a narrow path from Panjut right up to Kiou, just wide enough for one man, but broadening out in the neighbourhood of the villages, and of course branching off here and there. It runs for a considerable distance along the top of the mountain ridges, rather provokingly following every one of their curves, but having the advantage of a free outlook for ascertaining one's whereabouts. Paths along the rivers on this route were exceedingly rare, thus differing essentially from the Tampassuk\nroute to Kina Balu. After Kiou the path continued in the usual way, became somewhat indistinct after we had left the Kadamian River, but was more noticeable here and there from old camping places and traps for birds and smaller game set at intervals.\n\n*Life amongst the Natives.* We found the Dusuns very good-natured and harmless people, and quite honest until the last day in Panjut when our kerosine oil disappeared for a few hours and some other trifling things for ever. They were certainly somewhat lazy in the morning, and there was generally a great deal of grumbling before they took up their loads, but when once started, they left little to be desired, and showed themselves splendid carriers especially on hilly ground. Very annoying was their intense curiosity: when we arrived at a village, not only our carriers and the people of the house with their immediate friends, but all the village came and stood there, several rows deep, around us. We could not change our socks or any other part of our dress without themselves and their women and children taking stock of every movement and every article. It was the same when the cook prepared my meals or when I partook of the same, when I wrote my notes or bottled specimens, when I undressed at night-time and disappeared behind the mosquito-curtain, everything formed food for their admiration and amazement. Sometimes when I sat perfectly still without doing anything, their attention relaxed, but my slightest movement had the effect of the curtain rising at the Pantomine, the eyes and open mouths of all present were directed to one point. No box or portmanteau could be opened without everyone rushing to see what it contained. When I awoke in the morning I was sure to find people squatting round my camp-bed who had apparently been anxiously waiting for signs of my awaking. The worst was that it was impossible to escape from it: as, once arrived at a village at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon, we changed, and as we nearly always had rain from that hour and the neighbourhood of the houses was a mass of filth, accumulated ever since the houses had been built, we did not care to go out and get wet and dirty again. The inside of the houses was at least dry and fairly clean, the floor, raised about five feet above the ground, being formed of split bamboo, in\nmany cases covered by rattan matting, and in a few cases the owners of the houses brought me a special mat to sit upon. The space below the houses was generally inhabited by pigs, but though they grunted day and night, it did not interfere with our peace. Much more annoying was the continuous coughing of the people, many of them seeming to suffer from chronic colds. Taken altogether, the stay in the Dusun houses was far from pleasant, and on dull days exceedingly dreary, but, after our experience at Kalawat, it was preferable to camping in the open.\n\nFood. As I mentioned before, the last padi crop was a failure in N. Borneo, but even in prosperous years it would probably be impossible to get sufficient rice from the different villages for a large body of carriers, and on this occasion people did not even like to sell a few cents\u2019 worth. In the district we visited communication is a matter of intense difficulty, everything has to be carried by man, the hilly parts are quite impassable for bullocks, and the rivers are torrents along which even the smallest crafts could not find a passage except for a few hundred yards at a time. However, in almost every village I was able to get fowls and eggs for my own consumption, the former ranging in price between 10 and 20 cents, sometimes even less, and eggs from 1 to 2 cents. But large parties would probably have been unable to get sufficient. Milk was unknown. Coco-nuts we got in every village free of charge, and they were always welcome. There was practically no house without a group of coco-nut and betel-nut palms close by. Two or three times we got Langsats, which seemed to grow half wild, especially near Koung. They were very refreshing, but unusually sticky.\n\nScientific Results.\n\nMAMMALS.\n\nFrom the list given below it will be noticed that no big game was obtained during the expedition. The largest mammal seen was a black long-tailed monkey, probably *Semnopithecus femoralis*, observed near Gantian. However, in the mountain jungle between Kappa and Kalawat, we passed several traps which we were told were intended for Tembadaus (*Bos sondaicus*).\nThese traps consisted of two rows of substantial upright poles rammed into the ground and converging at one end, the other end being open and continuous with the jungle path, so that the animal once entered would jam itself between the poles at the far end of the traps. Traps for small mammals, as figured by Burbidge (4), p. 87, and Whitehead (10), p. 167, were frequently seen on Kina Balu, and most of our mammals were obtained with them. The only mammal we saw in anything like numbers was the bat *Cynopterus lucasi* which made its appearance generally late in the afternoon at our upper camp, 4,200'. The following is a complete list of the mammals obtained.\n\n*Cynopterus lucasi* \u2642 \u2640 Kina Balu, 4,200'.\n*Scotophilus temminckii* \u2640 Kappa.\n*Tupaia ferruginea longipes* \u2642 Kina Balu, 4,000'.\n*Crocidura fuliginosa* \u2642 Kina Balu, 4,000'.\n*Gymnura (Hylomys) suilla* \u2640 Kina Balu, 2,100'.\n*Sciurus brookei* \u2642 Kina Balu, 4,000'.\n*notatus* \u2640 Gantian.\n*prevostii* \u2642 Gantian.\n*Mus mulleri* \u2640 Kina Balu, 4,000'.\n*sabanus* \u2642 Kina Balu, 2,000'.\n*whiteheadi* \u2640 Koung.\n*ephippium* \u2640 Bungol.\n*rattus* \u2642 \u2640 Several specimens on the hills and in the low lands.\n\n**Birds.**\n\nOnly three common birds were obtained in the lowland near Gantian:\n\n*Bubulcus coromandus* \u2640.\n*Nyctiornis amicta* \u2642 \u2640.\n*Rhinortha chlorophaea* \u2640.\n\nAt Kiou, 2,400', a female *Merula obscura*, since identified by Mr. A. L. Butler, was obtained.\n\n**Reptiles.**\n\nThe chief prizes obtained during the expedition belong to this group, as of the 18 species collected three proved new to\nscience, one of them representing a new genus, and two others new species. It is noteworthy that of only a very few species was more than one specimen obtained.

Boulenger, F.R.S., (3) pp. 451-453 is as follows:\n\n*Gecko rhacophorus*.\n\n\"Head moderately large, once and one-third as long as broad; snout longer than the distance between the eye and the ear-opening; once and a half the diameter of the orbit; ear-opening round, its diameter one-third that of the eye. Body and limbs much depressed, bordered with dermal expansions; fingers\nand toes fully half-webbed. Head, body, and limbs covered with minute granules intermixed with small, round, smooth tubercles; rostral a little more than twice as broad as deep, without median cleft; nostril pierced between several small scales; nine upper and ten lower labials; symphysial small, pentagonal; a series of six small chin-shields; spine-like tubercles on the sides of the head, the largest above the ear. A moderately developed scalloped membrane on each side of the body, scaled like the body and fringed on the edge. Abdominal scales flat juxtaposed granules. An angular series of praeanal pores. Tail depressed, scaled like the body, bordered with a series of rounded lobes. Greyish above, speckled with darker and with wavy dark transverse lines; brownish beneath throat with darker dots.\u201d\n\nMillim.\n\n| Total length | ... | ... | ... | 105 |\n|--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Head         | ... | ... | ... | 18  |\n| Width of head| ... | ... | ... | 14  |\n| Body         | ... | ... | ... | 47  |\n| Fore limb    | ... | ... | ... | 21  |\n| Hind limb    | ... | ... | ... | 28  |\n| Tail         | ... | ... | ... | 40  |\n\n\u201cA single specimen from the Kadamaian River, Kina Balu, 2,100 feet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis species connects Gecko with Ptychozoon and stands in the same relation to the latter genus as Hemidactylus platyurus does to Mimetozoon. The lesser development of the parachute-like lateral membrane and the absence of differentiation in the lepidosis of that membrane, justify its allocation to the genus Gecko rather than Ptychozoon.\u201d\n\nStoliczkaia borneensis.\n\n\u201cRostral moderately large, triangular, not visible from above; a pair of very narrow internasals; a pair of large prae-frontals, separated from the frontal and supraoculars by a series of small scales; frontal a little broader than long, a little shorter than the parietals; supraocular very small; eye very prominent, with vertically subelliptic pupil, surrounded by the supraocular, two or three preoculars, the fifth labial, and seven or eight small scales; nostril very large; loreal much longer than deep;\nten upper labials, the two last longest; temporals small, scale-like; a single pair of small chin-shields, in contact with three lower labials. Scales in 30 rows, those on the vertebral region and those adjacent to the ventral shields largest, elongate rhomboidal, juxtaposed, the others very small and separated by naked skin. Ventrals 210; anal entire; subcaudals 124. Rufous, with large blackish spots, at least as large as the space between them, disposed more or less regularly in three longitudinal series; brown beneath, the shields edged with yellowish.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotal length 750 millim.; tail 240.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single female specimen from Mount Kina Balu, 4,200 feet.\u201d\n\n*Oreocalamus*, gen. nov.\n\n\u201cAgrees in every respect with *Macrocalamus*, Gthr., except in the presence of a pair of internasal shields.\u201d\n\n*Oreocalamus hanitschi*.\n\n\u201cSnout pointed. Rostral as deep as broad, the portion visible from above measuring half its distance from the frontal; internasals half as long as the prefrontals; frontal hexagonal, once and a half as long as broad, longer than its distance from the end of the snout, shorter than the parietales; nostril close to the rostral, between a nasal and the first labial (the suture between the two shields has disappeared on the left side of the type specimen); loreal longer than deep, its lower border forming an angle wedged in between the second and third labials; one pre-and one postocular; temporals 1+2; eight upper labials, fourth and fifth entering the eye, seventh largest; first lower labial in contact with its fellow behind the symphysial; four lower labials in contact with the anterior chin-shields; posterior chin-shields shorter, in contact with each other. Scales smooth, in 17 rows. Ventrals 127; anal entire; subcaudals 26 pairs. Blackish brown above and on the outer ends of the ventral shields; belly yellowish white, with a few scattered brown dots; tail brown beneath, with a darker median streak.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotal length 375 millim.; tail 50.\u201d\n\n\u201cA single male specimen from Kina Balu, 4,200 feet.\u201d\nAMPHIBIANS.\n\nOf these we obtained fifteen different species, one of which proved new to science. Unlike the Reptiles, we obtained of most species of this group numerous specimens, until on Kina Balu we had to refuse the more common species which the men brought in. We also noticed on our march how the various species of Batrachians replaced each other as we went along. At Panjut, nearest the coast, we obtained only *Rana erythrea*, which was followed by *Rhacophorus leucomystax* at the Tuaran River, by *Rana kuhlii* on Gunong Kappa and Gunong Kalawat, by *Megalophrys nasuta* at Koung, Kiou and the Kadamaian River, Kina Balu, 2,100'. Finally *Bufo leptopus*, *B. penangensis* and especially *Rana whiteheadi* were dominant on Kina Balu. Of the latter species enormous numbers were brought in. The single specimen of *Ichthyophis glutinosus* was found lying near the bank of the Menternan River, after a heavy thunderstorm, with a great deal of sand sticking to its slimy surface.\n\nVery interesting were the tadpoles of *Rana cavitympanum*, with their huge ventral suckers, which my men found attached to the boulders in the most foaming parts of the Inuman River where the current was so strong that we could keep our feet only with the greatest difficulty. T. Mocquard (7) in an appendix to Whitehead's 'Exploration of Kina Balu,' pp. 285-286, discusses these adhesive disks and considers the tadpoles to be parasitic. If, however, he had had the opportunity of seeing these creatures alive in their natural surroundings, he would have had no difficulty in discovering the true function of those suckers, which can only be to enable their owners to hold on to a firm object in the midst of the raging torrent in which their existence commences.\n\nThe Amphibians obtained are:\n\n*Rana cavitympanum* (tadpoles). Inuman River.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 erythrea. Panjut.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 kuhlii. Gunong Kappa and G. Kalawat.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 luctuosa. Koung.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014 whiteheadi.

Menternan River, near Bungol.\n\nEight specimens were obtained of the new form Leptobrachium baluense and Mr. Boulenger, (3), pp. 453-454, gives the following description of the one specimen submitted to him:\n\n**Leptobrachium baluense.**\n\n\"Tongue pyriform, entire. Vomerine teeth in two small widely separated groups behind the line of the choanae. Head much depressed, nearly twice as broad as long, semicircular in outline; skin adherent to the rugose skull; snout shorter than the diameter of the orbit, not projecting beyond the mouth; canthus rostralis angular; loreal region vertical, concave; interorbital region nearly twice as broad as the upper eyelid; tympanum feebly distinct, three-fifths the diameter of the eye. Fingers rather elongate, slender, first extending a little beyond second. Foot much longer than the head; toes moderately long, slender, with a very short web at the base; no subarticular or metatarsal tubercles. The tibio-tarsal articulation reaches the shoulder. Skin perfectly smooth; a very small tubercle near the border of the upper eyelid, above the pupil. Back and upper surface of snout dark grey; posterior half of upper surface and sides of head blackish brown; a curved light streak, the concavity turned forwards, across the upper eyelids and the interorbital region, followed by a Y-shaped blackish marking; two light spots on the upper lip, below the eye; large blackish-brown partly confluent spots on the back; sides dark brown, light-edged above; limbs dark brown, with rather indistinct darker cross-bars; throat brown, belly brownish white.\"\n\n\"From snout to vent 65 millim.\"\n\n\"A female specimen, full of ripe eggs, 3 millim. in diameter, from Mount Kina Balu, 4,200 feet.\"\n\"Nearest allied to L. Feor, Blgr. Distinguished by the smaller head, the distinct tympanum, the longer digits, and the absence of a large horn-like tubercle on the upper eyelid.\"\n\nFISHES.\n\nOnly two freshwater fishes were obtained during the expedition, both from the Kadamaian River, Kina Balu, 2,150', viz: one specimen of the remarkable *Gastromyzon borneensis* (=*Lepidoglanis monticola*) with its flat sucker-like ventral surface, enabling the animal to live in the mountain torrents, like the tadpoles of *Rana curvitympanum* mentioned above; and many specimens of a new homalopteroid fish, named by Mr. Boulenger (2) *Glaniospis hanitschi*, n. g. and n. sp. He gives the following description of this fish:\n\n*Glaniospis*, gen. nov.\n\n\"Head and anterior part of body depressed; snout scarcely projecting beyond the mouth, which is moderately large; five pairs of barbels\u2014two in front of the snout, two at the angle of mouth, and one between the two nasal openings; gill-openings narrow.

The collection, however, contains, especially\namongst the Orthoptera, quite a number of species which, according to Dr. Sharp, are probably new, and their identification is unavoidably left for some future occasion.\n\nSome of the most remarkable Insects on Kina Balu, 4200', were certain forms which Dr. Sharp considers to be coleopterous larv\u00e6, probably of *Lycides*. They were constantly brought in by my men in handfuls, and I collected them myself on the ground, on rotten pieces of wood, and on low shrubs. These larv\u00e6 resemble in many points certain larv\u00e6 which I collected on Bukit Timah, Singapore, and on Maxwell's Hill, Perak, and which, according to Dr. Sharp, belong to another species of *Lycides*. It is apparently this form from the Malay Peninsula which is figured by C. J. Gahan, *Natural Science*, Vol. VII (1898), p. 43, in an article on the carboniferous *Dipeltis*. Since, however, Gahan's figure is not accompanied by a description and since, as far as I know, the larva from the Malay Peninsula has never been described, I have thought it advisable to give the following description of it.\n\nThe animal is remarkably flat and leaf-like, only a few parts of its body exceeding 1 mm. in thickness, the greatly expanded lateral portions of the thorax being even thinner. The head is very small, 1\u00b75 mm. across, and can be retracted within the cavity of the prothorax, and is always so in dead specimens. Eyes very small, black. Both maxillary and labial palps are cone-like structures, with four and three joints respectively, the basal joint in each being very much broader than the distal joint. Mandibles small. The antenn\u00e6 are very short club-shaped bodies, about 0\u00b768 mm. in length and 0\u00b75 mm. in greatest thickness. There is a chitinous ring round the narrow base, distally followed by a crown-like chitinous structure, consisting of a broad ring from which four lobes arise lying close round the 'club.' In the living specimen, the antenn\u00e6 often appear as if they themselves were retractile, but as at the slightest disturbance the entire head is withdrawn inside the tubular cavity of the prothorax, and the antenn\u00e6 are so very minute, nothing definite could be ascertained. The prothorax is somewhat triangular, about twice as broad as long; both mesothorax and metathorax are nearly three times as broad as long, and the posterior border of the metathorax is deeply concave. Of the abdomen, nine segments are visible ex-\nternally, and its length is only about that of prothorax and mesothorax together. The width of the first segment is two-fifths that of the metathorax, that of the last segment one-fifth. The prothorax bears dorsally two tubercles, about equidistant from the middle line and the side, and slightly nearer the posterior than the anterior margin. The mesothorax bears two pairs of tubercles, an anterior and a posterior, the posterior pair being situated near the centre of each half of the segment, and the anterior pair at equal distance from the posterior pair and the anterior margin of the segment, and nearer the middle line; the metathorax also has two pairs of tubercles, placed like those of the mesothorax. The first eight abdominal segments bear three pairs of spines each, viz. one pair of lateral ones (shown in Gahan's figure), and two pairs of ventral ones; the last segment has lateral spines only.\n\nColour: the thoracic tubercles are black, and the tips of the ventral spines are yellowish. The rest of the body is uniformly deep chestnut brown.\n\nSize: length of the largest Singapore specimen 41 mm.; of the largest Perak specimen 49 mm.; greatest width (metathorax): 21 mm. in both cases.\n\nHab: mountainous jungle of Singapore and Malay Peninsula. Rare.\n\nThe Kina Balu larva differs from this one (1) in the proportions of its dimensions, the thorax being narrower, and the abdomen longer and broader; (2) in the position of the thoracic tubercles, which are always placed in one row and close to the posterior margin of the segments; (3) in the presence of abdominal tubercles, viz., two in each of the first eight abdominal segments, also placed close to the posterior margin of the segments; (4) in the structure of the antennae, which, although of the same size and shape, and having also a narrow chitinous ring round their base, have the crown-like chitinous structure at their distal end divided, not into four, but into 12 narrow finger-like lobes; (5) its colour, being of a lighter chestnut brown, with an orange line along the sides of the thorax, the tubercles and feet also being orange. The number of thoracic tubercles and abdominal spines is, however, the same in the two species.\n\nNo luminosity was observed in either species, although I\nhad the one from the Malay Peninsula alive for several weeks, and was able to watch the Kina Balu one for several nights, as much of the material brought in had to be rejected and the larv\u00e6 were crawling about near our camp.\n\nA tabular statement of the chief points of difference may be useful:\n\n| Length: | Malay Peninsula form | Kina Balu form |\n|---------|----------------------|---------------|\n| total   | 49 mm.

March 1899). |\n\nNote: 'P' and 'S' refers to the largest specimens obtained in Perak and Singapore respectively.\n\nOn Kina Balu, 4200', I also found two specimens of another form which bore some superficial resemblance to the larv\u00e6 described above, but which I now consider to be adult females of some beetle, as they are luminous. Dr. Sharp (Cambridge Natural History, Vol. VI, p. 251) refers to a paper by Haase (Deutsche Ent. Zeitschrift, Vol. XXXII, 1888, pp. 145-167) where an extraordinary light-giving larva-like adult female beetle from South America is described (Phengodes hieronymi). The Kina Balu\nform has, however, except for its luminosity and absence of wings, little resemblance to the S. American form, and rather recalls an *Oniscus* in its oval shape and uniform segments, although its body is more elongate. Its head is small and black. Mouth appendages normal; mandibles long, thin, curved, and crossing each other in repose. Antenn\u00e6 with four joints each: length of first joint, 2 mm., of second 1 mm., of third 4 mm., of fourth 1 mm.; first and second joints and proximal half of third joint white, distal half of third joint black, fourth joint yellow and covered with set\u00e6. Eyes small (0\u00b75 mm. diameter), placed behind the base of the antenn\u00e6. The body is much depressed, with little difference between the segments of the thorax and abdomen. The larger of the two specimens captured is 60 mm. in length (prothorax 12, mesothorax 7, metathorax 6, abdomen 33 mm.), 18 mm. in greatest width (metathorax), 7 mm. in greatest thickness. The terga are slightly arched and entirely smooth; colour black, with a narrow white marginal border on the prothorax which is continued and widens posteriorly until, in the eighth abdominal segment, only a small black patch is left in the centre of its posterior margin. The last segment is small, 4 mm. across, and entirely black. The legs are black, with the exception of the tibiae; the first seven and the ninth sternum, the chitinous patches around the thoracic (prothorax and mesothorax) spiracles and those around the first seven abdominal ones are also black; the rest is white, viz., the eighth sternum, except for a black cross, the membranous portions between the sterna, the tibiae, and especially also the circular area around the eighth abdominal spiracle. In this oval white patch, measuring 3\u00b75 by 2 mm., the luminous organ is situated, and the light given off by it is of an extraordinary brilliancy. I had one of these larv\u00e6 alive for nearly a week, and enclosed in a glass-tube, it served me as a night light during the long sleepless nights on Kina Balu.\n\nDr. Sharp to whom I submitted this species for identification, marked it 'Larva of *Lampyrides*, unknown,' but on account of its luminosity I venture to regard it as an adult female, similar to the S. American form mentioned above. The absence of sufficient material for dissection, however, makes a final decision impossible.\n\nThe following is a list of the Orthoptera, Coleoptera and Rhynchota as identified by Dr. Sharp.\nORTHOPTERA.\n\nDiscotettix belzebuth, Kina Balu, 2,100'.\nMarmessoidea n. sp.

Whether it were not better treated as a local race of one of the above species, or all three as local forms of *P. dehaani*, is a question to be settled when the subject of the interrelationship of the various forms in the genus comes up for discussion.

Glaniopsis hanitschi.\nDammar and Wood Oil.\n\nBy H. N. Ridley.\n\nDammar is the resin exuded from various trees when wounded. The trees producing it belong chiefly to the order *Dipterocarpaceae*, and to the genera *Shorea*, *Hopea* and *Anisoptera*, but the Malays also class as Dammar resins derived from certain species of *Canarium*, and *Triomma* (*Burseraceae*) and *Calophyllum* (*Guttiferae*).\n\nThe resins are exuded from wounds in the trunk or branches, or sometimes a tree is hollow in the centre, and the space is filled or partly filled with the dammar, which thus forms a cast of the hole. At times it is exuded beneath the bark when it sets in the form of a plate or lamina, or it may drip slowly from a broken or cracked bough, so as to form stalactitic pipe-like masses on the injured part, and sometimes a stalagmitic mass on the ground below. The exudation does not commence immediately the wound is inflicted, and is produced very slowly, at first like turpentine, but soon setting into a hard crystalline mass. Even quite young trees, such as *shoreas*, produce the dammar when the stem or twigs are broken or bored by insects. The masses of dammar are not only modified in form by their method of production but also in colour and transparency. Many of the native and trade names have reference rather to the form and colour of the resin mass than to the tree from which it is derived. Thus Cat's-eye Dammar (*Dammar mata kuching*) is a transparent, pale, yellowish resin, usually in small pieces, and can be derived, I believe, from almost any of the Hopeas. *Dammar daging*, a dark brown, often handsomely marbled resin, often occurs in large masses showing the form of the hollow of the tree in which it was exuded. A very beautiful dammar of which I obtained a specimen from Johore was a clear sea green. It was found buried in the ground as is often the case, and there was no clue as to what tree produced it. When oxidised the resin becomes opaque.\nand yellowish white, and rather soft and powdery. Most of the dammar found in the ground in the forests is much oxidised outside, but the action goes on very slowly, and ground dammar in good condition can often be found in spots where for many years there has been no forest or dammar trees. Thus one can often find pieces of dammar in the ground on Blakang Mati where dammar trees have long ceased to exist. The greater part of the dammar collected by the Malays is thus found by digging in the ground where *shoreas* or other dammar trees have decayed. No attempt is made to extract it from trees as is the case in wood oil. The resin is used locally for making torches, and also for varnish, but the export trade in Singapore has very much declined of late years. Cat's-eye dammar and copal from Celebes are almost the only dammars now exported from Singapore, there being no demand for the less transparent varieties. The copal which occurs in large beautifully transparent yellow masses is derived from *Shorea selanica* Bl., and is not to be confused with the African and American Copals, which are derived from species of *Hymenaea* and *Trachylobium* (*Leguinnosae*).\n\n**Varieties of Dammar.**\n\nThe following is a list of the local names of dammars of the peninsula as far as I have been able to get them.\n\n*Damar Seraya Batu; Damar Seraya.* A hard opaque mass of a dull orange colour, probably derived from *Shorea leprosula* Miq. *Kapong Labu* is also from this tree.\n\n*Kapong Jalor.* A pipe-shaped mass, brown outside, inside yellow, centre dull olive brown.\n\n*Kapong Hantu.* Dark brownish colour mixed irregularly with yellow. Both of these are derived from *Shorea macroptera* Dyer, the tree known as Kepong, as perhaps are Kapong Sabut, Kapong S'lawang and Kapong Segan.\n\n*Meranti Bunga.* An amorphous mass nearly opaque of a whitish olive yellow mixed with greenish brown and weathering yellow.\n\n*Meranti Sarang punai; Meranti Tembaga, Meranti Sama, Meranti Ketapa* are probably derived from *Shorea*.\n\n*Meranti Batu,* a dark brown weathering orange. This is very similar to the Damar Daging of the Malays, which occurs\nin large masses in the ground, evidently originally exuded into the hollow of a tree and perhaps taking its brown colour from this method of production.\n\n*Damur Mata Kuching.* Cat's-eye dammar appears as pale yellow or nearly white, quite transparent, glassy tears. It is the most valued of the local kinds. A number of trees are said to produce this Dammar, among them *Hopea globosa* Brandis, *Hopea intermedia*, King, and *H. micrantha* Hook. f. (Trans. Linn. Soc. XXIII. 160) also *Pachymocarpus Wallichii*.\n\n*Damar Rambei Daun.* A transparent yellow Dammar, browner in the middle, occurs in a stalactitic form, and is produced by *Shorea acuminata* Dyer.\n\n*Damar Chingal* is from *Shorea bracteolata*, Dyer.\n\n*Merawan Jangkar*, *Merawan jalor*, *Merawan Kunyit* are doubtless produced by species of *Hopea*.\n\n*Damar Mersawa hitam*, by *Anisoptera glabra*, Kurz.\n\n*Damar Mersawa putih* probably by *A. costata*, Korth.\n\nThe seagreen dammar from Johor I have already described. Another unidentified kind I have met with, had been exuded from the stump of a large tree which had been felled in the Carimon islands. It formed an opaque bright yellow mass of the appearance of bee's wax. I was informed that the tree was a Keruing (*Dipterocarpus*), but I could not verify this.\n\nBesides the Dipterocarpus resins, there are some kinds which belong to very different classes of trees, and are roughly classed as Dammars by the Malays. Among these there are several from the genera *Canarium*, *Santiria* and *Triomma*, (*Burseraceae*). The most interesting is the Kedondong Kijai from *Triomma Malaccensis*, Griff. This resin seems to set with difficulty being more of the consistency of turpentine. It is dark grey or black turning yellowish grey or opaque white with a very pleasant aromatic scent. Other resins obtained from plants of the same order are *Damur Kedondong Krut* (*Santiria* sp.) and *Kedondong Mata hari* from *Trigonochlamys Griffithii* Hook. fil. Sayang from *Santiria laxa*, King. *Damur Kijai* a resin valued by the Malays, is said to be produced by *Canarium secundum* Benn.\n\nOther resins sometimes classed as Dammars by the Malays are those exuded from wounds in various species of *Calophyllum*; *Bintangor bunga* and *Bintangor batu*, (*C. pulcherrimum*) which\nproduces a soft resin very sticky, of a bottle green colour when thin, and black when in mass.\n\n*Damar minyak* is the name given to the turpentine of the large Conifer *Damara Orientalis*, which grows in the hill ranges of Penang, Perak, etc. This tree abounds in the turpentine, which is very liquid. I have seen it poured out in large quantities from cut roots of a big tree on the Thaiping hills. Cooke states that it was sold to varnish makers under the name of East India Dammar, and that it is much esteemed by natives for incense.\n\n*Kelulut Damar.* This is a black or more rarely grey Dammar obtained from the nest of the little stingless bees known as *Trigona*. There are several species here which make dammar nests. The commonest appears to be *T. laeviceps*, a small black kind; there is also a light brown kind, and a very small black species which frequently nests under the planks in houses. In the case of *T. laeviceps*, the nest is built in a hollow tree at the entrance to which the bees build a trumpet shaped or flattened tube projecting for six inches or more from the tree. From one nest I obtained a very large cylindrical tube a foot long ending in a flat spoon shaped portion. These tubes are made of a sticky resin, too adhesive for any insect except a Trigona to walk over, so that enemies cannot invade the nest. The nest itself consists of an irregular mass of dammar, in which are placed the detached elliptic cells, in which is often a good deal of black honey. The mass of dammar in old nests is often very large and must represent a vast amount of work on the part of these little bees. Both the dammar and honey are sought by Malays, and used as medicine and the resin also for torches, etc. The tube at the entrance pounded up is rubbed over the body in cases of rheumatism. The presence of a Kelulut\u2019s nest in a tree is not necessarily injurious to the tree. Very large nests may occur in trees for many years without causing any appreciable injury. On the other hand it is very probable that they prevent further decay by sealing up the injured wood in dammar, and by preventing termites from effecting a lodgment in the tree. One species of Kelulut makes its nest in that of one of the termites underground usually at the foot of a large tree. There appears to have been some question as to what tree the Kelulut obtained its dammar from, as it has long been noticed (Cook\u2019s Gums and Resins) that\nit was very different from any known kind of resins. The fact is that it is a mixture of all kinds of resins, indeed any resinous substance that the bees can get is collected. They quickly find any wounded resinous tree and gather as much as they can. I have seen them at work at Shoreas (*S. parvifolia*), *Garcinia*, *Calophyllum*, *Triomma* and *Angsana* (*Pterocarpus indicus*).\n\n**Wood Oil.**\n\nThe trees of the genus *Dipterocarpus* do not, like the allied Shoreas, produce dammar but they produce instead, wood oil, or Gurjun oil, as it is commonly called, the Minyak Keruing of the Malays. The *Dipterocarpi* are trees of gigantic size, with large pink or white sweet scented flowers and globose or four or five angled or winged fruits with a pair of long oblong wings as much as nine inches long in *D. grandiflorus* Blanco. The oil is obtained by cutting deep holes into the stem of the tree with an axe or chisel about six inches square, the top of the hole sloping inwards, and the floor excavated to hold the oil. A fire is then made in the hole so as to char the sides and top, after which the oil is exuded in considerable quantities, and collected in kerosine tins. When the oil ceases to flow, it is usual to burn the wound again, when it recommences.\n\nThis operation does not necessarily injure the tree to any extent unless it is done to excess, but natives often cut so many holes in a tree that it dies and many trees have been thus killed. As the oil-trees are usually very isolated in the forests and never occur in any great number together a very large extent of forest is required to supply a comparatively small amount of oil, and the supply is now so scanty that the natives seldom go to seek it, and the oil has nearly disappeared out of commerce.\n\nThe oil is used for varnish either alone or mixed with other substances, or for caulking boats and such purposes but it is also used to a small extent in medicine under the name of Gurjun balsam, as a substitute for a Copaiba, and it is also stated to be valuable used externally and internally in leprosy. When allowed to stand the oil separates into a clear or dark liquid known as Chaier by the Malays and thick semi-solid resin, Beku.\n\nThe chief trees producing oil here, are, *Dipterocarpus grandiflorus*, Blanco. *Minyak Keruing Dadeh*; *Minyak Gombang Kechil*.\nThe oil soon sets into a stiff light brown resin, leaving very little of the liquid (Chaier). It is used for varnish either when fresh before it has time to set or mixed with other more liquid oils.\n\n*D. Kerrii*, King. *Minyak Keruing Chaier*. The oil is rather thin and watery of a yellow colour, and the resin is yellowish white.\n\n*D. Hasselti* Bl. *Minyak Keruing Sudi*. The oil is of a deep brown colour, red by transmitted light with a rather stiff brown resin deposit. One of the best oil trees; it is not rare to find fruits of this in which the pericarp contains nothing but a clear transparent oil.\n\n*D. crinitus*, Dyer. *Minyak Keruing Bulu*. This oil is considered a good kind and used for mixing with the thicker oils. The tree is commonly known as Gombang.\n\n*Minyak Pekat, Minyak Merah* and *Minyak Babi* are as yet unidentified.\n\n*D. ineanus* Roxb. and *D. alatus* Roxb. occur in Siam and supply the greater part of the Siamese Wood Oils of commerce. They will probably be found in the north of the peninsula as they are found quite in the south of Siam. Siamese wood oil (probably from *D. alatus*) is very dark in colour nearly black by reflected light but yellow by transmitted light; the resin whitish. The greater part of the Wood Oils of Commerce are now exported from Rangoon, and are derived from the forests of Burmah. The trees producing them are all species of *Dipterocarpus* but all or nearly all distinct from those of the Malay Peninsula. A full account of them is to be found in Watt\u2019s Dictionary of the Economic Plants of India.\nNotes on the Flying Frog\n\nRhacophorus nigropalmatus.\n\nBy R. Hanitsch, Ph.D.\n\nMr. A. D. Machado, one of the most constant benefactors to the Raffles Museum, presented last year a specimen of a Flying Frog from Pahang which I have only recently been able to identify as *Rhacophorus nigropalmatus*. As only two specimens of this species have so far been recorded, the one obtained by Dr. Charles Hose from the Akan River, Borneo (see G. A. Boulenger, A. M. N. H. (6), XVI, p. 170), and the other obtained by Mr. L. Wray in the Piah Valley, Upper Perak (see S. S. Flower, P. Z. S., 1899, p. 899), this third specimen appears to deserve a special note.\n\nMr. Machado writes: \"I caught this specimen in an old prospecting pit one morning (January 1899) at Kuala Merbao in Ulu Pahang. He had evidently fallen into it and could not get out. I found him swimming about in the water. The pit was about twelve feet deep.\"\n\nThe specimen shows in external characters no difference from those described by Boulenger and Flower, except slightly as regards its cutaneous fringes and coloration. The fringes of the arm seem to be more developed than in either of the other two specimens: there is one not only along the outer edge of the fore-arm continued right to the tip of the fifth finger, but also a smaller triangular one along the inner side, beginning at the proximal end of the upper arm and ending at the distal end of the fore-arm, being widest at the elbow joint. There is a semilunar flap on the tibio-tarsal articulation, as in the other specimens, and, after a break, a narrow fringe along the outer side of the tarsus to the tip of the fifth toe. A very much smaller fringe runs along the first toe. A flap of skin above the cloaca is scarcely noticeable.\nWhen alive, the colour was a bright green above, but now, in spirit, a dark slate-grey with a purplish hue, with numerous minute white dots, isolated or in groups. There are five very conspicuous white spots on the upper surface of the thigh, one of them close to its origin, the other four a little lower down, arranged in a square. The flanks are whitish, veined with black, as in the Bornean specimen, the lower surface is a yellowish white. The enormous interdigital membranes are black near their base, but yellowish towards the edges, with yellow rays going into the black portion.\n\nThe specimen is male, its testes being very large, 15 mm. in length. The Bornean specimen was female, whilst there is no record of the sex of the Perak specimen.\n\nIts length from snout to vent is 84 mm., against 80 mm. in the case of the Bornean and 98 mm. in the Perak specimen.\n\nThe Flying Frog of which Wallace (Malay Archipelago, 10th edition, p.30) gives such a graphic description, is *Rhacophorus pardalis* and occurs in Borneo and the Philippines, whilst a third Malayan species, *Rh. reinwardtii*, occurs in Java and Sumatra. Very similar species are found in Malabar (*Rh. malabarius*), the Eastern Himalayan region (*Rh. bimaculatus*) and Madagascar (*Rh. madagascariensis*).\n\n---\n\n**Some New Eastern Gingers.**\n\nThe following new species of *Scitamineae* have passed through my hands since writing the paper published in Journal No. 32 and do not appear to be described in Schumann's paper. *Alpinia pectinata* n. sp. Plant 4 to 7 feet tall. Leaves oblong-lanceolate glabrous thinly coriaceous, blade 20 inches long 4 inches wide with a thick keel, ocrea obtuse. Panicle pendulous secund, with a long thick peduncle, dense with short crowded branches. Bracts many obconic half an inch long papery brown. Flowers pedicelled, pedicels in fruit: $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Capsule globose trilocular $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Seeds very numerous.\n\nCelebes at Gunong Klabat 1300 to 1600 metres elevation, fruiting in January.\n\nA remarkable plant in its one sided panicle with very short branches bearing heads crowded together, about 100 in a panicle.\nThe bracts which are ribbed and pubescent, resemble those of *Alpinia involucrata* on a small scale. The specimens are all in fruit. There are two undescribed species belonging to this section in Schumann's paper from Celebes.\n\n*A (Hellenia) Celebica* n. sp. A herb more than 18 inches tall with glabrous very long pointed lanceolate leaves, 8 inches long $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide, petiole terete striolate graceful one inch long ocrea oblong truncate. Panicle graceful erect branches short many flowered five inches long. Bracts caducous. Flowers $1\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Calyx tubular truncate $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Corolla tube twice as long; lobes oblong obtuse $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Lip narrow shorter than the corolla, deeply bifid, lobes spatulate emarginate. Staminodes narrow subulate. Stamen with a rather long filament, another oblong not crested. Style graceful.\n\nCelebes.\n\nAllied to *A Fraseriana* of Borneo, but remarkable for its very deeply cleft lip.\n\n*Amomum terminalis* n. sp. Stems crowded slender about 2 feet tall, or much taller $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch through. Leaves dark green, elliptic lanceolate acuminate thinly coriaceous pale beneath glabrous 7 inches long, 2 inches wide, petiole very short, ocrea $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch long rounded. Spike terminal or basal cylindric 4 inches long $\\frac{3}{8}$ inch through. Bracts ovate obtuse margins hairy $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch wide red. Bracteole $\\frac{1}{4}$ inch long oblong obtuse pink. Flowers in pairs. Calyx tubular dilated upwards trifid pink $\\frac{3}{4}$ inch long. Corolla tube one inch long slender white, lobes lanceolate acute $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Lip three lobed, two lateral lobes shorter curved outwards, acute, median obovate obscurely lobed, $\\frac{1}{2}$ inch long. Anther with a broad connective rounded crenulate.\n\nBismarck Archipelago (Micholitz.) Flowered in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, Feb. 1900.\n\nThe habit of this plant and its red bracts cause it to resemble some species of *Zingiber*, but it has not the long anther beak of that genus. It is abnormal among *Amomums* in having the spike terminal, but it also is said to produce basal spikes from the rhizome. It is indeed difficult to refer it to any genus but I am unwilling to make a distinct genus for it alone. In some respects it may be classed with an ornamental plant known as *Costus*.\nZebrinus of gardens, which however has no relationship with the genus Costus at all.\n\n*Tapeinocheilus Koordersiana* n. sp. A tall plant, 25 feet tall. Leaves broadly oblong nearly four feet long 8 inches wide, subcoriaceous pubescent or glabrous narrowed at the base. Spike subcylindric 8 inches long, 4 inches wide. Bracts stiff coriaceous not woody oblong or ovate cuspidate ribbed pubescent the larger ones $2\\frac{1}{2}$ inches long and one inch wide, the inner ones lanceate cuspidate pubescent longer. Bracteoles linear narrowed acute shorter than the flowers. Calyx tube one inch long narrow little enlarged above, lobes lanceolate acute quite covered with silky hairs. Corolla tube hairy but little longer, lobes narrow acute. Lip oblong rounded hairy. Anther oblong hairy. Capsule an inch long obovate warted covered with brown wool.\n\nCelebes.\n\nAnother species of this grand Eastern island genus, allied to Miquel\u2019s *T. pungens* but with larger flowers and pubescent bracts. I have great pleasure in associating it with the name of Dr. Koorders, who made such fine collections of plants in Celebes recently.\n\n---\n\nThe Birds of the Larut Hills.\n\nTwo birds mentioned, but not named, in my paper on the Birds of the Larut Hills have been identified for me by Dr. Hartert.\n\nThey are:\n\n*Aethopyga temminckii*, Temminck\u2019s Honeysucker. The second species of scarlet honeysucker mentioned on p. 21.\n\n*Notodela leucura*. The White-tailed Blue Robin, a female. The \u201csmall robin-like brown bird\u201d alluded to at the foot of p. 30.\n\nA. L. Butler.\n\n---\n\nBotanical Notes.\n\n*Malayan Gingers*. Dr. K. Schumann has published this year in Engler\u2019s Jahrbuch Vol. 27, a monograph of the *Scitamineae* collected in the various islands of the archipelago, by Beccari, in Sarawak, Sumatra and New Guinea, by the brothers Sarasin in\nCelebes, and by Warburg, Hollrung and others in New Guinea. In his arrangement he adheres to the old classification including *Hornstedtia*, *Plagiostachys*, etc., under *Amomum*, and so on. One new genus he describes under the name *Haplochorema* seems to be a true *Koempferia* with creeping rhizomes. It occurs in Borneo, four kinds being described from Sarawak. One might describe it as a Koempferia adapted for jungle life. *Hedychium microchilum* described from Java in my paper in the last Journal, appears as *Brachychilus Horsfieldii* Peters. It was originally described under the name of *Hedychium Horsfieldii* in Hooker's Kew Miscellany, and also by Peters in a Copenhagen Botanical Journal, both works difficult to procure. The whole habit of the plant is so much that of *Hedychium*, that I think it would be better to keep it in that genus. A good figure of what is evidently the common *Costus globosus* Bl is given under the name of *C. acanthocephalus* n. sp. It was collected in West Sumatra by Beccari. The plant is evidently widely distributed. The whole monograph is interesting from a geographical point of view, for though of course one may be sure that many more of these plants will be found in the Eastern islands, it gives sufficiently clear evidence of the change in the flora as we go further east. Thus one notices that the *Globbas*, so abundant here, disappear to a large extent, few occurring in Borneo, fewer in Java, and only one (excluding *G. marantina* probably introduced) further east in the Philippines. *Gastrochilus*, except the cultivated *G. panduratus*, does not occur in the list; but probably this is due to the difficulty of getting the flowers in wild plants. *Zingiber* also disappears rapidly towards the East, but one kind has been met with in New Guinea. *Tepeinocheilus* appears to be abundant in the Papuan region, fourteen species of these grand plants being catalogued, extending from Amboina to New Guinea.\n\n*Alpinia rosella* Ridl. Since publishing this species (Journal 32. p. 164) I have found a figure and description of a plant collected in British North Borneo by Burbidge and published under the name *Alpinia Fraseriana* Oliver, in the Icones Plantarum vol. vi. pl. 1567, which agrees closely with *A. rosella*, and is I think the same species. I also note some misprints in my description on p. 165, in line 2 *absent* should be *about*, and in line 10 the words should run \"Seeds 3 about $\\frac{1}{8}$ inch through.\"\nSusu Rimau. In Journal No. 22, on page 340, I gave some account of the curious vegetable product known to the Malays as Susu Rimau, the sclerotium or resting stage of some species of *Polyporus*. I have since obtained other fine specimens of the tuber and the fully developed fungus attached in Singapore and Penang, and Mr. Massee, of Kew, has identified it as *Polyporus sacer*, a very widely distributed fungus.\n\n---\n\nA Pulau Tiuman Superstition.\n\nI visited the Pahang island of Tiuman in 1898 and stumbled across a superstition which did not impress me very much at the time, though it was recalled to my memory by hearing later of an almost identical belief concerning a hill in upper Siam.\n\nShortly after going ashore at the island the headman requested me to prevent my Chinese cook bringing any vinegar off the boat; he informed me that if by any chance the vinegar should be spilt, the island would be convulsed and a terrible storm result. On an occasion a few years previously the cook of an European prospector at work on the island had by a similar accident raised such a typhoon that, to quote my informant \"the sea was invisible for five days.\"\n\nThis superstition is evidently connected with the widespread belief that no dragon can face vinegar, for it was told me in the village under the peculiar double spur of hill at the extreme south of the island called \"Chula Naga\" (Dragon's Horns), and it has peculiar application in this instance, though dragons are accredited to several other mountains on the peninsula.\n\nW.
