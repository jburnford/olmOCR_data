Resolved,\u2014That the Annual General Meeting be held on such date as may be fixed by His Lordship the President.\n\n7. Laid on the table a Paper by the late Mr. Israel Homer Vannia Sinkam on \u201cThe Snakes of Ceylon.\u201d\nResolved,\u2014To refer the Paper to the President and Mr. R\u00e1man\u00e1than for their opinions.\n\n8. Read a letter from Government with reference to the vote of Rs. 200 given for the preservation of the Dutch Records, and laid on the table connected correspondence:\u2014\n\nNo. 140. Colombo, November 10, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014With reference to the letters addressed to you on behalf of the Society, under date February 7, 1888 (quoted in the Proceedings of the Society for 1887-88 at page 110, copy of which is enclosed), September 22, 1888, and October 28, 1889, I have the honour to request that instructions may be issued that the balance of the vote to the Colombo Museum for the preservation and translation of Dutch Records may be paid over to the Honorary Treasurer of this Society, in order that the amount (\u00a312. 0s. 3d.) due by the Society for translation into English of Dutch Records relating to Ceylon may be settled, and particulars of expenditure furnished.\n\n(2) In this connection the Council begs to remind the Government that the Sub-Committee of the Legislative Council appointed to consider the Supply Bill of 1891, in their report (Sessional Paper LXIII. of 1890) wrote that they \u201cwillingly recommend the very modest provision for the preservation and translation of Dutch Records.\u201d\n(3) The task before us of translating the remainder of the more interesting portions of the Dutch Records is a formidable one, but promises to be fruitful of most valuable results, in throwing much light upon the history and administration during the Dutch occupation from 1640 to 1795.\n\n(4) In view of the importance and urgency of the work of translating and publishing these records and thus making their contents practically available, the Council trusts, that as the Estimates for 1893 are now under consideration, the present small vote of Rs. 200 for the preservation and translation of Dutch Records may be increased.\n\n(5) Of the amount voted to the Museum under the sub-head in 1891, only Rs. 146\u00b725 was spent, but this year nearly the whole vote will be exhausted, and next year it is hoped that the work may be energetically carried on, so that a larger sum than Rs. 200 can be profitably employed upon it.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nH. C. P. Bell,\nHonorary Secretary.\n\nTo the Hon. the Colonial Secretary.\n\nColombo, December 13, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014With reference to your letter No. 140 of the 10th ultimo, relative to the vote of Rs. 200 for preservation and translation of Dutch Records, I am directed to inform you that the money voted in previous years is not available now.\n\n(2) I am to add that it was not intended to vote this amount annually for the object in question, and as there appeared to be no necessity for including this item in the estimates of expenditure for next year, it was omitted.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nH. L. Crawford,\nfor Colonial Secretary\n\nThe Hon. Secretary, Ceylon Branch,\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\n9. Laid on the table correspondence with the Archaeological Commissioner re the balance of the Excavation Fund.*\n\nResolved,\u2014That the final decision of the question be deferred pending reference to the Lord Bishop.\n\n* For correspondence see pp. 12 to 17.\nANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum Library, Tuesday, February 14, 1893.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\n\nMr. F. H. M. Corbet. Dr. Lisboa Pinto.\nMr. Staniforth Green. Mr. F. C. Roles.\nMr. J. A. Henderson. Dr. W. G. Vandort.\nMr. E. F. Hopkins, c.c.s.\n\nMr. G. A. Joseph, Acting Honorary Secretary.\n\nVisitors:\u2014Six gentlemen.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. At the request of the President, Mr. Joseph acted as Secretary.\n2. Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on November 4, 1892.\n3. It was announced that the following gentlemen had been elected Resident Members:\u2014Messrs. G. A. Joseph, J. Harward, and N. Mendis, Mudaliyar.\n4. Mr. Joseph read the following Annual Report of the Council for 1892:\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1892.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to submit to this Meeting their Annual Report for the year 1892.\n\nMeetings and Papers.\n\nThere were four General Meetings of the Society held during the year, and five Papers read. The first Meeting, which was the Annual General Meeting of the year, was held on the 19th of March last. After the Annual Report had been read and adopted and the Office-Bearers for the year elected, the President of the Society, the Lord Bishop of Colombo, reviving a much appreciated practice, delivered an address on \"The Verification of the Ancient Chronicles and Histories of Ceylon.\" The President was followed by Mr. F. Modder with a Paper \"On Siphalese Weights and Measures.\"\n\nThe second Meeting was held on the 9th of August, when three Papers were read, one by the Lord Bishop of Colombo on \"The Identification of Sirivaddhanapura of the Mah\u0101vanssa, chapter LXXXV.\"; another on \"Ritigala\" in the North-Central Province, contributed by Mr. J. B. M. Ridout; and the third by Mr. F. Lewis, entitled \"Notes on the Nidification of Chrysophlegma Xanthoderus\" (yellow naped woodpecker).\n\nThe third Meeting was held on the 10th of October last, when a Paper contributed by Mr. L. Nell on \"The Ethnology of Ceylon\" was read. This Paper gave rise to much discussion, and it was thought advisable to adjourn the Meeting for another day to permit Members who wished to continue the discussion an opportunity of so doing.\n\nThe Meeting was accordingly postponed to the 4th of November, when a prolonged discussion took place.\nMembers.\n\nThe Society now counts on its roll 6 Honorary Members, 15 Life Members, and 234 Ordinary Members, making in all a total of 253 Members.\n\nThere have been elected since the last Annual Meeting 11 Resident Members, viz.:\u2014Messrs. R. W. Lee, c.m.g., H. P. Perera, J. W. F. Gore, A. H. Monaresinghe, R. O. S. Morgan, Moonasinghe, T. B. Yatawara, K. A. J. Pohath, Mudianse, J. A. Henderson, J. A. Casinader, and the Hon. J. A. Swettenham, c.m.g.\n\nThe following Members have resigned during the year:\u2014Mr. M. S. Crawford, Dr. MacDonald, Messrs. G. D. Miller, A. G. Perman, W. R. B. Sanders, G. J. A. Skeen, J. F. Tillekeratne, Mudaliy\u00e1r, W. van Langenberg, and W. H. Wright.\n\nThe Council have with regret to record the death of four of the Members of the Society since the last Annual General Meeting, viz.:\u2014The Hon. Sir J. S. Grenier, Messrs. A. M. Ferguson, c.m.g., H. Pedro Perera, and T. M. Twigg, c.c.s.\n\nIn Sir Samuel Grenier, Attorney-General, the Island has lost a public man of the utmost integrity and uprightness, whose place it will be difficult to fill. Sir Samuel joined the Society in 1866; but his onerous professional and official duties prevented his taking an active part in our work.\n\nBy the death of Mr. A. M. Ferguson, c.m.g., this Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society has been deprived of one of its oldest and most valued Members, and the Island in general has lost one of the best informed of its colonists: a man of prodigious memory and encyclopaedic information, who had an intimate acquaintance with the people and the country. Mr. Ferguson was a Member of the Council for many years. In addition to the many other services rendered to the Society, he contributed an interesting Paper to the Society\u2019s Proceedings of 1885, entitled \u201cPlumbago with special reference to the position occupied by the Mineral in the Commerce of Ceylon, and the Question discussed of the alleged existence in the Island of the allied substance, Anthracite.\u201d Mr. Ferguson also, at a conversazione held under the auspices of this Society in 1887, delivered an address on the \u201cPearl Fishery, Tank Regions, and Buried Cities of Ceylon.\u201d\n\nThe following is a list of his principal writings, taken from \u201cWriters on Ceylon\u201d:\n\nFerguson, A. M., c.m.g.\u2014Co-editor of the Colombo Observer, 1846; editor and proprietor, 1859. Suggested starting of Overland Observer (monthly), 1840; afterwards made fortnightly in 1853 and weekly in 1875.

Mr. Panabokke and Mr. H. H. Cameron, having been, by virtue of rule 16, deemed to have retired by least attendance, the vacancies caused by their retirement were filled by the appointment of Drs. Kynsey and Vandort. Dr. Trimen and Mr. Ramanathan who, under the same rule, vacated their places by reason of seniority, were re-elected. The Hon. J. A. Swettenham was elected a Vice-President of the Society in place of Mr. T. Berwick. Mr. W.H.G. Duncan having resigned his appointment of Honorary Treasurer in consequence of his contemplated absence from the Island, the Council resolved to offer the post, pending confirmation at the next General Meeting, to Mr. F. H. M. Corbet, who has accepted it.\n\n**Publications.**\n\nJournal Vol. XI., No. 39, 1889, was issued from the press.

It is the first number of the Society's Journals issued in pursuance of the new system, viz., the amalgamation of the Journals and Proceedings. It contains the following Papers:\u2014(a) \"A History of the Ancient Industries of Ceylon\" (Third Paper), by Mr. G. Wall, F.L.S., F.R.A.S.

(h) \"A Contribution to Siphalese Plant Lore,\" by Mr. W. A. de Silva.\nAll Papers read before the Society last year were printed before being read, and proofs were issued to Members likely to interest themselves in the subjects dealt with, or to take part in the discussion.\n\nA list of Members up to date (with their addresses) is in the Press.\n\nThe Proceedings for 1889\u201390 have been compiled and are ready in manuscript.\n\nSince the year 1891 the following arrears have been caught up, viz.:\u2014Journals Vol. XI., No. 38, 1889; Vol. XI., No. 39, 1889, and Proceedings, 1887\u20138. The numbers of the Journal which remain to be issued are Vol. XII., Nos. 40 and 41, of 1890, and the Proceedings of 1889\u201390. These will be taken up as soon as the Government Printer has leisure. He was unable to attend to this last year owing to heavy official demands on the Government Printing Press.\n\nThe Journal for last year, Vol. XII., 1892, No. 43, will be issued to Members shortly.\n\nThe Society has to acknowledge its obligations to the Government Printer and his Assistants for their courteous attention and readiness to help the Society in the printing of its publications.\n\nInternational Congress of Orientalists.\n\nProfessor T. W. Rhys Davids was appointed (on the authority of the Council) to represent the Society at the Ninth International Congress of Orientalists held in London in September last.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe number of volumes (including separate parts of periodicals) added to the Society\u2019s Library since the commencement of 1892 amounts up to the end of the year to 250. Many of the books have been presented to the Society, and several others obtained in exchange for the Society\u2019s publications. The names of the following donors amongst others may be mentioned:\u2014The Secretary of State in Council for India; the Bureau of Education, United States, America; the Ceylon Government; the Trustees of the Indian Museum; the British Association for the Advancement of Science; the Trustees of the British Museum; the Committee of the North-West Provinces and Oudh Provincial Museum, Lucknow; Dr. Adolph Bastian; the Director of Public Instruction; and the Hamilton Association.\n\nCataloguing.\n\nA Catalogue of the Society\u2019s Library has not yet been printed. One was begun as part of a Catalogue intended to embrace the two collections of books in the Museum, that belonging to the Society and the other to the Government, which were amalgamated for the purpose. As, however, the collections were separated in 1891, and as a fresh Catalogue of the Government Library has been commenced, the Catalogue of the Society\u2019s books should now be published independently. The manuscript list is practically complete, and all that remains to be done is to finally revise the arrangement of the \u201cslips\u201d already written, to add the names of the books received since the date at which the preparation of the Catalogue stopped, and to pass the work through the press. The compilers deserve the thanks of the Society for their efforts to bring out a Catalogue of the\nSociety's Library. As the bulk of the work has already been done by Messrs. F. H. M. Corbet and D. M. de Zilva Wickremasinghe, it seems not unreasonable to hope that some Member of the Society will come forward, as Messrs. H. C. P. Bell and W. E. Davidson did in 1882, and by seeing through the press a new Catalogue of the Library, ensure its being more widely availed of in aiding the researches and studies which the Society was established to promote.\n\nArchaeology.\n\nOwing to pressure of work in the Surveyor-General's Office it has been found impossible to issue the requisite drawings for the Progress Reports of the Archaeological Commissioner on his work at Anur\u00e1dhapura during the past year and a half. This is greatly to be regretted, but seems unavoidable under present circumstances.\n\nDuring the year has appeared, however, a full and elaborate Report by Mr. H. C. P. Bell on the K\u00e9galla District, the first scene of the Archaeological Survey's labour.\n\nAt Anur\u00e1dhapura, in the North-Central Province, the survey has been prosecuted with all the vigour possible, with a limited vote and a labour force not exceeding 100 hands. The fine Monastery (or Nunnery) at Pankuliya (three miles north of the B\u00f3-tree on the left bank of the Malwatu-oya) has been systematically and thoroughly excavated. The solitary so-called Kiribat Vehera (d\u00e1gaba), a mile north-west of Pankuliya, and half a mile north of the Vijay\u00e1r\u00e1ma ruins, has been attacked, and one quadrant of its periphery laid bare. The identification of this d\u00e1gaba should greatly aid towards fixing the position of other ruins in the ancient city.\n\nOther ruined buildings nearer the town have been dug up, and have yielded interesting archaeological \"finds.\"\n\nRound Abhayagiri D\u00e1gaba, at the group of the ruined monasteries, excavations have extended along the southern and western faces of the d\u00e1gaba, and have exposed to view more than one building of great interest\u2014notably a large pilima-g\u00e9 (image house), with massive walls of the Polannaruwa type.\n\nMore of the ancient roads have been followed out, and surveyed, and plotted together, with the whole extensive range of ruins near J\u00e9tavanar\u00e1ma D\u00e1gaba.\n\nVast as was the ancient city, there is every reason to hope that it is gradually being made to give up its plan to steady and intelligent investigation, and thus more than justifying the continuance of the Archaeological Survey.\n\nTwo circuits were also carried out, as last year, in the course of 1892 through a portion of the North-Central Province, and several unknown inscriptions and ruined sites discovered.\n\nProspects for 1893.\n\nThe following Papers have been received:\n\n(1) Kurun\u00e9gala Vistaraya; with Notes on Kurun\u00e9gala, Ancient and Modern, by Mr. Frank Modder.\n\n(2) Chelappadikaram, by the Hon. P. Coomaraswamy.\n\n(3) Notes on the Nidification of Sturnornis Senex and Cissa Ornata, by Mr. Frederick Lewis.\n\n(4) On the Isles of Jaffna, by Mr. T. K\u00e1sipillai, F.R.H.S.\nFinances.\n\nThe annexed statement of the receipts and expenditure of the Society for the year shows a credit balance of Rs. 274\u00b746 brought forward from 1891, and an income of Rs. 2,705 in 1892, making a total credit of Rs. 2,979\u00b746, which is Rs. 342\u00b763 more than last year.\n\nThe amount expended in the purchase of books was Rs. 37 only, as against Rs. 740\u00b786 in 1891, and on printing Rs. 431\u00b706, as against Rs. 732\u00b796. The amount received from Members by subscription was Rs. 2,147\u00b725, as against Rs. 1,254\u00b775 in 1891.\n\nThe amount spent on charges account was only Rs. 468\u00b784, as against Rs. 878\u00b755 in 1891, a difference of Rs. 409\u00b771.\n\nThe Society is in debt; but the amount to its credit in the Bank and the arrears of subscription still to be collected will cover this indebtedness.\n\nGeneral Account for 1892.\n\nThe Honorary Treasurer in account with the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch).\n\n| Dr. | 1892. | Cr. |\n|-----|-------|-----|\n| Balance in Bank of Madras brought forward | Rs. c. | Rs. c. |\n| Members' Subscriptions | 274 46 | Purchase of Books... | 37 0 |\n| Government Grant | 500 0 | Printing | 431 6 |\n| Entrance Fees | 57 75 | Charges Account | 468 84 |\n| Total | 2,979 46 | Balance in Bank of Madras | 1,540 17 |\n| Do.

The following Office-Bearers for 1892, nominated by the Council, were duly elected on a motion proposed by Mr. F. H. M. Corbet and seconded by Dr. Lisboa Pinto, viz.:\n\nPresident.\u2014The Right Rev. R. S. Copleston, d.d., Lord Bishop of Colombo.\n\nVice-Presidents.\u2014Mr. G. Wall, f.l.s., f.r.a.s.; the Hon. J. A.

The Chairman said that on behalf of those returned to office he begged to thank the Members for electing them, and he desired to take that opportunity of apologising for the very formal nature of that evening's proceedings. He was afraid it had been due in part to his absence from Ceylon. Had he been in the Island a little more during the past month he would certainly have tried personally to provide something more interesting.\n\nIt would be the duty and aim of the Council to provide during the coming year as many Meetings of interest as the Members, by contributing Papers, should enable it to supply, and they would be glad to know that there were already in the hands of the Council some Papers which would enable it, in part at any rate, to attain that object.\n\n7. The Proceedings terminated with a vote of thanks to the Chairman, moved by Mr. F. C. Roles.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, March 28, 1893.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President,\nin the Chair.\n\nMr. P. Freudenberg. | Mr. F. C. Roles.\nMr. P.

The following gentleman was elected a Resident Member, viz.:\u2014Mr. E. Booth.\n\nProposed by Mr. W. C. Macready\nSeconded by Mr. F. Lewis\n\n3. Laid on the table a (printed) Paper by Mr. F. Modder, entitled \"Kurun\u00e9gala Vistaraya; with Notes on Kurun\u00e9gala, Ancient and Modern.\"\n\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo raised the question as to whether Papers could be printed before being passed by the Council.\n\nResolved,\u2014That Mr. F. Modder's Paper be accepted and read at a General Meeting.\n\n4. Laid on the table the following Papers:\u2014\n\n(a) \"Chelappadikaram,\" by the Hon. P. Coomaraswamy.\n(b) \"A Temple Festival in the Mullaitivu District,\" by Mr. J. P. Lewis.\n(c) \"The Temple of Chittrevylader Kovil, Mullaitivu District,\" by Mr. J. P. Lewis.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Papers be referred to Messrs. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than and J. Harward for report.\n\n5. Laid on the table Notes by Mr. F. Lewis on \"The Nidification of Sturnornis Senex and Cissa Ornata.\"\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Paper be accepted as one to be read.\n\n6. Laid on the table a Paper by Mr. S. Alexander, entitled \"An Archaeological Account of Patahawatta.\"\n\nResolved,\u2014That the Paper be referred to Mr. H. C. P. Bell for his opinion.\n\n7. Laid on the table English translations of Vol. I., 1841-42, and Vol. II., 1842-44, of the Galle Dutch Records.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the translations be referred to the Hon. Mr. Swettenham and Mr. P. Freudenberg, and that they be requested to make selections to be printed in the Society's Journal, or in case they recommend the printing of the entire translations, that it be done.\n8. Laid on the table a Paper by the late Mr. Israel Homer Vannia Sinkam on the \"Snakes of Ceylon,\" together with the opinions of the President and Mr. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, to whom the Paper was referred in accordance with a resolution of the Council.\n\nResolved,\u2014That the extracts recommended by the Lord Bishop be laid on the table, and printed.\n\n9. Laid on the table Circular No. 142 of November 21, 1892, re the balance of the Excavation Fund.\n\nCIRCULAR.\n\nFor the Opinions of Members of Council.\n\nNo. 142. Colombo, November 21, 1892.\n\nAt a General Meeting held on February 12, 1884 (Proceedings, p. xxv), at Sir A. H. Gordon's suggestion a subscription paper was set on foot for Archaeological purposes. His Excellency headed the paper, and a sum of Rs. 825 was at once forthcoming, to be devoted \"to the excavation of the covered chapels of the Mirisawetiya D\u00e1gaba at Anur\u00e1dhapura, and to further archaeological research.\"\n\n(2) The fund has remained untouched since the excavation of the east chapel of the Mirisawetiya D\u00e1gaba. There is a balance of Rs. 642\u00b721 still unexpended.\n\n(3) Mr. Bell, in a letter to the Council (No. 148 of December 16, 1890, published in Journal No. 42, p. 30), kindly undertook to supervise any archaeological work at Anur\u00e1dhapura which the Society might be disposed to prosecute, and to furnish a statement of the results of, and the expenditure incurred in, such exploration, if the Council voted the money for certain alternative schemes which he suggested.\n\n(4) The Council resolved \"that the whole balance be placed at the disposal of Mr. Bell to be devoted to the objects for which the money was originally subscribed\" (Journal No. 42, p. 31).\n\n(5) Mr. Bell, in answer, wrote to the Council under date October 30, 1891, and he has since called attention to his letter. This letter was not dealt with ere this owing (i.) to the want of a quorum: on two occasions the Council was summoned, but did not meet; and (ii.) to want of time on two occasions, when the Council did meet, to discuss this amongst other subjects.\n\n(6) In this letter Mr. Bell points out that the wording of the resolution of the Council \"leaves the matter in statu quo,\" as the \"object for which the money was originally subscribed appears to have been to carry out excavation at Mirisawetiya D\u00e1gaba.\" Mr. Bell suggests \"that the opinion of the Sub-Committee under whose direction the work on Mirisawetiya D\u00e1gaba was commenced should be taken, as to the disposal of the balance on the Excavation Fund.\" The surviving Members of the Sub-Committee are Sir A. H. Gordon and Dr. W. R. Kynsey. Mr. Bell recommends the setting up of the Buddhist Railing (discovered by him in 1890) as a work of greater archaeological importance than the others originally suggested.\n\nG. A. Joseph,\nAssistant Secretary.\nCORRESPONDENCE.\n\nNo. 112. Anur\u00e1dhapura, September 3, 1891.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to invite attention to my letter No. 148 of December 16 last,* relative to the restoration of some ruins out of the unexpended balance of the Excavation Fund, to which I have as yet received no reply.\n\nI am, &c.,\nH. C. P. Bell,\nArchaeological Commissioner.\n\nThe Hon. Secretary, Ceylon Branch,\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nNo. 182. Colombo, September 5, 1891.\n\nSir,\u2014With reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, I have the honour to inform you that your letter No. 148 of December 16, 1890, was laid before a Meeting of the Council of this Society held on May 13 last, when it was resolved \"That the whole of the balance of the Excavation Fund be placed at the disposal of Mr. Bell, to be devoted to the objects for which the money was originally subscribed.\"\n\nI am, &c.,\nH. C. P. Bell, Esq., c.c.s.\nArchaeological Commissioner.\n\nG. A. Joseph,\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nAnur\u00e1dhapura, October 30, 1891.\n\nSir,\u2014In continuation of my letter No. 148 of December 16, and in reply to your No. 182 of September 5 on behalf of the Council of the Asiatic Society, I have the honour to point out that the wording of the Resolution of Council placing at my disposal balance of the Excavation Fund leaves the matter in statu quo.\n\nThe object for which the money was originally subscribed appears to have been to carry out excavations at Mirisawetiya D\u00e1gaba. An Archaeological Sub-Committee was appointed (see Resolution of Council of the Asiatic Society's Committee, dated March 24, 1884), consisting of His Excellency the Governor (Sir A. H. Gordon), President; the Hon. J. F. Dickson, c.m.g., Vice-President; and W. R. Kynsey, Esq., p.c.m.o., to direct that work in co-operation with the Government Agent and the Provincial Engineer of Anur\u00e1dhapura. The amount subscribed was Rs. 840.\n\nWork on Mirisw\u00ebti D\u00e1gaba was at once commenced under the immediate superintendence of Mr. S. M. Burrows, c.c.s.\n\nThe result was disappointing\u2014nothing of real value was discovered. It was found that no chapels existed on three sides of the Mirisaw\u00ebtiya D\u00e1gaba, and all that was laid bare were the mouldings and plaster covering of the D\u00e1gaba. (Statement of President, General Meeting, January 29, 1885.)\u2020\n\n* Printed in Journal No. 42, vol. XII., p. 30.\n\u2020 See also Excavations at Anur\u00e1dhapura (S. M. Burrows), Ceylon Asiatic Society's Proceedings, 1887-88, pp. cii.-ciii.\nSubsequent excavation, however, in the course of the restoration of Mirisaw\u0119tiya D\u00e1gaba undertaken by a Siamese Prince, has shown that chapels do exist on the north and south sides, but in a very dilapidated state.\n\nI would therefore suggest that the opinion of the Sub-Committee, under whose direction the work on Mirisaw\u0119tiya D\u00e1gaba was commenced, should be taken as to disposal of the balance on the Excavation Fund. Possibly the Sub-Committee may consider that the restoration of the north and south chapels of Mirisw\u0119ti D\u00e1goba, if practicable, should take precedence of the works recommended in my letter No. 148 of December 16 last.\n\nBut if I may be permitted to venture an opinion, the setting up of a portion of the \"Buddhist Railing,\" discovered last year, appears to me of greater archaeological importance than the other works suggested, and its result likely to be more effective.\n\nThis letter has been delayed owing to my absence on an extended circuit.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nThe Hon. Secretary, Ceylon Branch,\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nH. C. P. Bell,\nArchaeological Commissioner.\n\nNo. 132. Colombo, October 26, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honour to invite your attention to my letter No. 112 of September 3, 1891, and to request that you will be good enough to favour me with a reply. I would remind you that more than a year has elapsed since the despatch of the letter under reference.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nThe Hon. Secretary, Ceylon Branch,\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nH. C. P. Bell,\nArchaeological Commissioner.\n\nNo. 133. Colombo, October 29, 1892.\n\nSir,\u2014In connection with my letter of the 26th instant, No. 132, I have the honour to request you to alter therein the words \"letter No. 112 of September, 1891,\" to \"letter of October 30.\"\n\n(2) I beg that you will submit my letter of the 26th instant, No. 132, amended, as requested, together with this letter, to the next Meeting of Council, which is to be held I understand on the 4th proximo.\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nThe Hon. Secretary, Ceylon Branch,\nRoyal Asiatic Society.\n\nH. C. P. Bell,\nArchaeological Commissioner.\n\nEXTRACT FROM ANNUAL REPORT, 1886.\n\n\"The balance remaining on the Excavation Fund raised by special subscriptions in 1884 amounts to Rs. 440'05, besides a small balance of Rs. 40 remaining in Mr. Ievers' hands from the advance of Rs. 200 issued to the Government Agent, Anur\u00e1dhapura, at different times. As\nthe work of the Mirisaw\u0119tiya D\u00e1gaba (for which the fund was originally subscribed) is completed, the Committee is of opinion that the funds may be usefully transferred to the general funds of the Society, to be applied to such other excavation schemes as may commend themselves to the Committee at its discretion. To this proposal the consent of the Special Committee appointed to deal with this fund (of which His Excellency the Governor is Chairman) has been solicited.\"\n\n(1) I came across this passage to-day, and quote it here in the hope that it may be of use.\n\n(2) I can find no record showing that any decision was arrived at by the Committee.\n\nJanuary 12, 1892. G. A. Joseph.\n\nMinutes by Members of Council.\n\nSo far as I can recollect, the Council meant at the time it passed the resolution, that the unexpended balances should be placed entirely at the disposal of the Archaeological Commissioner, to be spent on such archaeological work as he (the Commissioner) chose, whether it be the restoration of the \"Buddhist Railing\" or that of the two \"Pavilions\" near the Ruanweli d\u00e1gaba, or the excavation of the J\u00e9tawanar\u00e1ma, or any other work. One of the original objects for which the money was originally subscribed was \"to further archaeological research.\" The resolution of the Council dated May 13, 1892, is comprehensive enough, I think, to authorise Mr. Bell to spend the money on the restoration of the \"Buddhist Railing\" if he thinks best.\n\nE. S. W. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1ja,\nHonorary Secretary.\n\nReceived and returned, November 24, 1892.\n\nI was not present at any Council Meeting at which the question came up. [It appears to me that the letter of October 30, 1891, should have been dealt with, either at a Meeting, or (as now) by circulating it, without a year being allowed to lapse, and attention invited.]\n\nH. C. P. Bell,\nHonorary Secretary.\n\nI agree with Mr. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1ja.\n\nNovember 29, 1892. F. H. M. Corbet.\nHonorary Treasurer.\n\nSeen. Returned December 2, 1892.\n\nS. Green.\n\nThe Archaeological Commissioner should be authorised to spend the money in any explorations or other works he thinks best. He is fully warranted, in my opinion, in doing so already, by the terms of the object for which the grant was originally made\u2014\"to further archaeological research.\"\n\nDecember 4, 1892. H. Trimen.\nI agree with Dr. Trimen.\n\nDecember 8, 1892. \n\nF. C. H. Clarke.\n\nI think the Archaeological Commissioner should have a free hand in spending the money on any work he considers worth, in accordance with the object for which the money was subscribed.\n\nW. P. Ranasingha.\n\nThe point is whether the setting up of the Buddhist Railing (as desired by Mr. Bell) comes within the purview of the resolution, that the fund collected should be devoted to \"The excavation of the covered chapels of the Mirisawetiya Dagaba and to further archaeological research.\"\n\nThe work of \"setting up\" is not \"excavation\" nor \"furthering of archaeological research.\"\n\nApart from the resolution, I would like to see Mr. Bell's desire realised.\n\nJanuary 13, 1893. \n\nP. Ramathan.\n\nAs far as I can gather from these papers the Archaeological Commissioner has as much power as this Council to dispose of the money in question.\n\nA. de A. Seneyratne.\n\nI quite agree with Dr. Trimen.\n\nJanuary 16, 1893. \n\nJ. P. Lewis.\n\nSeen.\n\nJanuary 17, 1893. \n\nF. H. M. Corbet.\n\nMr. Bell should be authorised to spend the balance as he proposes, i.e., on the restoration of the Buddhist Railing.\n\nReceived and returned January 19, 1893. \n\nW. R. Kynsey.\n\nI agree with Dr. Kynsey.\n\nJanuary 20, 1893. \n\nW. G. Vandort.\n\nI agree with Dr. Kynsey.\n\nJanuary 20, 1893. \n\nJ. A. Swettenham.\nI entirely agree with Dr. Trimen's opinion.\n\nJanuary 22, 1893.\n\nG. WALL.\n\n[This circular was laid on the table at a Meeting of the Council held on the 27th instant, when it was resolved that the final decision of the question be deferred, pending reference to the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President of the Society.]\n\nThe sum referred to was not, I think, collected by the Royal Asiatic Society, as such, nor placed at the disposal of the Council as such: it was, as I understood it, only accidentally connected with the Society. I consider, therefore, that I have nothing to do with it, and have no objection to any use that may be made of it, so long as it is not the act of the Society.\n\nBut if it were proposed that the Society should directly or indirectly undertake any restoration whatever, I should be obliged to protest against it as alien from the objects of the Society. I should recommend, therefore, that the Council should reply that the Fund in question does not belong to the Royal Asiatic Society, Ceylon Branch, and that there is no objection on the Society's part to Mr. Bell's using it as he sees fit.\n\nFebruary 1, 1893.\n\nR. S. COLOMBO.\n\nOn a motion proposed by the Chairman, the Lord Bishop of Colombo,\n\nResolved\u2014That there is no objection on the part of the Society to the expenditure of the balance of the Excavation Fund, raised by special subscription in 1884, in the manner proposed by Mr. Bell and recommended by Dr. Kynsey, the remaining Member of the Special Committee, and that the Treasurer is hereby authorised to hand the balance over to Mr. Bell.\n\n10. Laid on the table correspondence with Mr. J. F. W. Gore re the compilation of an Index to the Society's Publications:\n\nNo. 200.\n\nMarch 21, 1893.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I am informed by Mr. H. C. P.

Mr. Joseph read the following Paper:\u2014\nNOTES ON THE NIDIFICATION OF STURNORNIS SENEX (WHITE-HEADED STARLING) AND CISSA ORNATA (CEYLON BLUE JAY).\n\nBy F. Lewis.\n\nThe White-headed Starling is, I believe, the rarest of Ceylon birds, its natural home being those parts of the country where the rainfall is well over 100 inches per annum.\n\nIn the course of many years I have only met with it at rare intervals. It is a gregarious species living in small flocks of from four to ten birds, when it may be found affecting small clumps of forest, but at no time far away from extensive forest-clad ranges of hills. In this way I found it in Rasagalla forest, Balangoda; Bambarabotuwa, north of Pelmadulla; Eratna, below Adam\u2019s Peak; and Wellankanda, in the wildest part of the Kukulu Korale.\n\nIn April, 1892, Mr. G. W. Jenkins, of Sana Estate, managed to procure for me an egg, and soon after I proceeded to the spot and saw the nest. This was placed in the hollow (decayed portion) of a kokatiya tree (Garcinia termophylla), some fifty feet or so from the ground, and was very roughly lined with decayed leaves and twigs, but upon no systematic plan, except that the leaves appeared to be mostly of one kind.\n\nThe egg is in colour a beautiful light glossy blue, broad oval in shape, but rather acute towards the \u201cnarrow end.\u201d My specimen measures $1\\frac{1}{8}$ in. by $\\frac{7}{8}$ in.\n\nIn 1876 I procured, while resident in the Dikoya district, what I believed to be the egg of the Ceylon Blue Jay (Cissa ornata), but the specimen being in fragments, I was unable for years to verify my supposition or secure a perfect egg. In January last Mr. J. Gray, of Balangoda, procured for me a perfect egg from the forest of Bambarabotuwa, and I am also indebted to him for a second specimen, though not in good preservation.\nThe nest that I found in 1876 was placed in the branches of a lofty tree, and was composed of small twigs, forming a rather large structure, of somewhat ragged outward appearance. The depression in the middle was small, but on this I am not able to place much significance, as the nest had served its purpose, and the birds had departed, so probably it was in a disordered state when I found it.\n\nThe egg, considering the size of the bird, is small, broad, oval, and glossy. My specimen measures $1\\frac{1}{4}$ in. by $\\frac{15}{8}$ in. The ground colour is a pale olive green, shaded over with blotches and streaks of a dull faint sepia colour, these markings being more confluent on the two ends than round the body of the egg.\n\nThe breeding season for the Blue Jay is seemingly in January, for I learn from Mr. Gray that he procured three nests this year during that month.\n\nI take the liberty of recording both these \"finds,\" as the first is unique, while the second, though recorded by Legge and Murray, is of rare occurrence owing to the shy habits of the bird.\n\n4. Mr. Harward then read the following Paper:\u2014\nNOTES ON KNOX'S \"CEYLON\" IN ITS LITERARY ASPECT.\n\nBy H. WHITE, C.C.S.\n\n[An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon in the East-Indies, together with an Account of the Detaining in Captivity the Author and divers other Englishmen now Living there, and of the Author's Miraculous Escape. Illustrated with Figures and a Map of the Island. By Robert Knox, a Captive there near Twenty Years. London, Printed by Richard Chiswell, Printer to the Royal Society, at the Rose and Crown in St. Paul's Churchyard, 1681.]\n\nThis fascinating book, which has won well-earned praise for the accuracy of its descriptions, simple but vigorous style, and fairness and moderation of its tone, is surpassed, I venture to say, by no work in the English language in pathos and dramatic interest. But I wish here to consider the book not so much as a pathetic drama, a romantic narrative, a vigorous account of an unknown country, but as a piece of literary workmanship. I cannot call to mind having ever met with any notes on what I may call the purely literary aspect of Knox's book, though it is well known and appreciated as a rare storehouse of information on the then condition of the Kandyan kingdom.\n\nAt the outset we must bear in mind that this book was written by a sailor who had been a captive among the Kandyans for twenty years. Knox was only seventeen years of age, a mere boy, when on January 21, 1657, his father's ship, the frigate Ann, set sail from London to trade from port to port in India. In November, 1659, when Knox, as he himself tells us, was nineteen years old, the ship put in to Cottiar bay. The crew were made captives and carried off into the Kandyan country. Knox remained a captive for twenty years, escaped to Mann\u00e1r in 1679, and reached England in 1680. He lost no time in the preparation of his book. He even wrote part of it on the voyage home, as he mentions in his letter of March 18, 1681, to the Committee of the East India Company, when he presented his manuscript work\nto them, and in August, 1681, the book was published with illustrations and a map; or, as Knox expresses it:\n\nWhat I formerly Presented you in Writing having in pursuance of your Commands now somewhat dress'd by the help of the Printer and Graver, I a second time humbly tender to you.\n\nThis was almost exactly twenty-four years after the author first set sail with his father as a boy of seventeen, and less than twelve months after he reached England. The book is truly a marvellous production as a piece of literary work when we consider the above circumstances, but still more when we consider, what is hard to realise, that for twenty years its author had no books save three (which will be mentioned hereafter), no writing materials, and no society except that of one or two of his fellow captives and of course his Kandyan captors. To use his own words to a chief who came to sound him with a view to his employment at the Kandyan court:\n\nWhen I came ashore I was but young, and that which then I knew now I had forgot for want of practice, having had neither ink nor paper since I came ashore.\n\nThe marvel is that he even remembered his own language.\n\nThere are two things which charm us in Knox's book\u2014and here I am thinking mostly of the personal narrative, for the book is in two parts\u2014the descriptive portion and the personal narrative. There is the charm of the subject and the charm of the style.\n\nThe secret of the charm of Knox's style is that his English is the English of the Bible, which with two other books was his sole reading during his long captivity. He says:\n\nWe had with us a Practice of Piety and Mr. Rogers' seven Treatises called the Practice of Christianity.* With which companions we did frequently discourse; and in the cool of the Evening walk abroad in the Fields for a refreshing, tyred with being all day in our House or Prison.\n\nAnd again:\n\nI had read my two Books so often over that I had them almost by heart.\n\n* A copy of this book is in the Society's Library.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nHe describes in a passage, which is too long to quote, how he fell in with an English Bible, and it is evident that this, too, he read so often that he had it almost by heart. He is steeped in the style of the Bible, which has become his natural language, and his pages teem with direct and apposite Biblical allusions. Of the Kandyan king he says:\n\nLike Rehoboam he added yet more to the people's yoke.... he daily contriveth and buildeth in his Palace like Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nOf himself, when forced to leave his quarters owing to an incursion by the Dutch, he says:\n\nThis called to my remembrance the words of Job: \"Naked came I into this world and naked shall I return.\"\n\nIn one passage he likens himself to Elijah under the juniper tree, and in another to the captive Jews. The elephants he met in the woods in the course of his flight to Mann\u00e1r he looked upon as a help to him in his flight, and compared them to the darkness which came between Israel and the Egyptians. Not only does Knox thus continually use illustrations drawn from the Bible, but he has acquired a Biblical tone of phraseology. The offerings of the Sinhalese are \"arms and oblations.\" He says\u2014\n\nGod gave us favour in the sight of this people. God was pleased by their grief and heaviness to move these heathen to pity.\n\nTemple offerings he calls \"sacrifices offered to idols,\" and he speaks of \"the famine of God's word and sacrifices.\" It would be tedious to multiply examples: the perusal of a page of the personal narrative will show that Knox was simply saturated with the Biblical style.\n\nThe following specimen will show what I mean. Speaking of himself after the death of his father he says:\n\nThus was I left Desolate, Sick, and in Captivity, having no earthly Comforter, none but only He who looks down from Heaven to hear the groaning of the Prisoners and to show himself a Father of the Fatherless, and a present help to them that have no helper.\n\nTo leave this branch of the subject, I should now like to give some instances of Knox's aptness of diction, a curiosa\n*felicitas* of language which I have always admired. Take this passage on the talipot tree:\n\nIt is as big and tall as a Ship\u2019s Mast and very straight, bearing only Leaves: which are of great use and benefit to this People; one single Leaf being so broad and large that it will cover some fifteen or twenty men, and keep them dry when it rains. The leaf being dried is very strong and limber, and most wonderfully made for men\u2019s Convenience to carry along with them; for tho\u2019 this leaf be thus broad when it is open, yet it will fold close like a *Ladies\u2019 fan*, and then it is no bigger than a man\u2019s arm. It is wonderful light, they cut them into pieces and carry them in their hands. The whole leaf spread is round, almost like a *Circle*, but being cut in pieces for use are near like unto a *Triangle*. They lay them upon their heads as they travel, with the peaked end foremost, which is convenient to make their way through the Boughs and Thickets. When the Sun is vehement hot they use them to shade themselves from the heat. Soldiers all carry them; for besides the benefit of keeping them dry in case it rain upon the march, these leaves make their Tents to ly under in the Night. A marvelous Mercy which *Almighty God* hath bestowed upon this poor and naked People in this Rainy Country! One of these I brought with me into *England* and you have it described in the Figure.\n\nI venture to say that no one could better this description. Again, take this account of the *kabaragoy\u00e1*\u2014\n\nThere is a Creature here called *Kobbera guion*, resembling an *Alligator*. The biggest may be five or six foot long, speckled black and white. He lives most upon the Land, but will take the water and dive under it: hath a long blew forked tongue like a sting, which he puts forth and hisseth and gapeth, but doth not bite nor sting, tho\u2019 the appearance of him would scare those that knew not what he was. He is not afraid of people, but will ly gaping and hissing at them in the way, and will scarce stir out of it. He will come and eat Carrion with the *Dogs* and *Jackals* and will not be scared away by them, but if they come near to bark or snap at him, with his tayl, which is about an Ell long like a whip, he will so slash them, that they will run away and howl.\n\nThis is true to the life and most graphic. Or take this of the Sinhalese:\n\nAt their leisure when their affairs will permit they commonly meet at places built for strangers and way-faring men to lodge in, in their language called *amblamb*, where they sit chewing betel and looking one upon the other very gravely and solidly.\n\nOr this of their paddy fields:\n\n---\n\n*Hydrosaurus salvator* (order *Saurea*).\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nNeither are their steep and Hilly Lands uncapable of being thus overflown with Water. For the doing of which they use this Art. They level these Hills into narrow Allies, some three, some eight foot wide, one beneath another, according to the steepness of the Hills, working them and digging them in that fashion that they ly smooth and flat like so many Stairs up the Hills one above another. The Waters at the top of the Hills falling downwards are let into these Allies and so successively by running out of one into another, water all; first the higher Lands and then the lower. The highest Allies having such a quantity of Water as may suffice to cover them, the rest runs over unto the next, and that having its proportion unto the next, and so by degrees it falls into all these hanging parcels of Ground.\n\nOr this of termites or white-ants:\n\nThere is a sixth sort called Vaeos.* These are more numerous than any of the former. All the whole Earth doth swarm with them. They are of a middle size between the greatest and the least, the hinder part white and the head red. They eat and devour all that they can come at; as besides food, Cloth, Wood, Thatch of Houses and everything excepting Iron and Stone. So that the people cannot set anything upon the ground within their houses for them. They creep up the walls of their houses and build an Arch made of dirt over themselves all the way as they climb, be it never so high. And if this Arch and Vault chance to be broken, they all, how highsoever they were, come back again to mend up the breach, which being finished they proceed forwards again, eating everything they come at in their way. This Vermin does exceedingly among the Chingulays, insomuch that they are continually looking upon anything they value to see if any of these Vaeos have been at it. Which they may easily perceive by this Case of dirt which they cannot go up anywhere without building as they go. And wherever this is seen no doubt the Ants are there. In places where there are no houses, and they can eat nothing belonging to the people, they will raise great Hills like Butts, some four or five or six foot high; which are so hard and strong that it would be work enough to dig them down with Pick-Axes.\n\nKnox evidently took the greatest pains to make what he describes clear to his readers, and there is no doubt that his accurate and graphic method, aided by the excellent pictures, bring home to us in a most vivid fashion the customs, appearance, and domestic economy of the Sinhalese people.\n\nFrom a philological point of view the book is most interesting. We see the changes which the lapse of two\n\n* Sinhalese V\u00e9y\u00f3.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nhundred years has wrought in the meaning and spelling of our English language. To illustrate this let us look at the following words which I have taken from these pages.\n\nIn the letter to the East India Company Knox speaks of \"the land in which I was captivated,\" meaning imprisoned or held captive; it has now come to mean \"entranced\" or \"delighted.\" For Knox's use of the word cf. Jeremiah xxxix. (contents of the chapter: \"The city ruined, the people captivated.\") and 2 Kings xvii, (contents, \"Samaria for their sins is captivated\").\n\nIn one passage he speaks of a certain flower as being of a \"murry\" colour. This is mulberry coloured, the l having superseded the earlier r: cf. Latin morus, \"mulberry tree.\" The word \"murry\" is now obsolete. He also speaks of the \"tingling\" of bells where we should now say \"tinkling.\" The two words \"tinkling\" of a bell and \"tingling\" of the skin or flesh are identical, the meaning being \"vibration.\" \"Ortyards and plantations\": \"ortyard\" or \"wortyard\" is the original of our present \"orchard.\" \"Imbezelled,\" where we now write \"embezzled.\" The old spelling shows the connection with \"imbecile,\" and the meaning is \"to weaken by taking little by little,\" or \"filching.\" \"A blew or red shash about their loyns.\" What we now call \"sash\" is a Persian word originally spelt, and no doubt pronounced \"shash.\" Knox says in one place: \"We thought it no boot to sit longer.\" \"Boot,\" which now survives in the negative \"bootless,\" we find in the Bible, in the form \"boots\" and \"booteth.\" It is from the base \"bet\" good, whence \"better,\" \"best.\"\n\nOf the B\u00f3 tree he says: \"The leaves shake like an asp.\" The form \"aspen\" now used is an adjective, like \"oaken\" or \"ashen\" or \"wooden,\" and we should not say, as is sometimes done, \"shake like an aspen,\" but \"an aspen tree\"; or, as Knox says, \"an asp.\" Of the Kandyan nobles he says: \"They carry a painted cane, and sometimes a tuck in it, in their hands.\" \"Tuck\" is an obsolete word for \"rapier,\" and \"a cane with a tuck in it\" is what we should now call a\n\"sword-stick.\" He also speaks of the \"tricker\" of a cross-bow. \"Trigger\" is the more modern form. With \"tricker\" cf. the Dutch \"trek,\" to draw or pull. He speaks of the Sinhalese as churning butter with an implement \"somewhat resembling a chocolate stick.\" This is not the familiar stick of chocolate which you extract from the automatic machine by placing a penny in the slot, but the \"whisk\" with which the then highly esteemed cup of chocolate, so constantly referred to by authors of this and the succeeding age of Queen Anne, was stirred and frothed.\n\nThe word \"punctually,\" now strictly limited in meaning to accuracy in the matter of time, is used by Knox in the old sense of \"exactly\" or \"accurately.\" \"I knew not punctually where my companions were.\" Cf. \"punctilious,\" of exact, orderly, and formal behaviour. \"Let\" and \"letted,\" in the sense of \"hindered,\" \"prevented,\" and \"holpen\" for \"helped,\" which we have in our Book of Common Prayer, are always used by him; and he also uses the word \"angle,\" meaning fishing rod and line, and thus reminds us of dear old Isaak Walton.\n\nI cannot forbear to transcribe the passage where this word is used. It is when he meets with the Bible:\n\nThe Boy having served the English knew the Book, and as soon as he had got it in his hand came running with it calling out to me, It is a Bible. It startled me to hear him mention the name of a Bible. For I neither had one, nor scarcely could ever think to see one. Upon which I flung down my Angle and went to meet him. ... ... Upon the sight of it I left off Fishing, God having brought a Fish to me that my Soul had longed for and now how to get it and enjoy the same all the Powers of my Soul were employed.\n\nThe word \"naturally,\" in the sense of \"by nature,\" should be noted in the passage\u2014\n\nThe Land is generally covered with Woods, excepting the Kingdome of Ouvah and the counties of Oulipallet and Dolosbaug, which are naturally somewhat clear of them.*\n\n\"Fashion,\" meaning \"shape,\" occurs in the description of the grain tana:\u2014\n\nThe fashion flattish, the colour yellow and very lovely to the Eye.\n\n* Uva; Ud\u0101pal\u0101ta; Dolosb\u00e1g\u00e9.\nObserve \"drugster\" for \"druggist\": \"The berries the drugsters in the city do sell in their shops\"; and \"sallettings\" for \"salads.\" \"The Dutch on that Island in their Gardens have Lettice, Rosemary, Sage, and all other Herbs and Sallettings that we have in these Countreys.\" The old Italian word is salata, \"salted or pickled (herbs).\"\n\nI rather distrust Knox's taste in vegetables, I must say. He speaks of one herb which \"being boyled is almost as good as asparagus.\" I have never met with that delicious herb yet, and I take leave to doubt the assertion.\n\nThe jambu* fruit is to him \"amiable to the eye.\" The expressions, \"rice is more plenty here than there,\" and \"monies was very low with us,\" show interesting changes in idiom.\n\nTwo words now obsolete deserve mention: one is \"overthwart.\" Speaking of talipot leaves: \"With these they make their tents; fixing sticks into the ground and laying other pieces of wood overthwart after the manner of the roof of an house, and so lay their leaves over all to shoot the rains off.\" The other is \"tarriance,\" meaning sojourn or remaining. Even \"tarry\" is now seldom seen, and \"tarriance\" never.\n\nSome changes in spelling\u2014and there are many\u2014are noteworthy. Hoes used in cultivating paddy fields Knox spells \"houghs,\" no doubt pronounced hoes. Cf. the spelling and pronunciation of \"dough\" in making bread. It is odd that we have altered \"hough\" to \"hoe,\" while we have altered the old \"plow\" to \"plough,\" in the one case from complex to simple and in the other from simple to complex. Blue, the colour, Knox spells \"blew.\" His spelling and the expression he uses, \"several black and blew blows,\" bring out forcibly the actual connection there is in etymology between \"blue\" and \"blow.\" Blue is the colour produced by blows.\n\nBy some freak or other Knox spells \"glue\" \"glew,\"\n\n---\n\n* Sig. j\u00e1mbara, colloq. jambu, \"rose apple,\" Eugenia jambosa.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nwhich is wrong. The derivation is from \"gluten.\" Perhaps he thought \"glew\" ought to keep company with \"blew.\"\n\nKnox never mentions any books except the three alluded to above, and I have searched his work through to find any indications of his having received an education in what is vulgarly styled \"book learning.\" It would seem that he knew Latin, or at least knew of the existence of Latin, for he says of the Sinhalese: \"They have a language somewhat differing from the vulgar tongue (like Latin to us)\"; but the only Latin words in his book are the not very erudite words \"per annum,\" so we can hardly set him down as a Latin scholar. Or perhaps he forgot his Latin like the Claimant, the would-be Sir Roger Tichborne. He uses a few phrases which somewhat smack of the law, e.g., \"Scot or lot,\" \"Hand and seal,\" \"Heriots.\" But these are all I have been able to find.\n\nHe is very reticent about himself outside of his captivity. He says nothing about his birthplace, parentage, or education. All we know is that he was an Englishman, and that he had a brother and sister whom his dying father commended to his care.\n\nHe makes very few references to England, and hardly ever draws any parallel between what he saw in Ceylon and what he must have seen in England. He mentions that the divisions of Ceylon are like the counties and hundreds in England, and he speaks of one chief as the \"high sheriff.\" He compares the king's palace to Woodstock Bower, and notes that the Sinhalese ploughs do not bury the grass as ours do, and that is about all.\n\nAnd while on this part of the subject it is curious to note that Knox nowhere in his book makes the faintest allusion to home politics, though his book was written during the time of the fiercest civil and religious persecution in England, and only a few years before the revolution which overthrew the Stuart dynasty. We know that he was not a Roman Catholic, and we can infer that he was not a Puritan, as he and his comrades mention a feast they had on Christmas Day, but we do not know whether he was an advocate of monarchy\nor a Republican. He expresses his views of the Kandyan king's tyranny, but no opinion as to monarchy in general.\n\nAlthough he tells us very little of what he had been, he relates frankly enough what habits he picked up during his captivity, and the appearance he presented at the time of his escape. On his arrival at Mann\u00e1r he says\u2014\n\nIt seemed not a little strange to us who had dwelt so long in Straw Cottages among the Black Heathen and used to sit on the Ground and eat our Meat on Leaves, now to sit on Chairs and eat out of China Dishes at Table.\n\nAnd in Colombo\u2014\n\nWe being bare-foot and in the Chingulary habit, with great long Beards, the People much wondered at us, and came flocking to see who and what we were; so that we had a great Train of People about us as we walked in the Streets.\n\nAnd Batavia\u2014\n\nWe finding ourselves thus kindly entertained and our Habits changed, saw that we were no more Captives in Cande, nor yet Prisoners elsewhere; therefore cut off our beards which we had brought with us out of our Captivity, for until then we cut them not; God having rolled away the reproach of Cande from us.\n\nKnox adopted the Sinhalese habit of chewing betel, and he also smoked a pipe, or, as the Sinhalese say, \"drank tobacco.\" I have not been able to find many Sinhalese idioms in the English of Knox, but he does say \"tobacco is used by both men and women, but more eaten than drunk in pipes.\" To \"drink tobacco\" is a literal translation from the Sinhalese, but I am not sure that the expression was not used in England in Knox's day. I fancy I have seen it, but cannot remember where. He also speaks of \"this country butter,\" \"my own country fashion,\" \"a fathom high,\" \"a span high,\" which he may have picked up from the Sinhalese.\n\nSpeaking of the skill of the native doctors he mentions one who would set a broken bone \"with that speed that the broken bone after it was set should knit by the time one might boil a pot of rice and three curries.\"\n\nThese I think are about the only Sinhalese idioms to be found.\nThere is, as could be expected, very little humour in Knox's book, but I have culled two rather comical expressions and one bull, although he was no Irishman. He says of the headmen:\n\nThese Inferior Officers commonly get their Palaces by Bribery. Their Children do pretend a right to them after their Father's Death, and will be preferred before others, greazing the Magistrate.\n\nThis does not mean smearing that functionary with cocoanut oil, but, as we would punningly put it, \"applying palm oil.\"\n\nAgain, speaking of the method of catching fish in shallow water with a basket, he says:\n\nThese baskets they jobb down and the ends stick in the mud, which often happen upon a Fish.\n\nTo \"jobb\" is now only used as pure slang. Knox's bull is only a small one: we might describe it as a \"this country bull.\" He describes Kandy as \"three square like a triangle.\n\nIn spite of his lack of education in the ordinary sense of the word, this castaway sailor lad has given us a most delightful book, which is as interesting as \"Robinson Crusoe,\" and in style it is the equal of Defoe's masterpiece, although Defoe was what might be styled an experienced literary man, and is now an English classic.\n\nKnox's work was favourably ushered into the world with a brief preface by Sir Christopher Wren, and a longer one by Robert Hooke, a portion of which I will quote. He says:\n\nHe has in this History given you a taste of his Observations, in which most Readers, though of very differing Gists, may find somewhat very pleasant to their Pallat. The Statesman, Divine, Physician, Lawyer, Merchant, Mechanick, Husbandman, may select something for their Entertainment. The Philosopher and Historian much more. I believe at least all who love Truth will be pleased..................Read therefore the Book itself, and you will find yourself taken Captive indeed, but used more kindly by the Author than he himself was by the Natives.\n5. His Lordship, the President, expressed the indebtedness of the Society to Mr. White for his Paper. He spoke of Knox's extraordinary accuracy of observation, and the remarkable vigour and straightforward simplicity with which his observations were recorded. They were indebted to those who directed attention to excellencies of that kind\u2014excellencies which in a Society like that they deserved to cultivate and encourage. He rejoiced to see that close observation and careful collection of facts of which they had a specimen from Mr. Lewis, and which constituted the basis of scientific results. He trusted Members of the Society would consider no facts falling within their purview too insignificant to be recorded and contributed to the transactions of the Society. They could not always expect long or elaborate Papers, but he was sure that Members who would contribute facts which came under their observation would always find a hearty welcome from the Council for anything they could give.\n\n6. Mr. Harward next read the following Paper:\u2014\nKURUN\u00c9GALA VISTARAYA;* WITH NOTES ON KURUNEGALA, ANCIENT AND MODERN.\n\nBy F. Modder.\n\nIntroductory Note.\n\nThe Kurun\u00e9gala Visturaya is a topographical description of the city of Hastisailapura (Kurun\u00e9gala) in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. There are various editions and different versions of the Vistaraya extant in the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and of the half a dozen or more I have had the opportunity of examining and collating, for the purposes of this translation, no two copies agree in detail, though they agree in the main, each editor making his own emendations and additions to the original, or supposed original, as his taste and fancy led him, in the hope perhaps of making his edition fuller and more attractive than its predecessors, and bringing it up to date.\n\nThe Vistaraya makes no pretension to scholarship; indeed it is devoid of all literary merit, and judging by the plain and often commonplace language in which it is written, and the unsystematic arrangement of the subjects dealt with therein, it would appear that the editors were men of ordinary intelligence, their one object being to reduce into writing the legends, traditions, and other historical information respecting men, places, and things which might otherwise have been lost to the world.\n\nAs a chronological authority no importance can be attached to the work. But as an interesting topographical account of the city of Hastisailapura, with multifarious scraps of historical and other information not usually found in the more regular historical books of reference, it is perhaps on a par with such sister-works as Ka\u1e0daim-pot, which treat of the boundaries of the ancient divisions of Ceylon, and from which a great deal of invaluable information may be gleaned; Vitti-pot, which describe the state of the villages in the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s and Puttalam District, and record the amount of paddy land cultivated in each village, the height of water in the tank, the number of dams and tracts of land, large and small, the\n\n* Being a translation from the Sinhalese of a description of the city of Hastisailapura (Kurun\u00e9gala) in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, with a collation from other contemporaneous Sinhalese records, and notes and comments.\nnumber of horowwas to the tank, the number of temples and amount of land dedicated to them, and many other details peculiar to each village; and other contemporaneous records, such as Tudapat, Patunu, Asna, Wansa, L\u00e9kam-mi\u1e6di, &c., all which doubtless throw a flood of light on the history of the Island. The Vistaraya, however, gives in addition to these details the derivation of the names, not to be obtained elsewhere, of a large number of villages, K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and Hatpattus in the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s.\n\nMaha Mudaliy\u00e1r L. de Zoyza, in referring to the Vistaraya, remarks that\u2014\n\nIt is by an anonymous author. It gives an interesting account of the topography of the city in ancient times, and is probably as old as the period when Kurun\u00e9gala was the seat of kings in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The work is quite unknown in the low-country, and I believe even in Kandy.*\n\nAs already observed, one manuscript contains matter not found in the other, and perhaps the edition which L. de Zoyza had access to did not disclose the name of the author: but one that I had the good fortune to read ascribes the authorship to Pusbadewa Terunn\u00e1nse, and gives the following particulars as to its alleged authenticity:\u2014\n\nIt was preserved by Hetti Basn\u00e1yaka Mudiy\u00e1nse when Kurun\u00e9gala was a royal city; when Dambadeniya was the seat of Government, by Hanluwa Mudiy\u00e1nse, the village being so called owing to tiles having been made there; when S\u00edtawaka was the seat of Government, by Seneviratna Mudiy\u00e1nse; and at the time of R\u00e1ja Si\u1e45ha, who defeated the Portuguese at Colombo, by Dis\u00e1n\u00e1yaka Mudiy\u00e1nse.\n\nTRANSLATION.\u2020\n\nShortly after Kuv\u00e9ni\u2021 was discarded by King Vijaya it is said that the royal city of Kurun\u00e9gala was founded.\u00a7\n\n* Report on the Inspection of Temple Libraries. (Sessional Paper XI., 1875, p. 10.)\n\n\u2020 To Mr. H. M. Ekanayaka, Principal of the Buddhist School, Kurun\u00e9gala, I acknowledge my indebtedness for willing assistance rendered to me in the preparation of this translation.\n\n\u2021 A full account of the desertion of Kuv\u00e9ni by King Vijaya is given in the Kuv\u00e9ni Asna. For particulars as to her invoking the gods on the heights of Yakd\u0113ssa-gala (abbreviated from Yakseni-des-ki-gala, so called after the circumstance) to punish King Vijaya for his faithlessness, and as to her prayer being answered by King Vijaya's nephew, P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0duwas\u0101, being afflicted with divers diseases, see \"The Animal-shaped Rocks of Kurun\u00e9gala.\" (C. A. S. Journal, Vol. XI., No. 40, 1890.)\n\n\u00a7 The Vistaraya does not state, and we cannot gather from the context, who the founder was, but there is reason to believe that it was Vijaya.\nsituation being to the north of Vilb\u00e1wa, and occupying a central position near the rocks Et\u00e1-gala, Ibb\u00e1-gala, and Kuruminiy\u00e1-gala.*\n\n* * * * *\n\n[The Vistaraya then enumerates the trees, the beasts, the birds, including the fabulous birds, and other bipeds and quadrupeds to be found in the city; and refers to a row of lakes with good ferries to facilitate bathing, and containing pleasant and sweet waters, with the lotus and blue and white lily floating thereon. By the row of lakes is doubtless meant Udawattav\u00e9va (the Kurun\u00e9gala tank\u2020), Wannahav\u00e9va (now a field), Weneruv\u00e9wa, and Vilgodav\u00e9wa.]\n\nThere are four parapet walls surrounding the rock on which the sun-god is worshipped. Four palaces stand on the rock,\u2021 and below it four parapet walls. For the protection of the city there is a battery (\u00e1dh\u00e1ra b\u00ebmma).\u00a7\n\nBelow Kuruweniyagala stands the royal stores [the dimension\u2014probably the length\u2014of which is given as 80 cubits]: from the sleeping palace|| of the king it is 12 fathoms to Kuruweniyagala, 35 fathoms to Ibb\u00e1-gala, and 20 fathoms to the great stone wall [mah\u00e1 gal t\u00e1ppa, probably the battery hereinbefore referred to] on the west; and 12 fathoms to the south stands the Nir\u00e1viya.\n\n* For derivations of these names, and legends and traditions about these rocks, with notes on temples standing thereon or connected therewith, see \"The Animal-shaped Rocks of Kurun\u00e9gala.\" (l. c.)\n\n\u2020 For a description of this tank, which is 104 acres in extent, and said to have been built in 1319 by King Bhuwaneka B\u00e1hu III., as well as for other interesting particulars regarding it and Wenneruw\u00e9wa tank, see Ceylon Literary Register, Vol. VI., pp. 380\u20133.\n\n\u2021 Forbes, in his Eleven Years in Ceylon (Vol. I., pp. 193\u20134), refers to the remains of buildings on the bare rock (Et\u00e1-gala), one of which contained the dalad\u00e1 relic removed thither by Bhuwaneka B\u00e1hu from the more ancient capital of Polonaruwa, 1319 A.D. Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell (Vol. II., pp. 81\u20132), referring to these ruins, concludes \"that they must in former days have been intended for religious purposes.\"\n\n\u00a7 The Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1 records that Vijaya B\u00e1hu II. \"surrounded it (Hatthigiri) with a wall and a moat, and such like works.\"\u2014Ch. LXXXVIII., English translation, p. 305.\n\n|| Referring to Et\u00e1-gala, Casie Chitty says (Ceylon Gazetteer, pp. 145\u20136): \"At the west end of the hill the kings of Kurun\u00e9gala had a palace,\" on the\nIn the city there are 300 wells (\u00far\u00e1-lin),* 500 houses of valiant and powerful ministers, 500 houses of the dancing women, 500 houses of the Brahmins, 800 houses of the dhobies, 800 houses of the potters, 700 carpenters\u2019 sheds, 4 stables for horses,\u2020 3 stables for elephants, 2 herds of hunting buffaloes (da\u1e0da m\u012bgon),\u2021 an aviary, a kennel, and 700 powerful skilled and trained soldiers.\n\nThe formation of the city is as a full-blown lotus placed on the palm of the hand.\n\nsite of which now stands the residence of the Government Agent of the Province, known as the M\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1wa. Tennent refers to the grounds being strewn with \u201cfragments of columns and carved stones, the remnants of the royal buildings.\u201d (Ceylon, II., 345.) The disappearance of these relics of a bygone age may easily be accounted for. Bennett (p. 393) says: \u201cMany huge slabs of granite having various animals, both known and fabulous, sculptured on them lie scattered about; of these the British lion, the Caledonian unicorn (extraordinary though it be), and the Ceylon elephant appeared to have formed part of the zoological medley of the ancient ornaments of a Sinhalese M\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1wa. Mr. Pennel (the then Government Agent) offered me my choice of these ponderous masses, but as it may well be supposed there were weighty reasons for my not removing them.\u201d Some of these are yet to be seen built up at the back of the M\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1wa stables by the late Mr. O\u2019Grady, Government Agent; but the most valuable ones, and particularly a stone window of the palace at Y\u00e1pahu, rescued and removed thither by Mr. O\u2019Grady, and described most graphically by the late Mr. John Bailey, c.c.s., in Once a Week (1864, pp. 225\u2013281, where a well executed sketch of it appears), were transported to Colombo, and now occupy a prominent place among the archaeological exhibits of the Museum.\n\n* These wells are very common in the Kandyan district. They are circular in shape, about three feet in diameter, and instead of being built up with stone, earthen rings made by the village potter, and each about a foot and a half broad, are inserted and fitted in from the bottom of the well, increasing from two feet in diameter as they come up to the top to three feet. The earthen rings are called \u00far\u00e1kot\u1e6da, and the wells are known as \u00far\u00e1keta lin, abbreviated into \u00far\u00e1 lin. The \u00far\u00e1kot\u1e6da help to keep the water cool, and if they could be made of larger dimensions so as to fit into wells of all sizes, they would certainly be a useful and a cheap substitute for stone. Each of the rings used at present can be made at a cost of about 37\u00bd cents, and the cost of a well thus built would not exceed a couple of rupees.\n\n\u2020 Two pairs of stirrups and some cooking utensils were found near the Gal\u00e9band\u00e1ra shrine some years ago, and were sent to the Colombo Museum by the Hon. F.R. Saunders, then Government Agent. The place where they were discovered was probably the site of the royal stables, mounted orderly or cavalry guardroom.\n\n\u2021 These animals were used in the manner of decoys, trained so as to allow the sportsman to take cover behind them and to shoot at the game.\nTo the south of the Nir\u0101viya is a stone-built well and an ur\u0101-linda.\n\nTo the west of the sleeping palace of the king above mentioned, distant a hundred large bows, lies the bund of the lake. Round the edge of the lake grow flower plants * * [enumerated], and the lotus and lily grow in the lake, beautifying its appearance. The lake abounds with fish. Royal gardens lie around the lake * * [the plantations are enumerated] with innumerable bee-hives on the trees.\n\nAbout a hundred bows\u2019 distance* from the sleeping palace is the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa.\u2020\n\nOn the east of it, 9 fathoms distant, stands the N\u00e1ta D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9.\n\nIn a pit excavated in the rock, four cubits deep, lies buried a treasure consisting of 21,000 masuran or pieces of gold, with a relic of Buddha of the size of a grain of undu.\n\nFrom this spot, on the opposite bank of the stream, stands the Mah\u00e1 D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9 [probably dedicated to Vish\u1e47u], on the west, at a distance of 60 fathoms, the N\u00e1ta D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9, 60 fathoms away the Pattini D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9, and 80 fathoms away the Kattaragama D\u00e9v\u00e1l\u00e9.\n\nAt Uda-wahala-watta (the upper court, or queen\u2019s apartments) stands the crematory; at Pall\u00e9-wah\u00e1l\u00e1\u2021 (the lower court, or harem) the granaries.\n\n* According to Pridham, nine viyat are equal to one dunna or bow\u2014about nine English feet\u2014and 500 dunu are equal to a hetekma or mile. Cf. \u201cbowshot.\u201d\n\n\u2020 According to the Mah\u00e1vans\u00e1 King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu II., son of Vijaya B\u00e1hu III., who reigned in Hastisailapura from 1240 A.D. to 1275 A.D. (Turnour), caused his brother Bhuwaneka B\u00e1hu, the sub-king, to build a large vih\u00e1re in the noble city of Hatthigiri, and a beautiful parivena, which was called Mah\u00e1 Mahinda B\u00e1hu (chap. LXXXVII., English translation, p. 290). The remains of the royal founder were buried in the Mah\u00e1 Vih\u00e1re. On a visit to Hatthigiri by Vijaya B\u00e1hu II., during his father\u2019s lifetime, \u201che caused an excellent image-house of three stories to be built, and a great image of Buddha to be made there \u2026\u2026 and the prince called it (the establishment) Bhuwaneka B\u00e1hu Parivena, after the name of his uncle.\u201d (l. c.) (LXXXVIII., p. 305.) Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu IV., who began his reign at Kurun\u00e9gala in 1295 A.D. (Turnour), \u201ccaused a three-storied temple of the tooth-relic of great beauty to be rebuilt within the courtyard of the king\u2019s palace.\u201d (l. c.) (XC., pp. 316\u201317.)\n\n\u2021 Which correspond with the modern Udawalpola and Pall\u00e9walpola.\nTo the west of Hastipura-nuwara is \"Brahmin street\" (Bamunu-vidiya); on the east \"Sand street\" (Veli-vidiya); on the south \"Street of the gods\" (Deviy\u00f3-vidiya); on the north the \"Great\" or \"Main street\" (Mah\u00e1-vidiya).\n\nThe city is protected by three rocks: on the west by Angan-gala, east by Lunuketiya-gala, north by And\u00e1-gala; and (is bounded) on the south by the village Virab\u00e1hu gama,* east by the village Millowa, and west by Tittaw\u00e9li gama.\u2020\n\nThere are four tanks for the use of the city: on the west Vilgoda-vewa; south Weneru-vewa, Udawatta-vewa, and Wanah\u00e1-vewa, near the city; on the north-west D\u00e9vagomuwa; on the west Wanakuta-paruwata\u2014all which surround the city.\n\nThe principal royal villages (gabad\u00e1-gam) are\u2014\n\nHab\u00e1ge, 350 amunams paddy sowing extent\u2014(inclusive of) the royal village Band\u00faraketa of 25 amunams.\n\nVilb\u00e1wa, of 35 amunams.\n\nNayiliya, of 33 amunams.\n\nDembepola, of 12 amunams.\n\nMillowa, of 12 amunams.\n\nM\u00e9ssagammana, of 65 amunams.\n\nOf the 350, total number of villages, there are 12 royal villages belonging to the gamwasan pa\u00f1gu\u2014\n\nMaraluw\u00e1wa, of 65 amunams.\u2021\n\nBamunugedara, of 65 amunams.\n\nD\u00e9vagomuwa, of 20 amunams.\u00a7\n\n* Modern Vilb\u00e1wa, and once a royal city, known as Vilb\u00e1-nuwara. The Pretender in the rebellion of 1817\u201318 is said to have been a native of this village. There is a Buddhist temple here, which is largely resorted to by people of the district. \u00c1ndim\u00e1l\u00e9, a metrical composition, speaks of the king who reigned here, and Mr. H. Parker informs me that in the course of his reading he met with a reference to K\u00e1syapa as a ruler of this city.\n\n\u2020 Tittaw\u00e9lla. A Kadaimpota gives the dimensions of the city as 6 yodunu in length, 3 in breadth, and 6 in circumference, and states that it had 10,000 villages within it. Four slabs of rock marked the limits, surrounded by \u00c9t\u00e1, And\u00e1, and Wanagiriya rocks. Within the city were a college, a tank, a row of palaces, with which the city was adorned, and the city itself was sufficient to contain the inhabitants of a kingdom.\n\n\u2021 Now a vih\u00e1r\u00e9 gama.\n\n\u00a7 Modern Vewagedara.\nSiyambal\u0101\u1e45gomuwa, of 65 amunams.\nBiss\u014dvapattuwa (a tract).\nTittawella, of 65 amunams.\nTittawella Illukpi\u1e6diya, of 25 amunams.\nBand\u0101raketa, about 7 amunams.\nKalohagedara, of 12 amunams.*\nThis side of Kalohagedara, Handap\u0101ndunna (evidently so called owing to a moon and bow carved on the rock), 12 amunams.\nBordering Diggala, 12 amunams.\nBamunugama.\u2014A Brahmin village on the west of Kurun\u0113gala, 5 amunams.\n\nBelow it, on the banks of the Maguru-oya, is [the pond] Kunan-eba, so called owing to the royal palanquin having been buried there. From this eba, proceeding the distance of a mile, is Ran-munda-wala, so called from the gold ring [of the king probably] having fallen in and been lost here. Below Kimbuko\u1e6duwa is a stone bridge. To the south of the sleeping palace of the king, Nira-dol\u014dsb\u0101g\u0113. To the west thereof a stone-built well.\u2020 On the summit of Et\u0101-gala a stone-built pond. This side of Hunupola there is a stone-built well.\u00a7 These were the three places at which the king had his warm baths.\n\nInside the cave of the city rock there is carved the figure of a Vedd\u0101 boy holding a bow in each hand. In the cave in which this figure is carved are to be found 20,000 masuran, pieces of gold coin.\n\nOn the top of the wall on the summit of Et\u0101-gala is found the seat, like unto that of King \u015aakraya.\n\nIbb\u0101-gala Vih\u0101r\u00e9 was founded by Vidiya R\u0101ja.\nEt\u0101-gala Vih\u0101r\u00e9 by Devenipetissa. That Vih\u0101r\u00e9 was endowed with 3 amunams of paddy land, garden, and houses. On the stone at the threshold of that vih\u0101re, with Pusbad\u0113wa Terunn\u00e1nse, five hundred (priests) attained Rahatship.\n\n* Now a blacksmiths\u2019 village.\n\u2020 Probably the well at Polattapi\u1e6diya, from which a large section of the townsfolk draw their supply of drinking water.\n\u2021 This may be identical with R\u0101japihilla, or \u201cthe King\u2019s spout,\u201d on the Kandy road, the sole structural remnant of the royal city. It has been built up, and is a favourite public bath, and supplies drinking water to the town. The road leading to the bath is called after it.\nAngar-gala Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, which is to the west of the city, was endowed with Kaluwakotuwa, consisting of 7 amunams, as well as with the land which lies below the stone pillar on the east and below and above Mutu-pokuru-gala, and out of Vebo\u1e0da, 3 amunams.\n\nU\u1e0dattapola, of 12 amunams, was assigned to those who performed the office of conch-blowers to the city, as also Hab\u00e1g\u00e9, 12 amunams.\n\nThe following villages were required to supply salted meat (heli-mas-dena-gam) to the city:\u2014Yakalla, Doranapola, and Ibb\u00e1gomuwa.\n\nThe following villages to supply dried meat (polumas-dena-gam):\u2014Ma\u1e0dawa and Mehiyalla.\n\nThe following villages to supply salt (lunu-dena-petavilli-gam):\u2014Teliyagonna and Mallawapi\u1e6diya.\n\nThe following villages to supply the royal stores with trunks, winnows, baskets, beds, and chairs:\u2014Ahugo\u1e0da and Mayila.\n\nThe following villages to supply fresh milk (hu\u1e47-kiri):\u2014Heraliyavela, Malka\u1e0duvewa, Ya\u1e6davehera, Ketamuna, A\u1e6dakahavela, Nembilikumbura, and K\u00f3\u1e45gahagedara.\n\nClose to the city under the stone pillar standing in the galve\u1e6diya (stone fence), on which is carved the figure of a woman, lay buried 15,000 masuran. There are also the pictorial representations of four lions and four elephants.\n\nNavarat\u1e47a Man\u1e0dapaya was built by Boyagena Navarat\u1e47e Mudiy\u00e1nse, and Weneruvewa by Pusbad\u0119va Terunvah\u00e1nse. These two meritorious works were performed on the same day. Treasures consisting of golden beds, chairs, flags, spittoons, rings, pearls, and gems were buried (in the tank) at the depth of a nul-palama. By the power of the gods these treasures are invisible.\n\nTo expiate the sin committed by the burial of Appuh\u00e1mi of Boyagena [as a billa offering for the breach in the bund of the tank], the king built Galapi\u1e6da Vih\u00e1r\u00e9 at a cost of 15,000 masuran. On the rock on the bund an alms-offering\nwas given to the priests of the vih\u00e1r\u00e9, which was dedicated to the priesthood.*\n\nBetween the Kurun\u00e9gala tank and Wanah\u00e1-v\u00e9wa were the royal pinfold and dairy.\n\nAbove Ku\u1e0d\u00e1v\u00e9wa were the stables for the horses.\n\nIn Y\u00e1ntanpalawa were the stables for the elephants.\n\nAt Kavuddawatta was the stabling for the trained hunting buffaloes.\n\nAt Ri\u1e6digasy\u00e1ya the palanquin-bearers resided.\n\nThe villages assigned to supply jaggery to the city were Indulgo\u1e0dakanda, Moratenna, Gabbala, Parap\u00e9, and Hinguruuvaka, lying close to each other.\n\nThe following marked the gravets of the city:\u2014Kayik\u00e1vala, lying below Heraliyavala, Pilika\u1e0da, Maraluuv\u00e1ka\u1e0da, \u00darup\u00e1ka\u1e0da, Kalohagedara, Galapi\u1e6dagala, Kolamune-oya, Miv\u00e9wa, Wadaka\u1e0da [Kadawata].\n\nTo the four blacksmiths who accompanied King Vijaya were granted the following villages:\u2014Ka\u1e0du\u1e0dipi\u1e6diya, Kammaltota, Na\u1e6dand\u00fawa, Ve\u1e0dagama, Timmagama, Ayuwandana, and H\u00e9n\u00e9gedara.\n\nThe following (toyil-gam) were the villages assigned to the tom-tom beaters:\u2014Lindepitiya, Poramulla, and Talao\u1e6duwa.\n\nThe following (rad\u00e1-gam) to the dhobies:\u2014Ha\u1e45gawatta and Rad\u00e1pol\u00e1.\n\nThe following (badah\u0113la-gam) to the potters:\u2014Badah\u0113lagama and Budanapi\u1e6diya.\n\nK\u00f3npola is so called owing to a hut having been built on a k\u00f3n tree, living in which the original inhabitants founded the village.\n\n* Tradition has it that the bund of the Kurun\u00e9gala tank could never be kept in repair. The only way in which it could be done was by offering a billa, the sacrifice of a life. Appuh\u00e1mi volunteered to give his life on condition that the king would raise his son to an Adigarship. The king having assented, Appuh\u00e1mi was placed in the breach and buried alive, since when it is said the bund has not given way. In addition to the rank, money and lands, as well as the pa\u1e6da-bendi name of Navaratna, were bestowed on this officer. The effect of the billa must have passed away, for in 1877, in the course of certain repairs, the bund burst, and much damage was done to property by the flow of water.\nKing Vijaya bestowed the following villages on his ministers:\u2014K\u014dnpola, Tiregama, and Damunugoda.*\n\nTo the shield-bearer, Paliya Mohot\u1e6d\u0101la, was assigned the village Paliyagama, so called after the shield.\n\nTo the sword-bearer was assigned the village which is called after him, Ka\u1e0dugampola.\u2020\n\nTo the Brahmins who accompanied the king, to one was granted the village Bamun\u0101ko\u1e6duwa, to another Bamunussa, to a third Divulgaspitiya, and to a fourth Bamun\u0101vela.\n\nTo Het\u1e6di Basnayaka Mudiy\u00e1nse was assigned the village Ud\u0101digena, which lies to the west of Kurun\u0113gala.\n\nLying below it, Erabuduliya, was given to Band\u0101ra.\n\nDoratiy\u0101wa was bestowed on Vijayap\u0101la Mudiy\u00e1nse.\u2021\n\nTo Navaratna Mudiy\u00e1nse the village Boyagena was given.\n\nAkaragena to Akaragena Band\u0101ra,\n\nMillowa to the Adig\u0101r.\n\nGalgomuwa to Galgomuwa Mudiy\u00e1nse.\n\nM\u0101bopitiya to the Ha\u1e37uwadana Nilame.\n\nA king named Vijaya reigned in Hastipura during the time of Kakusanda Buddha, the said city lying at a distance of 400 gaws from Sinhapura. During the time of Kon\u0101gama Buddha this city was also ruled by Vijaya. During the time of K\u0101syapa Buddha also was this city ruled by a Vijaya, as well as in the time of Gautama Buddha. On account of this circumstance Kurun\u0113gala becomes, comparatively, the principal city of the thirty-five capitals in the Island of La\u1e45k\u0101.\n\n* The soil in all these villages is very fertile, there is a superabundance of water; but the present inhabitants are of the Beruvaya and Ch\u0101liya castes.\n\n\u2020 Modern Ka\u1e6dugampola, after which a Hatpattuva and a Koral\u00e9 take their names.\n\n\u2021 This was the founder of the Doratiy\u0101wa family. During the rebellion of 1848, Doratiy\u0101wa Rat\u00e9mahatmey\u00e1 of the Hiriy\u0101la hatpattu, a lineal descendant of the first-named chieftain, captured the Pretender, and was presented by the Government with a gold medal and chain for his meritorious services.

On the son by the Queen of M\u0113dak\u0113tiya\u2020 [a woman of the harem, yaka\u1e0da-doliya, cf. ra\u1e47-doliya], he bestowed his wealth, in consequence of which circumstance the prince was called Vastuhimi Kum\u00e1raya.\u2021\n\nEight hundred and ninety-five rulers reigned in Kurun\u0113gala: thirty kings by the name of Tissa, thirty by the name of B\u0101hu, and thirty by the name of Sinha.\u00a7\n\nVastuhimi was massacred, and the prince who was at Kalund\u00e1wa was installed in sovereignty under the title of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dita\n\n---\n\n* Modern Vilb\u00e1wa. The present incumbent of the temple says that the name of the village is derived from the half-moon-shaped pond\u2014vil-beva\u2014which lies a short distance from the temple.\n\n\u2020 Other accounts give Ass\u00e9duma as the native village of this woman.\n\n\u2021 Or Vathima Kum\u00e1raya, as he is sometimes called, was the Muhammadan usurper, who was hurled headlong from the top of Et\u00e1-gala by his dissatisfied ministers and killed. At the spot where his mangled corpse is said to have fallen stands the Galiband\u00e1ra shrine, which was erected to his memory by his co-religionists. Vathima Lane, which leads to the shrine, is called after him. For further particulars see \u201cThe Animal-shaped Rocks of Kurun\u0113gala.\u201d There is a picture of Vathima on one of the walls of the \u00darup\u00e1kada temple.\n\n\u00a7 This certainly looks fictitious compared with more authentic history.\nPar\u00e1kr\u00e1ma B\u00e1hu, and he removed the seat of Government to Dambadeniya.*\n\nIn Hastipura there were 700 sculptors, 700 masons, 800 dhobies, 900 elephants, 12,000 Tamils, 12,000 Sinhalese, 24,000 officers, 75,000 ministers, all of whom left Kurun\u00e9gala and settled at Dambadeniya, there living in glory like that of \u015aakra Dev\u00e9ndra. The king departed this life having reigned twenty-two years.\n\n*Kurun\u00e9gala* is derived from the fact of the settlement of the people of k\u00faru-ra\u1e6da, who were known as *Kuru-vit\u00ednay\u00f3.*\n\n* * * * *\n\n[Here follows a description of *Mundakondapola*, the city in which Prince Irugal Band\u00e1ra reigned.

The village is now a vih\u00e1r\u00e9gama.\n\n\u00a7 Modern Udakadura and Yatikadura.\nIrugal Band\u0101ra was so called owing to his having been born by the queen who was born out of the flower Dunuk\u0113-mala growing in the garden Dunuk\u0113-watta, and begotten of the Sun.\n\nKirimuna* received its name from the circumstance of milk having flowed out of the rock standing in that village for the use of the child.\n\nMah\u0101keliya, formerly Manakiriya.\n\nIrugal Band\u0101ra lived on Na\u1e6dagenakanda.\n\nDevagedara is so called from the construction of the tank.\n\nThe Prince Idirim\u0101na Kum\u0101raya resided at Bogo\u1e0da.\n\nPalanay Kum\u0101raya above Kelimuna.\n\nIrugal Band\u0101ra, whilst reigning at Mundakondapola-nuvara, sent for his mother, the queen, who was in Kurun\u0113gala, and having stopped the Sun in its course, an alms-giving was made, when Navagattar\u0101la, by the aid of the trained soldiers, massacred Irugal Band\u0101ra, who fell a victim to their sword.\u2020 Owing to this circumstance the people of Dewam\u0113da are considered disloyal.\n\nThe event was commemorated by the erection of a stone pillar, which was intended as a sign to prohibit the employment of men of this district in the service of the court.\n\nThe Navagatta man was tried and hanged for this demeanour at Rukattana. Of his accomplices, the Dikvehera man was impaled, the Ratkaravuwa man was tied to two posts brought near to each other, and torn asunder by the cords which bound the posts being severed.\n\nSince then Mundakondapola has been abandoned.\n\n* Modern Kelimuna.\n\n\u2020 Irugal Band\u0101ra was a powerful and independent prince, and tradition says that the king was jealous of the power and influence exercised by him. Accordingly a band of ruffians was employed to assassinate him. While the prince was preparing to bathe in the tank near Band\u0101rakoswatta he was slain by one of the assassins with his own sword. The head on being severed is said to have fallen on the rock, which formed part of the bund, and the rock was rent asunder. Owing to the circumstance the rock is called Pattaragala. Band\u0101rakoswatta (which Casie Chitty translates as 'the king's jak tree grove') was the place where Robert Knox and his father lived until the latter died.\nThe royal fields which were cultivated for King Vijaya out of the kingdom were\u2014\n\nIlukpitiya keta.\nHab\u00e1g\u00e9 keta.\nTalampitiya keta.\nIlukvela keta.\nPilessa Idirim\u00e1rayinne keta.\nIlukwela Kalingu Rajjuruwange keta.\nWattawallala Pitima Rajjuruwange keta.\n\u00darugala Du\u1e6dugamunu Rajjuruwange keta.\nGampola keta.\nDo\u1e37osb\u00e1g\u00e9 keta.\nPar\u1e0duwasa Rajjuruwange keta.\nD\u00e9digomatissa Rajjuruwange keta.\nVihinawe Dambadeni Rajjuruwange keta.\nHaragoma Gurude\u1e47iya Par\u00e1kama B\u00e1hu Rajjuruwange keta.\n\n[Reference is then made to the number of fields in the Tri-sinhala, or three ancient divisions of the Island, Pihi\u1e6di, Ruhunu, and M\u00e1ya, the extent covered by oyas, tanks, rocks, and forests, the lands submerged by inundations. The derivation of the divisions are given as follows: Ruhunu-ra\u1e6da was so called owing to the earth (ruhunu-pas) found there; M\u00e1ya-ra\u1e6da owing to the great wisdom and subtility of the inhabitants; and Pihi\u1e6di-ra\u1e6da owing to the sacred b\u00f3-tree having been planted there.]\n\nKurun\u00e9gala stands in the centre of these divisions.\n\nHiriy\u00e1la derives its name owing to hiriyal* having been found in the tract.\n\nDewamed\u00e1, owing to its situation between the D\u00e9duru-oya and the Maguru-oya.\u2020\n\n* Hiriyal is sulphuret of arsenic, Arsenicum auripigmentum. It is of a reddish-yellow colour, and is largely used by the natives in painting. S\u00e1dilingam, vermilion, or mercury sulphide, which occurs native as cinnabar, the chief ore of mercury, is also used by natives for painting images. The hiriyal is sprinkled over the vermilion to give it a gloss. Both these substances are sold in the native bazaars. (Magazine of the School of Agriculture, Vol. 2, No. 2, p.17.) Hiriy\u00e1la gives the name to a Hatpattuva.\n\n\u2020 Dewamedi Hatpattuva is said to have been so called owing to its originally lying between the D\u00e9duru and Maguru oyas; but since the re-division of the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, only a portion of it is included by these rivers.

With this object he constructed irrigation works, cultivated large tracts of paddy land, and having collected the paddy, heaped it up in the shape of a high rock. He ordered his son to go to the summit, and asked him whether he could see the ocean and the sailing of ships. The son, fearing lest he would lose the heap of paddy, ascended to the top and replied that he could not, although he actually could see the ocean. The father, enraged at the disappointment, kicked down the heap, which was scattered all over the face of the country. The paddy, which had decayed and become reduced to flour (pi\u1e6di), having been found strewn on the meadows and rocks (gal), the country Pitigal-rata was so called.\n\n\u2020 In the reign of Wa\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa, 110 A.D., an incursion was made by the Malabars, headed by the king in person, who carried away 12,000 Sighalese as slaves to Mysore. Gaja B\u00e1hu, 113 A.D., avenged the outrage by invading the Soli, or Chola, country with an expedition which sailed from Jaffnapatam, and brought back not only the rescued Sighalese captives but also a multitude of Solians, whom the king established in various parts of the Island.

It has passed away\u2014\n\nThe cloud-capp\u2019d towers, the gorgeous palaces,\nThe solemn temples, the great globe itself,\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of a vision,\nLeave not a wreck behind.\n\nBut for the natural landmarks, such as \u00c9t\u00e1-gala, Ibb\u00e1-gala, and Kuruminiy\u00e1-gala, in the neighbourhood of which it is said \u201cthe noble city of Hathigiri lay,\u201d it would be impossible to identify even the site which it occupied upwards of seven hundred years ago.\n\nJudging by the physical bounds given in the Vistaraya, and the length, the breadth, and the circumference assigned thereto by Kadaim-pot, the city and its immediate surroundings must have embraced an area at least ten times that which is now covered by the modern town, recalling to mind the well-known lines of Coleridge:\n\nSo twice five miles of fertile ground\nWith walls and towers were girdled round:\nAnd there were gardens bright, and sinuous rills,\nWhere blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;\nAnd here were forests ancient as the hills,\nEnfolding sunny spots of greenery.\n\nNowhere can be found a description of the city and its palaces, but an adequate idea may be formed of the magnificence and splendour which characterised the city from the graphic account which the Mah\u00e1wans\u00e1 (Chapter LXXXV., vv. 62 and 63) records of some of the temples.\nThese temples evidently stood in the courtyard of the royal city, but none of the descriptions given in the Vistaraya or Mah\u00e1va\u1e47sa apply to the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 now standing at the foot of Et\u00e1-gala or to that on Ibb\u00e1-gala, the building of which tradition assigns to pious King Dev\u00e1nampiyatissa, and in whose precincts there is a copy of the \u015arip\u00e1da, said to have been made to accommodate a princess who could not undertake the pilgrimage to Adam\u2019s Peak to worship at the original; nor do they apply to those at Wandur\u00e1-gala, Vilb\u00e1wa, \u00darup\u00e1kada, or Maraluw\u00e1wa.\n\nWhile the Vistaraya refers to the heterodox d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9s, the Mah\u00e1va\u1e47sa makes mention of the orthodox vih\u00e1r\u00e9s which raised their sacred fanes within the enceinte of the city\u2014a system which prevails to the present day, by which those edifices are built in close contiguity, and within the same enclosure.*\n\nThe greater portion of the modern town was evidently the site of the royal palaces, which doubtless stood on the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa grounds and the Kachch\u00e9ri premises, the sleeping palace of the king being only twelve fathoms from Kuruweniyagala; and the upper and lower courts, U\u1e0da and Pahalawahala, being identical with the modern Udawalpola and Pall\u00e9walpola; while the site of the majority of the temples might fairly be assigned to the modern Polattapi\u1e6diya; but alas!\u2014\n\nWhere holy ground begins, unhallowed end\nIs marked by no distinguishable line:\nThe turf unites, the pathways intertwine.\n\nJudging by the lay of the land, it is quite possible that the waters of the Kurun\u00e9gala tank submerged all the marsh lying between the Dambulla road and high ground above the modern tennis courts in the M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa premises. There was a high bank along the line now taken up by Sharpe Road and a portion of R\u00e1japhihilla Road, which probably in days gone by formed the basis of an embankment or stone wall.\n\n* Oriental Monachism, Chap. XXIX.\nThe removal of the seat of Government to Dambadeniya in 1346, and the gradual desertion of Kurun\u00e9gala by the nobles and chiefs, who assembled at the new capital, reduced the city of Hatthigiri to ruins, its villages to desolation, and its cultivated lands to wilderness and jungle, the population dwindling down to a handful of Dur\u00e1v\u00f3s.*\n\nFrom the necessities of their position neither the Portuguese nor the Dutch saw much of the interior of the Island, much less that portion of it known as the Kandyan Provinces, and discouraged travellers of other nations from visiting or describing it. So that Kurun\u00e9gala lay buried in its insignificance, not even receiving a passing notice from that veracious chronicler Robert Knox, who, as well as his father, was a captive in the district, and the latter of whom died and was buried at Bandarakoswatta. It remained in that humble condition until the memorable year 1815, when the Union Jack was hoisted at Kandy, and the establishment of the British dominion in the interior was proclaimed by the cannon of the city, and Kurun\u00e9gala was once more selected as the next place of importance to the mountain capital.\n\nThe military records of 1815 are unfortunately not forthcoming, but there is abundant evidence to show that shortly after the Kandyan Convention Kurun\u00e9gala was created a military post.\n\nOne of the earliest structures in Kurun\u00e9gala during the time of the British was the Cantonment. Lieutenant-Colonel Campbell, who was Commandant at Kurun\u00e9gala and Judicial Agent of the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, and devotes nearly the whole of the second volume of his work to his experiences in the district, describes the Cantonment as\u2014\n\nBuilt in the form of a square. In outward appearance the houses and bungalows are very like neat comfortable thatched cottages, and afford much better accommodation than I had cared for. The Commandant's house and offices occupy one side of the square, and have gardens behind them laid out with great neatness and regularity\n\n* Casie Chitty's Gazetteer, pp. 145\u20138. [Kurun\u00e9gala, as the capital, was abandoned for Gampola about A.D. 1347.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.]\nby my predecessors in the command of the district. There are several good-sized rooms in the house, all upon the ground-floor. * * * The other sides of the square are occupied by the houses of the officers and troops, guard-house, &c. At a short distance from the cantonment there is a bazaar.*\n\nThe exact site of the cantonment cannot be determined upon, but such data as \"the rocky mountains rising abruptly and close to the cantonment,\" and the existence of \"Parade Street,\" point to the conclusion that it lay in the vicinity of, or at least the greater part of it covered the grounds now occupied by, the Judge's quarters and the timber depot.\n\nThe Kachch\u00e9ri (at least the nucleus which has since been enlarged and improved into the present substantial and commodious structure) was doubtless contemporary with the cantonment. In 1848 the rebels, whilst endeavouring to break open the vault, which is said to have contained \u00a31,500, were surprised by the troops from Kandy under Lieutenant Annesly. The marks of the axes used by the rebels are still to be seen on the door-shutters of the vault.\n\nThe M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa was in building in the time of Campbell on the very spot where of old stood the palace of the kings. The present structure with its appurtenances was erected on the old site in 1880. The grounds, which are well laid out, remind one of an English park.\n\nWesleyan Chapel.\u2014Shortly after Campbell's arrival at Kurun\u00e9gala the troops were busy constructing a temporary place of worship for Europeans, which it was thought would answer until a permanent chapel was constructed. Sir Edward Barnes, Governor, on a visit to Kurun\u00e9gala, gave permission for the erection of a mission school and chapel on\u2014\n\nA piece of rising ground, about 600 feet in circumference, in the centre of the population, and surrounded on all sides by public roads.\n\nThe site is further described as\u2014\n\nHalf encircled with tremendous rocks, which are clothed with verdure in most places to the very summit, and often saluted by clouds. Their bases are covered with mighty forests to the edge of\n\n* Excursions, Adventures, and Field Sports in Ceylon, Vol. II., pp. 5, 6.\nthe town, which is bounded on the other side by fine rice fields and some of the most beautiful gardens, producing all kinds of vegetables and flowers.\n\nThe building with the view it commanded is thus described:\n\nA road only separates our garden from the great rock behind it, which is a delightful shelter in some seasons, and always a beauty. The front of the building is quite open, and commands a view of the whole cantonment across a small valley. The two sides of the house command the most enchanting view of near and distant mountains, fields, and woods. From the front of the house the garden lies on a slope, and is bounded by another new road.\n\nThe chapel was in the centre of the principal buildings, with rooms at each end, and the whole was finished in the best style and kept in the neatest order. The entire cost was Rds. 3,300. The chapel was opened on the 20th of December, 1821, by the Rev. Mr. McKenney, who preached an impressive sermon from Matt. vi., 16, \u201cThy Kingdom come.\u201d The Rev. Robert Newstead was the incumbent. By successive grants the mission premises extended to 321 ft. by about 200 ft. in the widest part. In 1829 Kurun\u00e9gala was struck off the roll of the Wesleyan Mission, and the premises sold to Government to be utilised as a court-house, reserving its use for divine service whenever required.*\n\nThe chapel evidently stood just above the present Police Court, and a venerable almond tree towers over, and almost covers with its outstretching branches, the site which the chapel and mission house once occupied. At present only a few scanty remnants of the foundation are visible, while the cocoanuts planted by the Rev. Mr. Newstead are now stately palms. There was a quaint slab of rock in the burial ground on the Kandy road, with the inscription \u201cZION HOUSE, 1821,\u201d which doubtless formed part of the doorway of the chapel.\n\nThe Mosque, at the corner of the new road to the tank, as well as St. Ann\u2019s Roman Catholic Church, is coeval with the Wesleyan Chapel, and is referred to by Casie Chitty. During\n\n* Hardy\u2019s Jubilee Memorials, pp. 146\u20138.\nthe rebellion of 1848 the panic-stricken townsfolk took refuge in the latter place, which, strange to say, was not entered by the rebels.\n\nThe other buildings are of comparatively recent date.\n\nThe Wesleyans were allowed a plot of land 100 ft. by 90 ft. on the Kandy road to be used as a burial ground. After the mission was abandoned it was used by Christians of other denominations. It contains two interesting tombstones, one to the memory of Capt. Alex. McBean (ob. February 8, 1821, \u00e6t. 40 years), who was Agent of Government of Pahalado\u0142ospattu, Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, with modified jurisdiction under the 35th clause of the Proclamation of 1819, under superintendence of the Agent of Government of the Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s; and the other to the memory of Margaret (ob. March 4, 1824, \u00e6t. 49), wife of Major Andain, Her Majesty\u2019s 16th Regiment, Commandant at Kurun\u00e9gala. This burial ground was closed in 1868.*\n\nThe charm of the town of Kurun\u00e9gala lies in the unusual beauty of its position, resting as it does within the shade of Et\u00e1-gala, or the elephant rock, from which it derives its name. It has passed through manifold vicissitudes. Anon a royal city, it crumbled into the dust of a village of Dur\u00e1v\u00f3s, then elevated into the capital of a Province; it continues daily to rise in importance, and with the inestimable benefits of railway extension, it is beyond all doubt that the pride of a fabled splendour of a descent from the Sun, or a kindred relation to the Lion, is fast vanishing into the true glory, the real prosperity, and the solid advantages, commercial, moral, and intellectual, which the Kandyan Provinces have derived from their union with the British Crown.\n\n7.

The following Paper was read by the writer:\u2014\nTHE EPIC OF PARAKRAMA.\n\nBy the Right Reverend R. S. Copleston, D.D., Lord Bishop of Colombo, President.\n\nThe Paper which I have the honour to read requires some apology in this learned Society, as being concerned not with research, but only with criticism; yet the importance of the passage of literature which is my subject may, I hope, justify my attempt to place it before you in a popular light. For the history of Par\u0101krama is an important section of an important book.\n\nOf the native works of literature which Ceylon has produced, the Mah\u0101va\u1e47sa is, if I am not mistaken, by far the most important. I venture to claim for it even the high title of a classic. It consists, as is well known, of a history of the kings and of the Buddhist Community of Ceylon from the earliest days till the arrival of the English in Kandy; though the earliest portion, up to the third century B.C., is mere legend, and the latest portion a mere brief addition to complete the book. It is the work in parts of authors contemporary with the events which they relate, and in other parts of compilers who at intervals \"wrote it up to date\" from public records or from tradition. It is composed in P\u0101li verse, and in one metre (with trifling exceptions) throughout\u2014that common metre of long trochaic lines, in which all the principal Indian poetry is written.\n\nA work on this scale, and with this dignified purpose, stands on the higher levels of literature;\u2014that is, if its structure, its contents, and its style are at all worthy of its pretensions. And as much as this may safely be said of the Mah\u0101va\u1e47sa. As history, it covers a long period\u2014more than twenty centuries: is on the whole trustworthy; and narrates events of importance: as literature, it is boldly planned and executed with fair consistency; and its narrative, while of very unequal merit, is at its best well arranged, graphic, dignified, and even beautiful. The\nlanguage in the best portions is easy and clear, and the metre\u2014one well adapted to narrative\u2014is used with admirable flexibility.\n\nWhile this may be said of the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 as a whole, its historical and its literary merits are not similarly distributed\u2014one part excels in historical value, another in literary charm. Without now inquiring which portions are most valuable as history, or even what is the degree of historical value of the section which concerns Par\u0101krama, I may certainly treat this section as standing among the highest in literary merit.\n\nI ought here to say how greatly I am indebted to the Sinhalese translators, Sumangala Terunn\u00e1ns\u00e9 and the late Pandit Ba\u1e6duvantud\u00e1w\u00e9, and to the English translator, L. C. Wijes\u012bgha Mudaliy\u00e1r. I have not actually borrowed from their works (with a small exception) the translations which I shall quote, but I could have done nothing without them. For the identification of the few places to which I have referred, I am indebted to the learning and courtesy of V\u0113livitiya Dhammaratana Terunn\u00e1ns\u00e9 of the Vidyodaya College.\n\nPar\u0101krama the First, justly called Par\u0101krama the Great, who flourished in the latter half of the twelfth century of the Christian era, is the most prominent figure in Ceylon history, and the hero par excellence of the Sinhalese nation. There is only one name that can rival his, that of Du\u1e6d\u1e6dha-g\u0101mini, who drove out the invaders of his country fourteen centuries before, and whose figure on the historic canvas is invested with even more romance, but with far less of reality. The chapters which treat of Du\u1e6d\u1e6dha-g\u0101mini are highly poetical, but they are altogether a slighter matter than the long and detailed section which records\u2014and, as I believe, with much historical accuracy\u2014the exploits of the later hero.\n\nIt is not as history, however, whether accurate or otherwise, that I am considering this section of the Mah\u0101vans\u0101 to-night, but as a poem, or material for a poem. I propose to show in what degree it has the qualities of an epic poem, in unity and dignity of subject, and imaginativeness and beauty of\ntreatment. On the former of these two points I expect to convince you easily that the subject had in it, in an eminent degree, the \"makings\" of an epic; and I think also, as to treatment, that the writer was not unconscious of the opportunity which his subject gave him, but saw its greatness, grasped it to some extent as a whole, and was elevated to something of the standpoint of a poet by the impression which it made upon his imagination. The vivid conception which he had formed of the person and career of his hero gives to his work both unity and poetic interest.\n\nOf that magnificent figure and those splendid exploits the author was, I think, an eye-witness. Three considerations lead me to conclude that he was a contemporary: first, and chiefly, the fulness of detail in the whole narrative of Par\u00e1krama's life. Secondly, that, in contrast with this, his death is not recorded. It is only said that he reigned thirty-three years; and between this reference and the main record of his life there is a break in the continuity of the work, chapter 78 being in the main a repetition of what has been already stated in chapter 73, and both 78 and 79 being rather retrospective summaries than contemporary narrative. At that point,\u2014between chapter 77 and chapter 78\u2014as I conjecture, a later writer took up the pen after Par\u00e1krama's death. A third reason for thinking that our author was a contemporary is, that the closing lines of chapter 77 are written in the present tense\u2014a thing which I have not noticed in the conclusion of any other chapter.\n\nIf this is the case, our author stood too near his subject for an epic poet's purpose. Its details were too close to him: he could not see his hero's life a whole. And the consequences of this disadvantage are evident in his work. It is too often an accumulation of details, and wanting in breadth of treatment. But although the author either could not, because a contemporary (as I think), or did not, from want of grasp, allow details to be sufficiently merged in broad effect, I still think he did to a great extent grasp Par\u00e1krama's career as a whole. If he had been asked to state in what\nPar\u00e1krama's greatness lay, he would have replied: \"He brought all L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101 under one rule.\" That was Par\u00e1krama's great exploit; that was the great action which gives unity to his history. He brought all L\u0101\u1e45k\u0101 under one royal canopy, made it one nation again. Our author recognises this in a true patriotic spirit. He genuinely rejoiced in the unity and greatness which had been restored to his native country; and the monarch who had achieved it was not only the master whose deeds it was his business to record, but was enthroned in his imagination, the hero of his heart.\n\nHe is not describing a monarch alone, but a popular hero; a well-known and well-loved character, whose fun and love of sport, whose kindliness of heart, as well as his reckless daring, had endeared him to every man in his dominions. In using these terms I am but putting into modern language what breathes throughout these chapters, though it finds a very different expression. I fancy I perceive in them, in spite of the conventional turns of phrase, the feeling which in a modern might have prompted the exclamation:\n\nOh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,\nAs our sovereign lord King Henry, the hero of Navarre!\n\nThe hero's earlier days, with their rough fun and incessant adventure, were evidently regarded, in the popular mind, with the same sort of homely affectionate admiration with which the English remembered the boisterous youth of Henry V., to whom\u2014though here I must be forgiven as an Englishman for putting in the proviso, *si parva licet componere magnis*\u2014Par\u00e1krama is a Sinhalese parallel. Thus the hero's well-marked personality, and the achievement of one transcendent action, made it possible for our author, though standing too near to him in time, to grasp his career as a whole, and to be sensible of its poetical value.\n\nTo the disadvantage for poetical purpose, of too great nearness to the events, I attribute in part the fact\u2014which can hardly be disputed\u2014that the earlier portions of the life are more interesting than the later. These earlier portions are\nalso\u2014and this is a point to which it is important for me to call attention\u2014cast in a conventional form. They are modelled according to the received patterns of Indian poetry, with incidents which, from the R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a onwards, are attached to the birth and youth of heroes.\n\nIt is in this form that I prefer in the first instance to state the fact which I will now state in another shape.\n\nThe earlier part of the life of Par\u00e1krama bears a remarkable likeness to the stories of the life of Gotama in its later forms, as told, for instance, in the Lalita Vistara. His birth was announced, to a father who had long been praying for a son, by a glorious messenger from heaven. The accomplishment of the prophecy was intimated by the appearance of a beautiful white young elephant entering the chamber where his mother lay. On his birth supernatural signs appeared, and all nature was filled with joy. Sages, interpreting the signs which accompanied his birth, and the marks which were found upon his person, announced his future power. He would be able, they said, to bring not only all Lank\u00e1, but even all India under one dominion. But there was one sad prophecy, as there was in the case of Gotama, amid all these brilliant auspices. The father\u2014not, as in Gotama\u2019s case, the mother\u2014was soon to die. The young prince was brought up after the pattern of the Indian princes; soon mastered the Vedas and all the arts, and became accomplished in horsemanship, sword-play, and archery; and when he had been removed after his father\u2019s death to his uncle\u2019s court, lived there in great ease and pleasure, the object of the king\u2019s unwearied care and love. But from this pleasant home a noble resolution called him forth. He feared that he might lose, amid those pleasures and comforts, the aspiration which he felt kindled in him to raise his father\u2019s house from its obscurity and make all La\u1e45k\u00e1 one. In the enthusiasm of this high purpose, he departed by stealth, at night, alone; and the very term is used of his \u201cgoing forth,\u201d which has been represented for English readers, in the case of the Buddha, as \u201crenunciation.\u201d\nThe closeness of the parallel is obvious. I have hinted at two alternatives for its explanation. Did the writer of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 consciously\u2014and intentionally delight to trace, as he thought, in his hero's history a faint copy of that of the object of a Buddhist's veneration? Or is the case rather that these incidents were so essentially part of the stock-in-trade of the biographer of heroes, as to have attached themselves inevitably in the poetic tradition, first to the name of Gotama, and afterwards to that of Par\u0101krama? It is certain that some of the features are as old as the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nWe read in that poem that to Dasaratha, the father of R\u0101ma, when he had been \"engaged in austerities with the view of having sons born to him,\" and had offered in particular the horse-sacrifice with that object, there appeared a mighty being, as messenger of Paj\u0101pati, and announced to him that he should have a son (1, 44). There was no elephant in his case, but on his birth celestial music sounded, and flowers fell from heaven. And the youth of course was brought up in the same accomplishments of riding, swordsmanship, and archery. On the whole, it seems to me more likely that the writer, familiar with the Indian epics, and also, of course, with the lives of Gotama, could not help constructing his narrative upon the well-known framework, than that he was consciously parodying a biography which to him was sacred.\n\nHe was not, however, so much of a Buddhist as some of his predecessors or as his successor among the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 writers. In his chapters the morals, drawn from every king's death or conduct, about the lesson of the worthlessness of perishable things, are few, and less earnest. There is a great contrast, for instance, between this:\n\nEven so all the riches that men lay up for themselves by much suffering are lost in a moment; yet alas! foolish men set their heart on them alone\u2014\n\nwhich I take from Mr. Wijesinha's translation of one of the\nearlier chapters;* and this which follows on the record of Par\u00e1kr\u00e1ma's acts of secret policy, when he was spying out the country which he intended afterwards to conquer:\n\nThus do all the endeavours of beings endued with the power of meritorious deeds heaped up in former births meet with no hindrance, but are crowned with success. Let, therefore, the prudent man take this to heart, and become diligent in the performance of good deeds.\u2020\n\nIn some places (as at the end of chapter LXV.) the moral is conspicuous by its absence. On the other hand, records of Hind\u00fa customs and ceremonies are frequent.\n\nI have already had occasion to sketch very briefly the narrative of the hero's youth, and although there are lines here and there which rise quite to the level of poetry,\u2014in the description, for instance, of the reception of the elephant by Queen Lil\u00e1vati, and of the gladness of nature at the prince's birth,\u2014it is not until we come to his resolution to quit the pleasures of his uncle's court that we meet with a passage which lends itself to quotation.\u00a7 The prince had been considering how little men of high station especially ought to value life, in comparison with glory that cannot die. He called to mind not only the exploits recorded in the Ummagga J\u00e1taka, but those of R\u00e1m\u00e1 and of the heroes of the Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata, and that of the Br\u00e1hman by whom the royal race of Magadha was raised to power. \"All these,\" he cried, in verses which in the original are of remarkable eloquence:\n\nAll these great deeds, though the doers are here no longer, are famous in the world to this very day. Life is worth living to those who have the capacity to achieve a rare and surpassing career like theirs. For me, born in Kshatriya race, if I do not something worthy of Kshatriya heroism, vain will my life be. They were blest, it is true, with times far more favourable; but in wisdom and all other gifts why should they be better than me?\n\nTo understand the purpose to which the young prince was devoting himself we must glance at the condition of Ceylon at that time.\n\n* Mah\u00e1w\u00e1ngsa, chap. XLVIII., 160.\n\u2020 Ibid, chap. LXVI., 158.\n\u2021 Ibid, chap. LXIV., 39 et seq.\nThe land was divided (after the death of the illustrious Vijaya B\u00e1hu, who was contemporary with William the Conqueror) by the dissensions and intrigues of the royal family, into four parts.\n\nOver the northern kingdom, of which Pulatthi, or Polonnaruwa, was the capital, Gaja B\u00e1hu, a cousin of Par\u00e1krama, was reigning at the time of our story. This was still looked on as the principal kingdom, the true Sinhalese throne.\n\nThe southern part of the Island, which in the palmy days of the united monarchy had been administered by one subordinate prince, was now divided into three so-called kingdoms under M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, our hero's father, and his two brothers.\n\nUnder this divided government and these weak rulers the condition of the country had not been happy. These rulers lived, the historian tells us, like village headmen, without dignity and without ambition. They made no attempt to fulfil the opportunities of their office to the good of others and their own; but with hearts set only upon cruelty were utterly gone out of the path of duty.\n\nIt does not appear that these chieftains were in any true sense kings over large provinces, or that their provinces put together covered the whole of Southern Ceylon; on the contrary, the three places in which they are respectively said to have reigned are all (according to Dhammaratana's identification) in the southern Bintenna, the low-country of \u00dava, in the triangle between Passara, Balagoda, and Hambantota.\n\nSa\u0144khatthali, where our hero was born, is identified with the modern Alupota in Wellassa, which is also called M\u00e1lig\u00e1tenna, and where there are still ruins of a palace. There is now a resthouse there, a few miles, as the crow flies, south-east of Passara. His father's little dominion reached southwards at least as far as Pu\u0144khag\u00e1ma or Pilagama, believed to be now Galg\u00e9, on the border between the Buttala and Kataragama districts. His uncle Vallabha had his chief city somewhere in the Kolonn\u00e1 K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and Sirim\u00e9gha, his other\nuncle, at Mahan\u00e1gakula, now M\u00e1gala or N\u00e1gala, in Buttala Pattuwa. On the death of Par\u00e1krama\u2019s father this uncle took his place, and it was with him that our hero was living (near, as I have said, to Passara) at the time at which we have arrived. But this small province did not satisfy Par\u00e1krama\u2019s ambition. His ambition was to regain the northern kingdom, the ancient seat of power, which his cousin Gaja B\u00e1hu now occupied. He did not seek to win it for himself, but for his uncle and foster-father. Against his other uncle, Vallabha, who shared the south, he had apparently no designs: he probably foresaw\u2014what did occur, though only after a long struggle\u2014that whoever ruled the north and a part of the south could not fail ultimately to regain the remainder of the south. His definite aim therefore was to gain Po\u0142onnaruwa and the rest of Gaja B\u00e1hu\u2019s kingdom. He was content to set about this patiently, and not to make the attempt till he had trained soldiers and captains, and collected war materials and money. He would begin by making himself acquainted with the extent of Gaja B\u00e1hu\u2019s strength, and the degree of attachment of his ministers and people. The object therefore of Par\u00e1krama\u2019s setting forth was to spy out the northern kingdom, and at the same time to train a body of followers who should be devoted to his person, and have implicit confidence in his fortune.\n\nOur author is careful to show how deliberately the prince set himself to form a little band of immediate followers, to impress them with his determination, convince them of his invincible courage, and perhaps to commit them to his cause.\n\nThis latter aim\u2014to commit his followers to his cause\u2014probably explains a step on which the writer lays emphasis, though it is not altogether to the hero\u2019s credit. On leaving his uncle, the prince went into the district near Badalatthali, or Badulla, which was under the care of a certain general named Sa\u0144kh\u00e1, whose guests both king and prince had lately been. This general very properly hesitated to encourage the young prince\u2019s escapade, and was trimming very judiciously between pleasing the prince and pleasing the king. He\nentertained the nephew well, but meanwhile communicated with the uncle. Par\u00e1krama, perceiving this duplicity, at once had the general put to death\u2014an act calculated to convince Gaja B\u00e1hu that he was disaffected towards his uncle, and to commit his own men to his cause,\u2014but one which could not, without a good deal of explanation, be divested of the appearance of rebellion. After this it became necessary for the prince to lead for a time a life not far removed from that of an outlaw; and this gave him of course the best opportunities for winning the hearts of his men. He astonished them by displays of courage such as the following:\n\nWhen he had dwelt there some days, the inhabitants of the province gathered from every side, thinking \"We will capture this prince,\" and pouring in great excitement incessant showers of arrows, they surrounded the village and opened fight with ardour. The soldiers who had come in the prince's train, professing that they would lay down their lives in case of need, were now distracted with fear; and except the men who bore the prince's state canopy and his sword they all fled hither and thither, in the very sight of the royal youth. When he saw his comrades thus flying, he smiled quietly, and seeing here an opportunity to display courage at its height, \"With my weapon alone,\" thought he, \"I will terrify and put to flight the foe.\" \"Bring me a sword!\" cried the prince with a sudden shout, and at that strong deep utterance of his, forthwith his soldiers, as they heard the sound of the trumpet-shell of victory spread through the circuit of the regions, saw the heads of some of the enemies' warriors fall severed to the ground. Then those who before were fleeing stopped and turned, and fought and routed that force of many thousands; then they gathered round the prince with homage, and praised the heroic deed that he alone had done.\n\nHe entered with zeal into field sports, and took part in boyish games even in the midst of danger, as the following passage indicates:\n\nSo all full armed these mighty ones, like the host of M\u00e1ra, set forth in fury along the road which the spies pointed out. At all the four quarters they entered the village and on every side surrounded the prince's house. The prince, clad in a red blanket on account of the extreme cold, was sitting playing at a game such as young men love. Made aware by the loud noise that the foe was close at hand, and seeing not one of his own attendants at that moment, he tightened the knot of hair upon his head, and clad as he was with the blanket, wrapped it very closely round him, and with sword in hand, in terrible guise,\nhe went forth into the midst of the conflict like a maned lion among elephants. In a moment the foes were flying in all directions (every foeman was facing a different way).\n\nOf his audacity as well as his love of a joke, the following is related:\n\nHe sent for one of Gaja\u2019s generals, from a certain Kal\u00e1v\u0113wa (I do not see how it can be the well-known place far in the north), by name G\u00f3kanna Nagaragiri, that he might learn how far he was loyal to that king. The general knew already enough of Par\u00e1krama to obey, but not unnaturally\u2014after the Badulla general\u2019s fate\u2014he came with a large bodyguard and not without anxiety. Par\u00e1krama received him with all honours, and provided him with the best of lodgings. But in the night G\u00f3kanna dreamed a dream. He thought he saw his couch surrounded by armed men come to kill him. With a cry of terror he leapt (or fell) out of bed, and regardless of his troops and attendants, his sword and his standard, he ran into the jungle, where he wandered about till dawn; and as soon as he could see the way rushed off to his own village. His soldiers followed in equal panic and arrived by different paths at K\u00e1lav\u00e1pi. And when the prince heard the tidings of this flight, he laughed and (remained there a short time). He was very fond of conversation, and in those days whenever he was overcome with fatigue there was nothing like this story to drive his fatigue away.*\n\nAfter no very long time spent in these preliminary adventures he made his way northward, not without contests, to the borders of his cousin\u2019s kingdom. His entering those borders for the first time was a critical moment, and the poet has not failed to emphasize it by a touch which unfortunately our English translator has omitted. He entered it with a bound\u2014ra\u00f1\u00f1o ra\u1e6d\u1e6dhasim\u0101\u1e47i samulla\u1e45ghiyup\u00e1gami\u2014as C\u00e6sar put spurs to his horse and leapt over the Rubicon.\n\nKing Gaja B\u00e1hu, though not quite undisturbed at the manner of the young prince\u2019s approach, persuaded himself\n\n* Mah\u00e1va\u1e47sa, chap. LXVI., 35\u201356.\nthat he must be come in peace and in jealousy of the uncle whom he had left, and welcomed him heartily. Par\u00e1krama\u2019s life at his cousin\u2019s court was a triumph of dissimulation, but it is a remarkably picturesque scene. Not only did he ingratiate himself with the king, for whom he obtained his own sister\u2019s hand, and with all his nobles, but he went continually about among the common people, entering with sympathy into all their needs, and, without appearing to do so, fostering all their grievances. A device which he used for gaining access, without appearing to seek it, to their houses is too curious to be left unnoticed. He kept a tame elephant which he trained to run at him; and when he was near the house of a person whom he wished to win, he would pretend to be charged by the elephant, and would run for shelter into the house.\n\nThe list of his spies is amusing, and shows us what were the classes of itinerant traders and performers in those days.\n\nThat he might learn exactly who among the inhabitants of the outlying portions of the king\u2019s domains were attached to him and who were disaffected, he looked out men who were clever in many devices and skilled in the languages of various countries, and also foremost in loyalty; and among them, such as were learned in poisons he sent about in the guise of snake-charmers. Some the ingenious prince made fortune-tellers (from marks on hand, &c.); some as harp-players in the guise of Cand\u00e1las or Brahmans. From among Tamils and others he chose a great many skilled dancers and singers, and sent them about as showmen of leather puppets and other entertainments. Some he sent about as pedlars offering rings, bangles, glass beads, and such-like goods for sale.\n\nSome were to equip themselves with umbrella and staff or walking-stick, and so on, and assume the likeness of ascetics, and like faithful devotees to go from village to village as if to pay their homage at shrines.\n\nOthers assumed the parts of itinerant teachers to teach letters or the use of arms to children; others went as physicians, some were alchemists, some sorcerers, and some goldsmiths and the like.\n\nSome of these spies, who went as Buddhist monks, found their way into houses, entered into close intimacy and confidence with the\ninmates, by whom they were maintained and waited on, and obtained the position of moral instructors and guides. In this capacity they undermined the loyalty of those persons, and gave such counsel as should bring them under their own influence.\n\nThe result of all this policy was, that in course of time Par\u00e1krama had become acquainted with the mind of every courtier and almost of each commoner in the realm he desired to conquer, had friends in every corner of it, and knew every path in its forests.\n\nAcquainted as he was with the various kinds of paths, the prince ascertained exactly from hunters the way by which a force could enter the city and the way convenient for his own spies. Himself, too, roaming the forest near the city under pretence of hunting, could distinguish all the ways and byways by marks which he set.*\n\nAfter a time, when he felt any longer delay would be time lost, he returned to his uncle's court at Sa\u0144khatthali; but it was not long before Kitti Sirimegha died, and Gaja B\u00e1hu saw without apprehension his young friend established on the neighbouring throne.\n\nHis first care was to develop the resources of his country. He was extremely conscious of its smallness and poverty, but he seems at once to have taken in hand districts far beyond any of which we have heard as having been practically under his father's or his uncle's sway. From Adam's Peak to the sea, he is said to have placed his soldiers; he drained the marshes of the Pasdun K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and built a causeway (or anicut?) across the Deduru-oya in the Kolona\u00e1 K\u00f3ral\u00e9\u2014part of a system of irrigation works, ruins of which, Mr. Wijesin\u0331ha tells us, are still to be seen.\n\nIt is impossible not to admire the high conception of the duties of a ruler which is here set forth:\n\nAll throughout this realm that belongs to me, he said to his ministers, besides the many corn lands that are ripened by the water of the rain-clouds, the fields maintained in dependence on rivers whose waters fail not, and on mighty reservoirs, are few; and the kingdom includes very many rocky mountains and thick forests, and great far-stretching marshes. In such a land as this, surely not even the least\n\n* So both translations from N\u00e1n\u00e1sanketakamate.\ndrop of the water that the rain supplies should go to the ocean without bringing help to man. Except those places where the mines are of gems and silver and such-like precious things, in every other spot provision must be made for maintaining fields. Not to live for the people's good, but merely to enjoy the good things that have come to our hand,\u2014such a life is utterly unfit for men like me!\n\nAnd again\u2014\n\nLet there not stand in my realm in any spot whatever even the space of one small plot of ground that is not of use.\n\nHe had unbounded confidence in the capacity of human skill to redeem the desert into garden ground, and inspired his ministers with the same.\n\nMeanwhile he was collecting stores, and by the sale of gems (for the gem-producing part of the country was in his dominion) he was accumulating money; and he was training soldiers and captains. He was evidently convinced that the hope of a restored national unity lay in the training of native troops; he knew how ruinous was the system, which had come very largely into use, of depending on Velakk\u00e1ra or mercenary troops from among the Tamils (as their title Velakk\u00e1ra shows) and other races of the continent. Our author does not expressly state this, but he represents his hero as a Sinhalese to the backbone, who always preferred the homeborn to the foreign. Of this the striking episode of the Sinhalese sword is an illustration, though it occurs at a later period of Par\u00e1krama's career.\n\nAgain and again, with that prudence which the author delights to extol, side by side with his impetuous bravery, the king counted up his resources in men and material, and decided that the time for movement was not come; but at last it did come, and he entered on the great career of conquest. That career was not exhausted by the attainment of his immediate object, for after he had subdued the north of his own Island and erected his royal canopy over all La\u1e45k\u00e1, he had many rebellions at home to quell, and he carried his victorious arms, we are told, to the continent of India, and even to the far shores of Araccan.\nBut those later glories lie a little beyond my present scope: it is enough for our epic purpose to leave our hero with his foot upon his foes in La\u1e45k\u0101, and all that great future opening before him; for one evening's Paper at any rate it must suffice if I can conduct him in triumph to Pu\u1e37atthi.\n\nThe course of the campaign, if we could identify even a fair proportion of the places, would be very interesting as a study of geography, but it must be confessed that in other aspects it is tedious. Our author's battlepieces in this part are utterly inferior to those in which he describes the hero's later contest with M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana. In that part there is incident and detail, here there is neither, and the contrast is so marked that one is tempted to think of a difference of authors. I incline to think that the later contest took place in the author's neighbourhood, while of the earlier campaign he had only the official reports.\n\nIn this part at least the author seems to have no appreciation of the poetic value of vicissitudes of fortune. The record of uniform success is extremely tedious. This general defeated the foe at such a place; another general won a great victory at such a place; at another place Par\u00e1krama's general killed multitudes of the enemy; the foes came out to meet the king's forces at such a place but were utterly destroyed;\u2014and so on to an interminable length.\n\nIf a defeat has to be admitted it is mentioned briefly and obscurely. After Par\u00e1krama's forces had taken Pu\u1e37atthi and Gaja B\u0101hu was a prisoner, M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, the rival king of the south, came suddenly northward, joined his forces to those of the northern kingdom, and utterly defeated, as the author says, \"all that large host.\" The reader has some difficulty in assuring himself whether it was Par\u00e1krama's army that was defeated, for neither is his name mentioned, nor is the defeated force called the king's. Mr. Wijesinha has introduced the name of Par\u00e1krama into his translation (and very rightly, for it helps his reader), but he ought to have put it in brackets, that the reticence of the author might be seen.\nNor is there any description of battle scenes beyond the very slightest: not even is the cutting off of heads and limbs specified, as in the Indian epics; and there is very little bloodshed. This part of the work then is not a description of battles, but a list of victories; and has rather the appearance of having been worked up from an official report. In some places the names of the generals and the places where they fought are crowded into the verse just as thick as they can be packed.\n\nBut the tedious list of victories is interrupted by one noticeable touch of character and heroic incident. It struck the king, when he was halfway in the campaign, that he could disencumber himself of all his generals and take Pulatthi by himself, with no soldiers but the band of immediate followers whom he had personally trained.\n\nUnder the pretext of a summons to attend a festival of Buddha, which he had ordered one of his generals to arrange for this purpose in a place on the way towards Pulatthi, he proposed to leave his ministers and advance alone. But his generals saw through the scheme, and their loyal eagerness to be in the forefront of the campaign defeated the king's purpose. He advanced therefore with a well-organized force.\n\nI have mentioned that I owe the identification of the places to which I have referred to Dhammaratana Terun-nanse. I am myself unfortunately entirely unacquainted with that branch of the subject; but few inquiries of the kind would be more interesting than one which should result in a map of the country as it was in the twelfth century, with an itinerary of Par\u0101krama's marches. But even such information as I have enables me to draw your attention to a fact which cannot fail to interest. The scene of this royal history lay in exactly that region which an inhabitant of modern Ceylon, at any rate until a few years ago, would have been likely to select, if he had been asked to mention the least attractive and the most unhealthy portion of the Island\u2014the districts of Buttala, Wellassa, and Yatikinda in the Southern\nBintenna. In these districts, by the energy of Sir A. H. Gordon and Mr. F. Fisher, field hospitals have lately been established, and my colleague, Mr. Dunnett, is promoting schools. That this region was in Par\u00e1krama's time either very populous or highly civilized the Mah\u00e1wansa does not imply; but it implies a condition considerably in advance of that to which that country has now sunk; and I indulge the hope that the connection of which I am reminding you between these fever-stricken districts and the most illustrious name in Sinhalese history may contribute in some slight degree to promote their restoration.\n\nPar\u00e1krama conducted the war, as far as his own part in it went, with moderation; but he was not able altogether to restrain the violence of his soldiers, and this violence and rapacity gave rise to the one reverse which, as far as I have noticed, attended Par\u00e1krama's arms in this part of his career. The chiefs and inhabitants of the invaded country invited the assistance of M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, Par\u00e1krama's cousin, son of Vallabha, who still held one of the divisions of the southern country. This prince, though really insignificant, was weak enough to think that the crisis was his opportunity, and that he could first assist Gaja B\u00e1hu to repel Par\u00e1krama, and then step himself into Par\u00e1krama's position and defeat Gaja B\u00e1hu. He came northward suddenly, joined his forces to those of the northern king, and inflicted a severe defeat on the army of our hero (who seems at the time to have been in the south), and then treacherously seized Gaja B\u00e1hu, and proposed to put him to death.\n\nPar\u00e1krama soon repelled M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana, and of course had Gaja B\u00e1hu at his mercy; and the kingdom was then virtually his own. This gave the hero an occasion for the exercise of a splendid generosity. The defeated king Gaja, in despair of any other refuge, entreated the Buddhist monks of Polonnaruwa to intercede for him; and at their suggestion Par\u00e1krama gave back to his vanquished opponent the crown which had been the object of his whole life's enterprise, and returned to his own country.\nGaja made no attempt to take unfair advantage of this concession. He retired to another city, and made a solemn gift of the kingdom, by an inscription on a stone tablet in vih\u0101ra: \"I have given the royal country to Par\u00e1krama.\" Soon after this he died and Par\u00e1krama took possession of Pulatthi.\n\nThere was still a great deal of fighting to be done before M\u00e1n\u00e1bharana was finally subdued; and I am sorry to find myself obliged to dispose of it all in a single sentence. When the dominion of La\u1e45k\u00e1 was at length completely attained, then the magnificent works for which Par\u00e1krama's name is best remembered were still to be begun. That portion of his life, in which he exercised the power attained, is a distinct subject; the course of heroic action by which he attained it is all that I have tried to sketch to-night. It was given to him to unite the careers of a Julius and of an Augustus; we have followed him to the point at which the greater Roman's course was cut short, and leave our hero prepared to inaugurate the Augustan age of La\u1e45k\u00e1.\n\n6. Mr. Harward read the following statement with regard to the continuation of the series of Papers on \"The Ancient Industries of Ceylon,\"* by Geo. Wall, F.L.S., F.R.A.S., Vice-President:\n\nAfter a brief summary of the results of his earlier Papers, the writer stated that the problem to be solved was to ascertain the extent of the population of Ceylon in early times, and how they were occupied. The criterion to be employed was an estimate by an expert of the number of days' work required for the construction of some of the great public works carried out under the early kings. From a comparison of this number with the recorded time taken over the same works, it would be possible to infer the number of men employed. The writer showed in outline how such a calculation might be made, and how the numbers of the other sections of the population might be deduced from it.\n\n7. A vote of thanks to the Chair and to the writers of the Papers was passed on a motion proposed by Mr. Justice Lawrie.\n\n8. Sir E. Walker having acknowledged the vote of thanks to the Chair, addressed the Meeting, and endorsed the vote to the Lord Bishop and to Mr. Wall.

Arun\u00e1chalam. Mr. J. W. Seneviratna.\nHon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my. Hon. J. A. Swettenham,\nMr. S. G. Lee. C.M.G.\nMr. W. Pereira. Dr. W. G. Vandort.\nMr. W. P. Rajasinha. Mr. F. W. Vane.\nMr. E. S. W. Sen\u00e1thi R\u00e1ja.\n\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nVisitors:\u2014One lady and six gentlemen.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on August 11, 1893.\n\n2. It was announced that since the last General Meeting the following Member had been elected, viz., Mr. S. G. Lee.\n\n3. On a motion proposed by Mr. Harward, and seconded by the Hon. J. A. Swettenham, C.M.G., Vice-President, it was unanimously resolved, on the recommendation of the Council, \u201cThat a vote of condolence be passed on the death of Hon. Col. F. C. H. Clarke, R.A., C.M.G., &c., Vice-President, and that the sense of regret of the Society at the loss sustained be placed on record.\u201d\n\n4. Mr. Harward proposed \u201cThat Rule 18 be altered, by changing the first word five to four, thereby constituting four Members a quorum of the Council, instead of five.\u201d With regard to the alteration, he said the reason of it was not that there was any intention of revolutionizing the constitution of the Society, but simply because on more than one occasion Meetings of the Council had to be adjourned owing to the failure to get together a quorum.\n\nMr. Gerard Joseph seconded the motion, which was carried nem con.\n\n5. The following Paper was then read:\u2014\nCHILAPPATIK\u00c1RAM.\n\nBy the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n\nThis poem, known as Chilappatik\u00e1ram, is of great interest to the Ceylonese\u2014firstly, because it is the only Tamil work of any antiquity that refers to Ceylon after the period of R\u00e1vana; and secondly, because it is, so far as I know, the only one which records the history of Pattini, whose worship is more largely prevalent in this Island than anywhere else.\n\nNo apology is therefore needed for attempting a short account of (1) the author of this work; (2) the period at which he lived; and (3) the work itself.\n\nIt will be remembered that Southern India was in ancient times under the rule of three Tamil dynasties, known as the \"Ch\u00e9ras,\" \"Ch\u00f3las,\" and \"P\u00e1ndiyas.\"\n\n* The whole Tamil land in those times, according to the author of Chilappatik\u00e1ram, was between the sea on the east and west, Kumari (Comorin) on the south, and Tiruv\u00e9yka\u1e0dam on the north.\n\nThe three different dynasties ruled over the following regions, according to ancient authority:\n\n(1) The Ch\u00e9ra kingdom extended on the north to Palani, on the east to Tenk\u00e1si, on the south to the sea, and on the west to K\u00f3likk\u00fadu (Calicut); in length 80 k\u00e1tams.\n\n(2) The Ch\u00f3las land was bounded on the east by the sea, on the south by the river Vell\u00e1ru, ever engaged in strife with its shore, on the west by K\u00f3ddai\u03bakarai, and on the north by river Pennai; in length 24 k\u00e1tams.\n\n(3) The boundaries of the P\u00e1ndiyan Kingdom are, north Vell\u00e1ru, west Peru-veli [\"great plain\"?], south Kann\u00ed [\"virgin\" = Kumari], and east the sea; in length 56 k\u00e1tams.\n1.\u2014The Author.\n\nThe author of Chilappatik\u00e1ram was himself the younger son of the then reigning Ch\u00e9ra, and was known as \u1e2aan-k\u00f3-adjikal (\u1e2aam \u201cyoung\u201d; k\u00f3 \u201cprince\u201d or \u201cking\u201d; adjikal honorific term) and Ch\u00e9ra-mu\u1e47i. It is said of him that as he was one day sitting with his elder brother Chenkut\u1e6duvan by their father in the palace at the ancient city of Va\u1e45chi, an astrologer, being ushered into the presence of the king, looked at both the young princes, and pointed to the younger prince (our author) as the one who bore in his body the astrological marks indicative of kingship. Much disturbed by the thought that his elder brother\u2019s right of succession might be interfered with by reason of the astrologer\u2019s remarks, he at once renounced the world and lived the life of a mu\u1e47i (ascetic). Hence the name of Ch\u00e9ra-mu\u1e47i (\u201cthe ascetic of the royal house of the Ch\u00e9ras\u201d).\n\n2.\u2014The Period at which the Author lived.\n\nNow, when did he live?\n\nIn order to arrive at a conclusion upon this question we have to ascertain at what known period his poem was considered an ancient classic.\n\nWe know that the Tamil R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a was completed and recited by Kampan before the Academy of Literature in the Sak\u00e1pta (\u015aaka) year 808, equal to 886 of the year of Christ, on the authority of the well-known stanza recited on the occasion:\n\n* This shortly is:\u2014Kampan\u2019s R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a was recited or published (arayk\u00e9tta\u1e37) in the month of P\u0101\u1e47kuni (March\u2013April), on the day when the moon was in the constellation Hasta, after the Sak\u00e1pta year 807.\n\nHasta, according to Monier Williams, is part of the constellation Corvus and, according to the same authority, which tallies with our Tamil calendars, the \u015aaka era commenced in the 78th year of Christ.\nWe also know that 107 years before, i.e., in the year of Christ 779, the Tamil translation of the Sk\u00e1nda-pur\u00e1\u1e47a was published by Kachchhiyappar.\n\nBefore Kamp\u0101\u1e47\u2019s R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a and Kachchhiyappar\u2019s Sk\u00e1nda-pur\u00e1\u1e47a, the poem now under notice, viz., Chilappatik\u00e1ram, and some other works, such as Chint\u00e1ma\u1e47i, Manim\u00e9kalai, Ku\u1e47\u1e0dalak\u00e9si, and Valay\u00e1pati, which are all referable to about the same period, had acquired throughout the length and breadth of Tamil territory not only the reputation of being classics, but classics of ancient times. For works to have attained such a reputation in a conservative land like India, some centuries at least must have passed since their publication. I shall therefore be not far wrong in supposing that at the time of the Tamil Sk\u00e1nda-pur\u00e1\u1e47a (Anno Christi 779) these five poems were over five or six hundred years old. Mr. C. W. T\u00e1m\u00f3tharam Pillai,* formerly Judge of the High Court of Pudukk\u00f3ddai and one of the most enlightened Tamil scholars of our day, believes that Chint\u00e1ma\u1e47i was published about 1,800 years ago.\u2020\n\nThere is internal evidence in Chilappatik\u00e1ram itself to show that it was also composed about that time; for the author states that at his time Gaja B\u00e1hu of Ceylon was on a visit to the Ch\u00e9ra kingdom, and that on his return he introduced into Ceylon the worship of Pattini. The author refers to Gaja B\u00e1hu as having been the guest of his brother Chenk\u00fattuvan.\n\nThe Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nsa speaks of only two Gaja B\u00e1hus as having reigned in this Island. Which of them is referred to in the Chilappatik\u00e1ram?\n\nGaja B\u00e1hu I. is believed to have reigned circa 113 Anno Christi,\u2021 while Gaja B\u00e1hu II. reigned in 1142, long after the\n\n* Nachchin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, the well-known commentator, lived 1,200 years ago (cf. Mr. C. W. T\u00e1m\u00f3taram Pillai\u2019s Preface to Porulatik\u00e1ram), and wrote a Commentary on Na\u1e6dk\u00edrar\u2019s Tirumuruk\u00e1ttuppada\u00ed, which at his time was regarded to be an old poem; and Na\u1e6dk\u00edrar in his commentaries cites Chilappatik\u00e1ram.\n\n\u2020 Cf. Preface to Virach\u00f3liyam.\n\n\u2021 Turnour, Epitome, gives A.C. 109; Wijesinha Mudaliy\u00e1r, A.C. 113.\nTamil R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a was published. It is therefore clear that the reference in the poem is to the first Gaja B\u00e1hu.\n\nWe may therefore safely conclude that Chilappatik\u00e1ram, like Chint\u00e1ma\u1e47i, was written certainly more than eighteen centuries ago.\n\n3.\u2014The Subject-matter of the Poem.\n\nLet me now pass on to the subject treated in this poem.\n\nOn the eastern coast of Southern India, where the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri meets the Indian Ocean, was situate Puk\u00e1r, alias K\u00e1v\u00e9rip\u00fampatt\u00ednam, the \"City of Flowers,\" beloved of King Karik\u00e1l\u0101\u1e47. In this city lived two merchant princes, Mah\u00e1s\u00e1ttuva\u1e47 and M\u00e1n\u00e1yakkan.\n\nIt was arranged between these two that K\u00f3val\u0101\u1e47, the son of the former, should be married to Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai, the daughter of the latter. The marriage was celebrated with the pomp and ceremony befitting the wealth and rank of the parents; and the bridegroom of sixteen and the bride of twelve lived together happily for some years in a house built for them by K\u00f3val\u0101\u1e47's mother.* K\u00f3val\u0101\u1e47 unfortunately fell into the toils of a danseuse, M\u00e1davi by name, deserted his home and wife, and spent some years with her, losing all his immense fortune. Repenting eventually, he returned to his lonely wife and proposed that they should travel to Madura, the capital of the P\u00e1ndiyas, and sell Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai's priceless anklets, and with the proceeds thereof retrieve their lost fortune by trade. The faithful wife, always obedient, agreed, and after several adventures in the course of a journey of many days they reached Madura. Leaving his wife in the house of a shepherdess, K\u00f3val\u0101\u1e47 paced the streets of Madura with the view of selling one of her anklets. He met a goldsmith and showed him the anklet, and the goldsmith, who was a thief of the first water, and who was already under suspicion of having stolen an anklet belonging to the queen\n\n* Note here the custom of young married people quitting their parents' houses soon after marriage and living by themselves\u2014a custom which among us Tamils has now fallen into disuse.\nof Madura, desired K\u00f3valan to remain where he was, promising to mention to King P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya that the anklet, which was only fit for a queen, was for sale. The villain went at once to the palace and informed the king that he had discovered the thief who had stolen the queen's anklet. The king, without inquiry, ordered his guards to behead K\u00f3valan if he was in possession of the queen's anklet, and he was accordingly beheaded. Kannakai having heard of this calamity, proceeded to the palace, taxed the king with injustice, and complained that her husband had been beheaded without any investigation; and her transcendent virtue caused a part of Madura to be burnt down. Fourteen days after her husband's death she herself ascended the heavens.\n\nThe poem consists of Padikam, Uraiperukatturai, and three parts:\n\nI.\u2014Puk\u00e1r-k\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0dam, relating to the birth, marriage, and life of K\u00f3valan and Kannakai at K\u00e1v\u00e9ripp\u00fampa\u1e6d\u1e6din\u00e1m, up to the time of their departure to Madura.\n\nII.\u2014Madurai-k-k\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0dam, a recital of the events at Madura up to the attainment of Svarga by Kannakai.\n\nIII.\u2014Va\u00f1chi-k-k\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0dam, where are related the subsequent events, such as how some Vedd\u00e1s saw Kannakai's translation to Svarga, their account of it to the Ch\u00e9ra King, the establishment of temples for the worship of Kannakai, who ever afterwards was called Pattini, in different parts of India and in Ceylon.\n\nReference to Gaja B\u00e1hu is made in two places\u2014first, in the chapter entitled Uraiperukatturai, as follows:\n\nFrom that day the P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya kingdom suffered from want of rain, and famine and poverty prevailed daily; but on the P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diyaian King Ilancheliyan, then residing at Ko\u1e6dkai, sacrificing 1,000 goldsmiths to Pattini and celebrating her worship, rain fell, and the land was freed from poverty and disease.\n\nHearing this, Kosar, the King of Ko\u1e47kumandalam, also celebrated her worship in the same manner, and rain became plentiful in his land.\n\nHearing this, Gaja B\u00e1hu, of sea-girt Ceylon, having first built a sacrificial stone (Palipidam) for daily sacrifices, then having built\nbelieving that Pattini would bless him and his land, celebrated on the full moon day of \u00c1di (July-August) her worship, and caused processions in every street of his city, and thus brought on rain, and made his land more fruitful than ever.\n\nHearing this, the Ch\u00f3la King, Perun\u00e1dkilli, in the same manner built a temple and made daily sacrifices to Pattini.\n\nThe second reference occurs in Va\u00f1chi-k-k\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0dam in the chapter Varantaru K\u00e1tai, which, translated, runs thus:\n\nHaving listened joyfully to the words of the Brahmans, and having built a temple for Pattini, who destroyed by fire the capital of the song-renowned land of the P\u00e1ndiyas, having directed that daily festivals should be celebrated in her honour, and having begged Tevika\u00ed to offer flowers and incense, the lord of the world, Che\u1e47ku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan\u0304, stood worshipping, and in his presence worshipped other princes, including the Northern Kongas, the Malwa princes, and Gaja B\u00e1hu, king of sea-surrounded Ilankai (Ceylon).\n\nThe following points are worthy of note in this work. Unlike the generality of books in Tamil, this poem does not begin with an invocation to the deity, but begins thus:\n\nLet us praise the moon, let us praise the moon, for resembling the shade-giving white umbrella of Ch\u00f3la, he (the moon\u2014masculine in Tamil) protects the world.\n\nLet us praise the sun, let us praise the sun, for resembling the Tikiri of the lord of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri country, he goes round Mount Meru.\n\nLet us praise the rain, let us praise the rain, for, like Ch\u00f3la, it confers prosperity continuously on earth.\n\nLet us praise the City Puk\u00e1r, let us praise the City of Flowers, for in this ocean-bound earth with Ch\u00f3la\u2019s family it excels everything else.\n\nAs I have said before, the poem is divided into three parts, each part containing ten chapters.\n\nIn chapter I., Ma\u1e45ka\u1e37a V\u00e1lttupp\u00e1dal, it states that the guests at the wedding of the hero and heroine were invited in a way now rare even amongst princes in India. Maidens were sent out on elephants to invite the guests, and the commentator says that it was then the usual mode of invitation. Another custom, now unusual, is mentioned at the conclusion of the marriage. The assembled women, after blessing the bride and bridegroom, prayed that their king\n\n* It will be interesting to ascertain where this temple was built.\nmight ever be prosperous. At the present time among Hind\u00fas this is not usual in private ceremonies, though in their temples blessing the ruling sovereign takes place on festival days.\n\nIn the second chapter (II.), *Manaiyaramp\u00e1du\u1e6d\u1e6da K\u00e1tai*, is related the daily life of K\u00f3valan and Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai, and amongst other things it is there stated that the merchants of the city were also shipowners, *kalam* being used to denote ships.\n\nIn the next chapter (III.), *Aran\u1e33\u00e9\u1e6d\u1e6du K\u00e1tai*, is given a full and interesting description of a dancing girl, the qualities and qualifications of a dancing master, music teacher, singing master, the player on wind instruments, the musical instruments then in use, and the different modes in the music of that time; and the learned commentator of the poem, Adiy\u00e1rkkunall\u00e1r, gives a full commentary on these matters.\n\nThe fourth chapter (IV.) is entitled \"The Beauty of Evening,\" and gives a description of sunset, moon rise, the loves of M\u00e1dav\u00ed, the dancing girl and K\u00f3valan, and the sorrow of Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai at her separation from her husband.\n\nThe fifth chapter (V.) deals with the celebration of the worship of Indra. A beautiful description of Puk\u00e1r,\u2014the chief seat of government of the Ch\u00f3\u1e37as at the time,\u2014its buildings, busy streets, the foreign merchants and their ways, the sellers of perfumes and flowers, embroidery workers in silk, cotton, and rat furs, follows. Mention is also made of the different kinds of food used, amongst them *pi\u1e6d\u1e6du* and *appam*, not unknown now to our European residents. Toddy was sold by the women of the lowest caste, as also was fish; and *ve\u1e6d\u1e6dilai*, \"the betel leaf,\" then, as now, universally used in India and Ceylon, is also mentioned.\n\nThe sixth chapter (VI.), entitled \"Sea-bathing,\" describes how the inhabitants, from the prince down to the peasant, proceeded on stated occasions to the sea, and how they spent their day after sea-bath. It also describes the scents,\nointments and cosmetics, jewellery and other paraphernalia used by the fair sex of the time.\n\nThe seventh chapter (VII.), K\u0101\u1e47alv\u0101ri, is one of the most interesting parts of the poem to Tamil scholars. It contains the songs said to have been sung by K\u00f3valan and M\u00e1dav\u00ed at the river side, in various metres, in praise of the king, river K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, the City of Puk\u00e1r, and on other subjects. The rhythm and sweetness of the several songs can only be appreciated by those who are well versed in Tamil, and are certainly not excelled in any other literature. It is here that K\u00f3valan and M\u00e1dav\u00ed quarrel, each believing, but without cause, the other to have been unfaithful, and the final separation takes place.\n\nIn the opening lines of the eighth chapter (VIII.), V\u0113\u1e47i\u1e6d K\u00e1tai, reference is made to an incident in the physical history of Southern India, which I think is not known to European scholars. The southern boundary of Tamil India thousands of years ago seems to have been a river named Kumari, and in the time of the P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya King Jayam\u00e1kirtti, alias Nilantaratiruvit P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diya (the prince in whose reign Tolk\u00e1ppiyam attained its highest fame), the sea is said to have invaded a large part of South India, and the river Kumari with much land south of it was submerged in the sea which now washes the shores of Cape Comorin. This chapter also mentions four cities, Madura, Urantai, Va\u00f1chi, and Puk\u00e1r, as having been royal residences. It also gives in detail the mode of playing on the musical instruments called the y\u00e1l or vi\u1e47ai.\n\nAt the end of this chapter is a stanza, part of which I translate for its quaintness in describing Vasanta, the period when the rule of K\u00e1ma, the Indian Cupid, was all-powerful:\n\nAll you lovers who have quarrelled come together in the name of the bodiless, thus sings the Kokilam.\n\nThe ninth chapter (IX.) gives an account of Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai\u2019s dream foreshadowing the death of her husband, the\narrival of her husband, their reconciliation, and, \"old fate forcing, they set out before sunrise\" to Madura to sell the anklets.\n\nThe next two parts, consisting of twenty chapters, relate their travel to Madura, the death of K\u00f3valan, the destruction by fire of Madura, the end of Ka\u1e47\u1e47akai's earthly life, and her worship by the several princes already mentioned.\n\nI have written these lines in the hope that some of the eminent scholars who are members of this Society will be induced to make a careful study of this poem, one so valued by the Tamil scholars of old that it is known as one of the Pa\u00f1chak\u00e1viyas, \"the five poems\" par excellence in Tamil, and to publish the results of their studies. I also trust that European scholars will be induced to study Tamil literature more than they have hitherto done, because I feel sure that that mine contains gems at least as valuable as those found in P\u00e1li. The Jain literature, which, if not more interesting than, is at least equal to, Buddhist literature, is mainly in Tamil.\n\nBefore concluding, I would like to render thanks to Mr. Suv\u00e1min\u00e1tha Aiyar, Tamil Pandit of the Government College, Kumbhak\u00f3nam, for publishing for the first time this ancient work after much labour.\n\nAnd I the more appreciate this, as he was induced by me to undertake the task of collating and publishing what, in a few years more, would have been utterly lost to the world, in the same manner as several hundreds of equally valuable Tamil works have been lost.\n\nThe President hoped they were going to have some discussion on the Paper read. There were two points in particular which had given him considerable anxiety.\n\nHe could not help thinking, as regarded one point, that there was a mistake in the passage which represented the Kandyan king as having sacrificed a thousand goldsmiths! During the earlier part of the present century a Frenchman might have been said to have sacrificed a\nthousand Louis. By that term was not meant a thousand members of the royal family, but coins that bore the name of Louis. Possibly \"goldsmith\" in the present case meant a gold piece, and he could not but hope there was some mistake either in the reading or the translation.\n\nWith regard to the date of the poem, he believed the reader of the Paper was prepared to find that what he had advanced was a new view\u2014at any rate to those who had access only to European scholars. He (the speaker) had referred to considerable authorities upon the point, and he had read Dr. Caldwell's \"Grammar\" and Sir William Hunter's \"Gazetteer\" on the subject. It was right that the Members of the Royal Asiatic Society should be informed that with regard to that great era and landmark, as it undoubtedly was, the publication of the Tamil R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a\u2014there was very great doubt about it, and Dr. Caldwell brought it down to the year 1100. He was not satisfied, from the quotations made by the author of the Paper, that the Tamil translation of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a was made in the ninth century, or that the Tamil translation of Sak\u0101nda-pur\u0101\u1e47a was made in the eighth century. There was nothing to show that those prefatory verses were written by the authors themselves. From what he had read of Dr. Caldwell it seemed to him that Kamban, the famous Tamil poet, had lived in the reign of V\u012bra Rajendra Ch\u014d\u1e37a, in the eleventh century.\n\nMr. S\u0113n\u0101th\u012b R\u0101ja said that the interest of the Paper consisted, as His Lordship very properly remarked, in its throwing some light on the history of Tamil literature. The difficulty which Oriental scholars hitherto experienced in regard to Indian literature in general, whether Sanskrit or Tamil, was the fixing of the exact dates and period when different authors lived. That difficulty was to some extent removed, in the case of Sanskrit authors, by the labours of foreign scholars. But in regard to Tamil literature there were very few foreign scholars who laboured in that field, and among them the only noteworthy and reliable men who attempted to give any chronology in regard to Tamil literature were Drs. Caldwell and Burnell.\n\nDr. Caldwell was, no doubt, an eminent philologist, and he has done immense service to Oriental scholarship by his great work, \"The Comparative Grammar of the Dravidian Languages,\" but with regard to the chronology which he gave of Tamil literature he had no very reliable materials before him. He arbitrarily assigned the beginning of Tamil literature to the eighth century of our era, his reason being that most of the early Tamil works were composed by Jain authors.\n\nDr. Caldwell thought, moreover, that Jainism had its origin in Northern India about the beginning of the fifth century, and that it spread to Southern India only about the eighth. He did not know what authority Dr. Caldwell had for his statement that Jainism\noriginated only in the fifth century. From Buddhist writings, for instance in *Sutta Nip\u0101ta*, he found that there were Jains in the time of Buddha. Two philosophers were said to have had some discussion with him, and among them were Majjali Gosala and Nighanta Nataputta. The first was an *Ajibaka* and the second was a *Nighanta*. It was a well-known fact that those two sects were admittedly Jains. The *As\u00f3ka* inscription, about 250 B.C., made mention of Jains; and the *Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya* said that Abhaya, king of Ceylon, in the fifth century B.C., built a temple to *Ajibaka*, and that a *Nighanta* ascetic called Giri lived at Anur\u00e1dhapura. From these facts it was evident that Jainism had its origin, not in the fifth century of Christ, but that it existed even in the fifth century before Christ, in Ceylon. The chronology based by Dr. Caldwell on that authority was, therefore, valueless for historical purposes.\n\nAs regarded the age (or date) of the poem *Chilappatik\u00e1ram*, the fact that it made mention of Gaja B\u00e1hu, king of Ceylon, was, he thought, important. This Gaja B\u00e1hu appeared to have been a contemporary author, and a younger brother of the then reigning Ch\u00e9ra king. Now, there were only two Gaja B\u00e1hus in the history of Ceylon\u2014one who reigned in the second century of our era and the other in the twelfth. The one referred to in the poem could not possibly be the second Gaja B\u00e1hu, and for this reason: from an inscription given in Wilson's Mackenzie Manuscripts, the Ch\u00e9ra kingdom was conquered by the Ch\u00f3l\u00e1s under their king \u00c1ditya Varm\u00e1 in 894 A.D., and was absorbed in the Ch\u00f3la kingdom and passed into the hands of another dynasty of Mysore, called Hoysala Ballalla, in the tenth century of our era. The Ch\u00e9ra kingdom was, therefore, practically extinct from 894 A.D. If the author of *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* was the brother of the reigning king of Ch\u00e9ra, he could not have lived after 894 A.D. Before that period there was only one Gaja B\u00e1hu, and that was Gaja B\u00e1hu I. Again, the *Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nya* said that Gaja B\u00e1hu I. invaded the Ch\u00f3la kingdom. It was perhaps on that occasion that Gaja B\u00e1hu visited the Ch\u00e9ra king, who possibly might have been an ally in the war against the Ch\u00f3l\u00e1s. Again, from an inscription given in the *Indian Antiquary*, he found that V\u00edra Rajendra Ch\u00f3la, otherwise called Kolatunga Ch\u00f3la, was crowned king in 1079 A.D. They all knew that Kolatunga Ch\u00f3la was associated in Tamil literature with the names of Kamban and other poets. Dr. Burnell thought that *Virach\u00f3liyam* a grammatical treatise in Tamil, composed by a Buddhist called Buddha Mittra, was completed in the reign of V\u00edra Rajendra Ch\u00f3la. In a commentary to that work, written by the author himself, he quotes *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* as an authority. It was clear, therefore, that *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* must have been composed before the eleventh century. As there was only one Gaja B\u00e1hu before that period, they could not but come to the conclusion that the Gaja B\u00e1hu referred to in the poem must be Gaja B\u00e1hu I. Again, *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* made mention of Kolkai as one of the capitals of the P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0diyas. They\nknew from the writings of Greek geographers that about the first and second century before and after Christ, Kolkai was the emporium of the East, and that before the sixth century, as they knew from the writings of Kosmas, it had dwindled into insignificance. It seemed, therefore, that the author of *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* must have lived before the sixth century. For the reasons he had stated he thought they must take it that the Gaja B\u00e1hu referred to in the poem must be the first king of Ceylon of that name, and that the poem *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* must have been composed in the second century A.D. He did not support the arguments adduced by the author of the Paper, from the prefatory verses attached to the Tamil translation of *R\u00e1m\u00e1ya\u1e47a* and *Sk\u00e1nda-pur\u00e1\u1e47a*. In the preface to a Tamil edition of *Chilappatik\u00e1ram* recently published, which contained a summary of the whole book, the Tamil editor called attention, he might remark in concluding, to the fact that the name of Gaja B\u00e1hu was mentioned, and arrived at the same conclusion as he (the speaker) did, viz., that by the Gaja B\u00e1hu of the poem was meant Gaja B\u00e1hu I.\n\nDr. W. G. Vandort thought the evidence of the poem as to priority did not depend very much on tradition and conjecture. There was one argument referred to by the last speaker which was, he thought, important, as fixing the date as approximately as possible, in showing that the Ch\u00e9ra dynasty was extinguished somewhere about the ninth or tenth century. They had a historical legend in support of the fact. If the author of the poem was the son of the reigning Ch\u00e9ra monarch, why should he be anonymous? It seemed unlikely that a Ch\u00f3\u1e37a prince should be forsaking his own house and indulging in such fulsome adulation as brought about the downfall of his own people. But the chief interest in the poem was its ethical significance\u2014the view of human life which the poet took\u2014the fundamental principle on which the structure of the poem depended. For instance, it contained the very first record, so far as he knew,\u2014his experiences comprised only the *Indian Antiquary*,\u2014of the apotheosis of a woman not of royal blood\u2014not even of the warrior or priestly class\u2014but a woman of the people\u2014one of the *bourgeoise*, exalted to the Indian Pantheon, not for any heroic deed, not for any act of self-sacrifice or heroic devotion, but for the commonplace virtues of domestic life.\n\nMr. Harward remarked that the reading of Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my\u2019s Paper had given rise to a very interesting discussion on the question\u2014namely, that of synchronising the poem\u2014whether it was written in the reign of Gaja B\u00e1hu the First or Second. Another question raised was that regarding the goldsmiths. The Chairman had expressed the hope that it was a mistake, and that the real reading of the word was *gold coins*. But he (the speaker) was afraid they denoted goldsmiths. But he hoped the number was not correct, and that it was not a full thousand. He believed that owing to the conduct of the goldsmith,\nwho was the \"villain of the piece\" in the poem, there was still a belief that goldsmiths were the objects of the special wrath of the heroine of the poem, or the powers that be, and he fancied ignorant people still believed that a village of goldsmiths was always burnt down once a year.\n\n7. Mr. Harward said that as the discussion had been rather prolonged, he would move that the reading of Mr. Modder's Paper be postponed for the next General Meeting.\n\nMr. G. A. Joseph seconded the motion, which was carried.\n\n8. Dr. Vandort had much pleasure in proposing a vote of thanks to the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my for his most interesting Paper. If he had done no worthier service, he had excited some interest in Tamil literature among scholars other than those of his own race, and for that service he thought the Society owed him a special acknowledgment.\n\nMr. Ra\u00f1asinha seconded the vote, which was carried.\n\nHis Lordship had great pleasure in conveying the vote of thanks to Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my for his Paper.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my acknowledged the vote.\n\n9. Mr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than said the Chairman had shown very intelligent interest in the subject under discussion. His Lordship had carefully studied the case, and he (the speaker) for one had watched with admiration the trouble he had taken in dove-tailing in all the little facts contra and presenting them to the consideration of the Meeting, in as clear a manner as possible. It was only right that the question on the other side should have been put before them in that way. He was sure that they would accept his proposal for a vote of thanks to the Chairman.\n\nThe vote having been passed, and His Lordship having acknowledged it, the Meeting terminated.\nCOUNCIL MEETING.\n\nNovember 7, 1893.\n\nPresent:\n\nThe Right Reverend the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President,\nin the Chair.\nMr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, C.M.G.\nMr. F. C. Roles, Honorary Treasurer.\nMr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretary.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on September 11, 1893.\n2. Read the following letter from Mr. J. F. W. Gore on the subject of the paging of reprints:\n\nDear Sir,\u2014With reference to the reprints of the Journals of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, I write to inform you that I have completed (No. 12, in the Press, excepted) a series of Tables showing the correspondence between their paging and that of the originals. It is intended that this shall form an appendix to the Index now in preparation, so that persons in possession of a mixed series of part Numbers may be enabled to consult the Index without danger of confusion.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge I have now examined specimens of all the originals as well as of all the reprints (except No. 12), and it must be considered fortunate that so complete a series has been available. The Museum copy of the Journal, from which the Index is being compiled, appears to consist entirely of originals, with the exception of Part I., which I have marginally marked with original page Numbers.\n\nSince many of the past numbers (originals and reprints) are becoming scarce, it may shortly be necessary to issue a second series of reprints, as well as to continue reprinting those Numbers hitherto not reprinted.\n\nI therefore take this opportunity of recommending that in future each page of such reprint should be made to contain exactly the same reading matter as is found on the page of the original from which it is reprinted, and should be numbered as in the original. An increase or decrease of the margin might, I think, be made to allow for any difference in the sizes of the type used formerly and now; while if the original page ends in a divided word, so should the page of the reprint, even if it be necessary to divide it in the middle of the last line. Probably the appearance of the reprinted page would in a very slight degree suffer; but, as against this must be set the great advantages of securing uniformity with the Museum or standard copy, and of obviating the necessity of issuing, to all who possess a copy of the Index, a fresh correspondence-table with each future reprint.\n\nHonorary Secretary,\n\nR. A. S. (C. B.)\n\nI am, &c.,\n\nJ. F. W. Gore.\nResolved,\u2014That the Council do approve of Mr. Gore's suggestion, that in future each page of a reprint should be made to contain exactly the same reading matter as is found on the page of the original from which it is reprinted, and should be numbered as in the original.\n\n3. Considered books suggested for purchase.\n   Resolved to purchase General Cunningham's *Coins of Ancient India*.\n\n4. Resolved,\u2014That the following candidate for admission into the Society be elected a Resident Member:\n\n   J. E. Pohath {nominated by} B. W. Bawa.\n   {seconded by} C. M. Fernando.\n\n5. Considered the appointment of a new Honorary Treasurer in place of Mr. F. C. Roles, who resigns the office on leaving the Island.\n   Resolved,\u2014That Mr. A. P. Green be offered the Honorary Treasurership, and in the event of his declining the office it be offered to Mr. Stanley Bois, and that in the meanwhile Mr. Joseph be appointed Acting Honorary Treasurer to take over the books and papers.\n\n6. Laid on the table a letter from Mr. J. P. Lewis, dated September 28, 1893, regarding his Paper on \"A Temple Festival in the Mullaittivu District,\" and the \"Temple of Chittrav\u00e9la\u1e0dar K\u00f3vil,\" together with proposed draft answer.\n   Resolved,\u2014That the Council approves of the proposed answer.\n\n7. Laid on the table a Paper from Mr. T. B. Pohath, entitled \"Sketch of the Life of Premier \u0112helapola.\"\n   Resolved,\u2014That the Paper be referred to Messrs. R\u00e1man\u00e1than and J. Harward for their opinion.\n\n8. Laid on the table a Paper by V\u0113livi\u1e6diya Dharmmaratana Terun-n\u00e1nse on \"Buddhist Robes,\" and read the Lord Bishop's minute thereon.\n\n9. Laid on the table correspondence with the Hon. W. W. Mitchell regarding his election as a Member.\n   Resolved,\u2014That the Honorary Treasurer do write to Mr. Mitchell notifying him of his election.\n\n10. Resolved,\u2014That a General Meeting of the Society be held on the 2nd ultimo, and that Mr. Modder's Paper on \"Y\u00e1pahuwa,\" of which notice had been given, be read.\n\n11. The Honorary Treasurer laid on the table a list of Members whose subscriptions were in arrear for over two years, and who by Resolution of the Council dated 28th March, 1893, should be struck off the roll.\n   Resolved,\u2014That the names of several defaulters be at once struck off the list, but that should any Member whose name is erased pay all dues before December 1 next, his name may remain on the roll of the Society.\nGENERAL MEETING.\n\nColombo Museum, December 2, 1893.\n\nPresent:\nThe Lord Bishop of Colombo, President, in the Chair.\nThe Hon.

Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on October 28, 1893.\n\n2. Notified the election of the following Member since the last General Meeting, viz., J. E. Pohath.\n\n3. In the absence of the writer, Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nANCIENT CITIES AND TEMPLES\nIN THE KURUNEGALA DISTRICT: YAPAHUWA.\n\nBy F. H. MODDER.\n\nPREFATORY NOTE.\n\nThe Seven K\u00f3ral\u00e9s, or Kurun\u00e9gala District, has within its territorial limits the site of many an ancient royal city, as also temples of renown, which writers on Ceylon have omitted all mention of, or, if referring to them, have devoted to them so little space that it can hardly be said that justice has been done to the subject. Where the space given to a notice of these sites and temples is brief, it may safely be assumed that very little was seen, if anything, by those who undertake their description. For instance, notwithstanding the fact that the ruins of Y\u00e1pahuwa are less remote and more accessible than those of Polonnaruwa, they find no place in the books of the principal writers on the Island, not even in the scholarly review or the Ruined Cities of Ceylon by Sir J. Emerson Tennent. If that eminent writer had visited these ruins he would not in his chapter on the Fine Arts among the ancient inhabitants, have passed this hasty judgment:\n\nCarving appears to have been practised at a very early period with singular success; but as in later times it became so deteriorated that there is no difficulty at the present day in pronouncing on the superiority of the specimens remaining at Anarajapooora over those which are to be found among the ruins of the later capitals, Pollanarrua, Yapahu, and Kornegalle.*\n\n* *Ceylon*, Vol. I., p. 483. Mr. H. Parker considers the stone work in some of the ruins at R\u00e1jangana, near Galkadavala and about 45 miles from Kurun\u00e9gala, of a character quite equal to that of the older buildings at Anur\u00e1dhapura, if not in some cases superior. I hope to devote a Paper to the history of the \"Palace Court Yard,\"\u2014the name of the place translated\u2014and to give an account of its interesting ruins. Prince S\u00e9laya or Sala, son of king Dutugamunu, is said to have founded the city, in which case it will be about 2,020 years old. At all events, the date of the oldest buildings cannot be more than one or two hundred years after Christ.\nThe vast and rapid changes which progress and civilization have effected since British rule in Ceylon are daily diminishing the labour and difficulty of accomplishing a trip to these sites and scenes of an ancient and bygone civilization; while the facilities of travel afforded by railway extension render the journey as easy of undertaking by the million, as it once was by a favoured few. These facilities have, moreover, the tendency of fostering and encouraging the spirit of unrest which is manifesting itself in the most populous parts of some of the Provinces of the Island, so much so, that it requires, as aptly remarked by a local writer\u2014\n\nno prophetic faculty to be able to picture that in a not too remote future there will be found amongst the grim ruins of a bygone age happy colonies emulating the industry and prosperity of the generations whose monuments overshadow them.*\n\nIt is with a view of evoking greater interest in, and bringing into more prominent notice these cities and temples, which played so important a part in the history of the past, but have lain buried in oblivion and forgotten by the world, that I have endeavoured to prepare (mostly from existing, though scattered, information) this Paper on Y\u00e1pahuwa. I propose to give it the first place, and to follow it up by others.\n\nI.\u2014Y\u00c1PAHUWA.\n\nY\u00e1pahuwa is situate in the Pahala-visideka K\u00f3ral\u00e9 of the Wanni Hatpattu, lies 32\u00b720 miles to the north-east of Kurun\u00e9-gala, and rises 767\u00b75 feet above the level of the sea. The shortest approach to it is via the Puttalam road. Proceed 15\u00b730 miles along it, turn to the right at P\u00e1deniya,\u2020 go 11\u00b790 miles on the\n\n---\n\n* Census of Ceylon, 1891, Vol. I., p. 22.\n\u2020 P\u00e1deniya, a village in Dewam\u00e9di M\u00e9dagandahe K\u00f3ral\u00e9, of the Pahaladolospattu (now Dewam\u00e9di Hatpattu), situated on the road from Puttalam to Kurun\u00e9-gala, 43 miles east of the former place and 15\u00b730 miles from the latter. The road to Siyambalagomuwa-oya, the boundary of the new \u00dava Province, branches off at 20 miles. It has a temple on a rock, Galpi\u1e6da Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, with images and a d\u00e1goba. According to Lieut.-Col. Campbell, \u201cAn old Buddhoo Temple built upon an insulated rock, from\nminor road, turn at Dalad\u00e1gama to the right, and after travelling 3\u00b750 miles turn to the right again at Het\u1e6dipola, and you are 1\u00b750 mile from Y\u00e1pahuwa. If a view of the entire chain of the \"animal-shaped rocks\" of Kurun\u00e9gal\u00e1 is desired en route, one may start for Y\u00e1pahuwa along the Dambulla road, turn to the left at Muttettu-gala 1\u00b740 mile, proceed along the Kalugalla road 25\u00b715 miles (traversing the important and extensive forest of Pall\u00e9k\u00e9l\u00e9, probably the largest and richest in the Island), turn to the left at Madagala 7\u00b745 miles, thence to Het\u1e6dipola, turn to the left, and 1\u00b750 mile will bring one to the required destination. This route is 3\u00b730 miles longer than the former, which is far pleasanter to travel over for at least half the distance, as the road up to P\u00e1de\u1e47iya and thence on to Dalad\u00e1gama is what is known as a principal\n\nwhence there is an extensive view over a seemingly agreeable, though rather thickly wooded, country, has been fixed, it may be supposed on account of its strength, as a military post for the abode of both officers and soldiers. This rock is surrounded by low marshy jungle and fine paddy fields, with here and there pools of stagnant water, which are often entirely dried up, and from such a country may be expected to arise that malaria which is thought to produce fevers and other diseases.' (Excursions, Adventures, and Field Sport in Ceylon, 1843, Vol. II., p. 16.)\n\nAt the time Campbell wrote, Lieut. Logie of the 73rd commanded the troops here, and received as Agent of Government an allowance of about \u00a3200 per annum. The soil in its vicinity is very fertile, and produces immense quantities of paddy. The temple, having been for some time occupied as a military post, was restored to the priests in consequence of the insalubrity of the place. (Casie Chetty's Gazetteer, p. 179; Pridham, Vol. II., p. 648.) Migast\u0113nna Adig\u00e1r made a fort here and ruled with severity. The incumbent of the temple still shows the visitor the stone pillars to which people were tied to be lashed. In the rocks below the banag\u00e9 is a deep hole, which contains a constant supply of good water. A pokuna lower down holds a good deal, even during a drought. The vih\u0101r\u00e9 is said to be of great age. There are some finely carved pillars, a good figure of Buddha, and several prettily carved ivory offerings. The painting outside has all been effaced. The resident priests do not pay much attention to the improvement or restoration of the buildings. (Diary, Administration Report, N.-W. Province, 1888.) The natives say that the soldiers stationed here were visited with sickness owing to their having desecrated the sacred edifice! In consequence of the storing up of salt, the walls are so saturated with saline matter that no paintings could have stood, or been executed on them thereafter, even the plastering giving way.\nthoroughfare, and therefore metalled and in good order. The route via Muttettu-gala and Ka\u1e37ugalla passes over minor roads, which are only gravelled, and in many places not permissive of very comfortable travelling; but it is much safer than the other. Going by the Putta\u1e37am road, 5\u00b715 miles from P\u00e1deniya, is the path which leads to Ebb\u00e1-velapi\u1e6diya, and about half a mile before the turn to Het\u1e6dipola lies Kaik\u00e1vala on the right, by the wayside. At both these places elephants have more than once been kraaled, and the chances are greater of an unexpected encounter with one of these beasts than journeying by the longer route.*\n\nIn 1850 Mr. John Bailey,\u2020 of the Ceylon Civil Service, was, according to the testimony of the priests of the adjoining temple, only the third Englishman who had ever explored these ruins. In an admirable sketch on \"Yapahoo\" from his pen, published with illustrations in Once a Week\u2021 (from which much of the material incorporated into this Paper has been gleaned), Mr. Bailey points out that the first Englishman was General Fraser, who halted near the city when marching some troops through the country during the rebellion of 1817; the second being that writer's companion, Mr. J. Woodford Birch, of the Ceylon Civil Service,\u00a7 to whom\n\n* For a graphic description of the Elephant Kraal in 1884 at Ebb\u00e1velapi\u1e6diya from the pen of the late Sir W. H. Gregory, who was personally present as the guest of Sir A. H. Gordon (now Lord Stanmore), Governor, see Murray's Magazine for September, 1884, and for an excellent account of the Kraal at Kaik\u00e1vala in 1886 by Mr. S. M. Burrows, c.c.s., see MacMillan's Magazine for January 7, 1888, under the title of \"Something like a bag: some experiences of an Elephant Kraal in Ceylon.\"\n\n\u2020 This able officer was a son-in-law of Sir Henry Ward, Governor (as was his contemporary, Mr. A. Young Adams), and he has left ample testimony of his talents in the excellent reports on irrigation and other subjects written by him. To the regret of all who witnessed his brilliant and prosperous career, he was forced to resign his appointment much too early in life owing to severe injuries sustained to his thigh by repeated fractures in two unfortunate accidents.\n\n\u2021 Vol. XI., Nos. 269 (August 20), 271 (September 3, 1864).\n\n\u00a7 Mr. Birch was foully assassinated in the Straits Settlements, while holding office there as Colonial Secretary.\nthe merit is due of having first drawn attention to these very beautiful ruins.\n\nMr. Bailey, who seems naturally offended at the undeserved slight passed on it by Tennent, expressed his opinion that\u2014\n\nYapahoo is certainly the finest specimen of exquisite work, . . . . in point of architectural beauty and richness of design far excels all the ancient capitals of the Island.\n\nThe ruins of the palace\u2014prove that in design and execution the architects of Ceylon, in the thirteenth century, had certainly not deteriorated since the days of their predecessors, when Anuradhapoora flourished.\n\nThe correctness of this judgment is more than amply supported by what has been disclosed by the restoration of some of the ruins in 1887, by Mr. A. E. Williams of the Public Works Department, to whose Report I am indebted for the information as to the progress, completion, and details of the work which he carried out.\n\nMr. L. C. Wijesinha, the learned translator of the Mah\u0101wa\u1e47sa, notes\u2014\n\nThe names Subha-pabbata, Subhachala, Subha-giri, are all meant for the city of Y\u0101pahuwa\u2014patbata, achala, and giri being synonyms for \"mountain.\" Subha-pabbata would mean \"the beautiful mountain,\" and so would the Sinhalese Y\u0101hau, contracted to Y\u0101pau.*\n\nAnd Mr. P. A. Templer, Government Agent:\u2014\n\nThe proper Sinhalese name is Yasapauwa\u2014yasa meaning fine and pauwa (parvata) a mountain. S and h being interchangeable, Yasapauwa became Yahapauwa, and then Yapauwa; the lost h being ultimately transferred to the latter part of the name and making it Yapahuwa.\u2020 The natives, even the most intelligent, have never been able to give any explanation of the name, beyond a hesitating reference to \u0101 pahu \"back again,\" of which it was supposed to be a corruption.\n\nThe city was founded during the usurpation of M\u0101gha, about 1225 A.D. Amongst the chieftains who \"had built for themselves in the great strongholds and mountainous parts of the country, cities and hamlets,\" and \"defended the\n\n* Mah\u0101wa\u1e47sa, XC., p. 315, notes.\n\u2020 Administration Reports of the North-Western Province, 1886, p. 45A.\npeople and the religion from the disturber,\u201d was Subha S\u00e9n\u00e1pati, a noted general.\n\nHe built a city like unto Alakamand\u00e1 on the top of Subha Pabbata, a mountain difficult of access to the enemy, and dwelt there like unto Vessavana, keeping at a distance the Keral\u00e1 demons and defending that portion of the country and the religion thereof.*\n\nWhen King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu II., owing to old age and infirmity, made over the government of the kingdom to his son Vijaya B\u00e1hu IV. at about the close of the thirteenth century, the latter selected his brother Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu to \u201ccommand the great army that held the northern country,\u201d and sent him \u201cto tarry at Sundara Pabbata (Y\u00e1pahuwa) as an outpost against the invading Tamils.\u201d\u2020\n\nThe ruler of the land then journeyed throughout the country and, after a visit to Kurun\u00e9gala, took with him \u201cthe four-fold army\u201d to Subhagiri (Y\u00e1pahuwa.) At this time Chandabh\u00e1nu, at the head of a powerful army, proceeded to and encamped at Y\u00e1pahuwa, but he and his men were utterly defeated and put to confusion after \u201ca fierce battle like unto the battle of R\u00e1ma.\u201d\u2021\n\nThereafter the king\u2014\n\nenclosed that city with a high wall and a moat, and built there and finished a palace of exceeding great beauty, and made provision for the support of the great priesthood that dwelt in that city. And he encouraged his younger brother Bhuwan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu and caused him to stay there as before.\u00a7\n\nOn the murder of King Vijaya B\u00e1hu in the second year of his reign, at the instigation of his treacherous General Mitta, Prince Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu, who was then in Dambaden\u00edya, fled from that city and journeyed by night in a litter to Subh\u00e1chala (Y\u00e1pahuwa). Mitta\u2019s men overtook him, and hurled their pointed weapons at the litter with such fury that the trappings gave way. The prince leaped out of the carriage and made his escape to K\u00e1lagalla, where, mounting an elephant, he crossed the great river Ko\u1e37abhinna, which\n\n* Mah\u00e1wansa, LXXXI., p. 271. \u2020 Mah\u00e1wansa, LXXXVIII., p. 305.\n\u2020 Ibid., LXXXVIII., p. 303. \u00a7 Ibid., LXXXVIII., p. 306.\nwas then in flood, and continued his flight till he reached Subha-pabbata.*\n\nMitta was soon afterwards slain. Bhuvan\u00e9ka B\u00e1hu was brought back to Dambadeniya by the army, which stood faithful to the royal family, and anointed king in 1277 A.D. After subduing his Tamil foes he remained a few years in Dambadeniya and then removed the seat of Government, as well as the sacred relics, to Subh\u00e1chala, \"and caused that royal city to be greatly extended and adorned, so that it shone with exceedingly great beauty, and himself dwelt there.\" The king who caused this handsome palace to be built was a zealous Buddhist, and caused copies of the Tripitaka to be written and distributed over the Island. He established daily offerings to the dalad\u00e1 or \"tooth-relic.\"\n\nThe king died after reigning eleven years. A severe famine then broke out, and the country was invaded by a P\u00e1ndiyan army commanded by Ariya Chakkravati, who, having laid waste the country\u2014\n\nentered the great and noble fortress the city of Subhagiri. And he took the venerable Tooth-relic and all the solid wealth that was there, and returned to the Pandian country.\u2020\n\nIn 1288 the seat of Government was transferred to Polonnaruwa, since when Y\u00e1pahuwa ceased to be the capital; nevertheless it continued to be a place of considerable importance for over 200 years thereafter.\n\nIn the reign of Sree Praakarama Kotta, a descendant of the royal family was made Dissave of Yapahoo, and shortly after the accession of Jaya Bahoo II., 1464 A.D., he rebelled, put the king to death, and was raised to the throne under the title of Bhuvaneka Bahoo VI.\n\nIn 1527 A.D. Yapahoo was the place of refuge of the two elder sons of Wijaya Bahoo VII., when they fled from their father, who sought their lives. They assembled their forces, and attacking him in their turn, murdered him, and the eldest became king as Bhuvaneka Bahoo VII.\n\nThe last mention of Yapahoo in history is in the reign of Don Juan Dharmapaala, whom the Portuguese set up in 1542 A.D.; when among the many aspirants to the throne, one, a Malabar, took up his residence\n\n* Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, XC., p. 313. \u2020 Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa, XC. p., 315.\nhere. It was probable at this time that the city was destroyed by the Portuguese; and it has ever since been deserted.*\n\nA copy of Y\u00e1puhuwa Vistaraya (the poorest specimen of a Vistaraya I have seen, being especially scanty of information) ascribes the building of the city to King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu, and gives the following quaint particulars in respect thereof:\n\nEight gows from Anur\u00e1dhapura, attended by the chief ministers and other officers of State of the three kingdoms, the building of the city of Y\u00e1puhu Nuwara was begun on the rock called Sundaragiri-paruwata, after which the city was named.\n\nThat same king (Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu) commanded that it should be constructed of stone only, and that the following workmen should be engaged: 120 lacs of masons, 100 chief blacksmiths, 250 hangidi, 3,000 painters, 400 carvers.\n\nThe Adig\u00e1s thereupon commanded some to cut stone pillars, some to carve, some to smooth, some to carve figures, some to paint, some to carve figures of elephants, some figures of lions, some of wolves, some figures of men, some of geese, some of birds, some n\u00e1ga figures, some figures of gods, some figures of women, some of creepers, some of parrots, some of peacocks, some figures of beaters of tom-toms, some figures of dancers engaged in the act of dancing, some of conch-blowers engaged in blowing, some of figures engaged in wrestling, some to carve representations of beds, some of stone doors, some of stone doorposts, and some of stone steps. These stones were then painted over by the painters.\n\nIn this style four m\u00e1lig\u00e1val of nine storeys each were built, with stairs leading up to them. Round these 500 smaller houses of inferior workmanship were also built.\n\nA store eighty cubits high, 500 houses outside the fort, 1,000 double shutters for the houses, a stone wall 7 ft. high, a metal rampart encircling it, 1,000 golden arches, 1,000 silver arches, were also constructed, and adorned with 1,000 flags with flaps and cloth dolls appended thereto, there being also 1,000 elephants, 1,000 horses, 24,000 mercenaries, 2 lacs and 68,000 inhabitants in all.\n\nLike \u0160akraya, enjoying health and happiness, and so reigning, the king built and adorned the city, the only material used being stone.\n\nThe great King Par\u00e1krama B\u00e1hu told his ministers who lived here that it was improper to live in this world without considering the life in this world and the life to come, and published by beat of tom-tom the injunction that all should fulfil the precepts of ata-sil, pan-sil, hear bana, give alms and robes to priests, plant b\u00f3-trees, make offerings,\n\n* Once a Week, Vol. XI., p. 284.\nand honour and maintain their parents. Accordingly the king gave alms to 500 priests, 500 novices, and to the sick.\n\nThese deeds being insufficient to entitle him to merit, the king, after reigning eleven years, and looking to the cave of Res-seruwa, on Thursday, under the asterism Pusa-\u1e47eketta, departed to heaven!\n\nY\u00e1pahuwa is a gigantic solitary boulder, the greater part of one side of which is perfectly perpendicular, rising abruptly from the plain, and commanding a glorious and extensive view of the surrounding level country, whose jungle-covered surface is picturesquely broken by numerous isolated hills and rocks with which it is studded. A bund runs right round it in front, enclosing a considerable area.\n\nAt a point some 200 ft. above the plain, to which the ground slopes with a steep descent, was built the Palace. On one side of the Palace stands the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, below it lay the city, of which the only vestige remaining is an occasional embankment which tells of some pleasant tank that has been dry for ages.\n\nThe absence of all remnant of the dwellings of the people, which is the case with regard to all the ruined cities in Ceylon, is easily accounted for by the fact, that under the native Government only royal and religious buildings and those of the higher nobility were built of stone; the lower orders being only permitted to erect houses of the most temporary description.*\n\nKnox, in his quaint description of the houses of his time, supports this theory; while the custom which prevailed among the native potentates was so tenaciously adhered to that even after the British occupation, when permission was granted to natives of certain rank to tile their dwellings, \"the said privilege\" was only extended to \"persons who have or may receive commissions for office under the signature of the Governor of the Island.\"*\n\nThe city was approached by water supplied from the adjacent tank, a sufficient depth of water being maintained when necessary by bunds raised outside the main or city bund, thus affording a moat of considerable depth and width all round the city. These bunds are in an excellent state of preservation.\u2020\n\n* Once a Week, l. c., p. 226.\n\u2020 Mr. A. E. Williams (Sessional Paper LL, 1886, p. 1).\nAt the time of Mr. Bailey's visit he found the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1l\u00edg\u00e1wa\u2014\"a plain stone building without ornamentation, and hardly worth describing\"\u2014\"substantial and in wonderful preservation.\" His description of the ruins of the palace, as he found them thirty and seven years before any attempt was made to restore them, is worth reproducing.\n\nThe palace was approached by a succession of three flights of steps. The first leads over the main bund\u2014into what are now paddy fields, but which doubtless formed the business part of the city, and consists of twenty-four steps with a plain balustrade. A few of these were in 1850 in tolerable order.\n\nThe entrance chiefly used now is a breach in the bund made by the priest in charge of the vih\u00e1r\u00e9. A fine double-stone culvert built through this bund, and still in use, takes off the water so enclosed into the moat outside.\n\nThe second flight of steps had almost disappeared in 1850. Mr. Bailey says:\n\nThe nature of the ground, a steep sloping bank, with frequent rocks, required the erection of a mass of masonry to support it. This has fallen away, and the steps* are doubtless covered by the d\u00e9bris of the building and the vegetable deposits of ages. Here and there a huge stone shows its edge; and the course of the flight is traceable by the stanchion-holes, which appear on the faces of the rocks up which it led.\u2020\n\nThis flight opens on to a terrace, from which rises the last flight. It consists of thirty-five steps, flanked with \"balustrades of grotesque design and very elaborate execution.\" One side of the upper flight Bailey found entirely overturned, and the grotesque and emblematic figures which formed that side of the balustrade lay half or entirely buried in the ground. It was wonderful that what remained should be so perfect.\n\nThe grand entrance to the palace is now reached.\n\nIt is impossible not to be struck with its graceful proportions.\n\n* Discovered by Mr. Williams to be 40 in number.\n\u2020 Once a Week, l.c., p. 226.\nIt is composed of three huge blocks of stone. The doorposts, or jambs\u2014each a single stone\u2014measure 11 ft. 6 in., exclusive of foundations, and are in girth 1 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 4 in. The lintel is a single stone, 8 ft. 6 in. long, but of greater bulk than the jambs. They are beautifully fluted, and the carving is as sharp as when the mason laid his chisel down. On either side are columns, whose capitals represent the lotus flower depressed. These are sadly out of the perpendicular, and if, indeed, they have not already fallen, I fear they soon will leave the doorway standing by itself, for they are built, and not, as most of the columns are, hewn out of a solid block.\n\nThe doorway opens into a moderately-sized hall, which was lighted by two windows, one on either side of the door, of rare and exquisite carving.\n\nOne was perfect in 1850, but the other had fallen and its fragments were scattered around. The remaining one would doubtless have soon shared its fate, had not Mr. O\u2019Grady, then Government Agent of the North-Western Province, removed it to Kurun\u00e9gala, where, in the beautiful grounds of his residence, itself the site of the royal city of Hastisailapura, he erected it with other choice specimens of stone carving as a monument to ancient art.\u2020 Thence it was transported to Colombo, and now occupies a prominent place among the arch\u00e6ological exhibits at the Museum.\n\nThe description which Mr. Bailey gives of this window, accompanied by a sketch, is too deliciously graphic to be omitted:\n\nThe name given to it (the window) by the natives exactly describes it\u2014\"Sivoomadurukaooloowa,\" \"the perforated palace window.\" It consists of one slab of stone measuring 4 ft. 7 in. by 3 ft. 3 in., and 7 in. thick. This thickness, however, is only preserved along the mouldings at its outer edges. Within the mouldings it has been reduced to an uniform thickness of three inches.\n\nThe surface of the slab of stone has been perforated into forty-five rings or circles, which admitted the light into the entrance hall, somewhat in the fashion of the tracery work at the T\u00e2j at Agra. In each circle is a sculptured figure, and scarcely two figures are alike. . . .\n\nThe circles of the lowest row contain grotesque Bachanalian figures, which represent jolly, laughing fellows, and are executed with great humour. Above them are n\u00e0tch girls, all slightly different in attitude. They occur again in four circles near the centre of the\n\n---\n\n* Once a Week, l. c., p. 281. \u2020 Once a Week, l. c., p. 283.\nwindow, and in a row near the top. The row of circles above the n\u0101\u1e6dch girls contains figures of animals, which are repeated vertically along the mouldings on each side of the window and continued in a horizontal row, the third from the top; in short, they form the outer ridge of a square pattern, comprising the twenty-five centremost circles of the window. The figures of these animals, it will be noted, vary considerably. Eight have the elephant's trunk, and are evidently intended to represent the \"gaja-si\u1e45ha.\" It is remarkable that this is, so far as I know\u2014and there are very few ruins in Ceylon that I have not thoroughly examined\u2014the only example in which the fabulous animal is represented in any but a couchant attitude. Seven appear to be the same animal without the trunk, in which case (since the \"gaja-si\u1e45ha\" is the \"elephant-lion\"), the characteristic of the former being removed, the latter should remain; but I am bound to say the resemblance to a lion in these seven circles is the very faintest. But the centre circle of the third row from the bottom contains a pair of perfect lions rampant. The nine circles remaining of the twenty-five before mentioned form again a distinct square pattern within the other, of which four lotus flowers, or stars, mark the angles. The row of circles at the top of the window contain figures of the \"hansa,\" the \"royal,\" rather than the \"sacred,\" bird, of which Tennent has given so many curious particulars, and which in Ceylon as well as in Burma was one of the emblems of the national banner. If this be intended for the \"hansa,\" as I believe it to be, it certainly differs from the usual representation of it, and much more nearly resembles the Burmese figure as given by Tennent (Vol. I., p. 485, first edition). It is very unlike the bird as it appears in the sculptures at Anuradhapoora (Vol. II., p. 619), and the clay figure of it in the palace at Kandy (Vol. I., p. 487); it is equally unlike one of the oldest \"hansas\" I have seen\u2014a beautifully moulded relief on a brick from the very ancient Naga Wihare at Maagampattoo, mentioned in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 and founded by Maha Naaga, brother of Devenipia Tissa, 306 B.C., the founder of the ancient city of Maagama.\n\nThe peculiar beauty of the window consists rather in the general effect produced by the arrangement of the figures with which it is so profusely decorated, than in the ornamentation itself. Seen from a little distance the details are lost, and the window appears to be of beautiful tracery work and of regular pattern. It is only when closely examined that the quaint designs I have endeavoured to describe are observed. . . . It is much to be regretted that the rough texture of the stone should be so unworthy of the skill of the sculptor. Had it been executed in white marble, or even in the magnesian limestone which abounds in Ceylon, the effect would have been infinitely more lovely.*\n\n* Once a Week, l. c., pp. 281\u201383. The sketch is reproduced from the engravings in Mr. Bailey's Paper.\nStone Window.\nMr. Bailey found the whole of the superstructure on one side of the doorway had disappeared, but two of the walls of the vestibule on the left hand as you enter the doorway were saved; but the displacement of the stones foretold that the fate which attended the corresponding wing on the right, which had quite fallen away, would overtake it.\n\nThe doorway opens upon the terrace, the palace having been built upon the sloping ground, at the base of the wall of rock, which rises many hundred feet above the surrounding plain; the foundations were consequently of the most substantial description, and the masonry raised upon them very massive. Mr. Bailey says:\n\nBut nothing can exceed the regularity of the courses of cut stone and the perfect fitting and binding of each block. Both the terraces which project in advance of the main building and the main building itself are ornamented with carved stone moulding, below which are groups of figures in bold relief, resting on a lower moulding, designed to represent the upturned leaves of the lotus. The figures are excellent, and in great variety of attitude. They represent n\u0101\u1e6dch girls, not oppressed with clothing, who are dancing with great spirit to the energetic music of tom-tom beaters and flageolet players, whose whole souls are in their work. The intense gravity of their faces is admirable; while the whole scene is so well \"told\" that you can almost fancy you can see their heads nodding in time to their music, and hear the castanets in the girls' hands. The overhanging moulding has protected these figures from the weather, and the details are perfect. The ornaments of the female figures and the expression of their faces are as though the sculptor had but just completed his work.*\n\nCommenting on the ruins of the palace, Mr. Bailey writes\u2014\n\nIt is probable that the building was never completed; and this its brief occupation as the seat of government renders more than likely. For it is impossible to conceive that masonry so substantial and sculpture so elaborate would have been lavished on a building which was intended to be of such modest extent. The existing ruins appear to have been those only of the entrance hall of some magnificent palace which it was designed to complete. For the remains are indeed those of a building too small even for convenient residence, though sufficiently large to have served for the state entrance to a noble palace, which, if completed in the same style, would have far eclipsed in magnificence anything which is to be found at Pollannarua or Anuradhapoorat.\n\n* Once a Week, l. c., p. 281. \u2020 Once a Week, l. c., p. 227.\nMr. Williams, under instructions from the Government conveyed through the Director of Public Works, rebuilt in 1886 the third or topmost flight of steps, with its heavy and elaborate balustrades, as well as the Palace surmounting.*\n\nHe found that the whole of the balustrading on the left side of the steps (looking up towards the main gate) had fallen down, and that the stones were almost entirely buried. The existence of the walling on one side, though in a very ruinous condition, gave him an idea of the original design, and acted as a guide in restoring the missing side.\u2020\n\nThe first work, which involved both time and labour, was the collecting of the missing stones, most of which had to be dug out from a considerable depth below the surface. A good rubble masonry foundation was then laid, the wall rebuilt, and the carved figures placed in position. The other side was then pulled down and rebuilt, the stones being previously numbered. The steps were all reset from the bottom.\n\nThe two \"sinhay\u00e1s\" which surmounted the pedestals on either flank of the lower steps had to be supported by an iron bar let into the chest and base of each, as the forefeet of both had broken off in their fall, the pieces being found and cemented on.\n\nMr. Williams does not think the \"gaja-sinhas\" a pair, one of which had evidently never been completed. From this fact, as well as after careful examination of the work, he concludes that the last flight of steps and vestibule constituted simply the entrance to what was intended for a very elaborate building; moreover, that it was at the last built hurriedly.\u2021\n\n* Why his report should purport to be on \"The Restoration of the Dalad\u00e1 M\u00e1lig\u00e1wa\" is unaccountable, that building being quite distinct from the Palace, as already pointed out.\n\n\u2020 In the middle of 1889 a slight settlement on the left hand side near the top of the upper flight of steps was discovered.\n\n\u2021 Mr. H. Nevill, c.c.s., inclines to the belief that the picturesque ruins were those of the Dalad\u00e1 or \"tooth relic\" sanctuary, and a part only of the royal Palace. The relative positions of the later Palace at Kandy, and the\nOn the rises of some of the steps were found Tamil figures roughly cut in the stone, from which Mr. Williams infers that the workmen were brought from India.\n\nThe walling to the right of the main entrance had entirely disappeared, but as in the case of the balustrade, the existing wall on the opposite side afforded an accurate model for rebuilding.\n\nA monolithic pillar, 13 ft. by 2 ft. 6 in. by 2 ft., stands at each angle of these two halls. Two of these columns had to be lifted up from a depth of some 30 ft. to 40 ft. which was a matter of difficulty owing to limited tackle.\n\nThe lintel of the main doorway had to be lifted up nearly 13 in. to allow of the jambs being raised and set plumb; the jambs, exclusive of foundation, are 11 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 4 in., and the lintel 8 ft. 6 in. long and nearly twice the thickness of the jambs.\n\nAll the platforms upon which these halls rested had to be rebuilt, from the wonderfully carved dado that runs quite round the building; in fact, the whole top work had sunk inwards, and was both out of level and out of the perpendicular.\n\nTwo very beautiful monolithic columns remain unfixed.\n\nThe place they should occupy is pointed out and fixed on the ground plan accompanying the report.\n\nOne is broken into three pieces; holes have been drilled in the broken pieces for doweling them together.\n\nTwo other most elaborately carved columns, whose place is indicated on the plan, were discovered much broken. None of these were fixed owing to the necessity of some support, and from a slight uncertainty about their position. The ground on both sides of the building was full of broken tiles, proving the existence of a former roof.\n\nOne column was found quite by itself at the back of the palace, but its position could not be determined.\n\nA very beautiful stone was found over 4 ft. below the surface some way to the right of the main gateway, pointing to the suspicion that it was on its way to the Wih\u00e1ra below. The stone is cut into the form of a lotus, resting upon a similar inverted flower of much larger dimensions. It was possibly used for placing offerings on.\n\nDalad\u00e1 sanctuary there, a part of the palace precincts, he concludes, afford an existing illustration of this combination of temple and palace.\u2014Taprobanian, February, 1887, p. 8.\nThe two windows were filled in with bricks faced in cement to give a support to the right window, the carved stone over it being badly broken in its fall to the bottom, and for the sake of harmony in the other.\n\nThe frame of the right window was found with the exception of two or three pieces, which could easily be dressed and fitted; but the carved tracery work, save a very few pieces, is still missing. If this frame were fixed, even without the carved work, Mr. Williams thought a replica of the frame of the window in Colombo would be required for the other side. It was found necessary to point most of the joints in cement, to keep off vegetation, which has been the ruin of all ancient buildings in Ceylon.*\n\nMr. Williams proposed that the ground between the palace and the rock should be excavated by running cross trenches to ascertain if any buildings existed there. Another place where excavation might yield interesting and satisfactory results is, he conjectured, at the steps leading into the city on the tank side, as everything that came in and went out of the city must have passed over these steps.\n\nAlthough these proposed excavations were to be taken in hand shortly after the restoration of the Palace, for one reason and another they were ultimately abandoned. It is to be hoped that they may be undertaken by the Archaeological Commissioner when he is free to extend his labours in this direction.\n\nIt is much to be regretted that the restored buildings do not receive sufficient attention, and lack all supervision. The buildings and the surroundings could, with very little trouble and expense, be looked after and kept clear of weeds and jungle, but they are shamefully neglected. Steps should\n\n* For the substantial manner at least in which he executed the work entrusted to him Mr. Williams deserves some credit; but one cannot help agreeing with the remark of Sir Arthur Gordon (now Lord Stanmore), on a visit paid to Y\u00e1pahuwa in 1889, that: \"A pity so much mortar was used: it destroys the character of the ancient stone work.\"\nbe taken to see that the clearing and weeding are done regularly and systematically, and not by fits and starts. The Government have given a vote for this purpose, and some responsible person should be entrusted with the supervision of the work and the necessary outlay on it.\n\nUnder the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance of 1889, section 4, and by Proclamation in the Gazette of November 15, 1889, Y\u00e1pahuwa was constituted a district, and it comprised the following sub-districts:\u2014(1) Hiri\u00fd\u00e1la Hatpattu, (2) Vanni Hatpattu, (3) Demala Hatpattu, and (4) R\u00e1jakum\u00e1ra-vanni Hatpattu of Puttalam. In consequence of the difficulty and at times the impossibility of working the statutory provisions, and the confusing changes which have from time to time been introduced in respect of the constitution of the district and sub-districts, the divisions above referred to do not exist, and the Ordinance is a veritable dead letter in the North-Western Province.\n\nThe population of Y\u00e1pahuwa, according to the Census of 1881, was 8 houses, with 8 families, consisting of 14 males and 10 females, total 24 persons. That for 1891 is given as 10 houses, 10 families, 19 males, and 21 females, making a total of 40 persons. Even making every allowance for the figures employed by the anonymous author of Y\u00e1pahuwa Vistaraya (which partake of the exaggeration common to all Oriental narratives, with regard to the population which once filled the city), who can picture to himself the magnificence and splendour, the life and bustle, the gorgeous processions in which kings and queens were conveyed in golden chariots drawn by gaily caparisoned horses, and recall the gay sites where of old was held high festival with revelry and song, and not realize the sad truth that\u2014\n\nIt was a gallant spot in days of yore,\nBut something ails it now: the place is curst.\n4. The Lord Bishop in addressing the Meeting said he regretted that he was unable to add anything to what had been written by Mr. Modder about these ruins in his Paper. He had hoped when last in the North-Western Province to visit these ruins; but was prevented from doing so. He hoped, however, before long to visit the spot. The Society was much indebted to Mr. Modder for his Paper and for the trouble taken in its preparation.\n\nAbout the description of the window there was one matter Mr. Modder did not refer to; and that was the four-spoked wheel in the middle of the window. He thought Mr. Modder should be asked about this. There were minute descriptions given about all the drawings on the window, but no reference was made to this wheel in the middle of it.\n\n5. A vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Modder for his Paper, on the motion of the Hon. Mr. Swettenham seconded by Mr. Harward.\n\n6.

J. A. Swettenham, C.M.G., Vice-President.\nMr. A. P. Green. Dr. Lisboa Pinto.\nMr. S. G. Lee. Mr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than, C.M.G.\n\nMr. J. Harward and Mr. G. A. Joseph, Honorary Secretaries.\n\nVisitors: Six gentlemen.\n\nBusiness.\n\n1. Read and confirmed Minutes of Meeting held on December 2, 1893.\n2. Read the following Annual Report for 1893, viz.:\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1893.\n\nThe Council of the Ceylon Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society have the honour to lay before this Meeting the Annual Report for the year 1893.\n\nMeetings.\n\nFive General Meetings of this Society have been held during the year. The following is a list of the Papers read:\n\n(1) \"The Nidification of Sturnornis senex (White-headed Starling) and Cissa ornata (Ceylon Blue Jay),\" by Mr. F. Lewis.\n(2) \"Notes on Knox's 'Ceylon' in its Literary Aspect,\" by Mr. H. White, C.C.S.\n(3) \"Kurun\u00e9gala Vistaraya, with Notes on Kurun\u00e9gala, Ancient and Modern,\" by Mr. F. H. Modder.\n(4) \"The Epic of Par\u00e1krama,\" by the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President.\n(5) A Statement by Mr. G. Wall, Vice-President, with regard to the continuation of his series of Papers on the \"Ancient Industries of Ceylon.\"\n(6) \"Chilappatik\u00e1ram,\" by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n(7) \"Ancient Cities and Temples in the Kurun\u00e9gala District: Y\u00e1pahuwa,\" by Mr. F. H. Modder.\n\nMembers.\n\nThe number of Members of the Society is now 200. Of these, 7 are Honorary Members, 17 are Life Members, and 176 are Ordinary Members.\n\nDuring the year 1893 nine Ordinary Members were elected, viz., Messrs. J. Harward, G. A. Joseph, N. Mendis Mudaliy\u00e1r, E. Booth, T. B. Pohath, A. M. Perera, O. Collette, S. G. Lee, and J. E. Pohath.\n\nThe following seven Members have resigned, viz., Rev. J. Scott, Ven. E. F. Miller, Messrs. W. van Langenberg, H. Bois, and H. Fraser, Miss Fr\u00e9doux and the Hon. R. Reid, C.C.S.\nThe Council have the melancholy duty of recording the loss which the Society has sustained by the death of four of its Members:\u2014Col. F. C. H. Clarke, R.A., C.M.G., Vice-President; Dr. F. A. Vanders-magt, Mr. William Goonetilleke, and Mr. M. S. Crawford, C.C.S.\n\nBy the death of Col. Clarke the Society has lost one who took a keen interest in its proceedings, and whose intellectual gifts were of an unusually high order.\n\nMr. William Goonetilleke, though for many years a Member of the Society, took little part in its proceedings, but his loss is one which must be felt most keenly by all who take an interest in Oriental scholarship and research. His brilliant natural gifts, enlarged as they were by years of unceasing study, had earned for him a high reputation in Europe as well as in the East.\n\nThe Council regret to have to call the attention of the Society to the number of Members who owe heavy arrears of subscriptions. In some of these cases they have been obliged to issue a final notice that, unless the arrears are paid before a certain date, the Members\u2019 names will be removed from the Society\u2019s list.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe Library has been enriched during the past year by the addition of 232 volumes, pamphlets, and periodicals. The works added to the collection have been acquired chiefly by the exchange of publications with Societies and learned Institutions in Europe and America.\n\nThe Society has gratefully to acknowledge the substantial additions that continue to be made to the Library by the Right Hon. the Secretary of State in Council for India. Several works of reference, directories, handbooks, &c., referring to India have been presented during the past year.\n\nThe Library is also indebted to the following donors for additions to its collection, viz.:\u2014The Ceylon Government; the Lieut.-Governor of Bengal, James Burgess, F.R.G.S., &c.; the Lord Bishop of Colombo; the Colombo Museum Committee; the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my; Messrs. F. H. M. Corbet, J. M. Perera, and G. A. Joseph.\n\nThe book cases are rapidly filling up again, and the need of greater accommodation for the books has been felt. The Library wants a room large enough to allow of expansion, and to permit of a rational classification of the books upon the shelves. An extension of the building will alone meet the emergency; and the Society therefore welcome the steps taken by the Government to provide, in the near future, premises sufficient for all requirements.\n\nCatalogue.\n\nA simple catalogue (as suggested in the last Annual Report) has been begun, and it is hoped will be completed and printed by the end of 1894. The work of cataloguing has been considerably delayed owing to the non-return of books by Members. Special requisitions (on the authority of the Council) for their return were issued, but in some cases have not been noticed. Members are requested to return any books in their possession called for, in order that the work of cataloguing may be pushed on.\n\nJournals.\n\nThe Society has published during the year the following numbers of its Journal, viz.:\u2014Vol. XII., No. 43, 1892, containing the following\nPapers: (1) \"The Verification of the Ancient Chronicles of Ceylon,\" by the Lord Bishop of Colombo, President; (2) \"Sinhalese Weights and Measures,\" by F. H. Modder; (3) \"The Identification of the Sirivadhanapura of the Mah\u0101wans\u0101, Chapter LXXXV.,\" by the Lord Bishop of Colombo; (4) \"Ritigala,\" by J. B. M. Ridout; (5) \"Notes on the Nidification of Chrysophleagma xanthoderus,\" by F. Lewis.\n\nVol. XI., No. 40, 1890: (1) \"Wouter Schouten's Account of Ceylon,\" translated from the Dutch by P. Freudenberg; (2) \"Henricus van Bystervelt's Embassy to Kandy,\" translated from the Dutch by F. H. de Vos; (3) \"The Animal-shaped Rocks of Kurun\u0113gala,\" by F. H. Modder.\n\nA reprint of Journal No. 12, 1860-61, is nearly completed. Several other Numbers of the Journal having gone out of print, it has been decided to reprint them, and this will be gradually done.\n\nAll arrears in the issue of the publication of the Journals of the Society have been caught up. Vol. XI., No. 41, of 1890, containing Lieut.-Colonel St. George's translation of \"Joao Rodriguez de S\u00e1 e Menezes' Rebelion de Ceylan,\" and the Proceedings of 1889-90, are ready, and are laid on the table with this Report.\n\nThe Journal for 1893, Vol. XII., No. 44, is also ready, and an advance copy of it is laid on the table this evening. This is the first time the Society has been able to bring out its Journal so expeditiously,\u2014the result chiefly of printing Papers in advance of their being read, and to the amalgamation of the Journal and Proceedings under the scheme referred to in the Annual Report for 1892. The Council feel that the thanks of the Society are due both to Mr. H. C. P. Bell for his labours as Editorial Secretary, and to the Government Printer and his Assistants, without whose ready co-operation and assistance so much editing work could not have been accomplished.\n\nThe Council constantly receive applications from Societies and Institutions for exchanges of publications or for donations of our Journal. These applications, though in some cases the Council has been obliged owing to their number to refuse, yet afford gratifying testimony of the increasing appreciation entertained for the publications of the Society.\n\nIndex to Journals.\n\nMr. J. F. W. Gore has laid the Society under an obligation by undertaking the work of compiling a full Index to the Society's publications. In this work he has now made considerable progress. The task, which in itself involves great labour, has been rendered more difficult by the fact that the pages in the reprinted Journals do not correspond with those of the original editions. Mr. Gore has devoted much labour and ingenuity to removing this difficulty, and the Index is being drawn up in such a way that it can be used by those who have the original or reprinted editions or mixed sets. The pagination of all future reprints will be uniform with that of the original editions.\n\nArchaeology.\n\nAll interested in the Archaeological Survey of the Island will read with satisfaction the following brief summary of his year's work with which Mr. H. C. P. Bell, the Archaeological Commissioner (who is one of the Society's Honorary Secretaries), has by request favoured the Council:\n\nThe Archaeological Survey of Anur\u0101dhapura and the North-Central Province has been steadily advanced during 1893.\nIn Anur\u00e1dhapura, with a labour force averaging 100 hands (men, women, and boys), a good deal of fresh excavation was carried out.\n\nNorth of the town three miles, work on the large d\u00e1gaba, known as Kiribat Vehara, was brought to completion. In addition to the quadrant of the outermost circumference (lowest p\u00e9sava) of the d\u00e1gaba laid bare by trenching in 1892, the whole of the inner and a portion of the exterior wall of the quadrangle surrounding the d\u00e1gaba has been traced. The steps and approach on the north, east, and south sides have been opened out, and a shaft, 14 ft. in diameter, sunk down the centre of the d\u00e1gaba, reaching virgin soil at a depth of some 40 ft. from the present summit of the mound. No relic chamber was discovered, the d\u00e1gaba (as was anticipated) having been doubtless gutted centuries ago by invaders from Southern India. Much interesting light has, nevertheless, been gained as to the construction of the large d\u00e1gabas of Anur\u00e1dhapura, among which should in future be classed Kiribat Vehera. The survey shows it to have been approximately 420 ft. in circumference, or somewhat smaller than Mirisw\u00e9tiya D\u00e1gaba.\n\nThe scattered ruins lying in the jungle between J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma and the Vijay\u00e1r\u00e1ma Monastery have proved, under excavation, to be a coterie of Hind\u00fa shrines and appurtenant buildings. In two S\u00edva d\u00e9w\u00e1les the granite lingam was unearthed in situ. This was clearly a distinct Tamil quarter.\n\nExcavation has been commenced (i) at the fringe of the J\u00e9tawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma ruins, near \"the Twin Ponds\" (Kuttam-pokuwu), and (ii) south-east of the town half a mile across the Malwatu-oya, at Tolurela\u2014the ruins whence the colossal sedent Buddha was removed to the Colombo Museum in 1891\u201392. This latter group of ruins is likely to prove a monastery as complete and as replete with interest as those of Vijay\u00e1r\u00e1ma and Pankuliya already dealt with by the Archaeological Survey.\n\nBut chief attention has been concentrated on the Abhayagiriya ruins. By the excavation of two more sections (east, south-east, and south) the whole of the ruined area about the d\u00e1gaba has at length been dug, exposing to view in all nearly 100 buildings, large and small, grouped together in distinct yet conterminous monasteries ranged round the st\u00fapa with a regard to order which excites admiration. With the excavation of the four mandapas of the d\u00e1gaba piazza\u2014the clearing of the four off-set altars of the d\u00e1gaba itself\u2014and the running of a trench round half its base from east to west, and clearing the fallen d\u00e9bris off the three ambulatories (p\u00e9saval)\u2014so as to permit of a true survey of their circumference\u2014work at the Abhayagiriya ruins will be closed, and operations shifted to Jetawan\u00e1r\u00e1ma, or some other equally important quarter of the ancient city.\n\nIn the examination of the antiquities of the North-Central Province, as supplementary to the central work in Anur\u00e1dhapura, great strides have been made during the past year. The Commissioner, in the course of two circuits, visited all known ruined sites in the following divisions:\u2014Ud\u00edyankulam, Ulugalla, and M\u00e1tombuwa K\u00f3ral\u00e9s of Hurulu Pal\u00e1ta, and the Kiralava, Unduruva, and part of the M\u00e1miniya and Kel\u00e9gan K\u00f3ral\u00e9s of Kel\u00e9gan Pal\u00e1ta.\nOf the seventeen k\u00f3ral\u00e9s of the extensive, and in great part wild, North-Central Province, thirteen have now been wholly, or in part, examined, and a great number of hitherto unreported inscriptions copied.\n\nA very thorough exploration of the slopes and peaks of that little known range, Ritigala-kanda, which rises 2,500 ft. sheer from the plain, resulted in the discovery of valuable additions to the antiquities* of the Province, and incidentally to the small but interesting flora recorded from this mist-topped, forest-clad mountain.\n\nAlteration of Rules.\n\nAt a General Meeting held on October 28, 1893, it was resolved that Rule 18 be altered by changing the first word \"five\" to \"four,\" thereby constituting four Members a quorum of the Council instead of five.\n\nOffice of Honorary Treasurer.\n\nYour Council was unfortunately deprived of the valuable services of Mr. F. C. Roles, the Honorary Treasurer, for part of last year, when he left the Island in November. The duties of the Treasurer have since then been kindly undertaken by Mr. A. P. Green.\n\nFinances.\n\nThe following is a statement of the income and expenditure of the Society during the year:\n\nLedger Balances, December 31, 1893.\n\n| Description                                      | Rs. c. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Anur\u00e1dhapura Excavation Account                  | \u2014      |\n| Bank of Madras                                    | 199 26 |\n| Books Account                                     | 1,142 93|\n| Charges Account                                  | 1,152 99|\n| Entrance Fees                                     | \u2014      |\n| General Revenue Account                           | \u2014      |\n| Sale of Journals                                 | \u2014      |\n| Members' Subscription, 1885                       | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1886                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1887                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1888                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1889                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1890                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1891                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1892                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1893                                         | \u2014      |\n| Do. 1894                                         | \u2014      |\n| Printing Account                                 | 1,342 43|\n| Ceylon Savings Bank                               | 642 21 |\n| Honorary Treasurer, Mr. A.

The real value of the Society lies in those studies and researches which it promotes amongst its Members. The Council would welcome with pleasure an increase in the number of Papers giving the results of original research in any of the lines of study, which it is the aim and object of the Society to encourage.\n\n2. The Report was adopted on a motion proposed by the Hon. J. A. Swettenham and seconded by Dr. Pinto.\n\n3.

The President returned thanks on behalf of himself and his colleagues for the trust again reposed in them. He congratulated the Society upon a year which had not been a particularly eventful one, but which had been characterized by a great increase in the business-like way in which the Society's affairs had been conducted, as witnessed in particular by the promptness with which the Journal of Proceedings had been placed in their hands that day. He thought they might look forward, with the help of the Members of the Society, on whom, after all, the success of the Meetings depended, to at least an equally successful and interesting year during 1894.

The following Paper was read by the writer:\u2014\nNOTES ON THE SPECIES AND VARIETIES OF TESTUDO IN THE COLOMBO MUSEUM.\n\nBy Mr. Amyrald Haly, Director of the Colombo Museum.\n\nThe Colombo Museum contains three species of *Testudo* in its collection:\u2014*Testudo elephantina*, Dum. et Bib.; *Testudo elegans*, Sch\u00f6pft; and *Testudo ibera*, Pallas.\n\nThe first of these is the tortoise brought here by the Dutch, which died on March 23 last. This specimen, although mounted and retained in the Museum, can scarcely be said to form part of the Zoological collection: it must be looked upon rather as a reminiscence of old Dutch times, in the same way as a plate, a box, or a sword bearing the monogram \"V. O. C.\" I will therefore say nothing more on this subject, except to refer Members of the Society who wish to become acquainted with the romantic story of our gigantic and extinct tortoises, to Dr. G\u00fcnther's superb Monograph, or to his two popular Papers on the subject, which will be found in \"Nature,\" Vol. XII., 1875.\n\nFor some years I have been very doubtful what species of *Testudo* existed in Ceylon. The collection contains specimens allied to *T. elegans*, but which appeared to me to differ so much from the normal form, that I could only refer them to it provisionally; and there was also a purchased specimen, which certainly belonged to no species as yet known from India or Ceylon. As I had to determine the species of the large Dutch tortoise, I took the opportunity of carefully examining our other specimens.\n\nWe have six stuffed specimens of *T. elegans*, and one young in spirits, presented by Mr. W. Ferguson, who contributed so generously to the formation of the Museum collection. I thought it might be of interest to the Society to point out the great range of variation in this species, especially as I have not seen the subject mentioned in any herpatological works.\nOutgrowth of 4th Vertebral plate in No. 3. Fourth shield broken at A.\n\nOutgrowth of 4th Costal shield behind 3rd Costal in No. 3, left side.\n\nLith. O.S. Colombo.\nNuchals\n\nSupra-candal\n\nVertebral and Costal shield,\nleft side of young.\nTestudo elegans is found from Scinde throughout India to Ceylon. In this Island it is common in all the dry districts, commencing about Puttalam, extending north to Jaffna, and running all along the east coast southwards to Hambantota. If we take specimens Nos. 1 and 2 as normal\u2014and they agree fairly well with the excellent figures given by Dr. Boulenger in the \"Fauna of British India\"\u2014a very slight examination will show that although no one would separate them as distinct species, they vary considerably. In No. 2 the lumps are not so developed, the concentric stri\u00e6 are more strongly marked, and the yellow streaks are more numerous and better developed. If we place No. 6 beside No. 2, the great difference between them strikes us immediately, and if No. 5 did not form a connecting link, no one would hesitate to say that it was a distinct species. It differs from the diagnosis as given by Dr. Boulenger in the first vertebral being no longer than broad, and in the third being much narrower than the corresponding costal; the ground colour of the carapace is brownish yellow, the radiating yellow rays being only indicated by broken black markings; but a comparison with No. 2 shows much greater differences than indicated by this diagnosis. The areolar spaces are very large, whilst the concentric stri\u00e6 are reduced to four or five in number and very strongly marked. In No. 5 the third vertebral shield is also much shorter than the third costal, but the first vertebral is much longer than broad, thus agreeing with the diagnosis. The areol\u00e6 are much the same as in No. 6; the concentric stri\u00e6 are almost half-way between No. 2 and No. 6. The areol\u00e6 are more dotted with black than in No. 6, and although the yellow rays are not quite so much developed as in No. 2, they agree very well with No. 4, the largest of our specimens. But to leave no doubt upon the subject, if we look at the plastrons of the six specimens, we shall see that no two are exactly alike in form or colour, and that whilst No. 5 and No. 6, which are very much alike, differ a good deal from the normal pattern, as represented by No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3, they do not differ more than No. 4.\nIn none of the species of the Chelonia, which develop epidermic plates, do the vertebral scutes exceed five in number, but in specimen No. 3 there are distinctly six; but this is evidently abnormal, the fifth being an outgrowth from the posterior margin of fourth. There is also a projection of the marginal plate, rising between the third and fourth costals on the right hand side. In specimen No. 4 there are also six vertebral scutes, and an up-growth of a marginal scute, but in this case on the left hand side, and placed between the last marginal and last vertebral scute.\n\nThere is no doubt that if the aberrations represented in No. 6, or even in No. 5 and No. 6 together, were confined to individuals from some particular locality, say Java, in which the normal form did not occur, that they would be universally acknowledged by all Zoologists to be a distinct species. Would this be correct? I think there can be no doubt that Mr. Ferguson's specimen represents the young of *T. elegans*. Taking this for granted, the species alters greatly between youth and age. In the adult the carapace is much longer than broad; in the young the length and breadth are almost equal, the margin is scarcely serrated, and the supra-caudal is a broad truncated shield. There is not a trace of a hump, the scutes forming a tessellation over the semi-globular back. The areol\u00e6 occupy almost their whole extent, and are strongly granulated, the concentric stri\u00e6 being represented by a narrow smooth margin. In the plastron, the pectorals are much more developed than in the adult, and the inguinal and axillary shields are large and distinct. Let us suppose that our hypothetical species from Java had precisely the same kind of young, should we be justified in calling it anything more than an Island race?\n\nIn Dr. Boulenger's division of the genus Division 4 contains those species with a very convex carapace and black with yellow lines radiating from areol\u00e6, or brownish with black radiating lines. No. 1 might be described according to the first system of coloration, and No. 4 comes fairly under the second. *T. platynota* of Burma differs from *T. elegans* in the\nplastron not having radiating lines, which is the case in our No. 4. In fact No. 4 would be *platynota* if it were not for the tubercles on the hinder sides of the thighs. If the young of *T. elegans* and *T. platynota* agree, they could scarcely be considered as good species.\n\nIn contemplating these variations, the question of natural selection inevitably arises. The difference in coloration we cannot imagine to be of any advantage to the different individuals, crawling about as they do on the open plains in the mid-day sun, and having no need for concealment. Nor can we imagine that the greater or lesser development of the humps is any more advantageous; in fact there seems to be no point for natural selection to select from, and we are confronted with an inherent tendency to variation, which appears to me to form part of the diagnosis of many species throughout the animal kingdom. That this is the case here is clearly proved by the young. In this little tortoise we find six vertebral scutes, but in this case the number is not increased by a posterior outgrowth of the fourth, but by the division of the second into two nearly equal shields. On the right hand side there are four costal shields, but on the left the second is broken into two large, distinct, well-formed plates, making five costals on that side. I need scarcely point out how interesting a series of individuals of this species would be, illustrating the way in which the adult characters are acquired, and showing whether the abnormal characters of the young are retained or obliterated.\n\nI cannot feel absolute certainty about the third species in our collection, as it has never been figured but once, and that work is not in our library, but the magnificent diagnosis of Dr. Boulenger rarely leaves much doubt as to what species an individual should be referred, and I have therefore entered this specimen on the list as *Testudo ibera*. There are two objections to this being a Ceylon species: first, that this is the only specimen ever procured; and secondly, that the nearest locality from which it is recorded is the\nsouth-east of Persia. The first objection has little weight. The paddy-field deer is by no means uncommon, and yet during nearly twenty years' residence in the Island I have never seen one, nor have my interviews with headmen and promises of large rewards to native huntsmen availed to secure a specimen for the Museum. As for the geographical distribution, this species extends from the Atlantic coast of Africa, all along the south coast of the Mediterranean, through Asia Minor into Persia.\n\nThe British Museum contains a specimen of the closely allied species *T. leithii*, found in Egypt and Syria, which is labelled Scinde. This Dr. Boulenger accounts for by the hypothesis that Dr. Leith purchased a specimen imported into that country. This may be the case with this individual. It is useless, however, to discuss the question, until we obtain more information; suffice it to state that it was purchased of a man who said he picked it up on the seashore at Vellawatta, and that he had seen the species before.\n\n3.

In the absence of a more definite date, it is not possible to say if the presentation of the Sinhalese cannon to the Dutch took place in 1745 or 1746. The word pemini, \u201carrived\u201d or \u201capproached,\u201d seems, however, to point to the commencement of the \u1e62aka year, which may, therefore, fall in the latter half of 1745.\n\n\u2021 Krodha, in Indian astronomy the 59th year of the 60 years cycle of \u1e0dvara or Jupiter.\n\u00a7 Dis\u00e1wa stands for dis\u00e1ka, meaning \"quarter\" or \"direction,\" here technically used as the title of a chief of a district.\n\n|| The fact that Lewuke was the Dis\u00e1wa of the Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s in 1745 is, so far as I know, not stated in any of the records hitherto published. We have here the earliest authentic reference to him in name and title, by which we are able now to identify this Lewuke with the Dis\u00e1wa of Four K\u00f3ral\u00e9s who played an important part in the negotiations of the Dutch with the S\u00edghalese in the last century.\n\nLewuke was a staunch Buddhist, and as such he did much to patronize his religion. He restored vih\u00e1ras, and endowed them with lands for the maintenance of the priesthood. A representation of him \"wearing the peculiar red conical hat of the day\" may be found painted on the right wall inside the Dambullakanda vih\u00e1r\u00e9\u2014a rock-cut temple in Walgam Pattuwa of Kinigoda K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\u2014(See \"Report on the K\u00e9galla District,\" Sessional Paper XIX., 1892, p. 39.)\n\n\u00b6 Tenann\u0113ha (lit. \"the lord of a place\") means an \"officer\" or \"minister.\" It is a compound of tenan and vehe, the semivocal v being here assimilated to the preceding n. The origin of this n is not clear. It may, as Professor Kuhn suggests, be a relic of the sign of the genitive plural. We know, however, that it is always added to the stem of S\u00edghalese nouns signifying animate objects in the formation of oblique cases in the plural, as gurunta satun, vis\u00e1kavange, velandungen, &c. Tena or tena (Sans. sth\u0101na) is used here in the sense of \"one in possession of a place or situation.\" Vehe is Sans. Bhavat (nom. hav\u00e1n), used as a term of respect in speaking of a person. The third person singular present indicative of bh\u00e9 is in M\u0101h\u0101r\u0101shtri and Hindi Prakrit, havai, from which a participle havat (nom. h\u00e1v\u00e1n for bh\u00e1v\u00e1n) can be formed. It may well be that the S\u00edghalese vaha or v\u0101ha comes from this Prakrit form havat of Sans. bhavat: havat becoming by metathesis vahat, then v\u0101hay or vahay, and finally v\u0113ha or vaha. In vahanse we have again the insertion of the n before the suffix se.\n\n** Visin in S\u00edghalese, considered an instrumental affix, is in reality an altered form of Sanskrit or P\u00e1li vasena, the instrumental of vasam used adverbially (Childer's P\u00e1li Dict.) and in composition with the preceding word.\n\n\u2020\u2020 Dakkav\u00e1pu stands for the past participle of causative dakhavanaw\u00e1.\n\n\u2021\u2021 Tuwakkuva, a word of Persian origin meaning \"firearm,\" which appears under various forms in many languages of Europe and Asia.\n\n4. The following Paper was read by the writer:\u2014\nKOSTANTINU HATANA.\n\nBy F. W. de Silva, Mudaliy\u00e1r, Galle.\n\n*Kostantinu Ha\u1e6dana* is the title of a little poem in Sinhalese composed by a native Christian (whose name I am unable to find out) about the early part of the seventeenth century, probably. It consists of nearly 187 verses in various metres, and is very interesting reading, treating, as it does, of the successful march of Constantino de S\u00e1, the great Portuguese Captain-General, against the forces of M\u00e1yadunna under the rebel chiefs Anthony Baretto and Kangara. It is an elegant composition, and reflects great credit on the author. He appears to have studied the standard \u0112\u1e37u works very carefully, and to have read a great deal of Hind\u00fa Mythology (to judge by the allusions)\u2014an acquaintance with which is so essential to a Sinhalese poet. I find, moreover, that he has made a special study of Alagiyawanna\u2019s works, such as the *Kusa J\u0101taka*, *Subh\u00e1sita*, and *Sewul Sand\u00e9saya*, and is indebted to him for several beautiful ideas. A perusal of the work affords evidence of the fact that his sympathies were on the side of the Portuguese; but it is nevertheless characterized by fairness and moderation of tone. I incline to think that the writer was an eye-witness of the stirring events narrated by him, as the account given of the progress of the campaign is so graphic and vivid.\n\nAlthough the subject of the poem does not lend itself to a description of all the features of a *mah\u00e1 k\u00e1vy\u0101*, he has introduced, in their proper places, forest scenes, aquatic sports, &c., to enhance the interest of his narrative. The *al\u0101\u1e45k\u0101ra* introduced into the poem is both chaste and beautiful.\n\nI have the honour to lay before this Society the results of my study of this poetical work, in the hope that they will be\nof interest to members in connection with the recent publication of the younger De S\u00e1\u2019s account of the Rebellion in Ceylon. The account, as far as it goes, is in perfect agreement with De S\u00e1\u2019s narrative in the main. It must be borne in mind that this work deals solely with De S\u00e1\u2019s march against the forces of M\u00e1yadunna, and the causes which led up to it. But the great rebellion in which De S\u00e1 suffered defeat at the hands of R\u00e1ja Sinha II. forms the subject of Mah\u00e1 Ha\u1e6dana, another Sinhalese poem by Kirim\u0119tiy\u00e1we D\u00e1si m\u0119ti. I hope to consider this book in a subsequent Paper. I may state, en passant, that Kirim\u0119tiy\u00e1wa\u2019s work is inferior in literary merit to the native Christian poet\u2019s composition. So much for the general features of the work. Let me now proceed to give a brief summary of the contents.\n\nThe two rebel chiefs, Barett\u00f3 and K\u00e1ngara, find favour by means of deceit and treachery at the Kandyan Court, and are granted \u00dava and Tunkinda (verse 15). From Badulla\u2014where the preparations are made\u2014an expedition is organized to gain Vellassa, Batticaloa, and Vellaw\u00e1ya; and they proceed to attack the fortress of Sabaragamuwa, spreading disaffection among the inhabitants of Denawaka Pasra\u1e6da, M\u00e1tara, Kukulu K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and Pasy\u00f3dun K\u00f3ral\u00e9 (verses 17, 18), in opposition to the Kandyan king, to whom they now owe allegiance. Thereafter they proceed against the king himself,\u2014an act of perfidy which is very happily illustrated by our poet:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dca\u0db0\u0db1\u0dd3 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dbd \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca} & \\quad \\text{\u0dc0} \\\\\n\\text{\u0db8\u0dd2\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dbd \u0db8\u0dd6\u0dbd\u0dcf \u0db8\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2} & \\quad \\text{\u0dc0} \\\\\n\\text{\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dad\u0ddd\u0dad\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0dd3 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd2 \u0db8\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca} & \\quad \\text{\u0dc0} \\\\\n\\text{\u0db4\u0dcf\u0dc3\u0dca\u0dc0\u0db1 \u0d85\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dbd \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd2} & \\quad \\text{\u0dc0}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nLike the Asur Basma who, obtaining a boon from \u00cdswara, turned against that deity himself and gave chase to kill him.\n\nHe and his sons escape: they are taken and confined in some remote place in the Wanni, the palace robbed, and the guards put to death. With the Wanniyans they now begin\nto fight the Portuguese; and being unsuccessful invite over from the Ch\u00f3la country the Prince M\u00e1yadunna (who had been in hiding there), promising to support his pretensions; and recommence their hostilities against the Portuguese. The country being now in a disturbed condition\u2014dissensions in every part of it\u2014the authorities and the priests in Colombo meet for consultation, and decide upon appealing for help to the Viceroy at Goa. This personage, on receiving intimation of the unsatisfactory state of Ceylon affairs, sends Constantino de S\u00e1, as being the best man he could find, to set matters right. De S\u00e1 lands in Colombo with a band of trusty followers, and hastens to Malw\u00e1na, the Portuguese sanatorium. From this place he goes on to M\u0119nikkadaawara (in Beligal K\u00f3ral\u00e9) on business connected with the expedition he is about to undertake, and returns to Malw\u00e1na; whence, after satisfying himself of the allegiance of his men, he sets forth, attended by captains and other officers, in great pomp and state on his march of conquest. The route taken by the General is through the following places:\n\n| M\u00e1piti\u011fama | Teppan\u00e1wa |\n|------------|-----------|\n| Degamboda  | Nivitigalla |\n| Kananwela Ferry | Ma\u1e0dawela |\n| Kosgama    | K\u00f6nti\u021biya |\n| B\u00f3p\u00e9       | Pollemur\u00e9 |\n| Puwakpi\u021biya | Balangoda |\n| S\u00edtawaka   | M\u0119dd\u00e9gam Nuwara |\n\nA lively description of each of the villages on the way is given. He destroys some of the villages by fire, including M\u0119dd\u00e9gam Nuwara, which he burns to the ground, with all its palaces, houses, &c. At Lell\u00f3pi\u021biya the encounter with the enemy takes place with disastrous results to the forces of M\u00e1yadunna and the rebel chiefs. The king escaping, the chiefs are taken captive\u201432 in all, chained two by two\u2014and are brought to Malw\u00e1na; into which De S\u00e1 makes a triumphant entry from his successful expedition against the Sinhalese forces.\nTo the above r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the work I should wish to add a few observations suggested by some passages in the book, letting the poet speak for himself where desirable.\n\nThat our author was a native Christian is abundantly clear from the opening verses:\n\nI adore Jesus Christ, the chief of all mankind, who is full of loving-kindness.\n\nI adore the deity born of the womb of the Virgin Mary, like unto a flame emitted by a lamp of solar rays.\n\nWe read that De S\u00e1 was highly connected, being a descendant of the family of the Master of the Robes to the Portuguese kings,\u2020 and that he was a distinguished General, who had served in other parts of the world with conspicuous ability. The vessel which brought De S\u00e1 appears to have been a war-ship which had taken part in previous similar expeditions, and the course of which on the high seas was guided by the stars.\n\nThe navigation, it is said, was done according to the m\u00e1limi s\u0101straya (laws of navigation?). The vessel itself is quaintly described:\n\n---\n\n\u2020\u2014Kusa J\u00e1taka\nThe great garu\u1e0da-like ship, its vanquished enemies the snakes, its sails the wings of this fabulous bird, arrived at the port of Kolom-pura (Colombo).\n\nThe march of the enemy to the field is a very imposing scene: we read that the General was carried in a State litter gaily decked. I cannot resist the temptation to quote this stanza for its beautiful versification:\n\nEntering a beautiful palanquin set with gold and gems, inlaid with ivory and decked with festoons of pendant pearls put in motion by waving ch\u0101maras.\n\nThe Captains rode in palanquins amid the noise of drums and trumpets. The poet says that the whole army moving in this manner presented the spectacle of the mighty ocean rolling on land\u2014a favourite comparison with Oriental poets for a tumultuous army on the march. The villages passed on the way are graphically described, with details as to the halting stations. At Sit\u0101waka the poet introduces us to a bevy of maidens disporting themselves in the river, and I leave him to describe these water-nymphs in his own inimitable style:\n\nDressing themselves in red cloths, taking in their hands drinking horns, tying up their hair bound with flowers into a firm knot, drinking wine moderately with the wantons, in this manner the pretty maidens disported themselves in the water.\n\n*Garu\u1e0da*, the bird and vehicle of Vishnu. He is generally represented as being something between a man and a bird, and considered as sovereign of the feathered kind: he was the son of K\u0101\u015byapa and Vin\u0101\u1e6da and younger brother of Aruna.\u2014Clough.\nMaidens, who in beauty excelled the heavenly nymphs, plunging into the water, captivate the eyes and minds of onlookers by the display of their charms.\n\nThe beauty of the original is almost lost in translation.\n\nThe destruction by fire of Meddegam Nuwara appears to have been complete\u2014the whole town, consisting of the Chitrakuta vimana, Magul maaluwa (Audience Hall), the royal kitchen, the dining hall, the hot-water bath, the queen\u2019s apartments, and the stately mansion of Baretto, being burnt to the ground. Here is a battle-piece:\n\nSome spearing the enemies put the bodies away from them, while others by one shot kill two or three at a time. Some spare those who beg for mercy, while others seize and bind those who are about to flee, without killing them.\n\nI notice that the kastana in the days of our poet was not the innocent-looking ornament which we now find dangling by the side of a Mudaliyar on official occasions, but a formidable weapon used with deadly effect on the plains of Lellopitiya.\n\nWe read in the published narrative that the General \u201chad a gallant bearing added to a shapely, well-proportioned form and figure, tall and strong, with an expression at once pleasing and manly.\u201d This is confirmed by what our chronicler says with regard to the hero\u2019s personal attractions. In this verse his person is described:\nThe village maidens of birth, on account of their steadfast gaze at our Governor without winking, who in beauty is the Ananga of old before he was reduced to ashes, resembled the heavenly nymphs.\n\nI think that this description could not be improved upon, and that the younger S\u00e1 must confess himself beaten by our poet in this particular. The concluding verse runs thus:\n\nMay the sovereign be long-lived!\nMay the enemy be vanquished!\nMay prosperous times be nigh!\nMay the whole world advance in prosperity!\n\nPatriotic sentiments which, I suppose, we can all heartily re-echo with pleasure.\n\nThis work, of which I have attempted to give a brief sketch to-night, is very rare. I cannot undertake to say that my copy is complete, though the narrative goes on without a break, as I could not get another copy for the purpose of collation. My object in bringing the book to the notice of this learned Society is, partly to supplement with fuller details the meagre account given in the published narrative about M\u00e1yadunna, and partly to interest Members in the study of a work, unique in its kind, which is the only \"war poem,\"\u2014if I may be allowed the term,\u2014the Mah\u00e1 Ha\u1e6dana excepted, which we have in Sinhalese, so far as I have been able to ascertain.*\n\n5.

The following Paper was read by the author:\u2014\nWHICH GAJA BAHU VISITED INDIA?\n\nBy W. P. RA\u00d1ASINHA.\n\nIn the interesting Paper on *Chilappatik\u00e1ram*, read by the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my on October 28, 1893, before this Society, he inferred that the Gaja B\u00e1hu mentioned in that poem was King Gaja B\u00e1hu I., who reigned in Ceylon about 113 A.D. In the discussion that followed, our President (the Bishop of Colombo) was rather inclined to question the soundness of the conclusion. Since then I have turned over a few pages of Sinhalese literature and archaeology, and I am glad to find that the following references taken therefrom corroborate the testimony furnished by Tamil literature, that Gaja B\u00e1hu I. did indeed visit the Ch\u00f3la country in South India, and did in fact introduce into Ceylon the worship of Pattini.\n\nThe *Mah\u00e1wa\u1e47sa* speaks of Gaja B\u00e1hu I. as the son of Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa, but makes no mention of his having gone to India. He began his reign in 113 A.D.; Gaja B\u00e1hu II. began his reign in 1143 A.D.\n\nIn the *R\u00e1ja Ratn\u00e1karaya*, a history of Ceylon of some authority, written in 1542 A.D. by Walagampaya Terunn\u00e1ns\u00e9, it is recorded:\n\n\"The brother of Mahalud\u00e9 was Vakn\u0113tis (Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa). His son was Gaja B\u00e1hu. Having heard that in those days the inhabitants of La\u1e47k\u00e1 were in servitude at K\u00e1veri he was vexed, and taking the iron club made by his father, which was wont to be carried by fifty warriors, he struck the sea with it, and by the power of his merits caused the sea to be divided, went over the Ch\u00f3la kingdom without so much as wetting his feet, and having exhibited his prowess brought back the prisoners of war and the tooth-relic and the alms-bowl which the Tamils had taken away, and went to heaven after performing many meritorious acts, both secular and religious.\"\n\nThe whole of this passage, except as regards the statement that the tooth-relic was brought back to La\u1e47k\u00e1 by Gaja B\u00e1hu.\nI. (which, according to the President, was not in Ceylon till the fourth century A.D.), is supported by an earlier work, the Puj\u0101valiya, which was composed by a monk called Buddhaputra, Chief of Mayurap\u00e1da Pirivena, about the year 1288 A.D. or, according to B. Gunas\u00e9kara Mudaliy\u00e1r, 1309 A.D.\n\nThe passage I refer to is as follows:\n\n\"His (V\u0113h\u0113p\u2019s) son Vakn\u0113h\u0113tissa (Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa) reigned three years. His son King Gaja B\u00e1hu having heard that during his father\u2019s reign men were sent to K\u00e1veri for service, sent for his ministers, and having inquired about it became indignant, and having taken the iron mace which his father caused to be made for him, accompanied his warriors, and having taken the mace, which was wont to be lifted up by fifty men, in his right hand and circumambulated, struck the sea with it, and by his merits divided the sea and went over to the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a country without wetting his feet; and having exhibited his prowess, and having captured twice as many as those who went to serve at K\u00e1veri, and enjoined that thenceforth none should go to work at K\u00e1veri, came back, and having kept guards round the shore, and having published his victory by beat of tom-tom, and having done many meritorious acts, reigned twenty-two years and went to heaven.\"\n\nTwo other works of independent authority refer to the same incidents in a fuller form, explaining the cause of the invasion of Gaja B\u00e1hu I. The works I allude to are the Mah\u00e1 R\u00faj\u00e1valiya and Wanni R\u00e1j\u00e1waliya.\n\nThe following passage I take over from Mah\u00e1 R\u00e1j\u00e1waliya and translate thus:\n\nHis son Vann\u0113si (Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika) reigned three years. During his reign the King of Ch\u00f3\u1e37a having come to this La\u1e45k\u00e1 with Tamils from the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a country, took away to the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a country 12,000 prisoners of war. During the reign of Gajab\u00e1, son of King Senanambapa, whilst he was going about the city in the night he heard an old widow\u2019s lamentations because her two sons were carried away by the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a king, and thinking that there must be some injustice in the city he marked the door with lime and went to his palace. In the morning the king sent for his ministers and inquired of them about the rights and wrongs in the city. Then the ministers said, \"It is like a wedding house of Indra.\" Then the king\u2019s wrath was kindled against the ministers, and he sent for the woman of the house whose door had been marked with lime; and she said, \"When the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a king carried...\"\naway 12,000 prisoners my two sons were taken away too, and therefore I was crying.\u201d Then the king, having comforted the poor woman, was displeased with the doings of his father; and having said, \u201cI shall go to the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a country,\u201d went to Jaffna with an army, and having given leave to the army he went with the warrior N\u00edla and struck the sea with his mace and divided the waters and went to the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a city, and having intimidated the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a king sat on the throne like Indra, king of gods. N\u00edla getting hold of the elephants of the city struck one against the other and killed both. When thus the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a city was being devastated the ministers informed the Ch\u00f3\u1e37ian king of it. Then the Ch\u00f3\u1e37ian king asked King Gajab\u00e1, \u201cAre the Sinhalese people come to destroy this city?\u201d Then King Gajab\u00e1 said, \u201cExcept the small boy who accompanied me hither, there is no army with me,\u201d and sent for the warrior N\u00edla and kept him by his side. Then the Ch\u00f3\u1e37ian king asked him, \u201cWhy did your Majesty come alone?\u201d Then King Gajab\u00e1 answered, \u201cYour Majesty\u2019s father during my father\u2019s reign brought 12,000 prisoners\u2014I am come to take them away.\u201d Then the Ch\u00f3\u1e37ian king replied, \u201cOne of our ancestors fought the gods and conquered them: shall I give your people back?\u201d Then King Gaja B\u00e1hu said, \u201cI shall destroy this city and reduce it to ashes; will you give me for my people 24,000 men or not?\u201d and having pressed sand produced water, and having squeezed the iron mace also produced water, and having thus enlightened the Ch\u00f3\u1e37ian king obtained 24,000 as prisoners with interest, and also the gem anklet of the goddess Pattin\u012b, and the arms of the four gods of the four temples, and the alms-bowl which was carried away during the reign of King Walagamb\u00e1; and having warned him not to do such a thing in future, came to Lank\u00e1 with the prisoners, sent them to their own lands, and the rest he placed in Alutk\u00faru K\u00f3ral\u00e9, and having reigned twenty-four years he went to heaven.\n\nIt will be observed that no mention is here made of the restoration of the tooth-relic as recorded in the Rajaratn\u00e1karaya. I think the reference in the Rajaratn\u00e1karaya is an interpolation by some ignorant copyist. But it is interesting to note that the fact that some Ch\u00f3\u1e37ians were brought over and placed in Alutk\u00faru K\u00f3ral\u00e9 during this king\u2019s reign is supported by an old tradition to the same effect still current amongst the Sinhalese.*\n\n*Cf. the name of the village Telingip\u00e1ta in the R\u00e1gam pattuwa of Alutk\u00faru K\u00f3ral\u00e9.\u2014B., Hon. Sec.\nThe carrying away of the alms-bowl by the Tamils during the reign of Wat\u1e6dag\u00e1min\u00ed Abhaya is related in chapter XXIII, of the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nsa.\n\nI would now refer to a poem called Gajab\u00e1 Kath\u00e1va, in Sinhalese. Neither the date of the work nor the name of the author is given in the book, but all that appears in the R\u00e1jawaliya is related in it. Gajab\u00e1\u2019s father\u2019s name appears in this work as Bapa R\u00e1ja. I thought that Bapa meant father, and not one of the names of the King Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa. In the Wanni R\u00e1jawaliya he is called Vann\u00e9sinamb\u00e1 R\u00e1ja. In this book the following occurs:\n\n\"E Sinamb\u00e1 Rajuge put Gaja B\u00e1hu,\" \"that Sinamba\u2019s son Gaja B\u00e1hu.\" In the R\u00e1jawaliya which is in the Museum Library the words \"ohu put Pinvan\u0119dzi nam raja\" occur, which I read \"ohu pit Vanesinam raja,\" \"his son Vann\u00e9sinam R\u00e1ja.\" A few lines below this the following words occur:\n\n\"Gajab\u00e1 Sinanambaba rajuge put,\" \"Gajab\u00e1, son of King Sinanambaba,\" which I take to be a clerical error for \"Vann\u00e9sinambapa.\" Whether Bapa, which occurs in the Gajab\u00e1 Kath\u00e1va and in the R\u00e1jawaliya, means \"father,\" or was another name for Va\u1e47kan\u00e1sika Tissa, it is difficult to say.\n\nMr. Bell mentions Tiyambar\u00e1h\u00e9n\u00e1 as a d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 sacred to Pattini Deviy\u00f3, and one of the oldest in the K\u00e9galla District. The sannasa carries its founding back to Gaja B\u00e1hu I., the rescuer of the Sinhalese captives in India. The date given in this sannasa is, as Mr. Bell says, palpably wrong, but, as he adds, probably crystallizes some old tradition that Gaja B\u00e1hu caused to be built at Kelani Nawagomuwa a d\u00e9w\u00e1l\u00e9 for the gem anklet of Pattini, and afterwards had it removed to Tiyambar\u00e1h\u00e9n\u00e1.*\n\n* \"When 1,088 years had expired from the death of our Lord Buddha, in the 852nd year after the establishing of the Buddhist religion in Lank\u00e1, the King Gaja B\u00e1hu, having heard that his subjects of the Island of Lank\u00e1 were carried away as slaves to K\u00e1veri,\" &c.\u2014Archaeological Survey of Ceylon: Report on the K\u00e9galla District, page 56.\nDiscounting the poetic description as regards the division of water by striking the sea with the iron mace, the exploits of N\u012bla in the city of Ch\u00f3\u1e37a, and the production of water from sand and the iron mace, there is, I think, no reason to doubt that the king who went to the Ch\u00f3\u1e37a country was Gaja B\u00e1hu I., and that it was he who established the worship of Patt\u012b\u1e47i in Ceylon.\n\nWe ought to be thankful to Mr. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my for having brought to the notice of this Society the Tamil poem Chilappatik\u00e1ram, which is of great interest from various points of view, not the least of which is its remarkable confirmation of Sinhalese history; for, from an entirely foreign source, the accuracy of many of our historical works besides the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1\u1e43sa has been established, as to the time when one of its ancient kings reigned in Ceylon, and as to how he introduced the worship of one of the most popular goddesses into the Island.\n\n4. Mr. Arun\u00e1chalam inquired of Mr. Ranasinha if any explanation was possible of the omission of the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1\u1e43sa to record so important an event as the visit of Gaja B\u00e1hu to India, and the introduction by him into Ceylon of the worship of the goddess Patt\u012b\u1e47i.\n\nMr. Ranasinha said that the Sinhalese chronicle did not purport to be a complete history of each and every Sinhalese king's reign, but a good deal of selection was exercised by the chronicler. The Mah\u00e1v\u00e1\u1e43sa was a history not so much of Ceylon as of Buddhism in Ceylon, and perhaps the monkish chronicler preferred to omit all reference to the introduction of a worship that the orthodox Buddhists would not approve of.\n\nMr. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my: \"The question is, which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India at the time of the Chera King, Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan? In my Paper read in October last I expressed the view that it was Gaja B\u00e1hu I. I am now glad to find that view confirmed by the Sinhalese authorities cited by Mr. Ranasinha. While collecting materials for a Paper on the age of certain Tamil poets, I have come across many facts which leave no doubt whatever as to the correctness of this conclusion. I shall to-night state only one argument.\n\n\"Those who have some acquaintance with Tamil literature are aware that the term Vallal is specially applied to twenty-one persons for their unbounded munificence. They were divided into three classes of seven each, and the third class included two Tamil princes, P\u00e9kan and Pari, who were contemporaries. P\u00e9kan had a quarrel with his wife Kannakai\u2014whose name was the same as the heroine of Chilappatik\u00e1ram\u2014and turned her out of doors. Many friends interfered, and amongst them Kapilar and Paranar, both of whom addressed\nseveral poems to the prince on the subject, and brought about a reconciliation. Kapilar's friend and one of his patrons was Prince P\u0101ri, and on P\u0101ri's death the aged poet's untiring endeavours to wed P\u0101ri's portionless daughter\u2014for P\u0101ri died poor\u2014to some one of the great princes of Southern India, and his visits to court after court with that object, form an interesting chapter in Tamil literature.\n\n\"Paranar's chief patron was the Chera King Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, who, according to the Chilappatik\u0101ram, was visited by Gaja B\u0101hu. Paranar addressed to Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan several poems, including the fifth Pattu of the Padittuppattu, and received from him several important gifts, including Umbatkattuv\u0101ri.\n\n\"These are all matters to be gathered from our ancient Tamil poems,* and the poems addressed by Kapilar and Paranar on the occasion above mentioned are also extant.\n\n\"For the purposes of the present investigation we have to remember that the two Valla's, P\u00e9kan and P\u0101ri, and the two poets, Kapilar and Paranar, were contemporaries, and that the Chera King Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan was Paranar's patron. Now P\u0101ri is mentioned in one of the hymns of Sundara M\u016brtti thus:\u2020 \"Even if you flatter cowards by styling them Bhimas and Arguanas, and misers P\u0101ris, who will reward you now-a-days, O ye poets?\" Sundara M\u016brtti, as you are aware, is one of the three authors of the sacred hymns of the Tamils known as Devaram. Where is the earliest authentic reference to him? The researches of Dr. Hultszch enable us to answer this. Plate No. 38 given in the South Indian Inscriptions, vol. II., part II., page 152 et seq., which is a copy of one of the inscriptions at the temple at Tanjore, gives the weight of the images worshipped at that temple and, amongst them, of the images of Sundara M\u016brtti and Paravaiy\u0101r his wife. The inscription is dated the twenty-ninth year of the reign of R\u0101ja-R\u0101ja-d\u0113va, which has been ascertained to be 1033 of the Christian era (South Indian Inscriptions, vol. I., page 169). I do not ask you to say how many centuries must have elapsed after Sundara M\u016brtti's death before he and his wife came to be worshipped in a temple of Siva; but this fact remains that P\u0101ri must have been long prior to 1033, which date is at least 100 years before Gaja B\u0101hu II. began his reign in Ceylon. As there are only two Gaja B\u0101hus between the first and twelfth centuries of the Christian era, and as P\u0101ri, Kapilar, Paranar, and Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan were contemporaries, the prince who visited Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan was undoubtedly Gaja B\u0101hu I.; and as this visit must have occurred during this reign, that is, between 113-125 after Christ, we are able to fix the dates of the Chera King Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, and the two poets Kapilar and Paranar, as prior to the second half of the second century.\"\n\nMr. J. Harward said that, in view of the record made so persistently in the several Sinhalese works cited by Mr. Ranasingha, the tradition that Gaja B\u0101hu I. visited India appeared to him worthy of acceptance as a bon\u00e2 fide tradition, and as that was constantly associated with the introduction into Ceylon of the worship of the goddess Pattini we need not hesitate to believe that Gaja B\u0101hu I. introduced that worship.\n\n* Consult, among others, Chirup\u0101nat\u1e6duppaddai, Patituppattu, Puran\u0101nur, &c.\n\u2020 Sunkaramurttik\u0113v\u0101ram in Tiruppukalur Midukkal\u0101t\u0101\u1e47ai.\nBut it did not necessarily follow that Chilappatik\u00e1ram was written in the time of Gaja B\u00e1hu I. He could conceive of a learned society discussing in 3000 A.D. the age of Tennyson's Idylls of the King, and arguing that Tennyson was a contemporary of King Arthur. If earlier specimens of English literature did not exist for purposes of comparison, Tennyson's work might be ante-dated by a thousand years. It would be well, therefore, to prove the age of Chilappatik\u00e1ram by the internal evidence of the style, language, &c., and he hoped that this aspect of the question would receive the attention of Tamil scholars.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my said that the author of the Chilappatik\u00e1ram was the brother of King Senkuttuvan, whom Gaja B\u00e1hu I. visited, whereas Tennyson could not be cited as King Arthur's brother.\n\nMr. Harward said that it was not unusual in some countries and some ages for poets to write under the name of persons who had flourished at an earlier date.\n\nMr. P. R\u00e1man\u00e1than said that the internal evidence of the style and language of Chilappatik\u00e1ram proved its age, and he trusted that Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my would collect all such evidence and make it part of his next Paper.\n\nThe Chairman stated that it was interesting to find that the traditions of both sides of the Gulf of Mann\u00e1r concurred in alleging that it was Gaja B\u00e1hu I. who visited India and introduced the worship of Pattini into Ceylon, and the point might be considered as established. In addition to the authorities quoted he referred to that of Valentyn, who seemed to have drawn some of the materials for his ancient history from Sinhalese works not now extant in Ceylon. Valentyn (vol. V., p. 67) stated that Wankamasika R\u00e1ja (who reigned three years) was succeeded by his son Beeja R\u00e1ja, who reigned twelve years, during which an expedition arrived from India, which took 12,000 captives. Valentyn's narrative went on to relate the reign of Gaja B\u00e1hu I., describing his visit to India, and giving many details of his reputed exploits. He would take this opportunity to point out that the title of Mr. Ranasingha's Paper, \"Which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India?\" suggested that only one Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India. We had no materials before us to determine the question whether or not Gaja B\u00e1hu II. also visited India. He felt sure the Society was very grateful to Mr. Ranasingha for his interesting Paper.\n\nA vote of thanks to Mr. Ranasingha for his Paper was accorded on a motion proposed by the Chairman.\n\n5. Mr. Harward read the following Paper:\u2014\nARCH\u00c6OLOGY OF THE WANNI.\n\nBy Mr. J. P. Lewis, C.C.S.\n\n\"The Wanny\"* was the name given to that part of northern Ceylon which is bounded on the north by the Jaffna lake, on the south by the Aruvi river and the District of Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya, which now forms a part of the North-Central Province, on the east by the District of Trincomalee, and on the west by the District of Mann\u00e1r.\n\nRoughly speaking, the District of Vavuniya forms the southern half of the Wanni, and that of Mullaittivu the northern half. The area of the Dutch Wanni was computed to be about 2,000 square miles, while that of the two districts above named is 1,864 square miles.\n\nThe name Wanni in the Sinhalese chronicles appears to have had a more extensive application than that given it by the Dutch, for it included Nuwarakal\u00e1wiya, which was the Mah\u00e1 Wanni.\n\nBald\u00e6us applies the name, \"the country of the Wannias,\" to the Mann\u00e1r mainland as far north as the Jaffna lake.\u2020\n\nIt is however with the first signification given above that the name is used in this Paper.\n\n* It is not certain what the meaning of the name is. Several derivations have been suggested. Tennent mentions two, \"one significant of the forest (wa\u1e47am) which covers it to a great extent; the other of the intense heat which characterizes the region\" (vol. II., p. 508, 4th edition); while according to Cordiner the name means \"scarcity\" (p. 295). One of the meanings of the word Wanni is fire, but the last two derivations are far-fetched, and so is that from val, denoting the hardness of the soil. According to the Kalpeddu, the district took its name from the Wanniyas from India, who colonized it. In accordance with this view another derivation has been suggested from the Indian Bunniyah, or merchant, but the Tamil form of this is Waniyan, which could not become Wanni. There is a Wanni Hatpattu in the North-Western Province.\n\n\u2020 Churchill's \"Voyages,\" vol. III., pp. 709, 719.\nThe principal arch\u00e6ological remains are to be seen in the ancient Sinhalese tanks, most of which have been described in detail in Mr. H. Parker's reports.* These remains consist of massive embankments, such as that at Tannirmurippu, where the bund is about 2\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) miles long; at P\u00e1va\u1e6dku\u1e37am, where it is 2 miles long; M\u00e1ma\u1e0du 1\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) mile, Iratperiyaku\u1e37am and Kanukk\u00e9\u1e47i 1 mile; and many of smaller dimensions.\n\nThe bunds are generally faced on the inner side with a pitching of stone (alaikallu Tamil, relap\u00e1na Sin.), as at P\u00e1va\u1e6dku\u1e37am, Iratperiyaku\u1e37am, Pan\u1e0d\u00e1ra\u1e45ku\u1e37am, &c.\n\nIn the bunds are found the remains of ancient stone sluices, which were usually provided with a bisokotuwa, or valve-pit, built of \"long slabs of stone of considerable breadth and small thickness, laid on edge and fitted together with great care.\" Behind the stonework is a backing of brickwork. There are five of these sluices with bisokotuwass still to be seen at P\u00e1vatku\u1e37am, and Mr. Parker says, \"so far as I am aware this is the only tank in the Island with more than four.\"\n\nWith one exception they are in fair order. M\u00e1ma\u1e0du had three before its restoration, and Ma\u1e0dukanda, Kanakar\u00e1ya\u1e47ku\u1e37am, and Periyaku\u1e37am, also restored tanks, had each one. Examples are to be seen at Pan\u1e0d\u00e1ra\u1e45ku\u1e37am, which has two, and at Mah\u00e1 Rambaiku\u1e37am, Ch\u00e9mama\u1e0du, Matavuvaittaku\u1e37am, Putumurippuku\u1e37am, Kuruntan\u0304ku\u1e37am, Tannirmurippu, Periyaku\u1e37am, and Kachchilama\u1e0du. At Tannirmurippu, unfortunately, most of the stones have been removed to build a Hind\u00fa temple,\u2020 otherwise it is in a good state of preservation.\n\nWith regard to one of the sluices at Iratperiyaku\u1e37am, which is still in use, Mr. Parker remarks:\n\nWe have here a sluice which has continued in working order for 1,770 years or more. It is probably the oldest identified sluice in working order in the Island if this tank is the Alawichcha lake.\u2021\n\n---\n\n* Sessional Papers, 1886, pp. 107\u2013116, 179\u2013187, 437\u2013449, 453\u2013460, 463\u2013469, 473\u2013477.\n\u2020 The doorway of the temple at Vellaiya Mulliv\u00e1ykk\u00e1l near Mullaittvu is made of carved stones from Kurunt\u00farmalai, adjoining Tannirmurippu.\n\u2021 Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 109.\nThe tanks were in many cases provided also with artificial spills or flood escapes, some of which remain. The floors and sides of these spill waters were often covered with large wedged stone pitching, as at P\u00e1vatku\u1e37am, where the spill is 125 ft. long and 60 ft. wide; Pand\u0101raku\u1e37am, where it is 250 ft. long and 21 ft. wide; and Vavu\u1e47ikulam. The spills were usually built as kalingulas, i.e., they were provided with a series of pillars, upon the framework of which a dam was erected for holding up an extra depth of about 2 ft. of water. An example is to be seen at P\u00e1vatku\u1e37am.\n\nThe pillars, which are very irregular in size and shape, are in pairs, a short one in front of a tall one 5 or 6 ft. high, and a few inches distant from it, their line crossing the spill-water slightly in front, i.e., on the tank side of the centre line of the embankment. Between these pillars a temporary dam of sticks and earth would be raised when it was desired to retain extra water at the cessation of the north-east monsoon rains. For this purpose the extra height of the tall pillars would be of no use, and it may possibly have been used as the pier of a temporary foot-bridge, by which travellers could cross the flood that occasionally poured over the spill water.*\n\nThere is another smaller kalingula 300 yards lower down the stream from the spill. Examples of kalingulas are to be seen at Mah\u00e1 Rambaiku\u1e37am,\u2020 M\u0101ma\u1e47u, Erupot\u00e1ne, Matavuvaittakulam, and Pand\u0101raku\u1e37am. At Mah\u00e1kachcha\u1e6dkodi the kalingula has a single pillar only. There was a sort of kalingula at the northern end of the bund of the Vavu\u1e47iya tank before its restoration, but it is not visible.\u2021\n\nWith regard to the date of the construction of these tanks, there is perhaps more certainty as to the abandoned tank of Vavu\u1e47ikulam than any other. Mr. Parker says:\u2014\n\nVavu\u1e47ikulam may be included among the earliest reservoirs in the Island. It is mentioned in the Mah\u00e1vansa.\n\n* Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 110.\n\u2020 Id., p. 183. The pillars at Mah\u00e1 Rambaiku\u1e37am appear, however, to have been in threes and not in twos, which Mr. Parker has not noticed (diary of September 23, 1889).\n\u2021 Id., p. 179.\nAnd he identifies it with the tank Peliwapigama, which is referred to in the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 as situated seven yojanas northward of the capital. A hunter finds some gems \"in the stream flowing through the broken embankment of the tank.\" Mr. Parker remarks:\n\nThe distance of the existing road from Anur\u0101dhapura to a point on the Central road due east of the tank is 56 miles; while according to the Mah\u0101wans\u0101 the distance to the tank was 63 miles, a slight difference, which may fully be accounted for by the more devious route of the early path. The fact that a stream of size flowed through the breach of the tank proves that it was an important one, and there is no other large one at a suitable distance from Anur\u0101dhapura. Lastly, the ancient name of the tank is especially applicable to this reservoir only. Peliwapi is exactly the same as P\u0101likku\u1e37am, from which it seems to be evident that the river, the P\u0101li-\u0101ru, has derived its name. What is thus learnt regarding this reservoir proves that it was abandoned, and the resort of hunters (and therefore more or less overgrown with jungle), so early as 161 B.C., when Du\u1e6d\u1e6dhag\u0101mini ascended the throne. Its state at that period, however, shows that it was breached at some considerably earlier date; and as all that is known regarding the Tamil occupants of Anur\u0101dhapura renders it very unlikely that the work is of Tamil origin, the date of its construction may be assigned with comparative certainty to some period prior to 205 B.C., when Ilara became king.\n\nMr. Parker thinks that it is mentioned also in an inscription that is cut on a rock at Peramiyanku\u1e37am, Anur\u0101dhapura. The inscription dates from the time of Wasabha, 66\u2013110 A.D., and among other things it records the gift of the P\u0101li-n\u0101gar\u0101 tank to the Thera Majjhima. Some ruins that are said to be in the forest to the north-west of the tank may be possibly the remains of this n\u0101gara or city. The jungle in which they occur is termed the K\u014dvilk\u0101\u1e0du, or \"temple jungle.\"\n\nThese ruins have been inspected by Mr. H. Nevill, who describes them thus:\n\n* Sessional Papers, 1886, pp. 468\u2013469. See also Mr. G. M. Fowler's diary of May 14, 1887.\nThere is a ruined temple with a large stone Buddha some 8 ft. high still standing erect, but headless, and buried in tiles, bricks, &c., to his shoulder. Near him is Vishnu, broken off at his waist and still erect; two flagstaff sockets or oil mortars over a small ruined dagaba; a temple or two of no consequence,\u2014mere scraps,\u2014and a larger temple with its posts all upset, and its Saivite lingam (sic) broken. There stands an inscribed stone, and after some search I discovered its missing top, broken off for a Pillaiy\u00e1r.*\n\nAnother tank of Sinhalese construction, which probably dates from pre-Christian times, is P\u00e1vatku\u1e37am, which was the most important reservoir in the Wanni:\n\nThe bricks employed at two of the sluices are of a much older type than those of the Pa\u1e0dawiya sluice, which was built at the end of the third century A.D. Unfortunately there are no inscriptions in the immediate neighbourhood, nor is there any local tradition regarding the originator of the work; this is doubtless due to the occupancy of the place by the Tamils after they seized upon the district. If Sinhalese had always lived at it, the ancient Sinhalese name of the tank might have been preserved. This reservoir is such an important one that it is almost certain to be mentioned in the old historical works, if we only knew what name it bore.\u2020\n\nThe only vestiges of the former inhabitants of the place, besides the tank itself, are the ruins of a small dagaba which once existed on a high rock, included in the line of the bund, a large slab for flower offerings which is now placed on an adjoining rock, and a large stone with a roughly carved figure of a five-headed cobra on it.\n\nThe stone slab is now known as \"The King's Seat,\" and Mr. Parker's surmise as to how it acquired this name is probably correct. He says:\n\nFrom it a good view is obtainable of the tank and part of the watershed, as well as in the opposite direction, and it may perhaps have been placed in its present position by order of some Tamil ruler.\n\nMah\u00e1kachchatkodi in Kilakkum\u00falai South, which is one of\n\n* Diary of June 8, 1889.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, pp. 113\u2013114.\nthe earliest settlements in the Wanni, also probably dates from pre-Christian times. Its Sinhalese name is Tittav\u00e9li.*\n\nThe hill at Kurunta\u1e45kulam or Piyangala is identified by Mr. Parker as the spot visited by Buddha on his second journey to Ceylon, and the tank would therefore date from at least the middle of the third century B.C. The adjoining large tank, Ta\u1e47\u1e47irmur\u016bppu, may have been of later date, or it may have been repaired later.\u2020\n\n\u012aratperiyaku\u1e37am, Mr. Parker thinks, is the \"Alawichcha lake\" named in an inscription at the base of the large rock which towers above the tank and village, in which case \"the lake\" must have been constructed prior to 113 A.D.\u2021\n\nPeriyaku\u1e37am he would assign to the first two centuries A.D., M\u0101ma\u1e0du and Oluma\u1e0du to the second or third century,\u00a7 Kanakar\u0101ya\u1e45kulam to the third or fourth century, and Vavuniya to the fourth or fifth.\u2016 Pand\u0101raku\u1e37am is also of ancient date, but nothing is known regarding its early name and history.\u00b6\n\nThere are two ancient stone dams or weirs on the Kall\u0101ru and another one on the P\u00e9r\u0101ru, which are fully described by Mr. H. Parker.** Of the former, one, which he calls the \"Kuri\u00f1ch\u0101ku\u1e37am\u2020\u2020 tekkam,\" is situated close to where the P\u00favarasa\u1e45kulam-Venkalached\u1e0dikku\u1e37am road crosses the river; the other, which is of superior construction and probably of later date, is some four miles lower down the river. They both appear to be of early date, but Mr. Parker thinks they were built long after the completion of P\u00e1vatku\u1e37am.\n\n* Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 186.\n\u2020 Id., p. 449.\n\u2021 Id., p. 109.\n\u00a7 Ip., pp. 185\u2013439. M\u0101ma\u1e0du is perhaps considerably earlier. It was repaired in the tenth century A.D.\n\u2016 Id., p. 180.\n\u00b6 Id., p. 444.\n** Id., pp. 114\u2013116, 455\u2013456.\n\u2020\u2020 I could not find that the villagers knew it by this name. It is simply known as the Alaikaddu (\"wave-bund\"), as is the other dam lower down the river. (See diary of May 11, 1890.)\nThe third, the Adukku-kallu anicut, is two miles below the Ma\u1e47malai tank, and formed a part of the same scheme.*\n\nThere is another anicut across the P\u0101liy\u0101ru called Chempakam Cheddikallu, 2\u00bd miles from M\u016b\u1e47rumurippu, which is supposed to be artificial.\n\nThe remains of an ancient stone bridge are to be seen in the jungle behind the Olukkulam village near the minor road from Nelukkulam:\n\nIt was 200 or 300 ft. long, and was raised upon piers of substantial stone posts. It crossed the stream which flowed from the southern low level sluice and kalingula. The road which passes over it still goes by the name of the M\u0101vata, \"the high road,\" although the ends of the bridge are hidden in dense jungle. The people say that this was a main road from Anur\u0101dhapura to Jaffna, possibly by way of Upatissanuwara.\u2020\n\nAt the lower dam on the Kall\u0101ru are to be seen what may be the vestiges of another bridge, which would also have been on a high road from Upatissa-nuwara:\n\nIn the up-stream part of the rock on which this lower dam is built, and about 30 ft. distant, there is a row of six socket holes,\u2021 9 in. square in plan and about 10 or 12 ft. apart, running straight across the river, and nearly parallel to the dam. One of the holes is only slightly cut and two others are but little deeper; the depth of the deepest one is 9 in. Two gaps exist where the cutting of other holes has not been begun.\u00a7\n\nThere are remains of ancient irrigation channels: one connecting Madukanda with Maniy\u0101rkulam, a distance of about 2 miles; two at P\u0101vatkulam, which have been traced 3 and 2\u00bd miles respectively; and also at Putumurippukulam, Tannirmurippu, and other tanks.\n\n* It appears to be called also \"The Women's Dam.\" There is no tradition accounting for the name. (Diary of May 16, 1886.)\n\nA natural ledge of rock across the P\u0101liy\u0101ru, 2\u00bd miles from Panank\u0101mam, has been mistaken for an artificial dam. \"The gneiss rock has split in such a manner that in places it looks artificial, but that is often seen.\" (Diary of May 12, 1886.)\n\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 114.\n\n\u2021 Id., p. 116. They may have been intended to hold posts before the anicut was built, against which a temporary dam was raised when the flood subsided.\n\n\u00a7 Id., p. 110.\nIn the Vavuniya District the largest Buddhist establishments were situated in Kilakkum\u00falai South in the neighbourhood of Periyapuliyankulam, Erupot\u00e1na, and Ma\u1e0dukanda. The rocks at Erupot\u00e1na and Periyapuliyankulam have been explored. \"They are full of caves, nearly all of which are partly artificial.\" Mr. Fowler \"found a great many caves and inscriptions which the villagers had never seen before. In some there were remains of brickwork.* A stone enclosure was found, which probably surrounded a b\u00f3-tree.\"\n\nOn another visit more inscriptions were found, and a curious circular building on the summit of the smaller hill. The remains of a flight of steps are to be traced leading from the large caves and b\u00f3-tree enclosure at the foot of the hill up to this building. There are also about forty or fifty stone pillars about 8 ft. high standing round the foot of the larger boulder on which the building is erected. Some appear to be the supports of a verandah or roof in front of the caves, and others are probably the remains of a pilima-g\u00e9, but no statue could be found. The site of the hill was evidently terraced formerly.\u2020\n\nAt Erupot\u00e1na an inscription was found on a rock near the channel through the bund.\n\nThe hill is nearly as rich in inscriptions as the Periyapuliyankulam hills. There is one over a large cave with a broken statue of Buddha, a pedestal of a sedent Buddha, and other carved stones. The cave is peculiar, as it has a kind of well in it, which has been partly excavated in search of treasure.\n\nThe cave was covered with chunam, probably painted formerly. In another cave we found a piece of ancient pottery, apparently a piece of a priest's begging-bowl. On the summit of the rock there was a d\u00e1gaba. The level space on the top of the rock has traces of buildings. There are holes cut in the rock, which probably held the supports of a ladder formerly. There must have been an extraordinary number of priests about this neighbourhood.\u2021\n\n* December 12, 1886. Mr. Parker copied fifteen inscriptions on this occasion.\n\u2020 July 14, 1887.\n\u2021 Diary of December 17, 1886.\nThere are the ruins of two monastic establishments at Ma\u1e0dukanda, one close to the high road to Trincomalee and the other under the bund at the northern end of the tank. The former, which have been cleared of jungle by the people of the village, consist of a bana ma\u1e0duwa with a sedent figure of Buddha and covered pillars, and of the ruins of a pokuna and of a curious chamber or bath. The entrance to the bana ma\u1e0duwa is in a fine state of preservation. It has a flight of steps with a makara tora\u1e47a and guardian goddess on each side of the steps. The image of Buddha is somewhat mutilated.\n\nThis temple is celebrated as one of the places at which the tooth-relic was lodged on its way from India to Anur\u0101dhapura, and the stone slab upon which the enclosing karanduwa was deposited is still shown. A circle cut on the slab is said to mark the position of the karanduwa.*\n\nThe other ruins at Ma\u1e0dukanda may be said to have been discovered in 1890, when the jungle which covered the site was partly cleared away.\u2020\n\nAt Mah\u0101kachchatko\u1e0di there are rocks, caves, and the remains of several monastic edifices. There are the ruins of a poya-g\u00e9; two parallel rows of plain squared pillars, five on one side and three on the other, are still standing. At the end is a flight of steps with one of the dora\u1e6dup\u0101la stones visible. In the middle is a heap of d\u00e9bris. Further in the jungle are a stone altar and door post. The limits of the square enclosure of the temple are marked by lines of cut stones.\n\nIn one of the caves (now utilized as a pa\u1e47sala), which is said to have been the vih\u0101ra-g\u00e9, are two headless stone\n\n---\n\n* The next halting-place in the north-east is said to have been Erupot\u00e1na. \"If the procession travelled an equal distance between each halting-place the next would be not far from Buwanma\u1e0duwa.\" (Diary of October 15, 1888.)\n\n\u2020 See diaries of October 15, 1887, July 9, 1888, and July 23, 1889; also Sessional Papers, 1886. These ruins are described in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch), vol. XII., p. 111.\nimages of Buddha, but both heads are forthcoming. Outside are the bases and feet of these images, and five stones, each having a representation of the *sr\u012bp\u0101da*, or sacred feet of Buddha. One of the *sr\u012bp\u0101da* stones is much larger than the others, and has a bevelled edge. Cut on all the stones between the two feet is a curious ornament, which looks like a vase with a closed lotus flower depending from each side of it.\n\nOn the top of the hill are the ruins of a d\u0101gaba with an octagonal pillar at the top, and also of another *p\u014dya-g\u0113*, similar to the first one, but with fewer pillars standing.*\n\nThe only other Buddhist monastery in Kilakkum\u00falai South which has left any visible signs of its existence is at Iratperiyakulam, on the side of the road about a quarter mile from the bund of the tank, where are the ruins of a *p\u014dya-g\u0113* with a large sedent stone image of Buddha and the usual two rows of pillars with a flight of steps. Mr. Parker would \"hesitate to identify (these ruins) as those belonging to the Tihadiya Vih\u00e1r\u00e9, which was probably on the high rock Iratperiyakulamkanda, where some remains were found when the trigonometrical tower was built.\"\u2020\n\nFragmentary and isolated indications of the former faith of the Wanni are however here and there met with. In the village clearing at Tirupanma\u1e0duwa is to be seen a curious stone, which apparently stood on two pillars and a flat stone now lying near it. It is divided into twenty-five sunken compartments of different sizes, some square and some oblong. It is said to be a *vidharsena* stone, i.e., a stone used by Buddhist priests to assist them in their meditations.\u2021\n\nVavuniya, curiously enough, though it has one of the largest tanks of Sinhalese construction, has nothing to show in the way of ruins. In the village is to be seen a Buddhist altar slab for flowers, now doing duty as a Pillaiy\u00e1r shrine under a large tree. It is said that there was an inscription close to\n\n---\n\n* Diary of August 22 and November, 1889.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, p. 1886, 109.\n\u2021 See Diary of November 10, 1889.\nthe tank on a rock over which the Horowapot\u00e1na road passes, but if it really existed it was completely destroyed when the road was formed.* In 1888 some plain cut stones were used for culverts. A small brass or gilt image of Buddha was dug up in a garden at Vavuniya in 1886, and is now in the Colombo Museum.\u2020\n\nOn the path to Tavasi-veli is a large carved altar stone.\n\nIn Kilakkum\u00fal\u00e1i North there are three ruined monasteries, one at Ch\u00e9mama\u1e0du, which had an important tank, one at M\u00e1likai, and one at P\u00e1laim\u00f3ddai. At Ch\u00e9mama\u1e0du, \u201cbeyond the western end of the bund, at about one-eighth of a mile to the west of the minor road, an ancient monastery existed, at which a d\u00e1gaba and several buildings were constructed. The bricks of the d\u00e1gaba are of two types, one of which dates from the second or third century B.C.; the other belongs to perhaps the tenth century A.D., and indicates the restoration of the structure by some Sinhalese monarch at that period, after it had been rifled during the previous Tamil usurpation.\u201d\u2021\n\nAt M\u00e1likai the small pilima-g\u00e9 of the monastery has been turned into a Pillaiy\u00e1r temple, with the head of the Buddha image serving as Pillaiy\u00e1r. The entrance steps with the usual balustrade on each side are easily detected, though one balustrade is broken and the other buried. This village, it may be noted, has apparently retained its Sinhalese name (M\u00e1likai = m\u00e1lig\u00e1wa).\n\nAt P\u00e1laim\u00f3ddai, near the tank, is a ruined vih\u00e1r\u00e9 and a stone figure of Buddha about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. high seated on a cobra; also a shallow bowl cut in a large stone, and the usual broken stone pillars and scattered bricks. The head of the image has been recently broken off.

It was established behind the southern part of the bund. The remains may be seen in the jungle. \"The pilima-g\u00e9 of the monastery has been converted into a Hind\u016b temple dedicated to \u0100\u1e47\u1e0diya.

A semicircular mound projected into the tank, and evidently a flight of steps led from the top of it down into the tank. Only two of the stones of the side walls were in position. The steps are lying about, some broken, in the bed of the tank. The stones of the side wall are backed with brickwork, the bricks having curious marks (five wavy\n\n* Diary of February 8, 1890.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 439.

It is built in as a step to one of the side verandahs. It was brought from the Hind\u016b temple. (Diary of November 22, 1889.)\nlines) commonly found on ancient bricks in the District. The bricks are of the same size as those in the sluice at Venkalacheddikkulam, and bear the same mark,* so probably that tank and this were constructed about the same date.\u2020\n\nIn Chinnachcheddikkulam, the south-western part of the Wanni, there are ruins to be seen, as may be expected, in the neighbourhood of the ancient tanks of Sinhalese construction at Venkalacheddikkulam and Marutama\u1e0du.\n\nAt Venkalacheddikkulam, in the jungle close to the village clearing, are the remains of a brick d\u00e1gaba; a number of bricks with marks on them; a large rectangular stone hollowed out on one side, which was apparently a bath; a flat stone 5 ft. by 4 in., and one of the balustrades of a flight of steps, of the usual makara tora\u1e47a shape, such as are seen at Tadday\u0101malai, Ma\u1e0dukanda, &c. Probably the other balustrade is buried close by, if not in situ.\u2021\n\nIn the neighbourhood of Marutama\u1e0du is a small d\u00e1gaba which, like nearly all others in the Wanni, has been opened in search of treasure.\n\nClose to the road from Olukkulam to Kapp\u00e1chchi, not far from the main road, is to be seen a ruined d\u00e1gaba.\n\nIn Na\u1e0duchcheddikkulam, between P\u016bvarasankulam and P\u00e1mpaima\u1e0du, is a small pond called Kalma\u1e0du with a ruined d\u00e1gaba, about 20 ft. in diameter, which has apparently been opened in search of treasure. There are one or two broken pillars near the pool.\n\nAt Irasentiran\u0331kulam, in the same pattu, are the ruins of a vih\u00e1r\u00e9 and other remains in the jungle near the tank. A Tamil temple was built here, for which many of the stones have been utilized. Curious old tiles have been found here.\n\n* Bricks or tiles with the same mark have been found at Irasentiran\u0331kulam, Nochohiku\u1e37am, &c.\n\nThe mark is just as if the five fingers had been drawn lengthwise over the clay when it was wet.\n\n\u2020 Diaries of March 28 and June 23, 1887.\n\n\u2021 Diaries of September 23 and May 12, 1890.\nAt Matavuvaittakulam, a fine ancient Sinhalese tank in the same division, is a five-headed cobra now set up in a Hind\u00fa temple on the bund.\n\nMetkumulai, the western division of the Wanni, bears signs of having at one time been thickly populated. There are many abandoned tanks, some of large size, and deserted villages. At Ira\u00f1aiyiluppaikkulam there are some ruins close to the road in front of the village\u2014a pillar, upright, square, on a stone, other stones imbedded in earth, and a quantity of square bricks, with an abandoned and filled-up well.*\n\nThere are said to be ruins at a large abandoned tank northeast of P\u00e1lampuddi, called M\u00e1likai-kaddinair\u00e1vi\u2014pillars and a stone house.\u2020 This, it may be remarked, is another place which has retained the Sinhalese name m\u00e1lig\u00e1wa, and incorporated it in its present Tamil name, and this word shows that a building of some importance once existed here.\n\nAt Vinaiy\u00e1nkulam, one mile south of P\u00e1lampuddi, are to be seen a mutilated Buddha and some pillars,\u2021 and at Chelliayavillu, the extreme limit of the Mullaittivu District, on the Mann\u00e1r side, is a stone with a socket cut in it for a pillar; and bricks are scattered about in the neighbourhood.\u00a7\n\nPa\u00f1ank\u00e1mam, the division north of Metkumulai, was the headquarters of the Wanni in the time of the Wanni chiefs, and perhaps for that reason the traces of the former Sinhalese inhabitants are but slight. The ruins of Vavunikulam have already been referred to. There is no record that any distinctively Buddhist remains have so far been met with in this pattu.\n\nMr. Nevill states that there is a large tank four miles from Pandarakatkulam, and \"this was the residence of the Wanni prince of this district until our time.\" He further states that \"the temple and houses are still standing, but in ruins.\" No one appears to have been to visit them.\u00b6\n\n* June 2, 1884.\n\u2020 May 15, 1886.

This part was about $2\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. in height, and had been broken off short at the bottom. It is square, with the top rounded off in a neck and surmounted by a small cone with a claw-like ornament at each of the four sides.\n\nOn one face there is the Buddhist wheel, and there are inscriptions on at least two sides.\n\nIn M\u00e9lpattu East there are ruins at Ariyama\u1e0du and at K\u00e1nch\u00faramoddai, adjoining villages, while between K\u00falankulam and Ruwanma\u1e0duwa to the south of it on the way to Padawiya tank the jungle contains many ruins\u2014pillars and bricks scattered about. Those at Ariyama\u1e0du are about a quarter of a mile from the village, and consist of pillars and remnants of pillars, and an image of Buddha with head and arms gone.\u2020 Near the tank at K\u00e1nch\u00faramoddai there are a d\u00e1gaba and other remains of a Sinhalese monastery.\u2021\n\nRuwanma\u1e0duwa, on the south-eastern limit of the Vavuniya District, was probably at one time the residence of one of the petty Wanni kings, and the neighbourhood must have been thickly populated. The ruins here consist of a square brick-walled enclosure, containing numerous pillars, stone mortars, and other dressed stones, but all very rough work. The ground is covered with bricks and tiles. The enclosure was, Mr. Fowler thinks, the king's residence. There is a d\u00e1gaba in very good preservation, about thirty or forty feet high, and unopened. There are also the remains of pansal and pilima-geval and a stone-inscribed slab. At the entrance to one of the temples is a flight of steps with two small upright stones and balusters, shaped like elephants' trunks. The work is of a much\n\n* The other half of the pillar is said to be buried in the bund. I tried to get it dug out, but without success.

The upright stones, instead of having guardian goddesses carved on them as at these places, have simply a rough outline cut into the surface. The steps are of brick.\n\nThere was also an ornamental pillar, octagonal in shape, with a figure of a dog with his paw resting on a ball cut on one side and that of a crow on the other, and at the top the Buddhist wheel and other designs. This has since been removed to the Assistant Government Agent's compound at Vavu\u1e47iya, where it now stands.*\n\nTo go on northwards to the Mullaittivu District. The next Buddhist monastery is found close to the ancient Sinhalese tank which is now called Pand\u0101rakulam, in the forest at a short distance to the west of the field. It possibly dates from the second or third century A.D. Its Sinhalese name is unknown. Similar ruins are to be found throughout this neighbourhood, and there is good reason to believe that the main road by which, in pre-Christian times, travellers proceeded from Anur\u00e1dhapura to the east coast of India passed down this valley. There appears to have been a regular chain of monasteries marking the route from Pada-wiya northwards through the Wanni.\u2020\n\nI went to see these ruins in 1889. The rocky hill on which they stand is known as Tiraviya-malai (\"Treasure Hill\"), because, as usual, it is said that treasure is buried there.\n\nIt is a half or three-quarters of a mile on the other side of the minor road to that on which Pand\u0101rakulam lies. The hill is formed out of huge black rocks. Ascending this I came across the ruins of a temple (pilima-g\u00e9) built in four parallel rows of rectangular pillars, nine of which pillars\n\n* Diaries of July 13, 1887, April 19, 1889, and November 5, 1889.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, page 443. The port of embarkation was probably situated 9 or 10 miles south of Mullaittivu on the Chemmalai lagoon. Travellers by this route would pass Ruwanmaduwa, Ariyama\u1e0du, and K\u00e1nch\u00faram\u00f3\u1e0d\u1e0dai, Otiyalalai, Kurunturmala\u00ef, at all of which places there are ruins of Buddhist monasteries. Pand\u0101rakulam, however, would be rather out of the way.\nwere standing, half of them not in the least out of perpendicular. In the midst of the pillars was a recumbent figure of Buddha half buried, and with the head missing.* The figure was about 7 ft. long, both forearms were broken off, but the right one was found, minus the hand.\n\nAbout fifteen yards from this temple, and (as well as I could make out) south-east of it, is a smaller temple, with only three pillars standing, two of which are broken. But I noticed the tops of two dora\u1e6dup\u0101la stones just appearing above the ground, and also the outline of one of the makara tora\u1e47a stones; and on digging I found that the former had figures of guardian goddesses exactly like those at Ma\u1e0dukandu and Kuruntankulam.\n\nThe steps are no doubt intact under the surface. This is evidently the entrance to the small temple. This temple has a fourth and smaller pillar, with rounded edges, lying on the ground.\n\nAnother fifteen yards from this is a third temple, near a large black rock with three sides perpendicular, the fourth shelving over and forming a cave temple, which, when I visited it, bore evidence of recent occupation by bears.\n\nThe pillars of this third temple are of the same height as those of the first, but most of them are larger. They are not square, but rectangular, some being $1\\frac{1}{2}$ ft. by 1 ft. by 9 in.\n\nIn front of the p\u014dya-g\u00e9 there is a stone about 1 ft. square with a lotus cut on the top. On digging in the neighbourhood a second stone of the same pattern was found, but not in the proper position. These two stones apparently flanked an entrance gate or flight of steps;\u2020 near them was a flat stone roughly hollowed out, probably used to wash flowers in before presenting them at the temple.\n\nThere is another large gently-sloping rock forming the summit of the hill, with a flight of stone steps in two stages\n\n* I found the head in the village compound, to which it had been removed by a villager.\n\u2020 These stones are now in the Assistant Government Agent's compound at Vavuniya.\nleading to the top. Near the top there are large flat stones and a plain semicircular moonstone, 4 ft. in diameter. Another stone near the moonstone, of about the same size, has the surface cut as if some steps had fitted into it.*\n\nThere are ruins also in the village\u2014a large flat stone surrounded by upright pillars.\n\nThere are extensive ruins at Mannakandal, between Odduchkuddan and Putukkudiyiruppu, turning off the minor road between the 8th and 9th mileposts, which I went to see in June, 1890. I can find no record of their having been visited or described before, so at the risk of being tedious I give a description of them.\n\nI turned off on the western side of the road between the 8th and 9th mileposts. There is the bund of a large abandoned tank abutting on the road and running at right angles to it. It is covered with jungle, and had never been explored, but there can be no doubt that an important tank existed here.\u2020\n\nThe ruins are situated on some rising ground, which is quite flat at the top, and appear to have been enclosed by a wall; close together there are the ruins of seven temples of the usual type, parallel rows of rectangular pillars, and of different sizes. The largest was built on a platform faced with brick, the outline of which is still remaining. The space enclosed within the pillars is, as in the case of all the others, heaped up with d\u00e9bris, bricks, tiles, and earth, and very likely if this were cleared the usual images of Buddha would be found lying underneath in the pilima-g\u00e9. I determined to see whether I could find the entrance steps to this larger temple. Taking the side facing east (the building was of rectangular shape, with the long sides on the east and west) I noticed the top of a stone appearing above the surface. Getting the earth cleared away I found it was one of the balustrades of the steps, of the usual elephant-trunk shape.\n\n* Diary of September 15, 1890.\n\u2020 It has since been explored. It is now called Puliyankulam. It has a stone sluice, and with the connected tank appears to have formed a large irrigation scheme.\nAt the foot there was another stone just appearing above the surface of the ground, and digging in front of this I found that it had on it the usual figure of a guardian goddess very deeply carved into the stone. The top of the stone, including the head of the figure, was broken off, but I found it close by, though mutilated. I found the other balustrade and stone in their proper position (the latter also broken), and, between the two balustrades, the steps. There are also the ruins of a d\u0101gaba close by.\n\nIn front of another temple there are three stone steps, diminishing in size from the topmost one. This was probably the main entrance to the whole set of buildings. There are many bricks and tiles scattered all about the place. One tile was found indented at one end with the marks of the five fingers pulled along it when it was wet, like those found lately at Irasentirankulam and Nochchiku\u1e37am. Not far from these ruins there is a large square poku\u1e47a, all four sides built up with cabook-like stone. On measurement it was found to be 90 yards square, but originally I think it may have been 100, as the sides have fallen in. Near it was a rectangular stone, 3 ft. by 2 ft., with raised borders, such as are used to place flowers on before an image of Buddha or a b\u00f3-tree.\n\nThe people call these ruins Ka\u1e47\u1e47ya-k\u00f3vil, because there are seven temples, and they say there were seven Wanniyan virgin chieftainesses.*\n\nIn the same division, M\u0113lpattu North, there are rock temples at V\u0101vad\u1e0daimalai, about two miles south of Odd\u016b-chudd\u0101n. On one rock there are several pillars of the usual rough kind marking the site of a temple. A flight of steps from this leads down to a poku\u1e47a at the foot. The other rock, about 100 yards south of this one, has caves, which were evidently temples.\u2020\n\n* Diary of June 26, 1890. These were probably the seven daughters of Nanti, who are referred to in the Kalveddu.\n\u2020 Diary of June 4, 1886.\nAt Kachchilama\u1e0du there are the ruins of a temple under the tank bund\u2014pillars, cut stones of various shapes, stone steps, bricks, and a headless statue of Buddha.\n\nAnother Buddhist establishment existed in the same neighbourhood at Taddayamalai, four or five miles west of Kachchilama\u1e0du:\n\nIn former times there was a monastery near the western end of the Taddayamalai bund. Although many of the best stones and bricks have been removed to the Od\u1e0duchuddan Hind\u00fa temple within the last twelve or thirteen years,* enough remains to indicate the importance of the place. The special feature at it is an interesting piece of dry walling of the Cyclopean style that protected one corner of the brick-walled enclosure of the monastery from the scour caused by the stream that flows through the breach.\u2020\n\nThe ruins consist of four balustrades, a stone slab 12 ft. by 6 ft. and 2 ft. and 2\u00bd ft. thick with carved ends, which is said to have been the roof of the temple; a stone \"boat\" 30 ft. long and 5 ft. deep. Two of the balustrades have a boss carved on them. There are many large boulders lying about, one or more of them masonry built, forming large elevated platforms.\u2021\n\nThis monastery is supposed to be older than that at Kurunt\u00e1rmalai.\n\nThere are stone pillars, bricks, and other remains of ancient buildings at Chivantaimurippu in the jungle west of the Kokkilay lake, between Kokkutodav\u00e1y and Taddayamalai.\n\nAn interesting and very elaborate sr\u012bp\u0101da stone which belonged to this place, but which was removed to Kod\u1e0daik-k\u00e9ni, will be found described in the Proceedings of the Royal Asiatic Society (Ceylon Branch) for 1890. It is now in the Colombo Museum.\n\nAt Otiyamalai, in the south-eastern corner of M\u00e9lpattu North, there is a rock on the bund of the tank with the remains of another monastery on it, a recumbent image of Buddha of crystallized limestone or quartz, under an\n\n* This was done in 1882. \u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, page 454. \u2021 See diary of Mr. Moir, 1862.\noverhanging ledge of rock which was formerly enclosed by a brick wall in front. Mr. Fowler states that there is an exactly similar cave temple not far from Galkandama\u1e0duwa, the southernmost limit of the Vavuniya District, and that the image is of the same stone, and, like this one, has lost the head and right arm.*\n\nBut the most extensive ruins in the whole Province are those at Kurunt\u00farmalai, or Piyangala, at the south end of the embankment of the Kurunt\u00farku\u1e37am tank in Karikkad\u1e0dum\u00falai South. Mr. Parker thinks that\u2014\n\nThis is the spot that is said to have been visited by Buddha on his second journey to Ceylon.\u2020\n\nA flight of stone steps led from the end of the bund to the summit of the hill. The top of the hill is flat, and of elliptical or oval shape. Round the side facing the bund, and possibly round all the summit, a retaining wall of squared blocks of the hard altered gneiss has been built to a height of 7 ft. or 8 ft. at a batter of \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) to 1.\n\nThere are several ruins on the hill, and at the back of the northern part of the bund; but they are all dilapidated, more through wilful defacement by the later Tamil occupants than by the action of time.\n\nAbout half way between the southern end of the bund and the southernmost bund is the site of an ancient temple, with a stone image of a five-headed cobra.\u2021\n\nBehind the bund there are the ruins of at least three temples or buildings of importance, such as at Ma\u1e0dukanda, Mah\u00e1kachcha\u1e6dkodi, Iratperiyaku\u1e37am, &c., having three parallel rows of squared stone pillars; in one case there had been at least three of these rows. At one place there were standing two doratup\u00e1la stones covered with carved figures of guardian goddesses, exactly like those at Ma\u1e0dukanda, but they were more than half buried, and the space between them, where there is evidently a flight of steps, is completely buried, with a tree growing in the middle.\u00a7\n\n* Diary of June 17, 1886. See also Mr. Haughton\u2019s diary of June 12, 1883.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, page 449.\n\u2021 Diary of June 12, 1888.\n\u00a7 Stones were removed from Kurunt\u00farmalai in 1858 to build the Mullivaikkal temple, I believe.\nOne of the two *makara torana* stones which form the balustrade of the steps as at Ma\u1e0dukanda is lying on the surface turned over on its side, and the other is probably lying buried somewhere near. On digging here the top step was seen, and the whole are probably *in situ*. There is also a large inscribed slab. In another place is a roughly-executed figure of a bull, the head broken off but forthcoming, and a figure representing a worshipper. These figures evidently belonged to the Hind\u00fa temple which was built after the Tamil invasion.\n\nThere is also a large heap of bricks, apparently the remains of a d\u00e1gaba, and there are pillars on all sides.*\n\nThe town or large village that was built on the low side of the embankments, and traces of which are to be seen in the fragments of pottery that line the beds of the smaller water-courses, is termed *Kurungama* in the inscription. The Tamil name was Kuruntan-\u016br. The later Tamil residents built a temple here, and they demolished the vih\u00e1r\u00e9 built by Sanghabodi and other buildings, and removed nearly all the bricks and the stonework to it. It is not known when the tank was breached and the town was abandoned; all that can be said is that there is nothing to indicate that the place has been inhabited since the thirteenth or fourteenth century.\u2020\n\nThere are several of these high rocks with cave temples in the District. The highest is Kumpakannanmalai, to the south of Kuruntu\u1e41malai, due north of Padawiya and about two miles from K\u00e1\u1e0d\u1e0dutadd\u00e1malai.\n\nThis rock was\u2014\n\nEvidently utilized as a cave temple. The sockets and pillars are visible, but no inscriptions. There are pillars standing on the slope of the hill, and there is a built *poku\u1e47a* at the foot. The natives are afraid to shoot at this pool, as they believe it to be haunted. There is a cave under the rock which is a perfect sanctuary for bears, as they cannot be ejected from it. It has three openings on different sides of the rock. The height of the rock is about 300 ft.\n\nThis rock was visited by Mr. Pole in 1847, who noticed\u2014\n\nInteresting remains of an old temple\u2014bricks with devices and Tamil letters, cut stone doors, &c., and found in the old stone path-\n\n---\n\n* Diaries of June 8, 1883, August 5, 1887, and September 13, 1889.\n\u2020 Sessional Papers, 1886, p. 449.\nnearly at the top four old copper coins in a very perfect state of preservation, with characters so distinct that if the language be now in existence some notion may be formed of the date of the remains of the ancient works.\n\nHe adds\u2014\n\nI should strongly recommend them [archaeologists] to go to Kompanammalai before it is too late. When the [proposed] road is opened these remains will no longer be protected, as they appear to have been for ages by its position in the depths of the jungle.*\n\nAt Savarattuveli, in Karikkaddumulai South, Mr. Nevill saw a ruined temple with a pond near it, and \"the basement of a palace or temple close to the houses at Kadutaddamalai\" in the same division\u2014pillars, slabs, stones, and bricks scattered here and there.\u2020\n\nA hill formed of bricks and stones at Virattucholai, also in Karikaddumulai South, marks the site of another temple.\n\nIn Karikkaddumulai North there are ruins and a broken statue at Putankulam near Tanniyuttu, and an ancient tank at Kanukkeni, badly breached.\n\nThe Kumarapuram temple, a comparatively modern structure, though now in ruins, need not be described here, as it has received as much attention as it deserves already in this Journal.\u2021 The Putukkudiviruppu division has a similar ruin called Kuravil-kovil, about eight miles from the village of Putukkudiviruppu. It consists merely of a heap of bricks with a circular stone on top of it.\n\nIn the extreme north of Karunavallpattu, at Putumurippukulam\u2014\n\nThe remains of a Buddhist monastery are to be seen in the tract below the tank. Judging by the dimensions of the bricks used in the dagaba the settlement seems to have been of early date. So far as I am aware this monastery is the most northern ruin to which a Sinhalese origin can be attributed.

(302\u201330 A.D.)\" near the Maniyar-ku\u1e37am tank.\u2021\n\nIratperiyaku\u1e37am.\u2014Inscription by King Gaja B\u00e1hu I. on the bund, recording a gift of food to the priesthood at the Tihaday\u0101 Vih\u0101r\u00e9, on the shore of the Alawichcha lake.

The upper part is illegible from having been used as a curry-stone. (December 16, 1886,)\ninscription was cut by orders of either Kassapa VI. or D\u00e1pulu V., and on the only face that is sufficiently whole to be translated it is commanded as usual that the cows and cart buffaloes are not to be taken away.* On the other side is a design like a lamp or vase. Mr. Fowler thinks the stone probably came from Taddayamalai.\u2020\n\n*Kuruntankulam.\u2014Inscription by Mahindu III. (937\u20131013 A.D.), who visited the tank with his mother (?) and daughter in the eighth year of his reign. It is on a large slab, and is one of the largest inscriptions in the Island, but for the most part now illegible, containing\u2014\n\nChiefly a series of rules like those on the Mihintal\u00e9 tablets, to be observed by the monks who were stationed here, but few references of more general interest are included in it, and allusion is made to the king\u2019s great lake (which would appear to be Tannirmurippu), and also to some disputes that were having an injurious effect on the cultivation. The king, who states that he himself was the writer of the inscription upon the stone, and who appears to have had some doubts regarding his orthographical powers, commands that these rules \u201cshall continue in force, and not be upset or reconstructed if letters are missing.\u201d\u2021\n\nThe town that existed on this site is termed Kurungama in the inscription.\n\nThis slab is now in three pieces. The letters on it are very fairly and evenly cut, each one separated by horizontal lines cut as straight as if they had been done with a ruler, and there is a raised border round the stone.\u00a7\n\nAt Ruwanmaduwa Mr. Fowler found a large inscribed slab, 7 ft. in width, with a roughly-cut inscription, in characters differing considerably from the rock inscriptions.\u2016 A pillar removed from here to Vavuniya has inscriptions apparently on two sides.\n\n* Page 439.\n\u2020 See reference under note \u00b6, p. 174, ante.\n\u2021 Page 449.\n\u00a7 September 13, 1889.\n\u2016 July 13, 1887. Mr. Fowler copied only five lines of it, as it was half buried, but a copy was made of the whole of it in November, 1890, for the Government Agent. (November 10, 1890.)\nAn inscribed stone has recently been excavated at Periya-kulam during the restoration of the tank. The inscription remains to be copied and translated.\n\nThis closes for the present the list of Buddhist arch\u00e6ological remains in the Wanni, for I do not think that any others have so far been discovered.\n\nSome two hundred copper plaques were found in a garden in Mullaittivu town a few years ago, specimens of which are in the Museum, but such finds have been few in the Wanni.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nMr. H. Parker has, I find, published translations of four of the inscriptions at Periya Puliyankulam and of one at Erupot\u00e1na. I take over his notes as they appear in the \"Ceylon Literary Register\"**:\n\nThey are cut at \"caves\" in some little-known rocky hills at Periya Puliyankulam, eight miles to the north-east of Vavuniya-Vilankulam. The majority of the inscriptions at this place are of the usual cave type, and are of uncertain age; but the following are of more general interest, as being, in some cases, contemporary with those of the great Indian king A\u015boka, and of historical importance.\n\nThe chief one is repeated at three caves. All three inscriptions\u2014of which two were copied by Mr. G. M. Fowler, c.c.s., and one by me\u2014are imperfect, owing to the decay of the rock; but on comparing them the full text is obtained, with the exception of part of the last word. The text is as follows, the capitals being mine:\n\nRaja Naga jita raja Uti jaya Abi Anurudi ca raja Utica karapita setama le\u00f1a cata disa sagaya agata-nagata Pasa wihara apare ma [wita].\n\n\"The most excellent cave caused to be made by the daughter of King N\u00e1ga and Abh\u00ed Anurudhi, wife of King Uttiya, and King Uttiya, for\n\n* Vol. II., p. 408, \"Some Early Inscriptions in Ceylon.\"\nthe Assembly of the four quarters, present and absent. Constructed to the west of the P\u00e1c\u00edna Wih\u00e1ra.\u201d\n\nAnother inscription at a lower cave is:\n\nGapati tapasa Sumana Kulasa len\u0113 sagasa dine agata anagata catu disa sagasa Pasu wisaraye.\n\n\u201cThe cave of the family of the ascetic Sumana, the householder, is given to the Community, to the Community of the four quarters, present and absent, at the P\u00e1c\u00edna tank.\u201d\n\nThere is thus no doubt regarding the name of the place. According to the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nsa, the P\u00e1c\u00edna Wih\u00e1ra was constructed by King Dew\u00e1n\u00e1mpiya Tissa; its ruins have not been identified. The two kings, N\u00e1ga and Uttiya, are of course the two brothers of that monarch, the former one being the Mah\u00e1-n\u00e1ga, who reigned at M\u00e1gama in the Southern Province. The first inscription undoubtedly dates from the second half of the third century B.C.\n\nAnother inscription, for which subsequent searches were fruitless, was discovered at the same place by Mr. S. Haughton, c.c.s., a few years ago. Unfortunately the copy is too imperfect for a full translation to be made, but it contains special reference to the Uga hapati patama Sumana, \u201cThe teacher, the supreme Sumana,\u201d who is most probably the celebrated Sumana who accompanied Mahinda to Ceylon.\n\nAnother inscription runs:\u2014Parumaka Utiputa Cudanagasa len\u0113, \u201cThe cave of Cudan\u00e1ga, son of the Parumaka Uttiya.\u201d This appears not unlikely to belong to a son of King Uttiya, but he is not mentioned in the Mah\u00e1v\u00e1nsa.\n\nAnother, copied by Mr. G. M. Fowler at Erupot\u00e1na, is:\u2014Parumaka Ma...wa puta Abayasa len\u0113 sagayaniya [te], \u201cThe cave of Abhaya, son of the Parumaka Ma (h\u00e1si) wa, established for the Community.\u201d If the restoration of the two letters in the unfortunate blank space may be trusted, this may possibly belong to the eldest son of King Mutasiwa, but there is no proof that such is the case.\n\nI give one more inscription from the same place as the three first ones. It is found along the side of a flight of rock-cut steps up a steep ascent at the end of the largest hill, and it is the earliest instance of what is known in Ceylon as \u201cPerelibasa.\u201d* It is impossible to exhibit the freaks of the carver in a bare transliteration. Some of the letters are reversed vertically, some laterally; while two syllables have the consonants transposed, and a few letters are correctly cut. Its transliteration has been unusually difficult, because many of the early\n\n---\n\n* Irregularly cut inscriptions have been also noticed in the North-Central Province and the K\u00e9galla District of the Province of Sabara-gamuwa.\u2014B., Hon.

It is: \n*Mekanuspakusa witipagapinuwadameda.* Correcting the letters, transposing the consonants in *Sawi*, and then reading it backwards, it runs: *Dam\u00e9dawanupi gapati Siwa Kulasanikame,* \u201cThe work of the family of the devout householder Siwa, beloved of the gods.\u201d\n\n6.

Swettenham moved \"That a vote of thanks be passed to Mr. J. F. W. Gore for compiling an Index to the Journals and Proceedings of the Society, and that he be elected an Honorary Life Member, under Rules 7 and 9.\" He said that the Society was placed under a deep debt of obligation to Mr. Gore for having compiled the Index referred to,\u2014the result of great personal trouble and patience, and a work of great utility to those interested in Asiatic research. He thought the least the Society could do in return was to express its sense of thankfulness by making him an Honorary Member of the Society for life, which he had much pleasure in moving.\n\nMr. J. Ferguson, in seconding the above resolution, bore testimony to the high character of Mr. Gore's work. He said that from his experience in the publication of statistical information he felt qualified to fully appreciate the usefulness of the Index which had been laid on the table, and a specimen copy of which he held in his hand. Dr. Johnson said, that knowledge was of two kinds: we either know a subject ourselves or we know where to get information about it. Mr. Gore had made it easy to all using his Index to get at the stores of learning and useful compilation in the Society's volumes.\n\nMr. Arunachalam inquired whether it was competent for the Society, in view of Rule 1, which defined its objects, to pass the motion. Undoubtedly Mr. Gore had rendered valuable service to the Society, but the point upon which he wished the ruling of the Chair depended entirely on the interpretation of the Rule referred to.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Swettenham, in reply, pointed out that the motion was strictly within Rule 1. Mr. Gore had rendered distinguished services to the Society of the kind contemplated in Rules 7 and 9, and they were calculated to promote the objects enumerated under Rule 1.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor had no hesitation in ruling that the motion was in order, and had much pleasure in putting it before the Meeting. The motion was carried with acclamation, and Mr. Gore was elected an Honorary Life Member.\n\n3. The following Paper was read by the Author:\u2014\nTHE MUSIC OF CEYLON.\n\nBy Mr. C. M. Fernando, B.A., LL.B.Cantab., Advocate.\n\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\nNearly forty years ago Mr. Louis Nell wrote a Paper, which was read before this Society, by way of an introduction to an investigation of Sinhalese music. This I believe to be the only attempt that has yet been made to inquire into the music of Ceylon.* My endeavour is in this and subsequent Papers to do what I can to elucidate a subject which is yet an unexplored region to those interested in Ceylon and its people. It is my purpose to commence with observations on the music of the Mechanics, or the Ceylon Portuguese, to be followed by Papers dealing with the vocal music now in vogue among the Sinhalese: their sacred music, the description and use of Sinhalese musical instruments, and the cultivation of music as a fine art among the ancient Sinhalese.\n\nI.\u2014The Music of the Mechanics of Ceylon.\n\nThis Paper consists of a collection of the national tunes of the Mechanics of Ceylon reduced into European notation, prefaced by a few discursive remarks on their ethnology and habits and customs, such as would be of interest to the student of their national music, of which tradition has hitherto been the only vehicle.\n\nThe Mechanics form a distinct portion of the inhabitants of Ceylon, connected by ties of kindred, speaking a common language, and possessing habits and customs as distinct as\n\n* Except a short Paper written by me and published in the Royal College Magazine for July, 1883.\nany other nationality in the Island. The name Mechanic, generally applied to them as a class, is derived from the fact that they are almost exclusively devoted to the lower crafts of artisanship. They are usually shoemakers, tailors, or blacksmiths, and their conservatism is such that few, if hardly any, are known to have grown out of their ancestral callings.\n\nTheir race, as at present constituted, is an admixture of several nationalities, having for its nucleus the offspring of the Portuguese settlers of maritime Ceylon. These Portuguese were wont to take to themselves native wives, and upon the Dutch occupation left behind them a considerable number of descendants. These latter, on account of their faith, to which they rigidly adhered in spite of the persecutions of their conquerors, were debarred from holding office or occupying positions of trust or honour under the Dutch regime, and were consequently obliged to seek refuge in the mechanical arts. Compelled by the circumstances of their callings to move among the lower classes of the native population, they frequently contracted marriages among the latter, and absorbed into their language a host of Sinhalese and Tamil words.\n\nIt is also more than probable that the Portuguese descendants freely associated with the soldiers of the Caffir regiments employed by the Dutch, from whom much of the national music of the Ceylon Mechanic seems to have originated. Of this there is ample evidence. I need only refer to the word \"Cafferina,\" and to the tune No. 4 in the collection, viz., \"Velinda Mazambicu,\" which clearly has reference to the Island of Mozambique. Bertolacci, writing in 1817, calls it \"a very remarkable fact that of about 9,000 Caffirs at different times imported into Ceylon by the Dutch Government, no descendants are remaining\u2014at least they are in no way to be distinguished among the present inhabitants.\"* These Caffirs were doubtless absorbed among the\n\n* Bertolacci's Ceylon, 1817, p. 45.\nMechanics of Ceylon. Their language, as now spoken, is as different from Portuguese as English is from Anglo-Saxon. \"There is still a large body of inhabitants at Colombo and the other settlements in Ceylon known by the name of Portuguese. A corruption of their original language is still spoken all over the sea coasts. It is very easily learned, and proves of very great utility to a traveller who has not time to study the more difficult dialects of the natives.\"*\n\nThere can be no doubt that the present enfeebled and apathetic condition of this race is largely the result of the religious persecution it suffered at the hands of the Dutch for over a century and a half. In the face of numerous plakaats forbidding the harbouring of priests, the solemnization of Catholic marriages, attendance at religious service, and the open observation of the practices of their faith, the Portuguese descendants stood steadfastly by their ancient creed.\n\nA colony of Portuguese, unable to endure the severities of the Dutch Government, fled to the village of Vahak\u00f3tt\u00e9, hidden among the mountains of the M\u00e1tal\u00e9 District, where their descendants exist as a community at the present day, professing the Roman Catholic faith, and still preserving, in spite of their surroundings, a few at least of the quaint customs of their forefathers. Writing on this subject Tennant observes:\n\nSo effectually does this course of persecution and oppression appear to have crushed the spirit and benumbed the ambition of those subjected to its influences, that even at the present day, under a liberal government, and after a lapse of nearly a century and a half, it is rarely that a Portuguese Burgher aspires to rise above the position to which his forefathers had been reduced by the penal laws of the Dutch.\u2020\n\nThe music of the Mechanics constitutes a distinct form of national music, and is not characterized by any close resemblance to the national songs of Portugal. It seems to have germinated and grown amongst themselves in their adopted\n\n* Corderer's Ceylon, 1807, vol. I., p. 89.\n\u2020 Tennant's Christianity in Ceylon, 1850, p. 72.\nhome, in the same way that the Christy Minstrel songs originated among the Negroes of America; and just as the latter express in themselves the characteristics of the American Negro, his broad, if somewhat coarse, humour; his simple, almost childish, pathos, and his intense love of family life\u2014so the \"Cafferina\" and the \"Chikothi\" of the Mechanic display the peculiarities of the Mechanic character, improvidence, at times amounting to recklessness, and the pursuit of pleasure at all costs.\n\nThe words \"Cafferina\" (its name denotes its Caffir origin) and \"Chikothi\" are often synonymously used. But the difference is marked between these two species of tunes. The \"Chikothi\" is always slow and stately, while the \"Cafferina\" is faster and more boisterous, and is always in $\\frac{6}{8}$ time, with a peculiar jerky movement, the last note in the bar being generally a crotchet.\n\nThe words of the \"Cafferina\" and \"Chikothi\" are frequently improvized as they are sung, although there are stock words to every air. The art of improvization is cultivated by the Mechanic even more assiduously than by the Nigger minstrel who haunts the regatta at Henley. In the later stages of an evening party, when the fumes of beverages stronger than ginger-beer have dispelled the respect for the ordinary amenities of mechanic life, this art of improvization becomes sometimes a source of offence, and leads to dire results.\n\nI give the words of two of the best known \"Cafferinas,\" with a literal translation of them by way of specimen. In the first, a Mechanic youth is supposed to be addressing the mother of his Sinhalese lady-love. It is entitled \"Cingalee Nona\" (Tune No. 1):\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Cingalee Nona! Cingalee Nona!} \\\\\n\\text{Eu kere kasa,} \\\\\n\\text{Porta ninkere, orta ninkere,} \\\\\n\\text{Figa namas da.} \\\\\n\\text{Figa namas da, none,} \\\\\n\\text{Figa namas da.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nSinhalese lady! Sinhalese lady!\nI wish to marry,\nYour house I want not, your lands I want not,\nOnly your daughter give.\nOnly your daughter give, lady,\nOnly your daughter give.\n\nThe following (Tune No. 7) is supposed to be sung by a spinster with a view to matrimony:\n\nAnala d'oru,\nSetti peder juntu.\nQuen kere anala,\nKasa minha juntu.\n\nI've a ring all of gold,\nWith seven jewels set:\nWant you that ring?\u2014\nThen wed me and get.\n\nThe \"Chikothi\" and \"Cafferina\" are not merely efforts at vocalization. They provide the occasion for dancing, which the Mechanic dearly loves. The dance is performed in couples, each consisting of a lady and a gentleman. Standing apart on opposite sides of the room they dance towards each other, following the music in rhythmic steps, and exchange old-fashioned courtesies when they meet in the middle of the room. Grotesque attitudes and alert movements are indulged in while dancing to the lively tunes of the \"Cafferina.\" The slow measures of the \"Chikothi\" only call for stately and dignified steps. These dances are got up on very little provocation. A christening, a birthday, an anniversary of any kind, is sufficient excuse; and often on a moonlight night families unite to enjoy themselves at open-air picnics, known in Ceylon as Appa Surei Partei, to regale themselves on hot-baked hoppers and fresh-drawn toddy, and to foot it merrily to the soft notes of the viaule and the banderinha.\n\nA curious feature in the religious services of the Mechanics is that their prayers are not merely read or recited, but are actually chanted\u2014a custom in which they have been copied\nby their Sinhalese and Tamil co-religionists. I have included in this collection the two best-known chants, the *Pater Noster* and the *Ave Maria*. The latter is extremely tuneful and devotional. Having gradually lost their own priests on account of the prohibition by the Dutch Government of the education of Roman Catholics for the ministry, the Portuguese settlers of Ceylon were for a long time ministered to by priests surreptitiously brought over from Goa. It is therefore probable that many of the Portuguese chants now in use were derived from the Goanese, who themselves are of Indo-Portuguese origin, and among whom there has sprung up a distinct form of chant, known as the Goanese chant.\n\nThe lullabies in use among Ceylonese mothers and ayahs are of Portuguese origin. The word \"doiya\" (traceable to the Latin *dormio* and Portuguese *dormir*) is used to mean sleep when addressing infants. I have included in the collection two of the commonest lullabies. They have lulled to sleep many a Ceylon baby.\n\nThe instruments in use among the Mechanics are the violin, the *viaule* or tenor violin, the mandoline (which they call the *banderinha*), the guitar, and a small kind of tom-tom known as the *rab\u00e1na*. The mandoline and the guitar are fast becoming obsolete. The Mechanics are clever executants in respect of their own music, but when they attempt European dance music they are less happy, and succeed only in travestyng the original compositions.\n\nWith the gradual dissemination of Western ideas and habits of life, with the spread of English education, and with the contempt which it unhappily engenders in certain minds for the institutions of this country, there are many who fear that the Mechanic of the future will resemble only in name his ancestor of the present day. But it is to be hoped that the innate conservatism of the Ceylon Portuguese, which has preserved them as a separate community through the troubles and hardships of the Dutch period, and which is still so characteristic of them, will help, not only to maintain,\nbut to further develop their national music, of which, unlike some elements in their racial character, they have no need to be ashamed.\n\nNote.\u2014The Author, after the reading of his Paper, introduced to the notice of the Meeting an orchestra of Ceylon Portuguese whom he had got together for the occasion. They consisted of two violins, two guitars, a tambourine, triangle, and a banderinha. Mr. Fernando said he regretted that the viaule, an instrument of the guitar shape, consisting of thirteen strings, was not represented; the only person able to play this instrument just now is old and decrepit, and was unable to be present. There was a specimen of the instrument in the Colombo Museum, which unfortunately could not be got in time to be exhibited. To enforce his contention that he was dealing with music of a European character, and that it was amenable to European notation, he would himself accompany the orchestra on the piano. The orchestra under Mr. Fernando's direction played the following:\n\n1. Cingalee Nona (Tune No. 1 in the collection, and perhaps the most popular of Mechanic airs).\n2. Tres pe (Tune No. 12), which means three feet, so called from the marked character of the triple time in which the tune runs.\n3. Anala d'Oru (Tune No. 10), exhibiting an instance of the use of the interval technically known as the dominant seventh.\n4. Velinda Mazambiqu (Tune No. 4). Undoubtedly of Caffir origin, judging from the name and style of the air.\n5. Coran Janita (Tune No. 14). One of the oldest of their tunes.\n6. Caffri (Tune No. 9). A Cafferina with a very fast movement.\n\nAt the conclusion of the music His Excellency the Governor said:\u2014\"Sorry as we are at the termination of Mr. Fernando's interesting Paper, and the very pleasant music and the admirable accompaniment of Mr. Fernando on the piano, we must pass on to the next business.\"\n\n4. The Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my read the following Paper:\u2014\nA HALF-HOUR WITH TWO ANCIENT TAMIL POETS.\n\nBy the Hon. P. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my.\n\nThe Paper which I propose to read to-night consists of a translation, somewhat free and short, of two poems: one by Kapilar and the other by Mudattamakkan\u00f1iy\u00e1r, both of which form part of the collection known as Pattup\u00e1ttu, or the Ten Poems.\n\nKurinjipp\u00e1ttu, by some said to be known also as Perunkurinji, was composed, according to the famous commentator Naccin\u00e1rkkiniy\u00e1r, in order to complete the Tamil education of a certain \u00c1rya prince by name Pirakattan,* who, judging from the poem, was perhaps the ruler of a mountainous district. The poem consists of 260 lines, and makes mention of many different trees, shrubs, and flowers, such as seldom occur in other Tamil poems. In this translation I have omitted them, as those who seek information on the subject can easily consult the original. The author of this poem was Kapilar, the brother of Tirivalluvar, whose Kural is well known. Kapilar's age must be fixed prior to the second half of the second century of the Christian era. At page 149, vol. XIII., 1894, of this Society's Journal, my statement that Kapilar and Para\u00f1ar were contemporaries, and that Para\u00f1ar received presents from the Chera king Senkuttuvan, whom Gaja B\u00e1hu I. of Ceylon visited, will be found. This visit took place between 113 and 135 of the year of Christ, as that was the period of the reign of the latter monarch, according to the list of kings given in p. iv. of Wijesinha Mudaliy\u00e1r's edition of the Mah\u00e1wansa.\n\n* I give this name as it is spelt in Tamil, as I am not certain what the Sanskrit equivalent is: query Praha\u015bta.\nPorunar\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6dupp\u0101\u1e0dai, the second of the poems which I have translated, consists of 248 lines, and is sung in praise of the great Ch\u00f3la king known to history as Karik\u00e1la. It purports to describe the experiences of a musician who was the recipient of that king\u2019s liberality. Many matters of interest with regard to the food, mode of life, manners and customs, poets and musicians of the Tamils of ancient times appear in this poem. Karik\u00e1la\u2019s age, for the following reasons, was not later than the first century of the Christian era.\n\n(1) The celebrated Tamil poem Kalingattupparan\u0304i was written by its author in praise of his patron, king Ko-r\u00e1ja-Kesari-varman,* alias Kulottunga Chola Deva I., of the Ch\u00e1lukya dynasty, who reigned from 1063* to 1112 after Christ. The date of this poem has been correctly fixed as not long after 1081,* which date is also accepted by other Tamil scholars. In this poem Karik\u00e1la is mentioned as an ancestor of Kulottunga Chola Deva I., as having gone to Northern India on a tour of conquest, and as having accepted the poem Pattinapp\u00e1lai (which also forms part of the collection Pattup\u00e1\u1e6d\u1e6du, already referred to), and paid the author of that poem one million six hundred thousand pieces of the gold coin called pon. Many of these and other particulars regarding Karik\u00e1la are mentioned in other Tamil works, such as the Periyapur\u00e1nam,\u2020 Chilappadik\u00e1ram, &c. So that according to the Kalingattupparan\u0304i, Karik\u00e1la\u2019s age was much anterior to 1063, when his so-called descendant Kulottunga Chola Deva I. began his reign.\n\n(2) In volume II., part II., page 153, of the South Indian Inscriptions, Dr. Hultzsch says: \u201cIn the two only copper-plate grants which contain a genealogical account of the Ch\u00f3la dynasty the same three kings\u201d\u2014viz., Karik\u00e1la,\n\n* Cf. Indian Antiquary, vol. XIX., pp. 329 et seq.; vol. XX., pp. 278 et seq. South Indian Inscriptions, vol. II., part I., p. 230; Mr. P.

Mr. Sundarampillai\u2019s Paper on \u201cThe Age of Tirujn\u00e1na Sambandha.\u201d\nKo-chengannan, and Ko-killi\u2014\"are mentioned as ancestors of Vijay\u00e1laya, the grandfather of Par\u00e1ntaka.\" Vijay\u00e1laya reigned about the year 875.* We therefore are enabled to take a further step and say that Karik\u00e1la's reign was long prior to 875 anno Christi.\n\n(3) The Chilappadik\u00e1ram, a Tamil poem of the second century\u2020 (and it matters little for purposes of this inquiry whether it is of the second century or later by a few hundred years), which records many notable events of the first and second centuries, makes mention of this great prince in different places. It was from him that M\u00e1dhavi, the dancing girl, on completion of her studies, after due exhibition of her ability, received the customary first prize granted to experts in music and dance. And this event happened\u2014if the time ranging over the period covered by the several events chronicled in this poem be properly computed\u2014many years prior to the visit of Gaja B\u00e1hu I. to India.\u00a7 The ancient commentator of Chilappadik\u00e1ram, \u00c1diy\u00e1rkkunall\u00e1r, and the still more ancient commentary known as the Arumpadavurai, state that Karik\u00e1la was reigning over the Ch\u00f3la country at the beginning of Kovalan and Kannakai's career, and that this prince's daughter, Natcon\u00e1i, was the wife of Seral\u00e1tan and mother of Senku\u1e6dtuvan, friend of Gaja B\u00e1hu I. I would call particular attention to the following among other passages in the Chilappadik\u00e1ram which refer to Karik\u00e1la, his daughter's husband Seral\u00e1tan, and her son Senku\u1e6dtuvan:\n\n(1) \n\n---\n\n* Cf. South Indian Inscriptions, vol. I., p. 112. By studying the list given in this page, and computing backwards from the reign of R\u00e1ja-r\u00e1ja (S\u00e1ka 919 to 930 = 997 to 1008 of the Christian era), it will be found that Vijay\u00e1laya's reign will be about the year I have mentioned above.\n\n\u2020 Cf. my Paper Chilappadik\u00e1ram, Journal No. 44, vol. XIII., 1893, of this Society; also Mr. W. P. Ranasiqha's Paper, \"Which Gaja B\u00e1hu visited India?\" read in September, 1894; and the notes of discussion on that Paper.\n\n\u00a7 The visit was between 113 and 135 of the Christian era.\nParanar, who addressed the fifth pattu of the Padittuppattu* to the Chera king Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, and, as I have said before, received presents from him, calls him the son of Seralatan by the daughter of Chola:\n\nAnd in the Manimekhalai, a poem written by Kulav\u0101\u1e47ikar Sittalai Sattan\u0101r, a contemporary of Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, Karik\u0101la is spoken of as already dead:\n\nThe third step in this inquiry then shows that Karik\u0101la was the maternal grandfather of Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, who, I had almost forgotten to say, is said to have occupied his throne fifty years before Gaja B\u00e1hu visited him.\n\nIt is thus shown on the authority of Kalingattupparan\u012b that Karik\u0101la was the alleged ancestor of Kulottunga Chola Deva, whose reign began in 1063. It is further shown, on the authority of Dr. Hultzsch, that he was an ancestor of Vijay\u0101laya, who reigned circa 875. And lastly, on the authority of the poems, poets, and commentators above cited, that he was the maternal grandfather of Senku\u1e6d\u1e6duvan, contemporary of that Gaja B\u00e1hu who reigned in Ceylon from 113\u2013135.\n\nIt may therefore be safely concluded that Karik\u0101la, one of the greatest of the Ch\u00f3la kings, lived prior to the second century of the Christian era, and that the poem Porunar\u0101\u1e6dtuppa\u1e0dai, addressed to him by Mudatt\u0101makkanniy\u0101r, belongs to the same period.\u2020\n\n*A manuscript copy of which I have the pleasure of possessing.\n\u2020From internal evidence, such as the language, structure, &c., of the poem, it can also be shown that it is very ancient.\nThese two poems which I have now translated are a fair sample of the short poems which were in vogue nearly two thousand years ago in Tamil-land, and display great powers of observation, and are well worth careful study by students of Tamil literature. My translation can give no adequate idea of the rhythm and the terseness and felicity of expression of the originals; for, after all, the best prose translation (which mine does not pretend to be) of a poem can only \"tell the story without the song.\"\n\nI.\u2014KURINJIPP\u00c1T\u0304TU.\n\nMayest thou prosper, mother! Pray, hear me with patience.\n\nMy lady, whose brilliant brow, soft hair, and lustrous body were pre-eminent among women, is over-borne by a grief that no medicine can cure,\u2014so painful that I have till now kept its cause from you.\n\nSeeing her beauty fade, and her limbs waste; seeing too that others have noticed her bracelets slipping off her wrists, and that the desire for solitude is daily growing upon her, then tossed in mind, not knowing the cause, thou didst seek the help of soothsayers.\n\nLearning from them that her condition was due to the malignant devas,* prayers with incense and flowers didst thou offer, and yet her health hath improved not, and thou art still in sorrow, much perplexed.\n\nJewels made of gold and set with pearls and rubies, lost or tarnished, may yet be replaced, but when appropriate action, loftiness of purpose, and the desire to act in conformity with the prescribed modes of social life fail, the wise declare that even the Devarishis\u2020 have no power to prevent the consequences.\n\nTransgressing the rare restraints placed by her father\u2014possessor of stately chariots\u2014forgetful of the duty to parents and elders, which teacheth us to wait until they choose for us husbands, she hath chosen for herself a lord. If I inform thee, my mother, that this form of marriage, called g\u00e1n-dharvam, is sanctioned of old as consistent with chastity and modesty, shall I deserve blame? Certainly not. Praise, I think, will be my due.\n\nThy daughter, unable to bear the distress of a concealed love, timid-eyed, bereft of energy, and in bitter anguish, is thus resolved:\n\n* Devas, spirits. \u2020 Devarishi, a saint of the celestial class.\nEver shall I remain faithful to my lord. Such shall be my constant duty. Even if the gods grant not that in this life I become his wedded wife, we shall surely, when death ends my sorrows, come together in the next.\n\nThus she remaineth weeping and wailing, helpless. Through fear of thee and concern for her, I too am overwhelmed with grief, even as the wise who seek to restore peace between two great but passion-borne monarchs.\n\nThe usual form of marriage solemnized after the moral qualities of both spouses have been previously ascertained and weighed, begetteth unto them unbroken happiness, and unto their kith and kin friendship and help; but the g\u0101ndharva mode, though rare of occurrence and determined upon in secret, unknown to parents and without previous consultation with any one, is also sanctioned for the salvation of the soul. Such a marriage having already taken place, I have resolved to inform thee. Hear my story and be not angry.\n\nOne day thou didst say unto us, \"Like unto the elephant's trunk raised to despoil the tall bamboos of their seed, the millet-stalks in our fields, their gray heads bent with the weight of heavy ears, are swarming with parrots, eager for the corn. Go ye and drive them away, and return when the day has ended.\" Thither we went, and, scrambling up the pretty ladder made of canes brought from hill-sides, seated ourselves on the platform built by forest rangers on a tall tree, and took up talal* and ta\u1e6d\u1e6dai\u2020 and kulir\u2021 in our hands, and drove the birds, and remained there until the noonday sun blazed fiercely hot.\n\nThe heavy clouds having drunk the waters of the sea so as even to diminish its quantity, with distant thunders resembling the roll of drums gently beaten, causing birds to seek their roosts, overspread the sky. Lightnings flashed like unto the spear wielded by the war-god\u00a7 against the asuras. The winds rose and drove the clouds widely, until, trembling and confused, they sent the rains down in torrents on the hills. From the mountains waterfalls came bounding down in foam like unto white lawn,\u2016\n\n---\n\n* Talal is described by Naccin\u0101rkkiniy\u0101r as \"\u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03ac \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u1f78 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c3\u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03cd\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03ba\u03cc\u03c3\u03bc\u1ff3.\"\n\n\u2020 Ta\u1e6d\u1e6dai he says is \"\u03bc\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1f7a\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd.\"\n\n\u2021 Kulir: \"\u039f\u1f31 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9.\"\n\n\u00a7 Muruga or Skanda, the Hind\u016b god of war.

We sported therein a long while, singing such songs as pleased us. Then wringing the water from our plaited locks, which rolled down our golden backs like glistening sapphires, we, with flushed eyes, dried ourselves and culled k\u00e1ndal,* anicc\u00e1m, and other fragrant flowers. We heaped them on a rain-washed stone, broad and lying alongside the stream, and weaving garlands wound them round our locks and waists and rested under the cool shade of an asoka\u2020 tree, bearing fire-like flowers and tender sprouts. Now and again by word and song we frightened the green parrots away from the corn fields.\n\nThen appeared before us a mountain chief. His dark blue locks, well anointed and made fragrant with the smoke of the akil,\u2021 were interwoven with many coloured flowers from hill and meadow, tree and fountain. From one ear hung down to his shoulders the purple leaves of the asoka; sweet-smelling garlands of flowers mingling with brilliant jewellery, heirlooms in his family, adorned his broad chest painted with candana;\u00a7 his strong arms, braceleted, held a many-hued bow and select arrows. His loins were tightly girt with cloth, and at every step the martial tinkle of his virakkalal\u2016 resounded. His fierce hounds, excited by sport, resembling young warriors after a successful battle with a mighty host, ran towards us yelping and baying.\n\nStartled, we essayed to leave our resting-place, but he broke a leafy bough from a tree and drove the baying hounds this way and that. He approached us with the gait of a proud bull walking up to his newly-found mate when he had vanquished his rivals in a hard-fought fight. He spoke to us some pleasing words: \"Lovely-eyed maidens,\" said he, \"the game I followed is lost; did it come your way?\" Though pleased, we returned him no answer. \"If you saw not the game, ladies, will it be an offence to speak to me?\" said he, and waited for a reply.\n\nIn the meanwhile, drunk with the well fermented fragrant wine handed to them by gazelle-eyed wives living in huts thatched with straw, the watchers became neglectful of the corn-fields until the alarm was raised that the corn stalks were trodden down by an elephant. Fired with anger, quickly stringing their bows, they struck the elephant with\n\n* Here mention is made of various kinds of flowers, &c., which I omit.\n\u2020 Asoka: *Jonesia asoka*, Roxb.\n\u2021 Akil (Sans. aguru), the fragrant 'aloe wood and tree (*Aquiluria agallocha*).\n\u00a7 Candana, here a paste made from the *Santalum album*.\n\u2016 Virakkalal, a warrior's ankle rings.\nswift arrows and drove him away. Trumpeting forth like peals of thunder in times of rain, rooting up forest trees and striking the ground with his strong rough trunk, the fierce animal came rushing towards us even as the god* of death. Knowing no other place of safety, filled with fear and forgetting the restraints of our sex, we ran with trembling limbs to him, the chief. Forthwith he shot his feathered arrows and pierced the beautiful brow of the elephant. Blood overspread the animal's forehead in streams such as flow from goats sacrificed in the presence of women possessed of the god of war. The elephant turned and ran, and we, who had stood together, hand locked in hand like flowers pressed together in a thickly-woven garland of kadambas,\u2020 sank to the ground unable to stand.\n\nSeeing our pitiful state, thus did the chief address thy daughter: \"Noble lady, beauteous-haired, fear not; I will not leave thee.\" He lifted her up, and gently stroking her faultless forehead with his hand looked at me and smiled, desiring the favour of my help. Shame and modesty awakening in her mind, much did she strive to slip from his embrace, but he folded her yet stronger in his arms and prevented her. He,\u2014thelord of fruitful country studded with mountains, capturer of maidens' hearts by his victories over enemies; he, whose city-gates ever stand open to all who seek food enriched with ghee,\u2014awakened at last to the fact that she could be his only by the usual formal marriage. Then he called on the war-god, who dwelleth on lofty mountains, to witness that he would soon claim her for his wife. Thus assured we spent that day until sunset in mountain caves, the delight of devas;\u2014our union being due to the wild elephant roaming in the forest full of flowers.\n\nThe many-rayed sun in his chariot drawn by seven steeds reached Attagiru,\u2021 when herds of deer assemble under trees; when cows, issuing from forests, call their calves and overspread the meadows; when the bent-beaked andril,\u00a7 nestling in the inner folds of the palmirah leaf, summons his mate with notes like those of the horn; when the snake spits out his gem in order to illumine his path while searching for food; when shepherds from different quarters sound their sweet flutes; when \u00e1mbal|| flowers open their petals; when Br\u00e1hmans perform their twilight ceremonies; when in\n\n---\n\n* Yama, the Hind\u00fa god of death.\n\u2020 Kadamba (Nuclea cadamba), a tree with orange-coloured fragrant blossoms.\n\u2021 Attagiri (Sans.

Then did the chief give his pledge: \"I shall marry thee, who art decked with brilliant jewels, when thy relations apprise thy people and place thy right hand in mine. For a while yet shall I spend some days here in order to experience the great joy of conversing with thee in private. Be not alarmed.\" These and other gracious words he said to her, and accompanying us to the stream skirting our town, where the drums never cease to sound, he left us.\n\nSince then has he, with the same love as he had at first, come every night. Often disturbed by the town-guards' approach, or the angry dog's bark, or your wakefulness, or the bright moon's rise, he would depart without meeting her; and even if we, imagining causes of fear when there were none, remained indoors and kept not the tryst, he would depart, never blaming us.\n\nHe is not one who has passed the time of youth; nor has vast wealth, which ever hath the tendency to breed evil habits, changed the good qualities due to his birth; he knoweth too that it is not fitting to meet a maiden at untimely hours, and yearneth to ask her hand in marriage in order that their united lives may be spent in the performance of the duties prescribed for the married. But thy daughter, thinking in the meantime of the perils of mountain paths, of bears and tigers hiding in caves, wild oxen and elephants crossing his way; thinking of thunderbolts overhead, demons and snakes roaming the forests, alligators swarming in streams, and robbers and boa constrictors; thinking of all these dangers nightly encountered by him on his way to meet her, is ever in dire distress, her eyes streaming with tears, and alas, she resembleth a tender blossom crushed by rainstorms fearful and heavy.\n\nII.\u2014PORUNAR\u00c1TTUPPADAI.\n\nOh, minstrel, ever careful to avoid the stale food served the day after the festival, and only present when the festival is still at its height!\n\nWhen thy wife,\u2014graceful as the peacock, gifted with learning, her hair soft as moss, her beautiful brow resembling the crescent moon, her lips red like the ilavam's\u2020 young leaves,\n\n* Paran, a raised platform for watching fields.\n\u2020 Ilavam, the silk cotton tree.\nand eyes gentle and dark under brows arched like the death-dealing bow, her voice sweet as music, and ears shaped like the loop of the scissors* used in trimming the hair, neck slightly curved with modesty, her fingers like the k\u00e1ndal\u2020 growing on the summits of lofty mountains, and her small feet resembling in certain respects tongues\u2021 of hounds tired after a long run;\u2014when thy wife played on the yal, which,\u2014with its two sides low and the middle raised like the impression left by the deer\u2019s hoof on wet ground, is usually covered with flame-hued skin and is possessed of pegs fashioned after the crab\u2019s eye, its strings rung by slender fingers tipped with nails white as the husked tina\u00ed,\u00a7\u2014when thy wife touched the yal, lovely as a bride, with her fingers now fondly resting on, now smoothly gliding over, and now rapidly striking its strings, and sweetly sang the Devap\u00e1ni,\u2016 then didst thou, with humble mind, offer prayers to the forest-gods that thy journey might be safe and successful. May thy life be long and prosperous, chief of all minstrels!\n\nEven as the sight of the meeting in peace and amity of the three great kings, lords of victorious armies, Ch\u00e9ra, Ch\u00f3la, and P\u00e1ndiya, is pleasant unto the world, so does thy song ever delight men\u2019s minds.\n\nPerchance thou art puzzled and knowest not which of these two paths thou mayest take; let thy choice be the right one.

I drew near to him, and even before I could strike the Udukkai,* the skin of which by long beating is marked like the cobra\u2019s hood, and begin my song, he addressed me as one long known to him, and treated me with loving kindness, such that I thought begging was no disgrace. He caused me to be seated before him, and looked at me, his eyes beaming with affection and pleasure.\n\nMy garments, vile with dirt and sweat, bearing patches and stitches, and where nits and lice held sway, he caused to be removed, and clad me in silk soft as flowers. Handmaids, who by music, dance, and converse please him, poured out in golden cups intoxicating wine,\u2020 and I drank to my heart\u2019s content, until my sorrows and the fatigue caused by a long journey were forgotten. When I laid me down to rest, the trembling and unsteadiness of the limbs, I being heavy with wine, were all that inconvenienced me. At dawn, when awake, the bright change in my appearance was indeed so surprising. \u201cAm I in a dream?\u201d I exclaimed, but I soon satisfied myself that it was reality.\n\nHearing my pupils and followers singing his praises, he sent for us and desired us to draw near, and, when we saluted him in the mode usual on such occasions, he made us eat of the flesh of goat and other meat spitted and roasted, and drink plentifully of wine, until we could neither eat nor drink any more. Then sweetmeats of various forms and\n\n---\n\n* Udukkai, a small kind of drum held in one hand and struck by the other.\n\n\u2020 In a poem by Natk\u00edrar of the same time as the above, addressed to a P\u00e1ndiya, the prince is said to drink from golden cups of wine brought by the Yavanar, which may refer to Grecian or Italian wines.\n\nO Pandiya of the Victorious Sword! daily delighting in fragrant wine brought by Yavana\u015b in bottles and poured into golden cups by handmaids, mayst thou be (to your enemies) fierce as the sun and (to your subjects) gentle as the waxing moon. [Kalam here may mean bottles or ships.]\n\nThis term Yavana is very old; according to Monier Williams it occurs even in Manu X., 44; and in Un\u00e1di\u015b II., 74, meaning \u201cforeigners,\u201d &c.\nkinds were set before us, and after making us sit and eat again, he caused Viraliyars* to sing and dance to us. Several days having thus passed, \"You must now eat of rice\" he said, and a great feast of rice and curries and divers dishes cooked in milk were spread before us, and we ate until we were full unto the throat. Thus did we pass our days drinking and eating meat, when, like the ploughshare which hath often furrowed hard soil, our teeth became blunt, and food and wine were no more welcome.\n\nThen one day said I gently, \"O king, who hath no more enemies to conquer, give me leave to go back to my village.\" Looking at me reproachfully, \"Art thou then departing from us so soon? Receive these,\" he said, and gave me elephants male and female and their calves shambling in gait, and chariots numerous, and garments and jewellery in abundance. With these I departed, bidding farewell to poverty for ever. Askest thou, \"Who then was thus generous?\"\n\nSon of Ilanchetchenni, the Ch\u00f3la of the ever victorious spear and war chariots innumerable; he, the great king, resembling Muruga, the angry god of war, was born entitled to kingship even from his mother's womb; wrester of countries from those princes who refused to acknowledge his sovereignty. As the sun rising from the ocean becomes brighter and more splendid when he advances to noon, so from his youth, ever increasing in power and fame, he, now mighty as Yama, god of death, bears on his shoulders the weight of a matchless empire. He is the great king on whose head the garland of atti\u2020 flowers is ever beauteous; he it was that in one battle in the now famous field of Vennil\u2021 dealt defeat to the Chera and P\u00e1ndiyan kings.\n\nIf nearing the merciful presence of the great Karik\u00e1tchola,\u00a7 thou dost worship his feet, his gentle eyes will drive poverty before thee for ever, and thou wilt be even like unto the calf which reeketh with satisfaction after full drink of her mother's abundant and sweet milk. He will clothe thee with silk and give thee to drink of wine in cups of gold. He will place on thy head golden lotus flowers, and to thy wife he will present gold and pearl necklaces and ornaments galore, and feast you all the days of your stay. When it is thy desire to depart, he will give thee a chariot inlaid with ivory, drawn by four milk-white steeds, many\n\n---\n\n* Viraliyar, women who sing and dance.\n\u2020 Atti (Ficus racemos).\n\u2021 Vennil, a famous battle, where Karik\u00e1tchola defeated the Chera king S\u00e9r\u00e1l\u00e1tan, is referred to by many contemporary poets.\n\u00a7 The reason why this great king received this name\u2014meaning black or burnt-foot Ch\u00f3la\u2014is explained in the stanza. See the last page of this Paper.\nelephants, and villages well-watered and fertile. He will even go seven paces with thee, and, unwillingly parting, graciously say, \"Give unto others of what thou hast now received, for riches and life last not long, and fame imperishable shall be thine, and men shall ever honour thee. Fare thee well.\"\n\nSuch the king, who hath long reigned over the Ch\u00f3la kingdom, rich in paddy and groves of green cocoa palms, part of this broad earth on whose shores the black ocean breaks its waves with ceaseless roar;* such he who, even when young, dispensed justice\u2020 to the satisfaction of the old; whose sceptre keeps all straight in the blameless path of duty, whose long reign full of love and mercy is renowned throughout the world.\n\nThe foot that was raised to step on the three worlds stopped short after measuring only this earth, for the foot of the lord of well-watered countries was, alas, burnt by fire.\n\n5. Mr. John Ferguson said it would be interesting to know whether the admixture of the native races with the Ceylon Portuguese had introduced a native element into their music.\n\nMr. Fernando replied in the negative, and observed that the music was essentially European in character, and had developed among the Portuguese descendants of Ceylon in the same way that what is known as Christy Minstrels originated among the Negroes of America.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my said that from his knowledge of Indian music he was in a position to corroborate Mr. Fernando's view.\n\nDr. Pinto supported this view, and remarked that some of these tunes were to be heard at Bombay at the present day, and bore a strong affinity to music which he himself had heard at Lisbon.\n\n* Here follows a description of the country, &c., which I omit.\n\n\u2020 This is an allusion to an occasion when, being quite young, he administered justice to the satisfaction of two aged litigants, who, when they came to him, seeing his youthful appearance, doubted whether they would have justice. The poem is referred to in stanza 2.\n\nNote the reference to heredity in this stanza.\nMr. Barber referred the origin of Portuguese music to Spain, and said that Spanish music was itself borrowed from the Moors.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor expressed his conviction in support of the above remarks, and said that during his long residence at Madeira he had heard similar music, which he had no doubt, while being European in origin, had acquired a tinge from the Arab and the Moor. Referring to Mr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my's Paper he wished to know what European wines could possibly have been imported to India 2,000 years ago.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my thought that most probably the wines referred to were brought over with the Embassies from Italy.\n\nMr. Ferguson remarked that it was quite possible that wine was in those days brought over from Syria and Persia to India.\n\n6. Mr. P. Freudenberg, in proposing a vote of thanks to the writers of the Papers, said that upon hearing the music of the orchestra he felt himself transported to the Bay of Naples, where he had heard similar tunes. The work of the Society had until quite recently been confined to Europeans, and it was gratifying that two native gentlemen had contributed such interesting information as given that night. In a few happy remarks he showed that human nature was very much the same today as it was 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe Hon. Mr. Panabokke, in seconding the above resolution, contended that the Sinhalese had a distinctive music of their own, and referred to several Sinhalese works.\n\nHis Excellency the Governor, putting the vote to the Meeting, asked to be allowed to include in it the Portuguese band. The vote was carried with acclamation.\n\n7. The Hon. Mr. Swettenham asked the Meeting to record a vote of thanks to His Excellency for presiding that evening at what was one of the most interesting and largest attended Meetings held for a long time.\n\nMr. Coom\u00e1rasw\u00e1my seconded the vote, which was carried with acclamation, and the Meeting terminated at about 11 p.m.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-03", "created":
