Assistant Surgeon, 4th Regt. Punjab Cavalry. In charge of the Geological Survey of the Salt Range in the Punjab. Season 1851-52.\n\n(Communicated by the Govt. of India.)\n\nPRELIMINARY REMARKS.\n\nIn compliance with the instructions received at Maree on the Indus, on the 14th February 1851, from the Most Noble the Governor General, I have endeavoured to make such an examination of the Salt Range as will enable His Lordship in Council to judge as to the exact character of its mineral wealth.\n\nThe results of this examination have been embodied in the accompanying Report.\n\nFrom unavoidable circumstances I was unable to commence the regular survey of the Range, until the end of February 1851, and owing to the heat was obliged to cease work in the middle of April.\n\nOn the 1st November 1851, the survey was again renewed, and the sanction of Government having been obtained for the construction of a Sketch map of the Salt Range (the want of which to guide us in our survey has been severely felt), Mr. William Purdon (1st Assistant), aided by Mr. William Theobald (2nd Assistant), was directed to devote his attention to its construction. The map here-with submitted is the result of their labours during the cold weather of 1851-52, to the end of which period the duration of the survey was limited.\nThe map is I believe the first which has ever been made of the Salt Range from a regular survey, and for its accuracy Mr. Purdon is alone responsible. I trust it will supply a want in all maps of the Punjab hitherto published, in none of which, that I have seen, is even the general direction of the Range correctly laid down.\n\nThe geological examination of the Range has been executed entirely by myself, and in addition to that of the Salt Range proper, a rapid survey was made of its continuation in the range of hills which runs down the west bank of the Indus from Kalibag to Kaffin Kote. I thus have been able to add considerably to our previous knowledge of the geology of the Punjab. A most interesting mass of hills called Kovana, which rise abruptly from the plain of the Jetch Doab, has also been examined.\n\nDuring the course of my labours I executed a rough military survey, with a hand prismatic compass, of the district passed over, from which I constructed for my own guidance a rough sketch map. This I have had copied and coloured geologically, by a Mr. Blaney, an Eurasian draftsman, and herewith submit it as illustrative of my report.\n\nThe report itself will be found in many parts to be a repetition of the reports on the Salt Range I made to Government in 1848. These were drawn up after a very rapid inspection of the Range between Baghanwalla and Kalibag, in the month of April, a period of the year, when it is next to impossible to examine satisfactorily such hot and barren hills.\n\nIn the present report I have corrected several errors, the result of a too cursory examination of the strata, and have added very considerably to the matter of my previous reports.\n\nI regret that I am unable to announce the occurrence in the Salt Range of much mineral wealth, of the existence of which Government have not already been made aware.\n\nThe nature of the formations precludes the likelihood of any valuable metallic ores (we except those of iron) being found. The nature and character of the Coal deposits have been fully described; but, for reasons stated, we fear they will turn out of but little practical value.\n\nIn a scientific point of view, however, I would fain hope that much has been recorded which to Geologists will prove highly interesting.\nAs I was ordered to resume my medical duties at the close of my field work, it was necessary that the sections which accompany the report should be prepared before I separated from my assistants, who were directed to remain at Pind Dadun Khan.\n\nThese were hurriedly drawn in camp by Mr. Theobald from rough sketches made by myself in the field, and must be considered rather as sketches than true sections, which without the necessary data at the time as to heights and distances, it was impossible to have constructed.\n\nThe table of heights calculated from barometric and thermometric observations will, I trust, prove interesting as well as useful. I need hardly remark that they can only be considered as rough approximations.\n\nA complete collection, for submission to Government, of the rocks, minerals, and fossils collected during my survey has been prepared, and, in compliance with Government orders, collections, illustrative of the mineral wealth of the Salt Range, have also been made for the museums of the Asiatic Societies of Bengal and Bombay and of the Agra College.\n\nThe preparation of my report and the examination and arrangement of my specimens have occupied entirely my leisure hours during the past hot season. I am aware that numerous imperfections are to be found in it, but in judging of its merits or demerits, I trust it may be borne in mind, that I have been in a position where books of reference or collections for comparison are quite inaccessible, and have consequently been entirely dependent on my own resources.\n\n(Signed) A. Fleming, M.D.\n\nJhelum, Punjab, Sept. 12th, 1852.\n\nOn the General Physical features of the Salt Range in the Punjab.\n\nThe hills, generally included under the designation of the Punjab Salt Range, occur in the northern part of the Sinde Saugor Doab, or distinct between the rivers Jhelum and Indus, crossing it from E. to W. between the parallels of $32^\\circ 22'$ and $33^\\circ N$.

The important comparative list of Caucasian and Mongolian vocables has received considerable additions.\n\nOn the Indo-Chinese Borderers and their connexion with the Himalayans and Tibetans.\u2014By B. H. Hodgson, Esq.\n\nTo the Secretary Asiatic Society.\n\nSir,\u2014In further prosecution of my purpose of recording in the pages of our Journal a complete set of comparative vocabularies on an uniform plan, I have now the honour to transmit to you two fresh series, one for Arrakan, and the other for the Tenasserim provinces. The first comprises six tongues, viz., the Burmese, the Khyeng, the Kami, the K\u00fami, the Mr\u00fa and the S\u00e1k; the second, five, viz., the Burmese, the Talien, the T\u00fang-lh\u00fa, the Sh\u00e1n and the Siamese.\n\nIt is needless, I presume, to apologise for thus recording provincial dialects of well known languages such as the Burmese and Siamese,\nbecause such deviations of a known kind afford inestimable means of testing those which are unknown, and of thus approximating to a just appreciation of the interminable varieties of speech, that characterise the enormously extended family of the Mongolidae.\n\nI am indebted for these vocabularies to Captain Phayre whose name is a warrant for their authenticity, and who has kindly added to their value by the subjoined explanatory note upon the Arrakan tribes. On those of the Tenasserim provinces the only elucidatory addition is the important one that the Tung-lh\u00fa are \"Hillmen,\" that is, dislocated aborigines driven to the wilds, or, in other words, broken and dispersed tribes, like the Khyong and Kami and K\u00fami and Mr\u00fa and S\u00e9k of Arrakan, whose vocables constitute the greatest part of the first half of the vocabularies herewith forwarded.\n\nIn the course of recording in our Journal these numerous vocabularies, I have purposely avoided any remarks on the affinities they suggest or demonstrate, intending to take up that subject when they should be completed; but the high interest* excited by my Himalayan series, in connexion with the bold and skilful researches which are now demonstrating the unparalleled diffusion over the earth of that branch of the human family to which the Himalayans belong, has induced me on the present occasion to deviate partially from that rule and to at once compare Captain Phayre's Arrakanese vocables with my own Himalayan\u2020 and Tibetan ones. Having been so fortunate as lately to procure an ample Sifanese series, comprising the tongues of the several peoples bordering on China and Tibet between Kokon\u00far and Y\u00fcn\u00e1n, and having moreover made some progress in a careful analysis of a normal and of an abnormal sample of the Himalayan tongues, with a view to determining the amounts of the Turanian and Arian elements, I shall ere long find occasion to recur to the general affinities of the Indian Mongolidae. In the meanwhile the subjoined comparison of several Arrakanese tongues with those of Tibet and of the Eastern Himalaya will be read with surprise and pleasure by many who, accustomed to regard the Himalayans as Hindus, and the Indo-Chinese, like the Chinese, as distinct from the\n\n* Latham's History of Man and Ethnology of British Colonies.\n\u2020 My own Himalayan series will be found in the Journal, No. 185 for Dec. 1847.

It should be added that the resemblances cited are drawn not from \"ransacked dictionaries\" but from vocabularies of less than 300 words for each tongue.\n\nTo those who, not content with this abstract, shall refer to the original documents, I may offer two remarks suggested by their study to myself. 1st, The extraordinary extent to which the presently contemplated affinities holds good, has been made out by the helps afforded by the series of cognate tongues, whereby the synonyma defective in one tongue are obtained from another, whilst the varying degrees and shades of deviation are a clue to the root or basis.\u2020 2nd, The other remark suggested by the comparison of the vocabularies is, that it is the nouns and verbs, and not the pronouns and numerals, which constitute the enduring part of these languages; and that consequently, whatever may be the case in regard to the Arian group of tongues, we must not always expect to find the best evidence of family connexion in regard to the Turanian languages among the pronouns and numerals. Indeed the confused character of these parts of speech seems to be a conspicuous feature of the Mongolian tongues.\n\n* In order to appreciate this remark and to trace the elements of the vocables, see analytic observations of the following paper on Caucasian and Mongolian words, appended to the list of those words.\n\n\u2020 Take the radical word for dog, as a sample. We have khyi, khi\u00e1, kh\u00ed, k\u00ed, khw\u00e9, kw\u00e9, kw\u00ed, k\u00fa, ki-ch\u00e1, k\u00fa-ch\u00fa, kh\u00f3, ky\u00f3, cho-l. For the appended particles and their mutations I must refer to the original documents, and to the future confirmations to be supplied by my Sifanese series of words.\nComparison of Tibetan and Himalayan tongues on one hand, and of the Indo-Chinese on the other.\n\nBlood.\u2014Thak in Bhotia, Thyak in Lh\u00f3pa, Vi in Lepcha.*\n    Thw\u00e9 in Burmese, Th\u00e9 in S\u00e9k, Ka-th\u00ed in Khyeng, A-ti in Kami, Wi in Mr\u00e1.\n\nBoat.\u2014Th\u00fa in S\u00e9rsa.\n    Th\u00e9 in Burmese.\n\nCat.\u2014Si-mi in Bhotia, Si-mi in Sokpa.\n    Min in Khyeng, Min in Kami.\n\nCrow.\u2014O\u2019-la in Lh\u00f3pa, A-w\u00e1 in Limbu.\n    O\u2019-\u00e1 in K\u00e1mi, W\u00e1 \u00e1 in Kami and in Mr\u00e1.\n\nDay.\u2014Nyi-ma in Bhotia, Nh\u00ed in New\u00e1ri, Nyim in Lh\u00f3pa.\n    N\u00e9 in Burmese, Ni in Mr\u00e1.\n\nDog.\u2014Khiy in Bhotia, Khi in Lh\u00f3pa, K\u00fa-ch\u00fa in Kir\u00e1nti, Ki-cha in New\u00e1ri, Khia in Dhimali.\n    Khw\u00e9 in Burmese, Ta-kwi in Mr\u00e1, K\u00fa in S\u00e9k.\n\nEar.\u2014N\u00e1 in Bhotia, Na-vo in Lh\u00f3pa.\n    N\u00e1 in Burmese, Ka-n\u00e1 in S\u00e9k.\n\nEye.\u2014Mig in Bhotia, A-mik in Lepcha, M\u00f3 in M\u00farm\u00ed and G\u00far\u00e1ng.\n    My\u00e9-tai in Burmese, A-mi in K\u00e1mi and S\u00e9k, Min in Mr\u00e1.\n\nFather.\u2014Ph\u00e1 in Bhotia, Amba in Limb\u00fa.\n    Ph\u00e1 \u00e9 in Burmese, Ampa in K\u00fami.\n\nFire.\u2014M\u00e9 or Mi in Bhotia, and in all Himalayan tongues.\n    M\u00ed, M\u00e1, M\u00e1 i in Burmese, K\u00e1mi and Mr\u00e1.\n\nFish.\u2014Ny\u00e1 in Bhotia, Ngy\u00e1 in Lh\u00f3pa, Ng\u00f3 in Lepcha, Nyau in S\u00fanw\u00e1r.\n    Ng\u00e1 in Burmese, Ng\u00fa in Khyeng, Ngh\u00f3 in Kami.\n\nFoot.\u2014K\u00e1ng in Bhotia, K\u00e1ng in Lh\u00f3pa, Khwe-li in S\u00fanw\u00e1r.\n    Khy\u00e9 in Burmese, K\u00e1-k\u00f3 in Khyeng, Khou in K\u00e1mi.\n\nGoat.\u2014R\u00e1 in Bhotia.\n    Ta-r\u00e1 in Mr\u00e1.\n\nHair.\u2014A-ch\u00f3m in Lepcha, Ch\u00fam in Magar.\n    A-sh\u00e1m in Kami, Sh\u00e1m in Mr\u00e1 and K\u00e1mi.\n\nHead.\u2014G\u00f3 in Bhotia.\n    Gh\u00f3ng in Burmese.\n\n* The first line gives the northern series, the second the southern.\nHog.\u2014Phak in Bhotia and Lh\u00f3pa and Kir\u00e1nti, Wak in Magar.\nTa-pak in Mr\u00fa and Vak in S\u00e1k.\n\nHorn.\u2014Ar-kyok in S\u00e9rsa, A-r\u00f3ng in Lepcha.\nA kyi in Khyeng, A-r\u00e1ng in S\u00e1k.\n\nHorse.\u2014T\u00e1 in Bhotia and Lh\u00f3pa, Sa la in New\u00e1ri.\nT\u00e1-ph\u00e1 (ph\u00fa male suffix) in K\u00e1mi, Sap\u00fa in S\u00e1k (p\u00fa idem).\n\nHouse.\u2014Khyim in Bhotia and Lepcha.

Phayre's for the southern tongues, hereto appended.\n\nIt is seldom that vocabularies so trustworthy can be had, and had in series, for comparison; and yet it is abundantly demonstrable that every thing in regard to the discovery of the larger ethnic affinities of dispersed races depends upon such a presentation of these materials, the distinction of roots and of servile particles, as well as the range of synonymous variation, in each of these classes of words, being thus only testable, and these points being all important as diagnostics, even more so than grammatical peculiarities which, at least in our sense, are apt to be excessively vague, or else palpably borrowed, among the Mongolids. Syntactic poverty and crudity and etymological refinement and abundance seem to be the characteristics of this vast group of tongues, and hence the importance of its vocables and the necessity of obtaining them in a state accurate enough for analysis, and copious enough to embrace the average range of synonymes.\n\nA common stock of primitive roots and of serviles, similarly employed, indicates unmistakeably a common lineage and origin among the several races to which such stock belongs: preference for this or that synonyme among the radicals, as well as various degrees and modes in the employment of serviles, whether prefixed, infix\u00e8d or postfixed, indicates as unmistakeably the several branches from the same family stem with the relative ages and distances of their segregation. By the above comparison of vocabularies I purpose to illustrate the common lineage of tribes now and for ages most widely dispersed, and of which the intimate relationship is ordinarily overlooked: by a subsequent and more detailed examination somewhat differently conducted, I will endeavour to illustrate the true character of the minor distinctions of race, showing that these distinctions are by no means inconsistent with the common lineage and family relationship now exhibited.\n| English | Khyeng or Shou | Kami |\n|---------|----------------|------|\n| Air     | L\u00e9             |

Arakan.\n\n1.\u2014BURMESE.\n\nThis is the language of the Arakanese people, who for the most part live in the lowlands, and on the sea-coast of the country called Arakan. Provincial words occur in this language, differing from those of Burmah proper, and the pronunciation in Arakan varies considerably from that current in the valley of the \"Irrawaddy;\" yet the written languages of both countries are for the most part alike. Thus the word for a day written \u1000\u103c\u1000\u103a is pronounced R\u00e1k by the Arakanese, but by the Burmese is softened to Yet: the word for water is called by the Arakanese R\u00ed, by the Burmese Y\u00e9. It is written with the same letters by both people. The Arakanese and Burmese are of the same race, and have the common national name of Myam-m\u00e1, which is however a comparatively modern appellation for the several tribes, into which the race was originally divided. The term Mug is applied by the people of India to the Arakanese. It is exclusively a foreign epithet, unknown to the Arakanese themselves. It probably takes its origin from the tradition of a tribe of Br\u00e1hmans, termed M\u00e1gas, said to have emigrated Eastward from Bengal.\n\n2.\u2014KHYENG.\n\nThis name is given by the Burmese and Arakanese to a numerous race of people who live in the high range of mountains called Yo-m\u00e1 (that is \"great ridge,\" or \"back-bone\"), which separates Arakan from the valley of the Irrawady. These people call themselves Shyou or Shyu. The word Khyeng (pronounced Khy\u00e1ng or Ky\u00e1ng by the Arakanese) is probably a corruption of Kl\u00e1ng* their word\n\n* Perhaps so; but Ky\u00e1ng or Khi\u00e1ng is a well known ethnic designation to the Northward where, by the way, with Chinese and Tibetans many of the ethnic designations of the Indo-Chinese region are familiar terms of their own, as Mon, Lho, Lao, S\u00e9k, Ky\u00e1ng, Myau. Nearer at hand we have, as terms allied to Khyeng, Rakheng (whence our Arakan for \"the Mugs;\") Khyi for the \"Cossiahs,\" Kho vel Kyo and K\u00e1 for Kambojian tribes, and K\u00e1 Khyen for \"the Kariens,\" whilst the Kambojian Kyo vel Gyo re-appears in the Kho of the Koladyne river, and in the \"Moitay\" of Manip\u00far, we have the combined appellations of the Siamese Tai,\nfor man; and their own present distinctive name for their tribe, is no doubt recently adopted. An Arakanese in writing down for me words from the mouth of a man of this race, wrote Khy\u00e1ng for what appeared to me to have the sound of Kl\u00e1ng. The Khyeng country extends along the Yo-m\u00e1 range (which runs nearly N. N. W. and S. S. E.) from about the nineteenth to the twenty-first degree of North latitude. The people inhabit both the Burmese and British side of the range. The ascertained number of this race under British rule in Arakan is 13,708 souls. An equal number probably reside within the Burmese territory. There are also a large number of Khyeng tribes, which though living within the nominal British frontier, yet from the rugged inaccessible nature of their country, are really independent, and which have never yet submitted to any foreign Government, whether Arakanese, Burmese, or British. Their language is unwritten. There appears to be some difference of dialect between the Northern and Southern tribes of Khyeng. The words here given were taken from a man belonging to the Northern tribes. The Khyengs believe themselves to be of the same lineage as the Burmese and Arakanese, the stragglers from armies or moving hordes, left in the mountains.*\n\n3.\u2014Kam\u00ed' or Ku'm\u00ed'.\n\nThis race of people, of which there are two divisions called by themselves Kam\u00ed vel Kimi and K\u00fam\u00ed, and by Arakanese respectively Awa K\u00fam\u00ed and Aphy\u00e1 K\u00fam\u00ed, inhabits the hills bordering the river which is named by the Arakanese Kul\u00e1d\u00e1n, (that is, limit or border of the Kula or Western foreigner) and by the Kam\u00eds Ye-man, by the K\u00fam\u00eds Yan p\u00e1n. It is the chief river of Arakan. It is probable that the Kam\u00eds and K\u00fam\u00eds have not been settled in their present\n\nand the Kochin Chinese \"Moy.\" In other words, the Manipurian tribe, called Comiahs by the Beng\u00e1lus, belong to the Mof section of the great tribe called Tai by themselves and Sh\u00e1n vel Sy\u00e1n by the Burmese, the sectional name being also foreign, and equivalent to the native? Khyi or Khy\u00e1ng of Chinese and Khyeng of Burmese.\u2014B. H. H.\n\n* This native tradition and opinion accord with what follows relative to the Khyan and Mr\u00e1ng in corroborating the doctrine which assigns the whole of the border mountaineers towards Ava, or inhabitants of the Yo-m\u00e1 range from Assam to Arakan, to the Rakheng division of the Myam-ma.\u2014B. H. H.\nseat for more than five or six generations. They gradually expelled therefrom a tribe called Mr\u00fa or My\u00fa. The Kami clans are now themselves being disturbed in their possessions by more powerful tribes, and are being gradually driven Westward and Southward. They state that they once dwelt on the hills now possessed by the Khyengs, and portions of the tribe have been driven out by the latter within the memory of man. The language of the Kami portion of this interesting race has lately been reduced to writing by the Rev. Mr. Stilson of the American Baptist Mission. The Kami words entered in this vocabulary have been chiefly furnished by an intelligent Kami young man educated by that gentleman, and are more to be depended upon than the other portions. For it is exceedingly difficult to acquire from savages through the medium of a language foreign to them, any words but those which they use to designate some object or quality. The number of Kam\u00eds within the British territory amounts to 4,129 souls. They are divided into several clans, each having a distinctive name. The dialects of these clans differ more or less from each other. Many clans are independent.\n\n4.\u2014Mr\u00fa' or Toung Mr\u00fa'.\n\nThis is a hill tribe now much reduced from its ancient state. They once dwelt on the river Kul\u00e1d\u00e1n and its feeders, but have been gradually driven out by the Kami tribe. They have therefore emigrated to the West, and occupy hills on the border between Arakan and Chittagong. The R\u00e1dzaweng, or history of the Arakanese kings, refers to this tribe as already in the country when the Myam-ma race entered it. It states also that one of this tribe was chosen king of Arakan about the fourteenth century of the Christian era. The traditions recorded in the same work also imply that the Mr\u00fa and Myam-ma races are of the same lineage, though this connection is denied by the Arakanese of the present day, who regard the Mr\u00fa tribe as \"wild men\" living in a degraded state, and consider that it would be disgraceful to associate with them. The number of the Mr\u00fa tribe in Arakan amounts to about 2,800 souls. Their language is unwritten. They call themselves Mr\u00fa. Toung Mr\u00fa* is a name\n\n* Toung means wild, uncultured, as \"hill men\" with us and Pahari or Parbatia with Hindus. Mr\u00fa alias My\u00fa=Myau of Chinese which again=Ky\u00e1ng.\u2014B. H. H.\ngiven to some of their clans by the Arakanese. *Mru* is also used by the Arakanese as a generic term for all the hill tribes of their country. The word Khyeng is occasionally used in the same sense.\n\n5.\u2014Sa'k.\n\nThis is a very small tribe mentioned by Buchanan in his paper \"on the religion and literature of the Burmese.\" Asiatic Researches, Vol. VI. p. 229. He calls them \"Thok,\" (that being the Burmese pronunciation of the word,) and states that they are \"the people inhabiting the Eastern\" branch of the Nauf river, and are called by the Bengalis Chatn and \"Chatnmas.\" Chatn is no doubt meant for Sa'k which is the name, these people now give themselves. Their language is unwritten.\n\nThere are other tribes in Arakan who have languages or dialects peculiar to themselves. They consist of but a few families, and some no doubt are the descendants of captives brought into the country several generations back by the Arakanese, in their warlike expeditions against the adjoining countries. Of these, the language of the tribe called D\u00e1ing-n\u00e1t appears to be a rude corrupt dialect of Beng\u00e1li. The tribe called Mr\u00fang state that their ancestors were brought as captives from the Trip\u00fara hills. There is also a curious tribe called Khyau* in the Kul\u00e1dan country, consisting of not more than from fifty to sixty families. I have not yet been able to obtain satisfactory vocabularies of the languages of these last named three tribes, but they will be procured on the first opportunity. I regret\n\n*Kyo aforesaid? The tradition would ally them with the K\u00e1ki and Khyi, whence Kyo, Khyen, Khyi, and K\u00faki may be conjectured to be radically one and the same term, and to be an opprobrious epithet bestowed by the now dominant races of Indo-China upon the prior races whom they have driven to the wilds, for Khyi, Kyi, K\u00ed, K\u00fa has the wide spread sense of dog. Not one of these tribes is known abroad by its own name. Kami may be readily resolved into \"men of the Ka tribe,\" the Ka being a proper name or merely an emphatic particle. Ka, mutable to K\u00ed and K\u00fa, is a prefix as widely prevalent in the Him\u00e1laya and Tibet as the word mi for man. The Kam\u00eds themselves understand the word in the latter sense\u2014a very significant circumstance quoad affinities. Ka prefix is interchangeable with Ta, (Ka-va or Ta-va, a bird in Kam\u00ed, and so in most of these tongues,) and Ta varies its vowel like Ka; and thus, in Gyar\u00fang, tir-mi, a man, answers Kimi, a man.

B.\u2014English system of Spelling used in the above, which I have not ventured to alter.\u2014B. H. H.\nOn the Mongolian Affinities of the Caucasians.\u2014By B. H. Hodgson, Esq.\n\nAll residents in the East who take an interest in the more general topics of Ethnology must have been exceedingly struck by Dr. Latham's recent imposing exhibition of the vast ethnic domain of the Mongolidae. From Easter island to Archangel, from Tasmania and Madagascar to Kamtschatka and the mouths of the Lena, all is Mongolian! Caucasus itself, the Arian Ararat, is Mongolian! India, the time-honoured Aryavarta, is Mongolian! Granting that this remarkable sketch* is in good part anticipatory with reference to demonstrative proofs, it is yet, I believe, one which the progress of research has already done, and is now doing much, and will do yet more, to substantiate as a whole; though I think the learned Author might have facilitated the acceptance of his splendid paradoxes, if, leaving the Oseti\u2020 and the Br\u0101hmans in unquestioned possession of their Arian honours, he had contented himself with maintaining that the mass of Caucasian and Indian population is nevertheless of Turanian, not Arian, blood and breed; and if, instead of laying so much stress upon a special Turanian type (the Seriform), he had been more sensible that the technical diagnostics, which have been set upon the several subdivisions of the Mongolidae, are hindrances, not helps, to a ready perception of the common characteristics of the whole race.\n\nI do not propose on the present occasion to advert to what has been lately done in India demonstrative of the facts, that the great mass of the Indian population, whether now using the Tamulian or the Prakritic tongues, whether now following or not following the Hindu creed and customs, is essentially non-Arian as to origin and race, but that this mass has been acted upon and altered to an amazing extent by an Arian element, numerically small, yet of wonderful energy and of high antiquity. These are indubitable facts, the validity of which I am prepared with a large body of evidence to establish; and they are facts which, so far from being inconsistent\n\n* Natural History of Man, London, 1850.\n\u2020 It will be seen in the sequel, that in the course of those investigations which gave the \"Comparative analysis\" its present amplitude, I satisfied myself that the Oseti are Mongolian.\nwith each other, as Latham virtually assumes, are such that their joint operation during ages and up to this hour is alone capable of explaining those physical and lingual characteristics of the Indian population, which Dr. Latham's theory leaves not merely wholly unexplained, but wholly inexplicable. I must however postpone their discussion till I come to treat of the Newar and Khas tribes of Nep\u00e1l. In the meanwhile and with reference to Dr. Latham's crowning heresy that the most Caucasian of Caucasians (the Ir\u00f3n or Osseti) are \"more Chinese than Indo-European,\" I have a remarkable statement to submit in confirmation of his general, though not his special, position, my agreement with him being still general, not special.\n\nHis general position quoad Caucasus is, that the Caucasian races are Mongolidan; and, availing himself with unusual alertness of the results of local Indian research, he has, at pp. 123\u2014128, given copious extracts from Brown's Indo-chinese vocabularies, as printed in our Journal; and he has then compared these vocables with others proper to the Caucasian races. My recent paper upon the close affinity of the Indo-chinese tongues with those of the Himalaya and of Tibet, will show how infinitely the so-called \"Chinese\" element of this comparison may be extended and confirmed; and my Sifunese series, now nearly ready, will yet further augment this element of the comparison, which in these its fuller dimensions certainly displays an extraordinary identity in many of the commonest and most needful words of the languages of Caucasus on the one hand, and of Tibet, Sifan, the Himalaya, Indo-china, and China on the other. There is no escaping, as I conceive, from the conclusion that the Caucasian region, as a whole, is decidedly Mongolian, what I have now to add in the shape of grammatical or structural correspondences affording so striking a confirmation of that heterodox belief, whilst Bopp's somewhat strained exposition of the Arian characteristics of the Ir\u00f3n (as of the Malayo-Polynesian) provokes a doubt even as to them, despite the Edinburgh Review.*\n\n* No. 192, article Bopp's Comp. Grammar\u2014a work that cannot be too highly rated, though its style of demonstration is not equally applicable beyond the Indo-Germanic pale. Its spirit may pass that pale, but not its letter, as when the Georgian sami is identified with the Sanscrit tri, Greek \u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2 and Latin tres. My\nfashion of the age to stickle, somewhat overmuch perhaps, for structural or grammatical correspondences, as the only or best evidence of ethnic affinity. I am by no means insensible of the value of such evidence; and, though I may conceive it to be less important in reference to the extremely inartificial class of languages now in question than in reference to the Indo-European class, I proceed to submit with great pleasure a telling sample of structural identity between the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang tongue, which is spoken on the extreme East or Chinese frontier of Tibet, equidistant from Khokhon\u00far and Y\u00fan\u00e1n, and the Circassian language, which is spoken in the West of Caucasus.\n\nThe Gy\u00e1r\u00fang sample is the fruit of my own research into a group of tongues heretofore unknown, even by name: the Caucasian sample is derived from Rosen apud Latham, pp. 120\u2014122.\n\nRosen, who was the first to penetrate the mysteries of Caucasian Glossology, states that the Circassian pronouns have two forms, a complete and separable one, and an incomplete and inseparable one. 2nd, that in their incomplete or contracted and concreted form, the pronouns blend themselves alike with the nouns and with the verbs. 3rd, that these pronouns, like the nouns, have no inflectional or other case signs, in other words, are immutable.\u2020 4th, that the complete form of the pronouns is distinguished by the suffix Ra. Now, every one of these very arbitrary peculiarities belongs to the pronouns in the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang language, not less than in that of Circassia, as the following examples will show; and I should add that by how much the develop-\n\ndoubt respects the Oseti, not the Malayo-Polynesians, for I am satisfied that they are Mongolian, and would now add a striking and novel statement in support of that opinion, but that I must by so doing, go too far ahead of my yet unproduced Sifan vocabularies. The true and endless Mongolian equivalents for the Georgian numeral may be seen in the Appendix to this Essay.\n\n\u2020 I have now ascertained that the same principles prevail, with slight variations, in the Hayn, Kuswar, Kiranti and Limbu languages of the Him\u00e1laya, in the Uraon, Ho, Sontal and Gondi tongues of Tamilian India, and in the Tagala and Malaya languages of the Pelasgian group, though passing out of use in the last named tongue as in several of the Him\u00e1layan tongues. See remarks in the Supplement. I may add that in the Hayn language (of which I have a detailed account nearly completed) the verbs are distinguished into the two classes of transitives and intransitives precisely as in Malaya.\nment of this part of speech is anomalous throughout the Tartar or Mongolian tongues, by so much is the instanced coincidence with the Circassian more significant, the anomalous or irregular character of the pronouns of both not sufficing to conceal the coincidence, and therefore doubly illustrating it.\n\nCircassian.\u2014Ab, father. Wara, thou, the full pronoun. Wa, the contracted form, used in composition.\n\nHence W\u00e1b or Wa-ab, thy father.\n\nGy\u00e1r\u00e1ng.\u2014P\u00e9, father. Nanr\u00e9, thou, the full pronoun. Na, the contracted form, used in composition.\n\nHence Nap\u00e9 or Na-p\u00e9, thy father.\n\nVerbal Use.\n\nCircassian.\u2014War\u00e1, { wa \u00fa } \u2014kwisloit, thou ridest.\n\nGy\u00e1r\u00e1ng.\u2014Nanr\u00e9 na\u2014syo, thou knowest.\n\nI have changed the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng verb, because I do not possess the equivalent in that tongue for to ride. It matters not, however, as the sample shows the grammatical form to be absolutely the same in both sentences, just as well as if ride were the verb used in both.\n\nThe other rules and examples (scanty I admit) given by Latham from Rosen may be matched in each instance by Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng rule and sample, as will be seen in the sequel. But there is this difference in respect to the Ra suffix, that it is applied to the first and second pronouns in Circassian, though not to the third; and to the second only in Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng.*\n\nThis however is in complete conformity with the other and typical Mongolian tongues; for in Mantch\u00fa, and in Mongol also, the Ra suffix is found, but attaching only to the third personal; and, if we compare the T\u00e9r\u00e9 of those tongues\u2020 with the Chinese T\u00e1 and the Sokpo Th\u00e1, we shall perceive the perfect analogy of the suffix throughout these tongues, in spite of its varying applications.\n\n* The first and second pronouns are so nearly alike in Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng (nga, na) that the r\u00e9 suffix has probably been reserved to the second, in order to difference it more plainly.\n\n\u2020 Recherches sur les langues Tartares, pp. 173, 185. I cannot thus revert to the thoughts of my old antagonist (voce Buddhism) without a fresh tear dropt on the untimely grave of that truly amiable and learned man.\nBut is there no clue to the irregularities, none to the real force and signification, of this pronominal suffix? Clearly there is; for, in the Tibetan language the word rang, meaning self, and attaching to all the personal pronouns alike,* affords us that clue, though the people of Circassia and the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, whose common and familiar use of this suffix is so perfectly analogous, seem equally unaware of the fact, and can neither explain the meaning, nor the partial application, of their suffix, any more than can the Mantch\u00fas and Mongols. This I infer from the silence of authors, and should add that the explanations are wholly my own, my Gy\u00e1r\u00fang interpreter being able only to express very unsophisticated surprise when asked to analyse a word.\n\nBut I have not yet done with the analogy of Circassian and Gy\u00e1r\u00fang pronouns, having still to notice that the third personal in Circassian, which drops the Ra suffix, is not really a personal but a demonstrative, equivalent to ille, iste. Now, the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang language has a third personal, which the Circassian lacks; but it has also a demonstrative, and that demonstrative is the very same as the Circassian one; that is, \u00ed or w; and this pronoun has, in both tongues alike a separate, full, and a concrete contracted form. Moreover, in the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang tongue the forms and uses of this demonstrative afford a perfect elucidation both of its strange metamorphosis (W. to T.) and of its anomalous suffix (i), in Circassian; for \u2018wat\u00fa\u2019 is the complete separate form in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang; whilst \u2018wa,\u2019 the contracted form, alone used in composition, constantly takes \u00ed, which is really a genitive sign and recognised as such in Tibetan but is a mere \u201cparticule morte\u201d in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang as in Circassian. Take the following samples from Gy\u00e1r\u00fang: Wat\u00fa, he, iste, ille: Wap\u00e9, his father: Womo,\u2020 his\n\n* Nga, I, Ngarang, I myself, Egomet; and so Kh\u00e9rang, Kh\u00f3rang. Remusat has sadly confused the Tibetan pronouns, and, as I suspect, those of the other \u201clangues tartares,\u201d though his work be a marvel for the time and circumstances of its publication. Remusat ut supra, p. 365.\n\n\u2020 The change of wa into wo, in wap\u00e9 and womo, is an instance of that vocalic harmony which these languages so much affect, and which has been erroneously supposed to be peculiar to Turki. We have abundant alliteration both vocalic and consonantal out of, or beyond the Turki branch of, the Mongolian tongues.\n\nShaimek, from Shi and Mek, has other peculiarities precisely similar to what occur in the Altaic tongues, testa Remusat.\nmother: Waimyek, wa-i-myek, his eye (myek, eye): Shaimek, shai-i-mek, leaf of tree (shi, tree, mek, leaf); and then turn to the Circassian samples in Latham, \u00fa-i, he; t-ab, his father;* \u00fa-kwisloit, he rides, and you will perceive that (\u00fa being the same with w) the nominal t and the verbal i of Circassian are the secondary or suffix portions of the full Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng pronoun exalted into primaries in order to difference the third person from the second, the second already having the wa or \u00fa (wab, thy father; \u00fa-kwisloit, thou ridest) form. And that such substitution of the secondary for the primary part of a word is no arbitrary assumption of mine, but a regular principle of the Caucasian and of the Mongolian tongues, may be seen by the numerous examples of it occurring in the subjoined list of vocables. The above elucidations of Circassian pronouns for which I am entirely answerable, are so thoroughly in the spirit of Bopp's system that I trust they may find favour in his eyes, though I have ventured to demur to his Arianising of the Tartars by too strained applications of that system.\n\nI know not if Rosen at all explains the peculiarities of the pronouns in Circassian, but Latham does not; and it will therefore be felt as a truly interesting circumstance that the explanation just given, like that of the Ra suffix, have been fetched from Lh\u00e1ssa and Lith\u00e1ng! The cultivated tongue of Tibet proper continues, it will be seen, to afford the clue to the labyrinth; and that it does so, is surely a strong presumptive proof, as well of its superior antiquity as of its superior completeness. So judging, I cannot moreover doubt that the Circassian preterite sign is the same with the Tibetan preterite sign (Chen-Tshar), though this be beside the mark of pronominal expositions,\u2014and to these I must confine myself, or I shall not know where to stop, so constantly do these Tartarian illustrations of the Caucasian tongue flow in upon me. I am unaware\n\n* In the supplement to this paper will be found an exact and beautiful pendant for this Circassian sample, derived from the Tamulian tongues, the Sontal language having \u00fa and i for the 3rd personal and these commutable, in composition, into the conjunct form of t\u00e9, precisely as in the Circassian tongue. From the Gondi tongue is there given another example of the commutation of \u00fa to t, so that my exposition from the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng instance is placed beyond doubt, whilst some fresh and beautiful links are added to the chain of affinities, as to which see prior note.\nwhether the Circassian language is distinguished, like the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, by a very ample employment of those prefixes which, as more or less employed, characterise so many of the Mongolian tongues, and which are dropt in composition, like the Ra suffix. Thus, tarti, a cap, in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, is compounded of ti the root, and tar* the prefix: but, if we join a noun or pronoun to this word, the prefix disappears, and \"his cap,\" for example, is w\u00e1rti, compounded of the w\u00e1 above-mentioned and the radical ti. In like manner taimek, a leaf, when compounded with sh\u00ed, a tree, drops the t\u00e1 prefix and becomes Shaimek, as t\u00e1p\u00e9, father, becomes Ngap\u00e9, my father.\u2020 Rosen, should this paper fall under his eye, or Latham perhaps, whose quick eye will not fail to catch it, will be able to tell whether the same peculiarity distinguishes the Circassian tongue. For myself I doubt not it will so prove, because the rule for nouns is but another phase of the rule for pronouns.\n\nIn the meantime, the striking grammatical analogies\u2021 I have pointed out stand in no need of further elucidation, and these analo-\n\n* Ts, the common form, becomes Tar, differentially as Timi, fire; Tirmi, man, Root Mi, used in both senses. In Tirmi, Tarti, Warti, we have the ra particle which remains in its conjunct form as a medial, whilst the usual prefix ta disappears. The r\u00e1 too would disappear in a compound of roots if not needed to differentials and mark the special sense of such roots, or one of them, or if the root commenced with other than a labial consonant, its prefix being servile.\n\n\u2020 It has been queried whether the polysynthetic words of the American tongues, quoad their principle of construction, as to which there is so much doubt, be not compiled from radical particles only. Judging by the method of forming ordinary compounds in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang and its allies, I should say, Yes, certainly they are to a great extent, though not exclusively, for the cumulative principle ill brooks control, revelling in reiterations and transpositions of root alike, and of its servile adjuncts though clearly, as to simple compounds, constantly observing the rules of contraction and of substitution noted in the text. In the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang sentence Tiz\u00e9kaz\u00e9 pap\u00fan, he summoned them to feast, the word for to feast shows the root repeated twice, and each time with a separate servile, though we have here only one verb, not two verbs, and in Kalarlar, round, still no compound, we have the root repeated, but yet with a servile, though only one, being the prefix ka. In such cases that servile is usually omitted as kaka, sky; pyepye, bird; chacha, hot.\n\n\u2021 Those analogies might now be largely extended did health and time permit. Take the following instances: Tam-bas, father; imbas, my father, in Uraon. Sampa, father; ampa, my father, in Kiranti. Ku-kos, child; ing-kos, my child, Uraon. Tam, sam, ku, serviles, replaced by the pronouns, compare Maylayan sampiyan, san-dir\u00ed, kan-dir\u00ed, ka-manus, k\u2019anak, &c.\ngies, together with the explanation from the Tibetan of the widely-used but heretofore unexplained Ra suffix, constitute in themselves, and as sustaining all those numerous identities of the primitive vocabularies which have been adverted to, something very like a demonstration of the Mongolidan affinities of the Caucasians, though I would be understood to speak with a due sense of the disqualifications inseparable from my secluded position and want of access to books. I subjoin Latham's sample of the construction of the Circassian language, with its equivalent in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang.\n\n'I give to my father the horse.'\n\nCircassian\u2014Sara s-ab ac\u00e9 istap\nI my father horse give\n\nGy\u00e1r\u00fang\u2014Ngar\u00e9* nga-p\u00e9 boroh dovong\nI my father horse give\n\n'In the house are two doors' is, in like manner, 'house two doors' in the Circassian and Gy\u00e1r\u00fang tongues.\n\nThe plural sign, kw\u00e9 in Circassian, my\u00e9 or kamy\u00e9\u2020 in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, is in both languages alike \"the beginning and end of declension.\"\n\nThe following list of Circassian and Gy\u00e1r\u00fang pronouns may facilitate the reader's apprehension.\n\n| I | Thou | He |\n|---|------|----|\n| Circassian pronouns\u2014Sa-ra. | Wa-ra | U-i. |\n| Gy\u00e1r\u00fang pronouns\u2014Ng\u00e1. | Nan-r\u00e9. | Wa-tu. |\n\nThe same conjoined with a noun.\n\nCircassian.\u2021\u2014S-ab W-ab.

But they run into each other, and the root very generally is further employed to designate tribes from Caucasus to Indo-China, as Mi-shi-mi from the Mi and Shi roots, M\u00fa-r-mi, from the Mu and Mi roots, &c. &c.\n\nTribe names derived from name of species\u2014a very extensively diffused principle. The etymology of Burma, or the Burmese is thus recovered. See Supplement.\n\nMi, the species: Jang and sa sexual adjuncts. Jang = mas. Sa = f\u00e6.\n\nMeans girl. Ya, differential servile with reference to the various senses of the Mi root.*\n\nMeans woman. Root Mi. Ma is a feminine and maternal sign.\n\nMeans girl. See note in sequel.\n\nS'm\u00e9 means girl, like Sa-mi and S\u00e9-me. The Sa particle in various phases, added to Mi root.\n\nYa, a differential servile.\n\nAn article. See Crawford\u2019s work for proof how these so called articles blend with the pronouns.\n\n* The basis of all these tongues from Caucasus to Oceanica is a small number of monosyllabic roots bearing necessarily many senses. Hence to distinguish between those several senses is the chief function of the servile adjuncts of the roots. In this language, for example, the root w\u00e0 means, come, tooth, rice, rain, throw, and he.\nOn the Mongolian Affinities of the Caucasians.\n\nSa in Malay.\nS\u00e1-m in Vagu.\n\nI.\u2014M\u00e1 in Ossetic.\nM\u00e1 in Mingrelian.\nM\u00e1 in Lazic.\nMi in Suanic.\nMa in Tinnic.\n\nMo-n in Sap.\n\nMi in Mongol.\nMi in Mantchu.\n\nI.\u2014J\u00e9-s in Armenian.\nJi in Newari.\nv Ja in Horpa.\n\nI.\u2014A-z, A-s in Ossetic.\nAn-ka in Kiranti.\nA-ku, A in Malay.\nA in Manyak.\nK\u00e1 in Dhimali.\n\nThou.\u2014She-n in Georgian.\nSi in Mingrelian.\nSi in Suanic.\nT'shi in Mongol.\nSe-n in Turki.\nSa-n in Onigur.\nSa in Finnic.\nChh\u00e1 in Newari.\nCh\u00e1 in Sokpa.\nS\u00e1 in Tai.\n\nHe.\u2014N\u00e1 in Armenian.\nN\u00e1 in Chinese.\nN\u00e1 in Malay.\nNi in Khyeng.\nNo in Anam.\nHa-n\u00e1-i h'n\u00e1-i in Kami.\n\nMeans one.

For K\u2019 prefix of Kli, see K\u2019mari.\n\nZhi, S\u00f3, Z\u00e1, are three conjunct suffix forms of the S\u00e1 particle which is seen in Manyak in its separate unaltered form as a prefix. Here it is altered, 1st, by dropping its own harmonised vowel (see Zhi, infra), 2nd, by absorbing the vowel of the root. Din, Den, for Di-ni, day, and Sm\u00e9 for S\u00e9me girl, are parallel instances of change as of transposition are Mi-as and Sa-mi,\u2020 voce man. See note below? and that on the Ma particle, voce \u2018Day.\u2019\n\n* It is because the 3rd personal is so perpetually identical with the demonstratives, of which the direct and exclusive principle is contrast, that the same elements come to express the contrasts of place and time and manner (here there; now then; as, so.) He who would trace the remoter affinities of race, must treat languages in this thoughtful manner.\n\n\u2020 Notz.

We shall presently see it usurping the place of the root.\n\nThese abundant instances from the Mongolian series plainly prove the root in the Caucasian series, and they show that root precisely such in every phase (mi, m\u00e9, m\u00e1,) as it is seen in the Caucasian series. We thus securely proceed to the serviles or rather servile, and this the Manyak word, below, gives in the primitive state, unaltered by blending or by euphony. We are therefore certified as to its various altered forms (zhi, z\u00e1, s\u00e9), in the Caucasian series. Observe also in the Mongolian series that all the tongues which use the Mi root in the sense of man have M\u00e9 instead of Mi for fire.\n\nTurn to Ma-f\u00e1, supra, and note again how the servile supersedes the root, as in Zi for Mi, fire. So also Tibetan Ba for Circassian baa, voce cow, and Anamese Di for Dido Bi, voce skin; the last so decisively proved by the Murmi form of the word wherein root and servile both appear, Di-bi. Thus the Circassian word Ma-fa supplements and expounds the Tai and Khamti word Fa-i; and this the Manyak word Sa-\n\nfrom my Tibeto-Himalayan vocabularies; thus in full, Mi-sa, woman, in Newari, Sa-mi, girl, in Burmese and Khyeng, and Sme, in Horpa, root Mi, Me, mankind, and Sa, a feminine and diminutive sign. In short the Sa particle, like all others, may be prefix or suffix, and separate or blended. Hence Mse, Georgian = Sa-me, Manyak. With regard to the suffixed Zhi, Zi, or Za, clearly = Sa, it would seem as if Mi were the Sun or great fire, of which Mi-sa is the diminutive, just as S\u00e9 is the earth, or terrestrial globe, and Sa-ch (cha = sa) earth, soil. See 'earth' in sequel.\nmeh supplements and expounds the Georgian word Ms\u00e9 and its Svanic and Absne equivalents.

These last words of the fire series afford excellent illustration of the wide scope of servile adjuncts.\n\nDi is the da prefix harmonised in its vowel to that of the root Ni.\n\nDen shows the above prefix conjunct, and the ni root altered to n\u00e9, become \u00e9n per metastasin.

It is likewise true that these elements and the words resulting from them are less flexible and mutable than among the Arian tongues. But it is by no means generally or strictly true that \"all the words are invariable.\" On the contrary, the words, whether consisting of monosyllable roots, or of such roots and their servile adjuncts, are constantly subjected to changes, which are clearly systematic, which belong alike to the radical and servile particles, and which may be summarised as follows:\n\n1st by aspiration, as Khi for Ki.\n2nd by change of vowel, Ko, Ku, Ke, Ka for Ki.\n3rd by intercalation of y, Khyi for Khi.\n4th by metastasis, ain for nai, voice ear, &c.\n\nKwi root = Ku-i.\n\nThese are compounds of the two preceding words\u2014a sort of terms very common in all countries wherein many tongues prevail.\n\nThe root varies from Ch\u00e1 to Ch\u00e9, and Sa to S\u00e9 to Si, to Shi.

How common it is may be seen by consulting my Himalayan Vocab. P\u00e9 is the root, borrowing the t from the servile suffix.\n\nPy\u00e9 = P\u00e9.

These are merely the conjunct forms of the ba, ga prefixes.

All this is perfectly conformable to what has been seen in the nouns, and it follows therefore that the peculiarities commonly ascribed to the numbers do not really exist.

The above paper has been considerably augmented in number of vocables, and in the analysis of them, since it was first presented to the Society, though not to the extent I had hoped and purposed if health had not failed me. If however the principles of the analysis (sufficiently revealed in their application and in the observations of this and the following paper) be sound, they may be easily carried as much further as is desired.\n\nWith regard to the soundness of those principles I am fully prepared for censure of the presumption of attempting to analyse unknown tongues;\u2014prepared also to see many errors of detail detected, to afford apparent justification of such censure.\n\nI can but solicit the particular attention of the candid to the perfect uniformity of the phenomena presented by the vocables, whether nouns, pronouns or numerals, from the very beginning to the very end of my paper, and ask, How this is to be explained, except upon those principles which a comparison of the numerous Himalayan tongues with each other and with that of Tibet led me first to detect, and which my opportunities of novel exploration beyond the Himalaya afforded me great advantages for testing the more extended application of? I have to regret that my investigations have been interrupted just when they were beginning to produce their ripest fruit, and to solicit the Society's favourable construction of what is now submitted, as it is, rather than trust to an uncertain future for its improvement.\n\nSupplement to the paper on the Mongolian Affinities of the Caucasians.\n\nSince the above paper was hastily written I have obtained through the courteous aid of our Secretary the loan of the Mithridates and Asia Polyglotta. The ampler stock of Caucasian and Mongolian vocables thus placed within my reach (and illustrated too by occasional analytical notices) has needed only to be compared with my\nown large stores from the Himalaya, Tibet, Sifan, Indo-china and Tamulian India, to satisfy me that the widest assumed scope of Allophylian affinities might be placed on an unassailable basis. Again, a renewed reference to well known works* has equally satisfied me that nothing short of a careful analytical demonstration would be accepted after the frequent insufficiently supported assertions, and more or less superficial investigations that have been given to the world, even Dr. Latham's splendid panoramic view of the subject, though in fact well grounded on the opinions at least of numerous scholars,\u2020 and fortified, moreover, by the adduction of some special evidence\u2021 either priorly overlooked or only recently accessible, having met with a cold, not to say a scoffing, reception.\u00a7\n\nI therefore beg permission to withhold for the present the comparative list of Caucasian and Mongolian vocables which I had prepared to accompany the above paper on the resemblance of Circassian and Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng pronouns, pledging myself that that list shall ere long be submitted to the Society, so amplified, and analysed, as to enable the scholar both to test and to extend the analogies sampled by the list.||\n\nIn the meanwhile and with reference to the above paper I subjoin some farther explanations which will not only serve to illustrate more fully its special topic (pronouns), but to show how continued attention to the general topic teems with fresh proofs of the soundness of the opinion that Caucasus is essentially Tartaric, and that the widest sense of the word Tartaric is the truest.\n\nKlaproth, who was too well informed on the subject to insist on the Arian origin of the Caucasians generally, yet contended that the Osi were Indo-germanic.\n\nI shall soon be able, I think, to show that the elements and the mechanism of words in the Osetic tongue are purely Tartar, and that\n\n* Prichard III. 13 et seq; IV. 384 et seq.

Article Bopp's Grammar.\n|| This has been done, I hope tolerably effectually, in the list as it now stands.\nthe very name of the race (O-si*), like that of the Georgians (Swan), proves their Tartaric progeniture, these names being significant, and significant in the special mode in use among the Tartar races. How Bopp could contend for the Arian origin of a race styling themselves Swan, and go to Sanscrit for Georgian etymologies, I am the more surprised, as Swan in Sanscrit means Dog, and we can hardly suppose that the Georgians or any other people would call themselves Dogs, though their neighbours might so compliment them. Not to travel however beyond pronouns, I may mention that I have a long list of Mongolian equivalents for the Caucasian pronouns, and that, for instance, the M\u00e1 root in all its phases (M\u00e1, M\u00ed, M\u00f3, M\u00fa,) and in both its senses (nominal and pronominal) will be exactly matched by a long series of Tartaric equivalents. Nor are the so called inflections or declensional signs, less Tartaric than the roots; for instance \u00ed or n\u00ed for the genitive; an, ang, n\u00e1ng for the dative case; the \u00ed being Tibetan, Takpa, Horpa, &c.; the ni, Mongol, Mantch\u00fa, Turki, Bodo; the an or ang, nan or nang, Dhim\u00e1li, Turki, Ouig\u00e1r, &c. Here is a sample.\n\nPronoun I.\n\n| Onig\u00far. | Os\u00e9tic. |\n|---------|--------|\n| N. Ma, Ma-n, | Ma, Ma-n |\n| G. Ma-ni-ng, | Ma-ni. |\n| D. Ma-nang | Ma-nan. |\n\nIn Onig\u00far the first na suffix is often dropt in the dative, and the second, reiterated; and thus we have Mangg\u00e9 for Ma nang. Both changes are thoroughly consonant to the genius of these tongues, and are in perfect harmony with the alternative nominative form Ma, or Ma-n. The n final is here simply emphatic, and is the conjunct form of the na suffix. All these particles, in either their servile or radical character and function, may be used conjunctly and disjunctly, that is with or without their vowel;\u2020 and all may be also\n\n* See the note in the sequel on words with the O' and S\u00ed roots, O-as, O-su-ri, O-su-r-ka, &c.\n\n\u2020 Here are some examples, k' ma-ri man in Georgian, ka-mi, man in kami: M\u00fa-r\u00fa, man in Sunwar, M-r\u00fa man in Mr\u00fa (root, ma, mi, mu): M-za, fire in Aben\u00e9, Mi-za, fire in Avar (root mi): S-m\u00e9 girl in Horpa, S\u00e1-m\u00e9 girl in\naugmented by various new elements or by reiteration, without affecting the sense in either case. Here are some samples of the disjunct and reiterated, or added n\u00e1, with one of these singular equivalents.\n\nPronouns I. Thou. He.\n\nTibetan Na, Nani. Kh\u00e9, Kh\u00e9na. Kh\u00f3, Kh\u00f3na.\nEsthonian Ma, Minna. Si, Sinna. T\u00e9, Temma.\n\nWe see here that the suffix m\u00e1 is equal to the suffix n\u00e1. So also is the suffix r\u00e1, which has been noticed as common, in form and function, to the Circassian and Gy\u00e1r\u00fang tongues, but which in fact has a wide and almost universal prevalence among these tongues, being attached like all the other serviles alike to pronouns, nouns, numerals, adverbs and changing or dropping its vowel as well as taking the sursuffix n, ng, without more alteration in its meaning than in the other cases of reiteration and elision and vocalic changes above illustrated in the pronominal roots and serviles, and in the nominal ones also, by the subjoined note.\n\nIn fact such, and much greater, reiteration, cumulation, substitution and vocalic change, with concomitant contractions medial and final, affecting roots as well as serviles, are chief almost among the fundamental laws of these languages and constitute the veil that has so long concealed their complete affinity. Who, for instance, would suppose Namasini or contractedly Namsin, day, to be the same with Ni, Nyi, or Nin? Show him, however, the intermediate forms Nani, Mani and Sini, and show him also this intercalate y and final n of the root, as well as this cumulation and these changes of the serviles, holding good in a great number of other instances, and you will carry him with you in this one and the rest, as I hope to do my readers by and by.\n\nHere are some further pronominal illustrations of the Ra suffix.\n\nIt attaches, as r\u00e1, to the 1st and 2nd singular in Circassian, exclu-\n\nTunglhu, Sa-mi girl in Burmese (root m\u00e9, mi). Note also the vocalic changes of roots and of the servile ra, in ma-ri and m\u00e1-r\u00fa and m-r\u00fa ka servile of Georgian kmari, is dropt in Suanic Mar\u00e9, where again the servile ri becomes r\u00e9. In the Indo-chinese tongues we have the ka prefix present and absent in this very word, man, just as in the Caucasian, witness k\u2019 lun in kolun being lun in Burmese. I may add L-\u00f3-k in Tai and L\u00e9-g in Osetic with the k vel g suffix (root, l\u00e1, l\u00f3, l\u00e9).\nsively; to the 2nd singular only in Gy\u00e9rung, as r\u00e9; to the 3rd singular only in Mongol and Manch\u00fa, and Sokpo, as r\u00e9; to the 3rd singular only in Gondi as r; to the 3rd plural only in Turki, as r\u00e9; to all three plurals, and to no singular in Rukheng, as r\u00e9; to the same in Burmese as d\u00f3, (local difference and of pronunciation merely); to the 1st and 3rd plural in Mongol as d\u00e9 and d\u00e9 respectively; to all three plurals in Takpa, and to them only, as r\u00e9; to all the persons singular and plural in Tibetan, as r\u00e1ng, usually rendered by self; to the 1st and 3rd plural in Ouigur, as \u00e1r vel l\u00e1r. The usual reading of Olar, they, is O-lar, making lar a so-called plural sign. But if Ol be \u2018he,\u2019 in Ouigur and Turki, ol-ar must be \u2018they.\u2019 However, O is undoubtedly the root; as proveable by numberless instances in the cognate tongues; and l\u00e1 is an infix, and O-la-ra, the true etymological analysis, as of the Turkish anlar and anlar\u00e9, the analysis is, a-na-la-ra, \u00e1 being here* the root (angg\u00e9, to him a-ning, his), and na-la-ra, servile, whereof the first is the emphatic n\u00e1 above illustrated; and \u00e1r, vel r\u00e9, vel l\u00e1-r\u00e1, the so-called plural sign or signs, though in my judgment it is to mistake the true genius and character of these tongues to give to any of their particles, except with extreme reserve, the attributes of strict grammar (declensional marks), or a precise independent signification such as self for r\u00e1ng in Tibetan. R\u00e1ng is a compound of the r\u00e9, and ang particles. The phases of the latter are \u00e1, an, ang, and the reflective or egoistic sense, such as it is, (it is most like that of the Sanscrit awa) attaches, not to the compound r\u00e1ng, but to the simple ang. In B\u00f3do and G\u00e1ro and Hsyu \u00e1ng stands for the first personal pronoun; in Limbu and many other allied tongues it is the first possessive, in the form of \u00e1. In T\u00edgala and Malaya \u00e1 and \u00e1ku represent the first personal, and ang is an articular prefix of the same drift. The first personal is an-ka in Kiranti and a-sa in Osetic, prefix in all these instances, in others even of the same tongues it is a suffix;\u2020 but still whether\n\n* The change of the root from \u00f3 to \u00e1 in Turki and Ouigur is continued in Manchu, wherein it becomes \u00e1. Precisely in like manner we have Mi, vel M\u00e1 vel M\u00e9, for five, and Ni, vel Na, vel N\u00e9 for day, in Caucasus.\n\n\u2020 As ang is prefix or suffix, so is any other servile, for instance the k\u00e1 of anka, here cited; thus, k\u00e1' maari, maari, in Georgian (mari in Svanic) and Osarka, maid, in Mingrelian (Osuri in Lexic). See on to further note.\nattached to pronouns, verbs, or nouns and whether prefixed or post-\nfixed or standing alone, as root or servile, it is apt to indicate a\nreflective character. This is the reason why it so constantly marks\nthe possessive case, with or without a preposed particle; but if with\none, usually the n\u00e1 conjunct, which is only one phase, as ang-g\u00e9 is\nanother phase, of the repetition of itself; and this is also the reason\nwhy in so many of these tongues the \u00e1ng suffix when appended to\nverbs and their participles, designates the first person. Thus Kaz\u00e1ng\nI eat, Kaz\u00e1ngti I who eat, I the eater, I eating, from the root z\u00e1, z\u00f3,\nin Gy\u00e1rung. Pir\u00e9, give; Pi-r\u00e1ng or Pir\u00e1ng-g\u00e9 or Pir\u00e1ng-n\u00e9, give\nto me, in Limb\u00fa, from the root Pi Davo, give, Dav\u00f3ng give to me, in\nGy\u00e1rung, from the root va, vo. These forms are imperative. The\nindicative ones are similar, thus Pir\u00e9 and Dovo mean, you or he\n(quisvis pr\u00e6ter meipsum) gives; and Pir\u00e1ng, Dovong, I myself give,\nAng-n\u00e9 and Ang-g\u00e9 are equal and are reiterations of the a, an, or\nang particle.* Compare ang-g\u00e9 to me, in Turki and Ouig\u00far; and\nm\u00e1ng-g\u00e9 to me in Ouig\u00far with their equivalent m\u00e1-n\u00e1n in Osetic.\nPir\u00e9 and Pir\u00e1ng show very pointedly that the reflective virtue re-\nsides not in the r\u00e1 particle but in the \u00e1ng particle. This case also\nexemplifies their conjunction. M\u00e1-n\u00e1ng is the disjunct form; m\u00e1ng,\nthe conjunct; and m\u00e1ng-g\u00e9, is the same, only more emphatic; m\u00e1ng,\nto me, m\u00e1ng-g\u00e9 to myself; and m\u00e1ng-n\u00e9 and m\u00e1ng-r\u00e9, are both\nequivalents and emphasis merely. So mini is mine; and mining-\ng\u00e9, my own, in Mongol and Mantch\u00fa; the n\u00e1ng becoming n\u00edng\neuphonically to harmonise with the mi root. And, by the way, we\nmay here, as in all the other derivatives, note the forthcomingness\nof the widely prevalent Mi root, though obsolete as a nominative in\nthese two tongues, just as it is in the analogous sense of man (Ego = homo plur. exem.) in Burmese, wherein however we similarly gather\nit from its derivatives, woman and child, Mimma\u2020 and Sa mi.\n\n* In Sontal Uraon, Ho and Hayu, the ang becomes ing, and eng with the very\nsame emphatic reiteration, viz. eng gna and ing ga.\n\u2020 Compare Esthonian Temma, supra, where suffix ma = emphatic na. All these\ntongues affect alliteration and consonantal as well as vocalic harmony to an extent\nquite perplexing, since each tongue has its fancies in this respect. Here m\u00e1 is a\nroot.\nI have illustrated the pronominal and verbal uses of the r\u00e1 particle, as well as explained its relation to rang. Here are some exemplifications of its nominal and other uses. I fear I shall weary the reader; but he must remember that what is true of this particle is true of all the particles; and that, whereas a confined view of the character and functions of this grand element of these tongues has led to very erroneous notions as to their general affinity, so a complete conception of the nature of the particles is the best guide to a just perception of that affinity. For instance, Rosen has dwelt on the unique character of the Circassian pronouns arising in good part out of the operation of the r\u00e1 particle, and I, following him, have announced with reasonable surprise the fact that the same peculiarities are attached to the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng pronouns, whereas in very truth whatever he or I noticed in this respect as to the pronouns is equally true as to the nouns, adverbs, &c., and that not merely in the languages of the Circassia and Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng, but in every tongue from Caucasus to the Pacific. Here is the enumeration.\n\nMa-re, man, Suanic, Ma-ri, man,* Georgian, Ma-ro man, Lepcha,\n\n* I here omit the ka prefix, with full warrant from usage:\n\nSee prior note on kmari and kl\u00fau; ka suffix in Ozurka is the same thing and similarly omissible, witness osuri. Here \u00f3 is the root, = \u00fa, meaning man, and it also takes the k prefix. S\u00e1 is the sa particle harmonised in its vowel to the root. It is a diminutive, so that O-sa, U-sa or U-a-sa is child and Kusa is equally child. We have Kusa and A-sa in Limbu, and U-a-sa in Avor, U-sa in Ossetic, U-as in Wogul, U-er in Armenian, Sa in its capacity of diminutive means woman as well as child when added to any root for man as U or Mi; and hence Ossetic U-s\u00e1 woman = Mi-sa, Newari. Such and so concordant are all the elements. In Armenian Uert\u00ed, child, erti vel rati being servile, it follows that the \u00fa root for man may express juniors as well as adults, whilst the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng Us, man, and Ossetic U's woman prove that the U root expresses both sexes meaning man-kind or the species man, and also that Sa is not uniformly a diminutive but a synonyme. This will be amply proved by and by, when the O-U-W, and the Sa, Si, Shi, roots for mankind are arrayed, and then it will be also seen that the name of the Ossetic people is derived from two synonymes for man, and that, like T\u00e1-t\u00e1, or Tahe-taheash, it is = Allemanni. The Caucasian puzzle as to Us, Ush, Ushi, U-as, U-as-sa, U-er, O-sa, O-zu, is solved by this explanation, and if we add the Murmi B\u00fa root for man (supra) we have the clue to the Caucasian Bo-so, Bo-shi, Bit-shi, Bi-shi, for all which I have numerous Mongolian equivalents, thus Po-zo in Pasuko, Pa-sa in Karian, Bu-cha in Tekpa, Bi-sha and Bi-shi in Bodo.\nM\u00fa-r\u00e9, man, Suaw\u00e1r, M-r\u00fa, man, Mr\u00e1, Il\u00e9-ru, before, Turki, uz-r\u00e9 upon, Turki, Herel-ri man, Sont\u00e1l.\n\nLen-r\u00e9, once, Tibetan. Ky\u00fa-r\u00e9, river, Ak\u00fash. Th\u00f3-r\u00e9, to-morrow, Tibetan. W\u00e1-ran, rain, Ossetic. Mu-ran, river, Turki. Mai-ran, arm, Mantch\u00fa. Ko\u00f6l-ron, child, Mongol. Kho-rang, sky, Bodo. Ch\u00e1k-reng, hand, Garo. D\u00ed-rang, this, Serpa. D\u00e9-ring, to-day, Tibetan. R\u00e9-m-b\u00fa, man, Limbu. Res-ga, where, Tibetan (samples of prefix).

Ka-r, hand, Tshari. Ka-r, hand, Sokpo.\n\nWe thus see that the ra particle changes its vowel to the utmost (r\u00e9, r\u00e9, ri, r\u00e1, r\u00e9); takes the ang or other additional particle, (ti, ka, sa); occupies the initial (res-ga), medial (p\u00fa-r-ti), or final (ka-r) position, or even both (r g\u00fa-re), with reference to the root, and lastly, blends itself with that root dropping its vowel (g\u00e1r), or stands apart retaining its vowel (g\u00e1-r\u00fa); and all this without change or even modification of the meaning of the word as derived from the root further than a certain emphasizing can be so termed, as Kho-rang, the sky; ka-r, the hand.\n\nSuch elements of speech, and all the serviles are essentially alike, can with little propriety be designated by our grammar terms or alleged to be conjugational or declensional marks except with extreme caution. The essence of a grammatical rule or part of speech is generalization: the essence of the function of these particles is the very opposite or specialization; and thus it is that unlimited change of place and change of form belong to the latter, whilst nothing of the sort does or can belong to the former.\n\nOf the habit of applying our grammatical terms to the elements of these tongues in central Asia, without any apparent perception of their true character* as noted in the South Eastern islands, I will give a sample from the Altaic group of languages.\n\n* To prove this it suffices to advert to Vater's derivation of the Caucasian kar\nThe plurals of the Manchu personal pronouns are thus stated and commented upon.\n\nWe.  \nB\u00e9.  \nMous\u00e9.\n\nYe.  \nSouw\u00e9.\n\nThey.  \nT\u00e9s\u00e9t.\n\nTo this statement of the pronouns it is added that B\u00e9, Sou we, and T\u00e9s\u00e9t, constitute the ordinary series; that Mous\u00e9 is a sample of the Dualistic form; and that it is regularly derived from Mou, I, by the addition of the plural sign s\u00e9. Now it is quite true that the existence of a Dual or rather, of an inclusive plural* is one of the characteristics of these tongues and one that prevails very generally from the Pacific to Caucasus. But how it can be said that in the Manchu tongue this inclusive plural is formed regularly from the singular Mou by means of the plural sign s\u00e9, I cannot conceive, since a regular pluralizing particle would be uniformly applied and wear one shape, whereas there is here in the three persons of the pronouns no vestige of such attributes in the s\u00e9 particle. The ordinary \"we\" (b\u00e9) has no trace of this or other pluralizing suffix: the ordinary \"ye\" (sou we) has quite a different augment (we); and, lastly, the 3rd person shows the s\u00e9 particle indeed, but with a foreign element or suffixed t (s\u00e9t). Now surely a grammatical rule must have some identity of character; what it includes must be similar in form and application. But that in the Manchu pronouns the plurals cannot be said to be regularly formed by the addition of s\u00e9 is self-apparent; and if we turn to any collated list of the pronouns of the Altaic tongues generally we shall immediately perceive the same anomalies prevailing throughout this group of languages, and affecting both the form and the application of all the particles; the \u00e1ng suffix, for instance, being at once a genitive and a dative sign in\n\nand kwar, hand, from \u03c7\u03b5\u03c1, and Klaproth's of Waran rain from \u03c9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3 and M\u00e1r\u00e9 from \u03c9\u03bb\u03b9\u03b3. I shall give numerous Tartar equivalents for all three and thus prove their roots to be respectively Ka, Wa and Ma, the ra, r\u00e9 and ran being serviles, or rather phases of one servile.\n\n* This remarkable and arbitrary feature of a dual and two plurals I have already detected in the Kuswar, Hayu and Kiranti tongues of the Him\u00e1inya and in the Ho, Soutal and Uraon tongues of Tamilian India, I need hardly add that the same peculiarity belongs to the Tagalan and Alforian languages, as well as the Altaic.\na single tongue (sangg\u00e9, of thee; mangg\u00e9, to me, in Ouig\u00far), and also changing its form entirely in the same case (maning, of me; sangg\u00e9, of thee) in that single tongue. Look again beyond the Altaic group and you will see the same anomalies. Every body had noticed them in this or that instance, and I have on this account myself demurred to the use of the pronouns at all as a test of ethnic affinity. I am now aware that I was misled by the authority of great names looking at these particles from a too grammatical point of view. We first make the particles grammatical and then we declare them to be utterly anomalous; the facts being, that they are not strictly or uniformly grammatical, generally speaking, nor perhaps anywhere so except as the result of Arian influences (Tibetan, Newarese, cultivated Tamulian, and so in Caucasus); and that they obey their own law with perfect uniformity, and equally so when they attach to pronouns as to nouns and to verbs. That they are not strictly grammatical may be shown as well by their inconsistency with any intelligible conception of grammar,* as by the harmonious and simple elucidation they admit of according to their own norma loquendi or mechanism of speech.\n\nLook, for instance, at the following explication of the Mantchu plurals above cited, or Mouse, Souw\u00e9 and T\u00e9s\u00e9t. Mou-s\u00e9, we, = I and Thou, thus, Mou is the Ma, Mi, Mo, root for I, obsolete as an ordinary nominative in this tongue, but found as such in most of the cognate series of tongues and forthcoming even in Mantchu in all the oblique cases (Mi-ni; Mi-ningg\u00e9; Mi-nd\u00e9), S\u00e9, again, is the s\u00e9, s\u00e9, s\u00ed, s\u00f3, root for Thou; still extant as si in this tongue, as s\u00e9 in Turki, as s\u00e1 in Ouigur, Finnic and Esthonian, not to cite more instances from my ample store. Therefore Mous\u00e9 is beyond dispute a compound of two roots meaning I and Thou. In like manner pre-\n\n* There should be, though there is not, a higher sort of grammar capable of reconciling Tartaric forms of speech with our own, that is, of showing the equivalency of each to the other. In the meanwhile the use of our technical terms in discussing the Tartar tongues is natural, almost inevitable; and at all events I beg earnestly to disclaim all purpose of censure whilst attempting to elucidate. There is much grammar in these tongues, but as I think borrowed and shown to be so, as well by reference to the much larger and unchanged portion of the languages as by the unharmonising character which the grammatical element wears when it exists.\ncisely is Sou-w\u00e9, ye, a compound of the root above cited for Thou, and of the O, U, root for He; which latter, though obsolete in Mantchu, is extant in Turki and in Onigur as O; in Magyar as O'\u00eb or w\u00e9; in Circassian as \u00fai or wi; in G\u00e1ro as \u00fai; in Dhimali, in Gy\u00e1rung and in Tunglhu, as w\u00e1; in Newari, as w\u00f3, &c. &c. Sou-w\u00e9 ye, is therefore palpably a compound of the roots expressing Thou and He; S\u00eb changing to Sou, as M\u00f3 to Mou, and O'\u00eb to w\u00e9; the \u00e9 moreover being a synonyme of \u00f3, and a phase of the \u00ed root, found alike in this very Mantchu tongue and in Circassian; so that the Magyar d\u00e9, Circassian \u00fai and Mantchu \u00ed, with other instances just cited, lead irresistibly to w\u00e9 = He in Mantchu. Therefore Souw\u00e9, ye, is literally Thou and He; as Mous\u00e9, w\u00e9 is literally I and Thou. In like manner the 3rd plural or they, T\u00e9s\u00e9t, is undoubtedly a compound of T\u00e9 = he, and S\u00e9 = Thou. The s\u00e9 root has the t\u00e1 particle added as a conjunct servile (s\u00e9-t,) according to a rule of universal operation in these tongues. T\u00e9 is extant in Mantchu in the sense of He. It has the r\u00e1 particle suffixed and harmonised in its vowel to the vowel of the root (t\u00e9-r\u00e9,) also according to an universal rule governing these particles; and S\u00e9, in the sense of Thou, is likewise extant, as S\u00ed in Mantchu, as S\u00e9 in Turki; as S\u00e1 in some one of its phases, in short, (S\u00e1, S\u00e9, S\u00ed, S\u00f3, S\u00e1) in 20 of these tongues. Therefore T\u00e9-s\u00e9-t, or They, is, literally, He and Thou; and the whole of the three plurals are constructed upon precisely the same principle thus:\n\nMou-s\u00e9, = we, = I and Thou.\nSou-w\u00e9, = ye, = Thou and He.\nT\u00e9-s\u00e9-t, = They, = He and Thou.\n\nIn like manner the Mongolian plurals Bi-d\u00e1, T\u00e1, and T\u00e9-d\u00e9-t, might be analysed by means of the Tibetan demonstratives D\u00ed and D\u00e9 with their analogues in allied tongues; and shown to be nothing more than reiterate pronouns of the singular number, and also that the D\u00e1 D\u00e9, is no more a plural sign than the third phase of this particle or Dou (D\u00e9, D\u00e9, Di, D\u00f3) is a dative sign though widely as erroneously so regarded (just as De Coros regards the equivalent ra,* particle), wit-\n\n* De Coros, pursuant to his view of the r\u00e1 particle, as a dative case sign, translates Namgar in one instance and another, to Heaven. Now, Nam is the Sun, and Kha vel g\u00e1 is place; and that the ra suffix only emphasises the sense of Kh\u00e1 vel G\u00e1 may be shown by a familiar pair of Examples. G\u00e1r vel G\u00e1ro and Takla-kh\u00e1r\nness T s\u00e9-do, to the earth, Ko-d\u00e1, to the foot, &c., in the Caucasian group, according to Vater. In truth, the D\u00e1 particle is in these latter instances a servile, not a radical, as is the s\u00e9 before given; but apparently neither radical nor servile can be regarded in strictness as a declensional sign, of case or of number. Nor in the great majority of these tongues from Caucasus to Oceanica do these or the other particles* ordinarily fulfil the necessary conditions of such a sign, with the scant and obvious exceptions before noted. The S\u00e1 radical and the d\u00e1 servile are both alike particles and as such subject to the laws regulating particles according to which all their alleged anomalies in either character can be explained, including not only every vocalic change, incident to them in both capacities alike, but also that substitution whereby they interchange functions and the root becomes a servile, or the servile, a root. Thus, for example, the s\u00e9 particle is undoubtedly a root in the instances cited above; and it is as undoubtedly a servile in the Magar tongue wherein I-s\u00e9 means this, and O-s\u00e9, that; \u00ed and \u00f3 being the near and remote demonstratives, with s\u00e9 as a servile affix, answering exactly to the Georgian S, in \u00ed-s, he. Compare Circassian \u00ed with Georgian \u00ed-s, and the servile and equivalent character of the Sa suffix in these instances drawn from the Magyar and Georgian tongues will be at once apparent, and it will be also perceived how the alleged plural sense is here neither admissible nor possible, though the particle be assuredly the identical one to which in the Mantchu tongue the plural quality is attributed.\n\nIn explaining the Mantchu pronouns I have included almost all that need be said of the Circassian 3rd personal singular, or \u00fa \u00ed, with its change to t' conjunct, as in t-ab, his father.\n\nIf we consider the \u00fa, the I, and the T, as all radicals, we may yet find numerous equivalents for each in that sense; and if, again, we regard the t' as a servile superseding the radical \u00fai, or wi, we may\n\nare the names of two well known places in Nari, G\u00e1r meaning the place or fort, or head-quarters of its district; and Takla-kh\u00e1r, the place, or fort, or Sadr, of Takla. Again the 13th divisions of the spire of a Chaitya are called Chuksum-kh\u00e1r in Tibetan, = trilyodas bhuvan in Sanscrit, i.e., the 13th mansion.\n\n* The ch\u00e1 suffix in Ma-ch, we, Ossetic, is called a plural sign. What is it in Sa-ch, earth? Probably what it is in A-ch, one, Circassian, viz., a servile with the usual differential function.\nfind abundant instances of such supersession alike among the Caucasian and the Mongolian tongues, as M\u00e1, Ma-fa, Fa, fire; B\u00ed, Di-bi, Di, skin; S\u00e1, B\u00e9-s\u00e1, B\u00e9, Cow; and many more for which I must refer to the forthcoming analysed list of vocables.\n\nWith regard to Mongolian equivalents for the radicals U', I' and Ta, in the sense of He, the 3rd personal, the subjoined enumeration must suffice at present.\n\nU', Circassian, = \u00fa in Garo; \u00fa in Sontal; O' (\u00f3\u00e9) in Magyar; O' in Ouigur and Turki; W\u00f3 in Newari; W\u00e1 in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, in Dhimali* and in Tunglu. I', Circassian, = I', in Mantchu; I' in Sontal; I', in Burmese, (this); E', in Magyar (O'\u00e9); E', in Kalmak; E', in Lazig; I'-a, in Georgian; I'-s\u00e9 in Magar; I'-tu in Tagalan. T\u00e1 Circassian, = T\u00e9, in Mongol; T\u00e9, in Mantchu; T\u00e1, in Esthonian; T\u00e1, in Chinese; Th\u00e1, in Gyami; Th\u00ed, in Gurung; Th\u00e9, in Murmi; Th\u00fa, in Burmese.\n\nIf, again, we take the Circassian \u00fa \u00ed as one root and word, we have parallels for it in the Magyar \u00f3\u00e9, similarly taken, and in all the w\u00e1 roots should we read wi, (w for \u00fa).\n\nWith regard to the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang wa t\u00fa, which I have compared with the Circassian \u00fa \u00ed changing in composition to t\u00e9, it is very important to observe that if wa t\u00fa and \u00fa \u00ed be considered as compounds of two synonymous roots, according to the above detailed exposition of\n\n* The perfect agreement of the Circassian and Dhimali in regard to the singular of the 3rd personal, \u00fa being he, in both tongues, renders the proximate agreement of the perplexing plural, \u00fa-bert and \u00fa-bal, very interesting. I have tried the analysis in several ways but have not succeeded to my own satisfaction: but I submit the following.\n\nU'-ba-rt = they = he and he; one he being the \u00fa above elucidated, and the other, a synonymous b\u00e9, b\u00e9, b\u00ed, root such as B\u00ed actually is in Bodo: rt, servile; the ra and ta suffixes conjunct.\n\nU'-ba-l = they = he and he, as before. The juxtaposition of the Bodo and Dhimal tribes renders the adoption of the B\u00ed root from Bodo likely in this instance.\n\nIt is however a word and root widely diffused and used as a noun and pronoun also. Final l', servile. \u2014\u2014\u2014 The Suanic Al, he; and the Ouig\u00far and Turki Ol, he and Ol-ar, they, are very suggestive, as also the Turkish and Ouigur B\u00ed, and the Sokpo B\u00e1 in Ab\u00fa, with all the numerous words for man having the B\u00ed root, as B\u00ed-shi, juvenis, alike in Turki and in Bodo. Nominal and pronominal roots are so apt to coincide that I have a long list of coincident roots for Ego = Homo: for instance the Mi root, and Ta root and Sa root, and Ba root.\nroots, then that such reiterated pronouns are completely conformable to the genius of these tongues, and as such harmonise perfectly with the preceding exposition of the plurals. These tongues in fact revel in cumulation pronominal and nominal, varying as to the exact applications of the emphasized or reiterated pronouns,* but preserving a general overruling similitude, of which the following instance from a Himalayan and a Caucasian tongue is too singular to be omitted. In Georgian the \u00ed root for the 3rd personal singular, or he, becomes by such accretion, gradually augmenting, first \u00ed-s, and then, \u00ed-ti-na; and in Magar the same root with the same sense (ille iste) becomes \u00ed-s\u00e9 and \u00ed-s\u00e9-na, according as more or less of emphasis and discrimination is needed. Again, the Georgian ti, in iti na, is the Burmese th\u00e9, in I-thi, a word compounded of two synonymes, both meaning this (ille), and conjointly equivalent precisely to is\u00e9n\u00e1 as well as itina in Magar and Georgian respectively. Th\u00fa, again, means he, the 3rd personal, in Burmese, and this word, which is merely another phase of the th\u00e9 particle (th\u00e9, th\u00e9, th\u00e9, th\u00e9\u2014which last signifies that, and is Tibetan)\u2014brings us back to the Tagalan \u00ed-t\u00fa and the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng wa-t\u00fa every particle, whether used in a primary or secondary sense, taking the aspirate indifferently (M\u00e9, Mh\u00e9, fire; Ni, Nhi, day; k\u00e1, kh\u00e1, sky; et c\u00e6t., ad libitum).\n\nNow, if we look again at the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng wa-t\u00fa through the medium of the Malayan and Tagalan \u00ed-t\u00fa and the Circassian r\u00ed \u00ed and t\u00e9,\u2014all but the last equally involving a double pronominal root and single sense\u2014we shall see in this identical composition and identical idiomatic use of the 3rd personal pronoun, illustrated on all sides as they are by Altaic, Himalayan and Indo-Chinese equivalents reproducing every form and phase of the roots, a marvellous proof of the affinity of all the tongues. But this is not all, for the Circassian \u00fa and I commutable to T derives the highest and complete illustration from another and most interesting quarter, to wit the uncultivated Tamulian tongues of India amongst which the Sontal exhibits both \u00fa and I for the third personal pronoun as well as their com-\n\n* See Mith. voce Turki, I. 467 et seq. and Essay on Koch, Bodo and Dhimal, p. 120, and De Coros' Grammar, p. 65, Crawfurd's Malayan Grammar, Phillips's Sontal Grammar, and Brown's Asam Grammar.\nmutation into T* whilst the Gondi has \u00fa (w) similarly commutable. For the proof of these most remarkable co-incidences I refer the student to the works of Phillips and Driberg, merely observing in conclusion that it is but a sample of those analogies derivable from the same interesting quarter which I have already made good progress in the development of, and which when fully exhibited will go far to confirm the conviction that the Tartaric family is one and indivisible from the Caucasus to the Pacific.\n\nThe prospect of a reunion of all the Tartars suggests the consideration of a fitting designation for the whole; and, whatever my leaning towards the term Scythian\u2020 from veneration for the father of history who first introduced this mighty herd to our view, I prefer upon the whole the more familiar appellation Tartar, 1st, because it has a sense as ample as our present requirement, in which respect it has no advantage over Scythian\u20142nd, because it has an etymological significance thoroughly indigenous and in the highest degree appropriate, as well with reference to the structure of those tongues by the dissection of which we have come at a knowledge of the whole scope of Tartar affinities, as with regard to that characteristic idiom according to which the name of a tribe is the name of our species. T\u00e1 means man in a score of extant tongues; and T\u00e1 designates numerous extant tribes stretching from the Altai to the gulf of Siam, whilst the same or equivalent names prevail throughout the Mongolian countries and in Caucasus;\u2021 and, lastly, the reiteration whereby\n\n* The transposableness of the particles in these tongues has been already stated, and abundantly proved. With this hint look at the following wonderful sample of analogous structure, t-ab, his father, in Circassian; apa-t, his father, in Sontal. It is needless almost to add that the word for father is ab in the former tongue; apa in the latter. Not one of Bopp\u2019s celebrated Arian affinities surpasses the above in beauty and interest.\n\n\u2020 Essay on Koch, Bodo and Dhimal, Preface, pages 8\u20149, where the reader may see that seven years ago I had a strong presentiment of what I now hope to demonstrate.\n\n\u2021 Ta-h\u00e9-ri, Ta-h\u00e9-teh\u00e9-nah, &c. come from the t\u00e1 and s\u00e1 roots for man, and are seen in similar combination, being synonymes, in the Chinese and Georgian Ts\u00e9 meaning man, whereof Ts\u00e9-s, is a diminutive. The Chinese call the Tartars indifferently Th\u00e1-th\u00e1 and Th\u00e1-ts\u00e9, and so do the Newars of Nepal, whilst Ta-i, Ta-i-m\u00f3, Ta-i-l\u00fang, Ta-i-n\u00e9, Ta-i-y\u00e9, names of tribes from Assam to the Ocean, are\nthe T\u00e1, or Zenghis' clansmen, came to be called T\u00e1-t\u00e1, vel Th\u00e1-th\u00e1, (men pre-eminently, quasi Allemanni) is a normal sample of one of the chief constructive principles of these tongues. Wherefore I would abide by that medieval designation by which all the races beyond the confines of Europe have been known to Europe in modern times, and which from and after the middle ages superseded the classical term Scythian\u2014a term of as wide import as the other and so far equally fitting, but now laid aside, and never so etymologically just as Tartar, the very r of which word, though carped at by half-informed critics, is in fact thoroughly in accordance with the jus et norma of Tartaric speech, everywhere from Oceanic to the Caucasian region.\n\nall not only T\u00e1 but T\u00e1-t\u00e1, since the second syllable is in all a synonyme, and therefore as equivalent as Tsh\u00e9-tsh\u00e9 and T\u00e1-t\u00e1 which are reiterations. As instances, familiar to us in India, of a tribe-name signifying also man in the language of that tribe, I may mention, A-nam, Mra, K lun, Ka-mi, Ku-mi, Kong, Lau, M\u00f3-n, Mo-i, Bar-ma. These are simple. Mi-shi-mi, M\u00fa-r-mi, &c. are compound. Occasionally, as in Burmese, the root may be obsolete in the human sense; but it will always be found in its derivatives or in the proximate tongues, leaving the principle of gentile nomenclature indisputable. In Miishimi we have the Mi and Shi roots for man, the former, reiterated. In M\u00farmi we have the Mi root reiterated in different phases (M\u00f3 and Mf). In Burma, we have a third phase of the same root (m\u00e1) with the B\u00e1 root and synonyme preceding it; and lest this etymology should startle my readers, I will add that this very word Barma means man in the Magar tongue, that is, in one of those Him\u00e1layan tongues whose close affinity to the Burmese language I have lately shown.\nOn a Geometrical Measurement of the distances from Crest to Crest of the Barometric Waves in a Cyclone.\u2014By Henry Piddington, President of Marine Courts.\n\nThe measurement of the pressure of the Barometric Column, whether arising from changes in its density or from actual variations in its height; such as the fish at the bottom of the sea must experience by the effect of every wave which rolls over them; we have possessed since the days of Torricelli and Pascal, and though, from our ignorance of the definite extent of the atmosphere and other causes, we can only express that pressure or vertical height by a conventional scale, which expression again though depending always on one fact, is different with different nations, we may still be said to have a measure, though an imperfect one, of the height of the atmospheric waves: assuming as we always do in using a Barometric measurement that we know and allow for all the causes which influence their density.\n\nThat these variations in the Barometric pressure also succeeded each other in the form of waves, at greater or less intervals of time, so as to be traced over large areas, has of late years been well known, and the attention of Meteorologists has been much directed to this research, of which an illustrious professor of science has justly said\u2014\u201cthe great extent of country over which the accidental variations of the Barometer take place is one of their most striking features, and in a future and more advanced state of Meteorology, we may be able to draw the most interesting and important conclusions from the great atmospheric tidal waves which are thus perpetually traversing oceans and continents.\u201d\n\nWe also knew generally, and from undoubted authority, that the Barometer both on the approach of, and during, Cyclones was subject to very remarkable oscillations, but hitherto we have had no Barometric measurements of their height, and though from their succession in time we of course inferred that their crests were at a certain dis-\n\n* Professor Forbes' Report on Meteorology to British Association in 1832.\ndistance from each other in space, we had no sort of index as to what that distance might be. In the present paper I have, as will be seen from its title, the pleasure to announce an instance in which, by the aid of Cyclonology, the Barometric waves of a Cyclone during its passage have been, I think, accurately measured, both vertically by the Barometer scale, and horizontally in geographical miles, giving us thus, as in the beautiful instance of the Charles Heddle's Cyclone, a new insight into the internal economy of these wonderful and fearful phenomena, and, I hope for Meteorologists in general, a stepping stone of which we can only at present anticipate the advantage from its position and the authenticity of its data.\n\nAfter a Cyclone from the 2nd to the 5th of May 1851, which raged principally between Trincomalee and Madras, extending to about 85\u00b0 East Longitude\u2014and which I have named \"The Fox's Cyclone\" from H. M. S. Fox having made very bad weather by getting too close in towards the centre before she bore up\u2014I received from my friend Capt. Chas. Biden, Master Attendant at Madras, amongst a large collection of logs and other data some ten-minute readings of the Barometer at the Madras Observatory. This was what I had been long looking and hoping for from some quarter, knowing, as I did, to what it might lead us if a complete short series of Barometric observations in the track or neighbourhood of a Cyclone could be obtained, together with the necessary data for an accurate track of the Cyclone itself; and having written to Captain Biden on the subject, the Hon. Co.'s Astronomer, W. S. Jacobs, Esq. was good enough to furnish me with a complete table of his ten-minute readings extending from 8h. 41' A.M. on the 2nd May, to 11h. 41' on the 5th; and from these, combined with the track of the Cyclone which I was fortunately enable to trace very accurately, having no less than twenty-six logs and reports. (See Journal Vol. XXI. p. 283,) the accompanying Diagram which, it will be seen, shows both the vertical height on the Barometric scale, and the horizontal distance in miles and tenths from Crest to Crest of the Barometric waves in the Cyclone, has been constructed.\n\nTo understand the plate it will be necessary to observe\u2014\n\n1. That, as shewn in the Diagram A. which is from the Chart to the Memoir on this Cyclone, above quoted, omitting\nonly the ship's tracks, the Cyclone has been accurately tracked for the day between Noon of the 3rd and Noon of the 4th May, and to 8 A.M. of the 5th May, when its centre must have reached the shore about 80 miles to the Northward of Madras. We have unfortunately no inland reports beyond that point, so as to enable us to trace accurately the exact passage of the centre, and we have thus to assume that its course and rate of travelling were the same inland as they had been at sea, which I have done in this case\u2014though there is usually some diminution of the rate of travelling on shore\u2014from comparing the veering of the wind, and the rise of the Barometer with its previous fall.\n\n2. That from the known extent of the Cyclone, as well as by the indications of the Barometer and Anemometer, the true wind-circles of the Cyclone do not appear to have reached Madras before 4h. 11' P.M. of the 4th, from which time the readings are projected on the Diagram C. The greatest depression of the Barometer was 29.816 occurring at 5h. 36' A.M. of the 5th May, when the centre of the Cyclone bore about No. 21\u00b0 30' West, distant 47 miles from the Madras Observatory.\n\n3. The course of the Cyclone at sea being accurately known, and consequently the distances of its centre from Madras at any given time, those distances are noted in Diagram C. at the different hours at which the various waves passed the Observatory. These distances are also marked on Diagram B. which is a Plane Chart enlarged from A. A is a copy of the Mercator's Chart to the Memoir on this Cyclone in which the ships tracks are omitted.\n\n4. As the Cyclone did not advance directly towards Madras but passed to the N. East of it, each of the successive undulations shewn by the projection must have passed the Zenith of the Observatory at a different angle; so that the simple distance from Crest to Crest as shown by the advancing centre of the Cyclone would not be a direct transverse measurement at right angles to their course, but one more or less diagonal. The correction for this, which varies, as the sines of the angles, has been duly calculated, and the distances in the column of corrected distances are the true transverse ones.\n\n5. A very steep wave will be remarked at e\u2014f (or 8 P.M. of the 4th May). This seems exactly analogous to the steep, and sudden\nroller-like sea waves which I have noticed at p. 360 of my Horn Book as the resultant wave of an advancing or passing Cyclone.*\n\n6. The centre of the Cyclone at Noon on the 4th May bore S. 70\u00b0 East, 102 miles from Madras, and its course and distance to 3 A. M. of the 5th, or for 15 hours when it bore North of Madras was No. 55\u00b0 West 114 miles, and the various distances given in the Table No. II. are those measured on the Plane Chart on which the positions of the centre at the times of the passage of the Crests of the waves are laid down. The distances from crest to crest of the undulations, and those from the flag-staff of Madras are the actual ones as measured at each successive interval on the Plane Chart, and for each of these again the correction above indicated has been calculated and applied.\n\n7. The Cyclone was coming up from the S. E. b. E. or from the right to the left of the page, but the hours are naturally read from left to right. It will not then be forgotten that, according to the direction of the arrows, a is the advancing front of the Cyclone, and that the whole passage here shown is that of 19 hours 50 minutes or from 4.11 P. M. of the 4th to 24h. 1' of the 4th\u20145th May.\n\n8. But of this it should be borne in mind that we have really but 10h. 10' of actual measurement of the Cyclone's track at sea, and that we have assumed its inland course and rate to have been the same, as above stated.\n\n9. The Diagram D represents a Bird's-eye view of the whole of the undulations of the Cyclone, as we may conceive them, or waves analogous to them, to have existed at the time when the first of them a reached Madras, or when the centre passed the Meridian of that place. The regularity on the van or advancing portion of the Cyclone with the exception of g and h, and the grouping of the waves by twos and threes, as they felt the effect of the land (the Pulicat hills) are very remarkable.\n\n10. The mean result of the whole of the measurements is as follows, i.e. that\u2014\n\nThe mean Time of Transition of each wave is 1h. 7'.\n\n* Our analogies must necessarily be drawn from what we know of the motions of waves in fluids, since we have assumed that the Barometric variations are waves of some kind. Of what medium we know not.\nThe mean distance in geographical miles from crest to crest of each wave is 5.91 miles.\n\nBut if we take only the means of the ten hours and ten minutes for which we have the actual track measured at sea, the means will then stand as follows:\n\nMean time of Transition of each wave 1h. 1'.\n\nMean distance from crest to crest of each wave 4.62 miles.\n\nWe may thus for the present say that\u2014\n\n1. In a Cyclone of average violence (for this was by no means an excessively violent one) travelling at the rate of 182.4 miles in 24h., or 7.6 miles per hour, there is a succession of aerial undulations affecting the Barometer to the average extent of 0.020 per hour of pressure, these being + or \u2014 according to the position of the centre, and the curve of the undulation as shewn in the Diagram.\n\n2. That these variations of pressure occur at average intervals of 1h. 4', and that their crests are at a horizontal distance of about 5 miles from each other; the greatest horizontal distance being at 14.97 miles, and at the centre of the Cyclone, and the least at 1'.07 miles.\n\nAs an Appendix to this paper, and because, however carefully the original drawings are made, we cannot in India have them accurately lithographed, and the unequal stretching and drying of the paper again always deranges the most exact work in the printing.

President, in the chair.\n\nThe proceedings of the December meeting having been read and confirmed, the Secretary read the following Report.\n\nREPORT.\n\nIn laying on the table the accounts for the past year, the Council have the pleasure to call attention to the generally improving character of the state of the Society's affairs.\n\nThe Annual Report for 1851 held out the prospect of the Society's finances being re-established on a healthy footing in the course of the year just elapsed, and this prospect has been quite realized, as the accounts now on the table will show.\n\nThe Society has lost 2 members by death and 4 by withdrawal during the year. Mr. W. Mackintosh died in England, and the loss of Mr. H. W. Torrens in August last was the occasion of a resolution which will be fresh in the recollection of all present.\n\nThe list moreover of Honorary Members has lost the name of a distinguished scholar, that of Eug\u00e8ne Burnouf.\n\nThe accessions during the year have however been more numerous than the losses, 10 new members have been elected, so that the Society now numbers 139 members, of whom 17 only are absent from India.\n\nThe gross Receipts and Disbursements of the Society in the course of the year were as follows:\u2014\n### Receipts\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Contributions                                    | 6,764 12 0 |\n| Library including Society's                      |          |\n| Oriental and other publications                  | 1,652 11 0 |\n| Journal                                          | 1,074 4 0 |\n| Museum including Government Grants               | 7,369 1 0 |\n| Building                                         | 0 0 0    |\n| Secretary's Office                               | 2 1 0    |\n| Deposits                                         | 180 0 0  |\n| Miscellaneous                                    | 84 5 6   |\n| **Total**                                        | 17,027 2 6 |\n\nBalance of 1851: 3,481 9 1\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| In hands of London Agent                         | 20,508 11 7 |\n| \u00a3101-8 or at 2s.                                 | 1,017 18 4 |\n| **Total**                                        | 21,526 8 11 |\n\n### Disbursements\n\n| Description                                      | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Cash in hand including bal. in London Agent's hand.| 8,538 14 7 |\n| Ineff.

It is believed, however, that not more than Rs. 4,500 of this sum will have to be given up; a very large proportion consists of current contributions which are certain of realization during the next quarter.\n\nThe liabilities amount only to Rs. 8,384-1-10. This estimate provides for the payment of Book-sellers and Printer's Bills, and every contingent charge for the year which may yet be due. The amount, it will be seen, falls short of the Cash balance now in hand.\n\nThe Council think therefore there is room to congratulate the Society on its having recovered altogether from the remaining embarrassments which were noticed in the Annual Report for 1851.\nThe average monthly expenditure of the past year has exceeded the average monthly income by 62 Rs. being 868 Rs. against 806 Rs., but the detailed accounts will show that the whole cost of printing\n\nA. say 1400 out of the 7 Nos. of the Journal for 1851, (A.) the balance of the printer's bill for Mr. Blyth's Bird Catalogue, (B.) and the removal from the list of the Society's liabilities of heavy items (C.) due to the late Mr. Torrens and other members, are among the charges; deducting the aggregate of these as by marginal Memo. the legitimate charges of the year will not exhibit a higher monthly average than 578 Rs.\n\nThe Council think that the following may be taken as a fair estimate of the probable income and expenditure of the ensuing year.\n\n**Income.**\n\nContributions from 118 resident Members, ............. 7,552 0 0\nGovernment Grants, ........................................... 7,368 0 0\nJournal, 80 Subscribers and Miscellaneous sale, ...... 1,100 0 0\nLibrary and Sale of Society's publications, ............ 1,600 0 0\n\n16,620 0 0\n\n**Expenditure.**\n\nGeneral Establishment including Secretary's Office,... 1,470 0 0\nMuseum Establishment and Contingencies, ............ 7,920 0 0\nJournal, say 8 Nos., ........................................ 1,700 0 0\nLibrary, ...................................................... 2,286 0 0\nMiscellaneous, including Building, &c. .................. 1,200 0 0\n\n14,526 0 0\n\nThe income from the Sale of Oriental publications is here perhaps under-rated. The gradual improvement of this branch of the Society's resources will be best seen from the following memo.\n\nSales in 1843 .............................................. 696 8 0\n\" 1844 ...................................................... 224 4 9\n\" 1845 ...................................................... 1,047 7 3\n\" 1846 ...................................................... 777 7 3\n\" 1847 ...................................................... 917 8 0\nIt should be remembered that the Stock on hand from which these supplies are derived is considerable, being valued at Rs. 17,242, exclusive of the Stock of Bibliotheca Indica, which may at its present selling price be estimated at Rs. 14,469.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe number of books added to the Library during the year 1852, amounts to 219 volumes. Of these 43 volumes, including Johnston's Physical Atlas, Layard's Remains of Nineveh, Fergusson's Illustrations of Indian Architecture, Ghasaley's Ohia ul Alum (MS.) and several other valuable works have been purchased at a cost of nearly 800 Rs., the remaining 176 volumes are donations from authors and learned Societies, and include works also of considerable value.\n\nA new Catalogue of the Library is nearly ready, and will, it is believed, be sent to the press by the middle of February next.\n\nThe estimate of the current year's expenditure above given provides for additional purchases of books to the amount of Rs. 1000.\n\nMuseum.\n\nSeveral valuable additions have been made to this Department during the year now closing.\n\nThe coin cabinet has been re-arranged, many of the silver and gold coins having been accurately labelled during the short stay in Calcutta of Mr. E. Thomas, who kindly offered his assistance. A classified catalogue of the coins is in progress and will be, it is hoped, soon completed.\n\nThe Council have again to record their satisfaction with the two Curators and with the Librarian, whose best attention has throughout been given to their respective Departments.\n\nSecretary's Office.\n\nThe arrears of accounts and other business in this Department have been brought up by means of extra assistance.\nOriental Fund.\n\nThe Bibliotheca Indica has received an accession of eight new numbers. Six of these contain Sanscrit texts and Translations (1), and of the remaining two Numbers, one is in Arabic (2) and the other Persian (3). It was proposed also to print the History of Animals by Damyry, but though six copies of the work had been obtained from various quarters, it was found on comparing them and correcting the text that none was sufficiently correct to enable the editor to proceed with the labour.\n\nThe prospect of the Bibliotheca for this year are encouraging. Two new contributors, Dr. Ballantyne and Mr. Hall of Benares, are engaged in editing, for this work, the S\u0101\u1e45khya Pravachana Bh\u0101shya, and their recent proposal to edit the Sutras of all the six Dar\u015banas is now under consideration.\n\nIn addition to the books of which parts have been printed, a new work of great importance would have been commenced two months ago, had not the Printer's hands been already fully occupied; this work is an Arabic Dictionary of the technical terms used in various sciences.

H. Hodgson, Esq.\n\nI now submit to the Society my promised Sif\u00e1n and H\u00f3rs\u00f3k vocabularies with such geographic illustrations as may tend to render them more easily and fully appreciable. I intended to have retained these vocabularies till I had completed my pending investigation of the grammar of the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang and H\u00f3rpa tongues. But the high interest attaching to the discovery of another surprising instance of the wide-spreading relations of these tongues, made in the course of that investigation, and which discovery is sufficiently verifiable even by the vocabularies, though by no means limited to their evidence, together with the bearings of these vocabularies upon my two last communications to the Society, induces me not to postpone the sending of them. I can follow them up, by and bye, by the proposed grammatical elucidations. In the meanwhile there is abundant matter for the present communication in such a statement as I now propose giving of the present discovery, in some general remarks on the characteristics of the vast group of tongues to which the vocabularies now and priorly submitted belong, and in some descriptions of the physical attributes of the almost unknown races more immediately now in question. Nor do I apprehend that the want of the grammatical details adverted to will materially impair the interest of the present communication, since I have anticipated so much on that\nhead in the way of practical exposition by samples as to make the special discovery I announce perfectly appreciable without those details, which, moreover speaking generally of this vast group of tongues, I have shown reasons for deeming less important than they are wont to be held both philologically and ethnologically.\n\nThis series of vocabularies is entirely my own work in a region equally interesting and untrodden. It consists of seven languages, viz. the Th\u00f3ch\u00fa, the Sokpa, the Gy\u00e1mi, the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng, the H\u00f3rpa, the Takpa and the Manyak; and so novel is a deal of the matter that it will be necessary to explain at once what these terms mean, and to show where the races of men are to be found speaking these tongues. H\u00f3rs\u00f3k is a compound Tibetan word by which the people of Tibet designate the Nomades who occupy the whole northern part of their country, or that lying beyond the Nyenchhen-th\u00e1ngl\u00e1* range of mountains, and between it and the Kwanleun or Kuenl\u00fan chain. H\u00f3rs\u00f3k designates the two distinct races of the H\u00f3r or H\u00f3rpa and the S\u00f3k or S\u00f3kpa, neither of whom, so far as I have means to learn, is led by the possession of a native name at once familiar and general, to eschew the Tibetan appellations as foreign; though it will soon be seen that they are really so, if our identifications fail not. The H\u00f3rpa occupy the western half of the region above defined, or northern Tibet; and also a deal of Little Bucharia and of Songaria, where they are denominated Kao-ts\u00e9 by the Chinese, and Igh\u00fara (as would seem) by themselves.\n\nThe Sokpa occupy the eastern half of northern Tibet as above defined, and also, the wide adjacent country usually called Khokhon\u00far and Tang\u00fat by Europeans, but by the Tibetans, Sokyeul or Sok-land.\n\n* This important feature of the geography of Tibet is indicated by the Nian-tsin tangla of Ritter's Hoch Asien and by the Tanla of Huc. I have, following native authority, used in a wide sense a name which those writers use in a contracted sense; and reasonably, because the extension, continuity and height of the chain are indubitable. Nevertheless Ritter and Guyon have no warrant for cutting off from Tibet the country beyond it up to the Kuenl\u00fan, nor are Katch\u00e9 and Kh\u00f3r, the names they give to the country beyond, admissible or recognised geographic terms, Kh\u00f3r, equal H\u00f3r, is purely ethnic, and Katch\u00e9 is a corruption of Kh\u00e1ch\u00e9 or Mahomedan, literally, big-mouth.\nIn southern Tibet, or Tibet south of the Nyenchhen-thangla chain, there are numerous scattered H\u00f3rpas and S\u00f3kpas, as there are many scattered Bodpas in northern Tibet; but, in general, that great mountain chain, the worthy rival of the Him\u00e1laya and the Kuenl\u00fcn, may be said to divide the nomadic H\u00f3rpas and S\u00f3kpas from the non-nomadic Bodpas or Tibetans proper. Though the major part be Buddhists, yet are there some followers of Islam among the H\u00f3rpas and S\u00f3kpas of Tibet; more beyond the Tibetan limits. They are all styled Kh\u00e1chh\u00e9 by the Tibetans, of which word I think the Chinese Kao-tse is a mere corruption, despite Cunningham's ingenious interpretation of Kao-tse.\n\nThe Islamites are also called Godkar, of which term again Klapproth's Th\u00f3gar seems to be a metamorphosis.\n\nBetween the H\u00f3rpas and S\u00f3kpa in the central part of northern Tibet, are the Dr\u00f3kpa* vel Br\u00f3gpa, whose vocables I have as yet failed to obtain; and also, numerous \"Kazz\u00e1k\" or mounted robber bands, styled by the Tibetans Chakpa vel Jagpa, who recruit their formidable association from any of the neighbouring races, but especially from the Bodpa (Tibetans proper), the H\u00f3rpas, the S\u00f3kpa and the Dr\u00f3kpa. The language of the Chakpa is the ordinary Tibetan, and therefore, and because also of their very mixed lineage, they are of little ethnic importance though always cited by the Tibetans, with fear and trembling, as a separate element of their population. The predatory habits of the Chakpa often carry them beyond their own limits, and they and the erratic Dr\u00f3kpa are often seen in N\u00e1ri where Gerrard and Cunningham speak of them under the designations of Dzakpa and of D\u00f3kpa. I doubt the ethnic independance of both, and believe them to be mixed associations, composed of people of the above specified races, from among which the H\u00f3rpas or Turks contribute an element even to the Him\u00e1layan population of Kan\u00e1wer, as is proved by the infinitives in \"mak\" of the Taburskad tongue.\n\nFrom Khokhon\u00far to Y\u00fan\u00e1n the conterminous frontier of China and Tibet is successively and continuously occupied (going from north to south) by the S\u00f3kpa above spoken of, by the Amd\u00f3ans who for the most part now speak Tibetan, by the Th\u00f3ch\u00fa, by the Gy\u00e1-\n\n* Quite distinct from the D\u00f3kpa vel Br\u00fakpa of Bh\u00fat\u00e1n. The 'vel' indicates the distinction of the written from the spoken words.\nr\u00fang, and by the Manyak, whose vocabularies are all subjoined; whilst returning back westward, along the pente septentrionale of the Him\u00e1laya we have, after passing through the Kham districts of Chy\u00e1r\u00fang and Kwombo, the region of the Takpas, or Takyeul, styled* Dakpo by Ritter, who however places it East of Kwombo, whereas it lies west of that district, written Combo by him. The Brahmap\u00fatra or Y\u00e1r\u00fa quits Tibet in the district of Kwombo, as he states.\n\nTakpa, the Towang R\u00e9j of the English, is a dependency of Lh\u00e1sa. Its civil administrator is the Ch\u00f3nsj\u00fang peun; its ecclesiastic head, the T\u00e1mba Lama, whence our Towang.\n\nThe peoples of Sok-yeul, of Amdo, of Thoch\u00fa, of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, and of Manyak, who are under chiefs of their own, styled Gy\u00e1bo or King, Sinic\u00e9 Wang, bear among the Chinese the common designation of Si-fan or Western aliens; and the Tibetans frequently denominate the whole of them Gy\u00e1r\u00fangbo from the superior importance of the special tribe of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang, which reckons eighteen chiefs or banners of power sufficient, in days of yore, often to have successfully resisted or assailed the celestial empire, though for some time past quietly submitting to a mere nominal dependancy on China. The word Gy\u00e1 in the language of Tibet, is equivalent to that of Fan (alienus,\u2020 barbares) in the language of China; and, as r\u00fang means in the former tongue, proper or special, Gy\u00e1r\u00fang signifies alien par excellence, a name of peculiar usefulness in designating the whole of these Eastern borderers, in order to discriminate them from the affined and approximate, but, yet distinct, Bodpa of Kham. Others affirm that Gy\u00e1r\u00fang means wild, rude, primitive Gy\u00e1s, making r\u00fang the same as t\u00e1ng in Myamma; and that the typical Gy\u00e1s (Gy\u00e1mi) are the\n\n* I should add that Ritter's Gakpo and Gangpo, and Dakpo are not three separate places, but merely various utterances of the single word Takpa, and no more admissible therefore than his Katch\u00e9 and Khor before explained. This great geographer is rather too prone to give a \"local habitation\" to the airy nothings of this polyglottic region, as I have formerly had occasion to point out, though no one can more admire than I do his immense learning and the talent that guides and animates it.\n\n\u2020 Hence Gy\u00e1 philing, or Frankish stranger. European foreigner is the name for Europeans in Tibet. Philing=Frank, indic\u00e9 Feringi; not as interpreted by M. Huc.\nChinese, though the latter be usually designated specially black Gy\u00e1s (Gy\u00e1-nak).\n\nThe Gy\u00e1r\u00fangs themselves have no general name for their country or people, a very common case. When I submit the interesting itinerary I possess of a journey from Kathmand\u00fa to Pekin, I shall more particularly notice the topography of Sif\u00e1n. At present it will be sufficient to add that this country, which extends from the Blue Sea to Y\u00fan\u00e1n, with a very unequal width varying from several days' march to only two or three, forms a rugged mountainous declivity from the lofty plateau of Kham to the low plain of Sechuen, and which is assimilated by those who well know both, to the Indian declivity of the Him\u00e1laya, the mountains being for the most part free of snow and the climate much more temperate than that of Tibet. Within this mountainous belt or barrier of Sif\u00e1n, are the Takpa, who are consequently Tibetans: without it are the Gy\u00e1mi who are consequently Chinese, as will be seen by their respective vocabularies\u2014vocabularies, not the less valuable for being dialects merely, (if no more) of languages well known, because the dialectic differences of the Chinese and the Tibetan tongues are little understood,* at the same time that they are very important for enabling us to test the alleged distinctness of the great groups of people nearest allied to these divisions.\n\nFor my part I apprehend that the true characteristics of the Chinese and Tibetan languages have been a good deal obscured by book-men,\u2020 Native and European; and, though it be somewhat pre-\n\n* Leyden reckoned ten Chinese tongues (As. Research. X. 266). Others hold that there is but one. Again Remusat (Recher. sur les lang. Tartares) insisted that there must be several tongues in Tibet, whereas DeCoros (Jour. No. 4,) considers that there is but one. This comes in part of the want of a standard of ethnic unity, whether lingual or physical, and in part of the mixture of distinct races by regarding them under a large geographic and political unity, thus the Horok belong undoubtedly to Tibet, but do not belong to the Bodpa race. I have given, I believe, all the languages of Tibet, that is, the languages of all the races now and long settled in Tibet. My Gy\u00e1mi vocables exhibit a vast difference from the Kong one of Leyden, ut supra. But I do not rely on mine, nor have I means to test it.\n\n\u2020 A deal of DeCoros' abundant grammatical apparatus of the Tibetan tongue is positively repudiated by the people of Tibet, whilst the learned and sage Remusat\nmature to venture an opinion before I have completed my pending investigation of the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang and H\u00f3rp\u00e1 tongues, I still must say that I suspect few competent judges will rise from the attentive study of this and my two prior series of vocabularies without feeling a conviction that the Indo-Chinese, the Chinese, the Tibetans, and the Altaians have been too broadly contradistinguished and that they form in fact but one great ethnic family, which moreover includes what is usually called the Tamulian element of Indian population as well as nearly every element of the population of Oceanica.*\n\nMy former vocabularies showed how intimately the Indo-Chinese tongues are allied with the Him\u00e1layan and Tibetan by identity of roots, of servile particles, and even of entire words as the integral results of the combination of the two former, provided only that the comparison be drawn from a field large enough to exhibit the necessary range of admitted mutation both in the primary and secondary parts of words in use for ages among widely sundered and often also extremely segregated races. How large that range of admitted mutation is, I have illustrated by examples in the note appended to the present series of vocabularies, and I recommend those who would properly appreciate the great apparent deviations from a type of language which is, as I suppose, one and the same, to take good heed of what is there instanced. In the meanwhile without fatiguing the reader with more analyses at present, I proceed to remark\n\nteaches us to question the over-strained and unintelligible assertions about the monosyllabism of the Chinese tongue, as if there were no dissyllables, no adjuncts to the roots! and as if the roots of Sanscrit, Hebrew and Arabic were not monosyllables. For some valuable remarks on monosyllabism, see Recherches sur les langues Tartares, I. 351-4, and compare what occurs in the sequel as to the monosyllabic polysyllabism (different aspects of the case) of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang and Tagala. Thus in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang the root zo becomes Masazangti by mere cumulation of particles, ma, sa, ng, and ti.\n\n* The elder oceanic element or Alforian,=our Tamulian and the analogous dispersed and subdued tribes of Indo-China and China; the younger oceanic element or Malayo-polynesian,=the now dominant tribes of Indo-China, China, Tibet, and Him\u00e1lya. I must content myself at present with pointing to the special illustration of the latter part of this reunion of the continental and insular races in the sequel, though every proof of the wide common domain of the continentals is also an illustration, inferential yet clear, of both parts of it.\nthat the analogies and affinities indicated by the last series of vocabularies between the Himalayan and Tibetan tongues on one hand and the Indo-Chinese on the other, are carried on and confirmed by some of the present series, whilst others extend the links to the Altaic group of languages; the Gy\u00e1rung, Takpa, and Manyak carrying the chain of connexion onwards from the South-east, and the Th\u00e9ch\u00fa, H\u00f3rpa, and S\u00f3kpa, transmitting it over the Kwanleun to the North and West; the Gy\u00e1rung by its grammatical structure exhibiting also marvellous correspondencies with remoter regions; with Caucasus, as has been separately shown already, and with Oceanica, as will appear in the sequel of this communication. How far precisely the other languages now submitted may participate these express and peculiar features of grammatical affinity I am not yet prepared to say. But the whole of them certainly exhibit a great general resemblance in the broader traits of syntactic,* and yet a greater in those of etymological construction. In a word they are evidently members of that single and vast family of languages the singleness and the vastness of which I conceive to be justly inferrible even from its vocables: 1st, because of the similarity of the roots, 2nd, because of the similarity of the serviles, 3rd, because of the similar principles governing the uses and the mutations of both, and the consequent composition and the character of the integral words which exhibit an essential identity in numberless terms of prime necessity after due allowance for synonymous changes in their roots and for euphonic and differential changes in their serviles within known limits and upon a demonstrably single plan. And I infer that the differences characterising this vast family of languages, however striking at first sight, are subordinate, because when the languages are examined upon a broad enough scale these differences are seen to pass away by insensible gradations. Such as they are, they arise\n\n* I may instance the universal substitution of a continuative participle in lieu of conjunctions and of conjunctive (relative) pronouns, because this feature has been supposed to be specially characteristic of the Altaic group. It is no more so than the vocalic harmony of Turki, or than the inverted style and tonic system of the Indo-Chinese tongues. These appear to me to be blinding differences of degree only, not absolute differences of kind, and to have been used to sever unduly the several groups.\nfrom 1st, a greater or lesser use of the prefixed, infixing and postfixed particles, amounting to nearly constant employment of some or all of them in some tongues, and to nearly total* disuse of some or all of them in others. 2nd, from a preference by one tongue of the prefixes, of the infixes by another, and of the suffixes by a third. 3rd, from that transposed position and function of the primary and secondary part of words\u2020 (root and particle) which is a law of these languages eminently obscurative of identities in its partial operation. 4th, from the substitution of a reiterated root, for a root and particle in the composition of words when the various meanings of the root might otherwise transcend the differencing power of the particles, or at all events, not satisfy the demand for an unusually broad distinction.\u00a7 5th, from the disjunct or conjunct (slided vowel) method of\n\n* The disuse or non-use is often only apparent, for the surplus \"silent\" letters are really prefixes, with a blended instead of a separate utterance. That this is so may be proved to demonstration by identity of function (differential) in the two; and yet the blended or separate utterance makes all the difference between monosyllabism and its opposite, besides causing other differences that are apt to conceal the essential identity of words. See analysis of Caucasian and Mongolian words in appendix to my last communication.\n\n\u2020 Compare overleap and leap over: what holds good chiefly as to our verbs, holds good equally as to the verbs and nouns of these tongues wherein indeed the two classes of words are but faintly distinguishable, or not at all so. Abundant fresh evidence of the law may be found by comparing Leyden's Indo-Chinese with my Tibeto-Himalayan vocabularies: compare mim-ma and sa-mi, Burmese, with mi-sa, Newari, Root mi; and ma-nek, Burmese, with Nyi-ma, Tibetan, Root Nyi. Day, sun and morning, when compared speak for themselves.\n\n\u2021 In Gy\u00e1rung the root py\u00e9, bird, is so near to the root p\u00e9, father, that they have been segregated by the application to one of the usual prefix, to the other of the iterative principle, or root repeated, whence t\u00e1p\u00e9, a father, and py\u00e9 py\u00e9, a bird, forsan-at p\u00e9 p\u00e9. I might add, as a 5th cause of difference between these tongues, the different degrees in which each employs the tonic or accentual variant, which principle has been most erroneously supposed to be exclusively Chinese and Indo-Chinese, whereas it prevails far and wide, only more or less developed; most where the servile particles and so-called silent letters are least in use; least, where they are most in use; so that the differential and equivalent function of all three peculiarities, that is, of \"empty words,\" (see Chinese Grammar) of \"silent letters\" and of tones is placed in a clear light such as Remusat vainly strove to throw upon one of the three, viewing it separately. See Recherches sur les langues Tartares, p. 355-7, Vol. I. DeCoros strangely enough says nothing about tones or servile\nusing the prefixed serviles, whence results at once all the difference of soft polysyllabism or harsh monosyllabism. The resulting disparities of the vocables are certainly often very marked, as in the Wat\u00fa and U\u00ed instance of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang and Circassian, (so singularly confirmed by the Malay and Tagala it\u00fa, that) as well as in those given at the end of the present series of vocabularies, so that it is no great wonder that the Mongolidan tongues have been referred to many groups so trenchantly separated as virtually to fall under different families. And, if I incline so strongly to unitise the family, it is only because, as far as my investigations have gone, I have been able to discern nothing absolute and invariable in the distinctions\u2014which though no doubt distinctions proper to the vocables only and not affecting structural diagnostics (in the usual narrow sense, for composition of words is structure) are yet unusually and as I conceive decisively important owing to the extremely inartificial character which belongs to the grammar of these tongues with some apparently borrowed exceptions, such as that of the Turkish verbs. Not that the grammatical or the physical evidence of this assumed family identity conflicts with that of the vocables\u2014much the contrary, as we shall soon see\u2014but that the latter has unusual relative value. And, would we speak plainly, we should say that grammar relates equally to the construction of words and to the construction of sentences, and that the former sort of putting together or syntax is always equally, and often more, important than the latter. Certainly it is more so in the Mongolidan tongues which are as much distinguished by their immensity of nicely discriminated terms,\u2020 most of\n\nparticles and hence his remarks on the silent letters want point and significance. The language of Nepal proper is remarkable for its numerous tones and its scanty servics, whether literal or syllabic.\n\n* I may mention here an interesting sample of this identity derived from the substantive verb. It is 'da' in Myamma, a-da in Malay, da in H\u00f3rsa, gdah in Tibetan, dan in Uraos, &c. So also it is mena in Sontal and mna in Tibetan; and again, it is d\u00fbg in Tibetan, dong in Bodo and Garo and d\u00fb in Newari.\n\n\u2020 See vocab. voce 'give' and 'take.' A Tartar cannot endure that confusion of the prescriptive, optative and imperative which our imperative mood exhibits. But he remedies the defect not by the multiplication of grammatical forms but by the use of distinct words, or distinct multiplications of the same word, thus Dave solicits\nthem necessarily compounds\u2014and compounds of no unskilful contrivance\u2014as by the scantiness and infantine simplicity of the contrivances by which those terms are held together in sentences. Nay, if we look carefully to what has been so well done in one's own day for the elucidation of our own language, we shall discern that the new lights have been principally etymological, borrowed from, as thrown upon, the construction and composition of words, not of sentences.\n\nPerhaps it will be urged that, after all, the structural analogy I have established between the Gy\u00e1rung and Circassian tongues belongs rather to the etymological than to the syntactic department of language. Let it be granted, and I would then ask whether the analogy be therefore less important? And is it not singular and a proof wherein resides the essential genius and character of these tongues, and where therefore we are to seek for their true and closest relations, that my scanty knowledge of the Himalayan and Tibetan group of them should enable me unhesitatingly to analyse the words of the Caucasian group, of which I know nothing and to pronounce, for instance, Didi to be a reduplicate root, and Dini to be a root and servile prefix, with perfect confidence and, as I doubt not, with equal accuracy? That will at all events be known by and bye, and should the result be such as I look for, the consequent affinity of the Caucasian and Mongolian tongues will take an unquestionable shape and stand on the unassailable basis of words similarly constructed in all their parts and similarly employed throughout.\n\nI must, however, whilst thus insisting on the pre-eminent importance of Mongolidan vocables, freely admit that those of all my present series are by no means entitled to equal confidence, my access to the individuals who furnished the Sokpa and Gy\u00e1mi words in particular having been deficient for such analytic dissection as I hold by, and the competence of my informants, moreover, not beyond question. I am likewise much in want of adequate original information respecting the Altaic group, and of the books that might supply it. Nevertheless, I think, I may safely affirm upon the strength of my vocabularies that the S\u00f3kpo of the Tibetans are, as has been already assumed in and Davong commands, et sic de ceteris. Compare the disjunctive we, so common in these tongues.\nthis paper, no other than the Olet and Kalmak of Remusat and Klapproth,* whilst their confr\u00e8res the H\u00f3rpa are almost as evidently Turkish, the Turkish affinity of the latter being inferred, not only from the vocables but from the complex structure of H\u00f3rpa verbs and from the quasi Arian physiognomy of the samples I have seen of the H\u00f3rpa race. And thus, quoad Sokpo, is dissipated the dream of twenty years, during all which time I have been in vain endeavouring to get access to the Sokpo, assured from the identity of names (Sok pronounced Sog) that in the much talked of people of Eastern Tibet, I should discover that famous race which gave their appellations to the Sogdians and Sogdorum regio (on the Indus) of the classics, and whose identity with the Sac\u00e6 of Indian and Grecian story, whose genuine Arianism and resplendant renown, I never permitted myself to doubt. Reverting to what I have better assurance of, I shall next note a fact as extraordinary almost as that which formed the subject of my last communication to the Society, to wit, that some of Humboldt\u2019s characteristic of the Malayo-polynesian tongues hold good as to the Gy\u00e1rung language even more strangely than Rosen\u2019s of the Circassian; so that we may have possibly in the unsophisticated tongue of this primitive race of mountaineers, situated centrally between the Chinese, the Indo-Chinese, the Tibetans and the Altaians and protected from absorption, assimilation or conquest by their fastnesses, the main and middle link of that vast chain which unites the insular and continental nations of the East and the most remotely dispersed scions of the immensely diffused family of the Mongolidae!!\u2020 Those who are acquainted with the famous Kavi\n\n* I might now add, having just laid my hands on M. Huc\u2019s book, the synonyme of Turgot to those of Kalmak and Olet, but that Turgot, like D\u00e1rb\u00e9t, designates only a tribe of this race, and a tribe whose tribal denomination as well as its migration to the Volga and back to the Ili, had been already stated by Remusat. M. Huc\u2019s amusing work in fact adds nothing to our stores of accurate ethnological knowledge, his mere assertion, for instance, that the Hiongn\u00fa were Huns throwing no fresh light upon a long debated point, and the nullity of the absolute identity of names in reference to the Sog teaching us yet more to doubt vaguer identifications of this sort. Let me add that M. Huc\u2019s account of the habits, manners and characters of the several peoples is capital, and most evidently accurately as vividly delineated.\n\n\u2020 It may reconcile some of my readers to this startling announcement to hear\nSprach (known to me alas! only at second hand) will know what I mean when I solicit their attention to the accompanying Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng vocabulary, as bearing on the face of it evidence that in the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng tongue almost all the words in their ordinary* state are dissyllables, whilst I can assert positively from my own knowledge of the language that the two syllables may be resolved into a monosyllabic root and its affix, or into a repeated monosyllabic root. Now these features (which by the way are very noticeable even in the small samples accessible to me of the Circassian tongue) Humboldt has denoted as special characteristics of the Malayo-polynesian languages; and they are certainly most conspicuous attributes of the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng tongue. Thus, in the first column of the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng vocables there are thirty-five words, whereof not less than thirty-one are dissyllables and only four monosyllables, and the dissyllables are all resolvable into a monosyllabic root and its customary prefix (Ta, mutable into Ka), save those (Py\u00e9py\u00e9, Ny\u00e9ny\u00e9) that are formed by reduplication of the radical.\n\nThat Py\u00e9, bird, and Nye, cow, are roots, any one may prove for himself by turning to their Tibetan and Chinese equivalents; and that in the Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng tongue the root is in these instances repeated to constitute the current term or integral word is self-apparent. That, again, in Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng Ta is the common and almost indispensable prefix, and is mutable into Ka, both liable to euphonic changes of vowel, to suit that of the radical, the vocabulary also demonstrates, testably to any extent by its predecessors of the allied tongues. And if it be urged, as in truth it may be, that the above constitution of the vocables belongs in essence to all the continental tongues, as Humboldt\u2019s sagacity divined it did to all the insular ones, the more frequent use of the prefix and consequent dissyllabism being all that is excessively Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng, I have still to produce another Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng\n\nthat there are historical or traditional grounds for supposing this very region to be the common nest and original seat of the Chinese and Tibetan races. See Klapproth\u2019s Tabl. Histor. and Memoires relatifs \u00e0 l\u2019Asie and Remusat\u2019s Recher. sur les Lang. Tart.\n\n* I say ordinary state because when all the apparatus of composition attaches, they become polysyllabic. See the sequel, and mark the consequence as to the monosyllabic test.\ntrait which it shares with what has been deemed the most primitive Malayopolynesian type; and I shall do so by the following quotation from* Leyden. \"Few languages present a greater appearance of originality than the Ta-gala. Though a multitude of its terms agree precisely with those of the languages just enumerated (the Western Polynesian), yet the simple terms are so metamorphosed by a variety of the most simple contrivances that it becomes impossible (difficult B. H. H.) for a person who understands all the original words in a sentence to recognise them individually or to comprehend the meaning of the whole. The artifices which it employs are chiefly the prefixing or postfixing (or infixing B. H. H.) to the simple vocables (roots) of certain particles (serviles) which are again combined with others; and the complete or partial repetition of terms in this reduplication may be again combined with other particles.\" The above, as well as what follows (p. 211-12) upon Ta-gala verbs, is in general remarkably coincident with Gyarung,\u2020 the differences being such only as, when compared with other allied tongues, to show that\n\n* Researches, B. A. S. Vol. X. p. 209.\n\n\u2020 I subjoin some samples as significant as Leyden's illustrations of the Tagala verbs. From the root Ching, to go, we have almost indifferently, Yaching, Kaching, Daching, Taching, Naching, in a present sense, and Yataching, Kataching, Detaching, Tataching, Nataching, in a past sense, with some speciality of sense as to the na and ta prefix that need here be particularized. Next we have Yatachinti, Katachinti, Datachinti, Tatachinti, Natachinti, meaning 'one who goes or went, or the goer,' if one's self; and, if any other, then the series becomes Yatachisi, Katachisi, &c. The negatives are Matachinti vel Matachisi according to the person, the particle of negation displacing the first of the prefixes indifferently. So from Ming to sleep, Karns\u00e1g, Marm\u00e1ng, Tatarn\u00e1ng, Matarn\u00e1ngti, Tatarn\u00f3t\u00ed, Matarn\u00f3si, I sleep, I sleep not, I slept, I who slept not, Thou who sleptest, He who slept not, or the sleeperless, (other than one's self). From Zo, eat, Tasaso, feed, Tasas\u00e1ngti, I who feed, Tasas\u00e9si, he who feeds, Masas\u00e1ngti, I who feed not. Of these I give the analysis of the last as a sample. Ma, negative prefix. Sa, causative infix. Z\u00e1g, I eat, from the root Z\u00e1 with suffixed pronoun. Ti mutable to Si, the participial attributive suffix.\n\nThese are the simplest verbal forms and the most usual, whence the prevalent disyllabic character of the verbs as of the nouns, as seen in the vocabulary consisting of a root and one prefix. But the vocabulary, whilst it demonstrates this, indicates also the more complex forms, put rather too prominently forward by Leyden in his Tagala samples.\nthe characteristics, however pre-eminently, are by no means exclusively, Gy\u00e1r\u00fang among the continental tongues, any more than they are exclusively Ta-gala among the insular ones. Among the latter, Humboldt considers that the Ta-gala (a specimen by the way of the inseparable prefix) preserves the primitive type of the whole group; and that that type is revealed in the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang I am inclined to assert, without however forgetting that my investigation is far from com-\n\nThus, in our Gy\u00e1r\u00fang vocabulary the words, cry, laugh, be silent, run, or four out of twenty-four verbs, instead of a single prefix, have a double and even a treble supply in the simple imperative form there used; as Da-ka-kr\u00e1 from the root Kr\u00e1; Ka-na-r\u00e9 from the root R\u00e9; Na-ka-ch\u00fam from the root Ch\u00fam; Da-na-ra-gy\u00fak from the root Gy\u00fak. Hence, compounding as before, we have from the last cited simple term, Danarassgy\u00fak, cause to run; Madanarasgy\u00fak, do not cause to run; Danarassagy\u00fangti, I who cause to run; Manarassgy\u00fati or Madanarasgy\u00fati, he who does not cause to run; I believe also that the reiterative form Matam\u00e1ng is quite as usual as the substitute form Marm\u00e1ng, and Mataz\u00e1ngti, for Matassz\u00e1ngti, as Masz\u00e1ngti, time and tense notwithstanding. Repetition and other changes above illustrated in the prefixes, belong much less to the roots, infixes and suffixes whether in verbs or nouns, and when the root is repeated the prefix is commonly dropt, as has been explained as to substantives. But there are instances in the verbs of root repeated and yet prefix retained, though the vocabulary affords none such as its Kalarlar, round, which is a root repeated yet retaining its prefix; whilst the adjectives of the vocabulary, unlike the substantives also afford several instances of the doubly and trebly reiterated prefix, as Kamgn\u00e1r, sweet; Ka-magn\u00e1r from the root of gu\u00e1r, and Kav\u00e1ndro, cold, Ka-va-na-dro from the root dro.\n\nThe elided forms, however, and particularly Kamagn\u00e1r show that leaning towards dissyllabism which has been dwelt on,\u2014perhaps too strongly, though it assuredly be a most marked feature of this tongue, and one too which Leyden's mistake as to his own sample verb shows to be pre-eminently proper to Tagala; for \"tolog, to asleep\" is not the radical form of the word, as he assumes, but a compound of the root and its customary prefix, ta, with the vowel harmonised to that of the root.\n\nThe prefixes are the great variants, and besides being so much repeated, they can be transposed and interchanged almost at pleasure owing to their synonymous character, and these variations of the prefixes, with the elisions consequent on much reiteration of them, constitute the greatest part of that enigma which Leyden emphasizes; though it be in the actual use of the speech much less excessive (I still speak of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang), than his samples would lead any one to suppose.\n\nIn the above samples of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang I have given the verbs alone, without the added pronouns of Leyden's Tagalan instances\u2014such additional complication being rather suited to create wonderment than to promote sound knowledge.\nplete, and without insisting so much upon the primitiveness of this type as upon its much more interesting feature of a connecting bond between the so-called monosyllabic aptotic and the so-called polysyllabic* non-aptotic classes\u2014classes which appear to me to have no very deep or solid foundation much as they have been insisted on to the obscuration of the higher branches of philology and ethnology rather than to their illustration (as I venture to think), and but for which obscuration our Leydens and our Joneses, our Bopps and our Humboldts, could never have been found at such extreme apparent diversity of opinion. I may add, with reference to the disputed primitiveness of Ta-gala, owing to its use of the \"artifices\" above cited that throughout the Himalaya and Tibet it is precisely the rudest or most primitive tongues that are distinguished by useless intricacies, such as the interminable pronouns, and all the perplexity caused by conjugation by means of them with their duals and two plurals. The more advanced tribes whether of the continent or of the islands have, generally speaking, long since cast away all or most of these \"artifices.\"\n\nI have thus, in the present and two former communications shown what a strange conformity in the essential components of their speech still unites the long and widely sundered races inhabiting now the Himalaya, Tibet, Indo-China, Sifan, Altaia, Caucasus and Oceanica; and, as a no less strange conformity of physical conformation, unites (with one alleged exception) these races, it cannot much longer be doubted that they all belong to one ethnic family whose physical attributes it shall next be my business to help the illustration of by describing the heretofore unknown peoples whose languages have been submitted to inspection and examination. Before however I\n\n* Compare the monosyllabic roots and disyllabic simple vocables of Gy\u00e1r\u00fang with the sesquipedaliana just given? The comparison is pregnant with hints, especially as there are in the cognate tongues, all grades of approximation. Thus Ka-zar\u00e9, laugh, in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang with its double prefix, is Yero in Limbu with one, and Rer, in Misgar without any; and thus Tali\u00e1ng, air, in Lepcha with its prefix and suffix, is Taii, in Gy\u00e1r\u00fang with prefix only, and Li or L\u00e9 in Burmese without either. Innumerable instances like this make me conclude that the Gy\u00e1r\u00fang differs only in degree, not in kind notwithstanding that its verb, like that of the Ta-gala, certainly presents an extraordinary and seemingly unique spectacle in some aspects\u2014but not in all; for, in the sentence tiz\u00e9-ksz\u00e9 papun, he called them to feast, though the root za to eat be repeated and each time with a differently vowel-ed servile attached, yet the combination is not grotesque nor the root smothered.\nturn to the physical characteristics I must add that all the languages whose vocables are herewith submitted to the Society, are and always have been devoid of letters and of literature, what writing there is among these races being confined to the Tibet-trained monks whose religious ministry they all accept, and who (the monks) use the Tibetan system of writing applied solely to the Tibetan language and never to that of their flocks, the several races now in question or any of them.\n\nI cannot learn that in Tibet the Sokpo or the H\u00f3rpa ever employ any system of writing of their own, though I need not add (assuming their identification to be just) that the Mongols and the Eastern Turks have each their own system quite distinct from the Tibetan. Having always considered the physical evidence* of race quite as important as the lingual, and the one as the true complement of the other, I have not failed to use the opportunity of access to the peoples whose vocables are now transmitted in order to note their physical traits.\n\nThe following are the chief results of that investigation:\u2014\n\n| Amd\u00f3an. | H\u00f3rpa. | Gy\u00e1rung. | Manyaq. |\n|---------|--------|----------|---------|\n| I.      | II.    | III.     | IV.     |\n| Height without shoes,.............. | 5.8.\u00bd | 5.7.\u00bd | 5.3.0 | 5.4.0 |\n| Length of head, from crown to chin (with calipers),.............. | 0.8.\u00bd | 0.8.\u00bd | 0.9.0 | 0.9.\u00bd |\n| Girth of head,...................... | 1.10.0 | 1.9.\u00bd | 1.10.\u00bd | 1.10.\u00bd |\n| Length of head, fore and aft or forehead to occiput,.............. | 0.7 \u00bd | 0.7 \u00bd | 0.8.0 | 0.8.0 |\n| Width of head, between parietes,.............. | 0.6.\u00bd | 0.6.0 | 0.6.\u00bd | 0.6 \u00bd |\n| Crown of head to hip,.............. | 2.4 \u00bd | 2.4.0 | 2.3.\u00bd | 2.3.0 |\n| Hip to heel,...................... | 3.3.\u00bd | 3.3.\u00bd | 2.11.\u00bd | 3.1.0 |\n| Width between the shoulders,.............. | 1.4.0 | 1.1.0 | 1.1.\u00bd | 1.4.0 |\n| Girth of chest,...................... | 3.1.0 | 2.9.0 | 2.11.\u00bd | 2.11.\u00bd |\n| Length of arm and hand,.............. | 2.6.\u00bd | 2.6.0 | 2.4.\u00bd | 2.4.0 |\n| Length of arm,.............. | 1.0.0 | 1.0.0 | 0.11.\u00bd | 0.11.\u00bd |\n| Ditto of fore-arm,.............. | 0.11.0 | 0.10.0 | 0.9 \u00bd | 0.9 \u00bd |\n| Ditto of hand,.............. | 0.8.0 | 0.7.\u00bd | 0.7 \u00bd | 0.7 \u00bd |\n| Ditto of thigh,.............. | 1.8.0 | 1.7.0 | 1.6 \u00bd | 1.7.0 |\n| Ditto of leg, to ankle,.............. | 1.4.\u00bd | 1.5.0 | 1.3.0 | 1.5.0 |\n| Ditto of foot,.............. | 0.11.0 | 0.10.0 | 0.9 \u00bd | 0.9 \u00bd |\n| Width of hand,.............. | 0.4 \u00bd | 0.4 \u00bd | 0.4.0 | 0.4.0 |\n| Ditto of foot,.............. | 0.4 \u00bd | 0.4 \u00bd | 0.4 \u00bd | 0.4.0 |\n| Girth of thigh,.............. | 1.9.0 | 1.4 \u00bd | 1.6 \u00bd | 1.7 \u00bd |\n| Ditto of calf,.............. | 1.3 \u00bd | 1.1 \u00bd | 1.2.0 | 1.1.\u00bd |\n| Ditto of fore-arm,.............. | 0.11.0 | 0.9 \u00bd | 0.10.0 | 0.9 \u00bd |\n\n* Some attempts have recently been made (see last vol. of Brit.

I refer with confidence to Dr. Buchanan's remarks on the subject in the V. vol. Asi. Res.\nNo. I.\u2014A native of Amdo, aged 35 years, a finely formed and very strong man, capable of carrying three maunds or 250 pounds over these mountains, which he has done several times in order to turn a penny during his sojourn here, though the lax state of his muscles shows that he is usually an idler, and not now in training for such work, nor much used to it.\n\nA G\u00e9ling or monk of the mendicant class, and of course a shaving, so that his head has been examined with unusual advantage. Five feet eight and a half inches tall, and more than proportionably broad or bulky, with large bones and ample muscle, not however showing any bold development, the surface on the contrary being smooth and even, like the body of an idler. Not fat at all, but well fleshed. Colour of the skin, a very pale clear brown, or isabelline hue, like dry earth, or dirty linen, or unbleached paper; not yellow nor ruddy at all. No trace of red on the cheeks which are moderately full. Colour of eyes, dark brown; of hair, generally, black, but that of moustache, auburn. No hair on chest, nor on legs or arms. Moustache spare. No beard nor whisker. Hair of head, so far as traceable, abundant, strong and straight. Cranium not compressed nor depressed. Not raised pyramidally, yet brachycephalic rather than dolichocephalic, and the occiput truncated or flush with the thick neck, but not flattened. Vertical view of the head, ovoid not oval, widest between the ears, and thence narrowing equally to the forehead and to the occiput. Facial angle good. Profile inconspicuous. Contour of the face (front view) rather ovoid than angular or lozenge-shaped, the cheek-bones having no conspicuous lateral saliency, nor the forehead and chin any noticeable attenuation. Forehead sufficiently high and broad, and not appearing otherwise from any unusual projection of the orbital periphery or of the zygoma. Eyes sufficiently large and not noticeably oblique, but remote from each other, and flush with the cheek and the upper lid, drooping and constricted to the inner canthus which is large and tumid. Nose, good, straight; the bridge well raised between the eyes and the terminal part nor spread nor thickened, though the nostrils be shorter and rounder than in Europeans, and the saliency of the whole organ less than in them. Ears large and standing out from the head, but occupying the usual relative position. Mouth good but large, with fine vertical teeth, not\nshowing the least symptom of prognathism in the jaws. Very full lips, but not gaping nor at all Negro-like in their tumidity. Chin not retiring nor yet roundly salient, but level with the gums, or in the same plane with the teeth, and square and strong, as well as the jaws which afford ample room in front for an uncrowded set of beautiful teeth. Body well proportioned, but somewhat long (as well as massive and square) in the trunk and in the arms, relatively to the legs. Hands and feet well made and large, but rather as to breadth than length. Head well set on the short thick neck, and shoulders high. Chest, splendid, wide and deep, and general form, good. Expression Mongolian, (but not at all markedly so as to features) and calm and placidly good-natured. Ears bored, but not distended; and tattooing or other disfigurement of the skin quite unknown to all these races, as I may say once for all.\n\nNo. II. A H\u00f3rpa of T\u00e1ng\u00f3, west of Gy\u00e1r\u00e1ng towards Amdo. Name Isaba. Age 38 years. A man of good height (5-7\u00bd) and figure, but far less powerful than the Amd\u00f3an, and somewhat darker in colour. Spare of flesh, but not actually meagre. Colour, a pale brown, without yellow or red, like all the Him\u00e1layans and Tibetans, and the eye, of a dark clear brown, as usual with them. No trace of ruddiness on cheek. Hair of the head, moustache and whisker, pure black. Hair of head, long, straight, strong, abundant. Moustache small and feeble. Whisker rather ampler. No beard, nor a trace of hair on the chest, back or limbs. Head longer (fore and aft) than wide, but scarcely dolichocephalic, though not truncated occipitally, nor compressed nor depressed nor pyramidised. Vertical view, oval, the wider end being the post\u00e9al or occipital, and being wider there than between the ears. Facial angle, good. Contour of the face long and oval, without any trace of the lozenge breadth and angularity. Forehead, narrow and rather low, but not retiring. Cheek bones not salient laterally, nor the frontal sinuses or orbits, prominent. Ears large and loose. Eyes of good size, remote, but not noticeably oblique, though the inner angle be tumid with the usual constriction thereto of the upper lid which somewhat narrows the parting of the lids. Nose straight, not very salient, yet well raised between the eyes, and not dilated towards the tip, and the naree elliptic and long, but the bridge nevertheless broad and obtusely rounded. Mouth good, but large and prominent from the fullness of the\nlips which however are not gaping nor are the teeth at all prognathously inclined; well made and vertically set, but not sound. Chin not pointed nor heavy nor retiring, nor jaws unduly large and angular; whence, with the non-saliency of the zygoma, the face takes a good and Arian contour. Figure good, almost elegant, but the arms rather long, and the legs rather short in comparison of the European form. Hands and feet well made and well proportioned. Hair plaited into a tail, a la Chinoise. Ears bored, but not dilated, and furnished with small earrings. Expression pleasing, and cast of features but faintly Mongolian.\n\nNo. III.\u2014A Gy\u00e1rung of Tasar, north of Tachindo, by name M\u00e1ching, and by age 33 years. Height 5-8-0, or much shorter than either of the above. A well made smallish man. Bony and muscular development moderate, especially the former. In moderate flesh, but thigh and calf very fine; arms much less so. Arms longish. Legs shortish. Colour of skin a pale earthy brown or isabelline hue without the least mixture of yellow or of red; like Chinese but deeper toned. No ruddiness on the spare cheeks. Eye dark hazel. Colour of hair in all parts, uniformly black; long, straight, abundant, strong, on head; spare on upper lip; none on chin, nor on body nor on limbs. Cranium large, nor compressed, nor depressed, nor pyramidally raised towards the crown, though there be a semblance of that sort from the width of the sygoma (but this feature belongs to the face). Occiput not truncated postically. Fronto-occipital axis the longer and vertical view oval with the wide end backwards, the occiput being conspicuously wider than the frontal region or than the parietal, and the maximum occipital breadth lessening regularly forwards to the forehead. Facial angle good with a vertical, but inconspicuous profile. Contour of the face (front view) lozenge-shaped, widest between the cheek-bones which project much laterally, and are flattened to the front causing great breadth of face just below the eyes, whence there is a regular narrowing upwards and downwards. Forehead sufficiently high and not retiring, but narrowed apparently upwards, owing to the salient zygoma and molars. Frontal sinus not salient. Eye smallish and not well opened nor hollowed out from the cheek and upper lid drooping and drawn to the inner, inclined and tumid canthus. Eyes wide apart and oblique. Nose long, straight, thick, with a broad base between the eyes where,\nhowever, the bridge is not flat but raised into a wide, low arch: Width great there and spreading into an expanded fleasy termina-\ntion with broad alae and large round nostrils. Mouth large and sa-\nlient, yet good. Lips moderate and closed, and teeth vertically set,\nand very fine in shape and colour. Chin pretty good, not retiring,\nnor yet projecting, flush with the teeth and somewhat squared as\nalso the large jaws. Ears large and loose. Figure good with head\nwell set on; neck sufficiently long; chest deep and wide, and well\nmade hands and feet. Hair worn plaited into a pig tail. Ears\nbored, but declaredly contrary to the custom of his country, and not\ndistended. A very Chinese face and figure, and belonging to one\nwho has in his character a deal of the shrewdness tending to knavery\nthat marks the Chinaman.\n\nNo. IV.\u2014The Manyaker is 40 years old, and bears the euphonious\nname of Idrophuncho. He is a native of Rakh\u00f3, six days south of\nTachindo, and by profession a G\u00e9l\u00e1ng or mendicant friar; and a cross\nmade ugly fellow he is, as one could wish to see, with round shoulders\nand short neck, but stout and good tempered exceedingly; and, more-\nover, accomplished in reading, writing, drawing and carving like most\nof the regular troops of L\u00e1maism to which corps he belongs, though\nto the heterodox branch of it, or Bonpo sect, called by him Beunpo\nor Peunpo, and which he has enabled me to say is no other than\nTantrika Buddhism, or what is commonly called Shamanism.* This\nvery interesting and important discovery I therefore make no apolo-\ngy for inserting here though it be somewhat out of place; and, as I am\ndigressing, I may as well add that to confound the L\u00e1mas with the\nG\u00e9l\u00e1ngs, as Huc and Gabet invariably do, is a worse error than it\nwould be to confound the Br\u00e1hmans with the Pandits in India. To\nreturn to my friend Idro, whose shaven head has afforded me a se-\ncond excellent opportunity for closely examining the cranial charac-\nters of these races, I proceed to note that he is a man of moderate\nheight (5-4-0), but strongly made with large bones and plenty of\nmuscle, but no fat. Colour, a pale pure whitey brown. No trace of\n\n* In saying that Shamanism is nothing but Tantrika Buddhism I speak most\nadvisedly and fully aware of the opinions I oppose. That the Bonpo also are\nBuddhists there can be no doubt and my friend Idro's statements and drawings\nshow that his sect follow the Gy\u00fat or Tantras which, though canonical, are in bad\nodour, and have been so since the Gelukpa reform. A Bonpa and a Moalem are alike\nodious to the orthodox in Tibet, though the Bonpas have many Vihars of high name\nand date all over the country.\nred in the spare cheeks, winter though it be. Eye, dark rich brown, and hair throughout, unmixed and pure black. Like the others, he has none of the Esau characteristic, but on the contrary is, as usual, scant of hair, having not a trace of it on the body or limbs, and not much on the face. No beard. No whisker. A very wretched lean moustache and a spare straight eyebrow. Cranium bachiyocephalic and large. Vertical view of the head, ovoid not oval, widest between the ears as in the Amd\u00f3can. Thence regularly and equally narrowed to the frontal and occipital extremities. No compression nor depression of the cranium, but on the contrary a distinct pyramidal ascension from a broad base, the point of crinal radiation being somewhat conically raised from the interaural and widest part of the skull. Occiput truncate and flattened, that is, not projecting beyond the neck nor rounded posteally, like most heads. Facial angle pretty good, but rather deficient in verticality of profile. Contour of the face (see accompanying sketch) lozenge shape, owing to the large laterally salient cheek bones, though the forehead be not very noticeably narrowed (except with reference to its bulging base), nor the chin pointed. Forehead sufficiently good, high but somewhat compressed and retiring, and appearing more so by reason of the heavy frontal sinuses and zygoma which project beyond the temples towards the sides and front. Ears big and salient. Eyes, remote and oblique, with the inner angle down and tumid and the upper lid drooping and drawn to the inner canthus. Nose rather short, straight, not level with the eyes nor yet much raised to separate them nor elsewhere. Not clubbed at the end, but the alae spreading, and the nares large and round. Mouth large and forward with very thick lips, but no prognathism, the teeth being vertical and the lips not gaping so as to expose them. Teeth well formed and well set in an obtusely convex large arch, those of the upper jaw however overhanging those of the lower. Chin rather retiring, or flat and square. The partial retirement of the chin and the large frontal sinuses are what mar the verticality of the profile which moreover shows little of nasal and much of oral projection. Figure bad with thick goitrous neck, high forward shoulders, and somewhat bowed legs. Hands and feet well made. Muscular development of arms, poor, of legs, good. A thoroughly Mongolian face, but the ugliness in part redeemed by the good-natured placid, yet somewhat dull, expression.\n| English | Tho-chu | S\u00f3kpa | Gy\u00e1mi

Both sounds are found in the French word jeu. The system of tones or accents, so important for discriminating the many otherwise-identical roots in these tongues, there is no practicable method of doing justice to. But I have marked the chief one, or abrupt final, by an underscored h, thus h. In Th\u00f3ch\u00fa and in H\u00f3rpa, the h, kh, and gh, have often, nay generally, a harsh Arabic utterance. I use the short vague English a, and e, as in cat, yet, for their common equivalents in these tongues, but u has always the oo sound, whether short or long. It so occurs in English though rarely, as in put, pudding. The continental (European) and eastern system of the vowels is that pursued, and the long sound of each is noted by accent superscribed. It is the common vocalic system, the English being wholly beside the mark. Y is always a consonant. It blends with many others to give them a sliding sound as in the zy, above instanced. It gives S the sound of Sh, as in the Sy\u00e1n of (Shan) tribe\u2019s name. It must never be made a vowel, a l\u2019anglaise, for that makes monosyllables dissyllabic and totally changes the proper sound of words. The same as to W, which we English are however more familiar with. From \u00e9, I make the diphthong ai; from \u00e1 that of au; from \u00f3 that of ou, sounded as in aye aye, hawfinch, how; which, with the gallic eu (beurre heurre), are invariably diphthongs, each with a single blended sound. If two vowels come together and require separate utterance, the latter is\nNorthern and South-eastern Tibet.\n\n| Gy\u00e1rung | H\u00f3rpa | T\u00e1kpa | Manyak |\n|---------|-------|-------|--------|\n| Ta-t\u00fap  | Nazbi | D\u00fang\u00e1 | Dan-th\u00e1 |\n| Na-s\u00e9   | Ta-sh\u00e9 | S\u00f3t\u00e1 | Na-sya |\n| Ko-pet  | W\u00fa-khy\u00e9 | Rot\u00e1 | Tr\u00falh\u00e9 |\n| Di-chang | W\u00fam-b\u00f3 | Khor | T\u00fay\u00fa |\n| Ta-yok  | Rang-k\u00e9.

I have marked off the prefixes (tir-mi, man, see Gy\u00e1rung column) to facilitate access to the root and comparison on a large scale such as that lately employed to illustrate ethnic affinities. This and the like marking off of the suffixes will be a great aid to those who wish to make such comparisons without knowledge of these languages. But the procedure is hardly correct since the root and its prefix in particular are apt to be blended in utterance by transfer of the accent (mi, tir-mi) and since the sense also of the roots is occasionally as dependant (though in a different way) on that of their prefixes, as it is in regard to the prepositions of the Arian tongues (tir-mi, man; ti-mi, fire). Nevertheless these important particles are liable to a large range of mutation, synonymous as well as differential, merely euphonic as well as essential, whilst some of the tongues use them very amply, and others very rarely. Add to these features the infixes and the suffixes, with the occasional change of place and function between all these, and you have before you the causes of the differences of these languages which are often so operative as to merge their essential affinity and make it indiscernible except by those who, knowing the roots, can pursue them and the servile portions of the vocables through their various metamorphoses and transpositions.*\n\n* Compare in Tibeto-Himalayan and Indo-Chinese series, as follows:\nDey.\u2014Nyi-ma, Ma-ni, Nye-n-ti, Nhi-ti-ma, Sak-ni.

H. H.\nIbn Huokul's account of Khorasan.\u2014translated by Major W. Anderson, Bengal Artillery.\n\nKHORASAN\n\nIs the name of a large country divided into districts. On the East it is bounded by Seestan and India, I have already given in my map of Seestan those portions of Ghoor which are near and belong to Seestan, but the entire country is considered Indian. I have included the districts of the Khuluj tribes in Cabul. While Wakan and those places to the south of Khotul are also Indian.\n\nTo the West lie the deserts inhabited by the Goz tribes and the country of Joorjan.\n\nTo the North extends Mawarolnuhr and a portion of the Tork kingdom south of Khotul.\n\nTo the South are situated the desert of Fars and Koomis.\n\nBut I have added Koomis to the map of Duelum, Joorjan, Teberestan, Rue, and Kuzween, and of them formed a separate division.\n\nI have included Khotul with Mawarolnuhr, as lying between the Wukhshab and Khurab, and also Kharism, because it is beyond the river and its capital nearer to Bokhara than to Khorasan.\n\nThis country to the east is enclosed by a line sweeping along the desert of Fars and Herat and Ghoor, to Ghuznee; joined by a line from Koomis to Furawuh making nearly a square. Thence, along the confines of Joorjan and the Caspian to Kharism, embracing the inhabited places.\n\nIn the various aggregations and divisions of Khorasan the chief places are, Neeshapoor, Merv, Herat, Bulk.\n\nThe minor subdivisions are, Koohistan, Toos, Nesa, Abeewurd, Surukhs, Esfezar, Pooshung, Badghues, Gunj\u2014Rostak, Mervrood, Joozjan, Bameeyan, Tokharestan, Zum, Amol. Kharism I will describe with Mawarolnuhr, as its capital is beyond the river, and nearer to that country than to Persian Khorasan.\n\nI have not separated Neeshapoor, but have detailed under it all the various subdivisions, at the same time I have separated Tokharestan from Bulk, as, although commonly joined in name, their description and revenue accounts are kept separate.\nThese arrangements only involve some care in the table of routes, and in the map, as it is necessary to introduce so many places under the one map of Khorasan.\n\nNeshapoor was known as Beran-Shuhr; it is situated in a level country with houses built of unburnt brick, placed at a distance from each other; the city covers a square farsukh, having a town, fort and ramparts\u2014both the town and fort contain a large population. The Jama Musjed is in the suburbs at a place called the Cantonments. The Government house is situated on a plain called the Prison-square, near the Jail, at a distance of a farsukh from the Mosque; it was built by Omur bin Lues.\n\nThe fort has two gates, and the town four:\n- The Rasulkunturah or bridge gate.\n- The Mokufful or closed gate.\n- The Kohundes or fort gate.\n- The Deze-Mushkran.\n\nThe fort is distinct from the town, but the ramparts enclose both; these last have gates, that leading to Urak and Joorjan is the Kohab, that on the Bulkh, Merve and Mawarolnuhr road is the Jubul or mountain gate; the entrance on the Fars and Kohistan road is the Huozol Byaz gate; while on the Toos and Ness road are several gates, as the Sookhtah and Sere Sheereen.\n\nThe bazars are outside the town and the fort in the suburbs, the best is known as the Great-square and the second as the Small-square, from the great square the bazars extend to the east as far as the Mosque, and to the west they join the smaller square\u2014to the south they extend to the tomb of the two Husains, and to the north the streets end at the Bridge. The smaller square is near the prison and Government house.\n\nThe water is chiefly taken from kareez running near the habitations and it flows from the houses and waters the gardens inside and outside the city. They have also a large river called the Wade Sughswar. Several towns and villages are irrigated from its waters which run from this Wadee, nor is there any larger river.\n\nIn the whole of Khorasan there is no more extensive or salubrious city than Neshapoor.\n\nThe weavers manufacture stuffs of cotton and of silk which are\nso plentiful and good as to be exported to all countries of Moslems and of Kaifers.\n\nNeeshapoor possesses extensive districts and populous towns, as Boozjan, Malun called Kearajerd, Khaemund, Suloomul, Sungan, Zoosun, Kunduz, Tersheez, Janruwan, Azad-war, Khushnogerd, Buhmunabad, Muzneyan, Subzwar, Rewaduh, Mehrjan, Esfursayun, Khuer Khan, Zurmuluh, and if Toos be included, there may be added Radgan, Taburoon, Burrooghoor and Nookan.\n\nToos contains the tomb of Ulee the son of Moosa Reza, on whom be peace, also the sepulchre of Haroonul-rusheed; the tomb of the former is distant from the town about four fursukhs, in a village called Sunabad. The latter is at Nookan. Turquoises are extensively found in the hills near Neeshapoor and Toos, and earthen-ware is exported.\n\nMerv, known as Merve Shah Juhan, is a very ancient place, the fort is considered to have been built by Tuhmoorus, while the old city was founded by Zool Kurnuen; it is situated on a level plain far from any hills; the soil is saline and very sandy, while the houses are of unburnt bricks. The place contains three Jama Musjeds\u2014the oldest being the Musjed built inside the place on the first introduction of Islam called the Muhan next is the Musjed Uteek at the city gate chiefly occupied by the traditionists; the third is the Musjed of Makhan. They consider this last Musjed, the bazars and the Government house to have been built by Abo Moslem. The Government house is in front of this Musjed and contains an arched room built by Abo Moslem under which he used to sit\u2014and to this day the Umeers of Merv assemble under it; it is built of bricks and mortar, and covers a square of fifty-five cubits.\n\nThis doomed room has four doors, each opening into a vestibule ornamented over the entrances with sculptured representations of large fish, and in front of each vestibule is a square open court. The fort is as large as the city, but now in ruins, it is built on an elevated mound which has a kareez cut into it from which the water runs to this day; and sometimes vegetables and melons are cultivated on it.\n\nOriginally the bazars were at the gate of the city near the Ateek musjed, but in the days of Abo Moslem, they were removed to Makhan; they are cleaner than the bazars of other cities.\nThe Bedgah is situated in the division called Rasulmuedan near the square of Abee Jehem, and is surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings. The situation is between Makhan and the canal of Hormuz Kuruh. The streets of the city have four canals\u2014among them is the canal above mentioned\u2014on which are built many of the houses of the city, it enters the walls from the direction of a place called Serjooh.\n\nHosuen bin Taher erected many of these buildings, and wished to remove the bazars and Government house to this position. The inhabitants of the quarter of the city called Ras ol Shabaee use this water, in this division, resides the family of Shnekh ol Juleel Abu fud Mohummud, the son of Obuedallah.\n\nAnother canal is called the Makhan; on it is the Government house, the bazars, the musjed Hadeesan, the jail and house of the family of Abee Lukhum the slave of Abee Moect. In which house is a dome, round the interior of which is written the declaration of election to the Khulafut of the family of Abbas, the cupola stands to this day.\n\nAnother canal is called the Zoruk\u2014it flows to the gate of the city and its water is used by the people, on it is the Uteek musjed, and lower down is the house of the family of Khaleel ben Uhmud ben Hemad, the Governor of Bokhara.\n\nNext is the canal of Usudee Khorasanee, which waters the Muhuluh of the Sunjar gate, Burmahan and other quarters; on this canal was the house of the Murzban of Merv.\n\nSuch are the canals on which are placed the various divisions of Merv with their buildings, a wall surrounds all these four canals with the houses; a second wall surrounds the city and the various villages and is known as the wall of Race, of it remains are now to be seen.\n\nThe interior city has four gates.\n\nThe first leading to the Jama-Musjed is called the Sharsan.\n\nThe Homa, the Sunjar, the Malun, the Dure Mushkan leading to Bokhara, near which was the residence and the mint of Mamoon during the period he lived at Merv, previous to his being elected to the Khulafut.\n\nMerv has one chief river rising under Bameyan from which are cut\nall the above-mentioned canals irrigating the lands, it is called the Morghab or waters of Merv, some think the name is taken from that of the spring where the river rises, named Morghab; others, that the derivation is from Murgh Ajumuh, the pasture of reeds.\n\nThis river flows to Merv rood and its villages and then enters Merv Shahjahan at Goo Geen between Khoosan and Kursaheo\u2014the bunds are placed at the village of Zoruk where the water is thrown off into the canals\u2014by boards having holes equalizing the division of the water to all parties, so that if any person takes more or less than his right destruction overtakes his crops. There is an officer placed in charge of the water who is even a greater man than the Walee of Muoonuh.\n\nI have understood that ten thousand men find employment on this river. Merv was the cantonment of a large force in the early days of Kalam; and the district was the place which determined the possession of Persia, to the followers of Mohammad, for Yezdegard the last king of Persia was killed in a mill on the canal of Zorak. From this quarter arose the call to the Khulufut of the Abbas family. In the house of the children of Aboo Lukham Olmoeet was this celebrated call, written round a dome; but now hardly to be read. From this city went forth Mamoon to contend for the Khulufut with his brother Mohammad bin Zobueduh. Many bestowers of the Khulufut resided in this city.\n\nThe best pannen of Erak and Khorasan, the most celebrated theological lawyers and masters of ethics are of Merv, I have determined that my book should be a mere abstract, and hence have excluded those celebrated men, whose histories may be found in works on the subject. I have not detailed men and things which perhaps should have been mentioned.\n\nIn the days of the Persian dynasty, the most renowned of physicians and of accomplished performers came from Branshahr; as Burzooyah, the first of doctors, and Barbed, the chief of singers and of musical performers.\n\nThe provisions are better than in any other portion of Khorasan, the bread in particular is finer and better tasted\u2014while of its dried fruits and raisins, a large exportation takes place to other countries. Much is said of the productions of Herat and the plenty in other\ncountries; but the delicacy and flavour of Merv productions are superior. Of its fruits the melon is large and is exported to Erak; but I am not sure if it is carried to other countries.\n\nAs to the city, the cleanliness, the beauty of the place, the arrangement of the divisions and of the houses, the windings of the canals, the vineyards, the marked difference of the people of the bazaars from those of other places, all stamp the superiority of Merv over other parts of Khorasan. On its deserts flourish the Turunj-bean which is carried over the world, as also are its fabrics of silk and its raw silk. But I have heard that the original source of the silk-worm is Jorjan and Tuberestan, whence it was brought long ago to Merv.\n\nRaw silk is now exported from Merv road to Tuberestan, also the superior cotton called the Leyun cotton, and ready made sheets.\n\nMerv possesses several ancient traditionist mosques. Merv road has two. Keshmehun, Hoormuz Kuruh, Seemuj, Khuzukh, Khuruk Shoohukum have each one house of prayer.\n\nHerat.\u2014This is the name of a city having various districts; among its towns are Malun, Jusan, Serteyan, Oobuh, Marabad, Pashtan, Korookh, Chesht, Rafezak, Udruskun, Gowasan, Kooshuk, Khorasanabad.\n\nRafesar is the name of a district containing the four towns I have mentioned.\n\nHerat is surrounded by walls, with plenty of water, and a large population, it has also suburbs, and contains a fort and Jama Musjed; but the Government house is outside the walls at a place called Khorasanabad about one-third of a farsukh from the city on the road to Pooshung lying to the westward. The houses are erected from unbaked bricks, and each side of the city measures about half a farsukh.\n\nThe city has four gateways, that to the north on the Neeshapoor road is called the Krak, that on the road to Bulkh is named Kepchak. The gateway leading to Seestan is known by the name of Feroozabad, while that leading to Ghoor the Khoshuk. The doors are all of wood except the Krak which is covered with iron, at each entrance is a bazaar for the use of the inhabitants of the neighbouring quarter of the city. Water runs through the towns and suburbs,\nthe fort has also four entrances opposite to, and known by the names of, the gates of the city.\n\nOutside the fort runs a wall on each side, to the height of a man, and about thirty paces in breadth.\n\nThe Jama Musjed is in the centre of the city surrounded by bazars, while to the west of it is placed the jail. In all Khorasan, Seestan, Mavarulnahr and the Jubal districts, there does not exist to the present time a better frequented Musjed that the one of Herat. Next in estimation is that of Bulkh, then the musjed of Seestan.\n\nThis Herat Musjed is much frequented by a large body of the profession learned in matters of religion, the congregation conduct themselves after the customs prevailing in Syria, and have a religious discourse read on each Friday's assembly.\n\nHerat is a grand halting place between Fars and Khorasan, also a central mart for these countries as well as for Seestan.\n\nOn the road to Bulkh about half a fursukh from the city there is a hill rising from the plain lying between Herat and Esfezar, it produces neither wood nor grass but merely stones for mills and floors. On the summit of this hill stood a fire temple called Sershak; between it and the city is a Christian church.\n\nNo water nor any gardens exist until you reach the canal of the city near the gate, which is crossed by a bridge; beyond this canal there is neither garden nor water.\n\nNear all the gates irrigation being obtainable, gardens are numerous\u2014the most populous is the Feroozabad gateway. The river of this district rises at the Robate Gorwan, and as it flows from Ghoor to Herat, many canals are cut from it as follows:\n\n| Canals          | Villages Watered                      |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Perwan          | Huwadushtuk                           |\n| Malun           | Kowashan, Seyawashan, Malun, Teezan;  |\n| Ulanjan         | Koosman                               |\n| Kheyaban        | Sulbuh                                |\n| Kumburak        | Kookan                                |\n| Ghoorwan        | Zeeruk                                |\n| Tooneyan        | Ghooryan Kurugurd                     |\n| Subkur          | Ghazurwan and Feerozabad              |\n| Unjeel          | The city of Herat and the gardens on the Seestan road. |\nNext to Herat the largest towns are Korookh and Oobuh, from the former are exported large quantities of raisins, of which the particular sort called subeeb taynfee is also excellent at Malun.\n\nKorookh is a small place inhabited by a Khowarej population. The Musjed is located in the quarter belonging to the Seyuds, the houses are of unburnt bricks, the place itself is among the mountains, about a fursukh square filled with gardens, running water, trees, and populous villages.\n\nOobuh\u2014the population is of the established Sonnee sect, the place is about the size of Korookh with gardens, water and houses of unburnt bricks.\n\nMalun is smaller than Korookh, but covered with gardens containing water and plenty of grapes, always well peopled.\n\nJusan contains few trees and is less than Malun in size, the people are of the established sect.\n\nSerteyan, the population is Khowarij, the place less in size than Malun, contains water and a few gardens, corn being more cultivated than fruit, as the situation is among the hills.\n\nMarabad is a place less than Malun, contains many gardens and much water, rice is exported largely.\n\nPaahtan is less than Malun, much grain cultivation, but few gardens exist, although water is plentiful.\n\nEsfezar contains four towns, the largest being Kowashan which is less in size than Khorookh, but contains many gardens. Kowazan, Kooshuk, Edreskun, the other three places, are nearly equal in size, with water and gardens.\n\nThe district of Esfezar extends about four marches in length by one in breadth, it is highly populous, contains but little level land and has one difficult pass called Kashkan, this is inhabited by Khowarej families\u2014while the population of the large towns is of the established sect.\n\nPooshung, its chief towns are Khushruo Gerd, Berkurduh, Kooswesylk, Koh.\n\nPooshung is the largest and about the extent of half Herat; it is situated on a plain distant about two fursukhs from the range which passes Herat, the houses are level constructed much as those of Herat; water and trees are plentiful, one species called the Urur-\nis superior to that produced in any other district of Khorasan, and is exported in large quantities. The water is supplied from the Herat rood, a river which flows on to a place called Surukha, unless when the water is turned off below that place, in which year it is not obtainable so low down its bed. Pooshung is surrounded by a wall and a ditch, having three entrances.\n\nThe Ulee gate on the Neeshapoor road, the Herat and the Kohestan on their respective roads.\n\nThe next town is Koosweyuh, in size about one third of Pooshung, containing water and a few gardens with houses of unburnt brick.\n\nKhusruo Gerd abounds in gardens and water but is less in size than Koosweyuh\u2014Berkurduh is still smaller with some water; the inhabitants are breeders of cattle and not agriculturists. Koh is equal to Berkurduh, has both cultivation and irrigation.\n\nBadghues, contains the towns of Jubul-ul-fesut, Koh, Koghunabad, Best, Jadoo, Kaburoon, Kalyoos, Dehestan; the Sultan resides at Koghunabad; the largest and most populous place of these is Dehestan which is about half the size of Pooshung, with houses built of clay; the country contains much lead. The town is among the hills of little water and few gardens and no grapes, its cultivation depends on rain, similar to which are Koh and Jubul-ul-fesut of which the two former is the largest place, the latter is on a hill containing mines of silver not worked from the absence of fire wood, the former, Koh, is on a plain.\n\nKoghunabad, Best, Jadoo possess gardens, water and upland cultivation, but Kaburoon and Kalyoos are without gardens or running streams, their water being obtained from ponds and wells. The inhabitants are agriculturists as well as breeders of cattle. Jubul-ul-fesut is situated on the road leading from Herat to Surukha. The population of Badghues is all of the established somnee sect, except that of Hujestan, and the village of Uhmud bin Abdallah who are all Khowarej.\n\nGunj Rostak is a district of which Buen is a town, as also Knef and Bugahoor, the Sultan resides at Buen which is the largest place in the district and greater than Pooshung, to which place Bugahoor is about equal; Kuef is less than half Bugahoor; Buen and Knef possess plenty of water, gardens and grapes, but the houses are of\nclay. The water of Bugshoor is from ponds and wells, the place being situated on a plain: its cultivation is small, chiefly upland; but the situation is healthy and salubrious. All these places are on the road to Mervrood.\n\nMervrood\u2014one of the towns is Kusre Ukhnuf, another Duruh, the largest being Mervrood. This place is smaller than Pooshung, it has the advantage of a large river which flows on to Merv-Shajehan; on the river are many gardens containing plenty of grapes, the air and soil are salubrious.\n\nKusre Ukhnuf is situated one journey on the road to Bulkh. Duruh is on the road to Unbar at the distance of four fursukhs. Kusre Ukhnuf abounds in water, gardens, grapes and fine fruits. Duruh is watered by the Merv-rood which divides the town, and is crossed by a bridge: it abounds in gardens of grapes and fruits. Mervrood is about an arrow\u2019s flight from the river. Talkan is about the size of Mervrood with running water, and a few gardens, its houses like those of Mervrood are built of clay, than which place it is more healthy.\n\nMervrood is situated at a distance of three fursukhs from hills to the west, and of two from those to the east. Talkan is in the hills and has villages round it.\n\nFaryab\u2014is in size less than Talkan, but exceeds it in water and gardens, its houses are built of clay.\n\nJoozjan is the name of a district, of which Yahoodeyah is a town, as also are Shuburghan, Undkhod, Usluj, Kundderem, Unbar, San: Of these Unbar is the largest, being more extensive than Mervrood, it is the residence of the Sultan and situated among the hills\u2014having gardens, water and vines, but houses of clay. San is a place of no extent, with gardens and water, its chief fruits are walnuts, being among the hills.\n\nYahoodeyah is more extensive than San, but of the same description. Kundderem abounds in vines, walnuts and water. Shuburghan has running water, agriculture exceeds horticulture, but it is of greater extent than Kundderem. Murshan equals in size Yahoodeyah.\n\nSeerokh is a town. Undkhod a small one on the plains having seven villages attached to it, containing houses of the Koord popu-\nlation, who are breeders of cattle and camels, and also they manufacture hair numuds. Khorasan is supplied with leather from the districts of Joozjan, which are also very fruitful.\n\nShuburghan is one march to the north of Unbar. To reach Yahoodayah from Shuburghan it is necessary to go to Unbar, thence to Yahoodayah. From Shuburghan to Undkhod two marches to the north. From Shuburghan to Kundderem, four marches, viz. three to the river and one march beyond it.\n\nGhorjestan or Ghorjulshar has two towns, Busheer and Soormeen, both equal in size, but neither constitutes the residence of the Sultan; the Shar to whom this kingdom belongs, resides in the hills at a place called Gungan, the country has water and gardens in plenty, and much rice is exported from it. Large quantities of raisins are produced in Soormeen. Busheer is one march from Duruh of Mervrood.\n\nMutlugh is an arrow's flight from the river of Mervrood to the East. From Busheer to Soormeen is one march to the south among the hills.\n\nGhoor is a country of infidels, which I include in the country of Eslam, because there live some Mohummudans in it. The country is one of springs, gardens and rivers, very fertile. Towards the east in early days was a tribe which professed Eslam, but were not Mohummudans in heart.\n\nGhoor is bounded by the districts of Herat, Furruh, Zumeenda-wur, the Robat Gorwan in the country of Kureeghoon, Ghorgestan, back to Herat; all of which districts are inhabited by Mohummudans, hence have I mentioned Ghoor as in the very centre of Eslam.\n\nSurukhs is a city between Neeshapoor and Merv\u2014situated on a level plain; river water only reaches it in particular years, and is not permanent, being the excess of the water of the Herat river. Its cultivation requires no irrigation. The city is about half the size of Merv, populous and salubrious, the neighbourhood consists chiefly of pasture-lands round a few villages, the main wealth being camels. The town is a centre of traffic for the surrounding districts of Khorasan. The mills are turned by cattle, the water being from wells; the houses are built of clay.\n\nNesa is a town equal in size to Surukhs, cultivated, irrigated and\nhaving plenty of gardens. Water runs through the houses, and the streets are clean. It has many large thriving villages, being situated on outskirts of the mountains.\n\nFurawuh is a frontier post on the deserts of the Ghoz tribe of Turks; it is separated from all villages, but has a Jama-musjed, and is the station for a guard moving to a great distance for the protection of the people. The place is a Robat with no villages, and no population near it. A spring runs through the place. There exist neither gardens nor cultivation, except a little pulse on the spring. The guard is under the strength of one thousand men.\n\nThe Kohestan of Khorasan lies near the desert of Fars, there is no town of the name, but one is called Kaen, of which the dependencies are Jonabad, Tubus called Geeluk, Khoar, Tubus known as Museena.\n\nKaen is equal in size to Surukhs, it has houses of clay, with a citadel surrounded by a ditch, also a Jama-musjed, and a government-house in the citadel; its water is derived from springs, with a few gardens, and villages far separated, the climate is cold.\n\nTubus is inferior to Kaen in size, the temperature is warm and dates appear; the place is surrounded by a wall, but has no fort, its houses are of clay and its waters derived from kareez; its dates are larger than those of Kaen.\n\nKhoar is in size less than Tubus, and near to Khost. The Jama-musjed is at Khoar; the houses are of clay with no fortifications or fort. The gardens are few and water from kareez\u2014indeed the want of water is excessive; the people are cattle-breeders, the place being situated on the borders of the desert with no gardens.\n\nJonabad is greater than Khoar\u2014the houses are of clay\u2014villages and gardens exist with water from kareez. Tubus Geeluk is larger than Jonabad, there is water from kareez, and villages and gardens, and houses of clay. There exist the remains of an old fortification now in ruins, but a fort is standing. Dates are found in Kohestan, Tubus, and those places which I have mentioned as of cold climate. I have well examined all of them. The population is scanty as in other parts of Khorasan. On the confines of the district is a desert inhabited by Koords, who are breeders of cattle, as camels and sheep. On the boundaries towards Neeshapoor is found an earth which is exported for use, but not for food to distant countries.\nI know of no large rivers in the Kohestan; they manufacture a species of earthen-ware which is taken to other places; also cloth of silk and cotton mixed, also much thread\u2014but nothing else of value.\n\nBulkh, to which belong Tokharestan, Khotul, Punjheer, Budukhshan, Bameeyan.\n\nTokharestan contains Kholum, Sumunjan, Bughlan, Sukulkund, Wurwageer, Urhun, Raween, Talkan, Eshkemesh, Zuwa, Serae Asem, Chesht, Indurab, Muzur, Gah.\n\nKhotul contains Holawerd and Lawakund, towns of Wukhsh, Karteel, Ulyan, Huleel, Sekundurah, Meel, Undecharagh, Roostak Neel, sometimes Khotul is joined to the districts of Mawazlnuhr.\n\nBameeyan contains Bameeyan, Lushghorkund, Segawund, Kabul, Nujruo, Perwan, Ghuznee, Punjheer.\n\nBudukhshan has a capital of the same name and is the country of Abu ul Futuh.\n\nBulkh lies on a plain about four fursukhs from the nearest hills called the Guz. The city has walls and ramparts with a Musjed ul Jama in the centre of the city surrounded by bazars, between which live the people. The length of the city is about half a fursukh, the houses are of clay. The gateways are called Nuo Bahar, Rukhnnh, Hudeed, Hindoo, Yuhyood, Shustbund, Yuhyo. A canal called Rohaneen enters the ramparts at the Nuo Bahar gateway: it is capable of turning ten mills, and irrigates as far as the village called Seyahgerd.\n\nThe gateways are surrounded by gardens and vineyards, the walls have no ditch and are built of clay.\n\nTokharestan; the largest place is Talkan, situated on a plain at an arrow's flight from the hills, it possesses a large canal with gardens and vineyards, being about one-third the size of Bulkh; next in extent is Wurwageer and then Indurab which is situated in a gorge of the hills; it is a mart for the silver found in the mines of Jaryanuh and Punjheer; two rivers flow in this district called the Indurab and Kasan; vines and fruit-trees are plentiful. All the other places of Tokharestan are much of the same magnitude, but all less than Talkan. Wurwageer and Indurab are at the heads of springs containing fruit-trees, much cultivation, and a large population.\nThe towns of Khotul are all well supplied with springs, trees and population, they are all situated on plains, except Sekundurah.\n\nThe Jubal or hill-districts of Khotul are all mountainous, except about Wukhsh.\n\nThe large towns of Khotul are Meel, Ulyan, Huleel; the Sultan resides at the last named place. Khotul is situated between the streams Wukhsh and the river of Budukshan, which is also called Khurab. Near this district flow many streams which all unite a little above Termez near Kobadayan and form the great river called Jueboon.\n\nMeel is about the size of Indurabuh, Huleel less\u2014the houses of both are built of clay, but the walls of Meel are of stone and mortar. Two districts of the Kafirs called Wukhan and Gharan are adjoining.\n\nBudukshan is less than Meel in size, it has many villages, vineyards, a large population and cultivation with plenty of water,\u2014being situated on the river Khurab flowing to the West. Khotul exports large numbers of cattle; and produces abundance of lapis lazuli and rubies from mines in the hills. Musk is imported by the road of Wakhan from Tubbut.\n\nPunjheer is a place in the hills inhabited by ten thousand men chiefly robbers and thieves. There are streams and gardens but no cultivation.\n\nJaryanuh is a smaller place than Punjheer,\u2014both contain mines of silver and houses for the men employed in the mines, they have no gardens or cultivation. The river of Punjheer runs through the district of that name, then flows into Jaryanuh, and passing Perwan, enters India.\n\nBameeyan, its city is about half the size of Bulkh. This district is called Sheer Bameeyan; the town is without walls built on a hill, a rivulet flows through it into Ghorgestan\u2014fruits are imported, it having no gardens. There is no town near at hand situated on the hills except Bameeyan.\n\nGuznee has no gardens but a stream flows near it; none of the places under Bulkh are more rich or more commercial than Guznee, which is a mart of India.\n\nKABUL has a strong fort of one entrance, in which reside Mohummedans; with suburbs in which reside Hindoos. It is settled, that\nthe king has no right to the kingdom unless he is residing at Kabul on attaining it\u2014should he be at a distance, he does not obtain the power until returning to Kabul. This city is also a grand emporium of Indian produce. Bulkh produces the Bactrian camel, superior to those of any other district, also oranges, water-lilies and sugar-cane, which are products of warm climates, but no dates. Snow falls in the neighbourhood. Nugruo, Segawund and Kabul are warm climates but still produce no dates.\n\nGhoor is surrounded on all sides by Mohummudan countries, but the inhabitants are infidels, except a few who pass for Mohummudans.\n\nThe country is of mountains; their language is different from the Persian language; the earth is fruitful in crops, cattle and flocks. I have admitted it into Khorasan, because it is surrounded on three sides by this country, one boundary is Seestan.\n\nMost of the slaves from Ghoor are carried to Herat or Seestan or in those directions. At the back of Ghoor, stretches a range of mountains reaching to Bameeyan, Punjheer and Wakhan.\n\nIt then passes into Mawazolnuhr crossing Sar and Shash, and concluding in the country of the Khurgheez.\n\nThis range from beginning to end contains mines of silver and of lead. The most pure comes from the country of the Kherkheez; Ferghanah and Shash; but the best obtainable in Mohummudan countries is from Punjheer and its dependencies.\n\nI will sketch the banks of the Juehoon and Kharism in my account of Mawazolnuhr.\n\nAmol and Zum are two places of equal size on the banks of the Juehoon, having running water, gardens and cultivation. Amol is the point of meeting of the various roads from Khorasan. Zum is less populous than Amol, it is also a well known ferry. These places are surrounded by the desert which extends from Bulkh to the sea of Kharism\u2014the soil is chiefly sandy, with no springs, only a few ponds and wells for water and pasture-lands. This desert reaches back to Merv from Amol. A similar one also separates these districts from Kharism and the countries of the Ghoz tribes. Wells are dug and much cattle are produced, but the best breed of camels in Khorasan is from Surukhs and Bulkh.

According to Fraser, hardly a trace remains of the various neighbouring cities passing under this name, unless perhaps mounds of debris with two shrines of Mohummudan saints can be so termed. The trade has entirely vanished, and now consists in the traffic of the turquoise\nfound in the mines\u2014the circuit of the present wall is 4000 paces, the population under 20,000 souls, the entire revenue being estimated at a lac of Tomans.\n\nIn the Nozhat-ul-Koloob it is stated, that Shahpoor ben Ardesheer in renovating this city carried on the ancient custom of laying out cities on the form of some animal, or visible article; in this case, the squares of the chess-board were adopted. Bulk subsequently assumed the position of capital of Khorasan, until Omur ben Lues restored this dignity to Neeshapoor. One of the numerous new cities had the name of Shadbagh\u2014it was destroyed by an earthquake in A.H. 679, after this arose the present town which has been absorbed in the modern Mushud. Every book contains long descriptions of the beauties and delights of the springs and gardens of Neeshapoor.\n\nBoozjan or Boochgan, on the high road to Herat at a distance of 38 fursukhs from Neeshapoor according to the Nozhat-ul-Koloob: The Bezk of Burne's map (?) also noted as a district of Jam. Four roads take off from this place; to Herat, Kaen, Surukhs, and Bakhurz.\n\nKhaemund, doubtful. Burne's Map exhibits Kahmah near the required position.\n\nSuloomul doubtful. Salama of the Maps?\n\nSungan. Sungoon of the Maps\u2014mentioned by Christie, a place in Zawuh.\n\nZoozan is noted on Burne's Map, but too far to the north of the position required. The interpolation of places by correct European latitudes and longitudes, among locations from native authorities has this effect of transposing positions. All places connected, require to be reduced in the same ratio of the newly determined place.\n\nTeresheez was visited by Forster, who says the old capital was called Sultan Abad, of small compass surrounded by a wall.\n\nDure Mushkan, a fort of this name between Neeshapoor and Subswar is mentioned in the Nadir Namuh.\n\nAzadwar is noted as eight fursukhs from Jajerm, the first march on the road to Neeshapoor.\n\nKhushruogerd is noticed by Fraser, a fort of great antiquity with delapidated minars and extensive ruins.\nBuhmunabad Map.\n\nMuzneyan, Muzeenoon of Fraser, a place surrounded by extensive ruins.\n\nSubzwar is the central town of a district known as Beehuk; found by Fraser a field of ruins, with the tombs of several saints of Islam alone preserved, said to have been built by Sasan ben Buhman.\n\nRewaduh, probably the Rewat of the Maps.\n\nEsfurayun, a district thirty or forty miles N. E. of Subzwar, both names are now used in common. The Nozhut-ul-Koloob mentions a large stone vase of four yards in diameter as a curiosity.\n\nKhuer Khan very doubtful, unless it be Khur or Khuer Shah twenty miles from Azadwar on the road to Neeshapoor, a place of the district of Joweeruh once a portion of Beehuk.\n\nZurmuluh unknown and doubtful.\n\nToos, is recorded by Fraser as exhibiting a large area of debris surrounded by walls yet standing. The name and indeed the city are ascribed to Toos ben Nuozur. This city has been ever celebrated as the birth or resting-place of men of talents or of piety. The poet Ferdousee, and numerous Mohummudan saints are buried within its walls.\n\nRadgan seen by Fraser about forty-three miles W. by N. of Mushud.\n\nTaburoon, Burooghoor, Nookan, Sunabad.\u2014The modern town of Mushud, now a place of pilgrimage, has entirely arisen on the proceeds of the shrine; it must occupy the position of the Sunabad mentioned, the little detail given by our author of the shrine with the absence of all mention of the tomb of Ferdousee at Toos, point to a date prior to which the work must have been written.\n\nMerv.\n\nWe have some account of this place in the travels of Sir Alexander Burnes and party. They arrived at the river thirty miles below the city and found it a fine stream, eighty yards wide, five feet deep. The country between the Oxus and this point having been a dry arid plain. But round the town of Merv were scattered for miles the remains of ancient forts and villages, with the marks of extensive cultivation; when this existed, the waters of the river were nearly exhausted for irrigation. The houses of the villages and\ntowns were all of un-burnt bricks, the population resided chiefly in black felt tents; a few families of Jews were found in several of the larger places.\n\nThe country continued to rise in level from the Oxus until reaching Surukhs\u2014a ruined town of mud houses under a fort on a hillock of no importance. The population had changed from the fixed habits of towns to the wandering propensities of the tents. The distance was calculated as 125 miles from the Charjoe ferry of the Oxus to Merv, and 68 thence to Surukhs. The waters of Surukhs are from a river called Tejend, rising in the hills lying to the North of Neeshapoor and hence unlikely to be joined by a river like the Hureerood coming from the opposite direction on the South side of the range. The lands about Surukhs were considered to be fertile to an extraordinary degree: the place was able to send forth 4000 horsemen. All the splendour narrated by our Arabian author had disappeared before the ravages of the contending Tatar and Tork tribes. The clay-built houses had melted away under snow and rain, the canals were choked up, the fields affording precarious subsistence to wandering hordes of Toorcomun robbers. From Surukhs to Mushud was considered 64 miles. Capt. Abbott gives to the lands of Merv 2,400 square miles, a population of 60,000 Toorkoman families, paying two lacs of rupees per annum, revenue.\n\nKurahee, is here distinguished from the Kurshee of Bokhara and is given in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob as four marches or twenty-five furukhs from Merv.\n\nWalee Maoonuh. The only point of comparison I can reach is this\u2014on the Huj road to Mecca exists a celebrated well, called the Bere Maoonuh, on the waters of which the pilgrims much depend, hence the Meerab or Canal Master of Merv may be considered as of equal importance to the owner of this well.\n\nArched Room.\u2014This place is mentioned in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob.\n\nMamoon.\u2014Merv was also the capital, subsequently, of the Seljook dynasty.\n\nSurukhs is given in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob as founded by Afraseyab, and watered by a continuation of the rivers, both of Herat and Toos. The extraordinary fecundity of the soil is extolled, that one man would return one hundred muns, and either from the roots or\nthe scattered seed, thirty more could be collected in the following season.\n\nHerat.\n\nThe city has been altered since this description was written, the names of the gates, of the canals, and of the villages given in the translation are such as I believe to be intended and to be correct, I have compared them with the names given in many books. Marabad is the Marwan of the Map.\n\nEsfezar\u2014Arthur Conolly mentions Kooshuk as a small fort situated in a fertile plain of twenty miles in breadth.\n\nSubzwar is a town of one thousand houses.\n\nPooshung was the capital of the family of Taher, which for several generations was all-powerful in Khorasan. The Nozhut-ul-Koloob contains Kooswee, Khushruogird, and Burooh as its subdivisions, the second I adopt and the latter may have connection with Burkurduh. But Mohun Lal mentions Furuhabad to the South of Khaff, which is about the requisite position, and points to Furuhgerd as the correct reading, perhaps Ferhadgerd.\n\nKooswee was passed by Arthur Conolly in ruins, at seventy miles from Herat. It was once a place of importance and stood a long siege from Jungeez Khan.\n\nUrur, one dictionary offers the Surv or cypress-tree for this word.\n\nHureerood, it appears to be settled, that this river does not run so far as to reach Surukhs; and its junction with the Tajend to be a misconception, or at any rate doubtful, as the country rises from Herat towards Mushud.\n\nBadghues\u2014the readings with the exception of Koh are nearly all confirmed by the Nozhut-ul-Koloob. The district is an extensive one to the North of Herat.\n\nHujestan is noted in a history of Herat.\n\nGunjrostak appears to form a large division of country lying between Badghues and the Moorghab river.\n\nBughshoor.\u2014The Nozhut-ul-Kolook has Buhreshoor in the required position\u2014which is about the Awsharuh of Wyld\u2019s map. Native authority is in favour of Bughshoor\u2014I incline to Buhreshoor.\n\nBuen and Kuef are unknown.\n\nMeevbrood appears never to have been visited, hence many of the subdivisions cannot be identified.\nUkhnuf bin Kues\u2014a celebrated Arab leader of early period, the place is identified in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob at three fursukhs from Mervrood.\n\nTalkan lies 18 fursukhs east of Merv, yet this meanly mentioned place took the entire army of Jungeez Khan seven months to capture.\n\nFaryab stands at 40 fursukhs East of Merv on the Bulkh road.\n\nJoojan is a large district between Merv-road and Bulk round Muemoonuh as a centre.\n\nUnbar, we have a place in Ezzut Allah, and on the maps, and constantly mentioned by horse-dealers, Ulmar, which may be the Unbar indicated by the text; and the Humber of Wyld\u2019s map.\n\nYahoodeyuh, a large body of Jews are known to have accompanied the armies of Seleucus, and to have been settled near Merv; this Yahoodeyuh may constitute their location.\n\nGhorgestan; it was a most difficult affair to reach the meaning of this sentence, but I find it mentioned in the fourth volume of the Rozut-ul-sufa that the people of Ghorgestan called their kings, Shar, even as Torks use Khan, and Hindus Rae. I can offer no confirmations of my readings, except that Wyld\u2019s map contains a place called Soormeen though not quite in the position required.\n\nNess, Furawuh, are known by name but not identified.\n\nKohestan.\u2014Jonabad, is the Arabised form of Goonabad, a town said to have been constructed by a son of Goodurz. It is defended by a fort on an eminence.\n\nTubus called Geeluk appears to be the Tubus of Wyld\u2019s map to the West of Kaen, it is said in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob to be seven days\u2019 march from Yezd, a distance which Captain Christie covered in that time, and calls about 145 miles\u2014this traveller skirted the district of Kohestan, and indicates the want of water, the deserts of sand, but no absolute deficiency of supplies.\n\nKaen is put down as a large city of a warm climate, and very fruitful, in Lat. 33\u00b0 40\u2032; the inhabitants are very warlike and possessing each man, instruments of war.\n\nA more modern work gives the subdivisions of Kohestan as Choon, Toon, Tubus, Dushtebeyaz, Neyarjan, Moomenabad, Shakhuen, Jonabad, Zeerkoh, Peeshawur.\nThis district became the centre of the noted sect or tribe of Esmaeluh or Mulahehuh; the assassins of European story.\n\n**Bulkh.**\n\nBulkh is considered to be the capital of the ancient Bactria. In Moslem history, this city has ever been highly celebrated, even called the Paradise of the world. The old ramparts and castle, went by the name of the Hindoo fort, it was destroyed by Ukhnnf ben Kues, a new city then arose under the order of Aboo-Moslem the governor of Khorasan. On the high road of contending armies, its vicissitudes have been numerous; it now lies under the ban of \"ruin and decay with no remains of interest beyond its name.\" The numerous gates mentioned, will be of the fort and of the town. The designation to the hills of Koo, is a fragment probably of Hindoo Koosh\u2014or may be Gor or Guz the last I take as the valley of the Bulkhab is called Guz.\n\nSumungan, according to Moorcroft is now designated Uebuk\u2014\"the first view of Uebuk was rather imposing, presenting a castle on an insulated eminence\"\u2014it proved to be in ruins, but to possess some claims indicative of its antiquity.\n\nWurwageer is doubtful, by the distance and bearing, it would fall near the position of the modern Kundooz in the direct line from Bulkh to Budukshan.\n\nShuboorgan is mentioned by Marco Polo.\n\nWukhsh, the arch type of Oxus is apparently beyond the river of that name, lying N. W. from the stream at no great distance.\n\nKhotul.\u2014The Khotlan of the maps, is a large district lying on the bend of the Oxus above Budukshan, near the spot marked Durwas\u2014the town of the name is mentioned in the Nozhut-ul-Koloob as an important place but in ruins.\n\nKhuryab has a local authority attached, as Khurgeez the wandering tribes of the steppes of the Poslite Khur of the Pameer range.\n\nBudukshan is a well understood district, the Balashan of Marco Polo.\n\nTalkan is \"a small place under a fort of no importance,\" perhaps four hundred houses.\n\nEshkemesh is probably the Scassem of Polo, but Wood places an\nBakhshem to the East of Fuezabad, which better answers the position required by the Venetian.\n\nBudukshan town, according to Wood, \"hardly a vestige remains of the modern capital, Fuezabad\" which once occupied a commanding position on the left bank of the Koksha or Khur river.\n\nWakan is clearly the Vokan of Polo, whose description is most wonderfully authenticated at a distance of six centuries by the highly interesting narrative of Capt. Wood of the Indian Navy\u2014a companion of Burnes.\n\nGharan is mentioned by Wood as the district of the ruby mines, which are located on the South face of the mountains of Shughnoon, the Sikinan of Polo who also notices the same fact.\n\nRubies.\u2014Budukshan has ever been celebrated for the rubies and lapis lazuli of its mines.\n\nJaryanuh\u2014I adopt in preference to Haryanuh, on the authority of Wood, who mentions the district and village of I-angheran at the South end of the Perwan and Punjheer valleys.\n\nPunjheer, exactly as described by Wood, and has not improved since the days of our Arabian author, except perhaps in population, as the former gentleman considers the valley could turn out 10,000 armed men. The fort of Khawak captured by Timoor is situated near the top of the pass.\n\nBameeyan.\u2014The reader is rather surprised to find no mention of the celebrated idols cut in the hill-side.\n\nKabul.\u2014The fort with one entrance is probably that now known as the Akabeen or upper fort of Kabul, now but little used, being the enclosed summit of the range which would otherwise command the modern fort.\n\nLushghorkund is most likely the modern Lhoghur.\n\nGhor, is now occupied by Huzaruhs who speak very pure Persian. Sar of Torkestan is doubtful.\n\nGhoz tribes, they were located on the sources of the Utturuk river.\n\nMost of my readings are acknowledged by men of Bokhara to be such as they have heard mentioned, but several names are extremely doubtful as Sukalkund, Wurwageer, Undechuragh and others.\n\u0648\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u062e\u0631\u0627\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0625\u0646\u0647\u0627

drawing. By WELBY JACKSON, Esq., Vice-President, Asiatic Society.\n\nThis plate represents a very curious piece of sculpture in high relief which was laid before the Asiatic Society by order of the Governor General; the size is 6 inches by 6\u00bd inches; and the material, a dark Pot-Stone containing mica. The subject of the piece is a \"Warrior King on horseback:\" under the forefeet of his horse is apparently one of the conquered, holding and supporting the horse's forefeet in his hands: the horseman wears a close tunic with sleeves, and a scarf hangs loosely across him and over his left arm: his legs are covered with drapery which, from the position of the folds, seems to resemble the dhoti of India: he raises his right hand held open to a level with his head, the thumb upwards; an attitude common in ancient Bactrian coins, and in Greek and Etruscan figures: the horse is caparisoned, with a plume on his front, which seems to wave backwards as he advances; a circular disk behind the head of the horseman has the appearance of a shield;\u2014and over his head is\na Chhattrra or umbrella, the emblem of royalty in the east;\u2014three attendants accompany him; one preceding him dressed in scale armour, which was common among the Persians, a kilt or continuous portion of the \u1f51\u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 or lorica in the Greek fashion, and a sword held under his left arm; he wears the same lower drapery, as the horseman: behind this foot soldier is another, whose action cannot be made out, though they both look towards the principal figure; another attendant behind seems to hold Chhattrra over the horseman:\u2014the whole is executed with much spirit and effect; the heads are of a Greek form, and resemble in character that represented in Plate 20, No. 230 of this Journal: the head-dress is precisely the same as regards the horseman and the principal attendant who precedes him, that is, an ornamental cap, which allows the hair to appear in curls over the ears;\u2014the heads of the other attendants differ slightly; and that of the figure under the horse's feet, is without covering; it has also a beard, while the other four have only moustaches. This relief is probably of the same period as the head represented in No. 230 of this Journal; and was found in the same vicinity; but this is a work chiselled in stone, while the other was merely of stucco. It is perhaps part of a long frieze representing a triumphal procession. On the upper part there is a projection by which it has been fastened into its place on a wall, and a similar projection, a tenon, has been broken off below.\n\nThere are several coins of Azes and Undopherres and other kings of the Arian and Bactrian races, bearing the representation of a horseman holding out the right hand in the position of the principal figure in this relief; which is no doubt intended to represent a victory or perhaps rather a conquest, as the vanquished is unarmed; and if so, probably there would be an inscription or some distinctive mark or monogram on some part of the building to which it belongs, indicative of the time and the king to whom it refers; it is a subject of the greatest interest, and well deserves the attention of those who have an opportunity of carefully examining the site where it was found and the vicinity of it: all the information hitherto obtained on this point is, that it was found near Kohat.\nThe first volume of the original text of Tabary.\u2014By Dr. A. SPRENGER.\n\nIn the library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, No. 443 is an old MS. on the margin of the first page of which the words \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0649 are written in an old hand, but not in the hand of the copyist, and it has consequently been entered in the Society's catalogue under this title. On examination it turns out to be a very considerable portion of the first volume of the original text of Tabary. This is proved by the fact that Ibn Homayd is constantly quoted, as the informant of the author, and observations on the original traditions, which compose the body of the works, are in the fashion of Tabary preceded by the words \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0628\u0649. To these words, the formula \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 are added, which might shake our faith in the identity of the work, but it is clear they are the additions of the pious copyist.\n\nThe volume is not only incomplete (there are six or fourteen leaves wanting in the commencement) but the book-binder has displaced the leaves. It is in small 4to., 216 pp. of 17 lines, written in a clear, old and correct hand. The contents do not appear sufficiently important to deserve more than a summary notice. The author treats of the creation, of time, of the eternity of God, of the first thing created, of the day on which the creation was begun, of the order in which day and night, sun and moon were created, of Iblis and the fallen angels, of the history of Adam. He gives a short account of Kay\u00famarth (the end of this Chapter is wanting, or displaced by the book-binder) the death of Adam, the history of Seth and his times, a few words on Tahmirath the successor of Hushang, Idris, Noah and the flood, Bay\u00far\u00e1sh that is to say al-Azdah\u00e1q, whom the Arabs call Dhall\u00e1q, the history of Noah continued, the times from Noah to Abraham. This is the last chapter of the book. It would perhaps be worth while to extract from it the legends of the Persians contained in it.\nA few Remarks on the subject of the Laterite found\n\nBy Capt. C. B. Young, Bengal Engi.\n\nSir,\u2014I take the liberty of troubling you with a\nthe subject of the Laterite which abounds in the\nRangoon.\n\nThe hilly country of upper Ava ceases with th\nKyouktaran near Lunzay below Prome, and from\nthe Irrawaddy flows through a rich alluvial Delta.\n\nUnlike that of the Ganges, however, this is var\nrising eminences and ridges, and upon one of these\nof Rangoon is situated, the platform of which is 1f\nriver, the Pagoda itself rising 320 feet above that a,\n\nThese eminences are chiefly, if not entirely, com\nThe lower plain country consists of clay and sand;\npredominating, and the former sometimes of a ver\nkind like pipe-clay. (Vide specimens.) The surfi\nclayey or alluvial, but in making cuttings, as in dig\nroads, it is usual to find the soil at a small depth b\ngravelly. On examination, this is found to arise\nconcretions, similar to kunkur, some of a brick-red\ncolour. In some places the red predominate, in\nforming strata running in waving directions though\ncolours are exhibited owing to the nodules being cr\ntool in the act of digging.\n\nThe nodules themselves when picked out of the e\ntions of the local coloured clay, round nuclei of the b\ncentre, and around that the redder material; both h\nappearance of owing their origin to an infusion of i\n\nDeeper down the nodules speedily become more\nat last the whole, from the nodules joining and a\nfirmly together, leaving at the same time numerou\ngularly shaped between them, assumes the appear\nclay iron-stone, stites, or, as it has been called\nbreccia. In this shape it may be dug out and han\nmasses, but these may be readily broken with the\nby hand. In a more advanced state, it becomes st\nand rock-like, tougher and heavier, and in short has all the characteristics and appearances of the more vesicular or spongiform species of Laterite. In other places and under other circumstances, its structure becomes more uniform and compact, and of this kind is that of the hill on which the Rangoon Great Pagoda itself stands, and that from Bassein, where also it appears to be generally redder in colour.\n\nSpecimens of all these, I have the pleasure to send you. Under all these forms, as may be imagined, this stone is very useful. In its early nodular state, it is thrown out together with the clay of the bed or matrix in which it is found, on to the surface of our roads, and when the latter is washed away by the rains, the nodules remain like kunkur, forming an excellent firm road. In its more advanced and perfect form, it is quarried in blocks, and hardening with the characteristic quality of Laterite, it is used as in the flight of steps to the Great Pagoda, where, although frequently more than usually spongiform, it withstands admirably the unceasing tread of thousands passing over it.\n\nIt must no doubt have been among the specimens sent home by Mr. Crawford in 1826, and is, I suppose, that which is called by Dr. Buckland in his most interesting paper on Mr. Crawford's Fossils and specimens, breccia; as he writes of this, that it is cemented sometimes by carbonate of lime, sometimes by hydrate of iron, and \"where this iron is very abundant, it affords concentric ochreous concretions resembling \u00e6tites, dispersed irregularly through the breccia.\"\n\nAlthough the stone certainly gains greatly in weight in its progressive states and also in hardness, yet this latter quality appears to arise almost wholly from exposure to the air; and its intrinsic toughness is by no means, that which an ore of iron should have. Nor does it affect the magnetic needle in any way after exposure to the blowpipe.\n\nIts specific gravity, taking pieces of medium formation, and the mean of three experiments, gives 2.858, which is not great.\n\nThe red and black small masses or concretions are, at all times readily scratched with the nail. It cannot be called \u00e6tites; there are no looser particles in it: and scarcely with truth I think breccia, for that is a compound stone, consisting of agglutinated fragments.\nThe fragments of this are neither, irregular masses minerals intimately blended, nor, secondly, are they existing rocks united by a cement. These are generally the only two classes, I believe, of breccias.\n\nAnalyses of the various parts of this rock and of the give the following results.\n\nThe aluminous soil generally contains 50 per cent richer kinds as much as 65 to 70.\n\nA detailed analysis of specimens of the rock Mr James, 32nd N., I.* of the Museum of Economic Ge following result.\n\nMean Result of three Analyses of Laterite from Soluble in Acids.\n\nPeroxide of Iron, ...........................................\nAlumina, .......................................................\nLime, ............................................................\nMagnesia, .......................................................\nSilica, ............................................................\n\nInsoluble in Acids.\n\nSilica (dissolved by Potash,) .......................\nSilica (by fusion,) ...........................................\nLime, Iron and Alumina, ...............................\nCombined Water Alkalies and Loss, ..............\n\n* The following is an extract from Capt. James' letter:\u2014\n\n\"I send you an analysis of the Laterite which I have made very\n\n\"It is the mean result of three analyses, all of which came\n\none of the other. You will perceive by the quantity of iron it\n\nwould be well worth smelting if coal and limestone could be obta\n\n\"It yields about 32 per cent. of metallic iron, and I shall ame\n\nhave remaining to see what quality of iron it is.\n\n\"The quality of hardening by exposure which the laterite poss\n\ndue to the silica which exists in a soluble state by potash, and\n\nproperty is due in all hydraulic limes.

This would also assist it in hardening.\n\n\"I have been assisted in my analysis by an assistant of Lyon\n\nvery clever chemist, so you may depend upon the result being q\n\n\"I have sent the analysis of the laterite to Col. Sykes, request\n\nhave one that was made for him some time ago.\"\nThe analysis of a proportion of a black stratum in its neighbourhood bearing quite the appearance of a carbonaceous or vegetable mould, gave moisture 18.3 in 100 parts, and on being calcined to a red heat, animal or organic matter 1.6 only, the remainder having the colour and appearance of powdered brick.\n\nParticles taken carefully out, having more than usual the appearance of concretions of lime, gave however on trial with sulphuric-acid no indication of it.\n\nFrom the foregoing, this rock appears to be chiefly silica and iron bound together, by some agent acting chemically on it, although at the same time, there can be no doubt that the clay of the rich aluminous soil, in which it rests and is formed, is in some way necessary to the process. In some of the rising grounds near the Rangoon stockade, I have found a plain soft clay-slate which gathering the ochreous tint or infusion, seems to swell into lumps or small masses, and from that to pass into the regular concretionary or gravelly form in which I have described the stone itself as being found in its first stages, and which we use for roads, and in this pebbly form it may be found covering the surface of most of the hillocks and mounds about Rangoon. What the infused agent may be I am unable at present with my imperfect means to ascertain. If this rock be then, as it has all the appearance of being, true laterite, we have it here forming under our feet, and laterite cannot be supposed to be igneous, but is evidently, like other rocks which have been erroneously attributed to volcanic sources, of chemical origin.\n\nI have found in it myself small shells, but no sufficiently decided specimen as yet to pronounce confidently on, and the superintending Surgeon here informed me that he had seen at Moulmain, in the side of an excavation for a dry dock, pieces of pottery imbedded in it. Quartz and other pebbles are common in it. It may be perhaps that as the flints in chalk and our kunkur are nodular formations of silica and of lime, so this represents a similar nucleous concretionary form of a richly aluminous soil, and that flints, kunkur and laterite are the results of a similar chemical process acting respectively upon calcareo-silicious, silicio-calcareous and alumino-silicious earths.\n\nSpecimens of rocks of various kinds are found at Rangoon, but the only one in situ is the plastic clay-like pipe-clay which occurs to the\nnorth of the pagoda mixed with strata of a rough silicious matter inclined at an angle of 15\u00b0 to the N. E.\n\nMarble and alabaster from the Ava (Sagaing) quarries are plentiful, the former, which Chantrey pronounced to be equal to the finest Carrara, particularly so; the latter which is equally beautiful and pure, is less plentiful.\n\nLimestone is not found nearer to Rangoon than the Martaban district, and the mountains in the neighbourhood of Pegu whence it is imported, and used in great quantities for the temples. It is not found about Prome.\n\nFrom the same part of the country (Prome) come a variety of sandstones which are used for domestic purposes by the Burmese. Some are freestones of a fine clear even colour and very easily cut.\n\nI have also found boulder specimens of travertine and a rock like clay-slate, but whether these will be found hereafter up the course or not, I cannot say.\n\nOne specimen only but a good one of petrified wood has been found. It was presented by Major Fraser to the Governor-General. Doubtless we shall find more of these hereafter.\n\nChlorite used as slate-pencil by the Burmese is found near Prome.\n\nA handsome syenite also occurs, which will, I believe, be met with near Ava; and what appears to be a decomposed granite which comes, as I am told, from Shoegeen and Lao country. This I have found but in specimen of. It contains much felspar and at one time I thought I detected grains of gold in it, which seemed a not improbable occurrence.\n\nI have little doubt that when we get better acquainted with the northern districts, coal which belongs to the formation will be found and added to the already large mineral wealth of the country, which, including Lao and the Tenasserim provinces, supplies gold, silver, rubies, sapphires, copper, zinc, tin, lead, iron, petroleum, antimony, marble, alabaster, &c. &c. If to these be added its teak, cotton and indigo, it should, with the aid of such a water carriage be a probable and valuable acquisition to the Indian empire.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nC.

Muir, Esq., forwarding a Meteorological Register from the Secretariat office at Agra, for the month of December.\n\nBowring, Esq., sending a facsimile of a Sanscrit inscription found near Thanesar.\n\nBowring is Mr. B.'s account of the way in which he discovered the inscription.\n\nThe pleasure to send you a copy of an inscription written on a tablet of red sandstone in the temple of a Goraknath persuasion, in the town of Pehewa, which is about nine miles west of Thanesar. I was marching from Patiala towards Lahore and halted at Pehewa which is on the banks of the Sutlej, and is a place of pilgrimage of some note, having been known under the name of Prithudak. It is included in the sacred territory known as the 40 kos, that is, the four points of the compass where the skirmishes of the Pandavas were carried on. The inscription was copied after my departure by the Thanadar of Pehewa, you will observe, reversed. I am not sure whether it be legible, as a part of the inscription is effaced. I believe, however, that there may be interesting matter in it.\n\nI am not aware whether the Society has ever been furnished with an account of Thanesar, which bears marks of great antiquity, considered particularly sacred on account of the celebrated Kurukshetra. I obtained an interesting notice of it from the Brahmins of the place.\n\nI have heard of a town of Samana, of which the ruins are very extensive, a very remarkable spot, in which many coins and traces of buildings are found. It is about 30 miles W. N. W. of Lahore, and in the Patiala territory.\n\nC. Bayley, Esq., announcing that he has heard of an inscription at a place called Khunniarah, and is trying to get a facsimile of the same for the Society. With reference to the Kotuch Kings of Kangra, which he alluded to earlier, he states\u2014\n\"I am working at the Kotuch Kings, but find the Bans\u00e1valis so manifestly fictitious, or at least so incorrect, that it will take me much time and trouble to reconcile discrepancies; meanwhile, I have from coins the following names, Rupchand, Prithichand, Harichand, Sringachand, Trilokchand, Avat\u00e1rchand, and at least two others not yet quite deciphered.\n\n\"I am not quite certain yet as to their actual period, but they range from 1100 to 1400 or 1450, A.D. I think;\u2014probably from 1200 or 1250 to 1400.\n\n\"From Dhurmchand, who was contemporary with Akbar, the native histories are pretty accurate and detailed, but they admit everything earlier to be uncertain. Even the present representative of the Kotuch race told me, I probably knew more than he did, but pointed out one old purohit who, he thought, might know something if he could be persuaded to show his documents.\n\n\"The history of the Pathania Rajpoot, the family of the Noorpoor Rajahs, is also curious, and I will endeavour a sketch of it with that of the Kotuches. They claim descent from the old Tuars of Delhi, and are said to have got their present appellation because three of their kings in succession were employed by the Mogul emperors in subduing the \"Pathans\" of Afghanistan. Of one of these I have contemporary Hindu history. By the way, his death is said to have given rise to the name of the 'Hindu kosh.' I don't know if the story has been published before; if not, it may be worth the Society's notice.\n\n\"It is said this Rajah was ordered to march in winter by some very dangerous pass in the range to effect a surprise of some enemy on the other side.\n\n\"On entering the pass with his army (of his own Rajpoot clans) he was told that there is such danger of avalanches, that it was absolutely necessary to enjoin strict silence throughout his ranks.\n\n\"He is said to have replied to the effect that he was a Rajpoot and himself a deota, and would show fear of neither man nor spirit, and so far from enjoining silence on his men, directed that they should march with every trumpet sounding and every drum beating.\n\n\"They proceeded accordingly, and as the sun rose the avalanches descended, and overwhelmed the Rajah and five thousand of his devoted host.\"\n\"From this the pass originally, and subsequently the range reported to have received the name of 'Hindu kosh,' the Hindu slayer: as good a derivation at least as any I have heard before.\"\n\nFrom Captain Layard, forwarding a notice of an ancient Kurnosapuri, now called R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101ti. The notice merely gives the traditions handed down regarding this city.\n\nThe Curator of the Museum of Economic Geology and the Librarian submitted their usual monthly reports; the former also read a supplementary note on the new Mineral Resin Hircine.\n\nOn the termination of the proceedings of the evening, Major Kitson delivered a lecture on the antiquities of Sarnath, and exhibited a series of drawings of ancient sculptures from that neighbourhood and from other parts of the Benares and Behar districts.\n\nThe President in the name of the Society thanked Major Kitson for his highly interesting lecture, when the meeting adjourned.\n\nRead and confirmed, March 2nd, 1853\n\n(Signed) J. W. Colville\n\nReport by the Curator of the Museum, Economic Geology.\n\nMinerological and Geological. Our Secretary has sent me for examination some specimens mostly of laterite and lateritous clays and conglomerates, from Rangoon, forwarded by Captain C. B. Young, B. E. The catalogue of them is as follows.\n\nSpecimens of Soils, &c. from Rangoon.\n\nNos. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Lateritous clay, probably the debris of laterite becoming again consistent by the solution of the ferruginous part.\n\n5 and 6. There is but one piece of these specimens, which I should allow to be true laterite, and this I find to contain\n\nPeroxide of Iron, .................................................. 47.50\nSiliceous and Aluminous residuum, ......................... 52.50\n\nNo trace of Manganese or Lime, ............................. 100.00\n\nThe other specimens of these two numbers are nearly the debris of laterite cohering again as above, and in this case becoming conglomerate by the mixture of quartzose pebbles; they should be styled lateritic conglomerates.\n\n7. Coarse-grained, highly ferruginous, sandstone; almost a siliceous iron ore in appearance.\n\n8. Ferruginous nodules probably from the laterite.\n9. Dark earthy soil coloured by a mixture of deutoxide and peroxide of iron.\n\n10. Sandstone grit coloured by iron.\n\n11. Plastic clay, contains protoxide of iron.\n\n12. Same as No. 11 in thin laminae.\n\n13. A coarse-grained pegmatite, (i.e. quartz and felspar) decomposing.\n\nN.B. There is a very singular-looking cellular, brittle, black substance in very small quantity adhering firmly to the outer part of this specimen. There is too little of it to sacrifice except for minute assays: I should like to have more of this.\n\n14. Granite and not a Syenite: the black mineral being black mica and not hornblende; there is, however, embedded in this specimen some minute nests of Actinolite or pumice. They are too small to admit of examination, but I should like to have a larger specimen or two of this granite if procurable.\n\nMuseum of Economic Geology.\n\nI received from Major Baker, with the following, the specimen of iron ore now on the table to which it alludes.\n\nSeptember 20th, 1852.\n\nH. PIDDINGTON, Esq.\n\nMy dear Sir,\u2014May I request the favour of your furnishing me at your convenience with an analysis of the accompanying specimen of ore, and with your opinion of its economical value under the following circumstances. The deposit of which this is a specimen is from the Hill of Karana, about ten miles from Lahore and not far removed from extensive jungle of firewood; coal in limited quantities is believed to exist in two localities of which one is hundred miles, and the other fifty miles distant from the site of the ore. Will you do me the favour to return the specimens when you have taken off what you require for the purpose of analysis.\n\nYour's faithfully,\n\n(Signed) W. E. BAKER.\n\nAnd having sent him an analysis and reply to his queries. I have subsequently received the following memorandum, by Mr. Purdon, from Colonel Napier.\n\nMemorandum to accompany some specimens of iron ore forwarded to Lieut.-Col. H. Napier, Civil Engineer, Punjab.\n\nAbout the centre of the Sithe Chuj Doab, twenty-three miles South-East of Shahpore, rise abruptly a number of conical-shaped knolls; the highest, and principal, called Karana, attains an elevation of about 1200 feet above the plain. This hill occupies an area from West to East in\nlength about three miles, in breadth scarcely one. None of the knolls are near so extensive, nor do they attain one half the height. The dip of Karana is North to North-West, under an angle of about 35\u00b0, of the salt range being about 15\u00b0 locally higher;* the strike of both is the same, the distance between forty miles.\n\nThe rock of which these knolls are composed is a compact schist or sandstone, passing into clay-slate or argillaceous schist, of a various yellowish leaden colour, it has somewhat the appearance of Granweld, and bears occasional marks.*\n\nThe Hill is intersected by veins of Quartz with Iron ore (Hematite), thickness of the vein seldom exceeds six inches of which about 2\u00bd inches are iron ore.\n\nWithout a thorough examination of the Hill, it is not possible to say in what quantity the ore occurs, though it appears abundant.\n\nIt is difficult to determine at present, the exact age of this formation, whether it belongs to the old red or a still more ancient group, but, the Hill is of older date than the rocks of the salt-range there can be little doubt, as in this latter no rock of a metamorphic character is found.\n\nPied Dadum Khan, (Signed) W. Purdon,\nThe 11th Nov. 1852. On special Duty\n\n(True Copy.)\n(Signed.) T. G. Glover, Lt., Engr.\nAssistant to the Civil Engineer.\n\nThe following is my report on this remarkable ore and my replies to queries, sent to Major Baker for transmission to Col. Napier.\n\nTo Major Baker, B. E.\n\nDear Sir,\u2014I have carefully examined the Iron ore from Karana accompanying your letter of 20th September. Indisposition has prevented my completing my analysis of it so perfectly as I could desire, and your early departure prevents me from being quite so precise as to the minor constituents as I could have wished.\n\nIts composition in 100 parts taken as fairly as possible from the specimens of ore, to avoid the quartz with which it is mixed, I find to be as follows:\n\nWater and Carb. Acid, ......................... 8.50\nSilex, ........................................... 11.32\nAlumina, ....................................... none\nMagnesia, ...................................... 0.50\nCarbonate of Lime, ............................. 65.14\n\n* So in MSS. H. P.\nIron Peroxide, ......................21.85\nOr Protoxide, ..........................\nManganese (?) ...........................\n\n19.66 { Metallic Iron.\n15.29.\n\n0.10\n\n100.12\n\nYou will thus perceive that this ore is a remarkable instance of what is termed in Mineralogy Isomorphism; i.e. an ore with all the appearances of one kind of Mineral (in this case of a rich carbonate of iron) but in which it is found upon analysis that one of the constituents has been partly or wholly replaced by some other mineral. The proportions of iron and lime here are exactly changed, i.e. we should look to find the main ingredient to be about the 65 per cent. of protoxide of iron, instead of that amount of lime which now takes its place, leaving us 20 per cent. of protoxide of iron representing 15.3 per cent. of Metallic iron only!\n\nThe ore then proves to be almost a ferruginous carbonate of lime, but as it is only a surface specimen, one part being evidently weathered, it may become richer at a moderate depth, if a vein, or in a lower bed, if in beds; for this, the first question as to iron ores in a mining point of view, is not stated.\n\nAs to its produce; at present it is clearly too poor an ore to be smelted, though it would probably yield iron of the very finest description but if a richer ore is found near the spot, it will then be of great value to smelt with it, the lime and the small portion of Magnesia being the best fluxes and the Manganese improving the quality of the produce.\n\nWith regard to the yield of any Indian iron ore the first question is always, \"What is to be the process and furnace adopted?\" and who are to be the workmen?\" for from the complex and expensive English blast works, to the plain but simple Catalan and French Pyrannean forges, which produce some of the finest iron and steel in the world with the simplest means, every thing depends, as you know, on the furnace and the workman. If Major Napier sends us a promising ore he will perhaps also say by what process he thinks of working it.\n\nI return your specimen as you desire, but it would be an acquisition for the Museum.*\n\nH. PIDDINGTON,\nCur. Mus. Eco. Geology.\n\nMuseum, 26th October, 1852.\n\nI have received from Captain Ramsay, Acting Resident at Nepaul, a small collection of the woods of Nepaul, presented by General Jung Bahadur, who has also sent a large collection (96 specimens) of rocks and minerals\n\n* Major Baker has presented it to the Museum.\nwhich will be farther noticed when examined. I may mention here however that there is certainly one new metallic mineral amongst them.\n\nFrom Dr. Martin of the Eye Infirmary, we have received three very fine specimens of marble and magnesian limestone from Assam, but the locality is not given.\n\nI have embodied in a supplementary notice to my paper on Hireine a very interesting account of that substance from the Rev. Mr. Dawson of Rangoon, which, as will be seen, proves my conjecture, that it was a mineral resin, to be correct, and it is certainly a new one.\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following books have been added to the Library since December last.\n\nPresented.\n\nAnglo-Burmese Hand-Book, or Guide to a practical knowledge of the Burmese language, compiled by Dormor Augustus Chase.

Assistant Surgeon, 4th Regt. Punjab Cavalry. In charge of the Geological Survey of the Salt Range in the Punjab. Season 1851-52.\n\n(Communicated by the Govt. of India.)\n\nPreliminary Remarks.\n\nIn compliance with the instructions received at Maree on the Indus, on the 14th February 1851, from the Most Noble the Governor General, I have endeavoured to make such an examination of the Salt Range as will enable His Lordship in Council to judge as to the exact character of its mineral wealth.\n\nThe results of this examination have been embodied in the accompanying Report.\n\nFrom unavoidable circumstances I was unable to commence the regular survey of the Range, until the end of February 1851, and owing to the heat was obliged to cease work in the middle of April.\n\nOn the 1st November 1851, the survey was again renewed, and the sanction of Government having been obtained for the construction of a Sketch map of the Salt Range (the want of which to guide us in our survey has been severely felt), Mr. William Purdon (1st Assistant), aided by Mr. William Theobald (2nd Assistant), was directed to devote his attention to its construction. The map here-with submitted is the result of their labours during the cold weather of 1851-52, to the end of which period the duration of the survey was limited.\nThe map is I believe the first which has ever been made of the Salt Range from a regular survey, and for its accuracy Mr. Purdon is alone responsible. I trust it will supply a want in all maps of the Punjab hitherto published, in none of which, that I have seen, is even the general direction of the Range correctly laid down.\n\nThe geological examination of the Range has been executed entirely by myself, and in addition to that of the Salt Range proper, a rapid survey was made of its continuation in the range of hills which runs down the west bank of the Indus from Kalibag to Kafe Kote. I thus have been able to add considerably to our previous knowledge of the geology of the Punjab. A most interesting mass of hills called Kovana, which rise abruptly from the plain of the Jetch Doab, has also been examined.\n\nDuring the course of my labours I executed a rough military survey, with a hand prismatic compass, of the district passed over, from which I constructed for my own guidance a rough sketch map. This I have had copied and coloured geologically, by a Mr. Blaney, Eurasian draftsman, and herewith submit it as illustrative of my report.\n\nThe report itself will be found in many parts to be a repetition of the reports on the Salt Range I made to Government in 1848. These were drawn up after a very rapid inspection of the Range between Baghanwalla and Kalibag, in the month of April, a period of the year, when it is next to impossible to examine satisfactorily such hot and barren hills.\n\nIn the present report I have corrected several errors, the result of a too cursory examination of the strata, and have added very considerably to the matter of my previous reports.\n\nI regret that I am unable to announce the occurrence in the Salt Range of much mineral wealth, of the existence of which Government have not already been made aware.\n\nThe nature of the formations precludes the likelihood of any valuable metallic ores (we except those of iron) being found. The nature and character of the Coal deposits have been fully described, but, for reasons stated, we fear they will turn out of but little practical value.\n\nIn a scientific point of view, however, I would fain hope that much has been recorded which to Geologists will prove highly interesting.\nAs I was ordered to resume my medical duties at the close of my field work, it was necessary that the sections which accompany the report should be prepared before I separated from my assistants, who were directed to remain at Pind Dadun Khan.\n\nThese were hurriedly drawn in camp by Mr. Theobald from rough sketches made by myself in the field, and must be considered rather as sketches than true sections, which without the necessary data at the time as to heights and distances, it was impossible to have constructed.\n\nThe table of heights calculated from barometric and thermometric observations will, I trust, prove interesting as well as useful. I need hardly remark that they can only be considered as rough approximations.\n\nA complete collection, for submission to Government, of the rocks, minerals, and fossils collected during my survey has been prepared, and, in compliance with Government orders, collections, illustrative of the mineral wealth of the Salt Range, have also been made for the museums of the Asiatic Societies of Bengal and Bombay and of the Agra College.\n\nThe preparation of my report and the examination and arrangement of my specimens have occupied entirely my leisure hours during the past hot season. I am aware that numerous imperfections are to be found in it, but in judging of its merits or demerits, I trust it may be borne in mind, that I have been in a position where books of reference or collections for comparison are quite inaccessible, and have consequently been entirely dependent on my own resources.\n\n(Signed) A. Fleming, M.D.\n\nJhelum, Punjab, Sept. 2th, 1852.\n\nOn the General Physical features of the Salt Range in the Punjab.\n\nThe hills, generally included under the designation of the Punjab Salt Range, occur in the northern part of the Sinde Saugor Doab, or distinct between the rivers Jhelum and Indus, crossing it from E. to W. between the parallels of $32^\\circ 22'$ and $33^\\circ N$. Latitude and $71^\\circ 30'$ and $73^\\circ 30'$ E. Longitude.\nThe Salt Range may be considered as resulting from the union of three low independent ranges, subordinate to the Punchah branch of the Himalayas, which run towards the plain in a southerly direction.\n\nThe first or most easterly of these ranges runs along the left bank of the river Jhelum, and opposite the town on the line of the trunk road, receives the name of the Kharian Range. Further down the river this is known as the Pubbee Hills, and near Rasool, famous for the position of the Sheikh encampment after the battle of Chilliwalla, approaches the river, being evidently continuous with hills of similar character, which form its right bank between Darapoor and Jelalpoor, and which are locally designated Surafur.\n\nThe central or Rhotas range crosses the Peshawur road about 7 miles West of Jhelum, and stretches in a S. W. direction as far as the Boonah nullah. Here it takes a southerly turn, and under the name of Chumbah runs on to Jelalpoor, uniting in its course with the Kharian Range. The well known mountain Tillah, 18 miles S. W. of Jhelum, is the highest point of this range and not less than 3,000 feet above the level of the sea.\n\nThe western or Bukrals Range is separated from that of Rhotas by a ravine country about 10 miles in breadth. It runs parallel with the latter and after crossing the Boonah nullah at the Ghulamgulla Pass, forms the ridge known as Diljubba, the west end of which unites with the general map of hills forming the Salt Range.\n\nBy the union of the Kharian and Rhotas or Chumbul ranges at Jelalpur, a ridge is formed presenting a steep escarpment to the south and a highly inclined slope to the north, at this point it is about three miles distant from the Jhelum, an alluvial plain intervening, the height of which does not probably much exceed 600 feet above the sea, and which, as we proceed westward, gradually expands into the plain of the Sinde Saugor Doab.\n\nFrom Jelalpur the direction of the range is about west by southwest as far as Kuttaba. Here it takes a turn to the S. W. running in this direction as far as Jubbi, which is its most southerly point. From there for a distance of about six miles, it runs nearly due west to Cholistan and then gradually trends round to the north, running from Futtijab to the Indus in a N. W. direction. It maintains the same course\nfor about four miles on the west bank of the Indus, beyond which it gradually expands into the mass of hills, that stretch north between Bunnoo and Kohat, and are known as the Chountush Hills. The south-western portion of these along the west bank of the Indus, are elevated into a high ridge, presenting a steep escarpment to the east, evidently continuous with that of the Salt Range, and joining it near the village of Kooch four miles N. W. of Kalibag at nearly a right angle. This ridge known as the Chichalee Range runs in a direction S. S. W. towards the Koorum river, beyond which it may be said to be continuous with that of Kaffin Kote, forming the right bank of the Indus for several miles below the village of Bahadur Dok, and which is apparently a branch from the great Suliman Range, which runs parallel with the Indus in the Dersajat and Scinde, and forms the natural western boundary of our Indian Empire.\n\nIn order to convey, if possible, an idea of the general features of the Salt Range, we shall follow its three natural divisions, into a southern or salt, a central or cultivated limestone, and a northern or sandstone district, beginning from Jelalpur where the Salt Range proper may for practical purposes be considered to commence.\n\nAlong its southern limits, the Range presents a most jagged angular outline, produced by a succession of points running towards the plain and separated by deep intervening strata. These points are covered and in many places formed of masses of rock and debris, which during the upheaval of the Salt Range, and subsequently from atmospheric and disturbing agencies, have been detached from a high escarpment with the strata of which they have undoubtedly been at one time continuous.\n\nThis escarpment extending from Jelalpur to the Indus is most prominently marked in the eastern part of the Range. Its continuity is frequently broken by deep transverse gorges, running parallel to the general line of dip of the rocks, through which the greater number of the streams which drain the Salt Range escape into the plains. None of these, except during heavy falls of rain, reach either the Jhelum or the Indus, but are absorbed by the thirsty sun-baked alluvial soil which instead of fertilizing, they convert into a comparative desert by the deposition of saline matter which they acquire in their course as they flow over the salt rocks which are chiefly confined to the southern district of the Range.\nTo this rule the streams which escape from the hills at Baghawalla, Kuttha and Musakhail are exceptions. The two former, though slightly saline are entirely consumed for agricultural purposes. The latter known as the Vehee River runs entirely through strata, superior to the Salt rocks and pours out a considerable volume of sweet water, a very small portion of which is employed for irrigation, the greater part being allowed to run to waste. By the judicious formation of an aqueduct (stone and lime are available in abundance on the spot) with sluices for the withdrawal of the water, means for the irrigation of a very considerable extent of now unproductive soil, could be rendered available. The various streams we have alluded to, after heavy rains, become suddenly swollen and acquiring the characteristic impetuosity of mountain-torrents, bear along with them an immense quantity of boulders, gravel and mud which are, along the foot of the hills, deposited in a succession zones extending for two or three miles.\n\nAs may be supposed a district formed in this way presents somewhat barren aspect, and with the exception of a scanty rye crop of Bejra* and Juar\u2020 and annual cotton, there is but little ground under cultivation. In the cold weather after heavy rain, assumes a somewhat green aspect, but when rain does not fall, was the case in the cold weather of 1851-52, hardly a blade of grass is to be seen, and much do the villagers suffer for want of water, they being in a great degree dependent for the supply of this necessary on seasonable falls of rain, which they collect in kutcha (mud) tanks, and which as long as a supply of water lasts are resorted indiscriminately by men and cattle.\n\nA stunted jungle of Capparis sphylla (kurul), Salvadora persica (pelu), Zizyphus (beir), Acacia modesta (phoolahi), and Prosopis specigera (jund), occurs along the foot of the hills, and affords grazing to numerous camels, sheep and goats, as well as an abundant supply of fuel to the villagers. These shrubs appear to thrive best in soil charged with saline matter, and form the mass of jungle in the uncultivated tracts of the Punjab Doabs which generally present on their surface a white saline effervescence known under the name of kuilur, and which is a mixture of salt and sulphate, with\n\n* Panicum spicatum. \u2020 Holcus sorghum.\ngenerally a trace of carbonate of soda. As we ascend the alluvial zones along the foot of the hills vegetation gradually diminishes, and on the Salt rocks, which are the lowest in the series, it seems to reach a minimum. A few stunted kurul, pelu and phoolahi bushes may be observed, but succulent salsolas* and other chenopodiaceous plants known to the natives under the general term \"java,\" with one or two interesting Cruciferae characterize these, and abound in the Salt-marl. Above the Salt rocks vegetation again increases, but on account of the want of water along the foot of the escarpment of the Range, is everywhere scanty.\n\nOn reaching the summit of the escarpment which is formed of limestone rocks elevated into a ridge varying from 2 to 5,000 feet in height, we are introduced to a district of a totally different aspect from that to the south, presenting at first generally a considerable slope to the N., which is succeeded by a series of horizontal ridges with intervening valleys.\n\nBetween Jelalpur and Baghanwallsa, the Range presents merely a ridge; but beyond the latter place this expands into a kind of table-land two or three miles in breadth, extending from the escarpment between Baghanwallsa and Jutana N. to the foot of mount Drengan, the highest but one of the Salt Range hills which rises from it behind the village of Bisharut. This table-land is about 2,800 feet above the level of the sea, and, though entirely dependent on rain, is all under cultivation, and yields generally fair crops of wheat, barley, &c. It extends in a S. W. direction for about a couple of miles, and then becomes broken up by limestone ridges, into a succession of small cultivated valleys, one of which runs along the S. side of mount Kurringurli under the village of Vuhali.\n\nProceeding westward to Katass, we enter the district of Kuhun, which is made up of a succession of ridges and cultivated valleys about 2,000 feet above the sea-level. At the west end of this district is the Salt Lake of Kullur Kuhor (Kullur in Sanscrit means salt, Kuhor, Sansc. a lake). Its extent varies much in different seasons, but may be stated as about a mile long by half a mile broad, its\n\n* These, in the plain along the foot of the Range, are, after the rains, cut, collected into heaps and burnt for the sake of their ashes, which are called saji mutti, a coarse kind of carbonate of soda.\ngreatest length being from east to west. It receives the drainage from the various hills around, and also a small stream of fresh water which enters it at its West end near the village of Kuhar. Its depth nowhere exceeds three or four feet, and its margin is formed of black fetid mud, outside which is a thick saline incrustation produced by the evaporation of its water. Its saline ingredients seem derived from salt springs, which issue from a mass of marl at its S.W. end. Its water is a strong brine, but owing to the constant drainage into it, after rains, of fresh water, it never reaches a point of concentration sufficient to admit of salt being deposited in the bottom of the lakes. After any heavy rains and when its surface level is considerably raised, a portion of its water finds an exit by a nullah at its N.W. corner, which joins a small stream called Nunwar in the hills to the north. This periodical overflow also assists in preventing the concentration of the water. It appears to contain no fish, but it is a favourite resort of ducks and other water-fowl.\n\nBeyond Kuhar on to Pyle, the district becomes more hilly and only occasional patches of cultivation are to be seen. Here the Range, which to the eastward does not exceed ten or twelve miles in breadth, becomes narrow; but soon rapidly expands into a mass of hills which at their broadest point, North of Jubbee, is probably not less than eighteen miles.\n\nAmong these are several cultivated valleys, the principal of which are those of Khubakkie and Lone Lihepur. The former presents nothing remarkable, except that after heavy rain, one or two small lakes form in its lower parts.\n\nThe Lone Lihepur valley is about twelve miles long, and three broad and is inland, between two ridges of limestone hills. It is for the most part under rich cultivation, and in the hot weather has the reputation of being as cool as Cashmere. At its west end is a great salt lake called \"Sumundur,\" three miles long by one and a half broad, and beyond it mount Lihepur, the highest point of the Salt Range, attains an elevation of about 5000 feet above the sea level. Here the central district of the Range may be said to end, its summit forming a ridge on to the Indus.\n\nThe Salt Lake or Sumundur (sea) is in every way similar to the one of Kulur Kuhar, but as far as we are aware, receives no perma-\ninent streams. During rain, the drainage into it from the Gumundra, Putial and Kurrung ridges, which surround it, must be very considerable, and the boulders in several nullahs which enter its eastern extremity, mark the force of the floods which it at times receives. There appears no exit for the waters of the lake, which by solar evaporation must be kept within due bounds. All the hills by which it is surrounded are composed of limestone, and hence it is probable that salt springs enter it from below. Its water is a strong brine, and a thick saline incrustation covers its banks.\n\nSouth of the salt lake, in the hills between Kufree and Vurcha, and about four miles from the former, is a fresh-water lake of considerable depth called Julhur Kuhar (Julhur, Sanscrit, a spring of fresh water), about three quarters of a mile long by about half-a-mile broad. It is most picturesquely situated at the foot of a limestone escarpment, and receives the drainage of the limestone hills around and of the small valley at the west end of which it is placed. We believe we were the first Europeans who had ever visited it, and were not aware of its existence till we stumbled upon it accidentally. The pleasure of beholding such a sheet of fresh water cannot be appreciated to its full extent but in the midst of hills like the Salt Range, where fresh water is nowhere abundant, and clean water is a scarce luxury.\n\nThe vegetation in the central and northern districts of the Range presents a striking difference to that on its south side, but though the hills attain to a considerable height, there is nothing to indicate an approach to an Alpine flora. The want of any of the ordinary trees characteristic of the Sub-Himalayan ranges of elevations from two to five thousand feet is very remarkable, and with the exception of a few stunted Hyperanthera and semul trees (Bombax heptaphyllum), whose large scarlet flowers appear in the months of February and March, nothing deserving the name of a tree is to be seen on the Salt Range from the Jhelum to the Indus. This we conceive is to be attributed entirely to the general absence of soil on the surface of the limestone rock of the district, the debris of which seems all to be washed into the valleys, where it forms a productive soil. But although trees are deficient, the hills of the central district present a green and refreshing aspect, being generally covered\nwith a low bush jungle, formed in great part of Dodonsea Burmaniana (Sunhetta) and Adhatoda vassica (Behikkur). These two shrubs, but particularly the former, may be considered as peculiarly characteristic of the central district, their fibrous roots penetrating deeply into the soil between the rents and fissures which everywhere traverse the limestone strata. Mixed with these may be observed the Philahee and the Kow\u2014a species of Olea* famous for its long and straight sticks which make excellent hammer or hatchet handles.\n\nAfter rain a good deal of grass springs up, forming tufts along the fissures in the limestone; and a by no means inconsiderable number of the smaller flowering plants may also be collected during the months of March, April and May.\n\nThe northern district of the Range is formed of a succession of ridges of soft sandstones and clays separated by deep ravines. They present an escarpment to the south and dip to the north at a high angle under the plain of Potowar, the general name for the country north of the Salt Range, and which in its neighbourhood does not probably exceed 1,000 feet above the level of the sea. They are small breadth in its eastern and central part, but towards the Indus expand into barren hills that extend from Marie to Mokhudd; distance of fully 16 miles.\n\nThis district presents scarcely any cultivation, and its natural vegetation is much the same as that of the central district, though less abundant. The Grislea tomentosa (Tawa) is the only shrub I have observed to be confined to the soft sandstone ridges.\n\nIn the Salt Range all goods, &c. must be conveyed on camels, mules, or bullocks; paths passable for loaded camels cross it at Dundhote, Mukrach, Lurdi, Nurpur, Kuttha and Nummul. The best of these are the Dundhote, Kuttha and Nummul ones. The traffic over them is, however, small, and chiefly confined to salt. The grain grown in the Salt Range is, we believe, not more than sufficient to supply the wants of its population, which is chiefly Mahomedan.\n\n* Probably O. europaea.\nOn the Geological Structure of the Salt Range in the Punjab.\n\nAll the rocks forming the Salt Range appear to belong to the strata termed fossiliferous by Sir Charles Lyell, whose classification will be followed throughout the present Report.\n\nWe recognize then the following formations in an ascending order, and under each of these shall endeavour shortly to describe their various characteristic subdivisions, noticing as we proceed the minerals, &c. which they yield.\n\n1. Primary or Palaeozoic.\n\n   a. Red marl with gypsum and rock salt.\n   b. Lower red sandstone and grit, with conglomerate.\n   c. Greenish micaceous sandstones and shales with grey dolomitic (magnesian) sandstone.\n   d. Upper red variegated sandstones, grits, conglomerates and clays.\n\n2. Secondary.\n\n   a. Lower limestone, calcareous sandstone and shales.\n   b. Grey sandstone and shales.\n   c. Upper limestone, sometimes magnesian.\n\n3. Tertiary.\n\n   a. Yellow iron-stained quartzose sandstones, grits and bituminous shales.\n   b. Cherty thin bedded limestones with shales.\n   c. Green Belemnite sandstone and shales.\n\n4. Post-Tertiary.\n\n   Brown calcareous sandstone, nummulite limestone, marls and alum shales with lignite.\n\n   Greenish sandstones argillaceous grits, conglomerates and red and green clays.\n\n   Alluvium.\n\nPrimary, fossiliferous Devonian Rocks.\n\na. Red marl with gypsum and rock salt. This rock gives to the Salt Range one of its most characteristic features, appearing generally at the foot of its southern escarpment, and in the bottoms of the various deep ravines which intersect the hills.\nThe marl occurs as the lowest rock, being subordinate to a coarse red sandstone into which it seems to pass, the transition being marked by dark coloured fissile argillaceous beds. At Jutana and in the Chukie Wan near Jubbee, a coarse red sandstone with bands of conglomerate is seen in some places, cropping out under the marl; but as great disturbance occurs among the strata at these localities, and as the sandstone is identical in mineral character with the marl, which in the regular order of things appears above the marl, we are disposed to consider its occurrence under it in the localities above mentioned as the result of an overturn.\n\nThe marl can be recognized at a distance by its most singular brick red colour, totally different from that of any ordinary clay, which immediately impresses one with the idea, that it has been subjected to igneous agency.\n\nIt does not disintegrate when treated with hydrochloric acid, but in powder effervesces strongly, the greater part remaining unsolved, in the shape of a red mud composed of clay and sulphate of lime or gypsum. The portion soluble in acid, consists of carbonate of lime and carbonate of magnesia in about equal proportions with little alumina and peroxide of iron, to which latter substance the marl owes its colour. The rock is therefore a clay, cemented by gypsum and the carbonate of lime and magnesia into the consistency of stone, the gypsum predominating and frequently appearing in laminae of selenite in the marl, which sometimes presents a radiating aspect, from a peculiar crystallization of the sulphate of lime.\n\nIn many places it is traversed by veins of gypsum, which seem to have been formed in rents in the marl, and give it a most singular honey-combed appearance. These veins often traverse the included irregular beds of gypseum, proving they are more recent than the marl, though in mineral character the gypsum of both the veins and beds is identical. In several localities thin beds of chert and compact silicious sinter, containing patches of chalcedony may be observed.\n\nThe marl is extremely tough, and on this account, though by no means hard, the work of sinking shafts or galleries in it, is very laborious. It forms hills, some of which rise to the height of 1,700 feet above the sea, of a most jagged appearance, which is in a great measure produced by the heavy falls of rain, dissolving out\ngypsum, and its earthy carbonates, and forming in it deep ravines and channels. These by undermining the marl frequently produce extensive slips, which cause serious annoyance in the working of the salt.\n\nOn tracing up some of the ravines, where the marl is well developed, it seems to form the centre of an anticlinal axis, the rocks superior to it (see Table No. 7) dipping away from either side of its outcrop at a considerable angle. At the end of some of the gorges, it often presents an amphitheatre of small hills surrounded by scarp-ed precipices of the superior rocks. This may be well seen at the upper part of the Milawan ravine below Nurpur and in the Seral Ravine at Surdee, in both of which localities it has a remarkably eruptive aspect.\n\nIn the eastern part of the Range, the marl presents scarcely any traces of stratification. Towards the Indus, however, in the neighbourhood of Choosa, Vurcha and Futtypur, where it is extensively developed, thin beds of argillaceous dark red sandstone occur in the marl, and indicate its being a stratified deposit.\n\nAt several places, but particularly around Pind Dadun Khan, the marl for some depth from the surface has much the character of a breccia; angular masses of salt gypsum, sandstone and limestone similar to those occurring in situ, being diffused through it. As the numbers of the fragments appear to decrease the further from the surface we examine the breccia, and as they are most numerous where there is evidence of the greatest disturbance in the surrounding rocks, it is most probable that the breccia marl, which we have seen in some ravines fully 200 feet thick, has been formed on the surface of the regular marl at the time of, or subsequent to, the upheaval of the Range to be hereafter noticed. Indeed its formation may be observed after every heavy fall of rain, which washes large quantities of red mud and fragments of rock into hollows in the marl, which ultimately become cemented by the infiltration of sulphate and bi-carbonate of lime, held in solution by the rain-water, and derived from the strata over which it passes in its downward course.\n\nWe have hinted that the marl in some places has a singularly eruptive appearance, but the distinct proofs of stratification which it\npresents in the western part of the Range negative probable however, that it has undergone me igneous influence, the exact nature of which it is tain. In no one locality in the Salt Range is there the existence of plutonic or volcanic rocks by which phism could be effected, or the great disturbance p apparent every where. In addition to the brick marl, which at once associates itself with the aspect brick-kiln, the contained gypsum in many places at its surface, is converted into a powder-like plaster can only be prepared artificially by baking gypsum. is most common towards the upper parts of the Kewrah, Mukrach and Nurpur patches of a most late-coloured argillaceous rock of a somewhat trap just at the point where the marl passes by fissile into the red sandstone. It everywhere appears small masses, which sometimes present a scoriasoid include a curious radiated mineral not unlike some vitreous, nodules of green clay, and nests of talc. The pe are quite superficial, and do not extend beyond two except in the gorge above the Kemah village, where a bed about 1\u00bd feet thick, which may be traced on the gorge for about 80 yards, when it thins out, p into argillaceous sandstone, a metamorphosed por appears to be.\n\nIt effervesces slightly with muriatic acid, which peroxide of iron, alumina and carbonate of lime magnesia.\n\nIn addition to the above indications of the marl jected to a high temperature, we would add the fa sandstones resting on the marl are every where r into small fragments, which appearance gradually leave the marl. The beds of chert and sinter occurring in it, could only have been deposited by silica being only soluble in water (generally alkaline) temperature and under high pressure.\nMinerals.\n\nThe only two minerals of importance which the red marl yields are rock salt and gypsum. These we shall notice in detail.\n\nRock Salt.\n\nThis valuable mineral, the origin of which is so veiled in obscurity, occurs in the marl apparently in a bed from 150 to 200 feet thick, towards its upper surface, but wherever salt occurs, masses of it of all sizes, which have been detached from the original bed, are found scattered through the marl at various depths.\n\nThree varieties of salt occur, the red, the white and the transparent or glass salt. The former is obtained in greatest quantity, and being tougher and more difficult to reduce to powder than the other two varieties, stands transportation better, and is consequently in greatest demand among the salt merchants.\n\nThe mineral in all its varieties is a nearly pure chloride of sodium, the only foreign soluble ingredient it contains being a trace of sulphate of lime. Except when the salt is mixed with marl, it contains no chloride of magnesium, an impurity which generally occurs in rock salt, and the absence of which in that of the Salt Range renders it but slightly deliquescent. The colour of the red salt is not, as might be supposed, derived from a salt of iron or manganese, but is probably of an organic nature.\n\nThe salt has every appearance of having been formed by crystallization from a brine solution, in which much marl as mud has at times been mechanically suspended. At the lower and upper limits of the bed, where the deposition of the salt has commenced and ended, it is much mixed with marl, but in its interior this merely forms thin partings in the pure salt, which mark its stratification. As the salt presents more of a crystalline aspect in the interior of the bed, than at either its upper or under surface, we are inclined to think that it has been there formed during a very slow evaporation of the brine solution, which from the absence of mud, must have been in a state of great quiescence. The salt is everywhere solid, and never presents cavities lined with crystals of salt, which we would expect to find had it been a sublimed product.\n\nThe salt bed bears evidence of having been exposed to violent disturbing agency, as it can never be traced for any distance in the\ninterior of the veins, without observing frequent fractures in it, or partial faults, which are generally filled with coarsely powdered salt, gypsum and marl, produced probably by the fractured ends of the bed rubbing against each other during the process of upheaval, or from subterranean movements subsequent to this.\n\nThe mineral has hitherto been mined in a most primitive manner, no alterations or improvements having been introduced, since the annexation of the Punjab in 1849.\n\nWhen a spot has been fixed upon, as a promising locality, a tunnel is cut in the marl about five feet high and three and half feet broad, and carried on until salt is reached, the proximity of which is generally indicated, by the marl becoming moist and assuming more the character of a dark red clay. The mineral is then excavated as long as a supply is procurable, no attention being paid to leaving pillars at intervals for the support of the workings, the consequence of which is, that great annoyance is experienced from the falling in of the roof of the mines; and accidents to the unfortunate miners themselves are of frequent occurrence. Should the shaft have been sunk on, and reached only a mass of salt, after this is worked out, the mine is either abandoned, or a gallery driven to a greater depth into the marl until another large mass is found or the salt bed reached. As this invariably has a strike and dip corresponding to the strata superior to the marl, the stratification of the salt guides the miners in their onward course. Along the bed, the process of working is the same as on the masses, the whole of the good salt being mined without leaving any support for the roof of the workings, there being nothing more than huge caves excavated entirely in the salt, which is seldom or ever worked through, either in the floor or roof of the caves, because as the salt approaches its matrix it becomes intimately mixed with marl, and is highly deliquescent from containing magnesia.\n\nIn almost every mine in the Salt Range the evil of having left no pillars for the support of thin roofs, &c. is experienced, and some of the larger and best mines have been in a great degree abandoned, in consequence of their becoming filled up with huge masses of salt, gypsum and marl. As the marl is the lowest rock in the Range, and dips under all the others in a northerly direction at an angle of from\n25\u00b0 to 40\u00b0; as might be expected, much trouble is occasioned by the filling of the mines with water when they reach to any great depth. During the rains too, in July, August and September, the water rushes through passages in the marl into the mines, and by detaching large portions of rock render them quite unsafe. In these months, the miners desert the mines; partly on account of their danger, and partly on account of the intense heat and numerous fleas and musquitoes which infest them and their neighbourhood.\n\nIn consequence of the irregular way of carrying on the workings, the passages into the various mines exhibit at present a succession of ascents and descents over a series of rude steps, which sometimes become so polished and slippery as to render walking over them a matter of some difficulty.\n\nIn extracting the salt, the chief instrument used is a hammer, pick-shaped and hard-tempered at one end, and with a round head at the other. A mass of salt being fixed upon as the scene of operation, a portion is lined off, about two feet thick, and along this a groove is cut with the sharp pointed hammer to the depth of some eight or ten inches. Larger sharp pointed hammers as wedges are then introduced at intervals along this line and on their broad heads a series of sharp blows are inflicted. This generally detaches a block of salt, which is then broken up into lumps of a size convenient for being carried out of the mines. The amount of waste resulting from the above method of working is something immense, and as powdered salt is not saleable as long as lumps can be had, it is generally shovelled into the bottom of the workings where frequently there is a deep brine pool ready to receive it.\n\nInstead of making a deep groove along the limits of the mass, it is desired to detach, (we believe the object could be equally well attained by adopting the plan used in the granite quarries of Scotland, and which is as simple as it is effective.) Small holes three or four inches long, two inches broad and four inches deep are picked out at intervals of eight or ten inches in the mass which it is desired to split. Into these holes truncated iron wedges are introduced. Each of these are in succession driven into the holes and continue to receive sharp blows till the mass splits, which is at once known by the elasticity of the stone causing the wedges to jump out of their\nholes. A lever is then inserted into the crack and the divided portions separated. Were this process introduced in the mining of the salt, we are satisfied that a considerable saving to Government would be effected. On account of the dangerous state of the roots of nearly all the mines, gunpowder is seldom used, and hence all the work is done by the pick and hammer.\n\nThe mines are generally very faintly lighted by small oil lamps made generally out of bits of salt, the glimmer from which reflected from the sparkling salt and salt-encrusted bodies of the workmen has a most singular effect. From the want of circulation of air in most of the mines and the dampness of the atmosphere, the heat is most oppressive, and from the filthy habits of the miners, the stench in some of the mines is quite overpowering. In the month of December when the temperature of the external air was 71\u00b0 in the Buggie Mine at Keurah, the thermometer indicated a temperature of 81\u00b0.\n\nMen, women and children indiscriminately pursue the avocation of salt miners. Families generally work together, the mother and children being chiefly occupied in carrying on their backs the masses of salt from the workings to the mouth of the mine, which the father has quarried. Like miners generally, they are a somewhat discontented set, and strifes among them are by no means uncommon.\n\nThe pay of the miners varies a good deal. At Keurah, Mukrach and Vurcha, salt is turned out at the mouth of the mines at the rate of Rs. 3-12 per 100 maunds (\u00a30 7s. 6d. for 8,000 lbs.) at Surdee they receive Rs. 2-8 (\u00a30 5s. 0d.) while at Kalibay where the salt occurs in enormous masses which crop out on the surface of the marl, and which have only to be broken up and removed, they receive Rs. 2-14 for quarrying it, and Rs. 1-5 per 100 maunds for conveying it to the depot at Marree. The above rates include the expense of oil, instruments, &c., all of which are supplied by the miners themselves.\n\nThe quantity of salt that can be turned out in a day by a good workman is about 10 maunds (800 lbs.) which at the present rate of Rs. 2-8 per 100 maunds would give the miner 4 As. or 6 pence. Where, however, a family work together, the father and perhaps one of the sons mining while the mother and children remove the salt, their earnings amount to something considerable.\nThe general appearance of the miners varies greatly. At the end of the hot season they appear very sickly and sallow, but towards the close of the cold weather they do not appear to us to have a more unhealthy aspect than the inhabitants of towns in the Punjab generally have.\n\nThey however suffer a good deal from sickness; but this is probably more owing to the position in which their villages are placed; and to their filthy habits than to their trade. Certain diseases such as ophthalmia and pulmonary complaints are very prevalent among them, and doubtless result from the injurious effect of the finely powdered salt acting as an irritant on the mucous membranes. Fever is very prevalent among the miners at Keurah, where, perhaps from the confined position of their village, they look far more sickly than at most of the other mines.\n\nGoitre is a frequent complaint, but particularly so at Kalibagh, where every one seems more or less affected by the disease. This the natives ascribe to the Indus water which is generally of a milky colour from fine calcareous mud mechanically suspended in it, and which the addition of a little alum speedily removes.\n\nDracunculus or guinea-worm is also very prevalent, but is by no means peculiar to the Salt Range, being a common complaint all through the Punjab among the natives, whenever they are dependent on tanks for their supply of water.\n\nAs a general rule it may be observed, that where the supply of water to a village is obtained from a kutcha (mud) tank, out of which men and cattle drink indiscriminately, a circumstance, from necessity, by no means uncommon, there guinea-worm will prevail, while in villages supplied by running streams, the disease will be unknown.\n\nDuring the Seikh rule, salt was mined at almost every spot where it cropped out, but to prevent smuggling most of the mines have been shut up since the annexation of the Punjab, salt being now only extracted at Keurah, Mukrach, Surdee, Chooa, Vurcha and Kalibagh. At all these places there are regular salt dep\u00f4ts, and there only can merchants procure a supply at the rate of Rs. 2 per maund (\u00a30 4s. Od. for 80 lbs.) For whatever quantity they may purchase they receive a permit, and should an ounce more than this indicates,\nbe found in their custody, confiscation of the salt, and of the mules, bullocks or camels on which it is loaded, is the punishment awarded.\n\nTo prevent smuggling wherever salt occurs in the marl or is supposed to, from the occurrence of strong brine springs, a guard is posted, and the villagers are not allowed to take away even for their cattle the saline efflorescence on the sides of the numerous brine streams, which issue from the range or even a pitcherful of the brine itself. As only the very poorest class of natives would think of using the dirty salt on the sides of the streams, or of evaporating the brine in order to obtain a small supply, this proscription falls very hard upon them, and they cannot understand why they may not as well avail themselves of the kullur or kourah pani as allow it to be wasted.\n\nOf all the mines in the Salt Range those at Keurah near Pind Dadun Khan, yield the largest amount of salt, and those of Chooa, Vurcha the least.

Wright, Esq., Collector of Salt Customs in Punjab, shows the quantity of salt extracted from the mines at each of the different salt stations or dep\u00f4ts during the commercial years, 1850 and 1851, with the amount of revenue realized by its sale.\n\n|                      | 1850          | 1851          |\n|----------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                      | Maunds.       | Seers.        | Chittacka.   | Maunds.       | Seers.        | Chittacka.   |\n| Keurah mines         | 4,63,410      | 14            | 24           | 3,84,242      | 19            | 11           |\n| Mukrach ditto        | 1,46,525      | 5             | 0            | 1,31,773      | 23            | 6            |\n| Surdee ditto         | 42,505        | 20            | 0            | 19,628        | 31            | 4            |\n| Chooa, Vurcha ditto  | 36,385        | 2             | 8            | 39,699        | 26            | 0            |\n| Kalibagh             | 79,747        | 23            | 2            | 65,274        | 7             | 6            |\n| **Grand Total**      | **7,68,603**  | **24**        | **124**      | **6,40,618**  | **27**        | **11**       |\n| **Rs.**              | **A.**        | **P.**        | **Rs.**      | **A.**        | **A.**        |              |\n| Revenue yielded at the rate of Co.'s Rs. 2 per maund of 40 seers, | 15,37,400     | 1             | 7            | 12,81,295     | 14            | 10           |\nThe introduction of a scientific system of mining a mineral which yields so large an amount of revenue to Government is of such vast importance that we cannot close our remarks on the salt deposit, without urging the necessity of securing the services of a practical miner, who from extensive experience acquired under-ground in some of the large salt mines of England or the Continent, is thoroughly capable of introducing and carrying out the improvements required. Under his guidance, the mineral should be extracted, shafts sunk, and the whole interior economy of the mines regulated.\n\nThe operations now in progress with a view to run a tunnel into the Sugaswalla mine at Keurah, which from the efforts of the former primitive way of working it, is almost entirely blocked up, are, we trust, only the commencement of a series of reforms, which if carried out with vigour by duly qualified superintendents, are certain to be followed by the best results. It will probably, however, be found more economical and satisfactory to sink entirely new mines through the marl into the salt bed, than to attempt radical changes in mines that have been long worked, and had their roofs extensively undermined by the indiscriminate excavation of salt. The waste in working the salt is now so great, that we are convinced with a little care and the introduction of an improved system of mining a large amount might annually be saved to Government. It is not enough to say that because the supply of salt is so abundant, there is no necessity for changing the method of mining that has been adopted from time immemorial.* The supply of salt is undoubtedly large, but as there is such a deal of difficulty, nay impossibility, in the present workings of obtaining accurate information as to its extent or thickness, we conceive it is the duty and interest of an enlighten-\n\n* We have been quite unable to obtain any accurate information as to the period when the salt mines were first opened. The natives assert it was during the reign of the Emperor Akbar (whose accession dates from 1556) to whom the existence of salt in the Salt Range was disclosed by one Asp Khan, on condition of his receiving, as a reward, during his life time, a sum equal to the amount of the wages of the miners employed in extracting it. During Akbar's reign, it is a matter of history, that Lahore salt sold at the rate of about six annas a maund. In the Kohat district at the present time it may be brought for use Trans-Indus at four annas a maund!\ned Government to economize the mineral as much as possible. The powdered and inferior salt now wasted in the mines, might all be saved by dissolving it in water in deep tanks. In these all mud and mechanical impurities would rapidly subside, and on the brine solution becoming clear, it might be run off and evaporated by the heat of the sun in other shallow tanks or by passing the brine through mattings exposed to the sun and air, on which it would rapidly crystallize. In the Austrian mines, the brine obtained from impure salt is dried up in large evaporating houses, but as in this country the heat of the sun would serve instead of fuel, the expense would be but trifling and a large quantity obtained of a salt which for many purposes would be preferable to rock salt.\n\nBy economizing also the numerous brine springs and streams which issue from the Salt Range a large supply of an inferior salt could be obtained, and which if sold at a cheap rate, would, we believe, be extensively purchased by the natives, for agricultural purposes.\n\nA large quantity also of an impure salt (a mixture of chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda) might be collected from the banks of the Kullur Kuhar and Sumoondur salt lakes,* which is now utterly useless, the natives on their banks not being even allowed to remove it to give their cattle.\n\nGypsum.\n\nGypsum occurs in the marl in a manner similar to the salt, irregular beds and huge masses being scattered through it, wherever it occurs in beds it is much cracked, the fissures being filled with red marl or a bluish clay. Beds of it seem to be both above and below the salt. In some localities the strata of gypsum are remarkably bent and contorted, as if they had been subjected to violent, lateral pressure, previous to their being shattered and upheaved. The mineral is for the most part of a light grey colour with a shade of blue, and translucent on the edges. It has a saccharine appearance, but masses in which a coarse crystalline structure prevails are by no\n\n* The water of this lake has a Sp. Gr. of 1.02 five hundred (500) grains evaporated to dryness yielded 14.97 grains of saline matter consisting of sulphate of soda and chlorides of sodium and magnesium with a trace of chloride of calcium.\nmeans uncommon. Red varieties also occur and beds of a dark grey earthy gypsum are generally associated with the saccharine kind.\n\nIt is a nearly pure sulphate of lime and appears to be free of any admixture of carbonate of lime.\n\nWhen calcined it yields a pure plaster of Paris, which sets rapidly when mixed with water. Gypsums, however, in which carbonate of lime is absent, form, when calcined, a less coherent cement than those where it occurs to the extent of 10 or 12 per cent. By a due admixture therefore of quick lime with the calcined Salt Range gypsum, its hardness as a cement or mortar will probably be increased.\n\nThe natives do not appear to be aware of the properties of gypsum when calcined, though they use it in fine powder mixed up with pure lime into a mortar, to produce the shining marbly appearance, so often noticed in their finer chunam work.\n\nIn the department of public works, the use of gypsum might be successfully introduced for various building purposes, and a supply to any extent might be procured from around Pind Dadan Khan.\n\nIn the gypsum of Maree and Kalibagh and also at Surdee, very perfect rock crystals occur generally in the form of six-sided prisms terminated by six-sided pyramids. After rain these spangle in a most striking manner, and hence have acquired the name of Maree diamonds. Transparent, red and milky varieties occur, the former being the most abundant. The longer and more perfect crystals are much esteemed by the natives, who manufacture them into necklaces.\n\nVery perfect crystals of iron pyrites also occur in gypsum in the Keils Wan above the village of Khond, from beds, of which a sulphur spring issues at a natural temperature, depositing sulphur on the gypsum over which it flows.\n\nIn proceeding along the Salt Range from E. to W., the first indications of salt marl occur in the S. E. or scarped side of mount Tillah, where it is very indistinct, being in great part concealed by Tertiary sands and clays. From the West end of mount Tillah it may be traced along the foot of the scarped or West side of the Chumbul ridge to Jelalpore where it is considerably developed, but in the midst of such great disturbance that its relative position can with difficulty be made out. To the West of Jelalpore there is no distinct outcrop of the marl seen along the escarpment of the Range under\nthe red sandstone until we reach Jutana, where it occurs in great quantity and includes large stratified masses apparently of salt, along with broken up beds of gypsum. No salt is seen in the marl East of Jutana, though wherever it appears, its surface is covered with a saline efflorescence, and all the springs which issue from it yield a strong brine.\n\nFrom this point it may be uninterruptedly traced to Pind Dadun Khan, in the neighbourhood of which it yields a very large amount of salt, and from thence with but a few breaks on to the Gredi Hills near Moosakhail, between which place and Booreekhail it is not seen. Here it again crops out and yields salt, and may be traced westward for some two or three miles into a ravine, which separates the Lukrukkie from the Majooch Hills. It then disappears and does not again, as far as we are aware, crop out, till near Maree on the Indus, where it forms an isolated ridge overhanging the river, along the right bank of which above the town of Kalibagh it is extensively developed, the salt appearing in immense stratified masses in the marl. Except for a few miles up to the Loon Nullah, which enters the Indus opposite Maree, we have not traced the marl northward, but probably the same formation yields the salt obtained at the mines in the Kohat district, which from the repeated attacks of the hill tribes have gained considerable notoriety.\n\nAt Maree and Kalibagh, the marl appears to have been subjected to great disturbance, and the red sandstone strata, which in other localities are immediately superior to it, seem to be wanting entirely. At Maree a few Tertiary sandstone strata, may be seen dipping as it were under the marl, and on the Kalibagh hill it seems entirely covered by Tertiary conglomerates and sandstones. As there is distinct evidence of a great upheaval and fracture of the rocks at Kalibagh, it is not surprising that the salt marl should appear to have suffered in the general disturbance, and to have as it were been forced up through the rocks, which in the regular order of things intervene between the Tertiary strata and the marl.\n\nIts relation to the Tertiary rocks might induce the supposition, that at Kalibagh the marl was of Tertiary age, but its general appearance and mineral character are identical with the rock to the eastward, and leave no room to doubt that it is of the same age.\nBesides the general outcrop of marl along the escarpment of the Range, we have noticed it under the red sandstone on the N. W., on the scarped side of mount Kuringali, the path between the villages of Chumbi and Vevhalee passing over it. Here no salt was observed, but the marl contains abundance of gypsum, and its surface is incrusted with the usual saline efflorescence. At the west end of the salt lake of Kullur Kuhar, the marl also occurs in small quantity, appearing to have been forced up through the rocks immediately superior to it, and to be brought into contact with nummulite limestone by which it is covered.\n\nAt Vusual to the north of Noorpoor we believe the salt marl with salt occurs in a deep ravine, but as we were not aware of the fact when in its neighbourhood, we never visited the locality. This, as far as we know, is the only spot where salt has been found on the north side of the Salt Range.\n\nb. Lower Red Sandstone and Grit with Conglomerate.\n\nWherever the salt marl is seen at the base of an escarpment, its upper portion may be observed gradually to lose its brick-red colour, to become more like an indurated clay, and ultimately to pass into thin beds of dark red, fissile, argillaceous sandstone, which in some places alternates with thin beds of gypsum and salt, and with green and chocolate-coloured clays.\n\nThis sandstone gradually loses its argillaceous character, its beds become thicker, its colour lighter and, by its constituents becoming coarser, passes frequently into a grit. Conglomerate bands chiefly formed of boulders of primitive rocks of moderate size, among which the prevalence of a red coarse-grained syenite is very remarkable, occur frequently, and present exactly the characters of the old red sandstone conglomerate of Britain.\n\nThe sandstone generally, but especially its lower beds, where they approach the marl, is highly hygrometric, and frequently presents on its surface a saline incrustation.\n\nIt does not disintegrate in muriatic acid, but a portion dissolves with effervescence, the solution yielding to the usual tests, abundant indications of carbonate of lime and carbonate of magnesia.\n\nThe ease with which this sandstone can be quarried is a strong\nrecommendation in its favour, though from its liability to become damp in moist weather, owing to its being impregnated with salt, it rapidly crumbles, and hence cannot be recommended as a durable building stone. If ever required for the purpose, the lighter coloured portions of the rock should invariably be selected, as they are less hygrometric than the darker variety.\n\nNo minerals of importance have been observed in this rock.\n\nAlthough the most careful search was made, particularly in the lighter-coloured beds where fossils are most likely to be found, not a trace of an organic remain could be detected; when we bear in mind the fact that only a few years ago, the old red sandstone of Britain was regarded, \"as the least fossiliferous rock in the geologic scale,\" our want of success in obtaining fossils from its Punjab representative, will not appear remarkable.\n\nThe thickness of this formation varies a good deal throughout the Range, and probably on an average is not less than 500 feet. The upper surface of the beds frequently present ripple markings, indicative of their having been deposited in shallow water.\n\nc. Greenish micaceous Sandstones and Shales with grey Dolomitic Sandstone.\n\nThe red sandstone is generally succeeded by a series of greenish micaceous thinly laminated sandstones, dark shales and coarse calcareous bands, which in the eastern part of the Range are developed into an extensive deposit of a very peculiar sandstone, varying from nearly white to dark grey and weathering of a fawn colour. In many localities it is brecciated, the fragments having become cemented by a calcareous paste. A concretionary structure is by no means uncommon, masses of the rock appearing to be sometimes made up of nodules formed of concentric laminae like the coats of an onion. Its lower beds are generally dark-coloured and parted by bands of micaceous sandstones and shales; brine springs not unfrequently issue from these and their impregnation with magnesia is evinced by the effervescence of sulphate of magnesia in fine acicular crystals, which may be often observed under the ridges of rock. When tolerably well developed, the united thickness of this formation must be about 500 feet.\nThe grey sandstone when treated with muriatic acid, dissolves slowly with effervescence, leaving a considerable residue of a nearly white silicious sand. On filtering this from the acid solution and applying to it the usual tests, lime and magnesia were found in abundance with a trace of protoxide of iron and alumina. The rock under notice is therefore a sandstone, the cementing agents being carbonate of lime and magnesia. Sometimes the two latter largely predominate, and give the sandstone more of the character of a coarse limestone. In a few of its beds, the cementing ingredient seems to be entirely carbonate of lime, and the examination of a specimen from one of these bands obtained at Baghanwala in 1848, which did not yield a trace of magnesia, led us to believe that this earth was not characteristic of the formation, which its appearance induced us to suspect.\n\nA specimen of this sandstone from Mount Tillah yielded on analysis, the following results in 100 parts.\n\n| Component                          | Percentage |\n|-----------------------------------|------------|\n| White quartz sand                 | 28.000     |\n| Carbonate of iron with a trace of alumina | 7.313      |\n| Carbonate of lime                 | 32.874     |\n| Carbonate of magnesia             | 31.199     |\n| Loss                              | .614       |\n\nTotal, ... 100.000\n\nThis sandstone or coarse magnesian limestone will, we are assured, be found to be most excellent and durable building stone, and it is much to be regretted, that it was not selected for the construction of the obelisk in the Chillianwalla burial-ground, the red sandstone of Pind Dadun Khan having been preferred. Though rather hard, it is easily worked, and when roughly polished, is highly ornamental from its possessing a semi-crystalline structure.\n\nIt may be had in abundance on mount Tillah, the summit of which it forms, and all along the Salt Range from Jelalpur to Mukrach, to the West of which place it gradually thins out in the micaceous green sandstone.\n\nLike most calcarious rocks, it is liable to be acted on by water charged with carbonic acid, and hence along the upper weathered\nsurface of its beds, it is grooved and channeled in a most peculiar way by the rain water, which passing through the vegetation, acquires carbonic acid in considerable quantity, and becomes a most powerful natural solvent of lime and magnesia.\n\nThe only mineral which we have observed in this formation deserving of notice is galena or sulphuret of lead.\n\nThis occurs in the dolomitic sandstone, forming the summit of mount Kuringali, and in the same rock in a ravine near the temple on the right side of the Keurah gorge above Pind Dadun Khan. In these localities small cubical crystals are found scattered throughout the rock, but in very small quantity, and nowhere are there indications of a vein of any consequence. It is in great request among the natives as a cosmetic, to whom it is known by the name of Soorma.\n\nObscure carbonaceous markings are of frequent occurrence among the green micaceous sandstones, but too indistinct to be identified. They probably are the remains of fuci. In the dolomitic sandstone, no traces of organisms of any kind were detected.\n\nd. Upper, red, variegated Sandstones, Grits, Conglomerates and Clays.\n\nThe dolomitic sandstone last described is succeeded by a series of dark red shales, argillaceous sandstones, including nodules of green clay, and quartzose grits with bands of conglomerates of primitive rocks, among which the same red syenite as occurs in the lower red sandstone is most abundant.\n\nThese beds are highly charged with peroxide of iron which gives them a blood-red colour, and magnesia may be detected in all the sandstones, grits, and conglomerates of the group in considerable abundance. All the sandstones are extensively ripple-marked, and along the water courses which intersect the beds, present on their surface a saline efflorescence.\n\nBetween Jelalpore and Pind Dadun Khan, they are largely developed, while towards the Indus they seem to be in a great measure replaced by a series of red, green, purple and chocolate-coloured shales which weather into clays, and from yielding small concretionary masses of copper ore, present considerable interest. These are invariably superior to the sandstone grits and conglomerates. Thin beds of white quartzose grit occasionally traverse the shales, and\nbeds of a coarse silicious sinter containing in some places particles of chalcedony are of frequent occurrence. Throughout the shales selenite or transparent gypsum may be noticed in laminae and crystals, and in small impure concretions of radiating crystals, associated with similar nodular concretions of impure sulphate of barytes and argillaceous haematite. These along with the silicious sinter, have probably been deposited by thermal waters penetrating the shales, the variegated colours of which, may probably result from their having been exposed to different degrees of heat during the prevalence of thermal action. Such coloured clays are, we believe, of frequent occurrence in countries where thermal action is prevalent.\n\nOn tracing the shales upwards they gradually become arenaceous and acquire a greenish colour. A few dark shales then follow and mark the transition into the formation which succeeds.\n\nCopper Ore.\n\nThe existence of copper ore in the Salt Range was first made public by Capt. Hollings, Deputy Commissioner of Le\u00efa. It occurs chiefly in the form of nodular concretions, varying in size from a millet seed to that of a walnut, disseminated through the variegated shales and clays resulting from their disintegration, on the surface of which, particularly after rain, their green colour brings them prominently into view. Small green patches of silicate and carbonate of copper may also be observed in masses of the silicious sinter, which we before mentioned as occurring in the shales. The origin of this concretion is most obscure, but it is probable that the particles of copper in solution in thermal waters were diffused through the shales, and that by a process of crystallization they have aggregated into the form we now find them. Their resemblance to the nodular concretions of ku\u00f1kur found everywhere in the desert alluvial soil throughout the Punjab, induces us to believe that they were formed in a similar way. So complete, however, has been the separation of the particles of copper from the shales in which they are found, that not a trace of copper can be detected in them on submitting small portions to chemical analysis.\n\nThe nodules of copper ore are occasionally very pure, but frequently it forms only the centre of the nodular concretionary masses of sulphate of lime and barytes, which we have above alluded to.\nNo indications of the existence of a vein of ore have been obtained either in the shales or in any rock, superior or inferior to them. In the thin beds of coarse white quartzose grit which occur in the shales, disseminated grains of carbonate and silicate of copper are occasionally to be noticed, but in small quantity.\n\nThe ore is for the most part copper glance or sulphuret of copper, one of the richest and most easily smelted ores. Its surface is generally covered with copper, as the result of the action of air and moisture; indeed in a large number of the nodules, the copper glance can only be detected in their centre\u2014their circumference being converted into carbonate of copper.\n\nThe purer and undecomposed nodules present on fracture a dark leaden-colour, and are sectile. Particles of the ore heated before the blow pipe on charcoal yield a button of metallic copper.\n\nA pure specimen yielded, on analysis, the following results in 100 parts.\n\n| Component                  | Percentage |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| Copper                     | 75.830     |\n| Sulphuret of Soda          | 8.155      |\n| Sulphur                    | 21.        |\n| Peroxide of iron and alumina | .015       |\n\nTotal,... 100.000\n\nThe above analysis shows a much larger percentage of copper, than the concretions usually contain. This from a series of experiments, we believe, to vary from 12 to 20 per cent.\n\nThe quantity of ore seems insignificant, and is only interesting in a minerological point of view. After heavy rain, which disintegrates large quantities of shale, and leaves the green copper concretions exposed to view, a man may, in some localities, collect in the course of a day about an ounce of ore. It seems to be more abundant in some localities than in others. The Nulee hill above Kuttha yielding we believe the largest quantity. We have detected it in almost every deep ravine between Bayaar East of Moosakhail and Kuttha, a distance of not less than forty miles, within which limits the variegated shales are principally developed.\n\nThe only indications of organisms we have detected in this formation are confined to the dark red, schistose sandstones and upper\narenaceous shales. They are most indistinct and are probably the remains of Fucoids.\n\nThe rocks we have described under the term Devonian, form in thickness and extent, perhaps the most striking feature in the geology of the Salt Range, appearing in its steep escarpment subordinate to all the rocks hereafter to be noticed, and in the numerous ravines which intersect it.\n\nOn proceeding westward from Rhotas, they first emerge from under the miocene sandstones on the East flank of mount Tillah, the great mass of which they form, all the subdivisions of the series being duly represented in this mountain (see section No. 4) with the exception of the copper shales. From its West end they may be traced across the Poonah Nullah into the Chumbul Range, where they are flanked to the East by the miocene sandstones of the Imapore hills. On the Gurjah hill above Jelalpore, they are extensively exposed, and form the mass of the Range on to Baghanwalla, where the upper red sandstones attain their greatest thickness. From this point they stretch North for several miles, dipping under the table-land of Besharut and rising up again to form the summit and scarped northern face of mount Kuringali and Drengum, from where they may be traced into Diljubba, where they are for the most part concealed by the extensive Tertiary strata which stretch East to Buknala.\n\nFrom Baghanwalla westward the Devonian rocks can be traced uninterruptedly. Around Kuttha the copper shales first appear, and seem in a great degree to take the place of the upper dark red sandstones, which can scarcely be recognized between that locality and Moosakhail, except in the neighbourhood of Chideru, where thick beds of them occur subordinate to the shales. From Moosakhail on to the Indus, the Devonian formations above the salt marl seem to amalgamate, and the divisions which are so distinctly marked in the East part of the Range can with difficulty be made out, the thickness of the whole gradually diminishing. They disappear altogether around Maree and Kalibagh.\n\nIn the Chichalee Range of hills on the West bank of the Indus below Kalibagh no Devonian rocks crop out, but at the North or up-\nper end of the Kaffee Kote Range near the village of Bahadur Dak a series of red and grey saliferous sandstones appear for a short distance under carboniferous limestone. Numerous brine springs issue from these, which are doubtless the equivalent of the Devonian rocks East of the Indus.\n\nPrimary or Palaeozoic Carboniferous Rocks.\n\nSucceeding the formations last described are a series of limestones and sandstones which, from the abundance of marine organic remains they contain, furnish to the geologist a most invaluable aid in determining the age of various rocks inferior to them.\n\nDuring the very partial examination of the Salt Range, which by orders of Government we made in the month of April 1848, we detected at Moosakhail on our return to Lahore from Kalibagh a development of calcareous strata, which in our report we stated to be evidently superior in geological position to the salt marl. In a few hours devoted to the examination of this locality, a small collection of fossils was obtained, which were sent to England in order, if possible, to have them identified.\n\nThrough the kindness of Sir Roderick Murchison we effected this, and were informed by that distinguished geologist that, the Moosakhail fossils seemed identical with carboniferous forms well known in the British isles.\n\nM. de Verneuil to whom my collection was submitted, identified 5 out of 8 or 9 species with forms well known in rocks of carboniferous age in other parts of the world.\n\nThe circumstance of our having detected what we took for belemnites and ammonites associated with genera characteristic of palaeozoic formations, and misled by the idea entertained by geologists until very recently, that salt deposits were confined to Triassic or more recent rocks, we had great difficulty in bringing ourselves to believe that the Salt Range salt could possibly belong to a formation older than the Trias. The recent announcement, however, of the fact, that in North America the great salt sources issue from the heart of palaeozoic rocks, and that in Russia the salt lies chiefly in the uppermost palaeozoic deposit, and also in the Devonian sandstone, immediately removed all doubts from our minds as to the true age\nof that of the Salt Range, as well as of the calcareous strata of Moosakhail.\n\nThe rocks included under the term carboniferous present in the Salt Range three divisions, which we shall proceed to notice.\n\nA lower limestone, calcareous sandstone, and shales.\n\nThe lower beds of this deposit, when they rest on the Devonian rocks, generally present the characters of a calcareous sandstone of a light grey colour. This gradually passes into a limestone of a very compact and generally crystalline character, varying from a light flesh colour to dark grey, some varieties being nearly black. The beds of this rock, in which occur irregular shaped masses of hornstone, sometimes closely approaching to flint, are frequently parted by thin bands of arenaceous shales. There are frequently a mass of corals and corallines mixed up with shells. The limestones generally abound in encrinites and large brachiopodous Mollusca, and in many localities seem to be composed entirely of the disjointed stems of the former. Their fractured surface presents generally a highly crystalline aspect from the encrinite whorls being converted into calcareous spar.\n\nAlthough generally a purely calcareous formation, in some localities, especially towards the Indus and in the Chichalee hills, it seems to become magnesian and to alter considerably in general appearance. Wherever magnesia prevails, the limestone assumes a cherty aspect, the strata are much disturbed, and frequently shivered, fossils become very scarce, and the same brecciated appearance as is noticed in the Devonian Dolomitic sandstone is very common. The occurrence of magnesia in the limestone is very local, and the same bed may be observed purely calcareous and full of fossils at one point, while half a mile beyond, it is charged with magnesia and scarcely a fossil to be found in it. Although the transition from a calcareous rock to a magnesian one is generally noticed along the strike of the beds, the same change may be observed in some localities extending in a vertical direction; such phenomena have been observed by Sir Roderick Murchison in the Alps, and it has been supposed that the magnesia, subsequently to the formation of such limestones, has been injected into them, and produced a metamorphosis. The absence of fossils too amidst the magnesian limestones has been\naccounted for, by supposing that the mineral acid in union with which the magnesia has been introduced, has in accordance with the known laws of chemical attraction, combined with the calcareous matter of the fossils, and caused their disappearance. A similar theory to account for local deposits of gypsum in the midst of calcareous strata has also been propounded, viz. that vapours of sulphuric acid generated during the prevalence of igneous action, have been injected into limestones, and converted the carbonate into sulphate of lime. The origin of the Salt Range gypsum cannot, however, we conceive, be explained in this way; for if sulphuric acid vapours permeated the marl, they would in all probability have produced partial decomposition of the salt into sulphate of soda, an impurity not to be found in the mineral. The almost entire absence too of carbonate of lime from the gypsum, strengthens the belief that it was originally deposited as such.\n\nOn tracing the limestone upwards, its beds become thinner and less crystalline, and alternate with thin beds of dark magnesian micaceous sandstones and shales. At the upper limit of these in the central part of the Range and Chichalee Hills as well as at Kaffir Kote, a few thin beds of a compact slaty limestone generally of a dark grey colour occur, and seem to mark the transition into the next division.\n\nb. Grey Sandstone and Shales.\n\nThe beds forming this series consist of micaceous fine grained fissile sandstones alternating with beds of dark bituminous shales. Towards their upper limits the sandstones become more compact and of a reddish colour, alternating frequently with beds of slaty limestone similar to those forming the top beds of the division of the series last described. In the upper compact sandstones, ripple markings are common, and in the Bukh Ravine above Moosakhail we detected a most distinct exhibition of markings similar to those produced by rain or hail falling on sand or mud, when in a wet or pasty state. These occur on the upper surface on a bed of sandstone, and were traced along its strike for a considerable distance. The bed dips under other beds of a similar sandstone which present\nripple markings on their surface, and hence we may safely conclude that it has been formed on a beach on which water has ebbed and flowed.\n\nRain-drop-markings similar to the above, have been noticed by Sir Charles Lyell in the states of Massachusetts and Connecticut in red sandstone of Triassic age.\n\nIn all the shales and in most of the sandstones of this series, magnesia prevails, and hence but few fossils occur, those that we have observed being confined to argillaceous sandstones in the immediate neighbourhood of calcareous beds, which are generally free of magnesia impregnation.\n\nc. Upper Limestone.\n\nThe two preceding divisions of the carboniferous series are very distinctly marked wherever it is extensively developed, but east of the Indus there are few localities where the upper limestone is well seen. It forms the summit of the Zinnanee Hill above Chederos (see table No. 8) which is upwards of 1,900 feet above the plain. Here, in mineral character, it is undistinguishable from the more crystalline varieties of the lower limestone, and abounds in encrinites and brachiopoda. About ten miles further west in the Bukhh Ravine which intersects the Salt Range between Nummaal and Moosakhail a grey limestone of a hard and cherty character occurs in a similar position, but, as far as we are aware, devoid of fossils. Its lower beds assume the character of a very fine grained sandstone, and rest on a yellow argillaceous limestone of very fine grain, similar to some lithographic limestones. This limestone dissolves in acid with the separation of a considerable quantity of yellow mud, and its solution yields indication of the presence of a small quantity of magnesia: a few indistinct indications of fish scales were noticed in it.\n\nOn the Zinnanee Hill, the upper limestone is purely calcareous, and dissolves rapidly in muriatic acid, with the separation of a very small quantity of yellow mud. That of the Bukhh Ravine, however, dissolves slowly, and in its solution magnesia may be detected by the usual tests.\nOn analysis it yields in 100 parts:\n\nSilica, ........................................... 4.000\nCarbonate of Lime,.............................. 69.200\nDitto of Magnesia,............................... 25.809\nAlumina with a little Peroxide of Iron, ........ .100\nOrganic Matter and Loss,....................... .891\n\nTotal,... 100.000\n\nThe lower fine-grained sandstone on which the above limestone rests, yields on analysis as follows:\n\nSilicious Quartz Sand, .......................... 86.000\nCarbonate of Lime,.............................. 47.870\nDitto of Magnesia,............................... 14.800\nAlumina and Peroxide of Iron,.................. 1.200\nOrganic Matter and Loss,....................... .130\n\nTotal,... 100.000\n\nOn the west bank of the Indus in the Chichalee Hills, the upper limestone is far more distinct than on its east bank; and is generally cherty and magnesian, and much shivered and brecciated. In the Kaffir Kote Range, a highly bituminous sandstone of a dirty brown colour, appears to be its representative, from which large quantities of petroleum issue, this being probably derived from the spontaneous combustion of dark bituminous shales charged with pyrites, on which the sandstone rests, and which form the upper member of the middle carboniferous series.\n\nThroughout the carboniferous rocks we have described, there appears no indication of true coal measures, which in Britain are invariably associated with the carboniferous or mountain limestone. The latter, in the south of England, forms the base of the coal formation, while in the Scotch coal fields thick seams of coal alternate with beds of carboniferous limestone and intercalated with limestone and sandstone beds of fresh-water origin. In the Salt Range, however, no fresh-water beds have been observed in the carboniferous series.\n\nThe limestones or marbles of this formation can be strongly recommended as highly ornamental and durable building stones.\nThe compact flesh-coloured and nearly black varieties are perhaps to be preferred, as weathering more uniformly than those which are more crystalline. They take a fine polish, and may be obtained in blocks of any size. Vurcha would be a convenient locality for obtaining the flesh-coloured stone, while in the Nursing Wan near Kuttha, the black variety could easily be procured. The flesh-coloured limestone forms the gateway of the ancient fort of Kaffir Kote, where it seems to have resisted the action of the atmosphere in a most remarkable degree, the blocks being as fresh as the day they were quarried.\n\nAs a source of lime, all the limestones of this formation are very valuable. The yellow argillaceous limestone mentioned as occurring in the Bukhh Ravine, is, we believe, well adapted for lithographic purposes, and shales of considerable size might with ease be obtained.\n\nPetroleum, in the carboniferous formation, has been noticed only in the Algud Ravine at Kaffir Kote, where it exudes in considerable quantity from the upper brown bituminous sandstone, which is highly charged with it; where springs issue from the sandstone in the small ravines which intersect its beds, large holes are dug which rapidly fill with water mixed with Petroleum. This from its lighter specific gravity rises to the surface and forms a scum, by passing bunches of grass through which, the Petroleum or Salira as it is called, adheres, and is removed into gurrahs or earthen vessels placed for its reception.\n\nNotwithstanding its most offensive smell, it is burnt by the natives in their lamps. It is also in great demand among the owners of camels, who extol its virtues as an external application to sores and the common cutaneous diseases to which that animal is subject.\n\nSulphuretted hydrogen springs issue from the carboniferous limestone in several localities. In the Bukhh Ravine one issuing from the upper limestone indicated a temperature of 94\u00b0 when the air was 71\u00b0 in the month of February. The water on escaping from the rock, deposits sulphur, and gives a copious black precipitate with a solution of acetate of lead.\n\nFossils are very numerous throughout the formation.\n\nThe lower beds abound in Brachiopodous molluscae, crinoideae,\ncorals, and corallines; of Brachiopoda shells, the genera Producta, Orthis, Spirifer and Terebratula are most abundant. Along with the Brachiopoda we have obtained one or two Gasteropoda, but these are generally scarce.\n\nIn several localities we have found large spines of a species of Cidaris, some of these being very perfect and tuberculated, the articulating end of the spine being well preserved.\n\nThough this is the case, the shell of the animal occurs but rarely, and only, as far as we have observed, in comminuted fragments.\n\nThe abundance of crinoid\u00e6 is very remarkable, whole beds of rock being built up of encrinites, the whorls of which are frequently of large size, and occasionally are found in connection with their lily head.\n\nTowards the upper part of the lower division of the series, where the limestone becomes argillaceous and thin-bedded and alternates with coarse arenaceous shales, the Brachiopoda become scarce and give place to Cephalopoda, which animals characterize a marine zone of less depth than the Brachiopoda which precede them, and generally occur in seas with muddy bottoms. We have obtained examples of species of the genera Bellerophon, Goniatites (?) and Orthoceras. Associated with these large spiral univalves of the genus Cirrus and Enomphalus are abundant, and, in the slaty limestone at the top of the lower division of the carboniferous series, and also in the middle division, a Cephalopodous shell formerly considered an ammonite, but now constituted into the genus Ceratitis abounds, and is generally associated with a small bivalve, probably a species of Passidonia. As Ceratites have hitherto been considered as characteristic of rocks of triassic age and peculiar to the muschelkalk, their occurrence in company with undoubted carboniferous types is highly interesting. We have placed the matter beyond doubt, having in our possession a specimen* which we obtained at Moosakhail in which two Orthoceratites and seven Ceratites are lying side by side in a slab 9 in. \u00d7 5 in.; Orthoceratites have never been found\n\n* Through the kindness of Cavendish Johnson, Esq. Asstt. Surgn. 3rd Regt. N. I. we are enabled to submit a drawing of this most interesting specimen, which we believe to be unique in the annals of Geology.\nin strata superior to the carboniferous limestone, but abound throughout the older fossiliferous rocks.\n\nFossils having a considerable resemblance to belemnites occur in the carboniferous limestone associated with the fossils we have alluded to. What they really are, we are unable to determine; but as a set of specimens were sent home to England in March, at the request of Sir Roderick Murchison, we trust soon to hear the result of his examination of them. The exact determination of their nature is of considerable importance, as there is perhaps not a more established fact in geology than that belemnites are confined to strata which succeed the trias; abounding in the seas, oolite and chalk, after which they disappear from the page of geologic history.\n\nIn the same flag limestone in which the Ceratitis occurs, Ichthyolite remains were obtained in the shape of small sharp and finely striated teeth covered with a shining brown enamel, small fragments of bone and one or two scales have also been procured, the identification of which as well as of a rather extensive collection of fossils from the Salt Range, cannot be effected in our present position with neither collections nor books of reference available. The whole collection will be sent home to England, where the fossils can be satisfactorily examined.\n\nThe following species of shells from the Moosakhail limestone were identified in 1849, by M. de Verneuil.\n\nProducta Cara. D'Orbigny.\n\u201e costata. Sowerby.\nFlemingii. Sowerby.\nOrthis crenistria. Phill.\nTerebratula Royssii. L'Eveille.\n\nOn the above, Sir Roderick Murchison remarks, in a communication addressed to the Geological Society in December 1850, \"these fossils have already been known to have an enormous geographical range, the Producta Cara. occurring in Peru, Spitzbergen, northern Europe and the Sierra Morena of Spain, whilst two or three of the other species, have an almost equally extensive distribution.\"\n\nThe carboniferous formation, the thickness of which, when well developed, is probably not less than 1800 feet, is entirely confined\nto the central portion and western end of the Salt Range. It first appears at Noorpoor in the Nilawan ravine, where a thin bed of a crystalline grey limestone containing a few Encrinites and Terebratulae, may be seen resting on purple Devonian shales and covered by a ferruginous claystone which marks the base of the nummulite limestone formation, to be hereafter described. On tracing it westward it gradually increases in thickness. Product\u00e6 and Spirifer\u00e6 appear, and in some places literally swarm. At Kuttha it is extensively developed in the Nursingwan, where high cliffs of it may be seen resting on Devonian rocks.\n\nBetween Kuttha and Moosakhail, it perhaps attains its greatest thickness, frequently appearing in scarped precipices and forming the mass of the hills which intervene between the south side of the Salt Range and the Sam-Sekisur valley.\n\nIn this district rocks, probably of an oolitic age, appear between the carboniferous ones and the nummulite limestone, and this relation may be observed on to the Indus and in the Chichalee hills.\n\nFor a short distance on both sides of the Indus near Maree and Kalibagh, the carboniferous rocks disappear; but at Kooch about four miles North of Kalibagh, they again crop out at the base of the Chichalee range, and may be traced south to near Mulakhail, where they are covered up by the oolitic and tertiary formations.\n\nThey again appear on the right bank of the Indus below the village of Bahadur Dak, and constitute the greater part of the Kaffir Kote Range, (washed by the Indus,) beyond the upper part of which we have not traced them. As this Range stretches south and is evidently a branch from the great Soohinan Range, it is probable that the carboniferous rocks occur there also, but the hostility of the hill tribes in its neighbourhood will, we fear, for years to come prevent any attempts to gain a knowledge of its geological structure.\n\nIn the Kaffir Kote Range, as far as we have had an opportunity of examining it, the carboniferous rocks are immediately in relation with tertiary sandstones and clays, no nummulite limestone or Oolitic rocks intervening; unless the bituminous brown sandstone, which we now consider the representative of the upper member of the carboniferous series, should turn out to be Oolitic.\nSecondary Oolitic Rocks.\n\na. Yellow, iron-stained, quartzose sandstone, grits and bituminous shales.\n\nResting on the upper carboniferous rocks and separated from them by a few thin beds of a yellow argillaceous limestone, there occur a series of fissile argillaceous sandstones, and coarse quartzose grits and sandstones, generally of an incoherent character, alternating with beds of black bituminous shales charged with iron pyrites. The prevailing colour of the sandstones is a sickly yellow, derived from impregnation with peroxide of iron. Masses of fossil wood converted into jet are abundant, both in the sandstones and grits. These also in some places occur in the shales, which, where exposed to air and moisture, are in a constant state of decomposition from the oxidation of their contained pyrites. So violent is the action and so great the heat produced, that sometimes the shales undergo spontaneous combustion, and whole beds may be observed either converted, or in process of being so, into a ferruginous claystone of a dark red colour, which occasionally presents a kind of concretionary structure.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of these decomposing shales and claystones, the sandstones and grits acquire a whitened and baked appearance, and the masses of jet they contain, are frequently converted into coke.\n\nWhere the shales are moist, their surface is generally incrusted with an efflorescence of sulphate of iron and alumina, which strongly impregnate the water of springs which issue from them in some ravines, and which on exposure to the air, deposits on the ground over which it flows a crust of hydrated peroxide of iron. In some of the shale beds in the upper part of the series, a magnesian efflorescence has been noticed, but the sandstones and grits seem altogether free of magnesian impregnation.\n\nThe lower argillaceous beds occasionally contain very perfect impressions of the delicate fronds of ferns, converted into black carbonaceous matter. These are doubtless of fresh water origin and, from the fineness of the sand and mud of which they are composed, must have been deposited in still water.\n\nThe grits which succeed them and contain masses of jet are also probably of fresh-water origin, but the fact of the latter being found only in masses, which are evidently portions of the trunks and\nbranches of trees, and invariably in a horizontal position, affords proof that they have been transported from a distance along with the coarse materials forming the grits.\n\nNo marine organic remains occur throughout these beds, which are succeeded by others of undoubted marine origin, and differing greatly in mineral character.\n\nb. Cherty thin bedded limestones with shales.\n\nThe sandstones, &c. last described gradually acquire calcareous matter, and pass into fine grained limestones of a cherty character, varying in colour from nearly black, to a pale yellow. East of the Indus, these beds are of little thickness and contain very few organic remains.\n\nAt Kalibagh and in the Chichalee hills they alternate with yellow calcareous sandstones and dark bituminous shales and attain a thickness of three or four hundred feet in some localities.\n\nMarine organic remains are abundant, particularly in the upper limestones, and some of the intermediate beds are a mass of comminuted shells.\n\nThroughout the Chichalee Range a very singular brown calcareous bed occurs near the bottom of the series, in which small globules of a bright metallic lustre may be observed mixed up with comminuted shells. On treating a fragment of this rock with muriatic acid the calcareous matter rapidly dissolves, leaving the globules in the form of a coarse sand, the particles of which have a highly polished surface, and have all the appearance of being the debris of hypersthene rock.\n\nNo distinct oolitic structure prevails throughout the limestones, which differ totally in appearance from those of the carboniferous rocks. Some of them bear a close resemblance to the limestones of the lias formation.\n\nThey are hard and splintery and present a conchoidal fracture. When bruised, the darker varieties emit the odour of sulphuretted hydrogen.\n\nThey dissolve rapidly in muriatic acid, leaving a considerable sediment of silica in flakes mixed with a little organic matter. They contain a little carbonate of iron with a trace of alumina, but no magnesia when undisturbed. At Kalibagh, however, where large masses of the limestone repose on salt marl, they have a remarkably shivered\nappearance, and magnesia may be detected in them in small quantities. A specimen of the limestone of a dark grey colour from Umlakhail in the Chichalee Range yielded on analysis the following results:\u2014\n\nSilica with a little organic matter, .................. 8.00\nCarbonate of iron with a trace of Alumina, .......... 1.70\nCarbonate of Lime, ..................................... 95.70\n\n100.40\n\nAt Umlakhail a bed of argillaceous limestone occurs presenting on its upper surface a series of waves passing across the bed at right angles to its strike. These are about 1\u00bd feet apart, and their crest about two inches above the general level of the bed. It presents the appearance represented in the annexed figure. A bed of shale, which occurs beneath it, is, for a short distance, affected in a similar way; but the surface of a limestone bed on which the shale rests, is perfectly horizontal, and does not seem to have suffered in the least from the lateral compression to which the upper bed has been subjected. The force exerted seems to have been nearly sufficient to have fractured the bed, as, along the crests of some of the waves and parallel to these, cracks may be observed extending some depth into the bed, which is not more than two feet thick. It is difficult to imagine how any lateral force could have been applied, so as only to affect one or two beds. The condition of the beds superior to the waved one could not be ascertained, on account of the amount of debris with which they were covered.\n\nc. Green Belemnite, Sandstone and Shales.\n\nIn the Salt Range east of the Indus the limestones last noticed are succeeded by a thin bed of yellow quartzose grit, containing a few fragments of jet. At Kalibagh and in the Chichalee Range a series of black bituminous shales succeeded by a dark green somewhat incoherent sandstone intervene, presenting a thickness of four or five hundred feet. The latter is full of pyrites, which rapidly decomposes after rain, sulphurous acid being given off in quantity at times sufficient to be disagreeable.\nSmall fragments of jet occur in the sandstone, and both in it and the shales, belemnites, and ammonites occur in great abundance. These fossils are of great interest, as enabling us to fix the age of the formation.\n\nAll along the Chichalee Range the belemnite shales and sandstone are well developed, and are succeeded by the quartzose grit noticed above, which apparently contains no fossils.\n\nIn the oolitic formation there are no building stones of any value; but many of the limestones are valuable as a source of lime.\n\nOf minerals, we shall notice the bituminous shales, iron-alum, jet or fossil wood and argillaceous iron-stone.\n\nThe bituminous shales which alternate with the sandstones and grits are occasionally used at Kalibagh in the preparation of alum. Some of them are well adapted for this purpose, but, generally speaking, they are very inferior to the shales of the nummulite limestone formation to be hereafter described.\n\nIron-alum forms, as before mentioned, an incrustation on the surface of the bituminous shales and masses of jet which contain iron pyrites in a state of decomposition. It is called \"kaie\" by the natives and is extensively used by them, when mixed with an infusion of pomegranate or other astringent bark, containing tannin for the preparation of a black dye. Its colour is white with a tinge of yellow. It gives a strong acid reaction, and has a most powerfully astringent taste. Peroxide of iron and alumina are indicated in its solution, by the usual tests, in union with sulphuric acid. In the Bukkh Ravine at Moosakhail, it is collected in considerable quantity.\n\nFossil wood in this form of jet occurs in too insignificant quantity in the Salt Range east of the Indus to have attracted much attention. In a ravine, however, about a mile west of Kalibagh, it occurs in considerable abundance, and under the designation of Kalibagh coal has been employed within the last two years to some extent as a fuel in the Indus steamers. Its existence was, we believe, first brought to the notice of Government by Burnes and Wood, and has since been reported on by Dr. Jamieson and myself.\n\nIt is found in lumps of various sizes in dark bituminous shales alternating with yellow sandstones; but nothing like a seam has been detected, though films of bituminous coal may in some places\nbe seen in the shales. The masses of coal are generally compressed, and are evidently portions of the trunks and branches of trees, the point of junction of the former with the latter being often apparent.\n\nThough distributed throughout all the shale beds, the coal occurs most abundantly in one of these, which is from six to eight feet thick, and is enclosed between beds of yellow sandstone, in which masses of the coal also occur. It has for the last two years been chiefly obtained from the shale-bed at a point where owing to a fracture and upheaval of the strata, a portion of them have been thrown into a nearly vertical position, as represented in the annexed rough sketch.\n\nLine of section from north to south distance about 1 mile.\n\n1 Conglomerate, soft sandstone and red clays.\n2 Nummulite limestone and alum shales.\n3 (A.) Belemnite shales (B.) cherty limestones.\n(C.) Quartzose sandstones and grits with beds of bituminous shales.\n3 A., 2 A. and 1 A. The same beds in reversed order.\n\nBy digging a succession of holes at different heights in the vertical shale-bed, the masses of coal are obtained with much greater ease, than where the bed in a\nregular position dips to the north at an angle of 45\u00b0 under the superior rocks.\n\nIn the vertical bed a gallery has been sunk to the depth of fifty feet in hopes of discovering a seam of coal, but, as was to be expected, with an unfavourable result. Indeed, the labour expended in digging the gallery has not been rewarded, by obtaining a larger quantity of coal, the masses of which, we were informed by the miners, became less numerous and more difficult to detach from the shale the deeper they dug. As it is most probable that the wood now connected with coal has been drifted from the spot where it grew, it is natural to infer, that the masses of it would accumulate more abundantly in some places than in others, just as drift wood does on the bank of a river. This appears to be the case at Kalibagh, as in some places the shale contains numerous masses of coal, while at others scarcely a fragment is to be detected.\n\nThe coal has a bright glistening appearance, is very hard and light, and exhibits a conchoidal fracture in which its woody structure is most apparent. It is of a jet-black colour, has a brown streak, and often incloses nests of half decomposed wood resembling peat. The surface of the coal often presents small crystals of gypsum, and imbedded masses of iron pyrites are by no means uncommon.\n\nIt burns quickly, without coking, to a light coloured ash and emits a large amount of yellow smoky flame; on being distilled it yields a light spongy coke of a glistening metallic colour with a large quantity of inflammable gas. On analysis the following results were obtained in 100 parts:\n\n| Component                        | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Carbon (coke)                    | 37.5       |\n| Volatile bituminous inflammable matter | 60.0      |\n| Ashes (Silica)                   | 2.5        |\n\nTotal, 100.0\n\nThe large amount of volatile bituminous matter as compared to that of coke, at once refers this coal to the class of lignites or coals in which the vegetable matter is imperfectly carbonized. In its small amount of ash (which in some specimens we have found as low as 1.68 per cent.) it differs remarkably from most of these, but the solid nature of the wood forming the coal, not admitting of the infiltration of earthy matter may account for this.\nIn an analysis, however, such as the above, the amount of ash obtained will invariably be less, than if a large sample of the coal were operated on, as the masses have invariably attached to them portions of the sand, clay, &c. in which they were imbedded. These mechanical impurities fusing and forming a slag or clinker in furnaces during the combustion of the coal, have been found troublesome.\n\nThe Kalibagh coal is for ordinary steam purposes an excellent fuel, but not an economical one, on account of the rapidity with which it burns.\n\nThe real evaporative power of coals is in the direct ratio to the amount of carbon or coke they contain, and hence as good English coal yields from 50 to 70 per cent. Kalibagh coal should have only half their evaporative power, and about twice that of the ordinary woods used as fuel in the Indus steamers, which yield from 16 to 18 per cent. of solid charcoal.\n\nThe coal can only be procured in small quantities at a time, months being required to collect a few hundred maunds. During 1850 about 2,500 maunds were dug, and from the 27th March 1851 to the 11th March 1852, 2,126 maunds were turned out and landed at Kalibagh on the right bank of the Indus, at the rate of eight maunds for the Rupee, a rate which never can remunerate the miners for any length of time for the labour required to extract the mineral.\n\nThe ordinary small Indus steamers consume English coal at the rate of 600 lbs. an hour when steaming, and hence on the supposition that double the quantity of Kalibagh coal is required, 200,000 lbs. (2500 maunds) the output of coal for one year at Kalibagh would only keep one vessel steaming for 166 hours. We see no prospect of the supply of coal increasing, nay the quantity obtainable, as far as we could ascertain from intercourse with the miners, seems gradually decreasing.\n\nIn the absence of any thing like a seam of coal at Kalibagh, we do not consider it expedient for Government to spend money there in sinking exploratory shafts.\n\nThe coal has all to be carried on bullocks, mules or donkeys from the pits to Kalibagh over a tolerable hill road, but as it is very hard it stands carriage remarkably well.\n\nClay ironstone has not been observed East of the Indus, but in\nthe oolitic shales at Musakhail, in the Chichalee Range we detected several thin beds of it, none of which exceeded $1\\frac{1}{2}$ or 2 inches in thickness.\n\nIt is of a dark grey colour and has a high specific gravity.\n\nIt dissolves with slight effervescence in aqua regia, leaving a considerable residue of dark mud. The solution is of a dark yellow colour and gives with ammonia a dense brown precipitate of peroxide of iron mixed with a little alumina.\n\nIt is therefore analogous to the block hard ironstone of Scotland, which, occurring as it does in connection with coal, is perhaps one of the most valuable iron ores known.\n\nIt would be interesting to ascertain if this ore is ever used at Kuneegoornul by the Wuzeerees, to yield the iron manufactured there, and which is brought into Kalibagh for sale in lumps of very coarse pig iron. We believe h\u00e6matite ore is chiefly employed, but from what rock it is procured, we could obtain no information. Charcoal is used for the smelting of the ore, no other fuel being accessible.\n\nThe beds of clay ironstone above noticed are too small to be of much practical importance, and, even did thicker beds exist, the want of a suitable fuel for the fusion of the ore, would prevent its being smelted at any thing like a remunerative rate.\n\nIn the lower argillaceous sandstone beds of this formation, we obtained at Moosakhail and also in the neighbourhood of Kalibagh very perfect carbonaceous impressions of the delicate fronds of a small fern, probably a species of Pecoptaris. These were associated with small pieces of brown coal, which are evidently the compressed stems of soft vegetables. Their remains, however, were too indistinct to admit of their being identified. The masses of jet described as Kalibagh coal present on fracture a woody structure similar to that of the wood of Coniferae or Cycadaceae, numerous concentric circles of growth pierced by medullary plates being apparent in most specimens. Some Peeteus, Ostreae, Terebratulae and fragments of Echinidae occur in the limestones, in the upper beds of which a few belemnites were detected.\n\nThese latter however abound in the shales and green sandstones which succeed the limestone, and are associated with Ammonites, Gryphae\u00e6, Plagiostoma and saurian remains.\nThe number of belemnites in the shales in some places is quite wonderful, and two species at least occur. The alveoli of the belemnites are frequently found attached to the osselit, and in their interior the casts of the chambers of the alveolus or phragmacone. These are often found detached, and when seen in the rock, have much the appearance of an orthoceratite, being composed of concave or convex discs, fitting one into the other, and having thin articulating surfaces highly polished. Indeed were it not for the want of a siphuncle and the ease with which a disc can be separated from its neighbour, the similarity to an orthoceratite would be complete. Each disc seems entirely disconnected from its fellow; but no partition of the original chambers could be detected between them, the convex surface of the upper disc being capable apparently of free movement on the concave surface of the lower one, as in a ball and socket joint. These discs are sometimes of large size, one specimen which we procured being two inches in diameter.\n\nAmmonites, though occurring in the shales, are most abundant in the green sandstone. They are generally ill preserved and are liable to fall to pieces in extracting them, having been acted on by the sulphurous acid, which is generated in the sandstone by the decomposition of pyrites. Two or three species have been procured.\n\nOf the genus Gryphea, we have obtained probably two species, one of which closely resembles the G. incurva. They are generally ill preserved.\n\nA large bi-valve, probably a species of Plagiostoma, is very abundant in the green sandstone, but good specimens are with difficulty procurable.\n\nIn some places bones and teeth of saurians occur in the sandstones, but are nowhere plentiful. The bones are generally fragmentary, very brittle and crumbly. Nothing like a complete skeleton was observed, the most perfect relic obtained being a portion of a scapula attached to a bit of a humerus. The teeth are better preserved than the bones, but are also very brittle. They are covered with a dark brown enamel, are compressed, sharp pointed and beautifully striated on their surface. One, which we found, but which fell into fragments in attempting to extract it, was at least three inches long and about an inch broad at the base. The decomposition which the\nsandstone is undergoing near the surface, destroys rapidly the fossils which are imbedded in it, and hence, to obtain good specimens, the fresh rock must be quarried. This we had neither the time nor means of doing at our command, and hence were reluctantly forced to be content with such specimens as we could procure from the decomposing rock.\n\nA claw, apparently of a crustacean, was observed in the sandstone, but it fell into fragments in digging it out.\n\nAll the fossils we have noticed are characteristic of the lias and the oolite; but from the general aspect of the rocks we have described, we are inclined to refer them to the latter formation. The green sandstone and shales are probably analogous to the Oxford clay; but an examination of the fossils by competent palaeontologists can alone decide the point.\n\nA formation abounding in oolitic fossils similar to those we have noticed, has been described by Capt. Grant, Bombay Engineers, as occurring in Cutch, and Capt. Strachey has also detected a like formation in the Himalayas, both on their Indian and Thibet sides. In the Rajmahal hills Dr. McLelland, on the slender evidence afforded by the existence of a few species of fossil plants of the genera Zamia, T\u00e6niopteris and Poacites, refers \"certain greyish and bluish white indurated clays, rendered slaty in places by the abundance of leaves of plants they contain,\" to the inferior oolite.\n\nNo oolitic rocks appear in the Salt Range in its eastern part. In the hills South of Koofree at the West end of the Sone Sikesur valley, a few shales and sandstones here and there appear under the debris of nummulite limestone rocks. Their thickness gradually increases in a westerly direction; and, on the steep south-east side of mount Sikesur, the oolitic strata are distinctly seen between the carboniferous limestone and nummulitic rocks. From mount Sikesur they may be uninterruptedly traced towards the Indus, preserving throughout a remarkably uniform character. From Kalibagh they stretch round into the Chichalee Range, preserving the same relations as in the Salt Range, but are of great thickness. Excellent sections of them are obtained in the Chichalee pass and in the Ravines between that and Mulokhail; about six miles below which they seem to throw out and to be covered up by nummulite lime-\nstone. They do not appear in the upper part of the Kaffir Kote Range as far as we have observed, but it is probable that oolitic strata again re-appear in the Sooliman Range, as we have seen belemnites brought by natives from the hills near Dera Ghazee Khan. These may probably be an extension of the Cutch strata before alluded to.\n\n(To be Continued.)\n\nSupplementary Notice on the new Mineral Resin, Hircine.\u2014By Henry Piddington, Curator Museum of Economic Geology.\n\nMy first notice of this singular and new substance will be found in the Journal No. I. of 1852, p. 76.\n\nBeing in correspondence on other matters with Dr. Dawson of Rangoon, so advantageously known in Calcutta by his humane establishment of the Seamen's Hospital at that port, I sent him a minute fragment from our specimen, requesting he would be good enough, if he did not know it, to make enquiries regarding it. His answer just received gives so clear an account of what it is, that I think it well worth putting upon record. It will be seen that my conjecture as to its being a mineral Resin was correct, and we have thus one more added to the list of these singular and mysterious substances. Dr. Dawson writes as follows:\n\n\"By the arrival, the other day of 'Fire Queen,' I was put in possession of your kind note, dated December the 12th accompanied by a specimen piece of the new resinous Mineral 'Hireine,' and the paper which you had written and printed upon the subject.\n\n\"As early as June 1851, this particular substance attracted my attention, in connection with a miscellaneous collection of minerals, metals, models of machines and a variety of domestic articles, I was then engaged in making, for a Museum in Philadelphia. I found it in the bazar in rather small bits, in the shops of some of the Burmese druggists. This mineral I am informed, is procurable in Burmah, in that section of the country which abounds in the celebrated\npetroleum wells. It is dug up out of the ground, at a considerable depth, ranging from one to two hundred feet below the surface. The day before yesterday, an intelligent Burman mentioned to me, that he once saw, not longer, he thought, than four years ago a lump of it about 5 Viss in weight, obtained in that locality, after a great deal of trouble in digging, as a specimen for the present king of Ava. It seems to have two names among those who are acquainted with the article, our name is *Khouk* a stone, and *pa young* \u2014wax; stone wax. The other is, *perai-yet*, which has no particular meaning that I can learn. I have been also told, that there is another variety of this identical substance, which is of a high translucent colour, somewhat resembling spermaceti. It is derived, the natives tell me, from the same district, though I have never seen any of it. One is commonly called the *white* kind, the other, or that which you have experimented upon being the *black* sort. The Burmese, it appears apply it to no special purpose, either in medicine, or the arts, but the alchemists, a class whom we still find in this part of the globe; employ it in their attempts to effect the transmutation of the baser metals.\n\n\"Before the war commenced, and the consequent destruction of Rangoon, a few pieces of the brown kind could have been readily picked up in the druggists' shops, but now after a most diligent search, I regret to say, that not a single specimen of it can be found. Hereafter when the country above Prome is open to traffic, it will naturally find its way down to our bazar as formerly, when I shall not fail to remember your request.\n\n\"If it would not be giving you too much trouble, would you be so kind as to send a copy of your paper on 'Hircine' to my friend, Professor James Bryan, M. D. Corner of Tenth and Arch Streets, Philadelphia, U. S., to whom the specimens I have already referred to were forwarded. The gentleman who may examine them, will thus be made aware of the researches you have instituted upon the subject of this new mineral.\"\nThe ancient City of Kansonapuri now called Rungamutty.\u2014By Capt. F. P. Layard.\n\nTwelve miles South of Moorshedabad, on the right bank of the river Bhaghirutti, rise the high red cliffs of Rungamutty, on which at present stands an extensive village peopled by many busy families employed in the neighbouring silk Filatures.\n\nAbout six or seven years ago the river, in its ever changing course, commenced impinging on the Rungamutty cliff, which at length became undermined and fell in large masses, exposing many ancient foundations of walls, deep wells long filled up with the earth of ages, and, as usual in exhumed eastern cities, innumerable fragments of pottery. These remains, together with the traces of numerous old tanks and mounds, scattered over the low plain, lying between the high ground of Rungamutty and the village of Gowkurn, about four miles distant, had long impressed me with the idea that some old forgotten city had once occupied this spot.\n\nMy suppositions were confirmed on perusing Major Wilford's able Essay on the Gangetic Provinces, contained in the IX. vol. of the Researches of the Bengal Asiatic Society. He there states, according to information furnished by Lieut. Hoare, that by tradition, the king of Lanca, (representing either Ceylon or Java) invaded the country of Bengal with a powerful fleet, and sailed up the Ganges\u2020 as far as Rungamutty, then called C\u00f3sumap\u00fari, a considerable place where the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bengal often resided, and that the invaders plundered the country and destroyed the city.\n\nIf my informants are correct, Lieut. Hoare must have given the name under a misapprehension of sound, as I was careful to have the name written before me in the native character, which distinctly read Kansonapuri or Kurn-sona-ka-ghur, the city of the golden ear. The tradition relating to the visit of the king of Lanca was also given to me, but with a different version.\n\nThe city of Kansonapuri is said to have been built many hundreds\n\n* Composed according to Capt. Sherwill of red and yellow ferruginous tough clay, embedding nodules of pisiform iron ore and black mica (decomposing).\n\u2020 Evident traces exist of the Bhaghirutti having, at this spot, been formerly the main bed of the Ganges, before it changed its course towards Bauleah and Padna.\nof years ago, by a famous Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Bengal named Kurn S\u00e9n, who resided chiefly at Gour. He erected also a country palace about four miles distant, which was called after him Gowkurn from the circumstance of his ears being of gold and shaped like those of a cow!\n\nMany interesting spots connected with legends and traditions of the ancient city are still pointed out, such as the Demon's mount and the Rajbarree or palace of Kurn S\u00e9n. The remains of the moat of the Rajbarree are distinctly traceable on three sides, although now under cultivation; the fourth has disappeared in the river. On the eastern face of the Rajbarree, stood, a few years ago, the ruins of a very ancient gateway with two large entrances, called by the people of the neighbouring village of Juddoopore, Boorj or the tower; it has entirely disappeared, having crumbled away with the falling bank into the rapid stream below.\n\nNear this spot on the margin of an old tank called B\u00e9l Talao, is said to have stood the Cutchery or Court of Justice of Raja Kurn S\u00e9n.\n\nWest of the factory, near a tank called Jummoona Talao, was the Puttur Ghur or stone fort, in former days, overhanging the river; nothing now remains of this building, but a low mound indicating its site and numerous fragments of stone. A curious six-armed image was found in the bed of the tank some years ago, and transferred to the foot of the magnificent Banian tree at Rungamutty, where, I regret to say, it has been sadly mutilated and destroyed.\n\nIt represents a figure kneeling on one knee, and is said by the people of the place to be Bemi Ka Thakoorain, but I should fancy the goddess K\u00e1li is intended. The two outer or front arms have been broken off, the centre right arm apparently holds what may have been a human victim suspended by the feet, but the object is too much injured to form any correct idea of its original shape. The hinder right arm is in the act of drawing an arrow from a quiver suspended at the back of the goddess, whilst the corresponding arm on the left holds the bow. The centre left arm appears to support a lotus flower or other insignia, but the upper part of the figure has been too much mutilated to trace any thing correctly.\n\nI annex a little sketch of the stone to illustrate the description.\nBlack stone Image found in the Summana Talao at Rungamatti\nOn the site of the ancient City of Hansanapuri\nAbstract of a Journal kept by Mr. Gardiner during his travels in Central Asia\u2014with a Note and Introduction.\u2014By M. P. Edgeworth, Esq., B. C. S.\n\nAs every contribution to the geography of little known regions is interesting, I submit the following extracts and abstract of a journal kept by Mr. Gardiner. These journals were lent by him to the late Sir Alex. Burnes in Cabul, and but partially recovered. They were written, he informs me, mostly on scraps of paper at the time, and during a subsequent residence in Cabul thrown into the shape they now have, occupying several volumes of country paper. Two volumes remained in Col. Burnes' hands, and were lost at the time of the Cabul disasters. One of these unfortunately, related to the journey through Cafferistan. The route taken by Mr. Gardiner is in most parts quite different from that followed by any European traveller; he merely crosses the routes of Lieut. Wood and Mr. Moorcroft; the late travellers Messrs. Winterbottom, Agnew, and Lieut. Young, in 1848, penetrated into Gilget, and the boundary Commissioners, Messrs. Cunningham and Strachey with Dr. Thomson, came on his route near the Kara Korum, leaving the central region traversed by Mr. Gardiner still unexplored.\n\nI have not made any attempt to compare the routes and inductions of Mr. Gardiner with those travellers, as I have neither the materials nor leisure requisite for the purpose; I give a bare abstract of his route with brief descriptions of the country and remarkable objects. I also give one specimen at greater length of his visit to one very remarkable spot. I cannot but think that were Mr. Gardiner's rough materials placed in good hands, and the losses above noted replaced, a most interesting book of travels might be constructed.\n\nFebruary 9th, 1853.\n\nM. Pakenham Edgeworth.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nMr. Gardiner is son of a Dr. Gardiner in the Mexican service. He was educated for several years at the Jesuit College of Clongoose in Ireland. On his father's death in 1823, he left Mexico with the intention of joining his elder brother, who was in the Rus-\nsian engineering service at Astracan, in a Portuguese brigantine for Lisbon.\n\nThere he met with a Mr. Aylmer connected with the Principal of Clongoose, who induced him to go with him to Egypt. Mr. Gardiner then became acquainted with Messrs. Datterwitz, two German mineralogists, and another M. Musaix, a Frenchman, and travelled with them overland to Astracan, joining the Diarbekr caravan returning from Mecca to Tribizond, thence by water to a roadstead between Vudaun and Kark. Thence by land to the north of the Caucasus\u2014misguided, they were in great danger from the natives at Anacuck, but escaped and reached Georest and Astracan in safety. Found his brother living in the island of Kumchnoe opposite Guricoe.\n\nMr. Gardiner remained there till 1829, preparing himself for the Russian Engineers, when all his prospects were blasted by the death of his brother. Claims on the part of the Russian Government for settlement of accounts balanced, absorbed all his brother's estate. He determined to return to America; but Mr. Datterwitz with a M. Shrotzky returned from Orenburg and induced him to accompany them to Persia.\n\nFrom Astracan, about the beginning of September, they proceeded to Karazan where they were joined by a traveller, M. Martigny, who had been examining the coral island in the volcanic range to the East of the Caspian. In November the party had to take refuge from storms in Kramwood bay, North of Balkan. After much delay and contrary winds they reached Astrabad\u2014there M. Martigny and Datterwitz separated and M. Shrotzky remained with Mr. G.\u2014and they proceeded Eastward with the intention of procuring service in the Punjab, in consequence of reports they had heard from a M. Musaix, (nephew of his former companion.)\n\nThis course brought them to Herat where the Journal commences.\n\nJournal.\n\nJan. 24th.\u2014Mr. Gardiner left Herat with a small caffil of returned pilgrims for Koondooz. Passed by an unfrequented road East of Bamian, through the Hazari country, for sixteen days: the marches about twelve miles\u2014owing to numerous ravines and streams,\nsome stages were three or four miles only; a very barren region, but heard that to N. W. and towards Killi Nob it was fertile.\n\nFeb. 8th.\u2014Reached Khoorzzi, a Kimorx or scattered village, each house separate\u2014in the most convenient place for a farm. Here had to part with ponies, &c. The country of the Kalsubi\u2014who inhabit caves or Dror during the winter, and in summer dwellings called B\u00e9leej;\u2014they were anciently called Y\u00e1patz; have dark brown or red beards, live by hunting, and use both cross-bows (kylesh) and common bow or kaman. They shoot their large bow reclining, holding the bow with their feet and pulling the string with both hands.\n\n14th.\u2014Most of the party hence went round by Bamian. Proceeded; road very rugged, and much fording through icy water; halted at a grassy place among precipices.\n\n15th.\u2014Similar rugged country; halt at a basin of water on top of a black flinty rock, three hundred yards round and of great depth. Caught trout with blood red scales on it, but not allowed to eat them as the place was holy; no visible ruins, but the place was said to have been a city; some rude sculptures and a rock.\n\n16th.\u2014Through precipices of Basalt or granite, reach the Dror (in the dark) of Khalyze.\n\n17th.\u2014At the Dror\u2014Khalgubys are Turkoman conquerors, Ther\u00e9s the aborigines.\n\n18th.\u2014Proceeded along bed of a mountain torrent; ascended, but snow too deep in the pass; had to return and go round by a dark narrow pass closed by rocks overhead, called Hersh\u2019s dark pass; ascended to a boggy valley full of deep well-shaped chasms.\n\nAscending over a great spur; saw forest, and a valley said to lead in five days to Hamidan. Halted at a village called Th\u00e1gush. Lead and copper found in the neighbourhood; rock limestone resting on granite.\n\n19th.\u2014Robbed by our coolies: heavy rain detained the party.\n\n20th.\u2014Delayed on account of swollen torrents. Visit a great cave, and on polished floor a colossal figure, eighteen feet long.\n\nThere saw grand cataracts under natural bridge.\n\n21st.\u2014Proceed\u2014pass a cave in limestone at its junction with granite.\nViolent shock of earthquake; earth split, &c.; said to be not common.\n\nCross a deep chasm by basket and rope, over the Chiganook or Sir-i-Moon, being the source of the Morztab; a perilous passage along a cliff on pegs stuck in the rock.\n\nNaeb Therman Khan's dwelling, Droo. Detained; the direct road ahead impassable by snow\u2014might have retraced path to Chiganook, and thence over hills to Deh Kush, the Ab-i-deb river, and so to Balk.\n\nStrolled to rope-ladder bridge.\n\n23rd.\u2014Garden of pomegranate and mulberry.\n\n24th.\u2014Visit the Mohcuns and alkaline lake.\n\n25th.\u2014Propositions to depart; old traditions.\n\n26th.\u2014Leave Droo or Drophoo, due North; deep chasms, pines in (MS. illegible).\n\nHalted here. Hot-water spring at a Therba village; snow on ground.\n\n27th.\u2014N. E. N. much snow; bivouac under a crag.\n\n28th.\u2014Drizzling and hot; still among snow; great avalanches; grand panoramic view.\n\nDescend; halt at some Therba huts called N\u00e1rk, where some altercation with slave-dealers.\n\nMarch 1st.\u2014North: cross Si\u00e1k river by rope-bridge; deer numerous; halt in ravine.\n\n2nd.\u2014Lose way, but reach ruins of Killi Kasir.\n\n3rd.\u2014Description of ruins; intricate ravines; pass numerous tunnels; meet first Turkomans; get horses there.\n\n4th.\u2014Try to join a Kafila of Nyha traders at Bilkrai.\n\n5th.\u2014Therman Khan's son Ibrahim leaves them, arrangements for going on.\n\n6th.\u2014Join the caravan at Niok, a watering-station, five days N. E. of Minnoo.\n\n7th.\u2014Halted; beds of shells; hears news of his former companion, M. Shrotzky.\n\n[Here occurs a break in the journal, a volume having been lost, giving an account of his visit to Bokhara, and adventures there, including a very dangerous illness.]\nJune 26th.\u2014Leaves Qordook; barren, rugged country to Kol\u0101r; new companion\u2014a pizada of Mushid, a ventriloquist and saint, flying from Cabul on account of a murder and intrigue, also a Hindu named Jyram, a Therba servant and an Affghan.\n\n27th.\u2014Kol\u0101r to Kund\u016bz; numerous pools on almost inaccessible pinnacles of rock.\n\n28th and 29th.\u2014Detained at Kund\u016bz by Meer Ali Morad Shah.\n\n30th.\u2014Set off, and again detained.\n\nJuly 1st.\u2014Very hilly country covered with thorny bush, with grand view of snowy mountains.\n\nTen miles through fertile valley of Shool, counted 27 pools on the hills within 4 miles; wild ravines.\n\nFort of Oosrooth; 1000 houses. A road thence by Kroo to Kaffirstan, and by Hindus and M\u0101n.\n\n2nd.\u2014Very dangerous road to Shokhal, which belongs to Rustam Khan; plundered by one Khan Mohammad; with difficulty avoid going on the reprisal expedition.\n\n3rd.\u2014Most rugged country to Khormish\u0101, a very curious fort. Ascent by steep steps on hands and feet to a narrow ledge of rock,\u2014thence by a ladder of skin-rope (or baskets and windlass) to the top, where there is a remarkable fountain; the rock, primitive limestone; the basin about 20 feet wide and 6\u00bd deep in centre, gradually sloping\u2014always bubbling and brilliantly clear; cold in summer and hot in winter, when it hisses with a loud noise like Noo Shoo; always full and never overflows; all impurities immediately carried off. Fort very ancient with caverns used now as granaries.\n\nEcho most remarkable from a wall-piece; running up a long valley increasing in loudness, then dying away as it returns, again increasing and again subsiding, three times, the third the loudest.\n\nThe hill is described as 180 to 200 yards in circumference at the summit and 250\u2014300 at base, and 2100 feet high.\n\nThe tradition is, that when Noah was at Mecca the chief of this land, \"Khor\" by name, was converted to Isl\u00e1m and went to pay his respects. Noah now promised to grant him a favour on which Khor bellowed out in a rude voice \"Water;\" this demand offended Noah, and he cursed the land of Khor which became solid rock;\u2014however to keep his promise he made this everlasting spring at\nthe top of the hill, and sent his grandson Shur to carry out his orders, calling out Nooh Shooh, which was obeyed, and Echo conveyed the sound to Mecca, and every winter in commemoration thereof, the waters murmur Noah Shooh, and the Echo carries the sound to Mecca, and the place retains the name of all the parties concerned\u2014Khornush\u00e1. Blue limestone shows the limits of Khor's land, still held by his descendants, viz. Rustam Khan on the west, and Mohammad Khan on the east.\n\nMr. G. was, with his companions, let down the whole distance in baskets.\n\n4th.\u2014Marches on limestone rock, the barren inheritance of Khor, to Khan Mohammad fort of Trimooke, about 14 miles from base of snowy range; situated at the end of a tabular hill:\u2014several hot springs in the neighbourhood.\n\n5th.\u2014Meets party of Bhuri, with Kaffir girls for sale\u2014a continual kidnapping going on in the frontier. There are three main tribes of Kaffirs.\n\n1, of the Koh-i-low,\n2, \u2014\u2014 Koh-i-kaf,\n3, \u2014\u2014 Koh-i-ghar,\n\nwhich last are the Siyahpoesh Kaffirs of Kabul. The former do not shave the head, save a lock for each Musalm\u00e1n they kill. The latter shave the head\u2014letting a lock grow for every slain enemy. The most valiant may have a good head of hair or a shaved head as the case may be. One of the slaves was of excessive beauty, and was offered for 50 qai or drops of silver, about \u00bd ounce.\n\nDuring this march they quit the limestone and get into a granitic and quartzose region\u2014stop at the Ziarat of Abba Shah, at the foot of a cliff of granite 900 feet high. A large (80 yards broad) torrent loses itself in a chasm at the base, and there are several caves cut out of the rock above the chasm, where the torrent disappears with much noise.\n\n6th.\u2014Halt at the Ziarat in order to visit four other Ge\u00e9ks or chasms of similar nature. The fakeers collect herbs, to eat, from the spongy-mossy sides of the rocky dells in which these streams subside. The valley he compares to a great perpendicular cylinder; in the centre of it, a crater-like orifice about 100 yards round; a dark flinty rock.\nIt is customary to hang certain herbs down this chasm by long ropes for a month, after which, they are considered as panaceas for all diseases. The plant was very bitter, apparently a gentian. It is called Thoceth.\n\nThe caves are of various size; inside plain: in one he saw numerous images rudely carved of deities and beasts, and apparently letters. The central smooth pillar, 22 feet high, of the main cave was especially so carved.\n\nHe sounds the chasm and gets no bottom at 1140 yards!!! and does not visit the other chasm\u2014rich geological sections.\n\n7th.\u2014From Abb\u00e9 Geth diverges about 7 miles. Visits a chasm called Groor-geth. Follows a broad impetuous torrent running at the base of an immense (1000 feet) cliff; the valley is ended by a wall of rock under which the stream vanishes, a rocky island dividing it as it disappears, forming a grand water-fall, meeting 20 feet below.\n\nThence they ascend to the top in a small valley.\n\n8th.\u2014Continued North East course; rugged mountains interspersed with green valleys; next Khoolook, which lies at the foot of the mountains and border of the desert plain called Esh, which runs from Koondooz twenty-five miles to Pralli; twelve thence to Khoolook.\n\nDelivers Morad Begh's letter to Khan Bahadur; meets a Hindu who has a silver-mounted pocket-compass, and part of a map of India\u2014probably belonging to Moorcroft.\n\n9th.\u2014Halt at Khoolook to visit ruins of an old city called Kafir Derra.\n\nIt is situated in a narrow pass. The labyrinthine cave cut in marble, grey, white, brown or black, extending about a mile on each side, of excessive intricacy within; prevented from exploring by innumerable venomous snakes\u2014numerous prostrate pillars sculptured with figures; most of the caves mere burrows, 3 feet high. The city is said to have been depopulated by the snakes, which assume the colour of the ground or rocks they inhabit, blue on the blue marble, green among herbage. The pass at the end of the valley is impracticable on account of the snakes.\n\nAbout 1\u00bd mile due north of Esh, on a bare plain of rock, a colossal\nhorse in pitchstone, now lying on its side, measure 55 feet from top of the ear to hoof, 42 from chest to tail; legs 14 feet. Two other similar horses, also in ruins, lie on other two sides of Esh, so as to form a right-angled triangle round it.\n\n10th.\u2014From Khoolook, E., pass Pr\u00e2l to the right, cross the desert, kill an antelope and bivouac by a pool in a ravine.\n\n11th.\u2014Desert; pass a few pools; robbed by Bhurs of every thing; wolves and leopards and hyenas all night.\n\n12th.\u2014March through desert to Oosfung; a charitable chief gave clothes and guides.\n\n13th.\u2014Through desert to Coom; great forest to the south towards Pr\u00e2l in which the Bhurs escaped.\n\nForest called Erbabfung; wolves in packs of 1000. Fung means forest in K\u00e2fir. This forest, he says, extends to the borders of Deer and Deord and Pahlooth.\n\n14th.\u2014Leave Coom for Buduksh\u00e1n, meet Obas of Oosbres; halt at one.\n\n16th.\u2014Mud fort Agsa; black mail in shape of guides to Shoolash\u2014a little cultivation.\n\n17th.\u2014Flat and level country; passed Shoh, and put up at an Oba.\n\n18th.\u2014Over well-peopled country to Buduksh\u00e1n; stopped at a Ziarat in suburbs.\n\n24th.\u2014Leave Buduksh\u00e1n. Easterly, well-cultivated, to Shoh.\n\n26th.\u2014Reached low hills and ravines. Trap and greenstone;\u2014old ruined fort of Durum under basalt cliffs\u2014report of old caves\u2014marks of old mines, he suspects for topaz, in a stratum of quartz and lithomarge! some limestone with shells; wandering about, looking for jewels apparently.\n\n27th.\u2014The basaltic cliffs assume fanciful shapes; supposed to be K\u00e2firs petrified by Abraham. One very remarkable human face on the precipitous sides of a dark ravine of amygdaloid rock is called Babo Boolan, about 25 feet in height, with monstrous red eyes and mouth and aquiline nose:\u2014they are objects of extreme dread to the natives.\n\n28th.\u2014Reached this ravine and hills, resorts of wandering Moor, Shoolies and Usbecks.\n\n31st.\u2014Reached foot of Altan mountains, stopped at a stone fort,\ncalled Ooz, belonging to a Shooly chief; met 3 Hindus, Suniyassis who had been on a pilgrimage to a volcano in Khirghiz! They had left Hindustan, by Kashmir and Baltistan, through Gilgit, and the Oordoo pass.\n\nAbout five miles from Ooz is a chasm about 50 feet long, out of which smoke is continually emitted, sometimes white sometimes dark; edges of chasm lined with sulphur and bitumen: can't make out the rock, lava? or basalt? Traces of silver,\u2014gold washed from debris and sand of rock\u2014copper, especially in some of the Geths, where the water is nauseating\u2014galena and tin? (with doubt), also found in some parts.\n\nAugust 1st.\u2014A long march to Shoh, a small fort at bottom of a deep ravine or pass which it commanded\u2014chief's name M\u00e2n\u00fbssa. Proceeded to see the ruins of the city along a ravine 500 yards, and then through a narrow chasm to a sort of natural gateway, and entered the ancient city. An amphitheatre of rock surrounded a small round verdant vale. The cliffs of immense height almost perpendicular, and crowned with fantastic needle-shaped pinnacles, while the caves were excavated in ledges or tiers above one another. They returned through a natural arch 90 feet high, 25 broad and gradually narrowing to 3 or 4, and ending in a chasm by which they returned\u2014so narrow, that they could scarcely squeeze their way through.\n\nThe Shoolies' hospitality consisted in forcing enormous quantities of melted butter on their guests.\n\n2nd.\u2014Revisits the city of Shoh in detail; returns by the narrow fissure\u2014an arid way, the Eastern end is ornamented with rude sculptures to about 15 feet high. The cave was about 60 yards long due E. and W.; the Western entrance 40 feet high by 1\u00bd or 2 wide.\n\nIn front of the gate is a chiselled platform 6 feet high, 20 square.\n\nThis leads to a closed amphitheatre which is described as a mile in diameter, the bounding rocks 1500 feet high, and the mountains encircling them 8 or 4000, having a chasm of 3 or 4 miles.\n\nThe centre is a green mossy oval of about 800 yards broad, surrounded by excavations,\u2014circular or square caves,\u2014outside of which are peristyles, arcades and columns in eighteen different ranges;\u2014the columns very irregular, varying from fifteen to eighty feet in height. From the lofty mountains, fell innumerable cascades down into\ndeep ravines which wound away to the east, and formed a tributary to the Oxus: none fell actually into the amphitheatre itself. There were but few images carved on the pillars, all very rude in form, some obscene, but highly polished, the smaller hieroglyphics, resembling those at Abba Geth, were neatly finished.\n\nBut the most surprising part of the narration is the acoustic effects of the wind and water-falls producing musical notes, which give different effects, louder or softer, according to the situation of the stander, at the base resembling an \u00c6olian harp, in the middle tiers an organ, while in the higher places, military music.\n\n3rd.\u2014Proceeds towards Derra Derwas through rugged mountains, stops at caves occupied by two devotees, who worship the sun and certain idols. The principal of whom they styled Akoo or Hakoo (which may have some connection with Ak\u00e2 Carbghar) the other \"Shoob,\" (query Shiva?) whom they consider the titular deity of the Shooly tribe.\n\n4th.\u2014Through rugged mountains to the fort of Droo at the south entrance of the Derra; here crossed the stream found by the Shooh cascades.\n\n5th.\u2014Left Droo and enter the pass. The Oxus here pretty considerable; most of the tributaries from the westward; the pass to Tundrel westerly to the post of Cheela.\n\nA considerable post on the side of the mountain;\u2014north of the pass and on the western side of the mountain, at the foot of the fort, a village of 7-8000 inhabitants, partly Moghul partly Shooly. The chief, a very obliging Moghul. To the east of the village a narrow culturable valley lay N. and S. About a mile off the sources of the Oxus.

The Keizs tribe live in caves on the highest peaks; subsist by hunting; keep no flocks; said to be anthropophagous; but have handsome women; eat their flesh raw.\n\nThe Keizs marriage rites are simple, the lover lays his bow at the feet of the lady; if she lifts it up, kisses and returns it, she is his wedded wife. By taking the husband's bow and flinging it on the ground before him, she might divorce herself, and she might secure a husband by unslinging his bow from his shoulder. The husbands have the power of selling their wives. They peculiarly venerate Hindu wanderers, giving up wives and daughters to them; if any progeny result, it is considered as a Demigod.\n\nTwo days N.

Bayley, Esq., enclosing a short and imperfect inscription from Pinjore given to him by Mr. L. Bowring of the Civil Service, and for deciphering which, he has not the necessary references at hand. Mr. B. sends also a copy of the Khunniarah inscription, on the subject of which he observes:\n\n\"I send you also the Khunniarah inscription, or at least a native copy of it; I am sorry it is so disappointing; there are two stones, on one of which is the upper on the other the lower line. The actual letters are said to be four or five inches high, so that this is a mere copy taken by hand. I will endeavour to go myself and get an impression, if you think it worth while. Having once set about this work, I find several inscriptions exist, of which I am getting copies. There is one in the great temple at Kangra, but the copy brought me, was too carelessly made to be worth sending. I have read it however in part, and find it gives three names in the Bansavalis, Megh Chand, Dhurm Chand and Sansar Chand. Of the former I have coins. The date of the inscription, I unfortunately cannot read in the copy, but it must be about 1500 to 1510 Sambat. There are other inscriptions in the fort, one of which is clearly dated 1484 Sambat Vikrama Deba; but unluckily it is so defaced that I have not succeeded in getting any thing else out of it, yet this is also the case with a short one, bearing date 1260 Sambat, but I am still trying to see if I may not get it made more legible by care. Of coins also, I have got another, king Apurwa Chand, and two others still undeciphered; but I dare say, I shall shortly get other specimens to work out these, and give me one or two names.\"\n\n5. From Captain Cunningham, explaining the cause of the delay\nin bringing out his paper on Kangra and other coins, for which plates have been for some years in the Secretaries' hands. Captain C. hopes to be able to send it soon after reaching Mooltan, as well as an account of the Buddhist cave of Dhumnar, which he has recently visited. After enumerating fourteen Kangra kings whose coins he has deciphered, Captain C. concludes thus:\n\n\"The delay that has taken place in the publication of the plates of the ancient coinage of India, is a source of much regret to me, on account of the interesting light which they throw upon the history of India. It is generally known that all the oldest coins and inscriptions now existing in India, are of princes of the Buddhist faith, but, I believe, that few suspect the existence of ancient coins of Brahmanical princes. Such however have been lying in Calcutta amongst my engraved plates ever since 1848. The undoubted coins of Brahmanical princes are those of a Brahma Mitra, Vishnu Mitra, Indra Mitra, Agni Mitra, all of whom are Vedic deities. Their antiquity, though not so great as that of the Buddhist coins, is nevertheless earlier than the worship of Siva and his Lingum, as is proved by the significant want of any coins of Mah\u00e1deva Mitra, Siva or Iswara Mitra. The alphabetic characters, which are similar to those of the inscription on the Sanchi gateways and in the Buddhist caves of Western India, range these Brahmanical coins about the beginning of the Christian era.\n\n\"I have written thus far for publication in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society, if you will kindly insert it for me. I have many papers in view for the Society's Journal, but I can do nothing until I reach Mooltan, I am anxious to have all my plates of Hindu coins, which are now with Laidlay, engraved as soon as possible, and I will then send the letter-press for their illustration. The work will form a complete collection of the ancient coinage of India.\"\n\n6. From Dr. Bedford, R\u00e1mpur Bauleah, enclosing a paper entitled \"Contributions to the Statistics of Bengal,\u2014Income, Expenditure and Food.\"\n\n7. From W. G. Young, Esq., Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, forwarding a copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Board of Revenue with its enclosure, respecting certain specimens of gold from the Jugloo River in Assam.\nThe Secretary exhibited to the meeting the first sheet of a Sanskrita Lexicon, by Professor Bohtlingk, now printing at St. Petersburg.\n\nThe Curator of the Museum of Economic Geology and the Librarian submitted reports of additions made to their respective departments during the last month.\n\nRead and confirmed, 2nd May, 1853.\n\n(Signed) J. W. COLVILLE.\n\nReport of the Curator Museum of Economic Geology for the month of April, 1853.\n\nGeology and Mineralogy.\u2014Dr. Cantor has presented us with a specimen of Fossiliferous limestone from Girbee in the Straits of Malacca of which the following is his memorandum.\n\n1. Fossiliferous limestone and lignite from Girbee. The late Captain Congalton, H. C. Steamer Diana proceeded in July, 1845 to Girbee river; on the Malayan Peninsula in 8\u00b0 0' N. L. On his return to Pinang he communicated to me a diagram and memorandum of the locality in which the lignite occurs.\n\nT\u00e1mah is a hillock about 11 ft. high above the strata.\n\nLength of the strata from 300 to 400 ft. their diameter from 1 to 14 inches, those of the greatest diameter below the seam of lignite, and they deviate from the upper strata at an angle of 4 to 5\u00b0. In the ironstone nearest Datoo Putri appears a cave, nearly circular, about 20 ft. in diameter, but of no great depth. Round the cave radiate short strata, 4 to 5 ft. in length, of fossiliferous limestone like the strata below T\u00e1mah, Tanjong Datoo Putri is a limestone rock, not stratified, about 500 ft. above low water mark, and about a mile distant from the hillock T\u00e1mah.\n\nThe seam of lignite runs nearly horizontally from east to west. The eastern extremity is 2 inches in depth, the western 8 inches. The shells of the strata appear to belong to the genera Paludina and Melania, and closely resemble recent species inhabiting the Malayan Peninsula and Islands.\n\nEconomic Geology.\u2014The following report relates to the specimen of copper ore from the Barragunda mines in the Hazareebagh district, now on the table, which was examined at the request of Mr. Mackenzie. This gentleman informs me that the mine has anciently been worked to a very great extent under the native governments, but that they only worked one\nside of the lode, which no doubt was of a kind of ore which they found easier to smelt, or less mixed with silex than this which they have left.\n\nExamination of a Sulphuret of Copper from the Barragunda Copper Mine, sent by Mr. Mackenzie.\n\nThis ore is imbedded in a clear quartz matrix, and, unless the dressing be very carefully attended to, a heavy loss will always arise, either from the quantity of ore rejected in small fragments by the dressers on the one hand, or by the quantity of silex which will find its way into the furnace as ore on the other. At least 10 per cent. should on this account be struck off from my actual results, which were of course from a lot of picked fragments of pure ore, as free as possible from matrix. There is also a considerable mixture of iron pyrites with it, which will in practice deteriorate much from its value, for the two are constantly mixed in the dressing.\n\nI find that this ore contains in 100 parts as follows:\n\n| Component       | Percentage |\n|-----------------|------------|\n| Silex           | 0.50       |\n| Sulphur         | 31.42      |\n| Iron (Perox. 48.55) Metallic | 33.98     |\n| Copper Metallic | 34.10      |\n\n100.00\n\nThe iron and copper being both in the state of bisulphurets.\n\nIn the smelting of this ore on the large scale it must be taken into account that the 34 per cent. of copper will be reduced in practice as follows:\n\n- Silex with the ore, from veins and bad dressing... 10 per cent.\n- Sulphuret of iron mixed with it at least, .......... 10 \"\"\n- Waste in smelting at least 10 to ................. 15 \"\"\n\n35 per cent.\n\nor say one-third; so that the 34 parts of copper will be reduced to 34 less 11 or 23 per cent. of the ore as sent to the furnace: and if this is obtained, it will be by very good management,\n\nH. Piddington,\nCur. Mus. Econ. Geology.\n\nMarch 11th, 1853.\n\nI have next to announce a discovery which may be of importance, being that of a fine variety of coal in the neighbourhood of Darjeeling, in the Chawa Nuddee, about a coss from its junction with the Teesta.\nThe late Mr. David Scott, Governor General's Agent, Assam, is said by Dr. Campbell to have found coal near the same locality, but a specimen submitted to the coal Committee, and reported on in one of its printed reports, was considered of no value.\n\nMy Report on this coal is as follows:\n\nReport on a specimen of Jet Coal from the Chawa Nuddee, a tributary of the Teesta, forwarded by Dr. A. Campbell of Darjeeling.\n\nThe specimens sent are very small and are mere surface and rolled specimens, so that there is much difficulty in selecting a bit for a fair test of the Sp. gravity; and those which I have taken are too small. I found also much difficulty in picking fragments entirely free from earthy matter for analysis without destroying the larger specimens which, from a new locality and with a new variety, it is always desirable to keep as entire as possible till a good supply is obtained.\n\nExamination.\u2014This coal is evidently a Jet; but as none of the books to which I have access contain any detailed examination and description even of the common Jet! I have thought it worth while to put this on record as it differs both from massive Jet and from the common Jet Coal.*\n\nAppearance.\u2014The aspect of this coal is very remarkable. A part of it is a bright glancing jet-like coal, which sometimes occurs in entire pieces, though very small ones, not being larger than a large bean or small walnut but in the larger specimen, this bright jet-like and massive coal is seen to pass into curious small columnar jointed concretions, somewhat resembling on a microscopic scale those of basalt.\n\nIn certain lights the joints have a very bright, and somewhat pearly glance, with faint traces of rings in them, which are clearly made out by the magnifier. Larger and more distinct traces of these rings are seen on some of the massive jet-like pieces, the whole conveying the impression of large and small globules loosely aggregated under pressure.\n\nPhysical Properties.\u2014It burns readily with a fine greenish yellow flame, and the smell of the smoke, though pungent, is in some degree aromatic;\u2020 being not at all the smoky smell of common coal. It is easily cut, but brittle and flying into fragments. The streak is a dull black.\n\n* See Vol. XX. p. 366, of Journal (Proceedings of April, 1851,) for my examination of an Indian Jet Coal far inferior to this from the Mootee Jhurna falls, Rajmahal Hills.\n\n\u2020 Probably containing a little Succinic Acid.?\nWhen breathed upon, the smell is that of a foul chimney.\n\nSp. gravity of a specimen of the massive kind, ............... 1.02\nOf a specimen which was partly massive and partly concretionary........................................... 1.03\n\nThe constituents of a specimen which was composed of a fair average of the massive and concretionary parts were found to be as follows. In 100 parts,\n\nWater, .............................................................................. 10.50\nVolatile bituminous matter, .................................................. 27.00\nCarbon, ............................................................................. 58.00\nAsh, of a dark grey color and effervescing with Acids, ... 4.00\n\n100.00\n\nA portion of the ash was evidently in coarse siliceous granules, probably from the external coating of the rolled pieces; so that, the true proportion of ash would probably be about 3.50 per cent. or less.\n\nIf found in sufficient quantities this coal would afford a very valuable and agreeable fuel, but would burn too quick, I should think, to be economical; the powder in the crucible does not coke as that of the bituminous coals often does.\n\nPostscript.\u2014When about to despatch this report, I received from Dr. Campbell a farther supply of the coal, of which the examination quite confirms it. In the larger and more massive pieces, the concretionary structure is clearly visible on the cross fracture, and they have moreover embedded in them some brown amygdaloidal concretions from one to two inches long which are masses of micaceous gravel and carbonaceous matter, cemented to some hardness by a mixture of carbonate of lime. There are some pieces also of the coal veined with carbonate of lime. The quantity of coal to be obtained and the expense of raising and delivering it at the station, are now all that is wanted to be known regarding this deposit. It cokes into a bright shining metallic coke externally which is remarkably fibrous and wood-like; and in some pieces divides into laminar masses like wood, as if this Jet Coal was produced not from carbonized plants, but from wood.\n\nDr. Campbell has also sent us specimens of the rock in which the Jet Coal is found. This is a coarse sandstone grit; much of the character of those of the true coal formations, and is so far promising; but it contains no organic remains.\n\nH. PIDDINGTON,\nCurator, Mus. Econ. Geology.\nMajor Ramsay now resident of Nepal sent me some time ago, as already noticed in a former report, a collection of 96 specimens of rocks and minerals of various kinds, which the minister Jung Bahadur had had collected, and of which he was desirous of knowing the value, as one was supposed to contain tin, &c. but the whole prove to be valueless, except one of a very fine quartz, equal to the best Brazilian pebbles, a splendid white marble, a Kyanite, (sometimes used in jewellery and inlaying work,) a blue copper ore, and the last of the series No. 96, which as I announced before, is certainly a new mineral, even in the form in which it reached us, Major Ramsay has just sent specimens of the ore, which will be examined in due course. The history of this mineral product I reserve for the full account of its examination.\n\nCaptain Haughton, 1st Assistant Agent to the Governor-General on the S.W. Frontier, has sent us a large collection of some 50 or 60 ores of copper, iron and lead, from that quarter, which will be duly examined.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following books have been added to the Library since the last meeting.\n\nPresented.\n\nIndische Alterth\u00fcmskunde von Christian Lassen.

Assistant Surgeon, 4th Regt. Punjab Cavalry. In charge of the Geological Survey of the Salt Range in the Punjab. Season 1851-52.\n\n(Communicated by the Govt. of India.)\n\n(Continued from Page 279.)\n\nTertiary Eocene Rocks, Brown Calcareous Sandstone, Nummulite, Limestone, Marls and Alum Shales with Lignite.\n\nA band of claystone, in some places highly ferruginous and in others nearly as white as pipe clay, seems to mark the base of this formation. It has exactly the appearance of the ferruginous claystones described as occurring in the Oolite shales, and as it may be seen occasionally passing into black bituminous shales which are in rapid process of decomposition, its origin is doubtless identical.\n\nResting on this is an incoherent greenish brown calcareous sandstone, which east of Kuttha is devoid of organic remains. At this place, however, it becomes more calcareous, contains a few nummulites and a considerable number of gasteropodous molluscae. On proceeding westward to Moosakhail, the bed becomes a coarse arenaceous limestone, and abounds in fossils similar to those which occur throughout all the rocks of the nummulite limestone series, none of those characteristic of the formations inferior to it having been detected.\n\nTo this sandstone there succeeds a deposit of very varying thickness of dark bituminous alum shales containing irregular beds and\nfilms of a coal having all the characters of a lignite. The shales contain much pyrites, and large and small crystals of Selenite are abundant throughout them. In many places they are undergoing rapid decomposition from the oxidation of the pyrites. In the neighbourhood of Kalibagh the chemical action is so violent, and often produces such intense heat, as to cause the combustion of the shales and their conversion into red claystone. In some of the old shale pits (from which the alum shales are dug) the combustion is most violent, and volumes of smoke issue with considerable force from their mouths charged with the vapours of sulphurous acid which taints the air all around. On tracing the shales upwards they become arenaceous and marly, and pass by a coarse yellow marly limestone full of nummulites and other shells into a compact grey limestone, the lower beds of which appear as if made up of rounded masses of the same limestone arranged in horizontal layers and cemented in a calcareous paste. This appearance has probably been produced by the breaking up of the deposit shortly after its formation, and the subsequent recementing of the fragments by the infiltration of calcareous mud.\n\nBoth the limestone and the cementing paste abound in nummulites, fragments of Echinidae, &c. Above, the limestone becomes of a grey argillaceous character and when bruised emits a fetid smell. It gradually passes into blue marls which are succeeded by an upper deposit of bituminous alum shales. Argillaceous limestone beds then follow of a light grey colour, having a striking resemblance to chalk, and are succeeded by a thick deposit of a very compact light grey limestone in which irregular shaped masses and rounded nodules of flint closely resembling those found in chalk are abundant. They are particularly so, in the district between Nummul and the north side of mount Likesur, and were there collected in large quantity by the Sikhs for the preparation of musket flints. They seem to be arranged generally in layers, and are of a dark grey or black colour, their surface being covered with a white chalky crust, and sometimes with an incrustation of peroxide of iron, which, both in nodules and in small veins, is of frequent occurrence in the limestone. These are apparently decomposed pyrites.\n\nThe limestone in many places seems formed entirely of the shells\nof Foraminiferae, especially of nummulites which are most apparent in the weathered surface of the rock, a freshly fractured surface often presenting no trace of them.\n\nIt is very hard but brittle, and presents a splintery conchoidal fracture. The rock is invariably traversed by deep fissures and cracks indicative of its having suffered severely from the commotions to which the Salt Range has been subjected.\n\nIt is a very fine limestone dissolving rapidly in muriatic acid, and with the separation of a small quantity of flocculent silica.\n\nThe nummulite limestone formation west of Pind Dadun Khan forms generally the top of the escarpment of the range, appearing between that place and Kuttha and in the Chichalee Range, in precipitous cliffs several hundred feet high, which weather of a white colour and in the distance have a strong resemblance to chalk.\n\nOwing to the rapid disintegration of the shales in the cliffs, the limestone becomes undermined, and huge masses of the rock thus become detached, and strew with their debris the steep sides of the hills. To the north of the escarpment of the range in its central part, the nummulite limestone in a great degree conceals the inferior rocks, and is generally distributed over the ridges, table-lands and valleys which intervene between its north and south sides. Its strata are, however, very much broken up, and in all the deep ravines its relation to the inferior rocks may be observed.\n\nThe thickness of the formation varies much, but when well developed, it cannot be less than a thousand feet; in many places it is much more.\n\nIn this formation the limestone as a source of lime is very valuable, being more generally burned, than any other limestone, in the Salt Range. It is never quarried by the natives who have only to collect the boulders of it which are strewed in great abundance all along the foot of the hills.\n\nFrom its brittle splintery character, and the difficulty of obtaining blocks of it of any size, it is not adapted for a building stone.\n\nThe minerals we shall notice as occurring in this formation are the alum shales as a source of alum, and thin enclosed beds of lignite, petroleum and mineral sulphur.\n\nAlum shales are extensively mined at Kalibagh, and at Kathee in\nthe Chichalee pass. At Kalibagh the principal workings are at a place called Chatab on the north-east side of the Kalibagh hill, above the Soan Nullah and about a mile from the Indus opposite Marie. Here the lower alum shales are fully two hundred feet thick, and are surmounted by a high scarped precipice of nummulite limestone. Regular shafts are sunk in the shale or \"Ral\" as it is called by the natives, to depths varying from two or three hundred feet. After being carried out of the pits by men and boys, it is packed in coarse blanket bags and conveyed on bullocks or donkeys to the alum works at Kalibagh, where the miners are paid at the rate of one rupee for from thirteen to seventeen maunds, according to the quality of the shale delivered. From the incoherent character of the beds, and the rude way of mining them, accidents to the miners are of very frequent occurrence, who, from the sulphureous air they are obliged to breathe in the pits, and the laborious nature of their employment, have a most sickly and emaciated appearance.\n\nIn the town of Kalibagh there are generally from twelve to fourteen kilns for burning the shale, to each of which the necessary arrangements for the preparation of alum are attached. In 1852 only twelve kurrahs or evaporating pans were in use, one being attached to each kiln.\n\nIn preparing the kiln a layer of brushwood (generally tamarisk jungle which abounds on the banks of the Punjaub rivers) is spread on the ground to an extent varying according to the size of the one to be constructed. On this a layer of the Ral or Shale in fragments is deposited to the depth of about a foot, to which succeeds a second layer of brushwood, and then another of shale, a quantity of wood being added according as the shale is more or less bituminous. When several of these layers have been arranged, the kiln is set on fire from below, care being taken that the combustion is not too rapid, which from time to time is moderated by sprinkling water on the shales. The kiln being well lighted fresh layers of shale and brushwood are added, and when the whole has attained the height of thirty or forty feet it is left to burn, six or eight months being sufficient to effect the thorough decomposition of the mass, which when completed has changed from a black to a brick red colour in consequence of the oxidation of the pyrites. Its surface is covered\nwith an efflorescence of alum containing a large proportion of sulphate of iron or green vitriol derived from the mutual reaction of the clay and iron pyrites in the shales, which from containing thin films of coal are admirably adapted for alum manufacture. Close to the kiln, and on a level a little below its base, there is a baked clay vat 12 feet square by 1\u00bd feet deep. Into this a portion of the burnt shale is thrown and treated for several hours with water which rapidly acquires a dark brown colour. When a saturated solution of the soluble matter in the shale is obtained, it is drawn off from the vat by an aperture in its side (which during the lixiviation of the shale is stopped by a plug) into another vat of similar size, but on a lower level. Here the crude alum liquor is allowed to deposit any mud which it may contain, and is then run off into a third but smaller vat on a still lower level, when it is again allowed to deposit any remaining impurity. From this it is transferred into an iron evaporating pan or \"kurrah\" where it is rapidly boiled and mixed with a brownish impure salt called \"Jumsan\" from which it derives the alkali necessary to convert the crude alum into an alum of commerce. When a proper quantity of this has been added, which is judged of from the appearance of the liquid, the whole is allowed to settle and the clear brown alum solution removed into vats about nine feet long 5\u00bd broad and about 1\u00bd feet deep, a series of which are arranged beneath a shed close to the evaporating pan. In these the solution, which is concentrated to a point a little short of that of crystallization, is allowed slowly to crystallize for several days. During that time small alum crystals are formed of a slightly pink colour devoid from the impure mother liquor which contains a quantity of chloride and sulphate of iron. When a considerable crop of alum has separated, the crystals are removed from the vat, slightly washed with cold water on a sirkee frame, and allowed to dry. These are afterwards fused in an iron pan, in their own water of crystallization and when in a fluid state are removed into large conical earthen jars, one foot eight inches deep, the same breadth at the shoulder, and six inches wide at the mouth, where for eight or ten days the alum is allowed to crystallize. At the end of this period a hole is made in the mass of alum, which is generally hollow in its interior, the gurrah inverted, and the uncrystallized alum liquor\nallowed to escape. The gurrah is then broken and the alum, moulded to its form, is ready for sale and exportation.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the expense at Kalibagh per diem of keeping one kurrah or evaporating pan, &c. at work. Payments are made in a 13 anna Rupee for the Company's maund.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost |\n|-------------------------------------------|------|\n| 40 maunds of shale                        | Rs. 8 0 0 |\n| Wood to burn this and evaporate the alum liquor | 4 8 0 |\n| 5 maunds of Jumsan                        | 8 0 0 |\n| 7 Coolies                                 | 1 4 0 |\n| Sundries                                  | 0 8 0 |\n| Water-fee paid to Mulik Ulla Yar Khan     | 0 1 6 |\n| Fee to Mulik of Kalibagh                  | 0 4 0 |\n\nTotal Expence, Co.'s Rs. 10 4 6\n\nThe above expenditure yields a return of three maunds and ten seers of alum, the value of which at Rs. 3-4 per maund is Co.'s Rs. 10-9. Assuming the above to be correct (and we give it exactly as stated to us) the owner of each kurrah will only have a clear gain of As. 0-4-6 per diem. At Kalibagh however as the Mulik of the place Ulla Yar Khan is sole proprietor of five out of the twelve kurras at work, and as he generally pays his workmen and miners in flour, clothes, &c. instead of in cash, his profits are doubtless considerable. He moreover levies a tax of Rs. 2 on every camel load of alum removed from Kalibagh.\n\nAlum is manufactured at Kalibagh for ten months in the year and about 12000 maunds (8571 cents) is annually prepared, which at Co.'s Rs. 3-4 per maund will yield a return on the spot of Rs. 39,000.\n\nAt the Kathee alum works in the Chichalee pass, the expenses are considerably less, and the alum prepared, though of equally good quality, is sold at the rate of Rs. 2-8 per maund.\n\nThey are owned by a Joint Stock Company of eight members who are chiefly residents of Esakhail on the Indus, annexed is the expenditure for one kurrah per diem, of which there are eight.\n60 mounds of shale, ...\nWood to burn this and ...\n3 mounds of Jumsan, ...\n9 Coolies' wages, .......\nFee for right to water of Esakhail, .......\nSundry Expenses, ....\n\nDifference between 11 Rs. in Rs. 10-10, ....\n\nFrom the above 4 Co.'s of which at Rs. 2-8 per Co. clear profit to each kurrah 1 mounds are annually prepared.\n\nThe Kathee alum-works pared to those of Kalibagh, on in the same way by Mu or nine generations.

In the alum of Kalibagh, however, soda forms the alkaline base, a fact which the addition of \"Jumsan\" to the crude alum liquor first led us to suspect, and which an analysis of the alum subsequently confirmed. A soda alum has hitherto, we believe, been known only as an interesting chemical preparation, but previous to 1848, we are not aware that it had been noticed as a staple article of commerce in the N.W. Provinces of British India.\n\nConsidering the coarse apparatus in which it is prepared, its purity is astonishing. It effloresces considerably on exposure to the air, and has a slight pink colour arising from the presence of a little iron which strikes a blue colour with yellow prussiate of potassa, and only contains a trace of muritate of soda. Although alum is only manufactured Trans-Indus, alum-works might, we believe, be established with advantage in the Bukh ravine between Mosakhail and Nummul, as there the alum shales are of considerable thickness, and wood and water could be obtained in abundance. In other parts of the Salt Range the alum shales are too inaccessible and their thickness too small to be profitably worked as a source of alum.\n\n**Lignite or Salt Range Coal.**\n\nThroughout the Salt Range from Jelalpoor to the Indus and in the Chichalee Range, irregular seams of lignite, having, in many places, the aspect of good bituminous coal, may be observed imbedded in the lower alum shales. Lignite also occurs in the upper shales but in too thin films to be of any use as a fuel.\n\nWe shall notice the different localities where we have observed the lignite deposit proceeding from east to west.\n\n**Baghanwalla.** This coal locality was first brought to the notice of Sir Henry Lawrence by Lt. Robinson, Bengal Engineers, who forwarded samples of it to Lahore in the Autumn of 1847. From these we made an analysis, the results of which, along with a few remarks on the general characters of the coal, were laid before the Asiatic Society of Bengal in February 1848.\nBaghanwalla is a small village on the south side of the Salt Range, about ten miles west of Jelalpoor, and about eight miles from the right bank of the Jhelum. The coal seam occurs in a ravine about three miles north-east of the village among the hills and at an elevation of about one thousand feet above the plain. The access to it is by a narrow path, rather difficult and steep, but over which bullocks can travel, if moderately loaded. The nummulite limestone at this point rests on the upper red sandstone formation, and a burnt clay sandstone passing into a baked white quartzose sandstone of a few inches in thickness, marks the base of the deposit. Beds of greenish yellow marl, about a foot thick, follow, which gradually pass into sandy bituminous shales eighteen feet thick inclosing the lignite seam, on which rests a grey nummulite limestone seventy-five feet thick, the lower strata of which are marly, of a yellow colour and full of shells of a species of Ostrea and nummulites. On this limestone a thick series of miocene grey sandstone grits and red clays reposes conformably, all the strata dipping to the N. N. W. at an angle of from 40 to 45\u00b0 (See section No. 5.)\n\nThe coal seam though it may be traced on either side of the ravine where the above section was taken, for about a mile, does not present an uniform thickness as exposed on its out crop. On digging into the seam to the depth of several feet, we obtained about three feet of good coal, and about two feet of coal alternating with films of sandy shale which latter in many places seems developed at the expense of the coal which is extremely brittle, so much so that fully one-eighth falls to powder in extracting it. It loses this character, however, to some extent on digging into the seam, but we fear at whatever depth it might be mined, it never would have the solidity of genuine coal.\n\nIn a few hours two or three coolies turned out eight or ten maunds of fair coal, which bore carriage on bullocks over the hills to Baghanwalla pretty well; a camel load of it was subsequently forwarded to Lahore.\n\nThat several thousand maunds of a good fuel could be obtained from this locality at a moderate cost, I entertain no doubt, but the question as to its yielding a supply for any length of time can only be decided by sinking an experimental shaft or gallery into the\nseam from its outcrop and working along its strike. This we had neither time for, nor the means of effecting. In sinking such a shaft, considerable annoyance would be experienced from the amount of debris and the incoherent nature of the overlying strata in the cliffs above the coal. The high inclination too of the beds, and the consequent liability to have any shaft sunk in them filled with water after heavy rain, are very serious obstacles to working the coal successfully, even supposing the seam preserves a continuous thickness for any distance, which we are very much disposed to doubt.\n\nShould government determine on making attempts to mine the Salt Range Coal, we strongly recommend that this locality be fixed on for the purpose, as it is the only one where any hope of success can be offered.\n\nDrengun. On the north side of this mountain and to the west of the path leading from Besharut to Chooa Gunj Ali Shub, lignite of a similar character and in a similar position occurs, but from exposure to atmospheric influence, it is soft and crumbles into a brown dust in the hand. In a ravine of most difficult access about two hundred yards west of the path, highly bituminous shales about one hundred feet thick are exposed, dipping under nummulite limestone to the north north-west at an angle of $70^\\circ$; in these two or three seams of tolerably good coal were found, the thickest of which was only eight inches. On tracing these, however, for any distance they seemed all to thin out into mere films in the shale.\n\nAs the Drengun coal is evidently an extension northwards of the Baghanwalla seam, a shaft sunk through the nummulite limestone on the table land of Besharut would doubtless reach it, but the expense of sinking a shaft through the hard limestone would be very considerable, and would in all probability not be repaid by obtaining a supply of coal, of any consequence.\n\nKeurah. About a mile north-east of the salt-mine village of Keurah near Pind Dadun Khan, and near a tank known under the name of Ruthlum, a mass of nummulite limestone forms a rounded hill in a ravine, at the foot of which bituminous shales occur, from which in 1848 we obtained specimens of coal, from a seam about two feet thick, resting on blue clay. In 1849, five hundred maunds of coal were mined from this locality, and sent to Jhelum for the use\nof the \"Conqueror\" steamer, in the month of July. This seems quite to have exhausted the supply, as when we lately visited the locality we could only find nests of lignite in the shales, which was so soft and powdery, that it was impossible to procure even a specimen. The nummulite limestone formation at this point, and indeed all the rocks, are much disturbed, and the mass of nummulite limestone with the shales is evidently a portion, which has been detached from its connection with the regular bed, and got thrust under some broken up beds of Devonian sandstone, which may be seen in the hills above overlying the nummulite limestone.\n\nPid. This locality is to the west of the direct path from Kurrah to Choos Seydun Shah. The shale beds lie under a cliff of shattered nummulite limestone due south from the village of Pid, and between that village and Taber. The access to the locality is difficult, and the coal occurs in two seams, the lower one of which is in some places two feet thick, and separated from the upper which varies from one to three feet by shales of about a foot in thickness. From extensive spontaneous decomposition which the shales have undergone, the coal is for the most part charred and brittle, and is encrusted with yellow alumimous earth. In some places the shales have been burnt into a white claystone which is blotched occasionally by peroxide of iron. The brown calcareous sandstone too on which the shales rest here and there presents a baked and whitened appearance, resulting from the heat to which it has been subjected during the combustion of the shales.\n\nThe coal is of inferior quality to that of Baghanwalla though evidently part of the same deposit. As the cliff on which it occurs is covered by so much debris, we were unable to dig any depth into the seam, so as to obtain specimens which had not been subjected to the influence of decomposition. Where the seam crops out, it is at least two thousand feet above the plain, and is in too inaccessible a locality ever to be worked to advantage. By mistake in our Report of 1848 we called this coal locality Ruttipind.\n\nDemdhote. In a ravine about five hundred yards west of this village and under the high escarpment of the Salt Range, a mass of nummulite limestone which has evidently been detached from the escarpment, forms a small rounded hill, at the foot of which some\nlignite in a seam about two feet thick crops out. As this is only a detached portion of the regular deposit, it is of no importance, except as proving the extension of the coal seams along the range.\n\n**Mukrach.** We have seen coal under detached masses of nummulite limestone in the hills above the salt-mine village, but the regular shale bed is covered in the escarpment where we examined it, by a great quantity of debris.\n\n**Noorpoor.** Under the high cliffs of nummulite limestone below Noorpoor, the shale beds are distinctly seen, much decomposed however, and containing two small seams of coal from eight inches to a foot in thickness. A great amount of debris covers the shales and renders it unsafe to make exploratory diggings.\n\n**Kuttha.** At the top of the Kurrumea Wou above Kuttha and beneath a high precipice of limestone, dark arenaceous shales full of pyrites occur, and enclose two or three seams of coal of good quality, the thickest of which was not more than half a foot. It has a much more mineralized and compact appearance, than the lignite from most other localities. When we first observed the coal in this locality, in March 1851, the seam could be traced for about thirty yards, dipping to the north north-west at an angle of 25\u00b0 under the nummulite limestone. In January 1852, when we again visited the spot, the out-crop of the coal was completely concealed by enormous masses of the limestone, which had a few days previously become detached from the cliffs above, during an earthquake. We merely mention this as illustrative of the difficulties that would attend any attempts to mine the coal, as it occurs generally in the Range.\n\n**Kathee in the Chichalee Pass.** Between Kuttha and the Indus we have seen no coal deserving of notice, though films of it may be observed in the alum shales of the Bukkh ravine and in other localities. In the highly bituminous alum shales which supply the Kathee alum works, layers of very compact bituminous coal occur, but they seem to be continuous for but a short distance, either thinning out in the shales or becoming interlaminated with these. From the interior of one of the shale pits we obtained several specimens of coal which appeared to form a sort of nest inclosed in the shales, and was being quarried along with them for transmission to the\nalum kilns. The miners declared to us that the coal never occurred in seams, but merely in patches of irregular extent and thickness. The shale at Kathee is remarkably fresh, and, except on the surface, is not at all decomposed. It contains more carbonaceous matter than any other shale of the sort we have seen in the nummulite limestone formation, and hence, as but little wood is required to burn it when once it is lighted, it is most economically used in the preparation of alum. The pits are sunk to no great depth in the shales which dip under the limestone at an angle of from 30 to 35\u00b0. By sinking a shaft to some depth in the shale it could be easily determined whether the coal occurs here as a seam or not. The locality is a convenient one and access to the present shale pits, easy.\n\nHaving thus indicated the existence of coal in seams of irregular thickness throughout the nummulite limestone formation for a distance of one hundred and thirty miles, it is evident that a very considerable amount of fuel exists; but the very irregular thickness of the deposit, the high angle at which the strata dip, their inaccessible position and the immense amount of debris in the cliffs above the coal will we believe prove serious obstacles to mining it successfully as a steamer fuel. A few experiments conducted in the more favourable localities can alone decide the point.\n\nWherever the coal has been observed, its characters are identical. It is evidently a lignite or brown coal as it gives a brown streak, and frequently contains half-decomposed patches of brown carbonaceous matter resembling peat. Specimens of the coal obtained from some depth, and which have not suffered from atmospheric influence, are highly bituminous, of a glistening black colour like jet or cannel coal and sometimes present a pavonine lustre. It is very brittle, a character peculiar to all lignites or recent coals, small crystals of gypsum may generally be observed in the coal; which, in most localities, contains but little of the iron pyrites so abundant in the alum shales. The origin of the coal is probably marine and from the abundance of large gasteropodous molluscae in the strata both above and below the shales, it is probable that by their decomposition as well as that of fuci and other marine vegetables the coal has been formed. No indications of fossil wood or remains of land-plants have been detected in the shales, from which, however, we have procured one or two shells\nof the genus Cerithium or some allied genus. The surface of the shales is sometimes encrusted with an efflorescence of sulphate of magnesia.\n\nThe coal is somewhat difficult to ignite, and at first emits a large quantity of smoke which has a strong empyreumatic odour. When combustion, however, is once established, it burns without coking, gives out a considerable amount of flame and heat, and leaves a brown ash, the quantity of which varies considerably in different specimens.\n\nWe annex the results of the analysis of two specimens of Baghanwalla coal, and of the coal from the Kathee alum-shale pits.\n\nBaghanwalla No. 1.\n\n| Component                        | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Coke (carbon)                    | 41.86      |\n| Volatile, bituminous inflammable matter | 40.64     |\n| Ashes                            | 18.00      |\n| **Total**                        | **100.00** |\n\nBaghanwalla, No. 2.\n\n| Component                        | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Coke (carbon)                    | 59.705     |\n| Volatile, bituminous inflammable matter | 38.455    |\n| Ashes                            | 1.840      |\n| **Total**                        | **100.000** |\n\nN.

No. 2 was from its centre, and was a remarkably fine fresh specimen.\n\nCoal\u2014Kathee alum-shale pits.\n\n| Component                        | Percentage |\n|----------------------------------|------------|\n| Carbon (coke)                    | 33.579     |\n| Volatile, bituminous inflammable matter | 36.421    |\n| Ashes                            | 30.000     |\n| **Total**                        | **100,000** |\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that though inferior to good English coal, that of Baghanwalla possesses the necessary requisites for a good steamer fuel. The small amount of ash in No. 2 is very remarkable.\nFrom its large amount of ash the Kathee coal is of inferior quality and in burning would yield a quantity of clinker. If it could be got in quantities it would, however, be valuable, as it burns freely notwithstanding the large quantity of earthy matter it contains. Seams of coal apparently of a very similar character to those in the Salt Range are described by Sir Roderick Murchison as associated with nummulite limestone formation in the Alps and Appenines, in a paper published in the quarterly Journal of the Geological Society for 1848. He states that, \"in the Brattenberg near Thun, a band of coal is associated with the nummulitic deposit which is now extensively used in the manufacture of gas at Berne. Near Val D'Agno to the south of Pecoaro, seams of coal are worked for use in that neighbourhood which lie in shales which dip away from the older rock, and pass under the adjacent hills of nummulitic limestone. In fact these coal beds occupy the same place as those of Entrevennes in Savoy, of the Diableritz, and of the Brattenberg in the Canton of Berne.\" We much regret that no particulars are stated in the invaluable paper from which we have quoted, as to the thickness, mode of working, &c. of the coal seams.\n\nPetroleum exudes from the nummulite limestone rock in the Kuttawan near the village of Jubba, on the north side of the Salt Range, ten miles east of the Indus. It occurs but in small quantity, and is collected by a method similar to that employed at the petroleum springs of Kaffir Kote. It is associated with springs of sulphureous water, the sulphur of which as well as the petroleum are probably derived from the destructive distillation of the bituminous shales beneath the nummulitic limestone. It here receives the name of Gunduk ka tal (sulphur oil). It is of a dark brown colour, very fluid, and yields on distillation a good deal of Naphtha.\n\nBesides the numerous springs charged with sulphuretted hydrogen, and which deposit sulphur on the rocks over which they flow, and on the grass and weeds by their sides, sulphur, in a mineral form, occurs near the surface of the nummulite limestone at Jubba, a little above the petroleum springs, in a white porous gypsum, which has evidently been formed by the decomposition of the limestone, unaltered portions of it still remaining imbedded in the gypsum.\nThe metamorphosis has doubtless been effected by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen and sulphureous acid. These gases, generated in the decomposing alum shales by passing through the fissured limestone and porous gypsum which covers its surface, become mutually decomposed, sulphur being deposited. Dumas in 1846 proved that when sulphuretted hydrogen at a temperature above 100\u00b0 Faht. and still better when near 190\u00b0, comes into contact with certain porous bodies, a catalytic action is set up, by which water, sulphuric acid and sulphur are produced. In this way sulphur is universally formed in nature, and even in volcanic countries, \"no well authenticated case of its sublimation in an uncombined state,\"* is known.\n\nThe thickness of the sulphur formation is very trifling, but may be observed over a space of about two miles along the strike of the limestone.\n\nThe sulphur is in small quantity and of a bright yellow colour. It was formerly worked by Maha Raja Goolab Singh of Cashmere, who found it unprofitable and removed his establishment to N\u00e1kbund (a most appropriate name for a sulphur manufactory), near Kooshalgurh on the right bank of the Indus between Attock and Kalibagh, where it is said, sulphur exists in considerable quantity. The unsettled state of the hill tribes in the Kohat district prevented our visiting the N\u00e1kbund sulphur deposit. We are however informed by Misser Gyan Chund, the present Tehsildar of Pind D\u00e1dun Khan and former tax-man of the Salt Range salt mines, that during the Seikh rule, he, for three successive years, from the above locality extracted 1000 Lahoree maunds of sulphur, for the manufacture of gunpowder for the Seikh army. This he was able to supply at the rate of Rs. 6 per maund. He described pits of thirty or forty feet in depth as being dug into the sulphur formation which he reckoned of considerable extent. The mines are about five miles from the Indus near a village called Ric\u00ed and about three miles below Kooshalgurh.\n\nThe mode adopted by the natives for extracting the sulphur from its matrix is very simple. A hole is dug in the ground on which a large gurrah or earthen vessel with a wide mouth is placed. This is then filled with the coarsely powdered rock. A second gurrah in\n\n* Daubeny on Volcanoes, 2nd edition, p. 615.\nthe bottom of which a large hole has been made, is then put on\nthe top of the lower one, and secured to it by a coating of clay, to\nwhich succeeds a third and a fourth, all communicating with each\nother. A sharp wood fire is then lighted under the lower gurrah,\nby which the sulphur is gradually sublimed in the form of flowers of\nsulphur into the upper ones, to the sides of which it adheres. The\nsubliming process generally goes on for eight or ten hours, by which\ntime all the sulphur has been expelled from its matrix.\n\nNone of the organic remains which occur in the nummulite lime-\nstone formation have been detected in the rocks inferior to it. The\nmolluscae which characterize it have a totally different character, and\nneither belemnites, ammonites, nor terebratulae which occur in the\noolitic rocks beneath are to be seen, their place being taken by\nswarms of Foraminifera of the genera Nummulina and Fascialites?\nand by large Gasteropoda of the genera Conus, Trochus, Oliva, Mitra,\nVoluta, Terebellum, Natica, Acritina, &c.\n\nSeveral large bivalves also occur, and a small Ostrea (?) forms in\nsome places patches of yellow marly limestone.\n\nThe abundance of nummulites is very remarkable; and at least two\nor three species occur. They have of late years been considered as\ncharacteristic of formations superior to the chalk, and as regards\nthe Alps where the nummulite limestone is so extensively developed,\nSir Roderick Murchison, in his paper above quoted, says, \"I am\npersuaded that no form of the genus Nummulina occurs below the\nsurface of the chalk, or its equivalent,\" and again, \"that the lowest\nbeds with nummulites are completely above all those rocks which\nare the equivalent of the white chalk of northern Europe.\"\n\nCephalopods seem very scarce. We have only obtained speci-\nmens of two large species of nautilus.\n\nRadiata are in some places rather plentiful, and specimens of spe-\ncies of the genera Spatangus, Galerites and Clypeaster have been\nprocured; some of the former are of large size.\n\nThe only indication of vertebrata we have obtained, are a few\nteeth, evidently those of sharks, and one or two small fragments of\nbone too indistinct, however, we fear, to be identified.\n\nThe fossils, except in the calcareous sandstone, are generally ill-pre-\nserved. In the limestone they are generally mere casts of shells, and those obtained were generally much weathered.\n\nIn superficial extent, the nummulite limestone formation covers a larger space in the Salt Range, than any of the rocks hitherto described. In the eastern part of the Range it is first observed on the northern flank of mount Tillah, a little above the village of Bhet, as a band of yellow marly shell limestone, not more than twenty feet in thickness, resting on upper Devonian red shales, and covered by thick beds of Miocene (?) strata. Preserving the same relations, it may again be seen at Jalalpoor on the North side of the Range, and from thence may be traced uninterruptedly to Baghanwalla, where it has a thickness of from seventy-five to eighty feet.\n\nWest of this it seems rapidly to increase in thickness and from the top of the Range when it crops out in the escarpment, it stretches north in nearly horizontal strata forming the table-land of Besharut. Here it skirts the flank of mountains Kuringuli and Drengun, the ridges of which, formed of Devonian rocks, have been forced up through the nummulite limestone, and throw it off with an anticlinal dip from either side. On the west end of mount Drengun, it entirely conceals the Devonian rocks, and from thence dips north under the narrow valley which separates mount Drengun from Deljubba. In this valley it is covered up by Miocene strata, but on the north side of the Deljubba ridge, again crops out dipping to the south-east under the Miocene strata at a high angle. At the west end of the escarpment on the north side of Deljubba it appears resting on the Devonian rocks, but on proceeding eastward it seems to thin out and to be covered over by the Miocene strata. The limestone can however be traced projecting here and there through the latter on to the Gharigulla Pass where it appears in a nearly vertical wall, some thirty feet thick, crossing the pass from south-west to north-east, and gradually disappearing under the Miocene strata, which are thrown off from it, from either side of an anticlinal axis.\n\nWe are not aware that the limestone is anywhere seen, between the Gharigulla Pass and Bulerala.\n\nFrom the neighbourhood of mountains Kuringali and Drengun, the nummulite limestone stretches westward, and forms the superficial\nrock in great part of the central district of the Salt Range west as Noorpoor, it is in relation with Devonian rocks; but this and Koofree, the carboniferous rocks intervene. In the bourhood the Oolitic rocks appear at the base of the Eocene, and as we proceed westward, separate it more and more from its eastern associates.\n\nAt the west end of the Sam Sikesur valley all the strataing the high ridge of mount Sikesur are tilted up at a high. Along the foot of its scarped or S. S. E. side all the rocks much disturbed; but in the escarpment itself great regular vails, the nummulite limestone forming its summit and N side till near its base, where it is covered up by conformal cene sandstones, &c.\n\nFrom mount Sikesur on to within two miles of the L nummulite limestone occurs uninterruptedly; but though o real thickness than to the eastward, makes comparative show, owing to the high angle (45 to 50\u00b0) at which it dig north-east under the Miocene rocks.\n\nIn the disturbance which the strata in the neighbour Maree have undergone, the nummulite limestone seems to be entirely removed, but on crossing the Indus to the Kalil beds of it again appear.\n\nThese stretch round into the Chichalee Range, and, as seen Chichalee Pass, have a thickness of upwards of one thousand three hundred feet. In this Range, as in the Salt Range, t numlite limestone appears in bold white cliffs forming the of its scarped or south-east side, and the formation may l down to within six miles of the Koorum river, where it t under Miocene sandstone.\n\nIt does not appear in the upper part of the Kaffir Kot though from the researches of Captain Vicary, it is known to a considerable extent in the southern part of the Sooli Hala ranges. Capt. Grant too, in Cutch, has described a beds of nummulite formation extending over a space of abo miles, many of the fossils obtained from which are identi those we have found in the Salt Range.\n\nDuring the hot weather of 1851 we detected nummulite!\nof a very different appearance from that of the Salt Range, as forming the surface rock at least of several of the Hazara hills north of Rawul Pindee and on the mount Mochpoor. About fifteen miles north of the new Murree Sanatorium, which attains an elevation of upwards of nine thousand and seven hundred feet, we obtained abundance of nummulite limestone on its sides and summit.\n\nFrom Cashmere too, Mr. Vigne obtained limestone containing nummulites. This we have seen in situ on the side of a mountain at the upper end of the Manasabul lake, where it is much disturbed and calcined by greenstone. It probably forms the summit of many of the higher hills on the northern side of the Cashmere valley, a district fraught with interest to the Geologist, and hitherto quite unexplored.\n\nWhen we consider that the nummulite formation may be traced from the Mediterranean through Egypt, Asia Minor and Persia into the north-west and southern provinces of British India, and throughout all this extent preserves the same zoological character, though differing considerably in mineral aspect, the importance attaching \"to a right understanding of its true position in the Geological series,\" cannot be overrated.*\n\n* Since writing the above, we have had the pleasure of perusing the anniversary address, for 1852, of the President* of the Royal Geographical Society, in which it is stated, on the authority of Professor Oldham, that \"the coal and iron of the district of Cheera Panjee, or the range of hills which separates Assam and the Beramputer from the plains of Sylhet, belong to the nummulite tertiary formation.\" We may also state that from specimens of the coal and rocks connected with it, which were forwarded for our inspection from the Singrowlee coal mines near Mirzapore, in December, 1849, by Claude Hamilton, Esq. one of the proprietors, we gave our opinion that it was a coal of a similar character and of a similar age, with that of the nummulitic formation of the Salt Range. This coal is now pretty extensively consumed by the Ganges Steamers, and is sold at Mirzapore at the rate of 75 Rs. per hundred maunds. A sample of this coal, which we analyzed in September 1850, gave the following results.\n\n| Component                  | Percentage |\n|----------------------------|------------|\n| Carbon (coke)              | 43.34      |\n| Volatile, bituminous inflamable matter | 50.00     |\n| Ashes                      | 6.66       |\n\nTotal,.......................... 100.00\n\n* Sir Roderick Impey Murchison.\nTertiary, Miocene (?) Rocks, greenish Sandstones, argillaceous Grits, Conglomerates, and red and green Clays.\n\nResting on the nummulite limestone there is observed throughout the Salt Range a conglomerate of small rounded boulders of a similar limestone connected by calcareous sandstone. This passes into a series of soft greenish sandstones, alternating with bands of conglomerate, in which small boulders of plutonic and metamorphic rocks predominate. These bands are very numerous near the Indus above Kalibagh where among the boulders a black porphyry (melaphyre) is very abundant. Along with the sandstones and conglomerates, beds of argillaceous grit and red and green clays occur, which contain crystals of selenite and small veins of carbonate of lime and quartz.\n\nThe sandstones are highly calcareous, effervesce strongly when treated with muriatic acid, which, after dissolving the calcareous matter, leaves a sand chiefly composed of quartz, felspar, hornblende, mica and magnetic iron. In the neighbourhood of the nummulite limestone, their surface is frequently encrusted with a slight saline efflorescence, but this disappears in the upper beds.\n\nWhere exposed to atmospheric influence and to the action of water charged with carbonic acid, the sandstones are extremely soft and incoherent, but at some depth from the surface, many of the strata are hard and compact, and of a dark grey colour.\n\nThe thickness of the above strata is enormous, and cannot, we should think, be less than ten thousand feet, having, wherever seen, a remarkable uniformity of character. Fragmentary portions of the bones of large mammalia, &c. are everywhere to be found associated with silicified wood of a brown colour. These are most abundant in the argillaceous grits which are often so hard as to form excellent millstones.\n\nThe harder beds of grey sandstone yield a remarkably handsome building stone, though by no means likely to be a durable one in many localities, on account of the facility with which water charged with carbonic acid removes its calcareous cement and reduces it to the strata of a slightly indurated sand. It has, we believe, been used extensively in the construction of the various works along the new Peshawur road west of the Bukrala Pass, where fresh beds have\nbeen exposed in the deep cuttings which have been made through the sandstones and clays which form entirely the Buhrala Range.\n\nGold is found in this formation in the form of minute scales diffused through the sandstones, and has doubtless been derived from plutonic and metamorphic rocks, the disintegration of which, has furnished the material of which the strata of the series are composed.\n\nIn the beds of the numerous nullahs or water-courses which flow through the Miocene district, the sand is washed pretty extensively for gold by the natives. It seems to be obtained in greatest quantity towards the Indus north of the Salt Range.\n\nAs compared with the gold fields of Australia and California the auriferous beds of the Punjab are, as far as is yet known in a practical point of view, insignificant; but are nevertheless interesting as illustrative of the extensive diffusion of gold in debris over the globe.\n\nWe have been quite unable to trace the source from whence the gold has been derived, and are not aware that, among the quartzites and quartzose mica slates, which are much developed in the Punchal Range near the Baramula Pass into Cashmere and stretch west into the northern Hazara mountains, the metal has ever been detected in situ. From similar rocks, there can be little doubt that the auriferous sands have been derived; but the Himalayas must, at the period of their formation, have had a very different aspect from what they now present, and may not have been elevated at all above the general level of the country.\n\nThe mode of obtaining the gold is, we fancy, nearly the same as that adopted in other countries.\n\nA part of the bed of a nullah or water-course or dry channel of a river having been fixed upon as a likely spot, the superficial stratum of sand and mud is removed, and that beneath collected with a wooden shovel and carried to the spot where it is to be washed, generally close at hand. The washing is effected in a long wooden box resembling a small shallow flat-bottomed boat, wide at one end and narrow at the other, where there is an opening for the escape of the water. The wide end of the \"cradle\" or troon as it is called, is slightly elevated, so as to give its flat bottom a gentle inclination towards its forepart, and a coarse sieve of reeds is then placed across the wide end of the box. On this the sand is thrown, and water\ndashed upon it, by which means the finer sand is washed into the cradle, the coarser gravel being retained on the sieve. By continuing the washing with a gentle stream of water, the lighter particles of the sand are carried down the inclined floor of the cradle and escape with the water, while the heavier and auriferous sand assumes the highest level next to the point where the water is applied. In a very short time nothing remains on the floor of the cradle but a thin stratum of black iron sand in which the scales of gold may occasionally be seen to spangle. By continuing the washing of the sand the lighter particles are removed and the auriferous portion concentrated within narrow limits. When the washing in the cradle has been carried as far as is considered safe, the sand is removed by the hand into a circular concave wooden platter called a Kuttree, about two feet in diameter, made generally of sissoo (Dalbergia sissoo) or other hard wood. In this, by a circular motion, it is agitated with water by which means an additional portion of the black sand is got rid of, and washed away from the inclined sides of the platter by a stream of water skilfully applied. The residue is then rubbed up with a little mercury which quickly by amalgamation separates the gold from the black sand. The mercury is then removed from the platter, enclosed in a fragment of cloth and placed on a bit of live charcoal, by which means the mercury is speedily vapourized, leaving the yellow gold entangled with the tinder of the cloth, from which by rubbing, it is easily removed. In this state it is taken to the goldsmiths, who by fusing it with borax remove any mechanical impurities. The Indus gold is said to have a whiter colour than that obtained to the eastward, which probably results from its containing a small portion of silver alloy.\n\nBy the process above described, a party of two or three individuals can in one day collect from six to eight annas worth of gold. The washings are generally most productive after rains, during which of course large quantities of fresh sand are washed from the surrounding rocks with the nullahs.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of the Salt Range the scales of gold are small and almost invisible, but we have heard from natives that in Hazara, grains of gold are sometimes found of a size such as to admit of their being picked out of the sand. If this be true, we may infer\nthat the auriferous source is somewhere to the north, and that by tracing the gold stream, so to speak, we might arrive at a point where the drifted materials become coarser, and where the gold, from its high specific gravity, has been deposited in larger quantity.\n\nBy a similar method of reasoning, Messrs. Clarke and Hargreaves, in 1851, were led to the discovery of the extensive gold fields in the alluvial deposits of the Bathurst district, in Australia, where the amount of gold obtained, seems likely to produce an entire revolution in the monetary system of the world.\n\nFrom the similarity of the central hilly districts of the gold fields of Australia with the auriferous districts of the Ural mountains, Sir Roderick Murchison, so early as the year 1844, predicted the existence of gold fields \"and in 1846 he addressed the President of the Geological Society of Cornwall on the subject, and recommended any Cornish tin-miners who were unemployed to emigrate to New South Wales and dig for gold in the debris and drift, on the flanks of, what he had previously termed, the Australian Cordilleras, in which he had recently heard that gold had been discovered in small quantities.\" Had the British Government then attended to the suggestions of science, much of the evil resulting from the recent announcement of the abundance of gold might have been prevented by the timely introduction of suitable regulations for its mining.\n\nGold, wherever it has been noticed in veins, is found in greatest quantity near their surface, \"which accounts for the existence of the metal in such abundance\" in the debris of auriferous rocks, \"the same agencies which deposited the drifted materials having also carried away the gold from the superficial portions of the veins in which it was originally formed.\"\n\nIn the sandstones and grits, but especially in the latter, bones, teeth, &c. occur. The bones seem chiefly to be the remains of large mammalia and are of a grey or a light brown colour. They are generally fragmentary, and are much rubbed, as if they had been transported from a distance. Associated with them we have found portions of the teeth of a species of mastodon and of a mammoth or elephant, the tusks of which, of enormous size, are occasionally found imbedded in the sandstone. We have also procured the core\nof the horn of a species of deer, and teeth probably of a nearly allied animal, besides several large saurian teeth large and curved tooth, probably that of some large animal; a portion of the carapax of a Chelonian was all The fossils nowhere occur in great abundance, but are ev found in the miocene strata between the Jhelum and the I\n\nThe only examples of molluscs which have been detect section with the above remains, consist of three specimen bably a species of Unio or Anadonta. These were found i sandstones on the southern side of mount Tillah near the Hoon by my assistant, Mr. Theobald.\n\nThe fossil wood formerly alluded to as occurring throu strata, is evidently of endogenous structure, and many of t appear to have belonged to trees of large size. At Kulli in soft sandstone strata north of the Salt lake, patches of in small quantity, which are probably carbonized portions but in these the woody structure is in a great degree oblit\n\nFrom both the mineral and zoological character of th strata which we have just described, there can be little d they are merely the western extension of the strata of t Range, which in the annals of geology have been rendere by the researches of Cautley and Falconer. These strata great Him\u00e1laya Range, and from the Sutledge, we believe traced along the north-eastward or hilly districts of the l the neighbourhood of the Jhelum, where they form a succ ranges, preserving a general parallelism, running in a S. S. tion towards the plains from the flank of the Punchal Ranq\n\nOn the left bank of the Jhelum, opposite the town, they Khorian range, and lower down stretch across the river Surafar hills which flank the east side of the Chuml between Tillah and Jelalpoor. In the neighbourhood of i the miocene strata dip to the east at an angle of 70\u00b0, the ally decreasing as we proceed eastward towards the Jhelu extend along the bank of the river to Jelalpoor where, in n tical strata on which the town is built, they appear at the f southern escarpment of the Salt Range, having evidently be into this position by the upheaval of the older rocks. About\nwest of Jelalpoor the sandstones disappear and no miocene strata are again seen on the south side of the range east of the Indus.\n\nProceeding westward from Jhelum along the Peshawur road, the miocene strata appear about four miles from Rhotas, rising out of the plain at a high angle, with a dip to the east and form the Rhotas range, which from the right bank of the Jhelum stretches south-west to Mount Tillah. By the upheaval however of the older strata of that mountain, an extensive fault has been produced by which the tertiaries in the immediate neighbourhood of its southern escarpment have been made to dip north, and, as it were, under the Devonian strata. Between Rhotas and Tillah the miocene beds are elevated into an anticlinal ridge, on the north side of which the strata dip westward towards Bukrala, where they are elevated into another parallel range to that of Rhotas. Beyond this they extend uninterruptedly to Rawul Pindee, presenting a series of anticlinal and synclinal axis.\n\nFrom the Tillah and Bakrala ranges the miocene strata extend along the north side of the Salt Range, elevated into scarped ridges with a dip at a considerable angle to the north, which gradually diminishes as we recede from the Range.\n\nIn its central part where the nummulite limestone strata are in many places in a nearly horizontal position, patches of miocene sandstones, &c. occur, but from the facility with which they decompose, are rapidly undergoing disintegration on the surface of the limestone. Along the north side of mount Sekesur and on to the Indus, the tertiaries are elevated along with the inferior rocks, and at Nummul above Moosakhail may be seen dipping conformably with them (as is the case everywhere else) at an angle of from $50^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$.\n\nAbove Maree on the Indus they form barren hills of considerable height, which extend along the river up to Mokhudd, a distance of about sixteen miles. On its right bank they attain a greater height, and the summit of the well known scarped precipice of Dinghote, about two miles above Maree at the foot of which the Indus flows, is, as ascertained by the Thermometer, 2,113 feet. Above the Indus at Maree, looking north from its summit; the horizontal ridges of miocene strata can be seen as far as the eye can reach, crossing the Indus from N. N. W. to S. S. E. with a dip to E. N. E. At Maree the angle of dip is $35^\\circ$, but this diminishes as we ascend the Indus.\nOn the Kalibagh hill the miocene strata have suffered great disturbance, and rest in some places on the salt marl. At this point there is a great amount of nummulite limestone conglomerate at the base of the formation. Along the north side of the hill it appears in normal order, resting on the nummulite limestone, and preserving this relation, stretches round into the Chichalee Range. On its west side the miocene strata are arranged in regular ridges forming the Chounterah Hills and in the Chichalee Pass, dip with the nummulite limestone to the north at an angle of 35\u00b0. From this to the Kaffir Kote range they occur uninterruptedly and there rest conformably on the carboniferous rocks dipping to the north-west under the Puncalah Pass, on the west side of which they are elevated into a high ridge which runs parallel to that of Kaffir Kote.\n\nAlong the east side of the Chichalee Range the same miocene sandstones, &c. occur as on the west side, but much disturbed and evidently overturned in some places during the upheaval of the range, which has thrown them under strata of the older rocks also overturned along with them, on which in a normal order they invariably repose.\n\nCaptain Strachey in a paper recently laid before the Geological Society, has described a series of tertiary ossiferous sandstones, &c. which occur on the Thibet plain on the north side of the Himalayas at an elevation of from 14 to 16,000 feet, which most probably are of an identical character with those of the Sivalik and Salt Ranges. These he describes however as \"presenting an almost perfectly horizontal surface,\" and resting unconformably on oolitic strata, (apparently similar to those of the Salt Range), from whence he draws the conclusion that the oolitic strata, &c. on which the ossiferous tertiaries rest, have been elevated previous to the formation of the latter, but from the abundance of remains of large mammalia in these, he considers that \"there can be no doubt that these strata have been elevated to their present height from some lower level since the time of their deposition.\"\n\nIn the Salt Range, we think, we have obtained sufficient proof that until after the deposition of the miocene sandstones, &c. no sudden or extensive elevatory action had been exerted, and that during their formation, the surrounding country must have been in a condition\nsuitable for the maintenance of numerous huge mammalia, the remains of which, now entombed in rock, must, judging from their appearance, have been transported to a distance from the spot where they died.\n\nThat plutonic, metamorphic and igneous rocks must have formed the district, by the disintegration of which the materials forming the miocene strata have been derived, every one must admit, and as the boulders found in the conglomerates are small and such as we see now carried down by streams from Indian mountains during ordinary floods, we think it probable that the district in which the miocene beds occur, must have presented a range of mountains skirted at their base by a grove of forest capable of affording food to large pachydermata, and washed by an extensive fresh-water lake, in which the saurians, &c. whose teeth occur in the sandstone, could live and flourish. Into this, floods from the surrounding mountains transport boulders of rock, gravel and sand as well as the remains of land animals and trunks of trees. A succession of floods over an extended period would, we conceive, supply material for the formation of strata similar to the miocene beds we are considering.\n\nIt is not at all improbable that the sea may have had occasional access to our supposed lake, indeed the saline incrustation on the sandstones, &c. where they approach the nummulite limestone (an undoubted marine formation) strengthens this idea.\n\nThe absence, however, of marine shells, or other remains which exist so abundantly in the inferior strata, completely, we conceive, refutes the supposition that the miocene strata have been deposited in \"a true sea bottom,\" an opinion, which as regards the Thibet tertiaries in which no marine organic remains have been found, Strachey seems disposed to adopt, while at the same time he admits \"that there is no direct proof that these beds are marine.\"\n\nWhen we consider the fragile character, and we believe comparative scarcity, in northern India, of land or fresh water shells, it is not surprising that they should so seldom occur in the miocene strata. The Phys\u00e6, Pup\u00e6, and Helices, which abound over the Salt Range hills, are very rarely to be found in the alluvial deposits at their base, and the fact that rain water charged with carbonic acid, which it always acquires by passing through vegetation, is a most powerful solvent of carbonate of lime may explain in a great mea-\nsure the scarcity of land shells. The rarity of the common land-\nshells of the Punjab in the high alluvial banks seen on the sides of\nthe rivers, has often struck us as very remarkable.\n\nShould the beds described by Strachey be proved hereafter to be\nidentical with those on the southern flank of the Himalaya or Siva-\nlik strata, it will go far to prove that this stupendous range has\nbeen upheaved from near the level of the sea to its present altitude\nat a comparatively recent period.\n\nFrom a cursory examination of the ranges of hills between Rawul\nPindee and the Baramula Pass, we are inclined to believe that from\nthe former place to Ooree on the Cashmere river, nothing but mio-\ncene strata occur, forming ranges of from 4 to 8000 feet in height.\nAt Ooree the metamorphic schist of the Punchal Range seems to\nhave been forced through the sandstone strata, both being at this\npoint tilted up into a nearly vertical position with a strike from east\nto west. Hard specimens of sandstone from this locality are undis-\ntinguishable from the hard grey miocene sandstone of the Salt\nRange. Between the Jhelum and Cashmere river in a line from\nOoree to Rawul Pindee, we have never observed any organic remains,\nbut towards Bhimbur to the eastward of Ooree, we believe, they are\noccasionally found, and are called by the natives \"deo ka dant\"\nor Demon's teeth, a name by which they are generally known in the\nSalt Range.\n\nIn reckoning as miocene, the sandstone grits and conglomerates\nwe have endeavoured to describe, we only follow the generally-\nreceived opinion as to the age of the Sivalik strata. Further investi-\ngation may prove that these, as well as the corresponding strata west\nof the Sutledge, are of even more recent formation.\n\nThe occurrence of gold in the formation, furnishes an argument in\nfavour of its being of post tertiary age, this metal and platinum\nbeing considered \"the last formed of the metals\" by the learned\nauthor of the article entitled Siberia and California in No. 174\n(September 1850) of the Quarterly Review.\n\nPost pliocene strata.\n\nALLUVIUM.\n\nResting on the miocene strata in an unconformable manner, may\nbe noticed in many places along the north side especially of the\nSalt Range, terraces composed of a succession of nearly horizontal layers of small boulders, gravel, sand and mud, the debris chiefly of Salt Range rocks. The boulders and gravel in these are very generally cemented by calcareous matter into the consistence of rock, and bands of kunkur, an impure concretionary limestone, are in some places abundant. This has doubtless been deposited by calcareous springs or by rain water which by passing through vegetation, has acquired carbonic acid and, through its solvent agency, carbonate of lime. In a similar way extensive deposits of travertine and calcareous tufa have been formed over the surface of the nummulite limestone and miocene strata.\n\nIn the neighbourhood of the Salt Range the alluvial beds have a slight dip towards the north, but gradually acquire horizontality, and increase in thickness and fineness of material, as we follow them into the plain or rather ravine country north of the range, where sections of them fifty to sixty feet in depth are exposed in the numerous nullahs and water courses which intersect the district, and in the beds of which they are seen reposing on the tilted up ends of the miocene strata.\n\nAlong the southern or scarped side of the range deposits of a similar character occur, but for a distance varying from one to two miles from its base, the materials are coarse and consist entirely of boulders of rock and gravel brought down by the numerous streams, which during rain acquire transporting powers which must be seen to be believed; we have on several occasions seen boulders three and four feet in diameter rolled along with the noise of thunder, by the force of streams suddenly swollen. As we recede from the range, the boulders gradually diminish, and are succeeded by deposits of gravel, sand and mud, the layers of which in the plain assume a nearly horizontal position.\n\nTravertine or calcareous tufa is extensively burnt and yields a lime of excellent quality. It frequently, however, contains a quantity of mud, which is objectionable. At Jhelum the greater part of the lime used is obtained from travertine, and at Rawul Pindee, around which enormous deposits of it occur, we believe it is exclusively burnt. From its porous character it requires less fuel for its perfect calcination than the ordinary limestones of the district, a\nmatter of some importance when wood is scarce. Kunkur, used extensively for the metalling of roads is abundant everywhere in the alluvial deposit. Irregular beds of it occur in the neighbourhood of Jhelum.\n\nThe organic remains found in the alluvial formation appear to be entirely of a recent character, and to consist of the bones of bullocks, horses, camels, goats, &c. mixed with a few land shells of the genera Physa, Pupa, &c. The extreme scarcity of the bones is very remarkable, considering the number of bones and skeletons everywhere seen lying on the surface.\n\nWe are not aware that the remains of any large pachydermata have been found associated with the above bones.\n\nAs the alluvial strata north of the Salt Range are apparently formed from the debris of the tertiary strata, \"gold dust\" must occur in these, and, during rain, must be washed into the various streams and water courses. The immense number of boulders of Plutonic, Volcanic and Schistose rocks which occur in the alluvion or drift in the neighbourhood of Mokhudd on the Indus (though identical with those in the miocene conglomerates), may possibly in part be derived from other rocks to the northward which may contain gold. The black slate rocks of Attock if metamorphic or of Lower Siberian or Cambrian age (we have never visited the locality) and invaded by quartz veins, may probably yield gold. Boulders of slate rock, similar to hard specimens we possess from Attock, occur abundantly both in the auriferous miocene (?) as well as drift or alluvial strata between Kalibagh and Mokhudd. As illustrating the statistics of gold in the Punjab, we may add on the authority of L. Bowring, Esq. C. S. that in the Jhelum district, which includes all the auriferous ground near the Salt Range, with the exception of a small corner near the Indus in which Mokhudd is situated, there were in the year 1850, 158 cradles or troons in use for gold washing, which paid to Government an annual tax of Rs. 525, from Rs. 2 to 5 being levied on each troon. We can obtain no information as to the yield of gold from each troon; but when at Mokhudd, in 1848, the Kardar of that place informed me that in\n1844,........409 tolas* of gold were collected.\n1845,........272...Do. ...........

At this depth the influence of tides could not produce the ripple markings observed in the Devonian sandstones, and we must therefore infer that previous to the deposition of the carboniferous strata, the former must have undergone a gradual subsidence to an extent sufficient to admit of the deposition of the latter, the strata of which must have rapidly increased in thickness, so as to have had their surface raised to a depth at which the Cephalopoda which abound in the upper beds could exist.\n\nBy the deposition of the sandstones and shales of the middle carboniferous series, the strata seem to have been elevated to the surface of the sea and a beach at least must have existed, on which the marks of falling rain or hail were impressed. After this period, a\n\n* This Tola weighs 165 grains. In 1844, there were therefore collected 140 Troy Oz. and 285 grains of gold.\nsecond subsidence must have occurred to admit of the formation of the upper carboniferous beds which in some places contain brachiopoda in abundance. By the gradual accumulation of calcareous and sedimentary matter, these seem again to have been brought near the surface, and dry land must have existed at the commencement of the oolitic series on which delicate ferns could support existence.\n\nSucceeding the beds which contain these, we have the oolitic grits and shales, with fragments of large conifers which incontrovertibly prove the existence of land from whence the wood, &c. had been drifted. As we ascend in the oolitic series the wood becomes scarcer and as terebratul\u00e6 occur in the upper limestones and belemnites and ammonites in the upper shales and green sandstone, it seems probable that soon after the commencement of the formation, a third subsidence occurred, by which the strata were sunk to a considerable depth under the sea, from which they did not emerge until towards the close of the nummulite limestone formation. By a gradual and local deposition of calcareous matter along a particular line, similar to the manner in which coral reefs are formed, a sea barrier may have been raised, inside which in an inland fresh-water sea, the miocene strata have probably been deposited.\n\nThe occurrence of small water-worn boulders of nummulite limestone cemented by calcareous sand into a conglomerate which forms the lower member of the miocene beds in the Salt Range, indicates the existence of a beach where they may have been formed by the lashing of the waves.\n\nAs all the strata seen in the Salt Range repose conformably on each other, it appears to us certain that from a position of comparative horizontality they have all been upheaved subsequent to the deposition of the miocene strata. The upheaving force seems to have extended from east to west, the direction of the Range corresponding to the strike of the strata. Whether this has been exerted by the agency of plutonic or igneous rocks, we have no means of judging, as no rocks of the kind appear in the Salt Range or its neighbourhood.\n\nBetween Rhotas and mount Tillah the elevating force has raised the miocene strata into an anticlinal ridge. Along the line of this mountain, however, to the westward it has been exerted with greater violence, having produced a fracture of the strata along the line of\nstrike elevating the northern portion into a high ridge, the strata forming which have a northerly dip, and present a steep escarpment to the south. Along the south side of this line of fault the miocene strata seem only to have suffered, and are either thrown under the older elevated strata of the escarpment, as along the south side of mount Tillah, or tilted up at a high angle with a southerly dip, as at Jelalpoor. Moving westward, the elevatory action seems to have extended laterally over a greater surface, and to have produced several lines of fault which, in the central part of the Salt Range, have in some places thrown the strata into great confusion, and caused the formation of numerous longitudinal valleys, ridges and transverse ravines. In section No. 8 two very distinct faults, seen in the range west of mount Sikesur, are represented.\n\nAt Moosakhail where the range running in a north-west direction is not more than three miles broad, and is intersected by a transverse gorge, an excellent section is exhibited of the strata from the carboniferous limestone to the miocene beds. Here the upheaving force has raised the carboniferous strata into an anticlinal ridge, and without fracturing them has produced a graceful curving which is well seen near the entrance to the ravine. Above the carboniferous strata, a fracture has extended through the oolitic and superincumbent rocks, dipping to the N. N. E., and a vast amount of their debris covers the carboniferous limestone as it dips to the S. S. W. under the plain. Between Moosakhail and the Indus, where the range again expands, and is eight or nine miles in breadth, considerable disturbance prevails among the strata.\n\nWhen describing the position of the Kalibagh coal we alluded to the overturning of the strata in the Kalibagh hill, and need not refer to it again.\n\nIn the Chichalee Range which runs from north-east to south-west the elevatory action seems to have extended laterally with violence over but a small extent, but has produced a most remarkable and distinct overturning of the strata along its south-east or scarped side. This is represented in section 9 as seen in the Chichalee pass, at the entrance to which, in an overturned position, the strata from the miocene sandstones, &c. to the oolitics, may be observed, and separated by a fault from the same beds on a steep escarpment, in regular order, dipping to the north at an angle of from $30^\\circ$ to $35^\\circ$.\nA more complete overturn of strata can nowhere be found. The lower portion has evidently been broken off the upper portion of the series, and by the eruptive force been made to describe an arc of 18\u00b0.\n\nOn moving south along the range and about five miles beyond the Chichalee pass, in a ravine called Peela Wan the strata present a distinct anticlinal axis along the foot of the escarpment.\n\nSection across the Chichalee Range in the Peela Wan, five miles below Kothee.\n\n| S.

The eocene formation seems to have suffered much during the overturn as it is much reduced in thickness and is everywhere shivered and contorted. The alum shales too seem to have been squeezed out of the limestone as it were, as no trace of them is to be seen.\n\nThe same anticlinal arrangement of the strata may be traced along the Chichalee Range to Mittha near the Kurum river, where a scarped ridge of miocene strata forms the range. All along the southern side of the line of fault or fracture in the Salt Range, the strata have suffered denudation to such an extent as to have removed in most places all traces of rock in situ.\n\nThe effects of the overturning of the strata in the Chichalee Range are, to a Geologist, often most perplexing, and until we had seen the section as exposed in the Chichalee Pass and to the south, we had difficulty in explaining how shales full of ammonites, belemnites, &c. could possibly occur dipping apparently under carboniferous limestone full of palaeozoic fossil, as may be seen above the village of Kalokhail near Kalibagh.\n\nThe upheaval of the Him\u00e1layas after the tertiary era and contemporaneously with the Salt Range will fully explain the anomalies described by Captain Strachey of tertiary, secondary and palaeozoic strata dipping on the south or Indian side of the Him\u00e1layas, as it were under the metamorphic schists of the central ridge, while on the northern side they rest upon these in a regular order.\n\nThe researches of Dr. Thomson while engaged on the Thibet Mission, will, we trust, throw light on this interesting subject. A journal of his travels for two years in the northern Him\u00e1layas is now, we are happy to know, in course of publication in England.\n\n(To be concluded.)\nRemarks on the different species of Orang-utan.\u2014By E. Blyth, Esq.\n\nTo Mr. W. W. Nicholls of Sarawak, the Society is indebted for the nearly perfect skeleton of an adult wild Orang-utan, of the peculiar species known to the inhabitants of Borneo, according to Sir James Brooke, by the name *Mias Pappan*; and which, together with other skulls and skeletons of adult Orangs in our museum, and the exquisite lithographs of others, again, published by Professor Owen, fully bears out the opinion of Sir J. Brooke expressed in a letter to the Zoological Society and published in the 'Proceedings' of that Society for 1841, p. 55, of the existence of three distinct species of Orang-utan in Borneo.\n\nProfessor Owen had previously distinguished his *Pithecus morio* (*Mias Kassar* of Brooke) from the great Orang then known to him, from specimens to which I had the pleasure of first calling his attention, and which are admirably figured in the 'Transactions of the Zoological Society,' Vol. II, pl. 30 to 34 inclusive; and from certain differences observable in skulls of great Orangs compared and figured by him, believed or known respectively to be from Borneo or Sumatra, the same zoologist has indicated what appeared to him to be at least local varieties, one proper to each of those islands, and he applies the names *P. Abelii* to that of Sumatra and *P. Wurmbii* to that of Borneo, of course under the impression that the great Sumatran Orang referred to was identical with that described by Dr. Clarke Abel from Sumatra in *As. Res.* XV, 489.\n\nA huge skull of an adult male Orang, undoubtedly from Borneo, is figured in *Trans. Zool. Soc.* II, pl. 31 and 32; and that of an adult female (?), said to be from Sumatra, in the same work, Vol. I, pl. 53 and 54. The differences between these skulls are considerable: and they are, to some extent, borne out in a huge male skull marked from Sumatra and in an aged female skull marked from Borneo, in this Society's museum.* In both of the latter, however, the characters are throughout intermediate. The zygomatic suture\n\n* Presented by Major Gregory in 1838 (vide *J. A. S.* VII, 669); the Sumatran male skull, however, having been for some years reserved.\nof the Sumatran male begins even anteriorly to that of Prof. Owen's Bornean male: the *symphysis menti* in both is equally developed: the supra-orbital ridges, however, are much more prominent in the male from Sumatra, as in Prof. Owen's Sumatran female; but in our aged Bornean female skull, they are considerably more developed, proportionally, than in Mr. Owen's Bornean male. In both of Mr. Owen's specimens, the palate is represented as contracted posteriorly, between the last molars on each side, to $1\\frac{1}{2}$ in. (or rather more in the Sumatran female). In our Sumatran male the distance is fully $1\\frac{1}{2}$ in.; and in the Bornean female $1\\frac{1}{2}$ in. I can come to no other conclusion than that all represent individual varieties of one species, having perhaps a tendency to exhibit the local variation which Prof. Owen has indicated.\n\nThe same naturalist adds\u2014\"The Bornean Pongo, if we may judge from the few specimens undoubtedly from that locality which exist in the museums of this country, is clothed with loose long hair of a deep fuscous colour, approaching in some parts to black; the Sumatran Pongo is covered with loose long hair of a reddish-brown colour. The adult male of the Bornean species has the countenance disfigured by large dermal callosities upon the cheek-bones. These do not exist in either sex of the Sumatran species.\" It is worthy of note that the term *species* is here bestowed, probably from the remarkable difference implied by the last mentioned character. The fully adult Sumatran male described by Dr. Clarke Abel, however, and the skin of which is still in this Society's museum, possesses the cheek callosities, less developed however than in the Bornean male figured by Prof. Temminck.\n\nSir J. Brooke, in his highly interesting letter already referred to, besides pointing out the distinctions of two of his three species of Bornean Orang from personal observation of the living or freshly killed animals wild and tame, remarks that the skulls also examined by him may be divided into three distinct sorts.\n\n\"The first presents two ridges, one rising from each frontal bone, which joining on the top of the head, form an elevated crest, which runs backward to the cerebral portion of the skull.\" To this may accordingly be referred the *P. Wurmbii* and the *P. Abellii* of Owen, and, it would seem, all the adult skeletons at present in Europe\nwithout described exception.* It would appear that neither sex has\nthe cheek callosities at any age; and the colour of the hair is said\nto be darker than in the others. This description corresponds with\nthe appearance of an enormous female Orang-utan that was exhi-\nbited some years ago in Calcutta (vide J. A. S. XVI, note to p.\n729); and the animal is the Mias Rambi of Sir J. Brooke.\n\nThe same observer continues\u2014\"The second variety [of skull] is\nthe Simia Morio, and nothing need be added to Mr. Owen's account,\nsave that it presents no ridge whatever beyond the frontal part of\nthe head. No. 9 in the collection is that of an adult male. * * *\nThere are many other skulls of the Simia Morio which nearly coin-\ncide with this suite, and this suite so entirely coincides through the\ndifferent stages of age, one with another, that no doubt can exist of\nthe Simia Morio being a distinct species. The different character\nof the skull, its small size and small teeth, put the matter beyond\ndoubt, and completely establish Mr. Owen's acute and triumphant\nargument, drawn from a single specimen.\"\u2014Of Pitheous Morio, our\nmuseum contains a skeleton (minus most of the bones of the hands\nand feet) of an aged female, presented by R. W. G. Frith, Esq., in\n1836.\u2020 It had died in Calcutta, and the skin containing the bones of\nthe hands and feet had been unfortunately thrown away when Mr.\nFrith secured the body for the Society's Museum. A few of the\ndigital bones, however, were recovered. Comparing the skull of this\nspecimen with that figured by Prof. Owen (Trans. Zool. Soc. II, pl.\n33 and 34), I incline to infer that Mr. Owen's specimen is the skull\nof a male animal, chiefly from the greater depth of the alveoli: the\nlongitudinal extent of grinding surface of the series of upper molars\n(bicuspids included) is exactly 2 in., as also in another skull of an\nadult female to be presently noticed, and 2 in. 2 l. in that figured by\nProf. Owen: lastly, the zygomatic arch of our aged female skull is\nmuch more slender than that of either of the others.\n\n* Unless, perhaps, that of an adolescent female in the museum of the Royal\nCollege of Surgeons, London.\n\n\u2020 Vide J. A. S. V, 833, where mentioned as \"the Sumatran Orang-utan.\" She\nwas one, however, of a pair purchased by our joint-Secretary Mr. Grote, at Singa-\npore; and this gentleman informs me\u2014\"They were not from Sumatra, but from\nBorneo. At least I am pretty sure that my memory does not deceive me on this\npoint.\"\nWe have also another and complete skeleton of an adolescent female, which lived twelve years in Calcutta in the possession of J. Apcar, Esq., and was very young when he received it. The last molars above and below had just pierced the gums. The skin of this individual is mounted in our museum, possessing hair of a very dark colour on the crown, back and arms. Having passed its life in close captivity, with nought to call forth the vigorous action of its muscles, their development with that of the osseous system generally would seem to have been considerably affected, and the skull retains a remarkably juvenile (which in this case means anthropoid) expression, contrasting greatly with that of our other and aged female skull already noticed. But making every allowance for difference of age and a life of close imprisonment, and the other specimen had in all probability been captured when fully adult, there remain some extraordinary discrepancies, which probably indicate a further specific distinctness. All the bones of the aged animal are more robust than those of the other; but while the leg-bones and the humeri of the two are of the same length, or at all events the humerus of the aged animal does not exceed by \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) in. that of the adolescent, the radius of the aged specimen is 2 in. longer than that of the other.\n\nThe differences in the form of the skull are very considerable. The younger individual has the face conspicuously shorter and broader, with circular orbital cavities, while those of the aged animal are perpendicularly oblong. The vertical span of the orbital cavity is \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) in. in the aged specimen, \\( 1\\frac{3}{4} \\) in. in the other; horizontal span of the same \\( 1\\frac{1}{2} \\) in. in the former, \\( 1\\frac{3}{4} \\) in. in the latter. In the younger individual the orbital process of the frontal and that of the malar bones form together a projecting angle where united by the suture; in the other they do not angulate at all. Extreme breadth of bony orbits in the adolescent specimen 4 in.; in the other \\( 3\\frac{1}{2} \\) in. The zygoma of the aged individual, as before remarked, is much more slender than in the skull figured by Prof. Owen; in the younger, the malar portion of the zygoma is even broader than in Mr. Owen's specimen. The nasal orifice of the aged skull is much larger than that of the other. The development of the alveolar portion of the jaws is also much greater in the aged animal; whence the chin\nRemarks on the different species of Orang-utan.\n\nIn the aged specimen the ramus or ascending portion of the lower jaw turns abruptly at a right angle with the alveolar portion, and the coronoid process is little developed, and does not rise to a level with the zygomatic arch; in the young specimen, the form is more as in Mr. Owen's figure, though less angulated. In this adolescent skull the intermaxillary bones continue strongly demarcated.\n\nIt remains for future observation of additional specimens to determine whether the differences here indicated denote a diversity of species, or whether they may be referred to extraordinary individual variation.*\n\n\"The third distinction of the skulls,\" continues Sir J. Brooke, \"is, that the ridges rising from the frontal bones do not meet, but diverge towards the top of the head, and again diverge towards the posterior portion of the skull. These ridges are less elevated than in the first mentioned skulls, but the size of the adult skulls is normal, and both present specimens of aged animals.\" A wild adult male killed by himself, with huge cheek callosities, proved to possess this form of skull: but Sir J. Brooke erroneously assigns the animal Pithecus Wurmbii apud Owen, in which, as we have seen, the mandibular crests unite upon the crown, as they also do in his P. Abelii (here regarded as a mere variety of the same species); whereas the Bornean animal of Van Wurm and the Sunstran animal of Dr. Clarke Abel were of the present race distinguished by the ugly cheek callosities, and to which no special name has been assigned, as the appellations intended for them have been at-\n\n* I had recently the opportunity of observing a nearly grown living male of what I considered to be Pithecus morio. It had no cheek callosities, and had not developed its hindermost molars. This animal was taken in the 'Hindustan' steamer for Suez; and is, I think, a larger Orang than has hitherto been seen alive in Europe. Before reaching Madras, it escaped from its cage and found its way into the saloon, where it would appear to have been re-captured with some difficulty and to have severely bitten two of its captors. In its cage it seemed quiet and good-tempered, and I handled it freely; but could not get to see it to much advantage. It appeared to resemble much the adolescent female above described, but was smaller, with larger face, and the expression was as distinctly masculine in the one as feminine in the other.\ntached respectively to Bornean and Sumatran examples of the *Mias Rambi*.\n\nThe Bornean species with double-crested skull and huge cheek callosities is the *Mias Pappan* of Sir J. Brooke, or rather of the native Dyaks: and Sir J. Brooke remarks of it (not at that time having seen a female), that\u2014\"Both Malays and Dyaks are positive that the female of the *Mias Pappan* has cheek callosities, the same as the male:\" and from his own observation he adds that the *Mias Kassar* has no cheek callosities in either sex; whereas some young *Pappans* he had shipped, \"(one of them not a year old, with two first molars,) shew them prominently.\"* For a figure of the adult male of the *Mias Pappan* of Borneo, and series of plates illustrative of its anatomy, vide the great Dutch work of Dr. S. M\u00fcller and Professor Temminck; but unfortunately they give no representation of the bony crests upon the skull.\n\nOf the long celebrated specimen of a large Orang-utan procured by Capt. Cornfoot in Sumatra, and described by Dr. Clarke Abel in the 'Asiatic Researches,' Vol. XV, p. 489, we still possess the skin minus the right hand and right foot, and of its osteology only the lower jaw and the bones contained in the dried left hand and left foot. It is by no means a specimen of the largest size, as long ago shewn by Dr. Harwood in *Lin. Trans.* XV, 472;\u2020 but the teeth and appearance of the jaw prove it to be fully grown, and the third inferior true molar is scarcely less abraded than the penultimate. This lower jaw is remarkable (especially as being that of a mature male animal) for the small antero-posterior diameter of its ramus or ascending portion as distinguished from the alveolar portion, and also for the small size of the condyle. Vide figures in *As. Res.* XV, pl. IV, and (\u00bd size) in *J. A. S.* VI, pl. XVIII; and compare these\n\n---\n\n* Mr. Nicholls states, in a letter, that\u2014\"Both sexes of the *Mias Pappan* have immense cheek callosities: a full grown female was lately killed at Samaratan, the callosities of which extended as low down as the breasts [here the tracheal sac must be referred to! The *Mias Rambi* is without any callosities, and is, I think, covered with longer fur than the *M. Pappan* has.\"\n\n\u2020 Dr. Harwood gives the length of the feet of a Bornean Orang described by him as 15\u00bd in.: the dried foot of Dr. Abel's specimen (containing the bones) measures 13 in.\nwith the representations now given of the lower jaws of other Orangs, and especially with that of the great Sumatran skull of a female *Mias Rambii* figured by Prof. Owen in *Trans. Zool. Soc.* I, pl.\n\nIts greatest antero-posterior diameter (on a plane with the molars) is 2\u00bd in. only, that of a female (?) *Pappan* from Borneo is 2\u00bd in., of a Bornean female *Rambi* 2\u00bd in., of a Sumatran male *Rambi* 2\u00bd in., and of Prof. Owen's Bornean male the same, and of his Sumatran female 2\u00bd in. Yet all the teeth are somewhat larger than those of the Bornean female (?) *Pappan*, and equal those of our great Sumatran male *Rambi*. The hands and feet also are larger than those of the female (?) *Pappan* from Borneo. There are no materials for extending the comparison: but it may be remarked, of Dr. Clarke Abel's specimen, that (as before asserted) it has distinct cheek callosities, although seemingly less developed than in Dr. S. M\u00fcller's figure. The beard, however, is scarcely less grown:\u2014but the general colour of the hair is much darker, and more of a maroon-red; inclining to ferruginous upon the crown, and the beard is bright ferruginous contrasting strongly with the rest.\u2020 I incline to consider it identical with the *Mias Pappan* of Borneo, notwithstanding the comparative thinness of the ramus of the lower jaw in this particular specimen; and I suggest that the old name *Pithecius satyrus* be now restricted to this species, and justly or with peculiar justice, as Sir J. Brooke remarks in his letter, \"from the ugly face and disgusting callosities.\"\u2021\n\nThe nearly perfect skeleton now presented to the Society by Mr. Scholls is that of a fully mature Bornean female (?) of the *Mias Pappan*, in which the strongly developed lamdoidal ridges of the skull do not unite upon the vertex to form a single sagittal crest,\n\nThis specimen is remarkable for having a well developed ungual phalanx and to the hallux; a character of rare occurrence in the genus, and exhibited by another specimen in the Society's collection.\n\nAs the *Rambi* is neither Wurm's nor Abel's animal, the names *Wurmbi* and *Abelli* are unsuitable for it, and had better be discarded; while as Raja Brooke was the first to discriminate it from the *Pappan*, I would suggest that it now bear the designation of *Pithecius Brookesi*. Should the second small Orang also prove a good species, the name *Owenii* bestowed on it would be a fitting compliment to an eminent zoologist, who has devoted so much attention to the study of the great Anthropoid Apes.\n\n3 b 2\nbut continue an inch apart where most approximated. The size of the skull is fully equal, or even somewhat superior, to that of our aged female skull of a *Mias Rambii* from Borneo; but is inferior to that of our Sumatran male of the *Mias Rambii*. The skull is perfect, except that part of the face appears to have been shot away, vis. the uppermost portion of the right superior maxillary from the orbit to the nasal orifice, with parts of the adjacent malar, lachrymal, and nasal bones of the same side; and the supra-orbital ridge of the left frontal is diseased, with portions of bone exfoliating away. The vertebral column is complete, excepting the two last small coccygeal bones. The ribs and sternal series are also complete, and the great bones of the limbs; but many of the smaller bones of the latter are unfortunately missing. Thus, of the right hand, there are wanting the scaphoid, and the five unguinal phalanges. Of the left hand, there also are wanting the five unguinal phalanges, the medial thumb-phalanx, and the cuneiform bone of the wrist. Of the right foot are wanting the *os calcis*, *astragalus*, and navicular bone, four unguinal phalanges (the terminal phalanx of the hallux remaining), the penultimate phalanx of the finger-toe next to the hallux, and the penultimate and ante-penultimate phalanges of that furthest from the hallux, corresponding to the human little toe. And of the left foot there are only the *astragalus*, and the digital bones excepting the metatarsal of the digit next to the hallux, and the unguinal phalanges of the outer three toes.* The *patella* are also lost.\n\nThis valuable skeleton affords us the means of demonstrating, from adult specimens in our museum, the existence of the three species of Bornean Orang-utan indicated by Sir J. Brooke; and most probably we possess a fourth in the mounted skin and complete skeleton of the adolescent female resembling *Pithecus morio* in size, but having a much shorter fore-arm and more anthropoid conformation of skull. We have also (provisionally) identified Dr. Clarke Abel's\n\n* Accordingly, but one unguinal phalanx remains, which articulates with the digit next to the hallux of the left foot. The terminal phalanx of each hallux exhibits a peculiar structure, and represents the ordinary penultimate (and not the unguinal) phalanx; so that this Bornean *Pepper* differs herein from Abel's Sumatran *Pepper*, which possessed a well developed unguinal phalanx and nail to the opposable hallux or great toe.\nSumatran Orang-utan with the *Mias Pappan* of Borneo, to which specific name *satyrus* is here proposed to be restricted; and we have referred Prof. Owen's *P. Wurmii* and *P. Abelii* to the *Mias Rambii* of Borneo, which also should therefore be common to the two islands. The small *P. morio*, so far as hitherto known, is peculiar to Borneo; and it now remains to ascertain whether there be not some small species confounded under this, two small as well as two large species of these animals. It is only recently that a great and small species of Chimpanzee have likewise been discriminated and completely established by Prof. Owen and Dr. Kneeland.*\n\nThe three Bornean species of Orang of Sir J. Brooke (at least two of which would appear likewise to inhabit Sumatra) are more different from each other in the appearance of the adult skull than the Lion, Tiger, and Leopard are among cats; yet with the exception of the bony ridges, which in the *morio* are merely indicated (exhibiting the direction which they assume in the *Mias Pappan*), I have been unable to detect any difference of structure between the skulls of the two great species which may denote other than slight individual variation. In general, the form and size of our *satyrus Pappan* skull are intermediate to those of our (Sumatran) male and (Bornean) female *Mias Rambii* skulls; and the nasal orifice of the former is comparatively small. But how slight is the difference between the skulls even of the Lion and Tiger among cats,\u2014confined to a straighter profile on the part of the Lion, and to the fact that the nasals extend back beyond the suture of the maxillaries in the Tiger skull, while they fall short of that suture in the Lion skull!\u2020\n\n* Vide Trans. Zool. Soc. III, 381, and Ann. Mag. N. H., July, 1852, p. 3 et seq.\n\nAn analogous diversity perhaps exists in the skulls of the *Mias Rambii* and *Pappan*, which, if it prove constant, will be of service in enabling us to determine to which of these species immature skulls showing large permanent teeth should be referred. In our adult male and female *Mias Rambii* heads, and in one juvenile skull taken from a stuffed specimen of a half grown male without a sign of cheek-callosities in our museum, the united nasal bones extend upward to the summit of the *glabella* between the supra-orbital ridges; whereas in the *Mias Pappan* skull, and also in both (species?) of our *Mias Kaiser*, the united nasal bones extend upward but little beyond the maxillary suture, and the same in\nFrom the form of the pelvis, and from the inferior longitudinal extent of the molar series as compared with that of the lower jaw of Dr. Clarke Abel's Sumatran male Pappan, also from the inferior size of the hand and foot as compared with these members in Dr. Abel's specimen, I have considered the skeleton of a Pappan now presented by Mr. Nicholls to be that of a female animal; but not without considerable hesitation.* We have no male pelvis of an adult Orang for comparison; but two of undoubted females of the small species, and one of these (that of the animal which passed its life in close captivity) is singularly narrow, and probably differs little from a male pelvis. The skeletons of adult Mias Rambi and of adult of the small Chimpanzee figured by Prof. Owen in the first Volume of the 'Transactions of the Zoological Society' are also those of females; and Mr. Owen gives 5 in. 5 l. as the antero-posterior diameter and 4 in. as the transverse diameter of the pelvic aperture of his adult female Mias Rambi, the corresponding diameters of the pelvic aperture of our Mias Pappan being 5 in. and 4 in., in our aged female Mias Kassar 4\u00bd and 3\u00bd in., and in our adolescent female with the comparatively short fore-arms 4\u00bd and 2\u00bd in.(!); which last are probably the permanent male proportions, to which I\n\nthree immature skulls with large permanent molars in course of development, which should therefore represent the young of the Mias Pappan.\n\nIt remains however to ascertain how far this distinction may prove constant. We have, in all, five stuffed specimens of Orangs, viz.: 1, Dr. Clarke Abel's Sumatran male Pappan,\u20142, Mr. Apes's adolescent female Kassar (?) with short fore-arm,\u20143, a young female Kassar (?) with small permanent grinders appearing, and similar proportion of arm and fore-arm to last,\u20144, a very young Mias\u2014\u2014?,\u2014and 5, the young male Mias Rambi (?) before referred to. Colour of No. 5 a darkish ferruginous, deepest on the crown, paler and more rufous on the shoulders and back and also the whiskers; hands and feet small, as in the Mias Kassar. Colour of No. 3, a lightish ferruginous, deepening on the arms, and darkest on the crown and between the shoulders. It would seem that the various species, however distinct in form of skull, are not to be very readily distinguished when prepared as stuffed specimens, unless indeed we had adults of each for comparison.\n\n* Mr. Nicholls states, in a letter,\u2014\u201cI obtained the skeleton which I sent through others, and therefore cannot be certain about its sex; but, if I remember right, it was given me as that of a male Pappan, full grown but not aged, and with a very broad face.\u201d\nRemarks on the different species of Orang-utan.\n\nThose Dr. Kneeland refers when he mentions \"the narrow elongated shape of the Orang's pelvis.\"\n\nWe shall now follow the list of admeasurements furnished by Prof. Owen of the adult and young small Chimpanzee and adult and young Orang-utan, and would have cited those given by him of his adult Orang for convenience of comparison, had his specimen been clearly Mias Rambi, as the large skulls are which he has figured; but this is rendered doubtful in a note.\u2020 Another table of comparison by the same naturalist we quote to give the dimensions of the following specimens.\u20141.

S.\n\nOn the 24th Feb. 1830, Mr. Gardiner started in company with Osman Shah, chief of the tribe of Khilzye, (a subdivision of the Hazara tribe Deh Kundi) and his brother, attended by a few followers, from Drohu the residence of the chief, in order to visit the place called \"the buried wealth of Moh\" and certain caves in its neighbourhood.\n\nThey first descended about 2000 feet to the bottom of the valley, crossed the deep and turbid torrent by means of a rope and temporary bridge. Thence the path ascended north, and then north-west to the limit of the snow, crossed a bed of snow rather treacherous to the passenger, and came to a narrow gorge walled in with almost perpendicular rocks, but 15 to 20 feet wide, and lined with perpetual ice, on which no sun ever shines. Down this icy-bed the party let themselves slide as gently as they could in a sitting posture, avoiding an abrupt termination, out of which gushed a new-born torrent. Hence by a rocky path they reached an oval basin or small valley about 900\u20141000 yards long by 6\u2014800 broad; all sides rapidly rising towards the centre which contained a small pool about 100 yards in circumference, the traditional site of Moh's death.\nThis tarn is said to be unfathomable, but the most remarkable circumstance about it, is the bituminous nature of the water and its nauseously bitter taste. It imparts a stinging sensation to the naked skin, apparently similar to that felt from bathing in the Dead Sea. Mr. Gardiner imprudently waded into it, in a vain attempt to sound it, which he failed in doing with a line of 55 fathoms; and he suffered for sometime from the effect of the waters on his skin.\n\nOccasionally balls of fire are said to play over the surface, which is probably owing to the escape of sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The waters, though intensely cold, have the appearance of ebullition, from the continual escape of gas. On one side was a deposit of sulphur.\n\nAlthough fed from a glacier, the pool has no visible outlet, and is said never to change its level, save once during an earthquake when it rose several yards above its banks.\n\nProceeding to the south side of the valley they ascended a mound of loose debris, and found that the earthquake, that had occurred a few days before, had blocked up the mouth of two of the three caverns they went to see. The most westerly of them, however, was still accessible. The entrance, elevated a few feet above the ground on the face of a bluff rock, was nearly concealed by a veil of mossy vegetation fed by springs oozing from the rocks. On further examination, it proved to be of an irregular oval form, about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high by $2\\frac{1}{2}$ broad. There were no marks of artificial labour visible on the rock, which seemed to be porphyritic, dark-red in colour, with black markings, and of extreme hardness. In position it rests on granite, and lies below primitive limestone. The glacis below is formed of a confused mixture of granite, greenstone and limestone.\n\nLighting their torches of split pine, they entered the cave. The first adit, for about 75 feet long, gradually enlarged, (they could only pass in a crouching posture), then it again contracted, but finally opened into an apartment $20 \\times 15$, and eight feet high in the centre.\n\nAt the further end of this room was a rude image in high relief on a smoothed and squared surface, about $4\\frac{1}{2}$ feet high. Two short and thick legs supported a large thick body surmounted by four extended arms, and two heads rising from one thick neck.\n\nOver the head were some emblems which Mr. Gardiner supposed to mean the sun and moon, but which, from the sketch he gives,\nwould rather describe as decrescents, one over the right head and two over the left. In size, the heads would be better suited to a colossus of 10 feet. The ears, eyes, nose and even the fingers were almost worn off. The figure had been originally highly polished; but was now a good deal worn and covered with a green vegetable scum.\n\nThe floor of the cave was level, except in one place, about 3 feet from the idol, where there was a hollow about two yards round. This was the spot where sacrifices used formerly to be made, and even then was found filled with ashes and traces of recent fire.\n\nOn either side at about three yards from the great idol, were two smaller ones, both single-headed and two-armed, but otherwise, in thickness and disproportion, resembling the chief idol.\n\nThe chief idol was said to represent Moh and his wife M\u00e1b\u00fan, formerly the gods of those regions, and even still reverenced by the self-converted Musalm\u00e1ns of the country. No one dares enter the caves with shoes on, and the marks of recent fire show still stronger signs of remaining veneration.\n\nThe other two caves, whose mouths had been lately blocked up, were dedicated\u2014one to Sheh or Seh, the destroyer, the other to Zhei, god of fire.\n\nAbout four miles further on, it is said, that there were two other caves since become inaccessible, dedicated to Hersh and Maul.\n\nAt each new moon a fire-offering is made before the cave of Zhei by some of the Therba tribe, who retain more of paganism than Islam; and these people reckon their time by moons, instead of\n\nDescending to the western limit of the valley, the high cliff for a space of 2 or 300 yards was perforated with small holes, like a rabbit-warren. This was the site of Moh\u2019s treasure. The holes were made by the natives digging for it, and they frequently succeed in finding small beads of gold and stone known by the name of Solyani Dana, or Solomon\u2019s grain. The beads were for the most part jasper, all more or less corroded and dimmed in colour, as if by fire; they were all bored. The golden grains had just the appearance of the little masses of gold which are made by gold-washers from the first melting of their amalgam and gold-dust; about the size of wheat grains.\nThis bank consists of a confused mass of boulders, granite, lime-\nstone, clay-slate and greenstone, all heaped upon a thick stratum of\nsandstone of varying quality, some argillaceous, some ferriferous of\ndeep red colour, and with some traces of lignite, alum earth and iron\npyrites. In this sandstone are the holes where the beads are found.\n\nThere are also found pieces of broken pottery in the neighbour-\nhood and among the debris. Mr. Gardiner concludes that the tan-\nis the crater of an extinct volcano, and that former eruptions with\nearthquakes demolished some ancient place of abode.\n\nThe following is the legend of Moh. Moh created the earth, and\nhis wife M\u00e1b\u00fan created the wilderness. From them sprung the\nfirst giant race. They slept alternately for 999 moons and reigned\n450,000 moons. After this period three sons rebelled, viz. Sheh the\nlife-destroyer, Zhei the fire-god, and Maul the earth-quaker, and by\ntheir combined efforts Moh was buried beneath the mountains. Con-\nfusion lasted 5000 moons\u2014after which the three victors retired each\nto his own region for 10,000 moons.\n\nMaul was lost in darkness of his own creating. Sheh fled with\nhis family towards the sun, which so much enraged Zhei, that he\ncaused fire to spread over the earth; this was quenched by the\nspirit of M\u00e1b\u00fan, but not till the whole giant race was destroyed,\nand the earth remained a desert for 3000 moons. Then Hersh and\nLethram, originally slaves of Moh and great magicians, emerged from\nthe north, and settled in these mountains. By some Lethram is\nconsidered as the incarnate spirit of M\u00e1b\u00fan and the Queen to whom\nHersh was vizier. Hersh had three sons Uz, Muz and All.* These\nhe left in charge of all their families, while with a large army he\ntravelled toward the sun in pursuit of Sheh, who was supposed to be\nstill living.\n\nSo the three sons of Hersh and their descendants reigned happily\nfor 18,000 moons till Khoor (Cyrus?) invaded and conquered the\ncountry; but after many years' struggle they expelled the invaders\nand retained the name Khoorkush (Cyrus-killer), now Khirghiz.\nThe descendants of Hersh continued to reign for 10,000 moons more\ntill Khoondroo (Alexander?) invaded the country, after which no\nseparate legend of them seems to be recollected.\n\n* Whose names seem retained in the Ustagh, Mustagh and Altai mountains.\nContributions to the Statistics of Bengal.\u2014Income, Expenditure and Food.\u2014By J. R. Bedford, Esq. Bengal Medical Staff.\n\nThe relation between income and expenditure existing in any given community, affords a fair index to the soundness of its condition, and general prosperity. If the average rate of labour be such as to provide all able-bodied men and their families with a sufficiency of food, clothing and shelter, it must be conceded that such a population is in the possession of some of the primary, if not most important, elements of happiness, as applicable to a certain stage of civilization.\n\nIt has been, and is, the custom to represent the peasant-inhabitant of Bengal as weighed down by the pressure of land taxation to a point at which he can barely support life. That great suffering occasionally arises from the local deficiency of the staple article of food, must be conceded, but such is due to imperfect means of communication, rather than inability to meet its average cost. So far as my own experience goes, the average income of the Bengal peasantry, by which term I desire to express, small landed proprietors, day-labourers, and the general mass of the people, suffices for the necessary outlay of their position. It is an incontrovertible fact that debt largely prevails, but this would appear to be due rather to the enormous rate of interest which is taken and the comparatively excessive sums lavished on occasional ceremonies, than from any actual necessity, in regard to the necessaries of life.\n\nDesirous of attempting some analysis of the condition of the people, I constructed the following Table when in charge of the Civil Station of Chittagong. The subjects of inquiry were, patients attending the Dispensary. Their ailments were first attended to, and the results tabulated below, obtained by inquiry immediately afterwards, through the zealous assistance of Babu Buddinath Brimo, the Sub-Assistant Surgeon.\n\nThey are not offered as absolute truths. Those who have had practical experience of the great difficulty of making statistical inquiries in Bengal, will fully understand how far they may deviate from correctness. But examining the facts here noted seriatim,\nI think sufficient intrinsic evidence of the\nto confer upon them the character of\nTable comprehends every ordinary item\nthat incurred on account of live-stock, w\nomitted, and the probable amount of which\ned from the balance when in favour.\n\nWith the view of rendering the quest\nmation as clear as possible, it was agree\nembrace the condition of its subjects duri\nonly.\n\n[See Table A.]\n\nThe above Table speaks for itself. To e\nitem of expenditure would be useless lab\nhowever, that according to column 3, ou\nsubjected to examination, seventy-seven v\nnumber only four had more than one wife.\n4 we obtain a total of one hundred and t\n1.57 per marriage. This appears a very sm\nof error is difficult to detect, as all childr\nin the house, must have been included.\n\nThe mean wages of the husbands an\nwhilst those of the wives are 3as. 1p.; Co\nthat whilst by far the largest proportion o\nis spent in rice, dhal is consumed in ve\noutlay on salt exhibits a large figure in\nwas formed with the view of ascertaining\nsufficiency of this important condiment.\nbe expected at a sea-port, is universally\nthe meat, which constitutes a part of the\nmore inland districts.

the entire absence of education, as such may have been paid for in kind. Column 28 exhibits the balance for, or against. When the latter occurs, it is shewn by asterisks, but according to the Table, this unfavourable condition only existed in eight cases out of the hundred.\n\nThe sums contained in this Balance Column, however, it must be remembered are still chargeable with the heavy demands consequent on pujas, Marriage and Burial ceremonies, as well as the possible arrest of debts. It is to be regretted that I did not ascertain the present outlay due to the latter. Putting debt aside, however, which ought to form but an unimportant item in a healthy state of society, the foregoing Table offers a favourable view of the resources, and adaptations of income to expenditure in a native of Bengal.\n\nHaving thus endeavoured to determine the average income and expenditure of one hundred families, who may be regarded as types of the great mass of the inhabitants of Bengal, it became a point of interest to ascertain the actual quantity and quality of food consumed daily by the same class. No opportunity for effecting this inquiry occurred during my subsequent stay at Chittagong. As soon as I became sufficiently acquainted with Rajeshye, however, I put it in operation. Forms of inquiry regarding the separate daily consumption of food of twenty men were accordingly placed in the hands of Daroghas attached to the same number of separate Thannahs of Rajeshye. These were accompanied by full instructions to the effect that twenty inhabitants of the nearest village should be individually separately questioned as to the amount and kind of food daily consumed by each. On my receipt of these detailed tables the totals for every five men were tabulated as below, and from their total again the mean quantity was computed. The fact of six returns, made by as many separate inquiries, differing so little from each other in mean results, and approximating so closely to the table obtained by myself, on which I bestowed considerable care, gives them a claim to reliability which in the absence of such checks they would have failed to possess.\n### Table B\n\n**Table showing the average quantity of food consumed by adult men in Zillah Rajshahiye, in the Month of March, 1852.**\n\n| Total quantity and kind of food consumed daily by Hindu Ryots. |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Riyo** | **Dhal** | **Pitha** | **Meat** | **Spice** | **Vegetable** | **Milk** | **Total** |\n|----------|----------|-----------|----------|-----------|--------------|---------|----------|\n| 3        | 4        | 5         | 6        | 7         | 8            | 9       | 10       |\n| 11       | 12       |           |          |           |              |         |          |\n\n- **Bauleh**\n- **Tamura**\n- **Bhabaneegeunge**\n- **Godagre**\n- **Ghatee Siril**\n- **Do.

It is probable therefore that the results above shewn, exhibit the maximum of food consumed by the labouring population of Bengal. By comparing the two sets of tables, it will be seen that the mean daily quantity indicated by the 4 tables containing the results of the Darogahs' inquiries exceeds that obtained by my own. The former amounts to 1 seer, 12 chittaks, and 3 kachas, kutcha weight, which is equivalent to 1 seer, 5 chittaks, and 2 kachas pucka weight, or about 43 oz. English, whilst the latter is 1 seer, 6 chittaks, 2 kachas, kutcha, equivalent to 1 seer, 3 kachas pucka weight, or about 34 oz. English.\n\nWith the view of testing what quantity a man could possibly consume at one time, I directed five coolies working in my compound to obtain whatever they pleased for the morning meal. The supply was brought and carefully weighed in my presence, before and after cooking, with the following results, and was subsequently eaten before me.\n\n**Table H.**\n\n*Shewing the quantity of Food consumed at their morning meal by five Moorulman Coolies, April 3d, 1852, in kutcha weight seers, chittakes and kachas.*\n\n| Articles       | Weight before Cooking | Weight after Cooking | Price |\n|----------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-------|\n| Rice           | 3 2 0 10 2 0 0 1 3    |                      |       |\n| Dhall          | 0 8 0 2 12 0 0 0 3    |                      |       |\n| Salt           | 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 3     |                      |       |\n| Fish           | 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 6     |                      |       |\n| Vegetables     | 0 6 0 1 7 0 0 0 3     |                      |       |\n| Spice          | 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 1     |                      |       |\n| Oil            | 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 0 3     |                      |       |\n| Dhyo           | 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6     |                      |       |\n| **Total,**     | **5 10 3 15 12 3 0 3 4** |                      |       |\n| Evening meal said to be \u00bd of above, | 3 14 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 | | |\n| **Grand Total,** | **9 8 8 0 0 0 0 6 1** | | |\n| **Mean,**      | **1 15 0 0 0 0 0 1 2** | | |\nTaking the mean of all the above Tables then, it may thus be pretty safely admitted, that the adult male population of Rajshahye consumes about 1 seer, 8 chittaks of food per man per day, which amounts in English weight to about 38 oz.\n\nComparing the quantity with that consumed in England, it will be seen that the Bengal peasant of this district and time, labours under no comparative disadvantage.\n\nIn the Report of the Commissioners for inquiring into the administration and operation of the Poor Laws (1834) Mr. Chadwick gives the following statement of the average consumption of solid food per week by different classes.\n\nAn independent labourer, .......... 122 oz. per week.\nA soldier, ......................... 163 ,, ,, ,, \nAn able-bodied pauper, .......... 151 ,, ,, ,, \n\nNow taking the mean of the above Tables, we get a daily allowance of 1 seer, 3 chittaks, or about 266 oz. per week, for the Rajeshye peasant.\n\nSo much for the quantity, but taking quality also into our consideration it will again be found in a perusal of the following extract from Mr. Senior\u2019s \u201cStatement of the provision for the poor, and of the condition of the labouring classes in a considerable portion of America and Europe,\u201d that the Bengal peasant stands in a very favourable position in that respect also.\n\n\u201cQuantity of food used by an agricultural labourer having a wife and four children.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica, New York.\u2014Tea, coffee, meat, twice a-day.

That many and various social evils yet exist cannot be doubted, but want of means to\nprocure a sufficiency of food for the retention of life and health would not appear to be one of them, except in\nspecial famine years, and so far Bengal may be considered to exhibit as small an average deficiency of the comforts\nof life, as any modern nation.\n\n[No. 4.]\nIn a preface to the Catalogue des Manuscrits et Xylographes Orientaux contained in the Imperial Public Library of St. Petersburg, a copy of which was lately presented to our Society by the Directors of that Institution, the compiler has sketched the progress of the collection, the foundation of which was laid after the capture of Warsaw by the Russians, in 1795. The celebrated Zalusky Library was then carried to St. Petersburg, and to this nucleus was added, in 1805, a number of MSS. collected by Doubrowsky, an employ\u00e9 in the foreign office who had made the most, apparently, of the opportunities which fell in his way during the revolutionary wars, and had gathered a \"riche moisson\" which he subsequently presented to the Emperor Alexander. In 1813, however, the Oriental Department of this Institution could only produce 183 MSS. The bulk of the present collection is formed of the spoils of Turkey and Persia. The Ard\u00e9bil Mosque containing the Ss\u00e9fy Mausoleum and mentioned by Morier, furnished 166 vols. to the Russian General Suchtelen in 1828, and the Ahmed Mosque of Akhaltisk, containing 148 Turkish and Arabic works, gave up its Library to Pask\u00e9vitch in 1829.\n\nThe present collection consists of the following MSS.\n\n| Language   | Number |\n|------------|--------|\n| Arabic     | 247    |\n| Persian    | 255    |\n| Turkish    | 100    |\n| Hebrew     | 6      |\n| Ethiopian  | 9      |\n| Syriac     | 5      |\n| Coptic     | 8      |\n| Armenian   | 11     |\n| Georgian   | 15     |\n| Mantchoo   | 35     |\n| Chinese    | 151    |\n| Mongol     | 5      |\n| Tibetan    | 10     |\n| Japanese   | 14     |\n| Sanskrit   | 8      |\n| Pali       |         |\n| Goojeratee |         |\n| Hindce     |         |\n| Bengali    |         |\n| Calmuc     |         |\n| Malayalam  |         |\n| Tamul      |         |\n| Siamese    |         |\n| Javanese   |         |\n\nAs was to be expected its riches consist mainly in Arabic, Persian and Turkish works. The Chinese department too obtained some valuable acquisitions from Kamensky when at the head of the Russian Mission which visited Pekin in 1823. In Indian MSS. the Library is lamentably poor, the solitary specimen being in one or two cases the publication of some Mission Press.\n\nThe Catalogue is in French, and of a raisonn\u00e9 character. The typography is most creditable to the Press maintained at the Imperial Academy of Sciences. Not more than 300 copies have been\nprinted, the work being intended only for distribution among Scientific Institutions and eminent orientalists. The descriptions of the Turkish, Arabic and Persian MSS. which compose the bulk of the volume are by Dorn; they are very complete, embracing the notices given of the Ard\u00e9bil and Akhaltsik MSS. by Fr\u00e4hn in 1829 and 1830. The Indian MSS. were all taken to London for examination, and the notices of these are by a young German Doctor, Reinhold Rost.\n\nThe Qur\u00e1n alsa\u2019dayn, a Dilly periodical in Hindustany, announces the publication at Dilly, of the first volume of a Persian Dictionary which has the title \u1e25\u0101l\u0101t b\u0101b\u0101; it comprises 817 pages of 28 lines. The author of this important work is T\u0113k Chand, whose takhalluq was Bah\u00e1r\u2014a Khatry of Dilly. He flourished in the second half of the last century, after he had completed the first copy of his work, continued his lexicographical labours and made numerous additions and improvements, and found himself compelled to write out a second copy, but even here his lexicographical researches did not stop. He made successively seven copies or editions of his work, of which the last is of course the most perfect. At the time of his death the autograph of the seventh edition was in the hands of one of his pupils, whose name is Inderman, and he made an abridgment of it, and it is this abridgment which is now generally known in India as the Bah\u0101r-e \u2019ajam, and is considered the best Persian Dictionary that exists. Yet it is only the shadow of the work of which now the first volume has been published. T\u0113k Chand had critically studied the whole Persian literature, and had travelled in Persia in order to make himself fully master of the Persian language and its dialects. The spoken language of Persia is simple enough, and so are some of their prose writers. To understand these writers, or the \u2019urf of the language, almost any dictionary is sufficient, but in their great poets there occur many verses which are perfectly unintelligible, and though the copies of their works agree generally very well, you find almost in every copy a different reading. We have very few ancient commentaries on Persian poets (the only very valuable books on this subject are the \u062c\u0648\u0647\u0631\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0631 by Adzory, and Ab\u00fa-l-Hasan\u2019s commentary on Anwary, few other commentaries known in India have much critical value), and it is therefore only\nby very extensive and critical reading that these difficulties can be cleared up. They consist, sometimes in allusions which have become hackneyed among poets, like \u0646\u0639\u0644 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u062a\u0634; sometimes in the use of rare and obsolete words, and sometimes in the use of strange idioms. All doubt on these subjects can only be removed when we have critical editions of the principal Persian authors; in the mean time however the Bah\u00e1r Dictionary is, by far, the most valuable book of reference on these points, because, as the term \u0645\u0647\u0627\u0631\u06cc in the title implies, it is expressly designed to meet these difficulties, and his immense reading and intercourse with the most learned Persian scholars both in India and Persia, enabled him to collect and make bear on the difficulties a number of passages from classical Persian authors. For a European lexicographer this Dictionary will not only be valuable in furnishing him with explanations which he finds nowhere else, but, what is much more valuable, it enables him to strike out many absurd meanings, which are given to words in Richardson and even in the Burh\u00e1ne Q\u00e1t\u00ed, and which rest on misunderstood passages of poets.\n\nVery few Sanskrita works have appeared since we last had occasion to advert to the publications of the native press of Calcutta. Pandita Ananda Chandra Ved\u00e1ntav\u00e1g\u00edna of the Tattwabodhini Society has lately published some of the standard works of the Ved\u00e1nta system of philosophy, and among them we find excellent editions in the Bengali character of the Ved\u00e1ntas\u00e1ra of Sad\u00e1nanda, with the commentaries of Nrisi\u0144ha Saraswati and R\u00e1mat\u00edrtha Yati, and of the Panchadasi, or the Fifteen Chapters on the Principles of the Ved\u00e1nta, by Vidy\u00e1ranaya, with the commentary of R\u00e1makrishna. The learned Pandita is now engaged in carrying through the press, the Adhikara-sam\u00e1dhi of Bh\u00e1rat\u00ed Tirtha with a commentary: the work is to appear in monthly parts, and seven fasciculi have been already published.\n\nThe new edition of the Raghu Va\u0144\u015ba, which was adverted to some time ago, has just issued from the Sanskrita Press of Calcutta.\n\nOf Bengali works we have to record,\n\n1. \u09ac\u09be\u09b9\u09cd\u09af-\u09ac\u0995\u09cd\u09a4\u09c3\u09a4 \u09ae\u09b9\u09bf\u09b2\u09be \u09ae\u09be\u09a8\u09ac-\u09aa\u09cd\u09b0\u0995\u09c3\u09a4\u09bf\u09b0 \u09b8\u09ae\u09cd\u09ac\u09a8\u09cd\u09a7-\u09ac\u09bf\u099a\u09be\u09b0; or the Relation of the Mind to external objects. By B\u00e1b\u00fa Akshayakum\u00e1ra Datta. Tatwabodhini Press, 1852-3, 2 vols. 12mo. Besides two original essays, these volumes include a reprint of a series of papers published under\nthe above title in the Tattwabodhini Patrik\u00e1, the organ of the Calcutta Ved\u00e1ntists. The author has taken Combe's Constitution of Man for his guide, and most ably advocated the opinions of those who maintain that the best food of man is derived from the vegetable kingdom. The style of writing is remarkably pure and elegant, and affords an excellent instance of the facility with which Sanskrita vocables may be introduced into Beng\u00e1li to the utter exclusion of all foreign elements, which constitute so material a portion of the Indian vernaculars.\n\n2. Lamb's Tales of Shakespeare, translated into Beng\u00e1li by B\u00e1bu Udayachandra Addya, Purnachandrodaya Press, 1853, 1 vol. 8vo. Another version of these tales is, we are informed, now in the press, and will, ere long, be published by the Vernacular Literature Committee.\n\n3.

The work includes notices of nearly three hundred Vaishnava saints, and abounds in a variety of insipid and extravagant legends. \"Exercises,\" says Professor Wilson, \"a powerful influence in Upper India on popular belief, and holds a similar place in the superstitions of this country, as that which was occupied in the dark ages of the Roman Catholic faith by the Golden Legend and Acts of the Saints.\"\n\n4. Macaulay's Life of Lord Clive, translated into Beng\u00e1li by B\u00e1bu Harachandra Datta, and published by the Vernacular Literature Committee, Calcutta, 1852, 8vo. This work has been very well received by the Hindu community, and, it is said, a second edition will be published immediately.\n\n5. An Essay on the Sanskrit language and literature; by Pandit Isvarachandra Vidy\u00e1s\u00e9gara, read at a meeting of the Bethune Society on the 13th of April, 1853.\u2014Sanskrita Press, 1853.\n\nAs a writer the Pandit has a happy facility in expressing his meaning with perspicuity in the simplest and most polished language. Clearness, indeed, is the leading character of his composition, which is a fair specimen of the best prose of the Bengal vernacular. His remarks on the Sanskrita poets are generally very judicious.\n\nThe Essay is a laudable attempt to raise the Beng\u00e1li to be an instrument of literary criticism\u2014a task of which the writer more than once owns the difficulty.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR MAY, 1853.\n\nThe Society met on the 4th instant at the usual hour.\n\nSir James Colville, Knight, President, in the Chair.\n\nThe proceedings of the last monthly meeting were read and confirmed.\n\nThe presentation, by Lieut.

W. Colville.\n\nReport of Curator, Zoological Department.\n\nSir,\u2014In the present Report, I have found it convenient to combine several unpublished Reports, and thus to notice under single headings the various successive donations for which we are indebted to Capt. Sherwill, Capt. Berdmore, Dr. Kelaart and others.\nCapt. W. S. Sherwill. An extensive collection of sundries from Darjiling, consisting of skins of mammalia and birds, and numerous entire specimens of small mammalia, birds, and reptiles, taken out of spirit and transmitted in closed tins; an excellent mode of forwarding moist specimens to great distances, which originated with Capt. Thos. Hutton of Masuri: also some interesting species of land-shells.\n\nOf mammalia, are sent entire specimens of *Hippodereos armiger*, Hodgson (distinct from *H. nobilis*), *Rhinolophus Pearsonii*, Horsfield,* *Lasiurus Pearsonii*, Horsf., *Scotophilus fuliginosus*, Hodgson, *Plecotus auritus* P (in bad condition), and skin of *Rhinolophus berniger* (Luctus?)-*Sorex nemorivagus*, Hodgson (found also in Sylhet and Arakan), and *Corsica nigrescens*, Gray (*v. Sorex soccatus*, Hodgson),\u2014*Neodon simimensis*, Hodgson, and a Mus affinis to *M. flavescens*, and another which seems to accord with *M. dubius*, Hodgson.\n\nThe only bird new to the museum is *Yuhina nigrimenta*, Hodgson (a fine pair); and there is also a much finer specimen than we possessed previously of *Alcedo erythrona*, Temminck (of which species *A. griseis*, nobis, from Darjiling, represents the adult, and *A. nigricans*, nobis, from Malacca, appears to be merely the young). An example of *Parus rubidiventris*, nobis, occurs, confirming that species, of which we had previously seen but one specimen. Capt. Sherwill has also favoured us with a fine skeleton of *Neophron percnopterus*.\n\nOf reptiles, he has sent *Calotes tricarinatus*, *n. s.* (young), *Mocoa simimensis*, *n. s.*\u2014*Calamaria fusca*, *n. s.*, *C. tenuiceps*, *n. s.*, *Coluber radiatus*, *C. korros*, *C. fasciolatus*,\u2014*C. nigromarginatus*, *n. s.*,\u2014*Vipas macrodon*, *n. s.*, D. Sherwilli, *n. s.*, *Dendrus nasutus*, *Boidonotus gracilis*, *n. s.*, *Bungarus candidus*, *Vipera (?) simi*.\n\n* Very distinct from *Rh. tragatus*, Hodgson. To Dr. Horsfield's description of it may be added that the lower lip has but one medial groove; whereas in *Rh. tragatus* the lower lip is conspicuously divided by three grooves into two medial and two lateral lappets, the former more narrow and elongated than the latter. The same structure recur in *Rh. affinis*, Horsfield (*apud nos*), from Ceylon; the species which, in the Society's collection, most approximates *Rh. tragatus* in structure. *Rh. mitratus*, nobis, appears to have but one groove on the lower lip, so far as can be judged from stuffed specimens the lips of which had been relaxed by moisture; and this species is well and strongly distinguished by the much greater comparative development of the raised nasal follicle, and also the much greater lateral expansion of the vertical projection above it.\nmensis, n. s.,\u2014Megalophrys gigas, n. s., (\"edible frog\" of Sikim), Bombinator sikimmensis, n. s., and other species of anourous Batrachia.\n\nOf fishes, one small Cyprin.\n\n2. W. Theobald, Esq., Panjab Salt Range Survey, Pind D\u00e1dan Khan. Various small animals taken out of spirit, and sent down moist in a tin canister. Of Bats are sent Rhinopoma Hardwickei, (Gray), upwards of 270 individuals of which species were caught in one day at a place called Bhera, near Pind D\u00e1dan Khan;\u2014also Dysopus plicatus, (B. Ham.) ;\u2014Scotophilus coromandelianus, (F. Cuv.) ; and\n\nHippodereos cineraceus, nobis, n. s. Similar to H. murinus, (Elliot), in structure, but larger and of a different colour. The entire under-parts are greyish-white; and the basal three-fourths of the piles of the upper fur are the same, the terminal fourth being of a dusky grey, but shewing the whitish hue beneath, especially on the head and neck. Length of forearm 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) in.; of ear posteriorly \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.\n\nAn apparently new Mouse may be designated\n\nMus gerbillinus, nobis. Entire length of male 5 in., of which the tail is 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. Tarsus with toes and claws, \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in.; ear-conch (anteally) barely \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. Female rather smaller. Fur of mean length, of a sandy-brown colour on the upper-parts, white below and on the limbs, which latter have a faint tinge of the colour of the back. About twenty-five caudal vertebrae. Tail thinly clad with minute set\u00e6.\n\nOf reptiles, are sent\u2014Monitor deacana, juv.,\u2014Hemidactylus coctei,\u2014Gymnodactylus geckoides, Spix (Stenodactylus scaber, R\u00fcppell*), Charasia dobesalis, Gray,\u2014Uromastyx Hardwickei, Gray,\u2014and two specimens of Cabrita leschenaultii, (D. and B.),\u2014also Vipera echis, Ind. var., of which Mr. Theobald writes\u2014\"This Viper is very common here in rocky places under the hills. It and an almost hoodless Cobra are the only poisonous snakes I have seen. The Viper is rarely of any size, the largest examined measuring\u2014body 10\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in., tail 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) in. = 12 in. It was well gorged with a large grasshopper. Forced to bite a fowl on each leg, no effect became visible for fifteen or twenty minutes; after which a lethargy came on very gradually, and in an hour the fowl was unable to stand, but did not die till two hours after the bite. The fowl seemed to derive much benefit by being dashed with cold water. Among the Lizards, the most curious is the herbivorous one (Uromastyx Hardwickii). It is eaten up here, and is I believe esteemed as an aphro-\n\n* Perhaps a distinct species, though very closely affined. It is of a greyish colour, spotted rather than banded above with blotches of a darker hue, variegated by some of the tubercles being of a whitish colour.\ndisiac. These Lizards make burrows in sandy and stony places to the depth of 2 ft. or more. There are always several in one place, like the burrows of Rabbits. They are not much out in the cold weather, but in the hot weather are seen roaming about near their burrows, morning and evening. They appear as the sun is getting up, and stay grazing near the holes till almost mid-day, and are out also in the evening. Towards dusk they retire, and carefully close the holes with sand, so that it is not easy to find them. They offer no resistance when caught.\"\n\n3. From E. F. Kelaart, Esq., M. D., Ceylon Medical Service. A fine collection of Cinghalese reptiles chiefly, in spirit, comprising several species new to the Society's museum. The species now sent are *Emyda punctata* (head and limbs of a large specimen),\u2014*Monitor dracena*, *Hydrosaurus salvator*,\u2014*Hemidactylus triedrus*, H. Pibesii, Kelaart, H. Coctei, H. frenatus, Boltalia sublevis, Piripia Peronii, and *Gymnodactylus timoriensis*? (*G. Kandianus*, Kelaart),\u2014*Lybiophalus scutatus*, *Salra Jerdoni* (from Newera Elia), *Calotes Rouxi*? (from do.; C. mystaceus, agreeing with Burmese specimens, having before been sent from that locality), C. vebsicoloe, C. ophiomachus (one example not differing from the others in structure, having a black-edged white streak extending on each side from the neck to the coloured part of the tail, on which latter it breaks into spots and disappears), *Sitana ponticelliana*,\u2014*Tiliqua rufescens*, *Riopa Hardwickei*,\u2014*Argyrophis braminus*, *Uropeltis* (apparently a new species, of which examples have been sent to the Chatham museum, where they will probably have been described by Dr. A. Smith),\u2014*Calamaria scytale*, *Xenodon purpurascens*, *Coluber korbos*, *Leptophis ornatus*\u2014(var., of a clay-brown colour, the upperparts marked throughout with a series of black transverse bands, the head marked as usual), *Drynus nasutus*, *Vipera Russellii*, *Trigonocephalus nigromarginatus* (specimen 27\u00bd in. long, with the black markings much more developed than in Dr. Schlegel's figure),\u2014*Ichthyophis glutinosus*,\u2014*Polypedates cruciger*, P. leucomystax, *Lymnodytes lividus*, n. s., L. macularius, n. s., *Rana Leschenaultii*?, R. robusta, n. s., *Pyxicephalus fodiens*, Jerdon, *Engystoma rubrum*, Jerdon, and *Bufo melanostictus*.\n\n4. From Capt. Berdmore, Mergui. A large collection of sundries in spirit, and also various skins. The mammalia sent are *Galopithecus volans*, *Pteropus javanicus*, *Cynopterus marginatus*, *Nycticeius Temminckii*, *Scotophilus coromandelianus*, *Felis bengalensis*, *Paradoxurus typus*, P. leucotis (vide Horsfield's *Catul.*), *Tupaia ferru-\nGinea (var. Belangeri), Sorex serpentinus, Sciurus chrysonotus (dark var.), Mus (vide XXI, 433*), and Tragulus Kanchil.\n\nOf the birds, the most worthy of notice are Gecinus dimidiatus, Lyncornis cerviniceps, Corvus splendens (unknown in Arakan, save of late years partially to the northward, and of the dark variety inhabiting also Ceylon), Calornis cantor (nec Columbinus, v. affinis, nobis, of Arakan), Munia rubronigra (having less black on the belly than in Bengal specimens, while some which we have seen from Penang want it altogether), Pycnonotus jocosus (similar to Penang specimens, in which the crimson ear-tuft is constantly shorter and of a more intense crimson than in Indian specimens, and this bird is unknown in Arakan), Carpodectes bicolor, Argus giganteus, Ardea sumatrana (A. rectirostris, Gould),\u2020 and Casarca leucoptera, nobis.\n\nOf reptiles, skins of Empagusia flavescens and Hydrobaenus salvator; and examples in spirit of Gecko verus (triple-tailed), Boltalia sublevis, Pipipia Peronii, and Leiurus Berdmorei, n. s.,\u2014Draco maculatus, Acanthosaura armata, Calotes rhoma,\u2014Aspis Berdmorei, n. s., Riepa albopunctata,\u2014Xenopeltis unicolor, Python reticulatus, Lycodon aulicus, Leptophis pictus, L. ornatus, L. rufescens (Dipsas rufescens, Gray, Hardw. Ill. Ind. Zool.) Coluber radiatus, C. fasciolatus, Tropidonotus umbratus (2 var.), Tr. stolatus, Tr. zebrinus, n. s., Homolopsis plumbea, Bungarus fasciatus, B. candidus, Naia tripudians,\u2014Polypedates leucomystax, Lymnodytes erythreus (Schl.), Rana assimilis (XXI, 355), R. (young of several species), Engystoma (affined to E. malabaricum, Jerdon), Hyladacty-\n\n* In a male sent, the lower parts are white as in M. flavescens, in a female brown, like the upper parts.\n\n\u2020 Upon examination of a fine collection of Australian birds from the Port Philip district, and comparing certain of them with specimens in the Society's museum, we found that Oreocinclla lunulata, (Lath.), seems to be identical with O. nilgiriensis, nobis, of the mountains of S. India (No. 930 of catalogue); though Gould's figures of it are more like the Asiatic O. dauma, (Lath., v. Whitei, Eyton). A single Australian male of Synicus chinensis is considerably deeper-coloured than any Indian or Malayan example examined, with the black markings more developed on the back, and scarcely a trace of rufous on the wings; but this would seem to be merely an individual variety. Of two Sittellae, otherwise similar, one has the crown and cheeks fuscous, with pale supercilia; the other has the entire head dull white with faint dark stripe. They seem to be varieties merely of S. chrysoptera, and Gould's S. leuccephala from Pt. Essington and Morton Bay respectively are probably but analogous varieties.\nlus (affined to H. montanus, Jerdon), and Bufo melanostictus (?), var.?\u2014having the skin much less warty than usual, especially on the sides of the body and under-parts generally, which last are throughout speckled with black.\n\nLikewise a small Goby (Periophthalmus); a crustacean affined to Homarus; specimens of a Thelphusa Crab, imbedded in hard desiccated mud (as if fossilized); and many sundries.\n\nCalotes Emma, Gray. Affined to Acanthosaura, Gray, not only by the pit anterior to the shoulder being more strongly developed than in C. mystaceus and C. rouxi, and black internally, as in Ac. armata, but by the greater elevation of the orbit, which however is less than in Acanthosaura, though it bears a similar spine posteriorly. The scales, however, are those of typical Calotes, but less obliquely disposed; and they are but very slightly keeled. A series of spines above the tympanum, each having one longer than the rest, and that of the anterior series longest, exceeding the orbital spine. A nuchal crest of moderately elevated spines, but the back is simply keeled. Longest hind-toe reaching to the eye. Length 13 in., of which the tail measures 8\u00bd in. Colour brown, variegated with darker brown and with pale brown. A black line passes through the eye to the ear, commencing a little behind the nostrils, and there are four black orbital rays above and two below it. Sides of the face speckled with black, and the head and throat are more or less suffused with ruddy, indicative of the male sex in breeding condition.*\n\n* This species agrees so well in structure with Mr. Gray's description, that there can be little hesitation in identifying it. He states it, however, to be from Afghanistan, as also two other new species, his C. minor and C. maria, both of which latter he gives from Afghanistan and the Kh\u00e1sya hills. Now the late Dr. Griffith collected extensively in both regions, and transmitted all his specimens to the India House; and we find that those described by Mr. Gray were presented to the British Museum by the Hon'ble E. I. Company. It therefore follows, as extremely probable, that Dr. Griffith's Afghan and Kh\u00e1sya specimens had become mixed and confused; whilst it is most improbable that the same species should inhabit both the Kh\u00e1syas and Afghanistan and not be observed elsewhere, and it is equally improbable that so many as four species of the tropical genus Calotes (besides also the affined Salea Horsfieldi, Gray,) should inhabit Afghanistan, the common C. versicolor being also noted from thence by Mr. Gray. Again, the affinities of the Burmese C. emma here described are with the Burmese and Cinghalese C. mystaceus and C. rouxi, and with the Burmese and Malayan Acanthosaura; and these Burmese forms and species may well extend up to the Kh\u00e1syas, but are most unlikely to occur in Afghanistan. C. maria has also the\n5. From Capt. T. Sparkes, Ramri. The two rami of the lower jaw of the Whale (or Rorqual, *Balaenoptera*), which was stranded last year upon Juggoo or Amherst Island, (S. of Ramri island,) as noticed in XXI, 359; but they prove to be larger by one-half than Capt. Sparkes had supposed, measuring 21 ft. in length, minus an inch or two. This magnificent specimen is now fixed up in the museum, as experience has shown that such bones cannot, in this country, be permanently exposed to the weather with impunity.* The length of the left radius of this Rorqual measures 37 in.; the body of a sacral vertebra is 15 in. deep, by 16 in. broad, and nearly 14 in. in extreme length. A lumbar vertebra is somewhat smaller, with spinal apophyses measuring 27 in.; expanse of lateral apophyses, from tip to tip, 40 in.; and extreme height of the tip of the dorsal apophysis from the ground, 37 or 38 in.\n\n6. From Mr. W. W. Nicholls, Sarawak. The nearly perfect skeleton of an adult wild Orang-utan, of the peculiar species indicated by Sir J. Brooke by the name *Mias Pappan*. In a memoir founded upon this and other specimens, the existence of four distinct specific types of the genus Orang-utan is rendered extremely probable, if not absolutely proved; and our museum contains adult female skeletons of three of these species, and skulls of adults of both sexes of the fourth species.\n\n7. Dr. Fayrer, attached to the Hospital Staff, Rangoon. Several specimens of a Bat, *Taphozous longimanus*, (Hardwicke), the only two adult males having a strong rufous tinge. Also an example of *Sciurus lokroides*, Hodgson, var., with no decided rufous tinge on the back. Of birds, *Athene cuculoides*, (Vigors), and some others of common occurrence. Of reptiles, *Gecko verus*\u2014*Calotes mystaceus*\u2014*C. versicolor*\u2014and *Bungarus fasciatus*.\n\n8. From Lieut. Hitchison, I. N., of the 'Mozuffer' S. V. Three small specimens of a Water Snake, of the supposed variety of *Homolopsis leucobalia* described by Dr. Cantor, and which is *Hipsirina Hardwickii*, Gray, of Hardwicke's 'Illustrations.'\n\n9. Walter Elliot, Esq., Madras C. S. Two skins of *Hystrix hirsutirostris*, Brandt (*H. leucura*, Sykes), from Vizagapatam; obligingly sent for comparison with examples from other parts of the country.\n\nshoulder-pit but not the orbital spine, and *C. minor* the orbital spine but not the shoulder pit, which are combined in *C. emma*; while the pit before the shoulder occurs in *C. mystaceus* and *C. rouxi* of Burma and Ceylon, and also in two species of S. India obtained by Mr. Jerdon.\n\n* A varnish might, however, be tried with probable advantage.\n10. Mr. E. Wellend, of the Sailor's Home. A fine specimen of the 'Wattle-bird' of N. Zealand, *Calligras cinerea*, (Forster).\n\n11. Capt. R. Tytler, 38th Light Infantry. Some bird-skins from Dacca, including perhaps a new *Cisticola*, not uncommon in that vicinity; also *Malacopteron abbotti*, nobis, there far from rare, though previously known only from the Burmese provinces. Capt. Tytler remarks that *Scurus palmarum*, so extremely common about Calcutta, is replaced at Dacca by *Sc. lokroides*, Hodgson (a skin of which is sent); and among the common birds, *Megalaima linhata* similarly replaces *M. asiatica*, and *Micropternus phaiocercus* replaces *Brachypternus aurantius*, &c. The skin of a Pelican shot near Dacca, is that of the true *P. onocrotalus*, L., of which we never before saw an Indian specimen. A Hare supposed by Capt. Tytler, to be distinct, appears to be the common *Lepus ruficaudatus* of all Lower Bengal; but *L. hispidus* he described to be also there not uncommon.\n\n12. H. W. Bennet, Esq. The body of a young *Ureus malayanus*.\n\n13. C. Chapman, Esq., C. S. Skin of a melanoid *Cervus axis*, L., procured in Mymunseng. General colour very dark brown, paler below, and nigrescent along the spine; the ordinary spots barely traceable. In this phase of colouring, the species illustrates the *Cervus nudipalpebra*. Ogilby, P. Z. S. 1831, p. 136; founded on a specimen in the museum of the Zoological Society.\n\n14. A. Campbell, Esq., Darjiling. Skin of a female *Cervus Wallichii*, in addition to the male presented on a former occasion;\u2020 and also two skins of a small Jackal-like animal from Tibet, the *Vulpes ferrilatus*, Hodgson.\n\n* Quite distinct from the common *C. cursitans*, (Franklin,) an example of which also is sent in breeding phase of plumage, wherein the pale lateral margins to the coronal feathers have all but disappeared, leaving the crown streakless blackish-brown: but it closely approximates *C. erythrocephala*, Jerdon, nobis, J. A. S. XX., 523, from which it differs in having the crown, breast and flanks, and lower tail-coverts, of a subdued white or dull yellowish-white faintly tinged with rufous, instead of being deep ferruginous,\u2014and there is no rufous tinge on the upper-parts except very faintly on the rump and upper tail-coverts. In both the tail is much less deeply graduated than in *C. cursitans*, and of a dusky or blackish hue, with only an exceedingly slight pale edge at tip. Of several specimens procured, all were quite similar.\n\n\u2020 Here may be mentioned, that we have just seen a superb pair of *Wapiti* antlers, which much exceed in size the finest yet obtained of those of the *Shou*, and have the crowns further subdivided.\n15. From Raja Radakhant Deb. A Shark taken in the river.\n16. Mr. Andrew DeCruz. A fresh specimen of *Viverricula malaccensis*.\n17. Thos. Briden, of the 'Rose of Sharon' merchant vessel. Skeletons of two species of Albatross.\n18. O. Toogood, Esq., C. S. A dead Turtle, *Chelonia virgata*.\n19. A. Grote, Esq., Joint Secretary of the Society. Two skins of *Corydon sumatranaus*.\n20. Babu Rajendra Malika. Dead specimens of a S. African Monkey (*Cercopithecus pygerythrus*); and of a Lark, from middle Asia, *Melanocorypha calandra* (*M. torquata*, nobis, passim).\n21. F. Skipwith, Esq., C. S. Four skins of *Hippodideros larvatus*, \u2014one of *Nycticejus luteus*, a hill specimen of *Talpa leucura*,\u2014two skins of *Turtur orientalis*,\u2014and, in spirit, a young *Tropidonotus argyrophis braminus*, specimens of *Polypedates leucomystax*, var., and of *Rhicophorus reinwardtii* (?), D. and B., or a closely affined species.\n22. B. Heritage, Esq. Skin of *Diomedea exulans*.\n23. J. Payter, Esq. An albinoid specimen of *Mus flavescens*.\n24. Alex. Mitchell, Esq. A collection of British specimens in various classes. Among the skins of mammalia and birds, a few may be selected for our museum, but we were previously well supplied with all the species sent. The same remark applies to the reptiles in spirit, consisting of a Viper and some Newts. Of British fishes in spirit, Mr. A. Kerr has contributed three specimens of *Callyonymus lyra*, three of *Mur\u00e9noides guttata*; and from the Montrose museum, we have received a specimen of *Raniceps trifurcatus*, and one of *Ammodytes tobianus*. Also skins of *Cottus bubalis*, *Aspidophorus europaeus*, *Salmo trutta*, two of *S. fario*, *Ammodytes lancea*, and a fine skin of the Sun-fish, *Orthogoniscus mola*,\u2014the whole of which are exceedingly acceptable. Mr. Mitchell has further enriched our museum with a fine collection of British shells, comprising several species which we did not previously possess; and with 109 species of insects named, collected in the county of Forfarshire. Also with two large specimens of the remarkable northern crab, *Lithodes arctica*.\n25. From T. C. Jerdon, Esq., Mhow. A collection of reptiles and small fresh-water fishes from S. India; also a skin of *Malacocercus somervillei*, Sykes (verus). The reptiles are *Lycodon aulicus*, *Xenodon purpurascens*, *Coluber pictus* (Russell, I, pl. 29*), *Herpetodryas ma*.\n\n* A true Coluber, not *Lycodon baliodera*, as suggested by Dr. Cantor.\nLABARICUS, Jerdon, n. s., and NAIA TRIPUDIENS. The fishes have not yet been minutely examined.\n\nE.

W. of Indus and Gilgit.\n\nThe 1st or most northerly is the valley of Pinghit or Ustikhan or Zairauneh, where the E. branch of the Kanka rises.\n\n2. The Spung valley, an easterly continuation of the last; in it is the Spung lake and source of Ankahoo.\n\n3. The large Peeloo valley.\n\n4. The Ashnoog, S. E., and divided from the East by the Anaushoog mountains.\n\nTo the south of these valleys lies the Peeloo range, whose name however varies in different parts of its length. Most north-westerly it is called Pingut, then Spung or Makoo, then Peeloo, and the easterly portion Meil Ho or Anaushoog S. E. of that Hunzye, and further on Khangram or Bulti, sinking away into the Oskardo hills.\nTo the north, these valleys are bounded by the Tso-hung-lung or Kara Korum mountains, which goes by various names likewise. At its west end, where it joins the Bolor mountains, it is called Kanchgir. East of that Poosht-i-Khaur E. S. E., thence Appro (in which there is a large fort). To E. thence, the Great Spung. Thence eastward Ashahoon or Ashur; thence eastward, Thalshool or Krana. Krana itself is a beautiful peak, remarkable for striped ribbon jasper, olivine and chrysopras pebbles found in the beds of its streams. From Krana a considerable range runs down to Bullisthan called Kai-e-Kah. Here are beds of coal near the ruins of an ancient city called Shah Talif, or anciently Lihaf or Leefoo.\n\nThe Kai-e-leh is mostly slaty formation. In it are marble quarries, and alum and salt are extracted from some places in small quantities at the eastern base, and large quantities of borax: Leefoo is four or five days due north of Iskardo.\n\nFrom Krana eastward the range is called Kara Kurum to the source of the Chorere river, whence it takes the name of Thosunglung.\n\nThe Bolor mountain rises almost N. and S., commencing in the north of Zalnoohee in the Joolkal district, which is four or five days south of Balook Bara, a great lake; thence south by the fort and district of Zoonau, which lies to the N. E. of the Pingut range, treading N. W. or S. E. two marches and 8-9 Long. at its south, it is called Poosthek\u00e1n. To the north it is bounded by the Yoog Uhoog mountains, which commences at Pashee two days N. of Julmookhee and seventeen S. of Balook Bhara; it tends S. E. and joins the Kara Koorum near Hatch Kooth. N. and E. of Uhoog is the valley of Poosh bounded to N. by a spur of the Yagnee Dhawan mountains, whose westerly extremity commences at a day's march or a little south of Ausgess; thence it runs S. and S. E. to Othe, thence to Koum and Kharakool, then turning more easterly runs to the S. of Ooshkumnak and Doonshoo; (mostly uninhabited save by a few wandering Akas): thence it runs E. S. E. to Anewch\u00e1n Asa Mahaz\u00e1r, thence most southerly to Wahon, Munaham and Khamkoom, when it dies away on the plain of Vacha Thung.\n\n5. The fifth valley is Naw Aloon or Ooloor, due south of Pingut, and divided from it by the Zinpanooch range. It belongs to\nMuhammedan chiefs, but is mostly inhabited by Bolorees and wandering Shoolees.\n\n6. The Darahm valley due S. of Lat, and separated by the Dormah range, it is one of the best cultivated of these valleys, and belongs to independent Muhammedan chiefs.\n\n7. Rewanshoor valley, small, to E. and S. E. of the last, on north bank of the Gilgit; it is, though small, well cultivated, and gives good produce, especially wine and fruit.\n\n8. Booloo or Boolooper, a narrow slip, about two days' journey in length, from the Gilgit river to N. E.\n\n9. Gilgit Proper lies on both sides of the Gilgit river from Boolooper to Ooster and thence along N. bank to Shooghoor on the Indus.\n\n10. The Tangoot valley, considered a dependency of Gilgit, is divided from the Bullooper by the little Gilgit range.\n\n11. The Hunzaye may be considered as an eastern continuation of the last, from which it is divided by a small bare rocky range called Hai cha. It runs east and adjoins the Bulte Province, whence it is separated by the Hunzaye part of the Peeloo range.\n\n12. M\u00e1r dr\u00e1l Choo or Drale to N. and N. E. of Hunzaye, whence divided by the Peeloo. It is a dependency of Baltistan, and bounded on N. by the Karakoon, and E. by Kai ekah mountains, and ends in Isk\u00e1rdoo proper. The southern portion is most bare, producing nothing but borax. The Koobeloo district commonly called Lubra or Nubra or Nobra, may be considered as a large valley bounded by the Kara Khoorum mountains on N. or W. by Kai-e-Kah, S. by Indus and Kai-e-Kah, E. by the Nubra range; two northerly branches of the Indus run through this. The most westerly is the Koobeloo, which rises by two small branches in the Kara Koorum mountains. The most westerly of these is from a lake called Kaufeloo. The other is from large springs two days' stages from the lake, after these two branches run south to Nishtung where they meet, and the river thence passes the fort of Fo, thence turning W. for three days breaks through the Kai-e-Kah and joins the Indus at Khanthool about one and half day E. of Ooskardo.\n\nThe other river\u2014the Cheoera rises in the Kara Khoorum at some large spring one day east of those which are the E. sources of\nKoobeloo. Thence it runs S. along the base of Loobra mountain S. W. through Loobra plains and meets the Indus at Budgnak about twelve miles below the fort of Hemap.*\n\n---\n\n**Early Hind\u00fast\u00e1nya Poetry.\u2014By A. Sprienger, M. D.

H. 725) praises him very highly in the preface to one of his works, and says that he has written three thick Dywans, one in Arabic, one in Persian, and one in Hindy.\"\n\n* The orthography of the MSS. as far as it could be made out has been carefully preserved. Eds.\nThe terms Hind\u00fay and Hindy in these two passages mean the language in use among the Musalm\u00e1ns of India. I need hardly say that the terms Zub\u00e1ne Urd\u00fa, court language and Shi\u2019re R\u00e9khtah are very modern. The former of these terms is but very rarely used by natives of India and the latter is already obsolete, the usual term even now applied to the language and poetry which we call Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed is Hindy, and always has been \u201cHindy.\u201d The very name of \u201cDyw\u00e1n\u201d which is given to Mas\u2019\u00fad\u2019s collection of Hindust\u00e1n\u00ed poetry is a guarantee, that it did not consist of Slokas, Kabits, and D\u00f3hr\u00e1s, but of Mathnawies, Qa\u00e7ydahs and Ghazals written in the Persian character.\n\nAs to Mas\u2019\u00fad himself. His name is Ab\u00fa-Ifakhr Mas\u2019\u00fad, a son of Sa\u2019d and a grandson of Salm\u00e1n and his titles were Sa\u2019d aldawlah and \u2019amyde ajall. By the latter of these titles, he is named in a poem which San\u00e1y has written in his praise:\n\n\u0627\u06cc \u0639\u0645\u0647\u200c\u06cc \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0632 \u063a\u0632\u06cc\u0646 \u0631\u0627 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0628\u0631\u062f \u0648 \u0633\u06cc\u0631\u062a \u06a9\u0644\u0634 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\n\nThe statement of Mokhammad \u2019awfy that Mas\u2019\u00fad was born in Hamad\u00e1n is supported by the author of the Haft Iqlym, and he says himself that his origin was of Hamad\u00e1n. But it seems that he means merely that his family was of Hamad\u00e1n, and that the above two authors have been misled by this statement. Dawlat-sh\u00e1h believes that he was of Jorj\u00e1n, but Taqyy K\u00e1shy shows that he was born at Ghaznah and, surrounded by Hind\u00fa slave women as the Mokammadan nobles of Indian courts always were, it is not unlikely that the language of India was his mother-tongue.\n\nHis father Khw\u00e1jah Sa\u2019d was a noble at the court of Q\u00e1b\u00fas of Dylam, the son of Washamgyr. He left Jorj\u00e1n and went to Ghaznah for reasons which are not recorded. Mas\u2019\u00fad was born towards the end of the reign of the successor of Mahm\u00fad and grew up at the court of the Ghaznawides, and being a great financier he attained to the highest distinctions and was made Mostawfy and Munshi of the kingdom. But he had his downfall, and he had the misfortune to be imprisoned in the fortress of N\u00e1y for twenty-two years. The cause of his imprisonment is variously stated. Some say that he was arrested by order of an Amyr (military leader) of the name of Qom\u00e9j, when on a deputation to Syst\u00e1n and Z\u00e1bulist\u00e1n, because the mind of the King was poisoned against\nhim, owing to some suspicion against his fidelity in the discharge of his duties. But Nitzamy 'ar\u0101dhy states in his work which has the title of *al-J\u0101mi' apud Taqyy K\u0101shy* that Sayf aldawlah Ma'm\u016bd a son of Sultan Ibr\u0101hym was accused of having formed a plan of joining the court of Maliksh\u0101h, and that he was (in A. H. 472) cast into prison on this account, and put to death in it. His friends, the most intimate among whom was Mas'\u016bd, shared his misfortunes. Mas'\u016bd however regained his liberty after twelve years, but subsequently he had to endure eight years more of incarceration owing to the roguery of Ab\u016b Naqr. When he regained the second time his liberty, he withdrew from the world and devoted himself to the service of God. He died in 525. He was acquainted with many of the earliest Persian poets, most of whom sung his praise; among them are Ab\u016b-l-Faraj R\u0101ny, who was his teacher, Mokht\u0101ry of Ghaznah and Mo'izzy. Unfortunately none of his Hind\u016bstany compositions have been preserved, though it is very probable that they were still extant when Amyr Khoeraw wrote. Taqyy K\u0101shy has seen his Persian Dyw\u0101n which contained about six thousand verses, and he has embodied no less than 4,650 of them into his Tadzkirah.\n\n---\n\n**Report on the Geological Structure and Mineral Wealth of the Salt Range in the Punjab; with Maps, Sections, &c.\u2014by Andrew Fleming, M. D. Edin., F. R. S. E., Assistant Surgeon, 4th Regt. Punjab Cavalry. In charge of the Geological Survey of the Salt Range in the Punjab. Season 1851-52.**\n\n*(Communicated by the Govt. of India.)*\n\n*(Concluded from Page 368.)*\n\n**On the Korana Hills.**\n\nFrom the central district of the Salt Range and apparently running parallel to it, an isolated barren range of hills called Korana is seen rising out of the plain of the Jetch Doab or district between the rivers Jhelum and Chenab.\n\nThe highest point of this range is about forty-six miles S. S. W. of Pind Dadun Khan, and about twenty-four miles south-east of the civil station of Shahpoor.\n\nWhen in the Salt Range near the latter place, in the month of January, I took the opportunity of paying a flying visit to Korana,\nwhich, from the abrupt way in which at a distance it appears to rise out of the level alluvial plain, I supposed might turn out to be of volcanic origin, and might assist us in arriving at a conclusion as to the agency by which the strata of the Salt Range were elevated into their present position.\n\nFrom the Jhelum to Korana is one uninterrupted alluvial plain called the \"Bar,\" about six hundred feet above the level of the sea, thickly covered with a jungle of caper, pelu and mud, through which, from Shahpoor, a four hours' ride brings one to the foot of the hills. In this district there are but few villages, and the scanty population consists chiefly of thieving Beloochees, who, with their flocks of camels, bullocks and buffaloes, wander about the Bar, remaining in any one place only as long as food and water are procurable. For the latter, they are chiefly dependant on rain which is collected in holes or tanks dug out of the alluvial soil.\n\nTwo wells have been dug in the interior of the Bar on account of the great depth at which water is reached and its generally saline character.\n\nThe aspect of a range of hills which Korana from a distance presents, gradually disappears as we approach it, and we were not a little surprised to find that it consisted of a succession of isolated ridges of stratified rocks of various sizes, running parallel to each other and rising abruptly out of the plain, studding this over a space of some six or eight miles, and extending towards the Chenab in the neighbourhood of Chineout.\n\nAs we could only devote one day to the examination of these most singular rocks, our attention was devoted entirely to a portion of the principal ridge to which all the other smaller ones are apparently similar.\n\nThe Korana hill, on the summit of which is the residence of a highly venerated Fakir, consists of a ridge of rock stretching from north-east to south-west, and about two miles in length. By the Thermometer, its height is estimated at nine hundred and fifty-seven feet above the plain at its base. It presents a steep slope to the north-west on which a few stunted Phoolahee bushes have taken root, and an escarpment to the south-east. It has a peculiarly black volcanic appearance.\nThe ridge is entirely formed of a coarse brown ferruginous quartzose sandstone alternating with beds of a greenish quartzite, which in many places passes into a siliceous clay slate. These beds are all distinctly stratified and dip to the north-west at an angle of from $40^\\circ$ to $45^\\circ$.\n\nThe sandstone is traversed by numerous veins of white quartz containing masses of rich haematite iron ore, which do not seem to have attracted at all the attention of the natives as a source of iron, although it can be obtained in considerable quantity, and ought to yield from seventy to eighty per cent. of metal.\n\nFilling small cracks in the sandstone some small specimens of pyrolusite or peroxide of manganese were obtained. This, when powdered and treated with hydrochloric acid, gave out chlorine in abundance, and when fused with borax in the oxidising flame of the blow-pipe gave an amethyst-coloured glass. It occurs in thin detritic laminae of a steel-grey colour with a strong metallic lustre, and which exhibit a black streak. This valuable mineral was not detected in any of the quartz veins; but as it very generally occurs associated with haematite, it is not improbable that it may be found. It is nowhere an abundant mineral, and as it is in great demand for the manufacture of glass and for bleaching purposes, and fetches a high price in the market, it would be of great importance were a workable lode of it discovered.\n\nNo fossils could be detected in any of the strata which, from their mineral character, we are disposed to reckon as lower Silurian or Cambrian, the lowest of all fossiliferous rocks and subordinate to the salt formation of the Salt Range.\n\nFrom the general parallelism of the Korana ridges to the Salt Range we think it most probable that at one period, the latter had extended in breadth across the plain of the Punjab, from which, by disturbing agencies and extensive denudation, the softer strata have been removed, leaving only the harder and quartzose sandstones of Korana as monuments of its former extent.\n\nFrom Korana eastward to the foot of the Himalayas at Roopur we are not aware that a single rock occurs; nay, we believe that a traveller might search in vain even for a pebble in the sun-baked alluvial plain of the Punjab Doab.\nAs far as we have observed no out-bursts of plutonic or volcanic rocks occur in connection with the Korana strata, but the injection into what probably were rents in the sandstone, of pure quartz veins containing metallic ores, indicates their having probably been subjected to igneous agency. The limited time we had to spare did not permit of a more extended and careful examination of so interesting a formation, barren and uninviting though it appears to the eye of any one but a Geologist.\n\nIn conclusion we may remark that quartz vein penetrating alaty strata similar to those of Korana, have, in almost every part of the world, been found to be the principal source of the richest metallic ores. Gold ore is almost always found in quartz veins penetrating the most ancient fossiliferous and metamorphic strata, but as that metal is invariably found near the surface of its vein-stone, mining gold has never turned out so profitable a speculation, as washing its \"dust\" from the debris of its vein-stones in the alluvial deposits at the foot of auriferous ranges. We never have heard that gold was ever seen in the alluvium at the foot of the Korana hills, but the locality is one where we should expect to find it.\n\nThe metamorphic strata of the western Him\u00e1layas towards Cashmere, where they are so extensively invaded by igneous rocks, are certain to be found, when duly examined, to yield rich metallic ores. The difficulties attending investigations of the kind in such elevated localities are, however, very great. Hitherto the field may be considered as untrodden.\n\nApproximate heights above the sea level of localities in or near the Salt Ranges referred to in the accompanying report, calculated from the boiling point of water.\n\n| Locality                  | Approximate height feet | Remarks               |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Mount Tillah              | 3,277                   | Pucca Tank on Summit  |\n| Gurjok Hill above Jelalpore| 1,882                   | A little W. of village|\n| Plain at Jelalpoor         | 619                     |                       |\n| Plain at Jutana            | 619                     |                       |\n| Pind Dadun Khan           | 608                     | Plain near Fort       |\n| Top of Koosnack Fort       | 2,547                   | At the Musjeed        |\n| Tober Musjeed             | 2,141                   |                       |\nThe thermometers used in obtaining the above results are made by Newman, and furnished from the magazine of Fort William.\n\nIt is to be regretted that they were dispatched without their zero error being accurately ascertained, by comparison with an authentic standard thermometer or barometer. They are divided into $\\frac{1}{4}$\u00b0 divisions, which can be read off to $\\frac{1}{2}$\u00b0 with tolerable accuracy.\n\nHaving fixed the height of Pind Dadun Khan as six hundred and eight feet by the barometer, we were enabled thus approximatively to determine the amount of error in the thermometers, and to apply it to correct our results.\n\nIn this way they come wonderfully near to the heights obtained by barometric observations.\n\nThe small liability to accidents and the portable character of the mountain thermometer as well as the ease with which, in almost every situation, an observation can be taken, render it a most invaluable instrument to an Indian traveller.\n\nThe tables we have used are, we believe, those of Prinsep as given in Colonel Jackson's useful book entitled \"What to Observe.\"\n### Approximate Heights above the Sea Level of Localities in or near the Salt Range, referred to in the Accompanying Report calculated from Barometric Observations.\n\n| Date

Provided with one instrument, this was the only course I could adopt. Galbraith's Barometric Tables, which are considered to be very accurate, were employed, and their extreme simplicity is a strong recommendation in their favour.\n\nThe instrument employed was a Newman's mountain barometer of the latest and most approved construction, furnished from the Arsenal of Fort William. It was safely conveyed from Calcutta to Lahore, in November 1850, attached to a Palki, and from thence was brought on to Maree on the Indus by Mr. Purdon, from whom I received it in the middle of February 1851. There was then but little leakage, and its indications seemed accurate until towards the end of March, when it commenced to leak very much and became quite untrustworthy. On examining into the source of the leakage I found it proceeded partly from a crack which had formed in the upper wooden part of the cistern, and partly from the side of the tube where it passed into the cistern; several plans were tried without avail to stop the leakage, and at last the mercury escaped to such an extent, as to admit of air passing into the tube.\n\nBy the contact of the escaped mercury with the solder which connected the vernier to the arm of the rack which moves it up and down the scale, the vernier became detached, an accident which never could happen if the arm of the rock and vernier were made out of one piece of metal. It is somewhat strange that an instrument-maker of Mr. Newman's celebrity, should not have guarded against the possibility of an accident, such as I have recorded.\n\nIn manufacturing mountain barometers for use in the very dry climate of the north-west provinces of India, it would be highly desirable that the wooden part of the cistern of Newman's barometers should be either entirely dispensed with, or be constructed of some thoroughly baked dry and tough wood. I very much doubt, however, if any wood will stand without cracking, the influence of the sun and hot dry winds of the Punjab in March, April, and May.\n\nAnother barometer of an old pattern without even a rack adjustment of the vernier, and set in a round mahogany case, which was\nreceived in December 1851, on being taken out of its packing case appeared in good order. After standing in its leather-case for a day in my tent, its mahogany case warped so much as to bend forward the scale (metal) and impede the movement of the vernier. The first day I had occasion to take this instrument out, though carried with the greatest possible care, it leaked so much as to render the results obtained (in the absence of any instrument for comparison) utterly valueless. It is surprising that such an instrument should have been sent all the way from the Arsenal of Fort William to the Punjab for survey purposes.\n\nA little more care in the selection, and speed in the transmission, of instruments required, would save parties engaged in scientific works in the N.W. Provinces from much trouble and disappointment.\n\nList of specimens submitted to Government illustrative of the Geology of the Salt Range, &c., &c.\n\n| No. | Name | Locality | Remarks

E. direction, at an angle of from $75^\\circ$ to $80^\\circ$. A succession of these beds follow, the angle of their dip gradually diminishing, until about a mile from the entrance of the gorge, where they present a beautiful anticlinal curve. Beyond this, their dip again increases, and at Rhotas is $75^\\circ$ to the N. W.\n\nCrossing the bed of the Kuhar Nullah and proceeding along the Peshawur road, beds of alluvium are seen for about a mile. Beyond this, the sandstone strata again appear, dipping at an angle of $75^\\circ$ to the S. E., and may be traced almost uninterruptedly at Rawul Pindee,\npresenting a succession of anticlinal and synclinal axes stretching from N. E. to S. W.\n\n**Table No. IV.**\n\nSection across the Rhotas range at Mount Tillah between the villages of Hoona and Bhet at right angles to the strike of the strata.\n\nOn ascending the hill from Hoon we have\u2014\n\n1.

TECTUM,) are much less prominent at all ages, the entire carapax is broader and flatter, and the abdominal plates are brown-black with pale margins, and occasionally one or two pale central spots,\u2014instead of whitish, with two or three strongly contrasting blackish marks on each, as in E. TECTUM. Carapax of adult 7 in. long; that of adult E.

Agama Tiedmanni, Kuhl.\u2014A. vulturosa, Harl.\n\nThis is the most common and extensively distributed lizard in the country, being found everywhere in gardens, avenues and jungles. Though not a Chameleon in structure, it is yet one in habit, and much more so than our Chameleon. Its usual tints are a pale drab or fawn colour, but this it changes to bright red, to black and to a mixture of yellow red and black. This change is sometimes confined to the head, at other times diffused over the whole body and tail. A common state to see it in, is seated on a hedge or bush with the tail and limbs black, head and neck yellow picked out with red, and the rest of the body red. I am inclined to think that this display of colours is merely seasonal. It only occurs in the males, the females being uniformly and plainly coloured. The young has a pale band on each side of the body from the eye to the tail, and a series of dark bands on the back. Mr. Blyth mentions, in a notice of this lizard in the Journ. As. Soc. for 1842, p. 870, that its usual colour\nThis is somewhat remarkable and I should doubt if it was the same species.

S., Commissioner of Forests, Rangoon.\n\nAt the request of Capt. Phayre, Commissioner of Pegu, aided by Lieut. Nicholson of the 4th Seiks and the boats of the Hon\u2019ble Company\u2019s Steam Frigate Sesostris, I took the soundings and velocity of the current, at different points, across the bed of the Irrawaddy at Prome, on the 14th and 25th of April last, with a view of ascertaining the quantity of water discharged by the river into the sea.\n\nFrom a river-guage kept on board the Sesostris anchored opposite the wharf at Prome, (extracts of which are annexed,) it appears that there was a fall of about twenty feet from October 1852, when the place was taken, to February.\n\nHow much the river had fallen prior to October when the guage was first noted, is uncertain, as also the daily ratio of the fall during the subsequent months of November, December and January, the entries in the Sesostris\u2019s log-book having at first been irregularly made.\n\nThe river, however, continued to fall until the 28rd of February; on the 26th and the three subsequent days, a rise, in all of eleven inches, took place.\n\nThis partial rise of eleven inches in February, was followed by a fall of fourteen inches in March, with a slight rise of $\\frac{1}{4}$ of an inch on the 24th, and again of two inches on the 29th of March.\n\nFrom this date until the 7th of April, the river again fell about an inch daily, when it rose again five feet seven inches from the 8th to the 18th of April.\n\nThese changes in the river appeared to take place without reference to the changes of the weather, or even of the season in Burmah. On the contrary, the rains or S. W. monsoon, may be said to have set in at Prome on the 16th of May, when some inches of rain fell, and probably still earlier in the Arrakan and Moneepore mountains, from which direction the Irrawaddy receives a considerable tributary, yet the river continued still to fall, so that on the 5th of June, it stood one foot lower than it stood on the 14th of April.\nAbout the beginning of April or end of March, 1837, the late Mr. Griffith observed that at Mogoung, one hundred and eighty miles above Ava, the Irrawaddy presents the same large undivided body of water as in the lower parts of Burmah, and, as an instance of its great magnitude, he says that it is not affected in size or appearance by the addition it then receives of the Mogoung river, the last large tributary worthy of the name, which the Irrawaddy receives.\n\nThese circumstances together with the quantity of water discharged by the Irrawaddy into the sea, certainly claim for it a first place amongst the great rivers of the east, hardly second to the Ganges itself.\n\nWhile thus struck with the size of the Irrawaddy, we are forcibly reminded of its being, I believe, the only one of our great rivers, whose source is still a matter of speculation.\n\nMaking all allowance for the extravagance of Burmese Historians, there is enough in the authenticated history of the country, to show that great armies have passed and re-passed to, and from, China. Besides which, the Chinese character of the boats and houses of Burmah, together with some of the ceremonies of the people, suggest a more immediate and direct intercourse with China on the part of the Burmese, than any other nation on the western side of the Himalaya. So much so, that I have often heard it surmised by our officers at Prome, as one way of accounting for the resemblances, that the Irrawaddy probably flows from China, not that it was supposed to be navigable to that extent, but that its valleys may afford comparatively easy passes between the two countries.\n\nKlaproth considered the Irrawaddy to be a continuation of the Tsan peu or great river of Thibet, an opinion with which Mr. Griffith coincided. Colonel Wilcox, however, an excellent authority, considered the Tsan peu to be the continuation of the Burrampootur, and Captain Pemberton, I believe was of the same opinion, and accordingly made the Irrawaddy terminate in the Borkhumtee country, three hundred and sixty miles above Ava, although there can hardly be a doubt that it must necessarily have a more extended course, more especially as it has been traced two hundred miles\nNote on the Discharge of Water, by the Irrawaddy. [No. 5.\n\nabove Ava, without observing any perceptible difference or diminution of size.\n\nUnder these circumstances, discoveries of much interest may be expected to result from an investigation of the source of the Irrawaddy.\n\nIt is true that a part of the Chinese province of Yunnan approaches to within four days journey of Mogoung, and presents an extended boundary along the north-eastern frontier of Burmah sufficient to account for the direct intercourse that appears to be carried on between the two nations. But Yunnan itself seems to be here a mountain province, with perhaps but little communication with the rest of the Empire.\n\nIf on the other hand, the Irrawaddy be found, as is not unlikely, to be the continuation of one or other of the two great rivers laid down on Pemberton's Map as coming from the north of Thibet, some great gate or pass may be found across the chain by means of which an easy communication is formed with the central provinces of China.\n\nThe mean depth of the river on the 25th of April was ascertained to be 12.70838.\n\nThe mean speed of current was found to be $1\\frac{1}{4}$ of a mile or 3440 yards per hour.\n\nThe mean speed multiplied by 0.8 will give the average speed of the whole volume. The direct breadth of the River opposite the Commissariat Ghaut, taken by means of the Theodolite, was found to be 1210 yards.\n\n| Average speed in feet | Mean depth | Breadth in feet |\n|-----------------------|------------|----------------|\n| 8256                  | \u00d7 12.70838 | \u00d7 3630 =       |\n\n$380,859,500.1024$ cubic feet discharged per hour.\n\n$\\frac{380,859,500.1024}{60} = 6,347,658.83504$ cubic feet discharged per minute.\n\n$\\frac{6347658.83504}{60} = 105794.305594$ cubic feet discharged per second.\n\nThere are 6.2321 gallons in a cubic foot.\nRise and Fall of the Irrawaddy at Prome between the 20th of February and 30th of March, 1853.\n\n| Date   | Rise | Fall | Remarks |\n|--------|------|------|---------|\n| Feb.   |      |      |         |\n| 20th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 21st,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 22nd,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 23rd,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 24th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 25th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 26th,  | 4    |      | Inches. |\n| 27th,  | 2    |      | Inches. |\n| 28th,  | 3    |      | Inches. |\n| March  |      |      |         |\n| 1st,   | 2    |      | Inches. |\n| 2nd,   |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 3rd,   |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 4th,   |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 5th,   |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 6th,   |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 7th,   | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 8th,   |      | 3    | Inches. |\n| 9th,   | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 10th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 11th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 12th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 13th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 14th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 15th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 16th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 17th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 18th,  |      | \u00bc    | Inch.   |\n| 19th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 20th,  |      | \u00bd    | Inch.   |\n| 21st,  |      | \u00bd    | Inch.   |\n| 22nd,  |      | \u00bd    | Inch.   |\n| 23rd,  |      | \u00bd    | Inch.   |\n| 24th,  | \u00bc    |      | Inch.   |\n| 25th,  |      | \u00bc    | Inch.   |\n| 26th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 27th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 28th,  | 0    | 0    | 0       |\n| 29th,  | 2    |      | Inches. |\n| 30th,  |      | 1    | Inch.   |\n| 31st,  |      |      |         |\nRise and Fall of the Irrawaddy at Prome between the 8th and 24th of April, 1853.\n\n| Date | Rise | Fall |\n|------|------|------|\n| April 8th | 1\u00bd Inches | .. |\n| 9th | 2\u00bd do. | .. |\n| 10th | 22 do. | .. |\n| 11th | 27 do. | .. |\n| 12th | 13\u00bd do. | .. |\n| 13th | 1 do. | .. |\n| 14th | .. | 4 Inches |\n| 15th | .. | 8 do. |\n| 16th | .. | 4 do. |\n| 18th | .. | 11 do. |\n| 20th | .. | 10 do. |\n| 21st | .. | 3 do. |\n| 22nd | .. | 5 do. |\n| 23rd | .. | 2 do. |\n| 24th | .. | 2\u00bd do. |\n\nNo. 964.\n\nMemorandum on the prospect of remuneration in working the Iron Mines of the Raneegunge district. By Major W. E. Baker, Consulting Engineer to the Govt. of India, with a Report on the same subject by Professor Oldham, Geol. Surveyor.\u2014Communicated by the Govt. of Bengal.\n\nThe prospect of profit in working these mines, has been fully and ably discussed by Professor Oldham in his report, dated 18th May, 1852, pp. 9 to 20, and though I cannot say that his arguments have on all points commanded my conviction, I believe that on the whole they are sound; at all events I have not the familiar knowledge of details, which would enable me to combat them, or would justify my dissent from his general conclusion, p. 18.\n\n\"That under existing conditions the manufacture of Iron, on any efficient scale, and on the European system, cannot be undertaken in this district with a certain prospect of such a return, as would justify the great outlay required.\"\n\nBut Mr. Oldham remarks in the paragraph succeeding that which I have quoted, that the then \"existing conditions\" may alter, and, in fact, they have already altered to such an extent, as materially to affect the argument.\nOne of the most important calculations on which Mr. Oldham's conclusions rest, is that of the relative cost in England and India, of the raw materials required for the manufacture of a ton of pig Iron\u2014showing a difference in favour of India, of 1l. which he does not consider to afford a sufficient margin to cover the increased cost of machinery required for the subsequent processes\u2014or the risks so forcibly and truly enumerated in the 13th page.\n\nAbout half of the estimated cost in India is that of limestone, which is set down at 8s. 6d. a ton in Calcutta, and 27s. a ton at Raneegunge\u2014but the mineral branch of the Railway is now approaching completion, and though stopped for the present at the Collieries, would doubtless be extended to the site of any large Iron works that might be established\u2014this would convey limestone from Calcutta at about 7s. 6d. a ton, making an aggregate cost of 16s. instead of 27s., and exactly doubling the difference of cost in favour of India.\n\nBut a circumstance which will still further affect the comparison, and which will throw additional weight into the scale of the Indian manufacture, is the great rise which has lately occurred in the price of Iron at home, and of freight of all kinds from England to this country. How far the continuance of these prices may be depended upon, it is impossible to say\u2014but it should be recollected that Mr. Oldham's comparison was made during a period of great depression of the Iron trade, when prices were lower than, I believe, they had ever been before, or were likely to be, or at all events to continue, again.\n\nOn these considerations, I would hope that the prospect of turning to useful account, the mineral riches of this locality, are not now so discouraging as they appeared to Professor Oldham, but I would recommend those, who may contemplate embarking their capital in such a speculation, to commence on a small scale, by the establishment of one or two blast furnaces for the manufacture of cast Iron (for which there is a considerable local demand), and to await public opinion on its quality, before incurring the additional expense of puddling furnaces, rolling mills, &c.\n\nIn connexion with this subject, I may mention that the chairs supplied for the East India Railway by the Porto Novo Iron Com-\npany of Madras\u2014have been much objected to, by the Engineers, as being brittle, and somewhat irregular in shape. I would not say that these faults (if not exaggerated) are irremediable\u2014or that they would necessarily be found in the Raneegunge manufacture\u2014but they serve to illustrate the truth that something besides the raw material is requisite to the production of a marketable article\u2014and perhaps also, we may further deduce from these circumstances, that Iron of local manufacture will have to encounter a certain amount of prejudice on the part of English Engineers and Plate-layers.\n\nG. A. C. Plowden, Esq., Offy. Secy. to the Govt. of India.\n(Sd.) W. E. Baker, Major,\nConsulting Engineer to the Govt. of India.\n20th June, 1853.\n\n(True Copy)\n(Sd.) G. Cooper, Offy. Under-Secy. to the Govt. of India.\nNo. 189.\n\nFrom the Superintendent of the Geological Survey,\nTo W. Gordon Young, Esq., Under-Secy. to Govt. of Bengal.\nDated August 10th, 1853.\n\nSir,\u2014I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 518, dated July 19th, 1853, enclosing copy of a memorandum by the consulting Engineer to the Government of India in the Railway Department, on the prospects of remuneration in working the Iron mines of the Raneegunge district, and requesting that I will report my opinion on the subject, under the present altered aspect of the case.\n\nMajor Baker has very justly stated that a great change in the conditions under which the manufacture of Iron in that district could be undertaken, will be effected by the completion of the intended Railroad to Raneegunge; and by the consequent economy of transit for such materials, as are required in that manufacture, but which, not occurring in the vicinity, must be procured from a distance. And while admitting the justice of the conclusion at which I had arrived from an investigation of the whole matter in 1852, he yet considers that the alteration in the conditions then existing, will be of sufficient amount materially to affect the argument.\nThe principal, and indeed the only change in these conditions of any importance, to which Major Baker refers, is the greatly diminished cost of limestone, the price of which would be reduced from 27s. per ton, (at which I estimated it,) to about 16s. per ton. Of course the sum estimated by Major Baker, as the cost of carriage per Railway is liable to such alteration, as experience in the cost of working the line may introduce, but taking this estimated cost as correct, we would have a saving in the cost of limestone of from 10s. to 11s. per ton. But this does not, as Major Baker says, \"exactly double the difference of cost of the raw materials in favour of India,\" as the difference originally estimated by me, of 11s. per ton, was per ton of pig Iron, and not per ton of limestone. Taking then the cost of limestone at 17s. instead of 27s. per ton, we would have the entire cost of the raw materials required for the production of one ton of pig Iron as follows.\n\n|                | s. | d. |\n|----------------|----|----|\n| Coal           |    |    |\n| Ore            |    |    |\n| Limestone      |    |    |\n\nAs compared with 52s. 10\u00bdd. in Great Britain or a saving in prime cost of 18s. 6\u00bdd. per ton.\n\nI should state here, that subsequently to the publication of my former report, I was informed by more persons than one, that I had therein estimated the cost of raising the Iron stone at too low a price, and that in reality the expenses attending it, would be more nearly 6s. per ton, than 4s. My own enquiries did not lead me to think so, but I should not wish to place my casual examinations in comparison with the long acquired experience of those resident in the neighbourhood, and who could not have any very obvious interest in misrepresenting the facts, as the establishment of Iron works would evidently benefit the district. But if these statements be admitted as true, and the estimate given above be modified accordingly, the cost of the raw materials for one ton of pig Iron would be\nThis as compared with the cost in Great Britain, (52s. 10\u00bdd.) will leave the difference in favour of India, very nearly the same as originally estimated, viz. 11s. notwithstanding the difference in cost of the limestone.\n\nAs I have stated above, my own enquiries certainly did not lead me to think that the cost of raising the ore, would be more than 4s. per ton. But on a reference to my report, it will be seen that I fully anticipated and referred to the difficulties which would attend on the extraction of it, and stated that I had been fully satisfied that Mr. Williams had previously under-estimated its cost. It is possible, I did so also, judging from the amount of work which would readily be done by an English miner. But I do not think the cost (even allowing for all these difficulties, and for the want of training in the hands employed) could be so great, as it has been stated. If the cost be therefore estimated at the mean of the two statements, or at 5s. per ton, we have the cost of raw materials still showing a balance in favour of India of 14s. 11\u00bdd. or 15s. per ton.\n\nNow I have, in my former report, estimated that the difference in the cost of the raw materials of 11s. per ton of pig Iron would not more than counterbalance the great additional charges and risks necessarily attendant on such undertakings in this country. Beyond this, there will remain therefore a clear saving, under the altered conditions of the case, of from 4s. to 7s. for each ton of pig Iron.\n\nMajor Baker also states, as additional reasons for supposing that the manufacture of Iron could probably be carried on with profit now, that since my report was written the price of Iron has greatly advanced, and also the charge for freight.\n\nWith reference to the former fact, that the price of Iron has advanced, it must be borne in mind that the calculations in my report were founded on the cost of the raw materials without any reference whatever to the cost of the manufactured article. And I may state,\nthat I purposely avoided any allusion to the then cost of Iron, as I was fully aware, that at the time alluded to, Iron was being sold at the smallest possible profit, and in many cases at an actual loss.\n\nWith regard to the question of freight, I have no means of ascertaining the probability of a continuance or non-continuance of the present high rates, though I am disposed to think, that these rates are exceptional, caused by the sudden diversion from the ordinary channels of trade, of a very large amount of shipping, in consequence of the rapid and immense extension of intercourse with the gold-producing countries. I have no means here, of ascertaining by a reference to commercial reports, what the average charge for freight has been, during the last twenty years, but I am inclined to think that the tendency has been to a regular decrease, and not to an increase, and to suppose that the present is only a temporary derangement in the scale of charges, arising from the temporary causes, which are even already passing away. On this, however, I cannot pretend to offer an opinion, and of course, any increase in the freightage charges will be so much in favour of the Indian manufacture.\n\nIf therefore, my former conclusions were just (and I was glad to find that Major Baker fully confirmed the general correctness of the argument) I am still of opinion that the only really well founded advantage in favour of the manufacture in India, will be the saving in the original cost of the materials and that this saving will be from 4s. to 7s. per ton of pig Iron manufactured; this saving being over and above the amount sufficient to counterbalance all additional risks in this country. And I think that this ought to be sufficient to induce the investment of capital in such undertakings.\n\nMajor Baker has suggested that any persons engaging in such manufacture, should at first confine their attention to the production of cast Iron only, in the justice of which advice I fully concur. Indeed, such must be the necessary consequence of any attempt to work these ores, on an efficient scale. I do not, however, see that there is any sufficient demand for cast Iron, to justify the commencement of such heavy works as would be required with a view to the production of cast Iron only. Major Baker states that there is \"a considerable local demand for cast Iron.\" A reference to the tables\nof imports however, shews that during the year 1851, only 510 tons of pig-iron were imported. Now a single blast-furnace of small size would produce about 45 tons per week, or considerably more than 2000 tons per annum, that is more than four times the amount at present required to supply the market. And such blast-furnaces to be worked economically, must be worked nearly continuously.\n\nWith such a demand, therefore, (and I am not aware of any supply of cast Iron other than that imported) or even supposing this demand to be doubled, I cannot see that any one would be justified in undertaking such a manufacture on the British system, with a view to the supply of cast Iron only:* I would put out of the question the consideration of other systems, as being inapplicable to the peculiar kind and quality of ores found in the district referred to.\n\nMajor Baker in his memorandum refers to the objections urged against some of the chairs supplied by the Porto Novo Madras Iron Company. I have myself seen castings turned out from that Company's works, which on any English Railroad, would have been not only objected to, but at once rejected without the slightest hesitation. But I am satisfied that these defects arose as much from a want of sufficient care in moulding, and from the use, probably, of inferior sand, as from the quality of the metal; and that they are quite capable of being remedied. I stated in my former report (page 15) that the character of the iron produced in this country should, like every new article of commerce, be established before it would be purchased with confidence, and there can be no doubt, it would have to contend against the thoroughly well grounded prestige in favour of English work, but this difficulty would rapidly vanish, provided the articles supplied, were equally good in quality and finish.\n\nIn connexion with this subject, I cannot avoid again taking the\n\n* Supposing there were a demand for 1000 tons of pig Iron; and that as above calculated, the manufacturer in India would have an additional profit, beyond the ordinary profits of the trade, of 7s. per ton (taking the most favourable estimate) this would only give him \u00a3350 per annum; while the first outlay for machinery, &c. would be at the least \u00a36000 to \u00a37000, thus yielding an additional profit of nearly five per cent. Having no returns of the amount of \"castings\" imported, I have been obliged to estimate solely from the amount of pig Iron imported.\nopportunity of respectfully urging on the consideration of the Most Noble the Governor of Bengal the great importance of a careful and systematic analysis of the several Iron ores of the district referred to, and of other parts of India. I have already,* in connexion with coal enquiries, urged the importance of such a series of experimental investigations, and I am satisfied that valuable results would spring from a similar enquiry into the composition, &c. of the various ores of India; of the methods now adopted in their reduction, and of the possible improvement in these. There have been no trustworthy analyses of these ores as yet made, and it is possible that some ingredient may be found in one or other of the many beds, which may either render the ore of that bed comparatively useless, or may materially increase its apparent value. Such a series of analyses systematically conducted by a competent chemist, and in connexion with the actual examination of the mode of occurrence of the several ores in the field, would prove of great value; but could only be undertaken with advantage by some one, who could devote his time zealously, and continuously to the task, so that the result might be strictly comparable.\n\n(Signed) Thomas Oldham,\nDarjeeling, August 1st, 1853.

Sprenger.\n\nBaghdad, April 15th, 1853.\n\n\"I have indeed such an enormous mass of materials in hand that a couple of years' leisure, is almost indispensable to put them in order, and carry them through the press. The historical portion consists of an almost continuous series of annals extending from the time of Solomon to the destruction of Nineveh. But besides this, I have the library of the Assyrian kings to classify and publish.\n\n* From Superintendent of Geological Survey, To Under-Secretary Government of Bengal. No. 181, June 27, 1853.\n\u2014On the clay tablets, indeed, which we have found at Nineveh, and which are now to be counted by thousands, there are explanatory treatises on almost every subject under the sun, the art of writing, grammars, and dictionaries, notation, weights and measures, divisions of time, chronology, astronomy, geography, history, mythology, geology, botany, &c. In fact we have now at our disposal a perfect cyclop\u00e6dia of Assyrian science, and shall probably be able to trace all Greek knowledge to this source.\"\n\nExtract of a Letter from Col. Rawlinson to Mr. Grote, dated, Baghdad, 5th July, 1853.\n\n\"You will have seen probably in the Anniversary Report of the London Society, a brief account of my late proceedings, but I may be able to add a few details of interest that have not yet been published. The comparative modernicity of the Assyrian Empire is now established beyond all cavil. I have obtained almost a complete list of Kings numbering about thirty from the fall of Neneveh, late in the 7th century B.C. to the institution of the Empire in the middle of the 13th century. Previously to that date Assyria was subject to Babylonia, and as materials accumulate, we should be able, I think, to turn up Babylonian history, through the various dynasties noted by Berosus to the real starting point of Western-Asiatic Empire, in the 23rd century before the Christian era. I do not expect to ascend higher than that period, except through ethnic affinities and mythological tradition, sources of evidence which should be used very cautiously, but which, in this case, I can already plainly see will bring the subject into immediate connection with the 10th chapter of Genesis. The labour, however, required to bring out these results is immense. It would take a person at least ten years nearly, to copy all the curious MSS. documents now at our disposal, forming the debris of the Royal Library at Nineveh; and in the mean time wherever we dig, fresh tablets are being brought to light, so that our stores of information are likely to increase indefinitely. With regard to the mechanism of this enquiry, I must also inform you that if you merely looked to my preliminary dissertation in the R.A.S. Journal, you would have a very imperfect idea of the extent or condition of the Alphabet. Later researches have furnished me with above a thousand distinct characters, and\nthese characters have on an average four or five distinct values, so that the very element of the study presents a really formidable difficulty. I will write to you at greater length, as soon as I have a little more time at my disposal.\"\n\nExtract from a letter from Sir Henry Elliot to Dr. A.

Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, enclosing further correspondence regarding the discovery of coal on the bank of the Chawa Nadee.\n\nThe report of the Curator of the Museum of Economic Geology, read at the April meeting, referred to this discovery. The correspondence now received gives the result of an examination of the site of the coal by a small party of sappers.\n\nThe following extract from the report of the serjeant in charge of the party is not favourable.\n\n\"The Sivok Nadee is about four miles long, and takes its rise from between two high hills (names not known) which are, judging from supposition, in height three or four thousand feet, and very steep, extending its course for upwards of two miles between these hills, before it opens out into the plains. Ultimately it empties itself into the river \"Teesta\" two miles further on, the average width being about ninety feet, and it is in that portion of the Nadee between the hills and not on the plains, that, amongst the high rocks which overhang each side, the coal exhibits itself in the fissures of\nthe rocks, in small quantities, which with difficulty we extracted. The thickness of veins visible in the fissures in the rocks, is from a quarter to two inches, that in the cavities we found in lumps, specimens of which I am bringing with me. The whole of the coal to be seen is embedded in a hard sandstone.\"\n\n3. From Major J. Turton, Prome, offering for the Society's acceptance, specimen of a fossil root of a tree from that district.\n\nThe following is an extract from Major T.'s letter:\n\n\"It was broken in half whilst being rolled towards the camp and when first moved, a piece eight or ten inches in length, that might be called the tap-root, was broken off and afterwards lost. The root measured about four feet across the longest diameter, and two to two and a half at the shortest. It was found embedded on one of the small hills to north-east of the Pagoda a mile or so distant, and to all appearance was on the position in which it had grown. Only one piece of any size such as would be considered part of the same tree was lying near it.\"\n\n4. From Dr. J. Fayerer, Rangoon, enclosing Meteorological Registers kept at the Field Hospital, Rangoon, for the months of February, March and April.\n\n5. From O. Gubbins, Esq. Bijnore, noticing the occurrence of a dust-storm at Bijnore on the morning of the 30th May last.\n\nThe following is an extract from Mr. Gubbin's letter:\n\n\"For the benefit of future meteorologists, I may as well place on record the fact of an andhi or dust-storm coming from the north-east, the first time that I remember such an occurrence during nearly twenty-five years' residence in the northern parts of the upper provinces. Its extent appears to have been considerable, including all northern Rohilcund, but I am not aware how far it was felt south of Moradabad, nor whether it entered the Doab.\n\n\"The month of May has here been very tolerably mild, but on Sunday the 29th the atmosphere became oppressively warm. The evening and night were extremely close, without the usual freshness towards morning, and as the sun rose (30\") an east wind also got up raising clouds of dust, but hardly sufficient to be called a dust-storm. Throughout the whole day a grove of trees, about a mile off, was never once seen, some other trees within three hundred yards...\"\nwere dimly perceived as in a cloud, and although there was constant sunshine, it was so reflected and obstructed by the fine dust floating in the atmosphere, that often for an hour together, there was hardly a perceptible shadow cast.\n\n\"Towards 6 p.m. the wind, still from the north of east, rapidly increased, and for about quarter of an hour blew as strongly as in an ordinary andhi (I have no Anemometer, so cannot be more precise), completely hiding from view an out-building rather above a hundred yards distant. The whole then cleared off, a very few drops of rain fell, and the evening and night were clear and remarkably cool for the season. This was probably due to a heavy fall of rain which, I am informed, took place about the same time among the lower hills.\"\n\n6. From Captain C.

Dalton, together with a note on the Gold Fields of that Province, by Major Hannay.\n\nI received instructions, in November last, to examine and report on the Gold-producing capabilities of an auriferous stream, an affluent of the Booree Dihing, called the Jugloo. This stream takes its rise in the Tipam range of hills in this District (Luckimpore) in about 27\u00b0 20' North Latitude and 95\u00b0 30' East Longitude, flows through an uninhabited tract of high undulating forest-land between the hills and Dihing river, into which the Jugloo discharges itself fourteen miles above Jaipore after a course of about ten miles.\n\nThis Jugloo, or the tract through which it flows, was, in olden times from the richness of the metal found there, considered a royal preserve as a gold-field. There is a tradition that in some part of it, gold was found in lumps attached to an edible root accidentally pulled up by a fortunate traveller; but the exact site of this discovery is not now known.\n\nIn modern times, it has been quite deserted by the professional gold-washers, because they say that it costs more to propitiate the spirits who guard over the mineral treasures of the stream, than they can afford to pay. Fortunately these spirits are said never to molest Europeans, so without considering the propitiatory offering necessary as a preliminary, I proceeded to the field accompanied by an expert gold-washer who, as a slave in a Singphoo family, had\npractised the vocation in the Northern Provinces of Burmah, and a few men with kodals, pick-axes and shovels.\n\nAfter about an hour's walk from the Dihing up the stream of the Jugloo, when we first came on pebbles, we commenced washing in a rough wooden pan made for the occasion. The very first attempt gave a few minute specks of rather pale gold; we continued washing at intervals as we advanced, and every panful of gravel was found to contain a few of these spangles. At a point which seemed favourable for the purpose, we turned a portion of the stream and made a hole three feet in its bed. The washings from this depth decidedly gave a greater number of spangles and of a richer colour, than those we had obtained from the surface washings. Rising from a part of the stream the section of a hill about fifty feet in height, of coarse reddish sandstone, was left bare and perpendicular by a land slip. This contained a stratum of gravel about fifteen feet above the highest water-mark, some of which I caused to be washed, and it too was found to contain gold, indicating that the presence of that metal was not confined to spots acted on by the waters of the Jugloo; sand and gravel taken from occasional water-courses leading to the Jugloo were washed with the same result.\n\nRetracing our steps we proceeded up another branch of the Jugloo, and were joined by a party of gold-washers deputed by me to obtain specimens, who took us to the scene of their operations about half a mile from the junction of the two rivers. They had been working two pans and, to assist the operation, they had constructed two small embankments with bamboos and rubbish which divided the stream into three channels and enabled them to turn all the water into or out of the central channel. Their practice is to collect with small wooden scrapers a heap of gravel at the lower end of their central channel; upon this they cause the stream to play, and with sieves made of bamboo they sift the heap and throw aside the pebbles.\n\nThe stream carries off the lighter particles of the sand thus disturbed. Pansful of the residue, which consists entirely of mineral fragments, are then taken up and washed in the usual manner with results far more satisfactory, than when the gravel is washed in the pan without being subjected to this preliminary process.\nProceeding up this stream I found it had in many places cut for itself little ravines showing sections of hills formed of deposits of grey and red coarse sand of sufficient consistency to form upright cliffs, though crumbling when handled, with beds of gravel intervening, which also occur in tolerably consistent masses approaching to a conglomerate; these lay in strata inclined at an angle of forty-five or thereabouts. I obtained washings from them all, and found gold dust in the red sand and gravel strata always, but not always in the blue sand which owed its colour to a mixture of blue clay slate silt.\n\nIt follows from the above that gold is not confined to the bed of the stream, it is disseminated throughout the tract through which the stream flows, and the only question is whether it is found in sufficient quantities to render washing for it a profitable speculation.\n\nThe mere surface experiments as yet made are not a sufficient test; the deposit should be thoroughly examined to its base before its value can be determined.\n\nOf the comparative richness of the Jugloo tract, so far as it has been examined I can only judge from the quantity of gold dust obtained in my own desultory operations.\n\nI made a rough estimate of the quantity of rubble washed, and on comparing it with the gold obtained, it gave about 18 grains to the ton and about 8 grains as the out-turn of one man's labour for the day.\n\nSubsequently I had an opportunity of more accurately testing the produce of a gold-washer's daily work in a different field.\n\nAfter I had left the Jugloo, Major Hannay proceeded with the examination of the auriferous deposits in that vicinity and about Jaipore, and, as will be seen from his paper on the subject, has satisfactorily-established, that it is of great extent, flanking the whole of the Naga range of hills from the Noa Dihing to the Dhunsiri river. We subsequently proceeded together to examine the gold-producing sands of the Seesee river on the North bank of the Brahmapooter; we took gold-washers with us and found a party of the Seesee ryots at work just under the hill.\n\nWithin an easy march of their own villages, they annually find here lucrative occupation for the months of the year when an excursion of the kind is most enjoyable, and when they have most leisure\nfrom their agricultural pursuits to give to it. After \"harvest home\" in January, they form parties and start with provisions for a week or a fortnight, and in a very short time, if they are fortunate, they may obtain sufficient gold to pay their revenue. They wash in troughs called \"doorunis,\" a process which has been already described in former numbers of the Journal.*\n\nIn favourable localities, 20 grains of gold is not an unusual return to one day's labour with a dooruni worked by three men, who between them dig up, remove and wash in a day on an average about one ton of rubble. In the operations conducted in our presence, the yield of one dooruni, which was made over to me, was only 11 grains, from 1 ton, 2 cwt. and 36 lbs. of rubble, but this was pronounced by the gold-washers to be very unfavourable.\n\nThe average may be estimated for the Seesee at 15 grains to 1 ton of earth. This in Siberia would not be considered worth working, but to an Assamese, it is very good return for an employment which is not very laborious and is decidedly interesting. To prove this, it is only necessary to observe the excited and gratified looks of the party as they collect round the dooruni at that period of the operation, when the gold is displayed as a bright fringe bordering the upper portion of the fine black sand, to which the operator has reduced the rubble, he has been working in.\n\nThe annual yield of the Seesee is said to be about half a seer. Judging in this way, the most valuable rivers are the Subanshiri and Dibong, whose yield annually is from a seer and a half to two seers of pure gold.\n\nThe Brahmapooter and Dibong are said to give each from half a seer to three quarters; the numerous smaller rivers in Luckimpore are variously stated at from a quarter to half a seer, the total annual yield of the district being about ten seers. Each river is worked by the gold-washers who live nearest to it. But, few are now employed in the occupation in comparison to the numbers that engaged in it when Assam was under a native government. The whole of the Kh\u00e9le or tribe of gold-washers were then obliged to follow that profession; as they were under the necessity of paying their contribution towards the expenses of the state in pure gold.\n\n* Vide Journal Vol. VII. p. 621.\u2014Eds.\nNotes on the Gold Fields of Assam.\u2014By Major Hannay.\n\nAlthough it is well authenticated that the produce of the gold-washings in Assam, particularly Upper Assam, formed a very considerable source of revenue to the Assam Government of former days, no correct data can be obtained so as to give an idea of the exact amount of gold realized yearly:\u2014but, as the Sonwals, or gold-washers, one of the constituted Kh\u00e9le or sections of the inhabitants (according to occupation) who paid their taxes in gold, form a large portion of the population, we may reckon on its having been something considerable, when in the Northern district of Sudddeah alone, including Luckimpore, these Sonwal paiks amounted to 10,000. Allowing, therefore, that every paik, at the lowest rate, supplied 4 annas weight of gold-dust yearly, the total amount would be 40,000 grs. for that district alone, and as the same system of gold-washing obtained in the districts of the South bank of the Brahmapooter, as much more may have been there realized, and it may not be perhaps beyond the mark, to note the yearly produce of gold-washing in Assam, in former times, as amounting to 8, or 10,000\u00a3 sterling.\n\nIn the short account of Assam given at the end of Vol. III. of Montgomery Martin\u2019s \u201cSketches of Eastern India,\u201d in enumerating the rivers on the North bank of the Brahmapooter, the whole of them are said to contain gold in their sands, and the Subanshiri, Dikrung, Boopani, Booragong, and Boargon, rivers of the Luckimpore and Kullungpore districts, are noted each as to the quality and quantity of their gold; but other small rivers in the Luckimpore district\u2014the more prolific sources of the Dihong, the Dibong, or the Brahmapooter\u2014are not alluded to, neither is the Dihing or any one river on the South bank mentioned; which shows, that the information relative to the extent of the Gold fields, was imperfect. Chap. III., however, of the same notice, under head \u201cCommerce of Assam,\u201d states, that the Assam Government received into the Royal Treasury 1,500 grs. weight of gold yearly, from a gold mine called Pakerguri, situated at the confluence of the Dhunsiri river with the Brahmapooter. The Pakerguri is a small river rising in the Rengma mountains joining the Dhunsiri, a day\u2019s journey within its con-\nfluence with the Brahmapooter. I cannot vouch for the correctness of the statement given regarding the gold mine, but this small river is known in its upper course, to be a prolific gold stream in the present day. It is stated also, that the imports at Goalparah from Bengal in 1808-9 amounting to two and a quarter lacks of rupees, paid in gold from these resources, and in silver. A good deal has been already written on the gold statistics of Assam, as they are known in modern times; (Vide vol. VII. p. 625) and little more can be said beyond the personal knowledge which has been obtained of the wide extent of the existence of the precious metal; and that in some of the districts in North East Assam, it is now a profitable source of payment of revenue to the Sonwal ryots; the Luckimpore and Sudder districts produced in 1851-52, ten seers of pure gold. The selling rate to the Ryah traders being from 14 to 15 Rs. per tolah of solid gold prepared by melting with quicksilver.\n\nThe geological features of Assam are decidedly in favour of its being a Gold field. The valley, like others in Northern Burmah and North West China, abuts upon a portion of Tartary in which, from Longitude 96\u00b0 Eastward, in a distance of a hundred miles, several large and magnificent rivers, having their sources in Eastern central Tartary, burst through the great Southern mountain barrier, finding their way to the ocean in a direction not far varying from the cardinal points North and South, thus forming valleys and mountain ranges running in the same direction.\n\nSeveral of these mountain ranges are known to be very rich in minerals, particularly in Northern Laos, and in the range called, by the Chinese, Ootai Shan, or Great Black Mountains, which forms the boundary between China and Burmah, can be enumerated gold, iron and salt in the Northern portion\u2014silver, iron and precious stones in the central, and further on, antimony, iron and tin. This range also evidently passes through the Malayan Peninsula; and in its most Southern limits, we have again gold and tin. Indeed, as a geographical and statistical fact, it may be safely stated that in this line of mountains, we ought to recognize the true Aurea Chersonesus of the ancients, as well as their Auria Regio and Argentea Regio.\n\nOther tracts in Burmah are also rich in valuable minerals; its white marble and noble serpentine, are perhaps unequalled. The Ir-\nIrrawaddy itself, in its higher course, abounds in rocks of beautiful workable serpentine of varied colours. There is every appearance of the existence of copper interspersed amongst these rocks: and most of the affluents of the Irrawaddy like the tributary rivers of the Brahmapooter abound in gold: but the most prolific sources of this metal appear to be well to the North, where the mountain torrents have a short and turbulent course to the main river.\n\nIn the Hookong valley, the tributaries of the Kyondwen are prolific in gold, and two of the rivers, Kapdhoop and Nam Tibee, are noted for the size of the scales (pepitas), which are described as varying from the size of a pumpkin seed to a four-anna piece, and, from what I have myself seen, I do not doubt it. Most, if not all of this gold goes to China, where it is beaten into gold-leaf and subsequently finds its way to Burmah to be used in the gilding of the Kyoungs (monasteries) and temples.\n\nIn Assam, in the lower and central portion of the valley, the rocks visible and in situ, are granite, gneiss, and a coarse sandstone and quartz rock. In the line of the Brahmapooter river these disappear on the North or right bank after leaving the high table-land at Bishnath; on the South bank the Dhunsiri river, which runs but at some distance along the Eastern flank of the Rengma mountains, may be said to be its limit here. The granite rocks which come very close upon the Dhunsiri at the Nambar falls, are succeeded by shell and other limestone of an uniform fawn colour, and in the same vicinity are hot sulphureous springs, and numerous salzes, containing sulphurates of iron and salt. Succeeding the Rengma range also, we have a low hilly and undulating country with deep dells and rice pathars, extending Eastward across the valley to the great Naga range, and throughout this tract, there are extensive hard ferruginous deposits, some of which crop out in the bed of the Dhunsiri. In the banks of that river also, as well as throughout a considerable tract of country to the East, including Basah Doyang, the plastic clay at some depth under the surface contains an oxide of iron in grains, which is extensively smelted for its iron.\n\nThe great Naga range in the interior, as far as I have seen it, East of the Dikho, is clay slate, which in some of the hills imbeds nodules of a compact clay iron ore; in other parts also a coarse sand-\nstone crops out, as well as a hard heavy homogeneous blue-coloured rock with white quartz veins. Tufaceous limestone has also been discovered both in the clay slate, and in the last named rock. In the steep banks of the rivers of this section of the Naga range, so soon as the clay slate commences, there are numerous brine springs, many of which have been open from time immemorial, and others are being constantly dug out. The shafts are from twelve to thirty feet deep, and always dug in the clay slate, but no workable brine is found, until boulders are reached of the blue-coloured rock above-mentioned, which from its hardness is called by the Nagas, Ts Loung. After leaving the true clay slate there is a tract of hilly ground, composed of small boulders of the foregoing rocks, with ferruginous deposits as hard as the metal itself. To this succeed the deposits of the lower range in which we find coal and carboniferous strata indications, and in all the small streams which pass through their tract gold is found in a rubble consisting of rolled pebbles of rocks, not however visible, granite, mica schist, quartz, jasper and lydian stone, with occasionally pieces of fossil wood. This rubble appears of great extent, and apparently flanks the whole of the Naga range from the Nao Dihing to the Dhunsiri.\n\nIn no part of the hill streams passing through the clay slate is a trace of gold to be found.\n\nThe black debris, dug from the brine springs, contain however much sulphuret of iron. The salzes also which are numerous towards the plains, throw up mud, sand and gravel, impregnated with sulphuret of iron. The gravel in some of them is consolidated to the consistency of rock, composed of minute particles of jasper, quartz and other igneous rocks: this appears stratified, but to what depth is unknown.\n\nIt may be worthy of notice also, that these salzes extend across the Upper Muttuck and shew in their vicinity the same gravel deposits. In the gravel of the Tepuck Jan, an affluent of the Dibroo river, in the North or right bank of that river, traces of gold have been found.\n\nIn the North East section of Assam, that is round from the Nao Dihing at the confluence of the Duffa Panee to the Dihong river, little is known of the nature of the rocks in situ, excepting at dis-\ntant points. The constant landslips that are occurring, would make it difficult to say whether the masses of rock however large, which have been seen, were really in situ, or may not have been detached from their parent site ages ago. We find also large tracts of table-land lying along the edge of the North East mountains, based principally upon well rounded granite and other primitive rock boulders to which, from the apparent great age of the deposit, a source cannot be assigned. However, the rocks in situ which have been noted by Wilcox, in his journey from the Nao Dihing to Bot Khampti across the Great Duffa range, are conglomerate and coarse sandstone near the Dihing, and gneiss passing into mica slate, sienite and clay slate, on the high ridges. Inland from the Brama Koond in the line of the Brahmapooter and its tributaries in the Mishmee country also, granite, granite gneiss, sienitic granite, sienite, greenstone, serpentine, gneiss passing into mica slate, primitive limestone and hornblend rock;\u2014primitive limestone of a bluish grey and white, seems to be a very common rock. I observed the rocks in the river below, and at the Brama Koond were a stratified heavy schistose rock passing into chlorate slate, and serpentine apparently. Between the Koond and the Degaroo river and its sources, Wilcox marks the rocks as limestone, and the boulders of this, which are annually brought down by the Degaroo, show the existence of this stratum. A dirty white primitive limestone associated with sandstone in large masses, is also visible near the gorge of the Dihong river. Most of the landslips appear to be a quartz or feltzpar rock of a reddish or greenish colour with veins of decomposing feltzpar interspersed, the powder of which from some of the scar appears to be kaolin.\n\nIn the beds of the rivers in the tract of country defined, we find the boulders composed of all the rocks before-mentioned, with many varieties, and the addition of trap, porphyry, basalt and white quartz. The last prevails in the bed of the Brahmapooter, the former in the Dihong and Debong. In two of the small tributaries of the Dihong, on the Assam side of the gorge, hard conglomerates and jasper rocks are in situ.\n\nThe mountainous region within the points here noted, and which encircle the head of the Assam valley, cannot be considered as a\ncontinuation of the great Himalayah, though their height ranges from 7 to 8,000 feet, and at one point the Duffa Bhoom reaches to 14,500, and the Thigoroe, twenty miles North of the Brahmapooter at Saikwah, 11,000. These mountains are evidently the Udaya, or \"mountains of the rising sun\" of the Hindus. The true Himalayah appear to end in a direction nearly North of Dibrooghur in Latitude 28.40, or 29 probably\u2014and from the gorge of the Dihong several hill ranges diverge to the S. W. and West: that which bounds the Assam plain is not more than sixteen miles distant from the Brahmapooter. The intervening country is a deposit of no great age, and has no doubt been formed by the Lohita or Dihong, which is known to have run under these hills. The small rivers passing through this tract have their sources a short distance within the hills, and are all auriferous in their pebbly beds. They are the Sillee, Deema, Dirgemo, Seesee, and Dob. The rock strata of the hills are sedimentary\u2014one, a coarse grit composed of granite debris\u2014another finer and of a bluish colour containing sulphuret of iron\u2014both appear to imbed lignites and fossil wood. The boulders in the rivers, besides those of the grits noticed, are of the older rocks, such as are found in the larger rivers to the East, with the exception of the serpentine. In and about the gorge of the Seesee, it was observed that the sedimentary rock rested on a stratum of rubble of these older rocks cemented together by a ferruginous sand containing gold. This sedimentary rock stratum is of great thickness within the hills, and a similar deposit is to be found along the line of hills further to the West: near the gorge of the Boroli Gunga in the Chardwar district, a tuffaceous limestone is in situ. Salzes also, similar to those on the South side of the valley, are very common, and it is an interesting geological fact, that, as the stratum on the Southern mountains is tilted up at an angle of 45\u00b0 to the East, the sedimentary rock stratum of these hills is tilted up to the North West and West, and the stratum of the Brahma Koond to the North East.\n\nThe granites, primitive limestone and serpentine are highly metaliferous. Black magnetic oxide is to be found in the first and last named rock, and sulphuret of iron in the limestone. In the ore found in some of the serpentines there are traces of copper if not\nof silver: and what is called the gold-washer's sand (the Schlich of the Bohemians) contains universally the different oxides of iron and other minerals, with minute crystals of quartz and precious stones.\n\nIn regard to the manipulation or washing of the auriferous sands according to the methods in use with different people in the East, after reading the description given in Lecture IV. of the \"Lectures on Gold,\" delivered at the Museum of Practical Geology, it is evident that the principle adopted by gold-washers of all countries in the washing of auriferous rubble, and the object, that of washing out all useless matter, so as to leave nothing but the oxide of iron and its associated gold dust, is the same. The Chinese have a trough with cleets and transverse grooves. The Assamese generally wash in a trough and take the whole stuff in the rough, the finer sand, &c., being washed into the trough through a bamboo grating or sieve placed at the higher end, and although for want of cleets there is some loss, it is wonderful to see with what dexterity the left hand is used to keep the dust at the head of the trough, and to allow of a constant stream of water passing down its slope, thus washing the stuff thoroughly in a very short time and leaving nothing but the very finest of the Schlich with its gold dust. This trough might be improved, but as it is light, and one man can work it easily, being supplied with material by a boy, and one man to dig, it answers the purpose\u2014and when gold is plentiful, this is the cheapest method of labour which could be employed in Assam. The oval board in use with the Singphoes appears to me, however, in dexterous hands to be equal to any trough\u2014and provided the stuff could be given to the washer after having been passed through a sieve, I reckon this to be the best and cheapest method of extracting the gold dust\u2014for not only does an expert gold-washer wash clean every particle of oxide and gold contained in a given quantity of rubble, but he will after the day's labour is over, take the Schlich and gold dust on the board, and by a peculiar dexterity of hand with the board and the water, wash away every particle of the former, leaving the latter at the head of the board with little necessity for quicksilver to lick it up, as generally done to prepare it for melting.\n\nDibrooghur, June, 1853.\nCatalogue of Reptiles inhabiting the Peninsula of India.\u2014By T.

It was at Jalnah and about 14 inches long. It was red beneath the tail and was very bold. Scut\u00e6 234. Scutell\u00e6 28. 13 rows of scales.*\n\nElaps malabaricus\u2014n. s.\n\nHead black with transverse bands, body brown above with black markings, bright red beneath. Scut\u00e6 246. Scutell\u00e6 38. 13 rows of scales. Tail exceeds \u00bcth of total length.\n\nI have found this little snake in forest in Malabar, once or twice during the monsoon. The red colour of the abdomen fades in spirits.\n\nBungarus candidus\u2014L., Russell 1, pl. 1.\n\nB. semi-fasciatus, Schl. \u2018Yenna vyrien\u2019 of the Tamools. Up to 8 feet in length. Is very common all over Southern India, and is said to be fatal. Scut\u00e6 217. Scutell\u00e6 39.\n\nThis snake may be distinguished from one or two harmless species that much resemble it in colour, by the sub-caudal scutell\u00e6 being in one row, not double.\n\nBungarus fasciatus\u2014Russell 1, pl. 8.\n\nGolden banded bungarum.\n\nI have only seen specimens of this handsome snake in the Northern Circars at Ganjam, where it is not very common.

It was $12\\frac{1}{2}$ feet long. Scut\u00e6 225. Sub-caudal do. 12. Scutell\u00e6 64.\n\nI am inclined to think that it may be a different species from the Bengal serpent, for it was of an uniform dark olive colour above, without any appearance of bands. The specimen was unfortunately destroyed.*\n\nNAIA LUTESCENS\u2014Russ. 1, pl. 6. Cobra.\n\nNAGA PAMBU, or NELLA PAMBU\u2014Tam. But too common all over India.\n\nSub-Fam.

I have not seen it longer than 16 or 17 inches.\n\nTRIGONOCEPHALUS ELLIOTTI\u2014n. s.\n\nForm massive; 23 rows of scales on the body; Scut\u00e6 151, Scutell\u00e6 43. Olive-green above; pearl-white beneath; poison-fangs small; head covered with plates. Up to 2 feet and upwards long.\n\nI have only procured this on the Neelgherries towards the lower portion of the plateau. Dr. Cantor tells me that \"the shields of the crown of the head resemble those of Trig. blanchoffi, Schlegel.\n\nTRIGONOCEPHALUS (COPHIAS) VIRIDIS\u2014Merrem.

Scut\u00e6 145 to 149. Scutell\u00e6 48 to 53. Green above, with brown transverse and zigzag markings. Up to 2 feet long nearly. Not uncommon in all the forests of the West Coast.\n\n* One, 9 ft. long, which I procured about 20 miles S. of Calcutta, and now in the Society's Museum, is banded throughout. Senkeshar and Shaka-muti, Beng. Cur. As. Soc.\nTRIGONOCEPHALUS (COPHIAS) NEELGHERRIENSIS\u2014n. s.\n\nOf small size, dark brown with black markings. 23 rows of carinated scales. Scut\u00e6 142. Scutell\u00e6 36. Not uncommon in woods on the Neelgherries.\n\nTRIGONOCEPHALUS (COPHIAS) WARDII\u2014n. s. ?\n\nHas 21 rows of carinated scales. Scut\u00e6 154. Scutell\u00e6 51. Greenish colour, with purplish-brown diamond spots on back and sides; 12 to 14 inches long. The scales of the head resemble those of T. sumatranus, Raffles, according to Cantor (in litoris).\n\nVIPERA RUSSELLII\u2014Gray. Russell 1, pl. 7.\n\n'KUNNADI VYRIEN' of Tamools.\n\nThis well known and justly dreaded snake grows to a large size. I am strongly inclined to believe that the far-famed Cobra monil, or Cobra manilla of some, is merely the young of this species. The old orthography is monil, which simply means a chain or necklace, and whoever looks at the markings of this snake, especially of the young one, must be struck with the resemblance thereof to a necklace. I need hardly remind the reader that both Cobra capella and Cobra monil are Portuguese names, and I have little doubt, that the latter name was given to our present species by the Portuguese. It has however been forgotten as applied to this viper, and may now be considered a fable; for every one you meet is able, on his own showing, to point you out the real Cobra monil as quite distinct, and what is more remarkable, no two observers describe it alike, they only agree in its being a very small and a very deadly snake. I may here add that the carpet snake, another household word in the Madras army, appears to me to be equally fabulous, as I have not been able to identify it among the venomous snakes, several prettily marked innocent species having been, at different times pointed out to me as the carpet snake.*\n\nVIPERA ECHIS\u2014Schlegel. V. noratta\u2014Shaw. Russell 1, pl. 2.\n\nKUTTA VYRIEN of the Tamools.\n\nThis little snake is very common in the Carnatic. I do not think its bite would prove fatal to man. I have known a dog bitten by one to recover.\n\n* Generally, I think, the little harmless Lyodon aulicus (as indeed mentioned afterwards by Mr. Jerdon); and this, perhaps, from its habit of entering houses as much as from its markings.\u2014Cmr. As. Soc.\nThe above are all the venomous land snakes I have yet met with in Southern India. Of these the only ones at all common are the Cobra, the Chain Viper (Vipera Russellii), the Bungarus candidus, and the little Vipera echis. Most of the others are peculiar to the forests of India. The Trigonocephali are not usually fatal. I have known several cases of bites by Trigonocephalus malabaricus, and Trig. nepa; and none proved fatal. Great pain is experienced, and swelling usually follows, but the patient gradually recovers. I myself was bitten in the fore-finger by the Trigonocephalus neelgherriensis; I applied a ligature round the finger, and sucked the wound vigorously. In a minute or so the skin round the bite blackened; and in a minute or two more a perfectly circular bit of the skin came off in my mouth. I set off running immediately I was bitten, and felt no further ill effects. See Cantor's remarks on the bite of Trig. sumatranus, Journ. As. Soc., Calcutta, XVI, 1044-6; also Blyth, ibid. XX, 524.\n\nPELAGIC.\n\nFam. HYDRID\u00c6,\u2014Bon.\n\nHydrophis colubrina\u2014Schlegel, var.?\u2014n. s.\n\nI possess what is apparently a variety of this species of sea-snake. It differs from the finished drawing of the species in Cuvier's R\u00e9gne Animal (Edit. des \u00c9l\u00e8ves), in the black markings meeting on the back and abdomen, thus forming a series of light-coloured oval spots on the sides; the abdominal scutes commence nearer the mouth, having only 3 or 4 series of small scales between them and the elongated mentals; the scutes are above 300 in number, and the rows of scales are from 35 to 45\u2014whilst in H. colubrina the scutes are only 246\u2014and the rows of scales 26. My only specimen is a young one procured at Madras.\n\nHydrus schistosus, Daud.\u2014Russel 2, pl. 10. Up to 4 feet long nearly. Very common at Madras.\n\nHydrus pelamidoides, Schlegel. Not common at Madras.\n\nHydrus bicolor, Schneider\u2014Russell 1, pl. 41. Rare at Madras.\n\nHydrus striatus, Lacep.\u2014Russell 2, pl. 9? Not rare at Madras, up to 6 feet in length.\n\nHydrus nieboqinctus, Daudin.\u2014Russell 2, pl. 6. Common at Madras.\nHydrus Cantori, n. s.\u2014H. nigrocinctus, var.\u2014Cantor, J. A. S. C. XVI, 1050.\n\nDr. Cantor described this as a variety of the last, in his valuable Catalogue of Malay Reptiles.\n\nI forwarded him a specimen in 1848, and he remarked as follows on it. \"From the examination of this specimen, the second I have seen, I am induced to believe it a distinct species, and not a variety of nigrocinctus.\" It differs from this last species in the more robust make, larger scales, there being only 21 rows on the body, and larger abdominal scales especially near the head; also in the shorter triangular head, &c. &c.\n\nI never saw it at Madras, but it is not rare at Tellicherry on the Malabar Coast. Up to 2 feet in length.\n\nHydrus gracilis, Shaw\u2014Russell 2, pls. 7 and 8.\n\nThe number of rows of scales varies from 26 to 35 on the neck, and from 44 to 51 on the trunk. Scut\u00e6 350 to 450. Scutell\u00e6 50 to 60. Very common at Madras.\n\nVery remarkable for the small circumference of head and neck compared to that of the body.\n\nVery common at Madras. Up to 4 feet long.\n\nAll the above sea-snakes are venomous, and their bite to be dreaded.\n\nFam. BOID\u00c6\u2014Bon.\n\nAcrochordus granulatus, (Schneider)\u2014A. fasciatus, Shaw.\n\nRare\u2014Found sometimes in back-waters.\n\nPython molurus, (L.)\u2014P. trivittatus, Schl.\u2014Russell 1, pl. 22. Boa, or Rock snake, of Europeans in Madras.\n\nFound all over the country. I have not seen a specimen longer than 19 feet long. This was killed in Travancore, after having swallowed a doe spotted deer.\n\nBoa (Gongylophis) conica, Schl.\u2014Russell 1, pl. 4.\n\nNot rare in the Carnatic and Malabar. It is considered venomous by some of the natives. Has a very malignant aspect. Up to 18 inches long and upwards.\n**Xenopeltis? trivirgatus**\u2014n. s.\n\nBrown above, with a triple series of black marks\u2014beneath white, black-banded; of a shining nacreous lustre throughout. Scut\u00e6 137. Scutell\u00e6 29. 13 rows of scales. I have only found this on the Neelgherries.\n\n**Tortrix eryx**, Schlegel\u2014var.?\n\nTwo-headed snake of many\u2014common. Scut\u00e6 205. Scutell\u00e6 86.\n\n**Cylindrophis maculatus**? ?*\n\n**Cylindrophis cueticeps**\u2014n. s.?\n\nDiffers from the last in its shorter, more triangular head, &c. &c.\n\n**Cylindrophis macroscelis**\u2014n. s.?\n\nDiffers from both in the much larger scales. These last 3 small species are not very common. They are sometimes found on the surface of the ground in rainy weather, but are generally dug out of the earth. They are called earth-snakes by the natives.\n\nFam. **Typhlophid\u00e6**.\n\n**Pilidion? montanum**\u2014n. s.?\n\nAbove bluish-black, yellow on the sides, with a black spot on each of the 3 lower scales; abdomen banded black and white.

Found only on the Neelgherries.\n\n**Uropeltis ceylonicus**.\n\n**Uropeltis affinis**\u2014n. s.\n\nDiffers from the last in its smaller scales, in the abdominal scut\u00e6 being larger, and commencing sooner.\n\nThey are both rare. I procured them on the Western Coast.\n\n**Onychocephalus acutus**\u2014Dum. et Bibr.\n\nI possess one example of this curious reptile, which I procured in the Carnatic at Nellore. Dr. Cantor remarks, \"Described from an unique specimen, habitat unknown.\"\n\n**Typhlops braminus**, (Daud.)\u2014Russell 1, pl. 43.\u2020\n\nCommon under stones in the rainy season, usually called earthworm.\n\n* This, Dr. Kelaart has sent to the Society's Museum from Ceylon. *Cur. As. Soc.*\n\n\u2020 This group, the Argyrophis of Mr. Gray, requires to be studied, as several species appear at present to be confounded. The Society's Museum has lately received Typhlops Russellii, Gray, from Chyebasa. *Cur. As. Soc.*\nCALAMARIA SAGITTARIA\u2014Cantor.\n\nA specimen sent to Dr. Cantor was so named by him; it had only 170 Scut\u00e6 and 70 Scutell\u00e6.

Scutell\u00e6 41.\n\nThis species is referred to Tropidonotus stolatus by Cantor, but a snake that I possess and which answers tolerably well to Russell's description and figure appears to be a true Coronella. It is common at Madras.\n\nXENODON VENUSTUM, n. s.?\u2014[X. PURPURASCENS, Schlegel].\n\nAbove olive-brown with a triple series of irregular black spots, the central one edged with pale yellow; some transverse marks on head and neck. Has 17 rows of scales.

My specimens have only from 165 to 174 scut\u00e6 and from 54 to 61 scutell\u00e6, which correspond with Russell's nearly, viz. from 171 to 174 and 40 to 41, whilst Cantor gives from 208 to 257 and from 57 to 91. One specimen which resembles in colour Cantor's var. B, (Lycodon capucinus, Boie,) does not differ in number of the scut\u00e6, &c. Very common all over the country, often called Carpet Snake and considered dangerous, though of course harmless.\n\nLYCODON PLATURINUS, (Shaw.)\n\nScut\u00e6 188. Scutell\u00e6 76.

Very common in all parts of the country.\n\n**Leptophis? Bellii?**\u2014n. s.\n\nScutes 178. Scutellae 64. Green above, with dark line on the sides bordered on each side by a pale stripe\u201417 rows of scales. This much resembles the drawing of *Ahaetula Bellii* in Grey and Hardwicke. I procured one specimen in a grassy plain at Jalmah. It had killed and was swallowing a small *Vipera echis*.\n\n**Leptophis ornatus**, Shaw.\u2014Russ. 2, pl. 2.\n\nScutes 209. Scutellae 129\u201417 rows of scales. I have only procured this very handsome snake lately in Malabar.\n\n**Leptophis? nilagiricus?**\u2014n. s.\n\nGreen above, yellow beneath. Scutes 140. Scutellae 78\u201413 rows of scales. Very common on the grassy hills of the Neelgherries.\nLEPTOPHIS? CANARENSIS?\n\nGreen above, yellowish beneath with a streak on the sides. Scut\u00e6 140. Scutell\u00e6 57\u201415 rows of scales. Procured in North Canara.\n\nPerhaps these two last belong more properly to Dryinus. Of the last Dr. Cantor remarks\u2014\"Apparently Dryinus prasinus, var.

Scut\u00e6 222; Scutell\u00e6 91\u201425 rows of scales. It is possible that this may be H. helena, as I possess a young one in which the markings differ somewhat, and much resemble those on Russell's figure, which is evidently a very bad one.* I have procured it in Malabar where it is not very rare.\n\nTROPIDONOTUS STOLATUS, (L.)\u2014Russell 1, pl. 10 and 11.\n\nScut\u00e6 146; Scutell\u00e6 61\u201419 rows of scales.

Rare\u2014found in a few tanks in the Carnatic.\n\n*Rana malabarica*.\nFound only on the West Coast, and chiefly during the monsoon when it enters houses, and makes a great gobbling, so much like a turkey that some people call it the 'Turkey frog.'\n\n*Rana flavescens*,\u2014n. s.\nOf a buff colour on the back; yellow on the sides; limbs banded; feet webbed nearly to the extremities. Length of one 3\u00bdths; hind leg 5\u00bd. Of slender make, pointed muzzle.\nFound frequenting mountain streams in the forests only.\n\n* Probably a distinct species from E. glutinosum of Ceylon, as sent by Dr. Kelaart. The latter has a strongly marked pale lateral band, and the cirri are less developed than they are represented to be in Mr. Jerdon's drawing. Dr. Kelaart, however, obtained a second species, which may be that noticed by Mr. Jerdon; and either may be identical with the Epicrium from Assam and from Pinang.\u2014Cur. As.

Soc.\nCatalogues of Oriental Libraries, by Dr. A. Sprenger, Secretary, Asiatic Society, Bengal.\n\nCertain it is that mankind would not lose much in arts and sciences, if all works in Eastern languages were destroyed. They contain few facts, if any, in Astronomy, Medicine, Mathematics, Natural History, or any other science, which are new to us. Even in poetry and philosophy, their works contain few sentiments or ideas which we can admire or would like to adopt.\n\nA century or two ago people thought if they could only understand the language of birds, these disinterested bipeds would reveal to them where treasures are hidden, they would teach them the mysteries of nature, and enlighten them on the most important questions connected with our existence. In like manner some persons thought that in those venerable looking old oriental manuscripts, every science under the sun was locked up. Naturalists and orientalists have dug up their respective vineyards. Treasures they found none, but both parties have rendered the soil fertile. Naturalists, though they have learned no mysteries from the speeches of birds, have founded a noble science by dissecting their bodies, studying and comparing their physiology, observing their habits, and following up their geographical distribution. Man is a nobler object of study than birds, and the philosophy of history is a higher pursuit than the philosophy of nature. The acquaintance with the literature of the east shows us man reflected in his own creation under peculiar circumstances and through a longer period than the literatures of Europe exhibit him. The student is carried beyond the narrow limits of European prejudices and associations and enabled to enlarge them. Taking a historical view of oriental pursuits, they are of the highest philosophical importance. Moreover, in India a knowledge of the eastern languages both dead and living, and an acquaintance with their literatures, is the first condition for acting upon the natives, for making oneself useful.\n\nIt is from this wish to enlarge our knowledge of man and of his creations under various circumstances and in various periods of his historical existence, that several Governments and Institutions of Europe have of late taken measures to have catalogues raisonn\u00e9es of\ntheir collections of Oriental Manuscripts published, and others, we are informed, are still in preparation. In No. CCXXXV. of this Journal, the catalogue of the Asiatic Museum of St. Petersburgh has been noticed. Accounts of the catalogue of the library of Upsala and of that of Haven are in the Journal of the German Asiatic Society, and Professor Hall has promised us a notice of the first volume of the catalogue of the Royal Library of Berlin containing Sanscrit MSS. Among the catalogues which are preparing for the press is Forbes's catalogue of the Persian MSS. of the British Museum, and Mordey's and Bland's catalogues of the Persian books of the India House library and the Persian books of the Bodleyan library. But the most important work in preparation, is a catalogue of the libraries of Constantinople, which is being compiled by order of the Sultan.\n\nThe catalogus Codicum Orient. Bibl. Acad. Lugduno-Batava, 1851, Autore Dozy, of which two volumes have been published, deserves a short account here, because the collection of oriental MSS. of Leyden is one of the best in Europe, and it has hitherto been by far the most useful. Professor Dozy has displayed very great judgment and learning in his labour, and his is probably the best oriental catalogue, that has yet been published.\n\nThese two volumes contain eleven chapters, and will be continued by another savant, Professor Dozy being no longer in charge of the oriental library of Leyden. I will mention here shortly a few of the most interesting books contained in each chapter with the numbers they have in the catalogue.\n\n1 Chapter; Encyclop\u00e6dias.\n\nNo. 2, \u0645\u0641\u0627\u062a\u06cc\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 by Ab\u00fa 'abd Allah.

In the Leyden library is\nthe third and last volume of this important work, and at Paris is the\nfirst of the same copy; a complete copy has been sent from Constan-\ntinople to the Paris library by Baron de Slane. This book contains\nshort biographies of all Arabic authors and the names of all their works,\nand is one of the most precious relics of antiquity we possess.\n\n2 Chapter; Grammar.\n\nNos. 89, 42, 44 and 46 are specimens of the manner in which\nGrammar was treated during the earliest period of Arabic literature,\nand they are precious on account of their rarity. There is nothing\nelse of much importance in this chapter.\n\n3 Chapter; Lexicography.\n\nNos. 142 and 143 are two valuable copies of two valuable works\nof Ibn al-Sikkyt, a grammarian of the third century, but the most\nimportant work in this chapter is No. 116\u2014the Jamharah of Ibn\nDorayd. To the best of my knowledge there is only one copy of\nit in India, and that not a very good one.\n\nNo. 146. \u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0644\u0637\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0645 is usually ascribed to \u00c7adr aldyn\nand Q\u016bnyaww (on whom see J\u00e1my, Naf\u0101h\u0101t, No. 538) and not\nto Mo\u1e25y\u012b aldyn Ibn al'araby. I have two copies of this work, 'abd\nal-Razz\u0101q's \u00c7ufy Dictionary is an abridgment of it.\n\nPassing over the next three chapters, we come to Belles-lettres,\nhere the first book of great importance is the K\u0101mil of al-Mobar-\nrad, No. 365, (I have seen the name written with a Kasrah \"Mobar-\nrad,\") it is not only valuable for philology but also for history,\ncontaining the best account of the Khaw\u0101rij. There is a very cor-\nrect MS. of it at Lucnow which has been copied for me; Mr.\nWright has promised to edit it. Nos. 366 containing the Mowash-\nsh\u0101 of Ab\u016b-l-Tayyib and 367 are still rarer and nearly as important.\nThe latter No. contains an old copy of a work in which Ibn Dorayd,\nwho died in 321, has collected words and idiomatic phrases referring to\nthe saddle and bridle. This and Nos. 368 and 369 are among the few\nremaining specimens of the hundreds of works of the same nature,\nwhich were compiled during the first three centuries of the Isl\u0101m.\nSeveral of the treasures contained in the chapter on Arabic poetry are already known to the public, at least by name, as the Ham\u00e1sah, the Dyw\u00e1n of the Hodzaylites, the collection of ancient poems of Ibn al\u2019araby, &c. A splendid old copy of Tibryzy\u2019s commentary on the Ham\u00e1sah is at Cawnpore, and I possess a copy of the commentary of Ab\u00fa \u2019allyy.\n\nThe only poetical work in Persian which deserves notice is the Rawshan\u00e1y n\u00e1mah of N\u00e1cir Khosraw whose takhaluq was Hojjat (No. 630). It is stated that it was composed in 343, but must be a mistake of the copyist for \u062c\u0627\u0631\u0645, for N\u00e1cir Khosraw was a contemporary of the F\u00e1timite Khalyfah Mostan\u00e7ir who succeeded in 427 and died in 487, and many poems of his Dyw\u00e1n are in his praise.\n\nThe library of Leyden possesses great treasures in history and geography, but owing to the liberal rules of the university, they have been much explored by orientalists of all countries, and are therefore generally known.\n\nAnd what has India done in the way of preserving a record of the thousands of books which are moldering in its libraries, and annually destroyed by insects? I should not have ventured to ask this question if it could not be satisfactorily answered. Sir Henry Elliot\u2019s Indic Historians is a work of too high an order than that it could be called a catalogue. It is a historical book. But there are other works in progress which in extent will far surpass any thing that has been done in Europe. Dr. Ballantyne and Professor Hall are preparing a catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of the Sanscrit MSS. of the Benares College, which in fact will be a general bibliography of Sanscrit literature, and Professor Hall is preparing at the same time a detailed account of near two thousand Hindi works of which hitherto hardly two dozens have been imperfectly known. The value of this publication for India will be incalculable. He has promised us an account of his labours, which, I hope, we shall soon receive for insertion in this Journal.\n\nThe Honourable Court of Directors has sanctioned the publication of the Catalogue of the Lucnow libraries, and 448 pages of it are printed. The sciences are not classed according to any logical arrangement, but those which are usually cultivated by the same class of men are grouped together in separate volumes, so that every\nvolume is in some way complete in itself and has separate indices. The great extent of the works renders such an arrangement desirable, in order that if it should not be completed, as much as may be published may be complete in itself. To every science, a chapter is prefixed containing the biographical works devoted to those men who were distinguished in that science: to the section on traditions, a chapter will be prefixed containing works on the biographies of person who collected traditions, in like manner to the section on law the biographies of Jurisconsults will be prefixed, &c. In imitation of Baron von Hammer-Purgstall and other orientalists, of biographical works, generally, a table of contents is given containing the names, principal dates and the titles of the writings of the subjects of the biographies. These chapters are therefore of considerable length. Of other works only the title of the book, a short account of the author, if none be contained in the chapter on biography, a short notice of the contents of the book, the date and the authorities on which it is founded\u2014if they are quoted\u2014the size and the collection in which the book is found are mentioned: At the end of each volume three indices will be added, one of names of persons and places, one of book-titles and one of the initial lines.\n\nThe first 174 pages of the portion printed contain an account of 41 Persian Tadzkirahs, there is besides a Persian Tadzkirah mentioned under No. 62, and three or four will be mentioned in the appendix, they having come to hand after the above pages had gone through the press. Of several of these Tadzkirahs or biographies of Persian poets, a table of contents is given.\n\nFrom page 175 to 192 twenty biographical works of R\u00e9khtah poets are enumerated, and from page 195 to page 306 is a table of contents of the R\u00e9khtah Tadzkirahs containing in alphabetical order short notices of upwards of fifteen hundred R\u00e9khtah poets.\n\nIn page 307 begins the second chapter containing the works of Persian poets alphabetically arranged according to their takhalluq. The 142 pages which are printed of this chapter contain 286 numbers, the last name is that of J\u00e1my, so that more than one half of the chapter remains to be printed. The remaining chapters of this volume will contain the works of R\u00e9khtah poets, Dictionaries and Grammars of the Persian language, Insh\u00e1s and tales in Persian, Grammars\nNotes upon a Tour in the Sikkim Himalayah Mountains.\n\nAnd Dictionaries and Tales in Urd\u00fa, translations from Sanscrit Hindi into Persian and Urd\u00fa, and Chaghat\u00e1y and Pusht\u00fa books.\n\nAt the end there will be an appendix of corrigenda and addenda. If the whole catalogue is completed, it will be an infinitely fuller and more correct bibliographical work of reference than H\u00e1j\u00ed K\u00e1lyfah's Bibliographical Dictionary.\n\nRev. J. Long's Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9 of Beng\u00e1li works has been already adverted to in this Journal, (ante vol. XXI. p. 632). It includes notices of upwards of thirteen hundred works, and we have no doubt, prove a valuable index to the vernacular literature of Bengal.\n\nNotes upon a Tour in the Sikkim Himalayah Mountains, undertaken for the purpose of ascertaining the Geological Formation of Kunchinjinga and of the perpetually snow-covered peaks in its vicinity.\n\n\u2014By Captain WALTER STANHOPE SHEERWILL, Revenue Surveyor.\n\nAn unusually severe earthquake, that occurred at Darjeeling during the month of May, 1852, threw down several thousand square yards of the South Western face of the perpetually snow-covered mountain Kunchinjinga,* exposing a dark mass of rock, rendered dark perhaps by the brilliancy of the snow surrounding it. By the aid of a good telescope, the distance being forty-five miles, I could plainly perceive that the geological formation of Kunchinjinga was not of granite, as I had read it was only a few days previous, but of a highly stratified nature, the strata being, by the aid of a telescope distinctly visible. The statement that the snowy-mountains near Kunchinjinga were of granite was published in a Botanical Magazine published in England, Dr. J. D. Hooker being the author.\n\n* For the derivation and meaning of this word I am indebted to Lieut. G. Mainwaring of the 16th Bengal Grenadiers, who, with a praiseworthy industry, has mastered the Lepcha language, and was, in 1852, engaged upon the study of the Tibetan. The word is Tibetan and means,\n\n| English pronunciation | Tibetan equivalents | English |\n|----------------------|---------------------|---------|\n| Kon                  | Khng-a              | Snow    |\n| Chin                 | Chhn                | full or covered. |\n| Jong                 | b'jonga             | Coeval or equal to |\n\nHeight above the sea, 28,177 feet (Waugh), the highest measured mountain in the world.\nthe statement. Being anxious to settle the question I determined to travel as far North toward the foot of the snowy range as possible, and thus by diminishing the distance between myself and the exposed flanks of the mountain to obtain a clearer and nearer view of its lithological formation.\n\nBeing quite aware from the peculiar shape of the mountain and of its neighbouring peaks, that by advancing towards the snows by the valleys leading up towards Kunchinjinga, I should speedily lose sight of the mountain altogether, I determined to advance along the crest of the great meridional spur Singaleela, which, from Darjeeling, appears to be connected directly with Kunchinjinga. Dr. Hooker's map of Sikkim also leads one to suppose that such is the fact, such however, is not the case as will be shewn hereafter.\n\n2nd August, 1852. Having waited patiently for nearly three months since the earthquake exposed the flank of Kunchinjinga in order to allow the snow to reach its highest summer limit, I started this morning at 8.30 A.M. accompanied by Mr. Robert Smart, my second assistant in the Survey. Having just completed the Survey of the British Hill Territory, and having had several very fatiguing trips in the hills we were both in good walking trim, and had by our former experience learnt to travel lightly.\n\nAs we left the station of Darjeeling* the sun was shining most brilliantly, illuminating the snowy range to a silvery whiteness. As we turned the shoulder of Birch Hill, the most northerly point of the station, a splendid Panorama of all the country to the west and north of Darjeeling lay before us, a scene perhaps unequalled in beauty in the whole world. To the west the Singaleela range with its numerous peaks of 12,000 feet in height, its thousand buttresses composed of swelling mountains clothed with fir and rhododendron forests, shut out our view. To the north and in the centre of the Panorama stands Kunchinjinga, 28,177 feet in height, flanked on either side by numerous peaks scarcely inferior in height. To the east, the snowy range trending away to the south, and which is adorned with many fine bold and imposing peaks, forms the limit to the view. The lower unsnowed but forest-clad mountains Powhunry, Tendong, Pemionchi, Hee, Chakoong, Kirmee, and a hundred others\n\n*i.e. Dorje the sceptre of the priesthood, \"ling,\" a place, \"The holy spot.\"\nall separated by deep valleys, through which flow impetuous torrents, and in one of which was visible the Great Rungeet pouring along 6,000 feet below us, form the most appropriate, because grand and beautiful foreground to the lofty, and perpetually snow-covered Himalayah, some of whose perpetually snow-covered peaks are only thirty miles distant. The air was so pure that the distance appeared reduced to five or six miles, and with a telescope rocks that had been hurled down by earthquakes, were seen reposing upon the green glaciers between Kunchinjinga and Pudeem mountains, doubtless on their way to the Moraines at the foot of the glaciers.\n\nThe descent from Darjeeling by the Tuqvor-spur to the little Rungeet river, is by a good Government road, and can be ridden upon the whole way down, which we did passing rapidly through the various botanical regions, or through oak, chesnut, maple, olive, walnut, birch, magnolia, to palms, tree-ferns, ratans: at 5,000 cultivation is met with, comprising barley, wheat, maize, buckwheat, rice, &c. then through Gordonia, pandanus, banian-trees, wormwood, twelve feet in height, to the Little Rungeet river 1,996 feet above the sea, which we reached in two hours and a quarter, having descended 5,169 feet.\n\nThe forest at 6,000 is peculiarly beautiful; the oaks, magnolias and other large trees being covered with gigantic pothos, epiphytical ferns, arums, and enormous creepers resembling ship's cables; the underwood consists of the tree-fern, some of which measure fifty feet in height and fifteen feet in girth at the base of the stem. The gracefulness of this botanical beauty can only be described by the pencil not by words.\n\nTemperature of the air at Darjeeling 65\u00b0 Faht.; at the little Rungeet at noon 89\u00b0; at 2 p.m. 91\u00b050'; temperature of the water 71\u00b0.\n\nThe little Rungeet which rises from the mountain Tongloo falls into the great Rungeet, three miles further down, and is here crossed by a substantial cane-bridge. The main chains supporting the bridge are composed of five ratan-canies each; the sides are of split cane hanging from either main chain as loops, two feet apart and three feet deep; into these loops, the platform is laid composed of three bamboos, the size of a man's arm, laid side to side; the section of the bridge resembling the letter V.; in the angle or base of the letter the traveller finds footing. This being a Government bridge\nand kept in proper order, the platform or bridge is about a foot in width. Those bridges that are constructed by the natives have only one single bamboo for the feet to rest upon; and across these frail bridges, the most wild and turbulent streams are crossed with safety. Outriggers, to prevent the main chains being brought together with the weight of the passenger, are rigged out at every ten or twelve feet, in the following manner: under the platform, and at right angles to it or parallel to the stream, strong bamboos are passed, and from their extremities to the main chains, split ratan-ropes are firmly tied; this prevents the hanging loop or bridge from shutting up and choking the passenger. The piers of these bridges are generally two convenient trees, through whose branches the main chains are passed and pegged into the ground on the opposite side.\n\nThe bridge over the Runguet is about fifty yards in span, and fifteen feet above the stream. Across this narrow bridge I was surprised to see a hill dog trot, apparently quite regardless of the raging torrent beneath him.\n\nThe water being too rapid for the passage of our ponies, they were sent back from the right bank of the river, and from this spot our wanderings commenced on foot.\n\nAt this spot which is twenty-two miles in a direct line from the plains, and nearly 2,000 feet above the sea, I observed termites or white-ants who, under the shelter of their pierced earthen covering, were destroying the bark of an oak-tree. The many varieties of lepidoptera and dragon-flies that were fluttering about the gneiss rocks were remarkable for their great numbers and beauty.\n\nOn our way down the hill our attention was markedly arrested by a flock of birds\u2014which our Lepchas described as being about the size of a black-bird and of a black and white plumage, for we did not get a glimpse of them\u2014whose united voices exactly resembled a set of human maniacs screaming and laughing in horrid chorus. I never remember to have heard such a peculiarly wild and attention-riveting sound as the voice of these birds; it was perfectly startling.\n\nLeft the Runguet at 2 p.m. and ascended to the Goke guardhouse, in an hour. The forest is particularly beautiful, the fici on a grand scale being the most remarkable feature in the forest. It is interesting to trace amongst the various specimens of this natural\nand D\nHindi\nAt t\nIf the\nand mo\nlyfah's\nRev.\nalready\ninclude\nwe have\nof Beng\nNotes u\nfor t\nchinj\n\u2014By\n\nAn un\nthe mon\nof the S\ntain Ku\nperhaps\nof a go\nplainly l\nnot of g\na highly\ndistinctl\nKunchin\ngine pub\n\n* For ti\nMainwarin\nmastered t\nTibetan.\n\nEngli:\n\nHeight a\nthe world.\nand beautiful forest.

In places the young fig, only a few inches in height, may be seen at the foot of a noble oak as a humble plant; a little further on, it is seen as a handsome creeper embracing the oak with a thousand tendrils, which expanding and thickening with age, at last coalesce, forming a solid mass of wood which speedily strangles its original support; which, by decaying and falling away, leaves the fig standing, a hollow cylinder sixty or seventy feet in height, with an umbrageous crown of leaves and branches, a far more noble-looking tree than the oak it has killed. Others again trust to themselves entirely, and seek no foreign support; this species is met with at 4,000 feet above the sea; very giants in botany; they generally rest upon three, five or more beautifully-arched stems forty or fifty feet apart, which unite perhaps seventy feet from the ground into one common trunk; from this spot the branches spring to about the same height as the point of junction is from the ground. The beauty of these trees is much added to, by being generally covered with the gigantic pothos, or bignonias, or buteas, or with other enormous creepers whose long stems are seen hanging in wild festoons, some like golden threads and others like ragged and frayed cables of ships: some of the finest specimens of these figs are to be seen close to the staging Bungalow at Kursion, on the road up from the plains to Darjeeling.\n\nThe Goke spur, wherever the road has laid bare the rocks, is found to be composed of a red micaceous schist, and towards the summit, 2,757 feet, of blue slate highly micaceous and separated from the upper or red schist by beds of hornstone.\n\nAt Goke there are eight houses and a guard-house, inhabited by the families of the sepoys on guard at this post. The guard consists of about eight men detached from the sappers and miners at Darjeeling, their duty is to guard the frontier at this spot, and to give the alarm at the approach of any armed men from Sikkim, and to prevent any of the British subjects being taken away as slaves into Sikkim. Similar guards are posted all along the Sikkim frontier, generally at spots where cane-bridges cross the Runguet and Rumman rivers.\n\nTo the north of the Goke spur, and looking down into the valley of the Rumman river, which is seen and heard roaring along its\nrocky bed, the eye wanders over a dense and beautiful forest. The huge buttresses thrown down from Singaleelah shut in the view looking up the valley, and on the opposite side of the Rumman, the steep Chakoong gneiss mountain exhibits numerous land-slips of great beauty. Chakoong is noted for its travertine lime deposits, which appear in the small streams flowing from its steep sides. Our entire march for to-morrow is in view, and a formidable-looking route it is. The Burpung mountain on the Heeloo range was pointed out to us as the spot for our next encampment, which cannot be less than 8,000 feet in height and distant five miles; but these five miles we have to traverse in the hot, dark, and miasmatic valley of the Rumman.\n\nIn the evening I observed several of those strange insects, bocydium, that are covered with snow-white and downy quill-like processes radiating in all directions from their backs. Any attempt to secure the pretty creatures for observation, even supposing they did not escape by hopping away, was a failure; as all their beauty was speedily destroyed with even the most gentle treatment, the slightest touch being sufficient to destroy all their snow-white covering.\n\nThe noise of the cicadas a thousand feet below us in the hot tropical valleys was quite deafening; their peculiar cry is quite distinct from the cicadas of Darjeeling, being louder, more metallic and of longer duration; much more cheerful and more pleasing to the ear. Two Buceros were seen flying over Little Rungeet; these curious birds build their nests in hollow trees, and defend them with great bravery. The Lepchas secure the living birds by putting a net over the orifice of their nests, and sell them at Darjeeling.\n\nFrom the guard-house looking south, a fine cascade is seen dashing down the Tuqvor spur.\n\nCultivated plants observed at Goke were tobacco, tomato, stramonium, banghun, s\u00e9m bean, Indian corn, red spinach, kuddoo, chillies, and French marigold. Wormwood and black pepper were seen wild. Before the doors of several of the houses were baskets containing the new shoots of the bamboo gathered before they force themselves above ground. The shoots are collected, put into baskets, the mouths of which are laden with heavy stones, and placed in the sun for several days, when fermentation takes place; the shoots are then\neaten as pickles, forming a pleasing acidulous adjunct to the Limboo's simple rice diet. The fresh shoots, which I tasted, resemble a new and sweet walnut.\n\n3rd August, 1852, direction North-west.\n\nAt six this morning we descended the steep northern face of the Goke spur by a footpath, along which the Sikkimites attempted an entry into Darjeeling, during the late disturbances. I measured the slope of the path and found it to be $30^\\circ$, a most uncomfortable gradient for a rough and narrow footpath flanked on one hand by a nearly precipitous descent, down which Mr. Smart and myself both rolled, until stopped by the dense underwood. Our road lay through a dark forest of noble trees, principally Gordonia, called by the Lepchas \"sum brung kun,\" whose smooth, upright, and perfectly straight stems present fine specimens of forest trees. Most of these trees were encircled at various heights by epiphytical ferns, growing in a crown-like form completely round the stem. Each frond of this elegant fern measures five feet in length, and from the great elegance of its shape serves to adorn the tree that bears it. The underwood was principally composed of the gigantic bamboo, fici, baubinias and ferns; the whole so thick, matted and tangled as to render the forest as dark as late twilight; not a ray of sunshine could penetrate or shine upon us; but I noticed that wherever a stray beam of sunshine did force its way through the tangled masses of foliage overhead, that it tinged the ground with a deep purple or garnet colour. The noise from the cicadas was quite oppressive and wearisome. One was caught and, as I conjectured yesterday, was of a totally different species from those seen at Darjeeling. It had transparent wings, and was three inches in length. On its sides are too long horny plates, and upon pressing these plates whilst the animal continued to cry, a modulation of the extraordinary and wild sound emitted by this strange fly was caused, bearing however no resemblance to harmony. Under skilful hands and by delicate manipulation, a tune might be extorted from this cicada, thus in a measure verifying the old fable of the cicada having been used as a supplementary note to the Lyre.\n\nThe underwood abounded with the yellow webs of the large red and black Epir\u00e6, or bird-eating spiders, each web containing a spider.\nA troop of red monkeys were gambolling and shouting in the trees; their voice is quite different from that of the common red monkey of the plains.\n\nThree quarters of an hour after leaving Goke we crossed the Teryook stream at its junction with the Rummam river, and after travelling along the banks of the noisy, boiling and foaming Rummam for an hour more, we crossed to its left bank by a very frail and dangerous cane bridge of about 300 feet span, and commenced the steep ascent of Chakoong. We now stood in the Rajah of Sikkim's territory.\n\nThe Rummam immediately above the bridge comes tearing round a sharp corner of the mountain, and with one bound dashes over a group of gneiss rocks. The trees dipping their branches into the very water, the lofty forest-clad mountains on all sides, from whose very bosom, the river appears to dash at once, the roar and noise of the water\u2014altogether present as pretty a picture as can be well imagined.\n\nAfter a toilsome ascent of several thousand feet through forest trees and through several clearances planted with cotton, we reached two Lepcha huts, where we were most kindly received and invited to shelter ourselves from the burning sun, and to partake of the delicious \"chee\" or acidulous infusion of the Murooa (Eleusine), which is always presented in a joint of a bamboo, from which receptacle it is sucked up through a hollow reed so cut at the sides as not to permit the small grains to pass up into the mouth. The liquor resembles in taste, dilute Hock or Sauterne, and is very refreshing. It is slightly intoxicating, and is seldom seen above 6,000 feet elevation.\n\nThe huts of the Bhotia and Lepcha reminded me of the huts of the Rajmahal hill tribes. Having no caste, no great secrecy is sought for in the construction of the house, which consists of one large room thirty or forty feet square, raised upon wooden posts, the walls, roofing, beams, rafters, flooring, and fastenings being all composed of bamboo; the thatch is of grass. There are generally two or more fire-places in the room composed of loose stones upon a mound of earth, the whole retained in position by a square fender of bamboo.\n\nIn the house we visited, there were two women, many children,\nand about ten men. Wandering round about the house were cows, pigs, poultry, goats and dogs. In the interior of the house there were two fire-places, at both of which food was being cooked, consisting of rice and tea. Tea in these mountains is drank after the following extraordinary manner. Into a large earthen cooking-pot, full of hot water, a quantity of black tea that has been chopped from the end of a brick of tea, is thrown, together with a little salt, butter and barley-meal; this mess after being well stirred, is served up in a teapot, each partaker of the tea producing his own wooden tea-cup from the bosom folds of his capacious clothes. In various parts of the house, depending from the ceiling were balls of cotton, various little bamboo baskets,\u2014a half-finished woven piece of cotton cloth, earthen cooking pots, gourds, wooden spoons, a cotton-cleaner, a spinning-wheel, several large Chinese hats, nine feet in circumference, fishing nets, heads of millet, a book of Buddhist prayers, a few English bottles, a pair of cymbals, bows and arrows, bead necklaces, large Lepcha knives, or Ban, hatchets, a drum, several blocks of wood used as tables, a few bamboo mats and a deer skin:\u2014such is the simple property of a Lepcha, one of the happiest, merriest, and most humane of our species.\n\nClose to our hut we could hear the roar of a cataract, the scenery round about the house was most pleasing.\n\nAfter reposing during the heat of the day with the friendly Lepcha family, we started and in an hour reached a Lepcha Lama's house or Goompa, an immense building divided into two compartments. The Lama being absent, the whole house was delivered up to us; we took possession of one room about thirty feet square nicely boarded with broad and well laid planks. At the East end of the room was an altar, but divested of many of its usual utensils. There were nevertheless many holy-water brass cups, eight books of prayers, in a stand close by the altar, a sacred drum with its curious crooked drumstick, a pair of yak horns, cymbals, brass images representing gods, bells, conch-shells, charms and a dorje or the brass sceptre of the priesthood, resembling an English constable's hand-staff, surmounted by a regal crown; besides these articles forming the furniture of a Buddhist altar, there were English Eau-de-cologne bottles, a tea-cup, a blacking bottle, a two-foot ruler, and lastly, a\nFrench deal box, that had once held brandy, and addressed in good English to \"Mr. W. Martin, Darjeeling.\" The usual human thigh bone-trumpets were locked up, they being considered too precious to be left about. These bone trumpets, if possible, are the thigh bones of Lamas, some of them are highly ornamented with brass work brought from Thibet. The two condyles at the extremity of the bone are pierced and the bone hollowed out and when about to be used, a small quantity of water is poured down the bone to make it sound clear. The sound emitted is like that from a brazen horn; and as a small hand drum, with pellets of clay or brass tied upon strings depending from the rim and serving as drumsticks, is generally used in the other hand, the noise produced is stunning. In several Goompas or monasteries, I have requested the Lamas to blow up the bone trumpets, to which requests they have always good-naturedly acceded, terminating their performance with a hearty fit of laughter at their own strange and wild noise.\n\nThe whole of the walls of our room were decorated with mystic squares, triangles, and other figures of white, yellow, and black pigments; the door was a block of wood turning on its own heel, which was stepped into a wooden socket, the walls were composed of planks and wattles covered with mud and pierced with two windows with sliding shutters. The Lama receives five rupees from the Sikkim Rajah annually.\n\nThis Goompa or monastery is situated near the large landslip that is visible from Darjeeling; this landslip, which is several thousand feet in height and one hundred broad, has a pretty stream of water flowing amongst its rocks; when heavy rain takes place the rocks begin to move downwards, causing a low rumbling sound, loud enough to awaken the members resident at the Goompa. The view from this spot looking back upon Darjeeling, only nine miles distant, the deep valleys at our feet many thousands of feet deep, the lofty Tonglo mountain to the South West and the foaming cataract on the landslip, well repaid us for two days' toil and the suffocating heat of the valleys.\n\nAround the neck of one of the Lepcha children, hung as a charm, I observed, the following curious collection of oddities, a leopard's and a barking deer's canine teeth, an ornamented brass head, a piece\nof ginger, a clove of garlic, and the hard seeds of a forest tree, all strung upon a cotton thread. All the men, women and children who could afford it had the small silver current British Government coins, eight, four, and two anna pieces soldered on to brass rings, and worn either on the fingers or round the neck. To those who had no silver coins, I made a present of a quantity.\n\n4th August.\u2014Left the Goompa at 6.30 A.M. passed some good Limboo huts and clearances principally sown with cotton and murrooa, and commenced a stiff ascent. On passing the Limboo huts, we found men, women and children all hard at work, husking grain; fine English looking cows, pigs and poultry were lying about or strolling round the neat houses, which are built of split bamboo roofed with the long and broad leaves of the wild ginger and cardamom which abound in the forests at this elevation, the roofs are guyed to the ground with long rope-like rattans, to enable them to resist the powerful blasts of wind that descend the mountains with enormous power, and that without one moment's notice.\n\nThe ascent of Syrioong Burpung, such is the name of this portion of the Hee mountain, occupied us an hour; the ascent the whole way being through fine fields of Indian-corn and three kinds of murrooa. On the crest of Syrioong the heavy forest commences, and at this spot is a small cairn of stones, marking the boundary between the Jageer or estate of Lepcha Pongring, who resides at Tullam on the banks of the Rummam, and of the lands of the Rajah of Sikkim. At 10 A.M. we halted to breakfast at a beautiful waterfall, with a fine body of water dashing down the side of the forest-clad mountain by eight or nine leaps. A small portion of this waterfall is seen from Darjeeling as a white speck on the face of the mountain.\n\nAfter crossing Syrioong the footpath runs through a dense underwood of rose bushes, stinging nettles, black mud, and running streams, through which we were obliged to wade; our legs and feet getting covered with numerous leeches, and our hands and faces stung by nettles and peepsas.\n\nThe peepsas is a small dipterous fly of a black and metallic green colour with spotted legs and a small head. It bites without any pain, attacking any available part of the body, upon which it feeds\nfor about three minutes, caressing the part the whole time by raising and depressing their delicate fore legs alternately, as if thoroughly enjoying the sanguineous draught; when their bodies are distended with blood, they fly away, leaving a small round purple spot of extravasated blood, very irritating, and, with some people, attended with considerable inflammation. If the fly is disturbed before it has had a full meal, a small flow of blood takes place, and relieves the bitten part. There are several kinds of peepsas, some are so small that they are barely visible to the naked eye; this kind however give a most stinging bite, and, although not seen, are felt in a very decided manner. The peepsas range from 2,000 to 8,000 feet.\n\nA hasty breakfast being despatched, for it was impossible to stand still without being covered with leeches, we proceeded till eleven o'clock, when, being fully drenched by a smart shower, and by crushing through the wet underwood, we halted, lit a fire and dried ourselves; our legs, arms and bodies smarting from leech-bites and from the abundant wounds of the formidable stinging nettles which sting through the strongest clothes.\n\nDuring our halt, our Lepcha guide made a breakfast of roasted spinach that he had collected in the murrooa fields in the morning. Rolling the spinach up in some large leaves he thrust the bundle into the hot ashes, where it remained ten minutes; he then withdrew the bitter feast and consumed it, adding raw but crushed stinging nettle tops as a sauce to the whole. It would require more boldness than most people possess to induce any stranger in the hills to attempt to put any portion of such a formidable-looking plant as the Sikkim stinging nettle into his mouth for transmission to the stomach. The leaves are armed with innumerable sharp spikes a quarter of an inch in length; not only are they spread over the whole of the upper surface of the leaves, but they also appear on the point of each tooth of the deeply serrated edge of the leaf, and upon the leaf stalks and stem of the plant. Each spike at its base is provided with a small white bladder or gland containing the poison. The plant attains the height of four feet; with a leaf upwards of a foot in length. Their wound causes much pain, and sometimes violent sneezing and fever; one kind in particular mentioned by Dr. Campbell, and named the \"mellumba,\" produces running at the eyes,\nnose, sneezing, fever and sometimes death. In addition to the above pungent food, my Lepcha consumed young and tender fern tops, a white fungus found upon trees, a sharp acid plant, and several other leaves and roots. A Lepcha affirms that he cannot starve as long as he is on the hills; this appears to be true, as he makes almost the whole vegetable kingdom subservient to his appetite.\n\nLeft the fire at 1 P.M., at 2 P.M. we were on the summit of Rutto, a wooden mountain; after rather a level walk of two hours, we halted for the night at 4 P.M. a few paces from the left bank of the source of the Rishi, which stream falls into the Great Bungee river. The Barometer gave our elevation 8,030 feet, Thermometer 67\u00b0 at 4 P.M. or just beyond the region of the leeches. Just as we had got our small tent up, heavy rain commenced to fall which continued during the greater portion of the night, penetrating our small tent and wetting our bedding. A good supper and a sound sleep refreshed us, nor did we much care for the sprinkling we got during the night. Near our tent was a tempting L'hap, or cave, formed by an overhanging mass of gneiss rock; but as it was not found large enough for us and our fifteen Lepchas, we cleared away the jungle, pitched the tent, slung the barometer and turned in for the night. I felt satisfied that our Lepchas were enjoying no worse fare than ourselves; they had two tents furnished by me for their protection; we had no servants to cook for us, no beds, no comforts, beyond a good layer of ferns to lie upon, and a blanket to cover us. A strong decoction of coffee morning and evening, with a handful of bread rusks and a slice of ham or bacon, forming our entire food during the twenty-four hours.\n\nLucifer matches, flint and steel, and several other modes of procuring fire being utterly unavailing in these damp mountains, the Lepchas were never at a loss to supply us with that necessary element, so conducive to comfort and life; for upon halting, our merry guides and coolies produced fire by causing one vertical piece of dry wood that was sharpened almost to a point to revolve rapidly in a mortise cut in another horizontal piece of wood; both pieces of wood were highly dried and smoked at their homes and exactly resembled two round rulers. The rapid revolution of the upright piece of wood upon the horizontal piece, produces by friction a dry sawdust, which, after a minute's working round and round, catches fire. The\nwood resembles willow and is procured from a shrub that grows in the hot valleys and generally from the banks of the mountain torrents. Two men work the upright piece of wood, the other is placed upon the ground, or more generally upon the large Lepcha knife. The upright stick is seized between the palms of the hands, and made to revolve rapidly first to the right and then to the left, the pressure used causing the hands to descend from the top to the bottom of the stick; upon the hands reaching the lower stick, the second man commences from the top; and so on, in quick succession, until fire is produced; one mortise or hole produces fire four times, when a new one is made, the old one being worn through.\n\n5th August, 1852.\u2014Started at 8 A.M. in a North Westerly direction, and in three quarters of an hour we were upon the summit of Heeloo, about 8,500 feet (Heethloo of Hooker's map), at which spot were boundary stones separating two small estates of Sikkim. From this spot we commenced a rapid descent, which soon brought us again upon our tormentors the leeches, which swarmed upon every leaf, upon every stone. In an hour I had received fifty bites upon the ankles and legs; and allowing that only one in ten that managed to get upon my person bit me, I must have had five hundred of these troublesome and loathsome animals upon my person within an hour.\n\nThe leech of the Himalayas is first met with at 4,000 feet elevation, it is of a small black species, and, when young, is as thin as a needle and about an inch in length; when full grown it is still very small not measuring more than two inches in length, even when gorged with blood\u2014at 5,000 feet their numbers increase; but at 6 and 7,000 feet up to nearly 8,000, they swarm in myriads, every leaf, bush and stone being covered with these annelides. From 8,000 to nearly 10,000 there is a hiatus, at which elevation these animals are not found, but from 10 to 11,000 feet, another species is found, but not very abundant; it is of a snuff brown colour with a black line down the back and a white stripe down each side of the body. This is not such a blood-thirsty animal as the black one, but is more sluggish.\n\nThe Lepchas affirm that the leeches spring from the bushes on to the traveller; this is a mistake, they fall upon a passer-by from\nboughs over his head, and with the greatest activity cling to the shoe or foot, although only on the ground during the short period required to make a step. We tried tobacco leaves, dried snuff, of which we carried mulls full; we tried having a man behind to watch our naked legs, for it is impossible to keep the calves of the legs covered, otherwise every leech that managed to get upon your person would have a feast; but all to no purpose. The bites were as numerous as ever; although from the effects of the tobacco, I have turned out from my shoes at the end of a day's journey, thirty or forty dead and completely dried up leeches. If the leg is thoroughly protected with leather gaiters, the leech will be driven to bite higher up, and will insinuate itself up the sleeves or down the neck; in fact there is no remedy yet discovered that will keep them off your person. They are not seen during the winter, nor during very heavy rain: between the showers of the rainy season is the period of their greatest activity.\n\nAt noon we were a few hundred feet above the Limboo village Hee, having descended 3,000 feet, and now stood opposite to the noble mountain on which are situated the monasteries of Pemionchi and Chanachelling, on the northern side of the Kullait river. The Thermometer stood at 75\u00b0, and the power of the sun was so great as to necessitate the use of an umbrella. A pretty Bhootea woman with a child on her back brought us from her house, where she and her husband lived whilst tending a herd of cows, a large bamboo of fresh milk probably holding a couple of quarts, and subsequently she brought us two bamboos of the delicious chee, only to be enjoyed where there is great heat. A present of a quantity of silver two-anna pieces seemed to please her very much, for she ran for her husband, a regular Mongolian with a goitre, who, she assured us, would act as our guide for a short distance.\n\nAs dysentery was raging at Hee, our people begged of us not to go to the village, as they believe that the disease is infectious; indeed not one of our Lepchas would have followed us had we insisted upon proceeding in that direction; so having enjoyed the view of the magnificent mountain, and having taken the bearings of the Goompas that were perched 4,000 feet over our heads, our guide led us through the forest in a westerly direction.\nSoon after leaving the cow-herd's hut we came upon two upright posts, the height of a man, stuck upon either side of the footpath and connected at the top with a horizontal post, from which depended two bundles of sticks, a foot in length, each bundle containing fifteen sticks; near these bundles were two wooden cudgels, also hanging by strips of rattan\u2014a few feet removed from this group were two other poles erected on either side of the road, but unconnected with any horizontal bar. The meaning of these posts and sticks is as follows:\u2014Any one coming from the direction of the two disconnected poles may pass on free and unmolested; but any one daring to pass from the other side, which points to the infected village, and in this case pointing to the dysentery-infected Hee; would be assuredly beaten with the two pendant cudgels under which he or she passes, and moreover would be fined thirty rupees, the number of pieces of wood tied up in the two bundles. Thus whenever small-pox, dysentery or any other complaint breaks out in a village, a strict sanitary cordon is drawn around the infected village, and no one is allowed to move out.\n\nAt 1-30 p.m. halted on the banks of the Mik, a tributary of much beauty to the kullait river, an affluent of the Great Bungeet. Over the Mik is a small bridge of rough trees with a bamboo bannister, the stream is twenty or thirty feet broad, and dashes by a series of leaps over a group of gneiss rocks. The noise was deafening, but the scene beautiful.\n\nJust before reaching the Mik, I broke down and secured a large handsome fruit of a cucurbitaceous plant that was twining up a tree, the leaves were palmated, fruit about one foot across, and had the appearance of a musk-melon that had been pressed from both ends until considerably flattened. The Lepchas called it kuthoor phort; they immediately, but with some difficulty, dashed the fruit to pieces on the rocks, extracted from the inside five or six large red seeds, two inches in length, which, when broken open, I found to contain a milk-white kernel tasting like a new walnut. The Lepchas put the stones into the fire and, when roasted, offered them to us; they were delicious.\n\nThe case of the stones is as hard as a walnut shell, veined with deep sutures like a peach stone, which it resembles in colour.\nHaving washed all the leeches off our legs, we started and ascended a very steep and rocky mountain, and at 4 p.m. halted at a group of Lepcha huts named Rudhoo at an elevation of 6,517 feet. We took possession of a Lepcha house, the owner of which was absent. The view from this spot is very beautiful; five thousand feet below us the Kullait river, a mass of foam from its headlong speed, was visible, looking both up and down the valley. Immediately to the north of us and shutting out all view of the snowy range, stood the imposing steep and rocky mountain Pemionchi; magnificent forests of oak, chesnut and walnut clothing its steep sides. Immediately opposite to our house, we could see a fine cascade dashing down one of the deep ravines in the face of the mountain. The monasteries on the summit, the Cazi's village and residence near the summit, the numerous deep dells and ravines with which the sides of the mountain are indented, the distant mountains looking towards the East, and Heeloo, over which we had travelled this day, the little village of Hee overhanging the river\u2014all combined to form as pretty a picture as we could desire to look upon. The Kullait river rises from the Singaleela range, flows between the Hee and Pemionchi mountains in a valley with an average depth of 6,000 feet for twenty-four miles, when it falls into Bungeet. Every spur descending from these two fine mountains has a separate name, and the whole of them are cultivated, up to 5,000 feet, or 1,500 feet below where we stood, with rice, Indian-corn, and murrooa.\n\nThe mountains in the valley of the Kullait are far more grand and steep than any I have yet met with in the lower Himalayah. Pemionchi is composed of a bright and glossy micaceous schist; Heeloo of gneiss.\n\nDuring this day's march, and as we were proceeding across a hill torrent in a most orderly manner, a young merry Lepcha behind me gave a loud scream, which seemed to electrify the whole of our Lepchas; down went bag and baggage from every shoulder, my guide, who was dressed as a non-working man in scarlet and finery, commenced most irreverently to strip off his finery, and to my horror almost threw my mountain Barometer into the nearest bush\u2014when he had stripped himself he dashed into the stream, and commenced diving his hands under every stone near him or thrusting a\nlong stick under the more distant ones, whilst the other Lepchas were busy throwing branches of trees and bushes into all the small channels where any animal could possibly find a passage. The shouting and screaming that was kept up rendered it an impossibility to get an answer from any of the Lepchas; at last after my frequent enquiries as to what they had seen, my guide, with open mouth and eyes, told me that it was a fish with hands and legs that they sought; in other words they had seen one of the large brown edible hill frogs which, to judge by the immense sensation caused by its appearance, must indeed be relished by a Lepcha. The search, I am sorry to say, was a fruitless one.\n\nOur homely meal this evening was added to by our Lepchas, who brought us a quantity of the roasted shoots of the young bamboo, which are put into the ashes until thoroughly heated; these shoots, which are conical in shape, and of the size of a man's forearm, or a foot in length and four inches in diameter at the bottom of the cone, are deliciously tender and sweet, resembling an artichoke in tenderness, and a good young cabbage mixed with new walnuts in taste. The only parts that are not edible are the Septa dividing the joints. These shoots and the roasted seeds of the Kuthoor Phort served up upon a large leaf were most welcome additions to our salt supper.\n\n6th August, 1852.\u2014Left our Lepcha hut at 7 a.m. The hut we had slept in had its walls composed of large sheets of bark, some as much as four feet broad and seven in length. This hut and two others constitute the village of Budhoo.\n\nJust as we were starting, the Lepchas of Budhoo brought us as presents a large live cock, baskets of rice and some milk. The latter being very acceptable I took it, making them a present in return; and having given a silver coin to each member of a small troop of children, we proceeded in a westerly direction or up the valley of the Kullait, hoping by this route to reach the summit of the Singah-leelah range. Immediately upon leaving the huts, we entered a fine forest of oak, chestnut, walnut, birch, olive and other fine forest trees; our path was about 3,000 feet above the Kullait which we could hear roaring below, as it dashed over the huge rounded masses of gneiss which compose its bed. Numerous kokla or green pigeons\ninhabit these forests; their note is like a plaintive run upon a flageolet.\n\nAt the entrance to all the Lepcha clearances I observed forked sticks about eight feet in height supporting numerous wooden swords, miniature baskets full of rice, eggs, the crops of fowls filled with rice, little bundles of herbs and flowers, fowls' legs and small baskets of raw cotton; these are offerings made to an invisible being who is said to reside on the banks of the Cholamo Lake in Thibet, whence the Teesta river (Lachen) takes its rise, and who is said to wield a great sword, with which he deals out death and destruction, as well as sickness and famine. The wooden swords are to deprecate his wrath; the productions of the earth and of their farms are offered partly as free-will offerings of gratitude for their abundant harvests, and partly as votive offerings.\n\nAt 8 A.M. we crossed a foaming cascade, which was descending over gneiss rocks with a headlong pace down the face of the mountain towards the Kullait. At 9 A.M. we were at the bottom of a deep hot valley, in which flows the Rennier stream, this is a large deep and rocky river flowing from Heeloo. Looking up the valley I perceived that the forest trees, crowning the heights many thousand feet above us, were all leafless, the foliage having been destroyed by the snow. The Rennier is crossed by a large fallen tree thrown from bank to bank, notched to prevent the feet from slipping; with an apology for a bannister, consisting of a few sticks tied together in the rudest manner with creepers, which frail support a Lepcha was obliged to pull quite tight whilst being used, otherwise it would be of little use to a traveller crossing such a boiling, howling cauldron, as raged below us.\n\nThe banks of the stream presented hornstone, and in the bed were blocks of a very beautiful gneiss, the component parts of which were intense black mica and pure white quartz.\n\nA little below the bridge there was a strong wooden palisade supporting a quantity of elongated conical fishing baskets and extending quite across the river, destined for the capture of the edible frogs.\n\nAt 11.30 A.M. after tediously cutting a path through a regular tropical growth of underwood, we reached a small stone fort prettily perched upon a knoll commanding a complete view both up and\ndown the valley of the Kullait, a wild and beautiful scene. The fort, which is built of flat slabs of gneiss rock, is fifty feet square with walls eight feet in height, with a square bastion in the centre of each face; the walls are pierced for musketry. Within the fort are two houses the residence of a Bhooteah, by name Cheoong Lethoo, who styles himself the Sirdar or chief of Singaleelah, and of the valley of the Kullait; he receives no pay from the Rajah of Sikkim, but has to collect soldiers from his district, when required, which, I imagine, is not often the case. This little stronghold is surrounded by fields of Indian corn, rice and murrooa. Immediately under the walls were cucumbers and chillies, whilst all beyond this small cleared space is dense forest. The fort was built by the present owner's father, who was a man of note in Sikkim. As we approached the fort, the Sirdar was seen parading up and down upon the top of the walls, gun in hand, his basket hat, which was highly ornamented with sparkling plates of mica, shining like a helmet in the sun. He seemed wonder-struck at seeing our long line of fifteen coolies and two Sirdars, headed by two Europeans, invading his forest fastness, where from the commencement to the close of the year a stranger is never seen. Our presence seemed to distress him very much, and it was some time before he would condescend to answer any of our questions regarding the road up to the summit of Singaleelah. A present of gunpowder, shot and ball for his old English single-barrelled gun seemed to please him, as he soon after volunteered to be our guide to a village where his wife and family were residing a few miles further up the valley, and where we should be obliged to halt for the night. This was most fortunate, as, without his assistance, we never could possibly have found the footpath which crosses and recrosses streams and forest tracts, in some places without a trace of a footpath.\n\nFrom the fort we descended to the banks of the Kullait, which river we skirted for a short distance until we came upon the spot where the Sungroo and Sungsoor streams, both flowing from the south, fall into the Nyu, a feeder of the Kullait, only a few yards from each other. The noise of the three streams, filled as they were by the late heavy rains, can only be understood by a visit to the spot. The roar and confusion caused by the falling, bounding and foaming\nwater, the forests, the strange attire of our party, every member of which was bleeding profusely from both legs from the leech-bites, formed a strange, unpleasant, though curiously wild picture. Both streams are crossed by trimmed trees; between the two streams a stone wall pierced with embrasures crosses the road, flanked by the Nyu river on one side and by the steep and wooded mountain on the other. This defence was erected by the Sirdar's father to repel the Goorkas, who more than once have threatened Sikkim with invasion, since their great invasion of 1787 A.D.\n\nClose to the stone wall above-mentioned is a Mendong, a solid stone edifice resembling a wall; they are found all over Sikkim; they are generally about twelve or fifteen feet in length, six feet high and two deep, with a centre distinguished by being thicker and higher than the sides; on the faces near the top are inserted large tablets with the mystic words: \"Om mane pemi hom,\" carved in high relief. As the inscription of course begins at opposite ends on each side, the Bhooteahs are careful in passing, that they do not trace the words backwards;* the left hand is always kept next to the Mendong when passing one.\n\nAn hour's walk along the banks of the Nyu river brought us to the ascent that leads to the last houses in the Kullait valley, 6,500 feet above the sea; at the houses we halted for the night, sending our men ahead to clear away the jungle, as the path from long disuse is reported as overgrown and impassable.\n\nThe path to-day passed over much gneiss rock, and occasionally large detached slabs of the same rock were seen; some of the blocks have minute garnets disseminated.\n\nWe had a neat little granary assigned to us as our quarters; the house stood upon high posts and was well stored with baskets full of ripe barley and wheat in the ear, also cotton; the walls were open mat work, and the heavens were visible through a scanty reed thatch; the whole room was nevertheless comfortable, dry and redolent of harvest. At sunset we had an audience of the Sirdar and of the villagers in general: we sat upon nice soft cushions provided by the Sirdar, stuffed with musk-deer hair and placed upon the bare rocks. We conversed through interpreters for some hours, principally about\n\n* See Turner's Embassy to Tibet, pages 97, 98.\nthe unfortunate, because misguided, Rajah of Sikkim, about L'hassa, the grand Lama, the pass of Tumbok into Nepal, which we expected to reach the next day, and upon a variety of other subjects. The Sirdar showed with much amusing importance sundry Tibetan looking letters, stamped with the Rajah's vermilion seal, forbidding Cheeoong Lethoo, Sirdar of Singaleelah, to allow any one to pass either up or down the Tumbok pass; we told him it was impossible to retrace our steps, the fatigue we had undergone ascending and descending the steep mountains, amounting to 10,000 feet of descent and 17,500 feet of ascent in five days, the innumerable leech-bites we had received, amounting to several hundreds on each leg, the intolerable heat of the valleys, and the constant wading through the icy cold streams and from never being clothed in dry clothes had so knocked us up, that we were determined to enjoy a little of the cool breezes on the summit of Singaleelah; we informed him that if we found we could not get along the crest of Singaleelah we would return by the Kullait; this cheered him up amazingly; but when I told him that if I succeeded in cutting my way along the crest I should return by Pemionchi, his countenance fell; he begged of me not to risk my safety in going upon Singaleelah which, he declared, was a land of rocks and desolation, and a spot not fitted for man to wander in. Poor Cheeoong Lethoo sat the picture of despair at our obstinacy, and with the determination of a true Mongol he kept on passing and re-passing over his beardless chin and that with rapidity, a handsome pair of flat brass L'hassa beard-plucking pincers, ornamented with Tibetan characters, a violent jerk now and then proclaiming that a stray hair had actually been secured and rooted out; and to ascertain this comforting fact, the edge of the pincers were passed over his lips; the fact being satisfactorily settled to Cheeong's satisfaction that he had actually captured a solitary hair, another search was immediately taken in hand.\n\nAmongst his other papers the Sirdar produced a picture about one foot in length, painted upon fine linen. It was from L'hassa, the drawing representing a great number of gods and goddesses, rivers, mountains, and a variety of confused and mystical subjects; on the back of the picture were the revered words \"Om, a, hoom\" in large bright vermilion letters. The picture, the Sirdar affirmed, cost\n\u00a350 sterling (500 rupees), and to it he appeared to attach much value; the mystic words as written\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{\u0950} & \\quad \\text{Intelligence, arm, power} \\\\\n\\text{\u0950} & \\quad \\text{The word} \\\\\n\\text{\u0950} & \\quad \\text{The heart or love}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nmean God; or as Le p\u00e8re Calmette in his \"Lettres \u00e9difiantes,\" Tome 14th, page 9, says, \"voici ce que j\u2019appris de la religion du Thibet; \u201cils appellent, Dieu Koncioser, et ils semblent avoir quelque ide\u2019e \u201cde l\u2019adorable Trinit\u00e9 car tant\u00f4t ils le nomment Koncikocick, Dieu \u201cun; et tant\u00f4t Koncioksum, Dieu Trin. Ils se servent d\u2019une esp\u00e8ce \u201cde chapelet sur lequel ils prononcent ces paroles; Om, ha, hum. \u201cLorsqu\u2019on leur en demande l\u2019explication ils r\u00e9pondent que \u2018Om\u2019 \u201csignifie intelligence ou bras, c\u2019est \u00e0 dire puissance; que \u2018ha,\u2019 est \u201cla parole; que \u2018hum\u2019 est le c\u0153ur ou l\u2019amour et que ces trois mots \u201csignifient Dieu.\u201d\n\nThe Sirdar was a boy when Captain Weston came up the Kullait in 1822, to settle the boundary between Nepal and Sikkim at the head of the Kullait valley or at the Tumbok Pass. By the treaty of 1815, between Nepal and Sikkim, a large portion of the Sikkim Hills and Morung that had been ceded to the British Government in perpetuity by the Nepalese Court, and at the same time made over by the British Government in full sovereignty to the Sikkim Rajah, required to have the boundaries settled.\n\nThe Sirdar had also escorted Dr. Hooker from the Tumbok Pass to the Teesta river when returning from his tour in eastern Nepal in 1849, and at last consented to escort us to the summit of the Tumbook Pass.\n\nTowards the close of the long talk, I made the Sirdar a present of money, and to every man, woman and child, amounting in all to thirty individuals, I distributed two, four and eight-anna silver coins; and in return, we were presented with a live kid, bamboo shoots, rice and plantains.\n\nAt this spot there are only two houses besides our little granary; in the house of the Sirdar nearly thirty people were accommodated during the night with food and lodging, men, women, and children all sleeping in the one room that constitutes the entire house.\nTwo miles north from the Sirdar's house, and several thousand feet below us, the Nyu and Kullait rivers unite, our route lay up the Nyu, the true Kullait valley from whence the river rises being too precipitous to attempt to reach Singaleelah by.\n\n7th August, 1852.\u2014Started at 7.30 a.m. up the valley of the Nyu with Cheeoong Lethoo, Sirdar, and an old merry Limboo with a long white beard, as our guides. The ascent was very steep, and the path had to be cleared the whole way, not having been used for three years; the principal underwood was ferns, polygona and a plant whose leaves are eaten as a spinach by the Lepchas. At 9 we reached a spot in the forest where stood the remains of an old guard-house built by our Sirdar's father, for the purpose of watching the movements of the Goorkas. From this spot, the greater part of the valley of the Kullait is visible: as we stood to take breath, the merry old Limboo, who was armed with a bow and quiver full of arrows and a very long and handsome knife, presented me with a pinch of snuff deliciously scented with pounded cloves, and contained in a neat horn mull. At 9.30 we entered a fine open forest of noble birch trees, the ground was free from underwood and nearly level. At the foot of many of the trees we saw the marks of wild hogs, deer, bears and wild dogs; green pigeons (koklah) we heard cooing overhead in the trees, and high over a neighbouring mountain a black eagle was seen soaring, and beneath him numerous swallows were flitting to and fro. In this forest we passed the remains of a hut in which Dr. Hooker had put up for the night in 1849, and close to which is another stone breastwork thrown right across the road. The denseness of the foliage of these forests, may be imagined from the fact that although a fine clear sun was shining overhead, not a ray could reach the ground along which we were travelling.\n\nOur road now lay along the banks of the Nyu, a feeder of the Kullait, which rises at the Tumbook Pass, a foaming hill torrent about fifty feet broad with a cataract or miniature waterfall every twenty paces; the earth literally shook beneath the weight of the falling water.\n\nCrossed the Tiksee at its junction with the Nyu, fording it with much difficulty from the fearful rapidity and strength of the descending water. The method of crossing these rapid streams, is to\nsend some of the steadiest and strongest men into the stream, who by the aid of poles manage to steady themselves and form a line completely across the stream with their faces towards the source; in front of this living barricade the weaker men, those heavily laden and travellers are passed safely over. At 12.15 p.m. crossed in a similar manner the Sikna; also at its junction with the Nyu, and at 12.45 p.m. crossed over to the left bank of the Nyu by a fallen tree.\n\nHalted here for half an hour; the Barometer gave an elevation of 8,321 feet, Ther. 62\u00b0 in the shade.\n\nThe rocks in the bed of the Nyu were almost entirely composed of gneiss of great beauty and fineness, consisting of white quartz, white, pink, green and rose felspar; golden, silvery and black mica; garnets, and in one specimen some beautiful actinolite of a pale green colour. At 4 p.m. we entered the region of Rhododendrons, associated with which I noticed tea trees in blossom, maple, Bucinicum hypericum in full blossom, Hydrangea, Daphne or paper-tree, numerous flowering shrubs and an underwood of the cheem bamboo of whose roasted tops, our Lepchas gave us a delicious feast in the evening. We pitched our tents in the Rhododendron forest on a small piece of level land named Tumbok, from whence the name of the Pass a few thousand feet above us. Our elevation was 9,660 feet, Ther. 67\u00b0, we have ascended 3,160 feet since the morning, leaving our tormentors, the leeches, at 7,000 feet. Few people who have not travelled in the forests of Sikkim can imagine the perfect repose we enjoyed when we got beyond the region of leeches; the incessant watching for these tormentors, the impossibility of standing still, or of even walking slowly when amongst them, is fatiguing in the extreme; all pleasure is destroyed; beautiful scenery, plants, flowers all are disregarded, in order to prevent a cluster of these loathsome creatures clinging round your ankles. Watching their movements, brushing them off, the continued sprinkling of dry snuff over the stockings, which is washed off again at every stream, is more than enough for the undivided attention of any one.\n\nBy observation I have learnt to save myself many hundreds of bites, but, I am sorry to say, at the expense of those with me; it is never to walk behind any one, but to lead the line, which always travels in Indian file. Immediately a footstep has touched the path\nthe leeches are roused and they spring up from under every leaf, from under every stone, and after two or more human beings have passed, the leeches are seen hurrying towards the path from the neighbouring bushes as far as eight and ten feet distant. When they reach the foot path they stand up perfectly rigid and quite ready to grasp the first foot that falls near them. A stranger would mistake the rigid little black things in the path for twigs or small pieces of wood. The person leading the line seldom gets bitten, the animals not being roused. During heavy rain, frost or bright sunshine the leeches do not appear; a cloudy or a moderately showery day is their liveliest time.\n\nDuring the march, our guide took us off the road up a very steep bank to inspect a collection of wild bee-hives. After much scrambling and by the assistance of hooked sticks that were hooked on to the roots of the trees overhead, we managed to reach a narrow ledge with a deep valley in front of us. Immediately on our left and separated from us by a deep chasm, was a perpendicular wall of rock, over which a fine waterfall was pouring its full stream; almost within the reach of the water was a cave formed by an overhanging rock, from the roof of which depended twenty flat and black looking combs, three feet in length, covered with innumerable bees busy manufacturing their honey, while thousands were on the wing going and coming. The sight of these insects, only a few feet removed from where we stood, made me shudder; as it painfully brought to my mind a mad race, I was once made to run for miles down hill after having inadvertently disturbed a nest of these pugnacious little creatures. Besides being covered both on the head and hands with wounds, I had upon that occasion twenty-four stings removed from merely round my eyes. I therefore hastily made a sketch of the curious group, and descended from the ledge as fast as possible. These bee-hives are the property of the Sikkim Rajah; the wax is taken once a year by smoking the bees out, and yields him a revenue of ninety rupees per annum. The honey is eaten by the wax collector or thrown away.\n\n8th August, 1852.\u2014An hour and a half of sharp climbing carried us to the summit of Singaleelah* where the Tumbok Pass leads\n\n* Means \"Birch tree.\"\nfrom Sikkim into Nepal. Barometer gave an elevation of 10,792 feet, Thermometer 64\u00b0.\n\nOn our way up we were shown two rocks between which the narrow footpath runs; and where our guide informed us that a stout Nepalese Soubah, who was travelling in this direction, was unable, without great manoeuvering, to force his portly personage, much to the merriment of his followers and of Cheeoong Lethoo Sirdar, who related the story, as we halted for breath, with great gusto.\n\nAt 10,000 feet we fell in with the pale-coloured leech that inhabits this elevation, but, as they are scarce and sluggish, we paid little heed to them.\n\nThe Tumbok Pass is a depression in the Singaleelah range flanked on either side by high mountains, that to the south \"Melido\" or \"Singaleelah\" is four miles distant and rises to 12,329 W. feet;* that to the north, distant two miles, is nameless and is about 12,000 feet in height. The immediate summit of the Pass is destitute of trees, the forest being for two or three hundred yards on each side of the footpath replaced by grassy banks and slopes covered with a bright assemblage of purple geraniums, white roses, primrose, everlasting chrysanthemum of a buff colour, lily of the valley, forget-me-not, thistle, numerous pretty wild flowers whose names I am unacquainted with, a large white Passion flower-looking creeper, hemlock, holly, raspberry, arums, campanula, two kinds of buccinum, ferns, lichens, mosses, grass, carex, fennel, dock, ranunculus, anemone, a shrub bearing an elegant cluster of red bells, and a delicate lily-of-the-valley-looking plant bearing a pink or white cluster of minute bells. The trees near at hand were arboreous rhododendron, maple, a mimosa-looking tree, bearing a cluster of brown berries (Pyrus Americana?) and several others; wild garlic grows in great abundance with a very beautiful purple flower; this herb was gathered in large quantities and consumed by the Lepchas.\n\nA few feet below the summit of the Pass on the Nepal side, there is a deep black looking tarn surrounded by such deep forest that we could not conveniently get to it. The Sirdar and coolies all held\n\n* W. When applied to heights, indicates heights ascertained by Colonel Waugh, Surveyor General.\nup their hands in the attitude of prayer when they saw the water, and remained in that position muttering to themselves for several minutes.\n\nThe Sirdar after showing us the cairn of stones erected by Captain C. T. G. Weston in 1822, (?) and having shown us the boundary between Nepal and Sikkim, took his leave and returned home, taking with him as presents a pair of scissors, a sharp scalpel, a pen-knife, a quantity of gunpowder and shot, and a bottle of brandy.\n\nOn the cairn of stones are three carved slabs of gneiss, the carvings representing Boodh in the attitude of meditation, and several other Hindoo gods and some very indistinct figures, none of which were visible until I had destroyed, with boiling water, a very tough and flat lichen, that had spread over the whole of the slabs.\n\nOn a slab of flinty slate, we engraved our names and date of visit.\n\nThe view looking into Nepal is extensive and very beautiful, the spurs of almost all the mountains up to 5000 feet being much more cleared and cultivated than those in Sikkim, bespeaking a denser population. The grandeur of the view, looking back the way we had come or to the east, can hardly be described in words. The eastern snowy range was out in all its glory; there was not a cloud to obscure a single peak. Gipmochee 14,509 W. was bare of snow; Cholah 17,319 W. was covered with snow for about 1000 feet; further north all was one wintery scene of snow, and the lofty Chumalari 23,929 W. distant 80 miles and far in Thibet, towered over all the peaks in advance of him. I have given a slight sketch of this mountain upon the accompanying map, as it appears from the Tumbok Pass. To the north, nothing was visible but the sharply pointed and snowy peak, Nursing 19,139 W. distant 23 miles and covered with perpetual snow, the higher crest of Singaleelah shutting out our view to the north.\n\nThe valley of the Kullait from its great depth appeared bathed in a cobalt tinge; Hee, Tendong and many other fine mountains seen from Darjeeling were now seen in flank by us; and on our right a fine waterfall, the source of the Nyu, was dashing down the fir clad Melida mountain which is 12,829 feet in height.\n\nOur tent was pitched upon a bed of geraniums in full flower, thousands of whose pretty blossoms were trodden under foot. Gad-\nflies of a large size were very abundant, but they gave us no trouble beyond an occasional bite.\n\nAs we had had only a very short march and intending to remain all day on the Pass, the Lepchas commenced playing hop-step and a jump; running races, jumping distances and playing all sorts of tricks, like so many good-natured school-boys; whilst the Nepalese Hindoo coolies shrunk away to sleep under the trees.\n\nThe Lepcha is a most desirable companion in travelling, neither heat nor rain nor cold, nor any thing else appears to ruffle his even temper. I have travelled with them in the height of the rains when for fifteen days they never had a dry stitch of clothes on their backs, and yet no word of murmur was ever heard from their lips. They travelled the whole of these days through drenching rain, carrying heavy burdens; and at night often in vain endeavouring to dry their clothes, their legs streaming with blood, they would without a murmur, but with much laughing and joking, lie down on the wet ground under a cotton covering, stretched upon two poles, and sleep till the morning.\n\nDuring the night I heard the hooting of owls; bats and shrews were also heard. I procured a very handsome speckled crow with a white and black tail; small birds were very scarce.\n\n9th August, 1852.\u2014Direction north along the crest of Singaleelab. The morning was most lovely, the air pure and transparent and the temperature delicious; although this trip has been undertaken in the height of the rains, we have as yet only had a few showers since leaving Darjeeling.\n\nThe same beautiful view that we had sat for hours enjoying the evening before was still before us; Chumalari towering over everything. This singular, isolated mountain was recognized this morning by several of my Lepchas who had been to Phari at its base.\n\nAs we proceeded we noticed a bank of snow-white clouds twenty miles in length and twelve thousand feet in height, impelled by the full force of the most southwest monsoon rolling up the eastern flank of the eastern snowy range, and as the clouds poured over the western side upon the lower hills of Sikkim, it had the exact appearance of an extensive cataract pouring over the mountains into the deep valley of the Teesta river; a cataract twenty miles long and 12,000 feet in height; it was a glorious sight.\nAs we ascended the grassy knoll that overhung our tents, the snowy range of Nepal was revealed to our sight, with all its attendant beauties of deep valleys and blue mountains for a foreground. For three and a half hours we had to cut our way through a forest of rhododendrons, red currant trees in full fruit though not ripe, maple, juniper, birch, white rose, cherry trees in full fruit, with an underwood of Aconitum palmatum or bikh, the root of which is a deadly poison, and of which our Lepchas dug up a quantity; a purple-flowered garlic, many beautiful flowers, the forget-me-not, the poppy-like garnet-coloured and yellow mecanopsis, and a great variety of wild flowers. The roots of this deadly aconitum are collected by the hill-men (Puharias) I believe in the spring, and exported to Calcutta and to other places, where it sells for one rupee the seer. Its uses were laughingly described to me by my merry Lepcha guide, as \"useful to sportsmen for destroying elephants and tigers, useful to the rich for putting troublesome relations out of the way, and useful to jealous husbands for the purpose of destroying faithless wives.\"\n\nIts poisonous power is so great that a Lepcha died at Darjeeling, some months ago, who when crossing the hot valleys had allowed the root which was carried across his shoulder in an open cane-basket, to rub against his moist naked body; during this time he imbibed through the pores of the skin sufficient of the poisonous principle to cause his death.\n\nAt 10 A.M. we arrived at a grassy spot, where the remains of a Gurung's house stood. The Gurungs are a pastoral race of Hindoos residing in Nepal, who, during the summer, drive up to the base of the snows large flocks of sheep, where they depasture the grass found as high as 14,000 feet, and gradually retreat to lower elevations as the summer draws to a close.\n\nFrom this spot we found a good footpath leading along the crest of Singaleelah; we had passed over five high peaks and now stood upon a very high one with immense blocks of moss-capped gneiss protruding through the soil; which latter was a carpet of beautiful flowers, the pretty Veronica predominating. Halted an hour to breakfast and to rest and at 11 A.M. commenced the ascent of Sughoo mountain, passing through a forest of small rhododendrons.\nof many kinds, only one of which was in blossom, bearing a small purple flower three quarters of an inch across, and with a leaf only one quarter of an inch in length, I also saw a quantity of a bright yellow heartsease. Reached the summit of Sughoo at noon, from whence we commenced descending, and halted for the night under some fine large cherry trees at an elevation of 11,458 feet, Ther. 65\u00b0, 1 p.m. Sughoo is the culminant point of the great Pemionchi spur that ends in the great Rungeet, and which spur is sixteen miles in length from west to east. Its western extremity being 1,200 feet above the sea, and its eastern extremity about 2,000 only.\n\nWe were now sixteen miles from the perpetual snow line, but could see nothing, as we were enveloped in a thick cloud.\n\n(To be continued.)\n\nNote on the Ruins at Maunkyala,\u2014by Major James Abbott, Boundary Commissioner, Punjab.\n\nMy tent being pitched at the tope of Maunkyala on 7th April last, I set out to examine more particularly the village and its neighbourhood. For although I had previously visited the spot more than once, I could learn of the villagers nothing confirmatory of the report, which places several smaller topes in that neighbourhood, and which would make it the site of a city that has since disappeared. During the morning several zemindars came to visit me. They, as usual, denied the existence of any other topes than the principal; but allowed that near the village of Maunkyala, building stones occurred in great number at the depth of from three to seven feet. My first object was to visit one of the diggings for such stones. It occurred on the south-west of the village, distant from it about one hundred and fifty yards. The depth at which the stones occurred was about five feet, the super-incumbent soil being a sandy clay, manured from the village. I was informed that the same occurs on digging at any portion of the village glacis; by which I mean that land which is manured from the village.\n\nThe village, as at present it exists, contains about eighty houses closely congregated together, and built entirely of the debris of the\nancient habitations. The space in which these building materials occur may be an area half or three quarters of a mile in circuit, a space which might have contained a good-sized village of two or three hundred houses. A street occurs in the village paved with massive slabs. But as this is at the very summit of the tumulus upon which the village stands, it may have been made since the destruction of the original buildings. Outside the village, however, on the north-west, the paved street appears to be original; for on one side are the remains of a foundation elaborately constructed of squared stone without cement, but accurately fitted together.\n\nThis village occupies an elevated site partly natural, partly artificial, about four hundred yards north of the Maunkyala Tope. No one, on examining superficially this site, could conjecture that beneath it are the ruins abovementioned. The soil shows no admixture with particles of brick, pottery or building stone. It appears like the natural undisturbed soil of the country.\n\nThe stones which lie beneath the soil are of two kinds, the common unsquared building stone, of which houses are built in this neighbourhood, and large slabs of sandstone carefully squared, some of them from two to four feet in length by a cubit in breadth. These occur in such numbers as to leave no doubt that a considerable building has here existed, very different in structure from the dwelling houses of the present century.\n\nOn carefully observing the surface of the neighbourhood, several mounds are apparent, which, on examination, prove to be the ruins of religious or sepulchral edifices. All of these have, I believe, been violated by that antiquarian frensy which spares neither religion nor piety, but rudely spoils alike the sepulchre and the shrine, to gratify the avarice of curiosity or of ambition. This sacrilege cannot be too much execrated. The veneration which attaches to sepulchres is so closely interwoven with religion, that its demolition endangers interests the most sacred to humanity. If we can warp our hearts to take delight in plundering the dead, how shall we respect the rights of the living?\u2014that solemn, time-honored legion who have preceded us to the unknown shore, who have explored for us the mystic path, who have dared the perils of regions without a name, that we might profit by their success or their error, and\ntread more confidently the mazes of eternity. How can we reconcile it with our conscience, with our principles, with our feelings, to drag their dust forth rudely from the tomb, or to mutilate and deface those sacred monuments which were hallowed to their hearts by association with the Author of all good? Do we rob them because they have none to act as champions for them, because there is none to call us to account? to sue us at law? If so, it is a cowardly and an unmanly plea.\n\nThe number of these mutilated monuments I reckoned to be eight or nine, but there may be others which I did not observe. Several of these have been regular topes, though now for the most part despoiled of their squared stone: a fate from which the main tope has been saved, only by the cumbrous weight of its materials.\n\nThere are also a large number of wells in this neighbourhood, frequently of oblong figure and lined with squared stones. Each of these wells may have belonged to some shrine, or have been dug as a votive offering to the religion of the spot.\n\nWe have now no means of ascertaining the traditions of Maunkyala. We know not whether the supposed sanctity of the spot led to the erection of the main tope, or whether it was the consequence of the existence there, of so considerable a shrine. But whatever the cause, it has led to the erection of many such shrines or sepulchres, and to the excavation of many wells.\n\nThe Boohists evidently delighted in water. As their religion seems to have emanated from the worship of Fire: so water, as one of the elements, seems to have been necessary to their ritual, and is found in either tank or well at all of their shrines. Many of those at Maunkyala may have been gifts to the main shrine; others belong to separate shrines of which the vestiges remain: and others may have been the work of votaries, to whom in consequence of the scarcity of water at that spot, the work had been enjoined by the priests. My small camp, of less than forty persons, daily exhausted the principal well. A few of these wells may have been designed for irrigation.\n\nFrom a careful examination of the spot, I cannot see any evidence of the existence here of a city. The area occupied by submerged ruins would not have comprised a very considerable village: whilst\nthe comparatively large number of wrought stones, denotes some costly structure which might have occupied the entire site. I rather incline to think these, the ruins of the monastery of Maiukialan described by Hiang Tsang as existing in the 6th century.\n\nIt is probable that every considerable tope was the shrine of a neighbouring monastery, where were deposited the relics of each saint of the order, as he died. The original villages of this estate may be those which still exist there; and Maunkyala itself as a village may be altogether posterior to the ruin of the monastery from the debris of which it is erected.\n\nThe arguments upon which some writers have attempted to prove the modern village of Tukhtpurri to be the ancient Taxila refute themselves. It is asserted that Tukhtpurri is Taxila, because at the distance of six miles, viz. at Maunkyala are the ruins of a large city. Were this the case, Maunkyala might be Taxila. But in the name Maunkyala, we have no resemblance to that of Taxila; and at Tukhtpurri, which has some resemblance to the name sought, we have no ruins at all. The two places have no connection whatever, the one with the other. Tukhtpurri has no Boodhistic remains, but is built on the site of a modern Gukkur village, a mile off the high road.\n\nWhatever the origin of the veneration felt by Boodhists for the site of Maunkyala, we find it taken up and adopted by the Gukkur princes of the Dhangulli branch, who have established their cemetery about four miles to westward of the tope, in a spot remarkable for a rock of the sandstone formation, which there crops out of the soil in the figure of a natural wall.\n\nJ. Abbott.\n\nP. S.\u2014At Maunkyala very few Bactro or Seytho Greek coins are found; but from the little town of Mulpoor, distant three or four miles, some were brought me, which appear to have been received by Kuttries from the peasantry who find them in old village sites. Of these I observed the following:\u2014\n\n| The dregs of the copper coinage of the Kanerkean Dynasty | many |\n| Soter Megas | a few |\n| Ayas | a few |\nThe copper coin which appears to belong to the Cashme-\nrian Dynasties of Indo-Greeks, but is common also in the\nSind Sagur Doaba, ........................................ many\nCopper coinage of Baraoro, .................................. a few\nThe coins of Sri Ram, ........................................... a few\n\nThe prevailing coin at Mulpoor is a minute bronze coin, worth\nabout half a farthing, having on one side a rude image of Kadphises\nor Kanerkes, and on the other what appears intended for a figure of\nplenty seated. I have not met with it elsewhere.\n\nI have visited Maunkyala several times, but have found very few\ncoins or relics in that neighbourhood.\n\n-----------------------------\n\nLiterary Intelligence.\n\nThe 2nd No. (vol. vii.) of the 'Zeitschrift' of the German Oriental\nSociety contains the first half of a paper by Professor Neumann on\nearly Chinese civilization.

Dr. Max M\u00fcller notices the\nfirst portion of Dr. Ballantyne's Edition of the Mah\u00e1bhashya.\nThere is a paper by Dr. Hitzig on Gazzali's Ihja-ulum-al-din, and\nanother by Dr. Grotefend Piper on the I-king of Confucius.\n\nAmong the notices, there is a communication from Dr. Weber of\nBerlin, exposing another fictitious publication similar to that of\nSt. Croix in 1778. Some Danish missionaries imposed on by a\nTranquebar Brahmin published in the Missions berichte aus Ostindien\n(Halle 1742) a paper entitled, 'An abstract of the Yadsur Vedam, one of the four Law-books of the Brahmins.' There is also\na criticism of Pertsch's Chronicle of the family of Rajah Krishna\nChandra of Nuddeah, just published at Berlin. The Catalogues of\nMSS. in the Berlin and Leyden Libraries, which are the subject of\ntwo other interesting notices, will be more particularly mentioned\nhereafter.\n\nAn Oriental Society has been founded at Constantinople. Its\nmembers already number forty, and its first meeting was held on\nthe 11th February last. The Journal commenced by M. Cayol, is\nhenceforward to appear under the Society's auspices.\nThe 3rd No. of the same publication contains but three papers. Dr. Max M\u00fcller concludes his contributions to the knowledge of Indian philosophy, a paper commenced some time ago. Dr. Haug begins an article which will be welcome to Zend students; he gives a translation of and commentary on the forty-fourth Chapter of the Y\u0101cna. The third paper is by Professor Dillmann on the History of the Kingdom of Abyssinia.\n\nAmong the notices, is a very interesting one, by Professor Lassen, of the translation just published by Julien of the Life and Travels, in India, of Hiouen Thsang; the first vol. of the work is daily expected from Europe.\nPROCEEDINGS\n\nOF THE\n\nASIATIC SOCIETY OF BENGAL,\n\nFOR SEPTEMBER, 1853.\n\nThe Society met on the 7th instant at the usual hour.\n\nJ.

Officiating Under-Secretary to the Government of Bengal, specimens of copper smelted in Dhulbhoom, a district in the South West Frontier Agency, together with reports on the quality of the same by the Assay and Mint Masters.\n\nThe following is an extract from the Assay Master's report.\n\n\"I have the honor to report that their (the specimens') pure contents are as under:\n\nNo. 1 90 per cent.\nNo. 2 88 ditto ditto;\n\nthey both contain sulphur and iron, and seem to be fair specimens of metal imperfectly refined.\"\n\nThe Mint Master adds that on trial at the laminating rollers of the Mint both specimens were found unmallesable.\nRemains of a 12 armed Idol found on the Side of an ancient City built by Rajah M\u00fbh\u00eee P\u00fbl at Ghysabad near Moorshedabad\n4th.\u2014From Captain Layard, two slabs of basalt inscribed with P\u00e1li characters.\n\nThe following is an extract from Captain L.'s letter:\n\n\"I yesterday put on board a boat belonging to Messrs. J. and R. Watson which leaves Berhampore this morning, two stones from Ghysabad, on which you will distinguish a few characters apparently P\u00e1li in shape. I have had the stones much reduced in size, as they were over-large and heavy for carriage; but this cutting has in no way interferred with the inscriptions on them. I may again mention that the stones were built into rude steps leading up to a small Durgah, in which is said to be the tomb of Sultan Ghyas-ood-deen. The ground near the Durgah is covered with the debris of an ancient Hindu temple of Tribeni. I doubt the tomb at Ghysabad being that of Ghyas-ood-deen. One Ghyas-ood-deen reigned A. H. 769 and was buried with his two sons Zayn-oolab ideen and Wahaz-ood-deen at Peroa in a mosque called the Eklakhee. Among the early conquerors of Bengal I find a Sultan \"Hoesam-ood-deen avuz Ghyas-ood-deen;\" but he was killed near Gour in battle, by Nassir-ood-deen (the prince reigned in 609, A. H.), and was probably buried on the spot. It was near the Durgah that the small gold coins were found, which I sent to you last cold weather; others have been found lately. A twelve-armed figure, of which the enclosed is a sketch, was found during the last dry season in the bed of an old tank. The carving is rude and unfinished, and the figure here and there defective, as you may perceive. In the hand holding the sacred shell, I fancy the idol must represent Vishnu or rather his incarnation, as I know of no twelve-armed god amongst the numberless Hindu deities, nor can any pundit here enlighten me! You will see that the hands hold the saw, the boar, the lotus, a bird, a half human figure, an elephant's head, a shell and some undistinguishable object, imperfect on the stone. I have not sent the idol, as it is, as you see, mutilated (of course by Kala Pahar), but will do so if you think it worth preserving in the Museum. I think I mentioned to you before, that the country inland around Ghysabad bespeaks the site of an ancient Hindu city; numerous dry tanks, blocks of black stone, broken bricks and pottery, with the remains of fountains and roads, are everywhere to be seen. The name of the city I could not discover, but it is\nsaid to have been founded by Raj\u00e1h Muhee P\u00e1l. This Raj\u00e1h may have been one of the successors of Sumoodru P\u00e1l, the Yogee, who followed Vikrama Sen and his son Vikramaditya.\"\n\nIt was proposed by the Council that Captain Layard should be thanked for the two inscriptions and requested to forward, to the Museum, the twelve-armed figure mentioned in his letter.\n\n5th.\u2014From B\u00e1bu R\u00e1dh\u00e1n\u00e1th Shikd\u00e1r through Capt.

Where however the books, &c. may not be required for loan to another applicant, they may be retained on re-application for successive periods of three months till the end of the year.\n\n\"These applications shall certify to the books, &c. being forthcoming and in good order; and in future the receipt for delivery of all library works shall contain the valuation of the work borrowed according to the Librarian's valuation Catalogue. Books taken by\nparties resident beyond twenty miles from Calcutta to be returnable on demand, at the end of three months from the date of issue as above provided, but the Council may, in regard to books issued to such parties, dispense with their actual return by the 1st January in each year, on being satisfied that the books are in good order, and that the Society is not likely to suffer by their not being recalled to the library.\n\n\"In order to carry out the valuation part of these provisions, the Committee desire that the Librarian will commence immediately on the systematic valuation of the whole library, and proceed therewith gradually under the direction of the Secretaries until the valuation be complete as to all the printed works.\"\n\nResolved that the recommendations of the Council be adopted.\n\nRead letters:\u2014\n\n6th.\u2014From J.

Tickell's memoir on the Colehan, soliciting further information regarding the antiquities of Singhbhoom, and, in No. 186 of 1848, a native report of the existence of a ruined city in this quarter is noticed. Having traversed Singhbhoom in almost every direction, I am able to furnish some negative information on the subject, which I now offer for those who take an interest in the question.\n\n\"The only remains in the country, known to me, which have any pretensions to antiquity are those at Benez Sagur, K\u00e8ma and Nagra. The two former places have been noticed by Capt. Tickell and\ndo not, in my opinion, merit particular consideration. Capt. Tickell is said to have sent the Society a gold coin from K\u00e8sna, but I could not learn that any other of gold, silver, or copper had ever been found at K\u00e8sna, Benee Sagar, or Nagra. The offer of a reward produced some small thorn-like pieces of gold, a portion of a gold ring and some stone beads at K\u00e8sna, but elsewhere nothing.\n\n\"At Nagra, twenty-three miles S. S. E. from Chyebassa, in the jungles, are some heaps of brick in fragments, spread over a sufficient extent to warrant the supposition, that a town of moderate size once existed there. The remains of a stone-lined tank would indicate some wealth and civilization, but the ruins afford no definable trace of temple or other building. The former inhabitants of the Purgunnah having been expelled in modern times by the Coles, there is now no local tradition regarding the place. Trees of a century or two's growth flourish on the spot.\n\n\"I had some hope that information as to these ancient towns might be gleaned from the Bunsawullee of the Raja of Porahat, or from the local Pundits, but my enquiries have not been attended with success.\n\n\"I conclude that if any ruins of importance exist in this direction, they are to be looked for further South in Mohrbunj or Keunjer. The nearest known to me are those of Kiching in Keunjer, and in the opposite direction at various places in Sirgooja, about one hundred miles to the N. W. of this.\"\n\n10th.\u2014Read extract from a private letter from Col.

Edwardsii), *Myotis*\nPALLIDIVENTRIS, (Hodgson),* in spirit, \"from limestone caves near Matar Nag, N. of Islamabad\" (Kashmir),\u2014Vulpes flavescens (P), Gray,\u2020\u2014Herpestes nyula, Hodgson, var. (with bright rufous face and tail-tip),\u2021\u2014H. auropunctatus, Hodgson,\u2014Felis chaus, Guld. (v. Jacquemontii, Is. Croft., &c.),\u2014F. Huttoni, nobis, J. A. S. XV, 169.\u00a7\u2014Erinaceus\n\n* Extremely close to the European M. pipistrellus, but may readily be distinguished by the much greater length of the fore-thumb, which, with its claw, measures nearly \u00bd in. (not following the curvature of the claw). The general hue of fur of the upper-parts appears to run greyer or less fulvous, and of the under-parts to be more albescent, than in the European Pipistrelle; but there may be considerable variation of shades of colour. Capt. Hutton's Masuri Pipistrelle (J. A. S. XXI, 360), is again distinct, being of a much darker colour than the two others, and it is especially characterized by the diminutive size of the foot, which, with claws, scarcely exceeds \u00bc in.\u2014Myotis parvipes, nobis, n. s. In other respects the three species are very closely affined.\n\n\u2020 Much brighter-coloured than Afghan specimens, and the tints purer and more strongly contrasted; the legs much paler, or more rufescent and less nigrescent, than in the larger V. montanus of the sub-Himalayas generally. Size, and the proportions of skull, the same as in the Fox of Afghanistan and Persia.\n\n\u2021 Mr. Gray has recently noticed two Herpestidiae animals from Ceylon (Ann. Mag. N. H., July, 1853, p. 47). One, his Herpestes smithii, Mag. Nat. Hist. 1837, II, 578, = H. rubiginosus, Kelart, v. Ellioti, nobis, J. A. S. XX, 162, 184, XXI, 348, and inhabits also the Nilgiris and Travancore. The other, Cynictis macarthuri, Gray (loc. cit.), does not seem to be H. vulvescens (v. flavida), Kelart, J. A. S. XX, 162, 184, XXI, 348; but may nevertheless prove to be no other. A cynictis, however, should have no fifth toe to the hind-foot, which exists in H. vulvescens.\n\n\u00a7 This seems to be the same small Cat, affined to the domestic races, as that of which an imperfect skin was procured by Capt. Thomas Hutton at Kandahar; but the fur of Capt. Hutton's specimen is much longer, indicating probably the winter vesture, whereas Mr. Theobald's specimen has short fur, and might well pass for a variety of the domestic Cat, which perhaps it is I incline, however, to the opinion that it is probably one of several wild types which have merged in domestication to produce the domestic Cat. Now the resemblance of the domestic Cat of Bengal, and I believe of India generally (if not also of Egypt, Barbary, and even Spain?), to the wild F. maniculata, R\u00fcppell, is most manifest; but this is far from being the case with the tame Cats of northern Europe, the resemblance of which to the European wild Cat (F. sylvestris, Aldrovand,) becomes much stronger to an eye familiarized with the appearance of the domestic Cats of India, than to that of an observer unacquainted with the latter. It is not probable that\nF. sylvestris has more than contributed to the production of the domestic breed of northern Europe; yet sufficiently to have influenced the characters of that breed, by frequent intermixture probably in times when the domestic Cat was introduced and continued rare, while F. sylvestris was far more abundant than at present. The domestic Cats of India interbreed occasionally with F. chaus, and also with F. rubiginosa of the Coromandel coast and Ceylon, as I have been assured by Mr. Walter Elliot (vide J. A. S. XVII, 247, 559).\u2014Since the preceding note was penned, I have received the following notice from Mr. Theobald, in answer to some enquiries which I made of him.\u2014\u201cThe Felis huttoni is one of the three common wild Cats well known to Shikaris in the Salt Range,\u2014viz. F. huttoni, F. chaus, and a large black species which I have not seen. I also shot one which is similar to, but, I think, smaller than F. chaus: I have only, however, the head of it.\u201d\u2014The word \u201cblack\u201d here probably refers merely to a dark colour.\u2014\u201cI should add that the F. huttoni has red eyes.\u201d\n\n* The species is founded on the figure cited, and has never been described. General Hardwicke\u2019s specimen was from the Doab. Capt. Hutton\u2019s Hedgehog from Bubawalpur (J. A. S. XIV, 351), referred dubiously to E. collaris, is probably distinct and new. Mr. Gray\u2019s British Museum specimen, from \u201cMadras,\u201d presented by Mr. Walter Elliot, is probably E. micropus, nobis (J. A. S. XV, 170), from the Nilgiris; whence also the example in the Society\u2019s museum, the locality of which is stated to have been unknown, loc. cit. (vide J. A. S. V, 191); and this southern species, though proximately affined to E. collaris, is very obviously distinct from it. Perhaps, however, Capt. Hutton\u2019s third specimen of supposed collaris (J. A. S. XIV, 351,) may be no other, as formerly suggested (in XV, 570). It is by no means probable that a second species of Hedgehog inhabits the Nilgiris. In Nepal, Mr. Hodgson enumerates three species of this genus, E. spatangus and E. grayi of Bennet, and E. collaris, Gray (Cate. Journ. Nat. Hist. IV, 288). In Capt. Hutton\u2019s supposed E. collaris from Bubawalpur, the quills are \u201cwhite on the basal half, and jet-black on the upper half;\u201d in Mr. Theobald\u2019s three specimens from the Punjab Salt Range, the quills have their terminal third black, also the extreme base, and the rest whitish with a broad dusky ring, about equal to each whitish ring above and below it. In other respects they accord, as well as can be made out, with Hardwicke\u2019s figure. Unfortunately, there are no skulls with them (though one has since been promised by Mr. Theobald); and one of the skins is too much injured to be of any use, though the other two have been mounted. Length of tarsus, to tips of claws, 1\u00bd in. Mr. Gray also mentions an Erinaceus mentalis, Black-chinned Hedgehog,\u201d from the Himalaya: but with this we are wholly unacquainted.\nPanjal Pass), *\u2014M. Theobaldi, nobis, n. s.,\u2020\u2014Hystrix hirsutirostris, Brandt (H. leucurus, Sykes), 2 skulls,\u2014Ovis Vignei, nobis, skins of old female and of young male, also some skulls and frontlets,\u2014Capra sakin, (the Himalayan Ibex), skull of a female,\u2014Gazella cora, H. Smith (H. Bennettii, Sykes), skull and horns of male,\u2014and skulls of Sus indicus, Gray.\n\nThe most interesting of the birds are a specimen of the recently described Nucifraga multimaculata, Gould, from Kashmir,\u2014ditto of the Seesee Partridge, Ammoperdix Bonhami, from the Panjab Salt Range,\u2014a small Bunting, Euspiza, perhaps new,\u2021\u2014a new Mirafra, sent entire in spirit, as also a skin,\u00a7\u2014Accentor atrogularis, nobis,\u2014and Corydalla rufulla, (Jerdon); the last being a species which was discovered on the Nilgiris, but whose chief range would now appear to be the N. W. Himalaya.\n\nAlso a fresh-water Crab (Thelphusa).\n\n3. Fulwar Skipwith, Esq., C. S. Skin of Rhizomys pruinosus, nobis, J. A. S. XX, 519, from Sylhet.\n\n* The same Mouse, to all appearance, as one sent by Capt. Sherwill from Darjiling (ante. p. 409); but certainly not the young of M. urbanus, Hodgson, the description of which seems to indicate the M. manni, Gray, or common House Mouse of all India.\n\n\u2020 Like M. gerbillinus, nobis (ante p. 410); but larger, with comparatively shorter tail and larger feet. Dimensions of an adult female.\u2014Length of head and body 2\u00bd in.; tail 2\u00bd in.; ears \u00bd in.; tarse and toes \u00bd in.\n\n\u2021 Euspiza, female. Length 5\u00bd in.; of wing nearly 3 in.; and tail 2\u00bd in. Brown, with narrow medial dusky streaks to coronal feathers, and a conspicuous pale narrow supercilium; shoulder of wing and margins of the alars deep maroon-brown; lower parts rufescent, streakless. Legs pale.\n\n\u00a7 M. phoenicuroides, nobis. Affined to M. phoenicura, Franklin, but the general hue less rufescent; the under-parts pale fulvous-grey, albescent on throat; tail brown, faintly rufescent at its extreme base, and on the exterior web of the outermost feather; broad margins to inner webs of the primaries and secondaries, with the axillaries, also pale rufescent, imparting this hue to the inner surface of the wing. Wing 3\u00bd in., the short first primary 1\u00bd in., and 1\u00bd in. shorter than the second, which is \u00bd in. less than the next three, which are equal. Tail 2\u00bd in.; bill to gape \u00bd in.; tarse \u00bd in.; and hind-claw \u00bc in. Hab. Kashmir.\n\nThere are also the wings and feet of a large female Carpodacus (apparently); the wings measuring 4\u00bd in., with tertiaries 1\u00bd in. shorter than the primaries; and tarse 1 in.\n4. Capt. M. Turnbull. A fresh specimen of *Sciurus hypoleucus*, Horsf., \"from the Straits.\" Sumatra is the habitat of this species; and not Madagascar, as stated by Col. Hamilton Smith, in his volume on mammalia in the 'Naturalist's Library.' It belongs to the true S. E. Asiatic type of gigantic Squirrels.\n\n5. Mr. J. Harley. A dead *Loris domicella*.\n\n6. From Barrackpore. Dead specimens of *Nycticebus tardigradus*, *Hystrix bengalensis*, and *Phasianus torquatus*.\n\n7. From myself. Various specimens in spirit procured by C. S. Bowring, Esq., in Hongkong. Among them is a small Bat, which is probably *Scotophilus irretitus* (*Vespertilio irretitus*, Cantor, *Ann. Nat. Hist.* IX, 481). Form typical, with two pairs of permanent upper incisors. Entire length of female 3\u00bd in., of which tail 1\u00bd in. Expanse 8\u00bd in. Forearm 1\u00be in. Tarse \u00bd in. Ears (posteriorly) \u00bc in. Colour brown-black, with slight pale tips to the fur of the upper-parts; below somewhat less deep-coloured, with the pale tips to the fur more developed, and towards the vent and base of thighs the prevailing hue is whitish. Ears, limbs and membranes uniformly blackish. V. irretitus from Chusan, as described by Dr. Cantor, accords in dimensions; but the fur of the upper-parts is given as \"soft brownish-grey; that of the abdomen dust-coloured.\" According to my recollection, however, of Dr. Cantor's specimen, it was as dark as the female now before me; for I especially remember suspecting its identity with the common minute species of all India, Sc. coromandelianus, (F. Cuv.), which I have likewise seen from Singapore.\n\nOf reptiles, are included an apparently new Scinque (*Plestiodon quadlineatum*, nobis),\u2014a small *Hemidactylus*,\u2014*Coronella russellii*, *Coluber radiatus*; *Dipsas multimaculata*, *Tropidonotus umbratus*, and *Hydros striatus*, with also a few *Insecta* and other sundries which do not need to be here enumerated.\n\nE.

From Captain Young, Rangoon, a large slab of marble,\nbearing a figure of the impression of the foot of Guadama.\n\n6th. From the British Government through Her Majesty's\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, two copies of a sketch of the Bornu or Kanuri language, with dialogues, translations and vocabulary drawn up by Mr. Norris, translator of foreign languages in the Foreign Office, from papers sent to England by the late Mr. James Richardson while employed in the interior of Africa.\n\nMr. Addington's letter points out \"that the grammatical sketch is confined to the Bornu language, and the lithographic fac-similes contain materials for a work in the Hansa or Soudanese language also; of which language, however, there is already a Grammar in print by the Rev. Mr. Sch\u00f6a.\"\n\n7th. From Major Saunders Alexius Abbott through Major J. Abbott, three silver Greek coins.\n\nThe following is an extract from Major J. Abbott's letter.\n\n\"I have the pleasure to send, in this packet from my brother Major Saunders Alexius Abbott, Deputy Commissioner of Hoshiarpoor, a silver coin which I do not remember to have seen described. It is a hemidrachm of the Arianian king Dionusos, and seems entitled to hold place immediately after the coinage of Apollodotos and immediately before that of Zoilos. As, however, I am travelling and have no means of reference to the list of coins, my memory may deceive me as to its rarity.\n\n\"Like the circular hemidrachms of Apollodotos the execution is very rude and far inferior to that of the copper coinage of the latter king.\n\nThe type is as follows:\n\nHead of the King facing the East.\n\n\u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a9\u03a4\u0397\u03a1\u039f\u03a3 \u0394\u0399\u039f\u039d\u03a5\u03a3\u0399\u039f\u03a5.\n\nR. Pallas with the \u00c6gis thundering.\n\n\"Four coins of this type, with about thirty other silver coins of the same figures and size, were found together by a little boy, as he dug in the bank of a village near Anundpoor, Makowal, on the left bank of the Sutlej above Roopur. Of these coins one was of Lusias, several were of Zoilos, and the rest were of Apollodotos. All so much resembled one another (that of Lusias excepted) as to be easily mistaken for coins of a single type.\n\n\"The use of the title Soter and the appearance of Pallas thundering, seem to ally these coins with the coinage of Menander, Apol-\nlodotos and Zoilos, while the occurrence of the coins together, seems to give additional probability to the alliance.\n\n\"I have the pleasure to add in my brother's name a coin of Zoilos found with the above and another of Apollodotos. The latter, differing somewhat in type from those in my collection, may possibly be acceptable to the Society.\"\n\n8th. From Major Turton, specimen of a fossil root from Prome (vide Proceedings for July last.)\n\n9th. From Major Baker, on the part of Major H. Fraser, specimens of fossil shells from the banks of the Irrawaddy at Prome.\n\n10th. From Dr. Fayrer, Rangoon, a Burmese water jar of curious construction.\n\n11th. From Captain Layard, a twelve-armed figure found in a tank at Ghysabad (vide Proceedings for the last month.)\n\n12th. From E. C. Craster, Esq., C. S., a gold coin of Toghlaq Shah found in the ruins of Gour.\n\nRead a note from G. B. French, Esq. requesting to withdraw his name from the list of members.\n\nCommunications were received:\n\n1st. From Walter Elliot, Esq. Vizagapatam, enclosing a list of Tamil and Canarese works, published at the press of the London Missionary Society, Ballery.\n\n2nd. From B\u00e9bu R\u00e1dh\u00e1n\u00e1th Sikd\u00e1r, Superintendent of the Observatory, through Captain Thuillier, enclosing Meteorological Registers kept at the Surveyor General's Office, Calcutta, for the months of March, April, May, June, July and August, 1853.\n\n3rd. From W. Muir, Esq. enclosing copy of Meteorological Register kept at the Government Secretariat Office, Agra, for the month of May, 1853.\n\n4th. From Major J. Abbott, Deputy Commissioner in the Hazara, communicating note of an investigation which he has recently made of the ruins at Maunkyal\u00e1.\n\nResolved that the paper be published in the Journal.\n\n5th. From G. Couper, Esq., Officiating Secretary to the Government of India, enclosing correspondence, received from the Bombay Government, on the subject of chintz printing at Tatte in Scinde.\n\n6th. From Norton Shaw, Esq., Secretary, Geographical Society, London, acknowledging receipt of Journal No. 89.\n7th. From John Barlow, Esq., Secretary Royal Institution, London, acknowledging receipt of the Catalogue of Birds.\n\n8th. From H. Piddington, Esq., Curator, Museum of Economic Geology, submitting a note on Nepalite, believed to be a new mineral from the neighbourhood of Kathmandoo.\n\nThe Curators and the Librarian submitted reports of additions made to their respective departments during the past month.\n\nThanks having been voted for the above donations and communications, the meeting adjourned.\n\nRead and confirmed,\n\n(Signed) J. W. COLVILLE.\n\nNov. 2nd, 1853.\n\nReport of Zoological Curator for September Meeting.\n\nAt the last meeting of the Society, it was mentioned by the President that Dr. A. Campbell of Darjiling had forwarded some skins for our museum, of mammalia from Tibet. These have since come to hand, and two of them seem to pertain to species hitherto undescribed.\n\nOne is an imperfect skin of a Bear, termed by Dr. Campbell the \"Blue Bear of Tibet. The people assure me,\" he writes, \"that it is not an accidental colour, but that it is a well known species, distinct from TIBETANUS, and from the white one or Arctic species\" (qu. ISABELLINUS, mentioned subsequently by Dr. Campbell). \"I am trying to get a skull, and a perfect skin for the Society.\" This Bear has a fine coat, of longer and softer fur than in cis-Himalayan TIBETANUS, but not so long nor shaggy as in fine specimens of ISABELLINUS: the colour black, with hoary or light brown tips which impart a very characteristic appearance; hence PAULINOSUS would be an appropriate name, if it prove to be a distinct species. The hoary tips to the fur disappear upon the limbs, which are wholly black (so much of them at least as are shewn in the specimen); and there is the same narrow white V-like mark on the breast as in the Himalayan Bear known as U. TIBETANUS,\u2014of which my impression is that this Tibetan animal will prove to be a trans-nivean variety, and that the name TIBETANUS, therefore, is more correctly applicable to the species than has been supposed.\n\nTwo Badger skins are sent, evidently of distinct species and even genera. One is the TAXIDRA LEUCURAUS described and figured by Mr. Hodgson in J. A. S. XVI, 763. The other is a true MELES affined to the European Badger, but which I adjudge to be distinct because it has a\nwhite throat, whereas the European Badger (of which we possess two mounted specimens for comparison) has constantly a black throat. From the *Taxidea* of Tibet it differs altogether, as much as the European Badger differs from the N. American *Taxidea*: it has smaller and much less tufted ears, a shorter and much less brushy tail, and the fur shorter and coarser, though of finer texture than in the European Badger, with much woolly hair at its base. General colour as in *Meles taxus*, but the throat white as aforesaid, and the markings of the face are different. In *M. taxus* the head is white, and a broad and well defined blackish-brown band commences midway to the eye and muzzle, is continued through the eye and ear, and gradually disappears upon the shoulder; the bands of the two sides leaving a broad and well defined white interspace, which contracts and is gradually lost posterior to the ears. In the Tibetan Badger (*M. albogularis*, nobis), the white interspace referred to contracts immediately behind the eyes, and continues as a narrow and ill defined band so far as between the ears only; the lateral dark bands proportionally expanding behind the eyes, and all merging in the grizzled hue of the back from the occiput, and not from the shoulder backward as in *M. taxus*. In the European Badger the cheeks are broadly white, bordered above by the dark band through the eye, and below by the black throat. In the Tibetan Badger there is little white below the eye, and this ill-defined; and it is bordered below by a narrow dark band, beyond which is the white throat. I do not doubt that these distinctions will prove permanent, as the European Badger is not subject to vary in its peculiar markings (though some affined animals, as the American Skunks and African Zorilles, certainly do, to a greater or less extent in different species). The Tibetan Badger is probably also a smaller animal than that of Europe.*\n\nWhile examining our series of the Badger group, my attention was attracted to another undescribed species, which I have recognised as dis-\n\n*N. B.* It would seem that Mr. Hodgson has figured the exterior of the Tibetan *Taxidea*, and the skull of the Tibetan *Meles* as that of the *Taxidea*; little suspecting the existence of a true *Meles* also in Tibet. In this case, the Tibetan true Badger would be fully as large as that of Europe. It is also probable that the identical specimens were forwarded to the Hon'ble Company's museum by Mr. Hodgson, being those noticed by Mr. Gray in *Ann. Mag. N. H.* Sept. 1853, p. 221. There can, assuredly, not be the least doubt of the specific, if not generic, distinctness of the two Tibetan specimens now sent by Dr. Campbell, although the skulls of both are unfortunately wanting.\ntinct for many years, but awaited further information concerning its distribution, &c., before bringing it to notice in the Society's Journal. This is a second species of *Bhaloo-soor* or Hog-badger, which may be designated\u2014\n\n*Arctonyx taxoides*, nobis, n.s. Adult about half the size of the adult of *A. collaris*, F. Cuv.: having a much longer and finer coat, very like that of the European Badger but softer, though not so long and soft as in *Taxidea*; the muzzle less broad and Hog-like than in *A. collaris*; the ears also are proportionally smaller than in that species; the tail is shorter; and the colours and markings, though similar, are much brighter. Greatest length of skull of a fully adult (but not aged) male of *A. collaris*, 6\u00bd in.; greatest breadth of zygomatics, posteriorly, 3\u00bd in.; length of bony palate 4 in.; width at posterior great molar 1\u00bd in. In an aged female *A. collaris*, the same admeasurements are 6\u00bd, 3\u00bd, 3\u00bd, and 1\u00bd in. In a fully adult female of *A. taxoides*, 4\u00bd, 2\u00bd, 2\u00bd and 1\u00bd in. Dentition of the upper jaw similar in the two species; in the lower jaw, the interspace between the second and third premolars is proportionally much greater in *A. collaris* than in *A. taxoides*. Lastly, the large species attains with age a strongly marked sagittal crest, which I doubt is ever seen in the other. Our two specimens of *A. taxoides* are respectively from Asam and Arakan; so that both species inhabit the same range of territory, and are probably commonest in Sylhet.\n\nTwo other skins sent by Dr. Campbell are those of the Tibetan Lynx (*F. isabellina*, nobis, *J. A. S.* XVI, 1178), and of the *Felis macrocelis* (*v. macroceloides*, Hodgson). Of the latter, we previously possessed two mounted specimens, both sent from Darjiling; and a skin from the Ya-ma-dong mountains which separate Arakan from Pegu. I also lately saw two living specimens from Upper Asam; and have been assured, on good authority, that the species is not uncommon in the north of China. Mr. Hodgson states it to inhabit Tibet; and it was originally discovered by Raffles in the mountains of Sumatra. At least, no satisfactory distinction has been pointed out between *macrocelis* of Sumatra and *macroceloides* of Tibet; and as the latter is positively the same from Upper Asam and the mountains of Arakan, there would be nought remarkable in its range extending along the mountainous spine of the Malayan peninsula and that also of Sumatra. A nearly affined but much smaller species, common in the Malayan Peninsula, is *F. marmorata*; and this also we have from Upper Asam! (*J. A. S.* XVII, 83.) Both are about the most eminently arboreal of the Cat tribe, judging from the Asamese specimens which I saw alive, and which were most graceful and accomplished climbers, with much of the action,\nprobably, of the diminutive *Phionodon*. The large *P. uncia* has also nearly the same proportions, with similar very long and well-furred tail; and it may prove to be equally arboreal in the mountain pine-forests. The proper ground Cats for little wooded districts are the Lynxes, which are the extreme opposites in structure to the true Leopard group, wherein the three preceding species are comprised. Yet even the Lynxes are not bad climbers; whereas there are some few Cats, as the three largest of all, the Lion, Tiger, and Jaguar, which never ascend trees, as the Leopard does so very commonly. That the Cheeta (*P. jubata*) is no climber, is much less to be wondered at.\n\nTogether with the male specimen of the *Shou*, or Tibetan Stag, presented on a former occasion by Dr. Campbell,\u2014the horns of which are far from having attained a first-rate magnitude, as shewn by Mr. Hodgson's figure and description in *J. A.: S.* X, 722, as well as by his subsequent description, *ibid.* XX, 388,\u2014I have now the pleasure of exhibiting for comparison a noble frontlet and horns of the *Wapiti* Stag of N. America, *C. canadensis*. To any person who has made a study of the subject, and is conversant with the essential distinctions observable among the horns of different species of Deer, over and above the variations to which all are liable, those specific distinctions are exceedingly well marked in the horns of the *Shou* and of the *Wapiti*. As long ago stated by me of a fine Stag-horn from Kashmir, the species being (as I now feel more than ever confident) the same as that of Tibet, of Persia (where known as the *Maral*), and in all probability that of the southern parts of Siberia and of the north of China,\u2014\u201cthe general character of horn [of the great Asiatic Stag] is intermediate to that of the *Wapiti* and European Stag, but agreeing more nearly with the latter in its kind of granulated surface.\u201d* With the horns of all three species now before me, aided by familiar recollection of numerous horns of *C. elaphus*, the typical character of the latter, or European Stag, is to have the most roughly granulated surface to the horn, decidedly; in the Asian Stag, the rugosity is well marked, but smoothened a good deal, so as to be much less harsh to the feel; and in the N. American Stag there is scarcely any roughness whatever, the horn being smoother than in the Fallow Deer. Hence I suspect that, in the great majority of instances, these horns might be readily enough distinguished by the feel alone. Next, the tendency to flatten, or palmate, in the crown of the *Wapiti* horn is very decided, from the base of the median on \u201croyal antler\u201d upward or onward. The utmost transverse depth of this palmature, at the base of the main fork of the crown, in the\n\n*Proc. Zool. Soc. 1840, p. 86.*\npair of *Wapiti* horns now exhibited, amounts to 7 in., by 1\u00bd in. breadth. Nothing of the kind is ever seen in the European Stag, nor (it would seem) in the Asian species. Again, the tendency in the *Wapiti* is to have the crown not only flattened, but further subdivided than in the Asian *Shou*, in which, we may now venture to affirm, it rarely more than simply bifurcates; but Capt. Cunningham assured Mr. Hodgson that \"the Kashmir Stag has, sometimes, a double fork at the top of its horns.\"* Such is shewn in the *Wapiti* horns now before the meeting; the crown first bifurcating, with a considerable amount of palmation as already described, this flattening being continued on each branch, and the hinder of these again bifurcating, while the anterior bifurcates imperfectly on the left horn, and tends towards the same form on the right horn; the posterior prong of the anterior main branch of each crown being the defective ones.\n\nNext (and this I remember well to be characteristic of the *Wapiti*), the posterior main branch of the crown does not slant somewhat abruptly inwards, like the usually undivided posterior prong of the (in general) simply bifurcating crown of the Asian *Shou*, but inclines directly backward and somewhat downward, with a tendency to subdivide again and again, as shewn in the otherwise abnormal *Wapiti* horn (No. 4) figured in *J. A. S.* X, plate 4, p. 750. Another marked and distinctive character of an average *Shou* horn is the comparatively very abrupt bend of the beam from the base of the median or royal antler, which, with the equally abrupt slant inward of the posterior prong of the bifurcating crown, imparts a sort of lyrate aspect to the pair, very different from the more even curvature of beam seen in the *Wapiti*. Lastly, still another character very commonly present in *Wapiti* horns, and scarcely if ever seen in those of the *Shou* and European Stag, consists in the presence of a small snag between the bases of the brow and bez antlers, and a little to the front; which is distinctly shewn, though small, in both horns of the pair before us.\n\n2. To Babu Rajendra Mallika, we are indebted for a fine stuffed specimen of a young Cassowary, retaining much of the brown plumage of youth, though at the time of its death it was putting forth the black plumage of maturity; and the two are throughout intermixed in the specimen. Also a dead Rose-breasted Cockatoo (*Cacatua ros*) and a broken egg of *Cygnus atratus*.\n\n3. From Dr. Fayrer, late of Rangoon.

Sundhukphoo mountain S. 11\u00b0 W.\n\nTo the south-east the Teesta river was distinctly visible in the plains south of the Morung Forest. To the north Kunchinjinga towered over the high peaks of Singaleelah.\n\nLooking to the west, the snowy range of Nepal, grander in its proportions, if any thing, than the Darjeeling range, Kunchinjinga always excepted, and the cultivated valleys of Nepal and some very remarkable rocky and sterile peaks standing between the perpetual snows and the upper limits of vegetation, presented us with a view\n\n* Ten \"permanent,\" Dong \"resting-place.\" \u2020 Tonglo \"Cotton tree.\"\n\nNo. LXI.V\u2014New Series. Vol. XXII.\nthat very speedily made us forget all the labour we had gone through the previous week. As we proceeded we looked down into the deep blue valley of the Rungbi, which at this point is about 10,000 feet deep. The eye, in looking down these stupendous valleys, wanders from the tough arctic lichen and snow rhododendron at the observer's feet over fine forests of fir trees, rhododendron, birch, oak, on the slopes of the mountains, down to the tropical trees and plants, plantains, bamboos and gigantic grasses in the valleys. The scenery was now rapidly changing; instead of the suffocating heat of the valleys with their abundant tropical vegetation, we were breathing a bracing pure air, with the Thermometer standing at 41\u00b0; the trees were small; of soil there was but a very scanty sprinkling under our feet, and looking either to the east or the west a wild confused snowy scene, treeless mountains, rocky peaks destitute of vegetation, bare precipices and deep\u2014profoundly deep\u2014valleys had replaced our hitherto confined view.\n\nAt 8-30 we arrived at a foot path descending towards Nepal; at this spot were the remains of a Gurung's hut and a small shallow pool of water measuring 150 by 30 feet.\n\nAt this spot I measured a cherry tree and ascertained it to be twelve feet in circumference. Plants and trees met with this morning were rhododendrons of many kinds, from the rhododendron with a leaf fourteen inches in length with a deep ferruginous tinge on the under side of the leaf to the small aromatic rhododendron with a leaf only \u00bdth of an inch in length, bearing a purple flower; yellow hearts-ease, rose, hypericum of several kinds, one thorny with a yellow flower, thistle, hemlock, yellow-flowered potentilla, dock garlic with a pink flower, and many others.\n\nThe sheep track to-day was almost entirely over bare gneiss rock, in which were fine crystals of schorl.\n\nDuring this march we passed several caves in the gneiss called by the Lepchas, L'haps, into which they, with solemn faces assured us, their Lamas can with a lighted candle in hand, travel subterraneously from one mountain to another\u2014no one besides the Lamas possessing this faculty.\n\nAt 11 A. M. we came upon the tracks of the Sippiyook or wild sheep, an enormous animal judging by his foot-print, at a spot where\nthe ridge of Singaleelah is split into two ridges, the whole being composed of precipices and naked masses of gneiss rock affording in its crevices a place for a sweetly scented rhododendron, a pretty white primula and a large ox-eye looking composite flower growing upon a long stem. For half an hour after leaving this curious spot, our track lay under a vast precipice of gneiss from which the earthquakes, which are so frequent in these mountains, have hurled down large masses of rock, and in this dangerous spot the Gurungs have ventured to erect their huts even under the most dangerous and incoherent rocks. The whole face of the precipice is split into cuboidal masses, piled one upon the other and which threaten hourly descent. In one of the detached cubes of gneiss I noticed a band of greenstone six inches in width extending for sixty feet along the front of the rock. Under this insecure-looking rock were the remains of a Gurung encampment. This mountain is the Dumdongla of Hooker; a footpath leading from Sikkim towards Nepal, here crosses Singaleelah and is called the Dumdongla pass.\n\nAt 2 p.m. we again regained the crest of Singaleelah, where we saw an old spring set for the capture of pheasants; a few minutes afterwards a covey rose close to us, from which I managed to bag a brace; of these welcome birds our Lepchas made us a delicious curry in the evening, the first hot meal we had had for nine days.\n\nEncamped for the night at the southern foot of Kanglanamo mountain at an elevation of 12,317 feet in a dense fog which during the night condensed into heavy rain. At the foot of this mountain the Lepchas collected a quantity of a white lichen which grows in long white filaments; they called it, B\u00fakh; it is used as incense to burn before their gods.\n\nAugust 11th, 1852.\u2014A most lovely clear morning, the perpetual snow is only eight miles ahead of us; the air very cold, Thermometer standing at 41\u00b0 at sunrise; half an hour's walking brought us at 7.45 A.M. to the base of the conical-shaped Kanglanamo, and three quarters of an hour more and we stood upon the summit at about 13,000 feet elevation towering over every peak to the south. At the base of the mountain there are quantities of a dark and glossy hornblende slate mixed with the gneiss apparently split and fractured by the snow and frost of winter. In Hooker's Map of\nSikkim, Kanglanamo is made to appear covered with perpetual snow; this is a mistake, as I found the following plants on its summit and no snow; yellow and purple aromatic rhododendrons and another kind, rose, pyrus americana, and many small flowers.\n\nThe stratification of the gneiss at this elevation is perfectly horizontal, and in no way contorted, as it is at 7,000 feet and lower\u2014associated with the gneiss on Kanglanamo is much hornblende and a black micaceous slate, green felspar, veins of snow-white quartz and masses of black mica.\n\nThe view from the summit of Kanglanamo is very extensive, embracing as it does nearly two hundred miles of the Nepal snowy range, and showing the junction of Kunchinjinga with the Nepal range: a sharp peak bearing a little to the north of west, distant 200 miles, that has been visible for two days, but has barely altered its bearing I imagine to be Gosainthan mountain, directly north of Catmandu; so that from Gosainthan mountain on the west round by the Nepal snowy range passing round by Kunchinjinga, Pundeem, the eastern snowy range down southward to Cholah\u2014we had a glorious panorama of three hundred miles of perpetual snow, peak towering above peak, all approach to which appears guarded by steep, precipitous and bare rocky mountains. Looking to the south the plains of Bengal appear but a very few miles distant, although sixty miles removed, and on a very clear day the Rajmuhal Hills south of the Ganges distant 165 miles must be visible, as they are from lower elevations. Chumulari could not be seen, though I searched well for him\u2014probably haze or clouds shut him out from our view. On the north-west we could see the Wallanchun and Kanglachema passes into Tibet, forty miles distant. Over these passes salt is brought from the salt lakes in Tibet. The salt is laden first upon men's backs, who with much difficulty convey it over a dangerous portion of the pass, it is then transferred to the backs of sheep who convey it over the narrow footpaths of the great elevations; from the sheep it is transferred to yaks, from yaks to bullocks and eventually, when nearing the plains, it is transferred to carts.\n\nThere is a strange prophecy amongst the Bhotias concerning these salt lakes, it is as follows: In the salt lake region there is one large lake from which no salt has hitherto been obtained by reason\nof the great quantity of water in the lake; this lake it is prophesied will in time dry up as the others have done, and that when salt can be procured from the lake, it will be carried away over the passes by a white nation who will come from the south, and who will seize upon the lakes as their own.\n\nThe lake is said to have commenced drying up lately, and it is expected that salt will be obtainable from it in a few years.\n\nOne European and only one (Dr. Hooker) has visited these passes.\n\nOne mountain in the Nepal range is a most remarkable object, both for its curious shape and for its immense height, its name none of my party knew, nor have I yet succeeded in obtaining the name. The peak is a hollow crater-like mountain probably 27,000 feet in height with a long table-mountain attached to it, both covered with glaciers. To the west of this great mountain are five distinct peaks separating the large mountain from a hollow shell-like and perpendicular mountain about 26,000 feet in height. The morning sun shining upon this mass of snow, gave it the appearance of a gigantic pearl-shell set upon its edge, the snow on the surface being of a bright pink colour. From the peculiar hollow curved and perpendicular nature of this mountain, it resembles the crater of a Volcano broken down on one side; beneath this range of snowy mountains there is a range of bare mountains of a deep red colour about 19,000 feet in height, broken into thousands of ravines, and totally destitute of vegetation.\n\nAt 9 A.M. we got a glimpse of an inhabited Gurung's hut far away upon a lofty mountain in Nepal, the flocks of white sheep looking like small patches upon the mountain side.\n\nAt a small trickle of water where we halted to breakfast, long slender and entirely white worms were abundant in the water; they resembled long pieces of white thread. The Lepchas seemed to hold them in great dread, and would on no account touch them. The crest of Singaleelah at this spot is a precipitous jagged and rocky mountain which necessitated us to descend several hundred feet into the Nepal territory. At 11 A.M. the path led us through a swampy tract of country with several pools of good water, numerous streams flowing to the westward over slaty gneiss. On a patch of luxuriant grass near the pools of water, I turned out from under a\nslab of gneiss, one of those curious little animals the Neodon sik-\nkimensis whose habits and proportions resemble that of the Arvicola,\nbut the tail is comparatively short; length from snout to the root\nof the tail five inches\u2014of the tail 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) inch. This genus was disco-\nvered by Mr. B. H. Hodgson in Upper India. From amongst the\nrhododendron bushes, we put up a large number of the beautiful\nscarlet-legged and three-spurred pheasants, of which I only bagged\none; in the marshy ground great quantities of a beautiful primrose\nwere in full blossom\u2014also chrysanthemum, a blue dock, dwarf\nrhododendrons, grass in abundance, many beautiful flowers and\npotentilla; as we were admiring these beauties, we heard the deep\nbarking of the Gurung\u2019s dogs betokening the vicinity to one of their\nlarge flocks. A Nepalese of our party was sent on ahead to have\nthe fierce dogs called off, or the better part of our party would have\nbeen torn to pieces by these ferocious brutes. We soon came up\nto the Gurungs seven in number, fine athletic looking Hindus with\nvery scant clothing. They stood in the midst of their flock of three\nhundred sheep surrounded by their fine-looking dogs which resemble\nthe Newfoundland breed. These shepherds had pitched their one\nlong mat-hut twenty feet in length upon a grassy knoll under the\nshadow of some rhododendron trees. They called the country Is-\nsunghee, and said that they were moving downwards, having con-\nsumed all the grass nearer the snows. Their sheep, which are of a\nvery large breed, were in excellent condition, and some of the wethers\nof a size unknown in England; they asked eight rupees for a large\nwether, from whose carcass twenty men might have been well fed:\nIn the hut we found the Sirdar or chief, Pahulmun by name, of\nChynepoor in Nepal; he told me that he had five brothers each\nowning a flock of sheep, and that they were all upon the neigh-\nbouring mountains. The wool from these sheep is converted into\nvery good blankets, several of which I saw in the tent\u2014the Gurungs\nappeared to be well fed, their food consisting of mutton and Indian\ncorn, heaps of the latter were being weighed out in the tent\nprior to being cooked for dinner. The men had an abundance of\ngood brass cooking pots and blankets, and the Sirdar was armed with\na handsome silver-mounted kookree or Nepal knife:\u2014snow falls here\nearly in October\u2014elevation about 12,000 feet.\nNot being able to come to any terms about the purchase of some sheep, we left the Gurung's hut, and descended a few hundred feet under the guidance of one of the Gurungs to a fir forest, from whence we again ascended and encamped at one p.m. upon a grassy mountain covered with sheep tracks and overhanging the deep valley of the Yung-ya river. We were above the line of firs at 12,109 feet, Thermometer 56\u00b0; my breathing was very much affected, and it was with great difficulty I managed the last ascent, and with greater difficulty I managed to bag a beautiful scarlet-legged pheasant.\n\nOur Lepchas, who are the most timid of mortals, appeared rather frightened at being in Nepal, especially as the Gurung Sirdar had been questioning them as to the meaning of our party coming into Nepal. He was informed that the rocky nature of the summit of Singaleelah was the reason we were in the Nepal territory, and that had it been possible to have avoided crossing the Sikkim boundary, we would not have done so. The Sirdar said, it was all very well talking, but he knew very well that we had come to examine the boundary, and that he would report our party to the Nepal Durbar, which we suppose he did, as we saw a messenger depart that very afternoon towards the west.\n\nTowards the evening the Gurungs brought some dead sheep for sale that had been killed on account of sickness produced by eating the aconitum. The Gurungs watch the animal that has partaken of this deadly plant, and if they find there is no chance of its living, its throat is cut and the carcass eaten. The wool is first cut off close and the stumps singed until the animal appears dressed in parchment. Strange to say the Lepchas, who will eat snakes, frogs and other extraordinary food, would not partake of these diseased sheep, the two carcasses therefore that I purchased were made over to the Nepalese Hindoo coolies, four in number, who consumed the two sheep in two days.\n\nAcross a deep valley immediately opposite or west of our small encampment, was an immense cascade falling by a succession of leaps from upwards of 3,000 feet down into the valley of the Yung-ya river. To our east the ragged and serrated crest of Singaleelah rose some thousand feet above us, the horizontal masses of gneiss being destitute of any vegetation. About 2,000 feet above our camp,\nupon the Singaleelah slopes I discerned several white objects like men; I sent off a Lepcha for one, and it turned out to be a mountain rhubarb plant, one of the handsomest botanical objects I ever remember to have seen. It consists of a conical assemblage of buff-coloured leaves of great beauty elegantly crimped, and edged with pink; the whole growing upon a substantial stem, upon which and hidden by the graceful leaves are bundles of flowers and triangular seeds somewhat resembling mignonette\u2014the plant measures forty-five inches in diameter at the base of the cone, and is about the same height. The Lepchas call it \"Chookoor Dong;\" the stem is eaten by the Hill people, it is extremely acid and astringent.\n\nAugust 12th, 1852. Woodcocks were heard overhead at daybreak. Further south upon the summit of Singaleelah there are a considerable number of these birds.\n\nStarted at 6 A. M. Thermometer 41\u00b0, our road was up a narrow grassy gorge in the mountain; some of the snowy peaks were seen peering over the tail of Kubra on our left, about five miles distant\u2014a few hundred feet rise, brought us to the top of the Kanglanamo pass, a gap in the crest of Singaleelah, affording during the summer months a means of communication between Sikkim and Nepal. This is the pass, so I have been informed, by which Dr. Hooker endeavoured to force his way from Nepal to Sikkim, but was prevented by the deep snow. The pass I calculate to be 12,600 feet, but I did not take the height.\n\nThe rocks on the crest of Singaleelah at the pass are of horizontal gneiss, castellated and shattered by the frost, on the right hand side of the pass the rock has been worn into the very image of a man sitting with his hands upon his knees, dressed in a robe and crowned with a Scotch cap with a conspicuous tuft on its top. The whole figure is about fourteen feet in height; the figure by all parties was declared to be the Rajah of Sikkim guarding his boundary.\n\nFrom the pass, the weather being very fine and the air clear, we had an extensive view of the plains, the Teesta river, the eastern snowy range and of Darjeeling, which latter mountain is a fine object from whatever side it is observed. Darjeeling bore south 22\u00b0 east, Tendong mountain south-east by east; we were considerably to the north of several of the snowy peaks\u2014we now left the footpath which\nThe 'Hooker Dong' or Mountain Rhubarb, found at 14,000 feet elevation.\ndescends in an easterly direction from the pass, crosses the Rungbi to Yangpoong, to scramble in a northerly direction over naked rocks under the eastern crest of Singaleelah; these rocks have been hurled from the castellated crest by the severe frosts of winter; the stratification of the gneiss being perfectly horizontal, and the individual strat exceeding minute; the Lepchas named the blocks \"Lama's books\" which indeed they resemble\u2014one of these blocks fifteen feet in height and thirty in length, was traversed by a band of white quartz a foot thick, and being of a less perishable nature than the gneiss, it stood out in bold relief at each end of the block. A thousand feet below us, we saw some pools of water standing in the midst of fine grass pasture land, the property of the Sikkim Rajah, and where his herds of yaks graze in the month of September; several stone huts were scattered about the pasture, where the yak herds shelter themselves during the night. At the present the yaks were five miles to the north at Jongri, immediately under the snow, or three days' journey from this. One mile of this rough and slippery scrambling brought us again to the crest of Singaleelah, where, to my amazement I discovered that the Singaleelah range breaks off suddenly, and that I stood upon the edge of a steep descent several thousand feet deep. Singaleelah at this spot sweeps round to the east by a great bend of one mile, and terminates in a spur that points to the south, separating the two main sources of the Rungbi river. From nearly the centre of the great curve, a narrow wall-like ledge much below the crest of Singaleelah runs to the north, and forms the only apparent connection of Singaleelah with the snows. Looking down into the deep valleys to the right and to the left, whose waters are separated by the narrow ledge above-mentioned, the eye rests upon a curious scene; the valleys, destitute of any vegetation and filled with pools of water, have been scoured from end to end by the action of either heavy masses of moving snow or by glaciers, the loose rocks are piled up in confusion, in some places, to the height of several hundred feet. The whole scene is one of ruin and desolation\u2014not a shrub or a plant is seen, nothing but a region of loosely piled up gneiss rocks. From this spot looking to the north-west or across the deep valley at our feet, a fine lake about a mile in length is seen perched up in a strange position upon\na high level plateau in the mountain. The water, partaking of the colour of the naked rocks that rose behind it for several thousand feet, was almost black; its shores were rocky, dark and gloomy.\n\nFrom this lake the Yungya, a feeder of the Tambur river in Nepal, takes its rise, and is seen leaving the lake by a fine cascade of 3,000 feet fall. As this lake had never been seen by any European, I have named it \"Lake Campbell,\" after my esteemed friend Dr. A. Campbell at Darjeeling.\n\nFrom this strange spot we descended to the east of the narrow ledge and found ourselves in a deep hollow, full of pools of water, and the whole surface of the valley one large moraine, the rocks of which have been driven about and piled up in wild confusion. Temperature of air at 10 A.M. was 58\u00b0 of water 52\u00b0.\n\nI was enabled this day to make some slight additions to Dr. Hooker's valuable Map of Sikkim\u2014especially as this immediate spot was not visited by that intelligent traveller.\n\nEncamped at 1 P.M. upon moss and lichen covered rocks at an elevation of 14,229 feet\u2014we had been scrambling over these loose gneiss rocks for hours, and as we had splitting headaches, we were delighted to halt, although the poor Lepchas had no wood to cook their food. The rarefaction of the air is beginning to tell upon us; bleeding at the nose, a tightness across the back of the head, is what I most suffer from. The exertion of writing, making a false step amongst the rocks, of addressing any one, stooping to tie the shoe, or performing any act requiring but moderate exertion, is productive of the most distressing symptoms of suffocation, sharp sudden pains in the chest, extreme beating of the heart, and violent action of the lungs, which being fed with a thin and rarefied air, have to work hard to keep the blood purified. I have been so prostrated this day as to be fit for nothing, which is the more strange as our elevation is not a very great one; but from all I can gather from travellers in the Himalayah, I suspect that the sufferings of travellers commencing as they do from this elevation, are more acute and more noticed as being something new and at first very alarming. One of our Nepal coolies is in great agony, moaning in a most piteous manner. During the afternoon, rain and fog shut us out from all the world. In the sheltered spots I found dwarf rhododendron, a few primroses\na butter-cup-like plant, the conical rhubarb, two andromeda, one with a pretty white bell the very image of a true heath\u2014and juniper, a few sticks of which latter tree were brought up from a distance by the Lepchas, and with them water was boiled with some difficulty at $189^\\circ 50$, or 14,229 feet.\n\nA pheasant got up from amongst the rocks, which I fired at and bagged; the concussion of the air was so intolerable and stunning, and so painful, that I was obliged to lie down for some hours before I got over it.\n\nThe fog clearing away we were enabled to see that we were in the midst of a scene of desolation and chaos, ragged rocks, black slate, moraines, land slips and steep cliffs were all that met our view near us, but to the south the plains and the intermediate ranges of mountains were all spread out before us. To the east of our encampment about one mile distant, we gradually saw the rounded mountain Gubroo, 15,000 feet, emerge from the clouds. To the north we could see nothing, as we were at some distance from the crest of a high ridge, that leaves the foot of Gubroo and sweeping round to the west, joins the high black mountains on which \"Lake Campbell\" is situated.\n\nSomewhat to our astonishment we found our tent was only a few feet removed from a precipice 300 feet deep, had one of the furious blasts of wind that are common at this elevation descended from the snows, our tent would have been hurled over the precipice and received at the bottom in a deep pool of water a few hundred feet across. Thirty feet from the shore and at the depth of twenty feet I could see rocks around, whilst the water from its great depth was quite black.\u2014A bright sun was shining overhead which would have enabled me to see the bottom perhaps at fifty feet, had the pool been so shallow. These pools during the winter are entirely frozen and covered with snow, one hundred feet deep or more, which is drifted from the heights above\u2014when this large body of snow begins to melt in the spring and summer, the rocks lying under it are pushed along with the descending mass and are heaped and piled up as we saw them. These pools form the sources of the Rungbi river which, after a course of thirty-five miles through deep valleys, falls into the great Rungeet under Rinchinpoong.\nAugust 13th, 1852. Leaving our tents, baggage and people at the encampment we ascended the loose rocky ridge to the north of us, the summit of which, 14,500 feet, we reached in half an hour; the sight that met our gaze from the top was a scene of grandeur I had never expected to see. The whole of the snowy mountains seen from Darjeeling were close to us, Kubra, 24,004 feet in height, appeared hanging over us although two and a half miles distant, but all progress northward was completely cut off, we were on the edge of a precipice many thousands of feet deep, at the bottom of which was a narrow valley running east and west with a handsome lake to the east, the water from which runs round the foot of Gubroo and falls into the Ratong. Across this valley a small ledge of rocks connects the semi-circular ridge of Gubroo with the foot of Kubra. Three similar chasms all running south-east, north-west, separated us from the perpetual snow on Kubra. The sides of the chasms are composed of a dark slaty rock, containing much hornblende, the sides being too precipitous to allow snow to rest upon them. The first and second ridges had no snow on them, the third had patches only of snow, the fourth was covered with perpetual snow, one and a half mile distant from us. These ridges are buttresses, descending from Kubra and terminate in the Ratong valley.\n\nThe Thermometer stood at 34\u00b0; the air was quite clear and bracing, allowing us a free view of the plains, Darjeeling, Nepal, the eastern snowy range and of the giant peaks to the north of us. No aid from a telescope was required to show me that the whole of the large snow-covered mountains, Kunchinjinga, Pundeem, Kubra and Junno are composed of a finely stratified rock to their very summits. By the aid of a telescope, the stratification of Kunchinjings was very distinct, both in the large naked spot, now only ten and a half miles distant, and mentioned in the first page of my diary as having been caused by the earthquake of May, as well as at the very summit which is not covered with snow, but with a pellicle of ice, snow only resting upon the ledges and peaks. The strata, which are very small and minute, dip to the north-east about 20\u00b0, all the large peaks presented the same appearance. The rocks of the Gubroo range are composed of a hard flinty parallel gneiss intermixed with much black or blue hornblende and micaceous slate, the gneiss everywhere splitting into very thin laminae as thin as roofing slates.\nImmediately to the west of Gubroo, the rocks dip to the southwest at an angle of 30\u00b0.\n\nThe dip of the strata upon the Gubroo ridge being to the southwest, and the northern face of the ridge being nearly precipitous, a great flow of water takes place towards the south, the whole surface of the mountain is divided with numerous steppes, each steppe having pools of water resting upon them averaging from one hundred to four hundred yards broad\u2014and many of them surrounded by steep walls of a fine slaty gneiss composed of hornblende, white quartz and felspar; from these pools there is a constant discharge of icy cold water which flowing away south form the Rungbi river.\n\nFrom the crest of the Gubroo range, we could see a yak herd's encampment in the direction of Jongri, or north-east of where we stood, many thousand feet below us and separated by several deep valleys.\n\nKunchinjinga, 28,177* feet above the sea was 10\u00bd miles distant.\nPundeem, ......22,015* ditto ditto 7 ditto.\nKubra, ..........24,004* ditto ditto 3 ditto.\nNursing, .......19,139* ditto ditto 12 ditto.\nTuchcham, ...14,000 (?) ditto ditto 27 ditto.\n\nWe were six miles north of Nursing; this peak from Darjeeling has the appearance of rather a blunt rounded mountain, but from our position it was an exceedingly sharp pointed peak, run into a very fine point. None of the numerous glaciers that abound at the foot of all the great peaks and in the valleys separating them, could be seen, being completely hidden by the sharp slaty ridges above mentioned.\n\nFrom the nature of the mountains surrounding Kunchinjinga, I felt convinced that any nearer approach to the great peak would hide him altogether, I therefore determined upon returning. Sitting on the ground with a rock to support my back, I with much difficulty, from the pain I was suffering from the rarefaction of the air, took a sketch of the snowy range from the most northerly attained spot in our journey, and having given one more look round this grand and wintry scene, we turned our backs upon the snow and descended to our tents at which we arrived, very cold, at 7 A.M.\n\nAugust being the month at which the snow is probably at its\n\n* Heights ascertained by Lt. Colonel Waugh, Surveyor General.\nhighest elevation, I was enabled by a series of bearings to lay down a correct outline upon Dr. Hooker's Map of the snow line in the height of summer, and which from careful observations I calculated to be about 17,000 feet; but some of the glaciers are far below this elevation, probably not higher than 12,500 feet. The great glacier at the foot of Kunchinjinga, visible from Darjeeling, is elevated about 16,000 feet.\n\nAt 8 a.m. we left our encampment and descended in a southerly direction over the loose rocks, crossing many running streams and pools of water. I particularly remarked, and that after repeated examinations, that none of these pools contained any living animal, either fish or animalcul\u00e6, nor had they any weeds, grass, nor indeed any organic matter in them. The only living things to be seen were two minute wrens hopping about the rocks. At 9 a.m. we reached a path, or rather a track marked out by the yak herdsmen by erecting large stones within sight of each other; upon a fall of snow occurring, these form their only guides through this wilderness of loose rocks; to us they were invaluable, as no one of our party had ever been where we were now threading our way, in the midst of a thick fog that obscured everything from our view. From the rocks we commenced ascending the ridge of which Gubroo forms the northern culminant point, and which separates the waters of the Ratong and Bungbi rivers. At 9.30 we reached the summit of the ridge, which to the east is precipitous, descending to the Ratong by a steep fall of about 8,000 feet. Looking back into the rocky basin we had left, and from which the fog had blown off, the view was very wild and interesting. Several landslips have taken place upon Singaleelah, uprooting large tracts of fir forest, some of which trees were seen with their roots in the air, their fine stems shivered and torn by the falling rocks.\n\nWe were much disappointed in not being able to see the view from the eastern face of the Gubroo range, as from our position, we should have been enabled to comprehend in one view all the glaciers lying at the foot of Kunchinjinga and Pundeem mountains, probably twelve in number, the nearest being five miles distant, as well as Jongri, situated upon one of the swelling buttresses of Kunchinjinga overhanging the right bank of the Ratong. Jongri\nis a yak herd's summer-post, consisting of several stone houses at a probable elevation of 14,000 feet, and is the highest spot in this region where yaks are grazed during the summer months. From Darjeeling I was enabled during some very clear weather in October and by the aid of a glass, to fix the true position of Jongri. In Dr. Hooker's Map, Yangpoong is called Jongri. Perhaps the meaning of the name Jongri applies to both places, in which case Dr. Hooker's Map would merely represent an omission of the site Jongri and not a mistake. From these glaciers flow many streams, the united water of which forms the Ratong, a feeder of the great Rungeet.\n\nThe eastern face of the Gubroo range is a handsome object in the view from Darjeeling, from whence it is seen as a bare, rocky, precipitous mountain. About 10 A.M. we reached a spot upon the almost bare rocks where there stands a yak herd's stone house composed of large slabs of gneiss rocks, some of the slabs being five feet in length. The house which is in a rather dilapidated condition, was supported by wooden posts, and was surrounded by a low stone wall;\u2014we halted for breakfast;\u2014in amongst the rocks, I noticed rhododendrons, blind nettles, rue, primrose, chrysanthemum, rose, dwarf rhododendron, fennel, geranium, polygona, dock and potentilla. This stone-house is a resting-place for the herdsmen and cattle when on their way from the valleys of Sikkim to Singaleelah.\n\nWe now commenced a rapid descent, and at 11.20 A.M. we reached Yangpoong, several hundred feet removed from the crest of the Gubroo range or upon the western slope of the mountain on a level with the fir forest or about 12,000 feet. Yangpoong consists of two large stone-houses covered with shingle, and a ruined house, this latter probably a kraal for enclosing cattle, an extensive mendong, covered with carved slabs and two tall flagstaves, bearing cloth flags covered with printed prayers. The inhabitants had gone to the north or to Jongri, so we examined their houses whose doors were merely tied up with a piece of string. We found the houses large, commodious and well filled with the usual Bhotia furniture, amongst which were some fine drums, trumpets and brass vessels. Though my Lepchas and Bhotias wandered about the houses examining and making fun of everything they could lay their hands upon, nothing was taken away, but my guide begged of me to take a large\npair of yak horns that were nailed to a post in the house. I had shown some desire to take back a good pair with me, but I could not consent in the absence of the owner to remove them, especially as they were evidently prized by the herdsmen from their superior size and shape.\n\nUnderneath the houses, which were built after the usual Bhotia fashion, there was accommodation for the yak calves.\n\nFrom Yangpoong the descent was rapid, in the morning we had stood where nothing grew except a minute golden lichen, we were now at noon in a handsome forest, having passed rapidly through the various botanical grades of lichen, small flowers, juniper, rhododendron, fir, oaks, chestnut, to our tormentors the leeches. At noon we passed a small stone-altar called \"Mon Lepcha\" erected by the Lepchas, in honour of the \"principle of evil;\" we put up in a yak herd's hut on the left bank of the Rungbi, close to where it is joined by a fine stream flowing from the mountains to the east.\n\nAugust 14th, 1852. Started at 6.15 A.M. in a southerly direction crossing the Rungbi over a handsome bridge close to our encampment. These bridges consist of a few saplings, their thicker ends being stepped under heavy stones, their lighter ends are brought together and form the crown of an arch; from this arch, loops of creepers hang down, into which one single sapling is laid, and forms the platform along which the traveller walks\u2014we were now in a deep valley flanked on the west by the lofty Singaleesh, and on the east by the Catsuperri mountains, our path lay through a heavy forest a few feet above the Rungbi, a fine broad river full of rapids and water falls.\n\nAt 11 A.M. we arrived at a small patch of cultivation showing that we had descended 9,000 feet since yesterday morning. At this spot I measured one of the large black epirce bird eating spiders, and found him to be eight inches across the legs; at 11.30 A.M. we reached Rungbi a Limboo clearance with four houses, near which was a small stone altar and some handsome trees of the fir species with very fine leaves.\n\nIn the deep valley of the Rungbi we met a party of Limboos, men, women and children all busy poisoning fish in the stream\u2014our sudden appearance in the narrow path running through a thick tropi-\ncal underwood seemed to take them by surprise. One old man carried a pot of tobacco and water in his hand, with which he continually anointed the leeches as they crept upon his naked legs; the first application caused the animals to roll off as if in agony.\n\nAt 2 p.m. after a very fatiguing march we arrived at two Limboo huts, perched up about 1,000 feet above the river, and commanding a fine view down the stream, which here turns off to the east, flowing between the Pemionchi and Catsuperri mountains. The northern flank of Pemionchi is much less steep than its southern or Kullait river-side. Looking up the Rungbi, nothing is visible but a deep dark forest-choked glen, down which the Rungbi could be heard roaring. Near Rungbi we saw a very beautiful waterfall, the fall was only twenty-four feet in height, but the arrangement of the rocks and forests and the numerous streams into which the fall was broken, quite made up for its small height.\n\nWe put up for the night at a Limboo clearance where the Soobah of the Rungbi valley resides, and where, upon our arrival, he was, in honour of the harvest, keeping up great festivities. The whole population amounting to about ten men and four or five women besides children, were all more or less intoxicated; it was a long time before we could get a hearing on account of the music and dancing, shouting and screaming that was going on inside the principal house; at last they all tumbled out, and the soobah, a good-natured creature, at the head of the party, led us away to a nice house, which was forthwith swept out and cleaned and a fire lighted for us. Two bamboos of chee, a fowl, milk and rice were sent from the banquet, upon which we regaled ourselves, our sixteen attendants formed a grand addition to the party who were with much cordiality invited to see the dancing and to partake of chee, which they did with a will; for before midnight the whole of them were fast asleep and very drunk.\n\nI sent my compliments across to the soobah to say I should like to see what was going on; he forthwith came himself, conducted us into his fine house, where there were about thirty men and women sitting on the ground, hot chee was being served round to every one and in the middle of the room a young girl highly excited and most fantastically dressed was dancing to the beat of several drums. The\ngirl was dressed in a pretty coloured petticoat with two cross belts of cloth covered with cowrie-shells thrown across her shoulders, from which depended on the back two skirts almost touching the ground and fringed with the teeth of the wild boar, deer, and bear, the dried heads and beaks of a handsome bird, of the scarlet pheasant, and other birds heads, seeds, pheasants' spurs, and bears claws, and her head was ornamented with long cocks' tail feathers. The dance, which was a slow monotonous shuffle at first, increased in spirit as the drums beat louder, the girl moving gracefully to the time faster and faster until she got into a perfect frenzy, wheeling round the room and the fire places at a fearful pace, the men's heads keeping time to her dance; shouts, and beating of drums increased the girl's pace until unable to control herself, she dashed into the midst of a large fire that was burning in the middle of the room, and with her naked feet sent the fire flying all over the room, nor were her hands idle, for she commenced tearing down a hanging frame-work upon which all the household cooking apparatus and property is generally slung; the women of the house rushed forward to save their property, the men to put out the burning brands; all was uproar and confusion during which moment we slipped out. The next morning I sent for the little dancing maniac, she came in full dress, but was as demure and quiet as any Limboo damsel possibly could be. I examined her dress, and marvelled how so slight a creature could dance, and at such a pace with the enormous weight of cowries and cloth that encumbered her body.\n\nAugust 15th, 1852.\u2014Four hours' quick walking in an easterly direction through forest, brought us to the summit of the Pemionchi mountain.\n\nAt 10 A.M. we reached the monastery of Chanachelling, or as the Lepchas call it Sanachelling. It is a remarkable and curious looking stone building three stories high, pierced with doors and windows, ornamented with paint, horse-hair curtains, hanging balconies and flights of stone stairs. The southern side faces a garden which is enclosed by a stone wall, beyond which are several handsome chaitans or stone monuments. The goompa or monastery is thatched, the edges of the thatch are secured by long ratans being tied to it at all points and pegged into the ground; this is to guard against\nthe high winds that sometimes sweep across these mountains with resistless force. Chanachelling is a monastery for women, but since the Rajah's disgraceful conduct towards Drs. Campbell and Hooker when travelling in his country\u2014which, together with the Rajah's refusal to deliver up his Dewan, the principal instigator in the outrage, and on which account the two Morung Purgunnahs lying at the foot of the hills and yielding a yearly revenue of 28,000 rupees, and that portion of the hills now known as the Darjeeling Territory, and for which the Rajah received 3,000 per annum from the British Government, were confiscated from the Rajah,\u2014the yearly allowance hitherto granted by the Durbar to the Goomps has been stopped, and we found that all the nuns had gone over the snows to Choombi in Tibet, leaving one Lama in charge of the vast house, its library, images and religious furniture. The interior of the house was as curious as its exterior. The portico at the entrance of the Goompa has the walls painted with a series of figures larger than life in the true Chinese style;\u2014bright colours, bad perspective and extravagant action. The drawings represent Chinese officers of various grades bringing in frantic haste presents, such as strings of precious stones and other rare articles to a group of images in an inner room, the figures are so painted that they appear hastening into the room where a grand idol sits, flanked on either side by smaller images. The eyes of one of the mandarins or high officers were so painted that they really looked as if they were about to spring out of their sockets. The tension of the eye-ball was remarkably well-painted. The flowing drapery, the armour, faces and jewels upon the figures were all very well and minutely painted.\n\nIn the praying room up stairs, thirty-six feet long by thirty broad, were arranged round the book-cases for the reception of the books of prayers of which I counted 86 volumes bound in silk and each labelled upon three slips of various coloured Chinese satins. The roof of the room is supported upon six handsomely carved and painted wooden pillars, carved in a truly Chinese manner; down the eastern side of the room were ranged eight curiously carved side-tables behind which in recesses were seated twelve gods, five feet in height and painted so as to resemble life. Immediately to the left of the altar which was divested of most of its ornaments, was a\ngroup of painted figures five feet in height, too indecent to make any further mention of. The altar consisting of a raised platform had upon it a few conch shells\u2014brazen cups with water in them\u2014bells\u2014small brazen images and drums, all of Tibetan manufactory and very beautiful, especially the brass work which is chased and carved in a very minute style. Four heads of Indian corn were also hung up in front of the altar. In one corner of the room stood a prayer-drum five feet in height and supported between strong upright wooden posts. Their drums called \"Mane\" are found with all sects of Buddhists in or near the Himalayah, they contain painted and written prayers and are made to revolve from north, round by east, the revolving Lama repeating the words \"Om Mane pemi hom.\" These prayer-drums vary from a few inches in length to several feet in height. The former are turned by the hand, the latter either by wheels or by water power.\n\nThe Lama left in charge of the convent could not appear, as he was undergoing either penance or was under a vow not to mingle with the world on this day; we conversed with him through a door, he speaking in the Bhotia language, our Lepchas interpreting; he sent us out nice soft rugs to sit upon, and a gallon of tea. He was most anxious that we should stay and sleep at the convent, and have a long talk with him on the morrow; he said all the brethren had experienced much pleasure from Dr. Hooker's visit, and assured us that our having come so far to see the convent, was an honour and that we were welcome. The fact is, these monks, perched upon lofty mountains and shut out from all the world, lead a life of monotony; a traveller breaking in upon this monotony and conversing about the world, its politics and people, is warmly welcomed and treated with great kindness.\n\nA hot walk of three miles along the crest of the mountain brought us to Pemionchi, where there is a very handsome Goompa of three stories; it is eighty feet in length by about forty broad. As we approached, we saw one of the Lamas, who was dressed in his long garnet-coloured cloth robes, beating a gong to call all the monks to prayers; we were fortunate in seeing the whole establishment go through a religious performance upon the occasion of the death of a brother monk.\nAbout twenty intelligent looking monks old and young, all dressed in the garnet-coloured flowing robes with under clothes of richly figured Chinese silks and satins, their hair cut short, assembled at the sound of the gong; they received us with great kindness and provided us with seats at the entrance to the Goompa, where the ceremony of chanting prayers for the dead was about to take place. The walls of the vestibule in which we sat were highly ornamented with painted figures as large as life, representing a Tibetan deity on a white horse; a female deity half-woman half-snake; and another deity upon some frightful beast.\n\nLooking through the capacious door or up the body of the temple, the sight reminded me of a Catholic Chapel during the performance of high mass. Three pillars highly ornamented, gilt and painted, stand on either side of the aisle which terminates at the high altar, or rather a deep recess filled with eight or ten strange images as large as life. To the right of the recess there was a square metal tray, containing a hundred lights which shone brightly in the darkened room, the walls of which are painted from floor to ceiling with the likenesses of gods and goddesses, with skulls and tridents, things on earth, and with things that never were on earth, so beautifully confused and confounded that to attempt to analyze or particularize what there was or what there was not, would be a matter of difficulty. The colours were all of the brightest hues and pleasing to the eye.\n\nOn both sides of the aisle were ranged felt seats raised a foot from the ground, upon these the twenty Lamas took their seats and opened the ceremony by chanting a hymn, and finer bass voices I never heard; an old Lama sat near the altar on the right hand side and immediately in front of him and standing in the centre of the aisle was a figure dressed in the defunct Lamas clothes, a crash of cymbals, and a loud blowing upon the human thigh-bone trumpets closed each hymn, of which they chanted some twenty; two boys dressed as Lamas, during the whole of the service were very actively engaged in serving out hot chee from Tibetan metal tea-pots to the singers, who each held out his own wooden tea-cup produced from the folds of their capacious robes, and when emptied and licked clean, these were put back again into their breasts; near the door and close\nto where we stood, incense was burning in a silver dish, a handsome silver flagon containing water also stood close to us, the flagon was of Chinese manufacture highly chased and ornamented, with two hideous Chinese dragons as its handles.\n\nService being over, we walked round the temple conversing with the Lamas through interpreters, our conversation lasted two hours, during which we were made to drink a quantity of chee and tea, a side of beef was also presented to us, accompanied by plantains, rice and vegetables.\n\nThe conversation was principally concerning the Rajah of Sikkim; and of his crippled condition since the British Government had deprived him of his land in the plains, the only land that yielded him any revenue; they deplored the outrage that had been committed upon Doctors Campbell and Hooker at the Cholah pass, and said that it was all the Dewan's doing, but that as the Dewan was intimately connected with the Rajah by marriage, the Rajah could not deliver him up to the British Government, when he was requested to do so. They gave me to understand that the Dewan was now a beggar, that having ruined his master, he was suffering for it. The allowance of 2,000 rupees and various presents that were annually given by the Durbar to the Pemionchi Goompa had been stopped, consequently they would all be obliged to go over the snows into Tibet, or starve. They certainly were very far from the starving point when I saw them, for a more jovial, fat, good-natured set of mortals could not be seen; they were the very pictures of jolly friars.\n\nI particularly asked them if they had any objection to English gentlemen visiting their country and Goompas, their reply was, \"None whatever: whoever will honour us with a visit, we will receive them with pleasure, give them food and a house to live in,\" and begged of us to pay them another visit. They said we were strange people and pointing to our legs that were bleeding from fifty leech-wounds, asked us, why we underwent such trouble, labour and misery when we might sit at home and be comfortable. \"Yes\" one fine intelligent Lama said, sighing: \"we were all happy and at peace amongst ourselves before any English gentleman had penetrated our hills, but since then, all has gone wrong; but strange to say from no fault of yours, but of our own.\"\nThe view from Pemionchi, 7,000 feet, commands a fine view of the snowy range and of the greater part of Sikkim. Numerous Goompas perched upon mountains are seen to the east; the Rungeet river is seen 6,000 feet below and Darjeeling to the south\u2014Tassiding Goompa appeared at our feet.\n\nA great portion of the eastern end of the Pemionchi mountain was once encircled with a stone wall, the remains of which are still seen and was the capital of Sikkim. This place was sacked by the Goorkas, and the valuable library burnt in 1787, A.D. when the Goorkas descended the Tumbok pass (Islumbo of Hooker) and ravished the whole of Sikkim.\n\nThe summit of Pemionchi mountain is composed of mica schist of great brilliancy, shining in the sun like the nacre of a pearl oyster. The schist is not horizontal, but carved and distorted, presenting in the separation of its strata, huge conchoidal pearl-like surfaces.\n\nLeft Pemionchi at 2 p.m. passing several chaitans and descended 2,000 feet on the southern face to the great Gayzing Mendong, which is 615 feet in length, about ten in height, and as many broad; it is highly ornamented with well-carved slabs, the word \"Om mane pemi hom\" predominating. At the north end there stands a chaitan; and at the south end a tall flat slab of stone nine feet in height and covered with inscriptions, has been erected in a bed of masonry. The slab has had its head snapped off and just below the fracture, the writing commences. I am sorry I did not secure an impression of the inscription, but great fatigue had prostrated my strength, and I was fit for nothing.\n\nDr. Campbell in his journal of a trip to Sikkim\u2014see Asiatic Society's Journal for May, 1849\u2014mentions that this Mendong is the largest in Sikkim\u2014the labour that has been expended upon this wall is immense, there being no less than 708 stone slabs all elaborately carved with letters five and six inches in length, some of the legends are arranged in circles ornamented with flowers and contain other words than the usual \"Om mane pemi hom;\" one stone written in the Outza (Tibetan) character had the words \"Om, a, h\u00fam, t\u00famph\u00ed\" arranged in a circle. These phrases appear to have some hidden meaning, but unknown to the generality of the Lamas; however, they say that they all apply to God, each syllable bearing its own\npeculiar virtue. An intelligent Lepcha with me who read the inscriptions freely, and also copied some for me, rendered the words \"Om mane pemi hom\" into the following prayer \"Oh God receive me into Thine essence when I am going;\" (dying); absorption into the divine essence being the Buddhist's idea of heaven, I have no doubt that the prayer, meaning whatever it may do in strict reality, is used by the Buddhists in that sense.\n\nOn our descent, we met a slave girl toiling up the steep ascent laden with a large bamboo full of water for the use of the monks. This girl had been kidnapped from Bengal in her infancy and had forgotten her native language, she was in good condition, fat and plump, but with a melancholy expression of countenance, an expression only seen upon the face of a slave. To prevent people being kidnapped from Bengal and from our own hill territory has long occupied the attention of our government; at every bridge leaving the British territory there is a guard; over these bridges a slave is never taken to Sikkim and no slave who may seek shelter from Sikkim is ever sent back again. Slavery and its attendant miseries have in an indirect manner been the cause of the Rajah's losing his country; mild reforms proposed by our government with regard to the existing slave-trade in Sikkim roused the anger of the Sikkim Durbar which led to direct violence offered to the person of our government representative.\n\nAugust 16th, 1852.\u2014Descended to the Kullait river in two hours, the path the whole way displaying mica schist; saw small red monkeys, doves, and green pigeons (koklah) in the forests.\n\nTo our annoyance we found that all the cane-bridges over the Kullait had been cut away to prevent any of the people from Hee, and the neighbouring clearances crossing to Pemionchi, the whole of the inhabitants near the southern bank of the river being more or less affected with dysentery, such is the horror and alarm with which that complaint is viewed by these people. Men were sent up and down the river for miles but without success, all the bridges had disappeared and as the river was at its height, very deep and impetuous, we were at our wits end, as I particularly wished to avoid the hot and missmatic valley of the Rungeet, which appeared to be our only alternative. Men were again sent off down the stream to\nsee if there was any possibility of crossing; a spot was at last found half a mile above the junction of the Kullait and Bangeet rivers where some gneiss rocks jutted into the river, diminishing its width considerably. Here our Lepchas, in the space of two hours, threw a strong bridge across the Kullait made of bamboos and saplings retained in position by heavy stones. It was an exciting moment when a man crawling forward upon the supple and bending bamboos overhanging the boiling headlong current below, managed to effect a junction with the opposite bank.\n\nThe rocks in the Kullait are a fine gneiss in company with masses of white quartz.\n\nA flock of black cormorants flew up the river, as we were sitting on the rocks, watching the bird-eating spiders letting themselves drop from great heights from the branches of the trees overhanging the water, and seizing insects and flies upon the rocks. The movements of the spiders were exceedingly rapid and precise, seldom missing their prey. From a living specimen I wound off upon a piece of card a good hank of a beautiful golden yellow web, resembling floss silk, which however turned into gum upon getting wet.\n\nAt noon we crossed the Kullait and after repeated halts on account of the suffocating heat arrived at a small level clearance near the summit of Rinchinpoong, where there is a Lepcha and Bhotia village of ten houses, at an elevation of about 6,000 feet. The name of the village is Yans\u00fank\u00fam, the inhabitants of which had an abundance of good cows, pigs and poultry. I was importuned to prescribe for a man suffering from dysentery; having no medicine-chest with me was no excuse, for I was implored to make some sort of medicine to effect a cure; I accordingly had a quantity of wormwood gathered and pounded and stirred up in brandy, to which was added nutmegs, cinnamon, and cloves, all reduced to powder; doses from a bottle full of this strange mixture well diluted with water were recommended to be taken three times a day.\n\nHere, from sheer fatigue and from severe inflammation of my legs and ankles caused by leech-bites, we were obliged to halt a whole day. Let no one who has never ventured into the Himalayah mountains imagine that travelling in these mountains is anything but downright and real hard work; it is seldom a traveller is so fortunate\nas to have dry clothes on; his food is of the plainest quality and often very scanty. Dr. Hooker was reduced to coarse boiled rice and Chili vinegar; this is poor fare for a man walking up hill and down dale for ten hours a day.\n\nAugust 18th, 1852.\u2014Left Yansunkum at 6.30 A.M. and ascended to the summit of Rinchinpoong, a few hundred feet above the village\u2014saw several chaitans on the road; all the hills near Darjeeling appear to have been, in some former age, much more densely inhabited than they are now, mendongs and chaitans appearing upon almost every ridge and peak of any note.\n\nThe rocks still mica schist. Passed the village Nam-gon-kum and commenced the descent of Binchingpoong at 9.15 A.M.; crossed at 10.40, the torrents; Richi flowing from west to east and falling into the great Bungseet, which river we could see turbid and swollen some thousands of feet below us; commenced the ascent of Singrioong at 11 A.M. and reached the summit at 0.45 P.M.; a little to the west of the point of crossing this ridge, stands a conical peak, named Biksadong.\n\nAt 2 P.M. commenced the descent of Singrioong and by mistake taking the wrong path, we had to return 2,000 feet up a steep ascent. The heat was so overpowering, the jungle so dense, the air so quiet that a feeling of faintness crept over me, which deprived me of all strength; upon reaching the Buttoo stream at the foot of Singrioong where it dashes over a high rock, I could not resist a plunge into the river. It was late in the day, any more ascent, worn out as we were, was impossible, and to sleep in this deep miasmatic valley was almost certain death from jungle-fever. Fatigue and the sight of the cool-stream overruled all scruples, we slept here. A fortnight subsequently, I was in bed delirious from jungle-fever, but I feel grateful that no one but myself suffered from my imprudence in sleeping in this deep valley.\n\nOn the way down Singrioong passed over one of the travertine lime deposits, common upon this spur, and upon Chakoong to the south.\n\nIn the Buttoo are quantities of rolled and water-worn pieces of blue, pink, and other delicately tinted slates. The rock in situ is gneiss.\nAugust 19th, 1852.\u2014Left the banks of the Buttoo at 7 A.M. and ascended Chakoong by a very steep path, reached the summit at 8 A.M., a rapid descent and ascent over several small spurs, brought us at 11 A.M. to the Rummam river, which we crossed by a very good cane-bridge.\n\nUpon the southern flank of Chakoong I saw several large blocks of sandstone, black clay slate and gneiss. The jungle was too dense to allow of any examination of the ground. In the Rummam, gneiss veined with white quartz is the only rock to be seen.\n\nAt 1 P.M. we reached the guard-house at Goke by an excellent government road which commences at the Rummam river; four sets of zig-zags and many easy gradients, render the road accessible to horses. The change from steep and narrow footpaths, to a broad road was most delightful. There is much cultivation upon the spur and many substantial Limboo houses. The most remarkable feature upon the Goke spur is the large bamboo forest through which the road has been cut; bamboos ten inches in diameter and a hundred feet in length may be had in any quantities. These bamboos, called by the natives \"Choongas,\" are used at Darjeeling, instead of the common leather-bag (mussak), for holding water for domestic purposes; they are also used as milk-pails, also for holding chee, ghee and other liquids. Amongst these bamboos, I saw the large black squirrel, measuring about three feet six inches from the nose to the tip of the tail. From Goke half an hour's descent brought us to the little Bungeet where our friends had sent us ponies and some bread; a man having been sent on two days ahead to announce our approach; at 4.30 P.M. we reached Darjeeling by the Tuqvor spur, having been away eighteen days, during which we had travelled 360 miles on foot or at the rate of twenty miles per diem ascending 36,000 feet and descending 31,000 feet, to reach an elevation of 14,500 feet distant in a direct line thirty-seven miles from the point of departure. These figures may in a slight measure convey some idea of the labour that has to be undergone by a traveller in the Himalayahs. The longest march made during the trip in a direct line was ten miles; the average distance was only five miles, each march occupying eight hours steady walking.\n\nHere I part with my Lepcha guide and Lepcha companions, testi-\nfying at the same time to the good nature and good temper of these interesting people, whom no hardship or discomfort appears to ruffle. After travelling for nearly twenty years amongst the \"noli me tangere\" Hindus, who, fenced about with a cruel caste, refuse all approach to familiarity, sociality, or even kindness with any one, even with one of their own caste, the change to Lepcha followers for Hindus is most pleasing: on one hand there is the brooding, moody Hindu, exchanging no thought with any one; eating his food in silence and alone; his fear lest any one below him in caste should touch him; his dread lest any of the hundred omens observed between his rising up in the morning and his lying down at night should not have been properly divined and acted up to; the cruel bondage to which his every action in life is subservient, makes the unfortunate Hindu anything but a pleasant companion: on the other hand we have the free, happy, laughing and playful, no-caste Lepcha, a child of the mountains, modest, social and joyous in disposition.\n\nI have watched the Lepchas after a good day's work playing amongst themselves, either racing on foot, playing at hop-step and a jump, quoits, wrestling and jumping; or walking up to a companion and throwing his arm round his neck, a Lepcha will pretend to be asking some question, in the middle of the pretended conversation, his friend receives a violent kick from behind, he turns round to see who is the culprit, no one is there and his friend has disappeared screaming with laughter at the trick he has played a hundred times before; a chase takes place, they run, they double, the culprit is caught, they wrestle and end by rolling upon the sward locked in each other's arms, they rise in good humour and go off to play the same trick upon someone else. I frequently brought these pastimes to a temporary close by offering the Lepchas a plate full of rice, ham, sausages, or perhaps half a raw flitch of bacon; panting from these healthy exercises, they would take the viands, their very teeth grinning thanks, sit down on the grass and divide the mess amongst each other.\nNotices and Descriptions of various Reptiles, new or little known.\u2014\nBy E. Blyth.\n\nTestudo Phayrei, nobis. Great Burmese land Tortoise. Carapax smooth, as in T. radiata and T. angulata, but much flatter; oblong, subquadrate, its free marginal plates reverted and moderately serrate. Nuchal plate broader than long. Caudal plate double. Gular plates longer than broad, moderately notched: anal broader than long, and deeply notched. Beak unemarginate. Fore-limbs covered with very long and thick imbricated scales, much as in a Pangolin; the claws elongate, strong and thick: similar great elongate scales at the heel; and a group of five principal obtuse spines on either side of the tail, the medial of them remarkably strong and thick. Two or more smaller spines or thick elongate scales above the tail. Colour wholly black, or mingled more or less with buff-yellow. In the young, the scales are probably of the latter hue, with gradually increasing black centres. Limbs deep brown; some of the claws yellow in some specimens: the head and neck paler brown, strongly tinged with yellow. Our largest specimen is 20 in. long in a straight line, or 22\u00bd in. measured over the curve of the carapax, from front of nuchal plate to middle of caudal notch: greatest breadth 14\u00bd in. or 20\u00bd in. following the curve, from one obtuse lateral angle to the other. Height 1\u00bd in. Head to occiput 4\u00bd in. The shell of this individual is wholly black, with merely a few slight indications of the ochreous-yellow colouring: all the claws deep brown. Another, rather smaller, has the appearance of great age, with most of the plates of its carapax more or less completely united, so that the form of some cannot be traced. Colour irregularly mingled black and dull buff-yellow; the plastron chiefly black; and several of the claws are yellow wholly or in part. Hab. Arakan; Tenasserim Provinces. Specimens presented by Capt. Phayre.\n\nT. elongata, nobis. Small Burmese land Tortoise. Carapax elongate, becoming more so and quite smooth in adults, wherein it approaches to a semi-cylindrical form; flattish, sub-even, the three medial vertebral plates lying almost in a plane, and the free marginals\nslightly reverted. Caudal broader than the last vertebral. Nuchal twice or thrice as long as broad, and even with the borders of the anterior marginals. Gulars not notched, or but very slightly so. Caudals divergent from base, and transversely elongate-triangular, broader than long, forming a slight lateral notch with the ventrals. Beak laterally notched or distinctly three-pointed. Scales of the limbs rather small, contrasting much with those of the preceding species. Colour of half grown specimen orange-yellow, each plate having a large black centre, which mostly disappears with age, leaving a few more or less radiating black spots on those of the carapax, and often a black spot on only the large medial plates of the plastron. Head and limbs brown, much tinged with yellow. Length of an adult 13 in. in a straight line, by 8 in. across, or rather more towards the hinder part of the body. Height 5\u00bd in. Head to occiput 2\u00bd in. Hab. Arakan. Specimens presented by Capt. Phayre. According to Dr. Helfer, Tortoises abound in the Tenasserim Provinces, and are much eaten by the Peguers and Karens, who train dogs to search for them.\n\nIn India proper and also in Ceylon, only one species of land Tortoise occurs, the T. stellata, Schweigger, a figure and interesting notice of which are given by Capt. Hutton in J. A. S. VI, 689, under the supposition of its being T. geometrica. The latter is a S. African species, very similar to T. stellata, but having a distinct nuchal plate, which T. stellata does not possess, and exhibiting certain other distinctions. Among some Tortoises, however, presented to the Society by Capt. Sherwill from S. Africa, are two small specimens of geometrica, and one full grown example which can in no way be distinguished from the Indian stellata. The latter does not inhabit Lower Bengal, and is rarely brought alive to Calcutta. One much more commonly brought here is the T. radiata, Shaw, a larger species remarkable for its very hemispherical form, and which is said to be indigenous to Madagascar, in which case it is probably brought to India from the Mauritius. The very large specimen referred by me to stellata (v. actinodes) in a note to p. 462 ante, I now think, after much consideration, to be distinct, and shall indicate as\n\nT. megalopus, nobis, n. s. Similar to T. stellata, but attaining\na much greater size, with proportionally much larger feet and claws. The colours duller and therefore less strongly contrasting, and the lines radiating from each boss of the carapax more numerous. Fore-feet with two large claw-like scales of equal size behind the palm, and no others approaching them in size. Claws of hind-feet fully twice as large as in adult stellata. Length of carapax, measured in a straight line, 12 in., by 7\u00bd in. in diameter-breadth.\n\nHab.\u2014?\n\nThere are several living specimens about Calcutta, of the great Seychelle Tortoise, miscalled T. indica by Gmelin, and under which Mr. Gray unites no fewer than seven of the supposed species admitted by M. M. Dumeril and Bibron. According to Dr. Schlegel, \"The Indian Tortoise [so-called], probably indigenous to Madagascar and the neighbouring isles, has been acclimated in the Gallapagos Isles, in California, and on several other points on the western coast of South America;\" but we have been assured, on good authority, that numerous specimens kept in gardens in the Mauritius, have all been brought from the Scychelle Islands in the first instance, that they are still commonly brought from those islands to the Mauritius, and thence we believe the few in India have been imported. It is most assuredly not an Indian reptile, nor have we heard of its ever propagating in this country.*\n\n* In the Mauritius I am informed that it is eaten. The largest I have seen is in my own possession, alive, and measures 4 ft. 4 in. in length over the curve of the carapax, or 3 ft. 5 in. in a straight line; transversely 4 ft. 2 in. over the high arch of the carapax, or in a diameter line 2 ft. 2 in.: height, when not raised upon the legs, i.e. height of shell, 20\u00bd in.; when walking, the shell is lifted fully 6 in. from the ground, if not more: circumference of hind-foot 17\u00bd in. A scientific friend, recently from Jamaica, assures me, that this great Seychelle species is quite distinct from the great Gallapagos Tortoise, which has bred and multiplied in Jamaica and other W. India islands. Curious, that these gigantic land Tortoises (diminutive, however, in comparison with the extinct Indian Colossuscharalis,) should thus be indigenous to small oceanic groups of islands, in each case remarkable for the peculiarities of both their fauna and flora. We are reminded of the great wingless birds (Dodos and Solitaires) of the Mauritius, Bourbon, and Rodrigues; those also of N. Zealand and of Madagascar; the Megapodius of the Nicobars, and its congeners of other islands; the singular and quite recently extinct great Parrot of Philip Islet near Norfolk island, with its sole congener in N. Zealand; the Owl-like\nFrom Afghanistan Mr. Gray describes a T. horsfieldi, which he suggests may be T. iberia, Pallas, Faun. Casp., t. 5. The Society's Museum possesses a land Tortoise from that country, which however belongs to the genus Homopus, having but four claws to each foot. It may be thus described.\n\nHomopus Burnesii, nobis. Carapax squarish, depressed, broadest posteriorly, where the free marginals are a little reverted and distinctly serrate. Anterior border straight, the nuchal plate well developed. Caudal as broad as the last vertebral, and broader than the other vertebral plates. Nucleus of each lateral or discoidal plate near its inner or upper border. Gular plates longer than broad, the two forming a nearly equilateral triangle. Anal oblong, divergent, forming a rather deeply notched border. Scales of fore-limbs rather large, and those to the front mostly uniform in size. Claws elongate, or not worn down by attrition. Beak three-pointed. Colour yellow above, with black nuclei to the plates; those of the plastron black with yellow border. The head and limbs appear to have been yellowish. Length of carapax 6 in., by 5\u00bd in., measuring straight. Height 2\u00bd in. Head to occiput 1\u00be in. This large specimen was procured in Afghanistan by Sir A. Burnes. A very small Homopus in spirit, also from Afghanistan, is doubtless the young, though exhibiting some remarkable differences in the shape of the upper plates. In this the nuchal is roundish, or as broad as long;\n\nnocturnal Cock too of N. Zealand, also close upon extirpation, &c. The majority, if not all, of these islands appearing to be remnants of what may be comparatively termed continents, each with its peculiar centre or centres of creation.\n\nIn all these supposed reliques of ancient lands, with the chief exception of Madagascar, mammalia are rare, and are chiefly or wholly Cheiroptera, Rodentia, and Marsupialia; the two former orders comprising the only placental mammalia of Australia; and one species of each of these placental orders being the only known indigenous mammals of N. Zealand, though a large Badger-like animal has lately been reported in the latter country, in all probability a marsupial. Madagascar is very remarkable for the extraordinary development of the quadrumanous group of Lemurs, among the higher placental mammalia; and has even a rodent Lemur in Cheiromya, as Australia has a rodent marsupial in Phascalomya. Its other placental mammals are mostly of peculiar genera, unknown even on the neighbouring continent of Africa; and no marsupial has been discovered there.\nand all the vertebrais are about equally broad. Colour dull yellow throughout. Presented to the museum by Dr. Allan Webb.\n\nOf the numerous true Terrapins (Emys) of the Gangetic rivers, only three species are common in the vicinity of Calcutta; and adults of all are rarely met with. These are\u2014E. thurgii, Gray, which attains to a much larger size than has hitherto been described, adults measuring 20 to 22 in. (straight) in length of carapax; E. tectum, Gray, the adults of which measure similarly 6 in.; and E. Hamiltonii, Gray, the adults of which measure similarly 5\u00bd in. The only other species we have yet met with from this vicinity is E. tentoria, Gray, one young specimen only. This Mr. Gray describes from the Bombay Dukhun, where procured by Col. Sykes; and Sir Alexander Burnes obtained an adult from the Indus, which is now in the Society's museum. These two specimens differ in some respects from each other, also from Mr. Gray's description, and from Buchanan Hamilton's coloured figure, the two latter again presenting certain discrepancies one from the other. The species is nearly affined to E. tectum, Bell, but at all ages has the median keels to the first three vertebral plates much less developed, and the form of the whole carapax is conspicuously flatter and broader. A peculiarity of both species consists in the peculiar decanter-shaped form of the fourth vertebral plate. Comparing the adult of E. tentoria from the Indus (length of carapax, measured straight, 6\u00bd in.) with an adult of E. tectum from the Hughly (carapax, similarly measured, 6 in.), the first vertebral plate is proportionally much broader in the former, pentagonal, narrower to the front, with a broad straight transverse base posteriorly, and the keel little developed; whereas the first vertebral plate of E. tectum is pentagonal, broader to the front, with a rounded posterior base, and much more developed keel. In the former, the first vertebral is considerably larger and somewhat broader than the second, whereas in the latter it is sub-equal or even rather smaller than the second: in adult E. tentoria the second vertebral plate is hexagonal but almost square, and rather broader than long, with the keel nearly obsolete; in E. tectum somewhat pear-shaped, truncate to the front and narrowing and curving off posteriorly, with the keel strongly marked: the third vertebral plate of adult tentoria is quadrangular, longer by\nhalf than broad, with the keel quite obsolete on the anterior half; and flat and but little raised posteriorly; in E. TECTUM it is hexagonal, with the keel strongly developed and prolonged backward. A narrow black line is continued along the spinal ridge of E. TENTORIA; whereas the middle of the ridge is broadly white in E. TECTUM, bordered by a black line on either side. The plastron of E. TENTORIA is blackish-brown, with a pale border to each plate; in E. TECTUM pale with two or three distinct blackish patches on each plate. Comparing the young of the two species, the first vertebral plate forms a much broader pentagon in E. TENTORIA, being equal in breadth to the second; in young E. TECTUM the first vertebral plate is considerably narrower than the second; the second vertebral plate in young TENTORIA forms a heptagon with the base posteriorly; in young TECTUM a pentagon with rounded apex and anterior base; the third in young TENTORIA is subquadrilateral, somewhat longer than broad, with the keel a little produced posteriorly; in young TECTUM a pentagon with its base to the front, and the keel much broader and more prominent. Yet, notwithstanding these great differences of detail, and also of the colouring of the head, neck and limbs, the two species are very liable to be confounded on a superficial glance.\n\nAccording to M. M. Dumeril and Bibron, the E. TELJUGA, Schweigger, was obtained by M. Duvaucel from the \"salt-water lake\" lying east of Calcutta; but of the numbers of Terrapins which we have seen from that locality, we have sought in vain for this species, which belongs to the peninsula of India, and is the only one which has been there observed, with the exception of Col. Sykes's specimen of E. TENTORIA.* In Ceylon it is replaced by the very distinct E. SEBE, Gray.\n\nOn the Arakan coast, adults of E. DHONGOKA, Gray, approaching to 2 ft. in length of carapax, would appear to be very common; but the only young specimen which we have seen of this species was sent down alive from Assam by Major Jenkins, and is now\n\n* Since the above was printed, we have obtained another EMYS from the vicinity of Chaibasa, which appears to be the young of E. DHONGOKA; and Mr. Jerdon assures me that a large species abounds in the Nerbudda, 2 feet and upwards, which is probably the same: it is not referred to in Mr. Jerdon's paper, p. 463 ante.\nmounted in our museum. The adults have much the appearance of TETRAONYX LESSONII, D. and B., but are readily distinguished by having five instead of four claws to the fore-feet. T. LESSONII abounds at the mouth of the Hugly, and great numbers are brought to Calcutta, where they are eaten by particular castes of Hindus, and are even kept for sale in tanks. Though the water-Tortoises generally are much used as food, the species chiefly consumed, or at least which are brought in greatest quantity for that purpose, are TETRAONYX LESSONII and EMYDA PUNCTATA. The latter appears to be the most generally diffused species of Tortoise throughout the whole of India and Ceylon, and is very abundant in Lower Bengal, burrowing deep into the beds of tanks when the water dries up. A large one which escaped into the Society's compound was found several months afterwards in a healthy state, buried among the roots of some guinea-grass.\n\nA small and evidently young EMYS from Arakan or Tenasserim would seem to be\n\nE. OCELLATA, Dumeril and Bibron. The colouring agrees with the description: the details of structure less completely. Length of carapax 6 in. (measured straight). It is affined to E. THURGII; and, as compared with a specimen of E. THURGII of the same size, it is at once distinguished by having the whole under surface of the shell spotless yellowish-white, and each lateral or discoidal plate of the carapax is marked in the centre with a large round reddish-brown spot, surrounded by a pale areola; an interrupted black line along the spinal ridge, which is raised into keels on the first four vertebral plates. These are of equal breadth, whereas in E. THURGII the first is much narrower than the others. Nuchal plate twice as long as broad, and throughout equal; whereas in E. THURGII it is triangular with posterior base. Hindmost vertebral plate much narrower than in E. THURGII; and the posterior marginals and especially the caudals are much smaller than in that species. Colour of the upper parts greenish olive-brown, with the ocelli before mentioned, which probably become obscured with age. Head brown above, with yellow superciliary line meeting its opposite over the nostrils, and another proceeding backward from the eye. Limbs and under parts apparently yellowish without markings.\nThere is a species of Chameleon in the Society's old collection, the origin of which is unknown, but it would appear to be undescribed. It would seem to be most nearly affined to *C. cucullatus*, Gray, and has the occipital flaps of both that species and *Ch. delphus*, Leach.\n\n*Ch. verrucosus*, nobis. Body minutely tuberculated, with larger tubercles regularly interspersed throughout. The latter are smaller and contrast less strongly on the limbs and tail, and are more thickly set upon the limbs. Ridges of the back and throat serrated, the tubercles becoming smaller towards and upon the tail. Beneath, the tail is smooth, though tending to exhibit a slight serrature towards its base. Superciliary ridges not uniting together, either before or behind; and a small medial occipital ridge continued to the base of the two lateral flaps or lappets of skin. Colour of the specimen blanched; but there is a strongly marked black streak proceeding backward from the axilla, and surmounted by a white streak, the two occupying the space which may be concealed behind the humerus. Length 11\u00bd in., of which the tail is 6 in. Hab. unknown.\n\n*Leiurus Berdmorei*, nobis (*Geokoidae*). Agrees with Mr. Gray's definition of *Leiurus*, except that there is no appearance of the toes being webbed at base. Colour grey, with 4 longitudinal blackish streaks along the back and sides, 3 or 4 interrupted cross-bands of the same on the upper surface of the tail, a medial black streak on the nape, and others successively diverging on each side of it, and a black streak from before the eye continued to the shoulder. Some mottling also on the limbs. Hab. Mergui, where procured by Capt. Berdmore.\n\nThe genus *Stellio* is new to the Indian fauna. A species from Upper Hindustan cannot be safely separated from the Arabian *Sr. cyanogaster*, Ruppell, unless upon comparison of specimens. The tail, however, appears to be longer; and there is a slight gular fanon. Specimens vary much in colour. An adult from Mirzapore, presented by the late Major Wroughton, measures 12\u00bd in. long, of which the tail is 8 in. Throat blue, spotted over with yellowish-white, deepening to purple on the fanon which is less spotted. The rest of the lower parts are yellowish-white, marbled on the trans-\nverse fold of the neck and immediately behind it with blackish, and spotted with the same on the breast and belly, the spots becoming less numerous on the latter. Upper parts dark olive-green, the back and sides speckled over with whitish. Two smaller specimens were presented to the Society by L. C. Stewart, Esq. now of H. M. 61st Regt., from Wuzeerabad. Length of one $8\\frac{1}{2}$ in., of which the tail measures $5\\frac{1}{2}$ in. In these the under parts are yellowish-white, suffused or marbled with bluish or pale dusky on the throat, and slightly spotted with the same on the breast. Upper parts paler olive-green than in the large specimen; the back and sides speckled with yellowish-white in one, as in the adult example, with traces of dusky marbling on the back; in the other, the back is much more marbled and blotched with dusky, and has only a few largish dull white spots on the back and sides, while the limbs and tail are banded, and there are three dark transverse lines over each eye.\n\nIf new, St. indicus, nobis.\n\nGenus Calotes, Kaup. We have now nine well marked species of this genus in the museum. The first three are distinguished by a pit or fold before the shoulder, which is lined with minute scales.\n\n1. C. Emma, Gray (vide \"Proceedings of the Asiatic Society\" for May, 1858, p. 418.) Inhabits Mergui, and probably other parts of Burma, ranging northward perhaps to the Kh\u00e1sya hills; but extremely doubtful as an inhabitant of Afghanistan. We have elsewhere expressed our suspicion (loc. cit.) that collections made by the late Dr. Griffith in Afghanistan and in the Kh\u00e1sya hills had become mixed and confounded, and hence that Mr. Gray had been led to assign his Calotes Emma, C. Maria, C. minor, and Salba Horsfieldi to Afghanistan, and two of the four to the Kh\u00e1syas also; countries so extremely different, that it is most improbable that the same species would be found to inhabit both of them.\n\n2. C. mystaceus, Dumeril and Bibron. (Described J. A. S. XXI, 754). Inhabits Burma, and also the mountainous parts of Ceylon. Hind-toe reaching to the ear.\n\n3. C. Rouxi (?), Dumeril and Bibron. Three adult specimens and another half-grown forwarded by Dr. Kelaart from Newera Elia, in Ceylon, accord fully with the description as regards structure;\nbut the colouring is remarkable, and different again from that of Mr. Jerdon's supposed C. Rouxi of S. India. Pit before the shoulder more developed than in C. mystaceus, and partially black. Hind-toe reaching to the eye. A row of 3 or 4 raised spines above the tympanum; and nuchal crest moderate and gradually diminishing to the tail. The latter is tumid at base, and soon attenuates rather suddenly, the tumid portion exhibiting a median ridge of very broad keeled scales. Caudal scales towards the base of tail much larger than those of the body. Throat scales very broad and flat, with a median row of narrow compressed scales imparting the appearance of a small fanon or dewlap. A half-grown specimen (in spirit) is blue, with the tail reddish-brown to near its base, and marked with an irregular double series of ocelli which are white, having a black border. A few similar ocelli are seen bordering the low spinal crest. There is a black mark between the eye and the ear, and another below the eye; and a tinge of ruddy on the throat, about the tympanum, and on the occipital and tympanic spines. Adults (in spirit) have the body and limbs blue, the tumid base of tail green, and the rest of the tail dull red-brown, with ocelli less bright than in the young. Borders of lips black, continued as a broad black band (more or less variegated with ruddy-white) to the shoulder-pit. Throat whitish tinged with ruddy and strongly contrasting, as also a white band from the tympanum continued over and passing the shoulder-pit. In some, the shoulder-pit is also posteriorly margined with a white mark; and raising the fore-leg, two or three additional white stripes are seen, oblique and successively more inclining to the horizontal. The limbs are also banded with white; but these markings are often indistinct or obsolete. Tumid base of tail bright orange underneath in some specimens. C. Rouxi is described from Burma; but as we possess the preceding species both from Burma and the mountains of Ceylon, it is the less improbable that the present may have the same habitat.\n\n4. C. eigas, nobis. (Supposed C. ophiomachus, J. A. & XI, 870). Resembles C. versicolor, except in being much larger, having no trace of gular fanon, and a double nuchal crest of spine-like scales, \u00bd in. long in the specimen under examination. Dorsal crest also proportionally more developed than in C. versicolor,\nand terminating abruptly over base of tail. Length of head and body 5\u00bd in. Of tail\u2014? Of hind-limb 3\u00bd in. Colour apparently uniform without markings, but the specimen is much blanched; Hab.\u2014?\n\n5. C. versicolor, Daudin. The most common and generally diffused species, inhabiting all India and Ceylon, from the base of the Himalaya southward, and (according to Mr. Gray) also China and Afghanistan (vide, however, remarks on C. Emma). It is the only species we have in Lower Bengal, where it is excessively abundant, particularly in gardens. Sir A. Burnes sent a specimen from Sindh; and we have also one from Rangoon. In the last, however, the scales are somewhat smaller than in Indian specimens, and the two detached spines on the tympanic ridge are remarkably minute; but there is no other difference. Ceylon specimens, on the other hand, appear commonly to attain a greater size, with somewhat larger scales, the nuchal and dorsal crests and also the gular fanon being rather more developed (and they are then the supposed C. Rouxi apud nos of J. A. S. XXI, 354); but smaller and younger specimens from Ceylon are quite undistinguishable from Bengal examples; and it may even be that the latter sometimes attain the size and general development of the Ceylon reptile.* In S. India, again, the changes of colouring (as described by Mr. Jerdon) differ from those of C. versicolor of Bengal, and are perhaps the same as in the Ceylon animal. Here the colours are changeable, but no yellow is ever seen; and in the months of May and June, the males chiefly are often observed with the head and anterior third of the body, inclusive also of the fore-limbs, tolerably bright red, a large black patch before the shoulder, and all the rest plain greenish-brown. They are often altogether of the latter hue without markings; or the markings come out more or less strongly. The reptile is then commonly brown, lighter or darker, with a series of transverse dusky bands, broken on either side by a longitudinal whitish band which is evanescent, appearing and disappearing and sometimes shewing very conspicuously. A dusky streak through the eye, and\n\n* Some living examples sent to me from Gallo by Dr. Kelaart are quite undistinguishable from living Bengal specimens.\nthree others radiating below and two above it. Three or four oblique streaks on each side of the throat; and others on the limbs. Females are smaller and darker, generally of the hue of the ground on which they lie.\n\n6. C. viridis, Gray. Nuchal crest extremely slight; and no decided spines above the tympanum, but three raised angular scales placed not on a ridge, but disposed triangularly and separated apart. In some specimens, probably the females, the latter are scarcely noticeable. There is also a row of five flattened scales from below the eye to above the tympanum. Two longest hind-toes of subequal length and reaching only to the ear. Body scales acutely pointed, especially those of the lower parts. Colours green or brown, mottled with whitish and with dark brown; lips black. From S. India.\n\n7. C. ophiomachus, (Merrem). Tympanic ridge with several short and two longer spines. Longest hind-toe reaching to front of eye. Tail extremely long, its terminal three-fourths commonly whitish. General colour green, paler below; with some irregular white transverse bands on the body in adults. Stripe through the eye red; and nuchal crest and throat the same in the breeding livery of the males. One Ceylon example (in spirit) is remarkable for having a longitudinal white lateral band, continued from the shoulder to the tail upon which it becomes broken and lost. Identical from S. India, Ceylon, and the Nicobar Islands.\n\n8. C. platyceps, nobis, J. A. S. XXI, 854. Hab. Kh\u00e1sia hills.\n\n9. C. tricarinatus, nobis. Founded on a young specimen of a well marked species, affined by the flat form of the head to the last, but particularly distinguished by having three low crests or keels along the nape and shoulders. An oblique row of six large triangular scales over each tympanum, but no spines (perhaps on account of youth). Longest hind-toe reaching to tip of muzzle. Colour (in spirit) blue above, white beneath. From near Darjiling, where procured by Capt. Sherwill.\n\nAspris, nobis, n. g. (Scincidae). Affined to Tropidophorus, Dumeril and Bibron, but differs much in the arrangement of the shields upon the head, and the face anterior to the eyes is compressed and narrow, with subacute muzzle. Tongue very slightly notched. Teeth extremely minute. Frontal shield elongate-pentan-\ngular, attenuating much posteriorly: fronti-parietals triangular and contiguous; parietals large, subovate; interparietal smaller, elongate and obtusely pentangular; superciliaries five in number, broad, the two series separated apart by the narrow hinder part of the elongated frontal shield. Scales of the back and upper part of tail rhombic, strongly carinate, the keels running in parallel ridges; of the belly roundish, smooth. Pre-anal scales 2, large, triangular. Toes 5\u20145, simple, slender.\n\nA. BERDMOREI, nobis, n. s. Colour dusky-brown or blackish, the throat and belly ruddy-white, with some cross-bands of the same upon the neck and body, broader and more distinct on the former, and white specks on the lips, chin, and on the under and lateral surface of the tail. Eight distinct rows of keeled scales along the back. Length of specimen 4\u00bd in., of which the tail is 2\u00bd in., and head \u00bd in.; fore-limbs \u00bc in.; hind-limbs \u00bd in. Hab. Mergui, where procured by Capt. Berdmore.\n\nMOCOA FORMOSA, nobis, n. s. Length of one 7 in., of which the tail measures half. Scales hexagonal, in six dorsal series. Pre-anal scales similar to the abdominal. Form robust. Frontal shield elongate-pentagonal, broadest to the front, and rounded posteriorly. Inter-nasal and fronti-nasals lozenge-shaped, or somewhat fan-shaped, broader than long. Fronti-parietals distinct, but unsymmetrically divided. Colour olive-green, with black lateral and pale superlateral bands as usual, the former much speckled with greenish-white, and the latter shewing a series of black spots. Between the pale superlateral streaks are five narrow black lines along the nape and body, variegated with angular greenish-white spots. A few such spots appear also on the upper surface of the tail, caused by a scale variegated with black and greenish-white here and there placed. Limbs minutely pencilled with black, and spots or streaks of the same upon the head. Under-parts greenish-plumbeous throughout. This large specimen was procured at Mirzapore by the late Major Wroughton; and others, from Wuzeerabad, presented by L. C. Stewart, Esq. now of H. M. 61st Regt., are smaller and less marked with black, which does not form continuous lines along the back, but variegated scales (black, with pale\nmedial portion,) are throughout scattered, and there are some black markings on the head.\n\n**M. sikimmensis**, nobis, n. s. A small species, about 4 in. long, the tail varying in length in different individuals. In one the head and body measure 1\u00bd in., the tail 2\u00bd in.; in another the head and body measure 1\u00bc in., the tail but 2 in. This difference is probably sexual, the former proportions denoting the male, and the latter the female.* Closely affined to the preceding species, but much smaller, flatter, and more lustrous, with proportionally much more slender toes. Colour of the upper parts nacreous olive-green, with three irregular black lines or rows of specks along the back, not always very conspicuous. A broad black lateral band, becoming obsolete along the sides of the tail, is margined with a glistening pale greenish stripe above, and variegated with spots of the same along its lower half and on the outside of the limbs. Under-parts greenish-white, except the tail and below the limbs where the colour is rufous-white. Some have a few dark spots on the throat. **Hab.** Sikim, where procured by Capt. W. S. Sherwill.\n\n**PLESTIODON QUADRILINEATUM**, nobis, n. s. Proportions of Tiliqua; the head small, but its plates almost exactly as in Pl. laticeps of N. America. Colour blackish above, pearly white below; two dorsal greenish-white streaks, commencing at the nostrils and gradually disappearing at about the middle of the tail; these streaks being exterior of the two alternating series of medial and hexagonal dorsal scales: also a lateral pale streak from fore to hind limb, which is more or less indicated on the neck and base of tail, close upon the whitish hue of the under-parts. Length 7\u00bd in., of which the tail measures 4\u00bd in.; of hind-limb 1\u00bd in. China (Hong Kong?). J. C. Bowring, Esq.\n\n**EUPREPES MACULARIUS**, nobis, n. s. Affined to Eu. cyanogaster, (Lesson, v. Eu. sechellensis, D. & B.) Like Tiliqua rufescens, (Shaw), but the scales of the upper-parts 5-7 carinate, and colour bronzed olive-green above, pale below; the hinder half of back and base of tail above marked with irregular reddish-brown spots, and a broad reddish-brown lateral streak continued from the ear to the middle of the tail, marked throughout with white, which tends to\n\n* The same variation occurs in the species of Riofa, Gray.\nform continuous lines posteriorly.

S.\n\nThe temples of Mah\u00e1b\u00e1lipoor or Mavellipuram are situated in\nLat. 12\u00b0 36' 57\" North, and Long. 80\u00b0 14' 1\" East; nearly thirty-five\nmiles south of Madras, and about five north of the little town of\nSadras.\n\nThey are built and excavated from a low rocky ridge, that rising\nisolated from the plain, runs slanting towards the shore for about a\nmile and a half. The highest part, towards the north, is little more\nthan 120 feet in elevation; and perhaps a mile from the sea, into\nwhich the southern extremity runs. It appears to have some small\nspurs, which may be seen cropping out at various points on the\nbeach.\n\nIt is chiefly* of a binary granite, that conveys to a casual ob-\nserver, the idea of having been recently half-wetted by a driving\npelt of rain; and although extremely hard, splits readily into masses\nof various, but considerable size. I saw a block from forty to fifty\nfeet in length, and twenty-five to thirty feet in width, that had been\ndivided with an apparently\u2020 plane surface by a single blast of gun-\npowder. The hewers of the caves, however, do not seem to have\nenjoyed the assistance of this powerful agent: their method was to\ntrace out on the surface of the rock, the line in which they required\na separation, along which small holes were made with the chisel,\nand wedges introduced with sufficient force to compel cleavage. It\nwould however be difficult at the present day, to determine whether\nthese wedges were of wood, well dried before insertion, and subse-\nquently swelled by the application of water; or of metal driven in\nby repeated blows, as appears to have been the custom in ancient\nEgypt.\n\nThe rock yields to the weather by conchoidal peelings, which gives\nto the group the general appearance of a mass of gigantic boulders,\nor a confused assemblage of ruined domes. Considering its hard-\n\n* As far as I could perceive, it was entirely so: but I had not leisure for an ex-\namination sufficiently minute, to authorize my speaking positively.\n\u2020 I say \"apparently,\" because with reference to the known conchoidal frac-\nture of the rock, it is probable that when closely examined, the surface would be\nfound somewhat curved.\nness, it seems to be peculiarly affected by the sea air. This was remarked by Mr. Chambers in 1772 and 1776. \"All these figures are doubtless much less distinct, than they were at first; for on comparing these, and the rest of the sculptures that are exposed to the sea air, with others at the same place whose situation has afforded them protection from it, the difference is striking; the former being everywhere much defaced, while the others are fresh, as if recently finished;\" and it is necessary to bear in mind this characteristic, when discussing the antiquity either positive or comparative, of any portion of these edifices.\n\nThe greater part of these temples are excavations, after the fashion of Ellora and Elephanta; superior in taste and symmetry, though far inferior in dimensions, to the first named. The most perfect and beautiful is in a narrow ravine, towards the northern part of the range, and facing to the West; whereby it has been well protected from the effects of the sea air. Although small in its dimensions, it is remarkable for its artistic merit: the columns in particular are slender and most graceful; the pedestals couchant tigers facing outwards; the capitals elegant and well proportioned, though fashioned in a style unknown among the orders of Grecian architecture. Mr. Chambers remarks on its sculpture that \"the figures of idols in high relief on its walls are very well finished, and perfectly fresh.\" Another appears to have been dedicated to Siva, who is represented, in the middle compartment, of large stature and with four arms. A small figure of Brahm\u00e1 is on his right; Siva with his consort P\u00e1rvat\u00ed on the left; and his left foot rests on a bull couchant. At one end of the temple, is a gigantic figure of Vishnou sleeping on a Cobra-di-capello, with several heads so disposed as to form a canopy above the god. At the opposite end appears Siv\u00e1n\u00ed, in the character of Doorga, with eight arms, mounted on a lion; opposed to her is a gigantic figure with a human body and buffalo's head, much resembling that which is elsewhere called the Yum r\u00e9j\u00e1; between them is a human figure suspended head downwards, apparently the object of their dispute: and the monster brandishes a club, while the goddess is armed with various weapons and accompanied by some dwarf attendants.\n\nMr. Goldingham remarks, \"The figure and action of the goddess\nare executed in a spirited and masterly style:\" and Lieut. Newbold observes that \"the best executed figure of the king of the beasts, is that on which the goddess Doorga is seen, mounted in the sculptured cave near the summit of the hill.\"\n\nNot far off, a large polished slab about ten feet in length, with the figure of a couchant lion at the southern end, is shown as the bed of the Dharma r\u00e1j\u00e1: which may probably be understood as the \"Sit de justice,\" or throne, whence some prince of that name was wont to dispense justice to his people.\n\nOf the other caves some were considerably larger, and had more the appearance of being dedicated to Vishnou: all facing the East. But the striking point in which the whole series resembles that of Ellora is their unfinished state. Mr. James Fergusson remarks of them in a paper read to the R. A. Society in 1848.\n\n\"One of the most singular characteristics of this series of caves is, that they are all of one age, and probably the work of one prince, who has carried on the works simultaneously: but from some cause or other has been unable to complete even one of them. Had one been finished, or had there been any gradation of style or workmanship, some chronological arrangement might easily have been effected: but nothing of the kind exists.\"\n\nAnother still more remarkable point of similarity is the repetition of the sculptured group, representing a skeleton figure in a suppliant attitude before a personage appearing to possess authority. Mr. Goldingham describes the group at Mah\u00e1b\u00e9lipoor as follows:\n\n\"Near this structure, the surface of the rock about ninety feet in extent, and thirty in height, is covered with figures in bas relief. A gigantic figure of the god Khrishna is the most conspicuous; with his favourite Arjoon, in the Hindoo attitude of prayer; but so devoid of flesh, as to present more the appearance of a skeleton than of a living person; below is a venerable figure said to be the father of Arjoon; both figures proving the sculptor possessed no inconsiderable skill.\"\n\nIt does not appear whether Mr. Goldingham had any authority for this interpretation, beyond that of the attendant Brahmins, who are always ready to affix the names of some Hindoo god or hero to every ancient sculpture: but I could not perceive in the standing\nfigure, the usual attributes of Khrishna; neither can I recal any tale or legend, that represents Arjoon and his father Pandu as suppliants to that divinity, in a state of starvation.\n\nWhen I visited the caves of Ellora in 1841, Lieut. Howarth, then engaged in making drawings of the bas-reliefs, informed me that the group was generally considered to portray a miser, holding a bag of money, while his wife and son, reduced to skeletons, are vainly supplicating for food; but on minute inspection, I was not satisfied with this interpretation, and find my notes on the subject as follows.\n\nWhat is assumed to be a purse tied round the waist of the miser, has not the appearance of a sack containing money; but might rather represent a girdle, drawn tight round the body to ease the sensation of hunger, as is the custom with most semi-civilised nations: neither can it be a bag of coins that he holds in his hand, because the thick part is above the hand, and terminates in a point at top; but it might be an instrument for cutting the rock, which he is holding out to the half-starved figures at his feet. The little fat cherub may as well be supposed to be bringing him a bag of treasure, as to be taking it away; and then the entire group may be imagined to portray the cause and mode of construction of these caves, as a work undertaken by some prince or wealthy chief, during a time of famine, to relieve the wants of his starving people. Admitting this supposition, we shall have no difficulty in accounting for a continuation of the bas-relief which appears appended, not only to this group, but also to a similar one in less perfect preservation in another cave: and we shall recognize Ganesh, at the head of a row of females, each carrying a child in her arms, as exhibiting the eventual results of the judicious disbursement.\n\nThis interpretation is merely a conjecture; but it seems to derive great support from the existence of the same group on the rocks of Mahabalipuram. We can hardly imagine sculptors at such very different parts of India, happening to invent precisely the same story: though it might easily occur that both had to relate to posterity the same events. It is no very great stretch of credulity, to suppose that in both places, the works were undertaken by some prince, to employ his famishing subjects during a time of great scarcity; and to furnish them with food without supporting them.\nin slothful idleness. This is exactly what was done by Sir Charles Metcalfe, in our Upper Provinces during the famine of 1837-8, and it does not seem impossible that similar events might suggest similar remedies, to beneficent and intelligent minds, even at an interval of many centuries. Nor are we without some indications that such actually has been the case: for Mr. Taylor, quoting from the Mackenzie papers, says:\n\n\"It is said that in the Kali Yuga, Singhama Nada, a Zemindar of the Vellugotivara race, ruled at Mallapoor (Mavellipuram); in that time, during a famine, many artificers resorted hither, and wrought on the mountain a variety of works during three years.\"\n\nThis theory will explain how in both cases, (Ellora and Mahabalipuram,) a number of works were commenced simultaneously, in order to employ at once a large number of workmen: and how they came to be left unfinished; the people naturally returning to their ordinary occupations, when the pressure of famine was removed.\n\nI must not omit to mention another tradition, which attributes the construction of these works to a body of Northern artificers, who fled from the tyranny of their own or some conquering prince, and were suddenly recalled to their homes, by proffered favours and concessions on his part; nor the conjecture of Mr. James Fergusson, who, discrediting this story, accepts Singhama Nayadu as the prince to whom the excavations are due: and tracing him to his death in battle, while besieging the fort of Jalli Palli in the thirteenth century, conceives this event to be a more probable cause of the sudden interruption of the works, \"as they were not part of the religion of the people, nor was it likely that his successor would continue the follies of his parent.\" Either of these suppositions would certainly account for the non-completion of the works at Mahabalipoor: but we should then have to seek out some analogous cause for the same circumstance at Ellora: and the remarkable repetition of the significant group of sculpture would remain totally unexplained.\n\nThere are a variety of other sculptures both of beasts and human beings; and often presenting a mixture of both. The most conspicuous is the king snake, with the head and body of a man, terminating in extensive serpentine convolutions, often winding round other groups. They are nearly all on the eastern face of the rock: and\nmostly close to the principal caves, which are in the northern half of the range. In the same vicinity is a somewhat remarkable monolith; a mass of living rock left isolated, and artificially fashioned outside, as well as inside. It appears to be above twenty-five feet in height, the same in length and about half in breadth. It has a long roof curved like a Gothic pointed arch, and gabled at each end.\n\nThe walls are of great thickness, so that the interior cell is small: it contains a lingam, and among the sculptures on its walls, appears the figure of Ganesh in small dimensions. Its door faces the West: and close to it the Brahmins are quarrying the rock, to repair and beautify the interior of the brick pagoda; the only one in which the ceremonials of worship are performed, at the present day.\n\nAt the extreme south of the ridge, and separated from it by a small level space, along which runs the lower road from Madras to Cuddalore, stand a group of monoliths, seven in number, surrounded by a grove of cocoanut trees.* Five of them are pagodas; of which the most southern (measured by Mr. Goldingham forty feet in height) resembles in general outline a Mussulman mausoleum. Another twenty-five feet in height, and perhaps fifty in length, has a long Gothic roof as previously described, and is ornamented on the outside: the other three are more like modern pagodas. The two remaining rocks are fashioned to imitate an elephant and a lion, in colossal proportions. All these monoliths, though close to the sea beach, and perfectly exposed, are comparatively fresh in their outline, and exhibit very little signs of corrosion. They are composed of this same binary granite, and I think we may thence conclude their comparative antiquity not to be very great.\n\nThere still remain two\u2020 temples, differing from the former in being built, instead of hewn in the solid rock. The first, already alluded to, stands near the village on the level ground not far from the principal caves, and is of brick, plastered and coloured in the modern style. It is of considerable size, and is still used for purposes of worship, and for the accommodation of Hindu travellers. The brahmins enjoy some revenues attached to the building, and are busily engaged ornamenting and improving it: all which circum-\n\n* Or else\u2014palmyras: my recollection on this point is indistinct.\n\u2020 I have been told of a third farther north, but did not see it.\nstances,* combined with its perfectly recent form and appearance, are conclusive in my mind against any claims to great antiquity that may be advanced on its behalf.\n\nThe last remaining is that which has attracted most attention from travellers: it is built of large masses of hewn granite, on one of the granite rocks already mentioned, as protruding at intervals along the sea shore. It is nearly opposite the highest part of the ridge, and has apparently been built en rapport with some part of the excavated hill, from which it is a mile distant in an easterly direction. Its dimensions are small: speaking from memory, I should say, under thirty feet square: but its curiously ornamented conical roof rises to an elevation of nearly fifty feet: It is surrounded on three sides, by a granite screen of ten or twelve feet high, and about five feet distant from the body of the temple: on the fourth side (the West,) stands a miniature of the temple, opening towards the West, and bearing every appearance of having originally been its principal\u2020 entrance. The walls and roof of a connecting passage still exist, but all access by this route is now barred, by a slab of black basaltic rock, fixed in the eastern wall of the portico, opposite its entrance. A similar, rather larger slab occupies a corresponding place on the inner surface of the western wall of the temple; and on both are images of Siva, Parvatee and their child. I was unable to discover whether the space intervening between these two slabs is vacant, or has been filled up with masonry: but it is my very strong impression, that they and their immediately surrounding blocks of stone are long subsequent in date to the rest of the building, and have been inserted in order to mark the ancient entry. As matters at present stand, it is impossible to assign any reason for the existence of a blind chamber, or\n\n* It will generally be found that religious edifices, still possessing endowments, belong to the later phases of Hinduism: the more ancient having been lost, in the various political and religious contests.\n\n\u2020 As is constantly seen at present to the East of Hindu temples.\n\n\u2021 The centre is occupied by a large lingum which, from its dark colour, I conclude to be of this basaltic rock, which must have been brought from a considerable distance. The chaityas terminating the roofs of both temples and prophylium are the same. Every other part is granite.\nother mass of building, between two temples of Siva placed dos & dos; and there are only two suppositions that will account for the erection of these two buildings, of obviously the same date, with a covered passage of connection. Either the smaller was a sanctuary, to be entered only from the larger; as appears to have been the case in some of the Arian temples still extant in Cashmere: or else it must have been a portico, through which admission was obtained to the larger or real temple. The first hypothesis is contradicted by the existence of the western entry to the smaller edifice, which is certainly contemporaneous with its construction: and also by the fact that the stone screen, that so carefully encircles the larger building, ceases on arriving opposite the smaller. We are therefore thrown back upon the second;* which is supported not only by these circumstances, but also by the extreme simplicity of the present door to the larger temple; a mere plain opening in the wall. I may also mention that while the smaller building (and through it, were the passage still open, the larger one only) is approached from the west with ease and on a level; the only access to the simple opening in the eastern screen now serving as an entry is over a low, but steep and rugged rock washed by the breakers below. This rock has certainly the appearance, both here and elsewhere, of having been partly cut into rude steps, and partly perforated as if to receive some superstructure that has since disappeared. One solitary column still raises its head above the waves, and is commonly considered to have been a Stambha, to support lamps: it should however be remarked that there is no vestige of any mode of ascent, to place them; neither of niches wherein they might be placed. The top is formed into a kind of peg, as if to receive some capping stone, and I have myself little doubt, that it is the sole relic of some terrace or arcade, once extending in this direction: I also traced out faintly, the platforms of two collateral buildings; one on each side of that now standing: and among the d\u00e9bris of the southernmost, I discovered several images of the kneeling bull generally placed opposite a lingum, so corroded as to be only recognizable on careful.\n\n* The idea of the original entrance having been from the West, will appear less strange, if it be remembered, that the entrance and portico of the Kylas at Ellora actually are from that quarter.\nexamination. A similar image, in a better state of preservation, is to be seen within the granite screen, on one side of the portico; and on the other, in a closet or small chamber of comparatively recent construction, is a large recumbent statue of Vishnou, with the ordinary Ses-naga below and above him.\n\nOn the shore close by, are several rudely sculptured rocks: one representing a monster with human arms and the head of an ox or buffalo, commonly called the Yam raja. They have suffered greatly from the action of the sea air, as has also every part of the adjacent temple, except its chaityas of basalt. In this respect, there is a great difference between its appearance and that of the caves, or even of the group of monoliths placed in a situation no less exposed: and after close examination of all surrounding circumstances, I am unable to resist the conclusion, that this temple is by many degrees the most ancient of the remains at Mahabalipuram: in fact that it is one of the most ancient in India. I am aware that Mr. James Fergusson considers, \"that its age does not differ materially from the rest;\" and it is with the greatest diffidence that I venture to express an opinion differing from that entertained by so competent an authority: but Mr. Fergusson was specially engaged in the examination of the rock-cut temples; remarking the similarities and the differences existing between them and similar works in other parts of India; so that probably he had little leisure for this structure; to which I, on the contrary, devoted much attention. Besides, if I remember right, he decided these caves to be more modern than those of Ellora: at the same time he considered the celebrated Kylas of that place to have been copied from some earlier edifice of Southern India: and looking to the very great general similarity of style, I am certainly inclined to refer this shore temple of Mahabalipuram, to the age of those earlier structures, although the precise model of the Kylas may not be found here, but at Shellumbrum or Tanjore. This would give a considerable difference of date; and the supposition is borne out by the assurances of the Brahmins who attended Mr. Goldingham, that their ancient books \"contained no account of any of the structures here described, except the stone pagoda near the sea, and the pagodas of brick near the village.\" The obvious error of the last statement certainly detracts from the value\nto be assigned to the former; but it should not be forgotten, that these brick pagodas were in their own possession, and in present use; so that they had a motive for assigning to them a fabulous degree of antiquity: while they had no such inducement for making an untrue distinction between the caves and the other remains, all equally abandoned and valueless to themselves.\n\nBut whatever the age either actual or relative of the various temples of Mah\u00e1b\u00e1lipoor, it seems certain, that at some distant period, the place was one of no small importance. The ground immediately inland from the shore temple has obviously been built over, to a considerable extent. The extremely well cemented foundations of ancient walls are now dug out, as required for building materials; by the inhabitants of the neighbouring village; or for the improvement of the brick pagoda. I examined a large mass of concrete, with bricks on the lower surface, and found it extremely solid, and in excellent preservation. It consisted of sharp broken fragments of the granite of the place, mixed with unburned shells: the excellent mortar in which they were embedded being probably these same sea shells burned. The bricks were of the large size usual in all old Hindu structures: but not uniform in their shape. Those I measured varied from eleven to thirteen inches in length, from seven to seven and half in breadth and were pretty regularly two inches* thick; so well laid in the finest mortar, that five of them in situ barely measured eleven inches. Most of the houses in the village are built of these old bricks; but the ruins are so completely covered with a deposit of soil, and drift sand, that numerous excavations would be necessary, to afford even the vaguest idea of their extent. It is\n\n* I append a memorandum of the dimensions of old bricks I have collected within the limits of the Mahabharat, and an average of a much larger number of specimens from the neighbourhood, gives 15\u00bd by 8\u00bd by 2\u00bd.\n\nIt will be observed that here again the most variable dimension is the length: and the average of these north country bricks will be found to be exactly of the same proportions as the average of those at Mahabalipoor, the length 15\u00bd and breadth 9, being pretty nearly to the length 12 and breadth 7\u00bd inches as the thickness 2\u00bd is to the thickness 2.\nhowever certain, that there must have been a wealthy, and therefore in all probability a numerous population, where dwelling-houses were built of burned bricks, cemented with lime mortar; and where masons were sufficiently acquainted with the mysteries of their art, to use foundations of concrete, formed of the most durable materials, and on the most approved principles. It must be remembered that in classical days, the extremity of the peninsula was the entrep\u00f4t of commerce, between the east and the west. Gibbon says, \"Every year about the summer solstice, a fleet of a hundred and twenty vessels sailed from Myas Hormas, a port of Egypt on the Red Sea. The coast of Malabar or the island of Ceylon was the usual term of their navigation, and it was in those markets, that the merchants from the more remote parts of Asia expected their arrival. This fleet traversed the ocean in about forty days, by the periodical assistance of the monsoons.\" Whence we gather that the European fleets proceeded to India, with the commencement of the S. W. monsoon; and remained there until the beginning of the N. Easterly; which is consonant with all we know of the habits of the seamen of antiquity. But, at that time of year, the ports of the Malabar coast would have been extremely unsafe; besides that no large city is known to have flourished at that epoch, anywhere near Ceylon, with access from that quarter. It is therefore far more probable, that the laden ships, favoured by the strong southerly current along the shore, passed by the Malabar coast, and by the island of Ceylon, to find harbour on the Coromandel coast, and await the change that would take them on their return voyage. I have the authority of a commander of approved skill, and well acquainted with these seas, for saying that there are no physical features to prohibit the idea, that Mavellipoor may have been one of these ports. He answers my enquiries: \"There are no reefs off the Seven Pagodas; and the only danger in the vicinity, is a small reef nearly abreast of the collector's house at Tripalore, hence called the Tripalore reef, upon which one of the Company's vessels was wrecked some fifty years ago: but so near shore (half mile) as not to create any alarm at the present day,\" when its situation is perfectly ascertained. He adds, that even now ships passing along this coast generally make Sadras hills, to get into a good position for reaching more northern parts:\nand that \"there is no reason why the anchorage at the Seven Pagodas should not be as safe as Madras roads.\" Nor are there wanting indications of the place having formerly possessed far better anchorage than either Madras or Pondicherry could ever boast. Behind and south of the sculptured ridge for some distance inland, runs a salt-marsh, bearing every appearance of having once formed part of the estuary, which debouches about half-way between Sadras and the shore Pagoda. The soil is not at all like once firm ground, overflowed by the ocean, but rather the light pulpy character of silt, deposited by contending currents and streams in some nook, where their forces neutralised one another: an operation well known to be proceeding down to the present day in every quarter of the globe. A corresponding action, minor in degree because only due to rain and atmosphere, has most certainly taken place on the other side of the sculptured ridge: as is shown by the five or six feet of alluvial soil under which the ruins of the city are now buried: and we can with equal confidence assert, that foreigners were in the habit of visiting the place, as among the coins found in the vicinity, have been some of Rome, of China and other distant lands. No very great increase of depth in the estuary would (I believe, but I could not obtain accurate soundings) be necessary to admit vessels of the burthen then usual, and to afford them shelter equal to any on the coast. We have, therefore, I think, good reason to conclude, that in the olden days of which so few records have reached us, when the Chinese, the Phoenicians and the men of Tarsis united, as in the present day, the extreme east and west in bonds of amity by the mutual interchange of commodities, Mavellipoor or Mah\u00e9balipuram was a place of considerable commercial resort; and perhaps one of the chief ports of Southern India: very probably the Malearpha of Ptolemy. I am far from considering it equally certain that this was the capital city of the mythological hero Bali. We all know the tendency of the Brahmins to appropriate to their own sect every relic of antiquity they found in the countries over which they extended their influence: and beyond their own assertions, I do not know that we have the least evidence to the fact. \"The name still surviving\" will seem, to many, a strong argument: only it will not prove a sound one. The name of Mah\u00e9balipuram, \"the city of the\ngreat Bali,\" is only known at the present day to the Brahmins, and to Europeans who derived all their information either directly or indirectly from the Brahmins: and as there is no reason to believe that Sanscrit or Hindee was at any epoch the vernacular of that part of the country, we can hardly suppose that such a purely Sanscrit name ever was in common use thereabouts. Had the current name among the people been one that might possibly be considered a Tamul version of this significant epithet, we might certainly give some weight to the fact of such a name lingering about these remarkable antiquities: but on the contrary the common names of Mallapoor or Mavellipooram are* said to have no such meaning; and the similarity of sound would rather favour the idea that the Brahmins finding these remains with a name firmly annexed, adapted both to their own purposes; by fixing upon that one of their fabulous heroes, to whose title the foreign word could most easily be converted. Their own books do not afford much support to their present claims. The Mah\u00e1bh\u00e1rata describes the city as being\n\n\"South of the Ganges 200 Yojanas, 5.Yojanas westward from the eastern sea.\" It must be admitted that we do not know the exact equivalent of the Indian Yojana:\u2020 but it has generally been considered between nine and twelve miles, either of which would carry us far south of Ceylon! If therefore this quotation refers to any city on the present continent of India we must greatly reduce the length of the Yojana: say to five or even four miles which would about bring us to the latitude of Mavellipuram. But we must suppose that the proportion of two hundred to five was somewhat near the truth: and this would oblige us to look for Bali's capital not on the seashore but twenty miles inland, where to the best of my information no vestige of a city remains. If we assume the Yojana five miles\n\n* I cannot speak positively nor of my own knowledge, not being sufficient of a Tamul scholar.\n\n\u2020 A Pundit in this neighbourhood (Rohilcund) called it \"four kos:\" which would be from five to six English miles; as the local kos is seldom as much as one-half miles: and from a note to Chap. 22, of Fa Hian's pilgrimage it would seem that farther south the Yojana was only four miles.\ninstead of four, we shall certainly be able to satisfy both conditions pretty well in Combacorum, the Benares of the south, or in the ancient capital of the Pandyan kingdom, but either explanation is equally fatal to the claims of Mavellipuram.\n\nIt is true that it has been generally believed that the sea had encroached on this shore, and that many pagodas and buildings of this ancient city had been submerged even since the English settlements took place; and it may therefore be said that in all probability the site of this city was actually twenty miles from the sea in the days when the Mahabharata was written. This idea is founded partly on the mariner's name of the Seven Pagodas, said to indicate the existence (in the early days of English intercourse with India) of seven Pagodas on the shore where now only one remains. But personal inspection at once shows the fallacy of this derivation of the name: the shore temples being far too low to be perceived at the distance that ships usually pass; more especially as they are backed by the cave-hewn ridge; and it is infinitely more probable that Mr. Chambers was correct in referring the appellation to the peculiar appearance presented by the rounded peaks of this ridge itself, especially as temples were vaguely known to exist in that neighbourhood without their situation being very accurately settled. He says, \"The rock or rather hill of stone on which great part of these works are executed, is one of the principal marks for mariners as they approach the coast, and to them the place is known by the name of the Seven Pagodas: possibly because the summits of the rocks have presented them with that idea as they passed.\"\n\nA far stronger evidence, however in the general opinion, was the tradition imparted by the Brahmins, and perhaps other inhabitants, to the earlier European visitors of the place. Mr. Chambers relates: \"The natives of the place declared to the writer of this account, that the more aged people among them remembered to have seen the tops of several pagodas far out at sea; which being covered with copper (probably gilt) were particularly visible at sunrise, as their shining surface used then to reflect the sun's rays: but that now that effect was no longer produced, as the copper had become encrusted with mould and verdigris.\" Passing over as a minor objection that \"at sunrise\" the dark sides of the pagoda tops would\nalone be visible from the shore, and that they would be best seen when illuminated by the setting sun, I would enquire, how is it possible that these slender ornaments should shine \"far out\" in the surf of the Coromandel coast, where not years or months, but a few hours of the stiff gales, with which it is so constantly visited, would be all-sufficient, not only to destroy the lustre of gilt copper, but to dislodge every stone between high and low water mark? It cannot be supposed that any sudden convulsion lowered the whole coast, so that all at once the waves should roll within a few feet of the top, instead of below the foundations of the Pagodas: for such a convulsion must infallibly have shaken them to pieces, as well as levelled the existing temple, whose still uninjured pinnacles clearly disprove the hypothesis: therefore the subsidence, if ever it took place, must have been extremely gradual, like those of the Swedish and parts of the Italian coast: and recollecting the numerous years, (not to say centuries) that would be required to sink the forty or fifty feet which may reasonably be assumed to have been the height of the vanished structures, I only ask, is it credible that the waves should have spared them until only their tops (still bright and glittering notwithstanding the dashing spray!!!) remained above the surface.\n\nI am sorry to be obliged thus to demolish the beautiful romance of the \"Wave-covered metropolis of Bali;\" but it is not the first of the aerial castles of Indian tradition, that has faded before the fuller light of modern European investigation. Like Bishop Heber, I find it difficult to understand how this particular spot should have sunk so much, if (as other writers aver) the rest of the Coromandel coast, both north and south, has rather risen within historical times. I have already mentioned the local features leading me to conclude, that this immediate vicinity has not suffered any encroachment from the ocean, but has rather gained from, and increased in elevation above it by, alluvial deposits from the higher* lands: and if a Brah-\n\n* The brick foundations I have mentioned as being five or six feet below the present surface of the land, are very considerably more than that amount above high-water mark. I have not noticed Capt. Newbolt's argument in favour of the submersion of the city: viz. that Chinese and other coins are often washed ashore in storms; because the fact is equally explicable, by the supposition that this was a port frequented by foreign ships, of which some must necessarily, in the course of years, have been wrecked and sunk in the vicinity.\nmin legend is required, there happens to exist one in the Mackenzie papers (v. Mr. Taylor's 3rd report, section 9, page 65,) that comes as near to my view of the formation of the salt-march, as these tales generally do to the natural truths they often dimly chronicle.\n\n\"In early times one Mallesudu ruled here prosperously, but having refused charity to a Brahmin, he was changed into an alligator. A Rishi named Pundarica, going to pluck a lotus flower in the tank where the alligator lay, was seized by it, but had power to drag it out. The king thus obtained release and went to Swerga. The Rishi wished to present the lotus flower to Vishnoo, but the sea barred his way, and would not retreat; so he sat down to bale the sea out! While thus occupied, an ancient Brahmin came and asked for boiled rice, offering to do the Rishi's work, while the latter should go and cook it. 'By taking up a single handful of water the sea retreated a whole coss, and when the Rishi returned he found the Brahmin reposing in the manner in which statues of Vishnoo are sometimes represented. He now recognised the god, and a fane was built by him over the spot.' If this tale have any real foundation, it probably indicates, that after a period of abandonment this site was re-occupied, and great increase of land discovered to have taken place, about the time when the worship of Vishnoo was introduced into the southern peninsula; which being a date tolerably ascertained, may possibly guide some future visitor in fixing the age of the various structures; especially if assisted by some translation of the inscriptions which were unfortunately quite unintelligible to me.\n\nIt will be observed that I have made the freest use of the accounts of other travellers: partly, in order to present in a general view the remarks now scattered in half a dozen volumes, and partly in order to support by the authority of others, the conclusions drawn in my own confessedly hasty visit. Had I only been as well acquainted at that time as I am now, with the writings of my predecessors, I should have investigated far more closely several points that I now perceive with regret I almost overlooked. The shore temple alone can be said, to have been thoroughly examined: and I suppose it must have been deemed less worthy of notice by former travellers: else I do\nnot understand how it could escape* remark that the original entry of the building, must have been through the portico which is in rear at present. I trust what I have said may draw the attention of men better versed in Indian antiquities to the subject of the direction in which the entrance is placed in Hindu temples: as it may possibly prove characteristic of some particular sect or epoch. At the present day, all temples in these Upper Provinces (and as far as my observation goes, in the other Presidencies also) are turned towards the east: and a Brahmin at Huridwar gave me as a reason, the rising of the sun in that quarter. I remember\u2020 to have seen one exception (besides the Kylas at Ellora already mentioned;) which is on the grand trunk-road on the banks of the Burachur near Tal-danga. In a group of four temples, not differing essentially in style or architecture, and all apparently quite modern, one is turned to the west, while all the others are to the east, I could not discover that they belonged to different divinities, but there was no person near from whom I could positively ascertain that such was not the case.\n\nAnother point that strikes me as deserving attention, more particularly from Engineers and persons engaged on public works, is the very great durability of the basaltic rock as compared with the granite of the Coromandel coast. We have no reason to believe that the umbrella-shaped summits of the temples, which for want of a better term I have called chaityas, are otherwise than contemporaneous with the rest of the temple; and they are of course equally exposed to the spray and saline atmosphere: yet they appear perfectly fresh and uninjured, while the granite has lost the whole of its outer surface by gradual disintegration and exfoliation.\n\nI append two sketch plans to elucidate the above descriptions of locality: but they have no pretensions to strict accuracy, being done entirely from memory, months after I visited the place.\n\n* I have not been able to procure the papers of Mr. Babington or of Mr. Walter Elliot on the subject: but of the four or five I have perused no one touches this point.\n\n\u2020 And I think that among the Aryan temples of Cashmere, is said to be a group of four facing to all four cardinal points.\nNote on an ancient Inscription from Th\u00e1neswar.\n\nBy B\u00e1bu R\u00e1jen-Dral\u00e1l Mittra, Librarian, Asiatic Society.\n\nSubjoined is the legend of a Sanscrita inscription lately found in the Th\u00e1neswar district. Mr. Bowring, to whom the Society is indebted for facsimiles of this interesting record, states \"that it is engraved on a tablet of red sandstone in the temple of a follower of the Gorakn\u00e1th persuasion, in the town of Pehew\u00e1, which is about fifteen miles west of Th\u00e1neswar.\" Regarding the circumstance under which it was discovered, Mr. B. adds, \"I was marching from Patiala towards Th\u00e1neswar, and halted at Pehew\u00e1 which is on the banks of the Saraswati river, and is a place of pilgrimage of some note, having been formerly known under the name of Prithudak. It is included in the limit of the sacred territory, known as the forty coss, that is, the distance between certain places, or the four points of the compass, within which the skirmishes of the P\u00e1ndavas were carried on. The inscription was copied after my departure by the Th\u00e1n\u00e9d\u00e1r of Pehew\u00e1, and is, as you will observe, reversed. I am not sure whether it will prove to be legible, as a part of the inscription is effaced. It is possible, however, that there may be interesting matter in it.\"\n\nThe document is divided into two portions, the first of which is in verse and comprises twenty-one lines, and the second is, in prose and includes eight lines. They are both very imperfect, being full of lacun\u00e6, and several letters from the beginning and end of every line effaced; the inscription, however, is of importance as throwing some light on an interesting but little known period of Indian history.\n\nThe researches of Wilford, Colebrooke and Tod have proved that three different sovereigns of central India have assumed the title of Bhoja R\u00e1j\u00e1. The first of these, according to Tod apud Prinsep, flourished about the end of the 5th century (483 A. C.) the other two in the middle of the 7th and the 10th centuries (665 and 1035 A. C.) respectively. These dates however, excepting the last, have not been proved by any authentic testimony, and the history of the three princes has been very much confounded by Orientalists. Prinsep makes the first Bhoja the nephew of Munja, while the astronomical and astrological works quoted by Colebrooke concur in\nstyling the latter as the uncle and predecessor of the third Bhoja, a statement fully borne out by the Jain MSS. of Col. Tod and the authorities cited by Wilford and Bentley. Colebrooke places the celebrated \"nine jewels\" of Vicram\u00e1ditya in the court of the third Bhoja, while Prinsep, following Bentley, would have Kalid\u00e1sa flourish in the 5th century as a contemporary of the first king of that name.\n\nIf this imperfect inscription has been correctly read, these discrepancies are completely set at rest. It shows that the first Bhoja lived about three and a half centuries before the time assigned him by the learned historian of the Rajputs, and entirely overthrows the deductions of Bentley, regarding the age of Brahma, Gupta, Vararuchi, and of some of the leading astronomical works of the Hindus, as far as they are based upon the era of the renowned sovereign of Dh\u00e1ra. The Bhoja of Prinsep and that of the inscription are both descended from Mahendrap\u00e1la, but the former is the fourth, and the latter the tenth (if not more\u2014for the last six lines being defaced it is impossible to be positive) in descent from that sovereign; the intervening names too are different; they stand thus:\n\nPrinsep (Tables p. 106.)

But Kurukshetra itself, the battle-field of the P\u00e1ndus, on which the empire of India has been more than once contested and lost, is a perfect terra incognita to the antiquarian, and would\nprove a rich field to the tourist who with the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata or the Kuruk\u1e63etra Mahatmya by his side, could devote a fortnight to the wastes between Delhi and the

The data for establishing the Chronology are sound and good, and as they extend over a considerable period, we have the means of fixing the approximate dates of the earlier Kings.\n\n\"The earliest ascertained date is A.D. 804, and the average length of reign from that time to the present is 1,326 years.\"\n\n2nd. From Rev. N. Brown of Sibsagur, Assam, enclosing a list of Assamese works published at the American Mission Press at Sibsagur.\n\n3rd. From A. Campbell, Esq., Darjeeling, enclosing an abstract of the Register of rain-fall kept by Dr. Withecombe at Darjeeling, from 1st January to the 1st October, 1853.\n\n\"The maximum fall for a whole year,\" says Mr. C. \"was 135 inches in 1850, and the minimum 114 inches in 1852. I believe after a residence of many years that 125 inches may be taken as the average annual fall at Darjeeling.\n\n\"I am not able to supply any detail of the annual rain-fall at Cheera Punjee, but from Lieut. Yule's observation (see Journal Asiatic Society) and from Dr. Hooker's letter to me from that place in 1850, I believe that the annual fall of rain there varies from 360 to 500 inches per annum.\"\n\n4th.
