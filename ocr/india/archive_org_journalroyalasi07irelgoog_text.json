Guza. \ud808\udda0-\ud808\ude17, a Throne.\u2014Very frequent in the inscriptions. It always has the sign \ud808\udda0, the determinative of \"wooden objects,\" prefixed to it. I believe it to be a mere dialectic variation of the Hebrew \u05de\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05da\u05b0 solium regium (etiam Dei.\u2014Jerem. iii. 17). In shurrat sarti-ya, sha as guza sarti rabish usibu; In the beginning of my reign, when I sat proudly on my royal throne.\u2014Obel. line 22. Izpa u guza likim-su; Sceptre and throne may they take from him.\u2014R42, 73. Guza abi-su; his father's throne.\u20142 R38, 32. Guza billuti; throne of power.\u2014R39, 9. Guza nimidi; a palanquin.\u2014R39, 36.\n\n141. Izpa. \ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17, Sceptre.\u2014I think that the syllable \ud808\udda0 iz was sounded in this word, because it is also written \ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17 \ud808\ude17 ishapa. And I think that the sign for \"wood\" \ud808\udda0 was purposely omitted because the word itself began with that sign, so that it was present by implication. Nabo nasi izpa illuti; Nabo who carries the golden sceptre.\u2014Obel. line 11. Tamikh izpa; holder of the sceptre.\u2014R14, 56. Izpa isarti; the sceptre of justice.\u2014B.M. 38. 5. Isshapa isarti usatmikh gatu-ya; he hath caused my hand to hold the sceptre of justice.\u2014E.I.H. i. 45. Sha idinnam isshapa isarti; who has given me the sceptre of justice.\u2014E.I.H. iv. 19.\n142. **Agu.** \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc} \\), a Crown; pl. Agie, \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05b4\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd} \\).\u2014Agu raba sha reshdu-sha; the great crown upon her head.\u2014Slab K, 162. In 2R25, 23 and 44, 31, \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc} \\) is explained by \\( \\text{\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8} \\), which is known to mean \u201ca crown.\u201d Examples of the plural:\u2014Agie belluti; crowns of royalty.\u2014R8, No. 6, line 11. Nadin izpa u agie; giver of sceptres and crowns.\u2014Tig. i. 2.\n\nIn 2R38, 52 the images of Marduk and Zarpanita are adorned by the king with crowns of royalty (agie billuti) and crowns with lofty peaks? (agie garni tsirati).\n\n143. **Ag\u00fb.** \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05d5\u05bc} \\), a Crown.\u2014This word is the same as the last; a mere change in the fashion of spelling in the time of Ashurbanipal. It occurs in a very curious passage in 2R38, 45, a prayer for the king\u2019s happiness: \u201cSha sar ag\u00fb (of the lord of the crown), tami-su lu-ar(ka), (may the days be long!) shanati-su lirika, (may his years be prolonged.) bul-su as tuki lu-bullul, (may he live his life in happiness.) tsirrit shamie rapsuti libbita-su,\u2014the summit of high heaven may he behold (it)! Sabita (the seventh) . . . . . . [the rest is lost or uncertain].\u201d This remarkable passage evidently refers to a future life in heaven reserved for the king. For, having prayed for earthly felicity and length of life, the scribe now speaks of heaven; therefore no doubt he is asking for a heavenly life.\n\nAfter the word Sabita \\( \\text{\u05e1\u05b7\u05d1\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0} \\), the seventh, the tablet is broken; which is a pity, as perhaps the scribe was about to speak of \u201cthe seventh heaven.\u201d\n\nSome words in the above require explanation. Arka, Heb. \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05e7\u05b8\u05d0} \\) longus; li-rika, Heb. \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05b4\u05d9\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b8\u05d0} \\) and Assyrian ruku longinquus, remotus. \u201cYears\u201d is written as usual \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05d2\u05b4\u05d9\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05dd} \\). Mu, with a plural sign: this P.C. word I have replaced by shanati. Libbita, written \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0} \\), is from the Heb. \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0} \\) to behold, of which the future is \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0} \\) and the imperative \\( \\text{\u05dc\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d1\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0} \\) (Furst\u2019s Lex. 897); from which we\nget the optative *libit*. The verb means \"to behold,\" with the accusative following.\u2014Job xxxiv. 5, Genesis xv. 5. The passage of Genesis illustrates and remarkably confirms the explanation which I have given: \"Look now toward heaven and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them; and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be!\" Here the verb is used exactly as in the Assyrian writing\u2014of looking up to heaven. Hebrew: Ebit ha shamima! behold the heavens! Assyrian, in the optative: (l)ibbita shamie! may he behold the heavens! And also in the fine passage in Job xxxv. 5: \"Look unto the heavens and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou!\" the verb employed is \u05d9\u05b8\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d0 as before.\n\n144. **Aga.** A King.\u2014Derived from *Agu* (see preceding articles). Aga nu-bila; king everlasting (epithet of Marduk in R70).\n\n145. **Kudur.** \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b7\u05e8, \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b7\u05e8, a Crown, or some kind of royal head-dress.\u2014This word was altered by the Greeks into \u039a\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1\u03c1\u03af\u03c2, which is explained by Liddell and Scott as a Persian head-dress, probably the same as the royal Tiara.\n\nKudur as reshdu-ya assim, *I placed the \"Kudur\" on my head; usassab ramani, and I seated myself.*\u2014Bl. Stone of Esar-haddon, R50, col. iv. 10. Assim from the Heb. sim \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b5\u05bc\u05df ponere.\n\n146. **Sakkanakku.** \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5, \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5, \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5, \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5, the High Priest (only at Babylon).\u2014This word is derived in my opinion from \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5 sagan (a priest) and ukku (great), making sagan-ukku, the high priest. \u05e1\u05b7\u05d2\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d5 is only used in the Bible during and after the Babylonian captivity. It is clearly a Babylonian word. Daniel was appointed by the King of Babylon rab saganin or chief sagan. In that capacity he had rule \"over all the wise men of Babylon.\"\u2014Dan. ii. 48.\n\nUkku is a Scythian or Median and probably also Proto-Chaldean word, meaning \"great\" (Norris's Scythian Glossary, p. 181, in Journ. R. A. S., Vol. xv.). Moreover the capital city of Maniah, \"king of the rebellious Dah\u00e6,\" was called\nBut the Dahae were a Median or Scythian race, and *ukku* only meant the \"great city\" of that kingdom. In line 13 we read \"He fled from Ukku his royal city and went to a great distance from it. I took and destroyed the city of Ukku and carried off its spoil.\"\n\n**147. Ishakku.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Ishakku} \\quad \\text{a Priest.\u2014R 52, 6;} \\]\nand in the Birs Nim. inscr., R 51, 3.\n\n*Ishakku tsiri,* the high priest. I think it probable that the termination *akku* meant \"great,\" as in *Sakkanakku* (see last article).\n\nIn Heb. \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d0 is *senex = \u03c0\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b2\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2* presbyter. I do not find it used for priest. It may have been so, however, in Babylonian. If so, it was perhaps the root of *Ish-akku,* or *Ishakku.*\n\n**148. Imga.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Imga, a Priest, of the order of Magi.\u2014} \\]\nThe father of Nabonidus, king of Babylon, was a priest of high rank, who bore the title of Rubu Imga, which is also written Imga, where is a monogram for Rubu.\n\nSee the inscriptions Nos. 2 and 3 in R, plate 68. The first letter is sometimes omitted, and the word is spelt Im-ga.\n\nThis personage, the father of Nabonidus, was the Rab Mag mentioned in Jeremiah xxxix. 3, who entered Jerusalem in triumph, along with many other princes of Babylon, in the days of Nebuchadnezzar. If not the same, at any rate he bore the same title and rank. *Imga mutninnu,* most liberal high priest, is a title of Nebuchadnezzar in R 52, 11. Muda imga occurs in the Birs N. inscr., R 51, 4.\n\n**149. Mutninnu.**\n\n\\[ \\text{Generous, Liberal, full of Gifts.\u2014Imga mutninnu, R 52, 11, a title of Nebuchadnezzar; see last article. Ashri kansu mutninnu, R 51, line 2 of the Senk. inscr.\u2014here the word is spelt as before, except } \\text{in the place of } \\text{.} \\]\nFrom the Chald. *mutnin* \u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df gifts, plural of \u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05e0\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0. \n*Ex.*, Daniel ii. 48, \u201cThen the king made Daniel a great man, \nand gave him many great gifts.\u201d \u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df \u05e8\u05b6\u05d1\u05b6\u05df *mutnin rabrabin.*\n\nAnother form of the word is \u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df donum; whence a \ngenerous man is called \u05d0\u05b5\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 \u05de\u05b0\u05ea\u05b7\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05df. All from the root \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc or \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc to give.\n\nAnother title given to Nebuchadnezzar on account of his \ngreat generosity, \u201cmustihu baladam,\u201d dispenser of gifts, will \nbe considered in the next article.\n\n150. **Balat.** \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b7\u05ea, a Gift.\u2014Also written Balada and Balathu. \nSee Art. 36. That article requires correction. In 2 R66, Part 2, \nwe read: \u201cO Beltis, I have built for thee a splendid temple \nand altar. Grant me in return for it a long life!\u201d Grant! is \nexpressed by the word *tin* \u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df, which is exactly the \nHebrew \u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df *tin* (give!), the imperative of *natan* \u05e0\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05df to give, \nwhich drops the *n* in the tenses, like most other verbs which \nbegin with that letter. *Ex.*, \u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df \u05dc\u05b0\u05d7\u05b8\u05db\u05b0\u05de\u05b8\u05d4 \u201cgive to a wise \nman!\u201d Proverbs ix. 9. But instead of *tin*, another tablet in \nthe British Museum has *balat* \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc\u05b7\u05ea in this passage, although \nthe rest of the inscription is the same in both tablets. Hence \nwe perceive that *balat* is a verb, in the imperative mood, \nmeaning *give!* or *grant!*\n\nAt first this may seem surprising, if not doubtful, but if we \nexamine we find other proofs that *balat* meant a grant or gift. \nThus in Phill. i. 4, Nebuchadnezzar, among other titles of excel-\nlence which he assumes, calls himself Mustihu baladam, giver \nof gifts; and this corresponds exceedingly well with his boast \nin another inscription (R52, 11), that he was *Imga mutninnu*, \n\u201cthe generous high priest\u201d (see No. 149). Hence in \nSenk. ii. 18, we should translate *balat tami rukuti*, \u201cthe gift \nof a long life\u201d (here the other cylinder reads *balathu*). And \nin Birs N. ii. 20, *baladam dara* is \u201cthe gift of long time.\u201d\n\nThat *tin* \u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df is equivalent to *balat* or *balathu* is further\nproved by No. 152 of the Syllabary (quoted by Norris, p. 97):\n\n\\[ \\text{which means that} \\]\n\n\\[ \\text{was sounded ti-in (i.e. tin), and its meaning is the same as balathu.} \\]\n\nAnother and very remarkable example of the word balat, \"a gift,\" occurs in the E.I.H. col. 2, line 1: Sha baladi-ya lu-tippish, when I had made my offering [at the shrine of Marduk]. The verb here employed, ebus (fecit), becomes in the t conjugation etibus (fecit). And the preter-perfect tense is etibbus, etippish, &c. (feceram).\n\nBalat, a gift, must be distinguished from balat, \"life,\" which occurs in the next article, with the variant reading bullat.\n\n151. Akhadat. Some.\u2014Agrees with the Heb. unus. So the Greeks say Evioi \"some,\" derived from Ev \"one.\" And in French, les uns \"some;\" ex.gr., les uns disent, some say. It is strange that the Lexicons do not give this easy and natural etymology of the word Evioi, especially as the analogy of the German is so strong; viz., plur. einige, \"some.\" The German has likewise the singular, which the Greek has not, ex.gr., Er hatte einiges geld, \"he had some money.\"\n\nAkhadat was first explained I believe by Norris (dict. p. 26): \"The rebels came to me, and embraced my feet. Some of them I slew; some of them I pardoned (or let live); some of them I expelled from the place.\" Akhadat duku; akhadat bullat; akhadat shazibkani ebus.\u2014R19, 81. The words are duku, I slew; balat, I let live (with a variant reading bullat). shazib kani, expelled, driven away. The last word is derived from shazib eripere, eruere [homines]; to remove forcibly, expel, root out. Runaways or exiles were called mushazib.\u2014Buxtorf, p. 2358.\n\nThe letter is very frequently Zib. Its other value is Ljib.\n152. **Bulthut.** Alive.\u2014A good example of this word will be found in R14, 75: \u201cTen (buffaloes?) I slew; four I took alive (bulthut). Their skins and their horns, together with the live buffaloes (bulthut) to my city Ashur I brought home.\u201d\u2014Diku u bulthu, killed and taken alive.\u2014Beh. line 83, in the account of a battle. The root is bul, life.\n\n* Bulthut is the participle of the verb Bullith, \u201cto give life,\u201d which occurs in 2R36, 17.\n\n153. **Isinati.** otherwise written Religious Festivals.\n\nIsinati-su as arkhi lu-ashkun; I fixed his annual festivals in the 11th month Sebat and in the 6th month Elul (January and August).\u2014R23, 134. This is said of the god Ninev.\n\nAnother example is found in Phill. iii. 7. The King honors Nebo and Marduk, and says that he has appointed \u201cisinati-sun damgati,\u201d their holy festival days; \u201chakit-zun rabti,\u201d and their great solemnities. The word hakit is the plural of hag, which in Assyrian as in Hebrew signifies a religious festival, and also the victim there sacrificed.\n\n154. **Nimidi.** The guza nimidi was the king\u2019s travelling Palanquin (see No. 140). I believe no etymology has yet been offered of this word. I will, therefore, suggest that it comes from the Hebrew \u05e0\u05d9\u05dd num, to sleep. The great distances the monarch had to travel when he accompanied his army on foreign expeditions must have rendered some lectica necessary, on which he could sleep, or at any rate repose at full length. This view of the word nimidi is, I think, confirmed by the verbal gloss in 2R24, 20, where mazzar nimdi is rendered iskibbu (lectica, cubile, lectus), from Hebrew \u05e9\u05db\u05d1 cubare, dormire. A similar substantive, askup or askupat, is used for a flat stone lying down and covering an object. So we say in English \u201cthe sleepers of a railway.\u201d\nIn Opp. Khors. 131, among other articles of plunder are enumerated a Guza of gold, a Nimatti of gold, a Sceptre of gold, &c. (in that order). This nimatti may be the same as the guza nimidi, since it is mentioned immediately after the guza.\n\n155. Ikribi. Prayers, accompanied by Sacrifices.\u2014Ashur ikribi-su ishimi; Ashur will hear his prayers.\u2014Inscr. of Bellino, last line. In the invocation to Beltis, 2 R 66, 7, that goddess has the title Shamat ikribi, \u201cshe who hears our prayers.\u201d Shamat is the feminine participle of Heb. to hear. Many other female participles occur in that inscription.\n\nThe singular ikribu is explained in a bilingual list in 2 R 31, 24, by the monogram , which means a sacrifice. The same word is found in the Heb. ekrib, fut. ikrib, which is the Hiphil of , and means to sacrifice.\u2014Furst, p. 1255. The substantive formed from it is korban, a sacrifice; a word well known to the English reader from its occurrence in Mark vii. 11, where it is taken in a wider sense.\n\n156. Mir. a Crown.\u2014The version which I have given (see Trans. R.S.L., Vol. 8, p. 244) of the tablet K, 162, concerning the jewels of the goddess Ishtar, has been considerably improved by a correction made by Mr. Norria, p. 355. It will now commence thus:\n\n1. The first time I deprived her of an ornament,\n2. Was taken off the great Crown upon her head.\n\nThe Assyrian has Mir raba sha reshdu-sha.\n\nWhen the jewels are restored, this one has a different name\u2014Agu raba sha .reshdu-sha. But Agu means a crown (see No. 142); therefore Mir also means a crown. The version gains very much by this, for assuredly the Crown of the goddess was her principal glory, and (in my version) it was not found anywhere. But now we find it, and on her head. The proof\nwhich Norris gives is from the bilingual lists in 2 R 25, 23, and 44, 31\u2014\\[ \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\ude2a\ud808\ude7f} \\] rendered \\[ \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\ude2a\ud808\ude7f} \\]. That is, Mir in P.C. is Agu in Assyrian. But Agu means a crown.\n\nHaving thus established that the Mir worn by the goddess was her crown, let us consider what is the origin of the word? It is, I think almost indubitable that it is the Persian Mitra or Crown, which was very much ornamented with divers colours, as we see by this line of Theocritus (xvii. 19):\n\n\\[ \\text{\u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03b9 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c1\u1f7a\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b5\u1f78\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f30\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u03ac\u03b9\u03c2.} \\]\n\nHerodotus says (i. 195) \"The Babylonians wear mitres on their heads\"\u2014\\[ \\text{\u03c4\u1f70\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c1\u1fc7 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03cc\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9.} \\]\n\nIn Cyprus only the kings wore mitres (Herod. vii. 90). This is sufficient to show that it was a head-dress of honour.\n\nThe mir raba of the goddess may have been a jewelled mitre. The mitra was worn in Asia by women as well as men, else it would not have been adopted by the Greek women,\n\n\\[ \\text{\u03c0\u03b5\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1f76 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03c1\u03b5\u1fd6\u03c2, \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u1fb6 \u03b4\u1fbf \u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u1f76 MITRA.} \\]\n\n(description of Pentheus disguised as a woman.)\u2014Eur. Bacch. 831.\n\nIn common conversation Mitra would easily be contracted into Mir, just as pater became p\u00e8re; mater, m\u00e8re; and frater, fr\u00e8re. A closer instance is seen in the name of the god Mithra: Persian, Mihr, the Sun.\n\n157. Nu-tarda. \\[ \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\ude7f} \\]. A Proto-Chaldaean word, which probably means \"a man without authority,\" \"an ordinary person,\" \"a poor man.\"\u2014It is put in contrast with aklu, a man of rank, which is the Hebrew \\[ \\text{\u05dc\u05b9\u05d5\u05d9} \\] potens. This P.C. word designates a class of men in some of the Michaux inscriptions in the British Museum. It occurs again on tablet 169, where Tarda \\[ \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\ude7f} \\] is explained by the Assyrian word Dinu \\[ \\text{\ud808\udc97\ud808\ude7f} \\], which I consider to be the Hebrew \\[ \\text{\u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9} \\], Adon = lord, signor, seigneur; or to be at any rate derived from the same root with \\[ \\text{\u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9} \\], which is also cognate with \\[ \\text{\u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9} \\] to rule (regere, moderari, imperare.\u2014Gesen.).\nIn the next line of tablet 169 we find our word Nu-tarda explained by \\( \\text{val dinu} \\) (not a Dinu). For, \\( \\text{nu} \\) in P.C. and \\( \\text{val} \\) in Assyrian, both mean \"not.\" From the preceding bilingual gloss this much at least is certain, viz., that nu-tarda is a negative term, and the contrary of tarda. And from what I have said above it appears to mean \"an ordinary person,\" \"not a man of rank,\" \"a poor man,\" &c. &c.\n\nThe Hebrew \\( \\text{to govern, and Adon, Lord, seem to be cognate with the Greek} \\Delta\\upsilon\\nu, \\text{the root of} \\delta\\upsilon\\nu\\alpha\\mu\\alpha\\iota\\iota, \\delta\\upsilon\\nu\\alpha\\sigma\\tau\\eta\\varsigma, \\&c. \\&c. \\)\n\n158. **Nu-kimmut.** \u2014 Unassailable, unconquerable.\u2014\n\nIn R35, No. 2, line 2, Nebo bears the title of \\( \\text{Son of the god Nukimmut. I have come round to that opinion, having mistaken the meaning at first. In R17, 2, the same epithet is applied to Ninev; but instead of} \\text{\"Son,\" we find} \\text{bukur, \"eldest son,\" the Hebrew} \\text{\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df\u05be\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e7\u05b5\u05e8}. \\)\n\nIn 2R67, 67, Nebo bears the same epithet; but now \\( \\text{is replaced by} \\text{rubu, \"chief\" or \"great.\" I presume that this is equivalent to} \\text{bukur, \"eldest.\" The above explanation of} \\text{is due to Norris, p. 374, who found it used as an epithet of Ninev, \"eldest son of Bel,\" in R32, 16. The epithet nu-kimmut consists of two words, for they are sometimes found in separate lines. And since} \\text{nu has no other meaning than \"not,\" the word} \\text{nu-kimmut must mean \"the god who is not kimmut,\" and the latter word has all the appearance of a participle from the verb} \\text{kim}. \\text{This verb signifies insurgere, and I would, therefore, translate} \\text{nu-kimmut by \"the god who is unassailable,\" or \"against whom resistance is vain.\" It is remarkable that the same phrase exists in Hebrew, only it is applied to a king and not to a god, We read in Proverbs xxx. that a king is} \\text{al kum}, \\text{which Schindler, p. 1602,}\nexplains \"contr\u00e0 quem nemo audet insurgere,\" from \u1e24N non,\nand \u1e24N surgere. Now, if we replace the Hebrew \u1e24N by the\nP.C. Nu, and kum by the participial form kimmut, we obtain\nthe epithet nu-kimmut.\n\nIn the remarkable inscription of Sargina, B.M. 33, 6, he\ncalls himself, the fierce destroyer, \"sha emukan tsirati Nukimmut ishruku-su, kuti tsirri ustibbu idussu; to\nwhom the god Nukimmut has given his lofty 'emukan,' and has\nplaced his long arrows in his hand.\" Here, I think, ustibbu is\nthe Chald. \u1e63\u1e25\u1e25 \"to give,\" \"to communicate.\" But the\nmeaning of emukan is doubtful. It sometimes seems to mean\nArms or Weapons; sometimes other things. But since it is\nfollowed in this passage by kuti tsirri, \"long arrows,\" it\nis probable that we should take emukan also in the sense of\nweapons. The passage is very like one in Tigl. Pil. vi. 57:\n\"The gods Ninev and Sidu gave to my hands their piercing\narrows and their long spears.\" In Sargina's inscription, instead\nof Ninev and Sidu, we have Nukimmut, whose name (the\nunconquerable) may, I think, be safely paraphrased as \"the\ngod of War.\"\n\nOn further consideration I think that the Emukan in the\nabove quoted passage, B.M. 33, 6, are \"Spears.\" Compare the\nclause in Sargina's prayer to the god of war (Opp. Exp. p. 333),\nwhere he says, speaking of himself in the third person, \"Protect\nhis horses! preserve his chariots! make to fly far his uncon-\nquerable spears! and make his arrows sharp, to destroy his\nenemies!\" The only part of this which I need analyse is\nthat regarding the Spears. It stands thus: Sutali-su emukan\nlashanan! Now, \u1e6dal is the proper verb in Hebrew for\n\"throwing a Spear.\" Schindler renders it jactavit, vibravit,\nprojecit. In 1 Sam.xviii. 11, Saul threw his spear with the\nintention of slaying David. The original Hebrew text has \u1e6dal,\n\"he threw.\" It is plain, then, that the imperative Tal\nis Throw [the spear]. But the imperative of the Shaphel\nconjugation Sutal is, Cause it to be thrown!\nTherefore, when we find in a prayer to the god of war for his aid and blessing, \"Sutali-su emukan,\" this must mean \"Cause his spears to be well thrown!\" The adjective lashanan probably means \"unconquerable,\" from Shanan, to conquer. This verb in the T conjugation forms ashtanan, \"I conquered,\" and ishtananu, \"they conquered.\"\n\nAnother argument for rendering emukan \"spears\" is the following:\u2014When Sennacherib fought with the Egyptians (B.M. 38, 75) the latter brought up against him emuki la nibi, which seems to mean \"Spearmen without number.\"\n\n159. **Nu-bila.** \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737, Everlasting, Eternal (see the next article).\n\n160. **Bila.** \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737, otherwise \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737, the End.\u2014Also, that which comes to an end: finite: mortal. This P.C. word occurs in the Michaux inscription, R 70, col. iii. 13, where the god Marduk has the title or epithet Aga nu bila; \"king without end,\" or \"living for ever.\" The phrase is explained in a tablet lithographed in 2 R 13, 50, where the P.C. \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 is rendered by the Assyrian gamru \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737; and in the next line \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 is explained la gamru. Now, the Hebrew gamar \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 means \"to come to an end, to cease\" (Furst's Lexicon, p. 293); and therefore \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 nu-bila means \"never ending.\" These explanations of bila and nu-bila are, each of them, given three times in the above-mentioned tablet, 2 R 13, lines 50 to 55.\n\nIn R 59, 66, Nebuchadnezzar says that he is the Vicegerent of Marduk, or his Vicar on Earth. He says in his prayer to Marduk: \"Thou hast clothed me with the sovereignty of the World, kima dumuk-ka bilu \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737, like thy Mortal Image.\" To illustrate this, I will give another example of the word dumuk, which is written both \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 and \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737 \u2737, \"I made an Image (dumuk) of his great divinity in (white marble?) stone, and shining gold.\"\u2014R 23, 133.\n181. **Itzutzu.** \u4ed6\u8bf4\uff1b\u4ed6\u4eec\u8bf4\u3002 *Dixit, dicunt, ut aiunt, &c. &c.*\u2014The origin of this verb appears to me to be the Heb. *itza* \u05d0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b8\u05d4, to go forth, with the last letter reduplicated \u05d0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b8\u05d4. So the English verb \u201cto utter;\u201d Germ. \u00e4ussern, come from *out*, and *aus* respectively, and are, in fact, the same word in different dialects. So *edere* and *efferre*, from the preposition *e* or *ex*\u2014Ede tuum nomen (Ovid), Speak out thy name!\u2014Decenter aliquid efferre (Quint.), to speak with propriety. Also we have the *sha-*conjugation of \u05d0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b8\u05d4 *shatza* or *shazza*, to speak (see the next article). The verb *itza* \u05d0\u05b4\u05e6\u05b8\u05d4 is used in Hebrew not only for solemn utterances as a decree, the sentence of a judge, the promulgation of doctrine, or the like, but also for common conversation and vulgar rumour.\n\nExample of the word *itzutzu.*\u2014In line 75 of the Obelisk we read\u2014\u201cMarduk-bel-utzati akhu dubut-zu itti-su ibbuluk, malmalish *itzutzu*; Marduk-bel-utzati, his younger brother, split with him (as they say).\u201d In fact the brothers quarrelled, and a civil war arose (all which is again related in 2R65, 51). The important phrase here is *malmalish itzutzu*, \u201cas they say in common parlance,\u201d or perhaps \u201cas people say in that dialect.\u201d *Malmalish* is an adverb, derived from Hebrew *mala* \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4 to speak, \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4 a word). The reduplicate form is partly preserved in \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0\u05b8\u05d4. This adverb, doubtless, means \u201cin common conversation.\u201d The parenthesis thus suddenly interposed, like the Latin \u201cut aiunt,\u201d refers to some unusual word that has just preceded. But what is that word? This seems difficult to decide. I think it must be either *dubut* or *ibbuluk*; more likely the latter, because it precedes the remark more immediately. But I do not see that *ibbuluk* is so unusual as to call for a special remark on the part of the scribe. *Buluk*, \u201cto rebel,\u201d is not unfrequent, *ex.gr.*, in bulukti-su rabti, in his great rebellion.\n\nThe account of this fraternal quarrel in 2R65, 51, which is unfortunately much mutilated, is not copied from the Obelisk, but from some more copious annals of those times.\nIn this second account, Marduk-bel-utsati is simply called \"his brother,\" and not \"his younger brother.\" Instead of \"itti-su ibbuluk\" it has \"ki-su,\" with him; and it omits the parenthesis *malmalish* *itutu*, which perhaps this later scribe considered to be unnecessary.\n\nI will now give another example of the verb *itutu*, from 2R8, 37, in which it is spelt precisely in the same way: \n\nBut I must preface it by a few observations to make it intelligible. King Ashurbanipal was a great patron of literature, and to him we owe the fine collection of Grammatical tablets which are now in the British Museum. He took a great personal interest in the matter, as is evident from the boast inscribed by his orders on so many of the tablets \"that no king before him had ever done so much for Learning,\" with thanks to the gods for having so enlarged his intelligence and sharpened his eyesight. He had founded in his palace what, for want of a better term, I may call a College, in which he employed many scribes, who covered the tablets with records of omnigenous learning. Who the pupils were who frequented this college and were initiated into the learning of the age is not ascertained. Many of the tablets contain brief allusions to some course of study. Thus one tablet speaks of \"so many months, so many days, and half a day;\" which, I think, refers to the time in which some particular branch of study had been completed by some class of pupils. If the pupil was one of the young princes, we can easily imagine that a notice of his progress, or something of his writing, would be often submitted to the King; or, if he were a more ordinary person, to the Governor of the Palace.\n\nThe passage in 2R8, 37, to which I wish to draw attention, contains a kind of Certificate from one of the Teachers that the lessons in grammar or languages have been thoroughly mastered by some one, who, of course, must have been one of the scholars.\nIt is as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{malvasu bikharish itsutzu.} \\]\n\\[ \\text{malvasu bikharish ibatzu.} \\]\n\nThe whole of the foregoing he has said perfectly;\nThe whole of the foregoing he has understood perfectly.\n\nThe monogram \\( \\text{malvasu} \\) is very common on the tablets: it is a compendious mode of expressing \u201cthe same with what precedes\u201d or \u201cthe same as before.\u201d It serves the same use as our ditto or \\( d^o \\). [that which hath just been said; the Italian \u201cdetto\u201d]. I have rendered it \u201cthe foregoing.\u201d\n\nMalvasu, \u201cthe whole of it,\u201d is an extremely common word. See the Art. Malvasu.\n\nBikharish, \u201cin a first-rate manner,\u201d is derived, if I mistake not, from the Heb. \\( \\text{primus fuit} \\). It is a very common adverb, usually employed in praise of the king\u2019s success in war, who frequently says: All that country I reduced to obedience \u201cin a first-rate manner\u201d or \u201cadmirably well.\u201d\n\nIbatzu, in the second sentence, is written \\( \\text{matza} \\). It may come from either of the roots \\( \\text{matza} \\) or \\( \\text{matza} \\). Of these I prefer the first, matza \\( \\text{matza} \\) assecutus est; for this is used in the sense of \u201clearning,\u201d ex.gr., assequi sapientiam, to learn wisdom.\u2014Ges. The other verb, the Syriac batia \u201cinvestigavit,\u201d suits very well, ex.gr., \\( \\text{matza} \\) batzu, examine (the Scriptures),\u2014Schindl. 226: but it was, I think, hardly an ancient word. At any rate, it was much less commonly employed than \\( \\text{matza} \\), of which Furst gives the meanings, \u201cto attain to, acquire, understand, comprehend.\u201d\n\n162. Shatza. To Speak, Call, Proclaim.\u2014The sha or shaphel conjugation of itza, Heb. \\( \\text{sha} \\).\n\nSha Ashur Marduk zigir sumi-su ushatzu ana risheti, whom Ashur and Marduk have proclaimed the renown of his name to the end of time (Praises of Sargina, B.M. 33, 2); written \\( \\text{sha} \\). The same is found in Botta 36, 4, where more gods are named, and sumi \\( \\text{sha} \\) is replaced\nby the monogram \u261e. And on Sargon\u2019s Cylinder, line 3, where the verb is written \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e. In Opp. Khors. line 4, the same recurs, with the adjective \u261e \u261e \u261e damku, \u201choly,\u201d or \u201cfortunate,\u201d added; so that the sentence is\u2014\u201cthe gods sounded the fame of his happy or sacred name.\u201d The adjective damku is of frequent occurrence, and is always rendered by the P.C. \u261e \u261e \u201choly\u201d or \u201cfortunate.\u201d\n\nZigir is not only \u201cnomen,\u201d but also \u201crenown\u201d (like renomm\u00e9e, from nomen). It is the Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 nomen.\n\nRisheti is rendered by Norris, p. 321, \u201cthe ends [of the world].\u201d But there is no word in the text answering to \u201cworld.\u201d I render it \u201cthe end of time,\u201d and derive it from \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05dd summa, and \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5 tempus.\n\nThe Art. Ishazzu, No. 110, should probably be conjoined with this one. Shazza or Shatza, \u201cto call;\u201d thence ishazzu-ru, \u201cthey call it.\u201d\n\n163. Litash, plur. Litassi. \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e \u261e, a Teacher.\u2014In a grammatical tablet in the British Museum, published by Oppert (Exp. sc. en M\u00e9s. p. 359), Ashurbanipal says that he caused these tablets to be made and placed in his Palace for the enlightenment of the Teachers; ana tamarti litassi-ya kireb haikal-ya ukin.\n\nLitash is the Heb. Lutash \u05dc\u05b8\u05ea\u05b7\u05e9\u05c1, a Master or Teacher; see Sch. p. 947. Thus, in Genesis, Tubal-cain is the lutash or teacher of all workers in metal. The Talmud renders it rabbon or great master. Tamarti, \u201cenlightenment;\u201d from the root mar, to see, to be seen, to be bright, &c. &c., of which the compounds are frequent and various, ex.gr., Ini namirti: far-seeing eyes. Ashar la mari; a place in which a thing cannot be seen, a dark place. Namari; the dawn of day, when things just become visible. Nammir; to make bright. Namri; bright, glittering, &c. &c.\n\nThe letter \u261e is sounded as li in this word Litash. This\nusage is frequent. Thus, in R19, 103, *illi ku* (they went) is written \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\ude17\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40} \\]. But the other copy of the inscription reads \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\ude17\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40} \\].\n\nMr. Norris has pointed out (dict. p. 418) a remarkable spelling of this word, \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\ude17\ud808\udcf6\ud808\udd40} \\] which occurs in 2 R42, 57. Here \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\udd40} \\] has the value *tas*, which is not unfrequent in other words.\n\n**164. Nebuzaradan.** \\[ \\text{\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udda0} \\], 2 R64, 13, i.e. Nebo has given seed (or, a son).\n\nThis proper name is very interesting, because it occurs in the Bible: \"And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which is the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, unto Jerusalem. And he burnt the house of the Lord,\" &c. &c.\u20142 Kings xxv. 8. See also Jer. xxxix. 10. Another captain of Nebuchadnezzar's host was called Rab Mag, Jer. xxxix. 3. His name is also found in the Assyrian inscriptions, as I have already stated in the article *Img a* (No. 148).\n\nThe name of Nebuzaradan in Hebrew letters will be \n\\[ \\text{\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05df} \\] from *semen*; \n\\[ \\text{\u05d3\u05b6\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8} \\] dedit. But admitting a Chaldee form \n\\[ \\text{\u05d3\u05b6\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05d8} \\] dedit (as in Marduk-bal-adan, and many other names), we obtain the name as it stands in the Hebrew text of the Bible, \n\\[ \\text{\u05e0\u05d1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d6\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05df} \\]; where \n\\[ \\text{\u05df} \\] stands for \n\\[ \\text{\u05d5\u05bc} \\], the final of which is lost by reason of the vowel \n\\[ \\text{\u05d0} \\] following.\n\n**165. Sanballat.** This is another very interesting Biblical name. Sanballat was a Moabite, very hostile to the Jews, in the time of Nehemiah (see Nehem. vi.). His name was, doubtless, written in the Cuneiform character \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udda0} \\], \n\"The Moon gave him life,\" or \"was his creator.\" I deduce this from two very similar names which occur in the inscriptions. One of these is *Nergal-ubullut* \n\\[ \\text{\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udcb5\ud808\udda0} \\], \n\"Nergal gave him life,\" or \"brought him into existence.\" He was one of the Eponyms, and is named in the Canon.\u20142 R 68, col. iii. line 38. The other name is *Nebo-bullat*\nI have already (in the article No. 151) given an example of the verb bullat (to give life), spelt in the same manner, from the ancient Annals printed in R 19, 81.\n\nCompare also the verb bullith (of the same meaning) which is found, 2 R 36, 18, in the praises of Ashurbanipal; \"whom Nebo and Ashur have brought into life as a King (Sar ubullitha su), and have always guarded his throne.\"\n\nThese two last etymologies (of Nebuzaradan and Sanballat) are as certain as they are simple. Those proposed by Gesenius and Furst are extremely wide of the truth in both cases. I do not impute it as a blame to them, for, before the recent rise of Assyrian studies, these and many other Chald\u00e6an names could not be interpreted.\n\n166. Atzib. \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0, a Stone set up as a Landmark, Monument, or Memorial.\u2014This word seems to have hitherto escaped recognition, perhaps from being disguised in the uncouth hieratic form of \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0. Or, it may have been confounded with \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dc, \"a field,\" Heb. \u05d0\u05b5\u05e7\u05d9\u05dc, which is written exactly in the same manner. Atzib is, however, a pure Hebrew word from the root \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 statuit, posuit; which is the same as \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0 (of same meaning). The latter verb, like most others beginning with N, loses that letter in its tenses and derivatives. Of this verb the Hiphil is etzib \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0, posuit, collocavit, erexit; ut columnam, Genes. xxxv. 20; altare, Genes. xxxiii. 20; monumentum, 1 Sam. xv. 12 (Gesenius). It especially marked a terminus or boundary of land (constituit fines\u2014Ges.), as in Deuter. xxxii. 8, authorised version\u2014\"The Most High set the bounds of the territory of the children of Israel.\" Here, \"he set\" is in the original text \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0. The principal derived word is matsiba \u05d9\u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d0, statua, monumentum, cippus. In the latter senses, cippus or monumentum, the word is also found in Ph\u0153nician monuments, of which Gesenius gives nine instances on monuments still extant, one of which is now preserved in a museum.\nat Oxford. Its translation is: \"I Abd-Osiria, son of &c. &c., have erected this memorial stone (matziba) to the memory of my wife, &c.\"\u2014[From Gesenius, Monumenta Phoenicia, p. 130.] But the Assyrians called a memorial stone Atziba, without the letter M. This, of course, is perfectly legitimate as a grammatical form. This was about 1150 B.C. It is but a slight change for so long an interval. We read in 2 Sam. xviii. 18\u2014\"Absalom during his lifetime set up a monument (izzeb matziba \u05d9\u05b4\u05d6\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9 \u05de\u05b7\u05e6\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05d1), which he called by his own name. And it is called even unto this day Id Absalom,\" \"the place of Absalom\" (authorised version).\n\nIn the Michaux stone, R70, col. ii. 7, we read: \"If any one in future days, for the purpose of destroying this memorial stone (ana tabul atzib suatu) shall deface (or fracture) this monument (itzatzu atzib suatu),\" &c. The sense of the word atzib is here unequivocal. It goes on at great length: \"Whoever shall deface the writing, and then write on it words of his own (ramani-su, line 12), or shall throw it into the river, or burn it with fire, or bury it in the earth, &c. &c., may he be accursed!\" All this applies to a monumental stone, and to nothing else. But it appears to me that \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0, in another part of the very same inscription, means \"a field,\" as it does in the later Assyrian inscriptions. I can only account for this by supposing that \"a field\" and the stone which marked it were so identified in popular opinion and language, that in speaking of the one, a person virtually implied the other also.\n\nThe sign \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 has the value Tzib in this and many other words, sometimes modified into Sib. It is also very frequently used for Lib.\n\n167. Nimiki. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0, the Gods.\u2014This important word occurs in Phill. i. 4, and again in E.I.H. i. 7, where it is spelt \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05d0. In these two passages Nebuchadnezzar has the following title of honour: Mustalam akhiz nimiki;\nPreserver of the possessions of the Nimiki. This phrase has not hitherto been explained. The most likely meaning seems to be \"Preserver of the possessions of the Gods, Priests, or Temples.\"\n\nI have found a passage which seems to prove that the Nimiki were the Gods. It occurs in 2 R 16, 65, where the P.C. words \"his god (and) his king\" are rendered by the Assyrian nimik-su bel-su. Here I would remark that \"a King\" is often rendered in P.C. by \"a Lord,\" and that both (ni and bi) stand frequently for \"his.\" It would seem to follow that Nimik means \"a god.\" Observe now how well this suits the passage in E.I.H.i.7, where \"Preserver of the possessions of the Nimiki\" is followed by \"sha aratti iluti-sun istinihu;\" \"he who increased the . . . . of their divinities.\" Since, therefore, they possessed divinity, the Nimiki were the gods. The other words in the phrase Mustalam akhiz Nimiki are easy of explanation. Mustalam, \"preserver,\" is the participle of the T conjugation of Salam, \"to preserve.\" Akhiz is the Heb. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d7\u05b4\u05d6\u05b5\u05c1\u05d9 \"possessio.\"\n\nSince writing the above, I have noticed the following passage in which nimiki occurs, and in which the sense of \"gods\" suits perfectly well. Opp. Exp. en M\u00e9s. p. 339 (Prayer of Sargon to his deity): Oh Lord of the Bright Eye (or bright face); Bel Nimiki; king of the gods. Patiku kal gimir; Creator of the universe: ana Sargina sar Ashur, &c. &c.; unto Sargina king of Assyria, grant every blessing! &c. &c.\n\nIn the above, Nin is \"Lord.\" is sometimes inu, \"the eye;\" sometimes pan, \"the face:\" it is a P.C. word. illu, means \"splendour, riches;\" therefore we may render nin pan illu \"lord of the bright face.\" The verb patik, \"to form,\" is frequent, ex.gr., eptik pitik-su; he formed its form. kal is the Heb. \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05dc \"all.\"\n\nM. Oppert remarks that the most usual name of the\ngod whom Sargina invokes in the preceding passage is\n\nThe point to which I wish to draw attention is, his title of Bel Nimiki, king of the gods. I have found another passage in 2 R 38, 51, in which the same god has the same title (slightly varied in the spelling) Belnu Nimigam. It will be remembered that Belnu is frequently used for Bel. As to the final am in nimigam it is like the title rabu nadam instead of nadu, and many others. I believe it was an emphatic pronunciation. With regard to the etymology of the word nimiki I think there can be no doubt that it meant the Mysterious Beings or Mysterious Powers, from the Heb. profundus, inexplicatus (Ges.), a term which is frequently used in speaking of the Deity, ex gr., Ps. xcii. 5: \"The thoughts of the Lord are very deep.\" \"He (the Lord) discovereth the secrets of the darkness.\"\u2014Job xii. 22. \"Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty's perfection? It is as high as heaven, what canst thou do? deeper than hell, what canst thou know?\"\u2014Job xi. 8. It is evident from these passages how suitable the word and its compounds were to furnish a designation worthy of the gods, and therefore my derivation of nimiki from that root is, I think, sufficiently probable.\n\nI will add an example in which nimiki does not mean the gods themselves, but their divine or mysterious nature. In 2 R 36, 19, there are praises of Ashurbanipal\u2014\"Sha Nabo u Ashur Sar ubullithu-su; whom Nabo and Ashur caused to be born a King (or, brought him into life, a King): itsuru sarrut-zu, and have been the guardians of his reign.\" It then goes on\u2014\"Nimiki sun bulku; I offer a sacrifice to their divine power (for the health of his life, the stability of his years, and the security of his royal throne).\" An unfortunate mutilation of the tablet obscures the sense of one or two other following phrases.\nN.B. Bulku \"sacrifice\" is given by Norris, p. 99. Ubullithu is from the verb bullith \"to give life.\" Itsuru from natsir \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8 \"to protect.\" Nimiki is here spelt as in E.I.H. i. 7 (see above).\n\nThe god bore the title (as we have seen) of \"king of the gods.\" But he was also Sar tzuab, \"king of the Abyss.\" This Tzuab (which answers in some respects to the mysterious \u03a9\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greeks) was the Sky\u2014the Heavenly Ocean\u2014the \"waters above the heavens\" of Genesis\u2014the \"Heavenly Nile\" of the Egyptian mythology\u2014a \"profound\" of endless depth\u2014the abode of the gods.\n\nIn 2 R 67, 81, the gods are called \"Children of the Abyss,\" binut tzuab. But was \"King of the Abyss,\" sar tzuab. Therefore, he must have been king of the gods, and, in fact, we find him so called. The mythology is, therefore, in accordance with itself. The gods of Greece were also the children of the \"Ocean:\" \u03c9\u03ba\u03b5\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd \u03c4\u03b5 \u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd . . . .\u2014Hom. Il. 201.\n\nIn the Syllabary 687, nr, and its plural , are rendered Ili, \"the gods.\" This is obscure, but I think it may be merely the initial letter of nimiki used for the whole word (a frequent usage).\n\nAnother example is found in R36, 38, where the same god is called Sar tzuab; Bel Nimiki. And another curious passage in which these words occur is the following: B.M. 43, 3, \"Ashurakhbal, irsu mudu, the wise king; khasitzu, the intelligence; parit, bringing forth; uzni nimiki, divine thoughts; sha, whom; , the god ; sar tzuab ilimanni, king of the heavenly abyss; ana isi, unto the . . . . . of the great gods of heaven and earth; as kini lib-su, on account of his noble soul; uduni su, has exalted him.\"\n\nHere note especially nimiki as an adjective 'divine,' and the epithet of the Abyss ilimanni 'heavenly.' himself was a divine khasitzu or 'Intelligence' (see R 27, 4, the invocation to the great gods on the Monolith). Therefore it is\nin that quality that Ashurakhbal here invokes him. The other words I will treat of elsewhere. *Uduni* seems 'he exalted, or rewarded;' compare *dunni zikruti*, 'the prize of valour.'\n\n168. **Abari.** \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e62\u0331, the Gods: the Celestials.\n\nThe prayer of Sargina to Ninev, to give him aid in war, was published by Oppert in his Exp. en M\u00e9s. p. 333. It begins: \"Ninev bel Abari; O Ninev, Lord of the Celestials!\" This translation is, in the first place, probable, because the very similar invocation of Sargina to the god \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e62\u0331 which I believe was found at the same time and place, begins: \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e2a\u0331 \u1e62\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e62\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e62\u0331 bel Nimiki; O divine (.....) King of the Gods!\" [see the last article].\n\nWhen, therefore, we find that in Hebrew poetry the word *Abari* signified 'the Deity,' the above-mentioned 'probability' becomes almost a certainty. The Hebrew word is *Abir \u05d0\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8*; the Deity is so called in Gen. xlix. 24, and Isaiah i. 24.\n\nThe sequel of the invocation increases the probability of this explanation. Ninev bel Abari, sha satsu dannut-su, ana Sargina sar Ashur, &c. &c.; O Ninev, Lord of the Celestials, whose pinnacle is lofty, unto Sargina, king of Assyria (grant every blessing)! &c.\n\n*Satsu \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e62\u0331* is the summit or pinnacle of a mountain; it has the same meaning as *Ubanat*, which it replaces frequently. Ninev was the Meridian Sun, as appears by many passages in the inscriptions. That the Meridian Sun occupies 'a lofty pinnacle' is a poetical image of self-evident truth, and 'Lord of the Celestials' is a natural and proper title for him.\n\n169. **Sahat.** \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e24\u0331 \u1e62\u0331, an Hour.\u2014Agrees with the Chald. \u05e0\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 emphat. \u05e0\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 Hora. \"I rode all night. I crossed the river Thurnat. I reached the city of Arastu at the hour of dawn.\"\u2014R 21, 53. In the version which I gave of this passage (Art. 67) I mistook this word. 'As bikhar sahati,' at the hour of dawn, is the Heb. \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea man\u00e8; prima lux.\n170. **Nisikti.**  \n\nPearls.\u20142 R 67, 28; where it is said they were offered to Tiglath Pileser II. by the tribes near the Persian Gulf. The epithet *binut tamti* (productions of the sea) proves them to be pearls. At the same time \u201cgold and silver of the country\u201d were offered; but the word (silver) has been misprinted in the lithograph published by the British Museum. I propose, therefore, to cancel the article *Ephar* (No. 102) which was founded entirely upon this passage. Such misprints add considerably to the difficulty of explaining these ancient records.\n\n171. **Inzabati.**  \n\nEarrings.\u2014\u201cInzabati sha uznu-sha; the earrings of her ears.\u201d\u2014Tablet 162. The Hebrew word corresponding is \u2018inauria,\u2019 an earring. But b and m are nearly the same in Assyrian.\n\n172. **Subibulti,** a Necklace (see Art. 91).\u2014I have since found the word *Subib* in the form \u2018a bracelet\u2019 in Buxtorf\u2019s Lex. p. 2304. This completes the evidence. The Assyrian word is a diminutive.\n\nCommentators have had great difficulty in explaining the article of female dress called *subisim* mentioned in Isaiah iii. 18. See Lowth on Isaiah, p. 250, who says he had consulted on this word the learned Dr. Hunt, professor of Hebrew and Arabic at Oxford, who could find nothing in the Arabic dictionaries that threw any light upon it. Now, if we suppose a very ancient error of a letter substituted for , the word was originally *Armilla*, which gives a very satisfactory sense, since one of the commentators, Aben Ezra, renders the word *subisim* \u2018ornaments of the legs,\u2019 of course merely from conjecture, the sense seeming to require that meaning.\n\nLowth himself says, p. 249, that this \u201cinventory as I may call it, of the wardrobe of a Hebrew Lady must from its obscurity have been peculiarly liable to the mistakes of tran-\nscribes.\u201d This remark of the learned Bishop justifies me in proposing the above emendation.\n\n\u00b6 The tablet 162, \u2018the jewels of the goddess Ishtar,\u2019 from which I have taken the two last words *inzabati* and *subibulti*, receives a very good illustration from Ezek. xvi. 11, where he describes Jerusalem under the image of a bride dressed out in all manner of splendid ornaments. I quote Lowth\u2019s translation, p. 251, of his work on Isaiah:\n\nAnd I decked thee with ornaments:\nAnd I put bracelets upon thine hand,\nand a chain on thy neck:\nAnd I put a jewel on thy nose,\nand earrings on thine ears,\nand a splendid crown upon thine head.\n\nThree of the lines correspond exactly to what we find written on the Assyrian tablet:\n\n| Subibulti sha tzuri-sha; | And a chain on her neck; |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------|\n| inzabati sha uznu-sha;    | and earrings on her ears; |\n| mir raba sha reshdu-sha.  | and a splendid crown upon her head. |\n\nThis close coincidence shows how familiar Ezekiel must have been with Chaldaean customs and modes of expression. He was nearly contemporary with this tablet; which may have been written about thirty years before his birth.\n\n\u00b6 I may add that I was not aware of the parallel passage in Ezekiel when I published my translation of this Assyrian tablet in June 1865, in the Trans. R.S.L. vol. 8. I mention this because some are still incredulous concerning Assyrian decipherment.\n\n173. **Mamitu.** \u1d48\u1e25 \u1d48\u1e25 \u1d48\u1e25 \u1d48\u1e25. I translated this word \u2018a Promise\u2019 in No. 49 of this Glossary. But it is more than a promise; it is an oath. It is derived from the Ch. and Syr. verb \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 *jurare*; whence *juramentum*, which is almost exactly the Assyrian *mamita*. I will give another example of the word. Tiglath Pilcer had taken prisoners all the kings of the Nahiri. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cI pardoned them;\nand I only bound them by an Oath on the great gods, for all future time to submit to my authority.\" Riema arsa sunuti; napishta-sun ekhir. Mamit ili rabi ana arkat tami, ana tamu zati, ana ardutti utami sunuti.\u2014Tig. v. 11\u201316.\n\nHere Mamit 'an oath,' is spelt \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3. Ardut is homage, prostration, submission; but I think that ardutti means 'submission to me;' the final i being equivalent to the possessive pronoun \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3. Utami \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 (or with \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 for the last letter) means 'I bound by an oath.' This is the same verb \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 juravit in the T conjugation. This usage is very frequent of coupling a verb to a substantive derived from it, as eptik pitik-su; ana zikipi uzikip, &c. &c.\n\nThe Greek \u1f41\u03bc\u03bd\u03cd\u03c9 Oath, root of \u1f41\u03bc\u03bd\u03c5\u03bc\u03b9, resembles the Chaldee and Syriac \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 adjuravit (which is a conjugation of \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3). And if so, perhaps the curious phrase \u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u1f40\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1, 'to swear friendship,' is not unconnected with the Semitic verb tami 'to bind by an oath,' which we have just been considering: \u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c4\u03ae\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u1f40\u03c1\u03ba\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2.\u2014Hom. II. \u03b3 73. Of course the notion of cutting up a sacrifice is also present in the phrase, which may, therefore, have had a mixed origin, partly indigenous, partly borrowed from the East.\n\n174. Shamami. \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3, the Heavens.\u2014Agrees entirely with the Heb. \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3.\u2014Genes. xv. 5.\n\nIshtar sarrat shamami; Ishtar queen of heaven.\u2014Tablet 100.\n\nItti (signs or wonders, Ch. \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3, Syr. \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3) \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 \u1f08\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039d\u039f\u03a5\u03a3 as shamami hakkari, [were seen] both in heaven and earth.\u2014Black stone of Esarhaddon, col. iii. 13.

Habir salimati, la adiru\ntukumti; loving peace, but not fearing war.\u2014Stand. inscr. l. 13.\n\nHabir otherwise is Ch. amicus.\n\n176. **Nigab.**, Supreme Lord (only in Egypt).\n\nIdi-Bi'il ana nigabuti as eli mat Musri askun; I raised Idi-Baal to the supreme authority over the land of Egypt.\u2014Inscr. Tig. Pil. II. 2 R 67, 56. Written\n\nThis is a very curious word. It represents, if I mistake not, the Assyrian pronunciation of the Egyptian word *N\u0113b*, \u2018a Lord,\u2019 which is of the most frequent occurrence in that language. It is also found in Coptic as *N\u03b7\u03b2*; which Tattam renders *\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b4\u03b5\u03c3\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2*, dominus (dict. p. 302). The Assyrians seem to have heard an aspiration in the middle of the word, as if it were *nihb* or *nihab*.\n\n177. **Nigab**, a Priest, or High Priest.\n\nI do not venture to consider this word the same as the last, because it has apparently no connection with Egypt. I am not sure that it meant \u2018high priest,\u2019 yet that may be the sense intended in a very difficult passage of the tablet 162, which I have published in the Transactions of the R.S.L. vol. 8, p. 252 and 294:\n\n1. Alik nigab! pitas-si babati!\n2. uppit-si ma kima panni labiruti!\n3. illik nigab iptas-si babati.\n\n1. Go Priest, and open the gates for her!\n2. And take a pledge from her as on former times!\n3. The Priest went, and opened the gates for her.\n\nFor, it appears from the sequel of the tablet that an oath was exacted from the queen, to return the jewels of the goddess which she borrowed.\n\nPita \u2018to open\u2019 is the Heb. \u05d4\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8\u05b0\u05ea\u05b8\u05bc. We find often in Botta\u2019s inscrs. pitie kirubi \u2018opened earth,\u2019 meaning wells sunk in the earth, or tanks to retain the rain-water against dry seasons. Pit\u00e1s-si, \u2018open to her!\u2019 not pitu-si, because the pronoun *si* being an enclitic, throws back the accent on the former word.\nExamples are very common, such as *pan\u00fas-su* \u2018to him;\u2019 *tsir\u00fas-sun* \u2018upon them,\u2019 &c. &c.\n\n*Uppit* \u2018a pledge,\u2019 Heb. verb and subst. Hiph. \u2018to take a pledge from one.\u2019 *Panni* \u2018times,\u2019 i.e. returning occasions, Lat. *vices*. Heb. \u2018to turn.\u2019\n\n178. **Patitsi** or **Patizi.**\n\nHigh Priest.\u2014This sacerdotal title remained in use for an immense length of time, from the days of Shems-Yem and Ismi-Dagon, eighteen centuries before Christ, until the time of Nebuchadnezzar and probably longer. Before there were kings at Nineveh that country was governed by high priests of Ashur, as is manifest from the following passage: \u201cThe temple of Anu and Yem which Shems-Yem, *Patitsi* of Ashur, son of Ismi-Dagon, who was also *Patitsi* of Ashur, in ancient times had made; that temple had fallen to decay.\u201d\u2014Tigl. vii. 60. And Nebuchadnezzar in the E.I.H. inscr. i. 5 gives himself the same title, viz. *Patitsi tsiri*, \u2018High Priest.\u2019 And it is spelt in the same way.\n\nI suspect that the Patizeithes of Herodotus is not a name but a title, viz. *Patizi* \u2018high priest.\u2019 We know that he was a Magian priest, and doubtless a man of high station, for he was Comptroller of the King\u2019s household when he revolted against Cambyses. And he is called by Ctesias \u2018Sphendadates,\u2019 which is not a name but a Zend title \u2018given to the Holy One;\u201d see Rawlinson\u2019s Herodotus, vol. 2, p. 456. Such a title would be nearly equivalent to \u2018High Priest.\u2019\n\n179. **Nuab.**\n\nVicegerent, vicar, substitute.\u2014This is the Arabic *Naib*, deputy, substitute, lieutenant; superl. *Nuab*, viceroy (Gilchrist\u2019s Vocabulary, p. 81). Schindler writes the word in Hebrew letters \u05e0\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05d1 Naib, and renders it \u2018substitutus, delegatus, prorex,\u2019 and derives it from the Arab. root \u05e0\u05b8\u05d0\u05b7\u05d1 \u2018substituit, posuit in suo loco,\u2019 p. 1084.\n\n*Sargina,* thus boastfully commences an inscription (R36, 1): Sargina saknu Bel, nuab nahit Ashur; *Sargina the Viceroy of Bel, the glorious Vicegerent of Ashur* . . . . . .\nSimilarly Nebuchadnezzar boasted to be \"the mortal Image of Marduk\" (see Art. Bila, No. 160). And similarly the successors of Mahomet took the title of Caliphs, i.e. his Substitutes or Vicegerents, from the Arab. Caliph \u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 successor in locum alterius, vicem gessit.\u2014Sch. Even the present Sultan of Turkey has for one of his titles 'the shadow of God.'\n\n180 Saknu. \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e2ba, a Viceroy; a Lieutenant of the great King.\u2014Istakkan Saknuti [over all those lands] he placed Lieutenants or Viceroys.\u2014Botta 16, 27. This word has the sign of 'rank' or 'class' prefixed \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e2ba.\n\nSaknu Bel, Viceroy of Bel, was a title of Sargina (see the preceding article). Botta's inscriptions often read Sakan Bel \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e2ba instead of Saknu Bel. The Chaldee Sagan \u03c3\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd is nearly related to the Assyrian Sakan, for Gesenius interprets \u03c3\u03ac\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd Vicarius (principis), and thence Praetor, Praefectus provinciae, quoting Ezra ix. 2, &c. &c.\n\n181 Pakhati. \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba, Chief Magistrates, Prefects, Governors.\u2014Agrees entirely with the Heb. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea plur. of \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b0\u05d7 otherwise dux, princeps. They were divided into two classes, akli and shapiri (perhaps 'greater' and 'smaller').\u2014Opp. Khors. line 178.\n\n182 Nam. \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba, a kind of Head Dress denoting high rank.\u2014In 2 R 25, 21 \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba Nam Belna is explained Agie billuti, crowns of lordship (or high rank). And in the next line \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba Nam alik pani is explained Agie sarti, crowns of royalty. Alik pani means 'a Leader, General, or Sovereign'; it is literally 'one who goes first,' from alik, Heb. \u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0 'to go,' and pani, Heb. \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd 'before.' It is a very common title. In the P.C. language it is generally rendered \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba because \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba answers to the Assyrian pani, and \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba (to go) is in Assyrian alik. From this word \u1e62\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e2ba nam 'a head dress or coronet,' we easily see why an Assyrian governor or other nobleman was usually called a bel nam\nThis means 'possessing the Nam,' having the right to wear it; decorated.\n\nOther examples of the word: In the fifth line of the Obelisk the god has the title Musim 'crowned with crowns,' or 'bestower of crowns;' and in line 14, which closes the invocation, all the great gods are collectively called Musimu musarbu sarruti-ya, 'those who have crowned me with crowns, and have established my royal power.' Similarly in Ashurakbal's invocation, R 27, line 3 (which is misprinted) the god Anu is called Musim 'giver of divine crowns.' But this title, though shared by the other gods, chiefly belonged to (pronounced possibly Bita), insomuch that it coalesced with his name, and he was called Bita-bel-nam, Bita lord of crowns. On the stone of Zaaleh a simple individual, one of the witnesses, has the name Arda-Bita-belnam, servant of Bita-belnam.\n\n183. Namut. The distinction of wearing the Nam (see the preceding article).\n\nSha eli gimir mati-sun sutrin-su ana namuti istakkan, who placed his officers over all their lands, giving them the distinction of the Nam. , in another passage without the vowel.\u2014Botta 40, 24, and 36, 17, quoted by Norris, p. 459.\n\n184. Nebushasban. A Chaldean Proper Name.\u2014It is one of great interest, being mentioned by the prophet Jerem. xxxix. 13. \"So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, and Nebushasban .......and all the king of Babylon's princes; even they sent and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison.\" The Hebrew text of the Bible has .\n\nOf this name Gesenius and Furst give different etymologies, taken from Persian and Sanskrit, and altogether inadmissible. The meaning of the name is to be sought in the Semitic languages. I have already stated in Articles 164 and 165 that the Assyrian gives the most simple and natural meaning to these\nnames. It is easy to see the meaning of Nebushasban in Assyrian, but I did not give it in Art. 165 because at that time I had not met with the name in the Assyrian records.\n\nNebu-shazib-ani means 'Nebo save me!' This verb occurs under the form suzib anni \\( \\text{preserve me!} \\) in the inscription of Nabonidus ii. 20. Recently, however, Mr. G. Smith has discovered the name of Nebo-sezib-ani on a tablet in the British Museum. This Assyrian name was given as a compliment to the son of Pharaoh Necho I, king of Egypt, at that time a subordinate king of the city Athribis, but who afterwards apparently ascended the throne of Egypt by his native name of Psametik I (see G. Smith in Lepsius Zeitschrift, p. 96).\n\n185. **Yami.** \\( \\text{the Sea.} \\)\u2014Agrees exactly with the Heb. \\( \\text{if pronounced as Yum.} \\) This word, as Norris has pointed out (dict. p. 467), occurs 2R43, 59, where it is made synonymous with \\( \\text{and} \\), both of which signify 'the sea;' see also 2R41, 45.\n\n186. **Khibishti.** \\( \\text{Roofing Beams.} \\)\u2014Tie beams. Heb. \\( \\text{ligavit, superalligavit, superimposuit, clausit, compegit (Sch.).} \\) Botta 46, 59, \"I laid its roof with khibishti of the land of Khamana (Mount Hermon).\" These were always of fine cedar wood.\n\n187. **Mudu.** \\( \\text{Wise, Intelligent, Skilful, Cunning.} \\)\u2014This word is probably the participle of the Heb. \\( \\text{'to know.'} \\)\n\nIrsu mudu, the wise king [whose mind is full of divine thoughts inspired by the god Bita].\u2014B.M. 43, 3. Compare this with B.M. 41, 20: \"Then I, Sennacherib asharaddan malki, the first of kings, mudie miri kala ma, who understand fine works of every kind [made great figures of Lions such as no king before me ever had made. And with the profound thoughts which the god Bita gave me I formed a plan in my own mind how to execute this great work]. I have abridged a little.\nHere mudie is written \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e9\u05b7\u05c1\u05e8\u05b0\u05d3\u05b8\u05df \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05d5\u05bc} \\). I have translated asharaddan malki \u2018first of kings,\u2019 since the phrase occurs elsewhere undoubtedly in that sense; but I should not be surprised if it meant here \u2018first of artificers or planners\u2019 from the Syr. and Chald. verb \\( \\text{\u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05da\u05b8} \\) malak, \u2018to take counsel,\u2019 especially since that verb occurs directly afterwards (l. 25), ana epish miri suatu rabish amtallik (which is the T conjugation of malak \u2018to consult\u2019), and perhaps again in the same line, \u2018in milik-ya,\u2019 written \\( \\text{\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8} \\).\n\nI translate kala ma \u2018every kind\u2019 because I think it is the same phrase which is found in the name of one of the Palaces. Haikal pakidat kala mu, the Palace of protection of every kind, i.e. in which every kind of useful thing is stored up or cared for [as was in fact the case, for it comprised all manner of public offices and departments]. See Esarhaddon vi. 26 for this name of the palace.\n\n188. Tila. Life, or Health.\u2014In Art. 38 I considered the phrase \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d6\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d5\u05bc} \\) ana ti zi-su, \u2018for the health of their lives,\u2019 and I said \u201cthe word ti is perhaps the abbreviation of some longer word.\u201d I have since found that it stands for Tila, used apparently in the sense of \u2018health.\u2019 The following passage seems decisive on that point; it occurs in a prayer for the prosperity of King Ashurbanipal, 2 R36, 20. \u201cI sacrifice to the gods \\( \\text{\u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05dc\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d6\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e1\u05d5\u05bc} \\) ana tila zi-su, \u2018pro salute vita suae.\u2019\n\nAnother example is found in R6, No. 7, where Sargina builds a temple, \u2018ana tila-su,\u2019 pro salute su\u00e2; dimu zir-su, the tranquillity (or security) of his race; tsidiki sha Ashur-ki, the just government of Assyria; salam Ashur-ki, and its safety.\n\n189. Mitinna. \\( \\text{\u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0} \\), a Gift.\u2014Agrees entirely with the Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9\u05df\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u2018a gift.\u2019 Mitinna was the name of a king of Tyre who paid tribute to Tiglath Pileser II, see 2R67, 66. His full name was doubtless Mitinna-Bel, \u2018gift of Bel;\u2019 but we see by many instances that names were shortened\nin common parlance by omitting the name of the god, or in some other way. Thus we have Zabd\u0101n which, spoken full, was probably Nebo-zab-dan, 'Nebo has given a warrior.' Elsewhere (R 41, 23) we have Umman-minan, king of the Susians, addressed by an ambassador simply as \"King Umman!\" And so also if I am not mistaken, Ahaz, king of Judah, had in his youth been called Jeho-ahazi (Jehovah is my possession); see Art. 135. And so Nigas (probably for Khumba-nigas) is the name of a foreigner on the Zaaleh stone.\n\n190. Mitinti. \\( \\text{Mitinti} \\), a Gift.\u2014This is another form of the last word. Sometimes the first letter is \\( \\text{Mitinti} \\). Mitinti king of Ashdod is named in R38, 51. He submitted to Sennacherib, and was rewarded with several cities taken from Hezekiah; see R39, 24. He probably rendered still further services to the Assyrians, for in the days of Esarhaddon we find that he was king of Ascalon (R48, 4).\n\nMitinti is probably a contraction of Mitinti-Bel 'gift of Bel.' Another form of this name Nidinta-Bel is found in the Behistun inscription, l. 34. The root is natan \\( \\text{natan} \\) 'to give.'\n\n191. Rabshakeh. \\( \\text{Rabshakeh} \\). And the king of Assyria sent ..... Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah ..... Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews' language .....\u20142 Kings xviii. The above is one of the most familiar passages of scripture. Schindler and Gesenius explain the name Rabshakeh by 'princeps pincernarum,' that is 'Chief Butler, or Cupbearer.' By a curious coincidence when Tiglath Pileser II. sent an envoy to Mitinna king of Tyre to demand tribute (2 R67, 66) he says: \"I sent an officer who was a Rabshak to the city of Tyre.\" The verb employed is \\( \\text{ashbur} \\) 'I sent an Envoy.'\n\nI feel some doubt about Rabshakeh being the 'Chief Butler.' The meaning seems incongruous, for why should a 'chief butler' be the chosen envoy in two instances? Some light is thrown upon it by the gloss in 2 R31, 34, which explains 'the rank of Rab-sak,' or \\( \\text{by 'the rank of'} \\). The\nlatter word appears in the glosses to have the meaning 'illustrious.' There was a great temple of \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2. Here it may be observed that \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 sak signifies 'head or chief' in P.C. hence \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 would be 'great chief' or 'distinguished nobleman.' Such a meaning is much more probable than 'chief butler.'\n\nIn the story of Joseph (Genes. xl.) the 'chief butler' has a very different name, Sar ha-meshkim \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05e8 \u05d4\u05b7\u05de\u05b0\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05e7\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd.\n\nAgain we find \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 Sakku explained \u1f08\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 Barra in 2 R 36, 3. And the latter word (which is often reduced to its first sign) signifies 'chief' or 'first.' Hence Rab-Sak would be 'great Prince.'\n\n192. Chedorlaomer. A celebrated king of Elam in the days of Abraham (Gen. xiv.).\u2014Many conjectures have been offered respecting this name. The first part of the name is written \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8 in the Hebrew text of Genesis. I think it is the Assyrian Kudur, and that it probably means 'King.' There was an ancient king Kudur-mabuk whose inscription is given in R, pl. 2. His name seems to mean 'King,' with an unknown adjective added. This kudur seems to represent the Arabic \u0643\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0631 'potens,' whence \u0643\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0631 and \u0643\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0631 kadir 'potens,' \u0643\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0631 kudra 'power' (Schindler). Gilchrist's Vocabulary, p. 210, has qudur 'rank, dignity, greatness;' qadir 'powerful;' al-qadir 'the Almighty' [hence the name of the celebrated Arab chief Abd-el-Kader, 'servant of the Almighty']; qudir 'powerful, Almighty;' qudrut 'power, omnipotence, providence;' qudruti adj. 'divine.'\n\nSupposing, then, that this is the meaning of the first part of the name, let us go on to the remainder. The name is written in the Greek version of the LXX \u03a7\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1: in the Vulgate Chodorlahomor. Admitting (from what has been said) that the first part is \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8, the name will be \u05db\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8 with the epithet \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1. Now this adjective lo-gomor is pure Assyrian, la-gamar 'living for ever.' I have shown in Art. 160 that la-gamar in Assyrian answers to nu-bila 'everlasting' in P.C. and that one of the principal gods had the title of Aga-nu-bila\nking living for ever.' This translation is repeated three times in the plate 2 R13, so there can be no doubt of its correctness. The pompous title of Kudur-la-gamar 'king living for ever' is in accordance with the inflation of Oriental style. See for instance the book of Daniel. 'Then spake the Chald\u00e6ans to the king in Syriac, 'O king live for ever!' Even at the present day the Shah of Persia is styled 'Centre of the universe!' and the Sultan of Turkey, 'Shadow of God!'\n\nIn the same passage of Genesis is named \"Tidal king of nations.\" This name is admitted to be incorrect. The LXX have \u0398\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb. It appears to me that this name can be well represented by the Assyrian \u1e6car-gal 'great Chief,' a title very similar to \u1e6cartan, and having the same meaning.\n\nIn the same passage is named Amraphel king of Shinar. Shinar or \u03a3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1 is rendered Ba\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 by the LXX and \u03b3\u03b7 Ba\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. The meaning of the name is uncertain. Gesenius says \"Origo latet.\" Nevertheless I think it probable that it means 'the two rivers' or Mesopotamia, since it was the level alluvial plain between the Tigris and Euphrates. From the Heb. \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9 or \u05e9\u05b5\u05c1\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9 'two' and \u05e0\u05b8\u05d4\u05e8 'a river,' \u03a3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1\u03c1. [I have since found myself anticipated in this conjecture by Professor Rawlinson in Smith's dict. of the Bible.]\n\nSibuta, \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea, otherwise Sabuta \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea, Old Age.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Chald. \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea 'senectus, canities,' which is also written \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea. Schindler says that \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea denotes a more advanced old age than \u05d0\u05b4\u05d9\u05e1\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea. The latter term is applied to a man 60 years old, while \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea denotes (just\u0101 Hebr\u00e6os) an age of 70 years. But it is evident that this is a mere Hebrew fancy, resting only on the resemblance between \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05d1\u05b8\u05ea and the word \u05e9\u05b6\u05c1\u05d1\u05b7\u05e2 'seven.' This numeral takes the vowel i in Assyrian (see Siba 'seven,' No. 196).\n\nExamples of this word.\u2014In R15, 54 the king celebrates the praises of his ancestor Ashur-dayan (whose name signifies\n'Ashur is judge') and he says of him that his piety endeared him to the gods, so that he attained unto gray hairs and old age; 'sabuta u labiruta illiku.' A very similar phrase occurs in the prayer which terminates Sargina's long inscription, Opp. Khors. line 191, where, speaking of the Divine Bulls whose images carved in stone guarded his Palace, he says: 'Kibit\u00fas-su, by their divine will, or power; malku banu-sun, may the King who made them; sibuta lillik, attain to a very old age.' In both these examples the substantive is governed by the same verb alik Heb. \u05d0\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05da\u05b0. The following phrase, or one very like it, occurs at the end of many inscriptions, ex.gr. R66, 49. 'Bit ebusu; lala-sha lusbim! In Babilam in kirbi-su sibuta luksut!' (spelt \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9) 'I have made this building; may its glory endure! In Babylon, within it, may I reach old age!'\n\nThe word sibuta is derived from \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 or \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 cannit, consenuit: otherwise written \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 or \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5. When used as a substantive this word is rendered 'senex septuagenarius' by Schindler. As a verb, it appears in one of the oldest inscriptions, that of Khammurabi. That ancient king built a Castle, and he concludes his inscription with a prayer that it may 'last for many ages,' or perhaps 'grow old in glory,' in kibrati lu-shaib!\n\nIn an invocation to the goddess Beltis, 2R66, 5, she is called \"Queen of war and battle, 'sha balu-sha as bit-khira sibthu val imagaru,' whose power in Heaven old age will never destroy!\" Here I have conjecturally rendered Bit Khira 'Heaven.' The parallel passage in the other invocation to Beltis, quoted by Norris, dict. p. 91, has 'bal\u00fas-su as shamami' \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd 'her power in Heaven.'\n\nImagaru is the Chald. magar \u05de\u05b7\u05d2\u05b5\u05bc\u05e8 'to destroy.'\n\nSibu: \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 \u05dc\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05d1\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2\u05b0\u05ea\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9, a Grandfather.\u2014This word is evidently derived from the last, viz. Sib (old); Sibut (old age). Heb. \u05e1\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05d5 'Senex,' see Job xv. 10. \u05e9\u05b4\u05c2\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 and \u05e9\u05b4\u05c2\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4 'gray hairs.' \"If mischief befal him, then shall ye bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.\" Genes. xlii. 38, sibut-ya 'my gray hairs' \u05e9\u05b4\u05c2\u05d9\u05d1\u05b8\u05d4.\nA good example of the word is found in 2 R32, 10, where it occurs among many similar phrases: ana sibuti-su, to his grandfather. The meaning is well ascertained by the preceding phrases, viz. \u2018to his child; to his son; to his brother; to his father; to his grandfather;\u2019 all which are rendered into Proto-Chaldaean in the opposite column. The P.C. for \u2018grandfather\u2019 is Abba.\n\n195. Sibta. a Grandmother.\u2014Feminine of the last word. It occurs in a gloss in 2 R32, 65 (unfortunately partly broken), which, compared with the following, shows that Sibta is equivalent to Umma raba or Grandmother. It is also made equivalent to \u2018mother,\u2019 followed by the epithet sik or sak, which is perhaps an abbreviation of the Heb. zagina \u2018old.\u2019\n\n196. Siba. Seven.\u2014The same with the Heb. In 2 R19, 14 the numeral is rendered Siba. So also in 66 of the same plate (in a different phrase). And in the first line of Bellino\u2019s inscription we find \u2018arkhi sibuti\u2019 in the seventh month. And on tablet K 1, last line, tam sibutti, day the seventh.\n\n197. Sabbi. , the name of one of the Assyrian Deities.\u2014The inscription of Tiglath Pileser and several others commence with a list of the principal gods of Assyria, generally about twelve or fourteen in number. In one of these lists the name of Sabbi occurs, on the unpublished tab. 100, otherwise 73a. This is a proof of his high rank in the celestial hierarchy. In the tablet K, 255 his name occurs coupled with that of the god Anu. The tablet K, 252 contains a copious list of the families of the gods. From such lists as these the ancient Greeks may have borrowed some ideas, and we may see in them the first germ of Hesiod\u2019s Theogonia. In this tablet Sabbi stands conspicuously at the head of his family, who are named in a compartment of eight lines, the last line of which is \u2018Ili sha bit Sabbi,\u2019 these are the gods of the house of Sabbi. In the name of this god, the number seven stands conspicuous (see the\npreceding article). I have suggested in the Trans. R.S.L. that he may have ruled specially over the seven planets, and that his worship may have been connected with that of Sabazius, an Oriental deity. It may be remembered also that the worshippers of Dionysus gave him the mystical title of \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 and shouted during the orgies \u0395\u03c5\u03bf\u03b9 \u03a3\u03b1\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9!\n\n198. Surmat. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 \u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, Rebellion.\u2014Heb. \u05e1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u2018rebellious,\u2019 related to \u05e1\u05b0\u05e8\u05b5\u05d9 \u2018to rebel\u2019 (Furst\u2019s lex.). \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 \u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d0\u05b2\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05e9\u05c1 surmat-zu, I forgave his rebellion (Opp. Khors. pl. 6, l. 51). Amish \u2018purgavi\u2019 is the Arabic verb \u064a\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0633\u0650\u062d\u064f \u2018purgare.\u2019 The Hebrew has not the verb, but has the derived substantive \u05d9\u05b8\u05e8\u05b7\u05e2 \u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u2018purgatio.\u2019\u2014Ges.\n\n199. Sumila. \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3, the Left Hand (see Art. 46).\u2014The present spelling is an important variation. The sign \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 though its normal value is Ku, is frequently to be read Su. In R42, 53 Sennacherib speaks of his palace. After mentioning the gates he says \u201cI made noble figures of the divine bulls formed of stone from the province of Balada, and I set them on the right side and on the left.\u201d \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 Imna u sumila [ushazbit eisa-shin]. The conjunction \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 (and) is misprinted \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 in the lithographed text. In writing the sign \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 Su it sometimes happened that the broad ends of the horizontal wedges coalesced at their points, and thus formed a continuous line. In this manner the sign \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 became \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 or at least not easily distinguishable from it; and thus, if I mistake not, the scribes got into the habit of writing \u05d9\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05d3 for Su in certain words.\n\n200. Karaz, a Proclamation.\u2014\u201cUseful works . . . . such as purifying the river, and digging wells for the use of the citizens, they (the kings my ancestors) never thought of doing, nor ever issued such decrees.\u201d Passages similar to this, but varying slightly in the expressions employed, abound in the inscriptions. Val ustabil karaz-zu, they never made proclamation. Karaz is the Ch. \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b8\u05d6 \u2018proclamavit.\u2019 From hence is derived the substantive \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b8\u05d6 karuz \u2018praeco\u2019 a Crier. This karuz is the origin of the Greek \u039a\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03be \u2018a herald\u2019 or \u2018public crier,\u2019 of which the Doric\nform Kapu\u0161 was probably the original one. Equally interesting is the verb ustabil, which is associated with karaz-su. This is the istaphel or ST conjugation of the verb \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, and \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc is 'to make proclamation by sound of trumpet.' Such proclamation was the \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc or \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc yubil so familiar to us in English and German under the form Jubil.\n\nIn 2 R 43, 42 \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc ustabilu karaz-su merely means 'he gave orders,' viz. to create a library of useful knowledge, by inscribing the clay tablets, of which so many fragments have been found. This passage makes me doubt whether karaz-su is not rather the Heb. \u05e7\u05e8\u05d0 'to speak aloud; to command;' so that karat would be a substantive meaning a 'command.' This verb is related to \u05db\u05e8\u05d9 though beginning with a different letter. The LXX renders both of them by \u03ba\u03b7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd. In Bellino line 41 the word ustabil is written \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc where \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc bil replaces \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc bi lu.\n\n201. Sharut. \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc Dibbu sharut isthur iznik ib(ri); Tablets of instruction he wrote, &c. &c.\u20142 R 43, 42. This phrase often occurs. The usual spelling is sarrut \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc \u05d9\u05d5\u05d1\u05dc, see No. 7.\n\n202. Lagamar. A deity of the Susians, named, with many others, on the tablets of Ashurbanipal.\u2014This word suggests a different explanation of the name of king Kudur-lagamar (Chedorlaomer) from that which I gave in Art. 192. Perhaps it is a purely Susian name, meaning Servant or Worshipper of the god Lagamar. Similar names were borne by two other kings, Kudur Nakhundi, and Kudur-Mabuk. This meaning of the word kudur in the language of Elam is, however, merely conjectural, and based on the analogy of names in other languages, as Abdallah, Abd-Istarte, Abed-Nebo, Shemesh-Bar (servant of Bar), &c. &c.\n\n203. Salam, Peace.\u2014The following passage was omitted in Art. 175. In Opp. Khors. 10, 90 the king of Ashdod rebels against Sargina, who subdues him and makes Akhimiti, his brother, king in his\nstead. But the people of Ashdod refuse to receive him, and elect as their king a native of the province of Yaman, who had no right to the throne (la bel guza). Then follows (line 97) \"In sukhat libbi-ya, in the vigour of my heart; gigir ummani-ya val upakkhir, I assembled no army; val akzura karasi, I collected no baggage; itti kuradi-ya, but with my soldiers; sha ashar salmi itti-ya la ipparku, who in time of peace had not quitted my standards; ana ir Ashdudi allik, I marched to the assault of Ashdod.\" These soldiers were his body-guard, who were never disbanded.\n\nAshar salmi 'loco pacis' used for 'tempore pacis.' Itti 'standards,' Ch. 'signum militare,' which the scribes often confused with manus, because 'troops' and 'standards' are cognate ideas. But, if preferred, we can translate \"who had not quitted my side.\"\n\nDapinu. a Physician.\u2014Oblique case. The king named had apparently been attacked by an illness. The magistrates of the cities raised a statue to the god Nebo, imploring him to send health to the king. The inscription on the statue is given in R35, No. 2. It begins: \"Ana Nebu dapini, unto Nebo the physician [we dedicate this statue].\" The word is explained as follows in the gloss 2 R48, 50:\n\nthe god Dapinu [means] 'ilu tarpa utdu-a, the god who heals by means of salubrious springs.' Tarpa 'the healer,' 'the physician,' seems a verbal substantive from the Heb. rapa 'sanavit.' Utdu-a 'a spring of water' is very common. The Romans were excessively fond of using medicinal springs; it now appears that the Assyrians had also discovered their virtues and efficacity. In the word Dapin I believe the final N is merely formative, as in many other Hebrew words (see Gesenius). The root is the Arab. medicina, which Schindler transcribes tab, whence 'to heal' and medicus. This Arab.\nis, I suppose, of the same origin with Heb. \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05dd or \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e8\u05b5\u05d0\u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05d9\u05dd 'bonus;' 'to do good' to a sick person might be used for 'to heal.' This gloss about 'medical waters' will, perhaps, enable us to go further in explaining this inscription, R35, No. 2. The word shakie follows. Ana Nebo dapini shakie; perhaps this means [Lord of] medicinal draughts, from the Heb. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05d1\u05b6\u05e5 'potus' a draught.\u2014Ps. 102, Hosea ii. Nebo is next called tarbit sakkil, which I think may mean learned and wise. Tarbit generally means 'educated;' here I would say 'learned.' Sakkil is the Ch. \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 or \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 sapiens, intelligens.\n\nThe Talmud uses \u03b4\u03b1\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7 for the Greek \u03b4\u03b1\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7 a bay tree. I think there may be some connection, because Ph\u00e6bus was a skilful physician, \u1f51\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2, says Aristophanes. Indeed he was the same as \u03a0\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c9\u03bd, who was the great physician of the gods. It is possible that a branch of the \u03b4\u03b1\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7 hung out indicated the abode of a physician.\n\nDapinu in 2R31, 70 stands opposite to emamu, but the two columns are independent and unconnected lists of verbs, and both are in Assyrian.\n\n205. Nu-bila (see Articles 159, 160).\u2014I will here add some further evidence. In 2R18, 19 we see that the P.C. monogram means a 'sale' or 'bargain,' in Assyrian simu. And we find the monogram used in that sense on the Michaux stones. Now when this monogram is followed by bila it is explained in Assyrian by simu gamru, 'a sale which will cease,' or 'a temporary sale.' But when it is followed by nu-bila it is explained simu la gamru 'a sale which is for ever.'\n\n206. Enuma. \u03b5\u1f30\u03bd\u03b1\u03af, adv. When.\u2014Appears to agree exactly with the Arab. \u0644\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0651\u0627 enma (cum, quando). Enuma haikal s\u00e1tu ilabbiru innakhu, when this palace shall grow old and decay.\u2014Bell. 1. 63. Enuma, &c. &c. When Ashur-danin-a, in the days of Salmanubar his father, raised an insurrection, &c. &c.\u2014R32, 39. I will add a curious passage from tab. 173, in which\nthe word occurs four times without any variation of spelling, and its meaning admits of no doubt:\n\n1. Enuma tallaku urukh-ka,\n2. enuma tibbiru naru Khubur,\n3. enuma tallaku tsir,\n4. enuma tazakkibu bula,\n\nWhen thou goest thy way.\nwhen thou crossest the river Khubur,\nwhen thou goest beyond (i.e. the Sea).\nwhen thou.........\n\nN.B. I have omitted several intermediate lines.\n\nIn the above, tallaku is twice spelt ; tibbiru nearly as in Art. 55, which see. Tsir is written , which frequently means \u2018beyond,\u2019 and is used as a preposition. Going \u2018beyond the Sea\u2019 is meant, for a mention of \u2018ships\u2019 follows.\n\nBilat. , Tribute.\u2014Agrees with the Ch. Ex.gr. \u201cBilat of the kings of Syria and of the kings of Aram\u00e6a and Chald\u00e6a.\u201d\u20142 R 67, 74 (the first have the title sarini, the others only malki). Sometimes spelt , ex.gr. Bilat mada, the great tribute.\u2014Phill. iii. 21. bilat-zun kabitti, their abundant tribute.\u2014Phill. iii. 53. Irsu bilati , they lifted the tribute (i.e. they were carriers of it from Jerusalem to Nineveh).\u2014R39, 33. natar bilti, to pay tribute.\u2014Opp. Khors. 10, 90. Bilut u mandatta, tribute and presents.\u2014R46, 58 (spelt ).\n\nbilat, tribute; mati u tamati, of land and sea; 2 R 67, 85.\n\nTila. (verb), to give Life.\u2014We have already had the substantive (see Art. 130). The verb is seen in the name of an ancient king of Assyria Ashur-utila (Ashur gives life), 2 R 65, 8. Ubullat is a similar verb, whence the names of the Eonyms, Nergal-ubullat (Nergal gives life), 2 R 68, 38, and Im-ubullat (Im gives life), 2 R 69, No. 3 obv. Both the Sun and Moon were life-giving powers, see the art. Sanballat, No. 165, and the following passage: That man, may the Sun give him life! 2 R 18, 55. Here the P.C. version has Life.\nLakhari, Tranquillity.\u2014I think this word is the contrary of khari \u2018disturbance\u2019 (whence takhari \u2018battle\u2019), but I am not sure about it.\n\nKima zudinni khu nigitsi, like frightened zudinni birds; ipparsu, they flew away; ashar la hari, to a place that was undisturbed; R37, 18. Spelt .\n\nThe word is also found in the name of one of the Eonyms (2R68, No. 2 obv.), Dimu u lakhar (probably pronounced Dimu-lakhar), meaning \u2018Peace and Tranquillity.\u2019 The word Dimu is very frequent in the sense of \u2018peace\u2019 or \u2018repose,\u2019 especially when prayers are offered up for the health of the king and the dimu or \u2018repose\u2019 of his family (see the art. Dimu, No. 139).\n\noften means \u201cand.\u201d When so used, Norris transcribes it adi (dict. p. 84). I believe he is right, but (u) was probably substituted in reading the name as more euphonious.\n\n\u201cPeace and Tranquillity.\u201d As the Eonym gave his name to the year, he may have adopted this name during his year of office, boni ominis caus\u00e2. His real name may have been quite different, and perhaps was thought unsuitable or unlucky.\n\nIzmi, Power.\u2014Heb. (same meaning). As izmi sha Uramazda, by the power of Oromasdes. This phrase occurs continually in the Behistun inscription. The meaning of the word is well shown in the name of an Eonym in 2R69, No. 4 obv. Khiga-izmi-bitkhira, who is named again in pl. 68, No. 1 reverse, but this time the word izmi is changed for rubu, \u2018king\u2019 or \u2018powerful chief.\u2019 I translate the name, \u201cGood is the King of heaven,\u201d meaning Ashur. Compare many other similar names, especially a Babylonian one on the Mich. stone, Khiga-sab-Marduk (Marduk is the good king).\n\nSalmanubar. , the celebrated \u2018Obelisk King.\u2019\u2014He is called Salmanubar by Rawlinson (Herod. Vol. 1, p. 462). With less probability he is named by Norris and Oppert, Shalmaneser.\n\nI have in vain (until lately) sought for any evidence in cor-\nroboration of either of these names, but I now find, on comparing two lists of Eonyms in 2 R, pl. 68 that the same man is called San-callim-ani (the Moon is my saviour) in one list, and in the other. Now and are variants of the same word, as appears by numerous examples in the lists of Eonyma. Consequently must have the value sallim and the meaning \u2018to save\u2019 or \u2018to give peace or rest.\u2019 Another very similar example is found in the name of the Eonym (see 2 R, pl. 69). Marduk-sallim-ani, which in another column is written , showing that is equivalent to sallim. Accepting this new value of , the name of the Obelisk King will become Salimma-nubar, or Salma-nubar, somewhat (though slightly) resembling Salmaneser. Another argument tending in the same direction may be stated thus:\u2014The setting of the Sun, which may be considered as his \u2018repose\u2019 or \u2018rest,\u2019 is called in Assyrian both salam shemsi and dimu shemsi (see Art. Dimu, No. 139). Here we have the same equivalence as before of the syllable and salim.\n\n212. Ashur-danin-ani. (Ashur strengthen me!), name of an Eonym in 2 R68, 16. The same person is called in l. 36 of another column Ashur-danin-anni, changing into . These two words had, therefore, the same meaning. If we compare this name with that of Ashur-danin-a, the rebellious son of Salmanubar (R 32, 39), it will appear, I think, probable that the last sign is not to be read bal (a son) but a (me), a pronoun equivalent to ani. The pronoun is very common. Ashur-danin-a is \u2018Ashur strengthen me!\u2019\n\nAn Eonym in l. 7 of same plate 68 has the analogous name Nebo-danin-ani (or anni in l. 27 of another column).\n\n213. Ashur-shazban. , 2 R 68, No. 2 obv. l. 26. This proper name of an Eonym, meaning\n\u2018Ashur save me!\u2019 is worth notice, as illustrating and confirming the account which I have given of the biblical name Nebo-shasban (see No. 184).\n\n214. **Minassi.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, Manasseh, king of Judah; Heb. \u05de\u05b0\u05e0\u05b7\u05e9\u05b6\u05bc\u05c1\u05d4.\u2014This name, according to Gesenius, signifies \u2018Amnesty,\u2019 or \u2018Oblivion;\u2019 for, at the time of his birth Hezekiah hoped to reconcile all parties to his rule. The facts of his life are much disputed by theologians. He had certainly on one occasion a personal interview with Esarhaddon (apparently in the Palace of Nineveh), see R 48, 2. \u201cI assembled 22 kings of Syria, and the sea coast, and the islands. And I passed them in review (or laid my commands upon them).\u201d \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 and \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. The first in this list of kings is Baal king of Tyre. The second is Manasseh king of Judah. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Minassi Sar Iahudi.\n\n215. **La-rash.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, an Enemy.\u2014\u201cA new king of Susa ascended the throne, who was no friend to religion and law,\u201d R 41, 3, la rash bilemi u iski \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. Awful emblems of the gods, \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, were sculptured on the Michaux stone to deter the evil-disposed, who might otherwise have destroyed it. These formidable figures have hitherto guarded the stone successfully! They were sculptured, says the inscription, \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 ana khuri la-rashie, for the terror of enemies. Heb. khur \u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 \u2018metus, terror.\u2019\n\nI think that la rash is the contrary of rash \u2018a friend.\u2019\n\n216. **Suk.** \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, Wet, Watery; Filled with Water.\u2014The Chald. verb suka \u05d0\u05b4\u05e1\u05b0\u05db\u05b8\u05bc\u05d0 when said of a man, means \u2018to drink;\u2019 of a flock, \u2018to be watered;\u2019 of land or soil, \u2018to be irrigated\u2019 (Schindler). It is remarkable that the symbol \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 is composed of \ud808\udc97 (the sign for water), placed within a field or enclosure (see next article). Compare also the Heb. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8 to be low, sunk or depressed.\n217. Gi. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, a Valley, or Wet Bottom.\u2014So Norris (dict. 156), who compares the Heb. \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa3 \u2018a valley,\u2019 no doubt correctly. Again, the syllabary 366 renders \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 or gie by kitu, which, as Mr. N. observes, means \u2018the earth.\u2019 I will add that kitu also means \u2018down,\u2019 or anything that is \u2018low.\u2019 Now, in the preceding article we have suk \u2018watery.\u2019 These two words put together make gi sukki \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 marshes (first correctly translated by Oppert marais). Mr. N. remarks that \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 and \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 are separate words, because they are in separate lines on the stone. Example R46, 54. The Gambuli tribe (in lower Chald\u00e6a near the sea) are described as dwelling \u2018like fishes,\u2019 kima nuni, in the waters and marshes \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 as mie u gi sukki. It is added, that their territory extended twelve kasbu.\n\n218. Masak. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, the Skin.\u2014Agrees entirely with the Chald. \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa3 \u2018pellis,\u2019 \u2018cutis.\u2019 This word was first explained by Oppert. Masak-su akutz, \u2018cutem ejus detraxi\u2019; Opp. Khors. vi. 4 and vii. 1. The verb is here spelt \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97.\n\n219. Zu, or Tzu. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, the Skin.\u2014A Proto-Chald\u00e6an word frequently used in the inscriptions. R19, 92, Akutzu zu-sun, \u2018I stripped off their skins.\u2019 Repeated in the next line in the singular \u2018his skin.\u2019 The verb in the former line is written \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, and in the latter line \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, while in Opp. Khors. vi. 4 it is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. These forms are nearly equivalent. Tzu also means the skin of a wild beast, ex.gr. R14, 68: Tiglath Pileser kills four wild bulls in one of his hunting expeditions, and says \u201cI sent home their skins and their horns to my city of Ashur.\u201d Here \u2018skins\u2019 are expressed by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, which is the same symbol slightly varied. In 2R16, 57 the P.C. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 is rendered in Assyrian masak \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97.\n\n220. Shadu. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, a King.\u2014This is the Heb. \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa3 dominus, fortis, potens. Bagdatti, the Shadu (or king) of Isdis. Opp. Khors. vi. 3. The term \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 is very frequently applied to the chief of the gods, ex.gr. R37, 10, where Sennacherib\nsays: Ashur shadu rabu, Ashur the great King; sarrut la shanan usatlima annima, has given me a kingdom which is unavailable. So also the Hebrew uses \u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4 as an epithet of Jehovah, Job v. 17, &c. &c. Our version has 'Almighty,' and 'Shaddai.' LXX \u03c0\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1. Vulg. Omnipotens.\n\nI am at present rather inclined to explain the second (or less frequently used) name of Nebuchadnezzar, viz. Nebushadu-ussur, 'Nebo protect the King.' His principal name, Nebo-kudurri-ussur appears to have a similar meaning, see Art. 192 for the word \u05d3\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8\u05b7\u05da\u05b0 'powerful.' It may be 'Nebo protect my crown,' or 'my royal power.'\n\n221. Basa, to Dwell; to Exist.\u2014Ibbasu \u1d25 \u1d20 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 'he dwelt.'\n\"Where a beast of the desert never dwelt; nor a bird of the air ever built its nest\" (example quoted by Norris, dict. 357).\n\"Nineveh the exalted city, the city beloved by Ishtar, where all manner of worship of gods and goddesses has a dwelling within it,\" basu kir\u0113b-su \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 (Bellino, l. 35).\nIn B.M. 18, 30 the king says: \"I built a city, which I called the city of Ashur-basha:\" \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 (Ashur's dwelling).\nOf course there was a temple of Ashur there, and probably a fine one. Ki yaati val ibassi, \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 with me they dwelt not.\u20142 R 60, 18.\n\nI do not find this verb in Hebrew. I think it may be the Persian bashiden, to dwell or be. Bas a dwelling-place, home, residence; bash being, living, existence (Gilchrist's Vocab. p. 70).\n\n222. Dalu, to Sell.\u2014Ittadalu 'he sold.' Schindler, p. 390, gives the Arabic \u062f\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0644\u064e, \u0644\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0644\u064e (which he reads dalal and dal), and explains 'he sold by auction.' His words are 'per praecomen res vendidit; auctionatus fuit; hast\u00e6 subjecit; publicavit bona.' He also gives the conjugation astadal having the same meaning. This word occurs on the tablet 2 R 13, 30. 'Bit ana kaspi ittadalu,' he sold his house for silver (or money). This is followed in four separate lines, by 'he sold his field for silver,\u2014his wood or plantation\u2014his female slave\u2014his male slave.' The original terms are these: \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 'house,' \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 'field,' \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21 \u1d21\nwood,' (shallat) 'female slave,' (perhaps ardu) 'male slave.' Of these is important as showing that this sign meant woods or plantations in general, and not any particular sort of tree. Norris, p. 388, gives the same explanation of the term. Then, curiously enough, the whole of these valuables are crowded into a single line (l. 28).\n\nThe only difference is, that the male slaves are now named first. These five things are called tsibit kaspi-su 'his valuables' (literally res argenti sui). Tsibit being the Chaldee 'res, negotium' (Sch. 1513). We have had the word before (see in Art. 127 Kamu tsibitti-sun). These valuables of five kinds, the tablet says (l. 29) 'ana manzazani uzziz,' he put up to ...... (perhaps to auction). The word manzazan is unknown to me, but probably comes from the same root as uzziz 'he set up,' Heb. 'firmavit,' a root exceedingly common in Assyrian. Manzaz would be a substantive formed from this root. Some light is thrown upon it by l. 20, which speaks of the 'sale' (simat) by the manzazan, which I take to be some sign fixed up indicating 'a sale;' perhaps it was a spear fixed in the ground and bearing a flag (compare the Latin expression hastae subjicere, to sell publicly). Cicero says: Sylla ausus est dicere, hast\u00e2 posit\u00e2, cum bona in foro venderet, &c. Emptionem ab hast\u00e2 (Nepos). Ibi nunc ad hastam locamus, we let by public auction (Livy). Sub hast\u00e2 venditis (Tacitus), &c.\n\nItadalu is spelt in lines 30 and 38. Manzazan is written in two ways. In line 29 it is . But in line 21 . The P.C. translation of this is Duba .\n\n223. Napal (verb), to Throw Down.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Heb. 'to fall,' and in Hiph. 'to throw down.' Dur-su raba u atsaiti-su sha agavri, ana napali akba su, its great citadel and its towers of brick, to throw them down I gave command.'\u2014Tig. vi. 28. So also Opp. Khors. p. 178. Napali is spelt .\n224. **Zahin** (verb), to Adorn.\u2014When a Temple is spoken of, the king often says 'Uzahin' \u039e\u03a0\u03a0\u039e \u0399\u0399 \u0391-\u03a0 \u039e\u0395 \u039e\u0395 \u039e\u0395 \u039e\u0395 I adorned it. *Ex.gr.* 2 R38, 51. Also in Phill. i. 33; \"I adorned the temple of Zarpanita with images,\" \u039e\u0395 \u039e\u039e-\u03a0\u039e \u039e\u0399 \u039e\u0391 \u039e\u0391 \u039e\u0391 kutzibam, from Heb. \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e a carved stone.\n\nI do not find the verb zahin in Hebrew. It is the Arabic Zain \u0632\u064a\u0646 'an ornament.'\n\n225. **Thup.** \u039e\u0395\u039e\u0395\u039e\u0395 (adj.), Good.\u2014Agrees with the Heb. \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e bonus. The meaning is ascertained from R16, 61, where it is made equivalent to the P.C. khiga (good).\n\n226. **Dabu.** \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e (adj.), Good.\u2014Closely related to the preceding. Sha erit-zun dabu, whose forests are good.\u2014R39, 23.\n\n227. **Dabish.** \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e (adv.), Well.\u2014Heb. \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e bonus. Dabish upakhir, *I well collected, I skilfully assembled* (said of precious objects of art).\u2014Phill. iii. 24.\n\nIn R16, 62 it is spelt \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e Dapish. \"May the gods protect him well! (dapish lattarru-su).\" Here the other copy reads khigaish (see the next article).\n\n228. **Khigaish.** \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e (adv.), Well.\u2014An Assyrian adverb formed from the P.C. word khiga 'good.' This is very curious and important as showing that the Assyrians familiarly used Proto-Chaldaean words, and did not, as some suppose, read those words differently from what was written, by substituting an Assyrian translation. They may, of course, have done so sometimes, but it is evident that the languages had got intermixed, and many P.C. words were in actual use down to a late period. See a still more remarkable instance of this in the next article.\n\n229. **Khukharish.** \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e, Completely.\n\n*Ex.gr.* 2 R67, 15. \"All the land of Chald\u00e6a I swept completely bare, khukharish askhup.\" First, as to the verb askhup 'I swept.' This is the Heb. \u039e\u039e\u039e\u039e 'to sweep away.' Furst's Lexicon, p. 975; Gesen. p. 708. It occurs again in the same page, l. 13: 'kima sapari askhup,' I swept away (all that tribe) like shavings of wood. See similar passages in various inscrip-\ntions, *ex gr.* 'I left the land of Illipi a desert.' \"Not one soul was left.\" \"Not one tree was left,\" &c. &c. The very curious adverb *khukharish* seems to be a proverbial expression, composed of *khu* 'a bird,' and *kha* 'a fish,' which are very commonly joined together in the inscriptions. Hence *khukharish askhup* meant \"I swept off both fowl and fish,\" that is \"I swept away everything.\" \"Nothing was left alive.\" This adverb occurs again, same page, l. 32: \"Those districts of Media *khukharish akkir*.\" This verb *akkir* may come from *nakkir* 'to destroy.' Initial N is often dropped in the verbs.\n\n**230. Salmish.**\n\notherwise *Salmish atura*, I returned safely. *Ex.* given by Norris, p. 404, Salmish lattarruni, may (the gods) protect me safely!\u2014R16, 30. Atura from the root *tur*, to turn or return.\n\n**231. Haggarish.**\n\nDown to the Ground: from *haggar* 'the ground,' for which see Art. 109.\n\nHaggarish ibbul, he destroyed it down to the ground.\u2014Botta 87, 5. Another example in 2R67, 21: 'I levelled that city with the earth.'\n\n**232. Akilu.**\n\nCorn, Cornfields.\u2014Heb. frumentum, fruges, annonae, cibus. \"May the god Sanna destroy all his cornfields!\" *akilu bari lilabbit-zu,*; from Heb. 'periit,' R70, col. iii. 19. Another of the Michaux inscriptions gives a different phrase, \"May the gods destroy all his cornfields!\" *gimir lani-su lilabbit-zu.* Sanna may be the god of the Year; see Bellino, l. 49, where Sanna (so spelt) signifies 'a year.'\n\nAnother example is found in 2R53, col. iv. 1, Akilut, 'provisions' or 'eatables,' and again in col. iv. 38.\n\n**233. Bar.**\n\nCorn, Wheat.\u2014Heb. Bar frumentum. Gesenius remarks that the Latin *Far* is the same word (see an ex. of Bar in the last article).\n\n**234. Lani, Cornfields.**\n\nThe meaning is manifest from the parallelism of the passages adduced in Art. 232. It appears that the Assyrians said *lani* for *lami* (so they changed N for M in many\nother words). *Lami* would be the Heb. \u05dc\u05b8\u05dd \u2018Corn\u2019 (*triticum*, Ges. p. 529). Isaiah xxviii. 28 has \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05db\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d7\u05b8\u05de\u05b6\u05e1 the wheat is ground. The Greek \u03bb\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bb\u03b7\u03ae\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, a standing crop of corn seems related to *Lani*.\n\n**235. Takhumu.**\n\nthe Terms of a treaty; or the bounds, limits of territory agreed upon therein.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Chald. \u05ea\u05b8\u05bc\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9\u05dd terminus, finis; from the verb \u05d7\u05b8\u05de\u05b6\u05e1 terminavit, definit, descriptis, &c. Examples from the Synchronous History, 2 R 65, 5: Butzur-Ashur (i.e. Rampart of Ashur) king of Assyria, and Burna-burias king of Kardunias (or Babylonia); itmu mizri takhumi, wrote down the boundaries and limits of their countries; annama ukinu, and made a treaty of peace. Again, l. 45: \u201cThe men of Assyria and of Kardunias, itti akhati mizru takhumu, agreed with each other and defined their boundaries.\u201d\n\n**236. Mutbara.**\n\na Desert.\u2014Agrees exactly with the Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 medbar or mudbar, \u2018a desert.\u2019 Mutbara azbat, I marched into the desert.\u2014R13, 45.\n\n**237. Khuribta.**\n\na Desert.\u2014Agrees with Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05d3\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e8 \u2018a desert.\u2019\n\nKhuribta azabta, I marched into the desert.\u2014R 24, 28.\n\n[Azabta and azbat are varieties of the same word.] I slew wild beasts in the desert, in khuribti.\u2014R 14, 63. Spelt \u05d0\u05b7\u05d6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0.\n\n**238. Khinki.**\n\nthe Narrows: the narrow part of a river where it is confined between two hills.\u2014Agrees with the Heb. \u05db\u05b4\u05bc\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4 khinek, \u2018angustus fuit: strangulavit.\u2019 \u201cI marched or went (azbat) until I reached the narrows of the river Euphrates,\u201d khinki \u05d0\u05b7\u05d6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d6\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0.\u2014R 24, 30, and again line 44. Gesenius remarks that a great many Greek, Latin, German, &c., words contain this root \u1f00\u03bd\u03ba, such as angustus, angor, anxit, \u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03b5\u03c5 to hang, enge seyn, Angst, \u03b1\u03b3\u03c7\u03b9 (close to), &c. And in Hebrew itself \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4, \u05d0\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e7\u05b5\u05d4. It is a subject worthy of the attention of the philologist. There must be some natural cause that has induced so many nations to agree in employing this sound to express \u2018closeness\u2019 and \u2018tightness.\u2019\n239. Mut. \u05de\u05d5\u05ea, Death.\u2014The same in Hebrew \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u2018mora.\u2019\n\nUsasdir ana mut, I sentenced them to death.\u2014Bl. Stone of Esarhaddon, iii. 24. Mutu sinu asarrak sunuti, a bad death I gave to them (example quoted by Norris, p. 434). The word is here spelt \u05de\u05d5\u05ea. The next example of the word which I am about to adduce appears to me a very curious one. Herodotus relates that Cambyses killed himself, but that he did it by accident (Herod. iii. 64). The Persian inscription at Behistun, however, uses words which suggested to Rawlinson that Cambyses really intended suicide. I will copy the note in his Herodotus, Vol. 2, p. 459: \u201cThe words of the Behistan inscription cause a suspicion that the death may have been a suicide. Cambyses, it is said, after the whole empire had revolted, \u2018self-wishing to die, died\u2019 (uv\u00e1marshiyush amariyata).\u201d At the time when this note was written the Assyrian version was not well understood, and is, therefore, not referred to by Rawlinson. Let us, therefore, now consult it. Arku Kambusya mitutu ramanni-su miti. \u2018After this Cambyses died from a mortal wound given by himself.\u2019 It will be observed that the last letter is doubled in mitut. I will give another example of this usage. \u201cThe king of Susa after his defeat only lived three months, and was then put to death, imtut.\u201d\u2014R41, 2. So in Hebrew \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u2018to put to death\u2019 (Ges. 558).\n\nWe also find Mat \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u2018Death,\u2019 ex.gr. Mat sarri \u05de\u05d5\u05ea \u2018the king\u2019s death.\u2019\u20142 R16, 42. As the passage is a very curious one, I will give it at length. It relates to a kind of sortilegium, or speculating on future events by drawing lots:\n\n1.Talk\u00e2 mat sar\n2.lukul!\n3.Talk\u00e2 bullut\n4.luskun!\n1. If thou castest the lot of the king's death,\n2. May it be false!\n3. If thou castest the lot of his life,\n4. May it be true!\n\nThe sign \u1e63\u1e63 is doubtless to be read tal, as in line 14 of the same page 16, \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 tallik, 'thou goest.' This value was first pointed out by Rawlinson, and is confirmed by Syllabary 563. Lukul probably from \u05e0\u05b8\u05d1\u05b7\u05dc 'to be false.' Lusku, 'may it hold fast!' 'may it be firm!' from \u05e9\u05b4\u05c1\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05df stabilize, 'to fix.' The P.C. word for 'death' was durga, 2R16, 42 and 2R17, 39, where it answers to the Assyrian verb \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 imut. Talk\u0101 is from Heb. \u05d7\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05dc\u05d5\u05bc, Gr. \u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd.\n\nIt appears to me that the single sign \u1e63\u1e63 Mat sometimes signifies 'death.' In 2R65, 45 we read \"In the days of Salmanubar king of Assyria, (Marduk)baladan [or possibly Nebo-baladan] who was king of Kardunias died, and Marduk-mu-mu ascended his father's throne. 'He died' is expressed by \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 . . . mat-su e . . . . The verb, beginning with e, is unfortunately lost, and I am unable to supply the defect. The reign of Marduk-mu-mu is likewise commemorated on Salmanubar's Obelisk, line 73, but nothing is there said of his father's death.\n\n240. Marusta. \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63, Perilous, Awful.\u2014Arrata marusta liruru-su, may he curse him with awful (or perilous) curses! R16, 76, where the last sign is \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63. The meaning of the word appears from 2R17, col. ii. 27 and 55 and 56, where the comparison of the P.C. shows that marusta and muruz \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 are both derived from the common adjective marzu 'dangerous,' of which the symbol is \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63. The root marzu \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 is found in lines 45 and 50 of the same column.\n\n241. Sutta. \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63 \u1e63\u1e63, a Dream.\u2014I propose this word for examination. The Hebrew is \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05e0\u05b5\u05ea sunta, but I think this was pronounced sutta, just as \u05d1\u05b7\u05bc\u05ea 'a daughter' was pronounced Bath (dropping the N before a T); and in Assyrian from laban 'a brick' we have the very frequent word libitta\n\u2018bricks.\u2019 In the prayer 2R17, 28, which may be called the Assyrian Litany, we find the following clause: \u201cSutta nu damikta, from dreams that are unholy (or unlucky) O king of heaven defend us! O king of earth defend us!\u201d The P.C. translation of this is fortunately preserved. Nu damikta is rendered \u2018not holy,\u2019 and Sutta is rendered \u2018a Dream.\u2019\n\n242. Habarit. Antimony.\u2014This word was first explained by Oppert (Exp. en M\u00e9s. p. 344), but he reads it differently. Antimony is much used by women in the East, for darkening the eyes and eyebrows. I therefore think that the Assyrian name for it Habarit or Habara may be reasonably deduced from \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea, which signifies \u2018blackness\u2019 (Sch. p. 518), induced by any cause on the flesh; also the black spots on a leopard\u2019s skin. Hence also the Arab. hibar \u05d7\u05b2\u05d1\u05b8\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea Ink (Sch. 520). Related to this is the Chald. \u05d9\u05b0\u05d1\u05d5\u05b9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea dark; obscured; drest in black, &c. (Sch. 420). A second example has been given by Norris from Botta 152, 16. I will add a third from 2R67, 62, where it occurs among the tribute paid by the kings of Syria and Palestine to Tiglath Pileser II.\n\n243. Urru. a Day.\u2014Agrees well with the Heb. \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 lux; for so the Latins say una lux for \u2018one day.\u2019 The Heb. \u05d4\u05b8\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 is also used for \u2018the Sun:\u2019 and in several languages \u2018one sun\u2019 is equivalent to \u2018one day.\u2019 Urru musu akbud, I laboured day and night [at the building of my new city].\u2014Sarg. 39 and Botta 37, 44, quoted by Norris, dict. p. 125. Urru u musu, day and night (broken slab quoted by Norris, p. 225). Moreover, in 2R25, 23 Urru is explained by Tamu, \u2018a day.\u2019\n\nSarg. 39 is misprinted. The word should be Urra; which is followed by u musha [and night].\n\n244. Musish. adv., by Night; see Art. 68.\u2014Another example is found in Botta 87, 1, where it is said that Merodach Baladan escaped by night from Babylon. Musish utsi,\nhe fled by night; written \ud808\ude17\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udda0. This verb appears to be one of the forms of the Heb. \u05e0\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 (see next article).\n\n245. Utzu, to Fly for life; to Escape.\u2014In corroboration of the preceding article I will observe that \ud808\ude17\ud808\ude4c\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 utzu appears to mean \u2018they fled\u2019 in the difficult passage R42, 23, of which I will attempt a translation, first remarking that \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 has been corrected by Norris into ana, and that \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 sometimes stands for \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 dir. \u201cMunnadir-sun sha ana naphati utzu, ashar ibishadu uratsabu in esku: the rest of them, who fled for their lives, I destroyed with arrows in a desert place.\u201d It appears that after the battle he pursued the fugitives with cavalry and overtook them in the desert. Munnadir I take to be a participial form of the Heb. \u05e0\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 nutar (reliqui, the rest), which is from the verb \u05e0\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4. Ex. \u201cThou shalt put six of their names on one stone and the six names of the rest (\u05e0\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4 nutrim) on the other stone.\u201d\u2014Exod. xxviii. 10.\n\nIf this verb possesses the causative or S conjugation, it will be Sutea. I think we may perhaps recognise this form in the word \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 usutzu, which occurs in the Behistun inscription, line 34. If we adopt Mr. Norris\u2019s reading kikki for the broken word (see dict. p. 486) we may read and translate the passage\u2014As eli kikki usutzu, they ran to their boats [and crossed over to the other bank of the river Tigris. I followed them, &c.].\n\nIf this is correct the conjectures offered in the article Diklat, No. 111, become unnecessary, and the first part of that article may therefore be cancelled.\n\n246. Kakkabish. \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0, adv., Like the Stars.\u2014Heb. Cocab \u05db\u05d5\u05db\u05d1 \u2018a star.\u2019 \u201cThe shrine, or ark (literally ship or boat) of Kua, I adorned with bright spangles and precious stones like the stars of heaven (kakkabish shamami).\u201d\u2014E.I.H. iii. 10.\n\n247. Sumsut. \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0 \ud808\ude17\ud808\udda0, Enslavement: reduction to servitude or submission.\u2014In R51, col. ii. 21 the king prays for sumsut nakiri, \u2018the making foreign enemies to be his servants.\u2019 The word comes regularly from Ch. \u05e9\u05d5\u05de\u05e2 \u2018a servant.\u2019\n248. **Malmalish.** \u02be\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d9, adv. In common parlance; In conversation.\u2014Heb. \u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4 \u2018to speak;\u2019 \u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b6\u05d4 \u2018a word.\u2019 Sargina\u2019s inscriptions contain much vituperation of his great enemy Merodach Baladan king of Babylonia. In Botta pl. 19 bis he says: \u201cTaksuda rabtu kat-zu gimir mat-su rapashti malmalish itzutzu; All his kingdom calls him the Grasper with the Strong Hand.\u201d Taksuda, a Spoiler or Tyrant, from the very common Assyrian root \u02beakrud, ekrud, or kaad; to seize, take, obtain, attain. Itzutzu, \u2018they call him\u2019 (see Art. 161).\n\nThe phrase malmalish itzutzu occurs again on the Obel. l. 75. I have given the passage in Art. 161. Here malmalish is written \u02be\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d9 \u02be\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05d9.\n\n249. **Tamish.** \u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9, adv., like the Sun.\u2014\u201cThe shrines (or images) of the gods \u2018tamish unammir,\u2019 I made as bright as the Sun.\u201d\u2014E.I.H. vii. 8. But very often the phrase is varied to \u2018kima tamu.\u2019 Ex.gr. Phill. i. 38. Bit kima tamu lu-nammir, I made that temple as splendid as the sun. So in Esarh. iv. 48: \u201cI built ten large temples, and these unammir kima tami.\u201d In an inscription of Sennacherib, R7, slab D, the verb is in the S or causative conjugation, \u2018kima tami usnammir,\u2019 I caused it to be made splendid, &c.\n\nThe Sun was worshipped at Heliopolis in Egypt by the name of Tam. I think the Egyptians borrowed that name from the Semites. Tamu \u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9 is \u2018the Sun,\u2019 but \u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9 tam without the prefix is \u2018a day.\u2019 So in Latin, Sol \u2018a day\u2019 (trees soles erramus\u2014Virg.); and in Egyptian a circle with a dot in the centre means both \u2018the sun\u2019 and \u2018a day.\u2019\n\n250. Under this number I propose to collect a few additional remarks on some of the preceding articles:\n\n(No. 13) **Kuku.**\u2014This bird may be the Swan, which is called in Turkish kughu (cognate with Kukvos).\n\n(31) **Bul,** \u2018life\u2019\u2014\u201cThe king relied on thee, O Ninev! and in return thou didst firmly fix (or found) his life:\u201d tasharesdu bul-su.\u2014R17, 12, written \u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b7\u05d9\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05d9.\n\n(76) **Minuta,** \u2018number.\u2019\u2014R28, 28, \u201cminut-zun itti minuti anniti:\ntheir numbers (were placed) along with the former numbers.\" The king is speaking of his museum of animals, many of which were a present from the king of Egypt. It is said that all the specimens had 'names' and 'numbers' attached to them; and this in the 10th Century B.C.!\n\n(108) Laban, 'a Plain.'\u2014This important word occurs again in 2R67, 8, 'iri birtu sha labbanat,' fortified cities of the plain, written \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\).\n\n(136) Baal. Add the name of Abibal. \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\) 'Baal is my father;' unless it stands for Abdibal (servant of Baal).\u2014R 48, 6. He was king of Ussimiruna (Samaria). Idolatrous kings then reigned in Samaria, which had been taken by the Assyrians some years previously. Manasseh was then reigning in Judah, Esarhaddon in Assyria.\n\n(149) Mutninnu, 'generous.'\u2014In a passage quoted by Norria, dict. p. 468, \"Sar mutninnu, rat illuri su,\" whose feet are golden. Another king uses the same phrase, saying that the feet of his throne are golden (see R35, 3), \"usarsidu guza-su rat illu, the gods placed his throne upon golden feet.\" 'Ribitu (or Rihu) mutninnu,' the generous Ruler (Bellino, l. 2).\n\n(154) Nimattu occurs again (Botta 87, 2) amongst the plunder of Babylon, and can, therefore, hardly be the same as the guza nimidi.\n\n(157) Nutarda.\u2014The Michaux Stones spell this word with the sign \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\) instead of \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\). This sign \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\), or Tar, signifies 'a Chief,' as in Tartan; also a man of rank or condition.\n\n(170) Nisikti means not 'pearls' only, but precious stones in general. Perhaps derived from the Syriac \\( \\text{\u0722\u071d\u072b\u071f} \\) niskh, clarus, nitidus, splendidus.\u2014Schaaf's lex. p. 357.\n\n251. Lakitza. \\( \\text{\ud800\udf81\ud800\udf82\ud800\udf84\ud800\udf85} \\), the city of Lachish.\u2014The sculpture representing the capture of Lachish by Sennacherib has been well described by Mr. Layard (Nineveh and Babylon, p. 152). But the inscription is given erroneously, and the translation is not correct. I have, therefore, followed the text given in R, pl. 7, slab I: \"Sennacherib king of Assyria, as guza\nnimidi usib, sitting on his travelling throne (or palanquin), shallat ir Lakitzu makhar-su etik, has the captives of the city of Lachish brought before him.\u201d Layard\u2019s description of the sculpture in p. 149 says: \u201cFrom the gateway of an advanced tower or fort issued a procession of captives, reaching to the presence of the king, who, gorgeously arrayed, received them seated on his throne.\u201d Etik is the Heb. \u05d4\u05b8\u05d9\u05b5\u05bc\u05d4 Hiph. of \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8 \u2018movit, transtulit.\u2019\u2014Ges. 807.\n\nCompare the slab of Ashurbanipal, R, pl. 8, No. 1, where the king, having taken a city of Armenia, says (1.8) \u201cthe inhabitants male and female, small and great (i.e. young and old), ushatiku as makhri-ya, I made pass in procession before me.\u201d Ushattik is the sha or causative conjugation of etik. This verb is very common, and often applied to the march of an army.\n\n252. Shamir. Diamonds.\u2014Tablet of Ishtar, No. 162: reverse, clause 2. Shamir idi-sha u ratti-sha, the diamonds on her hands and feet. \u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05e8 \u2018adamas, lapis durissimus\u201d (Buxtorf).\n\n253. Zummirat. Some kind of precious stones. Diamonds?\u2014Perhaps the same as Shamir (see the preceding article). \u201cI captured and carried off \u2018zummirat sib-su,\u2019 the precious jewels of his throne, simat saruti-su, and his royal crown.\u201d\u2014R, pl. 8, No. 1. Perhaps, however, Zummirat was the Smaragdus or Smarad (for it loses the g in French \u00c9meraude).\n\n254. Arakh, a Month (see No. 23).\u2014Arakh-samna, i.e. \u2018the 8th month,\u2019 has been corrupted into the month Marchesvan of the Jewish Calendar (see Norris, dict. p. 50). This affords a good instance of the numeral \u2018samna,\u2019 eight, which agrees with the Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d7\u05d5\u05b9 \u2018octo.\u2019 It also shows that Marakh was sometimes employed for Arakh. Another form is Arkhu, as in the phrase Arkhu maqr\u016b, \u2018casual month.\u2019\u2014Norris, ibid. I will add a curious passage from Botta 46, 56. In the month arakh mukin timin Ar u Bit sha\u2019 gimir nishat reshdu ana rimiti-sin ipattaka; i.e. \u201cI began my new palace, &c. &c., in the month arakh, which is the proper\nmonth (month) for laying the foundation-stone of a City or a Building, and in which all (former) kings have begun their buildings.\" signifies 'new,' which circumstance (whether accidental or not) would be a sufficient reason to a superstitious people for commencing new buildings in that month. *Nishat reshdu* is changed in another inscription to *malki sha kiprati*, 'kings of the nations.' *Rimwi* means 'foundations' or 'new buildings,' from Ch. *\u05e8\u05b8\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea* 'fundavit edificium, posuit, collocavit,' *ex gr.* irmu subat-zun, they built their dwellings; and the derived word *\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05bc* is equated to *\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9* 'foundation' (Heb. *\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9*) in 2 R35, 44. *Ipattak*, 'they began,' seems derived from Ch. *\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b0\u05d5\u05b4\u05d9* 'initium' (Sch. 1503).\n\n**Sandanish.**\n\nThis word, which had better perhaps be written *Tsandanish*, giving to its proper value *tea*, Heb. *\u05ea\u05b5\u05d0*, is derived, I think, from the Heb. *\u05ea\u05b5\u05d0* 'continuare.' In R36 Sargon boasts of his numerous conquests. At line 21 he calls himself \"Lihu pikhari sha in kabal tamti Yamnaia tsandanish kima nuni in ruba usipsikhu mat Kue u ir Tsurri; Conqueror of the pirates of the Ionian sea, who like fishes are continually in their ships traversing the sea between the land of Cyprus and the city of Tyre.\"\n\nSargon felt a great interest in Cyprus, where he gained victories and erected tablets. It was at that time probably that he attacked the pirates who infested the neighbouring sea. *Lihu* 'conqueror.' Hence the name of King Ashur-lihu, otherwise Ashur-zu (Ashur the conqueror). Perhaps *liti* 'victories' may be hence derived. *Pikhari* I render 'pirates.' Observe, the printed text has *pikhari* and not *takhari*, which makes no sense. The origin of this word is unknown to me, I think it can hardly come from the Arabic *\u0627\u0644\u0628\u062d\u0631* 'the sea.' Perhaps there was another form *Pikharati* or *Piharati*: if so, I think it may be a corruption of the Greek *\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2* 'a pirate.' The Greek sailors had a large share in the commerce of those seas, therefore many Greek words came into vogue and got mixed with the\nSemitic. 'Like fishes' is a strange expression, but it must mean that they were so continually at sea that the Sea was, as it were, their native element, which would strike an Assyrian writer the more who, perhaps, never crossed the sea more than once or twice in his life. Ruba are Ships. Usipsikku 'they traverse' is the sha conjugation of the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05e2\u05b7\u05e8 'to traverse, to pass over.' We see a similarly formed word in the name of the city Thapsacus \u05d7\u05b8\u05e4\u05b0\u05e1\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05e1 i.e. 'the passage,' where the great passage of the river Euphrates was situated (Ges. 832).\n\nThe Pitkari must be some class of persons, for they are said 'to traverse the sea.' They cannot be peaceful navigators, for, since Sargina controlled both Cyprus and Tyre, merchants trading between those ports would not be his enemies.\n\n256. Tammuz. The Hebrew month \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05de\u05bb\u05bc\u05d6.\u2014All the Hebrew months are well represented by the Assyrian names given by Norris, dict. p. 50, with the exception of Tammuz, which is written \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9. This gives only Duz or Duzu. I think the difficulty may be removed by observing that \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 sometimes has the value dam, which gives us the word dam-u-ru or Damuz.\n\n257. Talatti. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, Birth.\u2014In R 36, 60 Sargina dedicates one of the gates of his palace in gratitude to the Queen of the gods (Billat-ili) \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 murappishat talatti-su, she who caused his birth to be noble. This goddess, the Assyrian Juno, like Juno Lucina, presided over births, allotting to each newborn child its good or evil fortune. Talatti like Alatti (see next article) comes from the Heb. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 natus est; genuit; peperit; \u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u1fb6\u03bd.\n\n258. Alatti. \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 \u05d0\u05b2\u05d3\u05b9\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9, Birth.\u2014This word occurs in a very important passage B.M. 38, 3, in the explanation of which I am obliged to differ entirely from my friend Mr. Norris, who sees in it a word Agarin, which he interprets 'mother' (see dict. p. 16). As I must dissent from this, I feel it necessary to explain at some length my reasons for doing so, lest I should appear to differ on light grounds from his opinion.\nThe kings often thank the gods for the great favour shown to them, in causing them to be born in so high a rank. Ex. gr. In Birs N. l. 10 Nebuchadnezzar says \"The favour of Marduk the great Lord, kinish ibn-annima, created me of royal rank.\"\n\nIbn 'he created' is \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 from \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc bana 'to create.' Very similar is the passage which occurs both in R43, 4 and in B.M. 61, 2 (except that we find \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 ban written instead of \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 ibna). \"Ashur father of the gods, in kullat maliki kinish ban-annima, gave me a noble birth among the assembly of kings.\"\n\nKullat 'assembly' is \u05e7\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05dc 'c\u00e6tus,' from Heb. \u05e7\u05b6\u05d3\u05b6\u05dc congregavit (Nerrie also reads this word as kullat). Similarly we read in pl. 114 of Botta: \"Yaati Sargina, I Sargina king of Assyria, &c., whom Ashur, in napkhar maliki kinish uttannima;\" using napkhar 'assembly' (from pakhar 'to assemble') instead of kullat, and the verb utta 'he created' instead of bana or ibna. The difficult passage B.M. 38, 3 has the same general meaning. Sennacherib there says: \"Billat ili, billat nabniti, the Queen of the gods, who is the Queen of Births, in lib rubu baga talinni alatti-ya; kinish ban-annima; uzabb\u00e1 nabniti.\" Now, in the first place, I must observe that Mr. N.'s transcript (in dict. p. 16) omits the important word rubu 'royal,' and substitutes for it \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 ib. But Mr. Layard's annotation at foot of the page shows that he found on another copy of the Bull inscription the variant reading \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9, which is an admissible variation of \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 and supports it; showing that \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 cannot be the true reading. We must, therefore, restore the word \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 'royal.'\n\nWe have seen in the preceding article that Sargina attributed his noble birth to the favour of \u05d9\u05b4\u05d1\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 'the Queen of the gods.' Sennacherib now speaks of the same goddess, and calls her 'billat nabniti,' Queen of Births. Nabniti\n'births' is from nabna 'to be born,' the Niphal of the verb bana. The last part of the line 'kinish ban*-annima' we have had before, and for 'uzabba nabniti' some of the other bulls read 'usarba nabniti,' made my birth splendid. The verb sarba means 'to exalt or glorify.' Thus on the monolith R27, 11 the gods are called 'musarbu sarti,' exalters of my royalty. The real difficulty of the passage, therefore, resides only in the phrase \"the Queen of the gods, who is the Queen of Births, in lib rubu baga talinni alatti-ya,\" and indeed only in two of these words, baga and talinni. The first of these I believe to be a word of Indo-Germanic origin. There are not many such employed in the Assyrian language, but there are some indubitable instances, such as the preposition In; Nis for 'no one;' Nu for 'not;' Tuki 'fortune' or 'good luck.' The Persian adjective takman 'strong' is frequently used in Assyrian as 'biritu takmannu anbar atdi-su, I cast on him strong chains of iron.' Basa 'to dwell, be, exist,' is the Persian bas 'a dwelling;' bash 'being, living, existence,' from bashiden 'to dwell or be.' Kurra 'a horse' is very unlike the Semitic sus \u05d0\u05b8\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05bc\u05e2, but agrees with the Sanskrit gora.\n\nFortified by such instances of words borrowed by the Assyrians from their neighbours, I would suggest that Baga \u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d2\u05b8\u05d0 is the Persian word Bhag, which is rendered 'Fortune, destiny, share, lot;' in Gilchrist's Vocab. p. 76. Talinni \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05dc\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df\u05b4\u05d9. This word, I think, affords the key to the meaning of the whole passage. Tala \u05ea\u05b7\u05bc\u05dc\u05b0\u05d0 'she caused' is the feminine of the Chald. verb ala \u05d0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b5\u05d0 'to cause;' thence talinni 'she caused unto me.' In lib 'within' differs but little from the simple preposition In, only it is somewhat more precise. I translate the whole passage, therefore, as follows: \"The Queen of the gods, who is the Queen of births, caused unto me my birth in a royal destiny;\" or, in other words, and\n\n* Pronounced ibn. The sign \u05d9\u05b6\u05e0 represents the verb bana in general, and any tense of it which the syntax requires.\nslightly paraphrased, \"My lot in birth, for which I thank the Queen of heaven, was to be born a king.\"\n\nWith respect to the Syllab. 192, quoted by Norris, p. 16, where agarin is rendered by ummu, and also by a monogram, I must observe that this monogram is quite unlike the well-known monogram for 'a mother,' and therefore it probably expresses some other meaning of ummu.\n\n259. Parakku. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, a Chief; or perhaps a King.\u2014In 2 R 31, there is a list of words, all of which mean 'a king,' and are rendered by Sar. One of these is Parakku (l. 42). In Syllab. 255 Parakku is explained by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, which means 'first in rank,' and by Bara \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97. Hence perhaps Parakku is derived from this word bara and ukku 'great.' In 2 R 35, 14, parakku is rendered \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 pan pan 'front of the front,' and \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 dihu, which means 'the front' (see Art. 120 of this Glossary).\n\nIn line 52 of the same page \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 ami parakki is rendered in P.C. by \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, written twice (i.e. 'the very first') with other signs added which I do not understand. Ami I would translate 'men,' from the Heb. \u4f17 'populus,' unless it is short for amilut 'men.' These notices enable us to explain a passage which occurs in several inscriptions, ex gr. R 37, 12 and R 43, 4, \"eli gimir ami parakki usarb\u00e1 eskuti-ya, over all kings Ashur raised high (or triumphantly) my arms.\"\n\nThe meaning of \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 as 'king' or 'chief' is shown in the following phrase of tablet 124: \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, as ili sha shamami, barit? sha hakkari, to the gods of heaven and the first men of the earth.\n\n260. Lulimu. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, otherwise \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, a King or Ruler.\u2014In 2 R 31, 41 this word is rendered by Sar 'a king.' In B.M. 38, 2 and R 43, 2, Sennacherib is called Lulimu irsu, 'the noble king.'\n\n261. Amat. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, a Petition, Prayer, or Complaint.\u2014When Nebuchadnezzar had offered a prayer to Marduk, he says: (E.I.H. i. 53) \"Amat libi istihu, he granted the petition of my\nheart.\" Istihu, 'he granted.' Mustihu, 'the giver,' ex.gr. mustihu baladam, 'giver of gifts.' Papakha biluti-su astihi, I gave a shrine to his lordship. E.I.H. iii. 25.\n\nThe following is another example of the word Amat:\n\n1. Mamman amat-su val ishmi\n2. Dayana din-su val itin.\n\n1. No one heard his complaint:\n2. No judge gave judgment in his cause.\n\nThese two lines occur at the end of tablet 169. They are accompanied by a P.C. version, half of which is gone, but some interesting words remain. Ishmi, 'he heard,' is rendered unduk. Din itan, 'he gave judgment,' is rendered undin; but only marks the tense; the roots are duk, for the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'to hear,' and \u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df for the Heb. \u05d3\u05b4\u05bc\u05d9\u05df 'to judge.' Now, \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 means 'fame, renown,' as well as 'hearing,' and it will be remembered that duk has that meaning, viz. 'renown,' in the name of king Nabo-imduk (Nebo is glorious), in Assyrian Nabo-nahid. Similarly in 2R16, 32 is rendered by simti or tanimti, which apparently comes from \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2.\n\n262. Sadakhu. a Holiday: idle day: festival (Lat. feria).\u2014From the Heb. \u05d0\u05b9\u05d8\u05b6\u05e1 'otiosus fuit: vel, felix et tranquillus fuit.' It is said, in an inscription in the British Museum, that the Sadakhu of the divine Queen of Babylon (the goddess Nanaia) was celebrated on the 25th of the month Sivan.\n\n263. Timin. sometimes timmin. The Clay Cylinder which was deposited in the foundations of a building, inscribed with the name and praises of the reigning Monarch.\u2014I believe that no etym has been proposed for this word, I therefore venture to suggest that it comes from the Heb. temen or timin, 'abscondere,' which verb Gesenius says is specially used for 'hiding treasures, &c.\nunder ground.' For, the clay cylinder was always carefully hidden, and protected as far as possible from spoilers and devastators, *ex gr.* Ashtapat pili rabbati ashuru-su usaskir, udannin subuk-su, *with large flat stones I closed up the place of it, and I made its deposit secure.*\u2014Bellino, l. 53. That the Timin was the Cylinder (not the Platform) appears from the inscription of Nabonidus, quoted in Norris's dict. 408: \"Ana buhi timinna suati, *in the search for that Timin, I dug* (akthut) three years in the diggings of Nebuchadnezzar King of Babylon.\" Had he sought for the platform only, it would have been found much sooner. The verb buhi, which occurs in the preceding passage, is the Chald. \u05d1\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05e2\u05b7 'quasivit,' as was first observed by Dr. Hincks. In R16, 63 the word is spelt \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05d9\u05b5\u05d9 timini. \"Whoever shall injure my stone tablets and my timini, may the gods destroy him!\"\n\n264. Sikhib. \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9, Spoil, plunder.\u2014From the Heb. \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9 'rapuit.' \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9 \u05e1\u05b4\u05d9\u05e7\u05b0\u05d1\u05b8\u05bc\u05d9 \"Sikhib mati kala mu, *the spoil of the land of every description.*\"\u2014Tablet K 30, l. 21; see my paper in the Transactions of the R.S. of Literature, 'On a War in Syria,' Vol. 8, p. 270.

[the rest is lost].\n\nI think 'rapuit' is connected with 'to sweep away.'\n\n285. Shapi Bel. Name of a city, meaning 'feet of Bel.'\u2014But perhaps it rather means 'the footstool of Bel,' implying the humble and devout submission of the inhabitants. Esar. iv. 3: \"He came and kissed my feet; riemu arsi su, I had pity on him, usarakhits surrati, I gave him a golden bracelet [or, bound him with a chain of honour]. I strengthened the fortifications of the city Shapi-Bel, his fortress. Himself and his spearmen I left in peace within it [as libbi ushali-su]; and I made him like a column-tree [palm tree] of the land of Elam.\" The verb ushali is from 'securus est, et prosper\u00e2 fortun\u00e2 utitur' (Ges.).\n\nEdil su, 'par, \u00e6qualis' (Sch. 1277). It does not appear who was the monarch or chief thus favoured, the commencement of the narrative being broken off. But whoever he was, he or his successor appears to have rebelled, for a tablet of Ashurbanipal, K 30 says \"Dunanu king of the Bulu, who dwelt in the city of Shapi-Bel [spelt as before] allied himself with the king of the Susians and refused to bow down before me.\" After a short war he was taken prisoner by the Assyrians: see p. 272 of my memoir quoted in last article.\n\nI have treated of the word Shabu 'a foot' in Art. 107. It has the plural shapa as well as shapi: see 2 R 16, 31, where the P.C. 'my feet rested not,' is rendered in Assyrian by 14 nikha shapa-ya. Itrapava 'quietus est' is a frequent P.C. word. Here we have the simple Rapava with the same meaning. Nikha is the Heb. nukh 'to take rest.'\n\n286. Khi., the Knees, in Proto-Chald\u00e6an, answering to the Assyrian birki, Heb. \u2014This meaning of was, I think, first pointed out by Norris in his dict. p. 395. I will add a curious example from tablet K, 137, which seems to contain\nprognostics for each month in the year. The son of the king shall kneel at the knees of his father. Here ibar seems to stand for 'ibarak, 'he shall kneel.'\n\n267. Garn. a Horn: plur. Garni, otherwise The same in Heb. 'cornu.'\u2014There is an important invocation to all the great gods on tablet 100. In line 7, 'the Moon' (Lunus) is named with the epithet nash garni birati, carrying great horns. It must be remembered that the images of the Moon which were worshipped were crowned with immense horns, as we see in Egyptian representations of the goddesses Hathor and Isis. So idolaters in Palestine worshipped Ashtaroth Karnaim (Astarte with the two horns).\u2014Genesis xiv. 5. Another example of the word Garn. In 2R38, 52 the images of Marduk and Zarpanita are said to wear agie garni teirati, 'crowns with lofty horns.' In line 71 of same plate Garn is explained by Resh, 'summit.'\n\nIn 2R62, 60, sing. garnus, and plur. garnati, denote the yards of a ship. For, these are called in Latin cornua antennarum, and in Greek \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1, and less frequently, \u03ba\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1.\n\n268. Mi. Night.\u2014A P.C. word (but doubtful). In Syllab.149 we find as if meant musu 'the night.' Tablet 74 somewhat supports this, for we find in it five lines beginning 'days,' and immediately preceding them are six lines beginning with 'nights.' But nevertheless the word remains uncertain. If Mi is really the P.C. for 'night,' (dream) may mean 'Vision of the Night;' whence would mean 'Vision.' And (eclipse) might mean 'divine darkness,' or 'preternatural darkness,' which I believe is Mr. Norris's opinion. In 2R39, in two places, ta, and mi, are explained 'sunrise' and 'sunset.'\n\n269. Milik. Counsel.\u2014Agrees well with the Ch.\n'consilium' (which I think is not found in Hebrew). This word occurs in the interesting inscription on tablet K, 211. This is a public document, or decree, or letters patent, by which Ashurbanipal appoints Bulshaya, a nobleman of the city Kitsi . . . . to the office of governor of the palace. And he says that he does so 'in bibil lib-ya,' from the deep feeling (or desire) of my heart; 'milik ramani,' and from my own impulse (or, of my own counsel.) This is almost exactly what a modern king says when he decrees anything ex motu proprio. The first part of the phrase, 'in bibil lib-ya' is very common in the inscriptions. Norris renders bibil 'deep feeling, desire, wish,' dict. p. 70. The other clause I have not met with elsewhere. Amtallik: 'I resolved,' is the T conjugation of the verb malik 'consulere.' Rabish amtallik, 'I nobly resolved.'\u2014B.M. 41, 25.\n\n270. Izrat. , a Clay Tablet.\u2014From Heb. tsur 'fingere;' the same with the verb figulus, which Gesenius renders 'to mould clay as a potter does,' finxit, formavit (ut figulus lutum), whence figulus 'a potter.' There is an obscure line in Bellino (l. 36) which speaks of the first founders of Niniveh. They laid down, it says, the timia (or corner stone of the foundation). The next phrase is izrat-zu izratu-va, and they formed (or moulded) the clay tablet (or cylinder).\n\nI have found another example of this curious word in the much-defaced tablet 192 (otherwise 151a), which relates the foundation of some new building. The following phrases taken from it, being of familiar occurrence elsewhere, show the general meaning: usalbin libittu's, I made bricks for it; ashli rabati misikhta-su amsukh, with a long rope I measured its measure; ussi-su atdi, I laid its foundations; ukin libnat-zu, and founded the building. Timin-su kireb subuk shadi danni udannin, I made its 'timin' secure within a deposit of vast stones. Here shadi are 'stones,' not even 'rocks,'\nmuch less 'mountains.' The word bears all these senses according to the context and the subject. This last phrase strongly resembles l. 53 of Bellino, which says, speaking of the *timin*: \"with large stones I closed it all round, and (udannin subuk-su) I made its deposit secure.\"\n\nThen comes the phrase which I wish to point out. \n\n\\[ \\text{itzira izrat-zu}, \\] \n*I moulded its clay tablet.* Compared with Bellino 36, the difference is that here the verb is placed first, and takes the form *itzira* instead of *izratu*. *Itziira* is precisely the Heb. verb \u05d9\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0.\n\n271. **Uttu.** \\( \\text{a Parent; also plur. Parents.} \\)\u2014In 2 R 40, 12 the word \\( \\text{Utu is explained by Aladi 'a father, parent, progenitor.' The latter word is very common in the inscriptions, ex. gr. 'abi alidi-ya,' my father.}\\)\n\nExamples of the word *Uttu*. In B.M. 33, 2 Sargina is called 'the noble king, whom Ashur and Marduk, his progenitors (*uttu-su*) have proclaimed the renown of his name to the end of the world.' In R35, king \\( \\text{is called \"the king whom Ashur and (....) his progenitors (*uttu-su*) 'malkut lashanan umallu gat\u00fas-su,' have filled his hand with (i.e. given him) an unequalled empire.\" Here we have malkut 'kingdom.' Utta. also occurs as a verb, 'to create.' \"I am Sargina king of Assyria, &c. &c., whom the gods have created (or caused to be born) nobly amidst the number of kings: yaati Sargina ..... in napkhar maliki kinish utta-annima.\"\u2014Botta, pl. 114, and again in pl. 65, 10. For *utta* other inscriptions give *ibna* 'he created,' or the monogram \\( \\text{which stands for ibna, or for any other tense of the verb 'to create.' I also think that there is a connexion between attu and utdu, which means 'origin' or 'spring;' utdu-a 'a spring of water, or fountain' is very common.}\\)\n\n272. **Mishta.** \\( \\text{Number.\u2014R19, 88: \"I carried off as plunder his flocks of sheep, which, like the stars of heaven, had no number (mishta la isu). This passage is exactly the same as that quoted in No. 76 from R24, 43, except that we}\\)\nread there minuta la i\u0161u. Mi\u0161ta is the Heb. mie\u0161ta \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 'numerus' (Gea. p. 593).\n\n273. Mish. Numerous.\u2014Related, like the last word, to the Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05ea\u05b8\u05d0 'numerus.' Syllab. 139 explains by mahidut (many), and also by the monogram . This is very important, because it shows us plainly the origin of the plural sign , which is composed of two parts, mi, and . In fact it is often written ; see four examples of this in an inscription of Nabonidus, R68, lines 28, 29. This sign for the plural is not used, I think, in Proto-Chaldaean sentences, because mish is a purely Semitic root. The P.C. writers often doubled the word to express the plural; but the Assyrians wrote the word once and then added mish (numerous). Hence we see the reason why the Assyrian inscriptions sometimes substitute the plural sign for the syllable mish.\n\nThus, for the Heb. \u05d7\u05b7\u05de\u05b5\u05bc\u05e9\u05c1 (five) they write , i.e. kha mish (Norris, dict. 432). So also we frequently find ka mish written instead of or kamish 'for ever:' see an example in Norris, dict. 504. This latter word is related to the Hebrew root or \u05e7\u05b8\u05de\u05b5\u05dd 'manere,' 'durare.'\n\n274. Udini. Eagles.\u2014R18, 50. [\"On these pointed and most inaccessible mountains] kima kinni udini-khu as kireb shadie dannat-zun ishkunu, they had built their strongholds like the nests of Eagle-birds among the rocks.\" Udini may be related to the Chald. Din 'vultures;' see Sch. 387; for eagles and vultures had often the same name.\n\n275. Ait. followed by (bird), an Eagle.\u2014This seems to agree well with the Heb. \u05d9\u05b4\u05ea\u05b0\u05e2 a large bird of prey, which as Gesenius says, is cognate with the Greek \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2, and probably the same word. R39, 68: \"I made war on the people of the Toch\u0101rri, whose dwellings were built, like the nests of eagles (kima kinni ait) upon the highest summits and lofty crags of the Nyp\u00fbr mountains.\"\nKinni is the plur. of Heb. Kin \u2018a nest\u2019 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4, which also came to mean (exactly as in our text) a human habitation, perched like a bird\u2019s nest on a lofty and almost inaccessible cliff. Gesenius says, \u2018domicilium in alt\u00e2 rupe extructum instar nidi aquilini,\u2019 quoting several texts of Scripture.\u2014Numb. xxiv. 21, Jerem. xlix. 16, &c. Hence the people called Kenites in Scripture derived their name; see the prophecy of Balaam (Numb. xxiv. 21).\u2014\u201cAnd he looked on the Kenites and took up his parable and said: \u2018Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest (\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05d9\u05b8\u05d4) in a rock. Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted and Assyria shall carry thee away captive.\u201d The latter clause is well illustrated by the passage I have given from Rpl. 39. Smith\u2019s dict. of the Bible v. Kenite does not allude to the origin of the name, which is singular, since a common Bible has the note on Numb. xxiv. 21.\u2014\u2018This alludes to their ordinary habitations, which were strongholds in rocky mountains; hence they are called Kenites or nest-inhabitants.\u2019\n\n276. Khibishti. Beams. (See Art. 186.)\u2014I have since found a Hebrew word which tallies better with the Assyrian, viz. \u05de\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05dc\u05b5\u05d9 \u2018a beam holding together a wooden building.\u2019 (Furst\u2019s Lex.)\n\n277. Dima. Peace, Tranquillity. (See Art. 139.)\u2014In tablet K224 (or 183a) we find \u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05de\u05b8\u05d0 dima explained \u05e1\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05dd salamu or salam \u2018peace,\u2019 which agrees with what I have said in the Art. Salmanubar, No. 211. In same tablet there are some noteworthy translations, of which I will give one. The P.C. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 is rendered by the Assyrian \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 ana pani-ya (before me), where \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 ta answers to the Assyrian \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 ana; \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 mu to the Assyrian pronoun \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 ya (my); and \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 to \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 pani (before). The next line gives us the contrary phrase; where the P.C. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 is rendered by the Assyrian \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 \u05e4\u05b8\u05bc\u05e0\u05b4\u05d9 ana arki-ya (behind me). The similarity of the two phrases is complete (observing that \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 often means ana). Hence I conclude that the P.C. \u05d0\u05b8\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 answers to the Assyrian arki \u2018after\u2019 or \u2018behind.\u2019\n278. T\u0101n \u2014\u2014 When a word is terminated by these three letters, a Numeral is indicated, almost as surely as it would be in Greek by the termination . . . . \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 or . . . . \u03ba\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. For example, the first line of Bellino\u2019s inscription begins with \u0399 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u2018One Sos and three;\u2019 i.e. Sixty-three [lines of writing]. In Opp. Khors. 19, 162 we have \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 Six Sos and fifty, i.e. 410 [talents of shining brass]. On tablet K 268 we read \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 Twenty makalim or inscribed lines (this word probably comes from the Heb. \u05d9\u05b8\u05dc\u05b0\u05d3\u05b5\u05d9 \u2018insculpsit\u2019). But the letter T \u2014\u2014 is sometimes omitted, and only \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 left, to mark a numeral. Of this kind is the important passage which is often repeated in Sargon\u2019s inscriptions, \u201cSha \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 malki labiruti sha illamu-ya billut Ashur-ki ebusu . . . . Of 350 former kings who reigned over Assyria before me [not one ever accomplished such works as I did, &c. &c.]. The origin of this mode of designating numbers is perhaps the following, in which I am guided by the analogy of the Greek and Latin. Duplex, tripes, quadruplex, &c. in Latin; \u03b4\u03b9\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2, &c. in Greek, involve the idea of \u2018folding,\u2019 from plicare. This has been adopted into the English language, \u2018two-fold, three-fold, four-fold,\u2019 &c. So also in German. Plex is used in Latin even when it is quite unnecessary, ex.gr. \u2018quadruplices stellas,\u2019 four stars. It had become habitual, and its original meaning of \u2018folding\u2019 was lost sight of. Now, the Assyrian word-ending t\u0101n \u2014\u2014 appears to be the Ch. and Syr. \u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1, \u2018to fold,\u2019 hence \u2018to do again,\u2019 \u2018to repeat\u2019 (see Wright\u2019s Chaldee glossary to the book of Jonah, p. 45).\n\n279. Tisha. \u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3, Nine.\u2014Agrees perfectly with the Hebrew tesh\u0101 y\u016bn \u2018nine.\u2019 Nevertheless this word has hitherto passed unobserved by Assyriologists. It occurs in a remarkable passage in the inscriptions of Khorsabad (Opp. 19, 163). \u201c\u03a3\u03a4\u03a1\u0399\u03a4\u03a4\u039f\u03a3 timmi irsi sutakhuti, four long beams of Cedar, sha tisha-t\u0101n kubur-sun, which measured nine \u2018kubur\u2019 in length [and\ncame from the mountains of Ham\u00e1na, I placed over the lions at the four gates\u201d].\n\nN.B. There were eight lions in all, which were placed in pairs, on the right and left of each gate. Supposing the kubur to be an opr\u00fca or expansion of the arms, the length of the Cedar beams will be 54 feet. The original text has \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05e8 \u05d5\u05b0\u05d9\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b8\u05d5\u05b6\u05e8.\u2014Kubur is the Heb. \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05b5\u05e8 adj. \u2018longus;\u2019 subst. \u2018longitudo\u2019\u2014also \u05db\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05d1\u05b5\u05e8 a measure of length, so called. The passage which we have been examining is many times repeated in the inscriptions of Khorsabad.\n\n280.

Sanna is evidently the Chald. \u05e1\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 sana \u2018to change.\u2019 The Moon \u05e1\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 was called San or Sin in Assyrian, and the symbol \u05e1\u05b7\u05e0\u05b0\u05e0\u05b8\u05d0 was chosen to denote the sound san, because it meant thirty, the number of days in each month.

I think it means 'Judge.' In the invocation to the great gods (tablet 100) Anu bears the title 'shurbu ilatti, eldest son [of Ashur father of the gods].' In the invocation to Ninev (R17, 2) he is called 'Ilatti bit kur' (child of heaven) just as he is called \\[\\text{aplu bit-khira, son of heaven,}\\] in R70, col. iv. 1.\n\n284. Sutta. \\[\\text{a Dream. (See Art. 241.)\u2014In tablet 140 (or 109a) there is a kakama (or ode, or prayer) to Nebo, in which the following line occurs, \"in mati musi, dimmika, sulti; in the land of Night, sleep, and dreams.\" I think this is a prayer to Nebo, in his character of judge of the dead. The sign has the value dim and salam (which are now found to be equivalents). Dimmika is the Ch. Syr. \\[\\text{dimika 'somnus profundus.' There is much about dreams in tablet K 254 (or 213b). It speaks of 'a good dream' and of 'a god of dreams' called Mashar! But I place little reliance on this, because tablet 155 gives him another name, perhaps Zagar.}\\]\n\nTablet K 273 is devoted to the subject of dreams. The word occurs no less than seventeen times, in a vertical row, followed by various words which are perhaps the things dreamt of. Another example is found in a Gyges tablet K 228, \"tamu suttu annitu emuru, the day that he saw that Vision [he sent an ambassador to me to implore peace].\"\n\n285. \\[\\text{an Eclipse (further remarks, see Art. 98).\u2014In the tablets there are found occasionally a sort of prayers which may be recited during an eclipse of the moon, without reference to any particular occasion, as is evident from the month and day being left blank. Ex. gr. tablet K 223 (or 182a)}\\]\ni.e. during an evil eclipse of the moon in the month (blank), day (blank). Instead of this we find in tablet 155, which is an ode to the moon (I...), the following phrase: During an evil eclipse of the moon which happened in the month ...day ...&c.&c. Now, comparing this with the former example, it seems likely that ...is an indefinite sign, and that the phrase would be in English \u201cwhich happened in month (so and so), day (so and so).\u201d For, no real month and day could bear the same name, and be represented by the same sign. The same symbol occurs in other phrases which are meant to be left indefinite. Ex.gr. in tablet K 163 (or 131a) I, thy servant, (so and so) son of (so and so). (It must be remembered that many of these tablets are mere exercises and formulae of writing.) So, in French, \u2018un tel, fils d\u2019un tel;\u2019 and in Greek \u1f41 \u03b4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2. The symbol and which is its abbreviation, are different from that which is mentioned in this article, and seem to stand for \u2018pakhar\u2019 or \u2018takkil\u2019 (chosen, sealed, approved, or examined). But the study of these signs is intricate.\n\n286. Sikhu. Revolt. Chald. clamour, uproar, especially in public places in towns.\u2014R 41, 5 \u201cAfter Sutzubi revolted;\u201d itsikhu \u2018he revolted.\u2019 Again in l. 12 of the same page, usibnu sikhu, \u2018he raised a revolt.\u2019 In 2 R 52, 25 \u2018revolt in the city of Calah\u2019 (see several other examples in the same plate).\n\n287. Kurunnu. His Own. Their Own.\u2014Lat. proprius. Gr. \u1f34\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2.\u2014This important word appears to have hitherto escaped recognition. It is the Chaldee kurun, \u2018ipse, ipsemet, idem ipse,\u2019 see Sch. 899 and Buxt. 1095. In Opp. Khors. pl. 20, first line, Sargina speaks of the curious and beautiful birds, beasts and fishes, of which he had formed a collection in his new palace. Sattik birds [perhaps parrots psittacus]; Ustur birds [perhaps ostriches, called ustur or shutur-\nbird in Persian]. To these is added the phrase summi izkhit, 'of well-known names,' or 'whose names are well-known.' Then follows Fishes and birds of River and Sea, 'sha la isu midita kurunnu,' which have not any names of their own [and which are found in the lands and waters at the end of the world].\n\nIn the last phrase, correct in Oppert's text into 'and waters,' from Botta, pl. 131, 13. izkhit 'well known,' 'celebrated,' from Ch. and Syr. (see Bernstein lex Syr. p. 144, circumtulit, laudibus extulit, celebravit). Zikhit or izkhit is a participle from this verb.\n\nMidita (names), written I have not met with this word elsewhere. It comes, I think, from vocavit, which is the Arabic 'vocavit' (Ges. 254). But I think this root must be connected with 'to know,' as the Latin nomen is with the verb novit.\n\nI will now give another example of the word Kurunnu; I have several times attempted to elucidate the curious accounts which we find here and there concerning the sittings of an Assyrian Parliament, or rather perhaps what is now called in the East a Durbar. It lasted fourteen days (perhaps an indication that they counted time by weeks). I will at present only advert to the few lines concerning this assembly contained in the inscription of Esarhaddon, col. vi. l. 33 to 45 inclusive. After describing the grandeur of the New Palace which he had just caused to be built at Niniveh, he says: \"There I assembled the great men of my Empire, the noblemen and the commoners of my land, all of them ....... On lofty chairs I caused them to sit, and I counted their numbers. Presidents of their own they chose to rule over them. I did not impose on them any Chief of the Assembly. By the grace of Ashur king of the gods, and the gods of Assyria, all of them, in full assemblies, with intelligent minds, with much honour, and abundant profit may they ever continue to assemble within it! And so may the glory of this\nPalace endure!\" Two of these lines I wish to select for more particular examination, viz. lines 39 and 40:\n\n1. \u1d3d \u1d3f \u1d39 \u1d3a \u1d31 \u1d3f \u1d33 \u1d30 \u1d32 \u1d39 \u1d39 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31\n\n2. \u1d38 \u1d33 \u1d32 \u1d37 \u1d30 \u1d30 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31 \u1d31\n\n1. Tarin? kurunnu bikira tsurra-sun;\n2. Nisak nigut(t) l\u00e1 eli-sun usakin.\n\n1. Officers of their own they chose to rule over them;\n2. A Chief of the assembly I did not impose on them.\n\nLet us examine these words. The first is a slight variation of the common symbol for an officer \u2014 Kurunnu, 'their own.' Bikira 'they chose,' Heb. \u05de\u05b4\u05e6\u05b0\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9 'elegit.' Tsurra, preposition 'over,' is very frequent.\u2014Nisak, Ch. \u05e4\u05b6\u05bc\u05e8\u05b6\u05e5 'princeps.'\n\nNigut is written \u1d33 \u1d31 \u1d31, which has no meaning that I am aware of, but I suspect that the letter \u1d31 ut, has been lost, probably because the two strokes with which it commences blended themselves indistinguishably with the two which terminate the preceding letter \u1d31 \u1d31. Nigut is 'an assembly of the people,' ex. gr. B.M. 34, 20, 'Nigut ashkun,' I held an assembly [and I counted the number of the people of Assyria]. Similarly in Botta, pl. 8, last line, 'ashtakan nigut,' I held an assembly. Usakin is the S conjugation of ukin 'I imposed,' a very common verb.\n\n288. \u1d3a \u1d33 \u1d31, an Envoy, or Representative.\u2014Norris has given one example of the word (dict.p.30). I will add another from Botta, pl. 163, 12: \"[That king] iskhutu, was much terrified? ispa guza iddi, he flung down his sceptre and throne; as pan Akin-ya unasak hakkaru, and kissed the ground before my Envoy. Duri, his fortresses, (....... ) to destroy them, akbi-su, I commanded him. Imgura kibitti, he obeyed my command. Riema arsi su, then I showed him mercy.\" In fact, he performed the Ko-too, as it is called in China, or prostrating\nthe head in the dust before the Emperor's image, or his envoy. One or two words are effaced. Perhaps we should read 'ana napali akbi-su,' to throw them down I gave command; as in Art. Napal, No. 223.\n\n289. Ussha. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, the Foundations of a Building.\u2014Chal. \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, Ezra iv. 12. We find also \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97, fundamenta dom\u00fbs.\u2014Isaiah xvi. 7. This word is extremely common, but its spelling varies very much. In B.M. 33, 17, and R42, 61, and R50, 21, and Monolith l. 11, it is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Ussha. In Sarg. 51 it is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Usshae. In Tig. vi. 29 and Sarg. 61 it is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Ussi. In B.M. 33, 14 and Opp. Khors. line 132 it is \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 Ussu.\n\nThis word occurs continually in the phrase \"from its foundation even unto its summit I built it and I finished it.\" I will add two examples, in which the word has been overlooked. Sarg. 61 speaks of the first foundation of Niniveh: \"The god Ninev, who laid the timin and the ussi of its shalkhu [citadel] in ancient times, now long past.\" Ninev mukin timin ad'ussi ana labar tami rukuti shalkhu-su. Adussi \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 is only a rapid pronunciation of \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 (and the foundations). Adi \ud808\udc97\ud808\udc97 often signifies 'and,' see Norris, dict. 18.\u2014The other example occurs in the account of the nocturnal escape of Merodach Baladan from the besieged city of Dur-Yakina (see Opp. Khors. 15, 132); I have already translated a portion of it in Art. 120 of this Glossary. Edish ipparsidu, he escaped alone; dikhi dur-su izbatu, clinging to the front wall of his palace; kima suratsa, like a lizard (or reptile); eruba (......), and reached (......) [the last word is injured]. To this translation it has been objected that the text, as published by Oppert, gives surani and not suratsa, instead of suratsa. But these signs are often mistaken one for the other in the published texts, and even in the originals. And I think that the word suratsa (Heb. \u05e8\u05b7\u05e2\u05b2\u05e9\u05c1\u05d5\u05b9 a reptile) occurs twice in 2R17, which is a prayer against all manner of evils. At line 24 we read sharatzu muruz, from\ndangerous serpents; marti muruz, from their dangerous venom; [may the gods of heaven and earth protect us!]. I will first consider the word \\( \\text{marti} \\), 'poison.' This is the Ch. Syr. and Arab. \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9 or \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d8\u05b7\u05d0 marta, the poison of a serpent [Sch. 1033 venenum serpentinum]. In Job xx. 14 we read \u05de\u05b8\u05e8\u05b0\u05d8\u05b4\u05d9 \u05e4\u05b0\u05ea\u05b5\u05d9\u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd 'the poison of asps or vipers.' Muruz 'dangerous,' occurs often in this plate; it is nearly the same as marza and marusta, see Art. 240. The sign \\( \\text{shar} \\) has often the value shar, see an instance which I have given in Art. 201, where \\( \\text{sharut} \\) reads sharut. But instead of \\( \\text{sharatzu} \\) 'reptile,' the P.C. version of this passage has \\( \\text{suratsi} \\). I therefore think that \\( \\text{kima suratsa} \\), 'like a reptile,' is the true reading in Opp. Khors. 132. Let us now go on with the rest of the passage. The last clause is eruba, 'he reached,' \\( \\text{I} \\), which gives no sense. But Norris observes (dict. p. 34) that the letter \\( \\text{di} \\) is 'half gone,' and he proposes to read \\( \\text{li} \\) instead of it. I think, however, that we should read \\( \\text{di} \\), which gives an excellent sense. Eruba 'he reached' \\( \\text{adi usu} \\) 'unto the bottom, or basement of the building.' The whole passage then becomes exceedingly clear. \"He escaped alone, clinging to the front wall of his palace, like a reptile (or lizard). And he reached the bottom in safety.\" It appears to me that my version of 'the king's escape' is greatly confirmed by these words \"adi usu,\" discovered after the translation was published; much more so than if they had been seen at first; because subsequent corroboration are always more valuable. The next clause after this commences a new subject. \"I took the city of Dur-Yakina with immense spoil and many captives\u2014I burnt it down\u2014I carried off its timin or foundation-tablet ['corner stone,' Opp.] and I left it a heap of ruins.\"\n\n290. Ussish. \\( \\text{ussish} \\), adv. 'from the foundations.' \"Ussish ebus, I built [that temple] from the foundations.\" Nabon. II, 1 (R 68). Derived from ussha, see last article.\n291. \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u039a\u03cd\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, Cyprus.\u2014But the name is much more like the \u039a\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9, the inhabitants of Cos. Can it be that the race of the Koi originally spread over all the islands of the \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd, and that they are the Gu-i, \u05d2\u05d5\u05d9\u05d9, of the Hebrews, commonly translated \u2018gentiles\u2019?\n\nNo certain etym is known for the \u0391\u1f30\u03b3\u03b1\u03af\u03b1\u03bd sea (\u03a4\u03bf \u1f08\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd, Herod.). But its islands were called in the Hebrew (see Gen. x. 5) \u05d9\u05b8\u05dd \u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05b0\u05d4\u05b7\u05d2\u05b0\u05bc\u05d3\u05b9\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05dd, which in Greek letters, and making the change which the Greek language requires, differs but little from \u0391\u03c5\u03b3\u03b1\u1fd6\u03bf\u03bd. The Phoenician sailors may have given the name and the Greek sailors adopted it.\n\nThe recently discovered bilingual inscription called the Decree of Canopus speaks (l. 9) of \u201cthe country of Kaft.\u201d This is translated in the Greek \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7, Ph\u0153nicia. This throws a new light on the name of that ancient people. For, why was Ph\u0153nicia called \u201cthe land of Kaft\u201d? Nothing can be simpler. Kaft signifies a Palm-tree, which was the chosen emblem of that country. The Greeks translated the name. In their language a palm-tree was \u03c6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03be; they therefore called the country \u03a6\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7. \u03a0\u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03b7 or \u03a0\u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03b7 has two meanings in Hebrew, (1) Palma, i.e. a Palm-tree; (2) Palma, i.e. the Hand. The Latin word has the same double meaning, which is an interesting fact; but what is still more curious is that \u03b4\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03c2 \u2018fingers\u2019 also mean \u2018dates\u2019 (the fruit of the date-palm). See Arist. Meteor. i. 4, 10. Hence modern botanists call the date palm Ph\u0153nix dactylifera. But lexicographers, being seldom botanists, have not understood why a \u2018hand\u2019 and a \u2018palm-tree\u2019 had the same name. The reason is this\u2014the common palm of the Mediterranean coasts is a low-growing shrub whose leaves are digitate, i.e. they expand like the fingers of the hand from a central origin somewhat like a fan, and therefore called the \u2018fan palm\u2019 (Chamaerops Humilis of botanists). This common sort gave the name to the whole tribe of palm trees. In Is. ix. 13 and xix. 15, \u2018high and low\u2019 or \u2018noblemen and common people\u2019 are poetically called kaft u agmon, i.e. \u2018the palm-tree and the rush\u2019 (Gesenius).\nART. II.\u2014On Indian Chronology. By J. Fergusson, Esq., F.R.S.\n\n[Read February 15, 1869.]\n\nEvery one who has turned his attention to the study of Indian antiquities will probably be inclined to admit that one of the most important desiderata at the present time is a scheme of Chronology which shall fix, within reasonable limits of error, the dates of the various kings or dynasties who ruled between the Christian Era and the Hegira. It is not at present indispensable that any particular king's reign should be ascertained within ten or twenty years of deviation either way; but it is hopeless to attempt to understand the subject while we cannot make up our minds whether the Balabhi kings dated their inscriptions from their own Era or from that of Vikram\u0101ditya\u2014a difference of 376 years\u2014or whether the Guptas dated theirs before or after the Era bearing their name (318\u201319 A.D.). While such discrepancies as these exist, it is idle to suppose we can either understand the history of the Hindus, or appreciate the forms of their arts, or the development of their religions.\n\nFinding that such men as Lassen, Cunningham, Thomas, and Dowson among living investigators\u2014to say nothing of those who have passed away\u2014agreed to differ by such wide margins, I believed the problem insoluble with the means now at our command, and felt inclined to wait some happy discovery which might free us from our perplexity. When, however, I undertook to write my recently published work on the Topes of Sanchi and Amravati, I found it necessary to go over all the available data with more care than I had hitherto bestowed on them, and the result has been, that the conviction was forced on me that the books we now possess, combined with the coins that have been collected and the inscriptions that have been translated, do suffice for the construction of a\nchronological table for the period above indicated, which may be sufficiently accurate for present purposes, at least, though not absolutely correct in detail.\n\nNotwithstanding this, I am far from pretending that I consider the task easy, or that everything I am about to advance will appear as clear to others as to myself, or that future discoveries may not modify some of the data on which my conclusions are based. Indeed, when I see such a man as Professor Lassen, with all his vast learning and untiring industry, fail in the task, I cannot but feel some hesitation in attempting it. That he has failed, and failed entirely, I, at least, feel certain, because in what I am now about to put forward I differ from him in every date\u2014almost without an exception\u2014and if he is right in his mode of reasoning, I certainly am wrong throughout. A great deal, however, of the discrepancy that exists between us may, I believe, be accounted for by the fact that the Professor is entirely ignorant of both architecture and archaeology as applied to the subject.\\(^1\\) I am sorry to think he is far from being singular in this respect, while I, on the other hand, feel certain that in such a case as India, the architectural remains are in most cases the best, and in some, the only evidence that is available for the determination of either historical or ethnographical problems. All this has become more and more evident every day since the investigation was first attempted; and now that we know absolutely that stone architecture commenced, in India, under the reign of A\u1e63oka, we have a fixed initial date from which to start. From that point we can trace it, as bit by bit the original wooden forms were replaced by others of more lithic character, till a perfectly original style of stone architecture was elaborated; and we only require a final and one or two intermediate dates to enable us to graduate our chronometric scale, and, by its application, to fix within narrow limits the date of any king whose name happens to be engraved on any cave or temple in the\n\n\\(^1\\) In the whole 6000 pages to which his Indische Alterthumskunde extends, less than 50 are devoted to this subject, and they are the mere jottings of his note-book, printed without system or arrangement, as things that must be alluded to in an encyclopaedic work like his, but as of very little value for any purpose.\nland. In addition to this, combined, as architecture always is in India, with sculpture and painting, it affords by far the best test of the ethnography of races, and the most vivid picture of the religion and civilization. All this is unsuspected by Professor Lassen, and, indeed, by most investigators; but till it is grasped and elucidated, the history of medi\u00e6val India must always, I fear, remain the confused jumble it now unfortunately presents.\n\nAs many of the more important conclusions arrived at in the following pages are derived from a careful study of Hiouen-Thsang, and the Chinese travellers who visited India in the seventh century, it will be convenient to begin at that end of the story, and having gained a firm base there, to work backwards. In order to do this, however, it is first necessary to fix the dates of their travels as nearly as possible. This can be done with some precision from the \"Histoire de la vie de Hiouen-Thsang par Hoe\u00ef-li,\" translated by Stanislas Julien, and published in Paris, 1853.\u00b9 The other work, entitled \"M\u00e9moires sur les contr\u00e9es occidentales,\" or the \"Si-yu-ki,\" translated by the same author, and published 1857, also affords considerable assistance in this enquiry.\n\nAccording to the Hoe\u00ef-li, Hiouen-Thsang left China in the year 629, in the 26th year of his age,\u00b2 and reached Kashmir apparently in the following year.\u00b3 Here he resided two years,\u2074 and, if we add together all the indications in the work, seems to have taken, at least, two years to reach N\u00e2landa; but being interrogated there how long he had been on his travels, he replies, three years.\u2075 Assuming this to mean in India, it would place his first visit there in 633-4. Here he resided five years,\u2076 and then set out on his travels south, 638-9. Two years were so occupied, and he returned to N\u00e2landa 640-41. The latter date is fixed by a story he himself tells. He narrates that, while there, a man appeared to him in a vision and told him\n\n\u00b9 In the text I purpose to distinguish these works as the Hoe\u00ef-li, the other as the Si-yu-ki; but in the notes it will suffice, as is done in the French, to call the first, vol. i.; and the second, vols. ii. and iii. of H.T., as short for Hiouen-Thsang.\n\u00b2 H.-T. i. 14.\n\u00b3 H.-T. i. 90.\n\u2074 96.\n\u2075 147.\n\u2076 171.\nthat, in ten years from that time, the King \u015ail\u0101ditya would die, and his biographer adds that this event took place in 650;\u00b9 but for this, I would be inclined to place his second visit to N\u0101landa in 642-3, because the great meeting at Allahabad\u00b2 took place when he was there, and the narrative would lead us to suppose that immediately after it was over, he returned straight to China. If this is so, his journey could hardly have occupied one year, and he reached his native land in 645.\u00b3\n\nIf we felt certain that the dates in the two works above referred to were abstracted from his note-books as he wrote them down during his journey in India, it would be very important to try and settle these points definitively; but as we do not feel sure that they were not inserted by himself or his editors after his return to China, all that is requisite here is to call attention to it. It is an element of uncertainty which may necessitate an adjustment of dates to the extent of a few years in some instances. In the following pages I purpose to assume the dates referring to particular places as written in India in the years in which he visited these places, as above indicated.\n\nBefore proceeding to examine the data given us by the Chinese travellers, there are two remarks it may be useful to make in order to render what follows more intelligible. The first is that in India there were three ranks of kings. First, R\u0101jas, or simple princes; Mah\u0101-R\u0101jas, who would rank as kings in Europe; and Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101jas, kings of kings, or emperors. The title is identical with \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1f7a\u03c2 \u0392\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9\u03bd of the Greeks, or Shahan Shahi of the Persians, and was used in India from the Greek times till probably the Mahomedan conquest. This would hardly be worthy of remark, but for one circumstance. There might be any number of R\u0101jas or Mah\u0101r\u0101jas contemporary with one another, but only one Adhir\u0101ja or Emperor could exist at one time. The consequence is, that whenever we find a king adopting this title, we know that he was, or at least, assumed to be king of the five Indies,\n\n\u00b9 H.-T. i. 215. \u00b2 252. \u00b3 292.\ndivisions, which would correspond very nearly with the four Presidencies into which we have divided India, if the Nizam's and surrounding states were erected into a fifth. The consequence of this is that no two emperors could be contemporary with one another, and that whenever we can trace the dignity from a king in one family to one in another, we know that we have a true succession, and an historical sequence of the utmost importance. Sometimes these emperors resided in Magadha, at other times at Canouge or Ougein, and at one time at Kalyan,\u2014but always in succession; and I hope to be able to trace the title, at least, from the second half of the fourth century till 733, which last is the lower limit to which I at present intend to extend my researches.\n\nThe second point to which I wish to draw attention, is the practice of Indian kings to assume the names of their grandfathers, when they have been illustrious. In some lists, like the Balabhi and Ch\u00e2lukya, this constant alternation of name is sometimes very perplexing, as no number or other distinguishing mark is affixed as would be done in Europe. In other cases, however, it is sometimes useful; as when we find two kings of the same name occurring very near each other in the same list, we may feel pretty sure that the latter stood in the relation of the second generation to the first, and this occurs even when the seat of power was changed, if the succession was direct.\n\nWe shall have frequent occasions to refer to these peculiarities in the sequel, but the first name with which I propose to deal is as good an example as could be found for illustrating them.\n\nDuring the whole time that Hiouen-Thsang was in India, \u0160il\u00e2ditya was on the throne of Canouge, then the principal kingdom in the north of India. The date of his death has already been given as 650, but if we may trust Ma-twan-lin, this should be slightly modified. He relates that when the Emperor of China, in the year 648, sent an ambassador to Magadha, he found that king \u0160il\u00e2ditya was dead, and his minister, O-lo-na-shun, had taken his place. It is possible.\n\n1 J.A.S.B. vol. vi. p. 69.\nthis may have been in 649, so the difference is not much. The date of his accession may be fixed as closely. Hiouen- Thsang tells us\u2014in the first instance not very distinctly\u2014 that he had reigned thirty years at the time of his visit; but he afterwards confirms this by quoting a speech of the king himself to our pilgrim, on his taking leave of him on his return to China (640). On this occasion the king expressly states that he had reigned thirty years, and confirms it by stating that it had been his habit to hold a great assembly every five years. He had held five such, and now invited Hiouen- Thsang to assist at the sixth. We may, therefore, safely date his accession in 610. From Hiouen-Thsang, but more especially from the Ch\u00e2lukya inscriptions, we learn that \u0160il\u0101ditya was engaged in a life-long struggle for dominion with Pulake\u015bi, the founder of the kingdom of Kalyan, who succeeded in establishing his power in Central India the year before \u0160il\u0101ditya\u2019s accession, or in 609.\n\nThese wars are graphically described by Ma-twan-lin. \u201cIn the years 618 and 627,\u201d he says, \u201cthere were great troubles in the kingdom. The King \u0160il\u0101ditya made war and fought such battles as had never been seen before. The elephants were not unsaddled in their rapid marches, the soldiers quitted not their shields, because the King had formed the project of uniting the four Indias under his rule. All the provinces which faced the north submitted to him.\u201d But from this admission it is clear that Pulake\u015bi still held his own in the south; we now understand why \u0160il\u0101ditya was forced to forego the title of Adhir\u0101ja, and how Pulake\u015bi was entitled to claim it, as he does in his inscriptions, as we see presently.\n\nAlthough both our Chinese authorities call this King throughout their narratives \u0160il\u0101ditya, both in the Hoe\u00ef-li and Si-yu-ki, it is stated categorically, \u201cLe roi actuel est de la caste de Vai\u1e63yas\u201d\u2014\u201cson nom,\u201d or \u201cil a pour surnom\n\n---\n\n1 H.-T. ii. 251.  \n2 H.-T. i. p. 251.  \n3 H.-T. i. 203.  \n4 J.B.B.R.A.S. iii. 203 et seqq.  \n5 Madras Journal, xx. p. 81; J.R.A.S. xx. 258.  \n6 J.A.S.B. vi. 68; H.T. ii. 251.  \n7 H.-T. i. 111.  \n8 H.-T. ii. 247.\nHarehaverddhana,\" and he is so designated by Pulakesi; nor is it difficult to see why he changed it. His grand-\nfather was \u015ail\u0101ditya of Malwa, whom Hiouen-Thsang de-\nscribes in such glowing terms as a good and excellent Buddhist\nking.\\(^1\\) The latter reigned fifty years, viz., from 530 to 580.\\(^2\\)\n\nBetween these two \u015ail\u0101dityas, were two reigns. First,\nthat of \u015ail\u0101ditya's elder brother, who was slain by \u015aa\u015banka,\nKing of Karn\u0101 Souvar\u1e47a (apparently part of Burdwan and\nBancorah), in 610; and the father of these two brothers, Pra-\nbh\u0101kara-varddhana.\\(^3\\) We have no means of apportioning the\nthirty years at our disposal between these two, but we shall\nprobably not err far in giving twenty-five years to the first\nand five to the second. We may also feel tolerably certain\nthat no other king intervened between the two \u015ail\u0101dityas,\nnot only in consequence of the name, but because Prabh\u0101-\nkara is expressly called by the ministers of his son \"notre\npremier roi.\"\\(^4\\)\n\nBefore \u015ail\u0101ditya of Malwa we come to the celebrated\nVikram\u0101ditya of Ougein, who figures so largely in all the\nmythical histories of the Hindus. It is true we only learn\nthis inferentially from Hiouen-Thsang. He calls him King\nof \u015ar\u0101vasti,\\(^5\\) but as the transaction to which his story relates\ntook place in the north of the Punjab, then under his rule, it\nis evident he was King, at least, of northern India, and the\naccount which Hiouen-Thsang gives of his splendour and\nextravagance, clearly identifies him with the Hindu hero.\nWe learn also, notwithstanding all our author says of him,\nthat he was of the Brahminical faith,\u2014inasmuch as he\nallowed his priests so to oppress Manorhita that he cut out\nhis tongue, or had it cut out for him, which is more pro-\nbable. He then goes on to tell us how his memory was\navenged by Vasubandhu, in the reign of a good and pious\nprince, the successor of Vikram\u0101ditya, who can hardly be\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) H.-T. i. 204.  \n\\(^2\\) H.-T. i. 205.  \n\\(^3\\) H.-T. i. 112; ii. 247.  \n\\(^4\\) H.-T. ii. 248.

It is quite true all this is not stated by Hiouen-Thsang so consecutively that it would stand examination in a court of law; but I think any one reading his volume carefully would admit that it is the most probable version of the story. The proof of it, however, and of the earlier names in the subjoined list, rests in the evidence of the R\u0101ja-Tarangini, and other authorities, to which we will refer presently. Meanwhile, I propose to adopt the following as a tentative chronology of the period.\n\n**Vasudeva.**\n\n| Cotem.

The first three names stand at present as mere conjectures.\n\n**Balabhi and Ch\u0101lukya Dynasties.**\n\nThe two dynasties whose dates we next propose to examine, are almost wholly unknown to Indian literary history, and we should hardly know of their existence\u2014certainly not of their importance\u2014had it not been for a fortunate propensity they had to perpetuate their own glory and goodness by inscribing their history on copper plates when making grants to Brahmins and others.

This he afterwards supplemented in the twentieth volume of the Madras Journal, and Major \u2014now General\u2014Le Grand Jacob has added immensely to our stores of knowledge regarding them, in the third volume of the Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Asiatic Society. Fortunately, the Ch\u00e2lukyas dated all their inscriptions in the \u0160aka era, so there is no dispute whatever about their dates, except in the case of Pulakesi I.\n\nThe Balabhi branch were not so fortunate. Their copper plate grants were first brought to light by Mr. Wathen, in the Journal of the Bengal Asiatic Society, in August, 1835. At first, the figured date of the plate first published was taken for 9, and then assumed to be in the Balabhi Samvat, 318; but when it turned out to be really 330, he and all other chronologers since have made up their minds that it must date from the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat (57 B.C.).\u00b9\n\nMy conviction is, the idea of dating the copper-plate grants from the Vikram\u0101ditya Samvat, would never have occurred to anyone had it not been for a mythical history of Balabhi which Colonel Tod obtained from Jaina sources, and unfortunately published in his Annals.\u00b2 Without dwelling on the earlier parts of this myth, the great fact he seeks to establish is that Balabhi was destroyed by the Parthians, 524 A.D., in the reign of a \u0160il\u0101ditya, its last king. Its inhabitants were slaughtered with the usual romantic incidents; but after a while a remnant established themselves in Sidhapore, and finally built a new capital, which they called Anhulwara.\u2014!\n\nThe utter falsehood of the information so supplied to Colonel Tod is proved by the fact, that when Balabhi was visited by Hiouen-Thsang, 115 years after its reputed destruction, he found it not only standing, and neither Sidhapore or Anhulwara thought of, but the old capital still remaining the richest and most prosperous city of India, and its king one of the three greatest kings of northern India.

Against this view of the case I cannot find one single argument that will stand examination, since I think there is no doubt that we must put on one side those derived from Tod\u2019s statements, which have just been shown to be worthless. In addition to this, it may be remarked that nothing can well be more improbable than that the kings of Balabhi, reigning in that city, should employ any other Samvat than their own. This era was sufficiently important and well known to be quoted as one of the principal eras of India in the Somnath inscription in 1263,\\(^3\\) A.D., and was also quoted in the same sense by Albir\u00fbn\u00ee in the eleventh century.\\(^4\\) If it was known and quoted as important so long afterwards, it does seem inconceivable that it should not have been used by the Balabhi kings themselves. I may add that the style of composition, and the evidence of the character, all seem to me, in so far as I can judge, to indicate the seventh century, though that may be a matter of opinion.\n\nTo this we will return presently; but, meanwhile, assuming that all the Balabhi grants are in the local era, we have, according to Wathen, for \u0160ri-Dharasena I., the date \\(330 = 648\\);\\(^5\\) or according to Bhau Daji,\\(^6\\) Dharasena I., \\(310 = 628\\) A.D. We have, according to the longest list, six names before \u0160ri-Dhara to Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka, the progenitor of the race, and allowing twenty years to each, which is more than they probably are entitled to, this would take us back to 528\\(^7\\) for the earliest date of the Balabhi dynasty, if we adopt Wathen\u2019s date, or 508 if Bhau Daji\u2019s. By the same calculation from Dhruva we can only stretch them back-\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) H.-T. i. 206; iii. 162, H.T. loc.\n\\(^2\\) J.B.B.R.A.S., vol. viii. 245.\n\\(^3\\) Tod\u2019s Annals, vol. i., p. 801.\n\\(^4\\) Thomas\u2019 Prinsep, i. p. 269, etc.\n\\(^5\\) Thomas loc.\n\\(^6\\) J.B.B.

The third, Drona, had the dignity of king conferred upon him by the Lord Paramount of India in 550 (?), who in that case would be \u015ail\u0101ditya of Malwa, which may account for their fondness for that name. Was he his nephew as mentioned above? One only assumed the title of Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja\u2014\u015ar\u012b-Dharasena III., and that after 648, of whom more hereafter.\n\nWhen we come to the southern branch of this family, we find a state of things singularly confirmatory of the above, and luckily, as these dates are in the \u015aaka era, there is no ambiguity about them. Although Sir Walter Elliot\u2019s lists are the fullest, those of Le Grand Jacob are the most satisfactory, and as he gives translations in full of the inscriptions he uses, we learn from them several particulars of considerable interest.\n\nAs the best mode of explaining their history, I quote at length their style and titles as gathered from the Yev\u016br grants, and an abstract of one of the inscriptions, which gives a clear abstract of their history:\n\nAncestor of the race.\nH\u0101r\u012bti descended from Manu.\n\u015ar\u012b Pulakesi Vallabha, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.\n\u015ar\u012b K\u0101rttivarma Prithivi Vallabha, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.\nSaty\u0101\u015braya \u015ar\u012b Prithivi Vallabha, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja\nAdhir\u0101ja Paramesvara. 609.\n\n\u015ar\u012bndr\u0101ditya (or the name would more correctly appear to be \u015ar\u012b Chandr\u0101ditya) Prithivi Vallabha Mah\u0101r\u0101ja.\n\nVikram\u0101ditya Saty\u0101\u015braya \u015ar\u012b Prithivi Vallabha Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101ja Paramesvara Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka.\n\nVinay\u0101ditya Saty\u0101\u015braya \u015ar\u012b Prithivi Vallabha, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101ja Paramesvara Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka. 680.\n\nVijay\u0101ditya Saty\u0101\u015braya \u015ar\u012b Prithivi Vallabha, Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101ja Paramesvara Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka. 695.\n\nVikram\u0101ditya II. 733.\n\n1 J. R. A. S., vol. iv. p. 1, et seq. Madras Journal, xx., 78 et seq.\nThe following extract from one of their inscriptions fills up the details of their history, in so far as it is necessary for our present purposes:\n\nThis race was ornamented by the great king Pulakesi Vallabha who purified himself by the sacrifice of a horse, and consequent abluent rites. His son, the great king Kirttivarma, lord of the earth, having subdued and forced all his enemies to take refuge in forests, etc., firmly implanted his pure fame amongst them. His son Satyaditya, lord of the earth, and king of kings, much devoted to war, and to whom all kings paid homage, gained by the defeat of Sri Harshavardhan, hero of the northern countries, the name of Paramedvara. His beloved son, Vikramaditya, father of intelligent sons, lord of the earth and king of kings, desirous of supremacy, supported by a harmonious brotherhood, whose lotus-like feet were kissed by the crown of the despotic king of Kanchi, subdued all his rivals on one horse alone, the excellent Chitra-Kandha. His beloved son Vinayaditya, lord of the earth and king of kings, desirous of supremacy, disabled as Tarakarati (i.e. Skanda) did the Daityas the insolent forces or Dharmajaya king of Kanchi; he made the rulers of the islands, Kumera, Parasika, Sinhabha, etc., pay him tribute and gradually acquired the full symbol of supremacy, (Padidhvaja, etc.) by the overthrow of the kings of the northern countries. His beloved son Vijayaditya, lord of the earth, and king of kings, desirous of supremacy, attained, even in his childhood, the whole science of rendering weapons efficacious by charms. His grandfather (Vikramaditya) had conquered the kings of the South, but he exterminated all of them who were inimical to him, and after the death, in battle, of his father (Vinayaditya), who made conquest of the northern countries, he, moving about at will, got his scymitars' edge blunted by the slaughter of his enemies' numerous elephants. He, foremost in battle, ardent in noble enterprises, made all his enemies subject to him. No sooner did he hear of anarchy than he left his house, like Vatsaraj (i.e. Udayana of the solar race) relying on his own power, removed this source of misery in the country, and the excess of every vice, which had arisen from the oppression of Brahmins, a royal calamity; giving protection to all his subjects by the strength of his arms. He is arbitrary, at all times possessed of the three royal attributes (i.e. Bravery, Policy, and Energy). He humbled the pride of his enemies, but he himself cannot be mastered. He is spotless, and for all this is become all the world's support. His dominions, adorned by all the symbols of supremacy (Padidhvaja, etc.) are extensive. He commands thus. \"Be it known to you that we, in Saka 627, (A.D. 705,) the tenth current year, Pravardhaman of Vinayaditya's reign, at the request of Dupendra, granted Kumara, in the country Mahaseptami, to the best and amiable Brahmins, inhabitants of the village of Hikudhamba, who have penetrated through the Vedas and their branches.\"\u00b9\n\nThe only doubtful date in the above list is that of Pulakesi I. Sir W. Elliot states that he has seen an inscription or grant of his, bearing the date of Saka 411,\u00b2 (A.D. 489) though he himself feels so little confidence in this, that four pages further on he proposes to bring him down to 610; no such violent ad-\n\n\u00b9 J.B.B.R.A.S., iii. p. 206, et seqq. \u00b2 J.R.S., vol. iv. p. 8.\njustment however seems necessary. But if Pulake\u015bi I. was the grandfather of the second king of that name, which all the inscriptions assert, and which there seems no reason to doubt, not only from the name being the same, but from the details given, it becomes morally impossible that he should be reigning in 489, and his grandson succeed in 609. The latter date we may look on as fixed within very narrow limits, not only from the inscriptions, but from Hiouen-Thsang\u2019s testimony quoted above, and I cannot help suspecting that the 411 is a mislection or a wilful alteration from 511. Assuming that he died in 590, this would give nineteen years for the joint reign of the two brothers, K\u012brttivarma and Mangal\u012bsa,\\(^1\\) and if we allow fifty or sixty years for the first three names on our list, the accession of Jaya Sinha would be in 530 or 540, or, in round numbers, very nearly the date we reached for the Balabhi branch of the family. Of course adjustments of this sort are open to correction to a considerable extent, as we choose to assume a longer or shorter index for a king\u2019s reign; but my conviction is that Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka, the progenitor of both those two illustrious races, attained manhood within the limits of the sixth century, and most probably his title of Sen\u0101pati not before 528.\n\nWe are nowhere told how long Pulake\u015bi II. lived; he was alive and vigorous when Hiouen-Thsang visited him in 638-9, and may have lived for ten or twenty years afterwards. On his death, however, the glory of his line was for a while eclipsed. Sir W. Elliot introduces two f\u00e9neant kings, Amara and \u0100ditya\u2014who are entirely omitted in General Jacob\u2019s inscriptions. Instead of these we have a Chandr\u0101ditya, who did not take his father\u2019s title of Adhir\u0101ja. This, however, was resumed by his successor, who was his younger son and named Vikram\u0101ditya. He died 680, but unfortunately we are not told when he commenced his reign. If we allow him twenty years it would take us back to 660, which, for\n\n\\(^1\\) In the genealogy above quoted, General Jacob, by some oversight, omits Mangal\u012bsa, though his third inscription is by him, and fully confirms all we learn from the others. In it mention is made \u201cShankaraga\u2019s son Budha R\u0101j\u0101.\u201d The first probably being the \u015aa\u015banka, who, according to Hoei-li (112) killed R\u0101javardhana, of Canouge. This inscription unfortunately is not dated.\nreasons to be given hereafter, may be near the mark. The two following kings also bore the title of Adhir\u0101ja, till the pride of the house was finally extinguished in the reign of a second Vikram\u0101ditya, who succeeded to them in 733.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe question, therefore is, who was the Adhir\u0101ja, who dispossessed Pulake\u015bi\u2019s eldest son? My impression is we have not far to seek. \u015ar\u012b-Dharasena III. alone of the Balabhi kings assumed the title, and though we cannot fix his date with absolute precision it was certainly after 330\u2013648, and before \u015ail\u0101ditya II., whose date appears to have been 338\u2013348, or 656\u201366, which is exactly the gap we wish to fill up.\\(^2\\)\n\nWe are thus enabled to complete our list of Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101jas, from the accession of the great Vikram\u0101ditya in 590 (?), till it passed from the feeble hands of a successor of the same name, 733, or say, without a break for 150 years, thus:\n\n| M.A. | Vikram\u0101ditya of Malwa | - | - | 490 |\n|------|----------------------|---|---|-----|\n| ,,   | \u015ail\u0101ditya do.        | - | - | 530 |\n| ,,   | Prabh\u0101rakara of Canouge | - | - | 580 |\n| ,,   | R\u0101ja Varddhana       | - | - | 605 (?) |\n| ,,   | Pulake\u015bi II. of Kalyan | - | - | 609 |\n| ,,   | \u015ar\u012b-Dharasena III. of Balabhi | - | - | 650 (?) |\n| ,,   | Vikram\u0101ditya of Kalyan | - | - | 660 (?) |\n| ,,   | Vinay\u0101ditya do.      | - | - | 680 |\n| ,,   | Vijay\u0101ditya do.      | - | - | 695 |\n| ,,   | Vikram\u0101ditya II.     | - | - | 733 |\n\nBefore leaving the family, it is necessary to say a few words about another branch of them, who are mentioned in a copper-plate translated by Professor Dowson in the 1st vol. new series of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society. In this grant we have the names, Jaya Sinha, his son Buddha var\u1e47a, and Vijaya Raja Sarva. As no such name occurs in any of Sir Walter Elliot\u2019s lists as the second name here, and no such sequence anywhere, either in his or General Jacob\u2019s, we may safely assume that this is a new family altogether. Besides this, the locality is altogether different, all the grants of the great Ch\u0101lukya family are found south of the Nerbuddha. This was found at Kaira in Gujerat.\n\n\\(^1\\) Madras Journal xx., p. 81.  \n\\(^2\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. viii., 245.\nAfter what has been said above, there can be little doubt of the Samvat in which it is dated; for, as the Professor says, \"to decide the era of one, is to settle that of all.\"\u00b9\n\nThe date of this being S. 394, its date is A.D. 712, and the donors were evidently a branch of the great Kalyan family, which was then at the height of its prosperity.\n\nOne curious point regarding this grant, which is very misleading, and seems to have misled the Professor, is the constant recurrence of the same name in the same family. Thus Jaya Sinha, the first named here, is the same as the first of the Kalyan branch, nearly two centuries earlier; and the last is identical with the third of the same name, who began to reign in Kalyan 695, and was contemporary with this very king, as he died 733.\u00b2 If nominal similarities were of any use in such an inquiry, we might be justified in assuming they were the same persons. The names of their fathers were, however, different, and the one was a simple Mah\u0101r\u0101ja, the other a Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101ja; and we must consequently reject the synonym. It is a trap, however, which will frequently occur in the sequel, and cannot be too carefully guarded against.\n\n**R\u0101ja-Tarangin\u012b.**\n\n**Kings of Kashmir.**\n\n| Hushka | Gokarna. |\n|---------|----------|\n| Jushka | Narendraditya. |\n| Kanisika | Yudhishthira. |\n| Abhimanyu, 21 A.D. |\n\n**Gonardya Dynasty.**\n\n| Gonarda. | Naga worshipped. |\n| Vibhishana. |\n| Indrajita. |\n| Ravana. |\n| Vibhishana. |\n| Nara. |\n| Siddha. |\n| Utpalaksha. |\n| Hiranyaksha. |\n| Hiranyakula. |\n| Vasukilo. |\n| Mihirakula, 180? |\n| Vaka. |\n| Kahitinandha, |\n| Vasunanda. |\n| Nara. |\n| Aksha. |\n| Gop\u0101ditya, 280? |\n\n**Aditya Dynasty.**\n\n| Pratapaditya, 340. |\n| Jalauka. |\n| Tunjina. |\n| Vijaya. |\n| Jayendra. |\n| Arya Raja. |\n\n**Gonardya Line restored.**\n\n| Meghavahana, 431. |\n| Pravarasena I., 465. |\n| Hiranya |\n| Toramana |\n| Matrigupta, 525. |\n| Pravarasena II., 530. |\n| Yudhishthira II. |\n| Nandrayat. |\n| Ranaditya. |\n| Vikramaditya, 492, 30th year, 622. |\n| Baladitya, 634, cotem.

If the A\u015boka mentioned in Kalhana\u2019s lists is the celebrated Mauryan king\u2014which, however, is by no means clear\u2014he was not only sovereign of the valley, but of the whole of Northern India besides. Kanishka, we know, was master of the whole of the Punjab, at least. So was Mihiracula; and even after his defeat and imprisonment by Bal\u0101ditya, he recovered Ghand\u0101ra, which was a portion of his original kingdom.\u00b9 If Meghav\u0101hana conquered Ceylon, he must have had possession of the intermediate countries, and as Pravarasena dethroned and afterwards reinstated \u015ail\u0101ditya, the son of the great Vikram\u0101ditya, he must have been practically master of the whole of the north of India. The same must be the case with Lalit\u0101ditya and others, if half we are told of them is true. All this will be clearer in the sequel; but, meanwhile, let us try if we can fix the dates of the kings ruling in Kashmir with a little more precision than has hitherto been done.\n\nThe dynasties with which we are at present concerned, are the first and second Gonardya, and the \u0100ditya dynasty that comes between them. Generally they may be described as reigning between the early years of the Christian era, and the early years of the Hegira; and the first point is to ascertain, as nearly as may be, their initial and final dates.\u00b2\n\nThere seems little discrepancy of opinion among chronologists with regard to the first, or to Kanishka\u2019s date. General Cunningham hesitates between 17 and 24 A.D.,\u00b3 for his death, and Lassen\u2074 brings him down to 40 A.D. From\n\n\u00b9 H.-T. ii. 190.\n\u00b2 In the following pages I have generally used Professor Wilson\u2019s abstract of the R\u0101ja-T. in the fifteenth volume of the Asiatic Researches. M. Troyer\u2019s translation is extremely useful in filling up details, but as the MS. he seems to have used was much less full and complete than that of the Professor, the latter contains many particulars most useful for our purposes, which the translator omits.\n\u00b3 Numismatic Chr. viii., 175. J. A. S. B. vii., 704.\n\u2074 Ind. Alterthums., vol. ii., p. xxiv.\nsuch attention as I have been able to pay to the subject myself, I have come to the conclusion that the General's second date is the most probable; but the concurrence of all authorities is so near, that it is not worth while arguing the point here.\n\nWith regard to a final date, we have the assertion of Bedia-ud-deen, that the 30th year of Vikram\u0101ditya was coincident with the Hegira (622), and that his successor Bal\u0101ditya was contemporary with Yesdegird.\\(^1\\)\n\nThis is just such an assertion as I should feel inclined to accept at the hands of a Mahommedan historian. We know from several sources that the followers of the Prophet were feeling their way on the banks of the Lower Indus in the very first years of the Hegira, and that they were in Cabul, possibly in Lahore, in the forty-fourth year after the flight,\\(^2\\) and this appears just one of those facts which they could most easily ascertain, and were most likely to record.\n\nThis view has recently been confirmed by a circumstance mentioned incidentally by Sir H. Elliot. In his Appendix, p. 143, he places the accession of Cach in 10 H. The expedition to Kirman in 14 H.; and between these two events happened the siege of Multan. When pressed, Bajhr\u0101 sends to ask assistance from his suzerain, the King of Kashmir. His messengers bring back news that the king was dead, his young son had just succeeded, and no hope of aid could be entertained. This happens to be exactly the year in which Bedia-ud-deen places Vikram\u0101ditya's death. Though his successor seems according to the Kashmir annals, to have been his brother, not his son; this is of little consequence. If, as General Cunningham asserts,\\(^3\\) Durlabha succeeded in 625, no change took place down to 39 H., and the founder of\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A. R., xv., p. 41.\n\n\\(^2\\) Elphinstone's History of India, i., p. 496, \\textit{et seq.} Sir H. Elliot's Mahomedan Histories, \\textit{passim}.\n\n\\(^3\\) Report to Government, 1861\u20132, p. 12. The General assures me he has materials quite sufficient to establish the correctness of this date. When they are published I shall be happy to give them my most earnest attention, and to modify the above if I find them conclusive. In the meanwhile, however, the difference between us is only twenty years, and that is not important for our present purposes.\nthe new dynasty was not at all the man to refuse assistance to his vassals.\n\nIf these views are correct, it is evident that Bal\u0101ditya, 634\u2013645, was the king who occupied the throne both on Hiouen-Thasang's first visit and on his return; but, unfortunately, as he provokingly does not mention the king's name\u2014he was a heretic\u2014his narrative is of no assistance to us here. There are certain circumstances, however, that make it probable that no recent revolution, or change of dynasty, had taken place, and though I do not rely, as Bhau Daji does, in the name of the monastery in which he lived, I, on the whole\u2014without being able to adduce any distinct point of evidence\u2014prefer the view here put forth.\n\nBetween the initial and final date thus fixed, we have almost exactly six centuries, and during that period thirty-seven kings are recorded as having held sway in Kashmir; thus averaging, as nearly as may be, sixteen years to each reign. This result accords so nearly with the average of the succeeding, or K\u0101rko\u1e6da dynasty, regarding whose dates there is very little doubt, as well as with the whole tenor of Indian history, that it almost amounts, in my mind, to a proof of the correctness of the data on which we are proceeding.\n\nIf any one will take the trouble of adding up the averages of any of the Hindu or Mahomedan dynasties of India, whose dates are known, he will be astonished how nearly this average is sustained when a sufficient number of reigns exist to make an average. Take, for instance, one of the most exceptional: In the Moghal dynasty of Delhi we have four reigns, from Akbar, 1556 to Aurangzeb, 1707, averaging nearly thirty-eight years each; yet, when we take the whole from Baber, 1494, to Akbar II., 1806, we find the average reduced to fifteen; or sixteen, if we omit some names that can hardly be said to have reigned. Or take the longest list we know, that of Ceylon, according to Turnour (Mahawanso, p. lix.), we have 165 reigns in 2341 years, or little more than fourteen years; but it must be admitted that for some periods the Cingalese\nGovernment was singularly feeble and disturbed, so this is probably an exceptionally low average.\n\nTo this we shall have frequent occasion to return hereafter, but in the meanwhile I may state that when we find a dynasty averaging from fifteen to seventeen years, we may feel pretty confident that there is no great error in the initial and final dates from which the average is calculated; or, if these are known, that there is a great probability that we have the correct number of names that ought to be found between these two points.\n\nTurning from these generalities, and assuming for the present, at least, that Vikram\u0101ditya ascended the throne 592, we find the dates of the four preceding reigns are enormously exaggerated, amounting to 415 years. Applying an average of sixteen years we reach 528 for the retirement of M\u0101trigupta and the accession of Pravarasena II. The real date, as we shall presently see, was most probably 530.\n\nThe story of M\u0101trigupta is told, in great detail, in the third book of the R.T., and, putting aside the usual padding of Hindu chroniclers, there seems no reason to doubt its general historical correctness. At a period, after the death of Hiranya, when Kashmir was without a king, Vikram\u0101ditya, of Ougein, sent a dependent of his own to occupy the vacant throne, exercising in that act his right as lord paramount, or Adhir\u0101ja of India. This time there is no possible mistake about the king being the one so famous in Hindu story, the possessor of the wonderful throne supported by thirty-two Apsarasas, the patron of poets, and of art and science of every sort; in fact, he was not the king of kings, but the demi-god of Hindu imagination.\n\nAs soon as M\u0101trigupta heard of the death of his patron, he retired to Benares, leaving the throne to Pravarasena. \"He immediately invaded the kingdom of the south, turned his arms against the son and successor of Vikram\u0101ditya, named Prat\u0101pa \u015a\u012bla, or \u015ail\u0101ditya, whom he drove from his capital and made prisoner. He seems to have been contented with\n\n---\n\n1 Troyer, vol. ii., p. 94. A. R. xv., 39.\nthe expression of his resentment, and not only to have spared\nthe life of the prince, but to have put him again in possession\nof his hereditary kingdom, carrying off, however, the throne\nof the Apsarasas, which he transferred to his own capital.\"1\nBedia-ud-deen, Professor Wilson adds, \"carries Pravarasena\nto Bengal, also, where he subdues Behar Sinh, ruler of\nDhacca.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, Hiouen-Thsang gives the accession of\n\u015ail\u0101ditya in 530, which is so nearly what we arrive at by the\nabove calculation that we may accept it as certain within a\nyear or so either way. Assuming this, we have four events\nwhich occurred in this year, which are most important for\nour chronology:\u2014the death of Vikram\u0101ditya the Great; the\naccession of \u015ail\u0101ditya to the throne of Malwa; and the retire-\nment of M\u0101trigupta; followed by the accession of Pravara-\nsena II. to the throne of Kashmir.\n\nProceeding upwards, the R.T. allows thirty years for the\njoint reign of the two brothers, Hiranya and Toram\u0101\u1e47a\u2014a\nduration, I am inclined to think, very probable from the fol-\nlowing circumstance: Pravarasena II. was not born till after\nhis father Toram\u0101\u1e47a had been deposed and imprisoned. When\nM\u0101trigupta was first sent, Pravara declined to oppose him,\nthough urged by his mother to do so. He was apparently too\nyoung; while to act as he did act on Vikram\u0101ditya's death,\nhe must, at least, have been 25 years of age.\n\nThis would allow only ten years for the joint reign of the\ntwo brothers, and, from the context, we can hardly allow less.\nThis would take us back to 495. The next preceding reign\nwas Pravarasena I., the grandfather, of course, of the second\nof that name, and he was preceded by Meghav\u0101hana, whose\nname sounds much more like a title invented by the Kash-\nmiree chronicler to hide a foreign conquest, than a real name.\nBe this as it may, these two reigns are represented as extending\nto 64 years, or to A.D. 431. This I should feel very much in-\nclined to reject as excessive, were it not that in the R.T. he is\nsaid to have invaded Ceylon, and, adds Troyer, l. iii., s. 72,\n\n1 A. R. xv., 39.\n\"Monta avec son arm\u00e9e sur un rocher nomm\u00e9 Rohanam, &c.\" Turning to the Mah\u0101vanso, under the date 434, we find the following entry: \"A certain Damilo, named Pandu, landing from the opposite coast, put Mettasena to death on the field of battle, and usurped the kingdom of Lanka. All the principal natives fled to Rohana,\"\u00b9 &c.\n\nThe dates are too near to admit of doubt but that these narratives relate to the same event; but, as I said on a previous occasion, I cannot help fancying that the Ceylonese dates are all from ten to fifteen years too early in this period.\u00b2\n\nThe king, being called by the generic name of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du\u2014P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dava\u2014does not help us to an identification; but, it will be observed, it is the same name as is given by the Ceylonese, to the Emperor of Magadha in the Dalad\u0101vanso,\u00b3 above a century earlier.\n\nTo this subject we must return again presently; but meanwhile, it is only necessary to remark, that if Meghav\u0101hana did invade Ceylon, as he is reported to have done, he must also have borne another name, and been sovereign of the intermediate countries. It is absurd to suppose that the king of a remote Himalayan valley, that never could have contained a million of inhabitants, could have marched the whole length of India on such an expedition. He must have been a possessor of the five Indias, but what his real name was we must try afterwards to find out.\n\nWe have no contemporary incidents and no internal evidence by which to check the length of the reigns of the six kings of the preceding, or \u0100ditya dynasty. It could not however, have lasted long if it is true as we are told in R.-T., that Meghav\u0101hana was the great grandson of Yudhi\u1e63\u1e6dhira, the last king of the first Gonardya dynasty.

A different monarch, says our author, from the \u015aak\u0101ri Vikram\u0101ditya, although sometimes erroneously identified with this prince.\"\u00b9 This fact, though not very clear, is worth bearing in mind, as Wilford, from Jaina authorities, insists on an earlier Vikram\u0101ditya; and there certainly does appear to have been a king of that name before the great king\u2014the son of Harsha. My own impression is, that he was his grandfather; this one is too far removed for that, but we may be able to identify him hereafter. Meanwhile, I see little reason to doubt his existence; but if my theory is correct, he ought to have been contemporary with the first king of the second Gonardyan dynasty (A.D. 447), and not with the first of the \u0100ditya race, which is a century too early for any king of that name we know of.\n\nMihirakula is the only other king in the Kashmir list whose date it is necessary for our present purposes to attempt to fix. Unfortunately, we have no other means than averages available, but they do come out so nearly exact in these lists, that we cannot err far in placing his accession about the year 180 A.D., to say 200. This would accord perfectly with Hiouen-Thsang's expression when he describes him thus:\u2014\n\n\"Plusieurs centaines d'ann\u00e9es avant l'\u00e9poque actuelle il y eut un roi nomm\u00e9 Mahiracula qui \u00e9tablit sa r\u00e9sidence dans cette ville (Sakala) et devient Souverain des cinq Indes.\"\u00b2\n\nThe story of his wars with Bal\u0101ditya, king of Magadha\u2014his defeat and imprisonment\u2014are among the most curious and interesting episodes of Indian history to be found in the Chinese pilgrim's narrative; but as it is only his date that we are here concerned with, we must leave him with it established certainly within a limit of error of 20 years either way.\n\nTo all these dates we shall have occasion to refer again in the sequel, and it is consequently unnecessary to enlarge on them more at present.\n\n\u00b9 A.

For a long time this seemed to me conclusive, for when an author of his standing and acknowledged familiarity with the subject retracts a published opinion, and adopts another, he must be supposed to have had good reason for so doing, and his second opinion is more worthy of consideration than the first. In this matter, however, I consider Mr. Thomas as a more formidable antagonist than even the General. For many years past he has studied the coins, and with them the Gupta period, with more assiduity and care than any other person, as his numerous publications on the subject fully attest; and no one can estimate more highly than I do, either his ability or the perfect fairness with which he treats the subject. Notwithstanding this, I venture to differ from him, first, because I think his conclusions are drawn too exclusively from numismatic evidence; and, secondly, because I fancy he places too much reliance on the testimony of Albir\u016bn\u012b, an Arab author of the\neleventh century, whose authority I am inclined to disregard entirely.\n\nThe testimony of Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee on this subject, with which we will first deal, is contained in the few following words, as translated by M. Reinaud: \"Quant au Goupta Kala (\u00e8re des Gouptas), on entend par le mot Goupta des gens qui, dit-on, \u00e9taient m\u00e9chants et puissants; et l'\u00e8re qui porte leur nom est l'\u00e9poque de leur extermination.\"\n\nThe first thing that strikes anyone on reading this assertion is its extreme improbability. My memory may be at fault, but I do not know any similar occurrence in the history of the world. The nearest approach to it is the era of Yesdegird. If it had been dated from the battle of Kadesia or the death of the king, it would have been a case in point; but it was established by the king himself in the pride of power and greatness, and dates from the first year of his reign, and seems to have been perpetuated by his co-religionists in opposition to the Hegira, which was introduced by their hated conquerors.\n\nIn the next place, if it were possible to fix their destruction with such precision in 318, some event of importance must have happened in that year\u2014a battle, or massacre. We ought to know the name of the last Gupta, or to have heard the boast of their exterminators; neither history nor tradition, nor does any inscription hint at any such event as occurring at or near any such time. When we look into the case a little more closely, we find there are a variety of Gupta inscriptions dated from 82 to 165, from some unspecified era. If it was not their own, it must have been the Saka 78, A.D. At least Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee knows no other about the time. This, however, would only take us down to 243 A.D., and still leave us seventy-five years to fill up before we get to the last Gupta, and we have no names to put into the gap.\n\n1 As I only refer to Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee in consequence of the value Mr. Thomas attaches to his evidence, I take the passages as found in his essays, to which alone I refer. They will be found in the twelfth volume of this Journal, p. 1, et seq., and in his edition of Prinsep, vol. i., 268 to 276. As they are comprised in so short a space, it will not be necessary to refer specially to each page.\n\n2 They are collected by Thomas in his edition of Prinsep, vol. i., p. 246 to 249.\nAlb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee goes on to say, \"Apparemment, Ballaba suivit imm\u00e9diatement les Gouptas.\" If I am correct in the date I have above assigned to Bat\u0163\u00e2raka, the progenitor of the Balabha race, we have at least two centuries to spare between the first R\u00e2ja of that family and the last of the Guptas, on the assumption that they were exterminated in 318.\n\nA little further on, however, Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee contradicts himself when enumerating the eras of India, as they occurred, he says, \"on emploie ordinairement les \u00e8res de Sri Harsha (400 years before the next) de Vicramaditya, de Saca, de Ballaba, et des Gouptas.\" Here the order of the two last is inverted, and it is clear he knew of no era between 78 and 318, from which the Gupta inscriptions could be dated.\n\nI may add that the two Harsha eras which he quotes\u2014one 457 B.C., the other 607 A.D.\u2014are, so far as we now know, pure inventions, or mistakes of his own. No trace of them is to be found elsewhere.\n\nI could easily adduce other reasons why I distrust entirely this Arab author, but the above are, for the present I hope, sufficient to justify me in putting his testimony aside. He was a foreigner, and lived six centuries after the events we are discussing, and it is not consequently to be wondered at that he blundered to the extent he did.\u00b9 As I hope, however, presently to adduce proof positive that the Guptas did date from their own era, this, perhaps, is more than is now necessary to say with regard to him; but so much stress has been laid on his assertions, that it was impossible to pass him over, as otherwise I would have been inclined to do.\n\nWhen from Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee we turn to authors nearer home, we find that the only mention of the Guptas anywhere is in the\n\n\u00b9 In the above I have argued as if the translations of Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee given by Messrs. Reinaud and Thomas were final; both are competent Arabic scholars, and, as I am not, I have taken the meaning as they understand it. On page 271, vol. i. of Mr. Thomas' Prinsep, he gives another translation in the following words: \"The K\u00fbbat Kal (Gupta era) that was, as is said, a wicked and powerful family; when it ceased it was dated from, and as it were (it would seem that) Balab was the last of them, for the first of their era also is 241 years after the Shaka Kal.\" If that word also has any right to be where it is put, there is an end of the question, and we are fighting with shadows, in so far as Alb\u00eer\u00fbn\u00ee is concerned. All I contend for is, that both dated from 318 A.D.\nPur\u0101\u1e47as, and their chronology is, unfortunately, most vague and confused about this period. Both Dr. Mill,\u00b9 however, and Professor Wilson\u00b2 were of opinion that the Guptas of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as could not be earlier than the seventh or eighth century. The argument is long and tedious, and the result, probably, even if undertaken by the best Sanskrit scholar, would hardly be sufficiently conclusive to be worth the space it would occupy. But, perhaps, I may be allowed to state, generally, the conclusions I have arrived at regarding it.\n\nMy impression is that the chronological dates, and, generally, the facts, on which the Puranic literature is based, were first collected during the great revival of Hindu literature, which took place under Vikram\u0101ditya in the beginning of the sixth century; though of course it is admitted that the Pur\u0101\u1e47as were not reduced to their present form till long afterwards. Now, it appears to me that, down to Pulomat, in the beginning of the fifth century, the Puranic lists are fairly clear and consecutive; but as they approached known times\u2014on this theory, in order to keep up their mystic and prophetic character\u2014they were purposely confused and mystified. My conviction is, that all the dynasties mentioned in the Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a,\u00b3 for instance, as reigning subsequent to the last Andhra, were so far contemporaneous, that none of them extended to Vikram\u0101ditya, and the whole must be included between 350, or rather 400, at the earliest, till 500 A.D. as the last of them. If this is so, the testimony of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as \"valeat quantum\" is that the Guptas reigned in the fifth century A.D. To my mind the Puranic argument appears perfectly clear and convincing, but I fear I cannot so state it as to carry the same conviction to others. We shall have occasion, however, to return to it in the sequel. Nevertheless let us see what the Guptas say for themselves.\n\nThe following is, I believe, a correct list of the dynasty:\n\n| Dynasty       | Dates on Inscription |\n|---------------|----------------------|\n| \u015ar\u012b or Raja Gupta. |                      |\n| Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Gha\u1e6dotkacha. |                    |\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B., vi., p. 12.  \n\u00b2 Vish\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47a, 478; Ariana Antique, 407.  \n\u00b3 V.

The only question is from what era are these dates reckoned.\n\nAs before mentioned, if it were either the Samvat of Vikram\u0101ditya or the \u015aaka, they must have been destroyed long before 318; and unless a date, either 85, or at least 68 years more modern can be found, the argument halts. Certainly Albir\u016bn\u012b knew of no such era, nor do I know where to look for it.\n\nAssuming that these dates are from the Gupta K\u0101la, 318, we are at once met with a difficulty which I do not now see how we are to get over. We have at present no means of knowing whether the two dates I have placed opposite the first Chandra Gupta belong to him or the second\u2014another illustration of the inconvenience of a grandson adopting his grandfather's name! Assuming it to be as I have placed them at the head of this section, according to the first theory, Chandra Gupta I. reigned 400 to 411. In this case, the two preceding reigns must have occupied 80 or 82 years, on the supposition that their reigns extended to the beginning of the Era, which is far from being proved. On this theory, the succeeding reigns must have been compressed to an equally\nunusual extent. If these dates belong to the second Chandra Gupta, the whole dynasty may be tolerably evenly distributed over the whole period, allowing 20 years to each reign. The more equal spacing of the reigns of these kings is tempting at first sight, but the whole evidence, so far as I am acquainted with it, tends in an opposite direction, and favours the assumption that the Sanchi inscription belongs to the first Chandra Gupta.\n\nPending the discovery of an inscription to settle this point, the question seems mainly to hinge on who was the Sh\u00e2h\u00e2n-Sh\u00e2hi of Samudra Gupta's Allahabad inscription.\u00b9 If any one, even if very moderately acquainted with Indian or Persian history, were asked which of the Sassanian kings was most likely to be mentioned in an inscription at Allahabad, he would almost inevitably answer Bahram Gaur. He reigned 420-440; and if the date 93 belongs to the first Chandra Gupta, the writer of the inscription could not have ascended the throne before 411\u2014it might be 415 or 420.\u00b2\n\nIn the same line of this inscription occurs another name, on which Prinsep makes the following remark:\u2014\"Sinh\u00e2\u1e6d\u1e6da\u2014the country of the lion (Sinha), might safely be identified with Sinhala in Ceylon, especially as it is followed by Sarv\u0101dvi\u1e6dpa\u2014all the isles, which must refer to the Anca diva of Ptolemy, etc.\" He then goes on to suggest that the word may apply to some insignificant hills among the Western Ghats. This we may safely reject. Such a place would never be coupled with the Persians, the Scythians, and Huns; but Ceylon might.\u00b3\n\nIf we turn back to either the Kashmir or Ceylon annals we find (ante p. 100) an Indian Conquest of Ceylon in 434, which also might safely be made to fall within this reign, and Meghav\u00e2hana would then be only a title of Samudra Gupta. Supposing, however, it should turn out that the dates above quoted (82 and 93) belong to the second Chandra Gupta. This would hardly alter the facts. Bahram Gaur's visit would fall in the reign of Kum\u00e2ra, and the Shah of the\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. vi. p. 974; Thomas' Prinsep, i. 233, et seq.\n\u00b2 Loc. e.\n\u00b3 We probably must refer again to the L\u00e2t for the true reading.\ninscription would be Shapur III., or Bahram Kerman Shah, both of whom most probably formed alliances with the kings of India of that day. In that case the Meghav\u00e2hana of Kashmir was probably Skanda the last, and probably the greatest, of his race.\\(^1\\)\n\nOn the whole, the first is the view I am at present inclined to adopt; but it is little use arguing a question which an inscription with a date may settle any day. Either view will suit all the facts we now know; and so far as history or probability are concerned I know nothing to militate against the view that the greatness of the Guptas ended with Skanda, about the year A.D. 460.\n\nWhatever may be determined with regard to the connexion of Meghav\u00e2hana with the Guptas, the name of his successor, Pravarasena, presents a nominal similarity too tempting to be overlooked, though it may be difficult to establish the identity in an absolute manner.\n\nFrom the Seoni copper plates\\(^2\\) we learn that the grantor was a Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja Pravarasena, the grandson of Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja Adhir\u00e2ja Sri Deva Gupta. Deva was no doubt a title only, as it does not occur anywhere else in our lists; but in the Sanchi inscription\\(^3\\) we are told in so many words that the Chandra Gupta of 93, was \"generally known among his subjects as Devar\u00e2ja.\" Assuming for the nonce that this was the king, the Pravarasena of Seoni was the contemporary of him of Kashmir, if he was not the same. It is a very curious coincidence at least, if it is nothing more.\n\nThere is also another inscription of the same Pravarasena, in the so-called Zodiac Cave, at Ajanta. This, though much mutilated, has been so far deciphered by Bhau Daji\\(^4\\) as to make it clear that it is the same king who excavated the cave, and who made the Seoni grant. It seems also clear that he\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) A probable explanation of the matter is, that the Kashmir King may have assisted his Suzerain in his expedition to Ceylon, and when he returned home, boasted that, \"He had done it.\"\\(^5\\) The Ch\u00e2lukya Adhir\u00e2jas boast so continuously of their conquests of Ceylon, (J. B. B. R.A.S. III., p. 206,) that it is probable that from the time of the Guptas, or at least from 434, the island remained more or less a dependency of the Emperors of India, for a considerable time at least.\n\n\\(^2\\) J.A.S.B. v. 726. \\(^3\\) J.A.S.B.; Thomas' Prinsep, i. 245.\n\n\\(^4\\) J. B. B. R. A. S. vi. pt. 2nd, p. 56.\nwas of the Vindhyasakti race who are mentioned in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as before the Guptas.\\(^1\\) As I said before, however, I believe all that group of dynasties are contemporary, or nearly so. I would not, therefore, insist on this, but what I do insist upon is that the cave could not have been excavated before the year 400 A.D. When I first wrote on the subject I said \u201cI believe this, and the one before it, was excavated between the fourth and sixth century after Christ, but more probably about the latter date.\u201d\\(^2\\) I have since felt inclined, as my knowledge of the subject increased, to ascribe this cave to a more modern date, but, on the whole, after a careful analysis of the Topes, at Sanchi and Amravati, and a review of the whole subject, I feel convinced that it must have been excavated within the limits of the fifth century. Now, that we know that it owes its origin to a grandson of one of our Gupta kings, this, to my mind, is in itself sufficient to settle the question, though others may not attach so much weight to this argument as I do.\n\nThe name of Toram\u0101\u1e47a, one of the successors of Pravarasena, in the Kashmir list, affords a more tempting nominal similarity than even his father\u2019s name.\n\nWe have two inscriptions, one at Eran,\\(^3\\) and the other at Gwalior;\\(^4\\) neither is dated from any era, but the former is closely connected with that of Budha Gupta, at the same place, which is dated 165. Toram\u0101\u1e47a\u2019s is dated in the first year of his reign, and probably not long after the date just quoted, and Thomas reads the date on his coin as 180,\\(^5\\) which is further confirmed by Bhau Daji, who believes he detects the symbol for 180 + something on the Eran inscription.\\(^6\\) This date, therefore, if my view of the era is correct, is 498 to 500. Both Bhau Daji and Rajendra Lal identify him unhesitatingly with the Toram\u0101\u1e47a of Kashmir, and the latter further asserts that the Pa\u1e63upati, the son of Toram\u0101\u1e47a, in the fifteenth year of whose reign the inscription was put up,\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a, p. 477.\n\\(^2\\) J.R.A.S. viii. 48.\n\\(^3\\) J.A.S.A. viii. 633; Thomas, i. 249.\n\\(^4\\) J.A.S.B. xxx. 277.\n\\(^5\\) Prinsep, i. 340.\n\\(^6\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. viii. 249.\nis no other than Pravarasena II., the King of Kashmir.\\(^1\\) My own impression is that they are right. The coincidences are so many and so curious that they can hardly be accidental; but there is one difficulty in the way of the identification of the two Toram\u00e2nas, which must not be overlooked. The king on the Eran inscription is styled Mah\u00e2r\u00e2ja Adhir\u00e2ja\u2014the King of Kashmir never rose above the rank of Yuvar\u00e2ja; and if the first title is not a piece of oriental flattery, as Lassen\\(^2\\) suggests, it is impossible they should be the same person. Neither Budha Gupta nor the Toram\u00e2na, of Gwalior, aspire to this rank, and it is not by any means clear that even the two Indian Toram\u00e2nas are identical. If he was an Adhir\u00e2ja we must also curtail the reign, or at least the supremacy of Vikram\u00e2ditya, by some years; he could not in that case have become lord paramount till after Toram\u00e2na\u2019s death.\n\nEven supposing these identifications cannot be absolutely ascertained, there is a curious fact with regard to names in Indian history which it is worth pointing out, and may serve somewhat to solve the difficulty.\n\nCertain names appear to crop up at particular periods, and to be adopted by everybody at the same time. Thus all the Sil\u00e2dityas, whether of Malwa, Canouge, or Balabhi, are comprised within the limits of a century, or thereabout. The name does not occur before or afterwards; and in like manner, after Vikram\u00e2ditya of Malwa made himself so famous, the name occurs again and again, with most perplexing frequency. We have already seen one Vijay\u00e2ditya of Guzerat assuming the same name as an Adhir\u00e2ja of the same family who was living at the same time, and the example of Harsha Vardhana of Canouge, shows how easily Hindu rajas change their names. All this is perplexing enough in most instances, and is, no doubt, one of the chief causes of the uncertainty which pervades the whole subject; but the knowledge of its existence may frequently obviate a difficulty which might otherwise seem insuperable.\n\nThe conclusion I have arrived at from such attention as I\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J.A.S.B. xxx. 271.\n\n\\(^2\\) Indische Alt. iii. 659.\ncan pay to the subject, is that all these Toram\u0101nas and Pravara\u1e47as belong certainly to the same age; that some of them may be identical, and all nearly contemporary; but we must wait for further information before we can say positively which were actually the same, and which were only living at the same time.\n\nI shall conclude this branch of my subject by referring to the Skanda Gupta inscription on the rock at Junagar. This was not translated by Prinsep, though a copy of it was in his hands before his last illness.\u00b9 Had he lived to translate it, my impression is that the controversy as to the age of the Guptas never would have arisen\u2014its evidence seems so absolute. Be this as it may, it never appeared, so far as I know, in a complete form and translated, till this was accomplished by Bhau Daji in the sixth volume of the Bombay Journal of 1862. In it we have three dates\u2014the Sadar\u1e63ana lake is said to have burst its banks in 130, to have been repaired in 137, and a temple to Vishnu built in 138, and twice it is repeated \"counting from the Era of the Guptas\" (Guptasya K\u0101la). The stone is worn where the middle date occurs, but there is just space enough for these words. The same king, on the Kuhaon pillar, dates his inscription in 141,\u00b2 but without mentioning the era, which seems to have been so usual in Bengal, as not to require being specified.\n\nI may add that the inflated language of this inscription approximates it very closely to those of the Balabhi kings above alluded to, and the form of the characters seems almost identical. What, then, was the Gupta K\u0101la? If Albir\u016bni was right in calling the era of 318 by this name, here we have proof positive that he was wrong in saying it was the era of the destruction of the family; for here we have one of the best known and most powerful kings of this family actually dating his inscription from this era, and his authority is surely better than Albir\u016bni's on such a subject. Further, if the Gupta Era was this one, then Skanda Gupta reigned certainly from A.D. 448 to 459\u2014how much before or after we have at present no means of knowing.\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. vii. 634. \u00b2 Thomas, i. 250.\nHad the facts above stated been the whole case, no one, I believe, would ever have raised a question about the matter, or dreamt of placing the Guptas anywhere but in the 5th century. There are, however, certain circumstances connected with their coins which have induced Mr. Thomas, General Cunningham, and other numismatists, to bring them back to an earlier age. Even here, however, it is only half a difficulty, for the Guptas had two distinct and separate coinages, as unlike one another in style and execution as it is well possible to conceive. One, called the Canouge group, is derived from the Indo-Scythian coins, by easily traced gradations.\\(^1\\) The other is copied from the Saurastrian coinage of the Sah kings, and is generally confined to silver and copper pieces, while the Canouge coinage seems to be generally gold.\n\nPutting on one side for the present the coins of the Sah type, to which we will return presently, and confining our remarks wholly to the Canouge coins, they do not appear to me to offer any difficulty. In the first place, I attach no importance to the objection that some of them are so like others of the Indo-Scythian series, which we know are of the 1st century A.D., that they ought to be near them in date. The argument might be good in Europe, but mints are in all ages and countries singularly conventional and capricious, and we have no right to apply to India the experience of other countries, without, at least, some stronger reason than has yet been adduced.\n\nThe question is a very large one, and I do not feel myself competent to enter into it, nor is it necessary to do so in the present instance. One coin, or rather group of coins, will be sufficient to explain my meaning, and with it I fancy the whole argument must stand or fall. In the Canouge series there are several coins which represent, on the obverse, the king slaying a lion, on the reverse, a female figure seated on a lion.\\(^2\\) They are the most beautiful in execution of the whole series, and, consequently, the furthermost removed from the rude Indo-Scythic coins which preceded them. Probably,\n\n\\(^1\\) Prinsep pointed this out as early as 1835, and it has not since been disputed. J.A.S.B., iv. p. 621, et seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) J.R.A.S., xii., pl. v., fig. 25, 27, 28, pl. vii., fig. 1, 2, 8.\ntherefore, they were the last and culminating effort of the Canouge engraver. One of these coins (pl. v., fig. 28) bears the name of Kum\u0101ra Gupta. All the others that of Vikram\u0101ditya, Vikrama Sinha, or some such name. On one coin (pl. v. 25), the most perfect of the whole, we have the full inscription perfectly legible, on the obverse, Mah\u0101r\u0101j\u0101dhir\u0101ja \u015ar\u012b, and on the reverse, \u015ar\u012b Sinha Vikrama. Who then is the king? For myself I cannot doubt but that he is the famous king of Malwa, who, if my chronology is correct, succeeded the Guptas so closely, as we have just seen that Toram\u0101\u1e47a's reign probably overlapped his for some years, though to so small an extent that it may possibly be adjusted.\n\nThere is another point, however, with regard to these coins which seems to me of great interest. The device of the King killing a lion is very un-Indian; but from the earliest Babylonian cylinder, through the whole Assyrian period down to the late Futteh Ali Shah, every king of the Persian countries has so represented himself. Throughout Indian history, Vikram\u0101ditya is represented as the son of, or at least as the descendant of Bahram Gour, who is said to have married a daughter of Vasudeva.\u00b9 To my mind the coin confirms the story, and the story the adscription of the coin to a most satisfactory extent.\n\nThere is still another group of coins called Indo-Sassanian, which, however, have only been imperfectly read. The typical example of the class is one originally drawn by Prinsep, and reproduced by Thomas (vol. i., pl. vii., fig. 6). It represents a Sassanian king on one side; on the other, another who may be an Indian with a distinctly legible inscription in Sanskrit characters, which reads \u015ar\u012b Vasudeva. While the other inscriptions are undeciphered, it is too hazardous even to suggest that this may be the father-in-law of Bahram Gour; but the number of these Indo-Sassanian coins which are found in India, extending even beyond the Hegira, prove a close intercourse between the two countries at the period we are now speaking about, and when thoroughly investigated, will, I fancy, throw more light on\n\n\u00b9 Ayeen Akbaree II., 54. Ferishtah p. lxxvi.\nthe political and religious changes that took place in India about the sixth century, than anything else which has yet come to light.\n\nSo far as they have yet been described, or deciphered, they seem to me to confirm the impression of a strong Sassanian influence during the Gupta period, which would quite justify the terms in which one of them is mentioned by Samudra Gupta in his inscription. They seem also, so far as I can judge, to prove the correctness of the story of the descent of Vikram\u0101ditya from the Persian king.\\(^1\\)\n\nThere is still another small group of coins belonging to the series which have hitherto been unidentified, but for which it may be possible to find an owner if we adopt this theory of dates. Among the Canouge coins are several with a horse on the obverse, and a female figure on the reverse, with a very legible inscription beside the latter, which reads \"A\u1e63vamedha Par\u0101krama, the paramount hero of the A\u1e63vamedha.\"\\(^2\\) If I am correct in my chronology, Pulake\u015bi I. did perform an A\u1e63vamedha during the reign of \u015ail\u0101ditya, the son and successor of Vikram\u0101ditya of Malwa, and the character of the coin would exactly suit this date. This, of course, is not proof. Many others may have done the same, but none, so far as I know, claim to have performed this sacrifice in any of the numerous inscriptions we have about this period; and at all events it may be put down as one of the many curious coincidences which this theory of the Gupta dates gives rise to, and which, when sufficiently numerous, make out a case of circumstantial evidence that cannot be resisted.\n\nBefore proceeding to discuss the difficulty which arises from the character of the Sah type of Gupta coins, it will be convenient to try and fix the dates of another Gupta family, whose existence may perhaps throw some light on the subject.\n\n\\(^1\\) My impression is, that Vikram\u0101ditya was the great grandson of Bahram Gour. Thus his son bore that name (447?). His son was Harsha, and then came the second king of that name, the great Vikram\u0101ditya in 490. According to this view, the so-called Gadhia Paisa fall naturally and easily into the position to which they have hitherto been tentatively assigned.\n\n\\(^2\\) Thomas, J. R. A. S. xii., pl. v., fig. 31, 32. Ariana Antiqua, pl. xviii. fig. 2, etc.\nIt will be convenient to designate them as the Magadha Guptas, to distinguish them from the Canouge family of the same name whose dates we have just been discussing. The former are known to us only from accounts given of them by Hiouen-Thsang. While residing in the monastery of N\u00e2landa he tells us that the founder of that institution was one \u0160akr\u0101ditya,\\(^1\\) a name so like that sometimes applied to S\u0101liv\u0101hana, that the first idea is that it may be the same person. It is by no means impossible that this may be so, but for the present I am inclined to believe that that king is at least half a century too modern to meet the requirements of Hiouen-Thsang\u2019s text; for he goes on to say, \u201cAinsi depuis les sept cents ans que ce convent existe, nul homme,\u201d etc. Of course, he is speaking in round numbers, but as he resided five years in this monastery, he was likely to be well informed in its annals, and we must allow that when he said 700, he meant at least more than 600, which would take us back to A.D. 40, or before it. This view is confirmed by a fact that I see no reason for doubting, which is that N\u0101g\u0101rjuna resided sometime in this monastery,\\(^2\\) and he was contemporary with Kanishka. Indeed I am inclined to look on N\u0101g\u0101rjuna as practically the founder of this great establishment, and generally of the monastic system in India. Be this as it may, Hiouen-Thsang\u2019s date and the residence of this saint in the monastery, place its foundation in the first years of the Christian era.\n\nAfter this our author proceeds to record the names and benefactions of four of his successors, each of whom he represents as the son of the preceding king. This is doubtful, but not so the succession of the following kings:\n\n1. \u0160akr\u0101ditya.\n2. Buddha Gupta.\n3. Tath\u0101gata Gupta.\n4. Bal\u0101ditya, and\n5. Vajra.\n\nNo particulars are given of any of these kings, except Bal\u0101ditya. He we are told was contemporary with Mihi-rakula of Kashmir,\\(^3\\) and the story of their wars and its re-\n\n\\(^1\\) H.-T., i. 150; iii. 42. \\(^2\\) Vassilief, Le Bouddisme, etc., p. 200. \\(^3\\) H.-T. ii. 191.\nresults are told in great detail as above mentioned in speaking of the R\u0101ja-Tarangin\u00ee. Here occurs our first difficulty. If we are to read Hioun-Thsang literally, Bal\u0101ditya was the great-grandson of \u015aakraditya, whom, for the reason just stated, I believe to have been contemporary with Kanishka, but according to the Kashmir lists 12 reigns occur between that king and Mihirakula. The only mode of reconciling the two lists that occurs to me is to assume that Hiouen-Thsang used the word \"Son\" in the sense of \"descendant,\" as is done in every Puranic list we are acquainted with to an extent that is sometimes most perplexing.\n\nFor reasons above stated, I am inclined to place great reliance on Kashmir lists as adjusted, and therefore feel considerable confidence in placing Bal\u0101ditya in the latter half of the second century; and Buddha Gupta we may, for the present, place about the year 100 A.D., till we get some further data for fixing his date with more precision.\n\nWe know only of one other king of this dynasty, the \"P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du,\" of the Dalad\u0101vanso. His capital was Pali-bothra (Patna) where he was reigning in the beginning of the fourth century, and if not Lord Paramount of the whole of India, he at least exercised suzerain right over the Kalingas, which are the countries principally referred to in the narrative.\u00b9\n\nThe result of all this, therefore, is that for a dynasty which we know lasted for 300 years, we have only six names\u2014or rather only five, for the last is a title\u2014and we want at least a dozen more to fill up the gaps which exist. Everything we know of this dynasty would lead us to suppose that they were powerful, and had among their numbers some \"Adhir\u0101jas\" at least; but we have no record of two thirds of their names, and do not know where to look for them.\n\nIn order to understand the bearing this dynasty may have in the numismatic evidence, it is necessary to assume some date for the Sah kings of Saurashtra, whose coinage so closely resembles those of the Guptas.\u2014Mr. Thomas places all the\n\n\u00b9 J.A.S.B. vi. p. 856, et seqq.\n13 kings between 157 and 57 B.C. Mr. Justice Newton begins where Mr. Thomas leaves off, and places them between 57 B.C., and 235 A.D.; and Bhau Daji begins 135 years later, and extends them to 376 A.D. The two latter authorities also extend the number of reigns from newly discovered coins to 20 or 25 names, which would give from 12 to 15 years to each, instead of under eight, as was assumed from those that were known in 1848, when Mr. Thomas wrote.\n\nGeneral Cunningham, I believe, agrees with Mr. Newton, and my own impression is\u2014for reasons to be given hereafter\u2014that his views are more in accordance with the facts of the case than those of either of the gentlemen who place themselves before or after his dates. At all events, we may safely assume this for the present argument.\n\nThe three kings of the Gupta dynasty, whose coins are most frequently found of the Surastrian type, are Budha, Kum\u0101ra, and Skanda. If they were confined to the two, or even to these three only, the difficulty might be got over by assuming that Budha Gupta of the coins was the Buddha Gupta of the Magadha dynasty. The dates would fit admirably, and such a coin as those 52 or 56, plate ii., J.R.A.S. XII., would range perfectly with the Sah series. Nor would I hesitate in assuming that Kum\u0101ra might be among the lost names of the Magadha dynasty. It is so common a title, and, with a peacock coinage, so natural a name. When, however, we come to Skanda, the case becomes more difficult. It is true his also might be among the lost names. But such a title as \"Parama Bh\u0101gavata \u015ar\u012b Vikram\u0101ditya Skanda Gupta,\" looks so like its Canouge congener, that it is difficult to believe they must not belong to the same king. There is a circumstance, however, regarding this king's coins that does not seem to have been\n\n---\n\n1 J.R.A.S. xii., p. 48; Prinsep ii. 91.\n2 Mr. Newton's paper has not yet been printed in the Journal of his Society, but appeared in the \"Overland Times of India\" in July last.\n3 J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. viii. 223.\n4 I do not think the difference of spelling here indicated of any importance. Hiouen-Thsang's name was translated first from Sanskrit into Chinese, and from Chinese into French, and might easily have been more changed in the process.\n5 J.R.A.S. xii. 68.\nobserved. If, for instance, we take the representation of the face, figs. 50, 51, on the plate last quoted, they show a marked degradation from the coins of Budha Gupta; and, in so far as numismatic evidence is concerned, would reverse the order in which we know these kings succeeded one another, in the Canouge dynasty. It is also difficult to understand how a king whose mints could issue such coins as, for instance, Plate vi. fig. 18, in the same volume, could possibly be content with such rude specimens of the art as those last quoted. All this may be capable of being explained; but till this is done, it seems to me to render the evidence of workmanship in coins of singularly little value in determining either dates, or the identity of kings.\n\nIt may also be remarked that the Sah coinage of the Guptas is as remarkable for what it omits as what it contains. We have no coins of either Samudra or of the two Chandra Guptas, though there is reason to believe they were among the most powerful kings of their family, and their coins of the Canouge type are even more common than those of the three kings above named.\n\nAll this is so vague and unsatisfactory that I would have little hesitation about suggesting that the coinages belonged to the two different families if it stopped there; but there seems to be an unpublished coin of Toram\u00e2na,\\(^1\\) about whose date there is no doubt; and there exists other evidence of connection,\\(^2\\) between the Sah Gupta coinage and that of Toram\u00e2na, which, I fear at present, at least render this solution untenable. It seems worth while, however, putting it forward, as, when examined by persons more competent to judge of its merits than I am, it may lead to some important results either for or against the Gupta dates.\n\nEven if we are forced to abandon the idea of the coins belonging to two different dynasties,\\(^3\\) it by no means follows that some other satisfactory solution of the problem may not be discovered. The simplest course would be to adopt Bhau Daji\u2019s date for the\n\n\\(^1\\) Thomas\u2019 Prinsep, i. 340  \n\\(^2\\) Loc cit. ii. 95.  \n\\(^3\\) The existence of these two families may, perhaps, be the cause of Albir\u00fbni\u2019s mistake. There certainly were Guptas before 318 as well as after. He may have confounded the one with the other.\nSah kings, in that case they would, by extending down to 376, overlap the Guptas to a considerable extent, and so get over all the difficulties of the connexion between the two coinages. I don\u2019t think myself that this is the true solution, but I feel quite certain that it will be found much more in conformity with the facts to bring the Sahs down than to take the Guptas up. For the reasons above given I look on the dates of the Guptas as undoubted, and, consequently, whichever theory we adopt, they must not be disturbed.\n\nA third solution would be to assume simply that the Gupta coins were inferior mintages, issued by some of the Gupta kings for local purposes, and that they were, and were meant to be, mere copies of coins with which the people in those places had long been familiar. This seems to be by no means an improbable view of the case. Nothing is more purely conventional than the stamps on money. We now imitate Roman coins, and put Latin inscriptions on them, and there seems no reason why the Guptas in the fifth century may not have found it expedient, in addition to their own beautiful coins, to issue a lower class of money, on which they tried to copy the previously current forms as closely as possible.\n\nI have now stated fully, and I hope fairly, the whole of the difficulties arising out of these coinages, in so far as they seem to bear on the dates I am now advocating. I have done this in deference to the great names who attach such importance to the evidence of these coins, though my own impression is that it is a work of supererogation. As in the case of the Skanda Gupta Junagar inscription, a recent reading seems to me to have put the case beyond the limit of controversy.\n\nAs far back as 1859, Mr. Thomas deciphered the name Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka on a large number of coins found in Guzerat,\u00b9 and subsequently Mr. Justice Newton published four of the coins in 1862, and fully confirmed this reading\u00b2 and neither of these gentlemen dispute the fact, that though the names have not yet been read they must belong to kings of the Balabhi family, the descendants of Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka or Bha\u1e6d\u0101rka.\n\n\u00b9 J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. vi. p. lxxii. \u00b2 Loc. c. pl. 2, pl. 1, and p. xiii.\nNow, assuming for the sake of argument, that neither the Guptas nor the Balabhi kings, nor any body else ever dated either coin or inscription from the Balabhi era\u2014which is the view of the case now almost universally adopted\u2014still, all are agreed as to the succession; no one disputes that the Sahs came first, after them the Guptas, and then the Balabhis. If we allow 200 for the first we cannot allow less than 150 years for the Guptas, and we must admit fifty or some such number of years before the Sen\u00e2patis of the Balabhi dynasty became Mah\u00e2r\u00e2jas and coined money. These coins are depicted on Mr. Newton's plate just referred to, ranging through four centuries at least, with a change in design and execution so infinitesimally small that a layman could hardly tell which is the first or which is the last. There is a gradation I admit, but it is not so great as can be traced between the best and worst of Skanda Gupta's coins,\\(^1\\) in so far as execution is concerned. There are differences in the forms of the inscription which are clearly pointed out by Mr. Newton in his paper just referred to, but they are so small as only to be discernable by the initiated. Be this, however, as it may, one thing I fancy no one will dispute, which is that the whole Gupta period, 150 or 165 years, elapsed between the last Sah and the first Saurastrian coin of the Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka type, and while this is so, and makes so little difference in the coinage, we need make no difficulty, if 100 years elapsed between the last Sah and the first Gupta; but, more than this, now that we have got coins of this type behind the Guptas, as well as before, all that can be said is that this type of coinage endured through the whole of the three dynasties, with as little change from the original conventional type as the skill of the artist employed would admit of. If this is so, any chronological argument based on the evidence of these coins seems to me absolutely worthless.\n\nIt may seem strange, according to European experience, that a series of coins should exist through six or seven centuries with so little change; but we must be cautious in applying rules derived from our knowledge of the West to\n\n\\(^{1}\\) J. R. A. S. xii., pl. ii., No. 44 to 51.\nwhat may have happened in the East, and in all instances I fancy it a sound rule to adhere to the maxim that history must govern numismatics, and that numismatics must not be allowed to govern history. So far as I can judge, these Bhatt\u0101raka coins, coupled with Skanda Gupta\u2019s Junagar inscription, are by themselves sufficient to prove the case; and when to these we can add all the other historical coincidences noticed above, and to be mentioned hereafter, I cannot see that the Gupta era can possibly be considered any longer as doubtful.\n\n**Mauryas and \u0100ndhras.**\n\n| Maurya Dynasty, 130 Years. | A.D. |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Chandragupta               | 326  |\n| Bimbis\u0101ra                  | 301  |\n| A\u015boka                     | 276  |\n| Suyasas                   | 240  |\n| Dasaratha                 | 230? |\n| Sangata                   | 220? |\n| Indrap\u0101lita                | 212? |\n| Somas\u0101rman                | 210  |\n| Sasadharman               | 203  |\n| Vrihadratha               | 195  |\n\n| \u015aunga Dynasty, 45 Years.   |      |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Pushpamitra                | 188  |\n| Agnimitra                 | 152  |\n| Sujyeshtha                | 144  |\n| Vasumitra                 | 137  |\n| \u0100rdraaka                  | 129  |\n| Pulindaka                 | 127  |\n| Ghosha\u015bvasu                | 124  |\n| Vajramitra                | 121  |\n| Bh\u0101gavata                 | 112  |\n| Devabh\u016bti                 | 86   |\n\n| K\u0101nwa Dynasty, 112 Years. |      |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| V\u0101sudeva                  | 76   |\n| Bh\u016bmimitra                | 67   |\n| N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a                  | 53   |\n| Su\u1e63arman                  | 41   |\n| died                      | 31   |\n\n| \u0100ndhra Dynasty.           |      |\n|---------------------------|------|\n| Sipraka                   | 31   |\n| Krishna                   | ...A.D. 8 |\n\nThe fixation of the dates of the dynasties anterior to the rise of the great Guptas, rest on somewhat different ground from that of the kings\u2019 reigns of which we have just been treating. It is true we have a sufficient number of inscriptions in the Western Caves and elsewhere to fill a volume, and some of them with dates; but generally speaking, like most Buddhist inscrip-\ntions, they are the records of the pious munificence of private individuals, or of kings as such. Occasionally the donor mentions the king's reign in which he lived, but never thinks of recording his father's name, or any of those particulars which everybody then knew, but which we would now so like to know. When the king himself is the author of an inscription, instead of boasting of his lineage and his prowess as the Brahmanical kings did, whose inscriptions we have just been treating of\u2014he merely records his name in the humblest terms, as if his only object was to identify the benefaction of which he was the author. It must also be added that these inscriptions have not yet been translated with such critical care as would enable us to place implicit reliance on their indications. This arises in a great measure from the nature of the texts themselves. When an inscription is on a copper-plate or small stone-slab, it can easily be examined by the translator himself, or a rubbing or impression obtained which is nearly equal to the original. The Cave inscriptions, however, are generally so placed and so large, that rubbings or impressions are extremely difficult to be obtained; and as many of them were copied by persons who were not familiar with the character and ignorant of the language in which they were written, errors of transcription were inevitable in spite of the most painstaking desire for accuracy.\n\nAll this will no doubt be remedied before long; but meanwhile the Pur\u0101\u1e47as fortunately supply us with some information which seems trustworthy for the period we are now treating of, though very little that we can glean from them of what they say of dynasties after the beginning of the fifth century can be depended upon. Before the fifth century, however, they furnish us with a list of dynasties, stated to be consecutive, with the names of the kings, and the length of their reigns and other particulars, all of which are so reasonable and so in accordance with what we find from other sources, that I see very little reason to doubt their general correctness.\n\nThe first thing that strikes us in examining these lists is that their authors have not at all events exaggerated the lengths of\nthe kings' reigns. According to the V\u0101yu and Matsya,\\(^1\\) the whole extended to 736 years, and according to the most lengthened adjustment that can be made\u2014to 761, a difference of only 25 years, which in such a case is of slight importance. During that time 53 or 54 kings reigned, giving an average of very little more than 14 years to each king. Taking even the \u0100ndhra kings alone, we have 30 kings reigning 460 years or little more than 15 years each,\\(^2\\) so that this at least gives an air of probability to the whole.\n\nWe have no difficulty whatever as regards the initial date of this long list of kings. As long ago as Sir William Jones' time, Chandra Gupta was recognised as the Sandracottus of the Greeks, and generally chronologists have agreed to fix the first year of his reign as 315 B.C. My impression is we can now get even nearer than this. A\u015boka, in his inscriptions dated in the 12th year after his inauguration, the 16th after his accession, mentions the name of five Greek Kings, among whom was Magas of Cyrene, who died 257 B.C., and the inscription must therefore be before that date. As I have had occasion before to point out,\\(^3\\) the only year when all these kings were alive together was 256, which we may assume as the 16th of A\u015boka, with a limit of error of one year either way. His predecessor was Bimbas\u0101ra, to whom the Pur\u0101\u1e47as give 25 years; but the Mah\u0101vanso, a preferable authority in this case, allows 28, and thus places his accession 300 B.C. Both authorities allow Chandra Gupta 24 to 25, so that we cannot well bring his date below 325 B.C.\\(^4\\) This date, too, it appears to me, would accord better than 315, with what we learn of this king from Alexander's historians, but it is not necessary to go into the question here.\n\n\\(^1\\) Wilson, V. P., p. 484.\n\n\\(^2\\) After the destruction of the \u0100ndhra kings, the Vishnu Pur\u0101\u1e47a goes on to say (Wilson, p. 474.)\u2014\u201cAfter these will reign 7 Abhiras, 10 Gardhabas, 16 \u015aakas, 8 Yavanas, 14 Tusharas, 13 Mundas, together 79 princes, who will be sovereigns for 1399 years.\u201d We now know that many, if not all of these dynasties were contemporary; but the average of their reigns, which is all we are here concerned with, gives only 17 years and a half, and the other Pur\u0101\u1e47as with the same number of years, enumerate 55 and 89 kings, so the average duration of their reigns at all events looks like truth.\n\n\\(^3\\) Quarterly Review, Sep., 1860, referring to Justin, Historiae, xxvi. 2.\n\n\\(^4\\) The Mahawanso (Turnour's translation, xlvi.) gives him 34, but this I fancy includes the period of confusion during which the Brahmin Kau\u1e6dilya ruled after the death of Nanda.\nIt is much more difficult to get a satisfactory final date for the \u0100ndhra dynasty from external sources. If, however, the Yue-gnai, who sent an embassy to China in 408,\\(^1\\) is the Yadnya \u015ar\u012b of our lists, it would settle the question.\n\nThe name is so like those it has generally been assumed, that this identity was established, and his date \u2014 from Puranic calculation \u2014 so closely agrees with this, that its probability may fairly be assumed. We are told, however, that Yue-gnai means, in Chinese, \"beloved of the moon,\" and as we certainly have a Chandra \u015ar\u012b, or Chandra Gupta, who was Adhir\u0101ja of India, at this date, we must pause before affirming the identity. Whether we assume that he was the first or second of that name, is of no consequence, the date 82 and 93 A.G. at Sanchi Oudeypore are all that is required. There seems, however, very little reason to doubt but that the two kings were contemporary, or nearly so. So little confidence do I feel in the nominal similarity, that I have not, in the table prefixed to this section, attempted to adjust the dates so as to meet it; but as we have a margin of seven years at the end\u2014between 429 and 436\u2014it would have been easy to make it fit exactly. I am inclined to place much more reliance on the coincidence of the name of his grandson Chandra \u015ar\u012b, in the Vish\u1e47u and Matsya Pur\u0101\u1e47as, and Chandra Vijaya, in the Bh\u0101gavat,\\(^2\\) with the Chandra Varma Ga\u1e47apati mentioned by Samudra Gupta, in the eighteenth line of his Allahabad inscription.\\(^3\\) If my chronology is correct, the dates fit exactly; and it was just about the time that India resolved itself into four great divisions: the \u0100\u1e63wapati, or kings of Delhi; the Gajapati, or Lords of Orissa;\\(^4\\) the Narapati, or Cholas\\(^5\\) of the south, and the Ga\u1e47apatis, who occupied the central portions, which are now known generally as the Nizam's territories. This is just such a position as we would expect an \u0100ndhra dynasty to occupy after the death of their last great monarch Yadnya \u015ar\u012b, and the rise of the power of the Guptas.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) De Guigne's Histoire des Huns, vol. i. p. 45.\n\n\\(^2\\) Wilson's V.

In certain epochs of Indian history certain names seem to go in bunches, and though it is puzzling occasionally to discriminate among them, their presence is a sure indication of their age, and, to my mind, establishes the correctness of the Pur\u0101\u1e47as in placing Chandra \u015ar\u012b in the first thirty years of the fifth century.\\(^2\\)\n\nIf these identifications should be sustained, they would go far to prove that the two Gupta dates\u201482 and 93 A.G.\u2014which we possess, belong to the first, and not to the second, Chandra Gupta; and consequently that the Samudra of the Allahabad inscription ascended the throne after 411 A.D., which I confess, from many circumstances, I think the most probable arrangement. If this is so, it is not impossible that the Hastivarna of the 17th line of the same inscription, may be the \u015ar\u012b Hastina of the Benares copper plates.\\(^3\\) To enable this to be so, would require that the latter should have reigned more than 40 years. Though not impossible, it is so improbable, that it is hardly worth insisting upon till further information crops up.\n\nBefore leaving this inscription it may be worth while pointing out that in the same line\u2014the 18th, we have N\u0101gadatta and the N\u0101ga N\u0101gasena, who are, no doubt, the N\u0101ga kings mentioned in the Pur\u0101\u1e47as, in the same line with the Guptas,\\(^4\\) and so mixed up with them, that Wilford\\(^5\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) J.

Indeed, I believe that now we have got hold of the clue, every name mentioned by Samudra Gupta could be identified, if any competent Sanskrit scholar would undertake the task.\n\nBy far the most important name in this dynasty, however, is Gotamiputra. From the inscription engraved by his widow on the Nassick Cave,\\(^1\\) as well as from other sources, we learn that he was Mah\u0101r\u0101ja Adhir\u0101ja of India; that he had conquered all those countries which Rudra Sah in the bridge inscription boasts that he possessed;\\(^3\\) and his name occurs so often and so prominently, that it would be most important that his date should be ascertained if possible.\n\nAs before mentioned, the enumeration of the \u0100ndhra lists allows a margin of about 20 to 30 years on comparing the additions of the reigns in the Matsya with the totals quoted in the other Pur\u0101\u1e47as. This may be adjusted either by filling up the list from the other Pur\u0101\u1e47as, or by giving these years to the successor of this king, who according to the Nassick inscription, seems to have been Vasitiputra, the father of Pulomavi, who figures as his son in the Puranic lists.\n\nThe discrepancy, however, is very much reduced by allowing Yadnya \u015ar\u012b 29 years, which, according to the Vish\u1e47u and V\u0101yu Pur\u0101\u1e47as, was the true length of his reign, instead of the nine years of the Matsya.\\(^3\\) Not only are these better authorities, but from his numerous inscriptions and coins we learn how important the king really was, and it seems impossible to limit his reign to the shorter date. I look on him as practically the last of the \u0100ndhra\u2019s, and that it was from him that Chandra Gupta wrested the Adhir\u0101jaship of India. Be this as it may, this evidence, as far as it goes, places Gotamiputra certainly in the beginning of the fourth century. It may be that he ascended the throne in 312 or 318, or even a little later, but he cannot be removed far from this period.\\(^4\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. v. 42. \\(^2\\) J.B.B.R.A.S. vi. p. ii. p. 120. \\(^3\\) Wilson, V.P., p. 473. \\(^4\\) There are two dates in the Nassick inscriptions I. and II. J.B.B.R.A.S., v. 42 and 47, which, as they at present stand translated, seem to conflict with each other. The first is 19 from an unspecified era, but seems to be in the reign of\nFrom the first time I read Turnour's abstract of the Dalad\u00e1vanso,\\(^1\\) I felt convinced from the internal evidence that this was the king who figures on these curious episodes, but the name there being given merely as P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0du it is impossible to prove this. Curiously enough we have at Kanheri an inscription on a copper-plate extracted from a Dagoba there, which mentions this very relic with a date 245\\(^2\\) or 325 A.D., which is just about the date mentioned in the Ceylonese annals. The king's name is apparently Kripa or Karna, only a relation of the exalted \u015ar\u0101mi Kar\u1e47a of the victorious \u0100ndhrabhritya family. Considerable doubt, however, hangs over this reading, as the plate is not forthcoming, and Dr. Stevenson was forced to trust to an indifferent copy. Whether Gotamiputra is hereafter discovered or not under any of these titles, we have the \u0100ndhras in power at the date we are treating of, and that for our present purpose is sufficient.\n\nIn another place I have touched on the architectural evidence which render this date for the Nassick Cave almost certain,\\(^3\\) and there are a number of little incidents of an architectural character which do not allow me to doubt it. If this is so, we come to a curious historical inference, which is that this king must really have been the founder of Balabhi and the establisher of that era. According to Mr. Justice Newton, the Sah dates extend down to 235 A.D., with one or two doubtful names afterwards. This would allow time for the rise of the \u0100ndhras on their ruins and the foundation of a new capital of Western India by Gotamiputra in 318. According to this view Sri Gupta would have been viceroy to the \u0100ndhras; but it is by no means necessary that his rule\n\nPadma or Pulom\u0101vi, the successor of Gotamiputra, and if this is so, and as Dr. Stevenson conjectures it is the Balabhi era, it would make that era commence with the death of the great king. The second is in the 24th year of the \"Modern era,\" and the act recorded is apparently by order of Gotamiputra. This would make the foundation of the era coincident with the accession and the inscription date three years after his death, as he reigned only 21 years. These discrepancies can only be settled by a careful re-examination of the texts. My impression meanwhile is, that the Balabhi era dates from his accession, and consequently six years after the date which from Pur\u0101nic calculations I have assigned to that event.\n\n\\(^1\\) J.

Any of Gotamiputra's successors anterior to Yadnya \u015ar\u012b may have appointed him as Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101raka Sen\u0101pati was afterwards by \u015ail\u0101ditya, and as in the latter case, his grandson founded the greatness of his family in the decline and decay of that of his patrons. The one point I would insist on here is that Gotamiputra was Lord Paramount of India in 318-19 when the Balabhi era was established, probably on the building of the city. It was afterwards the western capital of both the Guptas and the Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drian Bha\u1e6d\u1e6d\u0101rakas, and to me, at least, it appears quite certain that both these families dated all their coins and inscriptions from this era.\n\nIt may be difficult to prove all this absolutely. In the present state of our information perhaps impossible, but on a fair balance of all the probabilities of the case this view seems to me to accord perfectly with all the evidence I am acquainted with, and I know of no other scheme which meets the exigencies of the case in anything like an equal degree.\n\n**Sah Kings of Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra.**\n\n| Sah Kings of Saur\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra |\n|-------------------------|\n| Nahapana ... ... ...

The difficulties are sufficiently great when a name is repeated in two places in some nearly similar Indian languages, but when the difference is so great as between Greek or Chinese with Sanskrit or Pali, the similarities of sound are so untrustworthy as to be of little or no value, and had better be put on one side till, at least, the investigation is further advanced.\nand we, therefore, depend almost wholly on their coins for our knowledge of the existence of this family, as well as for their dates. As before mentioned, the three principal authorities differ to the extent of 235 years as to the era from which these coins should be dated, a circumstance which does not inspire us with much confidence in numismatic evidence, in so far at least as India is concerned.\n\nI confess myself quite unable to follow Mr. Thomas's reasoning on the subject, and as I believe the \u015ar\u012b Harsha era from which he dates them is merely a blunder of Albir\u00fbni's, and had no real existence, we may for the present, at least, put it on one side, pending some further elucidation, which its author may bring to bear on the subject.\n\nBhau Daji's initial date (78 A.D.) appears to me equally untenable, except in the contingency before mentioned: that it may be found necessary that the Sahs should overlap the Guptas, in order to explain the anomalies of their coinage. As my own conviction, for reasons given above, is, that this will not be necessary, it also, may be passed over for the present.\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. Justice Newton's theory, which would place Nahapana about 56 B.C., seems to me to suit perfectly all the exigencies of the case, so far as I at least am acquainted with them.\n\nIf I am correct in agreeing with Dr. Stevenson, that Devabh\u00fbti, B.C. 86, was the excavator of the great Karli cave,\u00b9 the position of the Nahapana inscriptions, there and elsewhere, would be easily explicable, and the whole series of cave inscriptions brought into strict accordance with their architecture. The date, too, in Rudra D\u0101man's Bridge inscription,\u00b2 would also be in accordance with what we know. It is dated in 72 of the Sah era,\u2014according to this view A.D. 15; and he states that \"after twice thoroughly conquering S\u0101takarni, lord of Dakshinapatha, he did not completely destroy him on account of their near connexion.\" Now, according to my calculation, S\u0101takarni I. reigned from A.D. 10 to 28. This would accord perfectly, and if there were no other king of\n\n\u00b9 J.B.B.R.A.S. v. 163. \u00b2 J.B.B.R.A.S. vol. vi. pt. ii. p. 18.\nthat name, would be final; but as there are several of the same name in the dynasty it is not altogether decisive; it would, however, be extremely difficult to fit any other of that name to this date; on Mr. Thomas's theory it would be impossible. At present, therefore, it can only be put down as only one of the curious coincidences which occur, but which are so numerous as to amount to something like proof positive.\n\nAnother important indication is Gotamiputra's boast, if Bhau Daji's translation is to be depended upon, that he had exterminated the descendants of Khajar\u0101ta (pali) Kshahar\u0101ta (Sanskrit), who can hardly be other than this race. Be this as it may, for reasons stated above it seems to me indispensable for history that they should have ceased to reign before Gotamiputra raised his family to pre-eminence on that side of India. I may also add that it seems extremely probable that these Sah kings may be identified with the Yu\u010d-che, at least, if any stress may be laid upon such a passage as the following: Ma-twan-lin, after stating that the Yu\u010d-che conquered India, about 26 B.C., goes on to say that \"they having become extremely rich and powerful, remained in the state till the time of the latter Hans, who began to reign A.D. 222.\" \"It results from hence,\" says our translator \"that the Scythians must have been masters of Western India, from about B.C. 26 till A.D., 222, that is for a space of 248 years. The first invasion of India, by the Yu\u010d-che or Scythians must have taken place before the reign of Vikram\u0101ditya, whose celebrated era began fifty-six years before ours, and originated from a complete defeat of the Scythian armies by that prince.\" (See Colebrooke's Indian Algebra, Lassen, etc.)\n\nHaving reached this celebrated era, I wish to broach a theory regarding it, which will at first sight, I have no doubt, appear utterly untenable; but which, if true, will clear away most of the difficulties of the chronology of this period. My conviction is that no such person as the \u015aak\u0101ri Vikram\u0101ditya ever existed anterior to the Christian era, or within some hundreds of years of that time.\n\n1 J. B. B. R. A. S. vi., p. 117. 2 J. A. S. B. vol. vi., p. 63.\nIn the first place, the Puranic lists are very full and consistent about this period, but no Pur\u0101\u1e47a hints at the existence of such a prince. He belonged to no royal family. He possessed no recognizable kingdom, and had no descendants. No coin of his has ever been found, nor does his name occur in any of the multifarious inscriptions of the period;\u00b9 and all the events of his reign are unhistorical and mythical to an extent which occurs with no other king of the period. Take, for instance, the defeat of the Sac\u00e6 just mentioned 57 B.C. Albir\u016bn\u012b states\u2014and though he generally blunders, he must have had some authority\u2014\"L\u2019\u00e8re de Saca est post\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle de Vikram\u0101ditya de 135 ans. Saca est le nom d\u2019un prince qui a r\u00e9gn\u00e9 sur les contr\u00e9es situ\u00e9es entre l\u2019Indus et la mer. Vikram\u0101ditya marcha contre lui, mit son arm\u00e9e en d\u00e9route et le tua sur le territoire de Korour,\" etc.\u00b2 Vikram\u0101ditya, according to this account, must have been nearly 200 years old when he did all this. But it is only one among many instances which have so puzzled Wilford, and all those who have even meddled with the question.\n\nMy impression is, that some time after Vikram\u0101ditya of Malwa had rendered the name so celebrated, the Hindus, on the revival of Brahminism, wished to possess an era which should, at least, be older than the Buddhist era of S\u0101l\u012bv\u0101hana. At that time the Sah era, established by Nahapana, was vacant, having fallen into disuse on the destruction of that dynasty, and its supercession by the era of Balabhi, and that the Hindus then appropriated it by attaching to it the name it now bears, and inventing the history requisite to render its adoption feasible.\u00b3\n\nThis theory would not only have the advantage of fixing the date of Nahapana with certainty as 57 B.C., but it would clear away an amount of rubbish which has puzzled and disgusted\n\n\u00b9 The Vikram\u0101ditya, mentioned in Gotamiputra\u2019s inscription (J. B. B. R. A. S. vol. v. p. 43), is evidently, from the company in which he is named, of prehistoric antiquity.\n\u00b2 Thomas Prinsep, vol. i. p. 268.\n\u00b3 I am very much inclined to agree with Bhau Daji when he says, that nothing is dated from this era before the 11th century, (J. B. B. R. A. S. viii. p. 242). There is certainly more truth in the assertion than appears at first sight. My impression is, that the era was invented in the age of Bhoja (A.D. 993), or rather by the revived Ch\u0101lukyas, A.D. 973, 1003 (J. R. A. S. vol. iv. p. 4).\nevery one who has approached this branch of the subject. It would, besides this, remove all the uncertainty which now exists as to whether the Saka or Samvat eras should be used for coins or inscriptions, where neither are specified.\n\nI cannot myself feel any doubt about the matter, and I would therefore ask others at all events to consider it dispassionately. If they do so, I feel confident they will arrive at the same result as I have done.\n\n**Buddhist Chronology.**\n\n37 DESCENTS IN 600?

Geo. Turnour first examined the Ceylonese annals, he became aware of a discrepancy of about sixty years, existing between the time of the death of Buddha and the accession of A\u015boka, as stated in the Mah\u0101vanso, when compared with the conclusion we have arrived at from Puranic and Grecian sources. In other words, assuming the true date of the Nirv\u0101\u1e47a to be 543, which the Ceylonese, the Burmese, and all the Indo-Chinese nations insist upon as absolute, and reckoning the reigns thence, this chronology places the accession of Chandra Gupta 162 A.D. or 381 B.C., instead of 325, which as we have shown above, is certainly his true date, within very narrow limits of error either way.\n\nNow that we know all the circumstances of the case, it does not appear to me difficult to see either why this false adjustment was made, nor how it was effected.\n\nThe first civilized king of Ceylon, according to their annals, was Vijayo. He landed from the opposite coast,\n\n---\n\n1 In the Ayeen Akbaree (vol. ii. p. 54), it is stated that Bhoja, the son of Munja, succeeded in 541 of the era of Vikram\u0101ditya. As no one now believes that this Bhoja lived before the very end of the tenth century, it looks very like as if he dated from the son of Bahram Gour, not from the \u015aak\u0101ri; but wherever you find this era, there is nothing but confusion.\n\n2 Turnour's Mahawanso, p. 48; J.A.S.B. vol. vi. p. 714, &c.\nprobably introduced Buddhism, or, at all events, was the founder of that dynasty who held the sovereignty of the island for long afterwards. The Ceylonese annalists state that his landing was in the same year with the death of the founder of the religion; a coincidence so remarkable, as to look very like such a pious fraud, as is too common with priests in all ages. If we assume that it took place 56 or 60 years after the Nirv\u00e2na, the whole difficulty vanishes, and all the synchronisms come right.\n\nThe mode in which the adjustment was effected was simply by taking the requisite number of years from the dynasty of the Nandas, to whom the Pur\u00e2nas give 100 years,\\(^1\\) the Mah\u00e2vanso only 44. These Nandas seem to have been a low caste race; the Vishnu Pur\u00e2na calls them \u015a\u00fbdras, and the Buddhist annalists have not a kind word to say for them. If I am correct in assuming that the coins depicted in the 7th vol. of the Journal of the Bengal Society, plate 48, belong to this family, they were serpent worshippers, whom consequently the Buddhists would not hesitate in putting on one side. Be this as it may, both the Ceylonese and Burmese\\(^2\\) annals agree in placing the accession of Mah\u00e2 Padma, the first Nanda, in 425 B.C. On the other hand, our calculations from Greek synonyms place the accession of Chandra Gupta 325, leaving exactly the 100 years of the Pur\u00e2nas between these dates, which, therefore, I feel very little doubt in assuming as correct, or very nearly so.\n\nThis period includes of course the ten and twelve years of anarchy, usually called the expiation of Ch\u00e2nakya, which intervenes between the death of the last Nanda and the accession of Chandra Gupta.\n\nThe Ceylonese annals desert us on the accession of Bimbis\u00e2ro, who ascended the throne of Magadha 603 B.C., and in whose 16th year \u015a\u00e2kya Muni attained Buddhahood, in the 35th year of his age.

The sequence of events I look upon as nearly certain.\n\n**Early Chronology.**\n\nBeyond 691 B.C. we have little to guide us except the doctrine of averages, but unsatisfactory as that may be, there are one or two circumstances that induce me to think that the early chronology of the Hindus ought not to be so entirely rejected as is too generally the case.\n\nFrom Arrian\\(^3\\) and Pliny\\(^4\\) we learn that when the Greeks\u2014probably Megasthenes\u2014were there, the pandits of these days presented them with lists of kings, 153 or 154 in number, who reigned before Alexander. Now, if we count the lists of Solar kings from Ikshw\u0101ku to Vrihadratha, and they certainly were the supreme race during the two first ages, and then follow the Lunar line from the Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata to Chandra Gupta, we get 150 descents; and if we count from Marichi the 154 of Pliny. This is so far satisfactory as it tends to prove that we have now the same lists as were shown to the Greeks more than 2000 years ago.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) So little importance do I attach to the family of \u015a\u0101kya Muni in a chronological point of view, that I would not allude to them even in a note, if it were not that the Pur\u0101\u1e47as have been blamed for making \u015a\u0101kya the father of Suddhodana instead of the son (Wilson, V. P., p. 463). They are quite correct, however. It is only one of the 1001 instances in which we find a king or prince adopting his grandfather's name.\n\n\\(^2\\) Indica, cix.\n\n\\(^3\\) V. P. 466.\n\n\\(^4\\) Nat. Hist. vi. c. 17.\nArrian makes these kings reign 6042 years, Pliny 5402; and though both are inadmissible, they show that the monstrous system of Yugas had not then been invented, and the falsification had not gone beyond the extent of duplication.\n\nApplying to these lists the average we obtained above, of 16 years, we get back to about 2800 B.C. But if we apply 18 years, which does not appear to me at all an extravagant average, considering how many insignificant names must have dropped out of so long a list, we get back almost exactly to the date of the Kali Yug, 3101 B.C.\n\nThis I cannot help considering as a true date. It does not make an even sum from any known Indian era. It is not a multiple or sub-multiple of any epoch, and stands, and always has stood, alone in Indian Chronology as something unaccounted for. The three previous Yugas are avowedly astronomical calculations, and are useless for chronological purposes, but not so this one. It may be the date at which it was supposed the Aryans first crossed the Indus, and it may be the epoch of some event that took place in Central Asia before they left their original seats; but it appears to me hardly to admit of a doubt, that it is a true date handed down from generation to generation.\n\nIf we take it as I have put it above, and apply the average to each king's reign, the events of the R\u00e2m\u00e2yana took place about 2000 years B.C.; those of the Mah\u00e2bh\u00e2rata about 1300 B.C. These may not be considered as very satisfactory determinations, but they are probably as near the truth as anything we are now likely ever to attain.\n\nI have now run through the whole subject of Indian Chronology, stating as briefly, as was compatible with clearness, the views I entertain regarding the various epochs which have come under consideration. I need hardly say that it would have been easy to have extended these remarks to more than twice their present extent without saying all, or nearly all, that could be said on the subject. Even then, however, I should have been obliged to leave out the architectural argument which has been the thread I most rely\nupon to guide us through the labyrinth. I look upon it as absolutely certain that there is a gradual progression in the style of architectural buildings in India, as there is in every country in the world, and once it is mastered, the succession is certain. The only difficulty is that sometimes the progress is faster, sometimes slower, and it requires care not to be led away by adopting too uniform a scale in this respect. But retrogression is always impossible, and caprice hardly ever interferes in any degree. It is my knowledge of Indian architecture that gives me confidence in the scheme of chronology propounded in the previous pages. The numismatist or scholar must, of course, be allowed in like manner to apply their own test, and if we differ, it is for others to decide which class of evidence is most entitled to acceptance. As I cannot here adduce the details of the architectural argument, I can only state that I have found it accord throughout so perfectly with all the historical facts I am acquainted with, that I feel very great confidence that the chronological scheme propounded in the preceding pages will eventually be established, in all its leading or essential features.\n\n1 Since the above paper was in type, a curious instance of the prevalence of the Balabhi era has been brought to my notice. An inscription has been found in the Temple of Ambarnath, near Kalyan, opposite Bombay. It is dated Samvat 782. As the Temple is certainly not earlier than the end of the 11th century, this must be from the foundation of the city of Balabhi. The character of the alphabet in which it is written fully confirms this ascription.\nART. III.\u2014The Poetry of Mohamed Rabadan, of Arragon.\nBy the Hon. H. E. J. Stanley.\n\nIn the preceding number of the Journal, this poem had reached the birth of Abraham: the portion contained in the present issue consists of the life of Abraham, the history of the line of Isaac ending with Jesus Christ, and the line of Ishmael down to Heshim, great-grandfather of Muhammad. The description of the sacrifice of Ishmael brings to mind the mysteries or plays in which Abraham\u2019s sacrifice of his son is still represented in Spain at the Church festivals.\n\nIn the account of Abraham going on his way to the sacrifice, Rabadan has interwoven a legend which is Rabbinical rather than Mussulman; according to this legend, Abraham saw in a vision the mysterious foundations of the Earth, by which he understood that the designs of Providence are incomprehensible. Mr. Morgan has given this passage a little differently from what it is in the original, and a note in the British Museum MS., apparently in his handwriting, says, Aqui ay un grande yerro de el autor, \u201chere the author has made a great mistake!\u201d and the word cuestas de un toro, on the back of a bull, has been erased; and the word cuernos, horns, written in the margin in the same handwriting; his translation is, \u201cHe extended his sight as far as his eyes could reach, and beheld, O wonderful prospect! this earthly globe the world resting upon the point of a bull\u2019s horn, the bull standing upon a great fish, which fish lay extended upon a vast lake of water.\u201d\n\nWith respect to this account of the sacrifice, Mr. Deutsch informs me that, \u201cthe Talmud and the various Midrashim\ncontain, mutatis mutandis nearly all the legendary features in this poem. The story of the sacrifice is a favourite subject of the early Jewish Haggadists, and the manner in which Satan\u2014Sammael\u2014appears here successively in his three characters as accuser, seducer, and angel of death, is as characteristic as are the different guises under which he tries to gain the confidence of the Dramatis Person\u00e6. As regards the primitive unstable nature of the Kosmos and the manifold expedients resorted to for its more firm and final foundation, the Haggadah contains two very striking passages. The one (Pirke Rabbi Eliezer, p. 5) speaks of the succession of dissolutions that followed one another; reducing creation to ever new chaos\u2014\"even as a great palace, built by mortal man, the foundations of which are not finally laid, and which swayeth hither and thither, until God created Repentance, and the Universe stood.\" The other passage (Pesachim, 118a) indicates God's Mercy as the only link that held the universe together before the Revelation of the Law.\"\n\nPadre de Mariam la limpia,\nEn el mundo especialada.\n\nMorgan gives the following passage in a note to these lines:\u2014\"To all this the expositors [of the Koran] add several traditions of the Eastern Christians, which but for them 'tis probable had been lost. One of them is, that God (according to the Alcoran) preserved her and her son from the Devil. Houssain Vaes, a noted historian, expounds this preservation in these words:\u2014'No child, says he, is born into the world, that the Devil does not touch and handle till he makes it cry, and except Miriam and her son, none were ever preserved and exempted from this handling.'\u2014This tradition seems to have some allusion to Original Sin.\"\u2014Morgan, vol. i. p. 183.\n\nNone of the genealogies of Muhammad are exact, or authoritatively established.\n\nThe next portion of this poem will contain the history of Heshim, the great-grandfather, Abdulmutalib, the grandfather, and Abdallah, the father of the Prophet.\nYSTORIA DE YBRAHIM ALEHISALEM, COMPUESTA EN VERSO SUELTO: COMIENZA DESDE SU NACIMIENTO Y LO QUE LE VINO CON EL REY NAMERUD.\n\n\u00c9l que naci\u00f3 de sus obras\nCercado en el monte seco,\nTuviendo por padre y madre\nSolo las dimes del cielo;\n\u00c9l que de catorce d\u00edas\nDespu\u00e9s de su nacimiento\nConoci\u00f3 al sostenedor\nDel cielo y sus movimientos;\n\u00c9l que en vez de los regalos\nQue dan a los ni\u00f1os tiernos\nSus padres lo spedrearon,\nAquellas inicuos perros;\n\u00c9l que de sus mismos padres\nFu\u00e9 tan perseguido, y puesto\nEn poder de su enemigo,\nPara ponello en el fuego.\nEste es aquel justo Ybr\u00e1h\u00edm\nA quien su madre en pariendo,\nLo llev\u00f3 a una cueva oscura\nDe un monte desierto y negro,\nPor guardalle del cuchillo\nDe aquel Rey falso y sediento\nNamerud de quien se cuentan\nTan endemoniados hechos.\nEste vid\u00f3 en su dormir\nUn triste infierno protento\nQue le desasosegaba\nSu falso y maldito pecho;\nY fu\u00e9 que en aquellos d\u00edas\nVi\u00f3 que naci\u00f3 un mancobo,\nQue su falsa adoraci\u00f3n\nLe abat\u00eda por el suelo.\nEs de saber que este Rey\nTen\u00eda mandamiento espreso\nQue le adorasen sus gentes\nComo Dios alto y supremo;\nY \u00e9l adoraba en los ydolos\nHechos de barro y madera,\nAl que le llamaban Teraq,\nMuy dorado y muy compuesto.\n\nAjunt\u00f3 sus adivinos,\nY todos se resolvieron\nQue pasasen \u00e1 cuchillo\nLos ni\u00f1os nacidos tiernos:\nY por acertar \u00e1 este\nQue fu\u00e9 llevado al desierto,\nDegoll\u00f3 doce mil ni\u00f1os\nEl tirano torpe y ciego.\nPues quando vin\u00f3 la noche\nSobre el triste ni\u00f1o tierno,\nYa le apretaba la hambre\nQuando en el mismo momento\nBaj\u00f3 Chebril, y le puso\nEn la boca sus dos dedos;\nPor el uno distilaba\nDulce leche, y as\u00ed mismo\nPor el otro miel sabrosa,\nY aqu\u00e9l era su sustento.\nPues \u00e1 los catorce d\u00edas\nQue tuvo su nacimiento,\nYa levant\u00f3 la cabeza\nY vi\u00f3 en el cielo un luzero,\nY dix\u00f3: \"este es sin duda\nEl Se\u00f1or que servir debo.\"\nY como vi\u00f3 que se pus\u00f3\nDebajo del hemisferio,\nDix\u00f3: \"no adoro Se\u00f1or\nQue se trasponer tan presto.\"\nVi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s salir la luna\nMuy clara y resplandeciente,\nY dix\u00f3: este es mi Se\u00f1or;\nMas en ver que se hab\u00eda puesto\nDix\u00f3: yo ser\u00e9 perdido\nSi no me acude el remedio.\"\nPas\u00f3 ansi toda la noche\nMaginando y trascendiendo,\nQu\u00e9 alma que Dios la toca\nJam\u00e1s puede estar durmiendo.\nY quando fu\u00e9 el claro d\u00eda,\nVi\u00f3 salir el claro Febo\n\n1 Climas, P. 2 Sustentador, P.\n5 Terah, P. 6 Pusiesen, P.\n9 Quando vin\u00f3 la ma\u00f1ana, P.\n3 De la sa\u00f1a, P. 4 Ydolatria, P.\n7 Perro, P. 8 Hierto, P.\nY dix\u00f3: este es mi Se\u00f1or\nQue mayor que todos estos;\nY viendo que hech\u00f3 el camino\nQue los otros hab\u00edan hecho\nDix\u00f3: \"no creo en Se\u00f1ores\nQue no quieren estar quedos;\"\nTodos estos son guiados\nPor un solo movimiento,\nY en aquel que los gobierna\nCreo, adoro y reverencio,\nY afirmo que uno solo\nQuien cri\u00f3 la tierra y cielo,\nY \u00e1 el procurar mi cara\nSin poner le otro aparcer.\nEn esto cay\u00f3 azaxado,\nAdorando y bendiciendo,\nConociendo \u00e1 su Hacedor\nPor conjunturas del cielo.\nPues como su madre estaba\nSiempre con aquel recelo,\nPus\u00f3le All\u00e1h en voluntad\nQue fuese \u00e1 ver si era muerto.\nFue y como lleg\u00f3 \u00e1 la cueva\nTop\u00f3 con aquel mancebo\nQue sin tiempo fue criado,\nSin aprender con maestro\nEstaba en tierra azaxado;\nY dixole: \"Y\u00e1 mancebo,\nPor ventura has visto un ni\u00f1o\nQue hoy hace el dia quinzeno\nQue lo dex\u00e9 en esta cueva,\nY no s\u00e9 que se habr\u00e1 hecho.\"\nBr\u00e1him se di\u00f3 \u00e1 conocer\n\u00c1 su madre, y ella luego\nLo tom\u00f3 sobre sus brazos\nCon muy crecido contento;\nY dixole: \"\u00bf \u00e1 quien adoras\nTan postrado por el suelo?\nSuele estar aqu\u00ed postrado\n\u00c9l que adoramos y creemos?\"\nDix\u00f3: \"Madre!

cumplir lo so\u00f1ado\nDegoll\u00f3 un grueso camello,\nY siendo despedazado\n\n\u00b9 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0646 sacrifice.\nReparti\u00f3 toda su carne\nA los pobres y

la segunda noche\nEstando muy reposado\nDurmiendo, oy\u00f3 que dec\u00eda\nLa voz: \"\u00a1oye, siervo amado,\nAllegate \u00e1 mi alcorben,\nEn mi nombre soberano,\nY lo pondr\u00e9 \u00e1 cuenta

claro\nDegoll\u00f3 una vaca y di\u00f3la\nA los mas necesitados,\nY dix\u00f3: \"Rey de los cielos,\nSi acaso este mi holocausto\nHas recibido de mi,\nSeame por ti revelado\nEn la noche venidera\nPor d\u00f3 yo quede saciado\nDe mi ofrecido servicio,\nY para lo que yo falta\nLo enmiende sin faltar punto\nA lo que estoy obligado.\"\nEsto dix\u00f3, y quando vin\u00f3\nLa noche tercera, y quando\nMas sosegado dorm\u00eda\nLo mismo le est\u00e1 llamando.\nEl se despert\u00f3 al momento,\nY habi\u00e9ndose levantado,\nDegoll\u00f3 un grueso carnero\nY por el orden contado,\nLo

dix\u00f3:\n\"Ibr\u00e1h\u00edm, haz holocausto\n\nEn mi nombre, y te dar\u00e9\nUn perdurable descanso.\"\nIbr\u00e1h\u00edm que ya despierto\nEstaba, y sobrealzado\nDe los pasados avisos,\nViendo que no hab\u00eda acertado\nA lo quel Se\u00f1or le pide\nEn los servicios pasados;\nDix\u00f3: \"Se\u00f1or poderoso,\nSabes que he sacrificado\nCamellos, vacas, carneros,\nEn tu nombre, y yo no

vejez,\nCosa muy de amigo caro;\nY al tiempo que mas contento\nVive, quieto y sosegado,\nY de tus grandes mercedes\nSatisfecho y muy pagado,\nY quando su amado hijo\nLe daba mayor regalo,\nQuando en la edad mas florida\nEstaba tierno y lozano,\nLe mandas que lo deguelle\nLuego con sus propias manos.\n\u00a1 O' cosa jamas o\u00edda!\nQuen los juicios humanos\nJuzgaren ser deste hecho\nMas que de

bajos,\nConsideraciones tristes\nQue no os levantais mas alto!\nQuan lexos sois del compas,\nComo os apartais del blanco\nD\u00f3 tira el Piadoso Rey\nCon su amor, gracia y amparo!\nConsideren los

ya el buen Br\u00e1h\u00edm\nVi\u00f3 patente el desenga\u00f1o\nDe lo que las quatro noches\nHabia sido revelado;\nImagine un buen sentido,\nUn pecho sincero y blando,\nEn un tan hirviente amor\nUn tan preciso mandado.\nNo pudiendo reposar,\nMaginando y sollozando,\nDeshecho en lagrimas vivas\nTom\u00f3 \u00e1 su hijo en sus brazos:\nEn la frente lo besaba,\nEntre los ojos y labios,\nY con lagrimas ardientes\nToda su cara ba\u00f1ando,\nNo le dexaba dormir,\nSiempre lo tenia apretado\n\u00c1 sus pechos, quel amor\nNo le daba mas espacio,\nAunque lo disimulaba;\nPor que tenia \u00e1 su lado\n\u00c1 Hechara la piadosa\nMadre d\u00e9l que est\u00e1 besando;\nPor no darle con tal nueva,\nTan grande pena y quebranto.\nNo pudo ser tan secreto\nQue no lo sintiese, y quando\nVio tan grande sentimiento\nY un amor tan demasiado,\nDix\u00f3 \u00e1 Br\u00e1h\u00edm: \"ques esto\nQue tan desasosegado\nTe siento toda esta noche,\nQue no duermes sollozando,\nY \u00e1 Ismael, mi caro hijo\nLo

blanco,\nY lavarle-has la cabeza\nCon olores almizcados:\nYo lo llevar\u00e9 conmigo\nDonde haga el holocausto.\"\nEsto dix\u00f3 el buen Br\u00e1h\u00edm,\nDando fin \u00e1 lo hablado:\nCon un profundo sospiro;\nCasi el corazon arrancado,\nY como su gran conduelma\nLe desasosiega tanto,\n\n1 Dan en esos lazos, P.\nQual la madre que le quitan\nEl hijo de su regazo,\nQuel mundo es lugar peque\u00f1o\nPara su pecho inflamado.\nAsi deste modo estaba\nEste justo agonizando,\nSobre su cama no coje,\nComo es lugar de regalo;\nY asi se levanta y luego\nSobre la tierra azaxdado,\nDix\u00f3 estas breves razones\nA su Se\u00f1or invocando:\n\u00a1 O Se\u00f1or, t\u00fa que criaste\nCon tu poderosa mano\nMi corazon de esta carne\nQue repugna tu mandado,\nSuplico \u00e1 tu alta

tierno\nCon muchos besos y abrazos,\nY le lav\u00f3 la cabeza\nComo le fu\u00e9 encomendado\nCon olorisimas aguas\n\nCANTO QUINTO DE LA YSTORIA TERCERA DE BRAHIM ALEHISALEM.\n\nCon el debido aparato\nQue \u00e1 su jornada convino,\nAl Se\u00f1or encomendado,\nY habiendose despedido\nDe Hechara la piadosa,\nComo atras habemos dicho;\nCon su hijo de la mano,\nFloreciente, hermoso y lindo,\nCamina el justo Br\u00e1h\u00edm\nA cumplir su sacrificio.\nLastimado va el buen viejo,\n\nConvinientes a tal caso,\nAlcanfor y mespolera\nEch\u00f3 en ella, quera usado\nAquell tiempo estos

\u00e1 los finados !\u201d\nRespondi\u00f3 la gran Princesa:\n\u201c Hijo, asi me lo ha mandado\nTu padre, y pues \u00e9l lo manda\nEs justo lo obedezcamos.\u201d\nQuando Ismael fu\u00e9 vestido\nCon los adrezos nombrados,\nDel sol quitaba la lumbre\nSu rostro glorificado.\nEntre tanto tom\u00f3 Br\u00e1h\u00edm\nUn pu\u00f1al disimulado,\nQuen un arca lo tenia\nAgudo y muy amolado,\nY pusoselo en la cinta\nEn su siniestro costado.\nDix\u00f3 Hechara: \u201c ya Br\u00e1h\u00edm,\nToma provision y quando\nMi hijo tuviere hambre,\nDarle has coma un bocado,\nY darle has de beber\nQuando lo veas desecado;\nY quando el dolor le aquexe\nCon este cendal preciado,\nLe cubriras la cabeza\nY el Se\u00f1or sea en vuestro amparo.\u201d\n\nConsiderando en su hijo\nLos bellos miembros tan tiernos,\nEn el tiempo mas florido,\nSu cara resplandeciente\nCon la luz del escogido;\nY por que en su propias manos\nHabia de ser homicido,\nY por que no le quedaba\nOtros ningun hijo vivo.\nEstas consideraciones\nLo llevan tan afligido,\nQuel corazon se le arranca\nCon mil profundos sospiros,\nY para questas congoxas\nNo le apreten tan contino,\nY aquella pella de acibar\nMezcla con algun alivio\nQuiso el Se\u00f1or ense\u00f1arle\nUn misterio en su camino;\nY quando mas descuidado\nDe semejante prodigio,\nAbrenle las siete tierras\nSus centros mas escogidos,\nPor do pudo ver Ibr\u00e1him\nLos mas profundos abismos\nSobre las cuestas de un pez,\nY aquel asentado y fixo\nSobre las cuestas de un toro.\nAlarg\u00f3 la vista y vid\u00f3\nEl toro sobre los ayres,\nY todo lo sobre dicho\nSobre una laguna de agua,\nCosa que aboba el sentido.\nDe aqui consider\u00f3 Br\u00e1him\nEl supremo poderio,\nY como no hay \u00e1 sus hechos\nRastro, camino ni tino;\nQuedando de toda duda\nSatishecho y destorcido,\nFirme, seguro y costante\nEn su holocausto emprendido.\nAndando de esta manera\nComo l\u00e1xaitan maldito\nSiempre h\u00e1 sido declarado\nAl hombre por enemigo,\nY su intento es deshacer\nLo que aplace al Rey divino;\nPara estorbar este hecho\nCon sus embustes malinos,\nSe le present\u00f3 en figura\nDe un viejo cano y le dixo:\n\"A donde llevas Ibr\u00e1him\nA degollar \u00e1 tu hijo?\nMira queres enga\u00f1ado\nDel Ibliz y su artificio,\nY no es mandado de Dios\nLo que en tus sue\u00f1os has visto.\"\nIbr\u00e1him que conoci\u00f3\nLa razon del perro inico:\n\"Aparta de mi, le dice,\n\nApedreado enemigo,\nQue no ser\u00e1s poderoso\nPara estorbar mi designio.\"\nCon esto se fu\u00e9 el traidor\nMenospreciado y corrido,\nComo vi\u00f3 que fu\u00e9 vac\u00edo\nSu traza falsa y traidora:\nY luego, sin partir mano,\nA Ismael se ha parecido,\nDiciendo como te lleva\nTu padre con tal distino,\nA degollarte mancebo,\nEnga\u00f1ado y decebido?\"\nDix\u00f3 Ismael: \"no hubo padre\nQue degollase \u00e1 su hijo,\nSin derecho de justicia:\nNo lleva razon tu dicho.\"\nReplic\u00f3 el Ebliz \u00a1\u00f3 mancebo!\nDice tu padre que ha sido\nQuatro noches avisado,\nPara lo que en sacrificio\nTe deguelle \u00a1\u00f3 triste joven!\nSolo en verte me lastimo.\"\nRespondi\u00f3le el buen mancebo:\n\"Pues si el Se\u00f1or se lo ha dicho,\nJusto es que mi padre cumpla\nPrecepto tan justo y digno;\nY pues con mi se contenta\nYo lo apruebo y lo confirmo.\"\nApart\u00f3se el axaitam,\nComo vi\u00f3 que fu\u00e9 en vac\u00edo\nSu traza falsa y traidora.\nIsmael con gran sentido\nLloraba por las razones\nQuel falso viejo le dixo,\nY mirando \u00e1 \u00e9l su buen padre\nLe pregunta \u00bf que has tenido\nQue lloras, dime que tienes,\nConsuelo de mis sospiros?\nDice Ismael \u00a1\u00f3 mi padre\nAqu\u00e9l viejo me ha advertido\nQue me llevas \u00e1 matar\nY aquesto me ha entristecido.\"\n\"Enxuga tus tristes ojos,\nHijo que cierto ha mentido\nEl falso viejo: no llores,\nYo soy tu guardia y tu abrigo.\"\nConsol\u00f3se el buen Ismael;\nLuego el Ebliz sobrevino,\n\n1 Variante.\nVuelto en figura de un ave\nY con las u\u00f1as y el pico\nEsbolotrando sus plumas\nCon semblante entristecido,\nDiciendo: \u201c\u00f3 triste mancebo!\nA tal desdicha tra\u00eddo\nQue has de morir degollado\nPor el padre que te hizo!\u201d\n\u00a1O\u2019ave! dix\u00f3 Ismael\nPor ventura nunca has visto\nPadre que \u00e1 su hijo mate\nSin merecer el castigo.\u201d\nReplic\u00f3 el ave maldita:\n\u201cSabe que tu padre ha dicho\nQue se lo mand\u00f3 el Se\u00f1or.\u201d\n\u201cPues si eso es as\u00ed, yo digo\nQue soy muy contento dello,\nY por merced lo recibo.\u201d\nY vuelto \u00e1 su amado padre,\nLe dice: \u201cya habras o\u00eddo\nLo que nos propuso el viejo\nY esta ave dice lo mismo.\u201d\n\u201cSabe, hijo, que en las aves\nHay gran secreto escondido,\nQue hay falsas como en las gentes\nQue ya Dios as\u00ed lo quiso.\u201d\nEl enemigo de All\u00e1h\nQuen los pasados enristros\nCay\u00f3 por tierra su astucia,\nSu fuerza y poder rendido,\nEn lo mas alto del monte\nLa quarta vez ha emprendido\nA tender sus falsos lazos,\nPensando acertar el tiro;\nY \u00e1 modo de eco dec\u00eda\nPuesto en el monte escondido:\n\u00a1O\u2019 triste de t\u00ed mancebo!\n\u00a1O\u2019 joven tierno y mezquino!\nComo

inclino\nAl sacrificio en tus manos,\nAl Se\u00f1or en su servicio.\nSuplicote, amado padre,\nPues no hay que dar desv\u00edo\nEn este caso presente,\nMuestra tu valor alto,\nY tu coraz\u00f3n tan tierno\nEst\u00e9 duro empedernido,\nDesnudado de piadad,\nQual si no fuera tu hijo;\nQue d\u00f3 la piedad no sabe\nAl piadoso, es enemigo.\nAta mis manos primero\nCon un nudo fuerte y fino,\nPara que no se desmanden\nQuando apretes el cuchillo:\nTen cuenta, padre piadoso,\nNo se tinten tus vestidos\nCon las gotas de mi sangre,\nPor que te ser\u00e1n tenidos.\nRezentar\u00e1 cada hora\n\nEste

sea manchado\nEste mi hecho subido.\n\u00a1O padre, no te acongoxes,\nPreta en el pu\u00f1o el cuchillo,\nPor que con mas brevedad\nHaga el oficio debido:\nNo tengas piadad de mi,\nY si acaso te lastimo,\nCubre mi cara y mis ojos\nCon la toca que he tra\u00eddo:\nY quando yo fuere muerto,\nSepulta mi cuerpo frio,\nY mira que me amortajes\nCon estos vestidos mismos,\nY esta aljuba que me pus\u00f3\nMi madre, quando partimos;\nSe la vuelve ante sus ojos\nQue le cause algun alivio,\nY le sirva de consuelo\nEn la ausencia de su hijo.\u201d\nViendo Br\u00e1him la constancia,\nY un ser tan sincero y limpio\nEn aquella edad tan tierna,\nY aquel animoso brio\nCon que su hijo se esfuerza\nAl presentado martirio;\nPor una parte miraba\nAqu\u00e9l agudo cuchillo,\n\n1 Renovar\u00e1.\nCon que h\u00e1 de cortar las venas\nDe aquel inocente ni\u00f1o,\nQue sus entra\u00f1as le razgan\nAquellos cortantes hilos;\nPor otra parte le anima\nEl concurso de su hijo\nCon que \u00e1 la muerte se apresta,\nSin dolerse de s\u00ed mismo.\nY ansi, sin mas dilatarlo\nSe apareja \u00e1 lo ofrecido,\nSent\u00f3 su fardaje en tierra,\nQuera una ropa de rizo\n\nY un vellon de piel de gamo,\nDentro del qual de contino\nLlevaba la provision,\nVisitando sus ex\u00eddos.\nY hizo sus reverencias\nDe zal\u00e1 para principio;\nAguard\u00f3 quel sol alumbre\nTodo el mundo, ya espacidos\nSus muy

de que no hab\u00edan podido\nEstorbar la obra perfecta\nCon sus falsos maleficios.\nQue har\u00eda el justo padre\nCuando \u00e1 su hijo tendido\nLo tuvo, y el pu\u00f1al ten\u00eda\nMas diligente

This district lies at the foot of the hills, and its frontier is conterminous with that of Nepal for about a hundred miles. Through the kindness of Colonel G. Ramsay, Resident at the Court of K\u00e1thm\u00e1ndu I obtained from Mah\u00e1-raja Sir Jung Bahadoor, the de facto ruler of that country, two Magar soldiers, men of intelligence, and who spoke their native dialect with great purity. At the same time I accidentally took into my service two Gorkh\u00e1lis (Anglic\u00e8\u2014Goor-khas) or Rajputs of the dominating or Khas race of Nepal. These men remained with me during several months of the cold season. We worked hard some hours each day, and I was getting on fairly with my task, when they suddenly, like all hill-men, got restless, and insisted on going back to their homes. The weather was getting warm (it was the first week in April), and I could not fairly detain them. Unfortunately I had only got as far as F in my dictionary. I had of course many words for the rest, but I had been going over it a second time, filling up gaps, and had made it pretty complete for the first six letters. However, I think enough has\n\n---\n\nI take this opportunity of recording my entire disbelief in the Hon. G. Campbell and Mr. Hyde Clarke's fantastic idea that the term Kh\u00e1s as applied to themselves by this Hindu race has anything whatever to do with Kasyapa, Kashmir, the Caucasus, or any primitive Aryan word at all. It is a pure Arabic word \u062e\u0627\u0635 which, ever since the days of the first Muhammedan land-settlement of India, has been the regular technical word for \"special, principal, select.\" How many hundreds of villages are there in India which have this word affixed to them, to distinguish them from places of similar name, but less importance? The Nepalese justly arrogate to themselves, by the use of this word, the first rank among the many tribes of the country. They are the \"royal race,\" par-excellence.\nbeen recorded to form a fair basis of operations for any philologist who may hereafter wish to go into the subject of the Himalayan languages; and as very little has been recorded about the Magar by Mr. B. Hodgson, I trust I am filling up a gap in a way that may be useful. I have also been enabled to correct several inaccuracies in Mr. Hodgson's short list of Magar words (Selections from Records of Govt. Bengal, No. xxvii.), some of which I shall point out further on.\n\nThe Magars are one of the tribes who inhabit the central part of Nepal, as distinguished from the tribes of the Terai on the one hand, and those of the higher altitudes, such as Murmis and Gurungs, on the other.\n\nThe whole mass of the Himalayas is adjacent to Hindustani on the south and Tibetan on the north; consequently we find traces of Hindustani influence more clear in the languages of the lower levels, while Tibetan influence predominates in the higher. Hindustani, moreover, has pitched a camp in the very heart of the country in the shape of the Goorkha sovereignty, so that even in the higher levels its sway is found to counterpoise and sometimes outweigh that of Tibetan. The latter, on the other hand, has beyond the limits of the Goorkha rule, as in Sikkim and Bhotan, a preponderating influence almost right down to the plains. But from the Singhaleela range eastwards (i.e. for two-thirds of the whole length of the mountains) this is lost, because where Nepal leaves off British territory begins and carries us on to Cashmere; and the inhabitants of Garhw\u00e1l, Kam\u00e1on, and the British hill possessions generally, are Hindus to a man in religion, and, to a great extent, in race.\n\nUpon the whole, then, Hindustani exercises a more powerful influence at the present day on the hill languages of Nepal than Tibetan does: but this state of things is of recent date. There was a time when all the hill tribes were Buddhists, and their languages dialects of Tibetan. Consequently the groundwork of most of them is Tibetan in character still, but so much has been borrowed from Hindi that the groundwork is often hidden out of sight, often distorted and corrupted. This is pre-eminently the case with Magar.\nThe Magars now live in the central part of Nepal; their most eastern village Tannang being 40 miles west of the capital Kathmandu. Their settlements, the chief of which are Rishing, Girging, Birkot, Dhor, and Lamzhang, stretch as far west as the town of Palpa. Beyond that there are Magars to be found, but their dialect is said to be corrupt and almost unintelligible to the eastern section of the tribe. My informants estimated their number at about 6,000 fighting men, which, adding a fair proportion of women and children, might give from 18 to 20,000 as the total of the population. This estimate, I suspect, is rather over than under the mark. There are so many tribes in Nepal besides the Khas, and the country is on the whole so thinly peopled, that none of the tribes can be very numerous. The hill women, though robust, are not as a rule remarkable for fecundity, and the increase of population is further checked by the strong tendency of the males for foreign service. These semi-Tibetan tribes are gradually decreasing, and it is the fact of their decrease alone that explains the existence of their numerous subdivisions into clans and septs, each of which sometimes contains only a few families. This often surprises travellers and others, but the fact is, the septs have dwindled to their present scanty numbers from much larger beginnings.\n\nThe Magars are divided into three great clans, called Thapa, Alaya, and Rana,\u00b9 and each of these again into many septs, which it is not necessary to particularize. They are, at present, rigid Hindus, and the Thapas call themselves Rajputs. Indeed, the two men who came to me gravely told me that their ancestor was a younger brother of the last Rajput king of Chitor, who, on the fall of that famous fortress, had taken refuge in Nepal! I did not ask him how his ancestor managed to reach Nepal through the territory of his deadly foe, but I noticed that neither my Goorkha Rajputs, nor a Bhojpur Rajput from Arrah (Kunwar Singh\u2019s clan), nor a hill Rajput from the Western Himalayas (a Doghra of Kulu), all of whom were in my service at the time, would eat with\n\n\u00b9 Both my interpreters were Thapas. I only know of the other two clans from Mr. Hodgson\u2019s note, above quoted.\nthe Magars, or acknowledge them to be of pure caste. In fact, the appearance of the men themselves put their Mongolian origin beyond a doubt. Small, robust men, about five feet in height, with great girth of chest, small pig-eyes, high cheek-bones, scanty moustache and beard, huge mis-shapen mouth, always distended with a good-humoured but rather meaningless grin,\u2014they carried their origin written in every limb and feature. There is no doubt whatever that they originally lived much farther to the east than they now do. Their habitat was probably Sikkim or Western Bhotan, and they were heathens, as many of the tribes still are. They may have had a slight leaven of Buddhism, but it was in all probability very slight, and readily yielded to Brahmanical influence when the Goorkha pressure was brought to bear on them. They call themselves Rajputs because they belong to that class of the tribes from which the Nepalese army is now recruited, and in which they take high rank along with the Gurungs, next to the pure Goorkhas. The bulk of the male population is at present in Jung Bahadoor's army, though their original occupations were pastoral and slightly (but only slightly) agricultural. Like the other tribes, they by no means exclusively occupy the tract of country in which their villages lie; in travelling in those regions, one meets a Magar village, and, a little further on, one of Dorhis or Dunwars, and, again, a Newar village, and so on. It is not wonderful, under these circumstances, that their language should be dying out, especially when it is taken into consideration that the majority of the men are permanently absent from their homes on military service, the exigencies of which render it imperative on them to speak the Parbatia or Kh\u00e1s Nepalese (a purely Hindi dialect) as well as their native tongue. I am afraid they are rather ashamed of their language; in the capital they are, of course, anxious to avoid exhibiting traces of rusticity, and only use Magar among themselves. The haughty Goorkha calls all the hill languages, except his own, by the opprobrious epithet of \u092c\u0947\u0939\u0930\u093e or \"dirty.\" Here and there, in the following pages, I have noted the chief words of Tibetan origin to be found in Magar; but it may be useful to make some general pre-\nliminary remarks, to shew to some extent the results of Hindi influence, and the deviations from the pure Tibetan. The results of an examination of the language are curious and, to some extent, novel; but I do not wish to be understood as affirming anything on this head positively. I merely suggest for the consideration of scholars, and shall be glad if my suggestions be considered as pointing in the right direction.\n\nWords in Magar may be divided into five classes:\n\n1. Pure Hindi.\n2. Corrupted Hindi.\n3. Arabic and Persian.\n4. Pure Tibetan.\n5. Corrupted Tibetan.\n\nOf classes 1 and 3 there is no need to say anything; the Arabic and Persian words are merely such as are in use in Urdu, and have been adopted in Hindi for want of a good indigenous equivalent.\n\nWith regard to class 2, it may be remarked that the corruptions are the same as those which occur in Parbatia or court Nepalese, which is a dialect of Hindi almost identical with Bhojpuri; seeing that the founder of the present dynasty emigrated with his clan from Simr\u0101un in Tirhut in 1322 A.D. Examples will be found in the vocabulary.\n\nClasses 4 and 5, or those of pure and corrupted Tibetan words, require further investigation. It is well known that written Tibetan differs from the modern spoken language by having a number of letters which are not pronounced, very much as in French; there is, however, this difference, that it is in many cases difficult to see how some of the combinations in Tibetan could ever have been pronounced at all. Letters of different organs are found without the intervention of a vowel at the beginning of words and in situations where the European tongue is almost unable to utter them. That this is no reason why Tibetan tongues should not be able to pronounce them, I am well aware. We find such combinations in the Hamitic family as gb, for instance, where the b is clearly enunciated, with a scarcely detected soup\u00e7on of a g preceding it; and it is in this way that the learned Lamas in some parts of Tibet still read their sacred books. In those Tibetan monasteries which I have visited, I did not find this the case, and the mass\nof the people entirely ignore these combinations. Mr. Jaeschke has given to the world some valuable notes on the subject of the pronunciation of modern Tibetan in various provinces, which lead to the hypothesis that the deviations from the classical Tibetan standard observable in the Himalayan dialects may be traced to various provinces of Tibet, and may thus aid us to find out the original homes of the tribes now domiciled in Nepal. To apply this idea to the case of the Magars is not altogether easy. There are many words which agree exactly with Tibetan, e.g.\n\n| MAGAR | ENGLISH | TIBETAN |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| 1. Lam | A road | Lam. |\n| 2. Lag | Hand (side) | Lag. |\n| 3. Su | Who? | Su. |\n| 4. Ra (rha) | Goat | Ra. |\n| 5. Shig | Louse | Shig. |\n| 6. Shi | Die | Shi. |\n| 7. Shing | Tree | Shing. |\n| 8. Birin | Send | (S)bring. |\n| 9. Nis | Two | (G)nyis. |\n| 10. Ros | Bone | Rus. |\n| 11. (Bhur) mi | Man | Mi. |\n| 12. Mhen | Fire | Me. |\n| 13. Mik | Eye | Mig. |\n| 14. Ro | Love | Ro. |\n\nThere is nothing in the form which these words take in Magar to shew whether they belong to the eastern or western part of Tibet.\n\nAnother class of words exhibits a certain likeness to Tibetan, but with changes for which, as there is no analogy, so it may be doubted if there is any proof. I give the following list therefore merely conjecturally:\n\n| MAGAR | ENGLISH | TIBETAN |\n|-------|---------|---------|\n| 1. Ch\u00fc | Dog | Khyi, pronounced chhi. |\n| 2. Dng\u00e1 | See | (M)thong. |\n| 3. Gar\u00e1 | Ant | Gro'. |\n\n1 The prefix mi found with all words referring to parts of the human body is the Tibetan word for 'man.' Hodgson is in error in treating it as a radical.\nMagar. English. Tibetan.\n\n4. Biri ...... Fear .......... Bre'.\n5. Kharak ... Be ashamed ... Khre'.\n6. Tuk ....... Belly .......... (L)to (cf. (l)tog, hunger).\n7. Mya ...... Arrow .......... Md\u00e2.\n8. Chya ...... Tie ........... Ching.\n9. Cho ....... Cut ........... Cho'.\n10. Im ....... House .......... Khyim, pron. chhim.\n11. Gwha ..... Bird .......... Wya, pron. wa.\n12. Armin ..... Name .......... Ming.\n13. Arkin ..... Nail .......... Sen.\n14. Tsup ..... Suck .......... Jib.\n15. Tang ..... Spread .......... Thing and (l)ding.\n16. Gin ....... Heart .......... Nying.\n17. Chini ..... To-day .......... Mag.ch\u00fc, with t.nyi, day.\n18. Mhut ..... Blow .......... Bud.\n\nBoth these lists may be largely augmented, especially the second, which I have adopted in the vocabulary, where more examples may be found.\n\nWhen we seek to account for the deviation of Magar forms from those of classical Tibetan, by a reference to the pronunciation of Eastern Tibet, from which part there is good reason to assume that the Magars (like the Limbus) originally came, we are met by the difficulty that this tribe must have left Tibet certainly before 1300 A.D., as after the arrival of the Goorkhas in Nepal, the incessant wars which were waged in the hills would have been very unfavourable to, if not entirely prohibitive of, the penetration of a feeble clan so far into the heart of the country. But, from the researches of Jaeschke and others, it is almost certain that the ancient pronunciation remained in force all through Tibet up to a late date. From my own travels in Sikkim, I know that the chief\u2014and, I believe, only\u2014route northwards from that country debouches close to Lhasa itself, a place which, from its political importance, would have retained (presumably) a pure pronunciation longer than any other place in those eastern provinces. The Magars then, in all probability, had left their original homes before the pronunciation of \u00dc-Tsang (the province of which Lhasa\nis the capital) and Kham had declined in any marked degree from the classical standard, and it would therefore be vain to look for many signs of eastern influence in the Tibetan words which they have retained. Some few, however, I think, may be detected, and these I now notice.\n\n1. \"I\" in Magar is not only ngu (Tibetan nga), but ngoi, which is the Eastern pronunciation of the (Western) Tibetan ngos. A similar process is, perhaps, traceable in the root lo or loi, 'to bring,' from the Tibetan nyos, where we see also a transition from n to l. This transition is also shown in the roots lo or lho, 'to throw,' Tibetan, tho'; lhang, 'a stone,' Tibetan, do'; lhak, 'to lick,' Tibetan, dag; where the dental element of the Tibetan passes into l in Magar.\n\n2. Final g, d, b, are in East Tibet so indistinctly pronounced as to be scarcely audible. So in Magar we have la, 'side, direction,' in kula, 'where,' in which the final g is audible only before a vowel, from Tibetan lag; other instances are biri from bred, 'fear,' gar\u00e1 from grog, 'ant,' cho from chod, 'cut,' etc. On the other hand, however, there are instances of the retention of the final letter, where it exists in Tibetan; and Hodgson, whose vocabulary appears to have been derived from a Magar from the country west of Palpa, where the dialect is in all probability older than the present standard Magar, retains these letters in some cases where my authorities omitted them.\n\n3. As both final s is softened into i, and final g is unheard, in Eastern Tibet, we may derive the Magar word le, 'to exist,' 'to be,' from the Tibetan lags, which by the processes above noted would become la'i, and finally le.\u00b9\n\nIn the vocabulary will be found a considerable number of Tibetan etymologies; but it would seem that there is a large quantity of words which can be referred neither to Tibetan nor Hindi. It would be an interesting enquiry whether these words\u2014this, so to speak, insoluble residuum\u2014have any affinities with the languages of the neigbouring Himalayan tribes,\n\n\u00b9 According to Jaeschke (Tib. Gr. p. 28, \u00a7 39), this word is only used in \"respectful and elegant speech,\" except in Eastern Tibet (and especially the province of \u00dc, where Lhasa is situated), where it sounds l\u0101-pa.\nand if so, to what source they are to be attributed. There are not wanting indications, though they are rather slight, of a connection with the Lohitic or Burmese class, as e.g., the word *kat*, \u2018one,\u2019 which is identical with the Lepcha, and very similar to the Burmese, also the pronoun of the second person, *nang*, which is the same in the Boro or Mechi language. It is not my intention to follow out this comparison in the present paper, because I have been led by circumstances to doubt the accuracy of the printed vocabularies of Himalayan tribes, and hope to have an opportunity of making collections myself direct from the mouths of natives; till then I make no comments.\n\nIt may, however, be worth while to notice the construction and inflections of the Magar in reference both to Tibetan and Hindi.\n\nWe should expect to find the grammar almost pure Tibetan, because the language is undoubtedly of Himalayan origin; and this expectation is fairly carried out, though of course the sharpness of type which is observable in Hundesi and trans-Himalayan languages cannot be looked for here.\\(^1\\)\n\nThus we have the noun ordinarily monosyllabic, and occasionally bearing the Tibetan affixes of gender, *ba* (or *wa*) and *po*, masculine; and *ma*, *mo*, feminine. The declension is effected by added particles, as in Tibetan, though most of the particles used bear not the slightest resemblance to the corresponding Tibetan ones; they agree, however, here and there, with those used in other Himalayan languages, and some are borrowed from Nepalese and Parbatia, e.g.\u2014\n\n|   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2. | *o* Milch\u00e1n | *o*. |\n| 3. | *ke* Nepalese | *(kod \u0928\u0947\u092a\u093e\u0932)*. |\n| 4. | *ang* Milch\u00e1n | *ang*. |\n| 7. | *laki* Tibetan | *lag*. |\n| 10. | perhaps Tibetan | *hi\u2019* or *i\u2019*\u2014etc. |\n\n\\(^1\\) The Magars are well aware of the fact that their language deviates much from the \u201cBhot,\u201d (as Tibetan is called in the hills), and even go so far as to use this fact as an argument in favour of their alleged Rajput descent. They tell me that their immediate neighbours, the Gurungs, speak a language far more like \u201cBhot\u201d than they do.\n\n\\(^2\\) These numbers refer to those in sec. 2, \u00a7 1.\n\n\\(^3\\) But still *ke* in Tirhut and Purneah Hindi.\nS\u0101thang is clearly the Hindi or Nepalese \u0938\u093e\u0925 with the Magar affix ang, and is thus equivalent to, \"in company with.\"\n\nThe pronoun is highly irregular, as is the case in most languages, and offers a minimum of coincidences with any other language. That of the third person seems to be an Aryan word tortured into compliance with Turanian rules.\n\nIn the verb again, we see monosyllabic roots with affixes, as in Tibetan. The infinitive is curious, inasmuch as it follows the Tibetan system with Nepalese materials; the verb, or verbal root in the former language, is treated as a noun, and takes accordingly the nominal affix of gender pa and ba; to form the infinitive the particle r is added, which is also a sign of the dative in nouns. Similarly, in Magar, we have the verbal root in the dative case used as an infinitive, but the sign for the dative is the Aryan one \u0914; as in zatke, 'to do,' etc.\n\nThe various affixes used to express modifications of time are not traceable, as far as I can see at present, to any corresponding form in Tibetan, except the le of the present, which is the la'i, as mentioned above.\n\nPerhaps also the termination n\u00fc of the past part., may be referred to the nai of the Tibetan past part., which is the same as the sign of the ablative case of the noun.\n\nBut the ending of the past tense in a and that of the imperative in o, look like Hindi forms, and the idea of a respectful imperative, with its characteristic i, is also traceable to the same source; whence also they derive the idea of using the instrumental in lieu of the nominative with a past tense; for the instrumental, though existing in Tibetan, is not so used.\n\nTibetan, however, in idea, is the habit of prefixing mi ('man') to words denoting parts of the human body, as mitalu, etc. We find also a list of words beginning with ar, a prefix which has apparently no relations in Tibetan. These words, if we leave out the ar, agree generally with the corresponding Tibetan words.\n\nHindi again is the form of construction with the past participle in connection with an auxiliary verb, meaning 'to give,'\n'to place,' etc. *E.g.* chikke alone is 'to expel,' but the Magars are fond of using chikk\u00fc zake, which is similar to the Hindi habit of using nik\u00e1l den\u00e1 for nik\u00e1ln\u00e1, and is equally useless and inconvenient in both languages. In the grammar, I have noticed a good many of these instances of borrowing methods of expression from Hindi.\n\nTo sum up these brief introductory remarks, it results from what has been said that the Magar is a language of the Tibetan family, and that the race who speak it probably came originally from the neighbourhood of Lhasa, in Eastern Tibet. Falling under Goorkha influence as they advanced westwards, they added to their vocabulary a large number of Hindi words, and some inflections, so that we have Tibetan grammatical ideas carried out with both Tibetan and Aryan materials, as well as Hindi grammatical ideas carried out with Aryan and Tibetan materials. The language thus presents a spectacle almost unique, and in distinct contradiction to the generally admitted proposition\u2014that, though one language often borrows largely from another, yet these borrowings are confined to words, and never extend to grammatical forms.\n\nII.\u2014Section 1. Sounds.\n\nThe sounds of the Magar are as follows:\u2014\n\nI. Vowels.\n\n| Sanskrit | Pronunciation |\n|----------|--------------|\n| \u0905 a\u2081     | \u0101             |\n| \u0907 i      | \u012b             |\n| \u0908 \u0113      | \u0113             |\n| \u0909 u      | \u016b             |\n| \u090a \u016b      | \u016b             |\n| \u090b e      | \u0113             |\n| \u0913 o      | \u014d             |\n\nThere are, besides, three vowel sounds of a Mongolian nature which cannot be expressed by Sanskrit letters: these are, ai, oi, \u00fc. The first of these is longer than the Sanskrit \u016b, and is almost two syllables. The second, oi, is like the German \u00f6 in G\u00f6tthe, but broader, and half-way between that and the German eu in feuer. The third, \u00fc, is a very acute short sound, and at the end of words, where it chiefly occurs, is hardly to be distinguished from i or e, thus resembling the German \u00fc in m\u00fcde. These three sounds do not exist in Tibetan, as far as I\n\n\u00b9 I give the Sanskrit characters as a key to the pronunciation, as far as they go.\nam aware, but they are found in Lepcha, Murmi, and other hill languages.\n\nII. Consonants.\n\n|   |   |   |   |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| k | kh | g | gh |\n| ch | chh | j | jh |\n| t | th | d | dh |\n| t | th | d | dh |\n| ts (c) | tz | ds |\n| p | ph | b | bh |\n| h | h (d) | s | sh |\n| r | l | y | z (e) |\n\nRemarks.\u2014(a). This letter is the same as the Tibetan \u0144 ng. It is with difficulty pronounced by a foreigner when it occurs, as is frequently the case, at the beginning of a word. It is precisely the same sound as the ng in the end of the present participle of verbs in English, as going, singing.\n\n(b). This is the Tibetan \u0148 ny, \u201cprononc\u00e9 comme dans le mot fran\u00e7ais ignare,\u201d\u00b9 or as the Spanish \u00f1 in Se\u00f1or.\n\n(c). These three sounds are of Tibetan origin, and correspond to ts, tz, and ds.\n\n(d). The Tibetan \u0105, a softer sound than \u0148, so soft as only to be audible when pronounced slowly. Yoho, \u2018give,\u2019 in ordinary conversation sounds almost like yo or yo-o.\n\n(e). The Tibetan \u0105, English z.\n\n(f). Tibetan \u0148, exactly like the English wh in which, why, as it is pronounced by Irishmen, as though spelt hwich: it is difficult to decide whether this sound is wh or hw.\n\nThe soft or Tibetan h is often found in combination with m or l, as mhen, \u2018fire,\u2019 bhang, \u2018a stone;\u2019 where it is again difficult to say whether the l or the h precedes.\n\nWhen a Magar gets excited, and talks loud or with vehemence, he aspirates nearly every letter in the alphabet. Thus \u2018I see,\u2019 is d\u00e1ngone, but \u2018I see! I see!\u2019 sounds more like dh\u00e1nghonhe.\n\nThe medial aspirates gh, dh, bh, jh, only occur in words of Hindi origin. There are no medial aspirates in Tibetan.\n\nThe cerebral letters do not often occur except in Hindi\n\n\u00b9 Foucaux, Grammaire Tib\u00e9taine, p. 3.\nwords used in Magar. In indigenous words the hard \u1e0d (\u1e0d) is pronounced almost like an r. Indeed, even the dentals in Magar are like the same class in English, consequently harsher than those in Hindi.\n\nThe letters k and g are pronounced so much alike as at times hardly to be distinguishable one from the other. So also p and b. This is a Tibetan characteristic.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe distinction between long and short vowels is only clearly marked in words of Hindi origin. In pure Magar words there is very little distinction. The language in this respect also follows the usage of Tibetan.\n\nThere are no peculiarities of accent beyond a slight drawl at the end of a sentence. The pronunciation is level and even, though somewhat indistinct, the words short and simple, and the general effect of the language on the ear is soft and musical.\n\n**Section 2. The Noun.**\n\n\u00a7 1. The noun has no inflections. Cases are formed by the addition to the word of syllables, in the same manner as the Hindi k\u00e1, ke, ki, etc. The following is a list of the most usual post-positions, showing how they are added to a noun:\n\n1. *Im* a house.\n2. *Im-o* of a house.\n3. *Im-ke* to a house.\n4. *Im-ang* in a house, also on a house.\n5. *Im-ing* from a house, or out of a house.\n6. *Im-taking,* upon a house.\n7. *Im-l\u00e1ki* from a house.\n8. *Im-kh\u00e1ta* with or near a house.\n9. *Im-s\u00e1thung* with a house,\n10. *Im-i* by a house.\n11. *Im-mho\u00efking* under a house.\n\n**Remarks.**\u20141. The objective case is designated either by the affix ke, or by the absence of any affix at all. In other words, the verb in some cases governs a dative, in which case\n\n\\(^1\\) Foucaux, Gram. Tibet. p. 3, l. 12, and p. 8, para. c.\nas is added to the noun, in some cases an accusative, in which case the noun has no affix. Instances are\u2014\n\nNg\u00e1ke dhus\u00e1 he pushed me (lit. to me).\nIse shing chio cut that wood.\n\n2. Where two nouns follow each other, the genitive sign of the first is omitted, if a close connection exists between them. This is equivalent to forming a compound noun.\u00b9\n\nEx.: T\u00e1l\u00fa chh\u00e1m.\nThe hair of the head: (lit.: the head-hair).\n\n3. The affix l\u00faki is pronounced also l\u00e1ge and l\u00e1g.\n\n4. The affix i is the sign of the instrumental, and is used before the past tense of a transitive verb, as in Hindi ne.\n\nEx.: Su-i y\u00e1h\u00e1? Kis-ne diy\u00e1.\nAlso as a pure instrumental\u2014\n\nEx.: Hur-i khoho with a hoe dig.\n\nIn addition to the affixes given above, there are others signifying behind, before, above, etc., but as no change takes place in the noun when these are added, I have not given them here, but in their proper place in the dictionary.\n\nAs a rule, no distinction is made between the singular and plural, but if it is necessary to draw particular attention to the fact of plurality, the word patt\u00e1 or patto, meaning \u2018all,\u2019 is inserted between the noun itself and the terminations.\n\nEx.: bhurmi-patto ke yoho.\ngive to the men (lit. man-all).\nIm-patt\u00e1 ke hilo.\nCount all the houses.\n\n\u00a7 2. There is no gender in Magar nouns. Animals and human beings are distinguished by separate names for the sexes.\n\nEx.: bhurmi, \u2018a man,\u2019 m\u00e1has\u00e1, \u2018a woman,\u2019 thor, \u2018a bull,\u2019 nyet, \u2018a cow,\u2019 or by the affix \u2018m\u00e1n,\u2019 which converts a masculine noun into a feminine.\n\nEx.: Dog, ch\u00fc. Bitch, ch\u00fcm\u00e1n.\nHe-goat, rh\u00e1. She-goat, rh\u00e1m\u00e1n.\nCock, gwh\u00e1. Hen, gwh\u00e1m\u00e1n.\u00b2\n\n\u00b9 Like the Sankrit Tatpurushah.\n\u00b2 This affix m\u00e1n is probably connected with the Tibetan mo affixed to female nouns.\nIn the case of human beings the words lenza, 'male,' and m\u00e1haz\u00e1, 'female,' are sometimes used, as lenz\u00e1 z\u00e1, 'a male child,' m\u00e1haz\u00e1 z\u00e1, 'a female child.'\n\n\u00a7 3. Adjectives are indeclinable, and precede the substantive.\n\nEx.: Karangch\u00fc bhurmi, 'a big man.'\n\nComparison is effected by the affix denang, 'than.' There are no separate signs for the comparative and superlative degrees.\n\nEx.: Nga denang ise karangch\u00fc le.\nHe is bigger than I (lit. big than I).\n\nK\u00e1nang bai kaupatto denang b\u00e1to.\nOur father is the wisest of us all (lit. wise than us all).\n\nIn Magar, as in all other languages, when an adjective is used elliptically as an appellative, it takes the case-affixes just the same as a substantive. Thus loch\u00fc as an adjective means 'long,' but as a substantive it means 'the long (one),' i.e. 'a snake,' and then takes case-affixes.\n\nEx.: Loch\u00fc ke ngoi detak\u00e1, 'I killed a snake.'\n\nNearly all adjectives end in ch\u00fc. This is also the form taken by the verbal noun, and adjectives may be formed from any verb in the language by adding this particle ch\u00fc to the root; and similarly all adjectives may be made into verbs by dropping the termination ch\u00fc and affixing the usual verbal terminations; thus from boch\u00fc, 'white,' we may make bo-le, bomone, etc., meaning 'it is white, it was white,' and so forth.\n\nIn fact, in most Turanian languages, the monosyllable merely conveys an idea as 'seeing,' 'doing,' and it depends entirely upon the terminations that are added to it, whether it is to be regarded as a noun or verb.\n\n\u00a7 4. Nouns which end with a vowel exhibit slight irregularities when they take the affixes o, i, ang, ing.\n\n(a). In some instances the final i of the word changes, as in Sanskrit, into a semi-vowel; as bhurmi, 'a man;' bhurmyo, 'of a man.'\n\n(b). Or the initial vowel of the affix is lost altogether, as thaili, 'a bag;' thaili-ng, 'in a bag,' for thaili-ang.\n\n(c). Or an euphonic letter is inserted, as sipahi-k-o, of a sepoy.' This is probably borrowed from the Nepalese sign of the genitive \u0928\u093f.\n(d). Or the affix is simply added to the word, this is more especially the case in monosyllables, as *suo*, 'of whom?' *sui*, 'by whom?'\n\nThere appears to be no certain rule for these changes. My two interpreters sometimes used one form, sometimes the other; and no amount of enquiry could elicit from them any definite rule.\n\n**Section 3. The Pronoun.**\n\nThe personal pronouns exhibit more of an inflectional character than any other part of the language. The genitive cases especially merit attention.\n\n**First Person.**\n\n| Singular | Nom. I, ng\u00e1, ngach\u00fc, ngoi, ngoich\u00fc. |\n|----------|-----------------------------------|\n|          | Gen. Of me, nuo.                   |\n|          | Dat. To me, Acc. Me, ng\u00e1ke.        |\n\nAll other cases are formed precisely as in nouns by adding case affixes to the form ng\u00e1, as ng\u00e1-l\u00e1ki 'from me,' ng\u00e1-s\u00e1thang, 'with me.'\n\n| Plural   | Nom. We, kan, kanko\u00ef, kankoi.     |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n|          | Gen. Of us, k\u00e1nang, k\u00e1nun.       |\n|          | Dat. To us, Acc. Us, kanke, kankoke. |\n\n**Second Person.**\n\n| Singular | Nom. Thou, noi, nengi, nang. |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n|          | Gen. Of thee, nuo nango.     |\n|          | Dat. To thee, nengke.        |\n|          | Acc. You,                     |\n\n| Plural   | Nom. Ye, n\u00e1hako.             |\n|----------|------------------------------|\n|          | Gen. Of you, n\u00e1hakun.        |\n|          | Dat. To you, n\u00e1hako ke.      |\n|          | Acc. You,                     |\n\n*N\u00e1hun*, the respectful pronoun of the second person, corresponds to the Hindustani \"Ap\" or \"Huz\u00far,\" and must be distinguished from *n\u00e1hakun*, the genitive plural of *nang*. It is generally used in the nominative case only, and has no plural.\n\nThe third person has three forms, *hose*, *\u00e1se*, *ise*. Of these *hose* is the ordinary 'he,' 'she,' 'it;' *\u00e1se* is used for distant\npersons or things; *ise* for things close at hand, i.e., *ise* is 'this,' *\u00e1se* is 'that.' The declension is as follows:\n\n| SINGULAR | PLURAL |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nom. *hose* *ise* *\u00e1se* | Nom. *hosko* *isko* *\u00e1sko* |\n| Gen. *hoch\u00fc* *ich\u00fc* *\u00e1ch\u00fc* | Gen. *hoskun* *iskun* *\u00e1skun* |\n| Dat. *hoske* *iske* *\u00e1ske* | Dat. *hoskoke* *iskoke* *askoke* |\n| Acc. etc. etc. etc. | Acc. etc. etc. etc. |\n\nThe forms *ngoi*, *nangi*, and *hos* are used as instrumentals before the past tense of a verb, but I have given them as nominatives also, because they are all used before other tenses as well. In fact *ng\u00e1*, and *ngoi* seem to be used indifferently in all cases, both before transitive and intransitive verbs.\n\nThe demonstrative, interrogative, and relative pronouns will be found in the dictionary. They have no inflection, but take case-affixes in a perfectly regular manner. Those which end in *o* have no distinction between the nominative and genitive cases.\n\nThe word *s\u00fa*, 'who,' is Tibetan, and forms in the plural *s\u00fa-s\u00fa*, which is also a Tibetan formation, though in that language it means 'whoever,' 'some.' The declension is as follows:\n\n| SINGULAR | PLURAL |\n|----------|--------|\n| N. *s\u00fa* who? | *su-ko*, *su-patta* *s\u00fa-s\u00fa* |\n| G. *s\u00fa-o* of whom | *su-kun* |\n| D. *su-ke* to whom | |\n| Acc. *su-e* whom | |\n| Inst. *su-i* by whom | *su-su-i* |\n\n*Kos* or *kus*, 'who?' is thus declined\u2014G. *kuso*; D. *kuske* or *kuche*, etc.\n\nIn the word *sura* or *suro*, 'any-one,' an inversion sometimes occurs in the accusative singular, *suke-ra* for *sura-ke*.\n\nGreat regularity in the type, so to speak, of the pronouns exists in Magar; this betrays the influence of Hindi. I give here a table showing these words. It will be observed that interrogatives commence with *k* or *ku*; demonstratives with *i* for close, and *a* for remote, objects; relatives with *j*. All this is clearly Hindi. Nothing of the kind occurs in Tibetan or its cognate languages, though the use of *i* for proximate, and\na for remote demonstratives is a characteristic of all languages of the Turanian family, and is even observed in Sanskrit and some other Indo-Germanic languages.\\(^1\\)\n\nSome of the words in the following list are properly adverbs, but I insert them here in order to show the mechanism of the language in this respect at one glance.\n\nIt will be observed, 1. That some of the expressions are Hindi, either pure or only slightly corrupted; 2. That words of purely Tibetan origin exist side by side with Hindi or semi-Hindi forms.\n\n| Pronoun | Adverb of Place | Adverb of Quality | Adverb of Direction | Pronoun and Adverb of Quantity | Adverb of Time |\n|---------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|---------------|\n| Hose He | Hola There      | Hosto Thus        | Hote Thence         | Horangch\u00fc So great            | Hose bera Then |\n| Ise This | Ila[g] Here (yahdn) | Isto Thus (aisd) | It\u0119 Hence           | Irangch\u00fc So great (Itind)     | Ise bera Now |\n| Ase That | Ala[g] There (wah\u00e4n) | Asto Thus (waied) | Ate Thence          | Arangch\u00fc So great (Utind)     | Ase bera Then |\n| Kos Who?

The Numerals.\n\nThe Magar language possesses numerals only up to five; from five onwards counting is carried on in Hindi.\n\nThe numerals are\u2014\n\n1. kat\n2. nis\n3. som\n4. buli\n5. banga\n6. chha\n7. eat\n\netc.\n\nMagar.\n\nHindi.\n\n\\(^1\\) See on this subject Caldwell's Dravidian Grammar, p. 338 et seqq.\nThe first five numerals are of Tibetan or Himalayan origin, and are connected with the numerals in Tibetan,\\(^1\\) and all the hill languages as far as Assam and the Burmese frontier.\n\nIn the phrase *kah-ek*, \u2018one day,\u2019 the final *t* of *kat* has been changed into *h*. In the form *kangles*, \u2018one year,\u2019 the *t* is further modified into *ng*. The ordinals are the same as Hindi, even for those numbers whose cardinals are Magar pure; but it must be remarked that ordinals are seldom, if ever, used.\n\n**Section 5. The Verb.**\n\n\u00a7 1. The verb is as destitute of inflections as the noun, but possesses a sufficiency of machinery for expressing times, moods, and all other phases of action. This machinery consists, as in the noun, of appended syllables. The roots of all verbs are monosyllables. Where exceptions occur to this rule, they are only so in appearance, and spring from corruptions or contractions, (sometimes very difficult to explain,) of two or more monosyllabic roots.\n\nI have endeavoured to arrange the various forms of the verb below; but it must be premised that the Magars themselves are very inaccurate and loose in their employment of these forms. The remarks below will elucidate this point more fully.\n\n\u00a7 2. The verb falls into conjugations, according as the root terminates with a consonant or a vowel.\n\n| 1st Conjugation | 2nd Conjugation |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| **R\u00e1kh-ke.**    | **Y\u00e1-ke.**      |\n| \u2018To bring.\u2019     | \u2018To give.\u2019      |\n| Infinitive      | Y\u00e1-ke \u2018to give\u2019 |\n| Present         | Y\u00e1-le           |\n| Do.             | Y\u00e1-lang         |\n| Aorist          | Y\u00e1-mo-ne        |\n| Preterite       | Y\u00e1-h-\u00e1          |\n| Future          | \u00c1-[y\u00e1]-h-e\\(^2\\) (\u00e1-he.) |\n| Imperative      | Yo-h-o          |\n| Do.             | Wanting.        |\n| Do.(respectful)| Y\u00e1-ni           |\n| Past participle | Y\u00e1-m\u00fc or mo.    |\n| Verbal noun     | Y\u00e1-ch\u00fc          |\n\n\\(^1\\) See these words in the Vocabulary.\n\n\\(^2\\) This form is not used with words beginning with the vowel *\u00e1*.\n\u00a7 3. Remarks.\u20141. The forms of the present in *le* and *lang* are used to denote future action which is to take place immediately, exactly like our English phrase \u2018I am going,\u2019 which, though present in form, is future in sense.\n\nEx.: *Nangke s\u00e1tnang* (for -*lang*).\n\u2018I will beat you\u2019 (*i.e.* immediately).\n\n2. *Lang* is often pronounced *nang*, as in *s\u00e1tnang* above.\n\n3. *Le* in *r\u00e1kh-le* is the root of the verb *le-ke*, \u2018to be;\u2019 *lang* is probably a contraction of *le-ang* = being-in.\\(^1\\) Thus *r\u00e1kh-le* would mean \u2018bringing-am,\u2019 and *r\u00e1kh-lang*, \u2018bringing-am-in,\u2019 or \u2018I am in (the act of) bringing,\u2019 which accounts for its being used as an immediate future, as well as a present, tense.\n\n4. The affix *le* is sometimes omitted, especially in short, abrupt sentences. Ex.: *ja\u00ef ki ma ja\u00ef*, \u2018will you eat, or not?\u2019 which is for *jy\u00e1-le* (*ja\u00ef-le*) from *jy\u00e1ke*, \u2018to eat\u2019 (pronounced *ja\u00efke*).\n\n5. I have called the form in -*one* the aorist because its time is indefinite. It is used with reference to past, present, or future occurrences. It appears to have sprung from the indefinite past participle in *n\u00fc* or *mo* with *le* added and changed into *ne*, a change of which other instances are found. It would thus be equivalent to \u2018I have done,\u2019 as in *y\u00e1mone*, which would be *y\u00e1mo* = having given, *le* = I am, \u2018I am having given,\u2019 or \u2018I have given.\u2019 In the first conjugation *r\u00e1khone* would be for *r\u00e1kh[n]\u00fc-ne*, the *n* being slurred over or elided, and the short *\u00fc* changed into an obscure *o*. The following sentences will explain the nature and use of this form:\n\n**Past.** *Chini hose hira m\u00e1 ja\u00ef mone.*\nTo-day he has eaten nothing.\n\n**Future.** *Nungch\u00fc dangone.*\nI will go and see (*lit.* going *I will see*).\n\n**Present.** *N\u00e1kun kul\u00e1g ngumone.*\nWhere do you live?\n\n\\(^1\\) The affix *ang* is sometimes added without the *l* to express present time, as *pasang*, \u2018it happens,\u2019 for *pas-lang*.\n6. The form of the imperative in *ni* is used when addressing a superior, and is similar to the Hindi *-iye* in *baithiye*, *aiye*, 'be pleased to sit,' etc.\n\n7. All verbs of the second conjugation, whose roots end in *\u00e1* change the vowel of the root into *o* in the imperative, and insert a soft *h* between that and the vowel of the affix, as *ya-ke yo-ho*, *ga-ke go-ho*. This *h* can only be heard when a person speaks very distinctly, otherwise the imperative sounds like one syllable, *yo*, *go*.\n\n8. The past participle is similar in use to the Hindi participle in *kar* or *karke*.\n\n**Ex.:** *Ja\u00efmo nungn\u00e1*, 'having eaten, go.'\n\n**Hindi:** *Kh\u00e1 karke j\u00e1o.*\n\nIt is much used in forming compound verbs, the latter element of which is formed by *y\u00e1ke*, 'to give,' *tohke* or *toke*, 'to place,' and other verbs.\n\n**Ex.:** *Dasn\u00fc y\u00e1ke*, 'to abandon.'\n\nWord for word Hindi *chhor den\u00e1*.\n\n*Tag dimo ngapke*, 'to take aim.'\n\nWord for word Hindi *nish\u00e1na karke m\u00e1rn\u00e1*.\n\nThe words most frequently used to form compounds are\u2014\n\n*y\u00e1ke* to give.  \n*rahke* to come.  \n*tohke* to place.  \n*nungke* to go.  \n*nguke* to sit, remain.  \n*r\u00e1khke* to bring.  \n*kahke* to put.  \n*\u00e1lhke* to take away, etc.\n\nThese all take the preceding verb in the past participle.\n\n**Ex.:** *Bherdimo toho.*\n\nFold up (lit. having folded put).\n\n9. The form in *ch\u00fc* like that in *one* is used in a very vague manner. I apprehend that it is originally and properly the present participle and corresponds to the Hindi *walla*. In Tibetan *hgy\u00fcr* (pronounced *chh\u00fcr*) means 'to become,' and it is possible that this verb, which is used as an auxiliary in that language, may be the origin of the affix *ch\u00fc*. It is notable that this syllable is found at the end of a large majority of adjectives, and that such especially as take their primary\nidea from actions are derived from verbs by adding *ch\u00fc* to the root. Thus from\n\n*Hekle* to be able comes *hekch\u00fc* able.\n*Jaike* to eat ,, *jaich\u00fc* eatable.\n*G\u00e1ke* to drink ,, *g\u00e1ch\u00fc* drinkable.\n\netc. etc.\n\nI have therefore called this form a verbal noun. It is used with reference to past, present, and future time, and in every variety of mood. A few examples will explain its use more readily than a long dissertation.\n\n1. *Hose dhut ts\u00e1nch\u00fc, kurek din tsan\u00e1.*\n\nHow long ago was it?\n\nHere *ts\u00e1nch\u00fc* is the verbal noun of *ts\u00e1nke*, \u2018to become,\u2019 \u2018to happen,\u2019 and the sentence therefore is literally, \u2018that affair happening\u2019 (*hone se*), or \u2018having happened how many days have been?\u2019\n\n2. *D\u00e1na p\u00e1ri l\u00e1gi r\u00e1kch\u00fc k\u00e1ngles.*\n\nThey came formerly from beyond the hills.\n\n*R\u00e1kch\u00fc* here strictly means \u2018[they are people] coming,\u2019 or \u2018comers,\u2019 or \u2018who came,\u2019 just like the Hindi *\u00e1new\u00e1l\u00e1*.\n\n3. *Kuchi birinch\u00fc ale?* \u2018who sent it?\u2019\n\n*Kuchi* = instrumental case of *kos*, \u2018who,\u2019 *ale*, future of *leke*, \u2018to be,\u2019 used in the sense of \u2018may be.\u2019 I should translate this, either \u2018who may be the sender?\u2019 (in which case *birinch\u00fc* would be an active participle, and *kuchi* used irregularly for the nominative *kos*, just as *ng\u00f3i*, which is really an instrumental, is often used for a nominative); or \u2018by whom may it be sent?\u2019 where *birinch\u00fc* would be used passively.\n\nIn connection with this interpretation, observe the remarks on the formation of the passive voice in the next paragraph. I incline more to the first of these two interpretations; the difficulty about *kuchi* is explained by a reference to Hindi. The influence of this language is so marked in Magar, that it may fairly be assumed that in trying to imitate the somewhat intricate use of the instrumental as a nominative in the Hindi *ne*, in such phrases as *usne dekh\u00e1*, \u2018he saw,\u2019 the Magars have fallen into the error so commonly perpetrated by the\nlower classes of Hindustanis, of using the instrumental out of place. As is well known, an ignorant Hindustani, in trying to talk classically, will often commit such an error as *ham ne dekht\u00e1 hai*, or *ham ne baith\u00e1*. It may be pardoned to the simple Magars to have erred, where even their models are not always correct; and this interpretation preserves to the form in *ch\u00fc* its usual and appropriate active sense.\n\n10. The passive voice is not often used in Magar, it may be doubted if it really exists. The idea of a passive is a somewhat artificial one, and not necessarily inherent in the scheme of any language. It can scarcely be said to exist in Tibetan, or in Hindi, the two languages which are, so to speak, the parents of Magar. In both these languages a periphrasis, more or less arbitrary, is employed. The idea \u2018I was beaten,\u2019 is simply and quite as fully expressed by, \u2018he has beaten me.\u2019\n\n*M\u00e1 nungas dereng, nangke detach\u00fc le.*\n\nIf you do not go, you will be punished.\n\nHere the object is in the accusative case, and the verb is active, literally \u2018thee beating is,\u2019 i.e., \u2018some one is (or will be) beating thee.\u2019\n\nThis is one way of expressing the passive; another is\u2014\n\n*Ite m\u00e1 dangle,* \u2018it cannot be seen from here.\u2019\n\nLiterally \u2018hence not sees,\u2019 i.e., \u2018one does not see (it) from here.\u2019\n\nA third method is in imitation of the Hindi\u2014\n\n*Kos ke bhira nunga,* \u2018who was sent?\u2019\n\nThis is word for word the Hindi *kisko bhej\u00e1 gay\u00e1*, i.e., the active preterite compounded with the verb *nungna*, \u2018to go,\u2019 literally \u2018who sent went.\u2019 Both in Hindi and in Magar the person is often placed in the accusative, where logically the nominative should occur.\n\nThe verb *ngunke*, \u2018to sit,\u2019 is also used in forming the passive. *Detak\u00e1 ngu\u00e1*, \u2018he was beaten,\u2019 literally, \u2018he sat beaten.\u2019\n\nInasmuch, then, as there is no separate form appropriated to the expression of the passive, we are justified in saying that no passive exists in the language. A Magar will twist the\npassive sentence round till he expresses the idea, looking at it from the opposite point of view, by an active verb; and if this cannot be done, will express the idea by one or other of the above periphrases or compromises.\n\n11. Reciprocal, causal, and other forms of verbs found in cultivated languages, do not exist in this rude dialect. Nor are there any traces of a subjunctive, or potential, or optative mood. The list of verbal forms given above, comprises, it is believed, every verbal variation in the language. The subjunctive is expressed simply by the indicative or primary form, sometimes with the addition of the word *dereng* (or *delen*, or *delek*), which apparently means 'then.'\n\n12. The potential is resolved into two words\u2014'I may go,' becomes 'I to go am able.' The optative, 'may it be!' would be rendered 'I wish that it will be.'\n\n13. Necessity, as in the phrase, 'I must go,' is expressed by the paraphrase, 'to me to go is,' *ng\u00e1ke nungke le*. This form is also often used for a simple present or future, as *ng\u00e1 k\u00e1m z\u00e1tke le*, 'I will do the work,' (for *z\u00e1tle*).\n\n14. The verb *leke*, 'to be,' is used as an auxiliary in the formation of the present tense. It is only found in three forms, *le*, *\u00e1le*, and *les\u00e1*. Of these *le* is the present; *\u00e1le* is strictly the future, but is used as a present and potential; *les\u00e1* is used in affirmation. For the meaning of *s\u00e1*, see the chapter on expletives.\n\n15. The infinitive ends, as will have been seen, in *ke*. This affix is the same as the affix of the dative case of nouns, and in this respect resembles the use of 'to' in English 'to go,' etc. In some cases a word in Magar is both a noun and verb, as *lhi\u014bg*, 'sing,' and 'a song.' Here *lhi\u014bgke* means both 'to a song,' and 'to sing.'\n\n**Section 6. The Adverb.**\n\nAll nouns, whether substantive or adjective, may be used adverbially, which is the same as saying that where we in English would use an adverb the Magars use a noun, and this latter is the more correct way of putting it. By fitting foreign languages to the Procrustean bed of our own, we lose\nmuch of their peculiar type. Instead of saying, 'he speaks well,' a Magar says, 'he speaks good,' or 'in a good manner.' Adverbs of manner, such as are expressed in English by the affix *ly*, as 'valiantly,' 'conscientiously,' and the like, are rendered in Magar by the phrase 'in a (valiant, conscientious, and so forth) manner,' and the adjective will be found in the Dictionary. Adverbs of time, place, quality, and quantity will be found there also, as well as in the comparative table under the section on pronouns.\n\nThe adverbs of quantity end in *arangch\u00fc*, which is a corruption of *karangch\u00fc*, 'great.'\n\nAdverbs of place end in *la* or *lag*, which is probably the Tibetan *lag*, 'hand;' as we should say, 'on this hand,' or 'that hand.' It is noticeable that a final *g* appears in the pronunciation of these words before a vowel or *ng*.\n\nEx.: *Ilag nguna*, 'si there.' *Hose kulag ale*, 'where is he? On the contrary, *ila rand*, 'come here.' This termination is apparently connected with the affix *lagi* or *laki*, 'from,' which seems to be an instrumental case of *lag*, 'a hand.'\n\nThe adverbs of quality have a hybrid look, and appear to be compounded of the Sanskrit words *kas*, *tas*, etc., with the Tibetan affix *to* or *tu*, which is used as the sign of the locative case in that language, and also as an ordinary mark of adverbs.\n\nThe adverbs of direction end in *te* or *the*. I am in doubt as to the origin of this termination. The inquiry is attended with some difficulty, and as my object in the present paper is only to give such etymological notes as may help towards the general comprehension of the grammatical scheme of the language, I defer the consideration of this point till I have obtained data for the analysis of all the languages of this class.\n\nThe adverbs of time are pure Hindi, except *shen*, which is Tibetan.\n\n**Section 7. Conjunctions.**\n\n\u00a7 1. There are few conjunctions in Magar. The construction of sentences is simple, and in keeping with the primitive and inartificial character of the language. The following are\nthe principal, if not all, words of this class:\u2014da, \u2018and;\u2019 da . . . da, \u2018and . . . also;\u2019 ra, \u2018and;\u2019 ki, \u2018or;\u2019 parantu, \u2018but,\u2019 \u2018however;\u2019 ma, \u2018no,\u2019 \u2018not;\u2019 (Tib. ma).\n\n\u00a7 2. \u2018If\u2019 is either not expressed at all, or inferred from the structure of the sentence. \u2018If I see him, I will tell him\u2019 would be expressed, oske dangle ra, khabar ahe, \u2018I shall see him, I will tell him.\u2019 Here ra is properly an expletive, and adds force to the idea of seeing; to make the idea more clear, a Magar would add the opposite contingency, \u201cI shall not see him, I will not tell him.\u201d In ordinary colloquial Hindustani, a similar construction often occurs, as dekhen, to kahenge, literally, \u2018I may see (him), then I will speak.\u2019 Much of course depends on the tone in which the sentence is uttered, and in a language which has no literature or written character, the construction of sentences seems always to proceed on the supposition that they will be spoken, and thus derive sufficient aid from the tone and manner of the speaker to make the meaning clear, without any great accuracy of expression.\n\n\u00a7 3. I do not give a separate section to interjections. They are so few as not to merit separate notice. A low grunt, or \u2018whew!\u2019 expresses surprise, assent, pleasure, and so forth. Ho, or Ho! Ho! is also used for affirmation, \u2018yes.\u2019 For the rest, the \u2018ahs\u2019 and \u2018ohs,\u2019 and the like, are common in Magar, as in all other languages.\n\nSection 8. Expletives.\n\nThe syllables ra, na, sa, da, s, and mi, are used to add emphasis and for other purposes. I have called them expletives, because they have often no other meaning.\n\n\u00a7 1. Ra (probably a corruption of the Tibetan dang, a particle of affirmation)\u00b9 is added to all forms of the verb, and appears to be simply emphatic, being inserted or omitted at the caprice of the speaker.\n\nEx.: Nga muling le ra, \u2018I was hungry (I assure you).\u2019 When added to nouns it is the same as da, \u2018and.\u2019\n\nBy adding ra to the past tense of the verb a sort of indefinite\n\n\u00b9 Or from Tibetan rang, \u2018self,\u2019 \u2018very,\u2019 \u2018indeed.\u2019\nparticiple is formed, as *bherdi\u00e1ra*, 'having folded;' *tagdi\u00e1ra*, 'having taken aim.' I have not given this form among the verbal forms as it is not strictly one. It properly means 'he did, and \u2014,' as in *tagdi\u00e1ra ng\u00e1p\u00e1*, 'he took aim and shot.' This origin of the phrase appears, however, to have been overlooked, for it is now not considered incorrect to say *bherdi\u00e1ra \u00e1ihn\u00e1*, 'fold it up and take it away,' which literally would be 'you have folded it and take it away;' rather a singular construction.\n\n\u00a7 2. *Na*; precisely similar to the Hindi *na* or *nu*, from which it is probably borrowed. It has no special meaning, but adds a certain emphasis to a sentence. Any one who is accustomed to talk to the lower classes in India must have often noticed how, after a long sentence, an emphatic *na* or *nu* seems to complete the meaning. Thus the question *chilti giy\u00e1?* seems incomplete to the ear, whereas *chilti giy\u00e1 na?* is complete and intelligible. I confess I cannot explain why; but to my ear, and certainly to that of the peasant, the latter of the two sentences seems more correct, as the former sounds abrupt and incomplete.\n\n\u00a7 3. *S\u00e1* is only met with in the verb *leke*, 'to be,' as *gipch\u00fc le s\u00e1*, 'it is good.' The three forms of this verb are *le*, *\u00e1le*, and *les\u00e1*. Of these the first requires no explanation; *\u00e1le* is properly a future, used as a present, chiefly, if not exclusively, in questions; *les\u00e1* is the reply to *\u00e1le*.\n\nEx.: *Su \u00e1le?\u2014ngo bai les\u00e1*, 'who is he?\u2014he is my father.'\n\n\u00a7 4. *S* is added to verbs in all forms, but only in the second person. I at first thought that this was a trace of conjugation, but I am now inclined to class it simply as an affix, because I observe that it is as often omitted as not. You may say *nang nungle*, 'thou goest,' or *nang nungle-s*. The most frequent use of it occurs in short sentences, as *hi z\u00e1tle-s*, 'what will you do?' 'what are you doing?'\n\nWith regard to this expletive and *ra*, I found that the use of them was looked on as a characteristic of individuals rather than a necessity of the language. One of my interpreters, Juhur Singh, interspersed his conversation with them much more abundantly than the other; and when I enquired into\nthe matter, I was told, with much laughter, that Juhur Singh was a *theg\u00e1 v\u00e1l\u00e1*; in other words, that the insertion of these *theg\u00e1s* or 'tags,' was a weakness of his, just as there are some Englishmen who seem unable to get through a sentence without saying, 'Don't you see,' 'don't you know,' and so forth.\n\n\u00a7 4. *Mi* is prefixed to words denoting parts of the human body, and is the Tibetan for 'man.' In a short vocabulary of Magar, I find 'head,' *mitalu*; 'nose,' *minaha*; 'bone,' *mirhos,* etc., etc., the fact being that the real words are respectively *talu, n\u00e1ha,* and *rhos*; as is shown, not only by the meaning of *mi,* but also by the fact that in speaking of 'my head,' a Magar would say *ngo talu,* not *ngo mi talu.* I have omitted this prefix from the dictionary.\n\n**Section III. Sentences.**\n\nThe syntax of the Magar language is so simple that I have thought it better to insert the following sentences, instead of writing a separate chapter on composition.\n\nIt will be seen that any peculiarities in the construction of the sentences are explained in the foot-notes, and it appears to me that a better idea of the language will be obtained in this way, than by a long string of rules and exceptions.\n\nThese sentences were taken down accurately from the mouths of the interpreters; and each sentence has been repeated and gone over several times, to ensure perfect correctness. Our medium of communication was the form of Hindi spoken in Chumparun. It is possible, therefore, that some of the sentences may have been influenced by the idiom and artificial arrangement of the Hindi, but as I varied my form of words three or four times in reciting the sentence, and besides gave elaborate explanations and illustrations of the exact phrase I required, I trust the influence of the Hindi has been reduced to a minimum. The foot-notes are the results often of a very long conversation on each sentence, and I often proposed other ways of putting it, which were rejected by the\n\n---\n\n1 Hodgson erroneously *mirydus,* which is used *sense obsceno.*\nMagars as unidiomatical. The sentences, as they stand, may, therefore, in spite of their deviations from the rules in the Grammar, be relied on as faithful reproductions of the Magar idiom.\n\n**Teanre r\u00e1n\u00e1.**  \nCome quickly.\n\n**N\u00e1kun ila r\u00e1ni.\u00b9**  \nPlease to come hither, sir.\n\n**Mhen r\u00e1kho (rakhni, respectful).**  \nBring fire.\n\n**Di r\u00e1kho (rakhni, respectful).**  \nBring water.\n\n**Ng\u00e1 di rakhle.**  \nI am bringing water.\n\n**Ng\u00e1 di rakhke nungle.**  \nI am going to bring water.\n\n**Di rakh\u00e1.**  \nI have brought water.\n\n**Nango \u00e1rmin hi \u00e1le.\u00b2**  \nWhat is your name?\n\n**Nango im kulala.\u00b3**  \nWhere is your house?\n\n**Ngo im Tannung \u00e1le.\u2074**  \nMy house is at Tannung.\n\n**Its Tannung kurik los le.\u2075**  \nHow far is Tannung from here?\n\n**Dhere los le.**  \nIt is very far.\n\n**Banga dino lam le.\u2076**  \nIt is five days' journey.\n\n**Ng\u00e1 dlag nungke le.**  \nI must go there.\n\n**K\u00e1nang imang\u00b9 r\u00e1ni.**  \nCome to my house.\n\n**Ng\u00e1ke jy\u00e1ke\u2078 y\u00e1ni.**  \nGive me food.\n\n**Hoska rupiya y\u00e1ni.**  \nGive him money.\n\n**Ise shing cheo.**  \nCut down this tree.\n\n**Shing bhaso.**  \nCut up the wood.\n\n**Ma chele.\u2079**  \nI will not cut it.\n\n**Ng\u00e1 ch\u00fc cheke ma hekle.\u00b9\u2070**  \nI cannot cut it.\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 **N\u00e1kun**, respectful form of pronoun of 2nd person, takes the respectful form of the verb, **r\u00e1ni** instead of **r\u00e1n\u00e1**, which is used in commanding an inferior as in sentence 1.\n\n\u00b2 Lit. 'Of you the name what is?' The verb is generally placed last, however long the sentence, and personal pronouns first.\n\n\u00b3 **Kulala**, contracted from **kulag \u00e1le**.\n\n\u2074 **Leal** would have been more correct, but **\u00e1le** was probably used in consequence of its occurring in the question. Observe that **Tannung** has no affix. This is probably omitted, because **Tannung-ang** would sound badly, or in imitation of the Hindi idiom, e.g., *ghar jdo*, where *ko* is omitted.\n\n\u2075 **Le** for **\u00e1le**. The final *k* in **kurik** is pronounced like *g*, and the *s* of **los** almost like *sh*.\n\n\u2076 Literally, 'Of five days a road (it) is.' The affix of the genitive is appended only to the latter of the two words 'five days.'\n\n\u2077 For **Nga-ke**. Case affixes are often omitted in long sentences. **Nungke le**, lit., 'to go it is,' i.e., 'I must go.'\n\n\u2078 **Imang**, lit. 'In my house,' we should say, 'into.'\n\n\u2079 **Jyake**, pronounced *jaike*, 'to eat,' lit. 'give me to eat.' Here the affix *ke*, 'to,' common to nouns and verbs explains itself. Compare Hindi *khane ko do*.\n\n\u00b9\u2070 **Che le**, 'I cut,' present, used with a future sense.

Vide sec. 5, \u00a7 3, 4.\n9 For l\u0101nghang-ang, the affix is omitted, perhaps to avoid repetition of sounds; but more probably because a Magar never inserts affixes, if he can make his meaning clear without them.\n10 Rahang, a form of the present. Vide Sect. 5, \u00a7 3, Remark 3. The affix ang is common to nouns and verbs, and means \u2018in,\u2019 rahang therefore is \u2018coming-in.\u2019 Observe that the verb is almost uniformly placed at the end of the sentence.\n11 Di k\u0101ske, \u2018to feed with water.\u2019 In the next sentence, d\u0101na k\u0101s\u0101, \u2018to feed with grain.\u2019 The sentence shows how much use is made of Urdu words in Magar.\n12 After verbs of motion the affix in ang is often used.\n13 Lit. \u2018Village.\u2019\n14 See sec. 5, remark 1.\n15 Lit. \u2018Here to sit pleasant not is.\u2019\n16 To eat has been prepared or not prepared; bhe contraction for bhy\u0101d, past tense of bhy\u0101ke, \u2018to prepare.\u2019 This contraction is merely euphonic.\nT\u00e1nre t\u00e1nre bhyo.

No, it is over, why should I go?\n\n\u00b9 Kose for kos or kus, \u2018which?\u2019 an emphatic e or i is constantly added to pronouns. It is a thegd or expletive, and is not essential to the meaning.\n\u00b2 \u00c1le, not le or lesd, as it is a question. See chap. 1, sec. 8, \u00a7 3.\n\u00b3 Tsanke differs from leke just as \u2018become\u2019 differs from \u2018be.\u2019\n\u2074 Parch\u00fc, i.e. \u2018from the other side\u2019 (to wit, \u2018of the valley\u2019). All the Magar country being mountainous, a man from another village naturally comes across a valley.\n\u2075 Sign of the genitive omitted. See sec. 2, \u00a7 1, remark 2.\n\u2076 Kahek, \u2018one day,\u2019 is apparently indeclinable. In this sentence it is in the genitive case. It is contracted or corrupted from kat, \u2018one,\u2019 and ek, which probably means \u2018day.\u2019 I cannot find in Tibetan any word which seems connectable with this according to any canons of relation of sounds. Nor does any word exist in the hill languages which is like this. The Tibetan zhag is the nearest. I incline to the idea that the word ek is an expletive or meaningless addition which has acquired by habit the sense of \u2018day.\u2019 If any one should object to the word \u2018meaningless,\u2019 I would remind him that in the Turanian family there exist many generic affixes which are really of no use to the general meaning of the sentence but merely serve to mark the class of objects to which the word belongs. This is one of them. They say nisek, \u2018two days,\u2019 etc., though the word for \u2018day\u2019 is din in Magar.\n\u2077 Past tense of chike or cheke, \u2018to cut, tear.\u2019\n\u2078 Chini here evidently means \u2018from.\u2019 It is, however, the only instance I have found of its use. It has a suspicious resemblance to the Hindi chhin lena, \u2018to take by force.\u2019 It would be too much to assert, however, that this was the real origin of it.\n\u2079 Chu is here quite an expletive, and used similarly to ngoi ch\u016b. Perhaps something in the original meaning of the word may account for its having this quasi-adjectival form.\n\u00b9\u2070 Affix ang omitted.\n\u00b9\u00b9 Lash le, literally Hindi laytd hai, which is quite untranslatable.\n\u00b9\u00b2 Lit. \u2018Having occurred it is completed,\u2019\u2014Ho chukd, Hindi idiom again.\nKam ol\u00e1 ki m\u00e1 ol\u00e1.  \nNga ngo barhin ngole.  \nNango as\u00e1b\u00e1 \u00e1lnd\u00e1.  \nNg\u00e1ke \u00e1\u00e1ato dimo kherch\u00fa\u00b9 (or bhogdishu.)\u00b2\n\nNengi d\u00e1ngch\u00fa kurik ber tsand\u00e1.\u00b3  \nIse chitti nga kh\u00e1t\u00e1 le.\u2074  \nN\u00e1kun kh\u00e1t\u00e1 le-s\u00e1; bari\u00e1 tsand\u00e1.\u2075  \nKute r\u00e1h\u00e1?

Cf. p. 208, note 3.\n\u2074 The words barid tsand are a sort of optative form, 'May it be propitious.'

'Of me the birth there indeed was; of me the father living was.' Na is an expletive: see chap. 1, sec. 8, \u00a7 2. Ale, though really a present, is here used for a past, there being no past tense of leke, 'to be;' in the same way lead at the end of the sentence, which, probably from the influence of the preceding nasals, is pronounced ne\u00e9d. Ko is a generic appellative added to nouns signifying relation. This is a strictly Turanian characteristic, and is found in Tibetan, Chinese, and the Hill languages in a far more elaborately developed form. Ngund is for ngu with the expletive na; the phrase ngund ne\u00e9d is a longer and fuller form for ngu le.\n\n\u00b2 See chap. 1, sec. 2, \u00a7 4 (c).\n\n\u00b3 Bhogdishu, past tense of bhogdishke. Verbs ending in ishke or dishke have a frequentative sense; also generally convey the idea of motion.\n\n\u2074 Lit. 'You having-fled go, again having-caught he brings.' The idea of 'if' is not expressed, being involved in the general idea of the sentence. See chap. 1, sec. 7, \u00a7 2. There is no passive, consequently the phrase, 'You will be caught,' has to be expressed by 'some-one catches you.' See chap. 1, sec. 5, \u00a7 3, remark 10.\n\n\u2075 Khos\u00e1, lit. 'he stole.' Passive again expressed by active.\n\n\u2076 Lit. 'That event happening, how many days were.' See sec. 2, \u00a7 3, rem. 9.\n\n\u2077 'Two-days were.'\n\n\u2078 s. thega. See sec. 8, \u00a7 4.\n\n\u2079 Khata is lit. 'with.'

D.\n\n[Read Nov. 30, 1868].\n\nOn comparing with one another the two most ancient periods of development of the Iranian mind, in language as well as in literature,\u2014that primitive one, whose witness is the Avesta, with the period of renaissance under Sasanian rule,\u2014we find at once this striking difference, that the former is purely national and Iranian, almost wholly free from any foreign influence, whilst the latter, as it appears in the Pahlavi translations and the inscriptions of the Sasanian kings, is overwhelmed by foreign, Semitic, or more accurately speaking, Aramaean elements. The difficulties in explaining the pure Persian substratum of the language of this latter period, for even here not every problem has yet been solved, are by no means to be compared with those offered by the Semitic forms and words, which appear to the Indo-german linguist utterly unknown, to the Semitic scholar more than strange. Though a great quantity of highly valuable material has already been collected and digested by European scholars, still I do not think it sufficient to enable us to decide in a satisfactory manner the following questions:\u2014During what time did that close intercourse between the Iranian and Semitic races take place, the existence of which we are compelled to assume as the source of the Semitic portion of the Pahlavi language? Of what kind was this intercourse? And with which of the Aramaean nations in particular? The same questions demand an answer, in order to explain the numerous Iranian words which occur in the literature of the Babylonian Jews, in Syriac, in the Koran, and the most ancient Arabic poems.\n\nOur attention is naturally drawn, in the first place, to the contemporary Syriac literature, but the reports of the Nestorian missionaries, who went forth preaching Christianity\nthroughout the Sasanian empire and beyond its northern and eastern boundaries, are lost, with the exception of a single one. Besides, the same Nestorians, and before them, the orthodox Eastern Church, established the Christian communities scattered through nearly the whole of Persia, the head of which was the J\u0101thel\u012bk (Catholicus) of Seleucia, and founded a literature for their Persian converts, a literature of translations, a few leaves of which, if extant, would afford us quite unlooked for elucidations, because they were probably written in Syriac characters, if we consider the testimony of Epiphanius, Adv. Haeres. 66; \u03a7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03bf\u1f31 \u03c0\u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u1ff6\u03bd \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u1f70 \u03a0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u1f70 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u1fd6\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03a3\u03cd\u03c1\u1ff3 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9, \u1f61\u03c3\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1 \u1f10\u03c0\u1f76 \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u1f70 \u1f14\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u1f19\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b5\u03c7\u03c1\u03ce\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03ba.\u03c4.\u03bb. As this literature has not yet been noticed anywhere, I shall here produce my proofs, specifying no less than three authors who translated Syriac works into Persian for the Christians of the Sasanian empire.\n\nM\u0101r\u0101, born in Hardash\u012br, after having studied in the University of Edessa, returned home A.D. 415, and became J\u0101thel\u012bk of Seleucia A.D. 420 for a short time. He is described by M\u0101r\u012b Ben Sulaim\u0101n, who wrote a history of the\n\n---\n\n1 Thomas, Bishop of Marga (beginning of the ninth century) gives in his \u1e24ayy\u0101t al-Abb\u0101s (\"History of Abbats\") a short report of Elias, Bishop of M\u016bl\u0101n, who preached Christianity in the country of the barbarians \"adjacent to the Dailamites.\" His report, though decidedly not free from confusion, is of some interest. The god of their ancestors was called \u064a\u064e\u0632\u0650\u064a\u062f\u064f \u062f\u064e\u0627\u0646\u0652 (\"created by God,\" or \"by the Yazata\"); sacred to him there was a holy tree, growing in a valley, which the natives showed to Bishop Elias from the top of a mountain. Its name he calls \u0623\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e (\"\u0100d\u0113r\u0101\" with the Syriac termination \"the fire\") \"the head (lord) of the wood.\" Elias proceeded to fell it (like Bonifacius felling Wodan's oak) \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064d \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u062d\u064e\u0631\u0652\u0628\u064d \u0648\u064e\u0645\u064e\u0646\u0652 \u064a\u064e\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064d \u0641\u064e\u0625\u0650\u0646\u064e\u0651\u0647\u064f \u0644\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0633\u064e \u0628\u0650\u0645\u064f\u0628\u0652\u062a\u064e\u063a\u0650\u064a \u0645\u0650\u0646\u0652 \u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e\u0627\u062d\u064d \"and the rest of the twigs around it, which they also called 'sons of Yazd,' the 'little ones,' he hewed and cut away.\" Possibly this can be combined with one of the two trees Gao-kerena and Vistukhma, both growing in the sea Vourukasha, and with the statement of Bundeheh, chap. 27, that every flower (!) is sacred to a Yazata. Cf. Assemani, Bibliotheca Orientalis, tom. 3.1, pp. 492\u2013494.\n\n2 Migae, Patrologiae Cursus completus, series graeca, tom. 42, p. 48.\nNestorian Patriarchs in the middle of the twelfth century, as \"being learned in Syriac and Persian, and the translator of many books from Syriac into Persian.\" We are also told by Bar Hebraeus, that he translated the works of Theodorus of Mopsuestia from Greek into Syriac (Assem. Bibl. Or. 3, 1, p. 376).\n\nAcacius, appointed J\u0101thelik A.D. 485, officiated as an ambassador of F\u0113r\u014dz to the court of Zeno, and is stated by the same M\u0101r\u012b to have translated into Persian the treatise of his contemporary 'Elisha', Metropolitan of Nis\u0101bis, by the command of Kaw\u0101d, who wished to have it, in order to discriminate between Christian and Manichaean doctrines (Assem. 3, 1, p. 378 ff.)\n\nJob, who flourished about A.D. 550, a Nestorian monk from Hardash\u012br, is reported by M\u0101r\u012b to have translated into Persian two works of the most celebrated teachers of the Eastern Church, the (homilies) of Abraham of Naftar, and the (canons) of his own teacher, Abraham of Kashkar. The latter of these was the founder of monastic life amongst the Nestorians (about A.D. 500). Ebedyesh\u016b' mentions his \"regulae pro monachorum regimine\" (Assem. 3, 1, p. 155, note a). The former, who probably lived about the same time, was a very popular author, both with Nestorians and Monophysites, as we may gather from the numerous remains of his works, which have survived thirteen centuries, and are at present deposited in the Vatican and the British Museum. (Add. 14, 623; 12, 167, dated A. Gr, 1187=A.D. 876; 18, 814; 17, 180; 17, 262; 14, 614; 14, 738; 17, 174). Cf. Assem. 3, 1, p. 431.\n\nAs a great many of the writers and chief authorities for the Eastern Church were native Persians, several of them converts from the Zoroastrian creed, (such as Jesaiah Bar \u1e24adab\u016b Arzun\u0101y\u0101, originally a Persian courtier, then the author of acts of Christian martyrs, about the beginning of the fourth century after Christ; Farh\u0101d, the wise Persian, who wrote his sermons, according to his own statements, be-\nbetween A.D. 337-345;\u00b9 Theophilus Persa, who wrote against Cyril; Mares Persa, the friend of Ibas of Edessa; Simeon of Betharsam, the \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn\u012b, about A.D. 525; M\u0101r Ab\u0101 I. (died A.D. 552) born a Zoroastrian, and many others)\u2014it seems natural, that some of them at least should have endeavoured to provide their fellow Christians in the Persian empire with prayers, hymns, sermons, histories of saints, rules of ascetic life, etc., in their own tongue; and, accordingly, we have precise statements as to the three Syriac authors above mentioned, two Nestorians and one before the Nestorian schism, to whom we may add from a later period, when Isl\u00e1m already prevailed in those countries, Ahron Persa, who became famous, about A.D. 665, as \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn \u1e24\u0101r\u016bn\u012b \u201cthe Persian translator.\u201d (Assem. 2, p. 104a).\n\nAs regards the contents of this literature, its having perished is no great loss to science in general, but to know the language in which it was composed would afford us considerable help in solving the problems which the Pahlavi offers. It is possible, that one day a monastery may be found, like that of St. Mary Deipara in the Nitrian desert, which will re-open to us the stores of the older Nestorian literature, and yield us amongst them perhaps a few leaves of the above-mentioned translations into Persian; but I cannot think this very likely, as the American missionaries in Urmia do not seem hitherto to have found anything of the kind.\n\nBut to return to the point from which we started, the fact of the Pahlavi being almost overwhelmed by Aramaean influence, does not seem to have altered the essential character of the language in the least, as we learn by an examination of the language of the following period of Parsee literature, that of the so-called P\u00e2zand or P\u00e2rs\u00ee translations, which are attempts to read and explain the ambiguous Pahlavi writing in a clear and distinct character. The main point in which this language differs from the Pahlavi is, that all the Aramaean words have given way to the corresponding\n\n\u00b9 The compositions of Farh\u0101d, the most ancient Syriac church-father, are published in an excellent edition by Dr. W. Wright, London, 1869, Williams & Norgate; besides, the editor is about to make them more generally accessible by an English translation.\nIranian ones, and that every Semitic element has vanished, without leaving a trace of its former existence. This is one of the chief reasons why the Pahlavi is believed never to have been spoken generally by a whole nation or tribe, but to have been the learned language of the priests in the Sasanian empire. It was, to use Westergaard\u2019s words, \u201clingua quae per studium artificiosum et quidem arbitrarium miris signis formationibusque a natura alienis onerata et sequentium temporum ignorantia magnopere obscurata est.\u201d\n\nThe date of the Pahlavi, as well as of the P\u00e2zand period, has not yet been accurately fixed. The time of the former, represented by the translations of the Avesta, by the Ard\u00e2\u00ee-Vir\u00e2fn\u00e2ma and M\u00een\u00f4ikhired, is assumed to extend from Ardash\u00eer, the son of B\u00e2bak (A.D. 227), till towards the end of the Sasanian rule; and that of the latter, represented by the P\u00e2rs\u00ee translations, from the conquest of Persia by the Arabs to the tenth or eleventh century after Christ, when the Zoroastrian creed was still widely diffused over the whole of the Iranian territories, as we learn from the coins of the Ispahbads of Taberist\u00e1n with Pahlavi legends, and from the indubitable testimony of Ibn Haukal. During the following centuries (eleventh and twelfth) the decay of the national religion was completed, its comparatively few remaining followers were confined to Yazd and other parts of Karm\u00e1n, and an emigration of some of them to India not improbably took place. In this period of misfortune and distress, we cannot expect to find any remarkable literary tendencies, and it seems to mark a second break in the tradition in a certain way similar to that which we notice between the original Zand-texts and their translations into Pahlavi. The revival of Parsee literature in India proceeded from Karm\u00e1n, where the learned tradition always was kept more free from foreign influence, and dates at the earliest from the end of the thirteenth century. In its subsequent development it may be divided into three parts, which partake, on the whole, of a more scientific and learned character, in our sense of the terms, than the former periods. The first part, written in Pahlavi, comprises views of the whole of the Zoroastrian theology or of\nportions of it, especially of the eschatology, according to the text of the Avesta, and oral tradition, such as the Bundehe\u015fh and Bahmanyasht. A certain amount of skill in writing Pahlavi seems to have been kept up amongst the Parsee clergy down to our time, as they were still able to compose the Vajar-kart-d\u00eenik, most likely within the present century. The second division of these Parsee writings composed in Persian, exhibits a sort of Talmudic literature, the riway\u00e2t, digests of the religious rules for the casuistry of common life,\\(^1\\) dogmatical and legendary treatises, the Sh\u00e2yist-N\u00e2sh\u00e2yist, the Saddar, 'Ulam\u00e2i Isl\u00e2m, J\u00e2m\u00e2spn\u00e2ma, etc. Not long after were composed the poetical redactions of these and older works, e.g., of the Ard\u00e2\u00ee-Vir\u00e2f and the Saddari n\u00e3zm, and original poetical compositions, such as the Zartushtn\u00e2ma and Ki\u0161\u0161ai Sanj\u00e2n. These latter may have been influenced to a certain extent by the tendencies prevailing in Akbar's court. To the same period, we may assign the Sanskrit translations of Neriosangh and Ormuzdy\u00e2r. As the last, and least valuable, development of Parsee literature, we have to mention that mixture of Sufism and Zoroastrianism, which had its origin during the second half of the sixteenth century, with \u00c2dar Kaiw\u00e2n (died 1618) and his followers, the so-called Sip\u00e2s\u00ee S\u00fbf\u00ees. This is represented by the Das\u00e2t\u00eer, the Sh\u00e2rist\u00e2n of Bahr\u00e2m Farh\u00e2d (about 1624) and the Dabist\u00e2n of Mu\u1e25sin F\u00e2ni.\n\nWhilst the older portions of this literature, the Avesta and its translations, have been published nearly in their entirety, the later portions are but little known. The Bundehe\u015fh has been edited by Westergaard, and more recently by Justi, and Haug promises a new edition; the Saddari n\u00e3zm, the Ki\u0161\u0161ai Sanj\u00e2n, the Zartushtn\u00e2ma, the Persian translation of the Ard\u00e2\u00ee-Vir\u00e2f;\\(^2\\) have been translated, one into Latin, the others into English; Dast\u00fbr H\u00f4shangji has published, at the\n\n\\(^1\\) One of the chief r\u00e2w\u00ees is \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u0634\u0627\u067e\u0648\u0631, to whom the first part of Z. and P. 8 is ascribed; others are \u0628\u0647\u0645\u0646 \u067e\u0648\u0686\u06cc\u0647, \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0632 \u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0646, \u0646\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0647\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0646\u06a9, \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0647, \u0645\u0627\u0646\u06a9 \u0686\u0646\u06a9\u0627, \u06a9\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u062f\u06cc\u0646, \u06a9\u0627\u0648\u0648\u0633 \u06a9\u0627\u0645\u0627\u0631.\n\n\\(^2\\) This translation (by J. A. Pope, London, 1816,) has become so rare, that neither the British Museum, nor the Library of the Roy. As. Soc. possess a copy of it.\nrecommendation and with the help of Dr. M. Haug, an old Zand-Pahlavi glossary, and the same scholar announces a Pahlavi-P\u0101zand Glossary, a translation and explanation of the inscriptions of H\u0101j\u012b\u1e6d\u0101b\u0101d, and an edition of the Ard\u0101-Vir\u0101f-n\u0101ma by Dast\u016br H\u014dshangji.\n\nIn the following pages, I shall give an account of a few Parsee works, of the New Persian class, hitherto partially or entirely unknown in Europe; not following a systematic order, but merely accommodating myself to the materials which are at my disposal.\n\nIn the library of the Royal Asiatic Society, there is preserved a paper manuscript in Persian, without date or name of copyist, but probably written about the end of the last or beginning of the present century (121 foll.). Some emendations in the margin show its having been collated with the original manuscript. On the first fly-leaf we find these two notes:\u2014\"From the Atash Bahram. The temple built at Surat by Pestanji Kalabhai Wakeel. Presented by his son Naushirwanji to John Romer. March, 1856;\" and, \"This is the book of Parsi Bahramji Naushirwanji Kraji.\" It contains two works, the first of which is a metrical paraphrase of the Min\u00f4ikhirad (metr. \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0627\u0631\u0628) foll. 1-61, beginning\n\n\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0632 \u0628\u062e\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0635\u0641 \u062e\u0631\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u06a9\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc. The author, Marzub\u00e2n, a native of R\u00e2war, is also mentioned in the title of the second poem (fol. 61 b, lin. ult.) and in several other places, e.g. fol. 9a, line 7.\n\n\"\u062c\u064e\u0646\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0627 \u0646\u0627\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0633\u064e\u062e\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a \u0631\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0648\u0637\u0646\n\n\"Now, o glorious (reader), listen to the word as Marzub\u00e2n, the native of R\u00e2war, had it.\" The name also occurs on fol. 57a,l.4, and 61 b,l.1. As to his native place, Y\u00e2k\u00fbt (MS. of the British Museum) gives the following notice:\n\n\u0631\u0627\u0648\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u062a\u06a9\u0631\u06cc\u0631: \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0648 \u0648\u0641\u062a\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648 \u0645\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0629 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646\u062f \u0645\u0646 \u0641\u062a\u062d \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0627\u0641\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u0646\u064a\n\n\"R\u00e2war, a large town in Sind, conquered by Mu\u1e25ammad ben Alk\u0101sim Attakafi;\" and this latter statement is confirmed by\n\n1 This statement is confirmed by Wilson, the Parsee religion, p. 557, note 5.\nAlbaladhori (ed. of De Goeje, p. 139, line 1), \"it is reported that Muhammad ben Alk\u0101sim took R\u0101war by force,\" which happened under the rule of Wal\u012bd b. 'Abdulmalik (A.D. 705\u2014715).\n\nThe introductory tale, in this translation, is somewhat different from that of the original. The first chapter (fol. 1b) contains the praise of God as the creator of the seven kish-wars. The second chapter (fol 2a, lin. ult.) begins with a few lines in praise of Zartusht, who is called Khil\u012bl Khada (perhaps in imitation of the Muhammadan Khil\u012bl All\u0101h, Abraham). The author then describes how Ahuramazd\u0101 revealed himself to Zartusht and communicated to him the divine writings, the twenty-one nusks of the Avasta. Vohuman and Sr\u014dsh lead him to heaven; when he has passed the five spheres, his glory is increased in the sixth by the light of the prototypes of all created beings (\u062d\u064f\u0642\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u0642); after having come to the seventh sphere, he heard the answer to every question he put; God \"gave him from the light of his veil the book of the good religion in twenty-one chapters.\"\n\nFol. 2b, l. 10.\n\nFor the purpose of comparison, I use only those extracts that are accessible to everybody in the careful edition of Spiegel (Gramatik der Parsisprache, Leipzig, 1861, pp. 128-165). The MS. of the Library of the India Office was not at my disposal, when I wrote this.\n\nMS.\nThe author next gives a very general description of the twenty-one nusks of the Avasta, and expatiates on the importance of the Khirad (\u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1), describing it as the inseparable friend and confidant of Zarathustra, by whose special help he was enabled to carry out the prophetical mission entrusted to him by Ahuramazd\u00e2. Fol. 8 a, l. 6.\n\nIn the following chapter, fol. 8 b,\n\nthe author begs God to bestow his mercy upon him, that he may give the description of the Khirad in verse. Fol. 9 a, l. 5.\n\n\"Now I have revealed the operation of the Khirad; let the Khirad itself bring me the heavenly answer (to my questions). Now, o glorious (reader), listen to the word, as Marzub\u00e2n, the native of R\u00e2war, had it.\"\nIn the last introductory chapter, fol. 9a, the author gives an account of himself, and tells us whence he received his learning. He went to Yazd and stayed there some time, occupied in learning the old traditions. His teacher tells him: \u201cOnce, a younger friend of mine, F\u016bl\u0101di Gusht\u0101b, wished to study the M\u012bn\u014dkh\u012brad, written in Pahlavi characters; at his request I transliterated it into \u2018this P\u0101rs\u012b character.\u2019\u201d When he died, Marzub\u0101n received the manuscript and turned the work into verse. I give the text in extenso. Fol. 9a, l. 9.\n\nThen follow the contents of the M\u012bn\u014dkh\u012brad in fifty-four questions and answers, foll. 10a-54a, besides a conclusion in three chapters.\n\nI. Fol. 54a.\nII. Fol. 55b.\nIII. Fol. 58b.\nAt the end there is added, in eight lines, a short account in prose of the six sorts of fires. As far as I can see, the work is complete, with one exception, viz., the first chapter is followed immediately by the ninth, though it only contains two questions and answers, the first fol. 10a, the second fol. 13b, l. 12, whence it would appear, that six questions and answers are wanting.\n\nThis may suffice as a description of the externals of the work. I shall have now to show its character and value, as well as its relationship to the Pahlavi or P\u00e2rs\u00ee text, in which I mark Marzub\u00e2n's translation by M. and the P\u00e2rs\u00ee text (edition of Spiegel) P. And first, it may be noticed, that, to Marzub\u00e2n, as to everybody who is not an accomplished master of the art of versification, the rhyme is a very serious obstacle, and that in general, we can rely more upon the first hemistich, as to the genuineness of its contents, than upon the second, where the rhyme is paramount to every other consideration. It was not the author's aim to give a translation of the work, but following the original, verse by verse, to bring its contents into a pleasing form. To effect this, he makes occasional additions or omissions, and generalises or transforms, according to the later tradition, the singularities, not to say oddities of the Parsee Mythology, which he either did not understand, or more probably did not think fit for his purpose, which evidently was to entertain. This paraphrase has not been made from the hitherto known P\u00e2zand translation; for its proper nouns sometimes appear in a different shape, which can only be owing to the ambiguous Pahlavi character, not to the Zand writing, as this expresses every vowel and consonant separately. Neither does it seem to have been made from the same redaction in Pahlavi, which is the source of the P\u00e2zand translation; for the arrangement of the single verses is sometimes different. The original is that Pahlavi text, which Marzub\u00e2n's teacher transliterated for his friend. F\u00fbl\u00e2d i Gusht\u00e2b into the P\u00e2zand character in Yazd (v. introduction). Both M. and P. are independent efforts to interpret the original; the former has often gone very far wrong, but P. too does not seem to have expressed\neverywhere the full meaning of the Pahlavi original, as Windischmann already supposed.\n\nThe dev aeshma is written in P. as usual *khashm* (Spiegel, 136, l. 27, 28), by M. \u0647\u06cc\u0634\u0645 (fol. 23b, l. 10), which is to be derived from a variety of reading of the Pahlavi text, as it occurs in the Parisian manuscript of the Bundeheesh (edition of Justi, p. 76, 10; 82, 3, 6).\n\nP. writes *ganiratha ganiras* (Sp. 142, 19), M. (fol. 52b, l. 4) \u0647\u0648\u0631\u06cc\u062a; one read the same sign *n*, the other (wrongly) \u0648, in \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0644. Among the manuscripts of the Bundeheesh, that of Copenhagen has always this reading, except in two places, that of Oxford almost always, and the Parisian one sometimes, so that I cannot see why Justi has constantly written both in his text and glossary \u062e\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0631\u0633.\n\nRa\u00eavand, Pushti Gusht\u00e2sp\u00e2n (Spiegel, 148, 8) and P\u00eahy\u00e2nsai are different names for the same mythical place, where S\u00e2m\u2019s body lies (Windischmann\u2019s Zoroastrische Studien, p. 9 and 247, Anm. 1). The Bundeheesh writes always in Zand characters *p\u00eashy\u00e2nsai*, and if we transliterate this into the Pahlavi character, we can readily explain the reading of M. \u062f\u0634\u062a \u067e\u0634\u0646\u062f\u0633 (fol. 51b, l. 9) assuming, that in his copy the second character, the compound \u064a\u0634 was missing.\n\nWhen M. writes \u0643\u06a9\u06cc for P.\u2019s *kandizh* and \u062a\u0631 for *th\u00f4zh* (Sp. 137, 34), I do not consider these to be various readings, but another tradition, probably taken from Firdausi\u2019s Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2ma, which seems to have been used by Marzub\u00e2n, as we shall see hereafter.\n\nAs to the different arrangement of the verses, I must premise, that it is sometimes extremely difficult to state which verses in M. correspond to those in P., and which verses in P. are left out in M., the more so as the latter generalised and often misunderstood his original. But, paying due regard to this, the order of the first extract (Spiegel, p. 128-133) would be, according to M., as follows:\u2014Verses 1-7, 9-11, 15, 14, 16, 17, 21, 22, 24-27, 18, 28, 19, 29, 20. He has, therefore, omitted vv. 8, 12, 13, 23.\nI lay much more stress upon the inversion of the order than upon omissions, though these, too, as we find in this chapter and elsewhere, sometimes seem to arise from other reasons than the mere caprice of the translator.\n\nI proceed to give the paraphrase (text and translation) of those extracts published by Spiegel (p. 133 ff., p. 140 ff.) so highly interesting for Zoroastrian mythology, and shall afterwards shortly point out their differences from the P\u00e2zand version. It will be noticed at once, that Marzub\u00e2n's language is by no means the classical Persian, and that he uses words, connected with the matters treated upon, that are not to be found in the hitherto accessible Persian Dictionaries. Lastly, it must be mentioned that the single MS. which is at my disposal, that of the Royal Asiatic Society, though in general a very good one, is not sufficient to constitute everywhere a pure and indubitable text.\n\n\u0633\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0644 \u0628\u0650\u06cc\u0633\u062a \u06cc\u06a9\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0646\u0627 \u0648 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0628 \u062e\u0648\u062f\n\n\u062f\u064e\u06af\u0631 \u06af\u0641\u062a \u06a9\u0632\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u06a9\u06cc \u0633\u0631\u0627\u0641\u0627\u0631 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u062e\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u06cc \u0646\u06a9\u0648 \u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0648 \u0646\u0628\u0627\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062f\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0638\u0641\u0631 \u06cc\u0627\u0641\u062a \u0637\u0647\u0645\u0648\u0631\u062a \u062a\u06cc\u0632 \u062c\u0646\u06af\u06a9 \u062c\u0632\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u067e\u0627\u062f\u0634\u0627\u0647\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u062f \u0648\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u062f\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647 \u067e\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u06af\u0631 \u0627\u0647\u0644 \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u062f \u062f\u06af\u0631 \u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u062a \u062e\u0648 \u0632\u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u06cc\u06a9\u0633\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0646\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0632\u06cc\u0631\u062a\u0631 \u0633\u0631 \u0627\u0646\u0641\u0631\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u062f \u06cc\u0632\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u06cc \u062a\u064e\u0631 \u0633\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0632\u0622\u0646 \u067e\u0633 \u067e\u062f\u06cc\u062f\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0631\u062f \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u062f \u0647\u0631\u06cc\u06a9\u06cc \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u062f\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0622\u062b\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u0646\n\n1 \u0627\u06a9\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u062f \u062c\u0648\u06cc\n2 Cf.

Besides these just and strong kings\u2014so one after the other down to Gusht\u00e2b Sh\u00e2h, who went on the path of God's religion\u2014some were oppressors, some just, some unjust, some good-natured. Why at all did God evince a want of them, which proved useful? Was it not good to put aside the wicked? to raise the good ones higher?\"\n\nThus he answered: \"God, from glory, recognised in this the signal of good. According to his wish he gave assistance to all of them, through which he afterwards opened the door of advantage. From the goodness and probity, injustice and justice, which, in a certain manner, was the character of each of them\u2014the revolution of the globe and the course of time, appeared and disappeared (\u1f10\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u1f70 \u03b4\u03c5\u03bf\u1fe6 f. went on) in this manner. Through use and damage, noble and mean tendencies, the creation in this manner was disturbed. The almighty, wise, and victorious God received from each (of them) a different use.\"\n\nKay\u00e2marth was useful by cleaning the world of devils and lusts; he did not think his own body precious (i.e. offered it); he prevented the hand of damage from doing evil. Also, over all mankind, he increased welfare till the day of resurrection. Out of the mines he brought forth all sorts of metals, iron, steel, silver, and gold.\n\nH\u00f4shang was useful in destroying the building and the impure devil; he killed two parts of all the devils of the world, when the time of severe revenge came over them. Dev and demon trembled at him; he is the founder of the jashni sadah (festival on the 10th of Bahman). Many institutions (besides) are founded by him, and he did many deeds.\n\nThe victorious Tahm\u00fbrath was useful in binding 'Ibl\u00ees, in making him powerless and helpless, using him as a sort of\nvehicle during thirty years. The other use is this, that he made known the writing and reading of seven sorts of characters. He taught mankind the lines of the architect (taking them away) from the devs of a bad age.\n\nJamsh\u00eed had the use, that during a long time there was no death, lust, or oppression in the world. The world was adorned with cheerfulness; trouble and sorrow and misfortune decreased; it forgot all evils and embraced the cushion of affection. Further, as a deed of justice, he founded the science and art of the world, according to the law of heaven.\\(^1\\) All sorts of things were established by him. He made Jamkard a happy place, in which God recognised the good qualities. Then, from the snow and darkness of the dev, Malk\u00fbs, being so terrible that there arose a cry from the whole world, the Jinns and their servants are destroyed at once; of that dev nothing remains. God opens a door of the Jamkard and brings forth all sorts of beings, running, speaking, creeping, and growing. He gave to the world a world-guard, and increased the unanimity of the world. The world becomes cultivated a second time, and it (leg. \u0631\u064e\u062c\u0650\u064a\u0652\u062a\u0650\u064a\u0652) gets another station. In the third place, he chose, from all pure things, the eatable ones, that food which is suitable according to the law of God; he ordered abstinence from filthy food and impure nourishment. Further, of all quadrupeds in existence, of the (whole) world, he did not give a part to the devs. This effect came only from Jamsh\u00eed, that the whole world depended, in fear and hope, upon him.\n\nFurther, the Almighty God saw this advantage resulting from the serpent of the shoulder and Afr\u00e2si\u00e2b, that, since the days of the wicked king had come, an age of the revengeful Ahri man, he transferred the dignity of the reign to them, whose nature was founded upon the action of the devs. And, if the sovereignty had not been settled on them, Ahri man would have reached his intention; to H\u00easham he would have given the dominion of the world with oppression and tyranny, and that impure devil would not have been routed nor put to flight from the world till the day of resurrection. If, in that man-\n\n\\(^1\\) Verse 32 is omitted, as the text is corrupt.\nner, a dev had been the master, the world would have been utterly ruined.\n\nThe brave Fer\u00ead\u00fbn had this use, that he chained D\u00e2h\u00e2k, the friend of the dev, with such a chain, that there is no deliverance nor quarter for that magician. And another use he afforded, in blotting out of Er\u00e2n the unfortunate traces of the devs by cleaning the earth of them.\n\nMin\u00f4ch\u00eehr became illustrious by this use, that he took revenge on his father-brothers\u00b9 Salm and T\u00fbr. He cleared the earth of magicians with prudence and\u2014a heavy club. He took many a city from Afr\u00e2si\u00e2b, and got an ample satisfaction from him.\n\nKaikob\u00e2d was useful in opening the doors of justice to his people, in maintaining his government in perfect order, in keeping justice and virtue in a flourishing state. He always gave thanks to God and wore the belt, and from him the family of the Kayanians is derived. In the world he was exalted, and he went the way of virtue and dignity.\n\nKarsh\u00e2b (Keres\u00e2spa) was useful in killing the dreadful serpent, that was like a high mountain. When he raised his hand with arrow and bow, he killed the stupendous bird Kamak. Many a dev and beast of Ahriam\u2019s creation, perished in fight with this hero.\n\nThis advantage came from the famous S\u00e2m, that he cleared the earth of the water-devil. He destroyed the house of the dev Gandarb; he raised a cry from the waterwolf. If, on the surface of the earth, a single one of the horrid creations of Ahriam had remained, there would have been no knowledge of the resurrection in the world, no hope of the good.\n\nBy Dast\u00e2n and Rustam also some good, hidden and manifest, was done in the world.\n\nKai K\u00e2\u2019\u00fbs had this use, that Siy\u00e2vakhsh came from him.\n\nSiy\u00e2vakhsh had this use, that virtue and purity appeared from him, when he built a castle called Kang, whose use the\n\n\u00b9 So Neriosangh \u201cpitrbhr\u00e2taran;\u201d \u2018Edal b. D\u00e2r\u00e2b in the \u201cFarhangi Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2ma,\u201d (M.S. of the British Museum Add. 24413 f. 46 b. 2), \u201cpaternal and maternal grandfather.\u201d\nwise Siy\u00e2vakhsh had recognised. He conducted himself with purity and virtue, when Kaikhusr\u00fb was born to him.\n\nFrom the illustrious Kaikhusr\u00fb arose this advantage, that he diminished the honour of all the magicians. That prosperous father killed the king of the magicians, Afr\u00e2si\u00e2b. Every action he founded on virtue, the world he freed of magicians. On the mountain, he concealed the door of Kang Castle, according to God\u2019s order, without helper or mate, so that for nobody is there now a way to it; no one knows how to reach that place, until Siy\u00f4sh\u00e2ns appears. The guard of the world opens for him and adorns the seven kishvars beautifully, for his sake.\n\nLurh\u00e2sp (c. Luhr\u00e2sp) afforded a use, by being a constant worshipper of God, by maintaining the whole government in order, by accepting the din and keeping it well in his memory. He destroyed the very traces of idols and their temples, he established the rites of the fire-temples. He strove after noble purposes and bestowed benefits upon good men. From the Jews and magicians he took away the land from one end to the other, when that king Gusht\u00e2b appeared from his house.\n\nFrom Gusht\u00e2b the world got this use, that he spread the pure religion at this time, and destroyed the worshippers of idols. He praised only the din of God, he eradicated the followers of a wicked religion. He crushed the top of the cupola of the idol temple. The bad teacher ceased to exercise evil influence. He gave assistance in everything to Zartusht, by this his reign became famous. On account of his deeds, he was raised from a great man to a king amongst all the Amsh\u00e2sfands. Most of the devs were defeated by him, he made all Drujas powerless. Pash\u00fbtan and Isfandiy\u00e2r came from him and J\u00e2m\u00e2st, the wise man of his time. All good increased by them, no age saw or heard of men like them. They afforded benefit to the world, impure customs and manners vanished. A new law they founded, an excellent groundwork; they made the world free of evils.\n\nAll these (things) were the use from God, because all of them (the above mentioned heroes and kings) were bearers of a suitable good.\n53rd Question of the Wise Man, and Answer of the \u03c3\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03b1.\n\nThat wise man asked again\u2014Who has built Kang-diz? After being made, where was it hidden? Who hid it on the earth?\n\nWhere is that fortunate Jamkard? Who built it and hid it? Where does the body of S\u00e2m rest, from eternity to eternity?\n\nWhere is the residence of the happy Ser\u00f4sh, for whose sake devils and beasts are in trouble?\n\nWhere is the residence of the ass with three feet, whose helper is the guiding Jzad?\n\nWhere is the Vourukasha, H\u00f4m, the preparer, who has grown higher than fate and star? through whom the resurrection is prepared, dev and magician fly from him.\n\nWhere is the pure Mobad, the king of the morning? his occupation is to think of God. When the fish Galm\u00e2h\u00ee comes, what is his work and his place? Where is S\u00eemurg\u2019s nest, and what is sought from him and obtained?\n\nWhere is the place of Amr\u00f4sh and Camr\u00f4sh? and what good comes from them?\n\nIt answered thus: As to the place where Kang-diz is\u2014keep it well, that I may say it to you. The blessed Ser\u00f4sh has assigned to it, from its foundation, the place between earth and air, above the pure and distinguished Er\u00e2n, neither in heaven nor on earth. Siy\u00e2wakhsh built it from the foundation in purity and virtue, and without sin.\n\nIf you ask for the Jam-kard, it was built by the happy Jamsh\u00eed, in Er\u00e2n, and well-skilled men constructed it under the earth. Of all best things, prudent men, birds, cows, sheep, of everything that grows, that is edible, that can be used as clothing or bedding, which is of a good and auspicious class,\u2014of all these there is something in that glorious place; so that the whole world was deprived of all its property. Again, the world shall become flourishing, through all those hidden and incarcerated things.\n\nIn the plain of Pashandas lies the body of the noble S\u00e2m before the Dam\u00e2vand. The creator ordered 99999 farvars of\nthe pure men (to watch over him), that it might be safe from magicians and devs. So they watch over it, night and day, till the day of the resurrection.\n\nThe pure Ser\u00f4sh, with auspicious look, stays in the sea of the Vis-tukhma tree. The creator has called him, by way of grace and blessing, \"master of the world,\" because all help in the world comes from him. The defeat of the devs comes from him; he watches by night over good men, and also by daytime he takes care of them. He knows what is manifest and secret, and cares for body and soul. The bold Ser\u00f4sh beats the devs, being a protector of goodmen for the time of the battle of hatred.\n\nThe ass, which is called \"three feet,\" has its residence in the sea of the Vis-tukhma. It is destined for manifold purposes; purity, virtue, and welfare come from him. All water coming out of the ground, which has been stained by dirt and carcass, is purified by him.\\(^1\\) When the eye of this ass falls upon water, it purifies all impurity and vice.\n\nThe heart of the preparer H\u00f4m is hidden in the sea Vourukasha; he rejoices this kishvar. His residence is close to the Vis-tukhma, in the Vourukasha. The creator gave him, as guardians, 99999 farvars, which always watch over him. Also, the benevolent Galm\u00e2hi has his place around him, that the water devil (Ahriman's toad) may not hurt him, protecting him from all sorts of kharastars.\n\nThe virtuous Mobad Sh\u00e2h, whose profession is praising God, stays in Havirath. From the head to the middle of his body, he is like a man; from the middle to the feet, like a terrible cow. His residence is in the sea of the Vis-tukhma, always engaged in pious meditation. He is always in the sea, in fear and sorrow, acknowledging and praising the pure God. He pours out into that sea the water made for worship (zaothra), that dev and magician may perish. Hundreds of thousands of kharasters perish by each drop of water in that sea. If he does not constantly praise, if he does not pour the Zaothra into the sea, then, at rain-time, it would rain kharasters full of violence and hatred upon the earth. From this plague, the earth\n\n\\(^1\\) Verse 38 is omitted as the text is corrupt.\nwould be in darkness and distress, neither dust nor stone would remain in it. Neither leaves nor fruit would be on the branches any longer, mankind would perish most cruelly.\n\nSimurg, with wide step, lives upon the palm tree Vistukhma; in Arabic they call it the fortunate T\u00e2b\u00e2. Sitting down, he breaks off 1000 branches; when he alights, 1000 huge branches, with leaves and fruit, grow out. When the heavy branches are broken off, all the seed is poured into the sea. This seed, with the wonderful branches, is scattered in the deep sea. Then, the careful Camr\u00f4sh, on the strand of the sea, commits it to Tishtar. A second time, Tishtar brings it to the waves, commits it to the clouds, and sends it to the zenith. That cloud rains down fruit, gloriously bringing seed on the surface of the earth, on the mountains, forests, meadows, deserts, valleys, and borders of the sea. Trees and herbage, and various coloured roses grow from that seed in abundance; a world in the world, all that is in it, everything that grows, high and low; everything in existence depends upon the Vis-tukhma.\"\n\nThe contents of these extracts are to be compared with the results of Windischmann's and Spiegel's mythological researches;\u00b9 they will enable us to explain nearly all the variations from the P\u00e2zand text, especially the additions made by Marzub\u00e2n. Only of the building (\u0628\u064f\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u062f) destroyed by H\u00f4shang (i. v. 20), and of \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0634\u0627\u062f instead of G\u00f4patish\u00e2h (ii. v. 10, 45 ff.), I cannot give any account.\n\nV. 12. To the one use afforded by H\u00f4shang M. (Marzub\u00e2n) adds another, the foundation of the festival Cashni sada in conformity with Firdaus\u00ee, and perhaps taken from him. The report of it from the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma is given by Windischmann, p. 194-96.\n\nV. 31. M. relates (v. 31-33) a use of Jamsh\u00eed, the foundation of science and art (\u0622\u062f\u0627\u0628), which is not in P. (P\u00e2zand text).\n\nV. 35. That \"malk\u00f4s\u00e2n\" (the biblical \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea), described in P. as a \"rain,\" in other sources as a winter, appears here\n\n\u00b9 Zoroastrische Indien, ed. Spiegel, Berlin, 1863; Spiegel, Avesta \u00fcbersetzt iii. p. lii. ff.\nas a dev, according to the later tradition. Richardson's Persian Dictionary: name of a wicked person, on whose account the deluge was sent according to a notion of the ancient Persians.\n\nV. 41, 42. The third use of Jamshid, the definition of that which is allowed to be eaten and drunk according to the religious law, not being found in P., is probably to be derived from Yasna 32, 8. \"Bag\u00e2, Neriosangh's dakshanay\u00e2\" (in the passage, \"yo manushyebhyah sam\u00e2sv\u00e2dayati asm\u00e2kam pa\u00e7\u00fbn\u00e2m dakshanay\u00e2 kh\u00e2danan\u00ee,\") seems to have been taken in a meaning like the Pahlavi, thus \u062f\u0627\u06a9\u0634\u0627\u0646\u0627\u06cc\u0627, or P\u00e2rsi saz\u00e2h\u00e2h, \"in the right, lawful manner.\" (Cpr. Windischmann, p. 26, 27.)\n\nV. 43. The fourth use of Jamshid is also wanting in P. The second use in P. (v. 25) is not mentioned in M., but I think it extremely likely, as Windischmann (p. 203) has already supposed, that P. has in this place misinterpreted the original.\n\nV. 45-46. That Azhis dah\u00e2ka is called \"dizh p\u00e2dish\u00e2h\" (so in P., Spiegel, p. 132, v. 22, dahew\u00e2t, dah\u00e2k), is to be explained according to the later tradition; it was taken as an 'id\u00e2fa, \"az i dah\u00e2k,\" the serpent of dah\u00e2k, and afterwards divided into two mythical beings: the serpent (\u062c) and Zoh\u00e2k. This latter is the son of an Arabian prince, who rules the world 1000 years, being a personification of all sin and impurity. Er\u00e2n left Yima, anarchy arose, an army goes to Arabia, making Zoh\u00e2k king of Er\u00e2n. Yima flies, is captured and sawn to pieces. From \u062c the tradition made two serpents: the devil kissed the shoulders of Zoh\u00e2k and two serpents grew out of it (hence \"m\u00e2r i d\u00f4sh,\" the serpent of the shoulder, v. 45), requiring as food human brain. This tradition, I should say, is a picture of the Conquest of Persia by the Arabs, the colours mixed up from very old and quite modern substances. Accordingly the \"dahew\u00e2t\" of P. can probably be taken as a hint of the time of its composition being after the Muhammadan conquest.\n\nV. 62-64. Between Kaikaw\u00e2t and S\u00e2m, M. inserts Kere-\u0161apa on his own authority, but in conformity with the tradi-\nThe serpent, which he kills, is the Srvara, well known from Yasna 9, 9. His killing the bird Kamak is also related in the mythological poems published by Spiegel (Einleitung in die traditionelle Literatur der Parsen, p. 343, v. 217).\n\nV. 65, 66. M. contains some mythical elements, which I cannot thoroughly explain. The \u062f\u06cc\u0648\u0622\u06cc denotes ii. v. 45. Ahriman\u2019s toad mentioned in Bundehesh, chap. 52, and is given in P. by \u201cvak\u201d (frog). Perhaps the \u201csh\u00ead\u00e2 i dayan mayy\u00e2,\u201d (Bundehesh, ed. Justi, page 48, 5), whose enemy is the beaver, should be explained individually, not generally, as Justi does (ib. p. 27, 8, 9).\n\nV. 66. Gandarb is in the later tradition the minister of Zoh\u00e2k (Windischmann, 35, 40), but a special \u201cbuilding of Gandarb\u201d is not known to me. The \u0622\u0628\u06af\u0631 \u201cwaterwolf,\u201d may possibly be combined with the dev Khavah, who appears in the shape of a wolf (Bundehesh, ed. Justi, p. 47, 17).\n\nV. 69. Between S\u00e2m and Kah\u00f4s, M. inserts S\u00e2m\u2019s son Dast\u00e2n, and Rustam, the son of Dast\u00e2n, probably from the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma.\n\nV. 81-86. The information which M. has concerning Luhr\u00e2sp\u2014more than P.\u2014is generalised from Firdaus\u00ee, whose report is given and explained by Spiegel (Avesta, uebers ii. p. xi).\n\nV. 94-97. Regarding Kai Gusht\u00e2sp, M. is more detailed than P., adding the names of his sons Pash\u00fbtan, Isfandiy\u00e2r, and J\u00e2m\u00e2st, of whom especially Pash\u00fbtan (Pesh\u00f4tanus), the ruler of Kangdizh, and the companion of Siy\u00f4sh\u00e2ns is a well known hero of the Zoroastrian mythology.\n\nII. v. 13. To Camr\u00f4sh in P. (v. 10) M. adds Amr\u00f4sh; both Camru and Amru occur in the Farvard\u00edn Yasht (v. 109).\n\nV. 17. M. gives the additional information of the building of Kangdizh, by Siy\u00e2wakhsh, in conformity to the Sh\u00e2h-n\u00e2mah (Windischmann, 17, 245).\n\nV. 24. Between v. 24-25, M. has omitted P. v. 5-7 and between v. 25-26 P. v. 9, 10 (Spiegel, p. 141).\n\nV. 56. That the tree Vistukhma was a date tree (\u0646\u062e\u0644), is a statement for which Marzub\u00e2n himself is responsible.\n\nLastly, it must be noticed, that Marzub\u00e2n\u2019s poetry is very\nmuch of the same character as the \"Erg\u00e4nzungen zu dem Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2me aus den Riwayets,\" (Spiegel, Einleitung in die traditionellen Schriften der Parsen, p. 317 ff). We have found it likely, that Marzub\u00e2n used the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma; here we find the exact quotation of it (l.l. 330, v. 69).\n\n\" \u0628\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0633\u062a \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06cc\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\u06a9 \u062e\u0628\u0631\n\n\"All this is related in detail in the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma.\"\n\nA favourite expression of both is \u062a\u0627\u0632\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u062f\u0646 \u0634\u062f\u0646 or (Spiegel, l.l. 1, p. 327, 5, 15; 330, 66, and very common in Marzub\u00e2n). I therefore feel inclined to assign both authors to almost the same age, and this scarcely earlier than the end of the 16th or the 17th century.\n\nIt remains for us to state, that Marzub\u00e2n often did not understand his original, and for this reason left out passages, or wrote something of his own invention; but from the particulars adduced above it will appear that he is an excellent witness as to the tradition of his age, always in conformity with either of the two sources of all Parsee tradition, the Zand texts for the ancient, the Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma for the modern. I would advise the future editor of the M\u00een\u00f4ikhirad not only to give the Pahlav\u00ee, P\u00e2zand and Sanscrit versions, but also this most recent recension. Habent sua fata libelli\u2014and here we have four different witnesses to the fata of the M\u00een\u00f4ikhirad, all well worthy of being listened to.\n\nThe same manuscript contains, on fol. 62-121, another work of Marzub\u00e2n, a history of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n. This is, to a certain extent, a historical novel in the modern sense, with this great difference, that here, the action is not the chief point by which the author tries to amuse his readers, but the interspersed conversations on moral topics, \"orient pearls at random strung.\" Possibly, the author had a political motive for composing this poem, as we shall see hereafter. It begins thus\u2014\n\n\u0628\u0646\u0627\u0645 \u0627\u06cc\u0632\u062f \u0628\u062e\u0634\u0627\u06cc\u06cc\u062f\u0647 \u0645\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0646\n\u0622\u063a\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u062f\u0644\u0627\u062a \u0634\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0632 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646\nThe author's name occurs again on fol. 118a 10.\n\nIn the introduction (fol. 62a-63b), he states that he intends to glorify An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n.\n\nWhen Kob\u00e2d, the father of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, became a tyrant, his brother Pal\u00e2sh was raised to the throne. After the death of Pal\u00e2sh, Kob\u00e2d, having wandered through a great part of the world, returns and takes revenge. His former enemies are compelled to fly, amongst them the wise Y\u00fbn\u00e2n. \"The world was then forty years under his dominion; he departed, and nothing remained of him but a bad name.\" Fol. 63b.\n\nHaving heard of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n's succession, Y\u00fbn\u00e2n consults his horoscope, and obtains the answer, that An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n would be a friend to him. Y\u00fbn\u00e2n writes him a letter full of advice, and begs leave to return. Fol. 69b\n\nAn\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, pleased with the letter, asks him to come. Fol. 70b\n\nY\u00fbn\u00e2n sets out and meets with a glorious reception. The following chapters are uninteresting, as the same scene is repeated several times. An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n assembles the wise men of his empire to \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1 (\u0628\u0632\u0645) with him, he holds disputations with them, in which Y\u00fbn\u00e2n naturally plays the chief r\u00f4le. The subjects of discussion are ethical common places, of so vague and undefined a character, that it is not worth while dwelling upon them. As an effort to vary the tale, I consider the episode, that An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, after having heard a sermon of Y\u00fbn\u00e2n's about moderation, resolves to send back to his home the son of Mundiri 'Arab, who is kept at court as a sort of prisoner on account of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n's having fallen in love with him (fol. 74b).\n\nAfter several disputations, follows another episode, fol. 88b. The Kaisar begins to oppress his people; An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n writes to him, order-\n\n1 Metr.\ning him to conduct himself with more propriety. Kai\u1e63ar obeys, excuses himself and sends valuable presents and treasures, with which An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n constructs a garden, and builds in it a beautiful hall (\u0628\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0646). After this he invites the Kh\u00e2k\u00e2n, Kai\u1e63ar, Fa\u011ff\u00fbr Sh\u00e2h, and Sh\u00e2hansh\u00e2hi Hindost\u00e2n to come and see his work: they come and admire it. An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n\u2019s power spreads so far, that \u201call the seven kishwars are to him as slaves (\u0628\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0631\u064e\u0648\u064e\u0627\u0631).\u201d\n\nFol. 92a, there commences an account of his building, the Adar Gushasp on the summit of a mountain, from whence he sets out for Mad\u00e2\u2019in, and erects there a palace (\u0643\u064e\u062e\u064e). Lastly, he builds his own mausoleum (\u0645\u064f\u0645\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e\u0651\u062f\u064e); Y\u00fbn\u00e2n writes a book of which one copy is deposited in the \u00c2dari Gushasp, another in this dakhma.\n\nHere (fol. 100b) the first part of the history ends. As a transition to the second part of the work, the author gives an account of the Sasanian kings, after An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, till the time of Mu\u1e25ammad. Though all of them had the desire to see the two large buildings of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, none of them could find the way to them, but at last, \u2019Ali succeeded, with three companions, \u2019Abdurra\u1e25\u00eem, M\u00e2m\u00fbn, and \u2019Abulkhair. He goes, with a large army, to the \u00c2dari Gushasp; here, an aged Mobad, R\u00e2mish \u00c2r\u00e2m, brings forward an old book in Pahlavi, the one written by Y\u00fbn\u00e2n: the future is predicted in it, the mission of Mu\u1e25ammad, the conquest of Persia by the Muslims, etc. \u2019Al\u00ee admires it so much, that he orders \u2019Abulkhair to translate it into Persian: then \u2019Al\u00ee sets out for Mad\u00e2\u2019in (also called \u201cMadina\u201d), where the K\u00fbtuwals meet him and describe the dakhma as inaccessibly situated within a palace (\u0643\u064f\u0648\u0634\u064e\u0643\u064e). \u2019Al\u00ee, displeased by their advice, sets out again, resolving to destroy the k\u00fbshak in order to come to the dakhma. But his army, after having worked a whole year, sees that its destruction is impossible. Then, an old servant in the dakhma (or margauzan), whose ancestors were appointed to watch it by An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n himself, is led to \u2019Al\u00ee. The pir tells him, that the dakhma is inaccessible to everybody, but, that An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n himself, (fol. 108b. 8),\n\"has mentioned in his own book, that a pious and just king from among the Arabs, one of the relations of the prophet of the family of H\u0101shim, will come to this auspicious mountain.\"\n\n\u02bfAl\u012b announces himself to be this king, and asks the pir to lead the way. He sets out with a few companions. After having reached the dakhma, they find the body of An\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n sitting on a throne; on a tablet and a ring are inscriptions in Pahlavi, containing moral sentences and the prediction of the arrival of \u02bfAl\u012b and his companions. \u02bfAl\u012b, after having uttered a long eulogy on An\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n, returns to Mad\u0101\u02bein, stays there three days and sets out for the Ka\u02bfba, everywhere mentioning the name of An\u016bsh\u012brw\u0101n.

Everywhere, where God's lion came, welfare increased secretly. He spoke of the justice of An\u00fbshtrw\u00e2n, always mentioning him. He wrote a memoir (\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0635\u0631) in piety and justice, mentioning in every way the good religion. May oppression be far from the followers of the good religion! an offender of them may fall into misfortune. To him who brings terror on this people a place in hell is destined. No one who is kindly disposed towards them, will ever be blamed by the family of the prophet (Mu\u1e25ammad). He will be happy in both worlds, according to the word of the prophet and 'Ali. A second time the world raised up the good religion and destroyed the root of oppression. Good men have reached their desire through it (the good religion); all trouble and disturbance is allayed. Marzub\u00e2n never ceased to pray for it most sincerely.\n\n\"As the description of the Sh\u00e2h's Margauzan is finished, we have called this 'the book of justice,' because justice is the greatest ornament in the world. Happy he who educates in justice and piety; so long as there is earth and water in existence, he will surpass (in glory) the sun.\"\n\nSome parts of this story are also found in a MS. of the British Museum, Add. 24, 413, but in totally different redactions. The two poetical fragments (metr. \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0628) fol. 69b.-74b. correspond:\n\nI. Fol. 69b.-70b.\n\nto Marzub\u00e2n, fol. 73b. 3-74b. 11.\n\n\u00b9 MS.\nII. Fol. 70b-74a. The contents are in general the same, sometimes also the wording is very similar.\n\nOn fol. 74b. there is a postscript, stating that this was copied by order of Mr. Major Malcolm S\u00e2h\u00eeb) in Bombay 1225 H. = A.D. 1810.\n\nThe same MS. likewise contains redactions in prose of the above story on fol. 49b.-57a.\n\nFol. 49b.: \u2019Abulkhair \u2019Amr\u00ee speaks of the miraculous fire-temple of An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, and of his disputation with the Mobads who lived there; they show him two books in Pahlavi, one by Zartusht himself, the other by Y\u00fbn\u00e2n. \u2019Abulkhair translates the latter into Persian.\n\nFol. 51a. The same story about An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n\u2019s father Kob\u00e2d, his brother Pal\u00e2sh, and Anush\u00eerw\u00e2n\u2019s succession.\n\nFol. 51b. Y\u00fbn\u00e2n is called to his Court.\n\nFol. 53a.-57a. contain in prose the second part of Marzub\u00e2n\u2019s tale, with the single remarkable difference, that here not \u2019Al\u00ee, but M\u00e2m\u00fbn is the hero. Fol. 57a. The colophon states, that it likewise was copied by order of Mr. Major Malcolm S\u00e2h\u00eeb in Bombay, 1225 H. = A.D. 1810. All these pieces are in the same handwriting as a Farhangi Sh\u00e2hn\u00e2ma in the same MS. (fol. 31-45), which is composed by \u2019\u00c9dal ben D\u00e2r\u00e2b (according to his own words in the preface) for Major Malcolm, and bears the same date.\n\nFol. 61a.-68b. in a different hand, offer a third redaction of the same tale Here, instead of \u2019Al\u00ee and M\u00e2m\u00fbn, H\u00e2r\u00fbn Arrash\u00eed is the hero. Some other slight variations are not worth mentioning.\n\nThe whole story is made up, as we have shown, in a not very artificial manner, of two distinct parts, and accordingly the author\u2019s purpose was a double one, in the first place, to glorify An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n, the greatest of the Sasanian kings, his\nlove of justice, wisdom, and architectural works; and secondly, to bring the earliest Islamitic history in the person of 'Al\u00ee, its chief representative for the Shi'ah, into a certain relation to him, describing him as paying the utmost reverence to An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n's memory. In this way, it would seem, the author, himself a \u0628\u06cc\u062f\u06cc\u0646, tried to establish a claim upon the Mu\u1e25amma-dans for acknowledgement of, and especially protection for the remaining followers of that creed, which was An\u00fbsh\u00eerw\u00e2n's, whom and which, 'Al\u00ee himself glorifies, according to the tale of Marzub\u00e2n (vide v. 4, 5 of the above given extract). The author adds, on his own authority, that \"he who is well disposed towards them, never will be blamed by the prophet (Mu\u1e25ammad) and his family (especially 'Al\u00ee\"). On this account, I suppose that this \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u062f or \"book of justice,\" is a child of injustice and oppression; that Marzub\u00e2n wrote it during his stay at Yazd, in a time of trouble and distress, in order to give the persecutors of his fellow Zoroastrians a more favourable idea of them. Marzub\u00e2n speaks of himself, in the last verses of the introduction to M\u012bn\u014dkh\u012brad, as follows (Fol. 9b. 10):\n\n\u0648\u0644\u06cc \u06af\u0631 \u067e\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06cc \u0633\u062e\u0646 \u062e\u0637 \u0628\u0648\u0634 \u0645\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0634 \u0648\u063a\u06cc\u0628\u062a \u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u06af\u0631\u0632\u06af\u0631\u0634 \u0686\u0631\u062e \u0628\u06cc\u0686\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0645 \u0645\u062f\u0627\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0622\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0633\u0637\u0645 \u067e\u0631\u0627\u06a9\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f \u0633\u067e\u0647\u0631 \u0646\u0647 \u06cc\u062a\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f\u0645 \u06cc\u06a9\u062f\u0645 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0647\u0631 \u0686\u0647\u0631 \u0648\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u0633\u067e\u0627\u0633 \u0632\u0628\u0631\u0648\u062f\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631 \u0647\u0631 \u062c\u0647 \u0647\u0633\u062a\u0645 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\n\n\"If you see my words orderless, excuse and do not slander. If through a revolution of fate I am helpless, continually in trouble and distress\u2014my carpet has been torn by heaven, not a moment appears to me the face of love. Notwithstanding, the cause of my praise is God, who forgives me, how sinful I am.\" Perhaps we can take this individual description as a true picture of the state of all Zoroastrians in the Persian empire at his time. As the work is addressed to the Shi'itic Persians, 'Al\u00ee is the hero, whilst in the more modern redactions (probably composed in India) Ma'm\u00fbn, or the common hero of Eastern tales, H\u00e2r\u00fbn Arr\u00e2shid, plays the chief part.\nIn the following pages I give, as a further addition to our knowledge of P\u00e2rsee literature, a review of the manuscripts treating of Zoroastrian matters, which are preserved in the British Museum. They are neither very numerous (fifteen) nor of first-rate importance, but still they give us an opportunity, in several instances, of bringing to light some things hitherto unknown in P\u00e2rsee literature.\n\nI. Arundel Orient. 54. A copy of the Vandid\u00e2d S\u00e2da, the arrangement of the three sacred books, Vandid\u00e2d, Yasna, and Vispered, in which the single chapters are mixed together in such a way as to suit the recitation prescribed for the usual worship, similar to the arrangement of the Gospels for the services of the whole year, which we find in the Evangeliaria. Interspersed in the text there are numerous notes in Pahlav\u00ee, liturgical directions for the acts that are to be executed in connexion with the text, many of considerable length and more numerous than I find in any of the Vandid\u00e2d S\u00e2das of the Library of the India Office. As they are of great importance for the Pahlav\u00ee Dictionary, and specially for its most difficult part, the liturgical terminology, they fully deserve to be edited, for which purpose this MS. would do very well, the whole being in good preservation and clearly written. The following are common in all MS.: \u0627\u0648 = Pers. \u062a\u0627, \u201ctill,\u201d \u201cetc.\u201d; \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646\u06af\u0631 = \u201ctill the passage;\u201d \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646\u06af\u0631 = \u201cto recite to the end;\u201d \u0633\u0631 \u0633\u06cc\u062f \u062f\u06cc\u0648 = \u201cto recite three times;\u201d and the names of both the officiating persons, \u0648 \u0648 and \u0648 \u0648 . Of these latter some are to be found in Brockhaus\u2019 edition (Leipzig, 1850), while all the others are wanting.\n\nOn fol. 148b, at the end, we read \u0634\u06a9\u0633\u062a \u0632\u062f \u0628\u0627\u062f \u0627\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646\u062f \u201cto say thrice: broken, beaten be the wicked, cursed Ahr\u00eeman, with all the devs and drujas.\u201d Then follows a short chapter (fol. 148b, 149a) in P\u00e2rsee (Zand character) on the evil eye (cashm) and look (nadara = \u0646\u0638\u0631), and their different kinds. The MS. has no colophon; it was probably written in Karm\u00e2n in the seventeenth, if not the sixteenth century.\nII. Reg. 16, B.V. A copy of the Yasna (fol. 158) from Hyde's library, clearly written and well preserved. As usual, the single chapters are separated by two or three stars, smaller portions by a single one.

Fol. 56a.-149a. The Farvard\u00een Yasht, invocations of the Fravashis, who exercise the \u06cc\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629 (intercession) for all mankind at Ahuramazda's throne.

The three \u00c2fr\u00eeng\u00e2ns, each preceded by a short introduction. They are also read on the G\u00e2th\u00e2s, in commemoration of the deceased.\n\n\u00c2fr\u00eeng\u00e2n G\u00e2hanb\u00e2r, fol. 149a-155b.\n\u00c2fr. G\u00e2th\u00e2, fol. 155b.-164b.\n\u00c2fr. Rapithwin, fol. 164b.-169b.\n\n4. Fol. 170-203. The Sir\u00f4za. Each prayer or invocation appears in two different redactions, the so-called greater and lesser Sir\u00f4za, one \u06cc\u064e\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0639\u064e\u0629 (i.e. to \u00e2y\u00ease yasti, the beginning of the verses in Yasna 3), the other \u06cc\u064e\u0632\u064e\u0627\u0645\u064e\u0627\u062f\u0650\u062f (i.e. to yazamaid\u00ea, compare Yasna 5 and 6). They are substantially identical with those published and translated by Anquetil, Westergaard, and Spiegel.\n\nFol. 170-173b., the Sir\u00f4za of the thirty days.\n173b.-174 (+b.), the same for the months.\n174 (+b.)-176a., for the five Farvard\u00ee\u00e2n.\n\nThen follow Dar\u00fbns for special days, a dar\u00fbn myazdi g\u00f4sfand (Fol. 180b.), for the seven Amsh\u00e2sfands (fol. 185a.); lastly, for Amerd\u00e2d, Rashnu, Asht\u00e2d, and Z\u00e2my\u00e2d (fol. 201a., unfinished).\n\nFor a better understanding of this, the following particulars will be useful. The Dar\u00fbn sacrifice is performed in honour of the seven Amsh\u00e2sfands, Rashnu r\u00e2zista, Sraosha and the Fravashis, on the days Mithra of the month Mithra, on Khurd\u00e2d of the month Farvard\u00ee\u00e2n, on the G\u00e2hanb\u00e2rs, on the five last days of the year, and on the fourth day after a death. Three Dar\u00fbns are offered, one to Rashnu r\u00e2st and Asht\u00e2d, one to Sraosha, and one to the Fravashis of the pure. The relation of Sraosha, Rashnu r\u00e2st and Asht\u00e2d to the cere-\nmony 18, \"they lead the departed souls over the bridge Cinvat.\n\nOf the third part, fol. 194a.-203 is written in Zand, the rest in Persian characters (like the short interspersed prayers in the first part). The MS. has no colophon, but was probably written in Persia towards the end of the last century.\n\nA noticeable fact in this MS., also occurring in several others, is the system of transliteration into Persian characters, applied to Zand texts. That it is a system which, to a certain degree, accurately represents the original, and is unvarying, will be proved by the following details, which may serve also as a help to the rather puzzling task of reading a Zand text in Persian characters.\n\n1 represents sometimes short a in fine, \u0645\u0632\u062f\u0627 = mazda; \u06cc = u, \u062a\u0627\u0648\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0646\u0647 taurvay\u00eani.\n\n\u0622 = \u00e2o in fine, \u0645\u0632\u062f\u0627 mazd\u00e2o, in medio \u0646\u064a\u0627\u0686\u0648 ny\u00e2o\u00f1co, \u062f\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0633\u0647 drvaity\u00e2osca; further = ao in \u0627\u0634\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645 ashaon\u00e2m; \u0627\u0645\u0634\u0646\u0627\u0645amesban\u00e2m, \u0648\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0648\u064a\u0648 v\u00e2thwy\u00f4, \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 n\u00e2meh. \u00c2o is also expressed in fine by \u0622\u0639 in \u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0647 tba\u00eash\u00e2o, by \u0627 in \u0641\u06cc\u0631\u0647\u06a9\u0627 pairik\u00e2o, and by \u0627 in \u0633\u0641\u0627\u0646\u0647\u06a9\u0648 spananh\u00e2o.\n\n\u062a represents also th \u0648\u0631\u0647\u0631\u063a\u0645 verethraghnem; \u0647 = th \u0648\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0648\u064a\u0648 v\u00e2thwy\u00f4.\n\n\u062c = j; \u062c = c; \u062e = kh q; \u062f = d \u1e0d; \u062f = dh, \u0648\u064a\u062f\u0648\u064a\u0634\u062a\u0647\u0648 vidhva\u00eashtw\u00f4.\n\n1 It may be noticed here, that in Sanscrit, as written by Parses, the \u062e = kh is usually changed into sh: h\u00fbsh\u00ee, min\u00f4ishirad.

He asked the wise Ab\u016b Zar Jamhar to compose a book about him; Ab\u016b Zar did so, calling it \u0638\u0641\u0631 \u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647. Then he reports a conversation between himself and his teacher concerning ethical topics.\n\n8. Fol. 104b.-139. The book of D\u0101d\u0101r b. D\u0101dukht, a wise man in the time of Sh\u0101p\u016br, the son of Ardash\u012br b. B\u0101bak; in questions and answers. In the introduction it is stated that the book was translated from Pahlav\u012b by Jal\u012bl b. Jahy\u0101d b. Mihrb\u0101n, and transformed into a new edition by the Mobad\u0101n Mobad Ab\u016b Nafr\u012bn (!) Sr\u014dshy\u0101r.\n\nThen it proceeds: The Kaiser \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0648\u0633 sends to Sh\u0101p\u016br, at his request, learned men to translate the Greek medical books into Persian. These philosophers encroach upon the dignity of the Zoroastrian creed, which they despise, for if the revelation in the holy books of the Persians were true, it would have taught them also the medical art. D\u0101d\u0101r answers them, that when Alexander had come to Persia, he availed himself of the Persian literature collected in Istakhr; that there Aristotle translated the Persian medical treatises into Greek; and that from him the other philosophers received this knowledge. Then follows a disputation on physical topics,\nthe generation of man, the sexes, the fr\u00f4hars, the divine sense (\u0622\u0633 \u062e\u0648\u0646), sleep, etc. At last the Greek savants, when asked by D\u00e2d\u00e2r for an explanation of the evil principle, Ahriman, are defeated. The MS. has two colophons, on fol. 104a. and 139a; it was copied by Rustam b. Tir\u00e2n in the year 1226 of Yazdagird.\n\nIX. Reg. 16. B. II.

A copy of a Pahlav\u00ee glossary, with transliteration into Zand and Persian characters, and a Persian explanation (foll. 38). It begins with seven introductory verses in mutak\u00e2rib; then a comparative table of the Pahlav\u00ee, Zand, and Persian alphabets. From fol. 3b. follows the glossary in 24 abw\u00e2b (chapters), arranged according to subjects\u2014names of God, the angels, elements, world, animals, etc.; lastly, the names of the days and months, the five g\u00e2th\u00e2s and the numerals. The whole is clearly written (in India), and in good preservation; the bottom of the first twenty leaves is a little damaged. There is no colophon, but the MS. probably dates from the latter half of the last century.\n\nThis glossary is, I think, the same that was published by Anquetil, though not in the original order, and inserted by Dr. Justi in his dictionary to the Bundehe\u015fh, and which Dast\u00fbr Hoshangji is going to edit. As nobody has given a description of the work in its original order, I have no means of deciding this question; but a careful comparison has shown me, that all the words adduced by Dr. Justi from the Parisian MS., are found here, along with some others, which do not seem to occur there. In the Persian explanation, other words are sometimes used than those quoted by Justi. About the\nidentity there can be scarcely any doubt, but possibly this MS. offers a somewhat different redaction.\n\nXV. Add. 22,378 is written by the same hand as Add. 22,379. It contains four pieces, viz.:\n\n1. Three sections of the Bundehesch (chap. xviii., portions of chaps. xix. and xx); the Pahlavi text with Persian transliteration and Persian translation, interspersed with a commentary (or glosses). Fol. 1-8.\n\n2. In the same manner, the beginning of the Shikand Guman\u00ee Gudh\u00e2r (foll. 8).

Dr. E. Polak, in his valuable book, \u201cPersien, Land und Leute, 1861,\u201d p. 28, says, that the Gabrs in Yazd are indebted for their existence, however wretched it may be, in the main to a \u201cFreibrief\u201d (writ of toleration) of \u2018Al\u00ee, which they pretend to possess, and that without this they would have vanished long ago from the soil of Iran.\n\nHitherto I was not able to state anything about the time of Marzub\u00e2n. At present, however, I see that I did not\n\n---\n\n1 By the way it may be mentioned, that Z. and P. 15 (India Office Library), which bears the title of Shikand Guman\u00ee, is a Patet in Pahlavi.\npay the necessary attention to one verse in the introduction to the translation of Min\u00f4ikhirad, viz. fol. 9b. l. 9.\n\n\u0628\u064e\u0646\u064e\u0627\u0645 \u0648\u064e\u064a\u0650\u0634 \u0643\u064e\u0631 \u0628\u064e\u0633\u064e\u0627\u0632\u0650\u064a \u0634\u064e\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0628\u064f\u0648\u062f \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0650\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0648 \u0648\u064e\u062a\u0648 \u064a\u0627\u062f \u06a9\u0627\u0631\n\n\"If you count its (the book's) name, then it will be a commemoration of me and of it and of you.\" Now, the name of the book is \u0648\u0635\u0641 \u062e\u0631\u062f and the numerical value of these characters, added together, gives 980. This, according to the era of Yazdagird, would correspond to A.D. 1612, which date comes pretty near to my conjecture on p. 30, l. 9-12.\nART. VI.\u2014Illustrations of the Lamaist System in Tibet, drawn from Chinese Sources. By Wm. Frederick Mayers, Esq., of Her Britannic Majesty's Consular Service, China.\n\n[Read April 19th, 1869.]\n\nIn the following paper some illustrations of the method by which the Lamaist succession in Tibet is perpetuated, are drawn from a work published within the last few years by a Chinese officer of high rank. Its author, M\u00eang Pao, was chief of the two Imperial Commissioners or Residents stationed in Tibet in 1840-44, and on his return to Peking printed, for private circulation, a small volume containing his official correspondence with the Emperor Tao Kwang in the course of some five or six transactions connected with the administration of Tibetan affairs. The memorials and decrees interchanged on the occasion of the installation of a new Dalai Lama possess exceptional interest, as throwing a considerable degree of light upon the method of procedure in this case, and a translation of the most important documents in this series has therefore been undertaken. For a partial elucidation of the subject in general a few notes are added in the form of an appendix. The memorials selected for translation are as follows:\n\nI. Memorial drawn up on the 9th day of the 12th month of the 20th year of Tao Kwang (January 30th, 1841), reporting that, on instituting an investigation among young children for the embodiment of the Dalai Lama, miraculous signs, of undoubted authenticity, have been verified, which is laid in a respectful memorial before the Sacred Glance.\n\nIn the matter of the appearance of the embodiment of the Dalai Lama, it has already been reported to your Majesty that a communication had been received from K\u00ea-l\u00ea-tan-si-\n\n1 See Appendix A.\nleu-t'u-sa-ma-ti Bakhshi\\(^1\\) reporting the despatch of natives in positions of dignity to inquire into the circumstances with reference to four young children born of Tibetan parents, respectively at Sang-ang-k'i\u00fch-tsung in Tibet, the tribalty of K'ung-sa within the jurisdiction of Ta-tsien-lu in Sze-ch'wan, and [two] other places. The Chancellor has now made a further report, stating that in the case of each of the four children miraculous signs have been shown, and that bonds of attestation have been drawn up in due form on the part of members of both the priesthood and laity of the Tibetans. He annexes a detailed statement in relation to this matter; and on receipt of this communication your Majesty's servants have to observe that on the previous occasion, when the embodiment of the tenth Dalai Lama entered the world, three children were discovered, [whose names] were placed in the urn for decision by lot. As the Chancellor now writes that each of the four children discovered by the Khan-pu\\(^2\\) on this occasion has been attended by auspicious and encouraging omens, we do not presume to arrogate to ourselves the choice of any one of their number, but, as regards the whole four, have on the one hand communicated in a Tibetan despatch with the Chancellor respecting the two children born within the territory of Tibet, and as regards the two children born within the jurisdiction of the province of Sze-ch'wan, have addressed a communication to the Viceroy of that province calling upon them respectively to require the parents and tutors of the children in question to bring the latter to Anterior Tibet. On this being done, your Majesty's servants, in accordance with the existing rules, will institute a careful examination in person, conjointly with the Panshen Erdeni and the Chancellor, and will call upon the children to recognize articles heretofore in use.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) These syllables represent the name or names, and possibly the title also, in Tibetan, of a functionary who appears from later memorials to have occupied the post of Vicar General or Chancellor in the establishment of the Dalai Lama. The translator assumes (without feeling absolutely certain) that the characters sounded Bakhshi, with which the unwieldy string of vocables ends, represent the Mongol word which is thus pronounced, with the signification of \"Teacher.\" The title \"Chancellor\" will henceforward be substituted for the name in question wherever it occurs.\n\n\\(^2\\) The title of one of the grades of official rank among the Tibetan priesthood. Khan-pu in Tibetan = elder.\nby the Dalai Lama; after which your servants will proceed with scrupulous care to take measures for inscribing their names on slips to be placed in the urn, and for the celebration of mass\\(^1\\) and drawing the lots in public. So soon as the individual shall have been ascertained by lot, your servants will forward a further report for your Majesty's information and commands. They now present for imperial perusal a translation of the detailed statement of the miraculous signs attending the children that were discovered on inquiry.\n\n[Enclosure.]\n\nDetailed statement of the miraculous signs attending upon four children, drawn up for His Majesty's perusal from the despatch of the Chancellor reporting the same:\n\n1. A-chu-cho-ma, the wife of the Tibetan named Kung-pu-tan-ts\u00eang, living at the Pan-j\u00ea-chung post-station in Sang-ang-k'\u00fceh-tsung, gave birth to a son on the 13th day of the 11th month of the year Ki-hai (19th December, 1839), upon a report concerning which having been received from the local headmen, the Chancellor despatched Tsze-f\u00eang-cho-ni-'rh and others to make inquiry. It was thereupon ascertained that on the night before the said female gave birth to her child, a brilliant radiance of many colours was manifested in the air, subsequently to which the spring-water in the well of the temple court-yard changed to a milk white colour. Seven days afterwards, there suddenly appeared upon the rock, behind the post-station, the light of a flame, which shone for a length of time. Crowds of people hastened to witness it, when, however, no single trace of fire remained, but upon the rock there was manifested an image of Kwan Yin and the characters of Na-mo O-mi-to Fo,\\(^2\\) together with the imprint of footsteps. On the night when the child was born, the sound of music was heard, and milk dropped upon the pillars of the house. When the commissioners instituted\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Lit., the chanting of religious formulas.\n\n\\(^2\\) Kwan Yin, the Sanskrit Avalokitesvara, is not only one of the most honoured deities of the Buddhist pantheon in China and Tibet, but is also believed to be incarnate in the person of the successive Dalai Lamas (See Appendix A). The invocation Na-mo O-mi-to Fo (Amita Buddha) is familiarly known as the ceaseless ejaculation of every devout Tibetan.\ntheir inquiry, they found the child sitting cross-legged in a dignified attitude, seeming able to recognize them, and shewing not the slightest timidity. They placed a rosary in the child's hands, whereupon he appeared as though reciting sentences from the S\u00fbtra of Amita Buddha. In addressing his mother, he pronounced the word *A-m\u00e1* with perfect distinctness. His features were comely and well-formed, and his expression bright and intellectual, in a degree superior to that of ordinary children.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing report, certificates by the local headmen and members of the priesthood and laity, solemnly attesting personal knowledge of the facts therein set forth, were appended, and were transmitted after authentication by the Chancellor to ourselves.\n\n4. Yung-chung-pu-ch'ih, wife of Ts\u00ea-wang-t\u00eang-chu, a Tibetan, living near the Tai Ning monastery, in the jurisdiction of Ta-tsien-lu in Sze-ch'wan, gave birth to a son on the 1st day of the 9th month of the year Wu-s\u00fc (19th October, 1838); and on report being made by the Khan-pu of the monastery, commissioners were despatched to the spot by the Chancellor, whereupon it was ascertained that before the birth of this child, yellow flowers blossomed during the winter months on the walls; and that on the 1st day of the 1st month in the year of his birth, a radiant mist appeared on the upper buildings of the monastery, and shone into the house of Ts\u00ea-wang-t\u00eang-chu. On the night of the 15th of the 8th month a brilliant light, as of day, was manifested. On the 1st of the 9th month, when the child was born, its right breast bore the appearance of the conch-shell; on the following day a brilliant many-coloured radiance shone in the heavens. Again, on the 25th day of the 10th month of the following year (1839), two peals of thunder were heard. On the 13th day of the 5th month, in 1840, the child was taken up to the Lo-chu-jih mountain to offer incense, when a pair of crows were seen, which hovered around and gam-\n\n---\n\n1 In order not to prolong unnecessarily the translation, two only, out of the four reports, have been translated. Nos. 2 and 3, omitted, differ in no respect from the characteristics of those presented here.\nbolled with the child, who likewise indulged in frolic with the birds. After the child returned to his home, he seated himself astride upon a grain sack, and exclaimed that he was riding upon a mule, and wanted to return to his own abode, which saying he repeated during several consecutive days. The commissioners found the child's countenance to be of an elevated and dignified cast, and his eyes bright and attractive, beyond the fashion of ordinary mortals.\n\nIn addition to the above report, certificates by the priesthood and laity of the place, solemnly attesting personal knowledge of the facts therein set forth were appended, and were communicated after authentication by the Chancellor to ourselves.\n\nThe above having been respectfully laid before the throne, a minute was received on the 21st day of the 2nd month, in 1841, from the Council of State, to the effect that on the 15th day of the first month the following decree was issued:\n\n\"M\u00eang Pao and his colleague report that with reference to the four children examined for the reappearance of the Dalai Lama's Embodiment, prodigies have been manifested in the case of each of them. Inasmuch as in this matter it is now declared to them that, four children having been examined, certificates in due form have been given attesting the appearance of miraculous signs, let M\u00eang Pao and his colleague forthwith address the Chancellor and communicate with the Viceroy of Sze-ch'wan, calling upon them to cause the parents and tutors of the respective children to bring them to Anterior Tibet in order that M\u00eang Pao and his colleague, in unison with the Panshen Erdeni\\(^1\\) and the Chancellor, may further personally put them to proof and require them to recognize articles heretofore used by the Dalai Lama; proceeding next to write out slips and place them in the urn, and to draw the lots in presence of the assembled people. When the individual shall have been determined in this manner, let a further report be made. Let this be communicated to them for their guidance.\"\n\nII. Memorial drawn up on the 8th day of the 6th month\n\n\\(^1\\) See Appendix B.\nof the 21st year of Tao Kwang (25th July, 1841), reporting\nthe verification of the child in whom the reembodiment of the\nDalai Lama has appeared, the drawing of lots in accordance\nwith the existing rule, and the fact that the entire population\nof Tibet, both clergy and laity, are penetrated with feelings\nof gratitude and satisfaction: upon the memorial bringing\nwhich to the imperial knowledge the sacred glance is re-\nverently besought.\n\nYour servants have already memorialized reporting that\nthe embodiment of the Dalai Lama having made its appear-\nance, a day had been fixed for the drawing of lots; and they\nhave now to state that they subsequently received a letter\nfrom the Chancellor to the effect that the children had suc-\ncessively arrived and had all been lodged in the Sangha Mo-\nnastery at T\u00ea K'ing, to the eastward of Lassa, whereupon he\nhad appointed the 21st day of the 5th month for proceeding\nto put them to the proof. On that day, accordingly, your\nservants proceeded to the Sangha Monastery in company with\nthe Panshen Erdeni, the Chancellor, and all the hul'ukht'u,\nkhan-pu, ko-pu-lun, etc., when it was ascertained by a careful\ninquiry into each individual case that the two children born\nrespectively at Sang-ang-k'i\u00fch-tsung and at La-kia-jih-wa in\nTibet are both aged three years, and the two children born\nrespectively in the tribalty of K'ung-sa in the district of Ta-\ntsien-lu and at the Tai Ning Monastery are both aged four\nyears\u2014that their personal appearance is uniformly sym-\nmetrical and proper, and that all alike display an elevated\ndemeanour. Hereupon the Panshen Erdeni and his associates\nlaid before them for recognition the image of Buddha wor-\nshipped by the late Dalai Lama, together with the bell-\nclapper, swinging drum, and other like articles used by him,\nall in duplicate, the genuine objects being accompanied by\nimitations. The children showed themselves capable of re-\ncognizing each individual article, without hesitation, in pre-\nsence of the assembled clergy and people, who, as they\ncrowded around to behold the sight, gave vent aloud to their\nadmiration of the prodigy.\n\n1 See Appendix D.\nA despatch was subsequently received from the Chancellor to the effect that the supernatural intelligence of the four children having been tested by joint investigation, and having been authenticated in the hearing and before the eyes of all, he would request that the names be placed in the urn and the lot be drawn on the 25th day of the 5th month; in addition to which, he forwarded a list of the names bestowed in infancy on the four children and of the names of their fathers. Your servants having in reply assented to the proposed arrangement, masses were performed during seven days preceding the date in question by the hut'ukht'u and lamas of Mount P\u00f3ta1 and the various monasteries; and, on the appointed day, the Panshen Erdeni, the Chancellor, and their associates, followed by the entire body of lamas, chanted a mass before the sacred effigy of your Majesty's exalted ancestor, the Emperor Pure,2 offering up prayers subsequently in devout silence. On the 25th day of the 5th month your servants reverently proceeded to Mount P\u00f3ta1a, and placed the golden vase with due devotion upon a yellow altar before the sacred effigy. After offering incense and performing homage with nine prostrations, they inscribed upon the slips, in Chinese and Tibetan characters, the infant-names of the children and the names of their fathers, which they exhibited for the inspection of the respective relatives and tutors, and of the assembled lamas. This having been done, your servant, Haip'u, recited a chapter from the Scriptures in unison with the Panshen Erdeni and the other [ecclesiastics], in presence of the multitude, and, reverently sealing up the inscribed slips, deposited them within the vase. The slips being small and the urn deep, nothing was wanting to secure perfect inviolability. After the further recital of a chapter by the Panshen Erdeni and\n\n---\n\n1 The mountain upon which the vast assemblage of cloisters forming the Dalai Lama's Residence is situated is thus designated, not, as Huc ignorantly states, with reference to the name of Buddha, but, as Koeppen clearly points out (vol. ii. p. 341, note), from the Sanskrit word meaning \"Port,\" and particularly signifying the port in the Delta of the Indus known as Pattala to the ancients, which tradition assigns as the original seat of the ancestors of Sakyamuni Buddha.\n\n2 The Emperor Kien Lung died 1796, who, since his final subjugation of Tibet in 1746, has continued to receive homage even posthumously as sovereign of the country.\nhis associates, your servant, M\u00eang Pao, inserting his hand within the urn upon the altar, turned the slips over and over, several times, and reverently proceeded to draw forth one of their number, which he inspected in concert with the children's relatives and tutors and the assembled lamas. The inscription upon the slip was as follows: \"The son of Ts\u00ea-wang-t\u00eang-chu, Tibetan, from the Tai Ning Monastery. Infant-name, Na-mu-kio-mu-to-urh-tsi. Present age, four years.\" The remaining slips having been drawn out and inspected publicly, the Penshen Erdeni, the Chancellor, with the greater and lesser hut'ukht'u, and all the attendant lamas, exclaimed unanimously with unfeigned delight and gladnessomeness that \"by the favour of his Imperial Majesty, who has given advancement to the cause of the Yellow Church,\" the established rule has now been complied with for ascertaining by lot the embodiment of the Dalai Lama, and the lot having now fallen upon this child\u2014who, the son of a poor Tibetan fuel-seller, has manifested prodigies of intelligence, abundantly satisfying the aspirations of the multitude\u2014it is placed beyond a doubt that the actual and genuine reembodiment of the Dalai Lama has appeared in the world, and the Yellow Church has a ruler for its governance. The minds of the people are gladdened and at rest, and the reverential gratitude that inspires us humble priests is inexhaustible.\" After this they performed with the utmost devotion the homage of nine prostrations in the direction of your Majesty's abode, expressing their reverential acknowledgments of the celestial favour. Your servants observed with careful attention that the gratitude not alone of the Panshen Erdeni and his attendant ecclesiastics proceeded from the most sincere feelings, but also that the entire population of Lassa, both clergy and laity, united in the demonstration by raising their hands to their foreheads in a universal feeling of profound satisfaction.\n\nThe above memorial having been respectively transmitted, there was received on the 23rd day of the 8th month a minute\n\n1 See Appendix A.\nfrom the Council of State, to the effect that on the 15th day of the 7th month the following decree was issued:\n\n\"M\u00eang Pao and his colleague memorialize relating the determination by lot of the embodiment of the Dalai Lama, and further report that a day of auspicious omen is proposed for the ascent of the throne; requesting, besides, that the Panshen Erdeni be commanded to return to Ulterior Tibet.\"\n\n\"In the matter of the appearance in the world of the Dalai Lama's embodiment, M\u00eang Pao and his colleague having drawn lots in public for the four children whose names had been submitted, and the drawing having produced the name of Na-mu-kia-mu-to-urh-tsi, son of the Tibetan Ts\u00ea-wang-teng-chu, who has manifested prodigies of intelligence, abundantly satisfying the aspirations of the multitude, who rejoice in the fact that the actual and true embodiment of the Dalai Lama has appeared in the world, and that the Yellow Church has a ruler for its governance, an event most happy and auspicious, we are penetrated with joy on the perusal of the report that conveys this intelligence, and we do now especially bestow upon the aforesaid embodiment the following gifts, viz., one 'h\u00e2ta,' one image of the Buddha of Boundless Age, one bell clapper, and one rosary of coral beads, which we despatch to M\u00eang Pao for presentation. And we further bestow upon the Panshen Erdeni and the Chancellor respectively one 'h\u00e2ta' and one image of the Buddha of Boundless Age, which we similarly despatch for presentation. As regards the Panshen Erdeni, since he has performed the prescribed ceremonials and observed the allotted fasts for the embodiment, and inasmuch as the period of the enthronement of the Dalai Lama is still remote, it is right that he be directed to return to Ulterior Tibet. Let, therefore, the proper commands be issued for his observance. Let this decree be communicated for the information [of M\u00eang Pao and his colleague]. Respect this!\"\n\nIII. (Pr\u00e9cis).

Memorial drawn up the 8th day of the 6th month of the 21st year of Tao Kwang (25th July, 1841), reporting that, in conformity with the religious rules of Buddha, the embodiment of the Dalai Lama has assumed the ecclesiastic garb and tonsure, and that a religious name has been chosen for him.\n\nYour servants have received a communication from the Chancellor, to the effect that \"the embodiment of the Dalai Lama having now been determined by lot, to the delight and satisfaction of all, it became necessary to solicit the fulfilment of the established rules, and to request the Panshen Erdeni to invest him for the first time with the ecclesiastic garb, and to shave his head. Accordingly, on the 2nd of the 6th month I proceeded, with the entire body of hut'ukht'u, etc., and accompanied by the Panshen Erdeni, to the Sangha Monastery, where, having given notice to the Embodiment of the Dalai Lama, and arranged an altar facing the North-east,\\(^2\\) incense was offered, and the ceremonial of three genuflections, and nine prostrations was performed as a token of gratitude for the celestial favours [of His Majesty].

The gratitude felt in very truth by the Dalai Lama's Embodiment, and by us humble priests, is inexhaustible.\n\n\"As the period for the enthronement is still distant by several months, I would beg that a decision be formed on the subject whether the Panshen Erdeni shall be directed to remain here in reverent attendance or otherwise.\"\n\nOn receipt of the foregoing, Your servants find by reference to the records, that in 1822, after the tenth Dalai Lama had assumed the Monastic garb and tonsure, in reply to the Memorial reporting this occurrence, a Decree was received directing that, as the period for the enthronement was still remote, the Panshen Erdeni must, as a matter of course, be directed to return to Ulterior Tibet, which command was duly complied with. At present, inasmuch as the Panshen Erdeni has performed these duties, and the day of enthronement is still distant, it may be that there is no necessity for his further tarrying here, and that he may forthwith return to Ulterior Tibet; on which subject, Your Majesty's commands are reverently awaited.\n\nOn the 23rd day of the 8th month, a reply in the Vermilion Pencil was received, to the effect: \"Let it be as proposed. Respect this!\" (N.B.\u2014The above Memorial was originally written in Manchow).\n\nV. (Pr\u00e9cis). Memorial dated the 17th day of the 7th month of the 21st year of Tao Kwang (2nd September, 1841), with reference to the father of the new Dalai Lama.

Supplementary Memorial dated the 19th day of the\n11th month of the 21st year of Tao Kwang (31st December, 1841). In addition to the foregoing, we have to state that the Embodiment of the Dalai Lama having now his residence at the Jih-Kia Monastery (Si-gat-sze), to the eastward of Lassa, Your Servants have at frequent intervals despatched messengers to see him; and that from the time of his arrival until now, a period of several months, the climate of Lassa has perfectly agreed with him, and he has been in every respect strong and healthy. The persons attending him use all possible exertions in performing every necessary service. This we accordingly report for Your Majesty\u2019s information.\n\nVII. Memorial dated the 18th day of the 4th month of the 22nd year of Tao Kwang (27th May, 1842), reporting the conclusion of the ceremony of enthronement of the Embodiment of the Dalai Lama.\n\nOn the 21st of the 9th month of last year, Your Majesty\u2019s commands were reverently received, to the effect that \u201con the enthronement of the Embodiment of the Dalai Lama, let the Assistant High Commissioner Haip\u2019u, be substituted in place [of a previous appointment], to co-operate with M\u00eang Pao, and the Chang-chia Hut\u2019ukht\u2019u in witnessing the ceremony. Respect this!\u201d In obedience to these commands, Your servants proceeded on the 13th day of the 4th month in company with the Chang-chia Hut\u2019ukht\u2019u and the Chancellor, followed by their subordinate functionaries, the hut\u2019ukht\u2019u, lamas, and Tibetan officials, to the Monastery on Mount Jih-kia, for the purpose of escorting the Dalai Lama\u2019s Embodiment down the mountain to the town of Chih-ta-hwang-pu, on the east of Lassa, where his abode was temporarily established. Your Servants, in respectful conformity with the rules for attendance upon the Dalai Lama, appointed detachments of the Chinese garrison troops to form an encampment, and to discharge the duty of bodyguards during the two days he remained there. On the 15th, Your servants escorted the Embodiment to the Monastery at Mount\n\n---\n\n1 The Memorial here referred to is not given.\n2 This is the title of the highest dignitary of the Lamaist hierarchy at Peking, where he exercises the functions of a Metropolitan. He appears to have been deputed to attend the present ceremony. See Appendix D.\nPotala, where reverent prostrations were performed, and the ceremonial observances were fulfilled before the Sacred Effigy of Your Majesty's elevated ancestor, the Emperor Pure. On the 16th, Your servants reverently took the golden Scroll containing the Mandate bestowed by Your Majesty upon the Dalai Lama's Embodiment, together with the sable cape, the coral Court rosary, etc., and the sum of Ten thousand Taels in silver, being Your Majesty's donations, which they caused to be conveyed upon yellow platforms to the Monastery at Mount Potala, and deposited with devout care in due order in the Hall called Ta Tu Kang. The couch and pillows were then arranged upon the divan; and on the arrival of the Dalai Lama's Embodiment in the Hall, Your Servants and the secretary of the Chang-chia Hut'ukht'u, reverently read out the Golden Scroll, embodying Your Majesty's Mandate, to the perusal of which the Embodiment listened in a kneeling posture, facing toward the East. After the reading was concluded, he received with veneration the Imperial gifts, and performed the ceremonial of three genuflections and nine prostrations in the direction of the Imperial abode, thus testifying his respectful gratitude for the celestial favours. Having been invested with the garments conferred by Your Majesty, the Embodiment was supported to his seat upon the throne; whereupon the Chancellor, at the head of the Tibetan priesthood, intoned a chant of Dharani formulas, invoking auspicious fortune. All the hut'ukht'u and lamas having performed obeisances, a great banquet was opened, and the ceremonial of enthronement was thus brought to a close. The day was attended by the utmost fine weather, and everything passed off auspiciously and well, to the universal delight of the entire body of clergy and laity of Lassa. This we accordingly bring to Your Majesty's knowledge; and in addition we have to state, that as the Embodiment of the Dalai Lama has now been enthroned, it is proper, in conformity with the existing rules, to cease henceforth from using the word \"Embodiment.\" This we accordingly append, and respectfully bring before Your Majesty's Notice.\n\nOn the 4th day of the 7th month, a reply in the Vermilion\nPencil was received: \"Be it as proposed. Respect this!\" (N.B.\u2014The above Memorial was originally written in Manchow).\n\nVIII. Memorial dated the 8th day of the 10th month of the 23rd year of Tao Kwang (29th November, 1843), reporting particulars with reference to the selection of Principal and Assistant Preceptors for the Dalai Lama, to instruct him in the scriptures upon which the Sacred Glance is besought.\n\nPremising that on the last Dalai Lama's installation, a Principal and an Assistant Preceptor were appointed for the furtherance of his instruction and mental development, we have to report that we have been presented with a petition by the Kopulun, and the entire body of superior clergy (Khanpu), to the effect that \"the Dalai Lama is now advancing in age, and manifests an intelligence and a quickness of perception that are altogether unusual; and that it is obviously necessary to appoint an erudite preceptor for his daily and nightly instruction, to the end that he may become thoroughly versed in the Scriptures, and be a worthy head to the Yellow Church. In view of the fact that the office of Principal Preceptor to the last Dalai Lama in the line of descent, was filled by the Chancellor K\u00ea-l\u00ea-tan-si-leu-t'u-sa-ma-ti Bakhshi, the Kopulun and Khanpu respectfully solicit that he may now be appointed Principal Preceptor to the Dalai Lama.\" We have further received a despatch from the Chancellor to the following effect:\n\n\"The humble priest on whom the Celestial favour has bestowed the office of Comptroller of Councils, has no other duty than that of using all his endeavours toward the fulfilment of his trust; but, inasmuch as the Dalai Lama is now advancing in age, it is necessary, with a view to advantageous results, that selection be made of a tutor profoundly versed in the religious writings in the person of a lama, enjoying the distinction of rank Imperially conferred, who shall devote himself wholly to the duties of instruction. Having made careful research among the whole body of lamas in Tibet, no more fitting choice is found than that of the lama Lung-mei-\nki\u00fch-kieh, whose official title is Lo-pu-tsang L\u00eang-chu-pu, at present sixty-two years of age, a profound adept in the religious writings, and of unblemished character, and worthy of the post of preceptor to the Dalai Lama.\"\n\nThe Chancellor requesting that this representation may be laid before Your Majesty, Your servants have hereupon to state that on reference to the records, they find that the instructor of the Dalai Lama, tenth in succession, was the Chancellor himself, who filled the post of preceptor, in addition to his other duties; and that, fearing lest his occupation as Comptroller of Councils might entail a loss of time in the Dalai Lama's studies, selection was made of K\u00ea-l\u00ea-tan-kiu-ch'ih-pa-a-wang-nien-cha and the grandee the Pan-ti-ta,\\(^1\\) as his Assistants. If, as the Kopulun and Khanpu request, the Chancellor be again appointed Preceptor in Chief, it is to be feared that the Dalai Lama's studies cannot be conducted entirely as they ought. We find that K\u00ea-l\u00ea-tan-kiu-ch'ih-pa-a-wang-nien-cha, who discharged the duty of preceptor to the former Dalai Lama in a very admirable manner, has long since passed out of employ (i.e. deceased); but that there remains at present the grandee Kia-mu-pa-l\u00ea-i-hi-tan-pei-chia-mu-tso, who, in consequence of his efficiency in instructing the tenth Dalai Lama in the religious writings, was graciously advanced from the dignity of Pan-ti-ta to the title of Nomun 'Han.\\(^2\\) He is now leading a monastic life in his own monastery at Lassa, and is not occupied with any public business. He is worthy of receiving the appointment to repair to Mount Potala, and to act with the lama Lung-me\u00ef-ki\u00fch-kieh, who has been selected by the Chancellor for the duties of preceptor. Loss of time in the prosecution of the necessary studies may by this means be avoided. The motive influencing Your servants is the desire to devote every care to the matter of instruction; and they reverently submit to Your Majesty's decision the question whether the Nomun 'Han, who distinguished himself by the efficiency of his\n\n\\(^1\\) See infrd.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Appendix C. The title Pan-ti-ta appears to be identical with the Indian Pandit.\neducation of the former Dalai Lama, may be appointed Preceptor in chief, and the lama Lung-mei-ki\u00fch-kieh as Assistant Preceptor, to the Dalai Lama.\n\nOn the 17th day of the 11th month of the 23rd year of Tao Kwang (6th January, 1844), the Cabinet received the following Decree:\n\n\"M\u00eang Pao and his colleague memorialize concerning the selection of Principal and Assistant Preceptors for the Dalai Lama. Let the request contained in their Memorial be complied with. Respect this!\"\n\nIX. (Pr\u00e9cis). Memorial dated the 7th day of the 4th month of the 24th year of Tao Kwang (23rd May, 1844), stating that the Nomun 'Han, recently appointed Preceptor in chief to the Dalai Lama, perfected his repose\\(^1\\) in consequence of a sickness on the 27th day of the 3rd month\u2014and forwarding the Chancellor's suggestion that the Assistant Preceptor be advanced to the vacant post as Chief Preceptor, with the addition, in accordance with precedent, of the honorary title of Pan-ti-ta, or, should his Majesty see fit, of the dignity of Nomun 'Han. This suggestion they do not themselves support, thinking it premature to confer titles of such eminence, before putting the preceptor's abilities to the test of experience, and they request instructions on this point.\n\n* * * No reply to the above Memorial is recorded; and with it the series relating to the Dalai Lama is brought to an abrupt termination.\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\nA. THE DALAI LAMA.\n\nThe documents translated above, exhibit in its entirety, the strange process of selecting, installing, and educating for his duties the pontiff, in whose supernatural character and divine commission,\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. died. The above term is invariably applied to the decease of members of the Buddhist hierarchy.\nimplicit faith is reposed by the rude, superstitious populations of Tibet and Mongolia; but, simply recounting as they do, a series of events from the point of view of every-day official business, they naturally contain no references elucidative of the history of the past. It is necessary, therefore, to look elsewhere for explanations of the complex hierarchical system to which an entire ethnological group has been enslaved within a comparatively recent period. For the European reader, fortunately, a full and authentic light has already been thrown upon the Lamaistic constitution in the work of Carl Friedrich Koeppen (Die Lamaische Hierarchie und Kirche, Berlin, 1859), where the results of past and contemporary research are digested to form an exceedingly lucid survey of Tibetan history; whilst, to the student of Chinese, sources of more direct information are naturally available. Modern Chinese works exist, which, not yet having met with translators, were beyond the reach of even Koeppen's comprehensive research; and among these, the most prominent is the Sheng Wu Ki, or History of the Campaigns of the Reigning Dynasty,\u2014a most valuable record of the wars and foreign policy in general of the Manchow sovereigns, from their first encroachments on the Chinese Empire, up to the first decades of the present century. The author, a functionary serving at Peking during the reign of Tao Kwang, had free access to the various State Paper Offices, and (with of course a due regard for the glory of his Imperial masters) digested the knowledge thus acquired into a record which forms in fact\u2014with one partial exception\u2014the only published Chinese history of the events of the last two centuries. Book V. of this work is wholly occupied by the affairs of Tibet, covering precisely the same ground as is traversed by Koeppen's survey, and principally based on the writings\u2014published or private\u2014of Manchow and Chinese functionaries, who have held office in Mongolia or Tibet. A brief resum\u00e9 of the leading facts in connection with the Lamaist hierarchy, gathered from the sources indicated above, will serve to explain the proceedings reported by the Imperial Commissioners to their Sovereign in 1841-43.\n\nThe rise of the double Papacy by means of which Tibet has been governed, and the unruly Mongol tribes have been kept under control by two successive Chinese dynasties, dates only from the fifteenth century of our era, and emanates directly from one of those remarkable reformers, which the times in their fulness seem now and then to produce at the moment when a leader only is\nlacking for the success of a movement already brought about by apparently spontaneous growth. The Buddhism that had been practised for about one thousand years in Tibet and the adjacent territories, was, in the fourteenth century of our era, profoundly tainted with both the Sivaism of post-Buddhist ages in India, and the necromantic superstitions which were probably indigenous in Tibet before the conversion of its people to \"the Perfect Law;\" and both the people and their native sovereigns were dominated by a hereditary priesthood, who had engrafted on the Buddhist doctrines of monasticism and celibacy a supplementary religious code in which Brahminical ideas were distinctly apparent. From their seat of government, the members of this priesthood are commonly denominated the Ssakia hierarchy. High favour was manifested toward this influential body of ecclesiastics, who held in their hand the government of Tibet, by the Mongol conquerors of China, and by means of their support, it came to pass that the heirs of Genghis Khan succeeded in reducing that kingdom to a feudal dependancy of their own. But the influence of the hereditary sacerdotal caste did not long survive the downfall of the Y\u00fcan dynasty in China, which was accomplished in A.D., 1367. Early in the reign of the second sovereign of the Ming dynasty, an apostle of reform, advocating with alleged supernatural sanction a return to the earlier and purer doctrines of the Buddhist faith, appeared in the person of Tsungk'aba, a young priest issuing from an obscure monastery on the confines of China and Tibet. All that it is essential to record here concerning this Oriental Luther, is the fact of his marvellous, almost instantaneous, and as yet quite unexplained success, coupled with the fact that during his own lifetime, he witnessed the complete overthrow of the influence of the Ssakia priesthood, and the substitution of his own doctrines for the corrupt theocracy hitherto in vogue. The symbol which he adopted at the outset of his career as the rallying-point for his supporters, was the return to the use of a yellow garb\u2014the colour supposed to have been instituted by Buddha himself, for his followers' attire\u2014in lieu of the red habiliments in which the Ssakia priesthood were clothed; and from this circumstance the opposing sects have since his day been known by the names of the \"Red\" and \"Yellow\" Churches, distinctions which are still maintained, inasmuch as although greatly in the minority, and stripped of almost all their influence, the adherents of the older Ssakia system still hold their ground,\nneither favoured nor persecuted, in Tibet and a portion of Mongolia. The question has been more than once debated, whether Tsungk'aba, in devising his institutions and reforms for the Tibetan religion, was indebted to the advice of Nestorian or Romish missionaries; and in the absence of specific proof on either side, the controversy must remain an open one. The striking similarity between the doctrines of spiritual supremacy exerted by the Dalai Lama and his co-regent, the Panshen Erdeni, over the Buddhist faithful, and the similar theory of the Pope's universal dominion, coupled with the renewed enforcement of strict celibacy, and numerous remarkable resemblances between the accessories of the Lamaist ceremonial and those of the Roman Church, are so many arguments in favour of the supposed influence of one or more of the European missionaries, who were undoubtedly to be found in Central Asia during the period of Tsungk'aba's career. The Abb\u00e9 Huc, in his more or less mythical account of his journey to Tibet, gives indeed a detailed story, existing in no other known work, of \"a foreigner, with a prominent nose and brilliant eyes,\" who is stated to have been Tsungk'aba's religious instructor; but as the authenticity of the Abb\u00e9's writings is on a level with that of Mendez Pinto's or Psalmanazar's relations, the legend has no independent weight.\n\nWhat is chiefly important to note here, is the fact that grounds for suspicion strongly suggest themselves as to the point whether Tsungk'aba was not influenced and supported by Chinese statecraft, and was not, in fact, an instrument of the founders of the Ming dynasty in fastening their control upon Tibet by spiritual contrivances. There can be no doubt that the whole course of his reforms tended to that end, by breaking the temporal power of the hereditary Tibetan sovereigns, and notably also by so dividing the spiritual government as to facilitate external predominance; nor is it, *prima facie*, unlikely that in rendering such a service to the Chinese state, the religious reformer was acting in secret connection with the victorious supplanters of the Mongol ascendancy, among the most devoted supporters of which were the chiefs of the sect Tsungk'aba laboured to overthrow.\n\nTwo different periods are assigned to the lifetime of the reformer. According to Koeppen, who quotes the authority of A.\n\nim J. 1417 geboren sei, beruht auf einer Verwechslung von dessen Geburts-und Todesjahr, was schon daraus erheilt, dass ebendasselbst die Geburt des ersten Dalai Lama ins J. 1391 gesetzt wird, wonach der J\u00fcnger 25 Jahre \u00e4lter gewesen w\u00e4re als der Lehrer.\"\nCsoma and Klaproth (though he admits a doubt on the subject), Tsungk'aba died in 1417; but the Chinese author referred to above states with apparent precision, that \"Tsungk'aba (otherwise called Lo-p-tsang-chak'-ba), was born at Si Ning, in the 15th year of the reign of Yung Lo (A.D. 1417), and perfected his repose (i.e. died) in the 14th year of Ch'\u00eang Hwa (A.D. 1478).\" It matters little, however, as regards the present inquiry, whether the first or the last of the two dates assigned be the correct one; the essential point to dwell upon is the fact that to Tsungk'aba's two principal disciples was bequeathed the reformer's influence at his decease; and that his sectaries, how or at what precise period is imperfectly known, accepted the belief that the soul of Tsungk'aba himself passed after death into the elder of the two, and that the imperishable spirits of both are born and reborn again into the world in a perpetual succession. In the words of the Chinese chronicler: \"Tsungk'aba laid commands upon his two chief disciples, enjoining upon them that they should be born again, generation after generation, as 'hubil'han, to practise the doctrines of the Great Conveyance (Ta Ch'\u00eang, Sanskr. Mah\u00e2y\u00e2na, the esoteric form of Buddhism). The word 'hubil'han signifies in Chinese hua sh\u00ean (i.e. transformed body, transformation, re-embodiment). The two disciples were called respectively Dalai Lama and Panshen Lama. Lama, being interpreted, signifies 'unsurpassed.'\"\n\nTo trace the genealogy of the Dalai Lamas who have perpetuated the succession since Tsungk'aba's period, is a task that cannot be attempted here. It has already been partially achieved with Koeppen, whose list of the seven hierarchs who had reigned up to the beginning of this century, agrees in the main with the statements made by the author of the Sh\u00e9ng Wu Ki; but it must be observed that the year 1746 introduced a notable change in the constitution of the Tibetan hierarchy, and in the position of its heads. Up to that period, a native sovereign, owning fealty to the Emperors of China, still held a more or less nominal sway over Tibet; but a sanguinary revolt against Chinese domination, which broke out in the early years of the Emperor Kien Lung's reign, led to the complete subjugation of the country, to the abolition of the rank of Gialbo or sovereign, and to the placing of the entire\n\n---\n\n1 Koeppen, p. 108, footnote: S. die chronologischen Tafeln bei A. Csoma, l. c. 186, und Klaproth, 'Fragments Bouddhiques,' p. 9. Die Angabe des Hieroliticonus Hilarion in den Arbeiten der russischen Mission, I. 315, dass bTsongkhapa\ngovernment in the hands of the Dalai Lama, assisted by four ministers, to be nominated by himself, under the supreme control of two Chinese Commissioners or Residents, who became in reality the Regents of Tibet. Prior to this period, the re-embodiment of the Dalai Lama after each decease, appears to have been determined in accordance with vague report alone, and a wide door was opened to intrigue and strife of the most dangerous description; but the sagacious Government of Kien Lung ordained that thenceforward the selection of the Embodiment should be decided by lot, and the power of nomination to the honour of competing at so singular a trial, was left virtually in the hands of the Imperial Commissioners. As a matter of course, these dignified and eclectic functionaries delegate, as is seen in the translations above, to native priests the Mumbo-Jumbo work of discovering (or inventing) qualifications on the part of the infant candidates. For, by another convenient regulation in Tsungk'aba's system, the re-embodiment of each deceased pontiff manifests itself in the person of a child of tender age, so that the major portion of each reign is under ordinary circumstances passed in a state of tutelage.\n\nEnough has probably been set forth in the foregoing summary, to explain the system which involves such action as that described in the reports of the Imperial Commissioner Meng Pao. The works of Koeppen and of other well known writers, comprise those fuller particulars which it is unnecessary to recapitulate here. It should, however, be stated that whilst the Dalai Lama of the day is held to be the reimpersonation of Tsungk'aba's chief disciple, and as such to inherit the principal spiritual, as well as secular authority derived through the reformer from Buddha, yet his colleague the Panshen Lama, in virtue both of his supposed divine personality, and of his complete abstraction from contact with worldly affairs, is believed to enjoy a character more purely sacred than that which the Dalai Lama fills. The one, in fact, to seek a parallel in our own history, is \"Head of the Church,\" the other is \"Primate.\"\n\nThe meaning of the title \"Dalai\" is simply Ocean; this term having been adopted, probably, to convey the idea of vastness and grandeur. The entire title of the Dalai Lama is expressed in Mongolian, says Koeppen, by the words Cho-tsun Giamthso Rin-po-che, signifying the \"Venerable Ocean Treasure.\"\n\n1 Beside being the reembodiment of Tsungk'aba's second disciple, the Panshen Erdeni is popularly held to be an incarnation of the Bodhisattwa Manjusri.\nB. THE PANSHEN ERDENI.\n\nJoint heir with the Dalai Lama of the spiritual inheritance derived from Tsungk'aba, the Panshen Erdeni is believed by the Tibetans to be worthy of the higher degree of adoration, his office and functions being the less contaminated by worldly influences. To him is confided the maintenance of the purity of religious doctrine, as to the Dalai Lama is attributed the temporal governance of the Tibetan realm. His title signifies \"The Precious Teacher\" (Panshen, or Banshen, = the Indian Pandita, and Erdeni in Mongolian, or Rin-po-che in Tibetan, being the equivalent of Treasure). The origin of his title, and the various dogmas concerning the being who is incarnate in his personality, are fully discussed by Koeppen. His residence is at Tashi-Lumbo, or the Mountain of Good Fortune, and it was here that, on the 4th December, 1783, Lieutenant Samuel Turner was favoured with an audience by the same Panshen Erdeni (at that time an infant just installed), who, as a man of sixty, figures in the Memorials translated above, as conducting the consecration of the Dalai Lama. The following extracts from Turner's account of his interview usefully illustrate the Chinese documents relating to the Dalai Lama:\n\n\"On the 4th, in the morning, I was allowed to visit Teshoo Lama, and I found him placed in great form upon his Musnud; on the left side stood his father and mother, on the other the officer particularly appointed to wait upon his person. The Musnud is a fabric of silk cushions piled one upon the other, until the seat is elevated to the height of four feet from the floor; an embroidered silk covered the top, and the sides were decorated with pieces of silk of various colours, suspended from the upper edge and hanging down. I advanced, and, as is the custom, presented a white pelong handkerchief, and delivered into the Lama's hands the Governor's presents of a string of pearls and coral, while the other things were set down before him. Having performed the ceremony of the exchange of handkerchiefs with his father and mother, we took our seats on the right of Teshoo Lama . . . . [On the delivery of a speech of congratulations in the name of the Governor General of Bengal] the little creature turned, looking steadfastly towards me with the appearance of much attention while I spoke, and nodded with repeated, but slow movements of the head, as though he understood and approved every word, but could not utter a reply.\"\nThe parents, who stood by all the time, eyed their son with a look of affection, and a smile expressive of heartfelt joy at the propriety of the young Lama's conduct. His whole regard was turned to us; he was silent and sedate, never once looking towards his parents, as if under their influence at the time; and with whatever pains his manners may have been formed so correct, yet I must own his behaviour on this occasion appeared perfectly natural and spontaneous, and not directed by any action or sign of authority. Teshoo Lama is at this time about 18 months of age. He did not speak a word, but made most expressive signs, and conducted himself with astonishing dignity and decorum.\"\n\nThe foregoing reminiscences afford a very curious parallel to the descriptions given by the Chinese Resident of the demeanour and intelligence of the Dalai Lama elect; and, in the absence of such knowledge as only close and unprejudiced observation can elicit it is not easy to conjecture by what means a tender infant is trained to such precocious dignity.\n\nKoeppen laments that no list of the Panshen Erdeni Lamas has been rendered accessible in Europe; and I regret that on this occasion, I have only an imperfect catalogue to offer. In the Chinese work already quoted, the list is set forth as follows\u2014the names being given in Chinese transcription, which is followed as closely as possible, with due regard to the Tibetan sounds, in so far as they are known:\n\nNo. 1. K'ai-chup Kih-leukh baltsang.\n,, 2. Name unknown.\n,, 3. Ditto.\n,, 4. Lobtsang chui-ki giamts'o.\n,, 5. Lobtsang i-shi. Deceased 1737.\n,, 6. Lobtsang pa-tan-i-shi. Enthroned 1743.\n\nThe list closes with No. 6, who appears to have been succeeded by the infant to whom Lieutenant Turner was introduced.\n\nC. The Nom\u00ean 'Han.\n\nThe title Nom\u00ean 'Han (or Khan), equivalent to Dharma-R\u00e2ja, or Prince of the Religious Law, has been repeatedly bestowed in the course of Tibetan history, on laymen who have distinguished themselves by services to the Church; but, with other prerogatives, the\nright of conferring this honour has been monopolized by the Chinese Emperors since Kien Lung's conquests, and appears to have lost much of its former importance. Huc, in his \"Travels in Tartary and Tibet,\" Vol. ii., chapter 5, gives an account which seems almost purely imaginary of the career and downfall of the personage referred to under this name in the above Memorials. He represents the Nom\u00ean 'Han of 1841-3, as a wily intriguer, animated by an unlimited ambition, and as having plotted the death by violent means of the young Dalai Lama, whose three predecessors he had successively got rid of by one form or another of assassination. His banishment from Lassa by order of the Emperor Tao Kwang, is further recounted as having taken place in 1844, after a determined but successful outbreak in his favour on the part of the priesthood and people of Lassa. It is, however, inconceivable that had such an occurrence as this actually taken place, the Chinese Resident would be found despatching, and subsequently making public a Memorial such as No. 9 in the above series, where the death of the Nom\u00ean 'Han is noted, and his successor designated. The story told by Huc is probably\u2014if not a simple invention\u2014the distorted exaggeration of some tale picked up by the Abb\u00e9 from the Mongols, among whom he accumulated the groundwork of his legends relating to Tibet.\n\nD. The Hut'ukht'u.\n\nAn important section of the Lamaist hierarchy is constituted by the hut'ukht'u, or saints, who repeat on a lower scale, in most particulars, the phenomena and prerogatives attending the Dalai and Panshen Lamas. Like their spiritual chiefs, the hut'ukht'u are held to be 'hubil'han or re-embodiments, and in their several localities they are venerated with slavish adoration. The Sh\u00eang Wu Ki gives one hundred and sixty as the total number of lamas having the gift of re-embodiment, whose names are registered by the Colonial Board at Peking, and enumerates them as follows, viz.: In Tibet, 18 called hut'ukht'u, and 12 called shaburung; Mongolia (North), 19; Mongolia (South), 57; Kokonor, 35; Chiamdo and the Tibetan portion of Sze-ch'wan, 5; Peking, 14. For the whole of these personages, excepting the Nom\u00ean 'Han of Kokonor (whose office is hereditary), the Imperial system of drawing lots is enforced when a new embodiment is declared to have taken place.\nThe title *hut'ukht'u* is not explained by the Chinese author, but it may be conjectured to have some connection with the Mongol word *hutukh',* blessing.\n\nThe *Chang-chia Hut'ukht'u,* who resides at Peking as a Lamaist metropolitan for the tribes of Inner Mongolia, dates his spiritual descent from a dignitary who was called to Peking during the reign of K'ang Hi, probably about A.D. 1690-1700, and intrusted with the Emperor's confidence as his religious Vice-gerent.\nKhuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha, or \"Lesser Readings,\" is one of the books of the Buddhist Scriptures. It is the first of the fifteen divisions of Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya, and immediately precedes Dhammapada. The text which I have adopted is that of a manuscript written and collated for me by a Singhalese priest of great learning. I have compared with it the Burmese manuscript belonging to the collection presented by Sir A. Phayre to the India Office Library. This, however, I found to contain numerous clerical and other errors, and it failed to supply me with a single corrected reading.\n\nKhuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha possesses a high authority in Ceylon. It is quoted in the Commentaries of Buddhaghosa, many of the examples in Sandhi Kappa and other grammatical works are drawn from it, and seven of its nine chapters are included in the course of homilies read at the Buddhist ceremony of Pirit. Three of the s\u016btras, viz., Ma\u1e45gala Sutta, Ratana Sutta, and Metta Sutta recur in Sutta Nip\u0101ta, the fifth division of Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya, and Paramattha Jotik\u00e1, Buddhaghosa's commentary on Sutta Nip\u0101ta, is also looked upon as the commentary of Khuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha.\n\nKhuddaka P\u0101\u1e6dha takes its name from its first four texts, which are very brief, and are termed P\u0101\u1e6dhas in contradistinction to the S\u016btras, or sermons, which follow. The four P\u0101\u1e6dhas, and the Ma\u1e45gala, Ratana and Metta S\u016btras, are translated by Gogerly in his version of Pirit in the \"Ceylon Friend\" (June, July, and August, 1839).\nPRAISE BE TO THE BLESSED ONE, THE HOLY ONE, THE AUTHOR OF ALL TRUTH.\n\n1.\n\nThe Three Refuges.\n\nI put my trust in Buddha,\nI put my trust in the Law,\nI put my trust in the Church.\nAgain I put my trust in Buddha,\nAgain I put my trust in the Law,\nAgain I put my trust in the Church.\nOnce more I put my trust in Buddha,\nOnce more I put my trust in the Law,\nOnce more I put my trust in the Church.\n\n2.\n\nThe Ten Laws of the Priesthood.\n\n1.

And when the night was far advanced a certain radiant celestial being, illuminating the whole of Jetavana, approached the Blessed One, and saluted him and stood aside. And standing aside addressed him with this verse,\u2014\n2. Bah\u00fa dev\u00e1 manuss\u00e1 ca ma\u1e45gal\u00e1ni acintayum\n   \u0100kankham\u00e1n\u0101 sotth\u00e1nam.

The Saran\u00e1gamana occupies in the Buddhist system a similar\nplace to that which the Creed holds in the Christian. Koeppen says\nof it, \"This confession of faith is among the Southern Buddhists the\nbest known and commonest form of prayer\" (Rel. des Buddha, vol.\ni., p. 444). In the P\u00faral\u00e1sasutta section of Paramattha Jotik\u00e1\nBuddhaghosa speaks of \"this glorious hymn\" as the foundation of\nthe Three Pit\u00e1kas:\u2014Ettha bhagav\u00e1 paramatthavod\u00e1nam tinnam\npi\u1e6dak\u00e1nam \u00e1dibh\u00fatam paramattham brahma\u00f1ehi sabbabuddhehi pak\u00e1-\ns\u00edtam athasampannam bya\u00f1janasampanna\u00f1 ca buddham saranam\ngacch\u00e1mi dhammam saranam gacch\u00e1mi sa\u1e45gham saranam gacch\u00e1m\u00edti\nimam ariyam s\u00e1vittim sandh\u00e1ya pucchati.\n\nII. Sikkh\u00e1pada is thus defined in Paramattha Jotik\u00e1, Sikkhitabb\u00e1\nti sikkh\u00e1, pajjate anen\u00e1ti padam, sikkh\u00e1ya padam sikkhapadam, sik-\nkh\u00e1ya adhigam\u00fap\u00e1yo ti attho. Here the word Pada does not mean\n\"verse,\" it has rather the signification of \"means\" or cause, as is\nclear from the above explanation of Buddhaghosa, and from such\nexpressions as sikkh\u00e1ya pa\u00f1ca pad\u00e1ni sam\u00e1diy\u00e1mi, \"I take upon\nmyself the five means of moral training\" (see Fausb. Dham. p. 97).\nPada is never used in the religious books in the sense of \"verse.\"\nAmong the nine meanings attributed to it in Abhidh\u00e1na Pad\u00edpik\u00e1\n(p. 819) that of verse is not given. In the words athapada and\ndhammapada in verses 100 and 102 of Fausb\u00f6ll's Dhammapada the\nmeaning is probably \"word\" or \"sentence,\" and in g\u00e1th\u00e1pada (v.\n181) the word Pada adds nothing to the sense.\n\nVeraman\u00ed, \"abstinence,\" from the root \u0935\u0930\u094d with \u0928\u093f. Veraman\u00ed\nis in the nom. case in apposition with sikkh\u00e1padam.\n\nSur\u00e1merayama\u00f1ja. Sur\u00e1 means \"fermented liquor,\" meraya,\n\"distilled liquor,\" and majja (Sansk. \u092e\u091c\u094d\u091c\u093e) is a generic term applied\nto all intoxicating drinks. Pam\u00e1da does not here mean \"intoxica-\n\nvol. iv.\u2014[NEW ARRIVES.]\ntion.\u201d It generally has the sense of \u201csloth\u201d (Dhammapada 51) or \u201ccarelessness\u201d (Dh. 34). But it is sometimes used in a mere technical sense, almost equivalent to \u201csin\u201d or \u201ctemptation,\u201d and partaking of the meaning of both those words. In Sigalovadassutta we have, Cha kho \u2019me \u00e1dinav\u00e1 j\u00e1tappam\u00e1datth\u00e1n\u0101nuyoge, \u201cthere are six evils in being addicted to the sin of gambling.\u201d Observe also the use of Pamatta in v. 9 of Ratana Sutta (p. 8 of this article). In modern Sinhalese the word Pram\u00e1da, borrowed from the Sanskrit, is used almost exclusively in the sense of \u201cdelay.\u201d\n\nTh\u00e1na. This word often occurs as the latter part of a compound, and is then generally rendered in the commentaries by k\u00e1ra\u1e47am, as it is in this passage. It resembles the word Pada in the vagueness of meaning with which it is used in composition, and like Pada sometimes adds little or nothing to the meaning of the compound of which it forms a part. Thus we have ka\u1e45kh\u00e1th\u00e1na\u1e41, \u201ca doubt,\u201d or \u201ca doubtful point,\u201d and in such words as vibh\u00fasanath\u00e1na there is little definite meaning to be attached to the word Th\u00e1na. In the 19th verse of Abhid. Pad\u00edpik\u00e1, Th\u00e1na and Pada are both given as synonyms of k\u00e1ra\u1e47a.\n\nVis\u00faka. s. \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0941\u0915. The Sinhalese Sanna or scholium of Khuddakap\u00e1tha explains this word by Visulu, which Clough in his Dictionary translates \u201cgrimace, gesture, theatrical exhibition.\u201d Gogerly translates Vis\u00faka in this passage by \u201ctheatrical representations,\u201d and Hardy by \u201cmasks\u201d (East. Mon. p. 24). In a passage which occurs near the beginning of Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta, vis\u00fakadassana appears to be used in the sense of \u201cwordly amusement\u201d: Te eva-r\u00fapam vis\u00fakadassanam anuyutt\u00e1 viharanti, seyyath\u00eddam, naccam g\u00edtam v\u00e1ditam pekkham akkh\u00e1tam, etc., where twenty-eight sorts of spectacles are enumerated and spoken of as unworthy of the right-minded priest of Buddha. The passage is translated by Gogerly in the Journal Ceylon As. Soc. No. 2, p. 23, and vis\u00fakadassana rendered \u201cpublic spectacles.\u201d\n\nIII. The thirty-two Ak\u00e1ras are thus translated by Hardy, at page 400 of his Manual of Buddhism: \u201cKes\u00e1 \u2018hair of the head,\u2019 lom\u00e1 \u2018hair of the body,\u2019 nakh\u00e1 \u2018nails,\u2019 dant\u00e1 \u2018teeth,\u2019 taco \u2018skin,\u2019 mam-sam \u2018flesh,\u2019 nah\u00e1ru \u2018veins,\u2019 at\u1e6dh\u00ed \u2018bones,\u2019 at\u1e6dhimi\u00f1j\u00e1 \u2018marrow,\u2019 vakkam \u2018kidneys,\u2019 hadayam \u2018heart,\u2019 yakanam \u2018liver,\u2019 kilomakam \u2018abdomen,\u2019 pihakam \u2018spleen,\u2019 paph\u00e1sam \u2018lungs,\u2019 antam \u2018intestines,\u2019 antagu\u1e47am \u2018lower intestines,\u2019 udariyam \u2018stomach,\u2019 kar\u1e63am \u2018faeces,\u2019 pittam \u2018bile,\u2019 semham \u2018phlegm,\u2019 pubbo \u2018pus,\u2019 lohitam \u2018blood,\u2019 sedo \u2018sweat,\u2019 medo \u2018fat,\u2019 assu \u2018tears,\u2019 vas\u00e1 \u2018serum,\u2019 khalo\n'saliva,' singh\u0101nik\u0101 'mucous,' lasik\u0101 'oil that lubricates the joints,' muttam 'urine,' matthake matthalungam 'brain.'\" Gogerly translates kes\u0101lom\u0101 by \"hair,\" and to make up the number of thirty-two strangely renders matthake matthalungam by \"the cranium, the brains.\"\n\nTaco. This form probably represents the Sanskrit nom. plur.\n\nNah\u0101ru, \"sinew,\" Sanak. Compare nah\u0101nam, \"bathing,\" S. \u0928\u093e\u0938.\n\nVakkam, S. \u0935\u0915\u094d\u0915\u092e\u094d. Kilomakam is translated by Gogerly \"womb,\" and this is also the rendering of the Singhalese scholiast. It is clearly the same word with \u0916\u0940\u0932\u0928\u094d, \"bladder.\" Medo, \u092e\u0947\u0926\u094b. Antam, \u0905\u0902\u0924\u092e\u094d.\n\nAnta\u1e45gam, probably \"mesentery,\" which is Gogerly's translation. The scholiast renders lasik\u0101 by \"marrow of the joints.\"\n\nIV. This P\u0101\u1e6dha is a collection of ten of the classifications of technical terms so frequently met with in the Buddhist writinga. The system of classification characterises the literature of the Hindus in a greater degree than that of any other people, but it is in the Buddhist philosophy that it has received its highest development. Indeed there is scarcely a branch of Buddhist teaching into which it has not been carried with an elaboration and detail perfectly astonishing. There can be little doubt that the great founder of Buddhism adopted the system of classification with the view of impressing his doctrines upon the memory of his followers, in an age when books were scarce, and reading and writing rare accomplishments.\n\nEka' n\u0101ma; for ekam n\u0101ma, m being elided for euphony in accordance with a rule of Sandhi given at page 14 of Clough's P\u0101li Grammar.\n\nNava sattavas\u0101.

This P\u00e1da contains nine syllables instead of eight, and the effect is to give strong emphasis to the sentence. Irregularities of this sort are of frequent occurrence in P\u00e1li verse. Fausb\u00f6ll has collected a large number of instances of a redundant syllable (Dh. p. 440), and cases of a deficient syllable sometimes (though rarely) present themselves. Vowels are frequently lengthened or shortened to suit the exigencies of metre, and the circumstance that in P\u00e1li external Sandhi is to a very great extent optional, gives to the poetical texts an apparent roughness and want of polish from which Sanskrit verse is almost wholly free. These metrical irregularities in the Canonical books are explained from a religious point of view in the following remarkable passage from Culla Sadda N\u00edti:\nBhagav\u00e1 pana vacan\u00e1nam garulahubh\u00e1van na ga\u1e47eti: bodhaneyy\u00e1nam pana ajjh\u00e1say\u00e1nulomato, dhammasabh\u00e1vam avilomento, tath\u00e1 tath\u00e1 dhammadesan\u00e1m niyamet\u00ed.

But some one may ask, Is the length or shortness of vowels a matter of no importance? And another may reply, Well, but if it is, how is it that the old schoolmen in their verses here and there go so far as to elide a letter altogether, for the sake of not violating the metre? The truth is that these are poetical licenses, and are called vowel changes when rhythm has to be preserved, and euphony where the metre has to be preserved. When it is necessary to observe the\nniceties of metre and of rhythm, then, and then only, does Buddha observe them: and this is what I meant when I said that Buddha makes no account of the length or shortness of vowels. And when he adheres to metre and rhythm he does so not as poets and men of letters do, because it is part of their profession to do it; but of the words which in the countless ages of his probation proceeded from the lotus of his blessed mouth, formed in accordance with his perfect literary knowledge, some are intended to preserve metre and rhythm, others are not so intended, and it is in the case of the former alone that he preserves metrical and rhetorical accuracy. For be it known that Buddha does not preserve the niceties of metre and rhythm out of a spirit of rivalry with others. If this work is written with the syllabic irregularity which characterises all our religious books, let me not be blamed on that account. For what says one of our commentaries:\n\n\"Our sovereign lord has declared salvation\nTo be in the spirit and not in the letter.\nTherefore let not the wise man delight in letters and syllables,\nBut let him fix his mind upon the sense.\"\n\nAnd again\u2014\n\n\"To preserve the meaning all this has been said:\nTherefore let the wise man hold fast the meaning and make light of the letter.\"\n\nIt may not be out of place to give here some account of Vuttodaya, a copy of which, accompanied by a Simhalese Sanna, I have found in the Library of the India Office. Vuttodaya (\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u094b\u0926\u092f) (the work of Sangharakkhita Thera) is the only original book on P\u00e1li prosody, though it has become the subject of several commentaries, three of which are in the Grimblot collection at Paris. It is based upon Sanskrit prosody, the terms of which it has adopted, and in some cases whole sentences are borrowed from Pingala and other authorities with no more alteration than is necessary when Sanskrit is translated into P\u00e1li.\n\nVuttodaya is of very moderate length, consisting of six short chapters, and is written partly in prose and partly in verse. The first chapter, which is entirely in verse, begins as follows:\n\n1. Nam' atthu janasant\u00e1natamasant\u00e1nabhedino\n   Dhammujjalantarucino munindod\u00e1tarocino\n\n2. Pingal\u00e1cariy\u00e1dhi chanda' yam uditam pur\u00e1\n   Suddham\u00e1gadhik\u00e1nan tam na s\u00e1dheti yathicchitam\n3. Tato magadhabh\u00e1s\u00e9ya mattava\u1e47\u1e47avibhedanam\n   Lakkhalakkhapasamyuttam pasannatthapadakkamam\n\n4. Idam vuttodayam n\u00e1ma lokiyacchandanissitam\n   \u00c1rabhissam \u00e1ham d\u00e1n\u00ed tesam sukhabuddhiy\u00e1.\n\n\"Praise be to the moon-like chief of sages, who shines with the brightness of Dhamma, who pierces the wide-spreading darkness of many men.\n\n\"The prosodies of Pingala Ac\u00e1rya and others are not composed in a manner satisfactory to the pure natives of Magadha. Accordingly, for their benefit and enlightenment, I now begin to compose in the Magadha language this Vuttodaya, a work adapted to popular [laukika, as opposed to Vedic, says the Sanna] prosody, divided into M\u00e1tr\u00e1 V\u1e5bitta and Var\u1e47a V\u1e5bitta, furnished with symbols and rules, and containing a succession of words of clear meaning.\n\nAfter this introduction the eight \"classes\" are enumerated as follows:\n\n5. Sabba-ga-l\u00e1 ma-n' \u00e1di-ga-lahu bh-y\u00e1 majjhanta-gur\u00fa ja-s\u00e1\n   Majjhanta-l\u00e1 ra-te-t' attha gan\u00e1 go-guru lo lahu\n\n6. Bha-ja-s\u00e1 sabba-ga-l\u00e1hu pa\u00f1c' ime santhit\u00e1 gan\u00e1\n   Ariy\u00e1dimhi vi\u00f1\u00f1eyy\u00e1 gan\u00f3 idha catukkalo.\n\n\"In this work be it known that the eight Ga\u1e47as are symbolised as follows: When all the three syllables are long the foot is called Ma; when all are short, Na; when the first is long, Bha; when the first is short, Ya; when the middle syllable is long, Ja; when the last is long, Sa; when the middle syllable is short, Ra; when the last is short, Ta. Ga stands for \"long,\" and La for \"short.\" The five classes, Bha, Ja, Sa, Ma, and Na, are found in the Ary\u00e1 metre and others of the same class. A Gapa consists of four Kal\u00e1s.\"\n\nThe remaining ten verses of this chapter are taken up with general rules and the definition of technical terms. In a note to verse 10; which defines Yati as Padasecho, the Sinhalese Sanna gives the rules of irregular Cessura. They are little more than a translation of Hal\u00e1yudha, the first line being,\n\nYati sabbattha p\u00e9dante vuttaddhe' va visesato.\n\nSeveral examples are given, as\n\nNam\u00e1mi siras\u00e1 c\u00e1mikaravappam tath\u00e1gatam,\nwhere the pause falls in the middle of a word.\n\nMunindam siras\u00e1 vand\u00e1m' anantamatim uttamam,\nwhen it occurs after external Sandhi.\n\nNam\u00e1mi siras\u00e1 sabbopam\u00e1titam tath\u00e1gatam,\nwhen it occurs after internal Sandhi.\nThe second chapter treats of M\u00e1tr\u00e1v\u1e5bitta (matt\u0101vuttiniddeso dutiyo), and gives the rules for the Ariy\u00e1, G\u012bti, Vet\u00e1l\u00ed, and Matt\u00e1samaka metres. Of Ariy\u00e1, the following varieties are described:\u2014Pathy\u00e1, Vipul\u00e1, Capal\u00e1, Mukhacapal\u00e1, and Jaghanacapal\u00e1. Of the G\u012bti metres the following are enumerated: G\u012bti, Upag\u012bti, Uggi\u1e6di, and Ariy\u00e1g\u012bti. This chapter and the third, fourth, and fifth are written almost entirely in prose.\n\nThe third chapter treats of Samav\u1e5bitta, and gives rules for seventeen metres, viz., G\u0101yatti, Unh\u00ed, Anu\u1e6d\u1e6dhubham, Brah\u0101\u1e6di, Panti, Tu\u1e6d\u1e6dhubham, Jagati, Atijagati, Sakkar\u00ed, Atisskkar\u00ed, A\u1e6d\u1e6dhi, Acea\u1e6d\u1e6dhi, Dhuti, Atidhuti, Kati, Pakati, \u0100kati. Under the heading Anush\u1e6dubh we have\n\nCitrpad\u00e1 yadi bh\u00e1 g\u00e1\nMo mo go go vijjumm\u00e1l\u00e1\nBha-ta-la-g\u00e1 m\u00e1navakam\nGa-l\u00e1 sam\u00e1n\u00edk\u00e1 ra-j\u00e1 ca\nPam\u00e1n\u00edk\u00e1 ja-r\u00e1 la-g\u00e1\nAnu\u1e6d\u1e6dhubham.\n\n\"When there are two dactyls followed by two long syllables the metre is called Citrapad\u00e1.\n\n\"When there are two molossi and two long syllables it is Vidyunm\u00e1l\u00e1.\n\n\"M\u00e1navaka when a dactyl is followed by an antibacchic, a short and a long syllable.\n\n\"Sam\u00e1n\u00ed when a long and a short are followed by a cretic and an amphibrach.\n\n\"Pram\u00e1n\u00ed when an amphibrach is followed by a cretic, a short and a long.\"\n\nChapters four and five give the rules of Ardhasamav\u1e5bitta and Vishamav\u1e5bitta respectively. The last chapter is entirely in verse. It treats of the six Pratyayas, and concludes with a few valedictory stanzas. The manuscript ends with the following words:\n\nIti sa\u1e45gharakkhitattherap\u00e1daviracite vuttodaye chandasi chap-paccayavibh\u00e1g\u00f3 n\u00e1ma chattho paricchedo. Vuttodayam samattam.\n\nThe following is Gogerly\u2019s translation of Mangala Sutta:\n\n\"Thus I heard: Buddha was residing at Jetawaney, the garden of Anathapindika, near \u015aawatti. At that time a certain god, in the middle of the night, illuminating the whole of Jetawaney with his splendour, approached Buddha, and having worshipped him, stood on one side of him, and spake to him this stanza:\n\u201c(God) Multitudes of gods and men, thinking what things are excellent, desire prosperity. Declare the things of superior excellence.\n\n\u201c(Budha) Not to serve the unwise, but to attend to the learned, and to present offerings to those worthy of homage; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo live in a religious neighbourhood, to have been a performer of virtuous actions, and to be established in the true faith; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo be well informed in religion, instructed in science, subject to discipline, and of pleasant speech; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo honour father and mother, to provide for wife and children, and to follow a sinless vocation; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo give alms, act virtuously, aid relatives, and lead a blameless life; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo be free from sin, to abstain from intoxicating drinks, and to persevere in virtue; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo be respectful, kind, contented, grateful, and to listen at proper times to religious instruction; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo be mild, subject to reproof, to have access to priests, and to converse with them on religious subjects; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cMortification, celibacy, the perception of the four great truths, and the ascertainment of Nirv\u0101na; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cTo have a mind unshaken by prosperity or adversity, inaccessible to sorrow, free from impurity, and tranquil; these are chief excellencies.\n\n\u201cThose who practise all these virtues, and are overcome by no evil, enjoy the perfection of happiness, and obtain the chief good.\u201d\n\nVI. Yam ki\u00f1ci, etc. This verse and verses 5 and 6 are translated at pages 86, 87, and 88 of D\u2019Alwis\u2019 P\u0101li Grammar.\n\nBuddhe. Literally, \u201cin Buddha.\u201d Buddhaghosa here explains Ratana by ratanabh\u0101vo.\n\nKhayam. The scholiast renders this word by r\u0101gakshaya, and makes it an adjective agreeing with Nibb\u0101nam understood.\n\nAmata\u1e41. This word is sometimes used as a name and sometimes as an epithet of Nirv\u0101na. The scholiast here treats it as an epithet, yad meaning yad nibb\u0101nam. The Commentaries say that Nirv\u0101na is called \u201cAmata,\u201d because birth, decay and death do not take place there.\n\nSam\u2019atthi. For samam atthi. See Clough\u2019s P\u0101li Grammar, p. 14.\n\nSatam. Sanskrit \u0938\u0924\u093e\u092e\u094d. There can be no doubt that the mean-\ning intended is \"praised by the good,\" and that eight men only are spoken of (viz. Magga\u1e6d\u1e6dha and Phala\u1e6d\u1e6dha in the four paths), but taking advantage of the fact that Satam also means \"a hundred,\" Buddhaghosa observes that Puggal\u0101 attha satam pasatth\u0101 may also be translated \"a hundred and eight praised individuals.\" This number is obtained by adding up the sub-divisions of the four paths (ekabijj\u012b, kola\u1e45kolo, etc.).\n\nCatt\u0101ri, etc. I have paraphrased this passage to make it read intelligibly. Gogerly translates it, \"Are there eight classes of men, in four divisions, praised by the holy?\" and D'Alwis', \"Are there eight beings who have been praised by the holy, they are four couples\" (P\u0101li Grammar, p. 89).\n\nPattipatt\u0101. Patt\u012b is S. \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0940, and Patta S. \u092a\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093e. The scholiast explains Patt\u012b by \"Arhatphala.\"\n\nVigayha. Sanskrit \u0935\u093f\u0917\u092f\u0939.\n\nSito. Sanskrit \u0938\u093f\u0924\u094b.\n\nBhusa. See Dham. v. 252. Gogerly translates this passage, \"they cannot by any allurements be brought eight times more into a state of being.\" The gloss of the scholiast is, \"However greatly they be delayed by the temptations of celestial rule, universal empire, etc., they will not again receive an eighth birth in a K\u0101maloka.\"\n\nAt\u1e6dhamam. See Hardy's East. Mon. p. 280.\n\nTay' assu. For tayo assu. Assu is a \"P\u0101dap\u016bra\u1e47a\" particle: it occurs at page 106 of D'Alwis' P\u0101li Gram. Ken' assu nivuto loko. The three evil \"states\" or \"qualities\" here mentioned are explained by Hardy in East. Mon. p. 289.\n\nSakk\u0101yadi\u1e6d\u1e6dhi. The Sanskrit equivalent is \u0938\u0915\u094d\u0915\u093e\u092f\u0926\u093f\u091f\u094d\u0920\u093f, and the term is fully explained by Bournouf (Introd. p. 263). Hardy's explanation is, \"The error which teaches I am, this is mine.\" Bournouf is undoubtedly right when he says that the first part of the compound is the participle Sat in its primary sense of \"being,\" \"existing.\" Gogerly, in this s\u016btra, translates Sakk\u0101yadi\u1e6d\u1e6dhi, \"looking for corporeal enjoyments,\" perhaps taking Sat in its secondary meaning of \"good.\" The scholiast's rendering is \"a wrong view of his body.\"\n\nS\u012blabbatan. Paramattha Jotik\u0101 explains this word to mean foolish rites foreign to Buddhism: Ito bahiddh\u0101 samanabr\u0101hma\u1e47\u0101nam s\u012bl\u0113na suddhivatena suddhiti evam\u0101disu \u0101gata\u1e41 gosflakukkur\u0101sl\u0101dikam s\u012blam govatakukkuravat\u0101nam ca vatam s\u012blabbatan ti vuccati. Tassa pahinatt\u0101 sabbam nissagiyapattik\u0101di amaratapam pahinam hoti. This is also implied in Hardy's explanation, East. Mon. p. 289, 2.\nSee Dhammapada 271, where the word is used in the opposite sense of \"Buddhist rites.\"\n\nAbhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101n\u0101ni. These are m\u0101tugha\u1e6da, pitugha\u1e6da, arahantagha\u1e6da, lohitoppe\u1e0da, sa\u1e45ghabheda, and an\u00f1atasatthu-uddesa. See Hardy, E. M. p. 37.\n\nVanappagumbe. Paramattha Jotik\u0101 says, Pal\u0101sehi pavuddho gumbo pagumbo. For Gumba see Abhidh\u0101n, 861. Par. Jot. says that vanappagumbe and phussitagge are nominatives. Another instance of this change is given in Clough's P\u0101li Grammar, p. 15, where it is referred to Sandhi.\n\nPhussitagge. Par. Jot. says, Phussit\u0101ni agg\u0101ni ass\u0101ti phussitaggo, sabbas\u0101kh\u0101su sanj\u0101tapuppho ti attho. Phussita is the Sanskrit \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0924, but the Sanskrit metre named \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093f\u0924\u093e\u092f\u093e appears in its P\u0101li form in Vuttodaya as Pupphitagg\u0101.\n\nParamam hit\u0101ya. The following is Buddhaghosa's commentary on v. 12: Evam etan khandh\u0101yatan\u0101dhi satipat\u1e6dh\u0101nasammappadh\u0101na\u1e41 disflasam\u0101dhikkhandh\u0101dihi v\u0101 n\u0101nappak\u0101rehi athappabhedapupphehi ativiya sassirikkatt\u0101 tath\u0101pamam nibb\u0101nag\u0101mim maggam d\u012bpanato nibb\u0101nag\u0101mipariyattidhammavaram n'eva l\u0101bhahetu na sakkar\u0101dihetu kevalam hi mah\u0101karu\u1e47\u0101ya abbhuss\u0101hitahadayo satt\u0101nam paramam hit\u0101ya adesayit\u012b. Paramahit\u0101y\u0101ti ettha ca g\u0101th\u0101bandhasukhattham anun\u0101siko ayam pan' attho paramahit\u0101ya nibb\u0101n\u0101ya adesayit\u012b. It is here asserted that Paramam hit\u0101ya is a compound, for Paramahit\u0101ya, with m inserted on account of the metre, and that this Paramahita is Nirv\u0101\u1e47a. Perhaps, however, Paramam might be taken as an adverb to Hit\u0101ya, or even as an adjective in agreement with Dhammavaram, so that we might translate, \"Supremely (or supreme) for the good of men.\" For the use of Hit\u0101ya in this sense see D'Alwis' P\u0101li Grammar, p. 112, Janat\u0101ya hit\u0101ya ettha, \"it would be for the good of the people,\" and Kuhn's Kacc. Spec. p. 28. Gogerly translates this verse, \"As the buds put forth in the forest during the first months of summer, even so are the glorious doctrines declared by Buddha most delightful to the perceiver of Nirv\u0101\u1e47a.\" The nominative to adesayi must be supplied from verse 13.\n\nKh\u012bnam. This verse refers to the order of Arahat, etc.\n\nPur\u0101\u1e47am. Kamman is understood. The scholiast's gloss is Atitak\u0101le ku\u00e7alaku\u00e7alakarma. Buddhaghosa has the following comment: Yam tam satt\u0101nam uppajjitv\u0101 niruddham pi pur\u0101\u1e47am atitabh\u0101vikam kammam ta\u00f1h\u0101snehassa appahinatt\u0101 pa\u1e6disandhi-\u0101haranasa\u1e41matthat\u0101ya akh\u012bnam yeva hoti tam pur\u0101\u1e47am kammam.

Ya\u00f1 ca nesam buddhapuj\u0101divasena id\u0101ni pavattam\u0101nam kamm\u0101m navan ti vuccati. \"Pur\u0101na Kamma is the old Karma, the Karma of former births, which remains undestroyed where there is non-exhaustion of the oil of human passion, where there is liability to a renewal of existence. But it is Kh\u012b\u1e47a, or destroyed, in those who by the attainment of final emancipation, by the drying up of the oil of human passion, are no longer liable to future existence, as a seed burnt by fire cannot germinate. And that Karma is called Nava, or new, which is now being accumulated by such works as the service of Buddha, etc.\"\n\nSambhavam. Pres. part. neut. Gogerly translates the verse thus: \"He whose former things (merit or demerit) are withered away shall have no reproduction; he who is fully free from the desire of future existence, his seed (of future existence) is withered away, and shall never again grow. This eminent person like a lamp shall be extinguished.\"\n\nBuddhaghosa says, Nibbant\u012bti vijjh\u0101yanti dh\u012br\u0101 ti yatisampann\u0101. Yath\u0101 'yam pad\u012bpo ti ayam pad\u012bpo viya. To explain Ayam he states that when Buddha delivered this sermon some lamps were burning in honour of the deities of the town, and one of them having burnt itself out he pointed to it when he said, \"like this lamp.\" Tasmin kira samaye nagaradevat\u0101nam p\u016bjatth\u0101ya jalitesu pad\u012bpesu eko pad\u012bpo vijjh\u0101yi. Tam dassento, \u0101ha yath\u0101 'yam pad\u012bpo.\n\nY\u0101nidha, etc. This verse and the two following are stated to be pronounced by the god Cakra or Indra.\n\nVII. For the practices enjoined in this S\u016btra see Hardy's Manual of Buddhism, p. 59 and 458.\n\nSandhi. The scholiast says this may mean the junction of streets or of houses, or it may be \u0101lokasandhi, \"a window.\"\n\nSi\u1e45gh\u0101takesa. See Abhidh\u0101n, 203. The scholiast translates it, \"places where three roads meet.\"\n\nDv\u0101rab\u0101h\u0101su. This word is given at verse 219 of Abhidh\u0101n. Pad\u012bp., where it is translated \"hinge.\"\n\nGharam. By metathesis (or rather hyperthesis) for \u0917\u093e\u0939, the original form of \u0917\u093e\u0939. The latter word is in P\u0101li gaham.\n\nKoci. The scholiast says, \"None of these relatives in the world of men.\" The passage is somewhat obscure. Kamma is explained by Aku\u00e7alakarma.\n\nTattha sam\u0101gantv\u0101. The scholiast says, \"At the place where the meal is set ready for them.\"\nGorakkh' etta. For gorakkha ettha, th being changed to t for euphony. Compare ida bhikkhave for idha bhikkhave (Clough's P\u00e1li Grammar, p. 11).\n\nVa\u1e6d\u1e6dam. Sanskrit \u0935\u091f\u094d\u091f\u092e\u094d.\n\nSakh\u00e1. This must be a plural, though it is in a form not given by Kacc\u00e1yana. The 140th rule of his N\u00e1makappa is SAKH\u00c1TOCA-YONO, which the Commentary explains thus: \"The noun Sakha has, beside the regular form sakha\u00f1o, two irregular forms of the nom. and acc. plur., viz. sakhayo and sakhino. Why is it said in the nom. and acc. plur.? Because these terminations are not found in the other cases, e.g. in the nom. sing., which is sakha.\" Clough makes no mention of these forms, but states that Sakha is declined like Att\u00e1. The Sanskrit Sakha has but one nom. plur. \u0938\u0916\u093e\u092f\u0903:\n\nAnussaram. The present participle.\n\nSa\u1e45ghamhi. See Hardy, Man. Budd. p. 59.\n\nTh\u00e1naso. Th\u00e1na with the adverbial termination So, in Sanskrit \u0936\u094b. This suffix is a much used in P\u00e1li. It is dealt with as follows in the 54th and 55th rules of Kacc\u00e1yana's N\u00e1makappa:\n\nRule 54. Sov\u00e1. Tasma ak\u00e1rato n\u00e1 vacanassa so \u00e1deso hoti v\u00e1: athaso dhammam j\u00e1n\u00e1ti: bya\u00f1janaso atham j\u00e1n\u00e1ti: akkhara so: suttaso: padaso: yasaso: up\u00e1yaso: sabbaso: th\u00e1maso: th\u00e1naso. V\u00e1 ti kim atham?: p\u00e1dena v\u00e1: atirekap\u00e1dena v\u00e1: yo bhikkhu theyyacittena parassa bhandam ganh\u00e1ti so bhikkhu p\u00e1r\u00e1jiko hoti asamv\u00e1so.\n\n\"The suffix So optionally takes the place of the inflexion of the instrumental case, e.g. Atthaso, Bya\u00f1janaso, etc. Why optionally? Because instead of saying P\u00e1dena, we might say P\u00e1dena, or P\u00e1davasena, or Atirekap\u00e1dena; and instead of Theyyaso we might say Theyyacittena.\"\n\nRule 55. D\u00edghorehi. D\u00edgha ora icc-etehi sm\u00e1 vacanassa so \u00e1deso hoti v\u00e1 yath\u00e1 sankhyam: d\u00edghaso: oraso: d\u00edghamh\u00e1: oramh\u00e1: d\u00edghorehi ti kim atham: saramh\u00e1: vacanamh\u00e1.\n\n\"In D\u00edgha and Ora the suffix So may be used for the inflexion of the abl. singular; thus, d\u00edghaso, oraso, equivalent to d\u00edghamh\u00e1 and oramh\u00e1. Why is it said in D\u00edgha and Ora? Because with other words, as Sara and Vacana, this suffix cannot be used for the ablative inflexion, but we must say sar\u00e1mh\u00e1, vacanamh\u00e1.\"\n\nI have collected the following instances of this suffix, and many more might be added to the list: athaso, bya\u00f1janaso, akkharaso, suttaso, padaso, p\u00e1daso, yasaso, up\u00e1yaso, sabbaso, th\u00e1maso, th\u00e1naso,\ntheyyaso, yoniso, dh\u00e1tuso, hetuso, bilaso, antamaso, abhinhaso, anekaso, pa\u00f1capa\u00f1caso, d\u00edghaso, oraso. In Sanskrit we have \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u0935\u0948\u0930\u093f\u0915\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u0924\u093e\u0935\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u092c\u094b\u0927\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u092c\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0938\u0941\u0916\u0903, \u0928\u0935\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939\u0903, etc.\n\nVIII. Odakantike. The scholiast says, \u201cIn a deep pit in the earth close to water.\u201d That is, so deep as almost to reach the water which is always found if we dig deep enough. I am disposed to think that Odakantikam is a noun meaning \u201ca deep pit.\u201d\n\nTam (v. 3). The scholiast has the following note: \u201cHere Tam is a p\u00e1d\u00e1p\u00fara\u1e47a particle; or else we must suppose that Tam sabbo stands by change of gender for So sabbo, as in the phrase, Yath\u00e1 tam appamattassa \u00e1t\u00e1pino.\n\nCetiyamhi, etc. In this verse and the next I have followed the scholiast, but the locatives are probably governed by Sunihito in verse 8.\n\nGaman\u00edyesu. The scholiast translates Gaman\u00edy\u00e1ni by bhog\u00e1. The word evidently means \u201ctransitory,\u201d and as applied to earthly riches is opposed to Anug\u00e1mika in the previous verse. The locative presents a difficulty, but may perhaps be explained thus, \u201cIn the case of the treasures of this world, leaving them.\u201d See Dhammap. 142.\n\nAs\u00e1dh\u00e1ranam. For as\u00e1dh\u00e1ra\u1e47o, as in verse 3.\n\nManussik\u00e1. This is undoubtedly the right reading, but the form is highly irregular.\n\nYoniso. The scholiast translates this \u201cwisely.\u201d See Dham. v. 326 and note.\n\nMahiddhiy\u00e1. \u092e\u0939\u093f with \u092e\u0939\u093f and suffix \u092f. The scholiast gives another reading, Mahatthik\u00e1, \u201cof great advantage.\u201d\n\nYadidam. This adverb means \u201cnamely,\u201d \u201cthat is to say,\u201d \u201cfor instance.\u201d See D\u2019Alwis\u2019 P\u00e1li Gram. p. 107, second line. It retains, I think, its meaning in the verse we are considering, \u201cThus this thing, namely the possession of merit, is of great effect.\u201d Here Es\u00e1 should properly be Idam or Eso (nidhi), but is made feminine by attraction to Sampad\u00e1.\n\nCompare Es\u00e1 paccayo jar\u00e1maranassa yadidam j\u00e1ti, \u201cthis is the cause of decay and death, viz. Birth.\u201d (Mah\u00e1 Nid\u00e1na Sutta.)\n\nIX. Abhisamecca. \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0938\u092e\u0947\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e with \u0905\u092d\u093f\u0938, \u0938\u092e\u0947\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e and \u0906\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e.\n\nS\u00faj\u00fa. The Sanna gives another form of this word, Suhuju.\n\nPadam. Gogerly translates this word \u201cPath of Nirv\u00e1na.\u201d But I doubt that Pada is ever used in P\u00e1li in the sense of road or path. No such meaning is attributed to it either in Abhidh\u00e1na Pad\u00edpik\u00e1 or in Clough\u2019s Singhalese Dictionary. The former work gives the following meanings for Pada: \u201cPlace, protection, Nirv\u00e1na, cause,\nword, thing, portion, foot, footstep.\u201d As a name for Nirv\u00e1na I believe Pada to be used in the sense of \u201cplace\u201d or \u201clot.\u201d In Dham. v. 368, Fausb\u00f6ll translates Santam padam \u201cthe tranquil place\u201d (the Commentary says Santakotth\u00e1sa). But in verse 114 he translates Amatam padam \u201cthe immortal path,\u201d when the Commentary has Maranavirahitam kotth\u00e1sam. In verse 21 Pada may fairly be rendered \u201cway\u201d in its figurative sense of \u201cmeans\u201d or \u201ccause.\u201d Buddhaghosa, in the commentary on verse 21, says that Amatapada means Amatassa adhigam\u00fap\u00e1yo, \u201cmeans of attaining Nirv\u00e1na,\u201d and a few lines further down he says, Padan ti up\u00e1yo maggo.\n\nSallahukavutti. A compound of sam, lahu, and vutti (\u0935\u0943\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f).\n\nKulesu. In the families or houses he frequents for alms.\n\nTas\u00e1. Dham. v. 405.\n\nD\u00edgh\u00e1. The scholiast says, \u201cfor instance serpenta.\u201d\n\nNiyam. Sanskrit \u0928\u093f\u092f\u092e.\n\nAyus\u00e1. Abl. of \u00e1yusam, \u201cduration of life.\u201d Gogerly says, \u201cAs a mother protects with her life.\u201d\n\nY\u00e1vat\u2019. Y\u00e1vat\u00e1.\n\nBrahmam. Par. Jot. and the scholiast explain Brahman vih\u00e1ram by Se\u1e6d\u1e6dhavih\u00e1ra. Gogerly translates the passage, \u201cThis place is thus constituted a holy residence.\u201d The scholiast says that \u00c1hu refers to \u201cBuddhas and other holy men (\u00e1rya\u2019s).\u201d\n\nVineyya. Contracted for vinayeyya, as bh\u00e1veyya for bh\u00e1vayeyya.\n\nKhuddakap\u00e1\u1e6d\u1e6dhapakara\u1e47am. The meaning of this title is, \u201cThe book which contains the short readings.\u201d Compare Khuddakani-k\u00e1ya, which means not \u201cthe short collection,\u201d but \u201cthe collection of short books,\u201d viz., Khuddakap\u00e1\u1e6d\u1e6dha, Dhammapada, etc. D\u00edghani-k\u00e1ya means \u201cthe collection of long S\u00fatras,\u201d as appears from the fifth verse of Buddhaghosa\u2019s introduction to Brahmaj\u00e1la Sutta At\u1e6dhakath\u00e1:\n\nD\u00edghassa d\u00edghasutta\u1e45kitassa\nNipupassa \u00e1gamavarassa\nBuddh\u00e1nubuddhasamvannitassa\nSaddh\u00e1vahagunassa.\n\n\u201cThe noble Long Collection, distinguished by its long discourses, of subtle meaning, praised by Buddha and his apostles, and possessed of the qualities that sustain faith.\u201d\nART.VIII.\u2014An Endeavour to Elucidate Rashiduddin's Geographical Notices of India. By Col. H. Yule, C.B.\n\n[Read Dec. 21, 1868.]\n\nOne of the most interesting articles in the late Sir Henry Elliot's work, \"The History of India as told by its own Historians,\" is that which consists of extracts from Rashiduddin's Jami'-ut-Tawarikh. A large part of that worthy's notices of India is indeed taken from Albiruni, but the concluding portion is presumably his own, and speaks of a state of things existing in his own time. It is to this portion of the article that the following observations refer. In the original edition of Sir Henry Elliot's work this was crammed with obscurities. Many of these have been removed by the recent editor, Professor Dowson, through the comparison of various MSS., but obscurities still remain. Recent studies having directed my attention to this subject, I have been trying to clear these up. In many cases I have utterly failed; in some I trust to have succeeded in throwing a little light, and I venture to submit the result to the Society, in the hope that others, much more competent, will lend aid in cracking some of the hard nuts that are left.\u00b9\n\nThe editor, for reasons given in his preface, has adopted a system for the exhibition of Oriental words which does not attempt the representation of precise Oriental spelling. He says this would have been unheeded by the general reader, and useless to the scholar. An anomalous reader like myself, who cannot class himself as either the one or the other, has, perhaps, no right to say a word. Yet, I think, where so\n\n\u00b9 The substance of part of these remarks has been already printed in notes scattered over Cathay and the Way Thither; a work issued by the Hakluyt Society.\nmany proper names occur of exceedingly doubtful reading, it would have been well either to diacriticize the letters or to give the original readings below. This last has been done, indeed, in many cases, but in some others, where it was very desirable, it has been omitted.\n\nI shall extract the passages on which I have anything to observe, paragraph by paragraph, interpolating the remarks that have occurred to me; omitting entirely those passages on which I have nothing relevant to offer.\n\n(Guzer\u00e1t, p. 67.)\n\n\"M\u00falt\u00e1n and U'ch are subject to Dehli, and the son of the S\u00falt\u00e1n of Dehli is the Governor. There is a road from hence by land as well as by the shore of the sea to Guzer\u00e1t, which is a large country, within which are Kamb\u00e1ya, Somn\u00e1t, Kankan, T\u00e1na, and several other cities and towns . . . . Grapes are produced twice during the year, and the strength of the soil is such that cotton plants grow like willows and plane-trees, and yield produce ten years running. . . . . Sugar from Malwa, b\u00e1dr\u00fa (balm) and baladi are exported in ships from the coasts of Guzer\u00e1t to all countries and cities.\"\n\nKankan and Tana, which are printed in the translation as distinct, should, in all probability, form a compound name, Kankan-T\u00e1na, uniting the name of the city and province, as in K\u00fdj-Makr\u00e1n, Diul-Sind, and many other cases. The compound term is actually used by Ibn Batuta in the shape of K\u00fakan-T\u00e1na (III., 335), whilst it appears in the Portulano Mediceo of the middle of the 14th century as Cocintana, and in the Catalan Map of 1375 more incorrectly as Cocintaya.\n\nThe statement about the cotton plants of Guzerat is remarkable in itself, and also from its conformity with what Marco Polo says in treating of the same province: \"In this province of Guzerat there grows much pepper, ginger, and indigo. They have also a great deal of cotton. Their cotton plants are very large, growing full six paces high, and to the age of twenty years. It is to be noted, however, that when the trees get so old the cotton is not good to spin, but only fit for quilting and stuffing beds. Up to the age of twelve\nyears they give good spinning cotton, but from that to twenty years the produce is inferior.\"\n\nBaladi is, I imagine, the quality of ginger so called (\"country ginger\"), which is often mentioned in the mercantile handbook of Balducci Pegolotti (circa 1340), as well as by Nicolo Conti, and, at a later date, Barbosa.\n\nThere seems some doubt about B\u00e1dr\u00fa, which is, in part, a conjectural reading, and does not seem to be a probable staple of trade. In a previous passage, (p. 66) the word appears in the form of B\u00e1war\u00fai. There is a passage in Barbosa of which I will hazard the quotation, as perhaps containing light on the subject. Speaking of staple articles of export from the ports near Cambay he especially names manufactured articles of carnelian and of chalcedony, \"which they call Babayore\" (Ramusio I., f. 297 v.). The Mohit also, in speaking of Cambay, says: \"In this country is a profusion of B\u00e1bg\u00fari and cornelians (J.A.S.B. V. 463). The word is in Redhouse's Turkish Dictionary as \"\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631\u064a\", a kind of hard stone, an agate (?); and in his English-Turkish Dict. the equivalent of chalcedony is given \u0627\u062a\u06cc \u0628\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0631\u064a, and B\u00e1bg\u00fari simply with a (?), as that of agate. This word may thus possibly be identical with B\u00e1war\u00fai, which in that case would represent the chalcedonies and agates which have so long been a product of Cambay.\n\n(Malabar, p. 67-8).\n\n\"Beyond Guzerat are Kankan and T\u00e1na; beyond them the country of Mal\u00edb\u00e1r, which, from the boundary of Karoha to K\u00falam, is 300 parasangs in length. . . . Of the cities on the shore the first is Sind\u00e1b\u00far, then Fakn\u00far, then the country of Munjar\u00far, then the country of Hili, then the country of Sadars\u00e1, then Jangli, then K\u00falam.\"\n\nKaroha, the northern boundary of Malabar. The definition of Malabar here includes Canara and even part of the Konkan, for the boundary is to be sought north of Goa, as we shall see presently. I take Karoha to be probably Gheriah (Garhiah ?), in after days the fortress of Angria, and a prominent point on the coast. In the early part of the Portu-\nguese regime the limit between the Goa territory and that of the Bahmani kings of the Deccan on the coast was at Carapatam, a place not found in our modern maps, but which W. Hamilton identifies (Corepatam) with Gheriah, though Rennell places it some distance south of the latter.\n\nSind\u00e1b\u00far.\u2014Difficulty has been created as to the position of this place, owing to Abulfeda\u2019s confounding it with Sind\u00e1n, which lay north of T\u00e1na (see in Gildemeister, p. 188). That place may possibly also have been in old days called Sind\u00e1b\u00far\u2014there is nothing to be made of the desperate confusion of Edrisi on the subject,\u2014but Abulfeda\u2019s own data show us that the Sind\u00e1b\u00far of his day lay three days (voyage) south of Tana, and was reached shortly before Hun\u00e1war (Onore). This agrees perfectly with Rashiduddin\u2019s indication, and with Ibn Batuta\u2019s. The place appears as Chintabor and Cintapor on the Catalan and Medicean maps, in as great accordance with the position we assign to it as could be expected.\n\nIbn Batuta himself speaks of Sind\u00e1b\u00far as on an island containing thirty-six villages, as being one of the ports which traded direct with Aden, and as being about one day\u2019s voyage north of Hun\u00e1war. It could not, therefore, have been far from Goa, and I believe it to have been identical with Goa for the following reasons:\n\n(1) Ibn Batuta says the island stood on an estuary, of which the water was salt at flood and fresh at ebb; therefore it was a Delta island, as Goa is.\n\n(2) His mention of Thirty-six villages suggests that this number was notorious. And De Barros says the island of Goa was known by a native name, meaning Thirty Villages. He also says that it was anciently one of the great ports for the import of horses from Arabia.\n\n(3) In the Turkish work on navigation, called the Mohit, translated by Hammer-Purgstall, there is a section headed by the translator \u201c24th Voyage, from Kuwai Sindabur to Aden.\u201d The original characters given in a note read \u0643\u0648\u0647 \u0633\u0646\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0648\u0631 (J.A.S.B. V. 464).\n\nGildemeister (p. 46) seems to have an inkling of the view here taken, but does not see clearly that the Goah (rather\nK\u0101wi (\u0643\u0627\u0631\u064a) of Ibn Batuta is really in Guzerat (Gongway or Conwa opposite Cambay).\n\nFakn\u016br is mentioned under that name also by Ibn Batuta, who touched there between Hun\u0101war and Mangalore. It is probably the Magan\u016br of Abdurrazz\u0101k, and was well known in the 16th and 17th centuries as Baccanore.\n\nManjar\u016br is Mangalore, as Sir H. Elliot has pointed out.\n\nHili. The general position of this place is still marked by Monte Dely, a prominent landmark on the coast between Mangalore and Cannanore, and the name of which is in a Portuguese form \"the Hill of Hili or Hely.\" The hill itself is mentioned by Abulfeda as R\u0101s Hai\u1e6di. The territory is the Ely of Marco Polo, who speaks of its one or more estuaries affording but imperfect shelter to vessels, on which account the Chinese ships that frequented it had to hurry their lading. Ibn Batuta calls Hili a great and well-built city situated on a large estuary, accessible to great ships. It was the only port on the coast, he says, besides Calicut and Kaulam, which the China junks entered. Elly appears on the Catalan map below Manganor; and is mentioned by Nicolo Conti along with Pacamuria (read Pacamuria, Fakn\u016br, or Baccanore).\n\nI find no means of deciding absolutely whether the port of Hili lay north or south of Mount Dely. To the north there is one considerable river, that which Rennell calls Cangerecora, passing Nileshweram (supposed to represent the ancient Nelcynda); to the south of it there is another estuary on which stands Baliapatam, where the English had a factory in the 17th century, and where the Raja of Cannanore had his residence in the 16th. Ibn Batuta puts a port called Jorfattan three parasangs beyond Hili, and I suspect this may be only a quasi translation of Baliapatam (Zor=strength, Bali=strong). If this be so Hili must have been on the northern river.\n\nThere is perhaps an indication of Hili in the Ela-bacare of the Periplus, at the mouth of the river of Nelcynda; but the passage is defective. There is a clearer indication in the Elim\u0101 of the Ravenna geographer, who mentions it next to Nelcinna or Nelcynda.\nSadars\u00e1. This is perplexing as it stands, but the variation given by Professor Dowson from MS. O. (\u0645\u064e\u062f\u0650\u064a\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064c) shows clearly what the name ought to be, viz., \u0641\u0646\u062f\u0631\u064a\u0646\u0627 Fandarain\u00e1, a port mentioned under that name both by Edrisi and Ibn Batuta, as Bandirana (miswritten Bandinana) by Abdurrazz\u00e1k, as Fantalaina in a Chinese edict of 1296, regarding Indian trade, which is quoted by Pauthier (Marc Pol, p. 532). It appears as Fenderena in the great map of Fra Mauro, as Fandrina in the travels of Friar Odoric; and in Barbosa, Varthema, and De Barros, by its name in the indigenous shape of Pandar\u00e1n\u00ed. The place has long dropt out of our maps, but its position is fixed by Varthema, who says that opposite the port, three leagues from shore, was an uninhabited island. This must be the Sacrifice Rock, about thirty miles north of Calicut.\n\nJangk\u00ed. This is presumably \u062c\u0646\u0643\u064a, and I doubt not it should be read Chinkali. The name appears as Shinkala or Shinkali in Abulfeda (see Gildemeister, p. 185), and is mentioned as Cynkali by John Marignolli, Cyngilin by Odoric, and Singuyli by Friar Jordanus. Abulfeda couples it with Sh\u00e1liy\u00e1t, called by the Portuguese Chalia and Chale, which was the port next below Calicut. And the next again of importance below that was Cranganore. Now Assemani tells us incidentally that Cranganore was also called Scigla, i.e. Shigla, or Shinkala. Chinkali is therefore Cranganore (Assem. III., Pt. 2, 440 and 732)\n\nK\u00falam, the Kaulam, Columbum, Coilon, Colon, of many travellers from the 9th century downwards, surviving in decay as Quilon.\n\n(Ma\u2019bar, p. 69).\n\n\u201cMa\u2019bar, from K\u00falam to the country of Sil\u00e1war, extends 300 parasangs along the shore. Its length is the same. It possesses many cities and villages, of which little is known. The king is called Dewar, which means, in the Ma\u2019bar language the \u201clord of wealth.\u201d Large ships, called in the language of China \u201cJunks,\u201d bring various sorts of choice merchandize and clothes from Ch\u00edn and M\u00e1ch\u00edn, and the\ncountries of Hind and Sind. The merchants export from Ma\u2019bar silken stuffs, aromatic roots; large pearls are brought up from the sea. The productions of this country are carried to \u2019Irak, Khurasan, Syria, R\u00fam, and Europe. The country produces rubies and aromatic grasses, and in the sea are plenty of pearls. Ma\u2019bar is, as it were, the key of Hind. Within the few last years Sundar Bandi was Dewar, who, with his three brothers, obtained power in different directions, and Malik Takiuddin bin \u2019Abdu-r rahman bin Muhammu-d Tibi, brother of Shaikh Jam\u00e1luddin, was his minister and adviser, to whom he assigned the government of Fatan, Malifatan, and B\u00e1wal; and because there are no horses in Ma\u2019bar, or rather those which are there are weak, it was agreed that every year Jam\u00e1luddin Ibrah\u00edm should send to the Dewar 1400 strong Arab horses obtained from the island of Kis, and 10,000 horses from all the islands of F\u00e1rs, such as Kat\u00edf, Lahsa, Bahrein, Harm\u00faz, Kilah\u00e1t, etc. Each horse is reckoned worth 220 dinars of red gold current.\n\nIn the year 692 A.H. (1293, A.D.) the Dewar died, and his wealth and possessions fell into the hands of his adversaries and opponents, and Shaikh Jumaluddin, who succeeded him, obtained, it is said, an accession of 7,000 bullock loads of gold, etc., and Takiuddin, according to previous agreement, became his lieutenant.\u201d\n\nFirst, as to the names of places in this passage. For Sil\u00e1war read Nil\u00e1war, and then we get the northern limit of what was understood by Ma\u2019bar. Kaulam belonged to Mala-b\u00e1r. But beyond that, or as Abulfeda puts it, beyond Cape Comorin, and, as we here learn, as far as Nellore, was called Ma\u2019bar. The reading commends itself to adoption; but in fact it is found in a parallel passage of Wass\u00e1f\u2019s history, which will be referred to afterwards.\n\nFor B\u00e1wal read K\u00e4il, as in Binakiti, quoted in the editor\u2019s note. K\u00e4il was a famous port in those days, to which Marco Polo devotes a chapter. It stood a little south of Tuticorin, which may be considered its modern but far humbler representative. Indeed Coilpatam is mentioned in Hamilton\u2019s Gazetteer as still a chief port of Tinnevelly, though now it\nhas dropt from our maps. It continued to be a place of some importance down to Portuguese times, and is mentioned by Abdurazz\u00e1k (miswritten K\u00e1bil), Conti (Kahila), Vasco da Gama (Caell), Barbosa, Varthema, and Giovanni of Empoli. The traditions of the Mahommedans of Ceylon point to it as the first settlement of their forefathers in India.\n\nThe identification of Fattan and Malifattan is a desideratum. Fattan is mentioned by Ibn Batuta as a fine large city on the shore, with an excellent harbour. He visited it when accompanying Ghai\u00e1ssudd\u00edn, Sultan of Ma\u2019bar, from a campaign in the vicinity of Hark\u00e1tu (Arcot) to Mutrah (Madura). It appears also to have been the chief port of Madura, for Ibn Batuta goes thither from Madura to take ship, and finds a fleet bound for Malabar and Yemen. Either Negapatam or Nagore appears to answer best to these frail data. As the names Nagore and Fattan alike signify \u201cThe City,\u201d perhaps it is to be identified with Nagore, which retained a large amount of foreign trade, especially with the Archipelago fifty years ago, whatever may be its present state. But, as regards means of information in books, I must say now as Rashid said then, that that coast possesses many cities and villages, but I can learn little about them!\n\nMalifattan is presumably the Manifattan of Abulfeda, mentioned by him as a city on the coast of Ma\u2019bar. It is also mentioned as a principality of southern India by Friar Jordanus (circa 1328). \u201cThere is also the King of Molephatum, whose kingdom is called Molepor, where pearls are taken in infinite quantities.\u201d And, when the said Jordanus was nominated Bishop of Columbum or Kaulam, we find the Pope (John XXII.) addressing commendatory letters in his behalf, not only to the Christians of that place, but also to \u201cthe whole body of Christian people dwelling in Molephatam.\u201d\u00b9 The mention of pearls points to the vicinity of the Gulf of Manar. And the address of the Pope\u2019s letter is remarkable, as showing that there were Christians before the time of Xavier on that coast as well as in Malabar. I find Malipatan marked in a map which accompanies a letter from\n\n\u00b9 Oder. Raynaldi Annel. Ecclesiast. An. 1330, lv.\nP\u00e8re Bouchet in the *Lettres Edifiantes*. It there occupies a position on the shore of Palk\u2019s Bay, a little north of where our maps show *Devipatan*, but perhaps identical therewith. This is very probably the medieval Malifattan.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe two *Jamaluddins* mentioned in the extract are to be distinguished, as may be gathered from a comparison of the extracts from Wass\u00e1f, which Hammer-Purgstall has happily pitch-forked into his History of the Ilkhans. The one called here Shaikh Jamaluddin, is called by Wass\u00e1f Jamaluddin Abdurrahman Ut-Thaibi, \u201cthe Great Farmer-General and Lord of the Marches of India;\u201d and we see here that he became more or less of a ruling Prince in the Peninsula a good many years before the time when standard histories recognize any Mahomedan rule in those parts. He is, perhaps, the *Tchamalating*, whom Pauthier\u2019s Chinese Extracts show to have gone on a mission from Ma\u2019bar to the court of Kublai Kaan in or previous to 1281; and the *Silamuting*, whom they show as ruler of Ma\u2019bar in 1314, was perhaps his grandson Niz\u00e1mudd\u00edr, of whom Wass\u00e1f speaks (see *Pauthier*, pp. 601, 604, and *Hammer*, ii. 206). The other, Jamaluddin Ibrahim, bore the title of *Malik-ul-Islam*, and was Farmer-General of F\u00e1rs in the time of Argh\u00fan Khan and his successors, with great authority in the Persian Gulf. His contract with Takiuddin, the brother of the Indian Jamaluddin, is also mentioned by Wass\u00e1f, who was himself secretary to the Persian official and conducted his correspondence with India.\\(^2\\)\n\nWe should not omit to note again a striking conformity with Marco Polo\u2019s statements in the paragraph on which we are now commenting. When that traveller was in Ma\u2019bar he found it under the rule of five brothers, of whom one, called Sender-Bendi Devar, ruled that province which was near Ceylon, which held supremacy over the pearl fishery, which was the best and noblest province of southern India, and which was called *Soli*, indications which point to Tanjore and Ramnad; whilst another brother, called Asciar (*Ishwar*?),\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See *Lett. Edif.* (First Edition) 1722, Rec. XV.; Lyons Edn. 1819, Vol. VII.\n\n\\(^2\\) See *Gesch. der Ilchane*, II. 51-2, etc.\n\n\\(^3\\)\nruled at Ka\u00efl. In Ramusio's version of Polo the conformity is even closer, for that version, like Rashiduddin's account, makes the brother princes not five, but four in number. Polo, too, speaks of the horse trade in almost the same terms as the text, though he puts the price that horses then reached still higher, viz., \"500 saggi of gold, worth more than 100 marks of silver.\"\u00b9\n\nSundar Bandi (Sundara P\u00e1ndi) died, as we see from Rashid, in 1293, which must have been immediately after Marco Polo's passage by India to Persia, though that traveller's knowledge of Ma'bar may have been derived from an earlier visit to the Indian coast, of which there are some suggestions. Shaikh Jamaluddin is here stated to have succeeded Sundara Pandi, and the former, according to Wassaf (as far as I can make out from Hammer's dates), died about 1306. We then hear of a Raja of Ma'bar\u2014distinct, apparently, from any one of the four brothers\u2014stepping in to confiscate the great wealth which Jamaluddin had left. This Raja is called by Wassaf, Gilish Diur (Kalesa Dewar ?). It is stated that he had ruled for forty years in perfect peace and health, without ever having been sick or attacked by an enemy! In the treasury of Shahrmendi he had accumulated 1200 krors (!) of gold. He had two sons, Sundar Bandi by a lawful wife, and Pirebandi (Vira Pandi ?) by a concubine. He designated the latter, who was the superior character, as his successor. Sundar Bandi, enraged at this, slew his father (1309), and took forcible possession of Shahrmendi and its treasure. Pirebandi succeeded in driving him out; Sundar Bandi went to Al\u00e1uddin, Sultan of Dehli, and sought help. The Sultan eventually sent his General Haz\u00e1rdin\u00e1ri (Malik Kaf\u00far) to conquer Ma'bar, etc.\u00b2\n\nThis looks like a genuine story, but there are several diffi-\n\n\u00b9 The saggio of Venice was 1-6th of an ounce, but in Asiatic estimates Polo probably uses it for the miskd\u012b, which was not very different. The miskd\u012b of gold would be worth about 13s. in gold, giving \u00a3325 for the price of a horse; whilst 100 marks of silver would be a little over \u00a3200 in silver of our present money. But I have elsewhere shown reasons for believing that the relation of gold to silver in civilized Asia was then as 10 to 1; and this would make the two values nearly equivalent.\n\n\u00b2 Hammer, ii. 197 and 205\u20136.\nculties. The Sundar Bandi here spoken of must, of course, be a different person from the prince mentioned by Polo and Rashiduddin, and it is difficult to co-ordinate this Raja Kalesa of forty years peaceful reign with the four or five brothers at perpetual war, whom Polo found in possession of the country. Possibly these latter were adventurers who had divided the coast districts among them, whilst the Sovereign of the old dynasty still reigned in the interior at Shahrmendi, which may be Madura, but is, perhaps, more probably the fortress of Trisirapuri (Trichinopoly).\n\nSea Route to China from Ma\u2019bar, p. 70.\n\n\"There are two courses or roads from this place: one leads by sea to Ch\u00edn and Mach\u00edn, passing by the Island of Silan. It is four parasangs long and four wide. It is parallel to the equator.\n\n\"Sarandip is at the foot of the J\u00fadi mountain . . . . The men are all Buddhists, and bow to and worship images.\n\n\"The Island of L\u00e1m\u00fari, which lies beyond it, is very large. It has a separate king.\n\n\"Beyond it lies the country of S\u00fam\u00fatra, and beyond that Darband Nias, which is a dependency of Java. In the mountains of J\u00e1va scented woods grow. In those islands are several cities, of which the chief are Ar\u00fa, Barlak, Dalmian, J\u00e1va, and Bark\u00fadoz. The mountains of J\u00e1v\u00e1 are very high. It is the custom of the people to puncture their hands and entire body with needles, and then rub in some black substance to colour it.\n\n\"Opposite L\u00e1m\u00fari is the Island of L\u00e1kw\u00e1ram, which produces red amber. Men and women go naked, except that the latter cover the pudenda with cocoanut leaves. They are all subject to the K\u00e1\u00e1n. Passing on from this, you come to a continent called Jampa, also subject to the K\u00e1\u00e1n. The people are red and white.\n\n\"Beyond that is Haitam, subject also to the K\u00e1\u00e1n.\n\n\"Beyond that is M\u00e1h\u00e1ch\u00edn, then the harbour of Zait\u00fan on the shore of the China Sea, and an officer of the K\u00e1\u00e1n, entitled Shak, resides there. Beyond that is Khans\u00e1i\u2019, in which\nthe market-place is six parasangs broad, from which it may be judged how large the place is. It is subject to the deputies of the K\u00e1\u00e1n, who are Moghals, Musulm\u00e1ns, Khit\u00e1yans and Ghuris. Khans\u00e1i is the capital.\n\n\"Forty days' journey from it lies Kh\u00e1nb\u00e1l\u00edk, the capital of the Ph\u0153nix of the West\u2014K\u00e1\u00e1n, king of the earth.\"\n\nThe two courses diverging from Ma\u2019bar (viz., from Kail) are two routes to China\u2014one by sea, the other along the eastern shore of India and then overland into Western China.\n\nThe passage about Sil\u00e1n and Sarandip is confused and probably corrupt. The four parasangs of length and breadth probably was written forty. One of the articles in Kazwini (Gildemeister; 197) makes the length and breadth of Sarandib equal, each eighty parasangs; and another article (p. 203), as here, seems to distinguish between Suil\u00e1n and Sarandip, putting the latter in the interior of the former.\n\nThe application of the term J\u00fadi to Adam\u2019s peak is curious. Sir E. Tennent mentions that a Samaritan version of the Pentateuch, and an Arabic version of the same in the Bodleian library, both substitute Sarendip for Ararat in the narrative of the Deluge.\u00b9 As J\u00fadi is the Ark Mountain of the Mahomedans, it looks as if Rashiduddin held the same tradition.\n\nThe Island of L\u00e1m\u00fari is certainly Sumatra, with especial reference to its North-West extremity (not North-East, as in Sir H. Elliot\u2019s note). The name is used in like manner by Friar Odoric, who, on quitting Ma\u2019bar, and sailing fifty days across the ocean towards the south, came to a certain country called Lamori, where he lost sight of the North Star. Lambri, a province of this part of Sumatra, appears not only in the Shij\u00e1rat Mal\u00e1yu and Marco Polo, as mentioned in the note, but also in De Barros as one of the twenty-nine petty kingdoms which divided the coast of Sumatra at the beginning of the 16th century. The Turkish author of the Mohit, in describing the course to Malacca, says: \"If you wish to reach Malacca guard against sighting J\u00e1misfulah\" (Pulo Gomus, a small island off Achin Head, the Gavenispola of Marco Polo), \"because the mountains of L\u00e1mri advance into\n\n\u00b9 Ceylon, Fourth Ed., I. 551\u20132.\nthe sea, and the flood is there very strong\u201d (*J. As. Soc. Bengal*, VI., 807).\n\n*S\u00famutra* is mentioned with reference to Lamori in the same way as here, by Friar Odoric. \u201cIn this same island towards the south (i.e. in the same bearing that he believed he had come from Ma\u2019bar), is another kingdom, by name *S\u00famoltra,*\u201d in which he says the people brand themselves on the face, i.e. tattoo themselves, as stated here; a practice not now followed by any of the races of Sumatra itself of which we have distinct accounts. The kingdom in question is the *Sam\u00fadra* of the Malay Annals, the *Samara* of Marco Polo (probably a clerical error for *Samatra*), and the *S\u00famuthra* of Ibn Batuta, who twice visited the court of its Mahomedan Sultan near the middle of the 14th century. It lay along the north coast, west of Pasei, and the capital probably stood near the head of the Bay of Pasei. Possibly traces or memory of it would be found still to exist, but that coast has almost fallen out of the knowledge of European geography.\n\nThough *Nias* is the name of a large island off the west coast of Sumatra, I hardly think it can be referred to in the term *Darband Nias* or *Man\u00e1s*. The writer is noting points on the route to China. Sumatra comes in beyond Lamuri; Nias does not fall into the route. The term *Darband*, perhaps, points to the Straits of Singapore, and Singhap\u00fara was a Javanese colony.\n\n*Aru* and *Barlak* were both petty states of Sumatra. The former appears (*Haru*) in the Malay annals as converted at an early date to Islam, and is mentioned by De Barros and other Portuguese writers. Its position was apparently on the Eastern coast of the Batta country, below the Assahan River. Tanjong *Perlak*, the Malay name of what we call Diamond Point, is a trace of the kingdom of Perlak (or *Barlak* of the text); it is mentioned in the Malay annals, and is Marco Polo\u2019s *Ferlec*.\n\n*Dalmian* might prove to be the *Dagroian* of Polo, if we knew the proper reading.\n\n*L\u00e1ku\u00e1ram* no doubt should be *N\u00e1kv\u00e1r\u00e1m*, the *Necuveram* of Polo, Nicobar Islands. Their ambergris and naked folk\nare standing topics down a long chain of travellers. The statement that they were subject to the K\u00e1\u00e1n is illustrated by Polo\u2019s similar statement as to uncivilized races on the coast of Sumatra: \u201cThey call themselves his subjects, but they pay him no tribute; indeed they are so far away that his men could not go thither. Still, all these islanders declare they are his subjects, and sometimes they send him strange things as presents.\u201d Kublai K\u00e1\u00e1n had a whim of sending embassies about the world to invite tenders of allegiance and to collect curiosities. One of them got as far as Madagascar, and was treated like Mr. Rassam. Kublai, more fortunate than a government we wot of, appears to have got his envoys released at the expense of a second mission, and they brought him back full compensation in the shape of a rukh\u2019s quill eighty palms long.\n\nJampa is the Champa and Chamba of medieval travellers, the Sanf of older Arab voyagers, and was then equivalent to Cochin China without Tonking.\n\nHaitam should probably be Hainam, and represent \u2019An-nam or Tonking.\n\nM\u00e1h\u00e1chin is Canton. Odoric, John Marignolli, Wass\u00e1f, Ibn Batuta, and Rashiduddin himself elsewhere, give it the same name in the Persian form of Chin-Kal\u00e1n. It also appears in that form in the Catalan map, very well placed.\n\nZait\u00fan, or Chincheu (properly Thsiuancheu), probably in those days by far the greatest commercial port in the world, has often been written about. Ibn Batuta landed here, and hence, apparently, Marco Polo sailed for Persia.\n\nShak, the K\u00e1\u00e1n\u2019s officer. Read Sing or Shing, as the Sank of the note suggests. \u201cShing, i.e. a great city, in which the high and mighty council holds its meetings\u201d (Wass\u00e1f by Hammer, p. 43). \u201cScieng qe vaut \u00e0 dire le Cort Greignor qe ne a sor elz qe le Grant Sire.

Sing do not exist in all the cities, but only in the capitals of great provinces, which, in fact, form kingdoms ranking with Baghdad, Shiraz, Iconium, and R\u00fam. In the whole empire of the Kaan there are twelve of these Sing\u201d (Rashiduddin, an extract by Klaproth, Journ. As. Ser. II. Tom. XI.).\n\nNeumann says the Chinese word is Sing, signifying primarily to investigate, and then Inspection, a Province, a Provincial Council. \u201cIt is also pronounced Seng in the sense of the city or capital where the council sits.\u201d Pauthier, again, says Polo\u2019s Scieng is rather Siang, a minister of state, or his office. Probably the non-Chinese confounded the words.\n\nGhuris. Read Ighurs. In another place Rash\u00edd says the members of the K\u00e1\u00e1n\u2019s cabinet were Tajiks, Cathayans, Ighurs, and Arka\u00fan (Nestorian Christians).\n\n(Overland Route to China, p. 72\u20133.)\n\n\u201cWith respect to the other road, which leads from Ma\u2019bar by way of Khit\u00e1i, it commences at the city of K\u00e1bal, then proceeds to the city of K\u00fanj\u00fa and Sunj\u00fa, then to K\u00edn, then to Mali Fatan, then to Kardar\u00e1y\u00e1, then to Haw\u00e1ri\u00fan, then to D\u00e1kli, then to Bijal\u00e1r, which, from of old, is subject to Dehli, and at this time one of the cousins of the Sultan of Dehli has conquered it, and established himself, having revolted against the Sult\u00e1n. His army consists of Turks. Beyond that is the country of Ratb\u00e1n, then Arman, then Zar-dand\u00e1n, so called because the people cover their teeth with gold. They puncture their hands and colour them with indigo. They eradicate their beards, so that they have not a sign of hair on their faces. They are all subject to the K\u00e1\u00e1n. This country is bounded on one side by the sea, afterwards comes the country of R\u00e1k\u00e1n, the people of which eat carrion and the flesh of men; they likewise are subject to the K\u00e1\u00e1n. Thence you arrive at the borders of Tibet, where they eat raw meat and worship images, and have no shame respecting their wives. The air is so impure that if they eat their dinner after noon they would all die. They boil tea and eat winnowed barley . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Another large country is called Kandah\u00e1r, which the Moghals\ncall Kar\u00e1j\u00e1ng. These people spring from Khit\u00e1i and Hind. In the time of K\u00fabil\u00e1 K\u00e2\u00e1n it was subdued by the Moghals. One of its borders adjoins Tibet, another adjoins Khit\u00e1, and another adjoins Hind. Philosophers have said that there are three countries celebrated for certain peculiarities: Hind is celebrated for its armies, Kandah\u00e1r for its elephants, and the Turks for their horses.\"\n\nThe names in this passage are so corrupt and uncertain that we can just trace the general line intended; and it is at least interesting to know that such a line of communication with China was recognized in those days.\n\nFor K\u00e1b\u00e1l again read K\u00e1\u00edl, which is the point of starting. K\u00fanj\u00fa and Sunj\u00fa, which are omitted in some of the MSS., I suspect may be interpolations by some one misunderstanding the route.\u00b9\n\nTaking the variations in the editor's note as a basis, I would read: \"It commences at the city of K\u00e1\u00edl, and proceeds thence to Fattan (\u0641\u062a\u0646) instead of \u062a\u064a\u0646) and thence to Majl\u00edfattan\" (Masulipatam).\n\nKardar\u00e1y\u00e1 is probably Godavery in some form. A city in the Delta (Coringa?) was so called, at least, by foreigners, as may be seen in De Barros. And Rennell writes Point Godavery as Gordewar.\n\nFor the next name the old edition had Hawr\u00e1raw\u00fan, which, possibly might be a corrupt transcript of Sun\u00e1rkaw\u00edn or Sunargong. Bijal\u00e1r is of course Bengal, as the note shows, then quasi-independent under the dynasty of Nasarudd\u00edn, who was son of the Emperor Balban of Dehli. Ratb\u00e1n and Arman (or Uman) I should guess to represent Arakan (Rak\u00e1n or Rakain), and Burma under some form of Polo's name for it (Mien or Amien). The Zardand\u00e1n are old friends described precisely under that name by Polo; their headquarters were at Yunchang, on the Chinese frontier of Burma.\u00b2 The next passage, introducing the sea, is absent\n\n\u00b9 We do find Kanja and Sanji in Edrisi (see the extracts, p. 90), though it is difficult to know where to look for them. Kanchi and Gingos are the nearest conjectures I can make, if the names in the text are genuine, but I cannot think these probable.\n\n\u00b2 I suspect they were Singphos, but no modern report attests the existence of the custom ascribed to them among any tribe on that frontier.\nfrom some MSS., and is not comprehended. Those shameless people on the borders of Tibet are probably Polo's people of Ka\u00efndu, to whom he ascribes a discreditable custom.\n\nKar\u00e1jang was we know the term applied by the Mongols to the great Province of Yunan, in the conquest of which Kublai Kaan took part personally, before his accession to the sovereignty. The term is used by Marco Polo (Carajan). But the other name here applied to it, Kandah\u00e1r, is more obscure. Kandah\u00e1r was the Arabic form of the name of Gandh\u00e1r\u00e1, the ancient and famous province on the Upper Indus, as may be seen in Sir H. Elliot's note, p. 48 of the work. It was the custom of the Indo-Chinese nations, who derived their religion from India, to apply Sanscrit names, and the names of Indian countries, especially such as were famous in the history of Buddhism, to their own lands and cities or those in their vicinity. Thus we have in Indo-Chinese regions Champa, Kamboja, Ayodhya, Kausambi, and many more such duplicates of ancient Indian names. Among the rest Gandh\u00e1ra appears to have been thus applied to Yunan, or some part of it. In the correspondence of the Kings of Burma with the court of Peking, the Chinese Emperor is often styled the King of Gand\u00e1larit, which seems to be the Burmese form of the name\u00b9 (e.g. see J.A.S.Bengal V. 161; VI. 436, 438). It is odd certainly that Rashiduddin should have got hold of this name. And it is pretty evident that he confounds it with the original Gandh\u00e1ra, for in another place he says: \"The Indians call it Kandar, we call it Kandah\u00e1r.\" The old saw of the 'Philosophers' is not likely to have had any reference to remote Yunan, of which the knowledge probably only reached Persia since the Mongol conquest of it. And, lastly, in the passage translated at p. 63 of Elliot, Rashidud-din, in transcribing Albiruni's notice of the real Gandh\u00e1r\u00e1 on the Indus, interpolates \"which the Moghals call Kar\u00e1j\u00e1ng,\" an interpolation which sadly shakes one's faith in the soundness of the Wazir's geographical knowledge.\n\n\u00b9 Col. Burney (VI. 436) says Gand\u00e1lar\u00e9t is the classical name for China. But my friend, Sir Arthur Phayre, informs me that it applies to some part of Yunan.\nART. IX.\u2014Sassanian Inscriptions explained by the Pahlavi of the Parsis. By E. W. West, Esq.\n\n[Read March 15, 1869].\n\nMr. Thomas has lately done good service to Pahlavi archaeology, by collecting all the best copies of the Sassanian inscriptions, that are known to exist, from the various books of travels and unpublished papers in which they have hitherto remained comparatively hidden and neglected. If his tentative translation of the H\u00e2ji\u00e2b\u00e2d inscription is likely to be less useful, it is probably owing to his treating the language as an unknown one, and only to be interpreted by a free use of all available lexicons, aided by a variety of hazardous guesses. But there is good reason for believing that the language of these inscriptions is not unknown, as the composition, or rearrangement, of most of the Pahlavi literature of the Parsis, is traditionally ascribed to the time of the Sassanian rule; if, therefore, this tradition be correct, there ought to be a close resemblance between the language of the inscriptions and that of the Pahlavi books, after allowing for probable alterations made in the books, by successive copyists.\n\nA large portion of the Pahlavi literature remains, as yet, a sealed book to Europeans, but sufficient is available for a fair comparison with the language of the inscriptions, although perhaps not enough for their full explanation. It is evident that this investigation is of importance, as tending to settle, in an indisputable manner, both the age and character of (what Mr. Thomas styles) \"the dubious and composite infiltrations of the ancient Pehlvi, accepted in Bombay;\" in comparison with which settlement, the mere translation of the inscriptions is a matter of small moment, as they are not likely to contain any valuable historical facts, not already known from other sources. It has been, however, with a view\nto both objects, that the attention of Dr. Haug and myself has been directed to this investigation, and the object of the present paper is to detail the first results we have obtained.\n\nThe Pahlav\u00ee of the P\u00e2rs\u00ee books is a composite language, containing the two elements, Huzv\u00e2rash and P\u00e2zand, mingled in varying proportions. The Huzv\u00e2rash is Semitic, except certain terminations to be noticed hereafter, and a few words derived from the Zand; while the P\u00e2zand is merely a dialect of Persian, written either in Pahlav\u00ee or Zand letters, and which it is convenient to call P\u00e2rs\u00ee when written in the Persian character. All the Huzv\u00e2rash verbs have an unwieldy appearance, owing to the Persian verbal terminations being added to the original verb. Such an arrangement is evidently necessary for indicating the moods, tenses, and persons, which are not otherwise expressed, and it is the usual mode of introducing foreign verbs into a language; in proof of which we may refer to any of the English verbs derived from the Latin, as obstructed, ascribed, where we find the English verbal termination added to some common form of the Latin verb: or we may take some of the Anglo-Indian developments, not yet admitted by lexicographers, as puckerowed, from pakaro, 2nd pl. imperative of the Hind\u00fbst\u00e2ni verb pakarna, 'to seize, lay hold of;' and samjhowed, from the 2nd pl. imperative of samjh\u00e2na, 'to explain.'\n\nBut although the Huzv\u00e2rash verbs have thus the appearance of being assimilated to their Ir\u00e2nian companions, by the Persian verbal terminations written after them, in the Pahlav\u00ee writings, it is still very doubtful if they were ever generally spoken with those terminations. According to Dr. Haug's testimony, they are not so pronounced at the present day, as whenever a P\u00e2rs\u00ee priest reads a Pahlav\u00ee book, he invariably pronounces the P\u00e2zand equivalent for every Huzv\u00e2rash word that he meets with. Therefore in the case of a Huzv\u00e2rash verb, the only part of the written word which he pronounces\n\n1 The exact limits of the Huzv\u00e2rash are uncertain; according to one definition they would include only the Semitic element of the Pahlav\u00ee; according to another, all words explained by P\u00e2zand equivalents, in the old Pahlav\u00ee vocabulary of the P\u00e2rs\u00ees, should be considered as Huzv\u00e2rash; in which case, probably one-fifth of the words are of Zand origin, and perhaps some are Turanian.\nis the Persian termination, added for his guidance to the crude verb, and which he adds to the crude P\u0101zand verb, which he pronounces. In the same manner, the termination \\( \\text{i} \\text{tar} \\) is often added to the Huzv\u0101rash words \\( \\text{ab} \\), \u2018father;\u2019 and \\( \\text{am} \\), \u2018mother,\u2019 to notify to the reader that they should be pronounced \\( \\text{padar} \\) and \\( \\text{m\u0101dar} \\), which are their P\u0101zand equivalents. This practice of writing a foreign word and then reading its vernacular equivalent is not altogether unknown among ourselves; we write \\( \u00a3 \\ s.\\ d.\\), but read pounds, shillings, and pence; and we write lbs., viz., and i.e., but we rarely read them as anything but pounds, namely, and that is.\n\nThe Huzv\u0101rash words have thus practically become ideographs, to which a pronunciation, foreign to their original sounds, has become firmly attached. Two effects have been produced by this foreign or P\u0101zand mode of pronunciation: first, the original pronunciation has in many cases been lost, and mis-readings have been traditionally adopted, as the written Huzv\u0101rash often admits of being read several ways, owing to some of the letters representing two or three sounds, and compounds of two or three such ambiguous letters are common, and each of these may therefore be read in from four to twenty-seven different ways; however the written Huzv\u0101rash word is rarely much corrupted, so that its correct pronunciation can generally be restored from comparison with other Semitic languages; and any identifications with words in the less ambiguous characters of the Sassanian inscriptions will be of great importance in proving the correctness, or otherwise, of such proposed restorations of the original Huzv\u0101rash pronunciation. Secondly, the P\u0101zand has often crept into the text of the MSS. in place of the original Huzv\u0101rash word, having, perhaps, been originally interlined as a gloss, and then substituted, by the next copyist, for the Huzv\u0101rash word in the text; and this change has been progressive, as may be seen by comparing any modern Pahlavi MS. with an old MS. of the same work, when it will generally be found that the modern MS. contains more P\u0101zand words than exist in the old one.\nReturning to the unwieldy verbs so frequent in Pahlav\u00ee, it may be observed, that in order to arrive at the real Huzv\u00e2rash verb, it is necessary to strike off the Persian terminations, and we then find that the verb always ends in \\( \\text{i}n \\), and can be recognized as the third person plural, either of the preterit or aorist, of some Semitic root, unless the final of the root becomes \\( t \\), in which case the second person plural is adopted as the Huzv\u00e2rash verb. The verbs \\( \\text{h\u00faman} \\) 'to be,' and \\( \\text{att} \\) 'is,' are apparently the only exceptions to these rules, being anomalous forms; the former takes the Persian terminations, but the latter does not. In the old Pahlav\u00ee-P\u00e2zand Glossary, edited by Dast\u00fbr Hoshangj\u00ee (under Dr. Haug's supervision) for the Bombay Government, and about to be published, the meanings of one hundred and four Huzv\u00e2rash verbs are given, besides the two just mentioned; of these only fifteen verbs are in the form of the Semitic aorist, and the remainder in that of the preterit, and twelve of these latter are in the form of the second person plural. The same glossary was given by Anquetil du Perron, in his Zend-Avesta, but the words were much disguised by the uncouth orthography which he adopted, as well as by the altered arrangement.\n\nThis glossary must have been in existence before the middle of the eighth century of the Christian era, as it is described and quoted by Ibn Muqaffa, who wrote in the time of the Khal\u00eef Al-Mans\u00fbr, A.D. 754-775, and a fragment of whose writings is preserved in the Kit\u00e2b\u00fb-l-fihrist. From a MS. of this work at Paris, M. Ganneau\\(^1\\) quotes the following passage, in the words of Ibn Muqaffa, descriptive of this glossary, and quoting the words \\( \\text{\u0646\u0627\u0628} \\), \\( \\text{\u06a9\u0648\u0634\u062a} \\), \\( \\text{\u0631\u0648\u062f\u0627\u062f} \\), which actually occur in the glossary, as it stands at the present day.\n\n\\[\n\\text{\u0648 \u0644\u0647 \u0647\u0686\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0647 \u0632\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0634 \u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062d\u0631\u0648\u0641 \u0645\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0648 \u0645\u0641\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0648\u0647\u0648}\n\\]\n\n\\(^1\\) Journal Asiatique, Avril-Mai, 1866, p. 430. This passage has been several times quoted, as by M. Quatrem\u00e8re, Jour. As. Mars, 1835, p. 256; and thence, with other matter, by Prof. Spiegel, in his Grammatik der Huzv\u00e2resch-Sprache, p. 22; also by M. Lenormant, Jour. As. Aout-Sept. 1865, p. 200. But none of these writers appear to have noticed that the Arab writer, of the eighth century, was referring to the Pahl.-P\u00e2z. Gloss. published, in a modified form, by Anquetil du Perron, in his Zend-Avesta, in 1771.\nWhich may be translated as follows: \"And they [the Persians] have an orthography called Zaw\u0101rash; they write it with letters connected and disconnected, and it has about a thousand words, that they may distinguish in it between what are similar; for example, whoever wishes to write gusht, which is lahm (flesh) in Arabic, writes bisr\u0101 and reads it gusht, in this fashion \u0631\u06cc\u0633\u061b and when he wishes to write n\u0101n, which is khubz (bread) in Arabic, he writes lahm\u0101 and reads it n\u0101n, in this fashion \u0646\u0627\u0646\u061b and thus with anything they wish to write, except things having no need of this transformation, which they write as pronounced.\"\n\nIt also appears from this passage that the Persians in the eighth century used Pahlavi in the same manner as the P\u0101rs\u012bs do now. When they wrote a word in Huzv\u0101rash they read it in P\u0101zand; and when a word was written in P\u0101zand, its pronunciation corresponded with the writing.\n\nProceeding now to apply the Pahlavi of the P\u0101rs\u012b books to the explanation of the Sassanian inscriptions, it is desirable to divide the inscriptions into three classes, the tri-lingual, the bi-lingual, and the mono-lingual; and it will be convenient to retain the numbers used by Mr. Thomas, although reason will be found for believing that the chronological order of the inscriptions is not quite in accordance with those numbers.\n\nThe inscriptions of the first class are tri-lingual, being in Greek and two dialects of Pahlavi, differing more widely in\n\n1 M. Ganneau reads this word \u0631\u06cc\u0633\u060c but the third letter in his facsimile is most probably r, as it seems too long for n, which is generally a very short stroke, in old MSS.\nthe forms of their letters than in their language. There are three inscriptions of this class, Nos. I., Ia., and IV.; and by means of the Greek version their meaning has long been known; it is therefore only necessary to transcribe them, with their translations, for the purpose of pointing out how far the Pahlavi versions correspond with the Pahlavi of the books. In these and future transcripts it is to be observed that the unaccented vowel \\(a\\) is not expressed in the original, being supplied merely to facilitate pronunciation; in many cases the short unexpressed vowel may have been originally \\(i\\) or \\(u\\) instead of \\(a\\); the syllable \\(m\u00e2n\\) indicates a compound final letter in the original, the sound of which will be hereafter considered; letters which are defective in the Pahlavi originals are italicised, and if in the Greek they are given in small letters; the beginnings of the lines of the original inscriptions are indicated by numbers; and the letters S. and C. indicate the Sassanian and Chald\u00e6o-Pahlavi versions respectively.\n\n**Inscription No. 1.**\n\nC. 1.

The letters in the inscriptions can be read either b\u016bm\u0101n or barm\u0101n, but the former will not bear etymological investigation, whereas the Sassanian 2 r or w has often been changed into the Pahlavi\nor \\( n \\), when it ought to have been changed into the Pahlavi \\( r \\), as in \\( kant \\) for \\( kart \\), \\( kanpak \\) for \\( karpak \\), \\( kanittunad \\) for \\( karttunad \\), all words of frequent occurrence in the books; so that \\( \\text{barman} \\) may safely be read \\( barman \\), if \\( banman \\) be not considered consistent with the inscriptions.\n\nThe words \\( zanm\u00e2n \\) and \\( barm\u00e2n \\) are both written with the compound final letter before alluded to, and which, it will be seen, corresponds in both these words with the Pahlavi compound \\( \\text{man} \\). Mr. Thomas is, however, of opinion that this compound letter in the inscriptions is either a long \\( t \\) or a double \\( t \\); but the only reasons he appears to give are: first, the resemblance of the Sassanian compound letter to the characters representing \\( t \\) in some other alphabets; second, the resemblance of the compound letter in the Chaldaeo-Pahlavi to two letters \\( t \\), of the same alphabet, joined together; third, the frequent occurrence of double \\( t \\) in transliterating Persian into a Chaldaean character, would probably lead to the adoption of a compound letter as its equivalent.\n\nWith regard to the first of these reasons, it may be observed that when two letters resemble each other in form, it is hazardous to assume that they also resemble each other in sound, whether they belong to the same alphabet or to different alphabets of the same family; thus, the letters \\( h \\) and \\( p \\) occur both in Latin and Greek, but with wholly different sounds; again, in Hebrew, the letters \\( \\aleph \\) and \\( \\beth \\), \\( \\aleph \\) and \\( \\beth \\), closely resemble each other in form, but widely differ in sound; it is therefore not safe to assume that the Sassanian compound letter \\( \\text{represents a long } t \\), merely because it resembles in form the long \\( t \\) of the Ph\u0153nician and Zand alphabets. With regard to the second reason, it appears to me just as probable that the Chaldaeo-Pahlavi compound letter was a union of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\), as of \\( t \\) and \\( t \\); thus, if the letters are run together, \\( \\text{resembles } \\text{as much as } \\text{does. And with regard to the third reason, it may reasonably be objected that the language of these inscriptions is not Persian, but that three-fourths of the words are Semitic, including all those containing the compound letter; and it has not been shown that a double } t \\text{ is }\nmore requisite in the Pahlav\u00ee of the inscriptions than in Chaldee, where it has not been adopted.\n\nBesides Mr. Thomas's reasons for reading these compound letters as long \\( t \\), there are two others to be considered before examining the evidence in favour of the syllable \\( man \\). There is, first, the positive fact that \\( barm\u00e2n \\), in the Sassanian version, always corresponds to \\( bart \\) in the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee; which tends to show a close relationship between \\( t \\) and the sound of the compound letter represented by \\( m\u00e2n \\); further examples of a similar nature are evidently requisite to strengthen this argument, but at present only three such examples are available; turning to the H\u00e2j\u00ee\u00e2b\u00e2d inscription, No.VI. (transcribed further on), it will be seen that \\( yadm\u00e2n \\) in the Sassanian version twice corresponds to \\( yadd\u00e2 \\) in the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee; this example therefore neutralizes the effect of the first one, as it tends to show that \\( m\u00e2n = \u00e2 \\); the next example is from the same inscription, where \\( h\u00fbm\u00e2n \\) in the Sassanian version corresponds twice to \\( haw\u00eend\u00ee \\) and once to \\( haw\u00eent \\) in the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee; striking off the \\( dt \\) and \\( t \\), as probable suffixes, this example gives \\( m\u00e2n = tn \\), which is not altogether impossible, especially as there is the further example of \\( lagalm\u00e2n \\) twice corresponding to \\( nagarin \\); however these examples so far neutralize each other as to show that no reliance can be placed upon this argument, in favour of the long \\( t \\) sound.\n\nSecondly, there is the negative fact that the words \\( man \\) and \\( man\u00fb \\) are not written with the compound character, as might be expected, if its proper sound were \\( man \\); to this it may be replied that there is good reason for supposing that these two words were sounded with the short vowel \\( i \\), thus, \\( min \\) and \\( min\u00fb \\), as they are now pronounced \\( min \\) and \\( min\u00fb \\). It is highly probable that (after the manner of all old Semitic alphabets) the short vowels \\( i \\) and \\( u \\) were not expressed, while the long \\( t \\) and \\( u \\) were represented by the consonants \\( y \\) and \\( w \\), which was certainly the case in many instances; there seems, therefore, no more reason to look for another form for \\( t \\) than for another form for \\( u \\). Besides \\( min \\) and \\( min\u00fb \\), in which the short vowel \\( i \\) may reasonably be understood, there is the Sassanian word \\( chatart \\), which was probably pronounced\nchitart, being derived from the Zand chithra, and corresponding to shthar in the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee. The distinction between i and t was probably not very certain, any more than it is in many words in modern Persian.\n\nThe evidence that these compound letters represent the Pahlav\u00ee final \ud802\udf69 (traditionally pronounced man), is overwhelming. In the inscriptions Nos. I. to X., as transcribed by Mr. Thomas, the Sassanian compound occurs 67 times and the Chald\u00e6o compound 20 times; of these, 61 of the Sassanian and 12 of the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee compounds occur in words that are well known from the Pahlav\u00ee books, and which are there written with the final \ud802\udf69; the words are as follows:\n\n| Word       | Occurrences |\n|------------|-------------|\n| zanm\u0101n     | 15          |\n| barm\u0101n     | 7           |\n| h\u016bm\u0101n      | 12          |\n| mam\u0101n      | 5           |\n| tamm\u0101n     | 1           |\n| napshm\u0101n   | 2           |\n| napsm\u0101n    | id.         |\n| banapshm\u0101n | 1           |\n| walm\u0101n     | 7           |\n| yadm\u0101n     | 2           |\n| lagalm\u0101n   | 2           |\n| lanm\u0101n     | 4           |\n| gadm\u0101n     | 2           |\n\nOf these, the word barm\u0101n in Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee is a mistake; Mr. Thomas having written, through oversight, bar-m\u0101n, \u2018son,\u2019 for bart-la-bart, \u2018son\u2019s son,\u2019 in inscription No IV.; the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee h\u016bm\u0101n, in inscription No. III. xxx. 4, is also a doubtful reading.\nOf the remaining fourteen words, with the compound final letters, six are readily recognised as common Semitic words with the compound affixed, and some of the remainder are probably errors of the copyist.\n\nIn the Pahlav\u00ee-P\u00e2zand Glossary, before mentioned, there are 53 words having the termination \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) added to a common Semitic word; they are names of most parts of the body, of some of the degrees of relationship, of some animals and a few other nouns in common use, with some pronouns, prepositions, and adverbs, and the substantive verb 'to be.' These are precisely the words most likely to be indigenous in a language, and the additional words, found in the inscriptions with this final, appear to be of the same class. The termination \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) is therefore probably a very old one.\n\nIt can scarcely be now disputed, that the Pahlav\u00ee compound \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) is the modern representative of the compound letters in the inscriptions which are under consideration; but the proper pronunciation of \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) is still an open question; in any other position, it could only be pronounced man, or m\u00fb, or possibly mar (allowing for the occasional interchange of \\( w \\) and \\( r \\)); but there is still the bare possibility that it may be a distinct letter, having no connection with \\( \\text{\u0161} + \\text{i} \\) (\\( m + n \\)), but the direct descendant of the compound letter of the Sassanian inscriptions, which has gradually approximated to the form of \\( \\text{\u0161} \\), until it has become identically the same; in this case, its correct pronunciation appears to be quite indeterminate, except from etymology, which fails, as yet, to give any satisfactory solution. It will be shown hereafter that the Pahlav\u00ee handwriting of the ninth century scarcely differed from that of the present day (as might indeed have been guessed from the two Pahlav\u00ee words given by Ibn Muqaffa), and the particle \\( \\text{\u0161} \\) was then written precisely with the same form as at present, in the word \\( \\text{\u0161} \\text{i} \\text{\u0161} \\text{w} \\text{h} \\text{u} \\text{m} \\text{\u0101} \\text{n} \\text{am} \\), 'I am.'\n\n1 They are called final merely for the sake of convenience, as in all words containing them, that have yet been identified, they are found to be final; h\u00e2m\u00e2nam is no real exception to this rule, as its termination is merely a suffix added to the original word h\u00e2m\u00e2n. But exceptions may hereafter be discovered.\nOn the whole, it appears necessary to adhere to the traditional pronunciation of the particle \\( \\text{\\textit{man}} \\), until some other can be satisfactorily shown to be correct.\n\nReturning to the tri-lingual inscriptions, it may be observed that the words \\( \\text{\\textit{manu chatai}} \\) or \\( \\text{\\textit{manu shthar}} \\) might also be translated 'heavenly-faced,' if it were not for the corresponding Greek \\( \\text{\\textit{exyevoiv}} \\); they still survive in the common P\u0101rsi name Mancharji, usually written Muncherjee. With regard to the other words in these inscriptions, I need add nothing to what is stated in the vocabulary at the end of this paper.\n\nThe only bi-lingual inscriptions are those from H\u0101ji\u0101b\u0101d and P\u0101t K\u016bl\u012b, Nos. VI. and III.; in these, the two versions of the ancient Pahlav\u012b might be expected to assist each other in explaining their meaning, as Oriental translations are usually very literal, and this is found to be the case in No. VI.; but the detached fragments of No. III. have no point of contact (unless it be between xxix. 3, and x. 5, or xxii. 6), they can therefore be treated only as fragments of two separate inscriptions.\n\nThe bi-lingual inscription No. VI. has long been a stumbling-block to Pahlav\u012b scholars; with the exception of two or three words, the first four lines are verbatim the same as inscription No. IV., being a recital of the name, titles, and genealogy of the king; and so far, the meaning was perfectly clear fifteen years ago; but in the fifth line some narrative begins, and here the interpreters at once fall into difficulties. Mr. Thomas has made a bold attempt to solve these difficulties, and has offered a translation, remarkable for its unexpected meaning, for the absence of verbs, and for the number of different Pahlav\u012b words expressed by the one English word, 'Lord.' But although it is easy to see that this translation is not satisfactory, it is not so easy to offer another interpretation, which shall be at the same time complete, and also give a correct explanation of every word; as in order to complete the translation it may be requisite to make a few hazardous guesses, after exhausting all the certainties available.\n\nIn the first place, it is necessary to settle the text of the\ninscription, in doing which Mr. Thomas's photograph has been of great assistance, although he appears to have somewhat neglected it himself. In the following transcript (as in the others) the letters S. and C. indicate the Sassanian and Chaldean-Pahlavi versions respectively, the numbers indicate the beginnings of the lines, and imperfect or doubtful letters are italicized.\n\nH\u00e2j\u00ee\u00e2b\u00e2d Inscription, No. VI.\n\nC. 1.

The meaning of shaddt is also better taken from the Chaldee root \u0283 \u2018to\nthrow, cast.' The following words are likewise found in the book Pahlav\u00ee:\n\nwa = 1 and.  \nhat = \u1e25at if.  \nl\u016bnt = \u1e25\u016bnt before.  \nbil\u016bnt = \u1e25\u016bnt outside.  \ndikt = \u1e0dik\u1e6d hollow(probably) man\u016b = \u1e6d\u0101n spiritual, invisible.  \nhaty\u0101 = \u1e25\u0101\u1e6d arrow.  \n\u0101k\u0101st = \u1e0d\u0101k\u0101st knowing, intelligent.  \nbar\u0101 = bal\u0101 = \u1e0d\u0101l without.  \nnapalt = \u1e63\u0101l to fall.  \nh\u016bb = h\u016bp = gh\u016b? that, him, it.\n\nThe amount of correspondence between the Pahlav\u00ee of the books, and that of these inscriptions, can now be estimated. In the hitherto unintelligible part of the inscriptions, twenty-three words out of eighty-seven in the Chald\u00e6o version, and sixty-five words out of eighty-eight in the Sassanian version, have been identified as occurring in the Pahlav\u00ee books; and these identifications include nearly all the words which would be considered as characteristic of the language of the inscriptions. The identity, therefore, of the Huzv\u00e2rash of the Pahlav\u00ee books, with the language used officially by the Sassanian kings, may now be considered to be established.\n\nThe next step in the interpretation of these inscriptions, is to fix the meanings of such of the remaining words, as present no difficulty, or cause for doubt; these are as follows:\n\nlan, 'us;' in C. 10, corresponds to lanm\u0101n in S. 11; Chald. \u1e0d\u0101l.\n\n\u0101dtn, 'then;' Chald. \u1e0d\u0101l; corresponds in C. 10 to \u0101har in S. 11; the dot under the d in C. 10 is very clear in the photograph, and forbids it being read k, as Mr. Thomas wishes it should be.\n\nrab\u0101n, 'lords, nobles;' Chald. \u1e0d\u0101l; the sing. \u1e0d\u0101l 'great, eminent,' occurs in the Pahl.-P\u00e2z. Gloss.\n\n\u0101y\u0101tan, 'mighty ones, warriors;' Heb. \u1e0d\u0101l.\n\nnagarin, 'feet;' corresponds to lagalm\u0101n.\n\npatan, 'in;' corresponds to pavan. Dr. Haug prefers reading this word as p\u0101w\u0101n, considering it merely as a variant of pavan. Compare, however, Heb. \u1e0d\u0101l.\nwtm, 'pit;' Zand wa\u0113m.\n\nla, 'to, for, at, of;' Chald. \u1e25.\n\nht\u012b, 'him, it, that;' corresponds to sak; Chald. \u1e63\u0101k. In the photograph there is some appearance of b being interlined above the end of this word; if this be added to the word, it becomes h\u016bb, the same as its synonym below.\n\n\u00e2nt\u012b, 'that, thus;' corresponds to dik; perhaps Chald. \u1e0dik.\n\nhawntnd, havntdt, havntnt = hawtn + suffixes, 'is;' corresponds to h\u016bm\u0101n in S. 10, 12.\n\n\u0101tarm\u0101n, 'a place;' Chald. \u1e63\u0101r\u0101m\u0101n.\n\nyah\u016bt, 'is, are;' corresponds to yahw\u016bn; Chald. aor. of \u1e63\u0101w\u016bn.\n\n\u0101upadasht, 'ordered;' corresponds to parm\u0101t; Mr. Thomas proposes the Sanskrit \u0905\u092a\u0926\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d.\n\nkal, 'to, into;' corresponds to wal.\n\nh\u016bb, 'him, it, that;' corresponds to sak, and has been already doubtfully identified with the Pahlav\u012b gh\u016b. Prof. Westergaard's copy, which is generally very correct, reads hat, in both occurrences of this word, C. 12, 13; M. Flandin's copy, which is much less trustworthy, reads hu in C. 12, and hati in C. 13; Mr. Thomas reads hu in both places; the photograph plainly shows, that the final stroke of Prof. Westergaard's t, in C. 13, is a defect in the rock surface, and that the letter is u followed by a tolerably distinct b: and in C. 12, the u is quite plain, while a faint trace of the b is visible in an unmounted copy of the photograph (with which I have been favoured by Mr. Thomas), but has generally been cut off in the mounted copies.\n\nh\u016bp, 'him, it, that;' corresponds to walm\u0101n. A variant of h\u016bb, which tends to confirm the existence of the final b.\n\n\u0101k, 'if;' corresponds to hat; Chald. \u1e25\u0101t.\n\nbant\u012b, 'built;' Chald. \u1e25\u0101nt\u012b.\n\nchit\u012b, 'built;' corresponds to bant\u012b; Sanskrit \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d.\n\nshad\u012bu, 'threw, cast;' Chald. \u1e63\u0101d\u016b; corresponds to shaddtan, a different form of the same verb.\n\ny\u0101maz\u016bd, 'bring, cause to arrive;' Chald. \u1e63\u0101maz\u016bd; corresponds to lamittan.\nThe ascertained meanings have now been extended to 65 words out of 87 in the Chaldaeo version, and to 73 out of 88 in the Sassanian version. The meanings of the remaining words, are either less obvious, or the readings are uncertain, or open to dispute.\n\nkaraz\u0101w\u0101 and tagal\u0101ht must be synonymous; the reading of the first is rather uncertain, especially the final letter; Mr. Thomas reads it patkaltn, but is contradicted by his photograph, in which a medial \u0101 is very plain; his reading of patgal\u0101ht, in the Sassanian version, is a less hazardous guess, but the word has no appearance of being a plural. These words are probably abstract nouns, derived from Semitic roots, similar to the Chaldee \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9 'to proclaim, promulgate,' and \u05e0\u05b8\u05dc\u05b9\u05d0 'to uncover, reveal;' and may be translated as 'proclamation, publication, or edict.'\n\nharary\u0101 corresponds to haty\u0101, and must therefore have the meaning of 'arrow, javelin;' it has not, however, been clearly traced to any Semitic root, and its orthography is uncertain, as either r may be read k. Dr. Haug thinks it may be simply a variant of haty\u0101, and to be read haddy\u0101; singularly enough, Mr. Thomas adopts the same reading, but attributes a very different meaning to the word, of which he seems to consider haty\u0101 the variant; this reading is, however, not borne out by the photograph, which shows the medial letters perfectly clear, in four occurrences of the word, without the vestige of a dot under either r, which would change it to a d, and it is only in the first occurrence of the word, where the letters are not very clear, that there is a faint and uncertain trace of one dot; the engraver might possibly omit the dot in one, or two, instances, as he appears to have done under the final letter of hawtnd in C. 8, but he would scarcely repeat the blunder eight times, and always in the same word; there seems also to be no satisfactory reason for the d being doubled. It appears, therefore, unsafe to alter the reading of hararya, except by the substitution of k for either r.\n\nqadmatm\u0101n is readily identified with the Chaldee \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b0\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9.\n'before,' and corresponds to *l\u00fant*. Mr. Thomas would read it to correspond with \u062e\u062f\u0645\u062a\u064a, but the initial letter, which occurs only in this word and *haq\u00e1im\u00fat*, appears in both cases, to correspond better with \u067e than with \u0646.\n\n*yahalk\u00e1n* is a doubtful reading, the rock-surface being defective; but as it corresponds to *rab\u00e1n*, its meaning must be 'lords, nobles.'\n\n*haq\u00e1im\u00fat*, with its variant *haq\u00e1im\u00fad*, must be related to the Hebrew \u05e0\u05b4\u05e2\u05b0\u05e8\u05b8\u05d4 'to stand,' hiphil \u05de\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e8 'to erect, establish, set, cause to stand;' as already determined by Mr. Thomas, although he reads the second letter as \u0646, instead of \u067e. It corresponds to *hanah\u00fatun*.\n\n*had*, with its corresponding *chad*, may be the equivalent of the Arabic \u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651 'boundary, limit,' or of the Chaldee \u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u0651 'side.' M. Flandin reads *had* in both versions, but his copy is less trustworthy than that of Prof. Westergaard, who reads *chad* in the Sassanian version.\n\n*chit\u00e1k, chit\u00e1kt*, with its corresponding *shitt*, is one of the leading words in the inscription, and appears to be Arian. Mr. Thomas derives it from the Zand *khsha\u00e9ta*, 'king;' but this meaning is not reconcileable with the context. It is evidently the name of something, at which a *haty\u00e1*, or javelin, could be thrown, see S. 7, 8, 13, 14, 15; it is also something that can be built, or formed, see C. 9, 10, 11; which latter fact is also shown, by the correspondence of the analogous word *chitt*, to *bant*. The Sanskrit \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935 'a dwelling,' and \u0938\u094d\u0924\u092e\u094d\u092d 'monument, heap of stones' (the P\u0101li *chaitya* of the Buddhists) present themselves as possible meanings, especially the latter, as *chiti* could be derived from the same root \u0935\u093f\u0936\u094d\u0935 'to collect in a heap.' But it will be safest to retain the original word *chit\u00e1k* without translation, till further light can be thrown upon its meaning.\n\n*bish, way\u00e1k*, and *\u00e1rg\u00fan* can only be guessed at, as the two versions differ in this passage, the general sense of which, however is tolerably clear.\n\n*shadadr\u00e1* is also very uncertain; one guess might connect it with the Chaldee \u05de\u05b4\u05e0\u05b0\u05e2\u05b8\u05e8 'to send;' another might derive it from the Zand *khshathr\u00f3*, 'kingdom, rule.'\npanmdn may be connected with the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'before, inside.'\nsatar may, perhaps, be traced to the Hebrew \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'an enclosure, hiding-place.'\n\n\u0101\u016blandalt appears to correspond to the last two words taken together; it may probably be divisible into two words, the former of which may perhaps have some connection with the Hebrew root \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'to surround, enclose.'\n\n\u0101\u016bt is the word read \u0101\u016bs by Mr. Thomas, and which appears to have suggested the whole theory of his translation; the last letter is damaged and obscure, but is very probably a t, resembling in form the final letter of haq\u0101im\u016bt, in C. 7. This word, from its position, can scarcely be either a noun, or a verb, but most probably a pronoun, or conjunction. One guess would connect it with the Chaldee \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'again, further;' another guess would identify it with the Zand awad, 'that, such;' in which case it would be better written \u0101wat. The Zand word aw\u0101ntem does actually occur in the Pahlav\u012b books, under the form \u0101w\u0101ntem.\n\nkadab = katab has been rather difficult to read, although occurring twice; in the Sassanian version it is written with one unknown compound letter prefixed to the b; this compound letter resembles y, or t, written above k, or n, but may be considered quite indeterminate. In the Chald\u00e6o version, the final b is clear in both occurrences of the word, and is evidently preceded by two other letters, neither of which is very legible in the photograph, though in C. 11 the second looks like a k, and as Prof. Westergaard reads r for the first letter, the word was first read as rakab, which seemed inconsistent with the context; on further examination of the photograph, a dot was discovered under the second letter of the word in C. 11, showing that it is a d, similar to that in havindt in C. 9; and the first letter may be taken as a k, similar to that in kal in C. 12; these letters give the reading kadab, a variant of katab, which is identical with the Chaldee \u05d9\u05b8\u05d3\u05b7\u05e2 'to engrave, write,' and is consistent with the context. The unknown letter in the Sassanian version may probably be a compound of k and t.\n\n\u0101tr, corresponding to htp, occurs also in other inscriptions,\nand appears always to precede a verb; it is, therefore, probably an adverb, and Dr. Haug understands it as a prohibitive negative. Perhaps it should be read \u0101y\u0101, or \u0101tv, approximating to the corresponding htp, and may be connected with the Chaldee 'N.\n\nAll the words, in both versions of the inscription, having now been considered, it is necessary to offer a connected translation of the whole, as literal as may be compatible with its being intelligible, and with all the doubtful words italicized. Such a translation, with the two versions in parallel columns, is here given.\n\n**TRANSLATION OF THE H\u0100J\u012a\u0100B\u0100D INSCRIPTION.**\n\n**Chaldeo-Pahlav\u012b Version.**\n\nA proclamation, this, of me, the Mazda-worshipping, divine Shahtp\u016bhar, king of the kings of the Arians and non-Arians, of spiritual origin from God; son of the Mazda-worshipping, divine Artahshatar, king of the kings of the Arians, of spiritual origin from God; son's son of divine P\u0101pak, the king. And when by us this javelin was cast, before the satraps, the chieftains, the nobles and the warriors it was cast; the feet in that cave were set, and the javelin to the side of that chit\u0101k outwards was thrown; within there that the javelin fell, for its existence a place was not; so if a chit\u0101k be built, to the outer world it has become known. Then we ordered: \"a spiritual chit\u0101k inside an enclosure is built, again a spiritual hand has written, 'the feet in this cave never set, and a javelin at that chit\u0101k never cast, the spiritual javelin to that chit\u0101k is brought;' of that the hand has written.\"\n\n**Sassanian Pahlav\u012b Version.**\n\nA declaration, this, of me, the Mazda-worshipping, divine Shahp\u016bhrl, king of the kings of Ir\u0101n and non-Ir\u0101n, of spiritual origin from God; son of the Mazda-worshipping, divine Artahshatar, king of the kings of Ir\u0101n, of spiritual origin from God; grandson of divine P\u0101pak\u012b, the king. Also we, when this javelin we cast, then we before the satraps, and the chieftains, and the nobles, and the warriors we cast; also we a foot in this cave placed, and also we the javelin to the side of, and that chit\u0101k beyond, threw; without that place that the javelin we threw, there the place of that weapon was not; so if a chit\u0101k be built, then abroad it has become known. Afterwards we ordered: \"a spiritual chit\u0101k enclosed by me is built, a spiritual hand has written, 'that foot in this cave never place, and a javelin at that chit\u0101k never cast, after the spiritual javelin at that chit\u0101k is thrown;' that the hand wrote.\"\nThe above translation has purposely been kept as close to the original idiom as was possible, without rendering it unintelligible; but it would be easy to render it into idiomatical English, without many alterations, except in the positions of the words. The inscription appears to record, that the king, in the presence of his chief officers, threw a javelin outwards from the mouth of the cave, when the javelin disappeared, and the king choosing to consider that it had miraculously become invisible (man\u016b = 112), ordered a chit\u0101k to be constructed, to commemorate the event; and he also stated that an invisible hand had written an order, that no one thenceforth was to enter the cave, or to throw javelins there. No bow being mentioned, the weapon was more probably a javelin than an arrow; but the verbs can be used for 'shooting,' as well as for 'throwing.'\n\nThe real starting-point of the above interpretation was Dr. Haug's identification of haty\u0101 with the Pahlavi \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65\ud802\udf67\ud802\udf69, 'an arrow;' this word corresponded so well with the known meanings of the verbs, that further progress in the interpretation was comparatively easy and straight-forward. I had previously been trying to take haty\u0101 as equivalent to the Chaldee \u071f\u0710\u0726\u0710 'a sinner,' with the idea that the inscription might record some great public punishment, or execution; but I could make no satisfactory progress on that supposition.\n\nIf any one, unacquainted with the subject, should compare this translation with that proposed by Mr. Thomas, he will naturally infer, from their total dissimilarity, that no confidence can be placed in either, and his faith in the decipherment of other ancient inscriptions may be severely shaken. It therefore seems necessary to point out, that in arriving at this translation, the progress has been steadily from the known to the unknown; the meanings of at least half the words are absolutely certain, and very few are absolutely doubtful, and these are scrupulously indicated; any reasonable alterations of these, and perhaps of most of the words not absolutely certain, would probably not much alter the general tenor of the\ntranslation, so long as they did not make it unintelligible; but there is room for improvement in the details, which are here only imperfectly worked out.\n\nWith regard to the construction of the sentences, it will be observed that the verb comes last, following both its subject and object; but this was a characteristic of the Assyrian, so far as it is known from the cuneiform inscriptions, as well as of the Persian; so that no conclusion as to the relationship of the language can be safely drawn from this fact.\n\nThe verbal inflections seem scarcely reducible to any system. In the Sassanian version the terminations of *shaditan*, *lamtian*, *hanahtun* and *yahwun* appear to be all Semitic, though perhaps not always of the same person as the nominative; *parm\u00e1t* and *chitit*, being Arian words, have Arian terminations. In the Chaldaeo-Pahlavi version, the terminations of *shadit*, *ramit*, *napalt*, and *banit* may possibly be Semitic (as that of *shadt\u00fa* certainly is), but it is also possible that we have here early instances of the anomalous practice of writing an Iranian termination to a Semitic verb, which we have seen is now constantly done in the Pahlavi books; such must certainly be the case in the verbs *haq\u00e1itmut* = *haq\u00e1itmid*, *y\u00e1maz\u00fad*, *yah\u00fat*, and *havint* = *hawtnd* = *hawwindi*; while in *\u00e1upadasht* we have a verb purely Arian. On the whole, and pending further inquiry, it appears probable that the verbs had not only almost lost their Semitic powers of inflection, generally retaining only one form; but that they were also beginning to be written with Arian terminations, of which, however, we find only that of the third person, or past participle, in this inscription; the final *t=* *d* being the *t*, and the *tt=* *dt* being the *t* of the Pahlavi books; for there seems little doubt that the frequent final *t* of the Sassanian inscriptions is often the representative of the equally frequent final *t* of the Pahlavi books, which Mr. Thomas considers a \"superfluous n\u00fan.\"\n\nProceeding next to the other bi-lingual inscription No. III. it will be sufficient to point out a few identifications that may have escaped Mr. Thomas, among these detached fragments, as follows:\nshatart, i. 3 and elsewhere, appears to be the Pahlavi \u0634\u0627\u062a\u0631 'a town,' which ought to be read shatr\u00fa.\n\nshaptl, i. 5, must be the common Pahlavi word \u0634\u067e\u062a 'good.'\n\nzi \u0101halm\u0101n wa shtd\u0101n, iii. 2, in Pahl. \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0645\u0646 \u0648 \u0634\u062f\u0622\u0646 'that (is) of Aharmen and the devils,' indicates that religion is one subject-matter of this inscription.\n\nwahd\u016bn, iii. 5, is possibly the Semitic portion of the Pahlavi verb \u0648\u062d\u062f\u0646 'to do.'\n\nwalm\u0101n, iii. 5 and xiv. 5 = \u0648\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 'that, him, it,' as in No. VI.\n\nwal, vi. 5 and elsewhere = \u0648 'to.'\n\nlab\u0101, ix. 3 and elsewhere = \u0644\u0628 'great, noble.'\n\nlanm\u0101n ix. 4, x. 2. and xi. 2 = \u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646 'we, us.'\n\nnapshm\u0101n, xiv. 3, and xxvi. 2 = \u0646\u0634\u0645\u0646 'self.'\n\ngadm\u0101n, xv. 2, and xxii. 4 = \u063a\u062f\u0645\u0627\u0646 'splendour, lustre.' This is the probable reading of the word: see Mr. Thomas's note 2, p. 285 of vol. iii.\n\nbanapshm\u0101n, xv. 5 = \u0628\u0646\u0627\u0628\u0634\u0645\u0646 'own.'\n\nh\u016bchm\u0101n, xvii. 2, is one of the few words ending in m\u0101n which have not been traced to the Pahlavi of the books; perhaps the reading might be altered.\n\nmalk\u0101 man\u016b tan ntk yahw\u016bn = \u0645\u0644\u0643 \u0645\u0646\u0648 \u062a\u0646 \u0646\u062a\u0643 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0648\u0646 'the king's spiritual body is pure,' seems a better reading of xvii. 5, than that proposed by Mr. Thomas.\n\nl\u0101 yahw\u016bn, xviii. 2 = \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0647\u0648\u0648\u0646 'are not;' follows yalk\u016bn, which appears to be a verb.\n\nh\u016bm\u0101n, xxii. 1, and xxx. 4 = \u0647\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646 'was.'\n\nlab\u0101 wa ay\u0101t, xxiii. 4, may be compared with rab\u0101n wa ay\u0101tan in the H\u0101j\u012babad inscription, C. 6.\n\nshamam\u0101n, xxiv. 6, and xxix. 4, is an additional instance of\na common Semitic word, with the disputed termination *mdn*, which has been dropped in the Pahlavi books, where the word appears in the form 'name.'\n\n*yah\u00fat*, xxv. 5, is the Chaldaeo correspondent to *yahw\u00fan* = 'are,' in No. VI.; but the context here is doubtful.\n\n*hag\u00e1tm\u00fa*, xxvi. 3, 'made to stand;' see No. VI., C. 7, 12; the correct reading of this line may be *hag\u00e1tm\u00fad, \u0101b hashatardar\u00edn*; and this 'father of the satraps,' may have been the prime minister.\n\n*mamdn*, xxvii. 2, and xxix. 4, = 'which, who.'\n\n*havctndt* may perhaps be read in xxvii. 5, as in No. VI. C. 9, 10.\n\n*karm\u00e1n*, xxx. 7 and xxxi. 6, is another unidentified word ending in *m\u00e1n*; unless it can be read *barm\u00e1n*.\n\nWith regard to the date of this inscription, it may be observed that the use of *l* for *r* in *labt*, compared with *rab\u00e1n* in No. VI. C. 6, and of *d* for *t* in *yazd\u00e1n*, are slight indications of a later date; the title *malk\u00e1n malk\u00e1* occurring twice, and the names of *Shahtp\u00fahar* and *\u0100tharamazdt* likewise occurring (the latter possibly followed by *Shahtp\u00fahar*, with some affix meaning 'son of'), also tend towards fixing a rather later date than that of No. VI.; but at the same time, it must be observed, that these data are all rather uncertain.\n\nThe remaining inscriptions occur only in the Sassanian character; they are Nos. II., V. and VII. to XII.; of these, No. V. is very imperfect, although it has been by far the longest of all. It appears from M. Flandin's copy, that only the latter part of each line is now legible, and even that is very imperfect towards the lower part of the inscription; the letters that he gives, cover barely one-half of the space he shows in his copy, and this again is less than one-half of the whole space, apparently prepared for the inscription, on the bas-relief. Having therefore less than one-fourth of the letters, and a great part of these only in a very incoherent state, little more can be done than to identify a few words which may have escaped Mr. Thomas; fortunately, spaces occur between most of the words, which render this\ninscription easier to read than No. II., so far as the letters extend.\n\nWith regard to the date of inscription No. V., it may be observed, that the title of the sovereign, *malk\u00e2n malk\u00e2*, occurs six times; thrice in connection with the name *Shahpuhr*, in lines 1, 2, 6; with the name *\u0100huramazd\u0101*, in line 9; with a lost name in line 15; and probably in line 40, with the name *Walahl\u0101n*, which likewise occurs in line 33, without a legible title, but preceded by the epithet *b\u016bht l\u016bb\u0101n* = 'liberated soul,' applied only to deceased persons. There is, therefore, reason to suppose that this inscription dates from some short time after the death of Varahr\u0101n I.\n\n*wal sam\u00e2t wa h\u016b-k\u0101mak\u012b*, l. 1 may possibly be *wa h\u016b-k\u0101mak\u012b*, 'to heaven and good desire.'\n\n*hautan*, l. 1, 2, appears to be a more regular Semitic form than *y\u014d* 'to be,' which latter is not found in this inscription; compare *hawnt*, No. VI. C. 11.\n\n*kalti*, l. 2 and elsewhere, = *ma\u0111* = *ma\u0111* 'made, done.'\n\n*wal shatari gir\u0101k wal gir\u0101k kab\u012br kaltak\u0101n z\u012b yazd\u0101n \u0101pza\u0142ih* (or *\u0101pd\u0101dihi*), appears to be a sentence frequently repeated, comparing l. 4, 11, 17, and 31, and part of it occurs in l. 13; it may doubtfully be read, 'to the city of the captive, to the great captive of the deeds that (are) of the God of liberality.' Mr. Thomas connects *wal* with the Arabic article \u0644\u0650\u0644\u064e\u0651\u0670\u0653, but the initial *w* or *u* is usually the representative of \u0644\u064e\u0651, and the word is therefore to be traced to the Chaldee \u0644\u064e\u0651; but in Pahlav\u012b it does not mean 'on, over,' as in most Semitic languages, but it is confined to the meanings 'to, for,' and suchlike, which are rare meanings for \u0644\u064e\u0651, and are commonly represented by the Chaldee \u0644\u064e\u0651 or \u0644\u064e\u0651. *Kaltak\u0101n* must be the plural of the common Pahlav\u012b word *ma\u0111* = *ma\u0111* 'an action;' the relative *z\u012b*, Chaldee \u0644\u064e\u0651, is here seen approximating in use to the Persian *idh\u0101fat*, of which it was possibly the origin; none of the final *t's* in these inscriptions appear to represent the *idh\u0101fat*, as they seem to be inseparable finals, and without reference to the\nposition of the words. *Aps\u0101lht* is one of a class of abstract nouns ending in *iht*, which is not uncommon in these inscriptions; in the book-Pahlavi there is a similar class of words ending in \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65 or \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65, traditionally pronounced *eshn*; now if the Sassanian *iht* be written in the Pahlavi character it becomes \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65, as the Sassanian final *t* is generally represented by the Pahlavi final *u*; there is therefore some reason to suppose that the final \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65 of abstract verbal nouns, so common in the book-Pahlavi, ought to be pronounced *thu*; but until some particular Pahlavi noun of this class can be identified in the inscriptions, it will be hazardous to adopt this alteration of the traditional pronunciation.\n\n*hattm\u00fcn*, l. 5, *hattmund*, l. 18, *hattmunt*, l. 32, correspond to the Pahlavi verb \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65\ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65\ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65 \u2018to fill, pour,\u2019 according to the Pahl.-P\u00e2z. Gloss.\n\n*mam\u00e4n=* \u2018who, which,\u2019 and *walm\u00e4n=* \u2018that, he, him, it,\u2019 l. 7, are the only words ending with the final *m\u00e4n* which are to be found in this inscription.\n\n*napasht* yakuimunt \u0101\u012bk, l. 8 = \ud802\udf60\ud802\udf65 \u2018was written thus.\u2019\n\n*\u0101tharpat*, l. 8 =  \u2018a priest, a herbad;\u2019 from the Zand *\u0101thra-paiti*.\n\n*\u0101pam*, l. 9 =  \u2018also I.\u2019\n\n*hamg\u016bnaki*, l. 10, 15, 16 =  \u2018the same kind.\u2019\n\n*wazlunt*, l. 14, corresponds to the Pahlavi verb  \u2018to become, go.\u2019\n\n*man\u016b\u00e1n*, l. 14, appears to be the plural of  \u2018spirit.\u2019\n\n*yahmat\u016bn* probably occurs in l. 28, and may perhaps correspond with the Pahlavi  \u2018to arrive.\u2019\n\n*mag\u016bpat*, l. 33 =  \u2018a priest, a mobed.\u2019\n\nWith regard to the verbs in this inscription; the introduction of the Iranian terminations into the writing appears to have advanced a step further than in inscription No. VI.; there the terminations *t*, *d*, added to Semitic verbs, were\nconfined to the Chaldee-Pahlavi; here they appear in the Sassanian Pahlavi, although not added to every verb. The termination \\( m \\), of the 1st person singular, also occurs once, added to the conjunction \\( dp \\), in the word \\( dpam \\).\n\nInscription No. II. will probably be found to be the most important of the Sassanian inscriptions, when an intelligible copy of it is obtained, as it evidently treats of religious matters, and appears to be fairly legible on the original rock, and complete, except two or three words, which can be readily guessed, when the context is understood. M. Flandin's copyist appears here, as elsewhere, to have trusted to his eyes alone, with the usual result of confounding similar letters, especially in the upper part of the inscription, which was probably farther from his eyes than the lower part. No satisfactory copy of a rock-inscription can be obtained, unless the fingers are frequently used to confirm the evidence of the eyes; the former are rarely deceived in ascertaining the shape of a letter, but the latter often are.\n\nSome of the words that can be determined with tolerable certainty, in inscription No. II., are as follows:\n\n\\( kartir \\), l. 1 and elsewhere, may perhaps mean 'crown,' as Mr. Thomas suggests; but of the remainder of the first line, only the next word \\( bagi \\), and \\( man yazdan \\) at the end, can be satisfactorily made out; although the latter may possibly be preceded by \\( manu chaturt \\). The space between \\( bagi \\) and \\( manu chaturt \\) is usually occupied by the name of the king and his other titles; but in this case the intermediate letters fail to give the name of any known king, and the title \\( malkan malka \\) cannot be read among them by any ordinary process.\n\n\\( waslunt \\), l. 2, corresponds to the Pahlavi verb \\( \\text{\u0628\u064e\u0644\u064e\u063a\u064e} \\), 'to become, go.'\n\n\\( yasdan \\), l. 3 and elsewhere; the orthography of this word in inscriptions II., III., and V., is another indication of a later date than that of inscriptions I., IV., and VI., in which it is spelt \\( yastan \\); all the later inscriptions, VII. to XII., have \\( yazdan \\).\n\n\\( wahshti wa dushahwt \\), l. 4, 5, and 8 = \\( \\text{\u0647\u064e\u064a\u064e\u0651\u0627 \u0648\u064e \u062f\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0627\u0647\u064e\u0648\u0652\u062a} \\), 'heaven and hell.'\nmam\u0101n, h\u016bm\u0101n and yahw\u016bn occur in line 6, and sanm\u0101n in line 10.\n\nyahw\u016bn h\u016bm\u0101nam, wa pavan napshm\u0101n, l. 11, = 'I have been, and in my own;'\n\nyahw\u016bn h\u016bm\u0101nam, wa madam sanm\u0101n, l. 11, 12, = 'I have been, and on this;'\n\nyahw\u016bn h\u016bm\u0101nam, l. 13, = 'I have been;'\n\nzak pavan yazd\u0101n, l. 14, = 'that in God;'\n\nwa nasasm\u0101n l\u016bb\u0101n l\u0101tt wa datt, l. 14, 15, = 'and the prayer of the soul of the liberal and just;' are all phrases similar to the language of the books.\n\nmam\u0101n = 'who, which,' occurs again in lines 16 and 17.\n\n\u0101tk w\u0101hsh\u012bt \u0101tti wa d\u016bsahw\u012b \u0101tti, l. 17, 18, = 'thus, a heaven (there) is, and a hell (there) is.'\n\nwal w\u0101hsh\u012bt wazl\u016bnt, l. 18, 19, = 'to heaven went.'\n\nman\u016b bachak l\u012b zak wal d\u016bshahw\u012b lamittan, wa man\u016b kalp kalt h\u016bm\u0101n, wa madam kalp kart bar sasit\u0101nt walm\u0101n la-zanmdnl 19, 20, = 'the spirit of sin I that to hell threw, and the spirit karfa has done; and on karfa (being) done, the fruit went forth, him to this.'\n\nyahmat\u016bnt \u0101pash walm\u0101n \u0101st\u016bnd\u012b, l. 21, = 'arrived, also he saw him.'\n\nmanam yahmat\u016bnt, chig\u016bn l\u012b kartir yahmat\u016bn, \u0101pam sanm\u0101n n\u0101makl, l. 21, 22, = 'from me arrived, how to me the crown arrived, also I this writing.'\nwa napashti \u00e2tk mam\u00e2n li, l. 22, 23, = \u06f1\u06f3\u06f4\u06f9 aigh \u06f1\u06f2\u06f0-\u06f1\u06f2\u06f1\n\u2018and wrote thus, who to me.\u2019\n\nman shataldar\u00e2n, l. 23, \u2018from the satraps.\u2019\n\n\u00e2pam dabtr napsm\u00e2n sam, l. 24, = \u06f1\u06f3\u06f4\u06f9 \u0627\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u06f1\u06f2\u06f0-\u06f1\u06f2\u06f1\n\u2018also I, the writer, my own name.\u2019\n\nThe latter part of the inscription may perhaps be read continuously, but with some reservation, as follows, italicising merely the doubtful readings:\n\nLine 26. . . . . . . . . . . . . . \u0101haraz n\u00e2mak\u00ee hazitant, zak 27.\n\nyakartt\u00e2nt \u00e2ik, \u00e2nm\u00e2n zak kart\u00eer; h\u00fbm\u00e2nam z\u00ee Shahp\u00fbhri malk\u00e2n malk\u00e2 kart, sham 28. mag\u00fbpat wa \u00e2\u00eeharpat R\u00fbm kal\u00eet h\u00fbm\u00e2nam, wa \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee malk\u00e2n malk\u00e2, wa Wanahl\u00e2n malk\u00e2n 29. malk\u00e2, z\u00ee Shahp\u00fbharkan, kart\u00eer z\u00ee \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee mag\u00fbpat R\u00fbm kal\u00eet h\u00fbm\u00e2nam, wa Wanahl\u00e2n 30. malk\u00e2n [malk\u00e2], z\u00ee Walahl\u00e2nah, kart\u00eer z\u00ee b\u00fbht l\u00fbb\u00e2n Wanahl\u00e2n wa \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee mag\u00fbpat R\u00fbm kal\u00eet 31. h\u00fbm\u00e2nam: napashti b\u00fbhtaki dinu r\u00fb . . . . . . kart\u00eer sam Shah[p\u00fbhri]. . . . . .\n\nThe uncertain words in this text, although few in number, are important to the sense; it is therefore only with much diffidence that a translation can be offered as follows:\n\n. . . . . \u201cAfter that the writing he saw, he exclaimed thus,\n\u2018Where (is) that crown?\u2019 I am that made Shahp\u00fbhri king of the kings, the name of mobad and herbad of R\u00fbm I have made; and \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee king of the kings, and Wanahl\u00e2n king of the kings, that (were) Shahp\u00fbhar\u2019s sons; the crown that (was) of \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee, mobad of Rum, I have made; and Wanahl\u00e2n (king of) the kings, that (was) Walahl\u00e2n\u2019s brother, the crown that (was) of the liberated souls, Wanahl\u00e2n and \u00c2\u00fbharamazd\u00ee, mobads of R\u00fbm, I have made. Written of the emancipated of the faith . . . . . . the crown of the name of Shah(p\u00fbhri).\u201d\n\nThe word here taken as R\u00fbm can also be read sham, \u2018a name;\u2019 the suggested translations of Shahp\u00fbharkan and Walahl\u00e2nah are no doubt very hazardous guesses, especially as they seem to be at variance with history, but the correspondence of the final ah with the Chaldee \u06cc\u0647 \u2018brother,\u2019 is tempting; it is more probably, however, the suffix of the 3rd pers. sing. mas., and kan may perhaps be traced to the Hebrew \u05d9\u05dd \u2018base, foundation,\u2019 or the Syriac \u05d9\u05dd \u2018stem;\u2019 these affixes are evi-\ndently the forerunners of the Pahlav\u00ee affix \\( \\text{\u0645} \\text{\u0627\u0646} \\), as in \\( \\text{\u067e\u0627\u067e\u06a9\u0627\u0646} \\) P\u00e2pak\u00e2n, \\( \\text{\u0627\u0631\u062a\u0627\u0634\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646} \\) Artahshir\u00e2n, and \\( \\text{\u0634\u0627\u0647\u067e\u0647\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0646} \\) Shahp\u00fbhar\u00e2n, which affix might be read \\( \\text{\u0647\u062a} \\).\n\nThe date of the inscription appears, pretty clearly, to have been after the death of Varahr\u00e2n I. and the coronation of Varahr\u00e2n II.; it therefore seems to have been inscribed about the same time as No. V., or perhaps a little later. The Ir\u00e2anian suffixes of the 1st and 3rd persons singular are freely used, as in \\( \\text{\u0622\u067e\u0627\u0645} \\), \\( \\text{\u0622\u067e\u0627\u0634} \\), \\( \\text{\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645} \\), \\( \\text{\u0648\u0627\u0698\u0627\u0646\u062a} \\), etc., and the language generally approximates very closely to that of the Pahlav\u00ee books; in some places, however, the Huzv\u00e2rash verb is still found without the Ir\u00e2anian suffix.\n\nWith regard to the remaining inscriptions; Nos. VII. to X. contain merely the names, titles, and genealogy of later kings, and have been sufficiently detailed by Mr. Thomas; Nos. XI. and XII., which also bring the Sassanian regal record down to Shahp\u00fbhar III., evidently contain a good deal of matter in addition to the titles, but the lithograph in Sir W. Ouseley\u2019s Travels is too vague to admit of many words being read; the original copy might perhaps be rather more legible, but it is very desirable that paper casts and new copies should be obtained from the original inscriptions, which appear to be nearly perfect and very legible. Several Pahlav\u00ee words, besides the names and titles, can be discovered in these two inscriptions; amongst them are \\( \\text{\u0647\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0645} \\) and \\( \\text{\u0622\u067e\u0627\u0645} \\) in l. 2, 3 of No. XI.\n\nThe result of this examination of the Sassanian inscriptions has been to prove that the Sassanian Pahlav\u00ee of the last quarter of the third century of the Christian era was nearly identical with the Pahlav\u00ee of the writings still preserved by the P\u00e2rs\u00ees, except in the forms of several of the letters. It also appears that the Chald\u00e6o-Pahlav\u00ee was merely a slightly different dialect of the same language, written in a different character. The written language, although three-fourths Semitic, had nearly abandoned the Semitic verbal inflections, and was beginning to adopt the Ir\u00e2anian terminations as early as the middle of the third century; and this alteration appears to have proceeded, till it produced the written language\nof the Pahlav\u00ee books, towards the close of the same century. The books have continued to be written in the same language, but read in P\u00e2zand, to the present day; which mode of reading has occasioned frequent substitutions of the spoken P\u00e2zand word for its Huzv\u00e2rash equivalent in the MSS.\n\nThe latest of the Sassanian inscriptions may date from near the end of the fourth century of the Christian era, while the oldest Pahlav\u00ee MSS. in Europe (those of the Vandid\u00e2d, No. 1, at Copenhagen, and No. 4, in E. I. Lib. London) were written A.D. 1323; this interval of about 935 years is bridged over, in the first place, by the Pahlav\u00ee legends on coins and gems, which have been so ably discussed by Mr. Thomas some years ago; and in the second place, by a few inscriptions in the cursive character, which may be briefly noticed, as lessening the interval between the extant records in the Sassanian and cursive character.\n\nSir W. Ouseley mentions two or three short inscriptions in the cursive Pahlav\u00ee character, and gives a copy of one line of one of them; M. Flandin also gives a copy of a similar short inscription; but although many recent Pahlav\u00ee letters can be read in these copies, they are not sufficiently intelligible for a connected reading. The dates of these inscriptions are quite uncertain, and the writing has the peculiarity of being in vertical, instead of horizontal lines.\n\nIn 1866 I furnished the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society with a copy of two legible Pahlav\u00ee inscriptions found in the Kanher\u00ee caves, in the island of Salsette, near Bombay, and which are also written in vertical lines; these inscriptions, together with two others, discovered by Dr. Bh\u00e2\u00fb D\u00e2j\u00ee at the same place, attracted the attention of some P\u00e2rs\u00ee Pahlav\u00ee scholars, who published explanations of the inscriptions in the Zartoshti Abhi\u00e2s, Nos. 2, 3, and 4. Two of these inscriptions were noticed by Anquetil du Perron, when he visited the Kanher\u00ee caves in 1760, but although acquainted with the Pahlav\u00ee character, he supposed they were Mongolian, on account of the lines being vertical. They are all dated, and record the names of P\u00e2rs\u00ees, who visited the caves between the years\n356 and 390 of Yazdagard, or about the end of the tenth century of the Christian era. The earliest date in these inscriptions, which I read 364, corresponds to A.D. 995; and the writing is therefore 328 years older than the oldest Pahlav\u00ee MS. extant in Europe, but there is no sensible difference in the forms of the letters, except in the compound i, which has the upper letter set close down upon the lower one. By means of these inscriptions, the mediaeval interval, between the Sassanian Pahlav\u00ee records and the extant specimens of the cursive Pahlav\u00ee writings, is reduced to about 607 years; and there is Pahlav\u00ee writing extant, which still further reduces this interval.\n\nIn the Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. vii., p. 343, fac-similes are given of a grant made to the Syrian Church in Southern India, and engraved on six copper plates. The grant itself is in an old Tamil alphabet, and I am not aware that it has been translated, or its actual date discovered, but it appears from the history of the Primitive Church of Malay\u00e2la, Journal Royal Asiatic Society, Vol. i., p. 178, that its date is probably in the first half of the ninth century. One of the copper plates of this grant contains the signatures of the witnesses; eleven of these are in the Cufic character, and have been explained at the time the fac-similes were published; the next ten signatures are in the cursive Pahlav\u00ee, differing no more from that of the P\u00e2rs\u00ee books than the signature of any one differs from his ordinary hand-writing; the last four signatures are in the Hebrew character, but the language is Persian.\n\nThe form of attestation used by the witnesses who wrote Pahlav\u00ee, being often repeated, is easily determined to be as follows:\n\n- (signature) min\u016bk\u016b la (signature) patash g\u00fbk\u00e2s h\u00fbm\u00e2n\u0101m, \u2018the spiritual I (signature) am witness to it;\u2019 min\u016bk\u016b appears to have been an ordinary title, and two of the witnesses write it man\u016bk\u016b; two others somewhat vary the latter part of the form of attestation; the names can be read without much difficulty, but are not readily identified with any existing names; however, as\noccurs in one of the surnames, the writers were probably Parsis. The following is a transcript of these signatures, as far as they can be read:\n\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\\[ \\text{\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0633\u062a \u0633\u06a9\u0647} \\]\n\n1 Owing to want of type, the Pahlav\u00ee compounds throughout this paper are resolved, either into their component letters, or into such other letters as best represent the form of the compound; thus, the compound of \\( \\text{\\text{i}} \\) and \\( \\text{\\text{e}} \\), which is similar in form to the Zand \\( f \\), is represented by \\( \\text{\\text{i}} \\text{\\text{o}} \\), and \\( \\text{\\text{w}} + \\text{\\text{w}} \\) by \\( \\text{\\text{w}} \\text{\\text{w}} \\).\nThe form of attestation used by the witnesses who wrote in the Hebrew character, appears to be *hak g\u00fbn kan* (signature) *pad\u00eesh g\u00fb h\u00fbm*, 'the truth-speaking-doer (signature) to it I speak;' of the names, Maki\u00e2il (Michael) is the most readily identified, but Abraham and Hasan 'Ali are also pretty clear.

It also appears from further quotations from the Kit\u00e2bu-l-fihrist, made by M. Lenormant in the Journal Asiatique, Aug.-Sept., 1865, p. 197-9, that the Persians used several alphabets; one for engraved inscriptions only, others for MSS. of various kinds; one of these last, called *k\u00een*, used for writing medical and philosophical works, is given, and among the forms handed down to us, through the corrupting medium of the pens of successive Arab transcribers, M. Lenormant recognizes the following letters of the cursive Pahlav\u00ee alphabet:\n\n```\n\u0646\u064f\u062f\u0650\u0631\u064e\u0645 \u0633\u064f\u0631\u064f\u062f\u064e \u0648\u064e \u0645\u064e\u0639\u0652\u062f\u064f\u0648\u0657\u064a\u0653 \u0648\u064e \u064a\u064e\u062a\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062f\u064e\n```\nThere seems, therefore, little doubt that a cursive Pahlavi character, nearly identical with that used by the Parsis at the present time, was contemporary with the Sassanian and Chaldaeo-Pahlavi characters, the latter being used for engraving, and the former for writing, in the time of the early Sassanian kings. How much further back we have to look for the origin of these alphabets, only adapted for the proper representation of a Semitic language, or for the origin of the Zand alphabet, adapted to the more complicated sounds of an Arian tongue, is a matter which admits of much discussion and difference of opinion; it is, however, evident that the Zand alphabet must have been invented at a time when the pronunciation of the Zand language was well known, as it provides for the distinct representation of a large number of vowel sounds, which must have required a good ear to distinguish. It is doubtful whether this intimate acquaintance with the sounds of the Zand language, as spoken, could have existed at a later date than that of the Ach\u00e6menian kings.\n\nThe following vocabulary of the words that have been identified in the Sassanian inscriptions, together with several words that can be isolated with tolerable certainty, though not yet identified, may perhaps be useful to those who wish to proceed further in this investigation.\n\n**Materials for a Vocabulary of the Sassanian Inscriptions.**\n\nThe references are to the numbers given to the inscriptions by Mr. Thomas, and to the lines in the original of each inscription.\n\nReferences immediately following the letter C., are to the Chaldaeo-Pahlavi versions, and doubtful readings and references are italicised. The letters C. and S., prefixed to words, also refer to the Chaldaeo and Sassanian readings respectively.\n\nThe Greek synonyms are given precisely in the forms that occur in the inscriptions, and are therefore often in the genitive case.\n\nIt must be observed that the original letter, represented for\nthe sake of convenience by h, was probably a strong guttural aspirate.\n\n\u00e2din, II. 10, VI. 10, C. 10, 'then;' Chald. \ud800\udfa1\ud800\udfa0; corresponds to S. \u00e2har, in VI. 11.\n\n\u00e2dinan, VI. 5, 'then we;' = \u00e2din + the Syriac suffix of the 1st per. pl.\n\n\u00e2halmant, III. iii. 2, 'Aharman, the evil spirit;' Phl. \u0710\u0717\u0720\u0721\u0722\u071b.\n\n\u00e2h\u00e2n, III. xvii. 4.\n\n\u00e2har, II. 9, 26, III. iv. 4, VI. 11, 14, 'after, afterwards;' Phl. \u0710\u0717\u072a; Heb. \u05d0\u05b8\u05d4\u05b8\u05e8.\n\n\u00e2h\u00fbrmazd, C.

X.\u2014Some Account of the Senby\u00fa Pagoda at Meng\u00fan, near the Burmese Capital, in a Memorandum by Capt. E. H. Sladen, Political Agent at Mandal\u00e9; with Remarks on the Subject, by Col. Henry Yule, C.B.\n\nThe circumstances which led to the transmission of this Memorandum, will be stated in the appended remarks.\n\n\"Senbyoo\" Pagoda (at Mengoon).\n\n1. The Pagoda was built in the reign of king Bodo Piyah,\\(^1\\) in the Burmese year 1178 (A.D. 1816), by his grandson, Noungdau Gyee, now known as Bagyeedau Piyah,\\(^2\\) which specifies his relationship as paternal uncle to the present reigning king.\n\n2. It is situated at Mengoon, on the west bank of the Irrawaddy, a couple of hundred yards only from the huge brick ruin which is known as the Mengoon pagoda.\n\n3. Mengoon was a place of comparatively little note, until raised into importance by king Bodo Piyah, who made it his favourite retreat, and conceived and founded the monster pagoda which has given or taken its name from the place of its creation.\\(^3\\)\n\n4. King Bodo's partiality for the place, or his extensive building propensity seems to have been necessarily imitated by those about him, so that it soon became a conventional undertaking on the part of members of his family (and of his government too) to add to the importance and sanctity of the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Bhodau Phra is the title given to the king who reigned from 1781 to 1819, called by Symes, who visited his court, Minderauji Prav (Mantar\u00e1gyi).\u2014H.

Y.\nfashionable retreat, by embellishing it with shrines, pagodas, and other good works then in favour with the king.\n\n5. The Senbyoo pagoda thus rose into existence. It derives its name from Bagyeedau's chief queen, who was a granddaughter of king Bodo, and believed further, under the transmigration principle, to have been a revivification in the flesh of Bodo's mother; consequently she was privileged to assume Bodo's majestic title of \"Senbyoo Shen,\" or Lord of White Elephants.\n\n6. It is singular enough that this pagoda (Senbyoo) should have been built in a form which at once distinguishes it from the ordinary class of similar structures throughout Burmah. But though this singularity is somewhat unaccountable, the structural design of the pagoda is evident enough; and its connection therefore, in an architectural point of view, with similar Buddhistical remains in Java and elsewhere, can be so far satisfactorily traced.\n\n6. The pagoda is intended to be a complete symbolical representation or model of Mount Meru, known to Burmans as \"Myenmho Doung.\"\n\n7. It is as well perhaps that I should enter briefly into a description of this cosmical mountain (that is to say, a Burmese description) by way of illustrating, in some slight degree, the woodcut which is annexed, and of explaining beyond question, that the pagoda, about which we are interested is, in reality, a simple representation of the mountain to be described.\n\n8. Burmese fragmentary accounts, collected from a variety of sources, would have us believe in the first place, in reference to this famous Myenmho Doung, that the earth we inhabit, is composed of four continents, which lie at the extreme base of the mountain, in exact correspondence with the four cardinal points of the compass. Insurmountable barriers, and interminable seas separate these continents from direct contact with Myenmho Doung, but these seas and barriers are to some extent limited at the base of the mount by the monster fish \"Ananda,\" which surrounds the hill on all sides with its body, and defines a complete circle by taking its own tail in its\nmouth. This fabulous monster fish, which is regarded as the outer guard, barrier, or defence to the mountain itself, is represented at the Senbyoo pagoda by a large outer circular wall, eight feet in height, four in thickness, and 750 yards in length or circumference.\n\nThe five (or rather six) concentric terraces, which are seen in the photograph to rise one above and inside the other, are representations of the five regions, continents, or countries, which surround the hill in concentric gradations from its base upwards.\n\nThe continents are called in Burmese\u2014with reference I imagine only to the manner in which they are represented in drawings or models\u2014\"Aleye gna Sen,\" or the five concentric gradations.\n\nEach continent takes its name from the guard stationed in it for its defence, or rather for the defence of the mountain itself, against the attacks of the fallen angel or Nat \"Athooya.\"\n\nAscending from the base the\n\n1st Continent is called N\u0101g\u0101h.\n2nd \" \" K\u0101l\u014dn, sea-dragon or fabulous bird.\n3rd \" \" Gomb\u0101n \"Beloo,\" or man devouring monster of the Gomban tribe.\n4th \" \" Y\u0113tha \"Beloo,\" of the Yatha tribe.\n5th \" \" Gundap\u0101h, from the Nat, or spirit, or fairy of that name.\n\nThe fifth, or uppermost terrace, is surmounted by the S\u014dlam\u0101n\u0113\u0113 pagoda, which in turn has continents or terraces stretching out from its base, above which rise the several\n\n---\n\n1 Is not this the Midgard Serpent J\u00f6rmungand of the Edda, \"that holding his tail in his mouth encircles the whole earth.\" (Translation of the Prose Edda, 410.)\u2014J.

Y.\n\n3 I find on reference to a Burmese book, that Soo-la-m\u0101-nee is the name of a pagoda far up in the celestial regions, and worshipped by the Nats. I do not know the meaning of the word. From Sladen's note I do not understand whether the name is given to the great central structure of the Senbyoo pagoda, which in fact represents Mount Meru, or whether there is a separate building which carries the name of Soo-la-m\u0101-nee. The real Soo-la-m\u0101-nee in heaven is said to be three Yojana high, so in the model at Meng\u00fcn, it would, or ought to be proportionably small, if compared with the representation of Mount Meru.\u2014A. P. PHAYRE.\nParadises, in which reside spiritual beings of the Nat, angel, or fairy tribe.\n\n9. This description of the hill and its belongings might be enlarged on, and lengthened out into almost unlimited detail; but with very little advantage as regards the architecture of the Senbyoo Pagoda, with which we are at present principally concerned.\n\n10. The only discrepancy I find in connecting the pagoda with the description given above, is that it represents six instead of five concentric terraces.\n\nThe sixth terrace, though as evident as daylight, is ignored, or accounted as nought, by those on the spot, who affirm that the bottom or basement terrace (though it is a terrace as much as any of the rest, and ascended by a flight of steps, similar in all respects to those attached to the other terraces) does not count, and is no real terrace at all. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the extra terrace was tacked on by mistake, but I can readily believe in the aptitude and inclination of the Burmese artist or architect to disregard the mere trifle (as it would appear to him) of being particular as to correct definition or representation, if by the addition of a mere terrace or two, he could in any way beautify the original design, or make up for loss of height or other structural deficiency.\n\n11. I have already said that the outer circular wall of the Senbyoo pagoda (which represents the monster whale Ananda) is about 750 yards in circumference. The first or lower terrace at the base of the pagoda, has by rough measurement, a circumference of 400 yards.\n\nThe height and distance of each concentric terrace, above and apart from the other, is uniformly and respectively five feet; and each terrace is ascended on four sides, corresponding with the points of the compass, by flights of steps, leading under elaborately formed porticos of masonry, and stuccoed decorations.\n\nEach terrace too is girt or supported by a wavy serpentine parapet, which I understand to represent the mountain barriers which separate the several continents of Myenmho-Doung.\nThe wavy pattern idea in mortar bears a strong and rather ingenious resemblance to various paintings I have seen, by Burmese artists, who aspire to depict hills and mountain scenery.\n\nThe parapets are flanked, or rather connected at regular distances, by arched pillars, the archway of each containing a niche, or open space, in which the guardian monster deity, or B\u00ebl\u00f4o, sits and defies all enemies.\n\nIf the photograph which I send is looked into, it will be seen that a gentleman who was with me at the time the picture was taken, has kindly contributed his mite to science by perching himself upon the top of one of the masonry mountains which form the parapet of the terrace. The natural proportions, thus given, will be of more service I hope (by a comparison of parts) in estimating dimensions, than any unprofessional measurement or estimate of my own.\n\nIn fact, so clear is it to me that the architectural relationship, as regards design, between this pagoda and other similar structures in Java, or northern India, has been fully established and accounted for, that the necessity for correct measurement, by way of elucidating what has hitherto been supposed doubtful, no longer exists.\n\nThe photographs might have been better. They were taken on dry plates (Beer process), under rather unfavourable circumstances. The wind blew so freshly during the time of exposure, that the camera and other apparatus would have disappeared altogether, unless held in position. This too, in one instance, whilst a view was being taken from the top of the whale Ananda's back.\n\nEdwd. H. Sladen, Captain,\nPolitical Agent.\n\nMandalay, 6th Jan., 1868.\n\nRemarks.\n\nIn a paper describing what I had seen of architectural remains of Hindu character in Java, which was read before the Asiatic Society of Bengal, in October, 1861, there occurred the following passage in reference to that magnificent monument of Buddhism, the Boro Bodor:\u2014\nMr. Fergusson, who gives a good account of the Boro Bodor in his Handbook of Architecture, considers it to be a kind of representation of the great Buddhist monasteries, which are described in the Ceylonese writings as having been many stories high, and as containing hundreds of cells for monks.\n\nIn Tennent's Ceylon (vol. ii. p. 588) there is a woodcut of a singular pyramidal building at Pollanarua, called the Sat-mehal Prasada, or 'Seven Storied House,' which in a rough way is quite analogous to the Boro Bodor.\n\n\"But the structure nearest to it in general design, that I have seen or heard of, was one visited by Mr. Oldham and me in 1855, at Mongun, above Amarapura. It was thus described from my journal:\n\n\"Further north there is an older Pagoda of very peculiar character. The basement which formed the bulk of the structure consisted of seven concentric circular terraces, each with a parapet of a curious serpentine form. These parapets rose one above and within the other like the (seven) walls of Ecbatana described by Herodotus. . . . In the parapet of every terrace were at intervals niches looking outwards, in which were figures of Nats\u00b9 and warders in white marble, of half life size. A great\n\n\u00b9 \"Burmese Devas or genii.\"\ncircular wall enclosed the whole at some distance from the base. It was difficult to ascertain the nature of the central structure, so shattered was it by the earthquake. The whole (though round instead of square in plan) had a great general resemblance to the large ancient pyramidal temple in Java called Boro Bodor, as described by Raffles and Crawford; but this Meng\u00fan structure was not, I think, very old, and I doubt if the resemblance was more than accidental. At the foot of the hills, some hundred yards to the westward, there was another Pagoda of similar character, which we did not visit.\"\u00b9\n\nI retract the notion that the resemblance was purely accidental. It is one of many analogies between Burma and Java in architecture, arts, and manners, of which the history is unknown, though some of them doubtless came from India with the religion which was once common to both. One idea struck me after seeing the Burmese edifice, which I will mention. This is, that both it and the Boro Bodor were meant, in a way, as symbols of the great World-system of the Buddhists, Mount Maha-Meru surrounded by its seven concentric ranges of mountains. Nor is this inconsistent with Mr. Fergusson's theory of Boro Bodor. For these monasteries themselves were probably types of Mount Meru. In Tibet, we are told, \"Every orthodoxly constructed Buddhist Convent Temple either is or contains a symbolic representation of the divine regions of Meru, and of the Heaven of the Gods, Saints, and Buddhas rising above it into the Empyrean of Nirwana.\"\u00b2\n\nThe above passage had attracted Mr. Fergusson's attention, and some two years ago he requested me to obtain more particulars about the terraced structure at Meng\u00fan. I accordingly applied to my old friend Colonel Albert Fytche, who had recently succeeded Sir Arthur Phayre in the government of our Burmese provinces, requesting him to obtain some further particulars of the building, and if possible a photograph. Colonel Fytche took up the matter with characteristic energy and goodwill, and obtained from the intelligent assistance of Captain Sladen the memorandum which precedes these remarks, and two pho-\n\n\u00b9 Mission to Ava in 1855, p. 172.\n\u00b2 Koeppen, Die Religion des Buddha, ii. 262.\ntographs of the structure.\\(^1\\) The papers, owing to accidental circumstances, reached me only a few days ago.\n\nIt will be seen that Captain Sladen confirms the suggestion that the Burmese Monument was specifically designed to represent Mount Meru, but he finds some difficulty in reconciling the existence of six terraces with the supposed symbolization of Meru and its five zones. The fact is, however, that there are, as I noted in 1855, and as Captain Sladen's own photographs very clearly show, not six but seven terraces. And it is seven that the subject which I imagine to be typified demands.\n\nThe details of the orthodox Buddhist Cosmography will be found in Mr. Spence Hardy's Manual (see pp. 3, 12 seq.), but its essential features may be described in a few words. The centre of the system is Mah\u00e1-Meru, encircled by seven concentric ranges of mountains, which are divided by as many seas, and gradually diminish in height from the centre outwards. Round these focal ranges the heavenly bodies revolve. Between the last and lowest of these ranges and an eighth external range (called by the Singhalese the Sakwalagala) extends the salt ocean, in which are situated the great islands, or continents rather, of the inhabited earth. The Sakwalagala is the ring-fence and hoop of the whole system.\n\nIt is not, therefore, I apprehend, Mah\u00e1-Meru alone, distinguished into five zones, which is typified by this Burmese monument; but the whole system to its utmost bound. The Central Dagoba is Mah\u00e1-Meru; the seven terraces with their mountainous outline of parapet are the seven rocky ranges; the jungle-grown plain below is the circumambient ocean, wherein lie Jambudwipa and the other great islands; and Captain Sladen would perhaps have felt more confidence in the stability of his camera, had he perceived that instead of balancing it uneasily, \"with fixed tripod in the scaly rind\" of \"the whale Ananda's back,\" he and it were planted on the Sakwalagala, the adamantine girdle of the Cosmos!\n\nNo better illustration of the subject can be given than the\n\n\\(^1\\) I desire here to express my obligation to both these officers for this interesting communication.\nTibetan representation of the Mundane system, which appears in Giorgi's *Alphabetum Tibetanum* (Pl. I. p. 472), and from which I have made the accompanying reduction of the essential features. The text informs us that the original was done in colours by Yond\u00e9 Lahuri, a Tibetan painter, in the Shaprang monastery at Lhassa.\n\nWhat a strange parallel, one may observe in passing, is afforded by Mah\u00e1-Meru with its Terraces, the Paradise of Indra, that crowns it, and the many heavens rising in clime over clime far above it to culminate in the \"Empyrean of Nirwana,\" to Dante's Mountain of Purgatory with its Seven Zones, surmounted by the Table Land of the Terrestrial Paradise, whence he ascends through the nine Celestial Spheres to the Vision of the Candida Rosa and the ineffable glory!\u00b9\n\nThough no other similar monument has become known to us in Burmah, it is probable that analogous symbols exist there in some form or other.\n\nAs regards Java, Buddhism, I believe, has left no record\n\n\u00b9 Nay, how near to Dante's wonderful Image of the Great Rose even come the Visions of a Chinese Buddhist monk in the fourth century: \"In the seventh month of the nineteenth year, at eventide, he again had a vision of the Holy ones. The form of Amita filled the span of Heaven; all the saints looked forth from the Halo that encompassed him. . . . Moreover Yuanfud beheld a stream of water bright as light which fell from above, and parted into fourteen branches,\" etc. (Schott, *\u00fcber den Buddhismus in Hoch-Asien und in China*, p. 99).\n\n\"E vidi lume in forma di riviera\nFulvido di fulgore intra duo rive\nDipinte di mirabil primavera\n\n\"E si come di lei bevve la gronda\nDelle palpere mie, coi mi parve\nDi sua lunghezza divenuta fonda\n\n\"Si soprastando al lume intorno intorno\nVidi spechiarmi in pi\u00f9 di mille soglie\nQuanto di noi lam\u00ec fatte ho ritorno.\"\n\n\u2014PARADISO XXX.\nexcept in architecture and sculpture; it is unknown to surviving literature or tradition. But in the Island of Bali we find a curious transcript preserved, though blurred indeed and corrupted, of Javanese religion before the Mahomedan conversion; and there both Buddhism, of a sort, and Brahminism still exist. Now, it is curious with regard to the Meru symbolism, of which Boro Bodor is such a splendid instance, to find that a particular vestige of this symbolism still lingers abundantly in Bali. Mr. Friederich in his \"Preliminary account of Bali,\" after speaking of sundry kinds of temples in the Island, proceeds:\n\n\"Finally, in every house there is a multitude of miniature temples called Sanggar (Sangga of Crawfurd). Among these you find a Meru, a temple with a succession of roofs rising pyramidally one over the other, which is dedicated to Siva. . . . . . The apex of the Merus, as well as of the other little temples, is usually crowned with an inverted pot, or even with a tumbler, a circumstance that at first seemed to me strongly suggestive of Buddhism, for it looked like an adumbration of the cupola (or waterbubble), which is the distinctive mark of all Buddhist temples. The Siva\u00eftes will not, however, allow this, though they can give no explanation of such an ornament.\"\u00b9\n\nAs accident has brought me to speak of Boro Bodor, I should like to recall attention to the very interesting observations of W. von Humboldt on the symbolism of that wonderful structure, with the view of eliciting information which I have not been able to obtain from any source accessible to me.\n\nThe construction of Boro Bodor is clearly shown in the woodcut at p. 535 of Vol. II. of Fergusson's History of Architecture. It is, omitting minutiae, a pyramidal structure rising in seven successive terraces from a square base.\n\nThe first of these terraces is low, narrow, and without parapet, and is now covered with soil. The second terrace is higher and of considerable width, forming a basement for the\n\n\u00b9 In the Transactions of the Batavian Soc. of Arts and Sciences, Vol. xxii. p. 33. Captain Joseph Cunningham also alludes to the \"Jain Models of Meru\" (in Journ. As. Soc. Bengal, xvi. 765).\nhighly decorated structure which rises out of it. This consists of five successive terraces, each surrounded by an elaborate architectural screen, so that between every two of these screens there is formed a corridor running round the four sides of the building. The fifth terrace forms a wide platform, from which again rise three low concentric circular terraces, bordered by as many concentric rings of small dagobas. In the centre, a larger dagoba of about thirty feet diameter forms the apex and crown of the edifice.\n\nIn the outer face of each of the principal terraces are numerous niches crowned by miniature dagobas; and these niches have all been occupied by cross-legged Buddhas, whilst both sides of the corridors are carved in an astonishing series of sculptures.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe construction of the small dagobas, 72 in number, which form the three concentric rings, is very peculiar. They are hollow cages or latticed bells of stone, each of which contains a meditative Buddha immured, and visible through the diamond openings of the lattice.\n\n\\(^1\\) The number of these niches is stated on the face of Raffles's plate as 136, a mistake for 438, which last number is that stated by Mr. Fergusson. But 438 would give an uneven number to each side (109), a circumstance inconsistent with the design. I make the niches by the plan to be 440, or 110 to the side. But it seems probable that the real number of niches, or at any rate of images, was 108 to the side, that being a number in high and sacred esteem among the Buddhists as well as the Hindustan. It will be seen that the number of figures in the concentric circles above is \\(72 = \\frac{3}{4}\\) of 108.\nIn the Meng\u00fan pagoda we see that all seven terraces and parapets are alike in character. But in Boro Bodor only the five principal terraces and parapets are of homogeneous character; the two lower terraces or steps seem only to form a plinth or platform for the monument. Probably, therefore, the type of the pyramidal structure here is that which Captain Sladen supposes to be represented at Meng\u00fan, viz., Mah\u00e1-Meru alone with its five zones; whilst the circular steps above represent what a former quotation terms \"the Heaven of the Gods, saints, and Buddhas, rising above it into the Empyrean of Nirvana.\"\n\nI will quote here the general remarks of W. von Humboldt on the types of Boro Bodor, which undoubtedly set forth the spirit of its symbolism, though probably his genius expresses it with a precision beyond the consciousness of the builders: \"One\nsees that the idea of the structure develops gradually from below upwards. In the six four-square terraces are set forth the innumerable Buddhas in living contact with the world and with men. Even that quadrangular form which presents the images of the Holy Ones respectively to the four quarters of the heavens is not without significance. With the introduction of the circle begins the reference to Heaven, and here also the symbolism recedes more and more from the corporeal. The bas-reliefs, with their groups and countless figures, disappear; the Holy Ones remain in their loneliness, severed from contact with the earthly, and in a position of the deepest abstraction. Access to them is closed; to the eye only it is open through the latticework. In the crowning Dome the Holy One himself has also vanished; all imagery ceases, and that which is hidden there even the eye cannot approach. Such a process of ascent from multiplicity and division to unity and indivisibility lies in all Buddhist symbolism. The highest of the Three Worlds is styled the World without form or colour. And the incarnated Buddhas, supreme in all Three Worlds, lose in the highest even their names.\"1\n\nThe Buddhas of the Boro Bodor are represented in five different attitudes. Thus the immured ones all exhibit one peculiar action, and the images on each of the four sides of the pyramid respectively exhibit one peculiar action. The five attitudes are as follows:\n\n1. On the East side\u2014The left hand rests, with the palm up, on the sole of the foot turned upward. The right hand hangs with the palm turned in, and in contact with the right knee (viz., the usual attitude of Gautama Buddha).\n\n2. On the South side\u2014The left hand as before. The right hand also hangs in contact with the right knee, but with the palm turned out.\n\n3. On the West side\u2014Both hands rest in the lap with the palms upwards.\n\n4. On the North side\u2014Left hand as in 1 and 2; the right hand raised from the wrist with the palm open and outward.\n\n1 Kawi Sprache I., 126.\n5. The Immured Figures\u2014Both hands raised opposite the breast, as in an attitude of teaching.\n\nHumboldt comes to the conclusion that these five classes of figures represent the Five Celestial or Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas, belonging to a system which became known to Europe through Mr. Hodgson's memorable researches.\n\nThe attitudes in all cases, and the quarters of the heaven in the case of the four Boro Bodor figures which face those quarters, correspond to those assigned to the Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas by the Northern Buddhists.\n\nThe attitude of the Buddhas on the East corresponds to that of Akshobhya, who, in the Northern system, is the Regent of the East; the Southern attitude is that of Ratna Sambhava, the Regent of the South; the Western, that of Amit\u00e1bha, Regent of the West; the Northern, that of Amogha Siddha, Regent of the North.\n\nThe attitude of the Immured Buddhas is that of Vairochana. This Dhy\u00e1ni Buddha, according to Mr. Hodgson, is seldom seen; but when he is represented he is placed on the East, close on the right of Akshobhya. Pallas also assigns both of these personages to the East.\u00b9\n\nThose who have become acquainted with Buddhism in Burmah and Ceylon, where the books contain no trace of the Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas, will be slow to believe that those are the beings represented here, or that they were ever known in Java. And yet this last conclusion would be quite erroneous; for Mr. Friederich found the names of several of the personages of that system in a Sanskrit inscription from the temple of Tumpang in Java,\u00b2 and apparently executed about the twelfth or thirteenth century. He has also seen reason, in the alphabetic character used, to believe that the influence under which these remains were produced came from Gangetic India. Still the key of the symbolism of Boro Bodor must surely be that very singular\n\n\u00b9 Sammlungen, ii. 86. Pallas knows the names of these as \"the Five Beneficent Burkhans,\" but not their character, apparently, as distinguished from the Earthly Buddhas, or their relation to these.\n\n\u00b2 In the province of Surabaya and district of Malang. There are various finely sculptured images also at this temple, which, from the descriptions given, appear to represent persons, male and female, of the Dhy\u00e1ni Buddha system (see Batavian Transactions, xxvi. 84\u20135).\ndevice of the Caged Buddhas, so costly to execute, and yet repeated seventy-two times. And why should Vairochana occupy so distinctive a position?\n\nWould not that be a more satisfactory and striking interpretation which Humboldt rejected, viz., that the four Buddhas, throned in their open niches and dominating the four sides of the cosmical pyramid, are the four Past Buddhas of this Kalpa, Krakuchanda, Konagamani, Kasyapa, and Sakya; while he of the upper dagobas is Maitreya, the Buddha of the Future, patiently abiding his development hidden in the heaven Tusita? To determine this, light is wanted on several points, which I have not been able to obtain. The chief of these points regards the characteristic attitudes assigned to the whole of the five human Buddhas.\n\nI cannot find certain information in respect to any but Sakya and Maitreya. And it is remarkable that, in their cases, when we compare the characteristic attitudes of the Earthly Buddhas with that of these Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas, which are supposed to be the celestial reflexion of each, these do not correspond as we should expect.\u00b9 The earthly and heavenly couples are supposed to run as follows:\n\n**Earthly** \u20141. Krakuchanda. 2. Konagamani. 3. Kasyapa.\n\n**Heavenly**\u20141. Vairochana. 2. Akshobhya. 3. Ratna Sambhava.\n\n**Earthly** \u20144. Sakya. 5. Maitreya.\n\n**Heavenly**\u20144. Amit\u00e1bha. 5. Amogha Siddha.\n\nNow the well-known attitude of Sakya is that which belongs not to Amit\u00e1bha, but to Akshobhya; and the attitude of Maitreya\u00b2 is that which belongs not to Amogha Siddha, but to Vairochana. I may add that there seems reason to suppose the attitude assigned to Kasyapa to be that which pertains to Amogha Siddha.\u00b3\n\n\u00b9 This is noticed by Humboldt, u.s.\n\u00b2 See Pallas, Sammlungen, Vol ii., Plate iii., Fig. 1; and Plate ix., Fig. 2.\n\u00b3 For Pallas assigns this attitude to Divongarra (Dipankara), \"the Ruler of the preceding World-period,\" who, along with Sakya and Maitreya, forms the triad, called by the Tibetans Dissum Sanji, \"The Three Lordly ones;\" and in Mongol Gurban Tsagan Burchan, \"The Three White Gods\" (Sammlungen ii., 86). But, according to Schott, the third member of the group receiving these titles is not Dipankara, but the immediate predecessor of Sakya, or as Pallas himself says, \"the Ruler of the preceding World-period,\" i.e. Kasyapa. So I suppose Kasyapa to have the attitude of Amogha Siddha, or of the northern figures of Boro Bodor (See Schott, Ueber den Buddhismus, p. 40).\nThese characteristics would identify the Caged Buddha with Maitreya, which quite answers to the hypothesis; whilst the eastern figure would be Sakya and the northern one Kasyapa.\n\nBut in the only precedents I can refer to, viz., the Ananda temple at Pag\u00e1n, and General Cunningham's description of the great Sanchi Tope, Sakya looks to the North and Kasyapa to the West. Is there then any precedent for the arrangement which would place Sakya to the eastward and Kasyapa to the North?\n\nA third question will be as to the existence, on the Buddhas of Boro Bodor, of those distinctive symbols which Mr. Hodgson has brought prominently to notice. It would appear, from an allusion in his paper in vol. xviii. of the Society's Journal, as if he had identified some of these symbols on drawings of the Boro Bodor images; but I am not quite clear that this is meant, and I have no access to the former papers therein referred to. Indeed, I should not have presumed to touch these questions, in a position where I have so little access to necessary books, had not the receipt of Captain Sladen's memorandum given me so fair an occasion to bring forward the subject.\n\nA splendid work in illustration of Boro Bodor was in preparation eight or ten years ago at the expense of the Dutch Government, but I have never heard of its completion. If the figures of Boro Bodor should really prove to belong to the Dhy\u00e1ni Buddha system, it is probable also that those figures sculptured on the exterior of the adjoining very remarkable Temple of Mundot, which I took for Brahminical divinities, really belong to the same system.\n\nPalermo, April 17th, 1869.\n\n---\n\n1 I have not the \"Bhilsa Topes,\" and do not know whether General Cunningham gives the characters by which he distinguished the different Buddhas. And unfortunately I made no note of the distinctive positions in the Ananda.\n\n2 I have not the Journal nor the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society accessible, but I have a copy of Mr. Hodgson's paper from vol. xviii., which he kindly sent me some years ago, accompanied by tracings of the Dhy\u00e1ni Buddhas and Bodhisatwas. It is well known, and indeed apparent from that paper, that he does not acknowledge the distinction so often made between Northern and Southern Buddhism. Even if the Java buildings proved to belong to the Dhy\u00e1ni system, however, it would not settle that question, as Friedrich's researches seemed to point to a movement from Bengal towards Java in the middle ages, which might have introduced the Dhyani system into the island without at all affecting the Indo-Chinese countries which received their Buddhism from Ceylon at an earlier date.\nNote by J. Fergusson, F.R.S.\n\nI have not the least wish or intention to dispute the theory put forward by Capt. Sladen and Col. Yule in their remarks, that the Senby\u00fa Pagoda is intended to represent the mythical Mount Meru. I would, nevertheless, like to be allowed to explain that I think its peculiarities may be accounted for on much more mundane and less recondite grounds. The absence of any plan or section makes it a little difficult to speak with any certainty on the subject, but the photographs, with Capt. Sladen's descriptions, are probably sufficient to enable us to avoid any material error.\n\nThe central object at Senby\u00fa will be easily recognized as one of those buildings to which we are accustomed to apply the names of Dagoba or Tope. If it contained a relic, the former designation would be correct; if it marked a sacred spot, or commemorated some sacred event, the latter would be the correct term. We do not in this instance know that it was erected for either the one purpose or the other, and it may therefore be designed to represent Mount Meru. If it does so, however, this is the first instance that has come under my notice of a Dagoba being so applied. There is certainly nothing in its external appearance that would lead any one to suppose that any difference existed between this one and the other Topes found so frequently in either Burmah or India.\n\nSince the publication of General Cunningham's book on the Bhilsa Topes in 1854, we have become perfectly familiar with the form of Topes surrounded by detached rails. All that group are, or were, so enclosed; and from this and other examples, we may infer that the enclosing rail was an essential adjunct to the Tope. At Amravati the Tope was enclosed by two concentric rails, which still remain. My conviction is that there was a third, or inner rail, which has perished with the central building, but this is not important. In Ceylon, many of the Topes are surrounded by three concentric circles of pillars, which I do not doubt were the analogues of the continental rails. The temple at Boro Buddor, in Java, consists\nof a central group of Topes surrounded by five enclosures, which though square, or at least rectangular in plan, are in reality nothing but sculptured screens similar in purpose to those that surrounded the Amravati Tope. At Senby\u00fa we have six, and in spite of the evidence of my senses, I believe that only six terraces were intended, though the photograph seems to show seven. The priests, however, may therefore have been right when they assured Capt. Sladen that the lower storey did not count. If this is so, then the Dagoba formed the seventh storey of the temple. For myself, I am quite content with the fact that we have here a Tope with six enclosing rails, without seeking for any further symbolism at present.\n\nThere is, however, another series through which we arrive at a similar conclusion, though by a different road. There are in Babylonia and Assyria a large group of temples of pyramidal form, consisting of terraces placed one above and within the other, and rising through three or seven stories. The temple at Mugheyr is the typical example at present known of the three-storeyed temples; that called the Birs Nimroud, of the seven-storeyed. But there are others at Nimroud in Assyria, and at Khorsabad which have similar arrangements, and the seven walls of Ecbatana, alluded to by Col. Yule were no doubt reminiscences of the same forms. In my \"History of Architecture\" (ii. 518), I pointed out the connexion between the buildings on the banks of the Euphrates with those on the Irawaddy, long before I was so familiar with the subject as I now am, and every subsequent discovery has only seemed to confirm me in this conviction.\n\nThe Sat Mehal Pr\u00e1s\u00e1da at Pollanarua was a seven-storeyed Pagoda in every respect analogous to these. The Maha Lowa Paya at Anuradhapura one with nine storeys. So was the temple at Boro Buddor which was also of nine storeys. But the temples most in point are those at Pagan. All the larger temples there, the Ananda, the Thapinyu, the Gaudapalen are seven-storeyed,\u00b9\u2014six terraces and a ziggarat, or cell,\n\n\u00b9 Yule's \"Mission to Ava,\" p. 35 et seqq. See also my \"History of Architecture,\" II. 516 et seqq.\nwith a spire at the top. These, it is true, are all square, or at least rectangular. This one at Meng\u00fan is circular, but that distinction is really of little importance, and to my mind the difference between the two is only what we should expect from\n\nthe six or seven centuries which have elapsed between the dates of their erection. One other point in these Senby\u00fa enclosures deserves notice. It is their wavy or serpentine\nform. It may sound fanciful, but my impression is, that it is really intended to recall the form of a serpent. At least, at Nakon Vat in Cambodia, all the ridges of the roofs and all the borderings of the pathways, were wavy serpents, generally seven-headed, but with the bodies of real snakes. Here it is so conventional that without the knowledge of what happened further east we should not dare even to suggest such a theory.\n\nTo my mind the most interesting peculiarity of the Meng\u00fan Pagoda is that it forms a connecting link\u2014which has hitherto been missing\u2014between the square and circular forms of these seven-storeyed Pagodas. With the assistance it affords I now see\u2014dimly it must be confessed\u2014the outline of the whole series, from the temple at Mugheyr to the present day. Many of the links in this series are still wanting to our knowledge; but I have no doubt that they exist, and I feel confident that as photography spreads we shall soon be furnished with the required information. When this is obtained we shall be enabled to write one of the most curious and interesting chapters which remain to complete our knowledge of the history of the ancient architectural forms of Southern Asia.\n\nSome Remarks upon Col. Yule's Notes on the Senby\u00fa Pagoda at Meng\u00fan. By C. Horne, F.R.A.S.\n\nWith reference to the interesting account of the Senby\u00fa Pagoda at Meng\u00fan, read at the last meeting of the Royal Asiatic Society, and more particularly with reference to the remarks by Col. Yule on the Buddhas of the Boro Bodor, I would, with the greatest deference to the writer, beg to offer some suggestions derived from personal observation of the manner in which many groups of figures of Buddha (S\u00e1kya Muni) are sculptured in Bengal and the North-West Provinces of India.\n\nFirst, as to the number of times of representation. I may remark that the ceiling of the interior of the great tope or tower of Budh Gaya is divided into many hundreds of little spaces, in each of which S\u00e1kya Muni in his conventional atti-\ntude is represented. If I remember rightly, the groundwork is of a pale yellow, whilst the figures are of an uniform ochreous brown. There is, however, no variety of position in the figure, and I believe that Gen. Cunningham ascribes the ceiling to about 1100 A.D. The painting is very much faded, and the ceiling of a much later date than the body of the building.\n\nSecondly, as to the positions of the figures. I have before me a small square memorial stupa from Buddh Gaya, of no great antiquity, but evidently copied from a more ancient one, surmounted by a tapering finial of nine circles, upon the sides of which are depicted in relief, in niches, four of the favourite positions in which that great social reformer is often sculptured, viz., begging, expounding, blessing, and contemplating. To these is often added a recumbent figure of Buddha entering \"Nirv\u00e1na,\" or annihilation; and often one of M\u00e1y\u00e1, his mother, holding the S\u00e1l tree at the time of his birth.\n\n1. On the stone in question. To the East (I say East, although the sides are all precisely the same, because there is an inscription on it beneath the figure, and because the principal sides of every Buddhist erection, as far as I am aware, faced the East; and, thirdly, because Buddha is there represented as blessing), is a sitting figure of S\u00e1kya Muni in the act of blessing, both hands being raised before him with joined palms, turning outwards, and the soles of the feet turned upwards, showing the chakra upon them.\n\n2. To the West, or opposite side, Buddha is expounding or demonstrating, with the hands in close proximity, and the soles of both feet still upward, as in the first position.\n\n3. To the North, he is sitting contemplating in the position as described in posture No. 1. of Col. Yule, viz., the left hand lying, palm upwards, open on the right upturned sole; whilst the left hangs down on the right knee, palm inwards.\n4. To the South, he is sitting with his hands folded one over the other in his lap, i.e. between his heels (or in some other stones that I have seen, on both the upturned soles), supporting his begging pot.\n\nI have never heard it contended by any one that these various figures, or rather positions of the same figure, represent different Buddhas, nor do I think it likely that they do so; but that they are merely as I remarked in the commencement, different attitudes of S\u0101kya Muni, in which that of teacher occupies the most prominent place.\n\nThe suggestions which I would therefore wish to throw out are\u20141. That the numerous figures of Buddha on the Pagoda of Boro Bodor all represent the same person. 2. That the building was erected in honour of Buddha, the teacher, as he sat \"Turning the wheel of the Law,\" or expounding his doctrines, or in the act of blessing.\n\nThe attitude No. 1 of Col. Yule would then represent Buddha as in contemplation under the Bo tree.\n\nNo. 2 would represent him expounding.\n\nNo. 3 would show him as a mendicant, for I find the begging pot to be often omitted, although it is placed in the general representation of Buddha in all Thibet (vide Capt. Austin's paper, J. A. S. of Bengal, vol. xxxiii., p. 152).\n\nNo. 4 would represent him in the act of blessing, whilst the principal or immured figure is either in the act of teaching or perhaps blessing.\n\nGen. Cunningham, in his Bhilsa Topes, has shown the conventional method of expressing by the hands the act of teaching, viz., the placing of the first finger of the right hand in a peculiar manner on those of the left, which leads me slightly to doubt the certainty of \"both hands raised opposite the breast as in an attitude of teaching\" representing that act.\n\nI have also seen standing figures of Buddha\u2014generally with the begging pot, which holds so conspicuous a place in\nhis scanty accessories, and I cannot but believe that the one and the same person is represented in many ways.\\(^1\\)\n\n\\(^1\\) So far as my experience goes, the conclusions I have arrived at are entirely in accordance with Mr. Horne's suggestions. At Ajanta, for instance, especially in Cave 19, Buddha is represented in all these four attitudes, and so frequently, but with such similarity of form and emblems, that I hardly think it can be doubted but that one and the same person only is meant to be represented. The same thing occurs at Kenheri and elsewhere in the western caves, yet I never heard it suggested that these figures were intended to represent any other person than the one S\u0101kya Muni.\u2014J. F.\n\nUpper Norwood, June 23, 1869.\nART. XI.\u2014The B\u1e5bhat-Sa\u1e41hit\u0101; or, Complete System of Natural Astrology of Var\u0101ha-mihira. Translated from Sanskrit into English by Dr. H. Kern.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nIntroduction.\n\n1. Victory to the Allsoul, the source of life, the inseparable ornament of heaven, the Sun, who is adorned with a crown of a thousand beams like unto liquid gold!\n\n2. After studying the subject matter which former Seers have revealed with infallible truth, I purpose to treat of the same in an easy style, and in verses neither too few nor too many.\n\n3. Should any one think that an ancient work, as being made by Seers, is good, and that a book by a human author is not, (then I would fain ask) what difference it makes in the statement, however different the wording may be, if the thing told remain the same? The Holy Writ is here excepted.\n\n1 The commentator, Utpala, takes \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0924\u093f as 'the first seer, viz. Brahma,' but \u092f\u091c\u094d\u091e\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930, not being identical with \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0935\u093f\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930, points to a plurality of infallible authors, although it is true that Brahma, the Creator, is, of course, the very first astronomer in the Hindu system. The word \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0925\u092e does not necessarily mean 'first.'\u2014Cf. v. 5.\n\n2 To understand Var\u0101ha's meaning, one must bear in mind that the \u1e5ashis, Munis, in a technical sense, are superhuman beings. They are no more men than, e.g. angels, devils, Vidy\u0101dharas, R\u0101kshasas, etc., are. In enumerations of the various beings, they are classed apart from men, devas, demons, etc., e.g. Sarvadar\u00e7ana-Sangraha, p. 98, l. 20: \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0926\u0948\u0935\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u0935\u093e\u0926\u092f\u0903. \u1e5ashis and Devas, however, get often confounded, because both are manifestations of light, as stars, the sun, planets, lightning, the hearth-fire, etc., or rather the spirits, the\n4. Whether the words run thus: \"The week day presided over by Mars is not auspicious,\" as we read in the work issued by Brahma; or thus: \"Tuesday is an unlucky day;\" what (real) difference is there in the two works, one of which is made by a man, the other by a heavenly being?\n\n5. Having taken notice of the numerous works that have come from Brahma, etc., in succession, I now undertake this composition. My aim is to give an epitome of those works.\n\n6. Once this world was darkness (chaos). On its waters was a golden egg of light, one half of which was heaven, the other earth. In it Brahma was born, the maker of all things, he whose eyes are the Sun and Moon.\n\n7. Kapila declares Matter, Kan\u0101da Substance, etc., to be the cause of the universe; some proclaim that Time, others that Spontaneousness, others again that Action is the cause.\\(^1\\)\n\nspiritual powers of those manifestations. It would be difficult to decide whether Agni is a deva, or a \u1e5b\u1e63hi, kavi; indeed, he is now the one, then the other. A curious passage is found in Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata (ed. Bombay), xii. 210, 21, where G\u0101rgya (another form of Garga), the celebrated mythical astronomer, is mentioned:\n\nHere is devarshicari\u015bam, the mythological phrase for jyotish\u0101\u1e45gati. Garga himself is clearly a meteoric phenomenon; see, e.g. Mah\u0101bh. vii. 190, 34:\n\nThis is pretty clear, at least to all who have no preconceived notions, and have taken the pains of spelling the alphabet of mythology before they ventured into its higher regions. It would seem that garga originally denoted 'thunder, lightning,' as a derivative from garj. It is the masculine form of \u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b3\u03cc\u03c2. When real men, as P\u0101\u1e47ini, are called \u1e5ashis by posterity, it is honoris causa; and this is natural enough, because \u1e5b\u1e63hi, muni, kavi, have, besides their technical meaning, the more general one of 'seer,' 'a wise man,' 'poet,' notions which are constantly used as synonyms in Sanskrit and other languages.\n\n\\(^1\\) Although the six categories (pad\u0101rtha) of Substance, Quality,\n8. But enough of this; for to decide all incidental questions would require too much time. Here I have only to determine what the divisions are of the Jyotih\u00e7\u00e2stra, or Science of the Stars.\n\n9. The Jyotih\u00e7\u00e2stra, treating of several subjects, is contained in three branches. A complete course of it is termed by the Seers Sanh\u00eet\u00e2. In one branch are to be found the motions of the heavenly bodies, as determined by calculation: this is called Tantra, or doctrinal part. The second branch is Horoscopy, or the casting of the horoscope. Something different is the third branch.\u00b9\n\n10. The retrograde and post-retrograde motion,\u00b2 the heliacal setting and rising, etc., of the five planets, are expounded by me in my work on mathematical astronomy. I have also copiously treated the nativity, which is contained in the \"Horoscopy,\" and along with it the prognostications for marching and weddings.\n\n11. Whilst omitting questions, answers, tales, which are of little use, the origin of the planets, and other futile things, I shall set forth what is essential and real in all points.\n\nAction, Generality, Speciality, Inherence, are the foundation of Ka\u00f1\u00e2da's System (see Vai\u00e7. S\u00fbt. 1, 4), they are nowhere said, at least to my knowledge, to be the cause of the universe. It appears that the statement of our author is not accurate. Those who represent Time to be the first cause are, as Utpala rightly observes, the mythologists (paurd-\u1e47ik\u00e2s). He quotes a well-known verse from the Mah\u00e2bh.:\n\n\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0903 \u0938\u0942\u091a\u093f\u0924\u093f \u092d\u0942\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0915\u093e\u0932\u0903 \u0938\u0902\u0939\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092a\u094d\u0930\u091c\u093e: \u0964\n\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0903 \u0938\u0941\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0924\u0902 \u0915\u093e\u0932\u094b \u0939\u093f \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0903 \u0965\n\nSpontaneousness is the cause, according to the Lauk\u00e2yatikas; Action, in a collective sense, according to the M\u00eem\u00e2\u00f1sakas, or followers of the P\u00fbrva-M\u00eem\u00e2\u00f1s\u00e2.

He must have well-proportioned, compact and full limbs, no bodily defect, and be a fine man, with nice hands, feet, nails, eyes, chin, teeth, ears, brows, and head, and with a deep and clear voice; for generally one's good and bad moral qualities are in unison with one's personal appearance. Now, good qualities in a man are, that he is pure, clever, free, eloquent, ready-witted, able to discern time and place, good in the highest sense of the word; not timid in society, unsurpassed by his fellow students, skilful, not addicted to bad passions, well versed in the arts of expiation, of procuring prosperity, of incantation, and of anointing; further, that he is regular in worshipping the gods, in his observances and fasts; that he is able to raise the prestige of science by the wonderful perfection of his branch of study, and to solve satisfactorily any question, except in cases wherein supernatural agencies baffle human calculation; finally, that he knows both text and meaning of the works on Mathematical astronomy, Natural astrology, and Horoscopy.\n\n1 The edited text has \u0938\u092e\u094d: \u0938\u0941\u0966, which is wrong; read \u0938\u092e\u0938\u0941\u0966.\n2 Utpala explains \u0926\u0947\u0936\u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f, as though it applied only to astrology, but it is more likely that the word must be taken in its more general sense.\n3 Since the translation gives an inadequate idea of the terms used in the original, the comment on it is copied here in full:\n\n\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092a\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u0940\u0915\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0927\u0947 \u0935\u0947\u0926\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0938\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u093e \u0936\u093e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u0906\u092f\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0923\u0902 \u092a\u094c\u0927\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f:\u0964\n\n\u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u093f \u0935\u0947\u0926\u093e\u0964\nAs to Mathematical astronomy, he must know the divisions of heaven and of time, in ages, years, half-years, seasons, months, half-months, days, watches, hours (1/24 of a day), half-hours, minutes, respirations, moments, subdivisions of a moment, etc., as taught in these five Siddh\u00e2ntas: the Paul\u00eeca,\n\nAccording to this system there is no connection between the division of time and that of the circles of heaven. The system in which both divisions are made to correspond with each other may be held to be a fruit of the introduction of Greek science. It is given by Utpala as follows:\n\nMoreover \u0100ryabha\u1e6da (Siddh. 3, 3), is quoted.\nRomaka, V\u0101sishtha, Saura, and Br\u0101hma Siddh\u0101ntas. He must know the reason why there are four kinds of months\u2014the solar, natural, stellar, and lunar months,\u2014and how it happens that there are intercalary months and subtractive days.\u00b9 He must know the beginning and end of the Jovian cycle of sixty years, of the lustrums, years, days, hours (\u00bc of a day), and their respective lords. He must be able to explain in what respect the reckoning after solar time shows similarity or difference, compared with the lunar, stellar, and natural reckoning of time, and to what use each of these is adapted or not. And when there is discrepancy between the Siddh\u0101ntas, he must be able to prove experimentally, by means of the agreement between the shadow and the clepsydra, between observation and calculation, at what moment the sun has reached the solstitial point, and at what time of the day (alias, at how many gha\u1e6dikas) the sun enters the prime vertical.\u00b2 He must know the cause of the swift and slow motion, the northern and southern course, and the moving in an epicycle of the sun and the other planets. He must foretell the moment of commencement and separation, the direction,\n\n\u00b9 For \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u093e\u0932 see Siddh. \u010cirom. (p. 49, 22, and 271, ed.

That only rish\u1e6da and not arish\u1e6da, can have this sense, is a matter of course. Nevertheless, we often meet with \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f in the MSS., where \u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f is required; and not only scribes, but even some authors, seem to have confounded both words, as appears from Indian lexicographers (see Dict. by B\u00f6htlingk and Roth, s.v. \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f). The origin of the rather strange confusion must be a mis-read \u091a\u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f, which means the same as \u0930\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f.\nduration of life, destiny and intervening changes of it, the most favourable combinations of planetary positions as may exist in theory, the constellations under which kings are born, the lunar constellations, the constellations formed by only two planets, etc., the celestial constellations, etc., and the consequences of all these; descent and character, the planetary aspects, manner of death, state after death, state in a former birth; the good or bad symptoms at the moment of consultation,\u00b9 the calculation of a lucky period for weddings and other ceremonies.\n\nIn the Y\u00e2tra, or work containing prognostics for marches, is treated of: good or evil dates, week days, karanas, hours (of 48 minutes), the horoscope, constellations, trembling of the body, dreams, the anointment for securing victory, the sacrifice to the planets, the offering to the goblins, the foretokens of the fire, the gestures of elephants and horses, the talk and spirit of the troops, the measures of policy in conformity with the forebodings of the planets, the auspicious and evil auguries, the ground for encampments, the colour of the fire, the use to be made, after circumstances, of ministers, spies, envoys, and savages, and the expedients for taking the strongholds of the enemy.\n\nBy a great master has been said:\n\n5. \"The teachings of one whose theoretical and practical knowledge of astronomy\u00b2 has, so to say, spread abroad everywhere, and is engraved, as it were, in his thoughts, and fixed in his heart, are not fruitless.\"\n\nAn astrologer must also be accomplished in natural astrology, in which the following matters are contained: the\n\n\u00b9 All these subjects form the argument of Brhaj.-j\u00e2t., from chap. 3 to 25.

And since the symptoms cannot be observed uninterruptedly by one man, an astrologer, if well paid, ought to keep in his service four other persons conversant with the science. One of them should observe the east and south-east, another the south and south-west, a third the west and north-west, and the last of them the north and north-east,\u2014for meteors and other omina appear suddenly, and produce effects by their form, colour, glossiness, size, by their touching planets or stars, etc.\n\nThus has been said by the great Seer Garga:\u00b9\n\n7. \"The king who does not honour a scholar accomplished in horoscopy and astronomy, clever in all branches and accessories,\u00b2 comes to grief.\n\n8. Even those who, free from egotism and without anything to care for, lead a hermit\u2019s life in the wilderness, consult the man that knows the motion of the stars.\n\n9. As the night without a light, as the sky without the sun, so is a king without an astrologer; like a blind man he erreth on the road.\n\n10. If there were no astrologer, the hours, dates, asterisms, seasons, and half-years, would all be confused.\n\n\u00b9 Garga is represented as the astrologer of king Vainya, whose domestic priest was the planet Venus, and whose ministers were the V\u0101lakhilyas. See Mah\u0101bh. xii. 59, v. 110 seq., and cf. note to ch. 1, v. 3, here before.\n\n\u00b2 Utpala defines enga and up\u0101nga clearly and concisely: \u092f\u0939\u0932\u094d\u0932\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0930\u093e\u0936\u0940\u0928\u093e\u092e\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u092f\u0926\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0964 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0964 To the pari\u1e63i\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101ni belong, for instance, the purushalak\u1e63a\u1e47am, the ratna-lak\u1e63a\u1e47am, etc. Garga, as quoted by Utpala, puts it thus:\n\n\u092a\u0930\u093f\u091a\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u092f\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941\u0924\u092e\u094d \u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0928\u0940\u0924\u093f\u0964\n11. Therefore a king should consult a learned and eminent astrologer if he desire victory, glory, fortune, enjoyments, and happiness.\n\n12. No one who wishes for well-being should live in a country where there is no astrologer, for where he is the ever-watching and all-foreseeing eye, there no evil will be found.\n\n13. No one that has studied astrology can go to the infernal regions; nay, in the divine world of Brahma the divinator obtains a place.\n\n14.

(the trustworthiness of) these by entering deceitfully statues, etc. (from whence he emits sounds as a would-be oracle); such a person ought in no case to be consulted: he is no diviner.\\(^1\\)\n\n17. A person who without knowing the science exercises the profession of astrologer, is a wicked man, and a disgrace to society. Consider him to be a mere star-gazer.\n\n18. Everyone that acts according to the star-gazer\u2019s advice,\n\nfrom this savasa is derived \u0938\u093e\u0935\u0938\u093e, etc., i.e. \u2018a day reckoned from sunrise to sunrise, a natural day.\u2019 In Bactrian also havana is \u2018morning.\u2019 Another derivation from \u0936\u094d\u0935 is \u0936\u094d\u0935\u094b\u092e \u2018the produced, i.e. not original, borrowed light;\u2019 therefore the Moon is called \u0936\u094d\u0935\u094b\u092e, Bactrian haoma, whereas the producer of light, the unborrowed light, is \u0936\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d, the Sun. As to Vish\u1e47u this also is another name of the Sun. Therefore the hymn, in Rgveda x. 90, that is a hymn to the Sun, is called Purusha-s\u016bkta, the hymn to Purusha (alias: Vish\u1e47u). Cf. Colebrooke Misc. Ess. I. p. 26, seq.

Not a thousand of elephants, not four times that number of horses, achieve so much as one diviner does, who knows the right time and the right place.\\(^2\\)\n\n23.

Farther he analyses the compound \u0924\u0926\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 into \u0924\u0926\u094d and \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924, remarking: \u0924\u0926\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0903 \u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u093e\u092e\u0943\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947; but the Jyotih\u00e7\u0101stram not being mentioned in our passage, the pronoun tad cannot refer to it. The component parts are \u0924\u0926\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 and \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924, or, as another r. has, \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924. The latter means 'different from,' the former, 'cut, held in disrepute,' the verb \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924 being in some cases synonymous with \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f.\n\n\\(^2\\) 'Learning or hearing the harmony between the moon and the asterisms,' means in prose, as Utpaia remarks, simply, 'being told the date of the month and the asterism (nakshatra) of the day,' \u0924\u093f\u0926\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0903\u0903 \u0936\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0915\u0903. The same idea, in other words, occurs in our author's Yogay\u00e2tra, 2, 23, seq. (Ind. Studien, x. p. 170).\nChapter III.\n\nThe Sun\u2019s Course.\n\n1. There certainly was a time that the southern progress of the sun began in the middle of A\u00e7lesh\u00e2, and the northern at the beginning of Dhanish\u1e6dh\u00e2; for this is the statement of ancient works.\\(^1\\)\n\n2, 3. Now-a-days the sun\u2019s southern progress commences at the beginning of Cancer, and the other at the beginning of Capricorn. Any deviation from this rule is unnatural, as may be rendered clear by experimental proofs, either by observing the sun at rising or setting by means of a mark placed at a great distance, or by marking the shadows entering and leaving in a great circle.\\(^2\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Cf.

By returning after passing the winter solstitial point, he brings safety and growth of corn; he follows then the natural law. It is when he takes an unnatural course that he causes danger.\n\n6. When the being named Tvash\u1e6d\u1e5b\\(^2\\) obscures the sun\u2019s orb, it not being the period of an eclipse, he destroys seven sovereigns and their people through war, fire, and famine.\n\n7.

They are baleful if they appear on the sun's orb, but propitious if they appear on that of the moon; yet they are bad even on the latter, if they bear resemblance to crows, headless trunks, and weapons.\n\n9, 10. The symptoms of their being about to appear are: turbid water, a sky covered with dust, a violent wind shattering the tops of hills and trees and accompanied with grit, trees having an appearance as if the seasons were changed, wild beasts and birds vexed,\\(^1\\) a glowing sun. There are, then, also other uncommon phenomena, as whirlwinds, earthquakes, and others.\n\n11. These phenomena exercise no peculiar influence if comets, the T\u0101masakilakas or R\u0101hu, are seen: one has only to tell the influence of the latter, because these are the cause of the former (viz., turbid water, etc.) appearing.\n\n12. In every country where they are seen on the sun's disc, one may be sure that calamity befalls the king.\n\n13. Then even holy men, attenuated with hunger, forsake duty and good behaviour, and get, with starved children at their hands, painfully to foreign countries.\n\n14. The honest citizens are plundered of their wealth by robbers; their bodies are weakened, their eyelids swollen from incessant sobbing, and their eyes filled with tears of sorrow.\\(^3\\)\n\n15. Other people, starved, indignant at what they suffer at the hands of their own king and of foreign armies, give vent to their feelings in talking of the conduct of their king and the doings of the enemy.\\(^3\\)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) 'Vexed,' \u0926\u0940\u0924 or \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0926\u0940\u0924, is an augural term.

The clouds, although they were in successful condition at the time of their becoming pregnant,\\(^1\\) give but little rain at the time of birth. The rivers get shallow; corn grows at but a few places.\n\n17. If a staff in the sun is seen, the sovereign will die; if something in the shape of a headless trunk, there will be danger from sickness; if something like a crow, danger from robbers; if it be a peg there will be famine.\\(^2\\)\n\n18. The sun being marked with things in the shape of royal emblems, like umbrellas, banners, chowries, etc., causes a change in Government; if covered with sparks, smoke, etc., he destroys the people.\n\n19. One of such figures brings famine; two or more tend to the ruin of the king. According as the colour of the figures whereby the sun is covered is white, red, yellow, or black, he hurts the castes severally.\\(^3\\)\n\n20. The danger approaches mankind from the same side as where these great portents show themselves first on the sun\u2019s disc.\n\n21. When the great luminary, with beams turned upwards, is red, it destroys the commander-in-chief; when yellow, the king\u2019s son; and when white, his priest.\n\n22. Variegated, or smoke-coloured rays, cause the land to\n\n\\(^1\\) The Garbhas are the fancied fetuses of the clouds, conceived in a certain period of the year, and born 195 days after the time of conception. See chap. 21.\n\n\\(^2\\) The method after which predictions are framed is simple enough. Since the staff, the sceptre, is a token of royalty, the appearance of it forebodes good or evil, according to circumstances, to the king. A crow, being known as thievish, points to theft. A peg is a means of shutting, and therefore denotes the closure of granaries.\n\n\\(^3\\) White is the colour of the Brahmins, red of the Kshatriyas, yellow of the Vai\u00e7yas, and black of the C\u00fbdras.\nbe disturbed by robbers and battles, unless it rain very soon.\n\n23, 24. The sun is auspicious, when copper red, or russet, in the dewy season; yellow, saffron-hued in spring; pale, gold-coloured in summer; white during the rains; tinged like the calice of the rosy water-lily in autumn; blood-red in winter. At the commencement of the rains he may show whatever colour he uses to show at any other season, and will, nevertheless, bring good luck, provided he be glossy.\n\n25. A rugged sun is pernicious to Brahmans, if white; to Kshatriyas, if blood-red; to Vai\u00e7yas, if yellow; and to \u00c7\u00fadras, if black; on the contrary, a smooth sun bestows good upon the same.\n\n26. In summer a red sun brings danger; a dark one in the rains causes drought; a yellow one in winter produces ere long dangerous diseases.\n\n27. If the sun\u2019s orb is crossed by the figure of the rainbow, he produces quarrels between the monarchs. A bright, shining sun at the time of the rains setting in, brings rain in the course of the same day.\n\n28. In the rainy season he gives rain the same day, if tinged like a Sirisa flower. If he has the dye of a peacock\u2019s feather, it will not rain during twelve years.\n\n29. They assert that there will be danger from insects if the sun be gray, and from a foreign army if he appears ashy. Ruin to that sovereign in whose asterism the sun, while having a flaw, is standing.\u00b9\n\n30. If the sun at mid-heaven has the appearance of hare-blood, there will be battles; if he resembles the moon, the king is about to be killed and a foreigner to reign.\n\n31. A pot-like sun occasions famine and pestilence; a fragmentary one destroys the king; one without beams is terrifying; one resembling a gateway ruins the town; one appearing as if it were an umbrella, tends to the loss of the country.\n\n\u00b9 The asterism, lunar mansion, of a sovereign is the asterism under which his country stands according to the division of the globe, as taught in chap. 14.\n32. Whenever the sun resembles a banner or a bow, is trembling and rough, battles are at hand. A black line on the luminary shows that a royal councillor will kill the king.\n\n33. When a meteor, a thunderbolt, or lightning,\\(^1\\) hurts the Day-god at rising, then you may hold that the king shall die, and a foreign ruler be invested with government.\n\n34. A sun that day for day, or at dawn and evening twilight is surrounded by a halo, or sets and rises blood-red, brings about a change of rulers.\n\n35. When the sun at both twilights is covered with clouds that resemble weapons, he causes battles; when they resemble deer, buffaloes, birds, asses, and camels, he brings danger.\n\n36. An asterism suffers greatly when it is scorched by the sun\u2019s rays; but afterwards it becomes purified thereby, as gold is by the heat of fire.\n\n37. A mock-sun, when standing north of the sun, gives rain; when south, wind; when at both sides, there is danger of inundation; when it is seen above, it is pernicious to the sovereign; when below, to the people.\n\n38, 39. The sun in the sky looking red like blood, or having his disc reddened by coarse dust, brings death to the king before long; being blackish, spotted dark, or accompanied at morn and eve with the dreadful and hoarse shrieks of birds and wild beasts, he is deadly to the people.\\(^2\\)\n\n40. The Day-god bestows bliss upon mankind when his surface is spotless, his orb not crooked, his beams are distinct, large, bright, and long; in short, when he has his natural bulk, colour, and signs.\n\n\\(^1\\) A definition of ulk\u0101l, a\u00e7an\u012b, and vidyut may be found chap. 33, verse 1, seq.\n\n\\(^2\\) Verse 38 and 39 of the text form one stanza in the metre Narku\u1e6daka. Cf. ch. 104, 53; Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, ii. pp. 148, 162; Weber, Ind. Studien, viii. p. 396.\nChapter IV.\n\nThe Moon's Course.\n\n1. One-half of the moon, whose orbit lies between the sun and the earth, is always made bright by the sun's rays; the other half is made dark by her own shadow, like the two sides of a pot standing in the sunshine.\n\n2. The solar rays being reflected\\(^1\\) on the moon that is of a watery nature, dispel the nightly dark, as rays falling upon a mirror (placed at the door of a room) dispel the darkness in the room.\n\n3. As the brightness attaches itself to the moon, on her going forth from below the sun, from the west side, so she rises brighter and brighter in proportion as she is going farther onward from below the sun.\n\n4. Thus the brightness of the moon increases from day to day, in proportion to the difference of her position in respect to the sun, in the same manner as the shine on the west side of a pot in the afternoon.\n\n5. The moon, when taking her course south of the asterisms Jyesht\u00e2, M\u00fbla, and both Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2s, destroys seeds, aquatic animals, and forests, and causes danger of fires.\n\n6. She is evil when going south of Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2 and Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2; but auspicious when going through Magh\u00e2 or Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2.\n\n7. There are six asterisms with which the moon enters into (actual) conjunction before (theoretically) reaching them\u2014viz., Revat\u00ee, and the five following: A\u00e7ivin\u00ee, Bharan\u00ee, Krttik\u00e2, Rohin\u00ee, and Mrga\u00e7iras. There are twelve, the conjunction with which takes place when the moon is (actually) in them\u2014viz., \u00c2rdr\u00e2, and the eleven following: Punarvasu, Tishya, A\u00e7ilesh\u00e2, Magh\u00e2, P\u00fbrva and Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee, Hasta, Citr\u00e2, Sv\u00e2ti, Vi\u00e7\u00e2kh\u00e2, and Anur\u00e2dh\u00e2.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Utpala explains \u092e\u0942\u0930\u094d\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093f\u0924\u093e; with \u0938\u0902\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u0923\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u093f\u092b\u0932\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0903; this passage proves that he is right. In this acceptation the word occurs often enough, indeed, but the Hiudu commentators have commonly misunderstood it.\nremaining nine the moon enters into conjunction (actually), when she has (theoretically) passed them\u2014viz., Jyesh\u1e6dh\u0101, M\u016bla, P\u016brva and Uttara-Ash\u0101\u1e0dh\u0101, \u010crava\u1e47a, Dhanish\u1e6dh\u0101, \u010catabhishaj, P\u016brva and Uttara-Bhadrapad\u0101.\n\n8. (The different forms of the moon bear some resemblance to certain figures). She is said to have the shape of a boat, when she is broad and has one cusp somewhat erected. Boatsmen suffer by it, but all other people will be happy.\n\n9. They call it \u201cthe plough,\u201d when one cusp is half erected. Ploughmen suffer by it, but there is abundance of food, and friendship reigns between the monarchs, even more than can be accounted for.\n\n10. When the southern horn is half erected, then the figure is named \u201cthe mischievous plough.\u201d It causes the death of the King of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya, and occasions warlike preparations.\n\n11. Both cusps of the moon happening to be \u201cequal,\u201d there will be plenty, safety, and rain, as much as in the first days. If the moon rises like \u201ca staff,\u201d the cows will suffer, and the king rule despotically.\n\n12. A moon in the shape of \u201ca bow,\u201d produces battles, and victory will be theirs whose country lies in the direction of the string. The position of the moon in which she is stretched out from south to north, is styled \u201cthe yoke,\u201d and occasions earthquakes.\n\n13. The yoke may be slightly turned up at the southern cusp; then the moon is said to be \u201clying on the side;\u201d this\n\n---\n\n1 The statement contained in this verse is one of those which our author found in the ancient standard works, and repeated out of piety for the \u1e5ashis. The commentator quotes one of those seers, Garga, from whose words we may gather that in his time (i.e. in the time of the author of the work ascribed to the mythical Garga) the Nakshatras had not all of them the same extension. Cf. Weber, Naxatra i. p. 309, seq., where the passage from Garga is to be found. The remark of Utpala, cited by Weber, l.c., after a very corrupt MS., runs thus: \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902 \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902\u0964 \u0928\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0923\u093f \u0935\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0937\u0902\u0964\nruins the chiefs of trading companies, and hinders the fall of rain.\n\n14. If one horn of the moon is turned down, so as to be lower than the upper edge of the crescent, they term it \"the inclined\" position. It makes food scarce, both for men and for black cattle.\n\n15. The moon shows an entirely uninterrupted curved line in the shape of \"the basin.\" At this occurrence princes that govern a province lose their place.\n\n16. The moon\u2014apart from the forementioned positions, being erected at the north side, causes the growth of corn and rain. When turned up north, she is declared to be threatening with death.\n\n17. Anybody beholding the moon with one cusp vanished, or turned down, or without cusps, or the new moon full, loses his life.\n\n18. The rules concerning the different figures of the moon having been told, now her various sizes follow. A small moon is said to produce famine, but a big one to bring abundance.\n\n---\n\n1 The reading of the printed text and of the comm. \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940 is against grammar. Not the curved line (being the subject in the sentence) is called \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920, but the figure. Therefore, the true r. is \u0915\u0941\u0937\u094d\u0920\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940, as exhibited in most MSS.\n\n2 The ten positions (\u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921) or figures (\u0938\u0902\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e) of the moon were well known to Var\u0101ha-mihira as wanting a scientific base. The motive that led him and other scientific Hindu astronomers to attend to such matters is well explained by Utpala: \u0915\u093f\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0923 \u092b\u0932\u092e\u0941\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0903\u0964 \u091a\u091a\u094b\u091a\u094d\u091a\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f (viz. \u0938\u0902\u0916\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u093f) \u0928\u094b\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0935\u0928\u0947 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0936\u0947\u0916\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094c \u0924\u093e\u0935\u094d\u092f\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0924\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0924\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0903 \u0915\u093e\u0926\u093e\u091a\u093f\u0939\u094d\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0928\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u0928\u094d\u0917\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0930\u091a\u093f\u0924\u0917\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0939\u094d\u092f\u0941 \u092b\u0932\u093e\u0928\u093f \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0924\u0947 \u0924\u093e\u0932\u093f\u091a\u093e\u091a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0923 \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0936\u093e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0928\u0941\u0938\u093e\u0930\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0928\u093f\u0964\n\n3 The comm. follows another r.

Being of a moderate bulk\u2014known under the name of \"thunderbolt\"\u2014she threatens with famine and excites turmoils among sovereigns. A moon like a drum brings safety and plenty of food.\n\n20. One may hold that a moon of very large bulk tends to increase the happiness of kings; that a big one causes abundance, and a small one dearth.\n\n21. The moon, when one of her horns is touched by Mars, destroys the savages of the borders, and low princes; when touched by Saturn, she causes danger from war and famine; when by Mercury, drought and dearth; touched by Jupiter, she destroys the chiefest kings; by Venus, the lesser ones. The influence of these planets is trifling in the light half of the month; but in the dark half it shows itself in the manner aforesaid.\n\n22. The moon being crossed by Venus, hurts, during seven months, the Magadhas, Yavanas, Pulindas, Nepalese, Bh\u1e5bngis,\u00b9 Marukuccas,\u00b2 Surashtrians, Panc\u0101las, Kekayas, Kul\u016btas, Cannibals,\u00b3 and U\u00e7\u012b\u1e47aras.\n\n23. When transversed by Jupiter, the moon will afflict, during ten months, the Gandharans, Suviras, Sindhians, Kiras, the grains, the mountains, the Dravida-kings and Brahmans.\n\n24. At the occurrence of a transit of Mars, during a period of six months, the moon will destroy those kings that are prepared for war, along with their chariots, horse, and elephants; also the Trigartians, M\u0101lavas, Kulindas, the\n\n\u00b9 This word is very doubtful; see VV.

When the moon's orb is crossed by Saturn, she will, during ten months, strike with grief the Yauddheyas, royal councillors, Kurus, the chieftains of the eastern countries, and the Arjunayanas.\n\n26.

If the moon, white like the fibres of the nymph\u00e6a or pearls, regularly wanes or increases, and shows nothing unnatural in her motion, disc, rays, or conjunctions, she forebodes the heroes' triumph.\n\n32. By the moon duly increasing in the bright half of the month, the nobility obtain elevation and the people thrive. If the moon wane during that period, all classes of the population decline; if she remain stationary, the condition of the country remains stationary also. In the dark half of the month the consequences of the aforesaid circumstances are quite the reverse.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter V.**\n\n*R\u00e2hu's Course.*\n\n1. Some say that R\u00e2hu is, forsooth, a demon's head, which, albeit severed from the trunk, yet, by virtue of having tasted of nectar, has continued alive and become a Graha (*i.e.* 'seizer,' or 'planet').\n\n2. Having the same shape as the orb of the sun and moon, and being dark, he cannot, forsooth, be seen in the sky except at the period of the nodes, when he appears in consequence of the boon granted to him by the Creator.\u00b9\n\n3. Others declare R\u00e2hu to have a body, consisting only of head and tail, the figure of a snake. Others again tell us that the so-called son of Sinhik\u00e2 is uncorporeal and opacous!\n\n4. Now, if R\u00e2hu, having a round form, were a corporeal being moving through the signs of the zodiac, or if he were\n\n\u00b9 Cf. Mah\u00e2bh. i. ch. 19. The nectar, *amrta* or *soma*, which the Devas and R\u00e2hu drink, *i.e.* with which they plenish and replenish themselves, is the light they borrow from the sun.\na head, how then could he \"seize\" at a distance of half the zodiac, and his motion be subject to a rigid rule?\n\n5. And if his motion were not subject to a fixed rule, how could it be found by calculation? As to the R\u0101hu known under the name of \"Mouth and Tail,\" by what reason does not he \"seize\" at an intermediate distance?\n\n6. And now, the R\u0101hu who has the shape of a huge snake must \"seize\" with his tail or with his mouth; how, then, is it that the part of his body between the mouth and tail does not cover the half of the zodiac?\n\n7. If there were a couple of R\u0101hus, then, at the occurrence of an eclipse of the moon at her setting or rising, the sun too would be eclipsed by the second R\u0101hu, which is at six signs from the former.\n\n8. (The true explanation of the phenomenon is this): In an eclipse of the moon, she enters the earth's shadow; in a solar eclipse, the sun's. Hence the commencement of a lunar eclipse does not take place from the west side, nor that of a solar eclipse from the east.\n\n9. In like manner as the shadow of a tree falls on one side and stretches far, so does every night the earth's shadow by its concealing the sun's light (from the moon).\n\n10. When the moon stands in the seventh sign from the sun, and not too much to the south or to the north, then, on tending onwards, she enters the terrestrial shadow.\n\n---\n\n1 That is, at the distance of five, four, or three signs.\n\n2 Comm. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092e\u0927\u094d\u092f\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0948\u0915\u094b \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0924\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0932\u0940\u092f\u094b \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0924\u091a\u093e\u0930\u0903\u0964 \u0938 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0915\u0947\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0939\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0903 \u0915\u0930\u094b\u0924\u0940\u092d\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f-\u0935\u0947\u0927\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u092e\u093e\u0939\u0964 \u0930\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0938\u094d\u092f \u092e\u093f\u0925\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093f\u0965 \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0930\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u092f\u0926\u093e \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u091a\u0947\u0924\u094d\u0924\u093f \u092f\u0925\u094b \u0935\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0938\u092e\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0926\u093e \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u0902 \u0928\u094d\u092f\u094b\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093f \u092a\u0942\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093e\u092a\u0930\u093f\u0935\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0938\u093e\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u093f\u0964 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0932\u093e\u0926\u0941\u092a\u092a\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u092a\u093f \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u0941-\u0906\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0938\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u0940 \u0926\u0943\u0936\u094d\u092f\u0940 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f: \u092a\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0902\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0938\u094d\u092f \u091a \u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0947\u0915\u0947\u0928\u093e\u0917\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0924\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0915\u094d\u092f \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0926\u093e\u0924\u0947\u0964 \u092a\u0930\u093f\u0923\u093e\u092e \u0928\u093f\u092f\u0924\u091a\u093e\u0930\u093f\u0923\u094d\u092f \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0928\u0902 \u092c\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093e\u0938\u094d\u092e\u0928\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964\n\n3 That is, if she has the same latitude, or nearly so.\n11. The moon moving in a lower sphere reaches like a cloud the sun from the west. Hence a solar eclipse has a different appearance at different places according to the point of view.\n\n12. That which covers the moon is larger than herself; hence her cusps form obtuse angles when she is half obscured. As, on the contrary, the body obscuring the sun is smaller than the latter, the horns of the sun form acute angles.\n\n13. This is the cause of an eclipse, as set forth by masters of heavenly wisdom; the scientific truth may be expressed in these words: \"R\u0101hu has nothing to do with it.\"\n\n14. As to that demon R\u0101hu, the Creator granted him the boon, that, at the period of an eclipse, he should feed upon a portion of the offerings to the gods.\n\n15. Since at that time he is present, \"R\u0101hu\" has become a figurative way of speaking. The northern or southern motion of the moon\\(^1\\) is in mathematical astronomy also figuratively called \"R\u0101hu.\"\n\n16. The occurrence of an eclipse cannot by any means be known from forebodings, as these appear at other times too, nor (if they be seen before an eclipse) are they to be considered as portents.\n\n17. From the conjunction of five planets, to be sure, no eclipse can arise. Nor should the learned pay any attention to (the old method for finding out the direction in which the eclipse shall commence, by pouring) oil in water on the\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In other words, 'the moon's node,' \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092a\u093e\u0924.

In the period presided over by the Creator, Brahmans and cattle thrive, safety and well-being reign, and the grain crops flourish. This likewise happens in the period ruled by the Moon; but there is want of rain in it, and suffering amongst scholars.\n\n21. In the period of Indra, one may expect discord between sovereigns, loss of the autumnal corn, and want of safety. In the period of Kubera, great merchants lose their wealth, but else there is abundance.\n\n22. The epoch of Varu\u1e47a is unlucky to kings, but produces security to others, and good crops. That of Agni, which is also named after Mitra, gives grain, health, safety, and rain.\n\n23. That of Yama causes drought, dearth, and loss of the crops. Any other period of eclipses\\(^1\\) is unlucky, and brings famine, pestilence, and drought.\n\n24. When an eclipse takes place before the (calculated) moment of contact, the fetuses of the clouds miscarry and war will rage; when after the just moment, flowers and fruits will be lost, and there is unsafety and a failure of crops.\n\n25. These effects of such eclipses as take place too early or too late I have mentioned because I have found this in ancient works; for one who knows mathematical astronomy, there can be no question of an eclipse occurring at a wrong time.\n\n26. If an eclipse of the sun and of the moon should happen to occur both in the same month, then monarchs perish by the troubles in their own armies, and war rages violently.\n\n\\(^1\\) That is to say, an eclipse at any other period but that of six months.\n\nComm. \u090f\u0924\u0926\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u092e\u093e\u0938\u094b\u0924\u094d\u0924\u0930\u0935\u0943\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u092f\u093e \u091a\u0915\u094d\u0930\u0903\u0964 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0932-\u091a\u093f\u0926\u0941\u092a\u093e\u0924\u0935\u0927\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0964 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0947: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0903 \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0903: \u092a\u094d\u0930\u092f\u092e\u093f\u0928\u094d\u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u093f\u0903 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0947\u092d\u094d\u092f\u094b \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0926\u093e \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0902 \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902 \u0928 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0915\u093e\u0932 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0903\u0965\n\nA quotation from Garga\u2014\n\n\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u0926\u094d\u092e\u0938\u092e\u092f\u0947 \u0924\u0941 \u092e\u093e\u0938\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0924\u0940\u092f \u0924\u0925\u093e\u0964\n\u0938\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0935\u0947 \u0935\u093e \u0938\u0942\u0930\u094d\u092f\u0947\u0923 \u091a \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0902 \u091a\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0924\u093e\u0930\u093e\u0935\u0943\u0926\u094d\u0927\u093f\u0903 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u0965\n27. The sun and moon, eclipsed at rising or setting, are pernicious to the autumnal corn and to kings; when wholly obscured and seen by evil planets (viz., Mars and Saturn), they bring famine and pestilence.\n\n28. The sun, being obscured when half risen on the horizon, destroys the populace and all kinds of sacrifices; when in the first division of heavens, he ruins those who in their profession make use of fire; men excelling in virtue, priests, and ascetics.\n\n29. The same being eclipsed in the second division, strikes the husbandmen, heretics, merchants, Kshatriyas, and commanders of armies; in the third, the artisans, \u00c7\u00fbdras, foreigners, and royal councillors.\n\n30, 31. Obscured on mid-day, the sun is fatal to sovereigns and the middle-country, but the grain will fetch fair prices; in the fifth division of heavens, he damages grass-eating animals, ministers, women, and Vai\u00e7yas; in the sixth division, women and \u00c7\u00fbdras; at the time of setting, the robbers and savage tribes of the borders. When an eclipse ends in that part of the heavens to which those indicated here before belong, then happiness awaits them.\n\n32.

In the south, he is deadly to aquatic animals and elephants; in the north, to cows.\n\n34. When the demon comes up from the east, he makes the earth replete with water; when from the west, he is declared to be pernicious to farmers, servants, and seeds.\n\n35.

The consequences of (an eclipse of the sun or moon in any of) the lunar mansions must be told according to the geographical division of the earth, taught (in ch. xiv.)\u00b2\n\n43. There are ten kinds of obscuration, termed as follows: Standing to the right, standing to the left, licking, biting at, subduing, total obscuration, assailing, touching slightly, darkness in the middle, and darkness at the outer edge.\n\n44. When the eclipsing body stands to the right,\u00b3 mankind will have plenty of rain, feel glad and safe; when to the left, the people perish by depredations of kings and robbers.\n\n45. The so-called licking takes place when a tongue, as it were, licks around the orb of the luminary (sun or moon). At this event there is great joy amongst all beings on earth, and an abundance of water.\n\n46. They call it \u201cbiting at,\u201d when a quarter, or a third, or even the half is obscured. Then wealthy monarchs lose their treasures, and wealthy countries suffer.\n\n47. When the obscuration, after beginning at the extremities, continues thickened in the middle, it is known under the name of \u201csubduing,\u201d and brings great joy to all creatures.\n\n48. It is a \u201ctotal obscuration\u201d if the dark one long continues obscuring the whole disc; this occurring, he will destroy the chief countries and the chief potentates.\n\n49.

When the darkness is confined to the middle, whereas round it remains a bright ring, it causes the ruin of the middle-country, and danger from gastric diseases.\n\n52. Very thick darkness at the extremities, and very little in the middle, appears in the obscuration called \"darkness at the outer edge.\" At this it is to be dreaded that all sorts of plagues of the country will waste the grain, and unsafety prevail on account of robbers.\n\n53. When R\u0101hu is white, one may announce safety and copiousness of food, but suffering to the Brahmans; when fire-red, danger of fires and affliction to smiths.\n\n54.

Comm.: \u092a\u094c\u0930\u094d\u0923\u092e\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0938 (v.l. \u092a\u094c\u0930\u094d\u0923\u092e\u093e\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0938) \u0935\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0940.\n\n2 Utpala expresses himself accurately in saying: \u0935\u0938\u093f\u0937\u094d\u0920\u094b \u0917\u094b\u092a\u094b \u091a\u0947\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0903, whence follows that Vasish\u1e6dha is a nomen of a gens, like the Roman Julius, Cornelius, with this difference, that in Latin not only is said Cornelii, as in Sanskrit, Vasish\u1e6dh\u0101h, but also Cornelius, whereas in Sanskrit, in names of tribes and nations, a simple individual is denoted by a derivative, e.g. Vdsish\u1e6dha = one out of the family called Vasish\u1e6dha. The mythical ancestor of the Vasish\u1e6dha-va\u1e47\u00e7a is the \u1e5ashi Vasish\u1e6dha, one of the stars of the Great Bear, in the same way as the sun is the ancestor of the S\u016brya-va\u1e47\u00e7a.\n\n3 Schol. \u0935\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0930\u092e\u093e\u0928\u093e\u0903; the expression in the text reminds one of the Latin corpore quaestum faciens.\nA\u00e7makas; in the same year the Rain-god will distribute the rain unequally.\n\n75. By an eclipse in the month of Vai\u00e7\u0101kha, cotton, sesam, and beans will be lost; the Ikshv\u0101kus, Yaudheyas, Scythians, and Kalingas meet with calamity, but there will be plenty of food.\n\n76. By one in Jyaish\u1e6dha, sovereigns, Brahmans, and queens, the grain crops, rain, great associations, the people of the north, the S\u0101lv\u0101s, and also the savage tribes, come to perdition.\n\n77. When an eclipse occurs in \u0100sh\u0101\u1e0dha, one may say that tanks, dikes, rivers, streams, men living on fruits and roots, the Gandharians, Kashmirians, Pulindas, and Chinese, are undone; only in some districts rain will fall.\n\n78. An eclipse seen in \u00c7r\u0101v\u0101na will strike the Kashmirians, Pulindas, Chinese, Yavanas, the people of Kuru-field, the Gandharians, the Middle-country, the K\u0101mbojas, and also one-hoofed animals and corn sown in autumn. In other quarters than those here specified, it makes the earth filled with people rejoicing at the plenteousness of food.\n\n79. The demon, when appearing in Bh\u0101drapada, produces plenty, but causes to perish the Kalingas, Vangas, Magadhas, Surashtrians, Barbarians, Suviras, Dards, and Scythians, and unborn children likewise.\n\n80. When seen in A\u00e7i\u1e47a, the demon greatly promotes abundance, but he will strike the K\u0101mbojas, Chinese, Yavanas, and also the surgeons, B\u0101hlikas, the people dwelling along the banks of the Indus, the \u0100nartas, Pu\u1e47\u1e0dras, Kir\u0101tas, and physicians.\n\n1 The Comm. takes \u091a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0935\u092a\u094d\u0930 as one compound; \u091a\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0935 \u092c\u0916\u093e-\u0927\u093e\u0930\u0903\u0964 \u0935\u093e\u0923\u0940\u0915\u0942\u092a\u0924\u0921\u093e\u0917\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0926\u093f\u0964 \u0924\u0938\u094d\u092e \u091a\u094b\u0926\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937 \u0935\u0936\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u0903\u0964 The translation attempts to retain the probably studied ambiguity of the text.\n\n2 Comm.: \u092e\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0932\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0927\u0902 \u092d\u0935\u0924\u093f\u0964 \u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f\u0924\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0924\u0940\u0932\u094d\u092f\u0903\u0964\n\n3 In this way the word is written in those MSS. that generally follow a correct orthography.\n\n4 For comparison's sake a passage from Par\u0101\u00e7ara is quoted, as being the counterpart to v. 69-80. \u0924\u0925\u093e\u091a \u092a\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\u0930\u0903\u0964\n\n\u0924\u0924\u094d\u0930 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0947 \u0938\u0941\u092d\u093f\u0937\u094d\u091f\u0947\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u093e\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0936\u093f\u0915\u094b\u0938\u0932\u092e\u094d\u092f\u0941\u0930\u0947\u0928\u093e\u092d\u093e\u0935\u093e\u092f\u091a\u0964 \u092e\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0917\u0936\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0947\u0964\n81. There are ten ways in which the separation in a solar and lunar eclipse takes place, denominated as follows: piercing the jaw, piercing the loins, piercing the anus, each of two kinds; bespitting, consuming, splitting the middle, and splitting the edge.\n\n82. The separation in the south-east is known by the name of \"piercing the right jaw,\" namely, in the case of a lunar eclipse. This occurring, the corn will be wasted, mouth diseases be prevalent, kings be afflicted, but the rains favourable.\n\n83. \"Piercing the left jaw\" is the separation in the north-east; it is dangerous to princes royal; and one must expect diseases of the mouth, danger of war; yet, at the same time, abundance of food.\n\n84. Should the emergence happen in the south, then it is called \"piercing the right loin.\" Kings' sons will suffer by it; no other but southern enemies should be attacked.\n\n85. And if R\u0101hu goes away northward, it is what they term \"piercing the left loin;\" then women miscarry and the grain crops are but middling.\n\nIt is clear that Var\u0101ha-mihira had this passage before his mind, but he must have followed other authorities too, and here and there another reading than is exhibited above; this applies especially to the passage about an eclipse in \u0100\u015b\u0101\u1e0dha.\n\n1 For the case of a solar eclipse, see v. 91.\n2 Utpala observes the imaginary character of this and the following separation:\n86. \"Piercing the right side of the anus\" takes place in the south-west; \"piercing the left side of it\" in the north-west. In both cases there will be diseases of the hidden parts, and little rain; in the latter case the queen shall die.\n\n87. If the darkness begin from the east, and go away the same side, then they name it \"bespitting;\" it brings safety, corn, and contentment to mankind.\n\n88. When the first contact in an eclipse is in the east, and the separation in the west, it is what they call \"consuming.\" Then, O! where shall people find protection, anxiously agitated as they are by fear of famine and war?\n\n89. If brightness reappears first in the middle, the separation is named \"splitting the middle;\" it causes intestine troubles, bestows abundance, and yields not too much rain.\n\n90. Brightness at the extremities and thick darkness in the middle is seen at what is termed \"splitting the edge;\" thereby the Middle-country gets ruined, and the grains sown in autumn will be lost.\n\n91. All these kinds of separation must be stated as occurring also with (an eclipse of) the sun; but what in the case of the moon is East, has to be applied, in the case of the sun, to the West.\n\n92. A rain of dust within a week after the end of an eclipse causes the loss of the grain, mist brings danger of sickness, an earthquake the death of a great monarch.\n\n93. A meteor causes a minister to perish; variegated clouds, extraordinary unsafety; thunder, the miscarrying of the pregnant clouds; lightning, vexation by the king and mordacious animals.\n\n---\n\n1 The Comm. r. \u0928\u093f\u091a\u094d\u091b\u0941\u0924\u0935\u093e\u092f\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093f, and supplies \u0924\u092e\u0938\u093f.\n\n2 The original meaning of the term \u0938\u091c\u094d\u091c\u0930\u094d\u0923 or \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0923, as we find in a passage from K\u0101ty\u0101ya\u1e47a, is left unexplained by the scholiast.\n\n3 Comm.: \u090f\u0924\u0926\u094d\u0935\u0948\u092f\u094b\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u093f\u0915\u0902\u0964 \u092f\u0924\u094b \u092c\u094d\u0930\u0939\u094d\u092e\u0924\u094b\u0932\u094d\u0932\u093f\u0939\u092e\u094d\u0964 The same is repeated in the following verse.\n\n4 So the Comm.: \u092c\u0930\u094d\u092e\u0947\u0932\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094b\u093d\u0938\u093e \u091a\u091a \u0916\u0947\u092f\u093e:. There is, however, no cogent reason for this, and it might as well mean: 'of the pregnant women.'\n\n5 These animals are, as the scholiast intimates: \u0938\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0935\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0936\u094d\u0930\u092e\u092d\u0941\u0924\u0935\u0903.\n94. A halo causes distress in consequence of sickness; the glow of the sky, danger from the part of the ruler and from fires; a rough wind, unsafety, owing to thieves.\n\n95. A whirlwind, a rainbow, or a staff in the air,\\(^1\\) brings danger of famine and hostile invasion; a planetary battle, strife between sovereigns; the appearance of a comet does the same.\n\n96. When rain, without any unnatural symptom, falls within a week, one may predict abundance, and all the baleful influences whatever of the eclipse shall come to nought.\n\n97. In case there be an eclipse of the sun a fortnight after the end of a lunar one, distress\\(^2\\) shall be amongst the people, and mutual hatred between husband and wife.\n\n98. But should (as many days) after a solar eclipse be seen one of the moon, then the Brahmans shall obtain the reward of manifold sacrifices, and the people have great joy.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter VI.**\n\n*The Course of Mars.*\n\n1. If Mars\\(^3\\) commence his retrograde motion in the ninth, eighth, or seventh lunar mansion from that in which he rose heliacally, the retrogradation is termed \"the hot one.\" This\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The rendering of \u0926\u094d\u0930\u0941\u092a\u0926 by 'staff in the air,' is only a makeshift, for, although a description or definition of the phenomenon is given ch. xxx. v. 16, and ch. xlvi. v. 19, I have not been able to find out its precise nature.\n\n\\(^2\\) The Comm. wrongly renders \u092c\u0932\u092f by \u0926\u0941\u0930\u094d\u0935\u093f\u0927 'bad behaviour,' as the author evidently meant the compound \u092c\u0932 + \u0935\u093f\u0927, not \u092c\u0932 + \u0935\u093f\u0927. Cf. Goldst\u00fccker's Dictionary, s.v. \u092c\u0932\u092f.\n\n\\(^3\\) It is strange that in the text the noun proper is omitted. To account for the omission we must assume that in the author's autograph every chapter was headed with the words: \u091a\u0927\u2014\u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0924\u093f or \u091a\u0927\u2014; this chapter, e.g., must have been inscribed \u091a\u0927 \u092d\u0940\u092e\u0935\u093e\u0930\u0903 or \u091a\u0927 \u092d\u0940\u0903 \u092a\u094d\u0930\u093e\u0930\u092e\u094d\u092d\u0924\u093f.\ncauses suffering, at the period of the planet's rising again, to those who deal with fire (smiths, etc.).\u00b9\n\n2. When Mars becomes retrograde in the twelfth, eleventh, or tenth mansion, it bears the name of \"the weeping face.\" At the time of the heliacal rising it will vitiate the essences and produce diseases and drought.\n\n3. The retrogradation beginning in the thirteenth or fourteenth mansion is \"the serpent,\" and shows its effects at the period of the heliacal setting. It brings vexation through mordacious animals,\u00b2 serpents, and wild beasts, but plenteousness too.\n\n4. \"Bloody face\" is the name of the retrogradation when Mars moves backward in the fifteenth or sixteenth mansion. This brings instantly mouth diseases, unsafety, and, at the same time, abundance.\n\n5. \"Sword and club\" is the retrogradation beginning in the seventeenth or eighteenth mansion. It causes at the period of the planet's returning to the right motion\u00b3 distress owing to gangs of robbers, drought, and danger of war.\n\n6. When Mars, after rising in P\u00fbrva-Phalgun\u00ee or Uttara-Phalgun\u00ee, goes back in Uttara-Ash\u00e2dh\u00e2, and sets in Rohin\u00ee, he oppresses all the three worlds.\n\n7. The retrogradation of Mars, after he has risen in \u00c7ravana, occurring in Pushya, brings woe to the anointed heads of monarchs.\u2074 (As a general rule) those people that according to the distribution of the countries of the globe\u2075 belong\n\n\u00b9 Utpala observes that this case is an impossible one, or, as he puts it, an unnatural one, whilst he accounts in the usual way for the author's mentioning the case.\n\n\u00b2 Comm.: \u0938\u0942\u0915\u094d\u0937\u094d\u092e\u0915\u0941\u0915\u094d\u0915\u0941\u091f\u0930\u093e\u0926\u092f\u0903 Cf. ch. v. 93.\n\n\u00b3 Comm.: \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930\u0935\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0947 \u0916\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0917\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0924\u094d\u0930\u093f\u0924\u0947 \u092d\u0940\u092e\u0947.

From the form \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0932 in v. 8 we may infer that Var\u00e2ha-mihira considers \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u093e to be the feminine to \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0932\u0915, formed with Sam\u00e2s\u00e2nta \u0915\u093e\u092a\u094d, so that the word is no compound with \u0917\u0924\u093f\u0915, but with \u0917\u0924\u093f. Another form (see below) is \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0932\u093f\u0915\u0940, in the feminine gender; this seems to be the preferable, not to say the only correct form; it is no compound at all, but a derivative from a compound \u092f\u094b\u0917\u093e\u0932\u093f.\n\n3 This passage implies that Mercury, when rising in the natural station, will be visible for forty days, and, likewise, when setting in it,\n14.

XII.\u2014The Mohammedan Law of Evidence, and its influence on the Administration of Justice in India. By N. B. E. Baillie, Esq.\n\nThis subject is of some importance to persons who are resident in Mussulman countries, or our dominions in India, and a brief exposition of it may not be out of place in the Society's Journal.\n\nEvidence is based on testimony, and testimony may be either direct to the point at issue, or to collateral circumstances from which the point at issue may be reasonably inferred. It were, perhaps, more correct to say, that in the latter case testimony is the channel through which evidence is conveyed to the minds of those who have to decide upon it, while in the former case it is the evidence itself. Under the most common systems of jurisprudence testimony of both kinds is received, and the judge is left free to form his own opinion from all the circumstances as detailed by the witnesses. Under other systems, while testimony is equally free, the decision upon it is committed to a separate tribunal, such as a jury. Under both systems there is, perhaps, an inclination to treat testimony, even when direct, as a mere channel of communication, and to take the fact asserted by the witness, entirely stripped of his opinion. There is a necessary exception to this in the case of scientific witnesses and experts, whose opinions form part of their evidence. Under a third system of jurisprudence, only testimony of the direct kind is received, and all right of inference being denied either to judge or jury, the assertion of the witness is raised from mere evidence to positive proof. This is the system of the Mohammedans, and it was probably that of other peoples, at more or less remote periods in their histories, though, amid the increasing transactions of modern times, they have been forced to abandon it. There is some reason to believe that it was once our own.\nTo enable a witness to speak directly to any fact, he ought, generally speaking, to know it on the evidence of his own senses; and this is required by the Mohammedan law, except in a few specified instances, in which a witness is allowed to speak to a fact because he has been credibly informed of it. Even in these instances, he must testify to the fact at issue in the same way as he would do if he had direct cognizance of it by his own senses. Thus, if he had to testify that a particular person is the judge of such a place, or son of such an one, which he may do if he has been credibly informed of the facts, he must in each case positively aver that the individual is the judge of the place, or the son of the person in question, and he must not assign, as the reason of his testimony, that he has been informed of the facts; for if he do so, his testimony must be rejected. The reason for this distinction is, that his own belief is an essential element in his testimony.\n\nFor the establishment of a fact, there must in general be at least two male, or one male and two female, witnesses who concur in averring it in the same terms; and their concurrent testimony is as binding on the judge as the verdict of a jury in England. It is expressly laid down in the authorities that he must decide according to its exigence. The testimony of two or three witnesses is thus legal proof under the Mohammedan law; as it seems to have been in the Jewish. But in the Mohammedan, it is a condition to the reception of testimony that the witnesses be just or righteous persons; and, as none but Mussulmans are just or righteous in the eye of the law, it follows that none but a Mussulman is properly qualified to be a witness. Zimmees, or infidel subjects, are, however, freely received as witnesses against each other, whether of the same or different persuasions; and also against Moostamins or persons sojourning in a Mussulman country, with the permission of its Government. But in no case is the testimony of a Zimmee or a Moostamin admissible against a Mussulman; nor that of a Moostamin admissible against a Zimmee, or even a fellow Moostamin, unless he happens to be of the same country\nas the witness. If the character of a witness is impeached, it must be ascertained by what is termed a process of purgation, or inquiry in the neighbourhood; and if he is found to be a person whose conduct in all matters of gravity is conformable to the precepts of his religion, he is deemed to be sufficiently qualified. It has been already said that the witnesses must concur in their testimony. This is carried so far by the leading authority as to require concurrence in words as well as meaning, though by other authorities agreement in meaning is deemed sufficient. It is only farther necessary to observe that witnesses are not required to swear, the solemn word \"attest\" being deemed equivalent to an oath;\u2014that their character being ascertained by special enquiry before their testimony can be received, it would be inconsistent to subject them to cross-examination as a test of their veracity; and that probably, for the same reason, proof is received only to one side of an issue, and the witnesses are thus prevented from contradicting each other, so that the judge is spared the difficult task of balancing the credibility of one set of witnesses against another. All witnesses must be firmly persuaded of the facts to which they speak,\u2014have no interest in the matter in dispute, nor any hostility to the party against whom their evidence is given, nor stand in the relation of husband or wife, or parent or child, to the person in whose favour their testimony is adduced.\\(^1\\)\n\nIt has been already said that a witness may sometimes testify to facts which he has not seen. The facts referred to are descent, death, marriage, and the authority of a judge; to all of which he may bear his testimony, when informed of them by a person in whom he has confidence. This concession has been made of necessity, because the facts referred to can be seen only by a few special witnesses, and rights of importance dependent on them might otherwise be injured or delayed. In the manifold transactions of modern times the concession can hardly be wide enough to cover all the cases to which it may be impossible to produce eye-witnesses.\n\n\\(^1\\) For other particulars relating to witnesses, see Hamilton's *Hedaya*, vol. ii., book xxi. chap. ii.\nsome remedy for deficiencies of this kind, a reference is made to the oaths of the litigating parties; and it is now necessary to direct attention to the means by which these are to be obtained.\n\nJudicial proceedings are oral. The parties appear in person before the judge, and the plaintiff is obliged to state his case in such a manner as to be met by a direct yea or nay, on the part of the defendant. If the answer is negative, the plaintiff is asked if he has any witnesses, and if he can produce two or more who can testify to the affirmative of the claim, or to the defendant's acknowledgment of it, judgment is at once pronounced in his favour. If he cannot do so, he may call on the defendant to confirm his denial upon oath, with the alternative of judgment being pronounced against him in the event of his refusal. But, instead of a direct denial of the claim, the defendant may prefer to meet it by a plea in avoidance; as, for instance, if the claim were for a debt, and the defendant should plead payment. Upon this the process is reversed. The defendant becomes, as it were, the plaintiff on the plea, and has to go through the same course, terminating with a similar call on the original plaintiff, now become defendant on the plea, to confirm his denial on oath, with the like alternative of having judgment pronounced against him if he refuse to swear. By means such as these the oath of either party may be obtained. But it is to be observed, that it is only on failure of proof by the plaintiff that the defendant is ever allowed an opportunity of requiring the plaintiff's oath; for if the plaintiff can produce two witnesses of character who concur in asserting the truth of his claim, their evidence is legally conclusive.\n\nJudged by English standards, the defects of such a system are obvious; but its principal fault appears to me to be the excessive power which it confers on the witnesses, and the consequent temptations which it holds out to venality and subornation. In this view it may be of some importance to consider its bearing on the administration of justice in India, where it prevailed for centuries before any part of that country passed under British rule, and has never been ex-\npressly abolished. Great changes were made in the constitution and procedure of the Courts of Justice, in the year 1793, by the legislation of Lord Cornwallis; but scarcely anything was said on the subject of evidence. Accordingly, testimony of the exact Mohammedan type has ever continued to be the common staple of all the courts, except those established at the Presidency towns, and is still as strongly marked in the cases now appealed to the Privy Council, as it was in my experience in India more than thirty years ago. From this I think it may fairly be inferred, that the ideas of the people on the subject of evidence have undergone very little change, and that they are still generally of opinion that facts can be properly established to the satisfaction of courts of justice, only by the acknowledgment of the parties, or by witnesses speaking directly to the point, and concurring in the terms of their testimony.\n\nAssuming this to be the case, let us consider how they were likely to be affected by the changes of procedure to which I have adverted. The first of these was the practical abolition of the alternate reference to the oaths of the parties. For, though the judges were allowed to examine the truth of the complaint, or claim, by the oaths of the parties, it was only if they agreed to that mode of examination, a condition which could rarely be fulfilled. This change, therefore, would very much narrow the field of proof according to native ideas, by practically cutting off from it all such facts as were known only to the parties themselves, or could not be proved by the positive evidence of eye-witnesses. The other changes had reference to the character of the witnesses, with regard to whom all distinctions were abolished, and all were alike required to swear, and to submit to cross-examination as the tests of truth. The better classes of Hindoos have a strong aversion to oaths, as by their law none but the lowest caste was ever required to swear; and this change alone was calculated to drive away respectable witnesses from the courts of justice, while as cross-examination might extend to the whole personal history of the witnesses, concurrence in words and meaning, as required by\nthe Mohammedan law, became hopeless, and positive evidence, under the conditions of that law, all but an impossibility. The field of proof, according to the popular ideas of the country, was thus farther circumscribed, if not shut up altogether; and subornation became almost a necessity, while the facilities to it were greatly increased by the reception of all kinds of witnesses, provided only that they would swear.\n\nIf the results have been unfavorable to Indian testimony in general, they are only such as naturally followed from the hasty assumption that the ideas of the people on the subject of evidence are the same as our own, and cannot fairly be ascribed to any greater depravity than is common to other countries; for in all, witnesses are to be found ready to perjure themselves for hire, and suitors unprincipled enough to employ them.\n\nI ought to add, before concluding, that the account I have given of the Mohammedan law of evidence is drawn exclusively from Hanifite authorities; but I do not think that it differs in any material respect from the doctrines of the other sects, except that the evidence of Zimmees, or tributary infidels, is entirely rejected, even in matters between themselves, by the followers of Malik, Shafei, and the Sheeahs.\nART. XIII.\u2014The Mohammedan Law of Evidence in Connection with the Administration of Justice to Foreigners.\n\nBy N. B. E. Baillie, Esq.\n\nIn a paper read to the Royal Asiatic Society towards the close of last session, I gave some account of the Mohammedan law of evidence in connection with the administration of justice in India. I now propose to offer a few observations on the same subject in its bearings on the administration of justice to foreigners in Mohammedan countries. As I shall have to contrast the notions of evidence which such persons may be supposed to derive from the laws of their own countries, with the Mohammedan system, and it may be convenient to run the contrast between only two systems at the same time, I will take our own countrymen as a type of foreigners in general, and I will assume that the ideas of evidence which they carry with them to other countries are the same as those which are prevalent in their own, and are derived from the practice of our courts of justice.\n\nThere are, it is probable, some slight differences between the laws of different Christian countries on the subject of evidence. But I believe that they are all pretty well agreed, or the more advanced of them are agreed, upon one point\u2014viz., that a fact is sufficiently established as the basis of a judicial decree, when the judge, or other tribunal to whom the decision of it may be committed, is satisfied that it is so; that, in short, the opinion of the judge, or other tribunal, is the ultima ratio on the matter of fact; no exact quantum of evidence being usually required, but only so much as may be necessary to produce conviction on the mind. For this purpose testimony of some kind is commonly required. But under the English law the testimony may either be direct to the point in dispute, or to circumstances from which that point may be reasonably inferred. Under the Mohammedan, however, the testimony must always be direct to the point\nitself; and I showed in my last paper that when two or more witnesses, otherwise competent, concur in averring a disputed fact in the same terms, their testimony is so absolutely conclusive that the judge is obliged to pronounce his decree in conformity with it, in the same way as a judge in this country is bound by the verdict of a jury. In most cases the law requires the testimony of two male or one male and two female witnesses, and in all it demands their absolute concurrence as to the facts in issue, the highest authority going so far as to require them to state it in the same words. When this concurrence is obtained, the *ultima ratio* on the matter of fact may thus be said to be the opinion of the witnesses.\n\nBesides this, which may be termed a radical distinction between the English and Mohammedan systems of evidence, there are minor differences between them, as I showed in my last paper, which may be again adverted to, as they may help to complete the contrast between the two systems.\n\nThus, the Mohammedan, as it reposes such entire confidence in the witnesses, takes care that none but persons of established character shall be allowed to give their testimony in courts of justice, and, having provided what it deems to be adequate means for securing this object, does not put their veracity to the further test of an oath and cross-examination. The English law, on the other hand, makes no inquiry into the character of the witnesses, but requires them all, with some trifling exceptions, to give their testimony upon oath, and puts them through the further ordeal of a rigid cross-examination, in the progress of which it allows them to be badgered by opposing advocates, and otherwise treated as roughly as if they had come with the determined purpose of perjuring themselves. Again, since under the Mohammedan law the judge is bound by the testimony of the witnesses, as by the verdict of a jury in England, it follows that evidence can be received only to one side of an issue; while in England, the judge, or other tribunal, being under no such restraint, evidence is freely received to both sides of the issue. Finally, as according to the ideas of Mohammedans, none can lawfully exercise\nauthority over them, except persons of their own faith, and witnesses are in a manner invested with absolute power in the matter of evidence, it follows that the testimony of unbelievers cannot, in any case, be received against a Mohammedan; while in England there is no preference given to one faith over another, but professors of all religions are received on a footing of perfect equality, provided only that they believe in a future state of rewards and punishments.\n\nWhile there are so many points of difference between the two systems of evidence, there is one point on which they are both agreed. They concur in requiring that the witness shall have positive knowledge of the facts to which he is bearing his testimony; that is, that he shall know them on the evidence of his own senses. To this rule there is no exception in the English law. The Mohammedan, however, excepts certain facts which are so removed from common observation, that they can be known only to a few persons, and allows a witness to testify to them when he is convinced of their occurrence, either by the information of persons on whose testimony he can rely, or has himself seen other facts from which it is supposed that they may be legitimately inferred. The particular facts alluded to have been mentioned in my last paper; but it is to be observed with regard to all of them, exceptional as they are, that even here the law adheres to its distinctive principle, and requires the witnesses to give their testimony in the same absolute manner, as if they were testifying to them from the direct evidence of their own senses.\n\nHaving thus adverted to the leading points of difference between the English and Mohammedan systems of evidence, we are now in a condition to compare them together. The English, admitting as it does all kinds of evidence, direct or circumstantial,\u2014there is hardly a question of fact which arises in our courts of justice that does not admit of solution to the satisfaction of the tribunal appointed to determine it. The Mohammedan, on the other hand, excluding circumstantial evidence altogether,\u2014there are no facts that can be established, according to our ideas of proof, except the very\nfew for which eye or ear witnesses can be produced, according as the facts fall within the cognizance of one or other of these senses. The English system of evidence is thus the more comprehensive of the two, and in a manner involves the other.\n\nWhen the ideas of the judge on the subject of evidence are derived from one of these sources, and the ideas of the suitors, or of the professional agents by whom they are represented, are derived from the other, a conflict is likely to arise between the two systems. But when the judge's ideas are derived from the more comprehensive of the two sources, and those of the suitors, or their agents, from the narrower, the judge, though prepared to receive all and more than all the evidence that is likely to be presented to him, having no power to prescribe the kind or amount of evidence that may be necessary to satisfy a particular issue, the elements of conflict will remain dormant, and the conflict itself may be said to be negative. Where, again, the positions are reversed, and the ideas of the suitors, or their agents, are derived from the more comprehensive source, and those of the judge from the narrower, evidence of a kind entirely different from what the judge has been accustomed to is almost sure to be presented to him, and the conflict will be positive.\n\nLet us first take the case of what we may term the negative conflict, as it is exhibited to us in India in the courts of justice which were formerly styled the Company's Courts, but are now known as those not established by Royal Charter. The judge, under the Cornwallis system, was necessarily a covenanted civil servant of the East India Company, and taken from the well educated classes in this country. It may, therefore, be presumed that, though no professional lawyer, he was familiar with the practice of juries, and carried with him the notions of evidence prevalent among his own countrymen. He would thus be prepared to receive evidence of either of the descriptions before mentioned; that is, direct or circumstantial, that might be presented to him by the suitors, or their pro-\nessional agents. But these were natives of the country; that is, Hindoos, or Mahomedans, and it is not surprising that they should be influenced by notions derived from the Mohammedan law to which the country had been subject for centuries before it passed under British rule. Indeed, I gave some reasons in my last paper for believing that this is still the case. The evidence continues to be largely of the Mohammedan type; that is, direct to the point at issue, and the field of direct proof having been reduced by our procedure to its narrowest limits, the greater part of the evidence is necessarily false. It is usually set aside by the judges\u2014native as well as English\u2014for the judges of first instance are now almost exclusively natives of the country) with the remark, that, \"as for the witnesses, those of each party support his side of the case.\" But there is seldom anything besides this kind of testimony from which a rational conclusion can be drawn as to the matter in dispute. The result of any difference between the two systems of evidence is thus negative, and the judge is left to form his judgment as he best can from his own experience, and the probabilities of the case.\n\nWe now come to the case of positive conflict, where the ideas of the suitors, or their professional agents, on the subject of evidence are drawn from the more comprehensive of the two systems, and those of the judge from the narrower. If I have succeeded in making myself fully understood so far, much cannot be necessary in illustration of this position of things. Let us first suppose, then, that an Englishman is plaintiff in a Mohammedan court of law, and his claim is a matter of simple debt. Both the parties appear in person before the judge, and the plaintiff states his claim. The defendant is then asked what he has to say to it. If he simply denies the debt, and the plaintiff has two Mohammedan witnesses who can speak directly to its subsistence, by saying, for instance, that they heard the defendant acknowledge that he owed the money, and no objection is made to the character of the witnesses, judgment must at once be given in the plaintiff's favour. But suppose that the\nwitnesses are not Mohammedans, then their testimony cannot be received against the defendant if he is a Mohammedan, and the plaintiff is without remedy. Or suppose that, whatever may be the religion of the defendant, the plaintiff's witnesses cannot take upon them positively to aver the subsistence of the debt, though they can speak to circumstances from which it may fairly be inferred, here also their testimony must be rejected, and the plaintiff is again without remedy. Suppose, again, that the defendant, instead of merely denying the debt, sets up the plea of payment, and produces two witnesses in support of his plea. Here, unless their character is impeached, judgment must in like manner, and as surely, be given against the plaintiff; for no contrary evidence can be received on his side, and he is not allowed to question their veracity by cross-examination. True, that he may question their character, and then the trial may be delayed for a local inquiry into it. But if the return to the inquiry be in favour of the witnesses, their testimony is absolutely conclusive, and judgment must be pronounced against the plaintiff.\n\nSometimes the plea is so dubious that it is difficult to say whether the evidence of the plaintiff, or the defendant, is to be received, and questions of great nicety occasionally arise on this point, which are difficult of solution. Questions of this kind are of frequent occurrence in works on Mohammedan law, but are so dependant on the nature of particular transactions, such as sale, marriage, dower, etc., that no precise rule can be given for their determination, though generally the *onus probandi* is on the party who has to support the affirmative of an issue.\n\nLet us now reverse the position of the suitors, and suppose the Englishman to be the defendant, and the suit to relate to a claim of property\u2014in a chattel, for instance. This is one of the cases where a witness is allowed to testify to a fact, though he knows it only by inference from another fact with which it is connected. Two witnesses are accordingly produced by the plaintiff, who concur in declaring that the chattel is his property, though they know it only from having\nseen it in his possession. They declare, however, in direct and positive terms that the thing is his\u2014not, however, because they saw it in his possession, for that would mar the effect of their testimony. Still they say that it is his, and this concurrent testimony of two persons of unblemished character, who cannot be supposed to make the assertion except from a thorough conviction of its truth, is evidence that cannot be gainsayed, and judgment must in like manner be given against the defendant.\n\nOr, let us suppose that the question between the parties involves a fact, such as a person's descent, to which a witness is allowed to testify, though his knowledge of it is derived entirely from the information of others. Here, also, if two such witnesses as the law approves should concur in averring the fact, their averment, as it cannot be supposed they would make it unless under a thorough conviction of its truth, must be taken as positive proof of its occurrence, and judgment must again be given against the defendant. To justify a course so foreign to our ideas, as the admission of anything like hearsay evidence in any case, it is to be observed, that the Mohammedan law appears to make little distinction between facts of daily occurrence, and the great facts in Mohammedan history, which command the most perfect conviction, though the knowledge of them has come down to our times on no better foundation than tradition; that is hearsay. Thus, that Aboo-bekr and Omar, the two first Khuleefas, or successors of Moohummud, were the sons of Aboo-Kohafa and Khattdb, respectively, and that Khoodeijah was the wife of the Prophet, and the mother of his daughter Fatima, are facts to which any Mohammedan can testify with the fullest assurance of their truth, though he never saw any of the individuals mentioned. And, in like manner, it is supposed that a witness may be equally convinced of facts of ordinary occurrence, though he has not seen them, and has only heard of them from others. Still, it is only to a few exceptional facts that a witness is allowed to testify from hearsay, or that his testimony, when no better founded, can be received as evidence, however strong may be his belief, or positive his averment of them.\nIt may be observed in this place, that one of the illustrations above mentioned is derived from the Hanifite, and the other from the Sheeah doctors, and that I am not aware of any difference between the doctrines of these two great sects on the subject of evidence, though they differ materially on many other points of importance.\n\nI will now offer one more illustration of the conflict of ideas on the subject of evidence, because, though the case is drawn from the criminal law, and is less likely to occur in the experience of our Englishman, it places the leading peculiarity of the Mohammedan system in a strong light, and makes the nearest approach to circumstantial evidence, without the intervention of the witnesses' opinion, that I have met with in my reading on the subject.\n\nThe case I allude to is culpable homicide. Here, as in all criminal proceedings, intention is of the essence of the inquiry. But the intention may have arisen from ill-will previously entertained, or from sudden impulse. The English and the Mohammedan laws distinguish, in these cases, between the mental emotions, and also between the actions resulting from them. One of these emotions is termed malice prepense in the English law, and the resulting action is murder. For the other emotion it has no distinct name, but the corresponding action is termed manslaughter. In the Mohammedan law the emotions are termed *amd*, and *shoobh-amd*, or intention, and *quasi* intention, and the corresponding actions *kutl*, or homicide, with one or other of these expressions subjoined. Under the English law the distinction between the two kinds of intention, and the corresponding crime, is drawn by the jury from all the circumstances of the case as detailed by the witnesses. Under the Mohammedan, the distinction is supposed to be sufficiently indicated by the nature of the instrument with which the act is committed. When the instrument is a weapon, or something that may serve as such in severing the parts of the body, as a sharpened stick or stone, and an arrow, or the means employed is fire, *amd*, or deliberate intention, is held to be established, and the crime is murder.\nWhere, again, the victim has been struck with something that does not fall within this description, though the blow may occasion his death, the indication afforded by the means employed is only shoobh-amd, and the crime is reduced from murder to manslaughter. This was the doctrine of Aboo Huneefa, the leader of the first of the Soonnee sects. His two disciples, Aboo Yoosuf and Mohummud, maintained however that though the lethal instrument were not of the precise description mentioned, yet if a blow from it would probably produce death\u2014as, for instance, if it were a large stone, or a heavy piece of wood\u2014amd, or deliberate intention, may be fairly inferred, and that it is only when the implement is such that a stroke of it would not probably result in death, that the intention would be reduced to shoobh-amd, or quasi deliberate. The doctrine of Aboo Huneefa seems to have been preferred in India while it remained under Musulman rule, but that of the disciples was adopted by the Government of the East India Company, as coming nearer to English ideas, and continued to be the law of British India till a very recent period. To distinguish the different shades of guilt above mentioned, the Mohammedan law requires that the witnesses should specify the implement by which the deed was done, and that death ensued\u2014as, for instance, that the deceased was slain with a sword. But so far as I can judge from the cases in the books, it is not necessary that they should aver that it was done amdun, or with deliberate intention, that being, it would seem, an inference of the law itself.\n\nFrom what has been said, it is evident that an Englishman must appear under great disadvantages as a suitor in a Mohammedan court of law. Many cases are likely to occur in which he will find it impossible to produce evidence to the satisfaction of the judge, or which indeed the judge can lawfully receive. While in others he may find that judgment is given against him on evidence that would be deemed wholly inadequate in his own country. I assume, of course, that the judge will act in conformity with the great principles of his own law. I know that he is not necessarily a\nlawyer; all that is required of him being that he should have the qualifications of a witness, in order that he may give effect to that power which the witnesses are supposed to possess over the matter in dispute. But, though not a professed lawyer, he has always the Mooftee to refer to, and to keep him right if he is disposed to wander from the straight path of the law. So that any great divergence in practice from the course laid down by the written authorities, is, at least, not probable. Suppose, however, a positive alteration of the law by a mandate from the ruling power, which in Mussulman countries is practically despotic, what would be the consequence? Men do not learn in a day. The judge might, indeed, if so ordered, receive the testimony of an infidel against a true believer. But would a judge, who had always been accustomed to take the fact as directly stated to him by the witnesses, be qualified all at once to decide for himself amidst conflicting testimonies, and from a great variety of circumstances. From the facility with which we see even complicated cases disposed of by our juries, we are apt to suppose that there is a rule of thumb by which men are guided to a correct decision. Practised lawyers, however, know better, and that there is seldom more than one man in our common juries who is capable, even under the guidance of the judge, of estimating justly the credibility of the witnesses, balancing all the circumstances of the case, and giving to each its due weight, and that it is usually through his influence with his fellow jurymen, that they are brought to give a correct verdict.\n\nAs an example of what we have to expect from even sensible and intelligent men, when set to investigations to which they have never been accustomed, I will conclude these remarks with an anecdote which was told to me by a friend who had been long settled in Bengal, not very far from the Presidency. Within the last thirty years the English judges have been authorized to avail themselves of the assistance of assessors\u2014either from their own countrymen, or the natives of the country\u2014in trials which they may deem of sufficient importance. The assessor sits with\nthe judge, hears all the evidence, and at the close of it is asked his opinion, which he accordingly delivers, though the ultimate judgment on the fact, as well as the law, is with the judge. What progress the natives of the country may have made generally under this gradual initiation into the duties of jurymen, I am unable to say. The incident I am about to mention occurred some years ago. My friend, who as I have said was resident at a place in the interior of the country, was asked by the neighbouring judge to assist him as an assessor in some important cases that were coming on. He was obliged to excuse himself on the score of business, but suggested that the judge should avail himself of the service of a highly respectable and intelligent native merchant, who was well known to the judge as well as to himself. The judge's answer to this suggestion of my friend, was to tell him what happened with this very person as an assessor on a recent occasion. \"The trial was of some importance (said the judge) and lasted for several days. During the whole of this time nothing could exceed the patience and attention with which my assessor seemed to listen to all that was said by the witnesses. But when all was finished, and I asked his opinion, his only answer was, joining his hands in native fashion, 'Apka jo hookm,' whatever your honour may order.\" This anecdote I believe to be quite true, not only because it was told me by a person on whose word I can rely, but also because it has such an air of verisimilitude, that I could almost fancy it had occurred in my own experience.\n\nI may add, on the information of an intelligent native of India, recently come to this country, that the native assessors are still much in the habit of watching for any indication of opinion on the part of the judge\u2014not from any feeling of subservience, but apparently from mere incapacity to come to any satisfactory conclusion of themselves. It is fair to say, however, that they have not the benefit of being addressed by counsel, nor, I believe, of having the evidence commented upon and summed up for them by the judge.\nART. XIV.\u2014Translation of a Bactrian Pali Inscription. By Professor J. Dowson.\n\n[The Royal Asiatic Society are indebted to Major F. W. Stubbs, R.A., for the illustrative materials of the following paper. The facsimile of the inscription has been executed in so perfect a form as to be freely legible to ordinarily practised eyes. As Professor Dowson had already distinguished himself in the decipherment of Bactrian Pali writing in his previous articles in this Journal, the explanation of this inscription was, as a matter of course, confided to him. The result appears below. The facsimile of the inscription itself has been reserved for publication, in association with the Mathura series alluded to by Professor Dowson.\n\nThe circumstances attending the excavation of the Tope, near Bahawulpur, and the discovery of the deposit in its foundations, are detailed in the Rev. G. Yeates\u2019 letter to Major Stubbs, of which the following is a copy:\u2014\n\nBAHAWALPUR, February 30, 1869.\n\nMy dear Sir,\u2014I must ask you to pardon my rudeness in not replying to your note long before this, but it reached me just as I was leaving Multan, and I have been on the move ever since. Coming in this direction, too, I thought it better to defer writing till I had an opportunity of again visiting the old tower from which the coins and copper plate were taken.\n\nI regret much that at the time it was opened I was unable to be present. It was in the month of August last, when travelling with my friend, Major Minchin, that, having heard of the tower, we halted near it, but both for want of time and shelter we were obliged to push on, and leave the work of opening it to an intelligent native servant of Major Minchin.\n\nOn Monday last we made a trip out to it, intending to have some excavations made, Major Minchin having sent out his tent and a number of workmen some days before, but we were only able to spend till Tuesday evening there. Not much could be done in so short a space of time, and we were again obliged to leave it in the hands of the\nsame man, with directions to leave everything as he finds it, should anything turn up.\n\nOf what we saw, however, I send the following account, along with the rough sketches of the tower and plan.\n\nThe name of the place where the tower stands is called S\u00fai-b\u00e1h\u00e1r, and is about sixteen miles S.W. of this place, near the road (two miles off it) leading to Ahmedpur. Its present total height is about 45 feet, but report says that 6 or 8 feet have recently fallen. Upon approaching it from the north it is seen that but half of it is standing, having been cut, as it were, right down the diameter passing from N.E. to S.W. Half the entire height is made up of a mound, and about 20 feet above the place where the tower rises from the mound there are the remains of a large square chamber, about 8 feet square, its sides facing the Cardinal points. Above the floor of this the walls at present rise about 11 feet. In the centre of the floor there is a square hole of 16 inches opening into a shaft of the same size down to the top of the mound. This shaft is quite exposed from about 3 feet of the floor down to the top of the mound by the falling away of the half of the tower, whenever that occurred. The tower is solid, built of very large, sun-dried bricks, 17 inches by 13 inches by 3.5 inches, but in the chamber was formerly a flooring of burnt bricks, of the same size as the sun-dried ones, laid in lime cement, with the copper plate bedded in the middle, while round the plate, on the four sides, walls of the same kind of brick and mortar were raised, about 2 feet high, forming a sort of chamber, with the copper plate at the bottom. In this the coins, mixed with some pieces of iron, a few beads, fragments of ornaments, all mixed up with ashes and earth, were found. The men who were charged with the clearing out of this unfortunately pulled the whole of the masonry down.\n\nThe mound, at first sight, appears to be merely a heap of earth, covered now with the d\u00e9bris fallen from the tower, but, upon examination, it turns out to be a regularly-built one, formed wholly of the sun-dried bricks, above described. When we arrived on Monday, about noon, such was the state we found it in; the workmen, already assembled, had dug a few holes here and there in the mound, and had come upon some loose burnt bricks at the south-east. After some consideration, we divided the men into two companies, and thinking there might be a second chamber at some distance, under where the first was found, as in the Tope at Manikyala, we set one of the companies to sink a trench at the middle of the mound, carrying it right into the centre of the tower, as shown by the dotted line in the plan; the others were set to work to excavate the mound where the bricks\n\n---\n\n1 This is not quite clear; above he says, \"In the centre of the floor there is a square hole opening into a shaft,\" apparently of the same chamber. I have written to inquire the meaning.\u2014F. W. S.\nhad been discovered. The result of the two days' labour was the cutting the trench into the heart of the tower to a depth of 10 feet below the original level, or 25 below the floor of the chamber, but, as yet, some 10 or 12 feet to the ground level remained unexplored. Nothing down to this was found. The whole had been well built of sun-dried bricks of unusual compactness. The other work proved more interesting, by uncovering a considerable portion of a firmly-built foundation, arranged as shown in the plan, consisting in some places of a double wall 3\u00b75 feet thick, with a space of one foot between them. These were built of burnt brick, the same size as the others, but not cemented with mortar. Excavation at this place was very difficult, owing to the quantity of loose and broken brick which overlaid this foundation, the remains, evidently, of what had fallen down from time to time from the tower. Three fragments of carved brick were found among these, of which I hope to send you sketches as soon as they come in.\n\nI return almost immediately to Multan, from whence I shall have great pleasure in sending up the copper plate for you to see.\n\nI hear that there is another tower similar to this in another part of this State, about one hundred miles still S.W. of this, at a place called Noshera. I have asked for fuller information respecting it, and as I shall have business down in that direction soon, I hope to visit it if possible. Believe me, &c., G. Yeates.\n\nMajor Stubbs mentions that of the nine coins found, six are of Kanerki, Ariana Antiqua, xiv. 22, and three are of Kadphises, pl. xi. 7.\u2014Ed.\n\nThe Bactrian Pali Inscription discovered by the Rev. G. Yeates, at S\u00fa\u00ed-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, near Bah\u00e1walpur, is a welcome and decisive proof, if further proof were needed, of the correct interpretation of the numerical value of the Bactrian numerals, which I submitted to the Society in a former paper (Jour. R.A.S., vol. xx., p. 221).\n\nThe Inscription is not long, consisting only of three lines. Its chief, perhaps its only, value as an historical record, is centred in the first line, which contains the date and the name and style of the reigning monarch. The letters of the Inscription are well formed, and, what is very remarkable, each word or compound word is separated from the rest by a small space, thus departing from Oriental practice, and conforming to the more simple and intelligible usage of the West. This peculiarity is not so strongly marked in the third line as in the others; but it must be borne in mind that\nthe copy furnished is not an impression or rubbing, but an eye copy, and an eye copy, however carefully and painfully executed, can never be relied upon as being an exact reproduction of the original.\n\nI proceed to give, first, a transcript, and then a translation of the Inscription.\n\n**TRANSCRIPTION.**\n\n1.

On the 28th of the month Daesius, in the 11th year of the great king, king of kings, son of the Gods, Kanishka.\n2. Herein in the ? are deposited the necklaces (rosaries) of the mendicant Naga-data, of Sakha-bhati, of the disciple of the \u0100ch\u0101rya Damataja (and) of the disciple of the \u0100ch\u0101rya Bhavepa.\n3. The patron of this Southern-vih\u0101r, the lay-devotee Balanandi, the banner-bearer l for his own merit and that of his children, wife, and mother (supplies) this shrine and vessel as a protection for all (the relics).\n\nHira-sakhi delt.\n\nThe first line of the Inscription is fortunately quite perfect; not a single character is doubtful, and the whole of the meaning is clearly intelligible. The third letter of the second line is probably a mis-transcription; if not, it is a character with which we are unacquainted. The word in which it occurs probably applies to the place of deposit, but it is not impossible that it is the word *divase*, used in the sense of \"to-day.\" There is a want of conjunctions in this line; but it is not likely that all the names apply to one and the same person. The third line is the most defective; still there is little doubt as to its general sense. *Dhaja-bino* is probably a compound of the Sanskrit *dhucaja*, a flag. *Parivaram* is a word which is used also in the Maniky\u0101la Inscription, and in that I translated it\nby its common meaning of \"train, retinue;\" but the present Inscription shows it to be used in the sense of envelope or covering. *Dadari* or *Daddari* signifies a kettledrum, the vessel containing the relics probably being of that shape.\\(^1\\)\n\nThis Inscription does not extend our knowledge of the Numerals, and it adds but little to what was previously known of the character. It proves, however, that the curl of the foot of a consonant indicates that consonant to be doubled, and not to be always, as hitherto supposed, a consonant combined with *r*. From the frequent combination of *r* with other consonants in Sanskrit, this twist of the bottom of a letter represents the letter *r* more frequently than any other; but as we here find the *s* curled round to represent the *sy* of the Sanskrit genitive, there can be no doubt it represents the doubled consonant\u2014that doubled consonant being here the equivalent of *sy*. In most other instances, as in Achayya for Ach\u00e1rya, it is the equivalent of *r* combined with another consonant. This substitution of doubled for compound consonants brings the language into much closer relation with the P\u00e1l\u00ed.\n\nThe three words written across the end of the Inscription are, I think, the engraver's epigraph. A similar instance will be found in the Maniky\u00e1la Inscription (vol. xx., pl. ix). The final word in both these epigraphs is certainly the same. In my tentative translation of the Maniky\u00e1la Inscription I read the word as *bhavatu*, for it so closely resembles that oft-repeated word in the Wardak Inscription, that, although I even then had the idea of its being the engraver's signature, I did not feel justified in reading it otherwise than *bhavatu*. Unlike as are the transcribed words, *bhavatu* and *kartam*, the original words are closely alike; *bh* and *k* are so similar that one may be taken for the other, and the similarity of the *v* and *r* has often been a great difficulty in interpreting these Inscriptions. As I here read \"Hira Sakhi delt,\" so on the Maniky\u00e1la Inscription I would read \"Sama-sena (or Sachhasena) kartam, i.e. Samasa delt.\"\n\nThe arrogant title of the King, Devaputra, \"son of God,\"\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) See Drawings of the Rangoon Relics. Jour. R.A.S., xvii., p. 299.\nor, as I have rendered it, \"Son of the Gods,\" was borne by several kings of this race. In the Mathura Inscriptions, it is given to Huvishka and V\u00e1su-deva. Those Inscriptions are just ready for publication, and it will be well to defer all comment upon the significance of the title until they appear. It is likely to prove of some importance, as it is found on the Allahabad column, combined with the Sh\u00e1hansh\u00e1hi, who offered presents to Samudra Gupta.\nART. XV.\u2014Indo-Parthian Coins. By E. Thomas, Esq.\n\nSome months ago M. Wold. Tiesenhausen, Secr\u00e9taire de la Commission Arch\u00e9ologique de St. P\u00e9tersbourg, consulted me as to the attribution of a class of coins, representatives of which had newly been brought to light by the discovery, in the Government of Perm, of a small bronze vase containing four pieces of the type in question.\u00b9 M. Tiesenhausen forwarded at the same time impressions in tin-foil and rubbings on paper taken directly from the originals; but as these species of facsimile necessarily suffer from transmission by post, they furnished very unsatisfactory means of tracing the course of the singular and imperfectly-outlined marginal legends, which, in effect, constituted the real enigma to be solved. I therefore applied to my correspondent for more complete copies in less perishable materials, in the form of sealing-wax impressions or electrotypes. To my surprise, in reply I received the three accompanying excellent woodcuts, executed in the Russian Capital, together with engravings of two additional medals of cognate stamp, which, with considerable Numismatic acumen, had been traced in other accessible collections.\n\n\u00b9 As M. Tiesenhausen's letter refers to other finds, and criticises their associations, I reproduce the document entire:\n\n\"Veuillez bien m'excuser que je prenne la libert\u00e9 de vous incommoder en soumettant \u00e0 votre jugement une petite question en fait de numismatique. Voici de quoi il s'agit.\n\n\"Il y a quelques semaines qu'en Russie (au gouvernement de Perm) a \u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9couvert un petit vase en bronze renfermant quatre monnaies en argent, dont j'ai l'honneur de vous envoyer les empreintes ci-jointes.\n\n\"A juger d'apr\u00e8s le type de ces monnaies je serais tent\u00e9 de les attribuer \u00e0 quelque roi indo-scythe, mais cette supposition me semble \u00eatre revoqu\u00e9e en doute par une autre trouvaille (faite en 1851 dans la m\u00eame contr\u00e9e) qui outre une monnaie du m\u00eame genre contenait quelques monnaies sassanides (du VIe si\u00e8cle) et des monnaies byzantines d'H\u00e9raclius et de son fils Constantin. Puis les lettres qu'on voit sur ces monnaies diff\u00e8rent de celles qui se trouvent sur les monnaies indo-scythes.\n\n\"Plus vers\u00e9 que moi dans cette sorte d'\u00e9tudes je ne mets pas en doute que vous ne r\u00e9unissiez \u00e0 r\u00e9soudre la question.\n\n\"Agr\u00e9ez, Monsieur, l'expression de mes sentiments les plus distingu\u00e9s avec lesquels j'ai l'honneur d'\u00eatre.\"\nThese coins are of considerable typical interest, and open out an entirely new field of historical research; but I must confess that my success in their decipherment has not been commensurate with my own wishes, or the too sanguine hopes of my Russian coadjutor. Nevertheless, I do not hesitate to publish what little I have been able to read, and to follow out more largely the associations involved in the die-devices, in the desire of drawing attention to the special subject, and inviting a search for similar specimens in other public and private cabinets,\u00b9 as it is well known that a single letter, on many a defaced piece, will often give the clue to a comparatively complete sentence still wanting in the touch of vitality.\n\nWhile in the stage of preliminary confession, I must moreover frankly premise, that, although in this case almost every typical coincidence points to a near association with the Parthians in Bactria, or more directly southern and western localities, and the leading geographical evidence lends itself to a similar conclusion, yet the authoritative resolution of the ornamental scroll over the horse\u2019s loins (in No. 1) into the Kufic word \u0641\u0635\u0644, would fatally demonstrate that the epoch now suggested must be extensively reduced in point of time.\n\nThe unknown letters on the margin, at the foot of coins Nos. 2, 3, 4, have, moreover, a suspiciously current or cursive appearance, and certainly do not accord with the stiff and formal outlines of the freely legible Malka, in the opening letters of the variety of Syriac here employed. We have too many striking instances, in the series of Indian and quasi Indian Coinages, of the indigenous faculty of imitation, and delight in the reproduction of fixed and accepted designs, at times persevered in mechanically till all trace of the original\n\n\u00b9 Since these illustrative engravings have reached me, a coin similar in general character to Nos. 2, 3, 4 has been discovered in the choice collection of Gen. Abbott, formed in the Hazara country of the Punjab, and which has lately been added to the Numismatic Treasures of the India Office. The piece in question, though it contributes nothing to our knowledge in the matter of types or legends, gives us very significant hints in the direction of identities of metal, which, in the greasy alloy, seems to fall in with the ideas of Arachotian and other Nickel-using sites. See Apollonius of Tyana, quoted in J. R. A. S., xvii. pp. 72, 77; Strabo, xv. c. i. \u00a7 34; Pliny, N. H. 34, 2, and 37, 42; and in these days, Gen. A. Cunningham, Num. Chron., N. S., viii. p. 279, etc.; with Dr. W. Flight, ibid., p. 305.\nseems to fade before the eye; so that typical resemblances and even close and seemingly immediate copies cannot be taken to prove what they certainly would demonstrate under other and less exceptional circumstances; and we may yet have to surrender the choicest of our specimens, in this limited list, to stand as a monument of Bahr\u00e1m Gor's visit to India, or as a symbol of Muhammad bin K\u00e1sim's first intrusion on the Lower Indus.\n\nNo. 1. Silver. Mus\u00e9e Asiatique, St. Petersburg.\n\nThere is little or no trace of Parthianism in these devices, except in the peculiar tooling of the neck ornament.\u00b9 The obverse head would almost seem to represent a young Indian-born Greek, who was so far reconciled to local customs as to wear the moustache, and to recognize the advantage of a turban. The eagle crowning the rider on the reverse may, perchance, further imply a newly erected kingdom.\n\nThe free action of the horse recalls the attitude of the front charger of the Dioscuri of Eucratides, or the single horseman of the Bactrian Philoxenes;\u00b2 but here the huntsman supplants the warrior, and the seat and saddle, and even the horse itself, if truly designed, are Indian rather than Greek. The dog (if such it be)\u00b3 is also an innovation upon\n\n\u00b9 The letters on the Parthian coins are what we should call nail-headed (not arrow-headed), i.e., the characters, instead of being cut out and sunk on the die in continuous lines, are produced by a series of holes drilled in consecutive order upon the main outline of the letter. On the coin itself these stand up like the brass nail heads on a well-made chair. A similar system of dotting the leading outlines of the characters was in favour among the Indo-Scythians in Bactria. An authoritative ink-tracing could be followed mechanically by this means with great exactness, where a free engraving might, under the circumstances, have simply proved impracticable.\n\n\u00b2 Journal des Savants, 1836, pl. ii. 5; Ariana Antiqua, pl. ii. 17; Prinsep's Rawas, ii. p. 187, pl. xv. fig. 1.\n\n\u00b3 It may possibly be the foal following the mare.\nordinary medallic devices. The use of the adjunct of the eagle placing a chaplet on the king's brow was seemingly derived, in the first instance, by the Parthians from Roman teachings; it appears on the coins of Phraates IV. and Tiridates II. (B.C. 37), but soon gives way to the more natural winged figure of victory. The legend on the obverse I am as yet unable to decipher, but I must add, that I have neither seen this particular coin, nor even obtained rubbings or impressions of it. The curious ornamental scroll over the crupper of the horse has been read in St. Petersburg as the Arabic term \u0646\u0642\u0644 \"excellence, wisdom;\" but although such an interpretation might be put upon the letters as they appear in the woodcut, I should not, as at present advised, be disposed to concur in any such rendering, though I must confess that the word in front of the king's profile looks more like cursive and comparatively modern Sassanian Pehlvi than any other scheme of writing with which I am acquainted.\n\nNo. 2. Silver. Cabinet of Comte Stroganoff.\n\nThis coin and the two succeeding specimens present us with more distinct Parthian peculiarities. The head-dress on the obverse would, at first sight, appear to have nothing in common with the ordinary upright Tiara helmet of the\n\n1 Longp\u00e9rier, pl. ix. 8, 9; x 5, 6, 7; Lindsay, pl. iii. 55, 56, 57.\n2 This seemingly top-heavy head piece owes all its misrepresentation to the profile treatment\u2014conventional with the Parthians and Sassanians. When brought to the test of modern helmets, but little exception need be taken to its form or balance; it follows in its construction the far more ancient pattern of the Assyrian kings; and the curious in these matters can examine both the prototype and the modified adaptation in extant specimens in the British Museum. The earlier casque is close and compact, sitting well on the skull, while the Parthian pattern, though raised enough in its side-glint as to suffice to awe the Romans, was really a better protection against a direct blow than the previous model, and far more effective under the military aspect. The specimen in the British Museum is little more than a well-made steel morion, without the flaps, fully realizing the\nImperial dynasty; but although the local turband is retained in a somewhat reduced and modified shape, the ornamentation at the top, so seemingly exceptional, can be readily traced to an association with the crest pattern introduced by Phraates II. (B.C. 136\u2013126), and maintained in occasional use by Sanatruces\u00b9 (B.C. 77\u201370), finding favour among the local kings of Edessa,\u00b2 and appearing in a less formal design on the Eastern Parthian coins of Sanabares\u00b3 (A.D. 2). The horseman on the reverse is a close copy (even to the details of the double-thonged whip and occasional hooked ankus) of the charger, which continued to furnish the standard device of so many monarchs of the Parthian race in Bactria, Gondophares, Abdagazes, Arsaces, etc., whose dates are roughly assumed at from about B.C. 26 to 44 A.D.; and, singular to say, we have an example of a nearly similarly outlined horse in the Parthian Imperial series proper, on the money of Artaban III. (on a coin dated in A.D. 13), where the unkempt hair around the front face of the monarch, typical of the fashion prevailing amid the tents of the Dah\u0153 (?) nearly fills one surface of the coin, while his charger on the reverse might fairly claim kindred with the Bactrian-bred steed.\u2074\n\nThe physiognomy of the king on the obverse of Nos. 2, 3, 4, bears no analogy to the conventional Parthian portraiture, but is clearly derived from Indian ideals of the human face. The almond eye, the slight moustache, and the smooth-shaved rounded jowl, all associate themselves with Eastern models, ranging from the Kodes coins of Seist\u00e1n\u2075 on the one side to the earlier Surashtran pieces of the S\u0101h kings,\u2076 and the later types retained by the Guptas.\u2077 Hence, in admitting local influence in the composition of the profile,\n\n\u00b9 Longp\u00e9rier, pls. v. 7, 8, 9.; vii. 4, 5.\n\u00b2 Bayer, Historia Osrhoena.

The essay in question being avowedly fragmentary and incomplete,\nhas, I regret to say, been temporarily withdrawn from circulation, so that I may\nbe accused of parading references to a comparatively inaccessible work. This\nobjection has, however, been in a measure removed by the reproduction of the\nauthor's leading classifications in M.M. Rollin et Feuardent's Sale Catalogue\nof 1864, where the various coins are described in consecutive order, and the more\nprominent modifications in the historical arrangements introduced by M. de Long-\np\u00e9rier, are clearly given under his sanction. Apart from the leading triumphs of\nM. de Longp\u00e9rier's latest rectification of the recognized French Specialit\u00e9 in Par-\nthian Numismatics, I may add that no series of Oriental coin illustrations of equal\nmerit has been produced in Europe since Marsden's time; and if the author should\nstill feel any hesitation or reserve in publishing the necessarily elaborate details of\nsuch an obscure and complicated section of the world's history, he has already so\nsuccessfully encountered in part, let us hope that he will, at all events, permit this\npresent generation to benefit by the admirably arranged pictorial classification of\nthe existing plates that illustrate his prize essay.\nArsacidan dynasty became finally extinct. But, here again, we must be cautious how we pronounce for any definite period for these fashions, or pretend to determine priority of usage, even if the more safe course would not be to refer both adaptations to more or less pervading provincial designs.\n\nNos. 3, 4. Silver. Cabinet of Comte Stroganoff.\n\nThe monogram, at the back of the horseman on the reverse, offers another instance of the strange modifications ancient devices may be subjected to, in the hands of artists who probably did not comprehend the intent and meaning of the prototype. I have felt some diffidence in identifying the odd jumble of lines on No. 1 as a reproduction of the Parthian eagle; but, in truth, the original designs, on the Imperial issues, did not contribute any very exact delineation of the sacred bird, and the Indian copyist may have been even less instructed in ornithology and less conversant with the flight of eagles than the Western designers; while his own imitators may well have failed to detect a likeness he himself was incompetent to give effect to. Be this as it may, the symbol or device on Nos. 2, 3, and 4 has clearly arrived at the monogrammatic stage, though quaint traces of the bird's head are still to be detected on Nos. 2 and 3. The monogram, in its advanced form, is assimilated to several designs in favour with neighbouring dynasties; in its lower limbs it singularly accords with the special stamps or crypto-monograms employed by Kadphises, Kanerki, and Ooerki; while in its central upper portion it approaches nearer to the Indo-Sassanian design, which occupies the entire coin reverse, depicted in pl. xvii. fig. 20 of Wilson's Ariana Antiqua, and otherwise, in\n\n1 Ariana Antiqua, pl. x. 5; xi. 16; xiv. 1; and pl. xxii.

Those illiterate savages, the Parthians, finding themselves, amid the chances of conquest, domesticated foreign rulers; in the absence of an alphabet of their own, very wisely accepted the varieties of writing current in the localities in which they settled. Among the leading and more important systems they are found to have taken advantage of, the following may be enumerated:\n\n1. Greek, which was taken over as the Court and Official language, ruling in the dominions of the Seleucid\u00e6, about 255 B.C.\n\n2. The Bactrian, or the special adaptation of an originally Semitic alphabet for the expression of an Aryan language, which appears upon Parthian coins, about 110 B.C.\n\n3. Various forms and modifications of Ph\u0153nician and Aramaean, in use on coins following the leading type of the Tetradrachms of Euthydemus of Bactria, of uncertain date; and several other modifications of an old type of Syriac, such as that found on the coins of Edessa, and subordinate branches of coinage of indeterminate locality, hereafter to be noticed.\n\n4. The double alphabets of the Pehlvi (now discriminated as Chaldaean and Sassanian), which intrude among the Greek legends so early as A.D. 2, and which finally supersede the Greek itself about the third century, A.D.\n\nThe present inquiry is only secondarily concerned with either the Greek or the Bactrian alphabetical adaptations of the Parthian dynasties, nor does it seem to touch, except in a subordinate degree, any of the outlying branches of the duplicate Pehlvi systems; but these concessions limit, in a corresponding degree, the free area of interpretation of the characters now under consideration; and, as such, I have to examine them with more formality than I should otherwise consider their due. The first outwork to be assailed is the\nseries of the once-denominated Characene imitations of the Euthydemus' type.\\(^1\\) Now that M. W. H. Waddington has so critically drawn within its proper circle the heretofore loose arrangement of the issues of Characene dynasty, we find that their coins have no connexion with the Bactrian series beyond an irregular derivation in common from the leading types of Antiochus II., whose medallic designs were imitated alike by Euthydemus of Bactria, and other more Western claimants for dominion, under a possible notion of some hidden virtue in his conventional Numismatic \u00c6gis. So that the entire series of degradations from the pure Euthydemus type must be made to adhere to their own definite matrix, or limited to exceptional prototypes of Antiochus II. in his good Greek form, but entirely divorced from the bearded portraits, whose living originals ruled over the migratory Arab tribes at the head of the Persian Gulf.\\(^2\\)\n\nNow that the general horizon has been cleared and the imitations of the original Euthydemus' type may be treated independently on their own merits, they are found to declare themselves as unmistakably Parthian. Some of the preliminary degradations probably follow merely decadent Greek models, but when once Greek letters so entirely disappear as to leave only their shadow behind them, from that moment the epigraphs merge into more or less intelligible barbarian or composite and exceptional writing, and associate themselves with a correspondingly deteriorated representation of the classic face of Euthydemus, the Magnesian. The importance of these coins, therefore, in the present case, only commences when they are sufficiently degraded to have emancipated themselves from all reminiscences of Greek writing, and then, strange to say, they become so completely Parthian in their obverse types as to admit of ready identification with the portraits of certain members of the Imperial list, whose tiaras are distinguished by modifications, which, as has been already shown, they share in com-\n\n\\(^1\\) Revue-Numismatique, Paris and Blois, 1866, p. 303. See also Mr. Vaux's paper in the Numismatic Chronicle, O. S. xviii. 137.\n\n\\(^2\\) M. Waddington's list extends from Hypsasines, B.C. 124, to Attambelus V., who dates subsequent to 122 A.D.\nmon with the Indo-Parthian pieces which form the special subject of the present notice. The chief peculiarity of the later imitations of the Euthydemus' type consists in the substitution of a coarse bossed helmet for the classic chevelure of the Greek commander; and coincident with this change, the helmet itself is ornamented with a sort of spiked-crest, similar to the Edessa and other varieties of the Parthian tiara; and, more remarkable still, the debased type copies directly the cheek-plate or bar in front of the ear, which first occurs among the various coin portraits of Mithridates I. (B.C. 173\u2013136),\u00b9 the earliest Arsacidan who fully penetrated into these lands;\u00b2 its next appearance is on the money of Phraates II. (B.C. 136\u2013126),\u00b3 when it is associated with the curious crest ornamentation, which the French Numismatists describe as \"une tiare spherique orn\u00e9e de figures de cerf et d'une corne de taureau.\"\u2074 The Mithridates' tiara is nearly covered with bosses, and the Phraates' helmet retains them in equal prominence, as far as the alteration of pattern permits. However, without insisting upon any direct and immediate reproduction, these coincidences are curious, and their specification is necessary to prepare the way for the consideration of the legends themselves. I take these up at the point mentioned by M. R. Rochette, in his notice of the collection of the Baron Chaudois, where they are described as \"toujours figur\u00e9e avec les m\u00eames caract\u00e8res.\"\u2075\n\nThe number of letters on these debased pieces is only seven in all, which I transcribe into modern characters as Malk\u00e1 Isak, \"King Arsaces.\"\n\nThe most anomalous incident connected with these legends is the odd variety of alphabetical systems from which these few letters seem to have been derived, or, under our obligations of trying back for identifications, to how many con-\n\n\u00b9 Longp\u00e9rier, pl. iii. 8; Lindsay, i. 18\u201320.\n\u00b2 Vaillant, i. 40.

The initial \u03a9 M, allowing for its being reversed, belongs to the Phoenician series of Esimunasar of Sidon (599 B.C.). The \u039b L might stand for a reversed \u03a9 s of Sargon\u2019s time, or the Greek \u03c2 s on the coins of Arsaces V. The \u039a k follows the old model of a Phoenician \u039b G, a form which was preserved in many varieties of Aramaic and Pehlvi. The \u0391 \u03b1, final, is more like a Chaldaean-Pehlvi \u039d T than an ordinary Semitic \u0391, and it is only by reverting to the Syriac of Edessa that we gain a hint as to its original formation. The \u2019 r in Isak or Asak has to be taken from the Sassanian alphabet, and a similar origin has to be assigned to the succeeding \u03a9 s, the modern Pehlvi \u03c9 and \u03c9 respectively. And the final \u039a k is a repetition, not always constant, of the third letter which precedes it in the name.\n\nThere are two other classes of coins which seemingly have a direct or indirect bearing on the present inquiry, and therefore may claim a passing notice. The first in order are the series in silver and copper, originally made known to us by Sir A. Burnes\u00b9 in 1833. They present on the obverse a well-executed Phoenician-looking head, uncovered except by the bandeau, which forms the fillet; the hair itself being allowed to fall heavily at the back of the head, but it is cut square over the eyebrows;\u00b2 there are traces of a slight moustache, and a crescent over the forehead completes the picture. On the reverse there is a crude fire altar, the central support of which is worked into an odd device like a balustrade. The legend is as follows:\n\nThis I transcribe in modern characters as \u05de\u05b7\u05dc\u05b0\u05db\u05d5\u05bc\u05ea\u05b4\u05d9 \u05de\u05b4\u05d9\u05db\u05b8\u05dc Malk\u00e1 Mikal [\u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3 \u039c\u0395\u0393\u0391\u039b\u039f\u03a5.] The initial \u039c M there can be no difficulty about. The \u039b L is similar in form to the \u039b already adverted to on the Barbarous Euthydemus\u2019 money. The\n\n\u00b9 Journal As. Soc.

The \\( \\text{L} \\) is admittedly exceptional in form, but we have authority enough for its true value in parallel writings. The \\( \\text{P} \\) is also a doubtful letter, and liable to be confounded with the \\( \\text{U} \\), neither, of which are quite positive.

C. xviii. pl. i. fig. 1), but the consistency of outline is not maintained in the extant examples; indeed, some of the letters which I propose to read as \\( \\text{H} \\) may as well be taken for little used \\( \\text{Y} \\). My greatest difficulty, however, was to satisfy myself of the import of the opening letters in the parallel lines on the reverse, which are, perhaps, the most important as well as the most strange characters of the whole series; they would match with no single example of the extant alphabets. At first sight I suspected them to be strangely perverted \\( \\text{I} \\) \\( \\text{G} \\)'s; they had something in common with a Nestorian \\( \\text{I} \\) \\( \\text{H} \\); some subordinate likeness to a Palmyrene \\( \\text{I} \\) \\( \\text{H} \\); but at last it struck me that they must be considerably modified forms of the Samaritan \\( \\text{I} \\) \\( \\text{N} \\), which is enlarged at the point and dotted in several of the later alphabets.\n\nThe most singular part of the whole set of anomalies, here encountered, consists in the use of the Izd\u00edfat, or short \\( \\text{I} \\), as the connecting genitive, prefixed to the words \\( \\text{R} \\) \\( \\text{M} \\); some such system of definition, however, was probably already in\nvery unusual form of that letter; and here, again, the character might equally be resolved into a \u1f08\u03a4. The remaining letters are all repetitions except the 'I, which follows a Sasanian Pehlvi model, the \u1f51\u03c2 of the modern Pehlvi.\n\nWe have no direct means of determining the locality to which these coins belong. The Fire altar on the reverse points to Persian associations, and the style of the letters, without limiting their site to Mesopotamian kingdoms, clearly indicates a derivation from or connection with some of the indigenous branches of writing, which possibly influenced in their spread the alphabets of the Southern coast towards the Indus.\n\nThe other class of coins to which I have alluded as possessing some features in common with the series under review, have heretofore been known by the designation of \"Kodes,\" whose name they bear in imperfect Greek characters. These pieces were ordinarily associated with the issues of the Bactro-Greek dynasties, but later investigation proves them to have followed on in succession to certain types of Antiochus II.,\n\nuse in these localities, as we find on the earliest Pehlvi coins of Ziad-i-Ab\u00fa Sofi\u00e1n and his successors a similar method of conjunction (J.R.A.S. xii. p. 290). It must be admitted that these results are anything but conclusive; still, a beginning has to be made somewhere, and new materials and frank discussion may equally advance the present inquiry. Though looking to the confessed imperfection of Sabean alphabetical systems in general, and the very damaging examples of defective spelling, immediately contributed by the Characene prototypes, under their Greek aspect, the rehabilitation of which has ever left incertitude in M. Renan's mind, there need be no reserve in acknowledging the difficulty of fixing the values of the letters, or determining the meaning of the legends contributed by the imperfectly settled communities, who were not bound to follow any one system, either in language or orthography, but who lived in the happy facility of borrowing terms, and their means of expression, at will, from any of the more advanced nations encircling their own quasi-desert life. The Numismatic links in the chain of evidence are, on the other hand, singularly complete; and, if it depended solely on their indications, there would be little hesitation in pronouncing that the coins themselves must belong to some local governor, on the part of the Romans, over the dominions of the Mondar Arabs of Ir\u00e1k, and probably represent Trajan's conquest of lower Babylonia in 116 A.D., associated with the submission of Attambilus of Mesene (Dio Cass, lxviii. 28; Sale's Kor\u00e1n, preface, p. 13).\n\nThe Greek monograms accord with such an inference, and the Syriac monographic letters AM occur in like manner upon the direct imitations of the Characene coins bearing the name of Ibigana, already adverted to.\n\nThese coins are not uncommon in Northern India, but, as far as my own experience extends, they are usually met with as isolated specimens, as if their point of issue had been elsewhere; on the other hand, to judge of the localities whence the other examples of the class have been obtained, there is no reason to refer their origin to any specially Mesopotamian site.\npossibly through the intermediary of another (local) prince of the same denomination. The proper Kodes coins bear on the obverse a head, imitated from the prototype of Antiochus II. with the Bucephalus reverse,\\(^1\\) but which had already passed through one stage of degradation at the hands of an Antiochus, who modified the profile considerably, and notably departed from Greek rules in the introduction of the light moustache, the reversal of the direction of the head, and the introduction of a Semitic legend. The head of Bucephalus is here replaced by a Scythic archer, but the Greek legend, hopelessly debased, of \u0392\u0391\u03a3\u0399\u039b\u0395\u03a9\u03a3 \u0391\u039d\u03a4\u0399\u039f\u03a7\u039f\u03a5, is perpetuated in as much completeness as provincial knowledge could still achieve, and the quasi Semitic legend on the obverse resolves itself into the component elements of \u1f08\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5, Ant\u0101ku or Antadku.\\(^2\\) The succeeding Kodes coins themselves are marked by a similar obverse head, which returns to the normal position; but the device on the reverse is modified into a spearman, with flames issuing from his shoulders, a peculiarity he shares with the figures of the Kanerki Indo-Scythians,\\(^3\\) while other types of Kodes money reproduce the Bucephalus head of Antiochus II. The legends of these issues are couched in imperfect Greek, which may be restored as follows:\u2014\u03ba\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd (at times \u03c4\u03c1\u03ba\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd), and on the reverse \u03bf\u03c1\u03bb\u03b7\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4 \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4 (sic) [\u039c\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2] (coin) of Kodes (the guardian) of the sacred great fire. But it is doubtful if Kodes is a name at all, and its conjunction with the \u03c4\u03c1 \u03a6\u0391\u039d Fire (Persian \u0647\u0648\u0631\u060c \u062e\u0648\u0631\u060c \u0647\u06cc\u0631\u060c \u0647\u0631\u060c \u0647\u0631\u060c as in \u0647\u0631\u060c \u0647\u0631\u060c the ur of the Chaldees)\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Seleucus Nicator introduced this device, which is supposed by some Numismatists to refer to Bucephalia on the Jhelum. (Leake, Num. Helen, i. 21; Num. Chron. xviii. 138; Tr\u00e9sor de Numismatique, Rois Grecs. p. 84.) Mithridates I. of Parthia and Phraates I. make use of this type. (Mionnet, v. 649; Tr\u00e9sor de N. pl. lxvii. 7; Longp\u00e9rier, pl. v. 12.)\n\n\\(^2\\) Much licence has to be claimed in arriving at this result. The leading alphabet is Chaldaeo-Pehlvi, and the first, third, fourth, and seventh letters follow that system consistently, but the second letter is a bad Greek \u039d, and the penultimate is rather Bactrian in its aspect; and, moreover, it must be noted that the Pehlvi \u039d A's consist of a mere cross, which might otherwise authorise their being read as D M's.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ariana Antiqua, pl. xii.; Prinsep's Essays, i. p. 124, etc.\nmay require its identification with some of the derivative forms of \u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 purus fuit. Such a combination would have this to recommend it, that it would form a near transcript of the \u039f\u03a1\u0391\u0397\u0395\u03a1\u039f\u03a4 \u039c\u0391\u039a\u0391\u03a1\u039f\u03a4, which being analyzed may be resolved into \u0627\u064e\u0631\u0652\u062f \u201cgreat,\u201d \u0391\u03b8\u03c1\u03cc, \u201cfire,\u201d \u201c\u039c\u03ac\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1, \u201cblessed.\u201d In this case the coins themselves might be supposed to have been minted by the hierarchy of some great Fire temple. The Semitic legend occurring upon certain varieties reads freely as \u039a\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf Kodo, but there are three letters following this word, new examples of which may alter or confirm the whole interpretation above suggested. At present, however, the only moderately clear impressions within reach give outlines of the characters \u039d\u039d\u039d, the two first letters being consistent in alphabetical derivation with the rest of the legend, but the final takes the form of an old Syriac or Estranghelo. Accepting, for the moment, this transcription, the general sense would be well preserved, and in accordance with the Greek, in \u0643\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0643\u0647 or \u0643\u0648\u062f\u0648\u0643\u0647 \u201cSacred Temple.\u201d The monogram of the Greek \u039a obviously suggested the appropriate locality of \u039a\u03b1\u03c1\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd, but the more advanced identifications which now force themselves into notice tend to move the accredited site further eastwards, nearer to Rustam\u2019s home in Seist\u00e1n.

The mistake I made was caused by my accepting the more artistically finished coins as affording the most correct form of the legend, whereas, as has been seen in the case of the imitations from the Euthydemus type, the inferior Greek copyists could neither do justice to the one alphabet or the other, and it required a complete surrender of the die execution to home-bred artists before any consistency in the definition of the native legend could be secured. My main error was in the admission of the third letter of the name as a Pehlvi whereas the true form is shown in the third character in the Malika of the present series (Nos. 2, 3, 4). The final o in the better coins was also deceptive, as the proper had an additional limb attached, like the ordinary Pehlvi (Num. Chron. N.S. iv. 210; J.R.A.S. iii. N.S. p. 250).\nprovince, and the name he gives to the sacred shrine, though disfigured in the MSS. copies, is not far removed from possibly irregular forms of Koddos; beyond this, less archaic references may be cited in Edward Conolly's map, where a very large, though indefinite, space near Zaranj is designated as \"Kuddeh;\" and looking back to the single unadulterated facsimile of Istakhri, given in all mechanical detail from an original MS., we may trace very definite outlines of the name (without the points), on nearly the same ground, between Zaranj and Bust. Even in the same way, though not to force examples, the preferential crops up in one instance in Masaudi's MSS. as \u0643\u0631\u0643\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0646 and \u0643\u0631\u0643\u0631\u0643\u0627\u0646.\n\nI have now completed, as far as present means permit, the introductory evidence bearing either upon the typical or paleographic characteristics of the five coins which form the leading object of the present notice, and nothing remains but to say so much as may safely be said of the imperfect legends on their surfaces; the initial \u03a9, though varied in outline in the existing specimens, is clearly an \u03a9 or \u03a9 of the joint Pehlvi schemes of writing, following the general design, though varied in the manipulation of the earliest and pervading model of the Semitic \u03a9 \u03a9.\n\nThe second letter might be taken to be a modification of the Chaldao-Pehlvi \u03a9 L, but as we have seen that a nearly identical character on the Kodes coins, where its value is assured by the Greek context, stood for the Semitic \u03a9 D, it\n\n---\n\n1.

This is a conclusion which, indeed, accords with the general Indian associations of the coins themselves. We have frequent instances of the use of \\( \\text{Marka} \\) for Malka, and here we have only to extend the licence to the local \\( \\text{p} \\), which is often indistinguishable in sound to foreign ears from the \\( \\text{n} \\).\n\nThe third letter in the order of reading, from the outside of the coin, I have assumed to be a \\( \\text{k} \\), a very early definition of which, in almost identical conformation, may be traced in the parallel writing of more western sites, and the back stroke of the Bactrian system further satisfies local identifications. The final \\( \\text{a} \\) is a confessed difficulty, and it becomes a still more palpable obstacle in the present instance, where in the indefinite formation of the letters it may be taken for an \\( \\text{m} \\), like the associate initial, or a \\( \\text{t} \\) derived from independent schemes of writing. Singular to say, of all the letters of the Semitic alphabet, the opening Alif was the one most subject to empirical modifications, dating from the primitive imitation of a Bull\u2019s head of the earliest graphic system, to the severe perpendicular line of the Kufic and modern Syriac. The \\( \\text{a} \\) of the Edessa coins follows the most Archaic form of the Ph\u0153nician \\( \\text{ain} \\), but it varies so far from some of the more advanced Ph\u0153nician derivatives, which have an opening at the top of the round \\( \\text{o} \\),\\(^1\\) that it occasionally has this gap in its own legitimate line of writing,\\(^2\\) to the left hand of the letter itself, and to this it frequently supplements a dot, like its own \\( \\text{i} \\), at the orifice,\\(^3\\) so that it is possible a similar process may have been followed in the present instance, where the dot has grown into a more pronounced downstroke. Otherwise the final may be a sort of com-\n\n\\(^1\\) Gesenius, Scripturae Linguaque Ph\u0153niciae; La Langue Ph\u00e9nicienne, A. C.

This latter might be guessed at indefinitely according to the alphabetical scheme to which it might be proposed to refer it; as Pehlvi it might be \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0634 Shahach\u00b9 or \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0634 Shemach, or taking Nos. 3 and 4 as Arabic \u0639\u0644\u06cc or \u0639\u0644\u06cc. It is true that these may be said to be very impotent conclusions, only that they are not conclusions at all; any such stage of progress is still in the far-off horizon; we are as yet in the merely preliminary initiation phase of the inquiry; and while there is good hope of new materials, it would be vain to multiply mere conjectures. Even as I write, I hear from our associate, Mr. W. Frere, that he has left behind him at Bombay one, if not more, coins of this description, obtained, as we might expect, from the countries bordering on the Indus. Copies of these pieces have been sent for, and I hope, on some future occasion, to renew my examination of this subject with more effect than at present, and likewise to illustrate the alphabetical ramifications by facsimiles, which in this hasty sketch I have been unable to prepare, and without which the most elaborate descriptions are comparatively unintelligible.\n\n\u00b9 These names may have survived in some of the later forms of \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0634 Reinaud, l'Inde, pp. 126, 147, 176. \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0631\u06cc Masaudi, i. p. 372 (title of Kings of Sind) \u0634\u0627\u0647\u0634 Ain-i-Akbari, ii. 146. \"Sehris.\" Elliot's Historians, i. pp. 138, 140, 405, 408, etc. J.R.A.S. xii. 341.\nINDEX.\n\nAcacius, 231.\nAdhir\u0101ja, 84.\n\u0100ditya Dynasty, 96, 101.\nAlayas, 180.\nAlb\u012br\u016bn\u012b, 104.\n\u0100ndhra Dynasty, 122 ff.\nAmyrian Glossary, 1 ff.\n\nBactrian P\u0101li Inscription, 497 ff.\nBaillie, N.
