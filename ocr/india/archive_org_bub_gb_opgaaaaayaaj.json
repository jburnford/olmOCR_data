I have done so, not because this amassing of material for others to work up is the most pleasant or entertaining branch of research, but simply because I am convinced that much pioneer work will have to be done before we obtain really satisfactory results in Malay.\n\nMy object, therefore, has simply been to collect every jot or tittle of information on the subjects written about that an unwearying patience could procure. I have not merely been content to describe the brush used in the tepong tawar ceremonies as made of the leaves of several plants, but I have obtained the names of the plants themselves; I have not been satisfied to describe the offerings to the spirits as consisting of various eatables, but have noted for myself the number and the contents of the dishes. And though I am only too sensible of having come far short of my object, yet at least I have spared no pains to \"ascertain the truth, even in the smallest details.\"\n\nI therefore hope that my labours will be of use to others\nwho working afterwards in the same field, with find their work, I believe, appreciably lightened, and who in revising these notes compiled often under difficulties will be able to correct when necessary and to add to them at their leisure.\n\nThen with the \"northern farmer\" I shall be able to say I have \"stubbed Thornaby waaste.\"\n\nPADI CEREMONIES.\n\nOn the 28th January, 1897, I witnessed the ceremonies attending the reaping of the first ears of padi at Chodoi in the Kwala Langat District of Selangor. I arrived at the house belonging to the Malay owner of the padi field a little past 8 a.m., the hour at which the ceremony was to commence having been fixed at angkat kening. (about 9 a.m.) a few days previously. On my arrival I found the Pawang (an aged Selangor woman) seated in front of the apparatus required for the ceremony. This consisted of three newly-plaited circular baskets diminishing in size from the Pawang's right to her left, (the big basket being supposed to contain seven, the middle-sized five, and the smallest one three, \"gemalan\" of padi). They were each bound round, just under the rim, with the fruiting form of the creeper called \"ribu-ribu,\" freshly gathered that morning. At the Pawang's extreme left stood the circular brass trays with high sides which are called \"Dulang\" by the Malays, the contents of which were as follows:\n\n1. \u2014 A small bowl of parched rice.\n2. \u2014 Saffron rice.\n3. \u2014 Washed rice.\n4. \u2014 Oil of frankincense.\n5. \u2014 Oil of Celebes, (Bugis).\n6. \u2014 Incense.\n7. \u2014 A small bundle of incense (in addition to the bowl).\n8. \u2014 One of the hard jungle-nuts called \"Buah Kras.\"\n9. \u2014 One of the shells called \"Krang.\"\n10. \u2014 An Egg.\n11. \u2014 A stone (a small block of quartz).\n12. \u2014 A large iron nail.\n13 to 15. \u2014 Three Malay reaping-instruments, of which (a) is the penawei solong (lit, eldest rice-cutter), which is only\nto be used when the Pawang has done her work by the owner of the rice field, and the blade of which is fitted into a piece of the wood called pompomg [the reason given being that \"pompomg\" was the wood of which these instruments were originally made] whilst what I may call the handle of the instruments was made of a slip of Bamboo with the hollow filled from end to end with wax. About the other two \"penuweis\" (b) and (c) there was nothing specially remarkable. Close to the Dulang was a coconut shell filled with the \"tepong tawar\" which plays so prominent a part in the more important magic ceremonies of the Malay, the brush consisting of the leaves of seven different plants bound up as usual with a cord of terap bark and ribu-ribu. The plants which furnished the leaves were as follows:\n\n1.\u2014The sapanoh.\n2.\u2014The sapanggil.\n3.\u2014Jenjuang (or lenjuang) merah.\n4.\u2014Gandarusa.\n5.\u2014Pulut-pulut.\n6.\u2014Selaguri.\n7.\u2014Sambau dara.\n\nBut the most interesting object was a small oval-shaped basket about fourteen inches long and similarly bound with \"ribu-ribu\" which was standing just in front of three rice-baskets and close to the pawang, and which was destined (I was told) to be the \"cradle\" of the padi-spirit. I was permitted to examine it and found that at the moment it contained the following objects only:\n\n1.\u2014A strip of white cloth (at the bottom of the cradle).\n2.\u2014A piece of partly coloured thread (benang pancharona).\n3.\u2014An egg.\n4.\u2014One of the hard jungle-nuts (buah kras) already referred to.\n5.\u2014One of the shells called \"krang\"\n6.\u2014A long iron nail.\n7.\u2014Five hasta of red cloth in which the \"cradle\" was to be slung. This latter should in strictness be a cloth of the kind called \"jong sarat,\" I was informed by the Pawang, but the \"kain jong sarat\" being unobtainable, this substitute was\nbeing used. Three new sarongs (one for each basket) were added and everything now being ready, the various receptacles were handed to five female bearers (penjawat) and one male, who descended the house-ladder with the pawang at their head, and set out for the rice-field.\n\nBefore they had gone many yards, they were joined by the owner of the field, who walked in front of them bearing what was called the \"junjongan padi.\" This was a leafy stem of a dark red kind of sugar-cane, but which should, said the Pawang, in strictness have been of the black or \"raven\" variety (tebu gagak). The procession passed on and the Pawang repeated as we went the following prayer to the spirits.\n\nBismillah-harahmanna rahim Assalam aleikum, Nabi Tap yang memegang bumi, Aku tahu asalnia padi. Sri gading, gemala gading yang di-ujong ladang, yang dipangkal ladang, yang terperchig, yang terplanting, yang di-orong* de' semut silambada, Hei Dang Pak, Dang Melini, Dang Selamat menyandang galah Bertapok\u2020 bertimbun dayang kamari selamat rejki di-bri-nia Allah. Dengan berkat, d.s.b.\n\nOn reaching the padi-field the procession filed through a lane already made in the padi, until the sheaf was reached from which the first ears were to be cut. On arriving at the spot, before depositing the rice baskets on the ground, the Pawang repeated the following prayer:\n\n\"Ruwak-ruwak sakandang desa\nBertenggek di-bauran panah\nBerkuak-lah angkau Rengkesa\n'Nak letakkan bakul di atas tanah.\"\n\nOn which the baskets were deposited, and the Pawang took her station in front of the aforesaid sheaf of padi.\n\nCovering her head with a flowing white cloth, of which the ends fell upon her shoulders, the Pawang stood up facing the sheaf, and waved the ends of the cloth thrice upwards towards the right, thrice upwards towards the left, and finally thrice upwards the right again.\u2020 Then she hid her head in the\n\n* di-orong = di-krumun\n\u2020 bertapok = berkampong.\n\n\u2021 Another local way of summoning the spirits is to wave at all four corners of the field, then return to the centre and repeat the following charm:\u2014\nsheaf, and reseating herself, thrice applied the \"tepong tawar\" to the roots of the sheaf. The stem of sugarcane was now inserted in the sheaf and held upright in the centre of the sheaf by one of the female bearers, after which the Pawang, drawing together the ears at the top of the sheaf, before actually planting the sugar cane in the ground repeated the following lines:\n\nKur Semangat, Sri gading, gemala Gading, Batang-kan perak bertuang daun-kan tembaga belepeh, Tangkei-kan amas buah-kan amas ranti-au.\n\nThe Pawang then proceeded to daub the sugarcane stem with the \"tepong tawar,\" and held the sharpened end of it over the incense, saying\n\nAnalam aleikan nabi Tap,\nIni-lah 'ku chachak-kan tebu ini\nAkan sandar-an 'kau\nAku 'nak mengambil semangat 'kau, Sri Gading\nAku 'nak bawa 'ka-rumah, ka-istana-'kau\nKur Semangat! Kur Semangat! Kur Semangat.\n\nThen the Pawang and Penjawat together proceeded to plant the sugarcane in the centre of the sheaf and drawing the waist of the sheaf more tightly round the cane, girdled it by bending it round with some of the outside stems of the sheaf itself; then the Pawang applied the \"tepong tawar\" once more (after incensing it in the usual manner) and ran her hands up the sheaf. Next she took the contents of the brass tray (the stone and the egg, \"kulit krang\" and \"buah kras\") in one hand and with the other planted first the big iron nail and then the other articles in the centre of the sheaf close to the sugar-cane. Next she took the cord of terap bark in her left hand and after incensing it, together with the vessels of rice and oil, strewed the rice all round the sheaf and then tossed the remainder thrice upwards, some of it falling on the rest of the company. This\n\nTepong tawar, tepong jati,\nBarang 'ku chita barang menjadi,\nSahya nama daun-nya\nNor Seni nama buah-nya\nSidang tetap nama angkau\nTetapkan sendi saterang'kan\nJangan 'kau ubah\nDeri pagi sampai petang\nKabul Allah\ndone she took the end of the cord in both hands and encircling the sheaf with it near the ground drew it slowly upwards to the waist of the sheaf and tied it there, first however repeating what are called the \"Ten Prayers\" without once taking breath.\n\nKa-'sa Allah\nKa-dua, Mohamad\nKa-tiga, ayer semba-yang Lima Waktu\nSa-hari sa-malam.\nKa-ampat, Pancha Indra\nKa-lima, Pintu rejki-ku terbuka\nKa-anam, Pangkat mahaligei tujoh pangkat\nKa-tujoh, Pintu Rengkiang terbuka\nKa-'lapan, Pintu Shurga terbuka\nKa-sambilan, anak di-kandong bonda-nia\nKa-sapuloh, anak di-jadikan Allah\nJadi, kerna jadi, jadi kerna Tuban-ku juga\nIsa K\u00e2run\nMusa K\u00e2run\nYusuf K\u00e2run\nDaud K\u00e2run\nK\u00e2run sekalian pintu Rejki-ku, di bumi, di langit, deripada Allah.\n\nDengan berkat la-illah ha-illallah etc.*\n\nThis prayer completed, she dug up a small lump of soil with the great toe of the left foot, and picking it up, deposited it in the centre of the sheaf. Next she took the contents of the cradle (the egg and stone, jungle-nut and shell) and after anointing them with oil and incensing them replaced them; then taking the Penuwei solong (eldest reaping-knife), oiled\n\n* Another local version of the \"doa sapuloh\" runs as follows:\u2014\n\nKa-sa Allah\nKadua-nya Bumi\nKatiga dengan ayer sembayang\nKaampat dengan hari isnayan\nKalima pangkat mahaligei\nKa'nam bintang rezki\nKatujoh pintu shurga\nKa'lapan anak'ku kandongkan\nKasambilan Mohamad jadi\nKasapuloh tenak taman\nDengan Kampong 'laman-ku\nthe blade with the oil of frankincense, and inserting the thumb of the right hand into her mouth pressed it against the roof of the palate, on withdrawing it she proceeded to cut the first seven ears in which the child spirit of the padi is supposed to reside.\n\nDuring the performance of this part of the ceremony (which is called \"cherangkantali trap\") omens are taken as to the prosperity or otherwise of the people of the house, and the observations have therefore to be made with the greatest care. The most disastrous omen is the cawing of a crow; next to this in point of disastrous significance comes the mewing cry of the kite, and thirdly the flight of the ground dove called \"tekukor.\" A good omen is the flight of the bird called the Rice's Husband (Laki Padi), but the best omen is the complete absence of any unusual sight or sound, such as the falling of a tree, the cracking of a branch, or a shout in the distance, all of which are harbingers of misfortune.\n\nTo go back to the cutting of the first seven ears, the Pawang repeated in cutting them the same \"Ten Prayers\" as before. Then she laid them together, kissed them, turned up the whites of her eyes thrice, and thrice contracting the muscles of her throat with a sort of \"click\" swallowed the water in her mouth. Next she drew the small white cloth from the cradle, laid it across her lap and depositing upon it the little bundle of the seven ears anointed them with oil and tied them round with particoloured thread (benang panchawerna), after this she fumigated them with the incense, and strewing rice of each kind over them, wrapped round them the ends of the cloth, and laid the bundle back in the cradle, which was then handed to the first Bearer.\n\nStanding up, she now strewed more rice over the sheaf and tossing some backwards over her head, threw the remainder over the rest of the party, saying \"tabek\" (pardon) as she did so, and exclaiming \"Kur semangat, Kur semangat, Kur semangat\" in a loud voice. Next she pushed the cocoanut shell which had been filled with \"Tepong tawer\" into the middle of the sheaf, and removed all traces of the late isolation of the sheaf (round which a lane had been trodden to make it accessible) by bending back the surrounding ears of rice until they concealed the gap, so that at this spot the rice looked as if it had never been disturbed. Then the first bearer slinging the cradle of the rice-baby about\nher neck in the red cloth before referred to, accepted an umbrella which was offered her by one of the party and opened it to guard the infant, I was told, from the effects of the sun. The Pawang then sat down and repeated a prayer in Arabic, standing up at the end with her hands clasped above her head. This completed the ceremony of removing the rice child, and passing on to another part of the field, the Pawang cut the first seven ears and then handed her basket to another of the female bearers, who in company with two others was told to reap the field in parallel straight lines facing the sun (but on no account to turn their backs to it and let their shadow fall on the baskets) until they had filled the three rice baskets, after which they were to return to the house. Leaving the three reapers each at their allotted task, I followed the Pawang and first bearer (the latter still shielding the Rice child with her umbrella) and was in time to witness the reception of the party as they arrived in front of the house-ladder. Here (on the threshold) they were met by the wife of the house owner, and other women of his family, the former thrice calling out as we approached, \"What news?\" (apa khabar?) and thrice receiving the same reply, \"Baik.\" (It is well.) On receiving this reply for the third time she threw saffron rice over the Pawang and repeated the following lines:\n\nDi-chinchang galenggang batang\nDi-chinchang di-muka pintu\nDi-tentang melenggang-nia datang\nAnak aku rupa-nia itu.\n\nTo which the Pawang immediately replied:\n\nDichinchang rebong lumai-lumai\nBuat penuba batang ari\nSunggoh sahya sebrang sungei\nBesar maksud datang kamari.\n\nAnd the bearer of the Rice-child added:\n\nBukan-nya gantang gantang lada\nGantang berisi hampa padi\nBukannia datang datang sehaja\nBesar maksud kahandak hati.\n\nWe then entered the house, and laid the Rice-child in its \"cradle\" on a new sleeping mat with pillows at the head. About twenty minutes later the three reapers returned bearing their baskets of rice each carefully covered over with a sarong.\nThese baskets were carried into the bed-room, and laid in a row on the mat at the feet of the Rice-child, the largest basket being the nearest to the foot of the cradle, the next largest next and so on, finally the sarongs covering each basket being removed by the Pawang and the reaping-knives (penuwei) stuck in her hair, the entire row of baskets and the Rice-child were covered over with a long white cloth, and the wife of the master of the house was told to observe certain rules of taboo for three days.\n\nI was told by the Pawang that when the three reapers had each filled her basket they had to tie the leaves of three padi clumps together and digging up a lump of earth with the great toe of the left foot, insert it into the midst of each clump and repeat the following charm, as a precaution against the \"Lengk\u00e9sa:\"\u2014\n\nAssalam aleikum nabi Tap, yang memegangkan bumi\nTetap-kan anak aku,\nJangan rosak, jangan binasakan\nTauhkan dicipada jin dan sheitan.\nDengan A-illah d. s. b.*\n\nThe following were the rules of taboo to be observed during the three days.\n\n1. Money, rice, salt, oil, tamarinds, etc., were forbidden to leave the house, though they might enter it without harm being done.\n\n2. Perfect quiet must be observed, as in the case of a new born child.\n\n3. Hair might not be cut.\n\n4. The reapers, up to the end of their reaping, must not allow their shadows to fall on the rice in their baskets (\"menideh bayang\").\n\n5. The light placed near the head of the Rice-child's head must not be allowed to go out at night, nor may the hearth fire be allowed to go out either by night or day, for the\n\n* A similar charm used about here to keep the \"Lengk\u00e9sa\" still (\"tetapkan lengk\u00e9sa\") runs as follows:\u2014\n\n1. Layang rundok layang melansi\n   Sini 'kau dudok, sini 'kau menanti,\n   Bergaruk bumi dengan langit\n   Jangan-kau bergaruk derisini.\nwhole of the three days during which the taboo has to be observed.\n\n6. Whenever the reapers commenced reaping, they were to repeat the charm:\n\nLayang-layang jatoh bertimpa\nTimpa di laman kami,\nBayang-bayang dengan Rengkesa\nJangan berchampor dengan kami.*\n\nA cat having given birth to kittens the night before the ceremony, I was told by the Pawang that it was a very good sign, and that it was a known rule that if there was no human being ready to bear children at the time, \"God substituted a cat.\" (Tuhan Allah mengganti-kan kuching).\n\nPounding the first reaped padi.\n\nI witnessed this ceremony three days later, at about 9 a.m. The baskets filled with the first reappings were removed from the mat on which the rice child lay and their contents emptied out in the front room upon a new mat, (to each corner of which four rice ears were tied) and trodden out (\"di-irek-kan\") by the owner of the field. Then the rice was poured back into two of the baskets and the straw plaited into a wreath. These preparations being completed the two baskets full of padi were carried down the house-ladder and out to an open part of the field a little way from the house and\n\n* The local charms similarly used run as follows:\n\n1. Lengkesa lengkesi\n   'Ku gerek tiga gerek\n   'Ku rajah tiga rajah\n   Aku tilek, hati-mu mati\n   'Kau chapai, tangan 'kau patah\n   'Kau sorakkan, ponggong-mu burok\n   Kalau 'kau sakat sening sri\n   'Kau di-sumpah de'Allah ta'alai\n   Kabul Allah. d. s. b.\n   Lengkesa tengheai\n\n2. Lengksa mari kamari\n   Aku 'nak berjanji dengan 'kau\n   Kalau 'kau datang pada hari ini;\n   Kalau 'kau ta'datang\n   Jangan 'kau datang lagi,\n   Kalau 'kau datang,\n   'Kau di-sumpahkan de'Allah dengan api.\nthere spread upon a mat in the sun to dry. To spread rice so as to cause it to dry properly is not an easy matter; in the present case the operator (who in this case was the owner) stood near the central mat and spread out the grain across the mat in long even courses with a sweeping motion of the hand (\"di-k\u00f6kar di-kachan,\" or \"membalik-kan j\u00e9moran\"). The following objects occupying meanwhile the centre of the mat:\n\n(1) A rattan frill (one of those used for the cooking pots, called \"l\u00e9kar-jantau\").\n\n(2) A bowl of water, laid upon the frill and intended, I was told, for the \"semangat padi\" to quench its thirst, should it feel the effects of the hot sun,\n\n(3) A big iron nail,\n\n(4) One of the nuts called \"buah kras,\"\n\n(5) Ten empty rice ears, a couple of which tied in a slip-knot (simpul pulih) were fastened to each corner of the matting.\n\nSome hours later, when the padi been turned and had thus been sufficiently dried, it was again collected in the baskets, and carried back to the house to be pounded. This part of the ceremony took place the same evening (the sun meanwhile having been very powerful). The padi was pounded and winnowed in the ordinary way, the only noteworthy point being the tying of bunches of the grass called \"sambau dara\" to the upper ends of the long wooden pestles used by the Malays for pounding their rice. Finally the wreath of padi-straw, referred to above, was deposited by the owner of the field in a place where three paths met. Underneath it was a heap of the chaff just obtained by the pounding and on the top of it a big stone which was intended to keep it from being blown away.\n\nThe sugar-cane is left in the midst of the sheaf until the latter is reaped. This is done by the wife of the owner and when it takes place it is pounded in the ordinary way, the grain which results being mixed with that of the seven ears before alluded to, and both deposited in the rice bin (\"kepok\") together with a stove and a piece of rosin (dammar) and a wreath of the rice straw. I may add that I saw the relics of the previous year's charms in the rice bin of the Malay at whose house I witnessed the ceremonies I have just described.\n\nI did not witness the preliminary search for the sheaf in\nwhich the padi-spirit was supposed to reside, but it was described to me by the Pawang and was afterwards reperformed for my benefit by the people of the house. The Pawang's directions were as follows. In order to confine the Rengkesa to the boundaries, visit the four corners of the field and at each corner tie a knot in a padi leaf and repeat in one breath the following charm:\n\nBismillah, d. s. b.\nLayang-layang jatoh bertimpa\nBertimpa di tengah laman\nBayang layang dengan Rengkesa\nTempat Rengkesa di sempadan\nDengan berkat, d. s. b.\n\nThere are several forms of the padi ear within which the \"semangat padi\" may be held to reside, the best being called \"tongkat mandah\"; it consists of an ordinary ear bending over to meet the tip of a second (adventitious) spike of padi which is occasionally produced from its own stalk by a freak of nature. The next best is called \"putri bertudong\" (the veiled Princess); in this case the sheathing of the ear is of unusual length and bows down over the ear itself. A third kind is called \"padi bertelkum\"; which is said to be the female padi (\"padi betina\"); this variety also has an unusually well developed sheath. A fourth kind is the \"padi menhara,\" which appears from the description given to be a rice plant whose leaves show white lines or markings.\n\nWhenever the women go out to reap they should repeat a certain charm before depositing their baskets on the ground *, so also on leaving the house to start the reaping.\u2020\n\nTheir heads should be covered, and they should always be careful to reap, as has already been noticed, facing the sun, to prevent their shadow from falling upon the rice in the basket at\n\n* Ruak-ruak sakandang desa\nBertinggek di bauran panat\nBerkuak-lah angkan Rengkesa\n' Nak letakkan bakul diatas tanah.\n\n\u2020 Layang layang jatoh bertimpa\nTimpa di laman kami\nBayang bayang dengan Rengkesa\nJangan berchampor dengan kami\ntheir side; occasionally, however, the body is uncovered, and I was told of one Inche Fatimah, of Jugra, who when reaping stripped herself bare, with the exception of a sarong which reached to her waist, and when asked why she did it said it was to make the rice husks thinner, as she was tired of pounding thick husked rice.\n\nSowing the Seed.\n\nThis was a ceremony which, of course, at the time I could not witness. It was described by the Pawang as follows:\u2014\n\nA sort of square hearth of timber (\"galang dapor\") is made in the centre of the field, and the following trees planted one at corner:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014A young banana (of the variety called \"pinang\")\n2.\u2014A clump of serei (lemon grass.)\n3.\u2014A single stem of the sugar-cane called \"tebu lanjong\"\n4.\u2014A plant of saffron (turmeric).\n\nIn the centre of the hearth a cocoanut shell filled with water is deposited with great care, and next morning the auspices are taken; it being considered a bad sign if either the timbers of the hearth have been moved however slightly out of position, or if the water in the cocoanut has been spilt, and a good sign if both are found exactly as they were placed or if an insect such as an ant is found in the water. If the omens are good, the first seven holes for the seed are made with the dibble, the Pawang reciting the following charm:\u2014\n\nBismillah d. s. b.\nAssalam aleikum nabi Tap yang memegang bumi\nAku menumpangkan anakku Sri gading gemala gading\nDidalam anam bulan akan katujoh\nAku datang mengambil balik\nDengan laillah\nKur Semangat, Kur Semangat, Kur Semangat\n\nMalays, however, appear unable to describe such ceremonies adequately, and I hope on a future occasion to be able to take down the full details which can only be obtained by an eye witness.\n\nI may add that the ceremony used at planting out the young padi is described by Mr. Blagden in No. 29 of the Society's Journal, to which the reader may refer.\nExplanation of the Ceremony\n\nAny one who knows Mr Frazer's \"Golden Bough,\" will find in it ample proofs, if indeed it were not already sufficiently obvious, that such padi-ceremonies as those I have described are part and parcel of an old-world religion.\n\nThe majority of the details can be explained by a reference to the principles of sympathetic magic, one of which is \"that any effect can be produced by imitating it\" (vide \"The Golden Bough,\" Vol. I., p. 9). Thus the central idea of these padi-ceremonies appears to be that the padi may be induced to bear, by pretending that it has borne a child. In this case the sheaf is the mother, (indeed it is called the Rice-Mother, ibu padi) and the first seven ears are unmistakeably meant to represent her child. That is why it is swathed in the cloth, and laid it in the basket-cradle, together with appropriate charms to guard it from evil influences, kissed, protected from the sun by an umbrella, carried home and laid upon the sleeping mat with pillows and a sheet; that is why the lamp must be kept burning near it at night, and why it must not be disturbed by noise in the house. Lastly, that is why it is actually called a child in the incantations which are used. Surely nothing can be plainer than this; and if a parallel is wanted, there is our own corn-baby, which is the name given to the spirit of the corn when similarly treated in the north of England.\n\nThere is, however, a difficulty when we have got so far; is it the actual child of the padi itself that the Pawang and Bearers think they are carrying home? The use of the word semangat seems to preclude this; and in fact suggests that it may after all be the soul of the child which is supposed to be removed by the Pawang. Thus when she waves the white (soul) cloth, it is undoubtedly to attract the spirit of the Rice-child that she does so, and it must be remembered that the old-world idea of the soul (an idea which is still spread widely among uneducated and uncivilised communities), is that it is a sort of puppet or mannikin exactly resembling in every respect the body which encases it. Then again, the soul is supposed to be able to soar like a bird, and that is why the Pawang in invoking it, uses the word \"Kur,\" which is the word used in calling fowls together. However, it is perhaps a matter of no great moment whether the\nrice-child is conceived of as a child, or as this mannikin-soul (in the shape of a child) and it is probable that few if any of the devotees of the padi-spirit could themselves draw a distinction between the two conceptions.\n\nOn the other hand, the sugar-cane stem is undoubtedly, like our own May-branch or May-pole, a sign of fertility; the iron nail represents iron which is a charm against evil spirits; when the Pawang turns up the whites of her eyes it is to affect, by sympathy, the cleaning and whitening of the rice; the click, or contraction of the throat before swallowing, is intended by similar means to make the rice eat well and slowly. Thus again, when the Fatimah stripped herself to reap, she no doubt was thoroughly convinced that by doing so she would make the rice-husks thinner, and so be able, to save herself trouble in pounding the rice. Similarly the birth of the kittens was supposed not merely to portend, but actually to play its part in bringing about the birth of the rice-spirit, so as to give it a prosperous conclusion. In this way the greater part of these ceremonies can be interpreted and rendered intelligible to many who, not possessing the key to their mysteries, are too easily inclined to regard these old-world customs as mere childish folly, entirely devoid of any real significance, instead of appreciating them at their true value.\n\nTHE TIGER SPIRIT.\n\nIn the latter part of 1896 at Jugra, in Selangor, I witnessed, by appointment, the ceremony of invoking the Tiger Spirit for the benefit of a sick man named Brahim.\n\nPunctually at the hour appointed (7 p.m.) I reached the house, where I was received by my Malay friend and ascending the house-ladder, found myself comfortably seated on a mat in front of the very spot where the medicine man was expected to perform the intended ceremony.\n\nOn entering I found some nine persons present, including the nearest relatives of the sick man, and I was told that although it is not necessary for the same persons to be present on each of the three nights during which the ceremony lasts, the greatest care must be taken that the number present on the first night must not be varied.\nOn my right was the patient's bed with patchwork curtains, and in front of me were three jars arranged in a row and a sort of vase containing a nosegay of artificial flowers and ornaments consisting of coco-nut fronds roughly plaited so as to resemble ground doves, centipedes, rings, and the like. Each jar was filled with water and had a collar of plaited coco-nut fronds and a caladium leaf laid upon its mouth, and in front of the jars was a censer with burning embers ready for use and (as a matter of course), a box containing the requisite apparatus for the chewing of betel leaf.\n\nEverything being thus in order, the medicine man appeared, and took his seat in front of the censer, his wife, who was to perform the part of orchestra (bidu) taking her seat at the same time. Sitting at the further end of the row of jars, with a large tambourine in her lap, she presently struck up the lagu Pemanggil which was to summon the spirit whose aid was invited, and which ran as follows:\n\nLagu Pemanggil.\n\n1.\u2014Endah-nia bukan alang kapalang\n2.\u2014Lanchang Penglima Lenggang Laut\n3.\u2014Lanchang berturap ayer amas\n4.\u2014Lanchang bersudu linggam gading\n5.\u2014Lanchang bernama Lanchang Kuning\n6.\u2014Tamb\u00e9rangnia bernama perak beleleh\n7.\u2014Tiang bernama Raja Mendela.\n8.\u2014Kamudi-nia bernama lebah Bergantong\n9.\u2014Landan-nia bernama Sawa Mengampei\n10.\u2014Dayong-nia bernama Jari Lipan.\n11.\u2014Anak dayong dua kali tujoh\n12.\u2014Ula-ula menumbok kurong\n13.\u2014Pemepah bernama Bermain angin\n14.\u2014Gada gada kibat-kibat\n15.\u2014Juru-mudi putar lah Kamudi\n16.\u2014Jerbatu bongkar-lah suah\n17.\u2014Juru tinggi juak-lah layer\n18.\u2014Anak dayong paut-lah dayong\n19.\u2014Lanchang bertumpu pusat tasek\n20.\u2014Mana lanchang beridar ada\n21.\u2014Mengedar ka-laut Paub Janggi\n24.\u2014Jangar-lah l\u00e9ka jangan-lah lalei.\n25.\u2014Baik-lah lekas Penglima Lenggang Laut\n22.\u2014Main ombak main glombang\n23.\u2014Main glombang meniti riak\n24.\u2014Jangan-lah l\u00e9ka, jangan-lah lalei\n25.\u2014Baik-lah lekas Panglima Lenggang Laut\n26.\u2014Jangan lengah di telok suak rantau\n27.\u2014Turun-lah mendapatkan'kau jinjangan\n28.\u2014Tatang puan tatang cherana\n22.\u2014Datang bidok pagi hari\n30.\u2014Datang-lah Tuan datang-lah niawa\n31.\u2014Memanggil tuan datang kemari\n32.\u2014Tatang puan tatang cherana\n33.\u2014Tatang dengan kait padi-nia\n34.\u2014Datang tuan datang-lah niawa\n35.\u2014Datang dengan baik hati-nia\n36.\u2014Tatang puan tatang cherana\n37.\u2014Tatang dengan batang sa-tawer\n38.\u2014Datang-lah tuan datang-lah niawa\n39.\u2014Datang dengan ubat penawar\n   (panggil yang di-gunong)\n40.\u2014Tatang puan tatang cherana\n41.\u2014Tatang dengan kait padi-nia\n42.\u2014Datang-lah tuan datang-lah niawa\n43.\u2014Datang dengan baik hati-nia\n44.\u2014Tatang puan tatang cherana\n45.\u2014Tatang dengan lembah pakienia\n46.\u2014Datang-lah tuan datang-lah niawa\n47.\u2014Datang dengan sembah laku-nia\n48.\u2014Telipok bunga telipai\n49.\u2014Bunga kantan kembang dahulu\n50.\u2014Bangang bertipok membuang limbei\n51.\u2014Anak jantan sehaja bagitu (bangkit menari)\n52.\u2014Mari-lah Inche, mari-lah tuan\n53.\u2014Jangan leka jangan lalei\n54.\u2014Turun meniti tali Bayu\n55.\u2014Jangan leka di-gundek chandek\n56.\u2014Jangan leka di-amba sahya\n57.\u2014Mari-lah kuda Lengkong pulau (rimau blang merah)\n58.\u2014Mari-lah kuda nibong bangus\n59.\u2014Marilah menjilet mana manya yang sakit (rimau itam)\n60.\u2014Sa\u2019ekor nama-nia Lang jengkat\n61.\u2014Sa\u2019ekor nama-nia Raja Jin Peria.\n\nWhich I would attempt to translate as follows:\n\n1.\u2014Of no ordinary beauty\n2.\u2014Is the ship of Penglima Laut,\n3.\u2014The ship that is plated with gold,\n4.\u2014Inlaid with vermilion and ivory\n5.\u2014The ship that is known as the Yellow Ship,\n6.\u2014Whose stays are quilted with silver,\n7.\u2014Whose mast is named \u201cRaja Mendelu\u201d\n8.\u2014Whose rudder is named \u201cThe Hanging Bees' Nest.\u201d\n9.\u2014Whose stern and prow are called \u201cThe Struggling Pythons,\u201d\n10.\u2014Whose oars are named \u201cThe Centipede\u2019s Feet.\u201d\n11.\u2014Twice seven are her oarsmen in number.\n12.\u2014Her pennant flaps against the deck-house.\n13.\u2014Her streamers disport in the breeze,\n14.\u2014And her flags are waving gaily.\n15.\u2014O Master of the Helm, turn thou her rudder.\n16.\u2014Master of the anchor, heave up her anchor.\n17.\u2014Master of the foretop, shake out her sails.\n18.\u2014Oarsmen, press to the oars.\n19.\u2014Our ship\u2019s foot rests upon the heart of the seas.\n20.\u2014What point has she reached in her whirling course?\n21.\u2014She is whirled towards the sea where the Pauh Janggi grows.\n22.\u2014She sports with the waves;

Ula-Ula: do not, as one might be tempted to do at first sight, read ular-ular. The words are no doubt radically connected, but are quite distinct, there being no \"r\" in ula-ula, which word, I believe, has not yet been given in dictionaries.\n\n17. Juak: lit. to hold out at arms' length by stretching out the arms; hence to spread, to shake out the sails.\n\n19.

Janggi is the Malay corruption of Zanggi, Ethiopian or \"Black,\" a word which appears in such compounds as Zanzibar, lit. the country of the Blacks.\n\nPauh literally means mango, but according to Yule \"Pauh janggi\" the Black or African mango, is the name of the \"coco-de-mer\" (double-cocoonut) the produce of the Lodoicea Sechellarum, which grows only in the Seychelles, but whose fruit is cast up generally on the Maldive islands, but also occasionally on Ceylon and S. India, the coasts of Zanzibar, Sumatra and others of the Malay islands. Great virtues as medicine and antidote were supposed to reside in these fruits, and extravagant prices were paid for them. The old belief was that the fruit was produced on a palm growing below the sea, whose fronds, according to Malay seamen were sometimes seen in quiet bights on the Sumatran coast especially in the Lampong Bay.\n\n26. Jinjagan is the temporary dwelling place or residence of the spirit invoked, i.e. the Pawang's body.\n\n30.

Nibong Hangus, a coal-black leopard.\nwards learnt was the spirit language (Bhasa Hantu) that he was \"going to lie down\" (which he accordingly did, lying down on his back and drawing his sarong over his head, till the latter was completely shrouded from sight): the invocation meanwhile continuing we sat for some minutes in the rapt silence of expectation, till at length with a suddenness, which in itself was startling, the moment of \"possession\" arrived, and the Pawang with a violent kick rolled flat over on to his face. A brief interval ensued, and a second but less violently demonstrative spasm was followed by a dry and ghostly cough and a moment later the Pawang with head still shrouded, suddenly sat bolt upright facing the solitary figure of the tambourine player. After a brief suspense, he fronted round to the three jars and removed the caladium leaves which served as lids. He then took a taper and having kindled it at a lamp which was standing just behind the jars, planted it firmly on the rim of the first jar (counting from the right) which he had previously prepared by spilling upon it a little wax from the flaring taper. Similar tapers were planted on the rims of the second and third jars respectively, and after an interval he partook of betel leaf, which was formally presented to him by one of the women present, and which he ate in a leisurely fashion crooning all the while to himself. This refreshment concluded, the Pawang took from his girdle one of a couple of charm-stones (batu penawar) which he carried with him, and proceeded to rub them over the patient's neck and shoulders.\n\nHaving completed this part of his task, he again faced about with the suddenness that characterized all his proceedings and put on a new white jacket, and a head cloth, both of which had been placed ready for his use; then from its scabbard, and girding up his sarong at the waist, he drew a richly wrought knife, proceeded to hold it over the censer and then returned it to its scabbard. He next took three silver 20 cent pieces (called batu buyong or jar-stones) and after charming them dropped one into each of the three jars in turn. Having done so took a long inspection of each, shading his eyes with his hand from the light of the burning tapers. He now charmed several handfuls of rice, viz., parched rice, washed rice, and rice coloured with saffron respectively, and after a further inspection declared with a strange squeaky voice in the spirit language that the coins were lying\nexactly under their respective tapers; that it was an ominous portent, and that his son (meaning the sick man) was very dangerously ill but that with the spirit's aid there was yet some slight chance of recovery. Next scattering the rice round all the jars, he broke off several flower stalks from the fragrant spike of a blossom of the areca palm and the odorous champaka, and inserting these improvised nosegays in each jar, laid at full length behind the jars a piece of white cloth (five hasta in length) which he had just perfumed with smoke from the censer.\n\nThe more stirring part of the ceremony was now to come. Drawing his knife the Pawang plunged its point into each of the three nosegays just described, and then seizing a fresh and unopened sheath of areca palm blossom, rubbed it all over with Bugis oil and extracting the blossom spike perfumed it with incense and laid it gently across the patient's breast. Working himself up to a state of intense but repressed excitement, and with the most determined gestures, he now proceeded to stroke the patient with the blossom-spike downwards to the feet, on reaching which he dashed the end of the spike on the floor and shook it out with great vehemence, the undeveloped flower-buds falling like rain. Turning the patient over on to his face he now once more stroked him down to the feet and finally having beaten out the blossom on the floor he returned exhausted to his seat and lay down once more upon his face, covered himself as completely with his sarong as before. A long interval of waiting now ensued, until, after several premonitory convulsions of the body, the tiger spirit took possession of the Pawang. Starting up\u2014this time on hands and feet\u2014and with a low but thrilling growl, he began scratching furiously with his nails at the mat on which he had been lying and then set greedily to work to lick up several handfuls of rice (gandom, corn, as it is called in the spirit language) which was scattered on the floor in front of him, and all the while he growled and leapt from spot to spot at brief intervals. But a yet more remarkable portion of the ceremony was to follow. The Pawang leaning over the patient's all but naked body slowly but unflinchingly licked it down from head to foot with his tongue exactly as a tigress might lick down her cub; a performance of so revolting and powerfully nauseous a character that it is difficult to conceive that any living human being could persist in it with-\nout some considerable degree of mental exaltation which renders him at least to some extent unconscious of his actions.\n\nThis truly remarkable performance being over the Pawang returned to a sitting posture (though still with covered head) and let blood from his arm with the point of the kris so that it fell over the prostrate form of the patient.\n\n[I may add that after the conclusion of the ceremony and after his return to consciousness, the Pawang suffered severely from nausea.] He now rose to his feet and engaged in an imaginary but fierce combat with the spirit whom he had been called to exorcise, performing the necessary evolutions first with the kris and then with the spike of areca blossom. Then once more he began to stroke the sick man down with the blossom spike from head to foot, and beat the ground where he was standing with the end of the spike at the conclusion of the operation.\n\nHe now sat down, again crooning to himself, and partook of betel leaf: then facing round to the patient and muttering over him, he shampooed him all over with his hands and turning round to the jars again once more transfixed the spikes of blossom in the jars, in which the spirit was now supposed to be lurking, with the point of his kris. Finally he drew his head-cloth over his head so as to cover his face and sat rocking himself from time to time over the patient\u2019s body: then crooning, suddenly he clapped his hands and removed the head-cloth, stroked down the patient and flicked him with the corners of it, and lying down again at full length enveloped in his sarong in the course of about ten minutes, with numerous convulsive twitchings, he returned to consciousness, and sat up, and the mony was entirely at an end.\n\nThe following words of the spirit language were subsequently gathered from the Pawang.\n\n| English   | Malay    | Spirit language | Remarks |\n|-----------|----------|-----------------|---------|\n| bird      | burong   | simbangan       |         |\n| betel leaf| sirih    | merak b\u2019layang  |         |\n| candle    | lilin    | talong          |         |\n| child     | anak     | demit           | N.

Sakelula is explained as the mast of these steamers (tiang panji-panji).\n\n2.\u2014Pinang gumba; explained as Pinang Bali, which is a talisman against the Hantu Pemburu (wild Huntsman); dolum labu means in the body (of the spirits).\n\n3.\u2014Bersudara; explained by Pawang as (1) Pak si Kemang, i.e. the Hantu Pemburu (wild Huntsman) himself. (2).\u2014Mak si Kemang, his wife; (3) Kemang ampai, his eldest son; and (4) Tambin Ijok, his youngest son.\n\n---\n\nCrocodile charms.\n\nA fowl is killed and split open, a cross stick of nibong (which is intended to stick in the Crocodile's throat, and to which is attached a rattan line of great length, is inserted, and the whole bound up again and laid upon a pair of trestles which are inserted in a small floating platform moored to a stake by the bank. During this process the following charm is addressed to si Jambu Rakai, the tutelary genius of Crocodiles.\n\nHei si Jambu Rakai, sambut pekiriman\nPutri Rundok di gunong Ledang (Mt. Ophir)\nAmbachang masak sabiji bulat,*  \nPenyikat tujoh penyikat  \nPengarang tujoh pengarang,  \nDi-orak di-kumbang jangan (= to undo)  \nLulor lalu di-telan  \nKalau tidak 'kau sambut  \nDua hari, jangan katiga,  \nMati mampek, mati mawai (= mati bongkang)  \nMati tersadai pengkalan tambang (= teodampar)  \nKalau 'kau sambut  \nDua hari jangan katiga  \nKadarat 'kau dapat makan,  \nKalaut 'kau dapat minum,\n\nThen holding the rattan line referred to, repeat the following Relumpoh (charm to disable an opponent);\n\nAku tahu asal-kau jadi  \nTanah liat asal-kau jadi  \nTulang buku tebu asal-kau jadi \u2020  \nDarah-kau gula, dada-kau upih,  \nGigi-kau tunjang berembang  \nRidip-kau chuchan atap.\n\nHere blow upon the end of the line, and draw it thrice backwards; and thrice knock it against the bows of your boat.\n\nWhile you are planting the stake, to which the floating platform is moored, the following charm should be repeated:\n\nAsalam aleikum Nabi Allah Tap, yang memagang bumi,  \nNabi khalir yang memengang ayer  \nNabi setia yang memagang langit  \nNabi Elias yang memagang kayu,  \nNabi Nor yang tanam kayu,  \nAku 'nak buat tumpat meletakkan pekiriman kepada hulu-balang di-rantau (= busia).\n\n* Ambachang, etc. This refers to the fowl, which should be tied seven times lengthways, and seven times across, and which the crocodile is bidden to swallow whole (lulor, etc.).\n\n\u2020 This of course (and the following lines) refer to the story that the first crocodile was a lifeless plaything of Fatimah, the daughter of the prophet, who made its bones of sugarcane joints, its flesh of clay, its blood of cane juice, its belly of areca nut sheath, its teeth of the sharp pointed shoots of the berembang, and the ridge of its back from the eaves of thatch.\nAssalam aleikum mambang tali harus yang dudok di tali harus\nAssalam aleikum Jin Itam, yang dudok permata\u2019an telok\nAssalam aleikum Jin Puteh, yang dudok di-ujong tanjong,\nJanganlah angkau ber-kachau-kachau.\n\nThe next day, and until the bait is taken, the Pawang goes to look at the fowl. The very next morning, perhaps, he finds it gone, and at low tide he makes search up and down the river until he sees the end of the long rattan line sticking up somewhere among the mangrove roots. This he hauls in, hand over hand, until the crocodile which swallowed the fowl appears on the scene, when he dispatches the brute as best he may. If the crocodile, we are told, shows a disposition to fight the repetition of the following charm will be found efficacious.\n\nPasu jantang, pasu renchana\nTutop pasu, penolak pasu,\nKau mementang kepada aku, terjantang mata-kau,\nJantong kau sudah \u2018ku gantong\nHati-kau sudah \u2018ku rantei\nSi Pulut namanya usar,\nBerdeilah daun salasih,\nAku tutop hati yang besar\nAku gantong lidah yang fasik\nJantong-kau sudah ku gantong\nHati-kau sudah ku rantei\nRantei Allah, rantei Mohamad\nRantei Baginda Rasulallah.\n\nLanchang charms.\n\nThe most complete, and at the same time most beautiful, description of the Lanchang that is known to me is the one in the invocation addressed to the Tiger spirit already given. A brief-er Lanchang charm runs as follows:\n\nHei Datoh ka-sang jambu agai;*\nTrimakan ini menganter-kan katelok\nSi (Anu) yang membrikan\nSerkong\u2020 (Si Rekong) namanya telok\nSerkong (? Si Reking) namanya tanjong\nSi Abas anak tokong pulau\nMinta lansongkan pesembahan ini kamambang tali harus.\n\n* This title is evidently corrupt: but is evidently the same as the title of the crocodile spirit\u2014\"Jambu Rakai.\"\n\u2020 It is explained that Serkong is the father\u2014(Spirit), Serking the mother, and Abas the child.\n\nWater-Spirit Charms.\n\nThe following is a first rate specimen of a general invocation of the Hantu Laut.\n\nHei loh mambang Putih, loh mambang itam\nYang diam di-bulan dan matahari\nMelempahkan sekelian 'alam asal-nia pawang,\nMenyampeikan sekelian hajat-ku,\nMelakukan segala kahandak-ku,\nAssalam aleikum!

Then he lighted a taper and removing a caladium leaf from the mouth of a jar containing \"holy\" water (ayer sumbahyang) gazed into the jar and then extinguished the taper. He then held his hands in the attitude of prayer first over the censer, and then over the \"holy\" water and taking the censer in both hands, made three circles with it round about the jar, and then setting it down again, stirred the water thrice with a small knife which he kept in the water whilst muttering the charm. He now charmed the betel-stand in the same way, and then the first dish of cooked food, pushing the latter aside and covering it with a dish cover when he had finished charming it.\n\nNext he was offered two pieces of yellow cloth (yellow being the royal colour in Selangor) five hasta in length in all, together with a small vessel containing \"Bugis\" oil, with which he anointed the palms of both hands before handling the cloth. He now proceeded to wave the cloth in the smoke of the censer, one end being grasped in the right hand, and the remainder passed round the right wrist, and over and under the right arm, and the loose end trailing across his lap. Having repeated a charm, the Pawang, now breathed upon the end of the cloth in order to charm it; then ran the whole of the cloth through his hands and fumigated it with the incense; then laying it aside, he took an egg from a tray which was held out to him and deposited the egg in the exact centre of a large bowl filled with parched rice. Once more putting aside the jar of \"holy\" water he let the tray down about a foot and a half by means of its cord, and allowed an assistant to affix to the tray a fringe or frilling made of strips\nof cocoanut leaves called \"centipede-legs\" (jari lipan). The Pawang who was standing close by then helped to arrange three banana leaves as a lining inside the tray; after which he made three circles round the tray with the censer and then set the latter down exactly in the centre underneath the tray, then he once more anointed his hands, and passed them completely over both tray and fringe. A short pause ensued, and the Pawang took the longer piece of yellow cloth and wrapped it, like a royal robe, round the shoulders of the patient, who was sitting up inside his mosquito curtain. This done he returned to his former occupations, and standing up and facing the north with the bowl of parched rice (already referred to) (which he has first however scooped up with his hands and passed through his fingers) poured the contents of the bowl slowly into the tray and then planted the egg (already referred to) in the very centre of the layer of parched rice in the tray. This done he took a bunch of bananas which was offered him by one of those present, and cutting them off one by one laid them in a dish, only to re-empty it a moment later, and deposit the bananas one by one in the tray.\n\nHe now returned to the patient and kneeling down in front of him, and holding his hands over the smoking censer, muttered an invocation, and then wrapping the shorter piece of the yellow cloth round his own head, slowly but steadily pushed the patient (still in a sitting posture and wrapped in the yellow robe) forwards until he was seated exactly underneath the centre of the tray facing the east, with the long fringe drooping about him on every side like a curtain and hiding his face almost entirely from the spectators (with the exception of his feet which were stretched out at full length in front of him.)\n\nThe censer voluming upwards its silver-grey smoke was at the same time lifted and the Pawang having made three more circles with it round the patient, finally set it down at his feet. The loading of the tray now recommenced, the Pawang facing the south deposited the first instalment of cooked offerings (consisting of five portions made up from various parts of a fowl) one in each corner of the tray and one in the middle; then after washing his hands, he added five portions of parched rice, washed rice and rice of various colours, viz., green, red, blue, black, and saffron (so as to make seven kinds of rice\nin all); then five portions made up from the remainder of the fowl already mentioned (raw however, this time,) and then (after a further washing of the hands) five more portions of cakes.\n\nFinally (after a last washing) he tied to each of the four cords which are attached to the four corners of the tray a series of small ornamental rice receptacles manufactured from woven strips of cocoanut fronds, these receptacles depending from the strings to which they were tied in much the same manner as the presents from our own Christmas Tree. There were twenty-eight of these receptacles fourteen of a square shape, which are called Katupat and fourteen of a long shape called lepat, each set of fourteen comprising seven sorts of cooked and seven sorts of uncooked food. But food is by no means the only sort of creature comforts provided for the spirits; four small buckets manufactured from strips of banana leaves and skewered at the ends with bamboo pins, were filled and deposited in each corner, with sugar cane-juice, whilst a similar receptacle in the centre was filled with the blood of the fowl.\n\nThe necessity of lighting the spirits to their food is not overlooked, and five waxen tapers were charmed and lighted and planted one in each corner and one in the centre of the tray.\n\nFinally five \"chews\" of betel-leaf, and five cigarettes (these latter rolled in short strips of banana leaf, charmed and lighted at a lamp) and five stones (these should have been dollar-pieces but the Pawang accepted 50 cent-pieces on account of the comparative poverty of the patient) were added to the contents of the tray, which was thus at last complete. Everything being ready, the Pawang walked thrice round the tray (the patient remaining seated underneath it) bearing the censer and having thrice more handed the censer round it from his right to his left hand, and standing with his face to the East, (looking in the same direction as the patient) grasped with both hands the cords of the tray at the point where they converged, and thrice muttering to himself gave a violent tug downwards at the end of each repetition.\n\nWhen this was over, he took off the yellow cloth which as formerly observed, was bound round his head, and fastened it round the point already mentioned where the strings con-\nverged, and then grasping this cloth \"waved\" the offering by swinging the tray slowly to and fro over the patient's head.\n\nHe now lowered the tray and detaching it from the cord by which it was suspended waved it seven times, and held it in front of the patient, who spits into it.\n\nNothing now remained for him to do but to sally forth, carrying the tray with its lighted tapers into the blackness of the night, and gaining the shelter of the nearest jungle, to suspend the tray from a tree which had been selected for the purpose during the day (in the present case the tree was a specimen of the *Pteri belalang*). The ceremony was now at an end, and a white ant which settled upon some of the offerings was hailed as a sign that the spirits had accepted the offering.\n\nI may add that the ceremony commenced at about 8 p.m. and lasted a full hour and a half, and that fourteen people were present, seven males and seven females, which was the exact number prescribed by the Pawang.\n\nThe following were the charms used by this Pawang\n\n(1). *Menjapai ayer*, the water charm, which ran as follows:\u2014\n\nAssalam Aleikum sekalian Jin Islam\nAleikum Selam ka-depan\nMenyahut sekalien Malaikat\nMinta' piara anak chuchu Adam\nNabi Khailir yang memegang ayer ini\nJalan yang kabaikan\nYang mengubahkan Mohamad * ini\nMengilangkan penyakit dalam badan si Anu\nDengan berkat laillah hailallah, etc\n\n(2). When filling the tray he repeats the following words:\u2014\n\nTa'siku tita\nIndai siku dindai\nAku tahu assi kau jadi\nDeripada kepala ribut yang besar\n\n* This of course is the name given by the Pawang to himself. So if the Pawang is a woman she calls herself Fatimah, (doubtless after the daughter of the prophet).*\nJaub-lah angkau, niah-lah angkau\nBukannya do'a sabarang do'a\nDo'a Baginda Ali\nAyer ta' meleleh jadi meleleh\nRanting patah menjadi ta' patah\nDengan berkat etc \u2020\n\n(3). The charm for the three kinds of rice was as follows:\u2014\nBismilah harahman narahim\nKidu-kidu rambang\nRambang siang rambang malam,\nMata bagei bintang timor\nTulang bagei tulang bumbong\nSarang 'lang tanah ipoh\nTanah ipoh tada bisa,\nMasok tawar kluar-lah bisa!\nTawar Allah, etc.\nBukannya aku yang punya tawar\nDo'a Baginda ali yang punya tawar.\n\n(4). Note on tepong tawar:\u2014\nThe use of the tepong tawar is not as might be supposed merely emblematic of purification; it is used for augury; the point being that if it runs down it forebodes disaster, as it is then emblematic of tears, whereas if it spreads like a blot, equally in all directions, it augurs good luck. It may be sprinkled anywhere, on house pillars at building, on the tajok of a malay prahu and on fishing stakes, puchi kalong; in the case of a human being it is sprinkled on the forehead and the backs of both hands.\n\nIt appears that the composition of the spoon or rather brush (with which it is sprinkled), differs according to the ceremony which has to be performed. Thus for a wedding it would be composed as follows:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Daun sapenoh\n2.\u2014Daun sapanggil\n3.\u2014Sambau dara\n\n\u2020 Note. I can make nothing whatever of the first two lines, which are evidently not Malay: the pawang however gave me the sense of them as \"arang kecil biar jauh orang besar dekat kamar\". Ranting is used figuratively for uret (sinew or muscle-of the patient). Ayer is most likely similarly used for his blood.\n4.\u2014Selaguri\n5.\u2014Pulut\nBound up with a strip of terap bark.\n\nAnd again for the padi ceremony it would be:\n1.\u2014Daun sapanoh\n2.\u2014Daun sapanggil\n3.\u2014Pulut-pulut\n4.\u2014Lenjuang merah\n5.\u2014Selaguri\n6.\u2014Gandarusa\n7.\u2014Sambau dara\nBound up with ribu-ribu, and terap\n\nAnd for the ceremony at a fishing station:\n1.\u2014Daun sapanoh\n2.\u2014Daun lenjuang merah\n3.\u2014Gandarusa\n4.\u2014Daun satawar\n5.\u2014Daun sadingin\n6.\u2014Daun bakau\nBound up with ribu-ribu.\n\nThe daun sapanoh is a broad round leaf which is to enwrap the rest. It is described as 'alamat orang menanti.'\n\nSambau dara is a fairly common grass and goes in the middle of the bunch. It is said to be \"alamat menetapkan semangat.\" Selaguri is described as a pok' asal, as is pulut pulut; and so is used as a reminder \"peringatan asal.\" Lenjuang merah is an 'alamat kubor,' (and so no doubt also intended as a peringatan); but it has further use, as it scares away evil spirits, for which purpose it is sometimes planted at the four corners of the house. Gandarusa is also used to keep the powers of darkness at bay; for which reason people who have to go out when the rain is falling and sun shining at one and the same time (a period when the spirits who cause sickness are considered to be especially prevalent), put a sprig of it in their belts.\n\nThe following are specimens of charms recited in connection with tepong tawar.\n\n(a) Tepong tawar, tepong jati,\nKatija dengan tepong kadangsa,\nJika bulih kakandak hati,\nJangan sakit jangan mati,\nJangan chachat, jangan binasa\n\n(b) Another one runs as follows:\u2014\nTepong tawar tepong jati,\nKatiga dengan tepong kadangsa,\nNaik-lah mas ber-kati-kati\nNaik-lah orang beribu laksa.\n\n(c) And a third as follows.\u2014\nTepong tawar, tepong jati\nTepong tawar sa-mula jadi,\nBarang-ku chinta aku perulih\nBarang-ku pinta semuania dapat.\n\n(d) And a fourth:\u2014\nTepong tawar tepong jati\nKerapak tumboh dibatu\nAllah menawar Mohamad berjampi,\nGunong runtoh ka-ri'a aku\nBukannya aku yang punya tepong tawar\nToh Sheikh Putih gigi yang punya tawar\nBukan-nya aku yang punya tawar\nDatoh La'ailbau yang punya tawar\nBukannya aku yang punya tepong tawar\nDatoh Betala Guru yang punya tepong tawar\nKabul Allah, etc.\n\nSacrifice at Fishing Stakes.\n\nMenyemak or Mencherak Kelong.\n\nEarly in January, 1897, I witnessed this ceremony at Ayer Itam in the District of Kuala Langat, Selangor. The officiating Pawang was an old Malay, named Bilal Ummat, who had long been the possessor of fishing-stakes in the same neighbourhood and had been accustomed to perform the ceremony annually for very many years past. I and my little party arrived in the course of the morning and were conducted by the Bilal to the building in which he and his men resided during the fishing season. Here we found, as we had expected, a feast in\ncourse of preparation, but what most drew the attention were three large sacrificial trays, which had been prepared for the reception of the destined offerings by being lined with fresh banana leaves, but which were otherwise absolutely empty, the offerings themselves being displayed on a raised platform in front of them. Shortly after our arrival the ceremony of filling these trays commenced. First, the Pawang took a large bowl of parched rice and poured it into each tray until there was a layer of the rice about an inch deep in each tray. Then he took rice stained with saffron and deposited about a hand-ful of it in the centre and four corners of each tray and then made exactly similar deposits of washed rice; next he deposited in the same way small portions of the sweet potato; the yam and the tapioca plant, banana and sirih (there being two sets of these five portions, a set of five cooked and another of five uncooked offerings) and finally one cigarette to each portion. Next the head of a black goat (without blemish and without spot) which had been killed that morning before our arrival was deposited in the centre of the middle tray, and at the same time two of the feet were deposited in each of the side trays. To each portion were now added parts of the liver, lights, tripe and other \"purtenances\" of the victim, together with seven katupats and seven tepats (each including a set of seven cooked and seven uncooked), five of the seven being suspended from the four strings which starting from each corner of the tray united in a point about a foot and a half above it and the other two in each case being deposited in the tray below. Five receptacles, made of banana leaves skewered with bamboo pins were now filled with arrack and deposited in each tray: the only exception being that the receptacle deposited in the centre of the central tray was filled with which the blood of the goat had been killed. A taper was now added to each portion, lighted, and the trays were complete.\n\nEvery thing being now ready, Bilal Umma carrying a lighted censer, walked thrice round the three trays towards the left; then, the five tapers of the left-hand tray having been lighted and two of his men having been told off to carry the tray slung on a pole, we set off in a small procession along the sandy beach, and coming to a halt from fifty to sixty yards further on, saw the Bilal suspend the tray from the branch of a mangrove\ntree. The tray having been suspended he faced the land and breaking off and throwing down a mangrove branch, gave utterance to three land cooees, which, as he afterwards informed me, were intended to apprise the Land spirits (orang darat) of the offerings which awaited their acceptance. Returning to the house he improvised a sort of rude paint brush by tying up with the creeper called ribun-ribu (the female not the male variety) leaves of the following plants or trees (1) daun sapenoh (2) lenjuang (also called janjuang or senjuang which has been identified with ?t. John) merah (3) gandarusa (4) satawar (5) sadingin (6) (7) mangrove (bakau).\n\nNot long after this we started for the Stakes, taking with us the remaining trays, the first of which was suspended by the Bilal from a high wooden tripod which had been erected for the purpose upon the sandbank, and the last, which contained the goat, was taken on to the Stakes. Before we reached our destination, however, the Bilal had disposed of a large quantity of offerings of all sorts which he had brought with him in a basket, now scattered upon the face of the waters. The following is an accurate list of the things so distributed as I was able to make.\n\n(1).\u2014A portion of parched rice\n(2).\u2014Sweet potatoes\n(3).\u2014Two bananas boiled\n(4).\u2014Two lepats\n(5).\u2014Three boiled bananas\n(6).\u2014Two katupats\n(7).\u2014Three yams\n(8).\u2014A portion of parched rice\n(9).\u2014Three short sticks of tapioca\n(10).\u2014Three sweet potatoes\n(11).\u2014Four sweet potatoes\n(12).\u2014A portion of raw liver\n(13).\u2014A portion of cooked meat\n(14).\u2014Four sweet potatoes\n(15).\u2014Three boiled bananas\n(16).\u2014Three katupats\n(17).\u2014Three green bananas\n(18).\u2014Six katupats (in 2 sets of 3)\n(19).\u2014Six green bananas (ditto)\n(20).\u2014Three sweet potatoes\n(21).\u2014Three yams\n(22).\u2014Six lepat\n(23).\u2014Two lepats\n(24).\u2014Five katupat\n(25).\u2014Two yams\n(26).\u2014Two sweet potatoes\n(27).\u2014One boiled banana\n(28).\u2014Three handfuls of white pulut rice\n(29).\u2014Three handfuls of parched rice.\n\nOn reaching the stakes, the tray was suspended from the left \"tide-brace\" at the end of the stakes fronting the sea, and the Pawang sat down just below looking towards it. He then proceeded to scatter saffron rice and cigarettes all about the left and right \"tide-braces\" close to the two central uprights (Kayu puchi) in the front of the stakes and then emptied out the remainder of the contents of the vessel containing parched rice just inside the head of the stakes. He next recited a charm, whilst stirring the bowl of magic flour (tepong tawer) with the leaf-brush already described, and when this was over daubed the heads first of the left and then of the right \"tide-braces\" and the heads of two uprights next to them (bang puchi,) after which he handed the brush to two of his following who completed the work in turn by daubing the heads of all the remaining uprights in the seaward compartment of the stakes including the heads of the gate posts, and then daubing the entire gear of the boat, starting from the left side of the bows and working down to the stern and then returning and working down again on the right, after which they returned to the stakes and washed the rice bowl underneath the place where the Pawang sat and finally fastened up the brush to the left hand Kayu puchi.\n\nKelong Charms.\n\nHere is a set of Kelong ceremonies, as described by a Pawang. Take bras bertih, bras basoh, and bras kuniet and scatter them in three handfuls on the water towards evening.\n\n\"Inilah bras sagengam bunyi\nTanda kita bersudara!\"\n\nThen return to the house, and on retiring to rest repeat the\nnames of the water-spirits seven times. If you are fortunate, one will appear in a dream. And in the morning do likewise until seven days are past; and then erect the first stake. And while planting the first stake (turus tua) scatter the rice as aforesaid and call upon the spirits as follows:\n\nHei sudara-ku, Uri, tembuni, bali tentoban angkau 'yang tua\nAku minta tengo tempat aku 'nak chachah blat\nAmpang aku ta'tahu, tegar s'apa aku ta'tahu,\nHang yang tahu\nInilah bras sagenggam bunyi, d. s. b.\n\nWhen the last stake is planted, stand at the seaward end and say.\n\nHel sudara aku, Uri, tembuni, bali tentoban\nAngkau yang tua, aku yang muda\nKampong-lah sekalian permainan angkau\nBawa kamari kapada tempat ini yang aku membuat\nInilah bras, d. s. b.\n\nHere is another kelong charm; to be recited whilst holding the turus tua, but before thrusting it home:\n\nPawang kisa, pawang berima\nSilang Juna Raja di-laut\nAi durai Sibiti (? Si Biti) nama Mak-kau\nSi Tanjong nama Bapah-kau\n'Kau yang memegang ujung tanjong\n'Kau yang memegang seklian tepi pantei\n'Kau yang memegang beting alang\nMak-kau buboh di puchi tua\nBupah-kau di pemingkul blah barat\nAnak-kau di-buboh di-ujong penajor\nAi mambang segara, 'kau dua beradek,\nHertiga kita bersudara,\nKalau ia kita bersudara,\n'Kau tolong bantu, aku [here thrust the stake into the ground]\nKaki-ku berpijak di-dulang kasa (?

Never bathe without a cloth. Never rub one foot against the other (gosok satu kaki dengan lain).\n2. To preserve sexual continence for seven days,\n3. Sarongs, umbrellas, shoes, and head-cloths must never be used on the kelong.\n\nPetua Kelong.\nIf the response of the water spirits to the prayers of their suppliants is favourable, the first pole (turus tua) will enter the ground readily as if pulled from below.\n\nBhasa Pantang.\nThere is nothing remarkable about this Bhasa pantang.\nikan, fish = sampah or daun kayu\nular, = akar hidup\nbuaya, = batang (kayu)\nbunohan (kelong) = kurong, of which there are several varieties e. g. kurong muka, kurong kelangking, kurong tengah and kurong laut.\nThe ceremony is called menjamah or mencherak kelong.\nThe following is a \"jermal\" charm.\nAssalam aleikum Pawang tua, P. pertama,\nAllah Musa kalam Allah,\nSedang Bima, Sedang Buana,\nSedang Tuara Raja Laut\nMari-lah kita bersama-sama\nBerchachak tiang jermal ini.\n\nAnd the following is used in fishing with a line;\nA chew of betel (sirih sakapor); having been previously\n\n* i.e., Lokman-ul Hakim.\nacrestted on the water the Pawang says:\u2014\n\nHei mambang Tali harus\nJangan 'kau imbang-imbang kail-ku ini\nKalau kail-ku di-kiri, angkau di-kanan,\nKalau kail-ku di-kanan angkau di-kiri\nKalau 'kau hampiri kail-ku ini.\n'Kau kasumpah-i dengan Allah Ta'ala\n\nA more common one, however, is a jingle addressed apparently to the fish themselves.\n\nSambut tali perambut\nBiar putus jangan rabut\nKalau rabut mata 'kau chabut\nAyer pasang bawa' ka'-ensang,\nAyer surat bawa 'ka'-prut.\nFOLK-LORE AND THE MENANGKABAU CODE IN THE NEGRI SEMBILAN.\n\nBy A. HALE, DISTRICT OFFICER, TAMPII.\n\nThe Negri Sembilan, unlike the other Protected States of the Malay Peninsula, has not yet quite got away from the traditions which prevailed amongst the Aboriginal tribes; these traditions were partly adopted and somewhat modified by the colonists from other States of the Peninsula and from Sumatra; who, as the Resident, the Hon. Martin Lister, has pointed out in a paper communicated to the Society in 1887, \"fell in with the Aboriginal views, and observed their rights to all waste lands, and their power in each State\" but at the same time \"brought their tribal laws with them.\"\n\nIt is well known that the primitive Malays of Sumatra practised exogamy, and\u2014like all other exogametic races inter-tribal marriage was one of the most heavily punished offences.\n\nWhen I went to the District of Kinta, Perak, in 1884, and was engaged in settling native Malay claims to mining lands, it puzzled me at first to understand the term \"Waris Kinta,\" which was often quoted by native mine owners, and when I was transferred to an appointment in the Negri Sembilan, I remember that the late Sir Frederick Weld told me that one of the chief reasons why he had selected me, was, because there were few men in the service who could distinguish between a Waris and a Lembaga. I am afraid I looked confused, and I know that as soon as I got back to my Hotel, I looked in my \"Swettenham\" and found that the word Lembaga meant somebody who had something to do in the affairs of the State. I had not lived long in Tampin, and mixed in Rembow and Gemencheh affairs before the distinction was made quite clear to me.\nIn 1890 Mr. Lister communicated a further paper to the Society, enlarging on the subject, shewing how the Sakais were merged in the Bidwandas, and how the constitution was established on Menangkabau lines.\n\nMy purpose in the present instance is to try and trace through the Folk-lore of the country, the why and wherefore of certain customs, which, always stronger than written laws, have made the country what it is, a very favorite resting place for Malays, because of the conservation of such customs; in doing this, I shall endeavour to explain, as far as I am able, a few old fashioned sayings, which are even now less quoted than they used to be a few years ago.\n\nTengku Sayid Abdullah bin Sayid Saban, the Assistant Magistrate of Tampin, has greatly assisted me in the work, by explaining what seemed to me obscure in some of the sayings: the words and diction used being in many instances more or less obsolete, and also likely to bear a double meaning.\n\nI have romanised each saying and made a very free translation; in the latter, so far as I know how, giving what the native Malay understands to be meant; this seemed preferable to a more literal rendering as that would not so easily convey the meaning.\n\nThe sayings are more or less arranged in progressive sequence, as they seemed to suit the case as it occurred in the Negri Sembilan; first inhabited by Sakais, then gradually colonized by Malays, who, as they increased, amalgamated their own customs with those of the Aborigines, and ultimately brought their Settlement to the dignity of a State, with a Raja chief, whose principal duty was to administer the Mohammadan laws, but with due regard to the Ancient Customs, many of which are very opposite to what is understood by the Law of the Prophet.\n\nI have used the collective name Sakai here, as the Malays commonly do, to express all the different sections of the Aboriginal tribes, whether true Sakais, Jakuns, Mantras, Semangs or any others.\n\nThe State of Rembow is particularly interesting at the present time, being in a transitory stage as to customary laws. The people are of course professed Mohammadans, but they are at the same time ashamed to abandon the old fashioned customs of the \"Ada Perpatih.\" The incongruity of this was pointed\nout to them by the late Sultan of Johor, when for a short time Rembow came under his influence, about eighteen years ago; from what I have heard he most likely laughed at their customs, and advised them that the only way for professed Mohammadans was to follow the \"Adat Tomonggong,\" in other words the law of the Prophet. Since that time Rembow customs have greatly changed, and in such matters as debt quarrels, a man may act for his wife instead of her own relations, the law inheritance also follows the code of Islam, so that a man's children may inherit his property instead of his wife's relations.\n\nIn spite, however, of these decided advances made by the clever Rembow people they are still behind in some of matters; for instance, the law of marriage is still the law exogamy as in force amongst savages; as the people say it is not lawful to marry within one p\u00e9rut, or sa waris, that is within the limits of a well defined group of families whose common descent is more or less clear from one ancestress who was probably an immigrant from Sumatra several hundred years ago; this is very different from the Mohammadan law on the subject, where the table of affinity is even less comprehensive that it is under Christian rule.\n\nAnother Rembow custom, which I expect is almost peculiar to it as a Mohammadan country, is, that a man may not have more than one wife at the same time, except by special authority of the Penghulu; I cannot find out when this custom arose, nor can I find any special saying connected with it; the people can only remember that it always prevailed in Rembow, in accordance with a vow made by a tribal chief in Menangkabau before he and his people migrated to Rembow. At any rate the idea has taken such strong hold of the people, that although when the late Sultan of Johor came to Rembow, as before stated, he ridiculed the custom as opposed to the teaching of Islamism, the people still hold by what has been handed down to them by their ancestors, and I understand that even to-day there are only three men in Rembow with more than one wife.\nAyer sa'gantang sa'lobok,\nSa'dangkang yang ber-bunyi'\nSiamang ber-jawat-jawat,\nTompak ungka ber-dayu-dayu;\nBatin yang ampunya-nya.\n\nFrom every pool a gallon of water,\nThe frogs that croak;\nThe gibbons that travel from hill to hill\nAnd the places of their noisy councils,\nAll these belong to the Sakai chief.\n\nThe Sakai who first enunciated the theory contained in this description of his rights must have been far advanced in the imaginative power so well displayed in the story of Sri Rama, told by Mir Hasan and published by Mr. Maxwell in the Journal of the Society: or perhaps it was a Malay who made it up with the intention of putting on record that after all the Sakaies could only claim a little water in the recesses of the jungle where unclean beasts dwell.\n\nThe Sakais of today seem to wish for very little else, and all efforts to civilize them are unsuccessful; they are the least harmful of all savage races and are bound to retire before civilization, even if only the civilization of Malays, luckily there is still plenty of room for them in the forests of the Peninsula.\nRECORDS OF MALAY MAGIC.\n\n2\n\nSal-silah ka-hutan,\nTromba ka-loak.\n\nThe Genealogies belong to the Sakais\nBut the written account of them to the Malays.\n\nThis is a very curious expression, Sal-silah is distinctly Arabic, and one is forced to imagine that Malays taught by Arab traders in the olden times invented the saying by way of flattering the Sakais.\n\nThe tradition is that the \"Undang yang ampat\" i.e. the four principal Lawgivers or Penghulus of the Negri Sembilan, are descendants of a Malay chief who settled on the Moar river and married one or more Sakai princesses, and by that means came into the possession of a good slice of the Peninsula, including the present Negri Sembilan, Sungei Ujong, Klang, parts of Pahang, Nanning, Moar, and Jelebu. The Penghulus of Johol and Ulu Moar are the only two left of the \"Undang yang ampat\" whose jurisdiction still to some extent follows the ancient customs; when new Penghulus of Johol and Ulu Moar are appointed, the Batins or Sakai chiefs have a strong voice in the matter, as they are supposed to be the people who know most about the legitimate descent; reciprocally the Penghulus confirm newly appointed Batins.\n\n3\n\nGaung guntong, bukit bakau,\nWaris dan Penghulu yang ampunya-nya.\n\nThe stream heads and narrow valleys,\nThe hills and the surrounding plains\nAre the property of the chief and people of the Waris tribe. (i.e. Bidwanda).\nThe claim here set forth by the first settlers in the original Sakai country embraces the whole countryside, to the effectual exclusion of the Sakais, who themselves tacitly acquiesce in it, by gradually retiring to the more remote jungle-covered hills without any protest.\n\nThe Waris tribe were the first-comers, followers of a chief, who followed their chief's example and intermarried with the Sakai race; therefore as the land belonged originally to their Sakai wives, the custom is still in force in the Negri Sembilan, that all ancestral land shall be held by the women.\n\nThe census taken in 1891 showed that the Malay population in Rembau was much more dense than in any other of the protected Native States, and that it was the only State in which the native women outnumbered the native men; in Rembau not one per cent of the native customary holdings are registered as the property of men. I believe the same thing obtains in Nanning of Malacca, where the customs are very similar.\n\nThe Johol chief, Dato Johol Johan Pahlawan Lela Perkasa Setia Wan, is to this day, although a man, to some degree looked upon as a woman, and in consequence except to pay homage to his suzerain he is not supposed to leave his house for any purpose of administering justice or attending ceremonies. Of the Undang yang ampat who first administered the Negri Sembilan, one of them, the youngest, was a woman, who settled in Johol. As a further mark of his feminine attributes he always wears his hair long.\n\nAlthough the Sakais have given up the land to the Malays, they still, as shown under No. 2, retain the right\u2014or the semblance of it\u2014of appointing the Undang or Penghulu; themselves being in turn confirmed by the Penghulu when appointed as Batins by their people.\nTaki Kayu Batin Jenang\nPutus tobus kapada Undang\nJengka ber-\u00e7lak\nLantak per-tukul\nAmas ber-tahil.\n\nThe trees are blazed by the Batin and the Senang.\nBut the price is paid to the Penghulu.\nThe land is measured,\nThe boundary posts are planted,\nThe gold is weighed out.\n\nIt is to be understood that the Batin is the purely Sakai chief, the Undang or Penghulu the purely Malay chief, the Jenang is the Penghulu's officer, appointed by him as his Departmental chief for Sakai affairs; it is his duty to kva the Sakais for any important matter, to act as intermediary and conduct all negotiations between the two races. This saying describes the system of the alienation of the land from the Sakais to the Malays of the Waris or Bidwanda tribe; and the subsequent selling of blocks by the Waris to the different tribes. The saying by itself does not very clearly express all that, but in practice it soon becomes evident; the first two lines describing how the land was acquired by the first Malay settlers from the Sakais,\u2014with whom they were very closely connected by marriages between Mohammadan Malay men and Sakai women\u2014I do not suppose the reverse ever occurred, or if it did it was very rare; it has now become merely a legend, as the Malays of the Waris tribe now claim the right to all waste lands, which claim the Sakais tacitly admit. It seems very evident, why, although the land was sold by the Sakais to the Malays, the Malay chief received\npayment; he was of high descent on the mother's side and the Sakaijes therefore trusted him to look after their interests in the alienation of the lands; although he actually received payment, it was as much for the benefit of the Sakais as of himself.\n\nIn the same way, the three lines following describe how in most of the States the different tribes have their allotted portions of the waste lands, within which they should as much as possible arrange holdings for their respective tribes-women; but this has also been a good deal ignored and the tribes' holdings have got mixed up: what has, however, survived of all this is the custom, of the Lembagas of both tribes being present when land is transferred from one tribe or section of a tribe to another, and this custom, which is rigorously insisted upon under the present rule, has proved most useful: no registration of any land dealings being effected unless the custom has been satisfactorily fulfilled and attested by the respective tribal chiefs.\n\n5\n\n\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0627 \u0627\u06a9\u0627\u0631 \u0641\u0648\u062a\u0648\u0633\n\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u06cc\u0646\u06af\u06a9\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0627\u0646\u0627\u0647 \u062a\u0631-\u0628\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u06a9\n\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0627 \u0628\u0627\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06af \u06a9\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u0631\u0628\u0647\n\u0633\u0647\u06cc\u0627 \u06cc\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0627-\u0646\u06cc\u0627.\n\nSa halei akar putus\nSa bingkah tanah ter-balik\nSa batang kayu rebah\nSahya yang ampunya-nya.\n\nA trail of liana was broken,\nA sod was turned over,\nA tree was cut down,\nIt was I who made the clearing.\n\nThe speaker, who in support of his claim recites this \"perbilongan,\" or saying, seeks to prove that he was the first to open a certain district; he would probably be a man with some followers, who, for a reason had migrated from the settled lands to find a fresh place and cut out for himself a new clearing in the primeval forest.\nThe land is God's, the Raja administers it for the benefit of the community; the man who squats on it has only the right to his usufruct, and if he does not make it produce he has no good claim to hold it. In a disputed claim, it is evident that he who can prove himself to be the first who brought the land into cultivation has the best title to it; therefore if he can prove that he felled the first tree of the clearing, cut the first rattan or creeper to tie a fence, and turned the first sod to plant it, his contention is a strong one.\n\n6\n\nPinang nen gaya\nNior yang saka\nJirat yang panjang\nNinek moyang saliya yang ter-muka'an (punya buka'an).\n\nThe areca and coconut palms are so tall that they are blown about by the winds;\nThe line of graves is lengthened out:\nIt was my fore-fathers who planted them all.\n\nThis saying is also recited in claiming land in dispute; but in a different sense to that of the last, which is urged in support of a claim to a district, as having been the first settler. In this case the claimant seeks to prove that the holding is ancestral property and bases his claim upon work done and evidence left by his progenitors.\n\nIn land disputes I have always found it most useful to prove who planted cocoanut trees, and who were actually buried in the grave-yard which is found at the back of nearly all old holdings.\nSa lilit Pulan Pricha (Percha.)\nSa limbong tanah Malayu,\nBer-raja ka-Johor;\nBer-tali ka-Siak;\nBer-tuan ka-Menangkabau.\n\nThe Malays of all countries acknowledge the Yam Tuan of Parga Ruyong in Menangkabau as their suzerain, but that they have a Raja in Johor and that they are dependent on Siak.\n\nAlthough the saying interps that all Malays acknowledge the above, it no doubt originated from the Negri Sembilan and refers to that State alone. The \"Undang yang ampat\" or four Penghulus of the original Negri Sembilan, finding that they required a Sultan to administer the Government, especially the religious law; first sent to Johor, from whence they were passed on to Menangkabau by the way of Siak. The story of the adventures and ultimate success of the embassy has already been told by other writers both Malay and European.\n\nHulu ayer merinching. Kwala ombak memecha;\nRaja dan Penghulu yang ampunya-nya,\nSawah yang berjenjang, pinang yang ber-jijik.\nLembaga yang ampunya-nya.\nFrom the source where the waters trickle down,\nTo the mouth where the waves break,\nThe Raja and Penghulu shall govern the land.\nBut where the padi fields are laid out,\nAnd the areca nut palms are planted in rows,\nThe Lembaga shall rule his tribe.\n\nThe Bidwanda tribe, who glory in their descent from the Sakaies, provide the Penghulu, they are the tribes of the soil, and from them other immigrant tribes may purchase the right to use the land for their sustenance.\n\nIn the Negri Sembilan it was the Bidwanda Penghulu and this mixed Malay and Sakai people, who, being converted to Islamism, required a Sultan as the Mohammadan law-giver and sent an Embassy to Menangkabau to procure one. Then the Sultan and the Penghulu together governed the country, the Sultan doing his best to carry out the law of the Prophet\u2014Hukum Sharak\u2014and the Penghulus, whilst acknowledging that law and bowing to it, maintaining the Aboriginal cult by the encouragement of Fetishism, through the Pawangs, and the customs of the tribes\u2014Hukum Adat\u2014who had come to their state, by allowing the Lembagas to act as petty magistrates, and give decisions in accordance; which more often than not, especially on such questions as marriage inheritance, and the settlement of debt disputes, are not at all on the same level as the Mohammadan law.\n\n9\n\n Alam ber-Raja, negri ber-Penghulu,\n Suku ber-Tua, Anak-buah ber-Ibu-bapa,\n Orang sa-manda ber-tompat sa-manda,\n Dagang ber-tapatan, prahu ber-tambatan.\nStates have their Rajas,\nAnd Provinces their Penghulus,\nEach tribe its Lembaga\nAnd each family its elder.\nEvery married man has his wife's\nRelations to assist him to his rights,\nAnd strangers go to the chief whose duty\nIt is to attend their affairs;\nAs also theirs is a place to tie up their prahus.\n\nThus is defined, in reverse order, the right of Appeal and the Immigration Department.\n\nA well ordered State under the Menangkabau code\u2014Adat Perpateh\u2014should be provided with a properly defined wharf, where there are berths for vessels of different nations. There should be a proper Minister to look after foreigners; he may be called Dato' Dagang, or there may be four office holders, called Dato' Dagang-yang ber-ampat abbreviated to 'To Ampat.\n\nThe Court of first instance for a married man is the family of his wife; he having left his own home and gone to live with his wife, whose mother he accepts in the place of his own; in other words, he is of one mother (Sa-manda) with his wife after he has married. If a man does not obtain satisfaction from his wife's relations, he as, well as all other unmarried people and married women, take their complaints to the elder of their own particular section (perut) of their own tride, to the Ibu-bapa (literally mother-father) corrupted to Bwapa; from thence the appeal is to the Lembaga (called Tua or old man) of the whole tribe or Suku; the next court is that of the Penghulu or Undang; and the last appeal is to the Raja of the State, called in accordance with old custom Yang-di-per-Tuan, which title has been shortened to Yam-Tuan.\n\n10\n\nLembaga ber-sekat,\nUndang ber-ka-lantasan.\nThe Lembagas jurisdiction is confined to his tribe, (ting-kongan.)\n\nBut the Undang may carry the case on, i.e. to the Raja or last appeal; or he may hear it in conjunction with the other Penghulus of the State first.\n\nThus is defined their respective jurisdiction.\n\nA most important detail in the old administration of the Negri Sembilan, and probably of all Malay States, was the higher consideration shewn to the Waris tribe or Bidwandas, than to the other tribes or Sukus; I found evidence of this in Perak ten years ago, \"Waris Kinta\" and \"Waris Bukit Gantang\" meant much amongst the natives, although little was left of the Waris supremacy in the administration of the State.\n\nThe incidence of the Penal laws weighed much heavier on the tribes or sukus than on the heirs of the soil; and although, as has occurred in some instances, important and energetic persons from other tribes and even Arabs, have succeeded in obtaining Peughuluships, as a heritage for their tribes; it has, I think, invariably been the custom that they should marry a Bidwanda woman.\n\nChari, bagi\nDapatan, tingal;\nBawa Kembalik.\n\nJoint earnings shall be divided.\nThe wife's (ancestral) property shall restored to her tribe.\nAnd the husband's taken back to his.\n\nThis is custom which governs the division of the property of married people when a divorce occurs, or at the death of\neither party. It is the whole law of Malay entail and marriage settlements in a nut-shell.\n\nWhen a marriage is arranged, it is the duty of the elders of the two tribes to see that the real and personal estate of both sides to the contract, is carefully enumerated before witnesses; then at the dissolution of the marriage, the elders should arrange that the joint earnings during the married life of the parties are equally divided; that the wife's representatives get back what she brought into the contract and the husband his share. It may be imagined that as no written record is kept, the account becomes somewhat confused and quarrels ensue.\n\n12\n\nKusut menyilisikan,\nUtong membiar, pintong menerimaan,\nOleh tonpat samanda.\n\nTo arrange all quarrels,\nPay all debts and receive what is due,\nIs the business of the wife's relations.\n\nThe married man, as shewn in this and the next saying, would seem to be rather at a disadvantage; he is merely a man married into the family all his quarrels and debts have to be settled by his wife's relatives, and all debts due to him are collected by them. This seems after all pretty fair under the Menangkabau code, which, in exchange for the actual labour done in the rice fields by the women, exalts them to the position of actual owners of the usufruct of their holdings under the Raja as paramount lord.\nOrang sa manda ber-tompat sa-manda:\nIika cherdek teman be-eunding,\nIika bodok di suroh dia arah;\nTinggi baneh tompat ber-lindong.\nRimbun down tompat ber-na\u2019ung.\n\nThe married man shall be subservient to his mother-in-law:\nIf he is clever I will try to cajole him,\nIf he is stupid I will see that he works;\nLike the buttresses of a big tree he shall shelter me.\nLike the thick foliage he shall shade me.\n\nOne can imagine the satisfaction a Malay mother derives from thinking over this saying, and reciting it to her cronies and her daughter when she has made up her mind to receive a son-in-law into her family; be he sharp or slow, clever or stupid, either way the cannot be a loser. Her daughter\u2019s house will be built behind her own; if the man is clever he will get enough money to build the house by easy means; if he is stupid she will so bully him that the poor man will be glad to labour with his hands at her bidding; it would seem to the anxious mother that she and her daughter cannot but be gainers by the contract; perhaps they forget for the time that there is another side to the question, namely that they may have to pay his gambling debts.\nDarah Sa-titik, daging sa-rachik Ber-tali Kapada bapa.\nFor a drop of blood, and morsel of flesh, one is still indebted to one's father.\n\nThis is equal to saying, that, although the women are the most important members of the community as holders of the entailed property, one is still indebted to one's father for mere existence; the axiom is a little plea for the mere man, after all the tendency that has been shewn by the Adat Perpatih to glorify the woman by making her the nominal owner of the soil.\n\nIt is not however surprising that the woman should have a large share of importance in the tribe, as every body who has read or heard related the old tradition of \"Dato' Per-pateh pin-nag sa-batang\" will understand. Perhaps after all it was not the heroism displayed by a particular woman under trying circumstances, that decided the ancient chief to fix the land of entail in the female him of descent; so much as it was the difficulty in determining in lawless times the paternity of any given child, the maternity would be easier to decide.\n\nHilang darah, ganti darah.\nBlood for blood.\n\nThis on the face of it, is evidently the old Mosaic law\u2014\"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth\"; but primitive Malays were not so wasteful of blood and life as to exact capital punishment except in very flagrant cases.\n\nThe expression is explained by numbers 16 and 17 following.\nChinchang pampas, bunoh halas.\nFor a wound the price of it in blood,\nFor a murder a life.\n\nThe blood to be spilt in compensation for a wound inflicted,\nmight be that of a fowl, a goat or a buffalo, according to the\nmore or less serious nature of it; also according to the means\nof the culprit and the power of the offended party to exact pay-\nment; in any case the animal or some part of it would go to\nprovide a feast of reconciliation.\n\nThe life to be paid for a murder rarely meant amongst\nMalays that the murderer was necessarily executed; it was\nmore often the adoption by the family of the murdered person\nof a member of the murderer's family, or it was a slave passed\nover by them in compensation for the loss incurred. As I have\nalready pointed out the compensation to the Waris or Bid-\nwanda tribe was heavier than that paid for the death of a mem-\nber of what may be termed a tribe of immigrants. When I\nfirst came to Rembau some very old debts were sued for in my\nCourt, in the hopes that the white man would be strong enough\nto exact payment where the native chief had failed; on investi-\ngation some of these proved to be judgements inflicted for\nassaults and even murder or man slaughter.\n\nIn Rembau for the death of a Bidwanda, or Waris the\nlife penalty was exacted; but for the death of a tribesman the\npenalty was a buffalo, 50 gantongs of rice and \"wang dua\nbhara\" (i.e. \u00a728-40): the money to be divided amongst the\nrelatives of the murdered man, and the buffalo and rice to pro-\nvide a feast to reconcile the tribes of the murderer and his\nvictim.\nAnak di-panggil makan, Anak-buah di sorongkan balas.\n\nThe son is called to the feast, But the nephew pays the debt.\n\nThis explains more fully how the debt of a life for a life is paid.\n\nThe Menangkabau code as understood here provides for succession first in the tribe and next in the family; it would seem absurd to a primitive people;\u2014Amongst whom sexual relations were not properly governed by even the laxly carried out Mohamadan laws of marriage and divorce,\u2014that property, which amongst all savage races is more valuable than life, should descend from father to son, when no man could with certainty claim an individual as his offspring; it was, evident that the landed property should be held by the women who, being proud of the ownerships, would not hesitate to expend labour on it: it therefore comes about that when a man of one tribe marries a woman of another, he becomes a sort of lodger in his wife's house, her family and her tribe; the children that his wife may bear to him are not so much his children as the children of his wife's tribe; they way inherit, as explained under No. 11., whatever he and his wife earned together during their married life; but his wife's tribe have too strong a claim on them, to allow them to be taken from the tribe in payment for a crime committed by their father, who is an outsider; if he murders a man he must find a relation of his own blood and tribe to pay the debt; and as when he dies his nephew will inherit his personal estate and any office or title which he may hold in the tribe, it seemed proper that his nephew should pay his blood debt.\nTali pengikat deripada lembaga,\nKris penyalang deripada undang,\nPedang permanchong deripada ka'adilan.\n\nThe Lembaga shall bind the culprit,\nThe Penghulu shall kris him,\nThe Sultan only may behead him.\n\nIt is the duty of the tribal chief\u2014after he has done everything he can to protect his tribesman from the consequences of his guilt,\u2014to bring him before the tribunal, and if the death sentence is passed, to bind him; although in Sarawak and other Malay countries I understand that when a man is krissed he is not bound. The Undang is a less powerful person than the Sultan, therefore if he passes a death sentence the execution is carried out with the kris most carefully, in order that not a drop of blood may be spilt on the ground, which would be against the popular traditions. The Sultan, on the other hand is not subject to these niceties and therefore is empowered to behead with the sword.\nThe Game of Chap-Ji-Ki.\n\nIntroduction.\n\nA few words on the peculiar form of gambling propensity called the game of Chap-Ji-Ki, or the Chap-Ji-Ki, before it passes away out of men's mind and becomes one of the dead ghosts of a forgotten past, may not be out of place or devoid of interest even to the general public. The game owed its success and long immunity from punishment to the originality and organising powers of its promoters. It broke up in 1896 when the Government began to hustle and harry the gamesters in real earnest. The Chinese ladies of Singapore found then they could not give their little private card parties in safety yet few women gambled more fiercely or played for higher stakes than these Chinese whilst the fever lasted. Any one who has read of the universal high playing amongst English ladies at Vaux Hall in the days of the restoration of Charles II. will have some faint idea of how passionately absorbed the Chinese women of Singapore were in this new form of gambling. In the hope that a wider knowledge of this game may be generally useful and of special service to others, this little sketch is drawn up.\n\nGambling is perhaps the commonest form of amusement known to the Chinese. Its speculative character, its prospects of loss or profit, appeal irresistibly to his genius. Out-door sports have little attraction for him. A mild kick at the flying shuttle cock, a languid dallying with a struggling kite is quite enough for him; when heavy physical exertion is indulged in, be sure there is some utilitarian object in view\u2014a prize in the gymnastic ring or perhaps honours in the military school. From the Chinese point of view, as with us, gambling (whether it be in the form of cards, dominoes, fan-tan, or dice) is per se no vice. It is only the abuse and misuse of gambling that, to a Chinese mind, constitutes an offence. One's length of days here, is to his mind, but a long game where the cards are always changing. Gambling seems to clear his mind and brace his nerves. It is training ground to him for the real gamble of\nlife. In these sunny Settlements in the Straits of Malacca serious gambling seems to come and go by fits and starts\u2014to break in waves from time to time over the surface of Chinese life, carrying trouble and distress with it amongst many peaceful families.\n\nSingapore has been lately visited by one of these periodical gambling epidemics.\n\nSince 1893 there has grown up amongst some of the China-born and amongst all the Straits-born Hokkien and Teo-Chin well-to-do and middle class families in Singapore, a new form of gambling commonly called the Chap ji-ki lottery. In a word, this lottery is won by guessing rightly one out of twelve cards selected from a pack of ordinary Chinese playing cards.\n\nThis new form of lottery has within the space of the last twelve months become immensely popular amongst Chinese ladies in Singapore, owing to the popularity of the game and the passion for gambling it excites; the losses that have been incurred have done great harm to and caused much distress and trouble amongst the families of the Chinese resident in Singapore.\n\nIf steps had not been taken by Government to deal with the evil, this new Chinese lottery might have become as harmful to the private life of the Strait-born Chinese as the old Hoe-He or Wha-Way lotteries that flourished unchecked in the Straits Settlements some fifteen years ago.\n\nAs there seems to be some confusion of ideas abroad as to how the game of Chap-ji-ki played, I propose to explain briefly the manner in which the game of Chap-ji-ki lottery is conducted.\n\nThe game of Chap-ji-ki itself and the Chap-ji-ki lottery now carried on are different. The Cantonese and Hok-kien way of playing the ordinary Chap-ji-ki game varies a little but is roughly as follows.\n\nThe Chap-ji-ki game as played in China.\n\nOn a board about six feet long by four feet broad, the names of six Chinese chessmen are carved (the same six figures are found on all common Chinese playing cards, just as the figures King, Queen, &c., on English playing cards are derived from the figures used in chess).\nTHE GAME OF CHAP-JI-KI.\n\nThese six figures are called:\n\n1. Kun King,\n2. Su Chancellor.\n3. Chhiun Elephant,\n4. Ku Chariot.\n5. Be Horse\n6. Phau Bart.\n\nThese six figures are all called \"red\" cards. There are exactly six more similar figures of the same kind called \"black\" cards, i.e., there are six red cards and six black cards alike, or 12 cards in all.\n\nThe expression Chap-ji-ki means the twelve cards, chap-ji being twelve and the word ki merely a Chinese numerical classifier for the term card.\n\nThe playing board mentioned above is placed before the manager (po-koon) of the game. He is provided with twelve wooden chips like cards, cut out of wood, and stamped with the figure of the twelve cards used in the game. These little wooden tallies are kept in a small red bag by the manager's side.\n\nWhen the manager selects one of these wooden chips (or as we should say) a card for the public to stake on, he takes the selected card out of the red bag and puts it in a little wooden box, and places the box by his side on the table.\n\nThe players then sit round the table at the board and stake their money on one of the twelve cards cut out or stamped on the board, placing their stakes on the card or cards they select. In some cases the players are further provided with twelve cards corresponding to and similar to the figures of the twelve cards carved on the board. Players in this case put their stakes on the twelve cards dealt out as well as on the twelve card figures on the board.\n\nWhen everything is ready, the manager of the lottery takes the card he has decided to open out of the little wooden box, and declares it to be the winning card. If a player has staked on this card, he gets ten times the value of his stake, the remainder of the money staked on cards different from that one selected and declared to be the winning card by the manager, all goes as profit to the manager of the game. In the long run the manager is sure to make a fortune out of the lottery. Such, roughly, is the game of Chap-ji-ki, as it is now played in China.\nChap-ji-ki in the Straits.\n\nIn Singapore up till 1894 it was also played in this way by both males and females. During the last eighteen months or so, however, the form of the game has been much altered by Chinese ladies, by whom the game is now almost exclusively played.\n\nIt must be borne in mind that the principal changes introduced by Chinese ladies into this game, have been made solely with a view to prevent detection and render it difficult for the police to secure convictions in the Law Courts. The lottery is now managed chiefly by women. The chief changes introduced are as follows:\n\nThe Chap-ji-ki board is entirely dispensed with. Instead of the public being invited to go to a room where a board and other apparatus necessary for the game is furnished, the manager (usually a woman) engaged a large number of collectors (phoe-kha) of stakes (toan) the collectors went round the country and town and touted in all the private family houses to which they could gain admittance, and induced women, children, and servants to stake on some particular card. Asiatic ladies of the upper classes have much spare time on their hands and they are always fascinated by the excitement of gambling. When this excitement degenerates into a vice, diamond jewelry and clothing are freely staked or pawned to get funds to stake with. Collectors find little difficulty in getting support from the public. The staking public runs no risk except that of losing their stakes if the police raids the lottery. As soon, therefore, as the new form of Chap-ji-ki lottery caught on in Singapore, the managers of the chief Kongsi made piles of money whilst the gambling fever lasted.\n\nThe collectors or agents receive the money staked from private houses or from friends of theirs whom they allow to do a kind of sub-commission work for them, and wrap it up in packets (hong). On these packets they place symbolic marks to represent the value of the stakes. I give an illustration of the commonest form used:\n\nThus the value of a dollar is represented by a cross inside a circle; ten dollars by a circle with a transverse bar; one cent by \u2014; ten cents by O.\nThese signs are combined or doubled to represent higher values.\n\nThere are many other systems of keeping accounts.\n\nSimilarly there were many devices adopted to avoid being detected with Chap-ji-ki cards on the person. In some cases, written symbols, strings of beads, in other cases common Chi-ki cards, numerals, a certain number of coppers and dollars, and fancy hieroglyphics would be used. These dodges were adopted to avoid the risk of being arrested in possession of Chap-ji-ki cards. I have drawn up a chart of the various symbols used most commonly in place of the actual Chap-ji-ki. The stake (money or notes) was always put up together with this symbol (whatever form it took) used in place of the Chap-ji-ki cards and carried by the collector to the lottery.\n\nNothing is ever stated clearly on the writing paper they carry with them. Sometimes the card selected and the money staked on it is represented by some hieroglyphics agreed on between the collectors and their clients written on a small piece of Chinese white paper, sometimes buttons, sometimes beads are used\u2014sometimes the number of spots in a particular kind of handkerchief affected by Straits ladies are made up into a signal code. Very rarely now, if ever, are the Chap-ji-ki cards themselves used. Occasionally twelve particular cards are selected from the straits China-born Malay cards, called Chi-ki cards, and these particular twelve cards are then used to represent the twelve Chap-ji-ki cards.\n\nWhen the collectors have got in all their stakes, they all assemble at a certain place, at a certain time. This place is always fixed beforehand by the manager; and each collector finds her own way there by herself by a different way. Half an hour after, or so, the manager appears, and the whole party lock the front door for safety; then they either go upstairs or into a back room on the ground floor and open the lottery.\n\nThe lottery is managed in the following way. Each collector (who has already brought her money, i.e., the stakes of all her clients) with her and her memorandum (whatever symbolical from it may take) as to which card is staked on, comes forward to a table at which the manager sits and places her hong or packet (i.e., the money staked and the memorandum as to which it is staked on) on the table, when everything has been put on the\ntable, the manager by word of mouth announces the name of the card she has selected and declares it to be the winning card for the occasion. The bongs are then opened and the cards (or the symbols standing for them), compared: the winning packets are put in one heap and the losing packets in another. Ten dollars are paid to winners in return for every dollar staked. Each collector settles with the manager in turn; $1 being paid by the staker to the collector for every ten dollars won. Before the police began to hustle and drive these private lottery card parties, the manager or her husband used to carry the \"Bann\" to the place fixed on for declaring the lottery. The money in notes and silver would be done up neatly in paper and put in a small tiffin basket, ladies' satchel, or needlework box ready for use. After several prosecutions, however, this practice was given up, and the managers took to paying all the winnings they could with the money actually brought to the meeting as stakes and settled any balance due afterwards, with the collectors' in their husbands' shops. Finally the company breaks up and goes home one by one, so as not to attract notice. Special rickshaw coolies and gharry wallahs were engaged by the collectors to take them about. The manager usually employed a private carriage.\n\nThe lotteries were usually opened once or twice a day, once at about mid-day, and once at 8.30 p.m., or 9.30 p.m.,\n\nIn some of the lotteries, the amount of each stake was limited to $25 or $50, in other that would be staked was unlimited.\n\nThe manager has always one or two partners amongst the collectors. On each occasion a lottery is held these partners are told beforehand where the next place of meeting will be; the other collectors then go next day to the residence of the ladies in partnership with the manager and find out where they are all to assemble for the day's gambling. Sometimes when the police are particularly active the manager will not even tell the partners where the lottery is to be opened. She merely tells the collectors to meet at one of her partner's houses. In such cases the manager later on will go to the place where all the collectors have slowly assembled, and call in on the way and tell them to follow in small groups to such and such a place. The manager then leads the way to the place selected. One\nday the manager will go to Tangong Pagar, the next day to Serangoon, and the day after to Teluk Ayer Street. The lottery is never opened in any place more than once at a time. In fact these places change every day.\n\nThe places selected are chiefly houses with some means of escape through a back door into back streets or by drying lofts on the roofs into adjoining houses. The occupiers of the houses lent for the purpose of holding these lotteries usually received from $5 to $10 as a fee for lending this accommodation. Further, the male lottery managers managed to keep themselves well informed of what the police were doing by paying gambling informers to protect them. The greatest care, too, was taken to avoid being raided by the police after going out into the streets.\n\nThe managers and collectors had assistants regularly employed to act as spies and follow behind them, and give the alarm one or two streets ahead if they saw a suspicious looking gharry or rickshaw following, for, of course, if the collectors were arrested in the streets, all the cards and packets with the stakes were found on their persons.\n\nIt is wonderful how long this Chap-ji-ki lottery was carried on with complete immunity. It was excellently organised, and reflects credit on the skill of its promoters. The executive part of the lottery was left almost entirely to Chinese women. A few Chinamen kept in the back ground and controlled their operations.\n\nThe distinguishing feature between this Chap-ji-ki lottery and all other forms of gambling of this kind that have hitherto prevailed in our midst is that it was a close one. It was only open to one section of the public, i.e., to woman. It was also confined practically to the Hok-kien and Teo-Chin Straits-born Chinese women.\n\nThe women who supported this lottery, too, were mostly the families of the Chinese trading classes of position and standing here. The staking amongst the female members of the very many wealthiest Chinese families here was very large, and in several cases was attended with unpleasant results. It was very difficult to get evidence against the promoters of this lottery. Only collectors were allowed to be present at the opening of the lottery; no one except trustworthy and tried women were accepted as collectors by the manager.\nThe post of a collector is naturally one of considerable trust and confidence, for the collectors have to pay the winnings to their clients and if they did not do this honestly or if they combined with the manager to cheat the stakers the lottery would have been impossible. But the collectors were well paid, they received at least a commission of ten per cent from the stakers on all money won by them, and in the rare event of getting no commission on any particular occasion, the manager had to make a present of $5 or so to the collectors in proportion to the amount of stakes she had collected, to pay for her transport and other expenses.\n\nThe occupation of a collector, therefore, was much coveted, as it was a steady source of income. I am afraid, too, that there can be no doubt that some of the collectors did occasionally make a book with the manager and let the manager know what card would be best to declare and then shared the profits.\n\nDuring the last 24 months there have been three large Chap-ji-ki lotteries in Singapore. The game was first started in Johore before it was introduced here.\n\nRoughly speaking the daily total amount won at these three chief lotteries now was about from $300 to $500 or more, and the daily total profit of the managers was large. In some of the lotteries there is no limit to the amount that can be staked. Others are limited.\n\nThe solvency of these Chap-ji-ki lotteries was well secured, and commanded the confidence of the female staking public. The husband of the manager may have had sufficient funds to inspire confidence. If he was not a capitalist, two or three ladies of position and property would let it be publicly known that they would be responsible for so-and-so's lottery; and in return for the security thus furnished, these ladies would be taken into partnership by the manager and receive a share of the profits of the particular syndicate they guaranteed. After the Chap-ji-ki lotteries in chief were established and it was seen that big profits were being made, several ingenious spirits opened what they called Chap-ji-ki sub-agencies or branch firms. That is to say, the promoters made arrangements with one of the original chap-ji-ki syndicates by which they would be allowed to declare as their winning card whatever winning card the syndicate declared on any particular day. Some of these Chap-ji-\nki sub-agencies did nearly as much business as the principal lotteries. The Chap-ji-ki sub-agencies were opened in all the chief districts in the town.\n\nUnlike the principal or original Chap-ji-ki, the sub-agency was open to the general public, and both male and female collectors were employed to collect stakes. After the manager of a sub-agency had got together a small staff of collectors he fixed an some house (usually a private one) which he kept open at all times as a Chap-ji-ki office. The house got known to the public and a number of women would go to the house in person and stake.\n\nWhen the lottery was to be opened, the sub-manager would state that whatever winning card is declared to-day by so-and-so (one of the principal chap-ji-ki managers) that will be the winning card by which his own lottery will be decided. Directly the principal named had declared his winning card for the day, a messenger would be sent to the sub-agency to state what it was, and the sub-manager then announced it to the party of stakers who had already assembled in the meeting house. Very few precautions were taken in these sub-agencies and they were therefore easier to arrest. The amount staked, however, in the sub-agencies did not amount to more than a hundred dollars or so a day.\n\nG. T. Hare.\nBirds in the Botanic Gardens, Singapore.\n\nIt is a common remark of residents in Singapore that they never see any birds here except the one popularly called the black and white robin (*Copsychus saularis*). This however must be taken as due to want of observation, for birds here are very abundant and varied. It is true that they are not on the whole as conspicuous as they would be were the country not so thickly wooded, so that they can, and do, conceal themselves very effectually. One may traverse a jungle the whole day and hardly see or hear a bird, though a careful and quiet observer by remaining patiently on the watch in a suitable spot may make the acquaintance of a number of very charming and interesting ones. As in the case of the mammals, the early morning and late evening is the best time to watch the birds. Living in the Botanic Gardens with its patches of shrubbery, woods and lakes, I get an opportunity of seeing them when all is quiet, and as many rare and beautiful ones have from time to time visited the gardens, I think a few notes on their habits may not be uninteresting to bird-lovers. The Raptorese are frequent visitors, and of these the large grey and white sea-eagle (*Haliaetus leucogaster*) is one of the most conspicuous, often passing over or resting in the trees on its return from a day's fishing in the harbour. For many years one nested in the garden jungle and the young ones could often be seen moving about the garden when all was quiet. The nest, a huge mass of sticks, was placed in the upper branches of a big tree and quite inaccessible from the ground. Eventually it was blown down and the bird did not replace it. During the middle of the day when the coolies were away, and no one about, the birds used to fish in the lakes, and I several times found the remains of large catfish lying on the paths, fragments of their midday meal. On one occasion I found a portion of a cuttle-fish lying in the garden-jungle, which must have been brought to feed the young, from the sea, a distance of nearly four miles at least. The sea-eagle is very abundant in the harbour and\nmay often be seen fishing there; and it is not rare to see two birds fighting for the possession of a fish captured by one of them. Off Pangkore I have twice seen them attacked by crows, and attempting to defend themselves by turning on their sides in the air and striking with their claws. Sometimes over-balancing themselves they turn completely over, executing a kind of lateral summersault. After heavy rain they may often be seen drying their wings on the dead limb of some lofty tree, and in this way sometimes fall victims to bird-shooters.\n\nA fine hawk which nests regularly in the garden jungle is the beautiful grey and white serpent-eagle (*Spizaetus Limnaetus*) \"Lang Borek\" of the Malays. The young birds are brownish in colour, but the adult has a white head and neck and grey wings, looking like a miniature sea-eagle. The nest consists of a mass of sticks on the fork of a branch in a lofty tree, and has been in use by the birds for over nine years. The birds may almost always be seen and heard about the gardens; their cry is a piercing whistle often repeated, not unlike that of the English buzzard. They seem to prey upon small birds, and perhaps snakes, but do not seem as a rule to attack chickens, but the Malays say they are very fierce and attack young monkeys.\n\nThe fine Horsfield's eagle (*Limnaetus Horsfieldi*) is not a rare visitant, but seldom stays long; one however remained for some months in the garden jungle. It is a very bold bird, and I saw one swoop four times in succession at a terrier, rising again when within a few inches of its back. Its movements were so noiseless that the dog did not notice it till it struck him with its wing as it rose. It is a great enemy to chickens, and often catches them, but it is most commonly to be seen perched on a burnt tree-stump in the fields of lalang in the interior of the island, watching for small birds. I have several times had it in confinement, but it is always restless, constantly dashing against the bars of its cage. It is a handsome bird, entirely sooty-grey in colour.\n\nAnother large dark grey owl-like hawk which stops sometimes in the gardens is *Spilornis bacha*. It is likewise an enemy to chickens, but kills also wild pigeons and other birds. I have seen it with a roller (*Eurystoma*) in its claws. The roller has a habit of sitting on the topmost twig of a tree in the evening, forming a conspicuous object and an\neasy prey to the hawk. When one of these hawks settles in a tree it is immediately surrounded by a crowd of small birds, who chatter at it, although as a rule they do not take any notice of the other hawks previously mentioned.\n\nA much rarer visitor is the charming little black and white hawk *Baza lophotes*. Indeed I have only once seen it in the gardens. It is about as big as a kestrel, with the head, neck, and wings black, with a white bar on the latter; the breast is white, and the belly white barred with brown, the tail black above and grey beneath.\n\nThe Brahminy kite (*Haliastur indus*), so common and conspicuous in the harbour, may often be seen. I have seen as many as five at once in the garden. I believe it nests in large trees near Tyersall, as young birds were seen and caught in and round the gardens, but I never found the nest. The young are dull brown in colour, and only the adults have the red wings and white head which makes them so ornamental. It lives very well in confinement.\n\nOne evening a cooly found in the gardens two small white hawk-eagles (*Nisaetus pennatus*), fighting furiously on the ground. Throwing his coat on them he caught one and bore it off to the aviary. By a mistake it was put into a cage with a large sea-eagle, but all went well till the birds were fed, when the small eagle disregarding its own piece of meat attacked the sea-eagle and attempted to rob it of its portion. The latter being much the bigger and stronger bird, caught the assailant by its wings in its claws and held it fast. The little eagle was quickly rescued and transferred to another cage where, though somewhat ruffled, it seemed quite at ease, and sat on its perch elevating its crest like a cockatoo. Next day, however, immediately after eating its meat it fell dead off its perch. A postmortem examination disclosed that the liver was extensively lacerated and other internal organs much torn. This must have been done in the first fight, as the sea-eagle never touched its body with its claws at all. It was wonderful that the bird showed such pugnacity after such severe injury.\n\nThe Asiatic sparrow-hawk (*Accipiter virgatus*), a little bird very closely resembling the English sparrow-hawk, is very common. I have watched it chasing a starling round and round the trees for some time, and have seen one dart on\na bulbul and bear it off shrieking in its claws. These birds feed also on lizards, and one was once caught in the gardens which had pounced on a chameleon-lizard (*Calotes versicolor*).\n\nThis list of hawks and eagles does not by any means comprise all the birds of this group to be met with in Singapore. We have also here the Goshawk (*Astur soleensis*), the Osprey (*Pandion haliaetus*), sometimes to be seen near the coast, and some greater rarities such as the Tweeddale Buzzard, (*Pernis Tweedaii*), and *Spizaetus Kieneri*, a most beautiful sepia-brown hawk with a fine crest, which it raises and lowers at intervals, and thickly feathered legs. This very rare bird was caught in the act of killing some tame pigeons, and the lady who caught it sent it to the aviary, but after it had been some time in its cage, it accidentally escaped and was seen no more.\n\nOwls (\"Burong hantu\" of the Malays) are plentiful in the gardens, and are always to be heard calling at night. The great fishing-owl (*Ketupa javanensis*) hiding by day in the woods may be seen at night gliding noiselessly in search of mice over the flower-beds. I saw one flit by me once with a shrieking fruit-bat in its claws. It is called \"Ketumpo Ketambi\" by the Malays.\n\nOf the smaller owls *Scops Lempigi* is probably the commonest, a small stumpy brown horned owl, which can be heard at night uttering its cry of \"hoop hoop\" at intervals. It is rather a bold little bird, sometimes flying into the verandah and sitting on one of the beams of the roof, or even the verandah rail, quite motionless. It appears to feed on insects for the most part, and sometimes nests on a beam in the roof of a house, which the Malays consider very lucky, though here, as almost all over the world, the appearance of the bird in or on the house, is considered as a sign of approaching death. It is called \"jam-poh\" by the natives.\n\nThe smaller owls never live long in confinement, but the fishing owl is easily kept and is very long-lived.\n\nThe barn-owl (*Strix flammea*), though it occurs in the Peninsula, must be very rare; and the only one I have seen was exhibited some years ago at an agricultural show in Malacca.\n\nThe owls lead one naturally to think of the Night-jar, one of which, *Caprimulgus macrurus*, is often more common than welcome, for on moonlight nights especially it keeps up its wear-\nsome cry of \"Tock-Tock-Tock,\" sounding like the skimming of a stone across the ice. It is called by the Malays the \"Burong Tukang Kayu,\" or \"Carpenter bird,\" from its cry, and also \"Burong Malas,\" the lazy bird, because, like the English Night-jar, it makes no nest, merely laying its eggs on the ground beneath a bush. It much resembles the English bird not only in appearance, but in its habit of suddenly sitting down on the ground, often in the middle of the road, in front of the horse when one is driving, suddenly rising and flying a few yards and sitting again till one comes up with it. During the day it hides on the ground in the bushes or fern, coming out at dusk, and taking up its position on the topmost twig of a small tree utters its cry for hours together, every now and then darting off in pursuit of a beetle or moth. Certain boughs are evidently very popular, and if the owner of the position is shot another night-jar quickly takes its place. Besides the regular cry it sometimes gives a kind of chuckle, and at times a hoarse whirring like that of the English night-jar beginning with a kind of croak. It sometimes breeds in the gardens, but in June, the usual breeding season, most of the birds leave the gardens and one does not see or hear anything of them for some time.\n\nWe are too far off the big jungles for the beautiful *Lyncornis Temminckii*, the \"Tiptibau\" of the Malays, but this bird is very common in many parts of Singapore, flying swiftly at night and uttering its plaintive cry, \"Whit wh\u00fb hoo,\" whence it takes its Malay name.\n\nKingfishers of four kinds inhabit the gardens, usually near the lakes. Of these *Alcedo ispidia* is perhaps the commonest, a bird closely resembling the English Kingfisher but duller in colour. The brilliant little deep blue *A. meninting* is often to be seen perched on a bamboo shoot and darting into the water after fish; while the two larger kinds *Halecyon smyrnensis*, a light blue bird with a large red beak, and *H. pileata*, a brilliant deep blue bird with a white breast, seem to be less attached to the water, and are often to be seen at some distance from it. The Malays call the kingfishers \"Raja hudang,\" literally \"King of the prawns.\"\n\nThe common bee-eater, (*Merops sumatranus*), may almost be classed as a migrant, appearing at times most abundantly and then disappearing for months. It is called \"Berik-Berik\" by the Malays, who believe that it flies on its back in the evening. It\nis often to be seen sitting on bamboos or the tops of small trees, whence it darts off in pursuit of insects. When burning scrub, the birds often come to catch the grasshoppers driven out by the fire, and at the first puff of smoke, they would hasten to take up their position on the nearest small tree and commence dashing into the smoke after their prey. The bee-eater nests in sandy places, making burrows in the ground, the sandpits on the Serangoon Road being a favourite resort.\n\nThe green bee-eater, *Merops philippinensis*, is less common than the *M. sumatranus*, but may be seen from time to time. It is distinguished easily by the absence of the chestnut colour on the head and neck of the commoner kind.\n\nFor some reason Hornbills are very seldom to be seen in Singapore, although there is a good deal of suitable jungle for them, for they are strictly forest birds living on the wild nutmegs, and other large jungle fruits. The small black and white hornbill, *Anthracoceros convexus* (\"Burong Enggang\"), I have once or twice seen on Bukit Timah. I had one in captivity for some time which became very tame and was wonderfully clever in catching bits of bread thrown at it. It used to be very quick at catching sparrows if they imprudently flew through its cage. When caught it would crush them with its powerful beak and throwing them up in the air catch and swallow them. The only Hornbills I have ever seen in the gardens were a pair of Rhinoceros Hornbills (*Buceros rhinoceros*), which appeared to be resting in one of the big trees in the garden in the course of a long flight. This kind is the largest of our hornbills; it is black and white, with a very large beak, the casque of which is turned up at the end. The beak and casque are naturally white, but during life are coloured orange and red. This is done by the bird itself, which every morning rubs its beak against a gland beneath its tail whence exudes an orange-red liquid which colours the beak. When a caged bird is unwell this gland produces but little of the colouring matter, so that the beak looks pale coloured, and gives a good clue to the state of the bird's health.\n\nParrots and paroquets are not as abundant in the matter of species as is naturally expected in a tropical country, but the few species we have are not as a rule deficient in point of numbers. The common long-tailed paroquet, *Paloeornis longicauda*\noften visits the gardens in flocks, and still oftener flies over, uttering piercing squeaks. It usually flies very high and fast, but if it finds a tree with fruit which suits it, will settle there and remain climbing about among the branches for a long time. It evidently prefers dry seeds to juicy fruits, being especially fond of those of the Mahang-trees (Macaranga) and the \"Pagar Anak\" (Ironanthes). Although its pink face, red beak, and blue tailfeathers contrasted with its green body are very showy when looked at close, it is wonderful how inconspicuous the birds are when creeping about among the leaves of a tree. This paroquet is called \"Bayan.\"\n\nWoodpeckers, \"Burong Gelatu\" of the Malays, are not uncommon, though less so in localities where there is much dead timber left standing. One of the commonest is Jungipicus variegatus, a little brown and white banded bird, commonly to be seen running about on the Waringin and on other grey-barked trees, where its colour makes it very inconspicuous. The great black woodpecker (Thripomax Javanensis) is a rare visitant; a pair remained for some time in a large Jelutong tree.\n\nBut the most interesting of these birds is the curious red Micropternus brachyurus. This bird always makes its nest in that of one of the tree-ants. The ants form a large black nest in a tree and the bird, which feeds largely on them, digs out a burrow and puts its own nest therein. It has been stated that these ants do not bite, but this is not the case; though small they are most vicious. The woodpecker nested for some years in a tree (Mimusops Elengi), close to my house, but the ant's nest collapsed one year, and the birds finding it gone on their return in the breeding season, went away.\n\nThe absence of crows from Singapore seems very strange, especially to visitors from India and Ceylon, where these birds are so much in evidence. The common crow (Corvus splendens) I have not seen south of Pekan, where it is common. The big jungle-crow, as large as a raven (C. macrorhyncha), passes over the gardens singly or in pairs once or twice a year, and for two or three years several remained for some months in and round the gardens, and I have little doubt that they nested in the vicinity, as there were as many as five together at times. Their cry is like the cawing of an English rook, often finishing up with a mewing like a cat. The native name for the bird is \"Gagak,\" or\n\"Dendang.\"\n\nThey are very fond of the fruits of the wild red pumpkin (*Trichosanthes*) whence the Malay name \"Timun Dendang,\" Crow's pumpkin.\n\nThe racket-tailed Drongo (*Dissemurus platurus Veill*), the \"chawi-chawi\" or \"chichawi\" of Malays, is very common in the garden jungle, and as it remains with us all the year I suspect it breeds there, but have not found the nest. Its black plumage and the long racket-shaped tail feathers which it bears in the breeding season make it very conspicuous. The tail-feathers are supposed by the Malays to be due to two *sumpitan* darts, which some hunter shot into the bird, and which it has had to carry ever since. The Drongo has a wonderful variety of notes, and also imitates other birds very well, generally commencing to sing in the evening.\n\nOf cuckoos, several kinds appear from time to time. The little grey cuckoo *Cacomantis threnodes* keeps up its wearying song all night, and has got the name of the \"Brain fever bird\" here. Its notes consist of whistles in a descending scale and are very plaintive. The Malays call it \"Tinggal anak,\" the deserted child, and say that as the old bird lays its egg in another bird's nest and abandons it, the young bird bewails its hard lot for the rest of its life. Though it is often to be heard it is by no means conspicuous, concealing itself in a thick tree, whence it keeps up its mournful song.\n\nThe Malay Coucal, commonly known as the Crow-pheasant (*Centrococcyx bengalensis*) sometimes appears in the long grass in damp spots. Its flight and red wings often deceive a stranger into the idea that it is a real pheasant. Its cry consists of a \"hoop-hoop-hoop,\" followed by a \"cuckoo-cuckoo,\" very harsh and mechanical in sound.\n\nThe quaint tufted cuckoo, (*Coccyzus coromandus*) grey with red wings, a long tail and a tuft on its head, has appeared in the gardens. It is rather shy and hides itself in the trees.\n\nThe black Cuckoo (*Surniculus lugubris*) is also to be seen at times. It is interesting inasmuch as it mimics the Drongo, closely resembling it in form and colour, though without the racket feathers, and owing to this resemblance it is able to get its eggs into the Drongo's nest for the unsuspecting owners to hatch.\nSwallows and swifts are abundant here and are collectively known to the Malays as \"Laiang.\" The common swallow (*Hirundo gutturalis*) very closely resembles, and indeed is hardly distinct from the English swallow *H. rustica*. It is rather smaller, with the under parts whiter, and the black collar round its throat is incomplete, but the common form in the gardens is really intermediate between the two, for while it has all the other characters of the Eastern swallow, *H. gutturalis*, the collar is quite complete and very broad. It remains with us all the year, but I have not found its nest. We are accustomed in England to foretell rain by the low flight of the swallows. Here, however, this is no clue, the height at which the swallows fly depending on the insects on which it feeds, which do not keep near the earth before rain, as they do in England. The termites frequently swarm during wet weather, especially indeed during heavy rain, and the swallows and swifts, with many other birds, and dragonflies, come to feast on them. As the swarm gradually rises into the air the birds rise with them, and fly high or low according as the termites do. The Palm-swift (*Tachyornis infrumatus*) is usually very plentiful, a most graceful and quick little bird, entirely black in colour. The nest, which is very small and cup-shaped, is fastened to the under-side of the leaf of a fan palm in such a manner that the little bird has to sit upon it with its breast pressed closely to the leaf, its body being almost parallel to it. The eggs are very small and pure white. The Edible-nest swift (*Collocalia Linchi*) occasionally appears in the gardens as a visitant, but of course does not nest anywhere near Singapore.\n\nThe large swift (*Cypselus subfurcatus*) a black bird, with a white bar above the tail, is very common and conspicuous. It nests beneath verandahs and such places, making a colony of nests of mud, grass, bents, feathers, etc., in a very untidy manner. It is a very large and rapid bird, but less so than the great spine-tailed swifts (*Chaturra*) which may from time to time be seen flying over the gardens, usually at a great height; they are abundant at times on Bukit Timah, where they can be seen dashing past the bungalow often in great numbers. These spine-tailed swifts are probably the fastest flyers in the world.\n\nThe Roller (*Eurystomus orientalis*) is often to be seen sitting on the topmost branches of the trees, and with its deep blue\nplumage and bright red beak is a most attractive bird when seen close. At a distance in form and flight it may be mistaken for the Tiong (Eulabes), the dark colour of its plumage appearing black and the light blue spots on its wings resembling the white ones in the same part of the Tiong. Indeed it seems to me that it mimics the latter more powerful and aggressive bird, and perhaps may thus sometimes escape the attacks of hawks, to which, however, it not rarely falls a prey on account of its bold habit of sitting in the most conspicuous positions.\n\nThe Orioles are represented by the beautiful black and yellow \"Chindrawaseh\" of the Malays (Oriolus indicus), which is often kept in cages by the natives, especially in Java, where it is more common than here. It is only a casual visitor, and is usually to be seen about Waringin trees when the fruit is ripe.\n\nThe Tiong (Eulabes javanensis) usually visits us in small flocks. It is rather a noisy aggressive bird, especially when a number collect in the jungle where there is a tiger or pig, when all flock together in the adjoining trees and make a great noise at the reposing animal. The Tiong is often kept in cages by the natives, and learns to talk very well, but it is rather delicate and apt to die suddenly. The natives say that it always expires at the sight of blood. Some years ago when a number of these birds were being kept in Malacca, an order was sent round that all Tiongs were to be set free, apparently under the impression that they were insect-eaters, and would benefit the place by being released. The district presently abounded in these bird, which for some time did not go away from the spots where they were set free. Unfortunately the Tiong feeds exclusively on fruit, so that they produced no benefit to the crops, but probably rather the reverse. Its ordinary cry is Tiong-Tiong, whence its Malay name but it also makes a low gurgling sound like distant human voices.\n\nThe Glossy Starling (Calornis chalybeus) is most abundant at times, flying in large flocks and wheeling in masses like the English Starling. It is however a more beautiful bird, being of a very deep green colour with crimson eyes. It feeds entirely on fruits, being especially fond of those of the Waringin. It is known as the \"Perling\" by the Malays.\n\nThe Ant-thrushes or Pittas are regular visitants, but do not stay long, and I doubt if they breed here. The only one I\nhave seen in the gardens is *Pitta moluccensis*, as beautiful a bird as any in the group. The head is gray, with a black streak near the eye, the back of a dark green colour, the lower part and wing coverts of a lovely metallic light blue, and the breast buff with a crimson red patch beneath the tail.\n\nLike all ant-thrushes it remains concealed in the bushes the whole day, usually hopping about the ground. If the thicket is a small one the bird is easily approached, as it will not leave the shade unless absolutely compelled; but just after dark it begins its loud call, and will come up quite close, even from a considerable distance, if it is imitated. During the night it is silent, but commences to call again just before sunrise, ceasing when the sun is up. It probably feeds on insects, but other species such as *P. boschii*, which lives about limestone rocks, feed on snails, cracking the shells as a missel-thrush does in England. Piles of the shells broken by the pittas can often be seen round the limestone rocks, in Selangor, Pahang, and elsewhere. I have however never seen broken shells in the haunts of *P. moluccensis*.\n\nThe bird best known to the residents here is the so-called black and white robin (*Copsychus saularis*), the \"Murai\" of the natives. Its habit of hopping on the grass with its tail erect suggesting that of the English robin, is probably the origin of its popular name, though in other respects it resembles a blackbird, to which bird it is more nearly allied. It nests commonly in the gardens in May. The nest resembles that of a blackbird. It is placed in the fork of a tree low down, or in a palm, between the leaf stalk and the stem, or sometimes on a beam beneath the verandah of a house. It contains two eggs, somewhat suggesting in form and colour those of a missel thrush, bluish grey with dark red blotches, especially numerous at the broad end.\n\nThe bird sings very sweetly just before sundown, sometimes perching on the top of a high spray and pouring forth a volume of melody like that of an English thrush. In the evening it emerges from the shade of the bushes where it has been concealed during the hotter part of the day and hops upon the grass-plots like a blackbird in search of worms and insects. It is indeed a most useful insect-destroyer, attacking and devouring even large caterpillars. I once saw one pecking at an unfortunate young mouse, which had apparently been somehow washed out of its nest by a heavy\nstorm of rain. On another occasion I saw one furiously attack a squirrel (*Nanosciurus exilis*) which was climbing on a tree and knock it off the branch to the ground. Again the squirrel attempted to climb up, and again it was struck to the ground; even then the Murai pursued it till it fled to refuge in the bushes, still pursued by the bird.\n\nIn courting the female, the cock birds hop on the grass with their wings trailing on the ground, to show off the contrast of their black and white plumage, and then dash at one another, till the stronger bird has driven its rivals away.\n\nIt is often said that tropical birds have no song, but no one who has listened to the melody of the so-called Burmese nightingale (*Citocincla macrura*) \"Murai gila\" will agree to this. This beautiful songster frequents the thicker parts of the woods, often in some number, at certain times of the year, and though it seldom leaves the woods, it may be drawn to the edge by whistling the first few bars of its song, when it will come quite close and pour forth its melody several times in succession. If one bird sings in the wood, others will be sure to come and sing also. Unfortunately it does not stay long with us, being apparently a migrant. The song is as full and rich as that of a nightingale, which indeed it somewhat resembles. The bird itself resembles the Murai, but is more slender, with a long tail and a red breast.\n\nPerhaps our commonest bird is the Bulbul. (*Pycnonotus malais*). \"Merebah.\" It nests in March every year, in the bushes, often in quite conspicuous places, sometimes putting the nest on the leaf of a fan palm, close to the attachment of the blade and stalk. The nest is made of bents and roots and is quite a slight structure as a rule. It lays two eggs, thickly spotted with dark red all over but especially at the broad end, where there is often a ring of darker spots. It is an omnivorous bird, devouring small fruits of all kinds, especially those of the Waringin (*Ficus Benjamina*) and the cinnamons, and is very troublesome when the fruit is wanted for any purpose, often clearing the whole tree and disseminating seeds in all kinds of places, where young trees come up in the most unexpected manner. It, however, atones for the trouble it gives to some extent by destroying a good many injurious insects such as grasshoppers and termites. If a large hawk appears in the gardens it is the bulbuls which flock together to mob and annoy it. It is rather curious to see a male\ncourting the female. Erecting the tuft on the top of its head and holding its wings up in the air so that they are back to back it hops solemnly upon the ground to the admiration of its mate. At the courting season the topknot attains its full growth, and the feathers beneath the tail are of a brilliant yellow, so that it has rather an attractive appearance.\n\nThe large olive Bulbul (*Pyconotus plumosus*) the \"Merebah Rimbah\" of the Malays, a plain brown bird with yellowish patches on its wings, is not rare in the gardens, generally frequenting the thicker jungles. I found a nest close to the gardens in some ferns a couple of feet from the ground. There were two young birds in it which the old birds were feeding on grasshoppers.\n\nThe Meadow-pipit (*Anthus Malaccensis*) is very common in grassy spots, and also nests here. I have seen birds collecting bits of grass in June, evidently for a nest, and once found one in a depression in the ground with a young bird in it.\n\nThe Wagtail (*Motacilla viridis*) is only a visitant, though appearing in numbers at certain seasons. It does not appear to breed here.\n\nThe little brown shrike (*Lanius cristatus*) is a fairly common visitor. It can often be seen perched on a twig in open country or on the telegraph wires, whence it darts on passing insects.\n\nThe Green Tody (*Calytomena viridissima*), a lovely little green bird, with something of the appearance of a small parrot, may at times be seen in the denser wooded spots, quickly passing from thicket to thicket, and concealing itself among the green leaves. I have seen it in Selangor darting about to catch white ants when swarming.\n\nA very pretty little bird, resembling a goldfinch in the bright yellow and black of its plumage and its habits, is *Aegithina tiphia*. It frequents the Waringin trees especially, and may often be seen in pairs seeking insects among the branches. It nests in the gardens, as I have seen young birds unable to fly there, but I never found its nest.\n\nThe Tailor-bird, *Orthotomus ruficeps* is very common in the fern and open thickets and may often be heard twittering as it creeps about in search of insects. It has much the habits of the English Wren. The male is brown with a bright red head, the female is entirely brown.\nSeveral of the Munias are to be seen about the gardens, but the commonest is the little Munia Maya \"Pipit kapala putih,\" the white headed finch, which is most abundant, and flocks of twenty or thirty are frequently to be seen on the grass plots. It makes a domed nest of bents in a bush and lays a number of small white eggs.\n\nThe Java sparrow (Amadina oryzivora) is evidently not a native here. It is abundant in the gardens, where it nests, and in other places near town, but is never to be seen any distance from this part of Singapore.\n\nThe tree sparrow (Passer montanus) is also a town bird, and never seems to go far away from civilization. It nests in houses and is often a great nuisance, putting its nests in all kinds of odd corners, blocking waterpipes, and even sometimes utilising rolled up chicks as a suitable locality, so that when the chicks are lowered the whole nest falls to the ground. The nest and eggs resemble closely those of the House sparrow, but the eggs are greyer in colour.\n\nThe Sunbirds, often erroneously called Humming-birds by residents, are often to be seen, especially fluttering about the Hibiscus flowers seeking for insects. The commonest is Anthreptes Malaccensis, the male of which is a lovely little thing, with its head and back of a beautiful metallic purple, a brown throat and yellow body. The female is duller, mostly brown in colour. It makes a hanging nest on the end of a bough, about six inches long, of bark fibres and nests of caterpillars, and lined with feathers. The nest is pear-shaped with a hole at the side, and a kind of little eave is thrown out over it to keep the rain from getting into the nest. The eggs are three or four in number, small and rather a long oval in shape, light grey in colour.\n\nAnother charming little thing is Dicaeum cruentatum, a very small brown bird, with a scarlet head, which appears flitting about in the shrubberies from time to time.\n\nA less common visitor is Aethopyga Siparajah, a very small scarlet and black kind, very showy. It seems to be commoner near the sea coast, where I have seen it fluttering about the scarlet flowers of the beautiful tree Lumnitzera coccinea.\n\nThe Arachnotheras, or spider hunters, are duller coloured birds, conspicuous from their very long curved beaks. A. modesta haunts the large-leaved gingers, and Heliconias in the gardens,\nand I found a nest made of skeletons of leaves and fibres and bast, apparently from the lining of an squirrel's nest, and bark, between two leaves of these plants, which had been pegged together by bits of stick, by some person. One little bird was sitting on the nest nearly fully fledged. I have seen one of these spider hunters pursuing a very large cricket in the gardens, which I have no doubt it would have killed had it not been alarmed at the sight of me, though the cricket had exceedingly powerful jaws and gave me a severe bite when I caught it.\n\nOf pigeons, four kinds regularly haunt the gardens. The well known green pigeon, *Osmatreron vernans*, the \"Punei,\" often comes in small flocks when the berry bearing trees and especially the figs are in fruit. I have seen pigeons' nests in the trees which may belong to this bird, which breeds regularly at Changi. The nest is like that of most pigeons, a little mass of small sticks on which one or two white eggs are laid. It is usually placed in a most conspicuous position in a small tree. The ground pigeon, *Chalcophaps aenea* \"Punei tana,\" \"Burong Dekut,\" \"Serango\" or \"Leumbuk\" of the Malays) may often be seen about the grounds. Its dark green wings, and puce-coloured head and breast make it a very pretty bird, and it is popular as a pet among the Malays. Its peculiar habit of living almost exclusively on the ground, and its boldness, make it an easy prey to the bird-catcher, and it is caught in the following way. The fowler conceals himself in a hut of leaves or ferns, provided with a cow's horn and a long stick with a loop of string at the end. Having sprinkled some rice on the ground in front of the hut, he blows the horn so as to produce the cry \"hoop, hoop\" of the pigeon. The birds come, and settling down before the hut begin to eat the corn, while the bird catcher nooses them one by one with the aid of the stick and string.\n\nThe two turtledoves \"Tukukur,\" *Turtur tigrinus* and *Geopelia striata* are very common. The latter, which is the smaller bird, is kept as a pet constantly by Malays, who say that it prevents fire occurring in a house and also wards off evil spirits. In selecting one for this purpose much attention is paid to the sound of its cooing, and to the number of scales it has on its toes. These turtledoves are captured by birdlime in the following way. A stick about two feet long is smeared at one end with\nthe latex of the Getah Terap tree, and to the other end a decoy bird is attached by a string, the stick is fixed horizontally in a tree, and the fowler, concealing himself, waits till a wild bird attracted by the cooings of the tame one settles on the birdlime and is caught.\n\nTwo kinds of quails inhabit the gardens, viz., the little Blue-breasted Quail (*Excalfactoria chinensis*) and the larger Bustard Quail (*Turnix plumipes*). Both, I have reason to believe, breed in the gardens, but the only eggs I have found belong to the latter. It makes no nest, but deposits its four conical eggs on the ground, point to point like a plover, among long grass or sugar cane. The eggs are olive brown with darker spots. Quails are called \"Puyuh\" by the Malays, who catch them in an ingenious trap. This consists of a small rattan cage widest in front with vertical bars. It is just big enough to contain a cock quail, which is put inside. In front of the fore part of the cage is a square of fine net in a bamboo frame, which is attached to the upper part of the cage on a transverse bar; on the upper bar of the net at each end is a loose iron ring. When the trap is set, the net is raised and kept in position by the aid of a thin piece of string and a peg, and the rings are pushed on to the ends of the upper bar. When a quail, induced by the challenge of the caged bird, runs up to the bars of the cage to fight with it, it touches the string which releases the peg and the net falls over the front of the cage, enclosing it. As it does so the rings drop off the upper bar, and sliding down a vertical bar fall in such a position that they hold not only the lower horizontal bar of the net but a portion of the projecting bar at the bottom of the cage, thus holding the quail tight between the net and the cage. It is then taken out and put in a bag. The quail catcher also carries a kind of large spatula of wood with which he beats the grass to drive the quails towards his trap.\n\nAmong wading birds the Golden Plover (*Charadrius fulvus*) and the Snipe (*Gallinago stenura*) are often to be seen in swampy parts of the garden in the season, and the Snippet (*Tringoides hypoleucus*) is always to be seen around the lakes at the same time, but none of these birds nest here. The Water cock (*Gallicrex cristatus*) haunts the wet grassy spots in the Economic Garden, and may often be heard uttering its curious crowing cry in the evening. The white-breasted Water-hen (*Erythra*\nphoenicura) with its grey back, white breast, and red rump, is a permanent resident, running about among the flowerbeds and bushes in the evening but lying quiet all the day. I have several times had these birds brought to me which had flown into houses at night, apparently dazzled by the lights, but it rarely lives long in confinement. The banded rail (Hypotoenidia striata) haunts thickets in wet spots and lies very close unless disturbed by dogs. The small white egret, which is not so common in Singapore as in most parts of the Peninsula, has visited the gardens, where one remained by the lakes for several days a few years ago, and the little blue Heron, (Butorides javanicus), so common in the mangrove swamps comes from time to time to the lakes where it may be seen fishing. The only visitant of the duck tribe is the charming little Goose-Teal, (Nettopus coromandelianus) This is mentioned as visiting the gardens lakes many years ago by Mr. Davison in the \"Ibis.\" A pair appeared here in January (1898) and remained on the lake for some weeks. It is a very common bird in India, but by no means so in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThis by no means exhausts the list of birds to be seen in the gardens from time to time by careful observer; but it servers to give an idea of the abundance of bird-life in the neighbourhood of the London of the East.\n\nII. N. Ridley.\nThe Peliosanthes of the Malay Peninsula.\n\nBy H. N. RIDLEY.\n\nThe Peliosanthes belong to a small group of plants which have been put variously in the order Haemodoraceae and Liliaceae on account of the half inferior position of the ovary. Mr. Baker in the Journal of the Linnean Society, Vol. xvii., puts them among the aberrant Liliaceae, while in the Flora of British India they will be found under the Haemodoraceae. No one I should imagine would consider them as being related to the Australian genus which gives to this order its name, while on the other hand aberrant as some kinds are they resemble in many respects the group of Liliaceae known as Convallariaceae, of which the lily of the valley is a well known type.\n\nThe little group to which the Peliosanthes belongs contains three genera. Peliosanthes, Ophiopogon and Liriope, and as they are not closely allied to any other group, may be classed as the group Ophiopogoneae of Liliaceae.\n\nThe whole group is confined to India, Cochin China, China and Japan, the Malay Peninsula, and the Malay islands, the greater number belonging to the Indian and Chinese regions. In the Malay Peninsula we have only the genus Peliosanthes (with the addition of a single little-known species of Ophiopogon,) and of this we have seven species. The remaining species of the genus being found in India (seven species), in Siam and Cochin China (two or three) and Java one species. It is rather remarkable that so few are to be found in the neighbouring islands, but probably they will be found in Sumatra and Borneo as well as in Java when sought for.\n\nDescription of the genus, Peliosanthes.\n\nSmall herbs with a short creeping rhizome, and strong wiry roots. Leaves rather stiff, lanceolate or ovate lanceolate with long petioles, strongly ribbed, frequently with distinct transverse nerves. Inflorescence, a raceme of small flowers green or purple, rarely white, usually shorter than the foliage. Bracts, lanceolate dry, often more than one to the flower. Flo-\nwers solitary or more rarely two or three together in each bract. Petals and sepals lanceolate, usually similar, spreading or incurved. Stamens six, usually forming a fleshy ring, the broad filaments being connate, but sometimes free, anthers very small introrse. Pistil adnate to the staminal ring, or partly or entirely free from it; style short conical, with three small recurved stigmas. Ovary superior or inferior, rarely half inferior, three celled. Fruit capsular, splitting at the top when very young. Seeds one to three developed, pushing through the top of the capsule when quite young and developing outside it, oblong and pale blue when ripe, with a thick fleshy outer coat.\n\nThe most striking peculiarities in the structure of the flowers are those of the staminal ring and the fruit.\n\nIn the allied genera the stamens are all separate, and in P. stellaris they are almost separate, that is to say they can be easily separated without tearing. In the other species however the filaments are joined into a thick fleshy ring. This ring is also joined to the lower part of the perianth and often to the lower part of the ovary. The point at which the staminal ring and ovary join forms really the best way of separating the different species. Thus in P. violacea, one of the commonest species, a longitudinal section through the flower shows that the ovules are above the point at which the staminal ring joins, so that in this plant the ovary is superior. In P. stellaris on the other hand, the ovules are below the junction, and the ovary is inferior.\n\nThe peculiar way in which the seeds develop has been described in the account of the genus. It is almost unique in the vegetable kingdom. However many ovules there may be in the ovary, only one, less often two, and more rarely three develop, the others withering up. The seed grows in the ovary, but soon getting too large pushes its way through the top of the ovary and ring of stamens and projects as an oblong body at first of a peculiar deep green colour, then when ripe of a bright azure blue. This blue part is the testa or seedcoat which is fleshy and apparently eaten by birds or mice. Within this is a hard globular endosperm enclosing the embryo. The whole arrangement is destined to aid in the dispersal of the plant. The conspicuous blue outer coat serves to attract the birds, which\nswallow the seed whole and pass the endosperm unhurt.\n\nThe Peliosanthes are inhabitants of thick shady jungles, often growing among rocks. They are known by the natives as Lumbah Bukit (Hill Curculigo) and Pinang Lumbah (Palm Curculigo) from the resemblance of the leaves to those of the Amaryllidaceous plant Curculigo, also Tukas Tikus (Mouse Caryota) and Suludang Pinang.\n\nThey do not appear to be used by the Malays medicinally or otherwise, but I notice that the flowers and rachis of most species contain indigo, turning blue when bruised. These plants are easily cultivated in pots, and although not as striking as many other jungle plants, are worth cultivating on account of their broad stiff leaves and curious flowers. The finest of our species are *P. albida* from Perak with a tall raceme of small white flowers, and *P. violacea* with nearly globular violet purple almost black flowers. The most beautiful of all known kinds is *P.\u2014(Lourya)* from Cochin China, which has much the largest flowers, cream-colored with a black staminal ring. This plant has been made the type of a new genus *Lourya*, but it differs structurally in no way from any other species of the genus.\n\n**Key to the species.**\n\nFlowers several in each bract.  \n*P.

It has very copious and long wiry roots. I have not seen it elsewhere than in Singapore, unless a plant with very much broader leaves and smaller flowers from Malacca is a variety only, but my specimens are not sufficiently good to determine this.\n\nIt is quite possible that this is the plant intended in Andrews Botanical Repository T. 634, and the Botanic Magazine, T.\nTHE PELIOSANTHES OF\n\n1532 under the name *P. humilis*. It was said to have been found in Penang. But the description which is rather obscure does not fit the plant very well and no details of the flower are given at least in the Botanical Magazine figure, to which alone I have access. The specimens collected by Maingay in Penang and referred to *P. humilis* are said (Flor. Brit. Ind. l.c. p. 266.) to be flowerless, and are probably those of *P. stellaris* which is common on Penang Hill.\n\n*P. lurida* n. sp.\n\nRhizome stout with very strong thick roots.

Pahang, Tahan River woods.\n\nOur smallest species, a little tufted plant, remarkable for its little star-like flowers with very narrow petals and sepals the edges curled back. The ovary is very distinctly inferior, and is surmounted by a conical violet style longer than the stamens, which are barely connate, being easily separated and clearly shew that the ring is composed of the stamens, and is not any part of the perianth.\n\nIt flowers in February, and is very common on Penang Hill.\n\nThere are specimens of several other species in the herbarium of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore, evidently undescribed, but insufficient for determination. Most were obtained along the Tahan River in Pahang, where these plants were numerous; unfortunately at the time of our visit nearly all were in fruit.\n\nIn the Flora of British India there is also described an *Ophiopogon (?) prolifera*, from Penang, which was sent thence by T. Lewis to the Horticultural Society's gardens, where it flowered in 1845. It is very little known, but I suspect it is a curious plant which grows in masses on the rocks at the top of Penang Hill, but which neither in its native haunts nor yet under cultivation here seems ever to produce flowers.\nThe White Snake\nof the Selangor Caves.\n\nMany of those who have visited the wonderful caves near Kuala Lumpur have heard tell of the curious white snakes which occur therein, but few have seen them, and no specimens were sent to Europe for identification till this year, when several captured by Mr. C. B. Harvey and myself in December 1896 were sent, together with a drawing made by the former, to the Natural History Museum, where Mr. Boulenger kindly identified them as *Coluber tenuirus*, a snake widely distributed throughout Eastern Asia, occurring at Darjiling, Sumatra, Borneo, and China, but not previously known to occur in the Malay Peninsula.\n\nThe animals are quite harmless. They attain a length of over six feet, the largest taken being six feet seven inches long. In comparing the specimens from the Selangor caves with the description in the books of *C. tenuirus*, one notices some considerable differences in color, and as this difference seems to have a bearing on the peculiar habits of the snake here, I will describe it. The top of the head is bluish grey, and there is a black line about an inch long through the eye towards the neck. The neck and back are of a pale ocreous color, each scale being tipped with isabelline, getting paler towards the tail; the centre of the back is yellowish, and the belly pale yellowish white. The tail has a white bar along the back line, and the under part is also pure white; along the sides runs a purplish grey bar, becoming darker towards the tip, where it becomes back. The eyes are very large and black.\n\nThis coloring, as will be seen, is a very remarkable one for a snake, and would make it very conspicuous if it were to live in the woods or other open places, but is, as will be explained, remarkably suitable for its usual habitat. As far as is known the snake occurs here only in the caves of Selangor; and, it is stated, also of Perak. It frequents the darkest portions of the caves, often living at a considerable distance from the mouth, but it can sometimes be met with at the mouth, or near one of the large\nshafts which communicate with the top of the rocks. The caves swarm with bats, which however chiefly congregate in certain spots, entering by the shafts or other holes, and the snakes feed on these bats. They therefore have a habit of resting on the ledges of rock in the neighbourhood of the exits, with the head hanging over the edge, so as to capture the bats as they fly in and out. I have twice caught these snakes with bats in their mouths.\n\nThe walls of the caves, though of white crystalline limestone, are not pure white, but of a pale ocreous yellow, and here and there are black veins, running usually vertically down the sides. The coloring of the snake is so exactly that of the walls, the black line on the tail representing the shadow of a crack or projecting vein, that the animal when at rest on the walls is often exceedingly difficult to see, but when it leaves the rocks and creeps across the black mud of the floor it is of course very conspicuous, appearing to be pure white by contrast. So invisible is it indeed that the largest I caught (which was in the darkest part of the large dark cave, about half an hour's walk from the mouth) nearly escaped my observation, though I was looking carefully for them. It was resting motionless against the walls of the cave in an erect position, and I had passed it by, and only noticed it on returning, so beautifully was it adapted for concealment.\n\nThe snake being quite a harmless one has no need of warning colors in order to caution its enemies, as some of our poisonous snakes have, and it is probably quite free from any danger from enemies, as no snake-eating animals inhabit the caves, but its coloring must be extremely useful to it while lying in wait for its prey, which would hardly be able to see it when reposing on a ledge of rock.\n\nMr. Boulenger in his letter expresses a doubt as to this coloring being adapted to its surroundings, on account of the very wide distribution of the snake. I can find however no information as to its habits elsewhere, or even in what kind of localities it occurs. The only published accounts of it which I have seen merely describe its external form and color.\n\n(Boulenger, Catalogue of snakes. vol. ii. p. 47. G\u00fcnther. Reptiles of India. p. 242.\n\nIn some of the regions in which it has been found, such as\nSiam, Sumatra, and Borneo, there are limestone rocks and caves not only similar to those of the Peninsula but also possessing a very similar Fauna and Flora. Indeed it appears highly probable that this limestone formation was originally continuous with that of the Malay Peninsula. But I notice some very distinct differences in the coloring of specimens described in the above-quoted works and our animal. Thus in the Catalogue of Snakes the animal is thus described: \"Grey-brown or olive above head and nape uniform, anterior part of back with black transverse lines or network, posterior part with a pale vertebral stripe between two broad black ones, belly yellowish anteriorly, greyish posteriorly, a black stripe along each side of the posterior part of the belly, and along each side of the tail, separated from the upper lateral stripe by a whitish stripe.\"\n\nIn the parts italicised it will be noticed that there is a great difference in color. No part of our snake can be called even grey-brown, still less olive, the head has quite a different color from the nape, being bluish grey, and there is no trace whatever of any black lines on the anterior part of the body. In fact the snake as described in the Catalogue is much darker in color altogether. I may mention that all the specimens I have seen, ten were exactly similar in color.\n\nIt is usual in zoology, at least in the case of most orders of animals, to disregard variations in color as of no specific value, or at least to mention them merely as color-varieties. But though for mere classificatory purposes color is often unsatisfactory as a determining character, it is generally of the utmost importance to the animal, whose whole life history is more apt to depend on its coloring than on the presence or absence of an extra tooth or scale. A constant difference in coloring whether in plants or animals means a constant difference in the life of the whole organism. In a case like this, one may I think be safe in saying that the cave-snake has been adapted in a most remarkable manner to its exceptional circumstances, and is at least on the way to become a species distinct in the eyes even of the systematist.\n\nH. N. Ridley.\nSHORT NOTES.\n\nPrecocious Coco-nuts.\n\nMr. A. B. Stephens sends the following note on an aberrant Coco-nut.\n\nIt may interest some of the readers of your Botanical Notes to hear of the following freak of nature regarding a very young Coco-nut plant which I saw on my visit to the Yam Seng Estate, Perak. The nut was received amongst a great number of others on the 10th May 1897, and was laid out in the usual way with them. This particular nut only sent out a few small crinkly leaves of about 15 inches in height, but they are apparently coming from two stems, and from one of them there are no less than five fruit fronds, four of which are barren, but the fifth has ten beautifully formed small coco-nuts on it. Unfortunately the plant was pulled up and removed to the overseer's house on 23rd November, and it has considerably dried up, but it has been put out again and has a green shoot on it, so that possibly further developments may yet be seen. It must surely be almost a record for a nut to send out fruit fronds and actually bear nuts in six months and thirteen days.\n\nA. B. Stephens.\n\nCertainly this is a most remarkable monstrosity, and I can find no record of anything of the kind, but about a year ago a Chinaman brought to the Gardens in Singapore as a great curiosity a somewhat similar specimen. The nut was still attached to the plant, which bore the ordinary young leaves, from between which was protruded the portion of an inflorescence consisting of two short branches, the longest about six inches long, the other much shorter, which both bore the ordinary flowers. Naturally I thought at first it might be a hoax, such as the Chinese have long been famous for, but I carefully examined it and satisfied myself that the flower spikes really were attached in the axils of the leaves. The owner was anxious to sell it at the\nprice of 100 dollars. It would be very interesting to work out the anatomy of such curious phenomena as these. It is possible that the flower spikes were formed in the ovary long before, something after the manner of a monstrosity sometimes met with among the cruciferse (Mustard, and Turnip), where the fruit has been found to contain flowers instead of seed, but it seems more likely that it is a case of extreme precocity, where the young plant for some reason has begun to flower years before it might be expected to.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nThe White-winged Bat in Singapore.\n\nThe very curious and beautiful white-winged bat, *Taphozous affinis*, hitherto only known from Labuan and Sumatra, proves also to be an inhabitant of Singapore, a specimen having been captured at light in the Botanic gardens after a heavy storm of rain. It is a fairly large bat, the head and back of a deep brown colour, with a few white spots on the head, and the whole of the chest and abdomen covered with beautiful silky white fur. The wings at the base are black, gradually passing into white, so that the greater part of the membrane is white. The animal is also remarkable for the tail, which is rather long, passing through the membrane connecting the feet, (a character common to the group of bats to which it belongs, but of this group we have very few species here), and another remarkable peculiarity is the possession of a small pouch beneath the chin, the use of which is by no means clear.\n\nIt is possible that this bat is not so rare here as might be supposed from this being the first recorded capture in the Malay Peninsula, as I have seen several very light-coloured bats flying over the reservoir, which looked suspiciously like the white-winged bat.\n\n*Hyblea puera* cram.\n\nWhile travelling in the Dindings and Province Wellesley in the spring of 1897, I was struck by the appearance of the mangrove swamps near Prai and along the Bruas river, whole patches of which were absolutely bare of leaves, and looked as if they had been burnt. In some spots miles of trees were quite leafless, while in others only isolated patches were at-\ntacked. Closer examination showed that the devastation had been effected by caterpillars, which had now turned into chrysalids, rolled up in the remains of the leaves. A Malay at Telok Sera in the Dindings brought me some of these small black chrysalids, and from them I raised some moths which Mr. C. O. Waterhouse tells me are *Hyblea puer* cram. This moth, a native of the West Indies, India, Africa, and Java does not appear to have been recorded before from the Malay Peninsula. The Caterpillar seems to feed exclusively on the leaves of *Avicennia officinalis*, the \"Apiapi\" of the Malays. It is a valueless tree, even as firewood, and it is fortunate that the insect only attacks this tree and not the more valuable true mangroves, which might be a serious damage to our firewood supply in these parts.\n\nThe Moth is rather pretty, one inch across the wings, the upper ones brown with chestnut markings, the under ones orange colored with a waved black bar running round them within the margin, the edges of the wings are prettily fringed. The antennae are slender and thread-like.\n\nThe Malays stated that they had never seen anything like this devastation before, and certainly I never saw any other trees so despoiled of their leaves in this part of the world. It would be interesting to know if the trees have recovered the injury or are attacked again this year.\n\nH. N. R.\nAn Account of Some of the Oldest Malay MSS. now extant.\n\nBy the Rev. W. G. Shellabear.\n\nBy the courtesy of the librarians of the British Museum, the Bodleian library at Oxford, and the University library at Leiden, I was enabled in the summer of 1895 to make careful copies of some very old Malay manuscripts which are preserved in those libraries. As far as I have been able to discover, these mss. have never before been noticed in any scientific journal, and have never even been examined by anyone capable of understanding their historic and philological interest. This is the more remarkable in the case of those in the Bodleian library since it is probable that they are the oldest Malay mss. now extant, and are therefore of peculiar value to the student from their bearing upon the Malay language and literature.\n\nI had also an opportunity of making a brief examination of six interesting Malay mss. which are the property of the Cambridge University library, but as these have been described at great length by Dr. S. van Ronkel in Part 2 of the 6th Series of Bijdragen tot de Taal- Land- en Volkenkunde van Nederlandsch-Indi\u00eb, it is only necessary here to say that they were the property of a Dutch scholar, Erpenius, who died in 1624, and three of them appear from signatures to have belonged to a certain Pieter Willemsz. van Elbinck, who was at Acheen in 1604, went to the Eastern Archipelago again in 1611, and died in 1615 in London, two years after his return.\n\nThe manuscripts described in this paper consist of six letters, and a copy of the Hikayat Sri Rama, which is a Malay translation of the famous Ramayana. The letters are arranged, as nearly as can be ascertained, in chronological order, and at the end of the paper has been placed an extract from the Hikayat Sri Rama, sufficient to give a good idea of the spelling and of the diver-\ngence of this manuscript from the text used by R. van Eijsinga in his edition of this work.\n\nFor the benefit of those who are not familiar with the Arabic character, a transliteration in the Roman character has been made, and the six letters, being of some historic interest, have been translated into English.\n\nThe following is a brief description of the mss.\n\n(A) is a letter of authority to trade, given by the king of Acheen to an English captain, perhaps Sir James Lancaster, who was in charge of the first voyage to the Eastern Archipelago undertaken by the English East India Company, and was at Acheen in 1601. This manuscript is in the Bodleian library at Oxford, and is numbered MS. Douce Or. e. 5. It is on a single sheet of paper, and consists of four quarto pages of writing. The first page is in the Arabic language, and is the latter part of the letter of the king of Acheen to Queen Elizabeth, an English translation of which is found in Purchas's Voyages, entitled \"Hakluytus Posthumus, or Purchas his pilgrimes, London, 1625, fol. 4 vols.\" The first part of this Arabic letter was probably on another sheet, and may either be lost or possibly is preserved among the Arabic mss. in the Bodleian library. The second, third and fourth pages of the ms. contain the Malay letter, the text of which is given below. The handwriting is apparently that of a European, and it seems probable that this manuscript is merely a copy of the original documents. The original letter from the king of Acheen to Queen Elizabeth is said to be preserved \"in the Archives in London,\" and it is possible that it might be found if search were made among the early papers of the East India Company. The style of this Malay letter bears some resemblance to that of the English version of the letter of the king of Acheen to Queen Elizabeth. The heading \"Jawi yang di-persembahkan kapitan Inggris itu\" would seem to imply that the letter had also been written in some other language, probably Arabic; and it is remarkable that the word Inggris is used in this heading, whereas in the body of the letter the French word \"Inglitir\" is used, as also in letter B, from which it seems probable that the heading and the body of the letter were written by different persons. Captain Lancaster's interpreter was a Jew, who spoke Arabic, and we may perhaps conjecture that the letter of authority to trade, like the letter to Queen Eliza-\nbeth, was written in Arabic, and that the text here given is the Malay translation of it. This supposition would account for the absence of those forms of address which are usually found in Malay letters and can be seen in B, which is a very similar letter of authority. The letter to Queen Elizabeth is dated 1011 A.H., which is the year 1602 of the Christian era. The Malay letter of authority to trade was probably of the same date, and some such document is evidently referred to in the closing paragraphs of the letter to Queen Elizabeth, where it is stated \"we have incorporated them into one corporation and common dignity; and we have granted them liberties, and have shown them the best course of traffic.\" The following is the translation of the king of Acheen's letter to Queen Elizabeth which is given in Purchas.\n\nThe Letter of the King of Acheen to the Queen of England.\n\nGlory be to God, who hath magnified himself in His works, ordained Kings and Kingdoms; exalted himself alone in power and majesty. He is not to be uttered by word of mouth; nor to be conceived by imagination of the heart: He is no vain phantom; no bound may contain him; nor any similitude express him. His blessing and His peace is over all. His Goodness in the creature: He hath been proclaimed by His prophet heretofore, and since that often; and now again by this writing at this present, inferior unto none. For this city, which is not slack to shew their love, hath manifested it, in the entertainment of that Society, which filleth the horizon with joy, and hath confirmed it to the eye by a sign, which bringeth knowledge of remembrance of it generally, and particularly: and for that their request is just, with purpose for exchanges; and they themselves of honest carriage, and their kindness great in doing good in general to the creatures; helping the creature in prosperity and adversity jointly; giving liberally unto the poor, and such as stand in need of their abundance; preserving the creature in their uttermost, with a willing mind: which for them now is extended unto India and Arach; sending forth the chiefest men of discretion and note, calling all the best of the creatures to Council herein.\n\nThis is the Sultana, which doth rule in the Kingdom of England, France, Ireland, Holland and Frizeland. God continue that Kingdom and that Empire long in prosperity.\n\nAnd because that he, which hath obtained the writing of these letters from the King of the Kingdom of Ashay, who doth rule there with an absolute power; and for that, there came unto us a good report of you, declared and spread very joyfully by the mouth of Captain James Lancaster; (God continue his welfare long!) And for that, you do record that in your letters, there are commendations unto us, and that your letters are patent privileges; Almighty God advance the cause of this honourable consociation, and confirm this worthy league.\nAnd for that you do affirm in them, that the Sultan of Afrangie is your enemy, and an enemy to your people, in whatsoever place he be, from the first until now; and for that he hath lift up himself proudly, and set himself as the king of the world: Yet, what is he besides his exceeding pride, and naughty mind? Inthis therefore is our joy increased, and our Society confirmed; for that he and his company are our enemies in this world, and in the world to come; so that we shall cause them to die, in what place soever we shall meet them, a public death.\n\nAnd moreover you do affirm, that you desire peace and friendship with us: To God be praise and thanks for the greatness of His grace! This therefore is our serious will and honourable purpose truly in this writing, that you may send from your people unto our Bandar, to trade and to traffic: And that whosoever shall be sent unto us, in your Highness name, and to whomsoever you shall prescribe the time, they shall be of a joint company, and of common privileges: for this Captain and his company, so soon as they came unto us, we made them of an absolute society. And we have incorporated them into one Corporation and common dignity: And we have granted them liberties, and have showed them the best course of traffic. And to manifest unto them the love and brotherhood between us and you in this world, there is sent, by the hand of this Captain, according to the Custom, unto the famous city, a ring of Gold beautified with a ruby, richly placed in his seat; two vestures woven with Gold, embroidered with Gold, inclosed in a red box of Tzin.*\n\nWritten in Tarich of the year 1011 of Mahomet. Peace be unto you.\n\n(B) is also in the Bodleian library at Oxford, and is numbered MS. Douce Or. e. 4. This is undoubtedly an original document, for it bears the stamp of Sultan 'Ala'u'd-Din Shah of Acheen, and is evidently in the handwriting of a native. The letter is not dated, but being a letter of authority to Captain \"Harry Middleton\" for trading purposes, we are able to fix the date with some certainty, for we know that Sir Henry Middleton went out with Sir James Lancaster in 1601, and was appointed at Acheen to the command of a vessel named the \"Susan\" and sent to Priaman, a place a few miles north of the present town of Padang on the west coast of Sumatra, whence he carried home a cargo of pepper. His return was minuted 21 June 1603, which was nearly two months before the arrival of Sir James Lancaster. Moreover this letter bears strong internal evidence of being written at the same time, if not by the very same person as the original letter from which A. was copied, and the fact that they both belong to the Douce mss. would lead to the conclusion that they both came from the same source. The similarity of spelling will be seen to be quite\n\n* or China.\nremarkable, and it will be noticed that the spelling of C., which was written in 1612, at the same place, differs considerably from A. and B. Some of the chief points of resemblance between A. and B. are: the use of the word Inglitir for England; meli for bti; similarity in the use of tashdid in all the words common to the two letters, namely, sakahan, negri, kapal, kapitan, tutok, ia, memeli; and the use of suhabat for sahabat.\n\n(C) is numbered MS. Laud Or. b. I (R) in the Bodleian library. It is a letter dated 1024 A. H.=1612 A. D., from the Sultan of Aceh to King James the First of England. It is written on a scroll about three feet long, and is elaborately illuminated. The handwriting is good, being very much superior to that of B., but the orthography is in some respects very similar to that of letters A. and B.\n\n(D) is one of a small collection of seven Malay letters, which are preserved in the University library at Leiden, Holland. The trustees of the University library were kind enough to send these letters to England in order that I might have ample leisure to examine them and to copy them carefully. None of these letters had any catalogue number when I examined them. They are all official documents, and appear to date from the same period, about 1670 to 1680 A. D. I have selected two of these letters for reproduction in this paper. The one marked D. is a letter sent by the Captain Laut, a native commander of sea-forces, at the island of Bouton, south-east of Celebes, appointed by the Dutch East India Company, and addressed to the Dutch Governor General at Batavia. Neither this letter nor any of the other six appear to be of any very special historical interest. The date of this letter is 1080 A. H.=1670 A. D.\n\n(E) is another of the letters in the Leiden University library. It is an official letter from the King of Jambi, in South-east Sumatra, to the same Governor General to whom the above-mentioned letter was addressed, namely Johan Maetsuijer. This document bore no date, but it is minuted on the back in Dutch, in the handwriting of the period, as having been received on the 30th April, 1669.\n\n(F) is a letter preserved in the British Museum, where it is numbered Rot. Harl. 43. A. 6. This document came to the Museum about 1752 A.D. with the Harleian collection, but it\nprobably belongs to an earlier period, and may have been in the Harleian collection for many years before it came to the British Museum. It is remarkable that in this letter the word Sinnyor should be used in addressing an English captain. Internal evidence leads to the conclusion that the letter was written to the English captain at Jambi, on the East coast of Sumatra, from the neighbouring State of Birni, and not from Brunei in North Borneo; the spelling of the two words would be the same in Malay, but the Malay has been transliterated Birni in the text for the following reasons: In the first place it is difficult to believe that an embassy would be sent such a distance as from Brunei to Jambi for the purpose of procuring saltpetre and blankets, when the same articles could probably have been obtained much more easily from the Spaniards; and secondly the two countries are spoken of as being \"as if they were one country,\" which seems to exclude the possibility of the letter having been written from Brunei. On the other hand it is not so easy to account for the use of the word Sinnyor if the latter was written from Birni as it would be if it came from Brunei, where Portuguese and Spanish influence were very strong. It is mentioned, however, by Marsden that in 1629 a Portuguese squadron ascended the Jambi river to attack some Dutch ships which were sheltering there, from which it would appear that the Portuguese had made their power felt in that neighbourhood. The English Company, as well as the Dutch, had an establishment at Jambi, and it seems probable that the letter was written after that establishment was opened, but the date cannot be fixed with any accuracy. The handwriting of this letter is particularly good, and the traces of Arabic influences on the orthography, which are so strong in A. B. and C., are absent here. The letter dul is here frequently written with three dots under it, which appears to me to be an indication of Javanese influence, for in that language there are two \"d\" sounds, one of which is distinguished at the present day when writing in the Arabic character by placing three dots under it. The ga in this letter also frequently has the three dots under it, as the Javanese write it, but that is no criterion, for the same method of writing it will be found in A., B. and C. The Javanese titles adipati and pang\u00e9ran were evidently in use at Jambi when this letter was written.

This is an extract from the manuscript of *Hikayat Sri Rama* mentioned above. The book is a quarto volume of about 800 pages, and is preserved in the Bodleian library, Oxford, under catalogue number MS. Laud Or. 291. The paper appears to be of Eastern manufacture, and the handwriting is exceedingly good. The ms. is not dated, but the records of the library show that it was acquired in 1633. It seems probable that it came from the East at the same time as letter C., which was also in the Laud collection before it was acquired by the Bodleian library.\n\nI am much indebted to Rev. H. L. E. Luering, Ph.D., and Mr. R. J. Wilkinson, for explanations of difficult passages in these manuscripts and for the derivations of words of Sanscrit and Arabic origin.\n\n---\n\nA.\u2014Letter of Authority to Trade.\n\n\u062c\u0627\u0648\u064a \u064a\u0639 \u062f\u0641\u0631\u0633\u0647\u0643\u0646 \u0643\u0641\u062a \u0627\u0646\u063a\u0631\u0633 \u0627\u064a\u062a\n\n\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u062c \u064a\u063a \u0643\u0648\u0627\u0633 \u064a\u063a \u062f\u0628\u0627\u0648 \u0627\u063a\u062a\u0646 \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u063a \u0645\u0643\u0628\u062e \u0646\u062e\u062a \u0643\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062c\u0631\u064a \u0627\u062c\u0647\n\n\u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062c\u0631\u064a \u0633\u0645\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0643\u0644 \u0628\u062c\u0631\u064a \u064a\u063a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642 \u0643\u0628\u0643\u064a \u0627\u062c\u0647 \u0645\u0643 \u0633\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0627\u0645 \u064a\u063a\n\n\u0645\u0628\u0644\u0644\u0643 \u0643\u0646\u062f \u0633\u0648\u0631\u062a \u0627\u064a\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u062f \u0642\u0644\u0647 \u062f\u063a\u0646 \u062a\u064a\u0644\u0643 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0643\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u064a\u0644\u0643 \u064a\u063a \u062c\u064a\u0647\u064a\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\n1. Note that the word *Inggris* is used in this heading, whereas *Inglitir* is used in the body of the letter. It is remarkable that the change from *l* to *r* in the word *Inggris* should have become fixed so soon after the appearance of the English in Acheen, unless the change was previously made in some other language; probably the word came into Malay from one of the languages of British India.\n\n2. In this letter there is no *hamzah* in such words as *keraja'on*, *perkata'an* sa'orang, etc.; *merika'itu* is the only word in which *hamzah* appears.\n\n3. The spelling of *Sammudara* is interesting, especially in view of the fanciful derivation of the word from *semut rayat*, which is given in the \"Sejarah Malaya.\"\nThe letter nya written with three dots below and one above seems to be peculiar to this letter, and is probably only a freak of the European copyist. Sometimes the dot above is omitted.\n\nThe spelling of the words suka-hati-nya memori kamu tahu, and other similar forms, should be compared with the more modern system of spelling now in use on the Malay Peninsula. The spelling in this letter is very much more similar to the method of spelling used by the Arabs than the modern Malay spelling; which is what one would naturally expect.\n\nIn this letter most of the words of Sanskrit origin are spelt, as in that language, with a shin, whereas they are nowadays spelt with sin, though occasionally even now the shin is retained. Compare the Sanskrit manusha, manusya.\n\nIn Javanese the word dateng is spelt with the dotted dal.\n\nIn modern Malay arta is usually spelt harta, but the Sanskrit is atha.\n\nSangka is used here, and again lower down, in the sense of being suspicious, which is the primary meaning in Sanskrit.\nSOME OLD MALAY MSS.\n\n10. \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0628\u0646\u062f \u0628\u0646\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc\u0634 should probably read.\n\n11. Notice meti for belti. The ha at the end of the word bezjual is apparently intended for the ha of the particle lah, the lam at the end of the word jual being made to do duty for the particle lah as well. The tushaid probably belongs to the wau, as it certainly does four lines below.\n\n12. The use of the figure 2 for reduplications (angka dua) seems to be a modern contrivance; it occurs nowhere in these mss.\n\n13. This spelling of beniaga is much nearer to the Sanskrit than the modern berniaga. The same spelling will be found in letter C.\n\n14. This word is probably the Javanese agem (for piagem), meaning \"written authority\".\n\n15. Jaka for jika. This, according to Favre, is the form which the word bears in the Dayak and Batta languages.\n\n16. Naum or nawan is the Achinese form for naung.\n\n17. Berlain is perhaps a copyist's error for berlayar.\nThis word should be laut, the pa being a slip of the pen for ta.\n\nThis vowelling of trima is inexplicable.\n\nThe spelling of pesan is peculiar, and so is the derived form memesankan a few words further on, for memesankan.\nJAWI YANG DI-PERSEMBAHKAN KAPITAN INGGRIS ITU.\n\nAku raja yang kuasa yang di bawah aigin ini, yang memegang takhta kerajaan negri Aceh, dan negri Sammudara, dan segala negri yang talok ka-negri Aceh.

Probably this should be the Arabic word *thabit*, settled upon, determined.\n22. I take this to be *kawan*.\nmerika'itu dan akan arta merika'itu, dan akan segala mata-benda yang di-bawa merika'itu, tiada-lah merika'itu takot dan sangka akan daku. Dan akan segala kamu orang-ku pun, apabila merika'itu membawa sa-suatu mata-benda dari negri-nya ka-negri-ku ini, maka meli berjual-lah kamu dengan dia, dan bertukar-tukaran-lah kamu dengan sa-suatu mata-benda yang ada pada-nya dengan mata benda yang ada pada kamu; seperti kamu beniaga dan bertukar-tukaran mata-benda dengan orang lain itu dalam agem merika'itu deri-pada segala dagang-dagang pada beniaga dan memeli lada dan memeli mata-benda yang lain-nya, maka dengan orang Ingilitir pun beniaga kamu, dan meli berjual kamu. Dan orang Ingilitir itu pun, jika hendak ia nawun dalam negri-ku, barang brapa kehendak-nya, berkenan-lah ka-pada-ku; dan jika ia hendak berlain pun dari negri-ku, berkenan-lah pada-ku; maka jangan sa-sa'orang pun melarangkan dia berlain itu. Melainkan jikalau ada hak sa-sa'orang atas-nya atau pihutang sa-sa'orang atas-nya, jika blum di-bayer-nya, dan blum di-putuskan hakim hukum-nya, maka jangan ia dehulu berlain, hingga sudah-lah hukum-nya, maka ia berlain.

All ye who scan this letter shall [do so] with good will and peace, and listen to the words which it contains and understand them all. It has been my pleasure to declare for your information as follows:\u2014I have made friends with the king of England, and ye shall be friends with all the king of England's people, as ye are friends with all the rest of mankind in the world; and ye shall do them good, as ye do good to the rest of men. For I do good to them, and I receive them into my country and receive their gifts, and I look upon them favourably, for that I desire mutual affection with the king of England; and for that I desire to do good to all his people, I am treating well those who have now come, and [shall do so to] those who shall come hereafter. I have pledged my faith to those who come to Acheen and Sumatra, so that they shall no longer be afraid for their ships and their possessions and all the valuables which they bring, and they shall not be afraid or suspicious of me. And as for all of you my people, when they shall bring any valuables from their country to this country of mine, ye shall buy and sell with them, and shall exchange your valuables for any valuables of theirs; even as ye trade and exchange valuables with other people by\ntheir charters from all the foreigners for trading and buying pepper and buying other valuables, so shall ye trade with the English people and shall buy and sell. And the English people, if they desire protection in my country, whatever their desire may be, I approve of it? and if they desire to sail away from my country, I approve; let no one forbid them thus to sail. But if any one has any claim upon them, or if they are indebted to anyone, let them not sail until they have paid or until the judge has decided their cases; and when their cases are decided they may sail. Now as for this order which I command, for trading and buying and selling with the valuables which they have brought to my country, let them no longer fear or suspect; and ye shall not take tithes from any of the merchants who are in their ships, nor from any of the English people. And as for all the English people who come to my country and anchor their ships in the sea of Acheen, and in Sumatra and in the countries subject to Acheen, if a storm comes down upon their ships, and they are afraid that their ships will be wrecked for the violence of the storm, should they desire to discharge all the ships' cargo and request assistance from you, asking for small vessels and sampans to discharge all the valuables in the ships which are about to be wrecked for the violence of the storm, ye shall assist them to discharge their valuables as far as possible. And when their valuables reach the shore, ye shall restore the valuables to those that own them. If they voluntarily give you anything due to you for discharging the above-mentioned valuables, ye shall receive it. And if anyone of the English people shall die, and while he is sick unto death shall give an order to anyone to send his possessions and the possessions of the people whom he has brought, and shall order them to be delivered to his relatives and to the owners of the possessions, ye shall hold his Will valid. And if anyone of the English people shall die, his property shall go to some English merchant, or to some other merchant; the property shall be determined as belonging to the person, his associate in trade and buying and selling; ye shall give judgment according to the law of the country. And if any Englishmen go to law, their charges being one against the other or against some other person, ye shall give judgment according to the laws of the people of the country.\nB.\u2014Letter of Authority given to Captain Harry Middleton.\n\n1. The dal of datang is dotted, as in Javanese. This is the only instance in this letter of a dotted dal. Compare datang in letter in A. note 7.\n2. This word, which in modern Malay would be spelt with an alif instead of a hu, pertua, has apparently the same meaning as ketua, chief. Van Langen gives:\u2014Petuha: oudste, hoofd van een kampong.\n3. This is the writer's transliteration of Harry Middleton. See above page 110.\n4. The use of the Arabic word d\u00edchum for money is suggestive.\n5. This word, which will be found also two lines lower down, is probably from the Arabic root \u0633\u064a and signifies a signed document.\n6. According to the system of spelling used in these mss., this word must be pronounced di-chabuli; di-chabul would be spelt without the wau.\nBy the grace of the Lord of all the universe, the command of the most glorious one to all the officers of the country and the chiefs of all the countries which are subject to Acheen. Be it known unto you all as to this English ship, the captain's name is Harry Middleton, originally this ship anchored in the roadstead of Acheen; after being some time there, he asked to leave, and sailed for Java. If he buys pepper and so forth he will give\nyou money and so forth. Now these Englishmen are the subjects of my friend the king of England, and their captain and all their merchants are the servants of the king of England. Now the servants of the king of England are as if they were our people; if they buy and sell with you who live along the shores of Acheen, let all be done fairly. And this letter of authority which we give to him at his request, [is given] in order that he be not insulted by the people of our shores. If he shows this authority to any of you, ye shall show him honour; and let not one of you insult him. This is our command to all of you, Greeting.\n\nC.\u2014Letter from the Sultan of Acheen to King James I of England.\n\n1. Sindur, I am told, is the Hindustani for red-lead. The word is probably of Sanskrit origin.\n2. Throughout this ms. mas is spelt without an alif.\n3. This use of mengampukan in the sense of \"holding in possession\" or \"being in charge of\" is uncommon. Another instance occurs in Kitab Mukhtasar Sharaya Islam, page 367.\n4.

Note the spelling \u0633\u0631\u0648 This word is now pronounced by Malays seru, but it is probable that it is here intended to be pronounced serwa, for seru would have been spelt \u0633\u0631\u0648 as the word seru is spelt in the first of course much nearer to the Sanskrit sarva.\nSOME OLD MALAY MSS.\n\n125\n\n\u062f\u0627\u0631\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u064a\u062a \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u062a\u06cc\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0641\u062c\u062d \u0641\u0648\u062c\u06cc \u062b\u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u06a9\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\n\u0633\u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0631\u0641 \u062f\u0644\u0645\u0647\u06a9\u06cc\u067e \u06a9\u0644\u0641\u0627\u0647\u0646 \u06a9\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0628\u0627 \u067e\u062f \u067e\u0631\u0645\u06a9\u0646 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0641 \u0641\u06cc\u0647\u0642 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0642\n\u0633\u0641\u0631\u062a \u0644\u0648\u06cc\u0642 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0628\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0644\u0627\u062e \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0633\u0627\u063a\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u0644\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0628\u0633\u062a\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u06cc\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u06cc\u0628 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0633\u0627\u062d\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u06cc\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0631\u06af\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0628\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u06a9\u0644 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u062a\u0639\u0644\u0642 \u06a9\u0627\u062a \u0633\u0627\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u06cc\u0628\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0645\u06a9 \u062f\u0631\u0641 \u0641\u06cc\u0647\u0642 \u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628 \u0633\u0641\u0631\u062a \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0686\u0627\u062e \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u06cc\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0633 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0645\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u062f\u0627 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0646\u062f\u0631\u0641\u0648\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0628\u0641\u06a9\u0648\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0644\u06cc\u0645\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0644\u0645\u06cc\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\u063a \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u062f\u06a9\u0631\u06cc\n\u0627\u0639\u06af\u0631\u0633 \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u0628\u0631\u0646\u0627\u0627\u0645 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0628\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u0645\u0641\u06af\u0648\u0646\u06a9 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0641\u0631\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0644\u0646\u062f\u06cc \u062f\u06a9\u06a9\u0644\u0646\u06a9 \u0646\u0648\u0645\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0648 \u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645 \u0633\u06a9\u0644\u06cc\u0646 \u062c\u0648\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u06a9\u0631\u0686\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0646\n\u062f\u0646\u0644\u0648\u063a\u0628 \u062c\u0648\u06a9\u0631\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u0641 \u0633\u06a9\u0644 \u0633\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0628 \u0633\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0628\u0627\u0631\u063a \u0646\u0627\u0647 \u06a9\u0631\u06a9\u0627\u0628 \u0631\u0627\u062c\n\u0647\u0648 \u0647\u0645\u0628 \u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0633\u062e\u062a \u0645\u0646\u063a\u0631 \u0628\u0648\u0628 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0628\u06cc\u063a \u062f\u0633\u0631\u0647 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0645\u06cc\u06a9\u0646 \u06a9\u0646\u062f \u0647\u0645\u0628\n\u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0645\u06a9 \u0627\u062f \u062a\u0631\u0628\u0633\u062a \u062f\u0644\u06cc \u0647\u0648 \u0631\u0627\u062c \u0645\u0648\u0647\u0646\u06a9\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0627\u0639\u06af\u0631\u0633 \u0628\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06a9\n\u062f\u0645 \u0646\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u062a\u06cc\u06a9\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0627\u0645\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u063a \u062f\u0627\u0641\u0647 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\u06cc\u062a \u062f\u0648\u062f\u0642 \u0628\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u06a9 \u062f\u0633\u0627\u0646\n\u0633\u0641\u0631\u062a \u0641\u062f \u0632\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u0627\u062f\u06a9 \u0645\u0631\u062d\u0645 \u0633\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u06a9\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u06cc\u062a \u0645\u06a9 \u062a\u06cc\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0645\u0628 \u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a\n\n9.

The king who holds in his possession treasuries of gold dust and silver dust, and of\ngold mines in the country of Priaman in the Salida mountain; who holds in his possession nine kinds of jewels, who has umbrellas of gold, one carried on each side of him, weighing hundreds of catties, whose throne is of gold, whose cushions are of gold: The king who holds in his possession a horse with a golden saddle, with golden trappings weighing hundreds of catties with a golden bit set with jewels: The king whose coat of mail is of gold alloy, and whose helmet is of gold alloy, and whose elephant has golden tusks, a frontlet of silver, bells of gold alloy, with a chain of gold alloy. The king whose elephant has a high howdah of gold alloy, and whose shield is of gold alloy, and whose spear is of gold alloy, and whose matchlock is of gold alloy, and whose horse has a saddle of gold alloy, and whose elephant has a seat of silver, and whose howdah roof is of silver, and whose gong is of gold alloy, and whose implements are of gold and gold alloy and silver, and whose bathing bucket is of jewelled gold. The king who has provided for his own monument with a monument of gold, styled Megat Alam, descendant of the kings with monuments of gold alloy. The king who holds in his authority hundreds of kings on the eastward side, in the countries which are subject to Deli, and in the countries which are subject to Batu Sawar, and on the westward side in the countries which are subject to Priaman and to Barus. The king who equips seventy elephants of war on the sea coast, and store of all garments, and beautiful country seats, and magnificent weapons. The king who has received superiority from the abundance of the superiority of the Lord of all the universe, on the throne of the kingdom of Acheen, the abode of peace; who is the king who continually gives praise to the Lord of all the universe for the abundance of His grace which He has abundantly supplied in giving over to him the countries on the eastern side, such as Lubok and Pedir and Semerlang and Pasangan and Pasai and Perlak and Basitang and Tamiyang and Deli and Asahan and Tanjong and Pani and Rakan and Batu Sawar and all the countries subject to Batu Sawar and Perak and Pakang and Indragiri, and on the western side such as Chalang and Daya and Barus and Pasaman and Tiku and Priaman and Salida and Indrapura and Bencoolen and Salibar and Palembang and Jambi. To the king in England, named King James, who holds in his authority Britain and\nFrance and Ireland. May the Lord of all the universe perpetuate his kingdom, and also assist him against all his enemies. After that, be it known unto the king that I was very much pleased to hear the words of the letter which the king ordered to be presented to me. Now it is stated therein that the king requests that the English people may trade in Tiku and Priaman, and that they may settle there to trade, as in the time of His Highness the late Saidu 'l-Mukammal. Now it is my decree that the English people cannot, as desired by the king, receive my permission to trade in Tiku and Priaman, and cannot settle there to trade, for those countries are wild, and moreover are distant from us. If the people of Tiku or Priaman should molest them, we should certainly get an infamous report with King James. By the grace of the Lord of all the universe, if the English people who are servants of the king desire to trade, let them trade in Acheen; and if they desire to send their factors to trade, let them send them to Acheen, so that whoever shall molest them we may quickly make inquiry and punish with a just punishment, since they are the servants of the king who is in correspondence with us. May the Lord of all the universe give peace to King James on the throne of the kingdom of England for ever.

After that, your friend the Captain Laut informs the Gouverneur General that when I was sent by my friend the Raja of Buton I accompanied His Highness the Sultan of Ternati, and we went together with Admiral Cornelis Speelman to Macassar, in order that I might do our business; but the Captain Laut informs you that when the power of the Company together with the power of God should have completed our business, it was the intention of the Captain Laut to show his face to the Heer Gouverneur General, to satisfy his heart. But just now the admiral has returned to Jakatra, and only my lord the Raja of Ternati remains at Macassar; so your friend the Captain Laut remains with my lord the Raja of Ternati. Another matter: the Raja of Buton has gone back to the mercy of God, returning whence he came, leaving the world to appear in the presence of the land of the hereafter. It is on this account that your friend the Captain Laut did not manage to go to Jakatra to show his face to the Heer Gouverneur General at\nBatavia; for such is our custom, that when a Raja dies it is as if the judgment day had come, for there is confusion in the country. That was how it was that in the opinion of your friend the Captain Laut it was best that I with the Raja of Ternati should still remain in Macassar. Pardon, a thousand pardons of my friend the Heer Gouverneur General. I have nothing as a present to Heer General but two lads, as a mere token of sincerity and friendship, just like a couple of mustard seeds; do not despise the present. For your friend the Captain Laut is an ignorant man, and has made a poor hand of composing the words of this letter, so if there is any mistake I ask pardon of the Heer Gouverneur General.

If perchance there should be any mistake or ignorance on the part of Wangsa Yita and the people that are with him, let them be treated with care and affection by Johan Maetsuijker, Governor General, and the Council of India. Again the Pang\u00e9ran Ratu begs that a few iron or brass cannon may be sold to him, of the weight of a bahar or two pikuls; as to the price of them Wangsa Yita has been informed. And may his return to Jambi be hastened, in order that the Pang\u00e9ran may quickly receive favourable news. There is no token whatever of sincerity and friendship from the Pang\u00e9ran Ratu to Johan Maetsuijker, Governor General, except twenty pikuls of pepper. Finis.\n\n(In Dutch.)

It may be that the Sultan of Birni was sending the embassy just mentioned to the native ruler of Jambi, and the Raja Bendahara took the opportunity of sending this letter at the same time to the English Captain.\n\n8.

This spelling membali for membl\u00ec appears to me to be the only internal evidence which would favour the supposition that the letter may have been written from Brunei, where the short vowel is pronounced very broad.\n9. Pijnappel and Favre give this word as gebar.\nA letter of unending friendship and unmarried pleasure, like eternal sunshine, from me the Raja Bendahara Paduka Sri Maharaja, prince in Birni (?) to the English Captain at Jambi, who is very much more intelligent than all his enemies and adversaries, and it is he who is very faithful to all his [friends and] companions, and it is he whose report is widely published in all lands, and who is very charitable to all beggars and poor people, and it is he who satisfies the needs and desires of all the unfortunate who are dependent upon him. Such a report of him has been spread throughout all lands, so that loving desire has arisen [because of] such a report. *Anna b'adu*, after that, I am sending (?) this to express the friendship of my heart to the English Captain. Now His Highness the Sultan [of Birni] is sending Sri Lela Diraja and Sri Setia Pahlawan and Sri Raja Khatib and all those who are with them to take this letter of [affection] to my lord the Governor at Jambi, so that Birni and Jambi should not be sundered for ever, for Birni [and] Jambi are as if they were one country. Now that which is desired by His Highness the Sultan, if there is love sincerity and friendship with\nmy lord the Governor, His Highness the Sultan desires to buy saltpetre, that is what His Highness the Sultan desires of my lord the Governor. Once more, if there is love and a disposition to help me with the Captain, I ask you to assist me by buying blankets, that is if the Captain has love and a willingness to help. Again, as for those ambassadors from Birni, I entrust them first of all to God, the Lord of all the universe, and the blessing of his prophet (to him be peace), and afterwards to your help and care for all of them, if they should be guilty of mistakes and stupidity. In this matter I desire your love, sincerity and affection towards me. My love for the Captain is (shown) only with (this present of) an individual and a besembong mat; pray do not despise this mark of the friendship of my heart towards the Captain.\n\nG.\u2014Extract

This spelling of tuan with ha is of considerable interest in view of the uncertainty of the derivation of tuan and Tahan. If this is not a mere slip of the pen, it would favour the supposition that the two words are of common origin, but it should be noticed that elsewhere in this extract tuan is spelt without the ha.\n\n2. See Letter E, note 5, in regard to the use of angka dua in reduplications. In this ms. it is used occasionally, but the words are more commonly spelt out in full.\n\n3. In this ms. the final nya has the dots above in almost every instance. This is one of the few exceptions.\nSOME OLD MALAY MSS.\n\n4. These two words are only different transliterations of the same Sanskrit word kshatria. The Malay translator of the Ramayana can hardly have been aware of this, or he would not have been likely to put them both in the same sentence as if they were different ranks or titles. Note that kastria is spelt sometimes with sin and sometimes with shin.\n\n5. This is exactly the Sanskrit samuha, whereas the word has now become semua or semoa, and is spelt \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0627\n\n6. Compare with this the spelling of the same word without the ba in some of the letters.\n\n7. The use of the hamza is much more common in this ms. than in letters A, B, and C., which must have been written about the same time.\n\u0627\u0648\u0631\u063a \u0628\u0631\u0627\u0631\u0642

Hata brapa lama-nya segala perdana mentri dan kastria pergi, maka bertemu dengan suatu tempat seperti kata raja itu, maka segala perdana mentri dan kastria pun kembali-lah ka-pada Maharaja Dasarata, lalu berdataq sembah ka-pada Maharaja Dasarata, \"Ya tuhan-ku, Sri Maharaja, sanda sakalian di-titahkan menchahari tempat akan negri seperti titah Sri Maharaja itu, akan sekaraig di-pertemukan dewata mulia raya tempat itu, terlalu elok tanah-nya, rata, dengan surgai-nya ayer-nya tawar, dan hawa-nya baik, dengan pasir-nya terlalu elok sakali; pada tengah tempat itu ada sa-buah bukit, terlalu elok rupa-nya, dan rata-nya, layak akan tempat istana Sri Maharaja.\"\n\n[Maka apabila Sri Maharaja] menergar kata demikian, dengan sa-kutika itu juga raja pun menyuroh memarggil segala raja-raja, lalu di-titahkan dengan segala perdana mentri dan kastria dan segala r'ayat sakalian pergi menjalani tempat itu. Dengan dua tiga hari juga sudah. Yang bukit sama tengah itu, hendak di-perbuat istana, pada tengah bukit itu ada sa-rumpun buloh betong; apabila di-tetak deri hadapan di blakang tumboh, apabila di-tetak di blakang di hadapan tumboh, apabila di-tetak deri kanan deri kiri tumboh, apabila di-tetak deri kiri deri kanan tumboh, ini-lah hal-nya. Maka segala raja-raja, dan perdana mentri kastria sakalian hairan, lalu kembali ka-pada raja. Maka di-persembahkan-nya pri hal sa-rumpun buloh betong itu. Maka titah Maharaja Dasarata, \"Jikalau surgah demikian, baik-lah sendiri aku pergi mengadapi orang menumbang buloh itu.\" Maka esok hari Maharaja Dasarata pun berlangkap lalu berjalan dengan segala anak raja-raja, dan charia, dan perdana mentri, kastria, dan segala r'ayat, seperti orang berramai-ramaian; dan segala hulubalang dan segala r'ayat hina-dina kecil besar samula-nya mengiringkan Maharaja Dasarata pergi ka-pada tempat itu hendak berbuat negri itu. Maka Dasarata Maharaja pun sampai-lah ka-sana. Maka Maharaja Dasarata membri titah menyuroh menumbang buloh betong itu; maka dengan sa-kutika itu juga di-tebang orang-lah buloh itu. Apabila di-tetak deri hadapan, di blakang tumboh; di-tetak deri kanan, deri kiri tumboh. Maka Maharaja Dasarata pun hairan melihat kekaya'an dewata mulia raya. Maka tatkala itu Maharaja Dasarata pun turun deri atas gajah ampat gading-nya; maka di-unus-nya samsir-nya, maka di-hampiri-nya rumpun\nbuloh betong, maka lalu di-tetak oleh Maharaja, dengan sa-kali tetak itu juga habis putus rumput buloh itu. Maka kelihatan dalam-nya sa'orang putri dudok di atas perasan (peratasan?) buloh itu, rupa-nya muka-nya seperti bulan purnama ampat-blas hari bulan. Maka tatkala itu Maharaja Dasarata pun mengambil kain, maka di-selemuti Putri itu, lalu di-dakap. Maka dinaiakan-nya ka'atas gajah itu, maka lalu di-bawa kembali ka'istana Maharaja Dasarata dengan suka-chita-nya, dengan segala bunyi-bunyian, seperti orang berarak akan kahwin, demikian-lah laku Maharaja Dasarata; maka lalu di-bawa masok ka-dalam maligai Maharaja Dasarata.\n\nMaka datang ka-pada hari lain, maka Maharaja Dasarata menitahkan menyuroh memanggil segala raja-raja, dan segala perdana mentri dan kastria di-titahkan berbuat perarakan sa-buah dua-blas rangkat, yang tiada berbagai perbuatannya, dan yang kecil pun ampat buah akan mengiringkan perarakan yang besar itu. Dengan demikian segala raja-raja berbuat perarakan, tiada dengan bapa hari juga sudah-lah, maka di-persembahkan oleh segala raja-raja itu ka-pada Maharaja Dasarata. Apabila datang juga perarakan itu, maka Maharaja Dasarata pun memula'i pekerja'an akan kahawin itu, ampat-puloh hari ampat-puloh malam lama-nya berjaga itu. Maka segala r'ayat hina-dina kecil-besar sa'orang pun tiada kembali ka-rumah-nya, samuhanya kena hayapan Maharaja Dasarata brapa-brapa laksa onta dan kerbau lembu, dan bebrapa laksa angsa, dan bebrapa laksa itek, dan bebrapa laksa kambing, dan segala bunyi-bunyian, gendang, serunai, nagara, merangg, nafiri, medeli. Sa-telah datang lah ka-pada ampat-puloh hari ampat-puloh malam, pada suatu hari yang baik dan kutika yang baik, maka Maharaja Dasarata pun naik-lah ka'atas perarakan dengan tuan putri yang bernama Putri Madu Dari, yang diam dalam rumput buloh betong itu. Maka Maharaja Dasarata pun berarak-lah berkling negri; beharu anam kali juga berkling, maka garitan itu pun patah; maka bebrapa budi bichara orang mengampu dia tiada juga betul garitan itu. Maka tatkala itu ada sa'orang orang perwira Maharaja Dasarata, Balis Dari nama-nya, maka ia pun turun deri atas perarakan, maka disagga-nya garitan yang patah itu; sa-telah sudah di-bangunkannya perarakan itu betul, tangan-nya pun patah. Maka pada kutika itu juga maka Maharaja Dasarata pun memanggil segala raja-raja dan perdana mentri dan hulubalang dan segala r'ayat,\nmaka titah Maharaja Dasarata, \"Hei segala orang-kaya-kaya, pada sa-kutika ini bahwa hamba dan istri hamba beroleh kemaluan, hamba ini akan gugor deri atas perarakan ini; oleh sebab Balia Dari menahankan dengan tangan-nya, maka garitan hamba ini betul, tangan-nya pun patah deri-pada sangat kebaktian-nya ka-pada hamba. Tetapi jikalau hamba ada beroleh anak laki-laki dengan dia, maka anak hamba itu jadikan raja, di-pertuan oleh tuan-tuan sakalian dalam negri ini.\" Maka [sembah] segala raja-raja, dan chatria, perdana mentri, dan segala hulubalang sakalian, \"Mana titah, patek sakalian junjong.\" Sa-telah sudah berarak, maka lalu kembali ka'istana Maharaja Dasarata dan Putri Mandu Dari. Maka tempat itu pun di-perbuat akan negri, maka di-nama'i tempat itu negri Madupura Nagara.\n\nBrapa lama-nya Maharaja Dasarata dalam negri Madupura Nagara dudok, sa'orang pun tiada beranak, maka Maharaja Dasarata pun hairan. Maka Maharaja Dasarata pun pergi ka-pada sa'orang Maharsi, Dewata nama-nya, maka Maharaja Dasarata pun minta anak pada Maharsi itu. Maka Maharsi pun membri ampat biji guliga, maka guliga itu di-ambil Maharaja Dasarata, dua biji di-brikan ka-pada istri-nya, dua biji di-brikan Balia Dari. Sudah itu, maka Maharaja Dasarata pun kembali-lah ka'istana-nya. Hata brapa bulan selang-nya, maka Mandu Dari pun bunting, Balia Dari pun bunting; datang-lah ka-pada genap bulan-nya, maka Mandu Dari pun beranak, Balia Dari pun beranak; kedua-nya anak itu laki-laki. Yang anak Mandu Dari werna tuboh-nya seperti zimrut yang hijau, maka di-nama'i oleh Maharaja Dasarata anakda beginda itu Sri Rama; yang anak Balia Dari itu di-nama'i Berdan. Brapa lama-nya sudah beranak, maka bunting pula kedua-nya; sa-telah genap bulan-nya, maka beranak-lah kedua-nya laki-laki pula. Anak Mandu Dari itu di-nama'i Maharaja Laksmana, yang anak Balia Dari itu di-nama'i Chaterdan. Sa-telah ampat orang-lah anak Maharaja Dasarata, raja yang bangsawan, ada pun anak beginda yang bernama Sri Rama itu pun be-ar-lah, terlalu maha elok rupanya, dalam 'alam dunia ini sa'orang pun tiada sa-bagai-nya, shabadan lagi perkasa dan brani; datang-lah usia-nya beginda ka-pada tujoh tahun, maka terlalu sakali nakal.\n## INDEX\n\nTO THE\n\nJOURNAL OF THE STRAITS BRANCH\n\nOF THE\n\nROYAL ASIATIC SOCIETY.\n\nVols.

G.\n\nSince its foundation in 1877, the Society has never sustained such a severe loss as that caused by the death of Sir William Maxwell, late governor of the Gold Coast.\n\nOf his distinguished official career in this colony a very brief sketch will here suffice. From 1855 to 1869, he was employed in the Supreme Court, his father, Sir P. Benson Maxwell, being Chief Justice of the Colony. In 1867 he qualified as an advocate of the local bar, and for some years was a magistrate and commissioner of the Court of Request, acting for a short time as a judge of the Supreme Court of Penang. His legal attainments were of a high order, and qualified him to take the important part he did in the work of legislation, especially with regard to the Land question, to which he devoted his great abilities.\n\nAppointed in 1874 Assistant Government Agent, Province Wellesley, he had his first opportunity of improving District administration. In the following year the Perak war took place, Mr. Maxwell serving as District commissioner with the Larut field force and being specially mentioned in despatches and receiving the Perak Medal. In 1878 he was appointed Assistant Resident, Perak, and it was during this period he gained his intimate knowledge of the Malays of the country\u2014their language and folklore. In 1881 he was called to the bar (Inner Temple), and for some years after this, as Commissioner of land titles, he devoted himself to improving the land system in the Colony. The debates in the Legislative Council of this period and Reports on the Land Question shew what a complete mastery he had of the intricacies of land administration and legislation. In spite of determined opposition, he was able to carry out his policy, the good effects of which must now be admitted by his former critics. To him is due the system of District Administration which, started first in the Colony, has been reproduced with\nsuch success in the Federated Malay States. After acting as Resident Councillor, Penang, from 1884 to 1889, Mr. Maxwell (who for his services in connection with the Niseru affair had been created a C. M. G.) was appointed in 1889 British Resident, Selangor, and in 1892 Colonial Secretary, S. S. After administering the Government here for some months, he was appointed Governor of the Gold Coast, where, after distinguished services in the Ashanti Expedition, he was made a K. C. M. G. His iron constitution was not proof against the deadly climate of the Coast, and he was cut off in the prime of life. The news of his death came as a great shock to his many friends in the Straits.\n\nDuring his long career in the Colony and in the Native States, Sir W. Maxwell enjoyed exceptional opportunities of acquiring large stores of information on subjects of special interest to the Society. Of these opportunities he readily availed himself. A facile writer, his pen was never idle, and the hours which he could snatch from his all-absorbing official duties were devoted to literary work. His first contribution to the Society's journal was a paper on Malay Proverbs, written when he was Assistant Resident of Perak, and read at a meeting of the Society in May 1878. The second number of the Journal contained a further paper on the same subject, as well as \"Notes on two Perak MSS.\" To the third number he contributed more work on Malay Proverbs, and on the Sakais and other aboriginal tribes of Perak. Soon after this, Sir W. Maxwell went home on leave; and his next contribution is to be found in the ninth number of the Society's Journal, which contains a most interesting paper, historical and geographical, entitled, \"A journey on foot to the Patani Frontier in 1876\" (67 pages), and another on the \"History of Perak from native sources.\"\n\nIn 1883 he was unanimously elected to the honorary Secretaryship of the Society, and continued to hold that office till 1887, when, owing to absence from Singapore, he asked to be relieved of the arduous duties which it involved. During this period the Society owed its existence in a great measure to the energy of its Secretary, as it received but scanty support in the way of contributions from members. Sir William contributed papers on \"The Dutch in Perak,\" on more, \"Malay Proverbs,\" and on \"Shamanism in Perak,\" and on \"The Laws and Customs\nof the Malays with reference to the Tenure of Land.\" He also edited three Malay Fairy Tales, \"Sri Rama,\" \"Raja Donan,\" and \"Raja Ambong,\" taken down by him from the lips of Malay rhapsodists, and published with a translation and with notes from his pen. In 1893 he was elected Vice President of the Society, and his official duties as Colonial Secretary from this time forward prevented his contributing to the Journal, though he continued to take the liveliest interest in the Society's work, and was able in many ways to give it material assistance.\n\nThe work he did for the Society is not, however, to be only judged by what he did under its auspices and in its name. He contributed to the Royal Asiatic Society's journal some interesting notes on Malay legends, and he wrote a Manual of the Malay Language which has done much to facilitate a scholarly acquisition of the idioms in which he took so deep an interest. He was in some measure acquainted with Arabic and Sanskrit, but will best be remembered for his work in connection with the indigenous elements of the Malay Language, its traditions and folk-lore. He collected a fine library of Malay MSS., which he has bequeathed to the Royal Asiatic Society. A great advocate of scholarly method, he did much to draw attention to the material that exists, in Dutch and other foreign languages, for the proper study of Malay. Indeed it was his view that an intending student of Malay should commence by learning Dutch; and there is no doubt that, with our limited literature on local subjects, his advice is worthy of consideration. That he was much influenced by Dutch scholars is often clearly traceable in his writings; and he had frequently to fight single-handed in defence of views which anyone acquainted with Dutch studies on the subjects would have at once admitted to be sound.\n\nIt is most difficult to exactly measure the extent of Sir William Maxwell's influence, as a scholar, upon his contemporaries and successors. He is constantly referred to by Dutch writers, and (except on one point) always with authority. His work on Malay Proverbs drew attention to the possibilities of a most interesting study, and led to the publication of at least one other valuable contribution on the same subject, from the pen of Mr. H. Clifford. His edition of Malay Rhapsodist tales also\nattracted the notice of scholars to a literature which, being unwritten, is all the more likely to perish. It is noticeable in this respect that the fourth tale alluded to by Sir W. Maxwell, but never published by him, has been placed on record by Mr. Clifford, and published by the Society. It is however by his \"Manual\" that he is likely to have exercised his widest influence, in that he introduces every learner of Malay to a scholarly appreciation of Malay style and language, when all the learner's surroundings tend to degrade that language in his eyes. In his inaugural address on the foundation of the Straits Asiatic Society, the President, speaking of Logan's Journal, remarked that the weak point in that brave attempt was that the Editor was alone responsible for the management of his Journal, and that he was forced to give up, for want of sufficient co-operation, a work which was beyond the power of a single man to sustain. Is this to be true of the work of the Straits Asiatic Society? The President expressed a hope that the work of a Society might possess more permanence than that of an individual. \"Individuals,\" said he, \"are removed, but others remain.\" Nevertheless bearing in mind the limited range of interest in the Society's work, and the difficulty of securing contributors, any one who has been familiar with the Society's history from the first must feel how much depends on one man, and how much must have fallen on Sir William Maxwell in the past. The work done has been in a great measure his own work; and although there is fortunately no need to anticipate any abandonment of the aims which he did so much to forward, it is impossible either to minimize the extent of the Society's loss, or to believe that without increased effort on the part of members it will be possible to maintain in future numbers of the Journal the standard which the late Sir William Maxwell set.\n\nC.

K.\nAn Unexplored Corner of Pahang.\n\nThe Pahang River, as most people interested in Pahang affairs know, is the great artery which serves to keep Ulu Pahang in touch with the outer world.\n\nUp it in large numbers, pass the Malay and (of late) Chinese boats, laden with supplies for the shops of Kuala Lipis, Punjom and Silensing, machinery for the mines, and from time to time those Europeans, whose business takes them into the Ulu.\n\nFrom the main stream, branch off tributaries almost as large as the parent river, to the left the Semantan, up which most of the heavy stores and machinery for the mine and town of Raub passes, and which with its tributaries taps a large belt of country, including the Bentong tin bearing district.\n\nTwo or three days farther poling and the Tembeling goes off to the right, at the Kuala of which is situated the grave of the late E. A. Wise, who was unfortunately killed in the attack on Jeram Ampai stockade. He was a young man of great promise, a favourite with both Europeans and natives, and adds one more to the list of bright young fellows who have died in foreign lands on her Majesty's Service.\n\nIt was up the Tembeling that Baron Miklucho Maklay, one of the earliest Pahang explorers, made his way over into Kelantan, and from there down the Kelantan River to Kota Bharu, the capital of Kelantan.\n\nThat gentleman, whom I had the pleasure of meeting many years ago in Queensland, devoted his life and large income to exploring, and making an ethnological collection.\n\nWhen I met him in Queensland, he was in quest of the skulls of a hairless tribe of natives, said to have been met with\nin the \"Back country,\" and he also succeeded in obtaining the skull of a notorious aboriginal outlaw, who had been recently executed. I remember he was particularly keen on this skull, as it was said to possess some abnormal measurements. An account of Baron Maklay's trip through Pahang, with copious notes on Sakei Ethnology, will be found in one of the early \"Transactions\" of the Straits Asiatic Society.\n\nFrom beyond Kuala Tembeling, the Pahang River takes the name of the Jelai. The Lipis River branches off to the left at the town of that name, and some ten miles up is the landing for the Punjom Mine, while up towards its Ulu, it divides into many separate streams, chief among which are the Wong and the Semantan Ulu, which latter is formed by the united streams of the Simpam and Siang, from the former of which Raub Mine is taking its electric power, and on the latter the Liang Coffee Concession is situated.\n\nFrom Kuala Lipis to Kuala Medang, the farthest point of European enterprise on the Jelai, is about 25 miles, and midway between Kuala Lipis and there, the Telang river comes in on the left, and is utilised by the No. 2 Concession of the M. P. Exploration Co. for getting supplies up to their property. It is only navigable for boats however, and villages are few and far between. A couple of miles farther up the Jelai, the Tanom comes in on the right, close to the residence of the Toh Rajah of Jelai. A great deal of alluvial gold working has been done in former times some distance up this river, in fact it was important enough at one time to have a \"Kapitan China,\" but no reefs have been found.\n\nKuala Medang is the landing for the Silversing mines, and the last point of European settlement on the Jelai, in fact the Europeans who have been higher up than that, can be counted on one's fingers. The Medang, from which the landing takes its name, is merely a dirty little creek that would not float a boat. Like most of these places, it has its own legend, which was told me in all seriousness by an old Malay. Questioning him as to how the place came to be named Kuala Medang, he explained that a very long time ago, when it was a flourishing Malay village, a man lived there who had a boat\nmade of Medang timber. This man was fortunate enough to kill a Dragon, of which according to him there was only a very limited supply even then. He skinned it, and nailed the skin as a sort of sheathing round his boat, which had the effect of vastly increasing its speed so that a trip to Pekan and back, which in these effete times takes about a month, used to be accomplished in 24 hours. This lasted for some time, but one night, lying at anchor, the boat sank, and could never afterwards be found. It also seems that shortly after this, a close season was proclaimed for Dragons, and no more skins could be obtained, which was unfortunate, to say the least of it.\n\nAbout half an hour's poling above Kuala Medang, the dismemberment of the Jelai begins, the Anak Jelai as it is called going off to the left, taking a S. W. course. A little farther up, the main stream divides again, the Seran going to the right or N. E., and the Telom going straight on or about due North. The Telom is much the larger stream of the three, and under ordinary conditions should still retain the name of Jelai. According to my ancient Malay friend, however, when the prehistoric geographers were naming these rivers, some little discussion arose among them as to which of the three should retain the name of Jelai, and to settle the matter they decided to weigh a given quantity of water from each, and the water from the left hand branch proving the heaviest, it retained the name. The Seran, from where it branches off to the right, keeps a pretty general N. E. bearing for a day and a half's poling, when Kuala Besi is reached. Then it divides again, the Seran keeping about its old course, while Sungei Besi bears slightly west of north, and its head waters get round very close to the head waters of the Telom. The Seran forms the highway to Kelantan and hundreds of Kelantan coolies pass up and down to work at the Silensing mines, there being a short day's tramp after leaving navigable water to get over the Dinding Range.\n\nSo far, I can only learn of three Europeans who have been over that route, and none who prior to my trip had been up Sungei Besi.\n\nFrom the junction of the Telom and Seran up to Kuala\nBesi, there are a few Malay houses at long intervals, but above that there are none whatever, the whole of it being Sakei country. There is evidence however of ancient native settlement on a large scale, as there are groves of Durian and other fruit trees, now grown to the size of the other jungle trees, where doubtless the villages originally stood. None of the Malays of the present day seem to have any idea as to who were the ancient inhabitants, or what was the cause of the exodus. It is also a noticeable fact that above Kuala Besi the names of rivers, mountains, etc., are all Sakei. The land on each side of the Seran is of much better quality than the general run of land in Pahang, and the paucity of settlements on it is remarkable.\n\nAbout 8 hours poling above Kuala Besi, and toiling along slowly in a boat, against a rather rapid current, a huge mass of what I at first took to be smoke or fog loomed up among the trees on the right bank. To my surprise on getting closer, I found it to be a huge isolated Tor of limestone, fully 400 feet high, the face of the cliff being quite perpendicular and snowy white. I then remembered that on one occasion, looking from the top of a high hill near the Silensing mine with a strong pair of glasses, we had made out a huge white mass in that direction, and many were our conjectures as to what it could be. Here was the mystery solved! About 50 feet up from the face of the cliff, I found a cave open to the front, capable of holding two to three hundred people, which is used as a camping ground by the Sakeis when out hunting, the limestone being blackened by the camp-fires of ages.\n\nThe sight of this vast natural monument, so different to the ordinary monotony of the Pahang jungle, was so absorbing, that it was long ere I could leave it. There is a similar cliff at the upstream end of the Tor, so that the view whether going up or down stream, is equally grand, and deep were my regrets that I had left my camera at home, and so could not get some photographs of it. The native name of this cliff is Gua Bumit.\n\nAbout two hours' poling above that, a small stream, called Sungei Chok, comes in on the right bank, and there navigation ceases, or at least ought to, for to take a boat farther up,\nAN UNEXPLORED CORNER OF PAHANG.\n\nis chiefly labour and sorrow, at least as far as coolies are concerned. Sungei Chok is not possible for a boat, but a day's jungle tramp (say about 20 miles) towards its Ulu, brings one to another limestone pile, of much greater dimensions. Its name is Gua Senoorat, it is from 1,500 to 2,000 feet high, and has a cave at its base capable of holding a couple of thousand people.\n\nDoubtless in the fulness of time, when Kuala Lipis becomes the seat of Government and Europeans become more plentiful in the Ulu, these huge natural monuments will be more closely examined, but it will always be a source of satisfaction to feel that I was the first European to gaze upon them. What millions of years must have elapsed and what mighty changes must geologically speaking have occurred, since those huge beds were laid down in the ocean, and then slowly eroded and dissolved by the carbonic acid of the fresh water, after the ocean retreated, leaving only these isolated pinnacles to speak of what was once a continuous bed of limestone. The decomposition of this limestone doubtless has much to say for the better quality of the land on the Seran, of which I made mention earlier.\n\nLeaving Kuala Chok, two hours poling brings one to Jeram Rimau, and though it is possible to drag an empty boat through it as I did, still future travellers would be well advised to make a camp, and leave their boat below it, and do any further travelling towards the Ulu on foot, for a short distance above the Jeram the river divides again into two streams which are both very shallow.\n\nThe right hand branch is still Sungei Besi, and the left hand one Sungei Wur, the waters of which I find almost join the head waters of the Telom, heading from opposite sides of the same spur. One day's tramp up either of these streams, brings one to the base of the main dividing range, on the other side of which is Kelantan.\n\nAfter having my boat dragged through, and my baggage carried round the Jeram, I found it impossible to take the boat farther, and so made a camp at the junction of the two streams.\n\nOn the left bank of Jeram Rimau is a mountain fully 1,000 feet high, which the natives call Bukit Guroh, and to\nwhich all sorts of legends appertain. It is chiefly a mass of huge rocks, and the Sakeis of that locality have a record of over 60 of their tribe who have been killed by tigers on it. The evening I camped there, a Sakei, who formed one of my party, went about 150 yards below the camp to fish, and while so engaged a tiger came out of the jungle at the base of the mountain and sat on a rock about 50 yards away. The Sakei abandoned his fishing lines and made for the camp yelling, and the tiger went back into the jungle. As a precautionary measure, I had a large fire built and kept going all night.\n\nNext day, leaving a couple of coolies in charge of the camp, I tramped about ten miles up Sungei Besi, and came to a large Sakei clearing on a right hand branch known as Sungei Seringat.\n\nThe whole party were away on a hunting expedition to Ulu Telom, but I learned there were ordinarily about 50 of them lived there, and we occupied their houses for the night. The only thing worthy of note to be seen in them, was a string of jawbones, with the teeth intact, of several dozen monkeys in each house, hung up in the smoke above the fireplace. There were all sizes and kinds, and it is evident the Sakei when hungry spares neither age nor sex of the monkey tribe. Every monkey they kill and eat, they add his jawbone to the string, and when they are unsuccessful in hunting it is said they derive great satisfaction from gazing at and thinking over these mementos of former repasts. They have a clearing of a good many acres at Kuala Seringat, planted with plantains and paddy, and would seem to have been there for several years.\n\nThere is said to be tin in the streams farther on, close to the base of the dividing range, which is probably the case, but neither Malays or Chinese care to venture so far by themselves, as the Sakeis are said to be wicked, while the cost of getting supplies would be great, and the area is also probably limited.\n\nFrom one of the hills at the Sakei clearing, a magnificent view was obtained of the limestone mountain, Gua Senoorat, distant about 20 miles. There would seem to be a large belt of\nnearly flat country between Sungei Besi and Sungei Seran, as this mountain stands up as it were alone. Having seen all I wished to see in that locality, I came back to my camp at Kuala Wur, and had my boats and baggage taken below the Jeram, and there stayed the night. There was a rise of several feet in the river that night, and next day we came down to Kuala Besi at racing speed, doing in six hours, what it had taken us three days to go up.\n\nI stayed the night at the house of an old Malay friend named Johor, and sitting chatting with him far into the night, he gave me the details of a tragedy which happened in his younger days, which, had a European been the chief actor, would have been cabled all over the world. Johor is now an old man, his wife is an old woman, and the two children who as infants took an unconscious part in the tragedy I speak of, are now a fine young man and woman, the son recently married and the daughter about to be, but both Johor and his wife still carry on their bodies the marks of the affray of which I speak. It took place some 20 odd years ago, and Johor, his wife and two young children were at that time living at Kuala Seran, i.e., where the Telom and Seran, as I before explained, divide, and go in separate directions.\n\nIt was just after the Perak war, and one day, Johor was sitting in his house preparing a quid of betel, his wife plaiting a mat, and his two children sitting on the floor playing. Simultaneously two men appeared armed with spear and kris, one at the front and one at the back door. The one at the back door remained on the ground, while the one in front, mounted the three or four ladder-like steps into the house and made a vicious stab at Johor with his spear, which he in the act of rising managed to ward off. Failing in this the stranger reversed the spear, and dealt him a smashing blow across the head, with the heavy petaling wood handle. Half blinded by the blood which poured down over his face Johor seized the spear, and a desperate struggle ensued. Finding he could not wrench it away, the stranger drew his kris and tried to stab him, but he warded off the stabs as best he could with his arms, at the same time with his feet pushing the children away out of danger.\nHis wife attempting to assist him, seized the blade of the kris, and she showed me the two fingers, minus the tops, where it was dragged through her hands. Johor has the mark where his scalp was laid open by the blow from the spear, while his arms are scored with the marks of the cuts he received in warding off the stabs. Suddenly he bethought him of the Tumbuh Lada (small dagger) in his belt, and drawing it he thrust it into the bowels of his assailant, who fell dying. All this though it takes some time to write, took place very quickly, and the man at the back door, who had been simply gazing at the struggle, on seeing his friend fall, rushed in. Johor seized his gun, which was standing loaded against the wall, but before he could get it up to fire, the stranger seized the muzzle, and a fierce struggle ensued for the possession of it. With a quick snatch however, Johor succeeded in dragging it from him, and shot him through the stomach, and killed him also. \"Allah Tuan,\" said Johor, \"Habis t'lahi rumah saya, macham orang potong kribau\".\n\nAsking him why this attack was made on him, he explained that these men were relatives of one of the Perak Rajahs, who had taken an active part in the war there, and were fleeing from the wrath to come, to Kelantan. They had crossed over from Perak, and made their way down the Telom, and being hard up, and hearing that Johor owned a couple of guns, they made up their minds to kill him, steal his guns and boat, and take his wife and children to sell for slaves in Kelantan. The next day, coming down to Kuala Medang, I was shown the place when the house originally stood, in which this affair took place.\n\nW. Bertrand Roberts.\nBirds collected and observed on the Larut Hills, Perak, in March and April 1898.\n\nIt was with the greatest pleasure that I found myself able to devote the months of February and March this year (1898) to forming a collection of birds on the Larut Hills in Perak. I believe that Mr. L. Wray, Jr., and Dr. Hartert for a few days in 1888, are the only other ornithologists who have collected on these mountains. Mr. Wray was fortunate in being the first man on the ground, and he made the most of his opportunities, obtaining, apparently, all the then new species which are at all common on the hills, and several which must be distinctly rare, as I failed to procure a single specimen of some of them in two months energetic collecting. The ornithological results of Mr. Wray's very successful collecting expeditions in the mountains were described by Dr. R. Bowdler Sharpe in two papers in the P. Z. S. for 1887 and 1888, which have been reprinted in the Journal of this Society (No. 19, p. 125., and No. 21, p. 1.)\n\nThese two papers deal with collections made on the Larut Hills and on the Batang Padang Mountains. For practical purposes they may both be taken as dealing with the birds of the Larut Hills, the avifauna of the higher mountains, as far as is yet known, not differing appreciably from that of the lower range. In fact, all the novelties yet obtained in the mountains of the Malay Peninsula occur at 3,000 to 5,000 feet altitude. As yet no single species has been discovered with a habitat restricted to the higher elevations of 6,000 or 7,000 feet, though it is quite possible that some such forms may exist.\n\nNinety-five species are enumerated in these two papers, which do not include birds not actually obtained. My list is longer, containing 113 species, as I have included all birds seen and identified as well as those shot. Mr. Wray's lists contain a number of species which I did not come across, while mine contains several which are not to be found in Mr. Wray's. The obvious inference to be drawn from this is that there are pro-\nbably yet a number of species on the hills which neither of us met with and that our united lists are by no means complete. Some more novelties are sure to be obtained in time on these mountains; the small and inconspicuous species especially are likely to repay attention.\n\nI am much indebted to Mr. J. P. Rodger, British Resident, Selangor, for assistance kindly afforded me while he was acting as Resident of Perak. In giving me permission to collect for scientific purposes Mr. Rodger requested me to restrict myself to four specimens of a species. It will be seen that on the whole I contented myself with considerably less.\n\nI have also to thank Mr. L. Wray, Jr., for much information about the birds of the hills, and for the kindness with which he was always ready to go over his own collections with me when I was in Taipeng.\n\nI hope shortly to publish elsewhere a more complete paper on the birds at present known to occur on the mountains of the Peninsula; in the mean time, I give a list of the species I met with during my two months on Maxwell's Hill. The brief notes as to elevation, etc., after each species must not be taken as hard and fast rules, but only as my individual experience of the bird's habitat, given for comparison with the notes of other observers. In this list I have arranged the species according to the classification in Messrs. Oates' and Blanford's \"Bird\" volumes in the Fauna of India Series, inserting those species not in the Indian list in what seemed to me their proper places. I have not, as is usually done, inserted the names of Families and Sub-families in large print between each few species, as in most cases it seems to me unnecessary waste of space.\n\nThe identifications in this list are, I believe, absolutely reliable. A numeral in brackets following the note on a species denotes the number of specimens I obtained. In all cases where such a number follows, the birds have been worked out by no less an authority than Dr. Ernst Hartert, of Tring Museum. The remaining species are identified by myself, but they are all birds with which I was previously, or have since become, familiar, and I am confident of the correctness of the names given. In some cases where species have been split up into recognized\nsub-species the trinomials are there used for the sake of accuracy.\n\nThree species new to science are included in this list, and their descriptions quoted; other birds are recorded from the mountains of the Peninsula for the first time.\n\nGlancing through the list one is struck by the fact that over ninety genera are represented by the 113 species given.\n\nThe whole of the birds that I obtained are now in the Hon'ble. Walter Rothschild's magnificent collection at Tring.\n\n1. *Rhinocichla mitrata* (S. M\u00fcll).\n   Very common above 3500 feet, feeding in noisy parties. (3)\n\n2. *Trochalopterum peninsulae*. Sharpe.\n   Wray's Laughing Thrush. Only one obtained between The Hut and The Cottage, 4000 feet. (1)\n\n3. *Pomatorhinus wrayi*. Sharpe.\n   Wray's Scimitar Babbler. Common at about 4000 feet generally in parties, which like others of the genus keep up a loud liquid call note. A very skulking bird, and not easy to procure. I failed to find the only one I shot.\n\n4. *Gampsorhynchus saturator*. Sharpe.\n   The Perak Ring-necked Shrike-babbler. Sharpe described this species from a specimen obtained by Mr. L. Wray on Gunong Batu Puteh, but Mr. Blanford does not consider it entitled to specific distinction (*Fauna of India*, Birds, I. p. 137). Hence I was particularly anxious to obtain specimens for comparison; but though I saw what must have been this bird once at 3500 feet, I failed to shoot it.\n\n5. *Corythocichla lencosticta*. Sharpe.\n   Wray's Spotted Babbler. Not uncommon above 3000 feet; met with in small foraging parties hopping about on or near the ground among rocks and undergrowth. (3)\n6. *Turdinus abbotti olivaceus.* (Strickl.)\n\nAbbot's Babbler. Not uncommon in thickets near the foot of the hills. Dr. Sharpe identified a *Turdinus* sent by Mr. Wray from these hills as *sepiarius*. Mine was certainly the same as the bird Mr. Wray has marked *sepiarius*, but Dr. Hartert assures me it is the pale sub-species (*olivaceus*) of *Turdinus abbotti*. (1)\n\n7. *Alcippe peracensis.* Sharpe.\n\nWray's Black-browed Babbler. Very common at 3000 feet and upwards. (3)\n\n8. *Alcippe cinerea.* (Blyth.)\n\nGrey-headed Babbler. Equally common below 3000 feet. (3)\n\n9. *Stachyris davisoni.* (Sharpe.)\n\nDavison's Babbler. One shot at 2000 feet. (1)\n\n10. *Stachyris poliocephala.* (Temm.)\n\nOne shot near the foot of the hills. A pair noticed collecting nest material in April. (1)\n\n11. *Stachyridopsis chrysea.*\n\nDr. Hartert says, \"A sub-species, duller than Himalayan specimens. Either *St. chrysea assimilis* or *bocagei*.\"\n\nFairly common above 3500 feet, feeding in little flocks which flutter about the undergrowth at the edge of a path quite regardless of being observed. So tame is it that I thought I should never get far enough away from one to shoot it, and did rather damage the one I shot; the other I actually knocked down with the barrel of the gun. I contented myself with a pair. (2)\n\n12. *Mixornis gulatrix.* (Raffles.)\n\nThe Sumatran Yellow-breasted Babbler. I shot one at 2000 feet, but it was too damaged to preserve.\n\n13. *Myiophonus eugenii.* (Hume.)\n\nThe Burmese Whistling Thrush. Rather rare. I met with\nit twice, on rocky streams in the ravines, but failed to get a specimen.\n\n14. *Larvivora cyanea.* (Pall.)\n\nSiberian Blue Chat. I saw this species once only\u2014in April. It was hopping about the undergrowth too close to shoot, and as I backed away it disappeared into the jungle. Recently I came on this species again, on the summit of Bukit Kuntu in Selangor, and at once recognized it as the bird I failed to get on the Perak hills. This time I succeeded in shooting it. This is one of the neatest looking little birds I know, the dark blue of the upper plumage contrasting admirably with the delicate white of the breast. 4500 feet.\n\n15. *Brachypteryx nipalensis.* (Hodgs.)\n\nHodgson's Short-wing. I came on a *Brachypteryx* of sorts once at 4,000 feet. It showed a good deal of curiosity, fluttering nearer as I retreated and keeping too close to shoot. Not caring to blow it to pieces I left it alone. It was probably the above species, which Mr. Wray obtained on these hills.\n\n16. *Sibia similima.* (Salvad.)\n\nThe Malay Sibia. Very common above 3,500 feet, below which I never once saw it.\n\nFeeds in parties, running along the branches, etc. with great rapidity and keeping up an incessant \"kree-kree-kree.\" While I was picking up a wounded one which I shot, the rest of the flock fluttered round me and abused me lustily\u2014which perhaps I deserved. (3)\n\n17. *Siva sordidior.* (Sharpe.)\n\nThe Malay Dull Siva. Met with in small parties searching for insects among the foliage of trees, and not descending into the undergrowth. I only met with it at about 4,000 feet. (4)\n\n18. *Herpornis xanthoceuca.* (Hodgs.)\n\nThe White-bellied Herpornis. Goes in good sized flocks, which search the branches of trees for insect food. It often\nclings to the outside twigs of a bough in all sorts of tit-like attitudes. Not uncommon. (1)\n\n19. *Pteruthius aeratus*. (Tick.)\n\nTickell's Shrike-tit. I met with this handsome little bird several times at about 4,000 feet, always in pairs and quietly searching the branches of tall trees for insects. (2)\n\n20. *Chloropsis icterocephala*.\n\nThe Malayan Green Bulbul. Met with up to 3,000 feet, one of the most handsome of the genus. (1)\n\n21. *Irena cyanea*. (Begbie).\n\nThe Malayan Fairy Blue-bird. This lovely species is tolerably numerous on the hills up to 3,000 feet. (1)\n\n22. *Melanochlora sultanea*. (Hodgs.)\n\nThe Sultan Tit. Common. Mr. Wray notes having seen it as high as 4,500 feet. (4)\n\n23. *Mesia argentauris*. (Hodgs.)\n\nThe Silver-eared Mesia. Not uncommon at 3,500-4,500 feet. (2)\n\n24. *Criniger gutturalis*. (Bonap.)\n\nThe Malayan white throated Bulbul. Met with from 2,000 to 3,500 feet in pairs or parties. (2)\n\n25. *Tricholestes criniger*. (Blyth.)\n\nThe Hairy-backed Bulbul. Fairly common up to 3,000 feet. (2)\n\n26. *Hemirhus cinereus*. (Blyth.)\n\nWhite-throated Grey Bulbul. Common from 2,000 to 4,000 feet, but not so numerous as on Bukit Kutu where it is extremely plentiful. (2)\n\n27. *Otocompsa flaviventris*. (Tick.)\n\nBlack-crested Yellow Bulbul. Not uncommon at 2,000 feet\nor so, but far from numerous. (1)\n\n28. *Iole tickelli peracensis.* (Hartert and Butler.)\n\nA sub species of *I. tickelli tickelli*, differing in the darker and less rufous brown crown, more dingy grey ear coverts, and more ashy breast and flanks. Common from 3,500 feet upwards. (3)\n\n29. *Iole olivacea.* (Blyth.)\n\nThe Malay Olive Bulbul. Common up to 2,000 feet. (3)\n\n30. *Pycnonotus finlaysoni.* (Strickl.)\n\nFinlayson's Stripe-throated Bulbul. Two or three pairs of this Bulbul used to frequent the bushes in the bottom of the ravine in front of the Tea Garden Bungalow, 2,000 feet. (1)\n\n31. *Pycnonotus cyaniventris.* (Blyth.)\n\nThe Blue-bellied Bulbul. Not very plentiful. Obtained at 2,000 feet. (1)\n\n32. *Pycnonotus salvadorii.* (Sharpe.)\n\nThe Small Olive Bulbul. Shot at 2,000 feet. The orange yellow eyelid and base of bill so conspicuous in freshly shot birds fades almost at once in skins. (1)\n\n33. *Pycnonotus simplex.* (Less.)\n\nMoore's Olive Bulbul. Common up to 2,000 feet. (3)\n\n34. *Dendrophila azurea.* (Less.)\n\nThe Azure Nuthatch. Met with occasionally in small parties working about on the trunks of large trees. Sharpe remarks of a single specimen sent him by Mr. Wray that it was duller blue on the back than Javan examples. I particularly wanted specimens for comparison, but was unlucky in losing two out of the three I shot. The one I did get however quite bore out Sharpe's remarks, and the bird is probably entitled to sub-specific distinction. (1)\n\n35. *Bhringa remifer.* (Temm.)\n\nThe Lesser Racket-tailed Drongo. Common at a high\nelevation. I did not notice it below 3,000 feet. (I)\n\n36. Orthotomus atrigularis. (Temm.)\n\nBlack-necked Tailor Bird. A few small tailor-birds which frequented the clearing round the Tea Garden bungalow were, I think, of this species. I somehow omitted to shoot a specimen.\n\n37. Cisticola bearani. (Wald.)\n\nNumerous in the Tea Garden clearing, frequenting the weeds and bushes near the jungle edge. Dr. Hartert tells me that they are paler and less rufescent than any of the Indian specimens with which they have been compared. I regret that I did not shoot a few more. (2)\n\n38. Cryptolopha butleri. (Hartert.)\n\nButler's Flycatcher Warbler. A new species. For the benefit of local readers I quote the description from the Bulletin of the British Ornithologist's Club, No. LIV, p. 50. Adult male, Crown of the head dark rufous with a broad deep brown lateral stripe; sides of the head and back ashy grey; lower back, rump, scapulars, smaller upper wing-coverts, edges to the primaries and retrices yellowish green; larger upper wing-coverts blackish, with a greenish wash and greenish yellow tips; throat and fore-neck to the chest pale grey; middle of the abdomen white; sides of body, under wing-coverts, axillaries, vent, and under tail-coverts lemon-yellow. Iris reddish brown; bill dusky, mandible yellowish fleshy; feet brownish yellow.\n\nWing 51-54 m.m., tail 42\u201445, bill 6. 5\u20147, tarsus 16-16.5. Nearest to C. castaneiceps, but easily distinguished by its darker crown and grey back besides other differences. I found this little bird not uncommon at 4,000 feet and saw it as low as 3,000 feet. I found 3 nests during April; they were very like nests of the common European Wren, placed under overhanging banks, two containing three young each and the other a clutch of 3 fresh eggs, of the usual Cryptolopha type\u2014pure white. (2).\n\n39. Phyllergates cucullatus. (Temm.)\n\nGolden-headed Warbler. Not uncommon above 4,000 feet,\nfrequenting the sides of the path, the garden round The Cottage, etc. Exactly like a Tailor-bird, in appearance and habits, though differing in several important generic characteristics. The discovery of its nest would be of great interest. Oates suggests that this genus may nest in holes of trees, like Abrornis. The bird seemed to me so very tailor-bird-like in its habits that I should hardly expect it myself to differ very much in nidification. (2).\n\n40. *Sutoria maculicauda*. (Moore.)\n\n2,000 to 3,000 feet. Not common. I found a nest, a typical tailor-bird's, sewn between two leaves, and containing one egg of the Tailor-bird type. I cannot give a description, as on my revisiting the nest next day I found it empty. This was in April. (1)\n\n41. *Lanius tigrinus*. (Drap.)\n\nThe Thick-billed shrike. Met with half-a-dozen times up to 3,500 feet, mostly immature specimens. 1\n\n42. *Tephrodornis gularis*. (Raffles.)\n\nMalay Wood Shrike. Only shot it once at 3,000 feet, but probably overlooked it on other occasions, owing to the difficulty of identifying birds feeding high overhead in lofty trees. (1)\n\n43. *Pericrocotus wrayi*. (Sharpe.)\n\nWray's Minivet. Replaces the next species at about 3,500 feet, above which it is fairly common. 2\n\n44. *Pericrocotus speciosus fraterculus*. (Swinhoe.)\n\nThe Burmese Scarlet Minivet. Obtained from 1,500 feet to 3,000 or 3,500, where it gives place to the last form. 2\n\n45. *Pericrocotus flammifer*. (Hume.)\n\nDavison's Scarlet Minivet. I shot a male at just over two thousand feet; it was very badly shot and I did not preserve it, expecting to get others.\n\n46. *Pericrocotus igneus*. (Blyth.)\n\nThe Fiery Minivet. I shot a female Minivet at 4,000 feet\nwith a red rump. It was unfortunately too damaged for preservation. I think it must have been igneus. Sharpe's Pericrocotus croceus I looked for in vain.\n\n47. Graucalus larutensis. (Sharpe.)\n\nThe Larut Cuckoo Shrike. Not uncommon above the Maxwell's bungalow clearing, but I only shot one, fortunately a female, which has not been described previously, Sharpe having only seen the male (1)\n\n48. Hemichelidon sibiricus. (Gm.)\n\nSooty Flycatcher. A very common winter visitor. A few were still about at the beginning of April. (2)\n\n49. Hemichelidon ferrugineus. (Hodgs.)\n\nFerruginous Flycatcher. Not uncommon between 1,500 and 3,500 feet. I did not notice it higher. (1).\n\n50. Cyornis tickelli. (Blyth.)\n\nTickell's Blue Flycatcher. I saw this species once at 4,000 feet. I have since obtained it at 3,000 feet on Bukit Kuto. Malayan specimens are smaller than Indian ones.\n\n51. Nitudula hodgsoni. (Moore.)\n\nThe Pigmy Blue Flycatcher. I obtained one at 4,500 feet. Oates says he cannot find a single note on its habits. This specimen was moving about in a big bunch of a parasitic plant growing upon a thick bough; once or twice it fluttered out and captured a small insect in true flycatcher style, and once I saw it hover for a second or two something like a Honeysucker. I believe this is the first time it has been obtained in this locality. Oates gives its distribution as Sikkim, Assam and the Naga hills. (1.)\n\n52. Muscicapula westermanni. (Sharpe.)\n\nThe Malay Little Pied Flycatcher. Not uncommon at 4,000 feet. (1)\n\n53. Digenea malayana. Sharpe.\n\nThe Malay White Gorgeted Flycatcher. I obtained two\nspecimens at 4,000 feet. While engaged in setting a steel trap baited with grains of rice, meant for any small mammal which might get caught, I saw two of these little flycatchers hopping about the ground and the low undergrowth, and uttering a sharp little squeak. I shot one and the other flew off. Two hours later, however, I found it in the trap I had just set, doubtless attracted by the freshly turned earth and dead leaves I had sprinkled over the plate. I did not meet with the species again. Very close to *D. submoniliger*. (2.)\n\n54. *Alseonax latirostris.* (Raffles.)\nThe Brown Flycatcher. Winter visitor; fairly common. (1.)\n\n55. *Culicicapa ceylonensis.* (Swainson.)\nGrey-headed Flycatcher. Common above 2,000 feet.\n\n56. *Niltava grandis.* (Hodgs.)\nThe Large Niltava. Not uncommon below the Cottage, at about 4,000 feet. Has a good song. Smaller than Indian examples. (2.)\n\n57. *Terpsiphone affinis.* (Hay.)\nThe Burmese Paradise Flycatcher. I saw adult white males two or three times between 2,000 and 3,000 feet, but failed to get a specimen.\n\n58. *Rhipidura albicollis.* (Vieill.)\nWhite-throated Fantail Flycatcher. Almost always among the parties of birds which one comes upon at about 4,000 feet. White tips to retrices broader than in Indian examples. Bornean ones again are like Indian. (1.)\n\n59. *Henicurus schistaceus.* (Hodgs.)\nThe Slaty Forktail. A snap shot in the dusk at an unfamiliar Forktail darting up a stream luckily resulted in a specimen of this species. This was at 2,000 feet, and the only time I met with it. New to the Larut Hill list. 1\n\n60. *Hydrocichla ruficapilla.* (Temm.)\nThe Chestnut-headed Forktail. Occurs up to 4,000 feet,\nfrequenting the streams which filter through the dark ravines. When these are in spate after a downpour of rain, the Forktails come out on to the roads. As a rule this is a very shy bird, but some individuals are extremely tame. I found a nest in a cleft of a moss-grown rock by the edge of the path. It was composed very largely of earth, thickly covered with green moss and was consequently remarkably heavy for its size. It contained two longish cream white eggs, very glossy, and spotted with rufous. (2.)\n\n61. *Copsychus saularis*, (Linn.)\nThe Magpie Robin. A few pairs round the Tea Garden and Maxwell's bungalow.\n\n62. *Geocichla innotata*. (Blyth.)\nThe Malay Ground Thrush. A blue-grey *Geocichla* with an orange breast flew past me once in thick jungle at 2,000 feet; it is almost certain to have been this species.\n\n63. *Monticola gularis*.\nI obtained one specimen\u2014an immature male\u2014of this very rare little Thrush in thick jungle at about 2,500 feet. (1.)\n\n64. *Monticola cyanus solitaria*. (P. L. Mull.)\nThe Eastern Blue Rock Thrush. I noticed a blue Rock Thrush frequenting the rocks, fallen trees, etc., on the Tea Garden clearing; it was very shy and eluded pursuit for some days. When obtained it proved to be this species. Elevation 2,000 feet. (1.)\n\n65. *Uroloncha acuticauda*. (Hodgs.)\nHodgson's Munia. Fairly plentiful about the Tea Garden clearing. They were breeding in April, and I found several of their well known nests.\n\n66. *Hirundo gutturalis*. (Scop.)\nThe Eastern House Swallow. Numerous round the bungalows on the hill.\nBIRDS OF THE LARUT HILLS.\n\n67. *Motacilla melanope.* (Pall.)\nThe Grey Wagtail. Common about roads, streams, clearings, etc., at all elevations. Had not left by middle of April.\n\n68. *Anthus rufulus malayensis.*\nThe Malay Pipit. Should not perhaps be included in this list. I mention it as there was one specimen in my collection, but it was shot at the foot of the hills and not on them. (1.)\n\n69. *Anthus maculatus.* (Hodgs.)\nThe Indian Tree Pipit. The only Pipit met with on the hills. A party of a dozen or so frequented the Maxwell's bungalow clearing throughout March and beginning of April. I never saw them settle on a tree when disturbed. Probably their habits are more arboreal in the breeding season than at other times. (1.)\n\n70. *Aethopyga wrayi.* (Sharpe.)\nWray's Honeysucker. These beautiful little birds are common at 3,500 feet and upwards. The Scarlet Hibiscus flowers in the gardens on the hill are a great attraction to them. They visit these principally in the hottest part of the day\u2014for an hour or two after noon. I may mention that I recently obtained the bird again on the summit of Bukit Kutu, Selangor, 3,300 feet. It has, I believe, hitherto only been obtained on the Perak hills. It will probably prove to occur throughout the Peninsula where the mountains rise to over 3,000 feet. Mr. Wray, writing to Dr. Sharpe says, \"There is another species of Honeysucker, but I was not able to get a specimen of it.\" I kept a sharp look out for this, but saw no other species on these hills. Since then, however, I have twice shot, on Bukit Kutu and at Ginting Bedei, a lovely scarlet Honeysucker with brilliant violet moustachial stripes, and a sort of coronet of the same colour, formed by two lines running from the nostrils and encircling the crown. From want of books of reference I have had to send it home for identification, and have not yet heard about it. Possibly this was the other Honeysucker seen by Mr. Wray. (5.)\n\n71. *Arachnothera magna.* (Hodgs.)\nCommon between 3,500 and 4,000 feet; I saw one or two as\nlow as 2,000 feet. A very active restless bird, always on the move. Constantly in the jungle something darts past one with a whirr, and only its characteristic sharp squeak enables one to recognize the spider-hunter. (4.)\n\n72. *Dic\u00e6um ignipectus.* (Hodgs.)\n\nFire-breasted Flowerpecker. I shot one at 4,000 feet. Probably common, but it is impossible to identify these tiny birds with certainty on tall trees. (1.)\n\n73. *Prionochilus ignicapillus.* (Eyt.)\n\nCrimson-breasted Flowerpecker. Fairly common up to 4000 feet. (1.)\n\n74. *Prionochilus maculatus.* (Temm.)\n\nThe White throated Flowerpecker. Met with on the higher parts of the hill. (1.)\n\n75. *Serilophus rothschildi.* (Hartert and Butler.)\n\nRothschild's Broadbill. The discovery of this very beautiful little broadbill\u2014the third known species of its genus\u2014made a red-letter day for a collector. I first came across it at 2,500 feet. Two little grey-breasted birds were sitting side by side on a tall tree and, not being able to make them out I fired at them and killed both. The birds fell into a dense tangle of thorny rattan, and at the end of half-an-hour's search I was just giving up in disgust when I found one of them. Seeing at a glance that it was a novelty and a very beautiful one, I renewed my search, cutting away the abominably thorny shoots of the rattan one by one with my hunting knife, and eventually succeeded in finding the other. I subsequently came upon a party of these broadbills at 3,500 feet. They were engaged in quietly searching the foliage of a large-leaved tree for insects, and every now and then uttering a clear little whistle like \"pee-u.\" Once or twice I saw one hover at the extremity of a bough to catch an insect on the outermost leaves, something after the manner of a *Pericorrotus*. On the whole their actions struck me as rather sluggish. I quote the description of this new species from the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club, No. LIV.\np.50. \"Differs from S. lunatus with which it agrees in the peculiarly shaped tips of the longest primaries, in being darker and greyer above; crown of the head pure grey, not pale rusty brown; ear-coverts grey with hardly a tint of brown, while they are pale brown in S. lunatus, and the rufous colour on the secondaries is deeper; round the eye a narrow ring of white feathers. Iris greenish brown, mottled with golden specks; eyelid and base of mandible for about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) inch, bright gamboge yellow; bill pale whitish blue, tip and lateral edges whitish; feet pale greenish chrome, claws milky blue\" (A. L. Butler)\" Named in compliment to Mr. Walter Rothschild (3.)\n\n76. Psarisomus dalhousiae. (Jameson.)\n\nThe Longtailed Broadbill.\n\nMr. H. Palgrave Turner shot one of these lovely broadbills at 3500 feet, and kindly gave it to me. It is a very perfect specimen and is now in the Selangor Museum. (1.)\n\n77. Gecinus rodgeri. Hartert and Butler.\n\nRodger's Woodpecker.\n\nA new species obtained at 3,500 feet. I am not sure whether the full description has yet appeared in print; it has not yet reached me, and I do not wish to anticipate it. Dr. Hartert, comparing it with G. chlorolophus and G. chlorigaster says, in epist. \"Differs from chlorolophus in its much darker and more uniform green upperside, shorter wing, and darker abdomen with much narrower cross-bars. Differs from chlorigaster in its larger size, longer wing, and in the middle of the crown being green and not red.\" Named in honour of Mr. J. P. Rodger, British Resident, Selangor. (1.)\n\n78. Chrysophlegma humii. (Hargitt.)\n\nThe Chequered-throated Woodpecker.\n\nI shot one at 3,500 feet. I have also met with it in the low country. (1.)\n\n79. Miglyptes grammithorax. (Malb.)\n\nThe Fulvous-rumped Barred Woodpecker.\nLess common than *M. tukki* on the hills. I saw it once at 3,000 feet.\n\n80. *Miglyptes tukki.* (Lesson.)\nThe Buff-necked Barred Woodpecker.\nCommon from 2000 to 4000 feet; generally in pairs, but sometimes in small parties of 5 or 6. The note is a long trill. (4.)\n\n81. *Chrysocolaptes validus.* (Temm.)\nGolden backed Bar-winged Woodpecker.\nChiefly a low country form; I saw one pair at 2000 feet and obtained one specimen. (1.)\n\n82. *Vivia innominata.* (Burton.)\nThe Speckled Piculet.\nThis diminutive Woodpecker is apparently scarce, though its small size doubtless causes it to be overlooked. My specimen was shot at 4,000 feet, associating with a large foraging party of various small birds. It was swinging on a trailing liana-like creeper, across which it had perched, and might almost have been mistaken for some sort of Flower-pecker. (1.)\n\n83. *Psilopogon pyrolophus.* (S. M\u00fcll.)\nThe Bar-billed Barbet.\nI found this very beautiful barbet from 3,000 to nearly 5000 feet. Mr. Wray says it is a very silent bird, only occasionally uttering a harsh note like that of a Woodpecker. I never heard it utter any note that I can remember, which bears out what Mr. Wray says as to its being usually so silent, but Hartert has described its note very differently. (J. f. O. 1889.) (3)\n\n84. *Mesobucco duvauceli.* (Lesson.)\nThe Crimson-eared Barbet. Very common, from the low country up to 4000 feet. This is one of the most annoying birds I know to try and shoot. It ensconces itself among the foliage at the very top of a very high tree, often, in the low country, a durian, and there keeps up for hours together, an in-\ncessant \"twit-twit, twit-twit!\" very like the note of an English nuthatch. Owing to its turning its head from side to side while calling, these monotonous notes seem to come from a different direction every minute, and even when one has succeeded in locating the bird more or less exactly it is impossible to see it owing to its small size, leaf-green colour, and its habit of keeping absolutely motionless (except for turning its head about) as long as it is calling. You may clap your hands, shout and throw stones into the tree as much as you like, but you won't get it to move, much less take wing and give a flying shot. If two of you are shooting together, however, things are simplified considerably. You put the other gun on the far side of the tree and fire three or four shots at hazard into the top of it. Then at last the little barbet elects to move, and the other man gets a very high snap shot at a diminutive bird flying very jerkily away, which he may hit, but is much more likely not to!\n\nAll four birds I have obtained thus have been males. (2.)\n\n85. *Cyanops oorti.* (S. M\u00fcll.)\nCommon: my specimens were obtained from 2,500 to 4,000 feet. (4.)\n\n86. *Chotorhea chrysopogon.* (Temm.)\nGold Whiskered Barbet. Common: from the foot of the hills to over 3000 feet. (3.)\n\n87. *Calorhamphus hayi.* (Gray.)\nThe Brown Barbet. Fairly common. Low country and up to 3500 feet; generally in parties; rather sluggish in its movements. (4.)\n\n88. *Merops sumatranus,* Raffles.\nThe Sumatran Bee-eater.\nFlocks of this Bee-eater were met with up to 2000 feet (1.)\n\n89. *Nyctornis amictus,* (Temm.)\nThe Red-bearded Bee-eater.\nTolerably common, from the low country up to 4500 feet. Blanford and other authorities say \"nidification unknown,\" but I find in No. 24 of this Journal, p. 169, a nest and eggs described by Lieut. H. J. Kelsall, which are doubtless rightly attributed to this species. I have several times found nest-holes in banks in heavy forest which could only have been those of this bird, though I never found one in use to settle the question. The note of this bird is extraordinary, a very hoarse and loud \"ka-ka! ka-ka!\", which, until I found out the author of it, I thought must come from some sort of hornbill at least! (2)\n\n90. *Dichoceros bicornis.* (Linn.)\nThe Great Hornbill.\n\nI met with this grand Hornbill several times near the top of the Hill, but it was considerably scarcer than the next species.\n\n91. *Buceros rhinoceros.* (Linn.)\nThe Rhinoceros Hornbill.\n\nThe commonest large Hornbill on the hills, where their extraordinarily loud and discordant notes may be heard throughout the day at intervals. (3)\n\n92. *Anorrhinus galeritus* (Temm.)\nThe Bushy-Crested Hornbill.\n\nNot uncommon at 2000 feet and upwards. I have also met with it at Ginting Bedei and Bukit Kulu in Selangor, but not yet at less than 2000 feet elevation. This Hornbill is almost always in small flocks, which keep up a curious shrill call at intervals. It always reminded me forcibly of the chorus raised by a litter of hungry puppies whose mother has tantalized them by paying them a short visit and leaving them again! I found them shy and difficult to shoot, making off by short flights from tree to tree directly they were approached. Their habits seemed to me very regular, a flock visiting a particular tree just at noon for several days, until the fruit supply was exhausted. (2)\n\n93. *Rhinoplax vigil.* (Forster.)\nThe Helmeted Hornbill.\nThis magnificent Hornbill, though constantly heard, seems very shy, and though I saw a pair once or twice I failed to get a specimen. Davison has described its note excellently. He says, \"The note is very peculiar and powerful; it begins with a series of whoops, uttered at intervals that grow gradually less till, after ten or a dozen quick repetitions the call ends in a harsh cackling laugh.\" This account would be hard to improve on. The first notes sound not unlike the distant blow of an axe on timber, and it is doubtless this species that is referred to in the Malay legend of the man who cut down his unfortunate mother-in-law's house and then burst into a peal of laughter, for which he was punished by being turned into a bird. The use of the heavy ivory casque of this hornbill remains to be discovered.\n\n94. *Chaetura gigantea.* (Temm.)\n   The Brown-necked Spine-tail Swift.\n   Often seen hawking over the hills.\n\n95. *Chaetura leucopygialis.* (Blyth.)\n   The Grey-rumped Spine-tail. Very common up to 3000 feet or so; I forget whether I observed it higher. It has none of the arrow-like speed of the larger Spine-tails. (2.)\n\n96. *Collocalia francica.* (Gmel.)\n   The Little Grey-rumped Swiftlet.\n   Common at the higher elevations.\n\n97. *Collocalia linchi.* (Horsf. and M.)\n   Horsfield's Swiftlet. The same applies. This charming little swift is very fond of building in rooms, etc. A pair did their best to start a nest in the Tea Garden bungalow when I was there. They never succeeded in getting anything to stick to the white paint of the ceiling, but carried on the attempt perseveringly for a long time. In the Andamans, where this species is numerous, I have seen it roosting in buildings, clinging to the walls in clusters like a swarm of bees. On these occasions I have often seen one catch its mate, unable to find room\nfor a foothold beside it, by the tip of the wingfeathers and hold it hanging thus for several seconds. (2.)\n\n98. *Macropteryx longipennis* (Rafinesque.)\nThe Malayan Crested Swift. I occasionally noticed it hawking over the tops of the jungle up to nearly 5,000 feet.\n\n99. *Macropteryx comata*. (Blyth.)\nThe Tufted Tree-Swift. Seen at 2,000 feet, but not as numerous as in the low country.\n\n100. *Caprimulgus indicus jotaka*. (Temm.)\nThe Jungle Nightjar. A few pairs frequented the Tea Garden clearing (at 2,000 feet) and used to hawk along the jungle edge at dusk. I shot a pair. (2.)\n*C. macrurus* and *Lyncornis temmincki*, so common in the low country, I neither saw nor heard on the hills.\n\n101. *Harpactes erythrocephalus*. (Gould.)\nThe Red-headed Trogon. Met with several times at 3,500 feet or so. (1.)\n\n102. *Harpactes duvauceli*. (Temm.)\nThe Red-rumped Trogon. I obtained one very young example at 3,500 feet. (1.)\n\n103. *Zanclostomus javanicus*. (Horsf.)\nThe Lesser Red-billed Malkoha.\nSeems to me to range higher up the hills than the other birds of this group. It is not uncommon at 3,500 feet. It is very partial to the big wingless females of one of the larger stick insects, for which it searches the branches so systematically that the insect's wonderful likeness to a dead twig avails it nothing. Having pecked and bruised the mantis into a state of helplessness, the bird proceeds to pull off the strong spiny legs one by one and then swallows the long body head first. I have taken 3 of these insects, 7 or 8 inches long and nearly as thick as one's little finger from the stomach of one of these Malkohas. (1.)\n104. *Rhinorhina chlorophava.* (Raffles.)\n   Raffles' Green-billed Malkoha.\n   This very common low country bird ranges up the hills to about 2,000 feet, above which I have not seen it.\n\n105. *Ketupa javanensis.* (Less.)\n   The Malay Fish-Owl.\n   I disturbed one from a bough overhanging a stream in thick jungle near the foot of the hills.\n\n106. *Spizaetus albiniger.* (Blyth.)\n   Blyth's Hawk-eagle.\n   A pair of these very beautiful eagles used to visit the tea garden clearing regularly during my stay there, attracted by a brood of chickens, one or two of which they carried off daily for a week. Coming round the corner of a cattle-shed one day I came upon one of them sitting on a stump not more than ten yards from me. Instead of flying he merely erected his crest and stared at me, and I backed quietly away to 30 yards distance and shot him. (1.)\n\n107. *Spilornis baha.*\n   The Malay Snake-eagle.\n   Frequently seen, but not shot.\n\n108. *Accipiter virgatus* (Reinw.)\n   The Besra Sparrow-hawk.\n   Seen once or twice up to 3,000 feet. I found a nest with the bird sitting near the foot of the hills, in April, but the tree was quite unclimbable.\n\n109. *Treron nepalensis.* (Hodgs.)\n   The Thick-billed Green Pigeon.\n   Small flocks met with and a few birds shot up to 3,500 feet.\n\n110. *Ducula badia.* (Raffles.)\n   The Copper-backed Imperial Pigeon.\nA few of these fine Pigeons were seen, generally passing over at a great height. I shot one specimen at 3500 feet. (1.)\n\n111. *Chalcophaps indica.* (Linn.)\nThe Bronze-winged Dove.\nHeard and seen up to 3,500 feet.\n\n112. *Macropygia ruficeps.* (Temm.)\nThe Little Malay Cuckoo-Dove.\nFairly common from 2,000 to 4,000 feet. I shot several specimens, most of which were rather knocked about and were handed over to the cook. Mr. Wray notes Cuckoo-Doves as rare on these hills, and Sharpe wrote of the only specimen that Mr. Wray sent him that it appeared to be *M. tusalia*. Mine were all *M. ruficeps*. (1.)\n\n113. *Argusianus argus.* (Linn.)\nThe Argus Pheasant.\n* Heard frequently up to 2,500 feet, but as usual, not seen. (1\u2014trapped.)\n\nThis completes the list of species identified during my two months on the Larut Hills. I met with two other birds which I have left out of the above list, not knowing where to insert them. One was a dark grey Thrush-like bird which I obtained a glimpse of only in thick jungle at 3,500 feet, and which may perhaps have been *Melanocichla peninsularis* (Sharpe.) The other was a small robin-like brown bird, with a good deal of white on the bases of the tail-feathers. I found this bird one morning in the same trap which caught one of the specimens of *Digenea malayana* as mentioned above. Elevation 4,000 feet. I accidentally omitted to send it to Tring with the rest of my collections, and though I did so subsequently I have not yet received the identification.\n\n*A. L. Butler.*\nA Catalogue of the Ferns of Borneo and some of the adjacent Islands which have been recorded up to the present time.\n\nThe following list contains, I believe, all the Ferns that have been recorded from Borneo, the Sulu Archipelago, the Natunas, and a few small islands close to the Borneo Coast. It is probably very far from being a complete catalogue of all the members of this interesting family that exist in that region. The Ferns belonging to Borneo itself have been collected almost exclusively in the State of Sarawak, and the Territory of British North Borneo. These two countries together occupy about one third part only of the whole island, the remainder (with the exception of the small kingdom still held by the Sultan of Brunei) being in the possession of the Dutch Government. It is possible that in Dutch scientific publications a few species not mentioned here may have been recorded, but, if so, they have not come to my knowledge.\n\nThe large number of new species which have been found in recent years within a comparatively small area, chiefly by Signor Beccari, Mr. Burbidge, Mr. Charles Hose, Dr. G. D. Haviland and myself, leads to the belief that a rich harvest awaits the collector who shall hereafter visit the less known districts of Dutch Borneo. Of the 430 species and varieties contained in this list, 114 were first found in Borneo. Seven of these have since been met with elsewhere; but there remain 107 which have no other habitat at present known. Some of them are exceedingly rare, several having been only once found.\n\nI have not in all cases mentioned the collector's name: but it is to be understood that when no name is given, that of\nMr. Charles Hose is to be supplied for the Ferns that come from the Baram district of Sarawak, including Mt. Mulu, Mt. Dulit, Mt. Lambir, Niah, &c., and my own in all other instances.\n\nI have followed the arrangement in Hooker and Baker's Synopsis Filicum, 2nd Edition, 1874. The Roman numerals refer to the Genus, and the Arabic to the Species; and I have indicated the position of new Ferns, as Mr. Baker does, by giving them the number of the species nearest to them with the addition of an asterisk.\n\nIt is much to be desired that the surviving author of the Synopsis may find it possible to bring out a new edition, as it has been long out of print, and an enormous addition to the number of known Ferns has been made since its publication. The Supplement, \"Ferns discovered or described since 1874,\" and subsequent lists of new discoveries published by Mr. Baker only in part supply this want, as they are hardly more than lists: for descriptions an immense number of publications have to be consulted, and these are seldom accessible to persons who live in the regions where novelties are to be found.\nFILICES.\n\nSub-Order I. GLEICHENIACEAE.\n\nGLEICHENIA. (Gen. ii Syn. Fil. p. 11.)\n\nGleichenia circinata, Sw. (Syn. Fil. ii. 3.) Mt. Kinabalu, Mr. F. W. Burbidge, 5,000-6,000 ft. and Dr. G. D.

(Mertensia) longissima Bl. (Syn. Fil. ii. 7.) = G. glanca Hooker, the oldest name. Mt. Dulit and Mt. Matang. Sarawak, not under 2,500 ft. though elsewhere in Malaya it is found at a much lower elevation.\nDistribution: China, Japan, Malaya, West Indies.\n\u2014 variety arachnoides Mett. (Syn. Fil. l. c.) = G. bullata, Moore. Mt. Kinabalu, 7000 ft. Sir Hugh Low.\n\nG. (Mert.) sp. Large, tripinnatifid, stem and rachises covered with broad acuminate brown scales having whitish cartilaginous edges, the crossing of which on the surface produces an appearance that may be called \"cobwebby.\" Pinnae 18 in. long, 4-5 in. wide, oblong-lanceolate. Secondary pinnae 2-2\u00bd in. l. \u00bc in. wide, cut down nearly to the rachis into oblong blunt segments, with margins much recurved. Sori covered by the large spreading scales.\nA single specimen in the Sarawak Museum contributed by Dr. G. D. Haviland from Mt. Kinabalu, 8,000 ft. His number 1950. If this is the G. arachnoides Hk. from this\nlocality, marked var. B of *G. longissima* Bl. in Syn. Fil., it deserved a fuller description than the brief one \"broad cobwebby.\" I think it is a distinct species.\n\n*G. (Mert.) flagellaria*, Spr. (Syn. Fil. ii. 19).

Baker in Ferns discovered since 1874 says it has been found in Borneo, but does not give habitat or collector's name. I have in my collection a single pinna of a fern collected in the Natuna Islands by Mr. A. H. Everett which is like A. dubia, but the specimen is too incomplete for positive identification.\n\nA. latebrosa, Hooker (Syn. Fil. vi. 59.) Common in Sarawak up to 2,000 ft.\nDistribution: Almost throughout India proper, Malaya, Formosa, etc.\n\nA. Wallacei, Mett. (Syn Fil. p. 450.) Habitat \"Borneo, (Wallace.\") I know nothing of this Fern beyond the notice of it in the Synopsis Filicum referred to.\n\nA. Burbidgei, Baker in Jour. Bot. 1879. p. 38.

Found by Mr. Charles Hose hanging from the roof of a limestone cave at Niah in the Baram Residency, Sarawak. The specific name is unfortunate as it is not sarmentose. Baker describes it in his *Ferns discovered or described since 1874* as \"the most interesting novelty that has been found in the period under review.\"\n\nTRIBE II.

Borneo at 6,000 ft.\n\n\u00a7 Microlepis.\n\nD. (Micro) pinnata, Cav. (Syn. Fil. xviii. 82.) The Sarawak form of this fern corresponds to the variety D. gracilis Bl. as described in Syn. Fil: that is to say the lower pinnae are cut down nearly to the rachis into linear oblong entire, or sub-entire, lobes. But Mr. Baker has given the name D. gracilis Bl. = D. Luzonica Hk. to the form described below. This is intermediate between that and the type. Mt. Matang 2,500 ft. Distribution: (of the type) Malay Peninsula, Penang, Java, Celebes, Polynesian Islands.\n\nvar. gracilis Bl. = D. Luzonica Hk. (Syn. Fil. xviii. 52 var).

D. Haviland 5,500 ft.\nTHE FERNS OF BORNEO.\n\n*L. cultrata*, Swartz (Syn. Fil. xx. 7). The type is common. A form found on Mt.

Hk. at Kew.\n\nDistribution (of type,) Himalayas, Neilgherries, Malaya, Bourbon, Queensland, Madagascar.\n\n*L. crispa*, Baker in Jour. Bot. 1879. p. 39. In *Ferns discovered or described since 1874* he adds Hook. Ic. tab. 1627. North Borneo, Mr. F. C. Burbidge.\n\n*L. pectinata*, Bl. (Syn. Fil. xx. 10) another name for *Davallia (Odontoloma) repens*, Dew which see.\n\n*L. scandens*, Hk. (Syn. Fil. xx. 11.) Common. When mature it is bipinnate and quite undistinguishable from *L. trapeziformis* with which I believe it to be conspecific. It is entirely unlike *L. pectinata* in habit, texture and cutting; and I think it must be through some mistake that it is said in Syn. Fil. to be doubtfully distinct from this last. In young, but fruited forms, it is sometimes found with the pinnae almost imbricated and prettily variegated with white veins.\n\n*L. flabellulata*, Dry. (Syn. Fil. xx. 16.) Common in Sarawak. Distribution: Malaya to S. China; N. India, Ceylon, Australia.\n\n\u2014 var. A fern sent to Kew from Mt. Matang, near the summit 13,000 ft, is said by Mr. Baker to be \"a much divided form of *flabellulata*.\" I give a description of it as I am inclined to think it deserving of the honour of being reckoned as a Species.\n\nRhizome short creeping, densely clothed with linear-lanceolate brown scales which extend to the basis of the stipes. Stipes otherwise naked, slender, chestnut-brown, 6 in. long, 3-4 in. wide, simply pinnate in the upper part, fully quadrifid in the lower. Ultimate divisions suborbicular-cuneate, rather deeply lobed \u00bc in. long and as broad. Veins flabellate, once forked in each lobe. Sori\nrather narrow, interrupted. Indusium persistent. I have only found it on one occasion.\n\n*L. gomphophylla*, Baker in *Ferns discovered or described since 1874*. \"Borneo, Sir Hugh Low.\"\n\n*L. trapeziformis*, Dry. (Syn. Fil. xx. 17.)

There are two forms often found in the same locality, both in Borneo and the Malay Peninsula but not in any way running into one another. In the typical form the two edges of the pinnae are very nearly parallel. In the other form the base is half as long as the pinna, the upper surface is cultrate, curved from the point of the auricle to the extremity of the pinna, and the underside is cut away as in *Asplenium resectum*.

Vol. v. 1891 Mr. Baker seems disposed to place under A. latifolium, Don. as Beddome does, is both in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo exceedingly different from the latter fern as represented in the specimens sent to me from the Himalayas and Ceylon. The Malayan Fern is well described in Syn. Fil. excepting that the limits of its dimensions should be extended in both directions. I have specimens with the secondary pinnae 5 in. long by 1\u00bd in. broad cut half-way down into rounded sub-falcate lobes; and others in which they are 1\u00bd in. long by \u00bc in. broad with edges merely serrate. It is common on the hills of Sarawak.\nDistribution: Malaya, Ceylon to North India.\n\nA (Dipl.) sp. A Fern found on Matang which I have twice sent to Kew (No. 74) and which is placed by Mr. Baker under A. maximum, Don. seems to me to be a very distinct species. The following is a description of it. Stipes tufted 2 or\nmore feet long with rather broad pale-brown scales at the base, otherwise naked, pale green when living, as is the whole frond. Frond 1\u00bd to 3 ft. long, 1 ft. broad in the middle, tripinnatifid, the lowest pinnae much the longest, up to 1 ft. but curved and ascending, so that in general outline the frond is elliptical rather than deltoid. Pinnales 1 to 2 in. long falcate unequal-sided, acute, the lower side narrowed very gradually towards the base, and therefore much curved, entire, or crenate in the upper part; the upper side narrowed suddenly, auricled, the base parallel with the rachis, beyond the auricle cut down about \u00bc into rounded finely serrate lobes. Veins pinnate in the lower part, simple in the upper. Sori fine reaching neither the midrib nor the edge.\n\nThe whole fern is, when living, very flaccid and herbaceous differing in this respect as well as in the form of the whole frond and of its several parts from the robust habit of A. maximum. I have named it provisionally A. (Dipl.) Matangense.\n\nA. (Dipl.) vestitum, Presl. (Syn. Fil. xxxiii. 248.) Borneo, sde Moore, as stated by Cesati in Fil. Becc. Born. p. 22.\nDistribution: Philippines.\n\nA. (Dipl.) Blumei, Bergsm. This is in Cesati's list, but I do not know it.\n\nA. (Dipl.) latifolium, Don. (Syn. Fil. xxxviii. 249.) Found by Burbidge in N. Borneo, see Baker in Jour. Bot. 1879. p. 41.\nDistribution: Ceylon and Neilgherries; Sumatra; Philippines; S. China.\n\nA. (Dipl.) latifolium, Don. \"Variety\" Baker. This I have found only once, on Lingga Mountain in Sarawak. It has pinnae 1\u00bd ft. long, 5 in. wide at the base, pinnatifid at the apex, and below that 12-15 pairs of nearly opposite, stalked, deltoid-lanceolate pinnules, 2 in. l. by \u00be in. broad cut down nearly to the base into oblong, or slightly falcate segments, the lower ones crenate on the upper side. I think it is probably a distinct species.\n\u00a7 Anisogonium.\n\nA. (Aniso.) cordifolium, (Syn. Fil. xxxviii, 266.) Banting, Mt.

Singapore and Sarawak.\nTHE SCITAMINE\u00c6 OF THE MALAY PENINSULA.\n\nThe traveller in the forests of the Peninsula can hardly fail to notice the beauty of many of our wild gingers (Scitamine\u00e6) and would be surprised to find how much this interesting group of plants has been neglected by botanists, for though many have received names, but few have been completely described, and the descriptions of Malayan species by Miquel and Blume are often so incomplete that it is impossible to make out what plants they are intended for. Many descriptions have been made from badly dried specimens, and unless special care is taken these plants do not preserve well, for the flowers are thin and fugacious, and the spikes usually full of water, and unless the flowers are dried separately from the spikes they are apt to rot in the press. Very few kinds again have been cultivated in gardens either in the East or in Europe, but those that have, have often been well figured and described. In studying this group here, I have in nearly every case compiled the description from specimens in the jungle itself, or from plants brought home and cultivated in the Botanic Gardens.\n\nThe Order consists of five groups, which, beginning with the most specialised, are Zingiberace\u00e6, Marantace\u00e6, Cannace\u00e6, Lowiace\u00e6 and Musace\u00e6.\n\nThe typical monocotyledonous flower consists of three sepals (calyx) three petals (corolla) six stamens in two whorls and three pistils. In this order the sepals are usually united into a tube and the corolla also forms a tube, with the petals free at the top (corolla lobes.) The stamens in the Musace\u00e6 (Bananas) and Lowiace\u00e6 are five in number, one being entirely suppressed, or forming part of the lip. In the Arrow-roots, (Marantace\u00e6) only four are developed, one forms the lip, another is spathulate and hooded (the cucullate stamen) a third is flat and resembles a petal (petaloid) and the other is narrow and bears in its edge an anther cell. This curious arrangement is\nan elaborate contrivance for insect fertilization which cannot easily be explained without diagrams. In the Cannas (Cannaceae) four of the stamens are petaloid and the fifth bears an anther cell on its edge. These plants are self-fertilized in bud. No Cannas are really wild here but one or two have escaped from cultivation. The Zingiberaceae have a single complete stamen only, the rest being either entirely suppressed except one which forms the lip, or two more may appear as petal-like lobes or horns or teeth, (Staminodes). The ovary is three-celled in most of the order, but bears only one style, which is however three-lobed in Loriciaceae, showing its origin from three styles. In all the Zingiberaceae but one or two genera, there are at the base of the corolla tube, two small processes, the styloides, which are probably the remains of the other styles, or possibly some of the lost stamens. Their function is apparently to secrete nectar which fills the bottom of the tube. The flowers of nearly all are fertilized by bees, or sometimes flies. The spikes, racemes or panicles are borne on leafy stems or spring directly from the rhizome, the leaves being borne on different stems. As a rule plants growing in dense jungle have the flowers close to the ground on short leafless stems, while those which grow on river banks or open spaces have them on the ends of leafy stems. The fruits of the different groups do not differ much, except in the case of the Musas, which have the well known Banana fruit, the rest have capsules of two or more seeds (in Donax there is often but one seed). The seeds are usually enclosed in a sweet aril, and in the Zingiberaceae are usually very aromatic. The fruits are seldom conspicuous, and often only dull green in color. This is especially the case with those which fruit near the ground, the seeds of which are distributed by mice and squirrels who eat the sweet pulp (aril) surrounding the seed. The fruits of some of the terminal spiked species, e.g. Alpinia, are orange and showy, and the seeds dispersed by birds.\n\nUses. The Zingiberaceae are nearly all very aromatic, and many have very strongly flavoured root-stocks, which are used as spices. Among these the Ginger, Turmeric, and Zedoary, and Galangal are commonly cultivated here, and many of the wild Globbas, and Amomums are used in native medicine. The\nfruits of a few species of *Amomum*, e.g. *A. uliginosum*, are eaten also by Sakais. The buds of *Hornstedtia imperialis* are also popular as curry-stuffs among the Malays, and the fruit of the commonest of our wild plantains, *Musa Malaccensis* is quite eatable, though it is small and full of seed. Indeed I believe that this plant is the parent of several of the local cultivated Pisangs. The wild plantains also give a very good fibre from the leaf sheaths, though it is not by any means as good as that of the Manilla hemp (*Musa textilis*). The stout stems of the Bemban (*Clinogyne*) split up, are used for making baskets, and I found that the leaf stems of the bigger Gingers, (*Hornstedtia*), beaten up and treated with caustic potash, formed a very good paper stuff, and might be used for that purpose, if there was sufficient demand for it.\n\n**Groups.**\n\nFertile stamen one: with two cells.

The calyx is tubular or cup-shaped, the corolla tube usually slender and longer with small boat-shaped lobes reflexed when the flower is open, and a pair of staminodes very similar to the corolla lobes. The lip base is parallel to the erect stamen and its sides joined to it, forming a tube, the limb or free portion is narrow and usually bilobed. The tube contains nectar, and the entrance to it is a slit in front, at the foot of which is usually a brown or violet spot, a guiding mark for the insect visitors. The stamen above the lip is long and slender, and curved over at the top where it bears the oblong anther, which often has one or two pairs of processes at the sides usually flat and linear or triangular (the spurs). The style is long and slender and runs up along the stamen, passing between the anther cells in the usual way. The fruit is a small capsule as big as a pea, which when ripe splits widely open exposing a number of small brown seeds. The flowers are either yellow, or white or violet, and in some cases the bracts are coloured red or yellow, making the plants very showy. Globbas are to be found in all of\nour forests on rocks, or in damp spots, often in great abundance. The genus occurs in the Himalayas and Burma, less commonly in other parts of India, and, except for one possibly introduced species, is absent from Ceylon. They are abundant all over the Malay Peninsula and Siam, Sumatra and Borneo, becoming rarer further east.\n\nThe species, though somewhat variable, are tolerably easily distinguished and classified, though it is not always easy to identify some of those that have been described on account of the authors having often omitted to describe important parts of the flower. Thus Miquel rarely described the anther-spurs, the best character for classifying the species, while Baker in the Flora of British India while paying due attention to this character lays some stress on the presence or absence of bulbils, which are often produced from the axils of the bracts. This character however is absolutely worthless. Any globba growing in a sufficiently wet spot especially near a stream will produce bulbils sometimes completely replacing the flowers with them. In two species G. marantina and G. bulbilifera it is true that bulbils are invariably produced in the lower bracts, but all the species may at times bear them also. An important character also is the calyx, and as specimens are often met with in which the corolla is fallen away, this organ which remains on the fruit is very useful in identification. Sometimes it is regular and tubular with three equal points, sometimes dilated upwards or again curved with two large and one small tooth or there may be no trace of teeth or lobes.\n\nThose who have not seen globbas in plenty growing wild might be puzzled by odd forms which sometimes occur in which the inflorescence is borne on leafless stems. Miquel's G. aphylla is probably one of these, perhaps a sport of the very common G. panicoides. Plants also with branching stems occur, but are much rarer.\n\n\u00a7 APLANTHERA.\n\nAnthers spurless, Flowers yellow.\n\nGl. Wallichii Baker. Flor. Brit.

Sumatra on the Kelantan river, Siak. Borneo, Sandakan, Bongaya river, Labuk bay and Sarawak.\n\nThis is a very common plant along stream banks and in damp spots in woods all over the Malay Peninsula. It is very variable in size, form of leaf, and length of panicle and its branches. The forms from Sarawak and Sandakan are stout broad leaved forms with branches an inch and a half long, and\nlonger calyces, but I can only consider them as extreme forms.\n\nI have the authority of Dr. King for identifying *G. kingii* Baker with the ill-described *G. panicoides* of Miquel of which he has seen a type. It would indeed be strange if so very abundant and conspicuous a plant had escaped Miquel. I cannot from the description distinguish *G. stenothyrsa* Baker. from this plant. It is based on specimens from Tenasserim collected by Parish, and from a plant collected by Cuming in Malacca.\n\nLike all other Globbas, this often produces bulbils in the axils of the bracts, and often the whole panicle produces bulbils instead of flowers.\n\nIt is known to the Malays by a variety of names, viz. Haliya hutan (wild ginger), Meroyan Tingal, and Meroyan K'choin, Pua Birah, Bunga Lidah Munta, Haliya K'ra. The slightly aromatic roots are used in native medicine for fever, and rheumatism.\n\n*Gl. pendula* Roxb. Asiat. Res. XI. 359 Fl. Ind. 179.\n\nA large plant 3 feet or more tall.

Lip obovate bilobed. Staminodes large obovate petaloid,\nStamen projecting beyond the tube. Anther long slender curved dorsifixed versatile, the base prolonged into two parallel processes, the upper part only polliniferous. Style slender, stigma capitate. Capsule oblong, seeds numerous small curved fusiform aril lacinate. Two species occurring only on hills in the Peninsula and in Borneo. These plants have been referred to the genus *Kempferia*, but though allied they are very distinct in the peculiar arrangement of the anther quite unique in the order. As in *Kempferia* the lip and staminodes are the showy part of the flower, being broad and petal like. On the lip at the base are two keels with a groove between leading to the tube which contains the honey. The anther is curved and narrow and fixed by the back on the filament so that it swings readily, and the lower part is prolonged into a pair of long spurs. When a bee visits the flower it follows up the groove of the lip to insert its proboscis into the tube, and as its head touches the processes of the anther and pushes them back it brings down the upper part of the anther (where alone is any pollen,) and the stigma upon its back. Of course on visiting another flower the same thing occurs, and the pollen of the first flower is brushed off by the stigma of the second and so the flower is fertilized. Unlike *Kempferia* the Camptandras often set fruit, although the flower is open only for a few hours in the morning. This is doubtless due to the more certain working of this neat though simple mechanism.\n\n*C. parvula* n. sp. *Kempferia parvula* Bak. l.c. p. 239.\n\nA small herb about six inches tall.

Sept. on rocks or the ground. Without locality (Dr. King, No. 7219.) This is a very much larger and succulent plant. It has a very short rhizome and the stems are usually solitary, somewhat thickened at the base. The flowers are large and vary from pure white to violet. They last only a few hours. The seed often germinates in the spathe.\n\nK\u00c4MPFERIA.\n\nHardly any species of this genus have yet been found wild within our boundaries, though some kinds occur in the Lankawi islands and in Southern Siam. A few however are cultivated as spices by the Chinese and occasionally turn up in waste ground.\n\nThe genus if confined to the original K. rotunda L and its allies is a fairly distinct one, but unfortunately, Gastrochilus pandurata was described by Roxburgh as a K\u00e4mpferia and\nlater botanists added more of this very distinct genus, so that it was absolutely proposed to amalgamate the two. The genus *Kempferia* may be thus defined. Herbs with an underground rhizome often tuberous and aromatic, stem short or produced, rarely absent. Leaves thin in texture few or several. Inflorescence spicate subterminal with thin lanceolate bracts. Flowers showy thin textured and very fugacious, opening singly violet or white. Calyx short cylindric. Corolla-tube long slender lobes narrow linear inconspicuous. Staminodes very large rounded horizontal clawed, forming with the rounded bilobed lip a nearly circular flower. Stamens short thin flat with a long narrow petaloid crest. Anther thin and usually concealed in the tube, linear not versatile and dorsifixed. Style slender. Capsule (rarely produced) oblong thin walled.\n\nDistribution: India, Burmah, Siam and Cochin China.\n\nThe thin flat staminodes usually of the same color as the lip and lying in the same plane form the conspicuous part of the flower, the petals being much smaller and usually reflexed, hidden behind the staminodes and lip. The entrance to the nectary is very small and is partly blocked by the crest of the anther.\n\nThe genus can readily be divided into sections, viz. 1. *Sincorbus* (Horan) stem very short, flowers appearing with the leaves. This includes *K. Galanga* L sometimes cultivated here by the Chinese; *K. marginata* Carey. *K. speciosa* Bak. *K. Roscoeana* Wall.; natives of Burmah. *K. elegans* Wall. Siam (Curtis.) and Burmah. *K. angustifolia* Roxb. Bengal, also Siam (Dr. Keith.) *K. ovalifolia* Burmah and Siam, also collected in Malacca by Col. Farquhar according to Baker, but doubtless cultivated there. *K. pulchra* Ridl. Lankawi and Siam. *K. glauca* Ridl. Siam. *K. undulata* Teysm, locality unknown.\n\nSect 2. *Protanthium*. Leaves and flowers appearing at different times, including only *K. rotunda* L \"Kunchur\" of the Malays only cultivated here, and *K. candida* Wall. of Burmah.\n\nSect. 3. *Monophorus*; with an erect rarely prostrate leafy stem. *K. linearis* Wall, *K. secunda* Wall. *K. sikkimensis* King of India. *K. macroclamys* Baker of Burmah and *K. decus-sylvae* Hallier of Borneo, a peculiar prostrate form.\n\nSect. 4. *Stachyanthesia* with a leafy stem and flowers in a long spike. *K. scaposa* Benth. India.\nExcluded from the genus are *K. pandurata* Roxb., *K. Prainiana* King, *K. concinna* Bak., *K. parviflora* Wall., *K. anomala* Hallier, all of which belong to the genus *Gastrochilus* as probably do *K. involucrata* King, *K. Andersoni*, and *K. siphonantha* Bak. from India and Burmah, and *K. purpurea* Koen. (Retz observ. iii. 57) Junk Ceylon. *K. parvula* King is *Camptandra parvula* Ridl.\n\n*K. pulchra* n. sp.\n\nLeaves two ovate blunt spreading out usually flat on the ground, blade seven inches long by five inches across, petiole short, three inches long, dark olivaceous black with grey markings above. Inflorescence between the leaves, peduncle three inches long green terete, spike sub-cylindric one inch long covered with persistent convolute bracts, the outer one brown and ribbed the inner ones about 20, thin white, lanceolate. Flowers numerous produced singly at considerable intervals of time, thin fugacious. Calyx very thin tubular. Corolla tube about an inch long very slender white, lobes linear obtuse white reflexed \u00bd an inch long. Staminodes and lip connate below. Staminodes obovate as long as the lip obtuse, mauve. Lip deeply bilobed, lobes oblong apices rounded \u00bd an inch long, mauve with the base pale yellowish white. Stamen, filament very short. Anther narrow oblong, crest very long linear apex entire rounded recurved. Style much shorter than the appendage and projecting but little beyond the anther, stigma two lipped, lower lip prolonged.\n\nSiam. Bangtaphan very common in dry places. (Dr. Keith). Lankawi (Curtis). This pretty plant which has long been cultivated in Singapore is nearly allied to *K. Roscoeana* Wall, but differs in the mauve not white flower, and the remarkably long entire anther appendage which is longer than the rest of the stamen. The anther and style are hidden in the tube, being much shorter.\n\n*K. glauca* n. sp.\n\nLeaves 3 unequal orbicular cuspidate, the largest five inches long by three wide, glaucous green. Flowers numerous in a spike almost hidden between the leaves. Bracts lanceo-\nlate acuminate about an inch long, narrow, spotted with red. Calyx one inch long tubular spathaceous entire spotted red. Corolla tube cylindric two inches long, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch thick pale violet, lobes lanceolate cuspidate \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) an inch long \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch wide, white spotted with red at the tip. Lip orbicular cleft nearly to base, inner edges straight violet with a white spot at the base, one inch across. Staminodes orbicular narrowed at the base \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) an inch long and wide, violet. Stamen, with the anther entirely outside the tube nearly \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) inch long, cells parallel rather fleshy pollen white, crest large reniform recurved broad entire violet. Style longer than the anther purple. stigma capitate deep red purple. Siam, Kasum, (Curtis).\n\nThis curious and pretty plant grows abundantly on the limestone rocks of Kasum, the rhizomes being imbedded so deeply in chinks of the rock that it is necessary to break away the rock to get at them. The gray green leaves and violet flowers make it an attractive plant. Structurally its most remarkable point is that the anther projects outside the tube entirely, instead of being concealed within as in the case of K. elegans, etc., and the style is also visible from the outside.\n\n**Gastrochilus.**\n\nThis genus was first distinguished by Wallich who described two species from *Kempferia* as it then stood by the lip being saccate or basin shaped, and by the habit. This form of the lip is peculiar to a few species only of the plants which I would refer to the genus, and which as I have already said is very distinct from the true *Kempferia*. The genus may be thus defined. Small herbs with a short rhizome. Stem tall and leafy or short. Leaves usually several together lanceolate or ovate. Inflorescence spicate with large bracts sometimes colored springing from the axils of the leaves, or independently on the rhizome or terminal when the stem is tall. Flowers thin white, yellow or red. Calyx tubular. Corolla tube rather long slender lobe oblong or lanceolate. Staminodes similar but slightly longer erect. Lip oblong or obtuse entire or three lobed. Stamen thick and fleshy with an oblong anther, the crest of which is small rounded or lobed.\n\nDistribution: India, the Malay peninsula and islands.\nThe species can be divided into three groups. *Acranthis*, in which the flower spike is borne on the top of a leafy stem; *Mesanthi* from the centre of a leaf tuft; and *Exanthi* outside the leaf-tuft. The last group suggests a close affinity with the Curcumas, of the section Hitcheniopsis, the real difference being the shape of the bracts and their more cone-shaped arrangement. Indeed *C Kunstleri* might almost as well be put in Gastrochilus as in Curcuma. *Scaphochlamys* described by Baker and referred to the neighbourhood of *Elettariopsis*, is truly a Gastrochilus, though in some respects a curious form.\n\nThe *Gastrochili* inhabit woods, and though the species are usually local, that is to say restricted in area, they usually occur in quantity when met with. The flowers, which are very delicate and pretty, often sweet scented, open one at a time about midday, withering towards evening. They very rarely produce fruit. Many species are well worth cultivating, and grow readily in pots, or in shady spots in the ground.\n\nAs the genus has been so much confused with *Kempferia* I submit a list of all species known to me with localities.\n\n\u00a7 *Acranthis*.\n\n*G. pulcherrima* Wall.

Leaves about six oblong lanceolate acuminate bases broad rounded, blade eight inches long, by 2\u00bd across, glabrous, petiole rather slender two inches long, sheaths about six inches. Spike central shorter than the upper leaves about five inches long. Bracts lanceolate acute closely appressed. Calyx spathaceous \u00bc inch long truncate. Corolla tube one inch long, hardly longer than the bracts, lobes linear incurved white. Staminodes porrect, and curved up overlying the upper edges of the lip, oblong obtuse, white with a pink tinge.

Anther linear half an inch long, crest none.\n\nPerak, on Maxwell's Hill, collected by Mr. F. A. Wooldridge and flowered in the Botanic Gardens, Penang, September 1894.\n\nThis pretty plant is distinguished by the lip being narrowed at the base with the sides turned up and the edges turned out and down. The staminodes lying along the upper edge of the lip enclose it so that a bee or other insect must creep in so as to get at the honey.\n\nThe plant is very closely allied to G. pulcherrima Wall, differing in the more convolute lip and longer petioled leaves. An exceedingly similar if not identical plant occurs also in Lankawi (Curtis 2677).\n\nG. minor Bak. Fl. Brit.

Flowers white, with a yellow bar on the lip, sweet-scented.\n\nCorolla tube slender one inch long, lobes oblong lanceolate \u00bd inch long. Staminodes as long and similar. Lip obovate undulate bilobed. Stamen broad white, anther cells narrow, crest very large and orbicular. Style shorter than the crest.\n\nMalacca. Woods on Mount Ophir, (3141); Bukit Muar (Feilding).\n\nThe chief peculiarity of this plant is the curious spirally arranged bracts which gradually spread out as the spike develops.

Corolla tube long and slender one inch long, lobes linear \u00bc inch. Lip half an inch long bilobed, lobes rounded. Staminodes ob-\nlong rounded nearly as long as the corolla lobes but broader. Anther with linear parallel cells, crest large broader than the anther broadly cuneate shortly three-lobed.\n\nJohore. Kwa13 Sembrong (Lake and Kelsall 1892).\n\nThis is most nearly allied to *G. scaphochlamys* Ridl., but has smaller bracts, and flowers with longer corolla tubes, and a different crest.\n\n*G. longipes* King and Prain mss.\n\nRhizome rather far-creeping. Leaves two, blade elliptic ovate eight inches long by four wide subacute glabrous, petiole 9 inches long, 3 inches sheathing. Spike central 2 inches long. Bracts narrow lanceolate few and long. Corolla tube long and slender, lobes lanceolate half as long as the lip. Lip entire oblong apex rounded edges crisped and thickened central bar much thickened \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) inch long. Staminodes broader than corolla lobes, and longer than the lip. Stamen, filament rather slender, anther oblong, crest rather large oblong rounded. Style considerably longer. Stigma broadly obconic.\n\nPerak. Briah, Larut (Wray 4220).\n\nThis resembles *G. lancifolius* in the form of the spike and the flower especially in the entire crisped lip. The foliage however is very distinct at two leaves being very large and broad with very long petioles. The long decurved style projecting some way beyond the anther is unusual but is matched in *G. Curtisi*.\n\n*G. Curtisi* Baker. Bot. Mag. t. 7863.\n\nLeaves four in a tuft, blade ovate oblong acute, 5 inches to a foot long, two to six inches across, bright green pubescent on the back, petiole stout six inches long, sheaths broad about 2 inches long purplish. Spike central shorter than the petioles about an inch long. Bracts oblong, white, as long as the calyx. Calyx tube white cylindrical, lobes lanceolate acute pubescent, one inch long. Corolla tube two inches long cylindric dilated a little at the top, lobes oblong lanceolate one inch long. Staminodes a little shorter, all white. Lip longer oblong obtuse flat, yellowish cream with red marks on the sides. Stamen, filament cylindrical pubescent, anther short and thick, crest short broad\ntruncate. Style considerably longer thick above the anther, stigma cup-shaped.\n\nLankawi Islands on limestone rocks, (Curtis 2896).\n\nThe most peculiar point about this plant is that the anther cells apparently open at the top only and do not split for their whole length as is usual. There is a large depression behind the anther formed by the broad and short crest from which the long style protrudes. The back of the leaves are pubescent, and in the picture the upper surface is represented so also, but I do not see any hairs here in the specimen, nor are they mentioned in the description.\n\nG. cliva is n. sp.\n\nRhizome rather slender with long roots. Leaves 3 or 4 in a tuft, ovate to lanceolate acute narrowed at the base into the petiole inequilateral 4\u00bd to 8 inches long and 2 inches wide, petiole 5 or 6 inches long sheathing for about 3 inches, all glabrous except about the midrib on the back which bears scattered hairs. Spike central 3 inches long, enclosed in the sheaths. Bracts long and narrow containing four or five flowers each with two long narrow linear acute transparent bracteoles one inch long and \u00bc inch wide. Calyx tube very narrow half an inch long, with three lanceolate lobes, two longer than the third. Corolla tube slender dilated a little upwards 2 inches long, lobes linear \u00bd an inch long by \u00bc inch wide. Lip oblong entire apex rounded, crisped, median bar thickened.

It is probably a native of India. The leaves are about 5 in a tuft oblong ovate with a broad base and long petiole. The spike is short and central. The flowers are white or pink, lip saccate white with pink spots.\nG.

It should be sought again in the Kinta valley.\n\n*G. tillandsioides*. Bak. l.c. based on a drawing made by Kunstler from a plant probably collected in Perak, I have not seen, and as far as description goes I see but little difference between it and the preceding.\n\nA very curious plant I found at the base of Gunong Panti in Johore, has unusually large leaves ovate glabrous 9 inches long and 6 across, petiole 7 inches and one or more cylindric imbricated spikes in the centre, 6 inches long, the bracts 1\u00bd inch long.

Bracts narrow lanceolate red, blunt with a minute point, \u00be inch long rolled round the base of the flower, two to each spike. Spikes six in the inflorescence, on a peduncle an inch long. Calyx tubular very short. Corolla tube one inch long lobes lanceolate acute \u00be inch long. Staminodes much shorter oblong obtuse rounded. Lip obovate bifid at the apex. All white except for a stain of pale yellow in the centre of the lip. Stamen short, anther oblong pubescent, crest broader than the anther rounded retuse. Stigma cup-shaped.\nSelangor.

The head quarters of the genus lying further north in Northern India and Burmah. Very few occur in the Malay islands and of those that do it may be doubted whether most of them are not aliens. The genus is closely allied to Gastrochilus chiefly differing in the cone-like flower spike with very broad bracts, the upper ones often differently colored from the lower ones, and as long or longer than the flowers. The rhizome is usually stout and strongly aromatic and bears tubers either sessile or on long stalks, but in the species which frequent our damp and shady jungles it is more slender, and often produces no tubers. Indeed these fleshy tuberous rhizomes appear to be adapted for food stores during the dry seasons, and thus as there are no dry periods in the Malay jungles they are unnecessary. The leaves are borne in tufts on the rhizome and are from two to six or more in a tuft, usually oblong, or oblong ovate with long petioles. The flower spikes are in all our native species produced in the centre of the leaf-\ntuft, and thus belong to the section *Mesantha* of Horaninow. One species of the section *Exantha* with the spike outside the tuft (*C. Zedoaria*) is commonly to be met with round villages, where it is cultivated. The flower spikes are borne on stout stalks and are shorter than the leaves. They have large and broad membranous bracts closely set, in the axils of which are two or more thin textured fugacious flowers, which project usually but little beyond the bract. The flowers open, one or two at a time upon the spike. The calyx is very short cylindrical and toothed. The corolla tube is usually slender enlarged upwards, the petals oblong or ovate oblong, the staminodes very similar and connate with the stamen. The lip broad rounded entire or more or less lobed. The anther, usually large, has in some species a small round crest, in others there is none. In many species it is spurred with curved processes, the use of which has been explained and illustrated by Forbes. (*Wanderings of a Naturalist*, p. 248) where he shows that they act as levers to rotate the anther upon the back of a bee when entering the flower in search of honey so as to deposit the pollen on its back. In these species the anther is moveable upon its filament, but in the other species there is nothing of this arrangement and the anther is not moveable. The fruit which is very rarely produced is a globose capsule with numerous seeds.\n\nSeveral species are cultivated by the Malays, but except *C. longa* L., the turmeric, and *C. Zedoaria*, the Zedoary, only in small quantities, and as several kinds known by Malay names never seem to produce flowers, it is impossible at present to identify them. Of these Temu hitam, rather a small kind, has the rhizome light blue inside, and a taste of Turkey rhubarb, but somewhat bitter and slightly hot. The leaves are rather flaccid dark green and glabrous.\n\nTemu lati, or Temu badoh, is a very much larger kind with deep green leaves the blade over two feet long and five inches wide with an obscure brownish mark in the upper part of the midrib, and the petiole winged, six inches long and half an inch through. The rhizome is very light blue inside and has a musky taste.\n\nTemu pauh has a yellow rhizome with a smell and taste of wild carrots.\nC. Zedoaria Roscoe, Scitamineae t. 109. Curcuma zerumbet Roxb.

It is frequently cultivated and often persists in waste land after cultivation is abandoned and seems to establish itself thoroughly. It frequently grows among lalang and generally flowers there, but it is not easy to flower it in a pot or in really good soil. It is a very handsome plant when in flower, and its foliage is also ornamental. It is said to be wild in the Eastern Himalayas and is cultivated all over the East.\n\nSingapore, common.

In Asia it is much rarer, though one species *C. speciosus* perhaps the finest in the whole genus occurs over the whole of tropical Asia. Two other species occur in the peninsula. It is one of the best marked genera in the whole order. The stems are tall and woody with the leaves arranged in a spiral, and in some species the stem itself grows spirally. Unlike any other genus except the allied *Tapeinocheilus* from New Guinea, the stems frequently branch. The ligule of the leaf forms a complete ring highest at a point nearest to the petiole, below which is sometimes a thin elevated ring fringed with hairs. The spike is terminal or rises directly from the rhizome with stiff sometimes spiny bracts. The calyx is tubular with usually distinct lobes. The corolla tube broad and no longer than the calyx, the lobes large lanceolate or oblong. There are no staminodes, nor styloides. The lip is large obovate, and rolled into a trumpet shape.\n\nThe stamen is very broad and thin with the linear anther cells placed some way down and the apex curved up. The capsule is woody splitting on one side exposing a number of black angular seeds.\n\n*Costus speciosus* Smith. Trans Linn. Soc. i. 249.

Perak, Larut Hills (King's Collector).\n\nThis is very near C. globosus Bl. but is distinguished by its pubescent leaves, narrower more hairy bracts, with less long and sharp points, and orange yellow flowers. The flowers are about three inches long. The lip is not so wide as that of globosus and is edged with hairs.\n\nZINGIBER.\n\nThis genus is very well marked by the curious prolonged point of the anther which occurs in no other genus here. The plants are all comparatively small, the stems being one or two feet tall, with the exception of one or two kinds which attain a height of six feet. The rhizome is usually thick and more or less aromatic. The spikes rise directly from the rhizome in all our species but abnormal forms occur in which they are borne on the ends of the leafy stems. I have seen this in the cultivated ginger Z. officinale L., and in a plant allied to if not identical with Z. gracile. The spikes are cylindrical or conical, with large broad red or yellow bracts, in each of which are one or more flowers. These are yellowish white, sometimes spotted with pink or mottled with black, one or two only open at a time and they last but a day. The calyx is tubular and short. The corolla tube projects but little beyond the bract and the lobes are lanceolate or oblong. The lip is three lobed, the side lobes are turned up and I believe are really the staminodes which are joined to the true lip by their lower edges. The stamen is narrow and prolonged at the top into a long curved beak, which almost touches the lip over which it is curved. The style runs to the end of this beak. The fruit is a thin walled\ncapsule transparent and white and almost hidden in the bracts. When ripe it splits into its three segments and shows the black angled seed covered with a very thin white aril.\n\nThe Zingibers inhabit dense jungles, but two cultivated species can be found in waste ground near villages.\n\nZ.

Staminodes absent, lip large, often very large, and convolute. Stamen broad, with a rounded crest, and two horn-like or linear processes projecting from the upper angles. The style shorter than the crest. The fruit usually a succulent capsule, often covered with processes, and containing a large number of seeds.\n\nThis excludes from the genus as described in the Flora of British India, the genera Hornstelitia (Achasma and Stenochasma), Phaomeria and Cenotophon, and besides several other species such as Amomum biflorum Jack.

Later Blume described some species under the name of *Donacodes*, others he referred to the genus *Elettaria*. Griffith overlooking Retz' work, made two genera *Stenochasma* and *Achasma*, and finally they were all placed under *Amomum* by Bentham and Hooker, who was followed by Baker. I propose to restore Retz' genus and to include also under it the beautiful plants classed as *Phaomeria* Lindl. and *Nico/a* Horan. The genus thus may be described. Plants with tall rarely short leafy stems, often 12 to 15 feet tall. Leaves numerous oblong petioled. Spikes radical on short or long peduncles, with large outer bracts usually red, ovate or oblong, forming a cup or spreading. Bracteoles thin tubular. Flowers sessile numerous. Calyx spathaceous thin. Corolla long or short-tubed, lobes oblong narrow not spreading. Lip narrow often long, linear or narrowly oblong, the sides at the base convolute over the stamen. Stamen short and thick, anther fleshy, bent at an angle with the filament, crest very small or none. Staminodes none. Capsule oblong with thin cartilaginous walls and numerous black seeds, or (section *Phaomeria*) sub-globose with a green fleshy pericarp and bony walls and brown angled seeds. Species about 20 known, scarce in India abundant in the Malay peninsula and the Western part of the Malay archipelago.\n\nSection 1. *Eu-hornstedtia.* Spikes on very short peduncles buried in the ground. Tube of flowers very long, lip long. Fruit concealed in the persistent outer bracts, thin-walled oblong.\n\nSection 2. *Phaomeria.* Spikes on tall peduncles, cone-shaped or cup-shaped. Tube of flowers and lip short. Fruit globose woody the outside green and fleshy, arranged in a ball, the bracts having disappeared.\n\nTo the former section besides those of the Malay peninsula belong *Alpinia linguiforme* Roxb. of India, and apparently from\nthe description, *Elettaria foetens* Bl. *E. minuta*, *E. coccinea* and *E. minor* Bl. *E. pinanga*, *E. rubra*, *E. patudosa*, *E. tomentosa*, Miq. all of Java, but the descriptions published of these are inadequate.\n\nTo the section 2 belong *H. imperialis*, *H.

The peculiar position of the inflorescence is normally unique in the order. The fleshy simple flowers with a crestless anther are certainly more like those of some *Alpinia* than anything else, and Mr. Baker has referred *P. strobilifera* to that genus.\n\n*P. strobilifera* n. sp. *Alpinia strobilifera* Bak.

The rhizome is slender and only slightly aromatic. The\nleaves either solitary, *E. exserta*, *E. Curtisi*ii, or tufted, *E. serpentina*, or borne on an erect stem a foot or more tall. The flower spikes scattered along the creeping branches of the rhizome, are very short, only an inch or two long, and bear several flowers in the axils of dry short bracts. The calyx tube is usually long with three lobes, and the corolla tube long and graceful with narrow lobes. The lip is fairly large entire and rounded, usually white with a central yellow bar with red marks along it. The filament of the stamen is broad and short, the crest of the anther large and rounded, sometimes toothed. The style is slender, increasing above the anther, the stigma conical and rather large. The fruit, which is rarely to be met with, is in *E. longituba* a large round white capsule.\n\nThese plants are to be met with in damp woods often in great abundance, but seldom seen in flower.\n\n**SPECIES.**\n\n| Leaf solitary. | Leaves few in a tuft. | Leaves on an erect stem. |\n|---------------|----------------------|--------------------------|\n| 1. *E. exserta* Bak. | 3. *E. serpentina* Bak. | 4. *E. latiflora* Ridl. |\n| 2. *E.

There can be little doubt that this is the *Amomum* of Griffith on which Baker's *A. elettarioides* was based. His description and drawing *Elettaria* sp. are fairly accurate. The three-lobed anther crest is not very clear however. There is a large rounded lobe at the back behind the stigma and the angle above the anther tips are somewhat drawn out. Jack's *Amomum biflorum* is probably the same thing though he says that the leaves are quite smooth except the midrib. He obtained it in Penang. The pubescent leaves and flowers and short corolla tube hardly longer than the calyx distinguish it from *E. latiflora* to which it is most nearly allied.\n\n*E. longituba* Ridl. Trans. Linn.

The leaves distributed with my plant No. 2403 I find really belong to it as Wray's plant has exactly similar ones. The Bukit Timah plant alluded to in the Trans. Linn.

I found it growing in a dense jungle swamp, the stems creeping through almost liquid mud, decaying leaves and water.\n\nGEOSTACHYS.\n\nRhizome stout woolly, not subterranean, with stout roots. Leafy stems two or three feet tall with lanceolate cuspidate leaves, glabrous, petioled. Scapes lateral usually short decurved so as to lie on the ground (in one species erect). Flowers second, two or three in a dry brown papery bract on a short peduncle, projecting but little from the involute bract. Calyx tubular spathaceous with an entire cuspidate limb, corolla tube shorter than the calyx, thick, lobes oblong as long as the tube, lip entire obovate as long as the corolla. Stamen with a short filament and linear anther with a small rounded crest or none, staminodes none.\n\nThis genus is closely allied to Alpinia with which it was doubtfully placed by Baker under the section Geostachys which I have reserved for its generic name. It differs in the flowers being borne not on the ends of the leafy stems, but in lateral leafless ones, also in the peculiar dry brown bracts which are\nrolled round the flower, and the curious tubular calyx with an ovate limb ending in a long point. The rhizome usually very woody stands above the ground often supported on its roots for some height. The coloring of the flowers in all that I have seen alive is the same, buff yellow, more or less ornamented with red spots. The species *G. elegans* from Mount Ophir, is peculiar in having its inflorescence erect on a slender stem and not lying down upon the ground.\n\n*G. decurvata* n. sp. *Alpinia decurvata* Bak. l.c. p. 257.\n\nA large tufted plant with a stout rhizome.

A very distinct species with tall rather slender scapes, and smaller flowers than any other species. It grows in large tufts on rocks, and in the woods.\n\n**Alpinia.**\n\nThis is a fairly well marked genus, distinct in bearing the flowers in terminal panicles or racemes on tall leafy stems, the flowers numerous often large and showy, the corolla tube usually barely longer than the tubular calyx, the lobes linear or oblong, the lip large obovate rolled round the stamen, (*Catimbium*) or small narrow lobed, (*Hellenia*) staminodes sometimes absent, or horn-like subulate processes rarely broad and spatulate. The stamen long, fleshy, the anther thick, crest absent (*Catimbium*) or well developed (*Cenolophon*). The fruit a globose or cylind-\nric capsule, orange colored, green, or brown, black dry dehiscent pubescent or hairy seeds numerous angled small enclosed in a sweet pithy aril, aromatic.\n\nThe genus is confined to East India, China, and North Australia. Many species are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, some especially A. Galanga and A. officinalis, the Galangals for their aromatic rhizomes. The species have been arranged in four sections, viz., Ethanum, with the buds not enclosed in large bracteoles, and no anther crest, Catimbium with large bracteoles, and no crest, Hellenia with a small anther crest and Geostachys which I would exclude as a distinct genus. This grouping is not however quite satisfactory as it separates closely allied plants, while placing very different species together. Nearly all fall readily into three groups which indeed might be called genera, viz.,\n\n(A). Hellenia. Flowers small, white or pink, lip narrow not convolute often bifid. Anther usually crested. Fruit small globose few-seeded.\n\n(B). Catimbium. Flowers large, lip broad obovate convolute, red and yellow. Anther not crested, fruit globose, large, seeds small numerous.\n\n(C). Cenotophon.

(Feilding.)\n\nThis plant I have not met with in any part of the peninsula but it has long been cultivated in the Singapore Gardens where it grows very readily. There are two forms, one of which is short, with very narrow leaves, and panicles of two or three flowers, and another much stouter with broad leaves, a larger panicle and almost glabrous fruit. The former is the plant figured by Roscoe, the latter is the form collected by Mr Feilding and is the variety figured by Roxburgh. There is no trace of any staminodes. I found a monstrous flower on one plant with two complete polliniferous stamens, and between them a short linear subulate process, in which apparently the normally developed stamen was rudimentary and the two lateral ones developed. This may be compared with Roscoe's *A. difissa* which is probably a specimen of this plant with all the flowers like this.\n\n*A. assimilis* n.sp. *A. mutica* Hook. fil. Bot.

Seeds black angular.\n\nRiver banks and damp spots. Johore, Kota Tinggi. Pahang, Pekan. Penang, Batu Feringgi (Curtis 2766); Province Wellesley Ara Kudah. Pulau Buru (Island South of Singapore).\n\nThis is easily distinguished from *A. mutica* with which it has been confused by the large white bracteoles covering the buds, and the glandular processes at the base of the lip which are distinctly elevated and often of some size and covered especially on the back with stiff silky hairs. The coloring of the flowers and habit of the two plants are quite similar.\n\n**Var. sericea.**\n\nLeaves lanceolate tapering at the base, broader and cuspidate at the apex, scantily pubescent above softly velvety beneath 13 inches long, 3 inches wide, petiole one inch long, ligule very short. Raceme a foot long, rachis silky pubescent, flowers numerous crowded, pedicels inch long silky pubescent. Bracteoles large ovate one inch long and as wide ribbed pubescent, persistent. Calyx short and broad spatheaceous 3 lobed, lobes cuspidate, pubescent. Corolla tube very short and stout, lobes oblong silky \u00bd an inch long blunt. Lip obovate obscurely trilobed an inch long, yellow veined and dotted red apex rounded bilobed, glands at base elevated pubescent.\n\nCult. in Buitenzorg Gardens (No. 3.)\n\nThis plant closely resembles *A. assimilis* but differs in its pubescent velvety leaves, and very short silky calyx and corolla, the bracteole being considerably longer than the calyx which\nagain is longer than the corolla. It should probably be classed specifically distinct, but for the present I prefer to leave it as a variety of *A. assimilis*.\n\n*A. glabra* n.sp.\n\nStem unknown. Leaves lanceolate acute, tapering at base, closely ribbed rather stiff and glabrous, 1\u00bd foot long 3 inches wide petiole 2 to 3 inches finely ribbed, ligule bilobed rounded \u00bc inch long.

Lip oblong boat shaped, apex bifid lobes short blunt, 1\u00bc inch long. Stamnodes short rather thick tapering upwards. Stamen \u00be inch long glabrous, filament rather narrow, crest ovate obtuse quite entire ovary small sub-globose glabrous.\n\nBorneo, Santubong in Sarawak (Dr. Haviland).\n\nThis is very distinct from all the others of this section in its lax panicle with stiff spreading branches, the boat-shaped lip and the oval entire crest. The leaves too are much stiffer in texture and the whole plant is almost completely glabrous.\n\n*A. malaccensis* Roxb. Trans. Soc. Lit.n. VIII 345. is an unfortunately named species. It does not occur here so far as I know but is a native of India. The Javanese and Moluccas plants described as of this species are not *A. malaccensis* but perhaps one of the next two described.\n\n*A. latilabris* n.sp.\n\nWhole plant about 12 feet tall.

Style abruptly recurved at the apex, ovary silky. Capsule globose green. Shady woods and banks.\n\nJohore, Gunong Panti. Malacca very common. Muar (Feilding). Selangor very common especially near Kuala Lumpur. Perak, Larut, Ipoh, (King 2296) Waterloo. Also at Sungei Kalantan, Siak in Sumatra.\n\nThough Baker classes this as near *A. nutans*, Roxb. it is very different in many points. The curious cup-like bracts round the flowers, the hooded petals, the thick nearly cordate anther, and short compact panicle make it quite peculiar. The flowers are fertilized by a brown humble bee, and seldom fail to produce fruit, which is always green, never becoming orange as in other species. It is called Poko Gingin, and Kantan hutan by the Malays. A variety occurs in the Kinta valley at Ipoh and Bujong Malacca in which the flowers are colored as in *A. capitellata* with the calyx, tips of corolla and centre of lip red.\n\n*A. capitellata* Jack Hook. Journ. Bot. i, p. 360.\n\nStems over six feet tall or more one inch through purplish brown pubescent.

A fine plant closely allied to *A. involucrata* but quite unique in its large obconic capitula of flowers, with very large bracts at the base.\n\nJack's description as far as it goes fits this plant very well, but it is not very complete.

Lip longer than corolla flat oblong cuneate bifid at apex edges crispid, orange veined with darker color, and sprinkled with red dots, stamen filament shorter than lip flat pale orange. Crest very large three-lobed toothed. Staminodes two short red horn-like processes.\n\nPanang Hill. Selangor, Dusun Tua.\n\nThis species was first described from a plant sent to Chiswick.\nGardens, and stated to have come from Ceylon, which was evidently an error. It has been referred to *Amomum*; and to a new genus *Cenolophon* apparently on account of the well developed anther crest. It is however in every other respect a typical *Alpinia*. The lip being not rolled up as in most of this genus so as to enclose the stamen, the anther crest is strongly developed so as to direct the fertilizing insect to the nectary.\n\nA specimen labelled *A. Wrayi* from Dr. King evidently belongs to this species, but the description in the Flor Brit. India does not at all agree with *A. vitellinum*, *A. Wrayi* being classed with the crestless Alpinias and compared to *A. calcarata*. I have therefore retained the highly appropriate specific name given by Lindley.\n\n*A. cannaefolia* n. sp.\n\nStem stout 4 or 5 feet tall.

Ridley.\n\nIn putting together these few notes on the habits of some of our reptiles, I would commence by calling attention to the very valuable paper on the Reptiles and Batrachians of the Malay peninsula by Lieut. S. S. Flower, published in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for December, 1896, page 856. This paper gives a list of all species recorded from this country, and I have made much use of it. The earliest important paper on the subject is that by Dr. Cantor, published in 1847, and a good number of kinds mentioned by him have not been met with since. Some were perhaps erroneously identified or wrongly localised, and some perhaps have disappeared. Others, however, have doubtless been overlooked, and that is especially the case in the tortoises, and the smallest lizards. Snakes are often preserved by amateurs, as are the showier lizards, but the other reptiles often escape collection. No better instance of this is that of the big Gavial Tomistoma, which was really first recorded as belonging to our fauna in 1896, by Wray, although it appears to be by no means rare in the Pahang and Perak rivers, and must at times have been the victim of the sportsman long ere this.\n\nTortoises.\n\nThere are several kinds of land tortoises to be met with here, and one of the commonest is the jungle tortoise Geomyda spinosa. It is rather a small tortoise about eight inches long, and of a dull red colour, just the colour of the rotting leaves in the streams of the jungle where it lives. Its head and feet are black, with pink spots. When young the edge of its shell is armed with spiny processes, whence its name, but these disappear as it grows older. It seems never to leave the damper parts of the forests, and is seldom far away from the small streams. These tortoises eat all kinds of vegetable substances, fruit of all kinds and leaves, and I once found two small ones greedily devouring\na fungus. Their tenacity of life is, as in most tortoises, very great. I once brought one from Bukit Timah, where they are common, for the Museum, and on preparing its skeleton it was found that by some accident the carapace had broken clean across, and though the edges had not joined, the damage had been evidently repaired as well as possible some time previously. Afterwards I heard that some visitors to the bungalow had found one of these tortoises and carried it up to the top of the turret, whence it had fallen upon the gravel path, and though it seemed much injured, it managed to creep away, and I have little doubt that this must have been the same tortoise which had thus recovered from this severe injury.\n\n*Cyclemys platynota*, the flat-backed tortoise, is a rather larger animal, recognised by a peculiar flattening on the top of its shell. It is usually a very shabby, disreputable looking animal, with a dirty brown irregular carapace. It is less often noticed, as it is even more aquatic than the jungle tortoise, remaining under water most of its time. It seems to be abundant in the river at Selitar bungalow, where Dr. Hanitsch got several, and it has turned up in the Botanic Gardens, once in the Lake and once in a smaller pond, where it was devouring the waterlilies. In captivity it will eat rice, fish, leaves or fruit.\n\nThe box-tortoise, *Cyclemys amboinensis*, is very common in the rice fields in Malacca, and used to be common in Singapore, but is now getting scarce here, as its haunts are being either drained or cultivated or built on. I have been told that it was formerly plentiful on the ground on which is now the Tanglin Market. It is a very pretty little tortoise with a very round back, black and smooth, the lower carapace yellow, and its head black with a bright yellow band on each side. The end plates of its under shell are jointed upon the others, so that it can close itself entirely within its carapace if alarmed, whence its name of box-tortoise. It is very fond of the water and often remains therein, only projecting its snake-like head above the surface. However, it often leaves the water and rambles about, especially in the evening, in search of food, and I have seen them run over by bullock carts on the roads in Malacca. They are very easily kept and are quite omnivorous, eating fish, boiled\nrice, frogs, fruit, and green vegetables with equal pleasure. They lay rather large, oblong, blunt-ended, white eggs, two or three, or as many as five at a time, which they bury in the sand. The shell is remarkably hard for a reptile's egg, and the eggs, two inches long, are very large for the size of the tortoise.\n\nThe large land-tortoise, *Testudo emys*, does not occur in Singapore, but is not very rare in Perak, especially in the Dindings, and is said to occur in Penang also. I got a very fine female at Telok Sera, in the Dindings, which laid two eggs shortly after I got it. They resembled those of the box-tortoise, but were larger. This tortoise lives in the drier parts of the woods, and does not seem to care about water at all. It eats all kinds of leaves voraciously.\n\nSeveral kinds of snapping-turtles (*Trionyx*) are recorded from the peninsula, but the commonest is *Trionyx cartilagineus*, a very large flat turtle, the shell of which is covered with a leathery, dark gray skin, often marked with olive spots, and which is continued as a flange all round the shell. The head and neck are gray with small yellow spots, and the snout is long and pointed, giving the animal a very ugly appearance; the feet are very thick and powerful, ending in sharp claws.\n\nThese turtles usually live in tidal rivers, but sometimes get into ponds. They rarely leave the water, but may be seen pushing up their heads above the surface from time to time. One was caught in the ditch by the Museum some years ago, and was transferred to the Gardens' lake, where it eventually became very large, and attacked some of the water birds with great ferocity, killing and devouring some flamingoes. It was eventually trapped and destroyed. Though these animals are properly carnivorous, they seem very fond of boiled rice, and the ones in the Garden lake used always to come and feed off the rice put down for the water fowl, and those in captivity are fed for the most part on boiled rice made up in balls. The Chinese are very fond of these turtles, and their flesh fetches a high price in the markets. The Malay name for them is *Labi-Labi*.\n\nThe Chinese have a superstition about tortoises, which they consider emblems of longevity, the tortoise, with the dragon and phoenix being the first three animals in the world when it was created. They catch or buy as many tortoises of\nany kind as they can get, and after writing their name on them release them in a suitable spot. These tortoises are supposed to bear away the sins of the men whose names they bear, and no Chinaman will kill or buy a tortoise so inscribed for fear of being burdened with the sins of some one else. This probably accounts for the appearance of a considerable number of turtles and of the flat-backed tortoises in the Gardens lake, within late years, and the temple of tortoises in Penang is also used as a place of safety for sin-bearing tortoises.\n\nIn the seas round the peninsula four kinds of turtles are to be met with. The well known green turtle, *Chelone mydas*; the Loggerhead, *Thalassochelys caretta*; the Leathery turtle, *Dermatochelys coriacea*; and the Hawks-bill, *Chelone imbricata*. The habits of the green turtle are familiar, from books at least, to every one. It is still common enough along our sandier coasts, and I have often seen it putting up its head above water, especially in the early morning, off Lumut in the Dindings, and elsewhere. It is a vegetable feeder, eating seaweeds, and probably, as seaweed is very scarce in our waters, it also eats the Setul, a grass-like flowering plant, common in muddy spots round the coast. The logger-head is a large turtle which feeds on marine animals, and is recognized by the yellow markings on its head and flippers. It may often be seen just outside Singapore harbour, putting its head above water, and then diving again, remaining a long time under water. The huge leathery turtle, has only once appeared on our coasts, a large specimen now in the Museum having been caught at Tanjong Katong. It is also carnivorous, and like the last-mentioned turtle is uneatable. The Hawk's bill occurs in the neighbouring seas, and I have seen live ones brought into Singapore, but whence I could not discover. Some years ago, while up the Sepang river in Selangor, a good way above tidal waters, I saw a turtle slip off the bank into the river. It swam very fast down stream, pursued by the boatmen, and then turned and came past me quite close. Its paddles were moving very rapidly and it lay right over almost on its side, as if to reduce the amount of friction against the water as much as possible. It eventually got into a deep hole, whence we could not get it out. From what I could see of it, it appeared to be a Hawk's bill.\nCROCODILES.\n\nCrocodiles. The common crocodile is *Crocodilus porosus*. Cantor mentions *C. palustris*, the Mugger of India, as occurring in Penang, but as being less common than the other kind. Lieut. Flower has seen a young specimen from Singapore in the British Museum and Mr. Butler has got one in Selangor. This crocodile is distinguished by its shorter and broader snout, and by having five teeth in its premaxilla, and not four only as the common kind has. It seems also on the whole to be a smaller animal.\n\nThe common crocodile varies in colour, being sometimes black and yellow, at others entirely black. The Malays consider the yellow variety as being the most dangerous. This species is strictly speaking a tidal river or marine animal. It seldom goes far up rivers beyond tidal waters, and it sometimes goes very far out to sea. I saw the skull of one at Cocos Island, which had turned up there some months before my visit, and which must have swam at least 200 miles in the sea ere reaching the islands. They sometimes leave the water and go for some distance inland, apparently trying to get across from one river to another. I saw one which had just been killed in a coffee estate near the caves at Kwala Lumpur, where it had been found wandering about among the coffee, at no great distance from the river, however. Of the ferocity and cunning of this, our most dangerous wild beast, there is no need to write, it is too well known; but I will mention one incident concerning it. Some years ago, a Malay forest-guard was in a mangrove swamp at low tide, the water where he stood being only a foot deep, when a crocodile suddenly rose out of the mud on its hind legs and bit him on the elbow. The man tore his arm out of its mouth, and it rushed off. The Malays' theory on the subject was that the man was standing on or close to the animal's nest, but it seems curious that the crocodile should be buried in the mud in such a manner, and that it should spring at his arm and not bite him on the leg, which would be the nearest part to him. In captivity the crocodile is rather a stupid animal, but a young one kept in the Gardens has learnt to come out of the water for a piece of meat when whistled to.\nOf the habits of the Gavial, *Tomistoma Schlegeli*, but little is known at present. It occurs in the Perak and Pahang rivers, where, above Kwala Tembeling, I have seen tracks on the sand banks probably of this species. Sportsmen far up the larger rivers should keep a look-out for this animal, as well as for the Mugger, for it may be much more widely distributed than at present appears.\n\n**Lizards.**\n\nOur largest land lizard is the Monitor, *Biawak* of the Malays, often erroneously called an Iguana here, *Varanus salvator*. This animal attains a length of seven feet, but its tail forms a large proportion of that length. It always lives near water, either river or pond, or the sea, in which it quickly takes refuge when pursued. It dives very well, and remains a long time under the water. If it is unable to get into water, it will quickly climb a tree when alarmed. It gallops at a great pace when frightened, though very clumsily, and the noise it makes dashing through the bushes is out of all proportion to its size. When cornered, it defends itself by lashing out with its tail, and making a fussing noise like a spitting cat. It also bites very fiercely. It is carnivorous, feeding on birds, rats, fish and insects, often attacking poultry. When a rat is given to it, it seizes it in its mouth and shakes it like a dog, then after biting its body all the way down till all the bones are broken, swallows it whole. In captivity I have never heard it make any noise but the spitting sound, but Malays have told me that a loud barking ha-ha-ha which I have heard in swamps is the cry of the Biawak. The eggs are large and white, with a soft shell like that of a turtle, and are deposited in holes in sandy ground and covered up. I once found at Bruas, in the Dindings, a monitor laying its eggs in a shallow hole. The Malays, however, have a story that the effect that when the eggs of a crocodile hatch, all the young ones which go towards the water become crocodiles and those which run on the land become Monitors.\n\nBesides the common Monitor, *V. salvator*, there are three other kinds to be met with here. *V. flavescens*, Penang and Jelebu; *V. nebulosus*, Penang and Malacca; and *V. rudicollis*, Malacca. These are all smaller than the common kind.\nThe pretty sand lizard, *Liolepis Bellii*, about a foot long, and beautifully ornamented with blue and red, is very common on the sandy plains of the Pahang river, and I have also seen it in Malacca, at Pengkalan Kumpas, and at Bruas, in the Dindings. It can be seen sitting in the sun in the heat of the day, sunning itself, but never far from its hole, into which it darts with surprising rapidity.\n\nThe Chamaeleon Lizard, *Calotes cristatellus*, is very common in all gardens. Its ordinary colour is bright green, but when vexed it turns to a dusky brownish colour, whence its popular name. When alarmed it runs very fast on the ground, holding up its long whip-like tail, to the nearest tree or post, up which it climbs, and if this is not high enough to be safe, springs on to a higher one. If a human being happen to be in its way, it does not delay to run up to his shoulder or head and jump off from there. The distance it can jump from tree to tree is very considerable, having regard to the size of the animal. It generally lays two eggs at a time, but Lieut. Flower found females of another species, with as many as seven or eight eggs in them; the eggs are about an inch long, narrow cylindrical blunt at both ends, and enlarged rather abruptly in the middle. They are white and leathery. The lizard places them side by side on the ground in a damp spot and leaves them, not attempting to conceal them. If attacked by a dog the *Calotes* runs for a short distance, and then turns and rushes at its enemy with open mouth, springing at its nose and biting sharply, but is soon tired out and killed. In spite of its teeth and the spines that protect its head and neck, it frequently falls a victim to the attacks of sparrow-hawks and snakes, and the Monitor is also very fond of it. The Malays hold it somewhat in horror, as being one of the forms in which wizards send out their imps to annoy their enemies.\n\nThe flying lizard, *Draco volans*, is at times very common. It appears to move about in flights, for while perhaps for some months hardly any are to be seen, at other times one may see half a dozen in a morning. They appear usually in the hottest part of the day, sailing from tree to tree, always selecting trees with grey smooth bark of the same colouring as themselves. Furthermore they nearly always choose the same trees for their\nroute, so that when they appear in the Gardens one knows exactly which tree one will find them on. When they alight on a tree they run up, puffing out and contracting the conical pouch in the throat, which is bright yellow in the male and blue in the female, and licking up the ants, which form their chief food. When they have climbed sufficiently high, they spring off again spreading the wings (which are expansions of skin on the elongated ribs) after they are in the air, and closing them as they alight. Though they usually go in straight lines, they can swerve in their flight, apparently by lying slightly over on one side or the other. I have seen one avoid a bush which was in its line of flight in this way. The distance that they can cover depends on the height from the ground of the point from which they spring, for as in the case of all animals that fly in this manner (the flying squirrel and flying lemur), they descend in their flight; but the longest flight I have measured was twenty-five yards, from a height of not more than fifteen. These animals are able to change colour, as the Calotes does, the blue ornamental patch on the head disappearing, and the whole lizard becoming of a brown hue, except the pouch, which retains its colour.\n\nD. volans is by far the commonest species here, but there are four or five other kinds to be met with, which generally occur in thick forests, and are very difficult to collect, as they very quickly fly out of reach, and can only be obtained with the gun.\n\nThe common Scinc, Mabuia multifasciata, a stout brown metallic lizard, ornamented with a glowing red patch along the side just below the head, is very abundant in the grass and along drains, creeping about when the sun is bright and hiding in holes and under roots when alarmed. When closely pursued by a dog, the Scinc will sometimes take to a tree, climbing up well out of reach, and when roughly handled it sheds its tail, as do the Geckos, the tail skipping about very actively for some minutes after it drops. It readily takes to water, diving in when frightened and remaining a long time below the surface. Besides this common Scinc, there are one other Mabuia and seven smaller scincs of the genus Lygosoma recorded from the peninsula, most of which are either very scarce or difficult to find or very\nlocal. One, *L. jerdonianum*, seems to be absolutely confined to Pulau Tikus in Penang, having never been seen anywhere else. Every one in the tropics soon makes the acquaintance of the House Geckos, and the habits of these useful little insect killers are well known, and have often been described, but it does not seem to be generally known that at least eight species belong ing to four genera inhabit our houses. In some houses the common one is *Gekya mutilata*, a very pale colored and rather small kind, in others the large dark brown *Gecko Monarchus* takes its place, or drives it at all events out of the verandah, which is evidently considered the best feeding ground by the house geckos. In other houses again quite different ones appear. The Siamese Tokay, *Gecko verticillatus*, a large kind with an exceedingly powerful voice, has been recorded from the peninsula, and even from Singapore, but this latter locality must be very dubious. We have, however, another very loud voiced one (probably *G. stentor*) in the forests, where it lives in hollow trees, and utters a very loud call.\n\nBesides these house geckos, there are a number of jungle geckos, which live in holes in trees or under bark, only appearing at dusk. A very odd little one, *Gonatodes kendalli*, lives in cracks and holes under large rocks in the Bukit Timah woods. It is dark brown, and has an unusually long tail, which it often carries over its back coiled up like a watch spring when it runs.\n\n**Snakes.**\n\nThe ordinary visitor to the tropics is filled with a nervous horror of snakes, always expecting to find most deadly kinds in the house or to be attacked by them if he sets foot outside. He conceives it his duty to slaughter all, even the most harmless and useful species, as soon as he sees them. Nor is his opinion altered by conversation with Malays, who assure him that even the most inoffensive of them are horribly deadly. Malays have pulled me back in horror when I was picking up a little *Typhlops*, a snake about the size of a moderate-sized earth worm, with a mouth too small even to nip a portion of one's skin, assuring me that it was a most venomous animal. The visitor, however, if of an observant turn of mind, discovers ere long that poisonous snakes are comparatively rare, and that cases of dangerous\nsnake-bite are exceedingly rare, and the risk of injury from snakes is so infinitesimal that it may be utterly neglected as one of the dangers of the tropics. Cases of death from snake-bite are from time to time recorded, but, usually at least, the snake is not identified, sometimes not even seen, and it is clear that there has been a good deal of guessing as to the cause of death. Good records of cases by persons who know the poisonous snakes by sight would be very useful. Death from snake-bite in India seems to be remarkably common, why should it be so rare here? The only really probable suggestion I have heard was made by a native who had lived in India, who pointed out that while in India the snakes mostly live on the ground, here they live high up in the trees, and there is a good deal in this; I have seen the green viper and hamadryad both brought down from the tops of trees forty feet high. Squirrels and tupaias, some of the rats, as also the birds on which these animals mostly live, reside high up and seldom come to the ground, and the snakes pursue them there, while the hamadryad pursues the other snakes. Another fact seems to be clear, which is that some snakes, notably the green viper, imagined to be very deadly, is indeed not nearly as dangerous as it is supposed to be, but of this more anon. It may, however, be pointed out that the most destructive of the Indian snakes are the cobra, the Tropidophis or Daboia and the Krait. The two latter are absent from the peninsula, and the Cobra does not seem to be very dangerous here.\n\nI should hardly have thought it worth while to allude to the serpent fascination myth, except that recently, at the British Association, a paper was read to disprove the popular error that snakes fascinate or mesmerise their prey before catching it. Anyone who has ever kept snakes knows that nothing of the kind ever happens, but like the theory of the imitative powers of apes and the fiction that the man-eating tiger is invariably an old animal which has lost its teeth, these popular errors seem to take an unaccountably long time to die. Snakes either quietly creep up to their prey, and seize it when asleep or resting, or wait in likely spots for the prey to come to them. Many, especially the larger snakes, are nocturnal or hunt only in the twilight, when their prey can hardly see them. The smaller insect-\neating snakes chiefly work by day. Most snakes are colored for concealment, and inhabit spots suited for their coloring. The green viper (*Lachesis Wagleri*) sits usually about 4 or 5 feet high in a bush, in a sunny spot, where its blue-black, green and yellow mottling is matched by the spots of light and shade on the bright green leaves. The python, again, with its light and dark brown carpet pattern, resting among dead leaves, or in the hollow of a tree, is equally inconspicuous; even poisonous snakes, which sometimes are very gay with warning colors, are by no means as conspicuous as they appear. The beautiful *Elaps bivirgatus*, with its scarlet head and tail and deep blue body, is wonderfully invisible in the shadows of the woods, but when in danger it exhibits its brilliant coloring as plainly as it can, in order to warn the enemy that it is venomous, and can give a fatal bite if it chooses. *Callophis* is another genus of poisonous snakes that is brightly colored. In danger, however, it does not trust to its warning colors only, but beats its tail quickly on the dead leaves, making a rattling sound. A terrier which came upon one of these small snakes, and was about to kill it, stopped at once when the snake began to rattle its tail, and went away, evidently understanding the signal. *Bungarus* again, a large and dangerous black and yellow snake, makes the same kind of rattling. A poisonous snake will not as a rule waste its poison on an animal it cannot swallow, and naturally prefers to drive its enemy off by frightening it, if it can.\n\nSnakes, like many of our wild animals here, know very well the conspicuity of motion, and when crossing an open space such as a road, where they are visible from some distance, usually remain perfectly motionless if an enemy comes in sight and they have no time to get into shelter. This is why they are more often seen on roads by persons driving or walking than elsewhere. Being alarmed when crossing from wood to wood, they remain motionless for some time, in the hope that they may be taken for a root or piece of stick. I have seen a terrier, who invariably pursues snakes when she sees them, jump over one lying on the path, mistaking it for a stick. Had it moved, she would have immediately killed it.\n\nThere are no less than one hundred and ten kinds of snakes recorded as occurring in the peninsula, and more than half of\nthese have been found in Singapore. A number have only been collected once or twice, and some of the records may be considered doubtful, but as only a small part of the peninsula has been yet collected in, we may expect large additions as time goes on.\n\nOne of the commonest is the Python (*P. reticulatus*), the Ular Sawah of the Malays. It is perhaps the largest snake in the world, a specimen measuring 40 feet having been reported as obtained by a scientific expedition in Manila. Pythons of 20 feet in length are by no means uncommon here, and specimens of 26 feet are occasionally met with, but accurate measurements of larger ones are still required. The python is nocturnal in its habits, remaining concealed under bushes or fallen logs during the day, and wandering about at night in search of food. It eats squirrels and rats and birds, and often makes its way into a hen-house, where it not only eats half a dozen or more chickens in a night, but usually kills more than it eats. The larger ones will also eat dogs and cats, goats and pigs. A snake a little over seventeen feet long ate two black swans on the garden lake at the rate of one a month, and I have had a python of about 15 or 16 feet long brought me, which had just swallowed twelve ducks. On one occasion five pythons were put together into a large cage. The biggest was a little over nineteen feet long, another was between 17 and 18 feet, and the other three were from 12 to 15 feet in length. The biggest snake ate all the three smaller ones in two nights, and attacked the remaining one, which however succeeded in beating it off, not without being wounded. But although they are sometimes very voracious, they will often go without food for a very long period. A large one, twenty feet long, was fed on a good sized pariah dog, after which it refused food for nine months, when it passed the remains of the dog, and began to feed again. Another remained for seven months without food, in the same manner. Smaller snakes feed oftener, usually once a month, and sometimes even oftener than that. A hungry python strikes its prey with lightning-like rapidity, usually seizing it by the head, if it is small enough, in which case the animal or bird is killed by the crushing of the head. It then, turning its head down, encloses the prey in a coil and a half and proceeds to swallow it slowly. In the case of fairly large animals, and those that are not killed by\ncrushing the head, the prey is crushed by the coils. In the case of a swan swallowed by a fair sized python, the head was crushed, evidently by the first bite, but the bones of the body were not broken at all, although the bird was very much thicker than the python. In some books it is stated that the prey is smothered in the coils, but as a matter of fact, the bite of the python is severe enough to cause instant death in most of the smaller victims, and the contraction of the coils crushes the larger ones. The main use of the coils in the case of small animals and birds is apparently partly to hinder their struggling, and partly to push the carcase into the proper position for swallowing, and to assist the deglutition by pressing the food against the other coils and the ground. It is only when the prey has almost disappeared down its throat that the snake straightens itself out. The Chinese eat the flesh of the Python, and the fat, of which there is usually a good deal, is a popular native medicine. In colour the python varies somewhat, young and half-grown specimens being often almost golden yellow. I have also seen a very dark, almost black variety.\n\n*P. molurus*, the Indian python, is recorded from the peninsula, but I have not seen it.\n\n*P. curtus*, the little red python, formerly considered very rare, does not seem to be so in the peninsula. It is quite small for a python, only 8 or 9 feet long usually. It is a quiet snake in captivity and seems chiefly to feed on rats.\n\nThe little burrowing snakes, *Typhlops*, are to be found in rotten cocoanut palms, and other trees, in the sawdust of the saw mills, and in the ground. A great number of kinds have been described, but they are very difficult to identify. Our commonest species is *Typhlops braminus*. It is usually about four inches long, and very slender, with a very small head, and minute eyes, and a sharp-pointed tail. Its colour is lavender grey, or black, and it is very active, wriggling like a worm when disturbed.\n\n*Cylindrophus rufus* is another burrowing snake, but is much larger, about a foot long. It is black, with white bands beneath, some red on its neck, and a bright red tip to its tail. It is short and thick, and has an odd habit of flattening itself out, and turning up the tip of its tail. It is common in gardens, burrowing in the ground.\nChersydrus granulatus Schn. is a short thick blunt-nosed snake, alternately banded with dirty brown and white. It seems to be rare here, only two specimens being recorded from the peninsula, in Flower's list. One was recently brought to me which had been found in the road near the gardens. As it is an aquatic snake which lives on fish, it is probable that it was attempting to cross from some ditch which had dried up from the very hot weather, in order to find another wet spot.\n\nThere are many very pretty harmless tree-snakes, slender long-tailed reptiles, often gaily coloured. They usually creep about in bushes at no great height from the ground, moving very briskly when disturbed. Such are the snakes of the genera Dendrophis, Dendrelaphis and Dryophis.\n\nDendrelaphis caudolineatus is a very common kind, brown with a bright yellow band down its side. It seems more or less gregarious, as I have seen three in one bush. When annoyed I have noticed it emits an appalling odour of carrion.\n\nThe little snakes of the genera Ablabes and Simotes, though allied to Dendrelaphis, are generally to be met with creeping on the ground, or concealed beneath logs or stones. They never seem to climb into trees, and being terrestrial are usually dull brown, sometimes marked with red. Simotes purpurascens, which I got from the Bukit Timah road, was dark brown with large distant red spots and a bright red belly. S. signatus I found under a pile of tiles in the garden. It was also dull brown. S. octolineatus, which is perhaps the commonest kind, is a bigger and gayer-coloured animal, brown or yellow with eight black lines running its whole length, a red bar down its back and a red belly.\n\nA very interesting and common snake is Macropisthodon rhodomelas, a slender terracotta red snake, usually about a foot long, with a curious bluish triangle on its neck in a black V, and a black line down its back. It is often to be seen gliding through the grass or across paths in the daytime. Its peculiarity is its means of defence. When vexed, it sits up after the manner of a cobra, and seems to flatten out its neck as if it was trying to imitate that species, while from the bluish patch on its neck are exuded some drops of a white viscid liquid representing the well-known cobra marks. I noticed that my dog, seizing this\nsnake in its mouth to worry it, presently foamed at the mouth, as if he had been licking a toad, and soon dropped the snake. I tasted the exudation, and found it bitter, but it had no effect on my salivary glands. It is evident, however, that it must act as a deterrent on its enemies, and perhaps the cobra-like habit of sitting up may also alarm an animal about to attack it, but I must admit the actual resemblance to a cobra is not really very great. This snake possesses two very long glassy fangs at the back of its mouth, which might lead persons to suppose that it is venomous, but the poison fangs of a dangerous snake are in the front of the mouth, and *Macropisthodon*, though it can bite sharply, is not poisonous.\n\nThere are a good many snakes of the type usually popularly known as Rat-snakes, and Water-snakes, several of which attain a considerable size, seven or eight feet long. The black ones such as *Coluber melanurus*, which I have found under a pile of rotten boards, are often mistaken for cobras and promptly slain, whereas as rat-killers they might be encouraged. *C. taeniurus*, the cave snake, which I described in the last number of the Journal, has been recently caught by Mr. Rostados at Kota Tinggi, in Johore, far away from any caves or rocks, and this specimen is certainly more of the olivaceous colour described by Boulenger, and not so white as that of the caves.\n\n*Dipsadomorphus dendrophilus* is a common and very beautiful harmless snake of considerable size. It usually lives in mangrove swamps, where it sits coiled up on the branches waiting for birds or rats. Its colouring is an intense glossy black with bright yellow bands, and in this it resembles the deadly *Bungarus fasciatus*, also a mangrove-haunting snake, but whether this can be classed as a genuine case of mimicry or is only an accidental resemblance it would be hard to say. It is a very quiet snake, and becomes quite tame very shortly after capture. One captured on the Sirangoon river, where it is very abundant, laid four rather large oblong white eggs, soon after it was caught. The Malays call it Ular ranke or Ular chin-chin mas.\n\n*D. cynodon* is another common species, about five feet in length. There are two colour forms of this, which look so different that one would hardly recognize them as the same. In one the body is bright brown with darker blotches and a yellow\nthroat. I caught a fine one on Gunong Keledang in Perak, among thick fern. The other form is almost black with a few yellow marks about its head. One was brought me by a small Malay boy from Tanglin village, where he declared it had been killing the fowls.\n\n*Zaocys carinata* is a large harmless snake, of which I caught a very fine specimen, about eight feet long, after a considerable chase. It was almost completely black, but there are also light-coloured varieties. It moves very rapidly, and I could hardly keep up with it though I was running on the path and it was gliding through the scrub. The Malays called it *Ular Tedong*, but this name is applied apparently to a variety of snakes.\n\nThe green tree-snake, *Dryophis prasinus*, the *Ular Daun* of the Malays, is another of our very common snakes. Usually of a bright apple-green, with its long slender whip-like body and its pointed snout, it is easily recognised. It is readily tamed, though when fresh caught it is apt to be snappish. There are two or three colour varieties, the commonest of which next to the green one is light brown, but I have also seen a form banded alternately grey and white. It feeds chiefly I believe on frogs and lizards. I found one on an occasion trying to swallow a Calotes in spite of the thorny spikes on its back. The Malays say that if you take the fat of this snake and make a lamp with it and a floating wick, on lighting this in the evening, the whole room or house becomes full of these green snakes, and this diversion is sometimes employed on festal occasions. My informant told me that he had seen this done with perfect success.\n\nNo less than thirty-one poisonous snakes are recorded from the Peninsula, but nearly half of these are sea snakes. Very little is known as to the habits of these latter. They are generally taken out of the fishing stakes, where they doubtless go in pursuit of the fish, on which they live.\n\n*Bungarus fasciatus* has already been alluded to. It is a fairly large powerful snake, of a black colour with yellow bands. It is almost always found near the sea, in tidal waters. In captivity it is vicious and ill-tempered, striking about freely and furiously rattling its tail.\n\nThe Cobra is well-known to residents, being quite a common garden snake. The specimens met with in the south of the\nTHE HABITS OF MALAY REPTILES.\n\npeninsula are nearly always inky black, further north they are brown. I have never seen a brown one in Singapore, nor a black one in Penang or Province Wellesley. They appear to be much smaller than the Indian form, a specimen over five feet long being unusual. When annoyed the Cobra sits up in the well-known manner, and makes a very curious snorting noise, holding its mouth open in the form of a circle, and every now and then spitting its saliva at its opponent, whence its name Naia sputatrix. It never attempts to bite, but spits with great accuracy. One struck me all over the face at a distance of eight feet, and a student of snakes, who was not aware of this habit in our local variety, was struck in the eye by one he was examining; the saliva, which produces only a slight irritation of the skin of the face, causing some amount of inflammation in the eye, which did not subside for some hours. I have also seen a dog struck in the eye by the saliva, while attacking a cobra, much to his discomfiture. When cornered and defending himself, the cobra is very quick in turning the raised part of the body, which it throws forward for a considerable distance, to deter its enemy, but if left alone, glides away as quickly as it can, taking refuge under a log, or in a hole. It is nocturnal in its habits, remaining in its hole all day, unless disturbed. It generally feeds on mice and toads, but I once found one eating a small snake (Macropisthodon). In captivity it is quiet, and usually gentle.\n\nThe Hamadryad (Naia bungarus or Ophiophagus elaps), though not an exceedingly common snake, is probably better known by reputation to residents than any other. It is the biggest of all our poisonous snakes, attaining a length of 13 feet, and is proportionately stout. In colour it is usually a pale brown, without any markings, and as it does not sit up so often as the cobra does, when in danger, and the large poison glands, so conspicuous in many venomous snakes, are not very clearly visible, it is often mistaken for a harmless snake. Its plain brown colour, the large plates on its blunt head, and when irritated, its erect attitude and expanded hood easily distinguish it. It is commonly reported to be very aggressive and to pursue people who irritate it. I have never seen this myself, and it certainly requires further proof. As is well known, it feeds, generally at least, on other snakes, and I have caught one in the act of swallowing a small\npython. Although the Indian Hamadryad is easily kept in confinement in England, I have never been able to keep one very long here. It refuses all food, not only its natural food of snakes, but also eggs and milk, which almost every other snake will lick up. The Hamadryad is less common in Singapore now than formerly, I believe, but is occasionally taken. Four or five have been taken in the gardens within the past six or seven years, one about eight feet in length having been caught here last September, but it is fairly abundant in other parts of the peninsula.\n\nThe beautiful scarlet and blue Doliophis bivirgatus is not common in Singapore. I have only once seen it here, but it is plentiful in the hill woods, where it may be seen basking in the sun on the paths. It occurs in Penang, Malacca, Province Wellesley, Selangor, the Bindings and Kedah, as well as Singapore.\n\nOf the Vipers, by far the commonest is Lachesis Wugleri, a vicious looking, but handsome snake, mottled with green, dark blue, yellow and black. Its large flat head, shaped like the ace of spades, and narrow yellow eyes, give it a wicked appearance. It is generally about two feet and a half in length when full grown, and is thick in proportion to its length. It is an arboreal snake, sitting very quietly upon the boughs of trees or bushes, where it catches rats and birds. Young specimens are often plain dull green with a few distant reddish spots, and do not at all resemble the common form. I have seen a female viper opened which contained several young ones, of which all but one were coloured like the adult, while the remaining one was of the plain green form. It occurs all over the peninsula. When annoyed it opens its mouth exceedingly wide, showing its poison fangs, but it is very slow and stupid, creeping away in a leisurely manner. It has a great reputation as a very deadly snake, which I have reason to believe is hardly justified. I have seen one strike a java sparrow on the thigh, producing a considerable flow of blood. The sparrow flew to the end of the cage but showed no signs of poisoning, and remained quite lively till the snake pursued it again and caught it by the head and killed it. A cooly stepped on a young green viper about a foot long, which bit him on the toe. I was not informed of this for over an hour, when I went to see him and found his leg a good deal swollen and he was suffering a good deal of pain, but after rubbing his leg and\ntreating the bite with permanganate of potash, he very soon got better and was well in a couple of hours. In fact the bite was no worse than that of a centipede. A good sized pariah dog was bitten on the thigh by a full grown and large sized green viper. The wound bled a good deal, and the dog uttered a cry and ran off, but in an hour or two it reappeared none the worse. I have also seen two cases in which coolies stated they had been bitten by green vipers, and in one certainly saw the snake (also a young one), which was said to have bitten the man, but in neither case were there any of the serious symptoms of snake bite; and as the green viper when it bites holds on tight for some time, and does not merely strike without closing his mouth as the cobra does, it must inject a good quantity of the saliva into the wound; wherefore I conclude the animal is not as deadly as it is reputed to be. Fayrer in \"Thanatophidia\" in writing of *L. gramineus* quotes from Russell and Blyth, both of whom had seen cases of men bitten by green vipers who merely suffered from pain and swelling and recovered, and Russell, experimenting with the poison of this species, found that it killed birds, but that pigs and dogs recovered, so that it may be doubted that any of these vipers are truly deadly. *L. Wagleri* lives very well in captivity, and is quite gentle and very sluggish. Young animals live chiefly on geckos, the bigger ones eat rats and birds, and it is surprising what large rats they will eat. I have given one a large dead rat with its arms stretched stiffly out and quite rigid, but the viper managed to swallow it quite easily getting the sides of its mouth round the projecting arms most skilfully.\n\nThe other green coloured viper (*Lachesis gramineus*) of a plain green colour with a reddish tip to its tail, was apparently much more common in Singapore formerly than it is now, for while looking over the collection of serpents in the British Museum I noticed that there were many specimens of this snake, all from early collectors, and very few *L. Wagleri*. Now, however, *L. gramineus* is quite rare. I have only met with one or two, while *L. Wagleri* is, as I have said, very common.\n\nThe purple viper *L. purpureo-maculatus*, not a very plentiful snake, seems always to reside on the sea-shore, hiding under rocks or basking in the sun. It is of a very deep purple brown colour, nearly black. I have caught it on the shore at Toas, and\nseen it from Blakang Mati.\n\nTwo other vipers, *L. sumatranus* and *L. monticola*, are also reported from Singapore and Penang, but they appear to be very rare here.\n\nThere can be no doubt that snakes are much scarcer in Singapore than formerly, and this is no doubt due to clearing of much of the jungle, and especially the constant burning of the Lalang, but still a great variety remain here, and some kinds are still remarkably abundant, and those by no means always of the smaller kinds.\n\nIt is rather interesting to observe the behaviour of various animals at the sight of snakes. Common monkeys are usually very excited, crowding together to look at it, and chattering loudly. The Mias, who usually inhabit trees taller than snakes are accustomed to ascend, seems to take no notice of one. The binturong, on bringing a cobra near it, turned its face away as if in horror, but really no doubt recognizing that its most vulnerable portion was its face. The Water Mongoose, *Herpestes brachyurus*, like the Indian Mongoose, bristles up its fur and attacks and devours the snake. Some deer, when a large python was brought past their paddock, though at some distance, crowded together at the bars, gazing at it and stamping their feet, evidently recognizing it as a dangerous enemy.\n\nI append a list of our reptiles as far as at present known, based on Mr. Flower's list already referred to, with the addition of later captures and have added all recorded localities.

Takakusu, a Japanese scholar, and was published in 1896 by the Oxford Clarendon Press. The author, who visited the Malay Archipelago in the winter of A.D. 671-2 and remained for some time in Sumatra, speaks of the Mo-lo-yu country as being one of the islands of the South Sea in which Buddhism then prevailed. He fixes its position by telling us that it lay to the west of Shih-li-fo-shih (Sri Bhoja or Bhoja), which place appears to be certainly identified with the San-bo-tsai of other Chinese chroniclers and the Sarbaza of the Arabian geographers of the 9th century. I Tsing tells us that Sri Bhoja had, in his time or shortly before his visit, annexed the Mo-lo-yu country.\n\nSri Bhoja was at this time a great centre of Buddhism, and I Tsing's object in visiting it was to study the sacred Canon and the Sanskrit language. After a stay of six months, he went on to the Mo-lo-yu country and then to India, but about A.D. 688 he returned to Sri Bhoja, and remained there about six years, so that he had ample opportunity for becoming acquainted with the circumstances of the country. From other sources* this\n\n* See especially Groeneveldt's \"Notes on the Malay Archipelago,\" etc., Essays on Indo-China, etc. 2nd series, vol. 1.\nplace Sri Bhoja, San-bo-tsai, Sarbaza, etc., as it is variously called, has been identified with almost absolute certainty as being situated on the Palembang river in South-eastern Sumatra; and the Mo-lo-yu country can therefore be confidently regarded as placed immediately to the west or north-west, that is to say about the middle of Sumatra. I Tsing, who stayed in the Mo-lo-yu country for two months on his way to India, says that it was fifteen days' sail from Bhoja, the capital of Sri Bhoja; and it must have been situated approximately under the Equator, for in the middle of the eighth month and in the middle of spring the sun cast no shadow there at noon. Moreover it was half-way on the route between Bhoja and Ka-cha (a place in or near Achin or Kedah, more probably the former, as it was south of the country of the Naked People, i.e., the Nicobar and Andaman islands). From Ka-cha ships sailed in thirty days to Nagapatana (Negapatam), and I Tsing himself took ship there for Tamralipti (Tamluk), a port near the mouth of the Hooghly.\n\nIt seems therefore that the Mo-lo-yu country was not at this time a purely inland State, but had a coast line on the Straits more or less opposite to where Malacca now stands.\n\nThe language of the Mo-lo-yu country was that which served as a lingua franca in the Archipelago generally, and was known to I Tsing and other Chinese authors as the K'un-lun language. This term was derived, apparently, from the Chinese name of Pulau Condor, on the same principle on which slaves from these regions are often mentioned in Chinese chronicles as K'un-lun slaves, from whatever part of the Archipelago they might have actually been imported. The reason seems to have been that the Pulau Condor people were the first of the Southern islanders to come into contact with the Chinese, who afterwards loosely extended the term to the inhabitants of the Archipelago generally. This appears to be the meaning of the explanation I Tsing gives when, speaking of the Archipelago as a whole and after enumerating some of the principal islands, he goes on to say, \"They were generally known by the general name of 'Country of K'un-lun' since (the people of) K'un-lun first visited Kochin and Kwangtung.\"\n\nThat the language was really Malay appears from the fact that the \"pin-lang fruit\" is mentioned by I Tsing as being used\nin the Sri Bhoja country and other islands of the Archipelago for chewing with nutmegs, cloves and Barus camphor, for the purpose of rendering the mouth fragrant. Pin-lang is of course the Malay word pinang, areca nut.\n\nIn I Tsing's time, it seems therefore that the Malay country par excellence was in Central Sumatra, a fact agreeing very well with native Malay tradition on the subject, which derives the origin of many of the Malays of the Peninsula from the old Central Sumatran State of Menangkabau.\n\nThe etymological signification of the national name Malaya has been a subject of much dispute. I Tsing does not throw any additional light upon it; but he makes it quite clear that the word had in his time a local significance, and denoted the particular region from which a large part of the Malays of the modern Tanah Malaya love to trace their origin.\n\nC. O. Blagden.\n\n---\n\nThe Putri Gunong Ledang.\n\n(Fairy Princess of Mt. Ophir.)\n\nThe following extract from an essay written by a Malacca Chinese boy may be of interest to readers of the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. I give the boy's own words.\n\nThe aborigines of Malacca used to believe that Mt. Ophir was a sacred mountain. Mt. Ophir is also believed to be so by the Malays, as well as by most of the Strait-born Chinese. Since many years ago, neither Malays nor Chinese have ever reached the top of the mountain, where, as our ancestors say, there is plenty of gold strewn along the floor. Although some of the Europeans have been there, yet the natives have not believed it. It is said that there is a fairy who takes charge of the sacred mountain. In the morning, as the sun rises, the fairy is a beautiful girl playing near her well-built hut. At noon, as the sun is right over our head, the girl changes into a maiden; and in the evening, as the sun sets, the maiden becomes an old woman. The same thing happens every day.\nThere is also a sacred tiger possessed by the fairy as her sole guardian of the mountain. It always sits half-way down the mountain. As most of the uneducated are superstitious, they believe that there is also a kind of plant grown near the house of the fairy, and any one who gets a leaf from that plant and eats it, besides being always young and beautiful, will never die. Many of the ancient people of Malacca attempted to get some of the leaves, and many lost their lives in the attempts because of their absurdity.\n\nThis story was first told by a Malay who accidentally reached the top of the mountain. One day while cutting wood with some of his companions he was accidentally separated from them and was left alone in the forests. What was his alarm when he saw a tiger; and being unable to get rid of the wild beast, he fell on the ground and fainted. He was carried to the fairy, and being a worshipper, as people were in those days, he was well treated. He stayed there for several hours, and was told to pick some of the largest lumps of saffron and take them home. While he was walking the bag became heavier, and he then threw some of the lumps away. When he reached home he found that the saffron turned into gold. This is the story which the Malays as well as the Straits Chinese believe about Mt. Ophir or Gunong Leydang.\"\n\nR. J. Wilkinson.\n\nGolden Flowers.\n\nThere was living in Singapore not many years ago a Chinaman in very poor circumstances, who possessed, however, a small garden, in which grew a plant of the Pandan Wangi (Pandanus taevis), a tree which is often cultivated for its scented leaves used for flavouring rice and for making a kind of pot pourri used at weddings. He supplied the tree liberally with manure, and one moonlight night he was surprised to see it bearing a red flower. Going to examine it next day, no flower was to be seen, but next night it was there again, and he climbed up and got it, and put it on a table in his house. On the\nfollowing morning he found it was changed into gold, and broke off a bit and took it off to sell. On returning, he found the bit he had broken off had grown again, and this continued till he became a very rich man. On his death the flower disappeared, and the family became comparatively poor again. The Pandan Wangi very rarely flowers (indeed I have never seen the flowers of it), and the male flowers are white and sweet-scented, like those of any other Pandanus.\n\nRecently a Javanese who was in the Botanic gardens on a moonlight evening perceived on the stem of a wild fig-tree (Ficus Miquelii) at a height of about ten feet from the ground, a red flower about as big as a large marigold. Not knowing the peculiarity of the Gold flower, he went to call a companion to look at it, when it immediately vanished, nor has it reappeared. It seems that the gold flower objects to a crowd, and will only be visible to certain fortunate persons, and this coolly, by calling a companion to see it and not immediately seizing the flower, has missed his opportunity of becoming a wealthy man. It is hardly necessary to say that the flowers of the fig are enclosed in the fig itself, which is mistaken for the fruit by the natives, who imagine that fig-trees have no flowers at all but only fruits. And thus, as, like the Pandan, it has normally no flowers, it is just the kind of tree you would expect to find gold flowers on.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nRemarks on the Rhinoceros Hornbill (Buceros Rhinoceros), and some other species mentioned in Mr. Ridley's Paper on the Birds of the Botanical Gardens.\n\nWriting of the Rhinoceros Hornbill in his interesting paper on Singapore Birds, Mr. Ridley says, \"The beak and casque are naturally white, but during life are coloured orange and red. This is done by the bird itself, which every morning rubs its beak against a gland beneath its tail, whence exudes an orange-red liquid which colours the beak.\"\n\nThe gland (uropygial) is above and not below the tail; below is of course a lapsus calami. In a letter to Mr. Ridley I told him that I thought the red colour on the bill, thoug\nfugitive, was natural to it, and not, like the yellow, put on by\nthe bird. Mr. Ridley considered that both colours came\nfrom the oil-gland; so to settle the question I made a careful\nexamination of the white, bleached beak of an old mounted\nspecimen. The bill consists of a cellular bony core of extreme\nlightness encased in a thin covering of horn; the casque is\nentirely hollow, except for a mass of tony cells at the base.\nThe horn of the outer covering is in thin flaky layers, and it is\nonly the outer one of these which entirely loses colour in a\nstuffed specimen. If it be removed, the red colour is seen to\nbe retained, though less vivid than in life, throughout the\nremaining layers of the horny casing. It appears, therefore,\nthat either the outer layer of horn is naturally red and bleaches\non the death of the bird, or that it is transparent when daily\nanointed with the uropygial oil, allowing the underlying red colour\nto show through, but becoming opaque in the dried specimen.\n\nProbably the oiling of the bill, which is common to both\nsexes, is as much to keep the surface from cracking or becoming\nbrittle and flaky as for decorative purposes.\n\n*Egithina tiphia*, Mr. Ridley describes as resembling a\ngoldfinch in its plumage and habits. The resemblance in habits\nis not very apparent. Goldfinches are gregarious, frequent\nopen country, and feed on seeds, principally on thistle-down;\nthe Iora goes in pairs or singly, keeps chiefly to secondary jungle\nor low trees, and feeds on insects, mainly caterpillars.\n\n*Turnix plumbipes*. Describing the decoying of these quail,\nMr. Ridley says, \"A cock quail is put inside the cage.\" Surely,\na hen? It is the hens that do the courting and the fighting\nin the genus Turnix. They are also the larger and most con-\nspicuously coloured birds. I have seen numbers trapped in\nIndia and Ceylon with hen decoys, but never saw a cock used.\n\n*Gallinago stenura*. The name Mr. Ridley uses arose from\na misprint. \"Stenura\" is correct, and has been shown to\nbe what Bonaparte originally wrote, referring (*stenos*, narrow)\nto the attenuated lateral tail feathers. But this is merely a\nmatter of synonymy, the least interesting part of ornithology.\n\nA. L. Butler.\nNOTE. Mr. Butler's remarks are very interesting, and speak for themselves, so I need only refer to the fighting quails. Since hearing from him, I have met several quail-catchers in Sungei Ujong, and examining the decoy birds find that all were females. The Malays too told me they always used the females for fighting, and the males did not fight.\n\nH. N. R.\n\nBekin.\n\nRegarding the Malay word \"bikin\" \u2014 to do, to make, etc., \u2014the use of which is so strongly deprecated, and the bastard origin of which is insisted upon by all authorities on the language\u2014has the probability of its Persian origin ever been seriously considered? The word bears a striking resemblance to \"bikun,\" the imperative of the common Persian verb \"to do, to make,\" etc. If this origin could be established it would raise the word from its present obloquious position to one of quite classical respectability.\n\nW. C.\n\nAn insectivorous squirrel.\n\nThe swarming of a nest of termites is always interesting to watch on account of the numerous enemies which hasten to the spot to prey upon these helpless insects. Birds, chiefly bulbuls, robins, drongos and bee-eaters, are the usual assailants. Dragon-flies also dart to and fro through the swarm, and frogs and toads hasten from their retreats to devour those that fall on the ground. I was surprised, however, recently on one of these occasions to see a little squirrel (Nanosciurus exilis) creeping about on the ground and eagerly catching the insects. On my remaining quite motionless, it crept out of the bushes upon the road where it remained about two feet from me intent on its prey, which it ate wings and all, apparently with much enjoyment, and by the rustling in the bushes I judged there was at least one more, which I could not see, attacking the swarm.\n\nH. N.R.\nNotes from Sarawak Museum.\n\nOn a Fossil Tooth found at Bau, Upper Sarawak.\n\nA molar tooth of the Indian elephant (*Elephas indicus*) was recently found in a small cave at Bau, Upper Sarawak, by a Chinaman, whilst washing for gold, and was handed over to me by Mr. Pawle of the Borneo Company, whose kindness in so doing, I beg to acknowledge here. The tooth is an undoubted fossil, as shown by a longitudinal section subsequently made, but since it was lying in a crevice in the limestone, not actually imbedded in rock, it is impossible to state with any degree of accuracy the exact horizon of the specimen. The limestone in this part of Sarawak is undoubtedly of comparatively recent origin, as shown by fossils collected by me; such characteristic shells as Cerithium and Limopsis being here abundant; the formation is honeycombed with caves, many of which were carefully explored in 1878-9 by the late Mr. A. H. Everett. His results were embodied in a report to the Royal Society (Proc. Roy. Soc. No. 203, 1880) and he there states it as his opinion, that it is unlikely that deposits of any great antiquity or interest will be found in this area; subsequent observations have justified and will, I think, continue to justify these words; the fossil tooth, the subject of this note, is interesting only because it proves conclusively that which formerly was argued inductively, viz.\u2014that the Indian elephant was once an indigenous inhabitant of Borneo. In Mr. C. Hose's \"Mammals of Borneo,\" *Elephas indicus* is included as an indigenous species; but there is little doubt that the few individuals now existing in North Borneo have sprung from some pairs which were introduced some years ago, certainly within the memory of living man. These pairs were presented by a Sultan of Pahang to the Sultan of Brunei or Sulu (for on this point accounts differ), and after they had been kept in semi-captivity for a year or two, were turned loose into the jungle. Considering the low rate of breeding of elephants it is not surprising that their present distribution in the island of Borneo is so extremely local. It is also worthy of note that the Kyans at the head of the Rejang and Baram rivers, areas in which the rhinoceros and wild buffalo\noccur, are not only ignorant of the existence of the elephant both by personal observation or by hearsay, but have no word in their language for that animal. Fossil remains of various species of elephants have been found in the Pliocene and Pleistocene deposits of many countries, but *Elephas indicus* itself has not been shewn to have any great antiquity, nor do I attempt to shew it now from the fragment before me. Borneo was separated from the Asiatic continent in quite recent times, and it is not impossible that the elephant lingered on in the newly-formed island for some length of time. That the species was once indigenous to Borneo is proved now for the first time and beyond all manner of doubt.\n\n*R. S.

Hanitsch,\n\nHonorary Treasurer, Straits Branch, Royal Asiatic Society\nA Trip to Mt. Penrissen, Sarawak.\n\nAt midday on the 5th of May of this present year of grace, Mr. E. A. W. Cox, of the Sarawak Government service, and myself left Kuching for the upper waters of the Sarawak river on a long talked-of collecting expedition. Our ultimate destination was Penrissen, a mountain of 4,800 feet high, five miles from the \"ulu\" of the left hand branch of the Sarawak river, and about fifty miles as the crow flies from the sea-coast. The mountain had previously been scaled, in part at least, by Signor Beccari, Mr. A. H. Everett, Dr. G. D. Haviland and Mr. Henderson, but had never, from a zoological point of view, been thoroughly collected over, so that our hopes of obtaining interesting and valuable results ran high.\n\nOur staff consisted of five Dyak collectors, Malay and Chinese boys, and a Chinese cook; to convey these, ourselves and our somewhat bulky baggage, three boats were requisitioned, but as events turned out proved insufficient; however the start was fair and through the lower reaches of the river all went well and comfortably. The night was spent in part at the little village of Selobang, but to catch the tide and to avoid the din of a neighbouring Chinese \"wayang,\" we re-embarked at 12 p.m. and proceeded quietly on our way till at 6.30 in the morning the first \"karungan\" or gravel bed was encountered; here we stopped for breakfast and a delightful bathe in the now somewhat rapid river. At 9 we were on again, and soon began to experience some difficulty in progression. The river abounded with shallows and small rapids; up and over these our heavy and heavily-laden boats, which to use a Malay expression \"ate much water,\" were poled and hauled only with the greatest difficulty and exertion. At the very bad places a general halt had always to be called, whilst the respective crews joined forces and hauled with ropes one boat up at a time. Late in the afternoon we finally won to Segu, and right glad were we to partake of the\nhospitality offered to us by the gentlemen then in charge of the Government coffee-estate at that place. Profiting by our experience we exchanged next day one of our heavy boats with its Malay crew for two lighter boats with crews of Land-Dyaks; these men are experts in the art of poling up against a strong and shallow stream and the women are not far behind the men. It was amusing to hear our new recruits coaching our Malay crews, the latter though secretly acknowledging the superiority of their advisers as polers were too proud to take advice in any form from those they considered in every other respect beneath their notice. With such valuable additions to our forces we proceeded up stream at a fair pace; the scenery was lovely, precipitous walls of limestone carved by the weather into every imaginable shape, rose high on either side. Their summits were clothed with a dense growth of trees and creepers, which in places almost roofed in the narrow channel up which we moved; the river itself here rippling over shallows or dashing through rocky gateways, there running calm and still under an overhanging cliff, ever added fresh beauty and interest to the scene. At night we tied up opposite the village of Burgor, and slept in the boats; an early start was made next morning and by midday, we arrived at Pankalan Ampat, thus completing the first stage of our journey. From here we dispatched messengers to the neighbouring village of Sennah, and in the evening had a visit from the Pengara and his youthful son. Thanks to a formidable looking \"surat\" from the Resident of Sarawak, we met with little difficulty in arranging the important matter of carriers, and were able next day to dispatch the heavy baggage to Sennah, following leisurely ourselves by river, preferring this to the dangers of a Land Dyak road with its picturesque though fragile bamboo bridges slung over nasty-looking places where a fall meant a broken bone or two.\n\nOn arrival at Sennah we were met with a cordial welcome by the Orang Kaya and conducted to the chief house of the village. This, as is usual amongst the Land Dyaks, consisted of four or five big houses all built up on tall piles at the summit of the most precipitous part of the river bank. The approach to the village consisted of notched logs, with or without a frail hand-rail of bamboo; communication between one house and\nanother is established by logs rounded or slightly flattened, generally as slippery as glass; in fact within the village itself no one ever walks on the ground. Beneath the houses pigs root and grunt, fowls cackle and boys fight, in a sodden mass of filth, the effluvium from which percolates freely through the open spaces between the floors of bamboo laths. The particular house in which we temporarily took up our abode was a well-built plank structure with billian attap roof, two large doors led out on to a spacious verandah at the back, which again gave on to a large open space surrounded by fowl-houses and sheds, and with ways leading off to other houses. Here and in the verandah much of the daily work is gone through, the house itself being reserved for cooking, eating and sleeping. In the verandah were a couple of large bell-shaped wooden vessels, half-filled with padi, and nearly all day long women were husking this by repeated thumpings blows administered by 3 or 4 foot poles; when husked, the padi is thrown into circular sieves of rotan, and shaken till the husks and broken grain are separated off. The Land Dyak man presents in his dress no particular feature of interest, a blue or red cloth \"chawat,\" or a pair of Chinese trousers and a head hand-kerchief generally completing his garb. The women however are more picturesque: their sole garment is a short petticoat reaching to the knees, generally of blue cloth with a red border, but their arms from elbow to wrist and their legs from just below the knee to the ankle are encircled by rows of brass rings; a shell armlet and leglet generally topping each series of rings; even the little girls are burdened with these ornaments, though otherwise innocent of clothing, and when a number of girls of different ages are seen together it is quite possible to trace a gradual distortion of the calf of the leg due to the weight of metal borne; generally also several rings of rotan dyed red or black are worn round the waist, and out-of-doors a neat close-fitting cap made of palm leaf. There were few objects of ethnographical interest to be noticed in the house. Unlike the Sea Dyak, these people neither weave their cloth, forge their weapons nor make their pottery, but buy such necessaries from Malay and Chinese traders. However, I saw, coveted and subsequently purchased a curious\nhat known as \"Bok tumbis;\" this was cylindrical, narrower at the top than at the bottom, 9 inches in height, made of coloured beads strung in striking patterns on five threads of rotan, the whole strengthened with uprights of thicker rotan. The top was open, and through the aperture the wearer\u2014always a woman\u2014pulls her hair, allowing it to stream out on all sides; it is only worn in dances during the annual harvest feast; the men on such occasions sometimes wear a necklet of tiger-cat's teeth alternated with the teeth of bats, squirrels and such like small deer. Besides elegantly-carved wooden handles for their parangs, baskets woven from rotan, without any distinctive pattern, and small oval wooden boxes for powder and shot, I could discover no other article which these people make.\n\nThat evening we held a great \"bichara,\" and after overriding the almost countless objections to carry our baggage raised by one man after another, we endeavoured to get information concerning the summit of the mountain, its conformation, the water-supply, the animals and birds, and such like matters; many yarns were spun to us, and we received a large amount of information which subsequently proved to be mainly erroneous. Though Penrissen is the hunting ground of these Sennahs, but few had ascended to any considerable altitude, so they compensated for their lack of the knowledge we wanted by unlimited romancing. Though we rose early next morning, it was nine o'clock before we could make a start on our march to the mountain; our thirty to forty coolies wanted to take only the lightest loads, whilst we naturally wanted them to take those things which we needed most, leaving the rest to follow with further detachments of coolies from outlying villages, and the apportioning of weights was a long task. At length we made a move, and after wading across the river began our tramp. The way lay through old deserted padi farms overgrown with a dense but scrubby jungle; the country was undulating in the extreme, and the path the merest track, a foot or less in breadth, at frequent intervals interrupted by bamboo bridges and batangs, for the most part rotten. As the heat was intense we found walking very trying and difficult, and were glad at twelve o'clock to rest and discuss a meal. At one o'clock we were on again, and soon reached the lower slopes of the\nmountain, and as these up to a height of 2,000 feet are clothed with bamboo jungle, we found the going much more easy. After crossing several mountain torrents, we reached late in the afternoon, at an altitude of 2,500 feet, a huge overhanging boulder of sandstone conglomerate, known to the Sennahs as Batu Tinong, and under this we pitched our camp for the night. A dashing mountain stream was quite close by, and the delight of sitting under a foaming cascade of really cold water after our exhausting day was one not readily to be forgotten. Leeches had proved persistent and troublesome throughout the day, but in my opinion the annoyance caused by them has always been somewhat exaggerated.\n\nNext morning we continued our climb until we had reached an altitude of 3,400 feet, when our guides called a final halt; the position was not particularly inviting, being a very small flat area totally shut in by tall jungle, whilst both to the front and rear the sides of the mountain sloped steeply downwards and upwards; however, as we were informed that there was no water to be had at any greater height, and further that all the Europeans who had previously visited the mountain had encamped here, we had perforce to acquiesce in our guides' decision. Our carriers made a clearing and proceeded to build us a hut; this took two or three hours to complete, as we insisted it should be commodious, solid and watertight; the poles and beams were of course felled in the jungle, and the floor, raised about two feet off the ground, was made with laths and saplings, whilst intertwined palm-leaves served for roof and walls. Every felled tree produced a small harvest of insects; a few interesting butterflies invaded the clearing, amongst them Cyrestis seminigra, previously only recorded from Kina Balu, whilst in the undergrowth were found snails, scorpions and centipedes, all delightfully unfamiliar to the low-country naturalist. In securing these specimens and in rigging up shelves and sleeping-bunks in our hut, making all comfortable and snug, we spent the rest of the day.\n\nOn the following day (May 13th) Mr. Cox early started out to explore the mountain at a higher elevation, and at mid-day returned with the report that after a stiff climb of 400 feet he had reached a magnificent plateau of considerable extent,\nwhere water was abundant and a good view readily obtainable, altogether infinitely superior to our present situation; our chagrin at having been deceived by our guides was great, but we decided to wait till the shooters returned from the jungle round about, whither they had early that morning been sent, before deciding whether it was worth while or not staying on in our present position. When eventually the hunters returned, the results of their labours were not very interesting, except the insects; of birds, a small robin-like species, dull in colour (*Alcippe cinerea*) was the only one at all characteristic of a mountain ornis. Mr. Cox therefore decided to visit next day the actual summit of the mountain, and if much of interest was seen or procured, to stay there for 10 days or a week. In accordance with this idea he and all the collectors, except one, whose services I retained, departed on the 14th. At mid-day I received word that they had reached the actual summit. Up to 4,500 feet the climbing had not been particularly difficult, but the last 300 feet was a sheer precipice of sand-stone conglomerate with a few narrow ledges at infrequent intervals, and to scale this, ladders had to be improvised; the summit was found to be quite flat, about half a mile long by two hundred yards broad, a dreary wilderness of pandanus and *rotan*, with hundreds of huge trees in every stage of life, from full and vigorous growth to absolute decay. Animal life was very scarce, and as a strong wind was blowing, bringing up a dense fog, Mr. Cox decided to descend to the foot of the cliff and encamp there. By the bearers of his message he sent down a specimen of the trogon, *Harpectes dulitensis*, and a gigantic earthworm nearly eighteen inches long.\n\nDuring the next five days I collected assiduously round about our hut and on the plateau already alluded to, dismissed our first batch of coolies and awaited the arrival of the rest of our baggage. This came up by degrees, until finally all our belongings could be bestowed in our hut and kitchen.\n\nOn the 18th, Mr. Cox sent down to say that he had moved lower down the mountain on to a peak known as Mt. Prang, altitude 3,000 feet, and as some most curious insect larva (*Vermileo* sp.) accompanied his letter, I determined to join him and investigate the life-history of the insect as fully as possi-\nble. At this station the hunters had erected a long lean-to on the side of the hill, and from it we had a most magnificent view of the country below us right down to the sea, fifty miles away. Unfortunately at this altitude our view was too frequently interrupted by fog and cloud, which generally swept up towards the middle of the day, and obscured everything till nightfall. From this station we made various expeditions round and about. Birds and mammals were extremely scarce, and the insects did not differ very markedly from those to be caught on the plateau; as, moreover, I had obtained alive several specimens of the fly-larva, *Vermi'eo sp (?)* we decided to return to our original and comfortable quarters.\n\nWe descended on the 24th, and from then till the 30th lived a calm and uneventful life; our mornings from an early hour to nearly noon were spent in tramping through the jungle, hunting for birds, reptiles, insects, in fact, everything that had life in it; the afternoons in skinning, pinning out insects, bottling and labelling spirit specimens, and the other thousand and one duties which make a collector's life a busy one. An early dinner with bed to follow completed the day.\n\nThe return journey to Sennah was much like the first, save that it was accomplished in one day, one little incident only perhaps is worthy of note:\u2014as we neared the foot of the mountain our carriers suddenly espied a small tree, which to our eyes presented no particular features of interest; however, loads were thrown aside in a hurry and a rush made for the tree, which was quickly hacked down and split up, and from numberless burrows in the wood, hundreds of a peculiarly scented, pinkish larva were extracted. No adults or pupae were to be found, so beyond recognising the larva as that of a beetle, I was unable to determine the species or even family; these larvae when boiled are considered a great delicacy by the natives of the district. They certainly looked much more appetising than the fat white grubs of the big coconut beetle which these people also devour with great gusto.\n\nFrom Sennah we proceeded straight on to Pankalan Ampat, and after waiting a few days for boats and to collect\n\n* See this Journal for description of the habits of this curious larva.\nrevenue we returned to Kuching, arriving on June 4th.\n\nTaken as a whole, the expedition was a great success, but the very great scarcity of mammals and birds was disappointing; only two kinds of monkey were seen. The cry of a solitary Wa-Wa was heard, but occasionally; pigs, deer, lijung and pelandok were noticeable only by their absence, and not a single game bird was procured or even seen. This scarcity I attribute to the fact that 60 per cent of the Dyaks of a by no means thinly populated district are armed with guns, which they constantly use, huge foraging parties going out before every harvest feast and keeping up for days a constant fusillade on anything above the size of a thrush; further I am inclined to suspect that this the Southern end of Sarawak in less faunistically rich than the more Northern regions. Certainly the list of birds which we obtained on Penrissen must compare somewhat unfavourably with those published by the late Mr. John Whitehead and by Mr. Charles Hose of Baram, two gentlemen whose labours on Mts. Kina Balu and Dulit are so well known in the zoological world.\n\nReptiles and amphibia were moderately abundant, and three species of fish were captured in a mountain stream by the use of Tuba. The invertebrate fauna was extremely rich, and much attention was paid to forming large collections of insects, and arthropods in general, and I am confident that, entomologically at least, no mountain in Borneo has been so well worked at as was Penrissen during our stay there.\n\nVery little time was at our disposal to collect satisfactorily the flora of the mountain; the small collections made, however, have proved to be of such interest (see Appendix to the article) that I have determined to send back my collectors to the mountain in October, almost entirely to botanise.\n\nLists of the animals obtained will appear from time to time in this Journal in the order in which they are worked out. At present I am indebted to Mr. Ridley for working out the plants (Phanerogams only) obtained, and to His Lordship the Bishop of Singapore and Sarawak for the appended list of, and remarks on, the ferns.\n\nR.

Extremely common, not differing in any way from low-country specimens.\n\n3. *Macacus cynomolgus* L. Two specimens were shot near the summit of the mountain, and were remarkable for the great length of the hair round the face.\n\n4. *Hipposiderus* sp. (?) This is perhaps a new species, a matter to be decided by Mr. Oldfield Thomas, of the British Museum.\n\n5. *Tupaia* sp. (?) Closely mimicked by *Sciurus everetti*. The species may possibly be *T. mulleri*, described lately by Kohlbrugge.\n\n6. *Tupaia minor* Gthr.\n\n7. *Ursus malayanus* Raffles. A large specimen of this bear was encountered as we were on our way down the mountain and, as guns were not handy, the animal made good his escape before a shot could be fired.\n\n8. *Paradoxurus hermaphrodyta* Schreb. This and the following two species are about the only mammals which the Land Dyaks do not eat.\n\n9. *Arctictes binturong* Raffles.

Kina Balu and of Mr. C. Hose's collections on Mt. Dulit. Not only was the number of species obtained small, but bird-life in general, with the exception of Barbets, was most noticeably scarce. I attribute this scarcity partly to the fact that the mountain has long been the happy hunting-ground of the Land Dyaks, 60% of whom are armed with guns; all the game birds seem to have been shot or trapped, for we certainly neither saw nor heard one, whilst hornbills, profiting by a large experience of the sound of a shot, were very difficult to approach. A good collection of low-country birds was made at Pankalan Ampat, at the head of the left-hand branch of the Sarawak river, and about 10 miles from the foot of Penrissen. Amongst other good things we were fortunate enough to obtain there, was a specimen of a kingfisher, rare in Borneo, *Alcedo erythronoe*.\n\nWith the exception of a small fly-catcher, too battered for description, and an obscure little greenish Timeling, allied to\nLIST OF THE BIRDS OF PENRISSEN.\n\nMicornis, all the species obtained are well known, thanks chiefly to the labours of Mr. Hose on Mt. Dulit. As each of the above-mentioned specimens are unique, and as my knowledge of systematic ornithology is somewhat inadequate, I refrain from describing them, until further material can be obtained. I have followed the classification adopted by Mr. Everett in his list of Bornean birds (cf. this Journal No. 20, 1889,) and I have included those species obtained by Mr. Everett in a former expedition to Penrissen.\n\nFAMILY TURDIDE.\n\n1. Myiophonus borneensis Sclater, Ibis 1885, p. 123. One young specimen of this species was obtained, differing so markedly from the adult, that I was inclined to regard it as a new species; a subsequent careful comparison with a skin of a typical female from Mt. Dulit revealed its identity. The back wings and tail are of a very dark brown, and the feathers of the breast and head have the shafts and tips white, the webs of these feathers are not so well developed as in the adult, and there is no trace of any blue coloration on the wings.

Bartlett former curator of the Sarawak Museum described in this Journal (April 1894) a new species of *Philentoma*, *P. maxwelli*. I have examined the solitary specimen in the Museum collection and have very grave doubts of its distinctness from *P. pyrrhopterum*; a quite asymmetrical patch of chestnut on the breast is the only distinguishing feature, and prefer to regard the bird merely as a some-\nwhat abnormal variation, until further material is obtained; but as seven years have elapsed since the specimen was shot and more or less continuous collecting in the same area has not brought to light a similar one, though both *pyrrhopterum* and *velatum* are common enough, I hold no very strong hopes of matching the specimen with another.\n\n38. *Culicicapa ceylonensis* Swains.

We noticed the bird when descending the river from the Dyak village of Sennah to Pankalan Ampat, and about a week later my collectors shot it. Unfortunately by this time I had returned to Kuching, and was consequently unable to sex the bird myself or to make colour notes, and I am afraid that as a result of native carelessness, the present label \"female\" is untrustworthy. The specimen is a very small one, the total length being only 6.5 in. as against 8 in., the total length of the full-grown adult. It possesses the blue pectoral band spotted with white, characteristic only of the male, and the lower parts are not ferruginous as is usual in females; in many small points this specimen differs slightly from Dr. Sharpe's description (l. c.) but nevertheless I am sure that my identification is correct.\n\n65.

The bill is extremely short; -8 inch, as against 1.5 of the adult, and is black, paler towards the tip instead of coral red. The wing-coverts and scapulars are red and there is no blue spot behind. The wing coverts as in C. erythra, but there is a black frontal patch as in C. diliegyni; further C. diliegyni has been found on Dulit, but C. erythra has not; I am therefore completely puzzled as to the correct name for our Penrissen specimen, and must wait until I can see more young specimens of both species before absolutely deciding.\n\n66.

The island of Singapore with the small islands of Pulau Ubin and Pulau Tekong in the Johore strait and a few smaller ones lying within English waters form the area the flora of which is enumerated in this paper. The whole is little more than 200 square miles in extent and consists of undulating country, the highest hill being Bukit Timah with an altitude of 500 feet above sea level. The Geology of the island was the subject of a paper by Mr. J. R. Logan (Journ. As. Soc. Beng. xvi. p. 519, published in 1846), but unfortunately he much misunderstood it, mistaking sedimentary rocks for volcanic ones. The bigger hills, Bukit Timah, Bukit Mandai, and Tanjong Gol, are composed of a grey granite, which crops out again near Bajau, Changi and Pulau Ubin. The rest of the island is covered with sedimentary deposits of clays, gravels, and sands, often very ferruginous and permeated with bands of clay-ironstone, very much resembling that of some of the Wealden beds in Kent. This clay iron-stone has unfortunately received the name of Laterite here, a name properly applied to soils baked by a lava-flow, or other volcanic heat. These sedimentary rocks have never produced any fossils except some obscure traces of vegetable remains. They appear to have been derived from disintegrated and decomposed granite, the ironstone bands being formed in many cases at a much later date. No borings of any depth having been made it is impossible to say how deep these strata are, but it is probable that they are of very great thickness and comparatively modern, as appears to be the case in Selangor and elsewhere. In the south of the island in some spots the strata are very strongly upheaved.\n\nOriginally the island appears to have been covered with a dense forest, except along the mangrove edged rivers and the sandy tract of country lying between Tanjong Ru and Changi point. But soon after it was acquired, a great deal of this forest\nwas felled, partly for the value of the timber and partly for cultivation. Later a very large proportion of the cleared ground was abandoned, and became covered with secondary growth, or lalang, and every year still sees the disappearance of some woodland, so that in several of the localities quoted for certain plants in this list, such as Ang Mo Kio, few traces of any native plants can now be found. The names of many villages and districts are taken from trees which doubtless plentiful fifty years ago are now either very scarce or quite extinct. Such are Kranji (Dialium), Changi (Balanocarpus), Tampenis (Sloetia sideroxylon), Tanjong Ru, the Cape of Casuarinas, Kampong Gelam, the village of Melaleuca. Extensively as the indigenous flora has been destroyed in this way, I have succeeded in finding most of the plants collected here by Wallich in 1822; and of those mentioned in his Catalogue which I have not recovered, some at least were evidently wrongly localised, having been probably collected in Penang. Many of the trees, however, which were probably formerly more abundant, are represented now by single specimens.\n\nA few fairly large and representative tracts of jungle remain, and though in most cases much of the more valuable timber has been removed, these contain the most varied and interesting portions of the flora. Among the biggest trees therein are the Dipterocarpaceae, Dyera, Dichopsis, Irvingia, Kumpassia, species of Mangifera, Artocarpus and Tarrietia. Mixed with these are numerous smaller trees and shrubs of all orders, with rattans, and other palms, and especially in rocky spots and damp watercourses, are ground orchids, Scitamineae, aroids, ferns, Ebermaiera, Pentaphragma, Cyrtandrae and many other smaller plants. Here too grow the curious little saprophytes Thismia, Sciaphila, Aphyllorchis, Burmannia, etc. Many climbing plants such as Uncaria, Willughbeia, Bauhinia, Strychnos and Guetum form huge lianes climbing to the tops of the trees and covering them with a mat of foliage. On the branches of the loftiest trees grow many epiphytes not met with elsewhere, orchids, ferns, such as the rare Davallia triphylla, Rhododendron, Vaccinium and Dischidia, and it is interesting to note that many of these plants, which in the low country grow only on this elevated position, are to be met with as terrestrial or rock plants at greater elevations in the peninsula. The banks of the larger streams and rivers and a\ngood portion of the coast line where mud is deposited are edged with a thick mangrove jungle composed of *Rhizophoraceae* (*Rhizophora*, *Bruguiera*, *Ceriops*) *Carapa*, *Lumnitzera*, *Avicennia* and *Heritiera* on the branches of which grow abundance of small orchids, ferns, *Lycopodium*, *Psilotum*, *Heptapterum*, *Pachycentria*, *Medinillopsis* and other epiphytes, while in the mud on suitable spots grow such herbaceous plants as *Acanthus*, *Cryptocoryne ciliata*, *Tristellateia*, *Oxotharis* and some *Cyperaceae* and grasses. Inland just behind the mangroves the ground is often sandy and covered with woods of comparatively small trees, *Eugenia*, *Podocarpus*, *Gelonium*, *Argetea*, *Afzelia*, etc., with clumps of the Nibung palm (*Oncosperma tigliariar*), and on these and on the ground grow many orchids, *Cirrhoptatum*, *Bulbophyllum*, *Coelogyne*, *Plocoglottis*, *Platyclinis*, and *Erva*.\n\nThe coast line from Tanjong Ru to Changi is also very sandy, and here is a very distinct flora much resembling that which borders the Pahang river near its mouth. It is rich in grasses and sedges, *Xyris*, *Cyanozis*, and other herbaceous plants, with bushes of *Rhodomyrtus*, *Vaccinium*, *Leucopogon*, *Capparis*, *Eugenia*, etc. Unfortunately a great portion of this district has been put under coconut cultivation, and the greater part of the flora has disappeared, except at Changi point where it still remains.\n\nAs a very large portion of the island has been cleared and cultivated, and often abandoned, there are very large tracts covered either with *Lalang* (*Imperata cylindrica*) or fern either *Gleichenia Linearis* or bracken, *Pteris aquilina* or in swampy spots with *Scleria* to the exclusion of almost everything else. In many places however secondary growth has sprung up (Belukar). This consists of small trees or shrubs of *Macaranga javanica* and *M. hypoleuca*, *Rhodamnia trinervia*, *Adinandra dumosa*, *Vitex pubescens*, *Melastoma polyanthum*, *Archytca Vahlii*, *Arthrophyllum diversifolium* and a few others.\n\nIn waste ground near villages and in cultivated spots are a number of weeds, many of which are well known as very widely distributed plants, and most of which have probably been introduced accidentally or intentionally at no very great distance of time. These weeds include most of the *Compositae*, *Grasses*, *Labiatae* and probably all the *Umbelliferae* and *Solana-\nIt is perhaps worth noting that very few of these are to be found in Wallich's collection made in 1822, showing that in all probability they were introduced at a later date. Among these weeds one or two are interesting as not occurring in India, such as *Citrinia cajani folia*, and *Gleome aculeata*, both South American plants, which also occur as weeds in Java, whence probably they were carried accidentally to Singapore.\n\nThe flora geographically speaking is typically Malayan, and resembles as might be expected that of Johore, and to a certain extent that of the neighbouring coast of Sumatra. A few plants occurring here are as far as is known endemic, but it is probable that most will be re-discovered in the neighbouring countries when they are more thoroughly explored. These endemic plants not known to occur elsewhere are marked with a *. The absence of certain plants common in the peninsula is somewhat remarkable, such as *Eurya acuminata* and *Girecia umbellata*, and there are several striking plants to be found on the neighbouring islands, and on the coast of Johore, especially near Tanjong Kupang, which are quite absent from our flora. Of the native flora it will be noticed that the greater number of plants are either trees or shrubs, herbaceous plants being comparatively scarce in the forests, and chiefly to be found in the open country in the sandy district of the coast. Those of the forest region being usually epiphytes, orchids, Piperaceae, or Scitamineae, aroids, grasses and sedges, with a few saprophytes.\n\nThe most extensively represented orders here are those of the Euphobiaceae, Urticaceae, Rubiaceae and Orchidaceae. The variety of the latter will surprise many residents who have probably seen not more than one or two species growing wild here, but the fact that these plants are very local and frequently occur on the upper branches of the loftiest trees, where they are difficult to see and to obtain, accounts for their being so often overlooked. The largest genera are those of the Figs (*Ficus*) and nutmeg (*Myristica*).\n\nAs in most equatorial regions, the number of species in proportion to the number of individuals is very large. A Malay jungle consists of innumerable trees, shrubs and climbers, all apparently distinct, and individuals of any one species occurring singly here and there, often very far apart, so that these forests\nhave a very different appearance from those of the more temperate zones, which frequently consist of but one or two kinds. The contrast is well seen in comparing the English flora with that of Singapore. In Singapore with an area of 200 square miles we have over 1,900 species of flowering plants, while the flora of the British Isles with an area of 121,115 square miles produces but 1,200 species, while of ferns we have here over 130 species, nearly double the number in Europe, and more than three times the number in the British Isles.\n\nSeasons. There is no great amount of difference in the rainfall throughout the year, although as a rule heavier falls occur in December and January than at other times, so that plants here have no definite resting periods and are nearly all truly evergreen. Certain plants, however, such as *Cratoxylum formosum* and *Ficus Miquelii* shed all their leaves at tolerably regular intervals, remaining quite bare for one or two days, when the young shoots begin to unfold, and in a few days they are quite leafy again. This change is often but not always followed immediately by the appearance of the flowers, and often the young leaves thus produced are of a brighter green, or brilliant red, orange, white or blue. This change takes place usually three or four times a year, and every tree of the kind in the district undergoes the change on the same day. It is not till we get north of Penang that we find a definite period of rest in which all or almost all plants shed their leaves altogether and become quite bare. A good series of observations on these phenological phenomena would probably throw light on the causes of these irregular seasons.\n\nVery few plants have a definite flowering month. A large number flower more or less steadily throughout the year. Others flower at regular periods three or four times a year, almost every plant of a given kind flowering simultaneously in the district. This is best known in the case of the Pigeon orchid, *Dendrobium crumenatum*. In this plant the flowers are produced at periods of a little over a month, or two months. The exact day differs in different parts of the peninsula, but in each district they all appear in the same day, and it is remarkable that plants brought to Singapore even from as far north as Siam open their flowers on the day for Singapore, and not on that for Siam. It\nis not rare however to find certain plants of Pigeon orchid which do not flower on the regular day, but have a distinct day which they appear to keep to with equal regularity. A curious fact is that another species of *Dendrobium* (*D. ciniferum*) invariably flowers in Singapore on the day preceding that of *D. crumenatum*, whenever that happens to be. It might be thought that the weather in the district in which the plant was growing was the influencing agent, but this appears to have but little effect on the orchids. On one occasion (Dec. 5, 1893) the pigeon orchids developed their flowers so far that they were obviously ready to open them on that day, but an extraordinarily heavy rain retarded them, and the flowers opened the next day, but except in cases like this the weather previous to the flowering does not seem to make any difference to the date of flowering. Some few plants have a regular annual flowering season, such as *Calanthe curculigoides* in September, and *Grammatophyllum*, July and August. A certain number of trees flower only every fifth year, notably the *Dipterocarpus*. Every fifth year there appears to be an average higher temperature, and a period of greater dryness in May or June than in other years, and then and only then is it possible to obtain flowers of these trees. Such trees are most of the *Dipterocarpus*, *xanthophyllum Kunstleri*, *Careya* sp. In this case also all the plants in a given district flower simultaneously. It can easily be understood that it is very important to a plant that all should flower on the same day in order that they may be cross-fertilized by the insects that visit them, and this is especially the case in plants in which the flowers last but a single day, as in the case of the Pigeon orchid, but it is difficult to see how this is brought about. A good many trees seem to flower even less often than this and there are not a few which though apparently full grown healthy trees have not given flowers once in ten years.\n\n*Colors of flowers.*\n\nAs is well known the colors of flowers depend to a large extent on the kind of insect fertilizer for which they are destined to prove attractive. The most abundant insects in the thick jungle are the flies (*Diptera*) and these appear often in enormous abundance when certain trees are in bloom. The Oaks and\nChestnuts, Sindora and Kurrima are particularly attractive to them and the roar of their wings can be heard often at some distance from the tree. The chief of these flies is a black Musca with red eyes. The flowers of fly-fertilized plants are usually small and green or whitish, generally possessing an unpleasant odor. Smaller herbaceous plants growing in dark shady woods often have deep brownish purple flowers sometimes with an odor of carrion, at others sweet and aromatic, such as Amorphophallus, Thottea, Taccia and many orchids. These are also fly-fertilized. Many trees produce masses of white flowers in large panicles or corymbs. These are very attractive to butterflies and bees, such as many of the Eugenias, Evodia, Rhodamnia, and Melanorrhoea. I have noticed as showing the bearing of the color of the flowers on insect visitors, that while Eugenia lineata with corymbs of white flowers attracts innumerable butterflies and bees and the pollen-eating flies (Syrphidae), another species of Eugenia with apple-green flowers, which is growing close by was not visited either by butterflies or bees, but by flies similar to those which visit the oaks. Pink flowers are not so common, and are usually visited by bees, as are the deep red blossoms of Cratoxylon arborecens, Gomphia Hookeri, and Eurycoma. Scarlet and bright reds are rare in Singapore except in introduced plants, but we have also the beautiful Asclepias, Rhododendron, some Loranthi, and some species of Hornstedtia. The red flowers are most attractive to the Sun-birds, and to butterflies. Bright yellow flowers are chiefly to be met with in open country especially near the sea; such are Wedelia, Xyris, Philydrum, Utricularia (most), Wormia, Timonius, and Gomphia sumatrana. The rarest color of all is blue, which is also to be met with almost exclusively in open spots. Burmannia coelestis, Commelina, Cyanotis, Utricularia affinis, Evolvulus, Monochoria, Desmodium heterophyllum, are almost the only native blue flowers here.\n\nVisitors to the tropics are often surprised by the apparent paucity and inconspicuousness of the flowers. This is partly due to the enormous proportion of foliage, which conceals the flowers, but the fact that the greater number of our flowers are adapted for fertilization by Diptera and small Hymenoptera, the most abundant insects in the forests, and are consequently small and green or whitish, accounts to a large extent for the small\namount of show that the blossoms make in the great masses of foliage.\n\nBotanists. The number of botanists who have collected or studied the flora of Singapore is even more limited than that of Penang. The first of them was naturally Sir Stamford Raffles who aided by William Jack made extensive collections, all or almost all of which were destroyed in the burning of the \"Fame.\" (For an account of Jack and some others of the Singapore botanists, see Journal 25, p. 163). Shortly after the founding of Singapore Nathaniel Wallich came to Singapore to recuperate after his great Nepaul expedition. He remained here about five months and established the first Botanic Garden, Nov. 1822, being Superintendent of it. This Garden, consisting of 48 acres, included the Government Garden on what is now known as Fort Canning Hill. After he returned to Calcutta, Jan. 1823, Dr. Montgomerie took charge of the Garden till 1827. Wallich seems to have promised to send an assistant from Calcutta Gardens, but did not do so. The Garden, which chiefly contained Nutmegs and Cloves, was abolished later, and no trace of it remains. Dr. Wallich seems to have taken some interest in the development of Singapore, and was one of a committee of three to fix on the site of the town. He built a house, Botany Hall, to stay in during his residence here.\n\nHis collection of dried plants was an extensive one, and was eventually distributed with the rest of the East India Company's herbarium. The greater number of species which he discovered here I have been able to find still in Singapore, but some appear to have quite vanished. This is not surprising when it is remembered that at that time the district in which he was collecting, viz. the neighbourhood of the town, was thick jungle, of which nearly every trace has now disappeared under cultivation. In his Catalogue many of the plants are localised \"Singapore et Penang,\" and as I note that many of these are strictly hill plants occurring at a higher elevation than there is in Singapore, I take it that these plants were in a collection of which the exact locality was lost, and that the label perhaps should have been rather \"Singapore or Penang.\" Some few however of the specimens labelled as from this region have never since been found in the peninsula, e.g. *Nylia dolabriformis*, a...\nwell known Indian tree, and it is probable that the locality is quite wrong.\n\nCol. Farquhar, the first Resident of Singapore, and John Prince, Resident Councillor in 1827, who took a little interest in the botany of the island, are commemorated in the names of some plants, e.g. *Myristica Farquhariana*, and *Erycibe Princei*, but little was done in botanical research for many years. In or about 1839, Hugh Cuming well known for his immense botanical and conchological collections in the Philippines, visited Singapore and also ascended Mount Ophir. While in the Straits he seems to have chiefly devoted himself to collecting orchids, and to have sent home a number of live ones, among which were *Coelogyne Cumingi*, and *Dendrobium longicollis*. William Lobb, orchid collector for Messrs Veitch, visited Penang and Singapore in 1845, but as mentioned in Journal 25, p. 166, his specimens from the Straits Settlements, Java and India were all mixed up in distribution, so that his localities as quoted in books are quite doubtful. Surgeon-General Mungay during his residence in Singapore made extensive collections, but many of these again were irregularly labelled, and some mentioned in the Flora of British India as from Singapore were probably either collected in Malacca or Penang.\n\nMr. Murton the first head of the present Botanic Gardens, 1875 to 1880, collected a number of plants, of which a few were sent to Kew, and a few, chiefly ferns, are still in the Botanic Gardens Herbarium. N. Cantley, who succeeded him, employed collectors and obtained a very large number of specimens, but unfortunately hardly any were strictly localised, and many labelled from Singapore in the herbarium, are either cultivated plants or from some part of the peninsula, so that in most cases I have been unable to quote safely from his herbarium.\n\nAmong other collectors whose names appear in books, associated to a small extent with Singapore plants, should be mentioned, Dr. Thomas Oxley, who wrote some papers in Logan's Journal, one of which dealt with the Flora of Singapore, but chiefly with Economic plants, while other papers treat of Nutmegs and Gutta percha. He seems to have collected plants, saying that he had collected between 40 and 50 orchids, but what became of his collections and manuscripts, I cannot find\nout. He died in or about 1858.\n\nSir Robert Schomburgk, well known for his explorations in Guiana, where he discovered the Victoria regia, was appointed British Consul in Siam in 1857. He visited Singapore and collected a few plants there, which he sent to Kew, and which were described in the Flora of British India. Some of them, however, were evidently obtained from gardens.\n\nDr. T. Anderson, 1832 to 1870, was Director of Calcutta Botanic Gardens. He appears to have visited Singapore at some time, and obtained several plants of interest. He devoted himself to the Acanthaceae, and Evanthemum Andersoni Mast, a common garden plant here was named after him.\n\nMr. R. W. Hullett made some years ago an excellent herbarium of Singapore plants, which he eventually presented to the Botanic Gardens. Duplicate specimens were sent to Kew and to Calcutta, where they were named, and several new species bear his name.\n\nIn the following list all plants with no collector's name were obtained by myself or by native collectors employed at the Gardens, and the numbers attached are those of my distribution-series. Endemic species, not yet known from elsewhere are marked with an asterisk and introduced plants, which have not properly established themselves but which occur in waste ground and the like, are included in brackets. The Mosses, Lichens, Fungi and Algae, are deferred. Collections of these have been made and submitted to experts, and I hope to publish an account of them at a later date.\nDICOTYLEDONS.\n\nDILLENIACEAE.\n\n*Tetracera Assa* Dec.

The timber is often good. The native name for the cultivated Nutmeg is \"Pala,\" the Mace being called \"Bunga Pala\" (literally flowers of Nutmeg). Many of the wild species are called \"Pala Hutan,\" etc.; but \"Pendarah,\" with the local variants Menarah, Mendarah, and Chendara, is the common name for other species.\n\nM. elliptica Wall.

The wood when fresh cut exhales an unpleasant odor. Large trees are now scarce as the natives cut them when young to make carrying sticks, and gambier stirrers, etc. There is a good deal of difference in the size of the leaves\naccording to the age of the tree. Young shoots from an old stump usually have large leaves, and it seems to me that *S. penangiana* Oliv and *S. Wallichii* King are mere states of *S. sideroxylon*, Teysm. The natives however certainly draw a distinction between some forms calling *S. Wallichii*, Tampenis putih and *S. sideroxylon*, Tampenis Merah, i.e. red and white Tampenis. The plant flowers very readily, even seedlings in a pot sometimes flower and fruit when only a foot and a half tall. The fruit is a soft white drupe enclosed in the four thickened white sepals. These are sweet and eatable and any pressure on them ejects the fruit to some distance so that if a bird attempts to eat them the fruit is thrown out.\n\nCommon in dry woods, open country, etc., especially the broad leaved var. *penangiana* Tanglin, Chan Chu Kang, Changi, etc.\n\n*Ficus*. The figs are tolerably well represented here, no less than 35 species occurring in the island. They comprise creeping shrubs, big climbers, erect shrubs from two feet tall to trees of great size. The figs, none of which here are eatable, are sought for by birds, especially pigeons, bulbuls and starlings, and by fruit-bats, which frequent the trees when in fruit in great numbers, and distribute the seeds everywhere. The common Malay name for any species of *Ficus* is \"Ara.\" \"Sipadik\" is applied to many scandent species, and \"Kelampong\" to such trees as bear the figs clustered on the stem. Most of the trees are of rapid growth with soft valueless timber.\n\n*F. pisifera* Wall.

T. Haughton who published a list of street names of Singapore Town with their Chinese equivalents in the Journal of the Straits Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society in the June issue of 1891. The present compilation may be taken as a fairly complete list of the names of roads, streets and lanes in George Town with their respective Chinese names as called by the Hokkiens and Cantonese, two of the more important sections of the Chinese community in Penang, as well as with notes explaining the meaning and giving the derivation of the Chinese names. From a glance at these explanatory notes, it will be observed that the Chinese call their streets generally after some prominent buildings or objects of view, or the nationality of the people residing, or the particular kind of business carried on, in the locality. There are, however, some new and out-of-the-way places which have no Chinese names but which are inserted here partly for the purpose of making the list as complete as possible and partly for the purpose of leaving space for the insertion of any Chinese names that may be evolved in future. To this little compilation are appended (1) a list of some notable buildings and places in George Town (2) a list of some district names in town and up-country, (3) a list of the names of some islets in the vicinity of Penang and (4) a list of names of some places in Province Wellesley and Pindings; all with their Chinese equivalents. In conclusion, the compiler desires to express his best thanks to Mr. Cheam Cheow Heng, the Senior Chinese Interpreter of the Police Courts, and other friends for much valuable information concerning this compilation.\nAcheen Street: (1) Hokkien, Koai\u207f lau\u207f \u9ad8\u6a13\u4ed4 \"a small high tower,\" the high tower is the four-storied corner house at the junction of Acheen Street and Beach Street.

were living on the island, then densely afforested, one or two races of natives, known as the Orang Kallang and Orang Selitar. The former of these lived on the river of the same name, the latter along the rivers of the Johore Strait. Some accounts of these two tribes was published by Logan in Vol. i. of Logan's Journal in 1847, and illustrated by outlines of heads. The Kallangs were removed by the Tumunggong of Johore from the Kallang river to Pulai River when the island was ceded to Britain. They formerly consisted of 100 families, but in 1847 the small pox had reduced them to eight. They were said to have lived exclusively in boats, neither building huts nor cultivating any plants. Their language at that time appears to have been Malay, and neither Mr. Logan nor Mr. Thomson who described the Orang Selitar were able to elicit any words of their original language. Of these races it is not easy now to find any traces, as they have become amalgamated with the Malays, adopting not only their language but also their customs and religion. Lately however the authors of this note visited Kampong Roko, on the Kalang river, and made an attempt to collect what information was procurable concerning this interesting people. They were accompanied by Mr. R. H. Yapp (of the Cambridge expedition) who took photographs of some of the older men who were stated to be of this race. Kampong Roko itself is a Malay village of the ordinary type, built on a mud bank of the Kalang river and containing a very mixed population. The natives have for many years employed themselves in fishing and in preparing Nipah leaves for cigarettes-wrappers, so that the ground is covered for a considerable depth with a dense mass of waste fragments of leaves. We visited the village on Nov. 12th, and sought out the oldest inhabitants, the Batin Jenang, and an old man named Rabu, together with one or two others, and spent a long time with them in endeavours to\nobtain information as to the language, traditions, etc., of the Kalinga, but they seemed to have forgotten most of the language, and but little information could be obtained, though what was obtained was of considerable interest. They affirmed that they were Orang Daik (Malay) from Lingga, and stated that there were at least eight tribes who used to visit this district, and were mostly pirates. They were the\n\nOrang Tambus          Orang Sekanak\nOrang Mantang         Orang Barok\nOrang Galang          Orang Moro\nOrang Pusek (or Persik) Orang Sugi\n\nThe first two always lived in boats, having no fixed habitations, and were not piratical. The rest were all bad pirates, who lived on various islands and travelled as far as Siam and Cochin China on piratical expeditions. In the time of Sultan Mahmud, Raja Lang was the chief of the Galangs, and Orang Kaya Mepar (Che Muntel) was chief of the Baroks, and his grandson is now head. They have a village at Singkep, or as one of the men said, on Lingga. The Persiks now live at Pulau Persik between Retik and Daik. They had a Batin as chief, but no Jenang. The Orang Tambus now live in a village in Silat Durian, among the Riau islands. They had a Batin only. The Orang Mantang lived on Pulau Mantang and were very numerous. They had a Batin. The Orang Galang lived mostly in Pulau Karas, in the Riau Archipelago, and had a Batin only. The Orang Sekanak lived on an island between Pulau Retik and Pulau Daik. The Orang Sugi live near Sulit, in Riau, and had a Batin. The Orang Moro lived in Pulau Moro, near Pulau Sugi; but they were also said to belong to the Orang Daik. It should be noted that among the Sakai tribes of the Peninsula, the Batin is usually if not invariably considered as the superior of the Jenang. Here however at Kampong Roko it was stated quite positively that the Jenang was the higher official.\n\nThe following non-Malay words were obtained from these men:\n\nKoyek, a dog. Used by all the above mentioned tribes.\nKiyan, come, come here (lit. thither) cf. Belandas tribe Chan.\nKiyan, go away (lit. hither) cf. Belandas Chun.\nKiyoh, far off.\n\nSika, come here, e.g., Sika makan come here and eat.\n\nThe following words are probably all of Malay origin:\n\nJengkeng or biduh, a boat (sampan or koleh).\n\nLanchang, a sailing vessel.\n\nO-neh or O-ne, friend or comrade, used in addressing other members of the tribe whether young or old, e.g., O-neh Nan Kamana? Where are you going, friend? The O in Oneh may be merely interjectional.\n\nDiko = engkau, also used in addressing other tribesmen, but less polite or less friendly than O-ne.\n\nPohon was used instead of Poto, tree, as on the East Coast and elsewhere.\n\nThe pronunciation was said to be peculiar, thus: s was pronounced like a soft z, e.g., Nazi for Nasi; r like h, e.g., Parang for Pahang; k like kh, e.g., Khain for Kain; Khakhi for Kaki.\n\nToo much stress however must not be laid upon these examples of pronunciation, as although what was heard is faithfully recorded, the personal equation enters too largely into this sort of questions for them to be accepted without repeated checkings. A Sakai, for instance, will occasionally pronounce one and the same word in two distinct ways, probably through nervousness at being questioned by an European.\n\nSlight as these traces are, if taken in conjunction with the important fact that the constitution of these tribes corresponds fairly closely to that of Sakais (as is shown by the Sakai names of the chiefs) they appear to suggest the theory that the Sea-gypsies of Singapore owe their origin largely from Sakai hill-tribes in the Riau-Lingga Archipelago; that these, whether through pressure of the Malay immigration or from other causes, took to the sea, and reinforced probably by more than a sprinkling of mere Malay adventurers, developed into the famous piratical race which under the generic name of Orang Laut became for a space the terror of all who sailed these Eastern seas. Such an evolution of one of the mildest mannered and most timid races of the earth would certainly appear unaccountable, but if it is to be rejected, it involves us in still greater difficulties. The evidences may be briefly enumerated as follows.\n\n(1.) The constitution of the tribe under Jinang and Batin.\n(2). The use of undoubted Sakai words; of these Koyok, Kiyun, and Kiyun are all words allied to those used by the Belandas tribe in Selangor.\n\n(3) The Sakai \"terumba\" or racial records as preserved by the Besisi tribe in the Kuala Langat district (Selangor), which explicitly state that the ancestors of the original tribe descended to the sea and became sea-folk (turun kalaaut jadi raiat laut) and that the sea-folk became pirates (Raiat laut jadi Bajan).\n\nFurther investigations when opportunities occur may supply more extensive information as to these wild tribes, now so nearly vanished. The foregoing notes, incomplete as they are, show that there are still some records worth the attention of any who have the chance of studying the race, and research in the district of Selitar and Pandan, where the tribe, as late as 1847, were in a very primitive state of civilisation, and in the Carimons, and neighbouring islands, may throw more light on the history and relationship of the Orang Laut.\n\nW. W. Skeat.\nH. N. Ridley.\nCases of Lightning Discharge.\n\nBy G. E. V. Thomas, A.M.I.C.E.\n\nCommunicated by H. N. Rulley.\n\nThe study of lightning phenomena is of great interest and importance, and as the conditions which obtain in Malaya are extremely favourable for the observation of such phenomena, as regards the frequency and violence of thunder storms, it is somewhat surprising to find that the accounts so far available are few. Those here given are of interest as being descriptive of unusual effects.\n\nIn well-marked cases of the destructive effect of lightning on trees, the tree struck is completely shattered. Such instances are familiar, probably because they are immediately apparent as the result of a severe storm; but the gradual decay and death of a number of trees in the vicinity of one struck, which would seem to be a frequent after-effect, is a form of damage which, as far as the writer can ascertain, has not previously been noted.\n\nThe following account, from the diary of Mr. H. N. Ridley, Director of Gardens and Forests, S. S., describes such an effect, which occurred in a coco-nut plantation in Singapore.\n\n\"May 3rd 1898. Visited Siglap and saw a place where, more than a month previously, a tree was struck by a tremendous flash. From this tree in a semicircle (there being none on the outer side) eleven more trees died. The deaths appeared to radiate out from struck tree gradually. Three were still standing; they bore young fruit and flowers, but the whole of the foliage looked as if burnt. One was still alive and putting up a fresh leaf. One, covered with fungi, had been dead some time. Why this progressive death? Inspector tells me he saw a similar case where, some time after the death of coco-nuts, some mango-steen trees withered away in like manner.\n\nA similar instance recently occurred in the Botanical Gardens, Singapore, and was brought to the writer's notice by the\nsame observer. In this case two trees (Erythrina and Detarium) appeared to have been struck simultaneously. Though the damage apparent was very slight and confined to the bark, decay began in the Erythrina within ten days. Another Erythrina adjoining died soon after, but the Detarium was unhurt. Another example occurred on Government Hill, when a sugar palm was struck (May 2nd, 1899). The writer saw the tree two hours afterwards and obtained the following account from a native eye-witness. \"About half past one there was a single peal of thunder, very near, but I saw no flash, only a general glare. Less than one minute afterwards smoke came from the tree and then flames, about half way up the trunk. The fire went up very quickly and I ordered the tree to be cut down.\" When the writer saw the tree, the fibrous material which covers these palms was still smouldering, but the closest examination failed to reveal any traces of damage other than that caused by fire, and the surrounding trees were quite unhurt. Three months afterwards, however, the similar palms in a radius of twelve or fifteen feet from that struck were completely dead.\n\nA remarkable point in this instance is that although the palm struck was over sixty feet in height, and surrounded by others even taller, the flash should have struck it in the middle. Mr. Ridley has noted a similar case in which an explosion took place in the fork of a Rambutan tree only six feet above the ground between the base of the fork and a birds-nest fern, and set fire to the roots of the fern. There was no damage done to this tree except from burns, but a chicken at its base was killed.\n\nThe first of the following accounts, furnished by Mr. A. Knight, is of particular interest, as the phenomena noted were of an unusual kind and did not occur during a storm. Mr. Knight writes:\u2014\"On the 12th September, 1898, I was driving home from town, and when in the lower part of River Valley Road I saw a flash in front, and there was a loud report which made my pony start forward. On reaching my house, Grassdale, I found that the ladies of my household had been much startled by the explosion. Two of them had been near the entrance, standing facing towards town, while two others were walking from the direction of town and were about a third of a mile from the house. To the former two a flame-coloured flash seemed to fall\nin front of them; to the latter two a bright light seemed to be thrown in their faces and the loud report was instantaneous. These two afterwards detected a sulphurous smell, and all felt a sensation like an electric shock. There had been some distant thunder and rain shortly after noon. It had afterwards been bright but stormy looking; and though clouds were gathering in the evening, there was at that time no thunder or lightning. Shortly afterwards there was heavy thunder near, followed by a copious shower. A. K.\"\n\nMr. Knight's second account also describes a form of discharge about which very little is known. It is unfortunate that no photograph was obtained, as it would seem from comments in a recent electrical journal that no photograph ever has been obtained of this phenomenon, and it has been customary to discredit statements as to its appearance. Mr. Knight's note differs from the more usual accounts, in which the ball of fire is said to run about before bursting, but is closely analogous to a case quoted by Dr. Oliver Lodge,* in which however the ball is described as of a reddish yellow colour, changing to vivid white. Mr. Knight's account is as follows:\u2014\"On the 14th October, 1898, there was a very severe thunder squall\u2014strong wind, violent rain and much thunder, not very distant. It came on suddenly, about 7 p.m., as we were going down to dinner; and as I was about to take my seat at the end of the table, facing the back of the house, I saw an explosion in the air, like that of a fireball or bomb, probably four or five feet above the ground, and there was a loud bang. The light appeared greenish white. There is no doubt that it was in the back garden, as it was located there by some neighbours whose line of sight was at right angles with mine.\"\n\nMr. Ridley reports also the two following cases of globular lightning, differing from that of Mr. Knight in that the phenomena occurred outside the storm. \"Some few years ago, I was sitting in my verandah, about 7 p.m.; it was quite dark, and there was a thunderstorm going on over the Economic Garden. Suddenly there was an intensely brilliant flash and instantaneous explosion close to the house. My back was towards the garden,\n\n* Lightning Conductors and Lightning Guards. Prof. O. J. Lodge.\nso that I only saw the reflection of the light. Mr. Feilding was at the time passing along the road below the hill on which my house stands, when he saw a ball of fire descend in a curve, slowly, about 50 yards from the house, close to the ground, between him and the house. It appeared to explode with a tremendous noise. Careful examination of the grass where the ball fell showed no trace of burning or other mark. Simultaneously with this phenomenon, a large tree (Ircinia) in the Economic Garden was struck by lightning, but hardly injured. This stroke was the last flash of the storm.\"\n\n(2) \"A thunderstorm was taking place over the Bukit Timah Road, beyond the Economic Garden, one Sunday about two years ago, at between one and two p.m. The sky was bright, but not cloudless, and the sun brilliant over my house, and I went out on the lawn to look at the distant storm to the North. I saw a zigzag flash apparently about three-quarters of a mile away, and, almost absolutely simultaneously, a peal of thunder came from behind me, and behind the house to the west. I saw nothing to account for this, but Mr. Robertson-Glasgow, who was sitting in a room facing west, saw a luminous body, not ball-shaped, though more or less rounded, moving in a downward curve to the South, till it disappeared behind some trees, and was followed by the thunder. It was less bright than the sunlight.\"\n\nThe only local cases of damage to buildings reported are those at the Cape Rachado and Muka Head Lighthouses. The writer was fortunately able to inspect the former not long after the occurrence, and found it to be an interesting example of side flash, a discharge having left the very fine \"Lightning Rod Conference\" copper conductor at a bend and made sundry holes in solid masonry walls, traversing two rooms and finally being dissipated over the sheet of rain water collected in a courtyard. The Lightkeeper's report shows that in this case the \"expenditure of observers\" deprecated by Dr. Lodge, nearly occurred, as the matting under two low wooden beds, on which some of the lighthouse attendants were lying at the time, was torn to pieces. The report concludes:\u2014\"In that time Serang, Tindal and two Lascars is inside the room grate of the Almighty pity there had not been anything happen.\"\nThe Muka Head case (October 9th, 1897,) affords another example of the inefficacy of the old-fashioned single conductor, which was supposed to protect a building of any size if only it were high enough, and had nicely sharpened points and an earth resistance measuring a fraction of an ohm. From the interesting report by Mr. Wills,* the Lighthouse keeper, it would seem that a flash struck the conductor, leaving evidence by tearing off a gunmetal brace about half way up. The discharge then left the heavy copper rod and proceeded to earth by a thin telephone earth wire, thirty feet of which was completely deflagrated. From some further reports collected by the writer, it would seem that Penang Hill would form an excellent site for observation, as the disturbances noted by the Signal Sergeant stationed there are exceptionally freakful and violent. He states that in April, 1898, a telegraph pole was cut in half horizontally as if it were sawed off.\u201d The telegraph wire was also cut in three or four places and three insulators broken. On another occasion, a discharge passed through a large earthenware jar, making one hole of several inches in diameter, and a second of less than one inch, and finally excavating part of the floor near the jar.\n\nAn attempt to explain the conditions which serve to bring about results like these is not within the scope of the present notes, but the writer may, perhaps, be permitted to invite further lightning notes, accompanied where possible by photographs. Such records are of the greatest possible assistance in promoting the general knowledge of a series of phenomena about which there is still much to be discovered.\n\nG. E. V. Thomas.\n\n*Kindly furnished by Mr. O. V. Thomas, Acting J. Supt. Govt. Telegraphs, Penang.\nNotes from the Sarawak Museum.\n\nOn a Remarkable Dipterous Larva.\n\nDuring a recent visit to Mt. Penrissen, Sarawak, I found in sand beneath some overhanging cliffs numerous small pit-falls exactly like those made by the ant-lion; some of these when examined were found to contain a curious worm-like larva which has since proved to belong to a fly of the genus Vermileo, family Leptidae. The body consists of 11 segments, into the first of which the head can be completely retracted, five annuli can plainly be distinguished on segments 2, 3, and 4, but are less well marked on the others; the 10th consists only of three. The middle annulus of the fourth segment bears on the ventral surface a fleshy knob (abdominal pseudopod) which is surmounted by a small semicircular chitinous comb longitudinally placed; the eighth segment ventrally bears a median tuft of setae, and a fringe of similar setae marks the posterior border of the 9th segment, this also carries on its ventral surface 2 median setigerous papillae. The 10th segment, which is set at somewhat of an angle to the 9th, bears on the dorsal surface at its anterior border a fringe of very strong setae directed backwards. The 11th and last segment terminates in four finger-like processes clothed with delicate hairs, the anus opens on its ventral, two stigmata on its dorsal surface. The last three segments are markedly larger than any of the preceding ones. The larva burrows into the sand head first, until completely buried, and then proceeds to form its pit-fall in the following manner: the more deeply buried tail-end acting as a fixed point, the anterior half of the body is curved about in all directions, each curving motion being followed by a rapid straightening out, which jerks the sand away for some little distance; since the tail is fixed, the result of many of these motions is to produce a circular repression with sloping sides; at the bottom of this lies the larva, ventral surface uppermost, the posterior half of the body still buried, the anterior half exposed and straightened out. If now an ant is introduced into the pit-fall, the exposed part of the larva suddenly curls up in a spiral coil, the prey being generally included\nin the coil and impaled by pressure on the chitinous comb of the 4th segment; a hold is then gained with the mouth, and after a few minutes, with a rapid sinuous motion, the larva straightens out and disappears below the sand, carrying its prey with it. If the larva is not successful in catching its prey the first time, it flings sand about in all directions by rapid switching movements, and the victim, unable to obtain a foothold on the sliding sides of the pit-fall, falls down to the bottom; or occasionally the larva actually strikes like a snake at the victim as it endeavours to escape from the toils, indeed many of the actions of this larva are quite snake-like, and an ant enclosed in one of its coils reminds one of nothing so much as of a small mammal in the grasp of a python. Occasionally the prey seems somewhat out of proportion to the larva, but by means of the numerous setae on the large posterior segments a very firm grip is obtained in the sand, and I have never yet seen an insect of moderate size make good his escape after having been once seized. I brought down to Kuching alive several of these larvae, and one or two pupated; shortly before pupation, the larva leaves its pit-fall and lies close to the surface of the sand, though completely covered; the anterior segments become much swollen and retracted, until the integument bursts, revealing beneath the brownish pupa; by some convulsive movements the whole pupa now appears at the surface, the larval skin being slowly shuffled off backwards, but never becoming entirely freed, so that the posterior end of the pupa always presents a somewhat ragged appearance. Unfortunately the heat of Kuching proved too much for these pupae, and none came to maturity, but shrivelled up; some Leptid flies which I obtained on Penrissen are, however, I am sure, the adult stage.\n\nON A MALE SPECIMEN OF PURLISA GIGANTEUS DIST.\n\nA specimen of this handsome Lycaenid butterfly was described and figured by Distant in his Rhopalocera Malayana (p. 250. Tab. XXI. fig. 28. 1885), but the sex was not stated either in this or in two previous descriptions (Distant, Ent. Month. Mag. Vol. XVII. p. 245, 1881, and Waterhouse, Aid. Vol. I. pl. XLVI, 1882), and de Nic\u00e9ville in his \"Butterflies of India,\" Vol. iii. p.\n385, writes:\u2014\"I have not seen this species. The sex of the specimens described is not stated, and it would be hazardous even to guess from the figures and descriptions what sex they may be.\"\n\nWith the capture of an undoubted male specimen on Mt. Matang, Sarawak, at an elevation of 3,500 feet, in March of last year, I am enabled to state with absolute certainty that Distant described a female, and as the male sex has never been described I now append a short account of it.\n\nUpperside; forewing as in the female, hind-wing with the dark fuscous area much smaller, commencing as a narrow band at the external angle it rapidly narrows to a thin marginal line; costal area grey; underside rather paler than in the female. The inner margin of the hind-wing just interior to the submedian nervure is shortly folded opposite the abdomen, the fold containing numerous long scent-hairs. This sexual character though common enough in the Nymphalidae and Papilionidae, is only met with, amongst the Oriental Lycaenidae, in the genus Simiskina. The neuration of both sexes is identical. Mr. H. H. Druce has already recorded this species from Borneo in a paper on the Lycaenidae of the island (P. Z. S., 1895, p. 602), but his specimen was a female.\n\nON THE FEMALE OF Dodona Elvira Staud.\n\nThe male of Dodona Elvira was described by Staudinger in \"Iris,\" Vol. IX. p. 239, pl. V, fig. 6, (1896), together with many other new Bornean species. Females of this species are extremely rare, for though I have caught over one hundred males, I have only been able to secure one female; as that sex has never been described, I do so willingly here:\u2014Larger than male. Upperside ochreous; forewing with base broadly shaded with fuscous, a black spot or costal margin continuous with a fuscous discal fascia, a short line of the same colour, closing the cell and almost fused with the discal fascia. Another black spot on the costal margin, continuous with a very pale fuscous fascia, apex and external margin broadly bordered with black. The border containing some obsolete, ochreous, submarginal spots. Hindwing as in the male. Underside ground-colour more rufous\nThe fascias are white, tinged with ochreous, instead of silvery, and fascia No. 4 on the forewing is very broad, fusing with the white litura which in the male occurs at the base of the second median interspace. Expanse 48 mm. Matang, 3,000 feet. June 1897.\n\nON THE SYSTEM OF CATALOGUING ADOPTED IN THE SARAWAK MUSEUM\n\nIn the year 1874 an American, Mr. Melvill Dewey, invented and published a system for classifying and cataloguing scientific and other literature by means of employing decimal numbers, this system is known as the Dewey Decimal System. Curiously enough it has received but a small amount of attention in England and her dependencies, a most astonishing fact when one compares its perfect method and simplicity with the systems now in vogue in the majority of large home and colonial libraries. Mr. Dewey is in short the Bertillon of scientific cataloguing, less fortunate than his distinguished prototype, inasmuch as he has still to receive a wide-spread recognition.\n\nThe system consists of dividing the subjects, on which literature has been produced, into groups; to each group a number is assigned: each group is subdivided and each subdivision is characterised by a decimal number, following the group number. Thus, under such a number as 600 would be found all works dealing with Geography; a subdivision of this, Europe, would have the number 600.1; Asia, 600.2, etc. The countries making up these main divisions would again have a number\u2014England 600.11, Scotland 600.12, Ireland 600.13, etc., etc., whilst still greater subdivision can be provided for by the addition of another decimal, thus:\u2014Bedfordshire 600.11.1. Naturally enough countless modifications of this system have been suggested and tried.\n\nOn contemplating the somewhat chaotic system, or rather, lack of system, employed in cataloguing the zoological specimens in the Sarawak Museum, it seemed to me advisable to recatalogue the collections by means of a modification of the Dewey Decimal System. Each class of animals was marked with a letter:\u2014Mammals, A. Birds, B. Reptiles, C. Amphibia, D. Fishes, E. Each family of these classes was numbered in order\n1, 2, 3, etc., each genus with a decimal number following the family number, each species with another decimal number following that of the genus. Let me illustrate this with an example taken from the catalogue of Fishes.\n\nClass Pisces = E\n\nOrder 1. Plagiostomata\n\nSub-order. Selachoid\u00e6\n\nFam. Carcharid\u00e6 = E 1\n\nGenus Carcharias = E 1.1\n\nSpecies laticaudus = E 1.1.1\n\nwith specimens a, b, c, d.\n\nSpecies acutus = E 1.1.2.\n\nwith specimens a, b, c, d., etc.\n\nFam. Lamnid\u00e6 = E 2\n\nGenus Lanna = E 2.1.\n\nand so on.\n\nBy this means all necessity of check lists, registers and double entries is obviated; a glance at the catalogue reveals the number of specimens of any given species in the collection, the number of duplicates (if any), the desiderata, the number of species in a genus, of genera in a family, whilst the labels of the individual specimens with numbers corresponding to the catalogue numbers are equally eloquent.\n\nIn cataloguing zoological or botanical specimens by this decimal system, one meets with a difficulty which does not occur in cataloguing literature, since literature can be grouped under subject-headings which always remain constant, such as Geography, Geology, Meteorology, etc.; but every biologist knows that new species, new genera, even new families are constantly being created by the systematist, either from newly discovered forms or by the splitting up of old assemblages (for example the Eastern members of the genus Sciurus have been recently divided by Mr. Oldfield Thomas into five genera), all of which necessitates the interpolation of new catalogue numbers into the pre-existing series, and I must confess that, as yet, I have been unable to evolve a perfectly satisfactory means of coping with this difficulty. New species may generally be readily disposed of by being added on to those already catalogued, but new genera cannot be so treated, since, by so doing, they may be separated\nfrom their nearest allies; and the same holds good when treating with new families. It is, of course, necessary when writing the catalogue, to enter and number in order every species, genus and family already recorded from the area in which the collections are made, whether or no the collection undergoing cataloguing contains all those species and genera; if this is done, a double advantage is secured\u2014the dreaded interpolation is only needed when new species or genera are discovered, and the catalogue becomes a complete faunistic list of the collected-over area, and the importance of such faunistic list is well-recognised by every museum curator. My own method of interpolating new genera into a previously catalogued series has been as follows:\u2014The new genus is numbered with a fractional number, the numerator of such a fraction being the number of the nearest ally of the new genus. The denominator the last two figures of the year in which the new genus was described. For example, let us imagine that a new genus closely allied to *Hestia* was discovered this year. The number of genus *Hestia* in the Sarawak Museum catalogue of Lepidoptera is He 1.1. The new genus would consequently be numbered He $\\frac{1}{1}$: the number is cumbersome and somewhat destroys the symmetry of the series, but it is significant, and that feature I have endeavoured to hold constantly in view during my re-cataloguing labours.\n\nR. H. Shelford.\nThe Hot Springs of Ulu Jelai.\n\nBy A. D. Machado.\n\nHaving recently occasion to visit the extreme Ulu of the Jelai district, Pahang, in connection with certain prospecting operations which I was then undertaking for the Malayan (Pahang) Exploration Co., I heard from Sakai aborigines of the existence of hot springs in this neighbourhood. These springs I found to be situated on one of the spurs of the main range of hills dividing Pahang from Perak, about Latitude 4\u00b0 20' N., and Longitude 101\u00b0 30' E. Our Sakai guide, who visited this spot ten or more years ago, described the phenomenon as one eruptive fountain of hot water and steam\u2014the water, according to him, ascending to a considerable height, a true Geyser in fact. I saw quite a different thing. I found seven non-eruptive springs of hot water and steam, the former flowing over sloping terraces or basins of granitic boulders, till finally they joined on to a stream called the Cha-ang, which in turn drained into the Jelai. If the statement of the Sakai is credible, and I have no reason to disbelieve him, there has evidently been a change in the structure of these springs, within the short space of ten years, a very short geological epoch indeed. The usual characteristic sulphurous odour pervaded this place; those curiously fretted rims of the boulders over which the water flowed, due doubtless to the deposition of Silica, sulphur, etc., are also noticeable here. Wild animals, elephants, rhinoceri, deer, etc., visit this spot periodically, judging by their old and fresh tracks, probably for their saline properties, while the Sakais hold this place in great awe and veneration. They seemed quite unable to account for this phenomenon, all the explanation they could give being that they thought it was the work of \"hantus.\" These springs are, in their geological formation, similar to those visited by me in Maliwun, Lower Burma, in Renong, Siamese Malaya, and in other parts of the Malay Peninsula; though, in point of size and importance,\nthey approximate those of Ojigoku in the Hakone district of Japan.\n\nI feel here tempted to say a word in regard to this little-known district of Ulu Jelai. Doubtless for services rendered, the whole of this district has been assigned, or rather alienated by the Pahang Government to the Datoh Maharaja Puba of Jelai, otherwise and better known as the Toh Raja Jelai, who alone has the right to exploit it. With the exception of a dozen Malays, dependents of Toh Raja, who live at a place called Kwala Betok, the furthest Malay outpost up the Jelai, this district is inhabited exclusively by Sakais. These Sakais plant hill paddy for the Toh Raja and tapioca root for themselves, and do in consequence much unnecessary destruction to valuable timber forests. The ten or a dozen Malays at Kwala Betok have established a kind of an octroi or tithes station, where they exact from the Sakai their pound of flesh for the privilege of cultivating Toh Raja's land, though, to do the Sakais justice, they try by all kinds of subterfuge to evade the payment of these dues\u2014a case of \"diamond cut diamond.\" These Malays will tell you that the Sakais are cunning, unreliable and great cheats; while the Sakais, on the other hand, will tell you that the Malays are hard task-masters, are cruel and merciless\u2014a case again of the \"pot calling the kettle black.\" Taken all in all, this district is fairly rich in economic and mineral products. Rattans are plentiful, and so is Kayu Gaharu (Aquilaria Malaccensis) in a lesser degree, while Gutta of almost every description abounds, Gutta Rambong (Ficus Elastica) growing wild in places. Of minerals, gold is known to exist; indeed, I have only just located two lodes, which I have my reasons to hope may eventually pay to work. On the Betok, a stream which takes its rise in Ulu Lipis, and which drains into the Jelai at the aforesaid Kwala Betok, having an equal volume of water with the latter stream, tin ore is extremely plentiful and easy to work; so much so, that there is reason to believe that before long a very thriving mining centre will spring up in this corner of the Jelai. The Jelai River, in its upper reaches, abounds in gorges and rapids, formidable obstructions to navigation, thus nullifying its utility as a highway. To those who are venturesome, a descent in bamboo rafts affords exciting experiences.\nThis book is not to be taken from the Library\n\n5/23/85\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-09-26",
