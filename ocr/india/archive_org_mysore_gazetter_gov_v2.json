Its greatest length is from north to south, the distance between the extreme points being 85 miles. From east to west it measures 60 miles.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 3,061 square miles; of which some 1,398 square miles are under cultivation, and 961 square miles are unculturable and waste, or otherwise not available for cultivation.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded north-east by the Kolar District, north-west by the Tumkur District, and south-west by the Mysore District; on the south-east it is bounded by the Salem District of the Madras Presidency, and for 10 miles on the south the river Kaveri separates it from the Coimbatore District of that Presidency, narrowing at one point to what is called the m\u0113ke-d\u0101\u1e6du or Goat's leap.\n\nTaluqs.\u2014It is subdivided into the following taluqs: Closepet is a sub-taluq included in Channapatna:\n\n| No. | Taluq         | Area, sq.

The eastern portion includes the upper basin of the Southern Pin\u00e1kini (or Pennar), the western a small part of that of the Shimsha.\n\nA line drawn north and south from Nandidroog to the west of Bangalore and thence to Anekal would run along the highest part of the ridge of land which separates the Arkavati valley from that of the S. Pin\u00e1kini. The elevation of this rising ground at Bangalore, one of the highest parts of the Mysore table-land, is 3,050 feet above the level of the sea, measured at the base of the Resident's flagstaff. At the mantapam or watch-tower on the Oy\u00e1li-dinne, two miles to the north of Bangalore, which is the highest point, the elevation is 3,118 feet at the base of the observatory.\n\nParallel with this watershed, which forms the eastern boundary of the Kaveri river system in Mysore, is a broken chain of rocky hills, extending from the west of the Nelamangala taluq, through the taluqs of Magadi, Channapatna, and Kankanhalli, and occasionally rising into lofty mountain peaks, such as Sivaganga and S\u00e1vandurga. Beyond this western belt the surface waters, commencing from the west of Magadi, run southwards into the Shimsha.\n\nThe central, northern, and eastern portions of the District are open and undulating. The low-lying grounds are occupied with series of tanks for cultivation, formed by embanking the streams of the valleys, and varying in size from small ponds to considerable lakes. The upland tracts are often bare or covered with low scrub jungle. Westward the country is broken and rugged, being composed of a succession of hills and valleys, intersected by rocky and sandy streams, having a great fall. To the south, where the general level of the land declines towards the Kaveri, the hills are closer together and surrounded with thick jungle.\n\nThe following heights above the level of the sea will serve to show the general elevation of the upper plain surface. In the centre, Bangalore, High Ground, 3,067 feet; Sompur in the west, 3,088 feet; Betta Halsur in the north, 2,994 feet; Kadgodi in the east, 2,856 feet; Kankanhalli in the south, 2,064 feet.\n\nRocks.\u00b9\u2014The prevailing rock is gneiss, disrupted by trap seams, dikes and large out-crops, and also by porphyritic and fine-grained granitic rocks, rock crystal, amethystic, smoky and milky quartz. Adularia, pink felspar, chert, corundum, chalcedony, mica and hornblende are found in considerable quantities. Quartzose pebbles, that\n\n\u00b9 The following paragraphs are chiefly from a note by Colonel Puckle.\nbear a high polish, are also found in the river beds. H\u00e4matitic iron ore is abundant, and a nodular limestone of considerable value is found in the valleys, while near Kankanhalli there is a formation of industrial lime, some of which bears a tolerable polish. It is very pure and makes good polished chunam.\n\nBuilding Stone.\u2014The gneissose rock is everywhere abundant and is extensively quarried for building purposes. Large slabs, of from 3 inches to 2 feet in thickness, are readily obtained by the simple application of heat to the surface. Then, by pooling small holes in the required direction and wedging, the stone can be separated with great precision into pieces of almost any dimensions. Pillars thus prepared and 25 feet in length have been extensively employed as telegraph posts, while in the Central College at Bangalore single stones 35 feet high and not more than 15 inches square have been used to support the roof. They are formed into light columns by a coating of chunam, and are a great improvement on the old massive style of brick-in-chunam pillars that took up so much space. Stone is also employed for architraves, for culvert girders up to 8 or 9 feet span (they are not safe above this on account of the preliminary burning process used in quarrying them) and for a variety of other useful purposes. It is easily quarried into a flat-bedded building material, and arches of coursed hammer-dressed stone have been constructed with great economy and success, the face of the work presenting almost the appearance of dressed stone, though in no instance has the chisel been used. Good examples may be seen at Dod-Ballapur, where the first bridge of the kind was built in 1857; at the fifth mile on the Mysore road, where one of 50 feet span is built; at the eighteenth mile on the Tumkur road, where the newly-constructed bridge stood the rush of water from five tanks, breached at the same time, over its parapets, without a crack being anywhere visible. For partly hammer-dressed and partly chisel-dressed work, the Bangalore Railway Stations offer excellent examples, or the Maharaja's Palace. Thin slabs of stone have also been used for partition walls of houses where economy of space was desirable.\n\nRoad Metal.\u2014It is used, broken up, for road metal, but from the difference of the decay of the materials composing the rock it does not seem suitable. The tough trap rock, of which there is so large a quantity, might perhaps be substituted for it with advantage, or broken quartz.\n\nClays.\u2014Potters' clay is found in not large quantities, but it is well worked up by the native potters, though their insufficient method of burning the biscuit renders the ware more brittle than it might be.\nThere are many kaolinitic clays of a highly refractory character, and if these were duly admixed with the potters\u2019 clay and hard-fired in proper furnaces, much improvement in the manufactured material would be the result. The white clay is the best and stands great heat. Specimens of it were sent to Mr. Minton, and very favourably reported on, but the coloured kinds were mixed with so much oxide and other foreign matter as, to be pronounced of not much economic value. Excellent fire and cornice bricks, and mouldings of all shapes, can be made of this material, and in a trial made in 1862 an artificial stone was produced that took a fair polish. Materials for glazing pottery are also procurable about Bangalore. In 1883 as many as twenty-four different specimens of clays were sent to the Calcutta Exhibition, and received favourable reports. The clay at Whitefield has attracted special attention at times.\n\nSoils.\u2014The prevailing soil is the red or kempu. It is a red loam of great fertility, and is found in every variety of colour from light to dark red, and deep chocolate. It generally overlies the metamorphic granite in varying depths from a few inches to several feet. The darker, rich red and chocolate soils are supposed to be the result of the weathering down to mould of the trap rocks, which are everywhere visible in seams and out-crops, having disrupted and overlaid the normal gneissose rock, disintegrating it and tilting the strata in every conceivable way at the points of disruption and contact. Granitic rocks of a porphyritic character are also weathering down in a red soil of much fertility, in which dry crops grow well, and which the natives consider a first-class soil. But the spontaneous growth of fine hari\u0101li and of some true grasses, and the rich and healthy appearance of the trees growing in the trap soil, show that any culture will with ordinary attention succeed, and that its capabilities are not sufficiently appreciated. Some cultivators, however, who know its value, state that with proper attention it will yield an eighty-fold return. The decomposition of the normal gneissose rock gives the saulu earth, the grey, sandy and sterile soils, and the kaolinitic clays. There are a few isolated tracts of black soil, but not sufficient to induce the special cultivation usual in such ground.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate of Bangalore is noted for its salubrity. It seems well suited to the constitution both of Europeans and natives, epidemics being of rare occurrence and other diseases of a mild character. Those portions of the District lying north and east of Bangalore partake of the same generally healthy character. The taluqs traversed by the western range of hills are, on the other hand, subject to malarious fevers.\nFrom January to March the wind is variable. A pleasant breeze often blows from the south and west in the early morning, but as the sun\u2019s heat increases the wind sets strongly from the north-east and gradually drops as sunset approaches. The sky during this season is bright and cloudless. In April the wind chops about suddenly from easterly to westerly, and there are occasional thunder showers. The weather is sometimes sultry and oppressive, at other times storms of wind and dust are prevalent: clouds often bank up heavily in the east and travel round to west, ending not in rain but in a thick dust storm. May is generally sultry, with variable breezes and occasional high winds and thunder storms. Towards the end of the month the wind settles in the S.S.W., in which quarter there is much sheet lightning. In June and July the weather is cloudy, with a high S.W. wind which ought to bring abundance of rain. With some intermission similar weather continues till October, when the wind changes round to the east and north-east, whence the heaviest rains are expected. These continue into November, and are succeeded by bright sunny days and cold foggy mornings. From December to May there is usually little or no rain.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The mean temperature deduced from observations at Bangalore is $76^\\circ 2$. The mean diurnal range is $15^\\circ 6$, but the extreme range marked in any one day varies from $18$ in October and November to $30$ and $32$ in February and March. The extreme annual range recently recorded has been $45$ degrees, between a minimum of $52$ in January 1894 and a maximum of $97$ in April of the same year. The following is a summary of mean meteorological results from the registers of the Bangalore observatory for 1893 and 1894, in the former of which the rainfall was about the average, and in the latter, below it.\n| Year | Barometer | Thermometers | Aqueous Vapour | Wind | Rain | Cloud |\n|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------|------|-------|\n|      | Red. to 32\u00b0 F. | Red. to Sea Level | Daily Range | Mean | Max. | Min. | Range | Mean | Min | Pressure in Inches | Humidity Per Cent | Daily Velocity Miles | Mean Direction | Fall in Inches | Number of Days | Mean Per Cent | Cloudless 10h. to 16 h. | Overcast |\n| 1893 |           |              |              | Mean | Max. | Min. | Range | Mean | Min |                |                 |                  |               |                | Number of Days |               |               |               |\n|      |           |              |              |       |       |       |        |       |       |                |                 |                  |               |                |               |               |               |               |\n| January | '946 | '845 | '124 | 70\u00b06 | 82\u00b02 | 57\u00b09 | 24\u00b03 | 58\u00b09 | 56\u00b03 | '428 | 58 | 171 | E.S.E. | 0\u00b003 | 1 | 17 | 13 | 0 |\n| February | '970 | '846 | '131 | 74\u00b03 | 86\u00b02 | 61\u00b00 | 25\u00b01 | 61\u00b03 | 58\u00b04 | '458 | 54 | 129 | S.E. by S. | 0\u00b036 | 3 | 14 | 11 | 0 |\n| March | '932 | '793 | '138 | 77\u00b03 | 88\u00b04 | 65\u00b00 | 23\u00b04 | 63\u00b06 | 61\u00b00 | '499 | 54 | 146 | S.E. by S. | 1\u00b057 | 3 | 15 | 12 | 0 |\n| April | '874 | '699 | '129 | 81\u00b05 | 93\u00b06 | 67\u00b04 | 26\u00b02 | 64\u00b02 | 61\u00b01 | '481 | 45 | 146 | S. | 2\u00b009 | 5 | 22 | 5 | 0 |\n| May | '829 | '675 | '123 | 79\u00b00 | 89\u00b04 | 67\u00b08 | 21\u00b06 | 67\u00b04 | 65\u00b03 | '614 | 62 | 154 | W. | 1\u00b019 | 10 | 47 | 0 | 1 |\n| June | '803 | '680 | '089 | 74\u00b05 | 82\u00b03 | 66\u00b04 | 15\u00b09 | 67\u00b01 | 65\u00b02 | '642 | 75 | 198 | S.W. by W. | 5\u00b096 | 14 | 64 | 0 | 3 |\n| July | '812 | '700 | '092 | 72\u00b08 | 79\u00b07 | 66\u00b00 | 13\u00b07 | 66\u00b08 | 65\u00b02 | '646 | 81 | 173 | W. by S. | 5\u00b084 | 21 | 89 | 0 | 5 |\n| August | '841 | '727 | '098 | 73\u00b04 | 80\u00b02 | 65\u00b06 | 14\u00b08 | 66\u00b03 | 64\u00b06 | '618 | 75 | 194 | W. by S. | 1\u00b091 | 15 | 76 | 0 | 3 |\n| Sept. | '866 | '750 | '112 | 73\u00b06 | 81\u00b07 | 64\u00b08 | 16\u00b09 | 65\u00b05 | 63\u00b03 | '600 | 70 | 178 | W. by S. | 5\u00b031 | 11 | 75 | 1 | 2 |\n| October | '880 | '779 | '112 | 70\u00b05 | 79\u00b09 | 64\u00b07 | 15\u00b02 | 66\u00b01 | 64\u00b00 | '629 | 76 | 105 | \u2014 | 9\u00b083 | 18 | 65 | 0 | 1 |\n| Nov. | '936 | '849 | '102 | 70\u00b08 | 77\u00b08 | 63\u00b03 | 14\u00b05 | 64\u00b08 | 62\u00b05 | '633 | 80 | 172 | E. | 2\u00b082 | 10 | 64 | 0 | 6 |\n| Dec. | '989 | '907 | '115 | 68\u00b03 | 78\u00b05 | 56\u00b04 | 22\u00b00 | 58\u00b05 | 54\u00b00 | '460 | 65 | 181 | E. by N. | 0\u00b002 | 1 | 15 | 12 | 0 |\n| Year | '889 | '771 | '114 | 73\u00b09 | 83\u00b05 | 63\u00b08 | 19\u00b07 | 64\u00b02 | 61\u00b07 | '559 | 66 | 162 | \u2014 | 36\u00b093 | 112 | 47 | 54 | 21 |\n\nTotal.\n| Barometer. | Thermometers. | Aqueous Vapour. | Wind. | Rain. | Cloud. |\n|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|-------|--------|\n|            | Dry Bulb.     | Wet Bulb.       | Mean.

The table includes data from January to December, with specific entries indicating conditions like dry bulb temperatures, wet bulb temperatures, dew point, and other related measurements.\nRainfall.\u2014The mean average rainfall is 35 inches in the year, distributed over from 80 to 90 days. The heaviest fall occurs generally during the prevalence of the N.E. monsoon, about October. As a general rule the showers fall in the afternoon and evening, rainy mornings being of rare occurrence. The accompanying figures, giving the annual fall of rain at Bangalore from the year 1837, will show the extent of variation.\n\n| Year | In. c. | Year | In. c. | Year | In. c. | Year | In. c. |\n|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|\n| 1837 | 44'3  | 1852 | 55'1  | 1867 | 28'44 | 1881 | 27'44 |\n| 1838 | 16    | 1853 | 34'7  | 1868 | 38'89 | 1882 | 36'16 |\n| 1839 | 32'4  | 1854 | 29'9  | 1869 | 40'42 | 1883 | 34'80 |\n| 1840 | 30'2  | 1855 | 27'1  | 1870 | 31'9  | 1884 | 23'11 |\n| 1841 | 38    | 1856 | 48'3  | 1871 | 29'12 | 1885 | 39'75 |\n| 1842 | 31'2  | 1857 | 30'4  | 1872 | 40'45 | 1886 | 44'79 |\n| 1843 | 37'2  | 1858 | 37'8  | 1873 | 29'16 | 1887 | 33'99 |\n| 1844 | 34'4  | 1859 | 26'6  | 1874 | 56'65 | 1888 | 29'45 |\n| 1845 | 32'7  | 1860 | 33'2  | 1875 | 22'20 | 1889 | 36'73 |\n| 1846 | 40    | 1861 | 30'1  | 1876 | 17'16 | 1890 | 44'08 |\n| 1847 | 37'5  | 1862 | 37'3  | 1877 | 39'28 | 1891 | 24'44 |\n| 1848 | 40'3  | 1863 | 35'8  | 1878 | 40'81 | 1892 | 26'95 |\n| 1849 | 27'8  | 1864 | 37'62 | 1879 | 40'67 | 1893 | 37'04 |\n| 1850 | 49'4  | 1865 | 36    | 1880 | 51'70 | 1894 | 31'94 |\n| 1851 | 35'3  | 1866 | 33'8  |      |       |      |       |\n\nThe quantity registered for 1838, only 16 inches, stands by itself, and is exceptionally low, but 1876, with 17'16 inches, was not much better. Omitting these years of singular drought, the range has been from 23'11 inches in 1884 to 56'65 in 1874. The other occasions on which the fall exceeded 50 inches was in 1852, when 55'1 inches were registered, and 1880, with 51'70 inches. Grouping them in the following manner:\n\n- Below 20 inches: 2\n- 20 to 25 inches: 3\n- 25 to 30 inches: 10\n- 30 to 35 inches: 14\n\n- 35 to 40 inches: 15\n- 40 to 45 inches: 9\n- 45 to 50 inches: 2\n- Above 50 inches: 3\n\nwe find that, in the 58 years, 29, or one-half, had a rainfall below 35, and 29 a rainfall above that. In 24 years the fall was within 10 inches of defect, and in 24 it was within 10 inches of excess. The chances, therefore, are against a fall of less than 25 or more than 45 inches in any one year in general.\n\nVegetation.\u2014Forest.\u2014The earliest accounts describe the District as covered with forest, forming a part of the great Dandak\u00e1ranya. The distinctive names have been preserved of some of the wooded tracts, such as the Chandan\u00e1ranya (sandal forest) on the Arkavati near Nelamangala; the Ganj\u00e1ranya (forest of the *abrus precatorius*) around Sivaganga; the Kund\u00e1ranya (jasmin forest) at Devanhalli, &c.\n\nThe following trees and plants enumerated as growing in these woods may be taken to represent the indigenous

when Devanhalli, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote and other chief places were founded, the original settlers are related to have commenced operations by clearing the surrounding forest.\n\nAt the present day the hilly taluqs of Magadi and Kankanhalli contain the greatest proportion of jungle. Trees and bushes grow abundantly, especially in the ravines between the heights. In Kankanhalli there is much fuel jungle and good forest of karachi (Hardwickia binata). The best forests in the taluq lie to the east of the Arkavati. Besides acacias, the dindiga (conocarpus latifolia) yielding a valuable gum, and the jalari or lac tree (vatika lacciferi) are abundant. The Channapatna taluq is also hilly, but the tree vegetation is smaller. The remaining taluqs north and east are fairly wooded with trees in the long and hollow valleys of the downs. The most common is the honge (pongamia glabra), a valuable tree which fringes many tank bunds and often grows to a large size. Oil is extracted from the seeds, and the leaves are used as manure for sugar-cane. Acacias grow freely, and chennuge (lagerstroemia parviflora) and huluve are frequent. There is much scrub jungle around Ujani-betta and along the western border of the Dod-Ballapur and Nelamangala taluqs.\n\nThe different kinds of ficus, the mango, tamarind, mohwah or ippe, jack, and jamun or nerale, all grow well, together with many varieties of acacia, the wood-apple, bael-tree and some bamboo. The sandal grows in Bangalore, Kankanhalli, Magadi and Channapatna taluqs.\n\nAmong shrubs and useful bushes are the kakke (cassia fistula), tangadi (cassia auriculata) and kusambe (carthamus tinctorius); also the wild date (phoenix sylvestris), which yields toddy.\n\n**Reserved Forests.**\u2014The State forests cover an area of 312 square miles. The following are their names and areas:\n\n| Bilikal | ... | 42 |\n|---------|-----|----|\n| Savandurg | ... | 17 |\n| Handigundi | ... | 30 |\n| Chilandadi | ... | 37 |\n| Basavanbetta | ... | 37 |\n| Makali | ... | 39 |\n| Ragihalli | ... | 9 |\n| Dod Ballapur | ... | 13 |\n| Mugur | ... | 34 |\n| Kumbalgod | ... | 2 |\n| Kabbaldurg | ... | 12 |\n| Hultar | ... | 8 |\n| Tenginakal | ... | 16 |\n| Banantimari | ... | 6 |\n| Mannugudda | ... | 10 |\n\n**Arboriculture.**\u2014**Plantations.**\u2014The great demand for fuel created by the railway and the increasing consumption at Bangalore have led to the formation of fuel plantations both by Government and by private individuals. The common *cassia florida* and the *casuarina muricata* have been largely planted in the reserves. The former grows freely if treated as a pollard, otherwise it is apt to die out suddenly. The latter is the tree principally cultivated of late years. **Avenues** have been planted along all the public roads, 542 miles in length, the best growing\nindigenous trees being generally employed for the purpose. These consist of the mango, figs, honge, and nerale, which are raised in nurseries and then transplanted.\n\nGroves of trees called topes are numerous. They are planted by natives near wells or tanks, as works of merit, for the shelter of travellers. The mango and the ippe appear to be preferred for the purpose in this District. The former is an umbrageous and handsome tree of symmetrical form, and grows well. Village topes have also been formed by order of Government, which should prove of great use as camping grounds, besides improving the appearance of the country. The number of topes in 1894 was 2,118, containing 106,103 trees.\n\nOrnamental trees have been introduced into the station of Bangalore in great variety. The *poinciana regia* or \"flame of the forest,\" with its splendid scarlet blossoms, has become quite common. The *spathodea*, with a still more gorgeous flower of deep orange tint, is also met with on all sides. Numerous coniferous trees have been cultivated with success, including *araucaria* and other varieties of pine. The Java fig, a graceful and fast-growing tree, with glossy and delicate foliage, has been much planted in gardens, as well as the Moreton Bay chestnut and the *grevillea robusta*. Many of these trees also find their way into the taluq stations and into compounds of the dawk bungalows.\n\nHedges consisting of the thorny *sige h\u00e1yi* or soap-nut exist round many villages, forming an impenetrable thicket, originally designed as a defence. Such an enclosure formerly surrounded the native town of Bangalore. But hedgerows between the fields are very unusual. The aloe and the kalli or milk hedge (*euphorbia tirucalli*) are most commonly used as fences by native farmers, with the lakkili (*vitex negundo*) and the k\u00e1du haralu (*jatropha curacu*). The *lantana*, however, bids fair to supersede every other hedge-plant on account of its easy propagation. Unless frequently trimmed it has a tendency to become rank, and spreads itself with wonderful rapidity, choking other vegetation.\n\nCrops.\u2014The principal cultivation consists of dry crops, among which the most prominent is r\u00e1gi (*cleusine corocana*), the staple food of the people. Avare or cow-gram (*dolichos lablab*) is sown in lines with the r\u00e1gi, and is the pulse most frequently eaten with it. Jola or millet (*sorghum vulgare*), also sown with the r\u00e1gi, is in this District only used as fodder for cattle. Horse-gram (*dolichos biflorus*) is largely grown in the poorer soils, and as a substitute when r\u00e1gi fails. It is the general food for cattle, and is also used as a pulse for human food. Various oil-seeds are also raised to a considerable extent, such as wollellu and huchellu (two kinds of sesamum), and haralu (castor-oil). Mulberry cultivation for the support of silk-worms, which forms an\nimportant branch of industry among the Muhammadans, at one time much declined owing to the losses arising from continued mortality among the insects, but it has now revived. Opium was produced in Devanhalli and Dod-Ballapur taluqs, until its cultivation was prohibited, and tobacco is grown in several parts.\n\nPaddy cultivation in the Bangalore District (Mr. Ricketts has remarked) is for the most part uncared for by the ryots, whereas much attention is paid to dry crops, which yield in abundance, and also provide for the greater part of the year the necessary fodder for cattle. Excepting at wells and under very large tanks, he is inclined to think that in Bangalore,\u2014where there are no canals,\u2014the wet crops are more uncertain than the dry. A species of blight often attacks paddy crops. The baddiyi system, too, may have originally led to the ryot's not caring to labour for the benefit of the Government, and thus to expending all his manure and most of his labour on his dry crops. One exception (he adds) must be made as regards wet cultivation, and that is concerning sugar-cane. This product is highly manured and cared for, and yields considerable profits. But sugar-cane is seldom planted in places where a failure of tank-water cannot be supplemented by irrigation from wells.\n\nThe success which attended an experimental plantation of coffee near Bangalore has led to land being taken up of late years for the same purpose in maid\u00e1n parts of the District, but the enterprise has not yet passed out of the experimental stage.\n\nThe following is a list of the chief cultivated products of the District:\n\n| Kannada Name | Botanical Name          | English Name         |\n|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Cereals**  |                         |                      |\n| Baragu       | Panicum miliaceum       | Common millet        |\n| Bhatta or Nellu | Oryza sativa           | Rice                 |\n| Godhi        | Triticum sativum        | Wheat                |\n| H\u00e1raka       | Panicum semiverticillatum |                     |\n| Jola         | Sorghum vulgare         | Great millet         |\n| Navane       | Panicum italicum        | Italian millet       |\n| R\u00e1gi         | Eleusine corocana       | R\u00e1gi                 |\n| Sajje        | Pennisetum typhoideum   | Spiked millet        |\n| S\u00e1me         | Panicum frumentaceum    | Little millet        |\n| **Pulses**   |                         |                      |\n| Alasandi     | Vigna catiang           | Cow gram             |\n| Avare        | Dolichos lablab         | Green gram           |\n| Hesaru       | Phaseolus mungo         | Horse gram, kulti.   |\n| Hurali       | Dolichos biflorus       | Pigcon pea, doll.    |\n| T\u00f3gari       | Cajanus indicus         | Black gram           |\n| Uddu         | Phaseolus radiatus      |                      |\n| Kannada Name          | Botanical Name                  | English Name       |\n|----------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Oil Seeds\u2014           | Ricinus communis                | Castor-oil.        |\n| Haralu               | Pongamia glabra                 | Honge.             |\n| Huchchellu or Ramtil | Guizotia abyssinica             | Foolish oil.       |\n| Wolljelu             | Sesamum indicum                 | Gingelli.          |\n| Vegetables (Native)\u2014 |                                 |                    |\n| Badane k\u00e4yi          | Solanum melongena               | Brinjal.           |\n| Bende k\u00e4yi           | Hibiscus esculentus             |                   |\n| Bellulli             | Allium sativum                  | Garlic.            |\n| Genasu               | Dioscorea atuleata              | Sweet potato.      |\n| Jirige               | Cuminum cyminum                 | Cumin seed.        |\n| Kalle k\u00e4yi           | Arachis hypogrea                | Ground-nut.        |\n| Kumbala k\u00e4yi         | Cucurbita pepo                  | Pumpkin.           |\n| Mensina k\u00e4yi         | Capsicum annum                  | Chilli.            |\n| Mentya               | Trigonella foenum-graecum       | Fenugreek.         |\n| Nirulli              | Allium cepa                     | Onion.             |\n| Padavala k\u00e4yi        | Trichosanthes anguina           | Snake gourd.       |\n| Sasive               | Brassica nigra                  | Mustard.           |\n| Saute k\u00e4yi           | Cucumis sativus                 | Cucumber.          |\n| Sunti                | Zingiber officinale             | Ginger.            |\n| Miscellaneous\u2014       |                                 |                    |\n| Adike                | Areca catechu                   | Areca nut.         |\n| B\u00e1le                 | Musa sapientum                  | Plantain.          |\n| Hoge soppu           | Nicotiana tabacum               | Tobacco.           |\n| Hunase               | Tamarindus indica               | Tamarind.          |\n| Kabhu                | Saccharum officinale            | Sugar-cane.        |\n| Pundi                | Hibiscus cannabinus             | Dekhan hemp.       |\n| Sige k\u00e4yi            | Mimosa abstergeus               | Soap-nut.          |\n| Tengina k\u00e4yi         | Cocos nucifera                  | Cocoanut.          |\n| Viled-ele            | Piper betle                     | Betel vine.        |\n\n**Garden Produce.**\u2014Besides the productions of the country entered in the foregoing list, vegetables and fruits are raised in large quantities and great variety for the European markets at Bangalore and Madras. Among the former are included potatoes, cauliflowers, peas, asparagus, artichokes, French beans, knolkohl, cabbage, and lettuce; among the latter, apples, peaches, grapes, mangoes, strawberries, figs, guavas, loquats, raspberries, and plantains. The foreign kinds are grown principally in the Bangalore and Devanhalli taluqs.\n\n**Area under Principal Crops.**\u2014The following figures, for 1893, are intended to show approximately the number of acres under cultivation of the chief crops:\u2014Rice, 49,419; r\u0101gi, 357,448; wheat, 16; other food grains, 91,320; vegetables, 9,250; oil seeds, 15,139; sugar-cane, 3,159; cocoanut and areca nut, 8,943; tobacco, 1,148; mulberry, 3,587; fibres, 741.\n\n**Horticulture.**\u2014Horticulture received much impetus after the establishment of the Agri-Horticultural Society at Bangalore in 1839,\nbut more especially, when that had ceased to exist, by the formation of the Lal Bagh as horticultural and botanical gardens in 1856. A profitable means of livelihood was thus opened to native gardeners, some of whom have set up as florists and seedsmen, replenishing their stocks direct from England. Owing to the profusion of beautiful plants that may with care be successfully cultivated here, much taste has been exhibited in the laying out and adornment of gardens, both public and private. Of roses alone, upwards of 258 varieties have been established; of ferns, more than 160 kinds; of crotons, 122; of ornamental flowering shrubs, brilliant foliage plants, gay annuals and gorgeous-blossomed creepers and orchids, an endless number.\\(^1\\) There is reason to believe that hybridising and cross-breeding, which have produced such wonderful results in Europe, might be carried out with great success here.\n\nThe remarkable adaptation of the climate to the out-door cultivation of plants from different parts of the world will be seen from the following list of some growing in the Lal Bagh without any protection whatever:\n\n| From S. America | Acliras sapota, eucharis grandiflora, allamanda grandiflora. |\n|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| \u201e N. America    | Magnolia grandiflora, quercus rubra, phlox paniculata.      |\n| \u201e Cape of Good Hope | Agapanthus umbillatus, melianthus major, gazania splendens. |\n| \u201e South Sea Islands | Acalypha tricolor, crotons.                                  |\n| \u201e Australia     | Castanospermum australe, alsophila latebrosa, coccoloba plotyclada. |\n| \u201e China         | Cupressus funebris, farfugium grande, alternanthera sessilis. |\n| \u201e G. Britain    | Anagalis carrulea, viola odorata, myosotis arvensis.        |\n| \u201e Mexico        | Fuchsia fulgens, ageratum mexicanum, agave americana.        |\n\nThese plants, which in their natural habitats are found at various elevations, are all growing luxuriantly here in the same soil and under the same exposure as the tropical plants of India.\\(^2\\)\n\n**Wild Animals.**\u2014Early legends tenant the ancient forests which covered the District with the following wild animals:\u2014simha, the lion;\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) The names of the principal genera, taken from the catalogue of the Lal Bagh, Bangalore, have been given in Vol. I., at pp. 85 ff.\n\n\\(^2\\) From Mr. Cameron's report on the Lal Bagh. An account of the plants of economic value experimentally introduced here has been included in Vol. I., pp. 169 ff.\ns\u00e1rd\u00fala, the tiger; harina, the deer; kapi, the monkey; bhall\u00faka, the bear; kunjara, the elephant; sr\u00edg\u00e1la, the jackal; mahisha, the buffalo; bidd\u00e1la, the cat; cham\u00e1ra, the yak, or perhaps the bison. The lion, it is needless to say, no longer ranges the forest, nor are the elephant, bison, and wild buffalo now to be met with, though the first is said to appear occasionally in the south of the Kankanhalli taluq. But to the remainder on the list may be added the cheetah or panther, the wild hog, and the porcupine. The larger game, which is not plentiful, is mostly confined to the Magadi, Kankanhalli and Closepet taluqs. Of the smaller animals, field-rats are very numerous. The bandicoot, or large pig-rat, infests stables and the neighbourhood of manure pits.\n\nBirds.\u2014Jungle fowl, pea-fowl and spur fowl are met with in the woods; bustard, floriken; partridge, quail, rock-pigeon in the open country; snipe, teal and wild duck in the tanks and paddy fields. Birds of bright plumage wing their way in every direction, but none that are not common to the country generally.\n\nFish.\u2014The bestars or fishermen are acquainted with the following species of fresh-water fish, caught by them in their nets:\u2014B\u00e1le-minu (sparus spilotus), \u00e1vu minu, korama, kuchchu minu, \u00e1ne minu, marali minu, gende minu, giralu minu, goddale minu, pakke minu, sh\u00edgadi minu, handi gorava, s\u00fale sasile, yemmchelu minu, malagu minu, h\u00fa minu, murave, domme, vonike tatte minu, n\u00e1yi chelu, kallu korava. Those brought to market at Bangalore are principally obtained in the Dharm\u00e1m-budhi and Kemp\u00e1budhi tanks at Bangalore, the Jigani, Hoskote, Bellandur, Vartur, Tallikere, Anekal, Nelamangala, and Hullur tanks.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014These consist principally of horses, cows, bullocks, buffaloes, sheep, goats, asses and pigs, dogs and cats. The following figures, for 1893, show approximately the extent of the agricultural live stock of the District:\u2014Cows and bullocks, 375,015; horses, 288; ponies, 3,139; donkeys, 8,827; sheep and goats, 317,063; pigs, 2,210. Elephants and camels were formerly kept by the Commissariat Department. The last-named are said not to thrive here, and only mules are now kept for transport.\n\nHorses.\u2014Some horses are bred by the Silahdars from country mares and English, Arab or Australian stallions, imported for the purpose by Government. Excellent horses are sometimes reared, but the want of good pasture prevents horse-breeding on an extensive scale. The market, however, is well supplied annually, by dealers, with horses and ponies from Arabia, Persia, Afghanistan, and Dharwar. Most of the Persian and Afghan horses used to be purchased by the Remount D\u00e9p\u00f4t of the Madras Government at Oosoor. The more powerful Australian horses imported to Madras of late years have, among\nEuropeans, nearly superseded all others for carriage use, and to a great extent for riding. The average prices of the various descriptions of horses are:\u2014For Arabs and Australians, Rs. 1,000 and upwards; Persians and Gulf Arabs, from Rs. 500; Afghan, from Rs. 400; Dharwar and Mahratta ponies, from Rs. 200; but the demands of polo have sent up the prices of good ponies to high figures. Besides green grass, horses are generally fed on kulti or horse-gram (dolichos biflorus), which is given boiled morning and evening, mixed with a certain proportion of bran.\n\nBullocks.\u2014These useful animals, of excellent breed, are plentiful. With the exception of a few buffaloes, they are the only animals used for agricultural labour. An average pair of bullocks will plough two acres of unirrigated land a day. They are fed chiefly on r\u0101gi straw, ballar or avare (cow-gram), and the residue of the threshings of dry crops. The price of an ordinary pair of plough-bullocks varies from Rs. 30 to 50 and more; but draught bullocks of a superior kind, fit for carriage or dawk purposes, cost from Rs. 70 to 200 and more. With a light carriage they are capable of trotting the usual stage of six miles in an hour. Bullocks employed for this purpose generally have a feed of boiled horse-gram in the evening. The ryots about Bangalore are very fond of rearing bulls. These are bought as calves from dealers, and, being well fed and cared for, are subsequently resold, at considerable profit, to the ryots of other parts who have not the same favourable opportunities as regards climate and grazing for bringing up good cattle. The principal cattle fairs in the District are held in connection with the Gh\u00e1ti Subrahmanya festival in Dod-Ballapur taluq in December, the Madduramma parishe at Huskur (Anekal taluq) in March, and the Gangadevi parishe at Nallur (Hoskote taluq) in October.\n\nCows.\u2014The common village cows are very inferior animals, owing to the want of proper care and attention. They subsist entirely on the waste lands about the villages and on the stubble-grazing after harvest. Very good cows are reared in Bangalore, where they sell for from Rs. 40 to 80 apiece. They are fed on green fodder, r\u0101gi straw, and the husks of avare, and should yield from three to five quarts a day when in full milk. Dairy farming on any scale is carried on only in Bangalore, and perhaps to a small extent at Whitefield.\n\nCattle-shows were held for some years by Government, at which liberal prizes were given, with the view of promoting an improvement in the breed of domestic cattle. Breeding bulls from the Amrit Mahal have also been stationed at favourable places.\n\nSheep and Goats.\u2014These are numerous and thrive well. The wool of the former, however, is of a coarse description, and used only for\nthe manufacture of native blankets and horse-rugs. An account will be found elsewhere of the experimental sheep farm formerly maintained by Government, and the steps since taken to improve the breed. The quality of the mutton sold in Bangalore has been greatly improved by means of prizes offered by the Municipality at the new market.\n\nPoultry.\u2014There is as much room for improvement in regard to the rearing of poultry as there is in regard to dairy produce generally. The dunghill and the streets are the principal run of the fowls. The great demand which exists for eggs and poultry has resulted in establishing prices which would probably well remunerate any one engaging in this business. Amateur poultry yards are often kept in Bangalore, in which the best laying and fattening foreign breeds, such as Dorkings, Brahmas, Spanish, &c., are successfully reared, in addition to Guinea-fowl, turkeys, geese, and ducks. Some of the settlers in Whitefield have also taken up poultry-farming. Game cocks are kept by natives of many classes for fighting purposes, and for the same object fighting quails are kept by Muhammadans.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe earliest historical legends connected with the Bangalore District relate to Nandagudi in the Hoskote taluq, and to Mankunda near Channapatna in the taluq of that name, at both of which places there are signs of ancient remains. The first is said to have been the capital of Uttunga Bhuja, whose nephews, the Nanda princes, being imprisoned by him, obtained their release and seized the kingdom through the machinations of a sage named Chanikya. Near where Malur now stands, a king named Vijayap\u0101da, of the soma vamsa or lunar line, is related to have established a city named Mukunda or Muganda in the krita yuga or first age.\n\nAlthough the name Nandagudi has evidently given rise to confusion between the origin of that place and the incidents of Chandra Gupta\u2019s usurpation of Nanda\u2019s empire as dramatised in the Mudra Rakshasa, yet the legends exhibit a close connection with the account of the rise of the Andhra or Telugu kings known as the Kakati family. \u201cThe Kakateya family,\u201d says Wilson,\u00b9 \u201cis deduced from the Pandavas, and in general the line proceeds direct from Janamejaya through Satanika to Kshemaka and his two sons, Vijayarka and Somendra. Their sons, named severally Vishnuvardhana and Uttunga Bhuja, disagreeing, the\n\n\u00b9 McK. Coll. I. cxxvi.\nlatter quitted Upper India and settled to the south of the Godavari. His son Nanda, who founded the fort of Nandagiri, married the daughter of the Chola king, by whom he had Vijayap\u0101la. Another account by Taylor\\(^1\\) is as follows:\u2014\u201cThe lunar line is specified down to Kshemaka. From that line are deduced Vijiyaditya and Somendra. The son of the first was Vishnuvardhana; of the other the son was Uttunga Bhuja. These two latter divided the country between them. Vishnuvardhana settled at Dharmapuri\\(^2\\) on the western bank of the Godavari river. Four hundred villages or towns became subject to him. His son was Nanda, who built a town called Nandagiri, in which the four castes of Hindus were located. His minister was named Dandasasi Nayaka. Nanda formed a marriage alliance with the daughter of a Chola king at Kanjevaram, and, on returning, equitably governed his kingdom. His son was Vijayap\u0101la, who was munificent.\u201d The history from which the above is an extract assigns to Vijayap\u0101la the date of about 400 A.D., and he may with some probability be taken as identical with the founder of Makunda, whatever the truth may be as regards the origin of Nandagudi.\n\n**Gangas.**\u2014That Makunda was a place of considerable importance as early as the seventh century is beyond doubt, from the fact that at that period Bh\u016bvikrama and Sivam\u0101ra, two sovereigns of the Ganga line, made it the royal residence. The whole of the District must have been included in the dominions of that dynasty for some centuries before, for it formed part of the Gangav\u00e1di Ninety-six Thousand. A subdivision called Chikka Gangav\u00e1di, or the Lesser Gangav\u00e1di, occupied the valley of the Shimsha, with Honganur (Channapatna taluq) as its chief town. In the eighth century \u015ar\u012bpurusha made M\u0101nyapura (Manne in Nelamangala taluq) the royal residence during some part of his reign, and from the Chola references to the place it must have been important long after.\n\n**Pallavas.**\u2014Pallava and Nolamba inscriptions are met with to the east, in Hoskote and Devanhalli taluqs.\n\n**Rashtrakutas.**\u2014An inscription of the time of Ak\u00e1lavarsha occurs in Devanhalli taluq, and one or two in Hoskote taluq may belong to this line.\n\n**Cholas.**\u2014The traces of the Chola conquest in the eleventh century are numerous in the western taluqs. Their inscriptions are found especially in the vicinity of the Ganga city of Makunda, namely, at Malur, Kudalur, and Mal\u016bratna, the latter indeed receiving the name\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) *Cat. Rais. Or. MSS.* iii. 481.\n\n\\(^2\\) There is a village near Nandagudi named Dharmesvara, which professes to be of great antiquity.\nof Nikarilich\u00f3l\u00e1pura. M\u00e1ga\u1e0di is said to have been founded by a Chola king, and names and inscriptions testify to their influence from there to Nelamangala. In this latter taluq they make a boast of their conquest of Mannai-ka\u1e6dakam, the Manne above-mentioned. This part of the country seems to have been named by them the Vikramach\u00f3lamandala. Chola-Ganga, described as the great king of Orissa, is said in an inscription of the twelfth century to have been born in the Hejj\u00e1ji Twelve of the K\u00e1danur Seventy (Dod Ballapur taluq). To the east we have Chola inscriptions in Hoskote taluq, which it would appear was included in the Kolar country designated the Nikarilich\u00f3lamandala.\n\n**Hoysalas.**\u2014Inscriptions of the Hoysala kings in all parts attest their dominion over the District, and to V\u00edra Ball\u00e1la, probably the one who reigned from 1172 to 1219, is attributed the adventure which gave Bangalore its name, as related in connection with that place. Vishnuvarddhana\u2019s first queen, S\u2019\u00e1ntala-devi, died at S\u2019ivaganga, which seems to have been a possession of her father\u2019s. In the thirteenth century, when the Hoysala territories were divided between N\u00e1rasimha III. and his brother, or half-brother, R\u00e1man\u00e1tha, the latter had the northern parts of the District included in his possessions, and held his court at Kund\u00e1na in Devanhalli taluq. A number of inscriptions occur, especially in the Yelahanka country, of the last days of the Hoysalas, in the time of Ball\u00e1la III., when he had his residence at Unn\u00e1male (Tiruvann\u00e1malai, Trinomalai, South Arcot). In one he is described as living at Vir\u00fap\u00e1kshipura, perhaps the one in Channapatna taluq.\n\n**Yadavas.**\u2014To the time of these kings, who were rivals of the Hoysalas, perhaps belongs the tradition of a city north of the village of Binnanangala in the Nelamangala taluq. The sthala-purana of Stambhodadhi (Kammasandra) contains at length an account of how, in the dvapara yuga or second age, a prince named Sum\u00e1ti, the son of Hemachandra, king of Karnata-desa, came by his father\u2019s command from the capital city of Yadu-patna, and, after a march of thirteen days, arrived at Devarayadurga (Tumkur District), where he besieged a robber chief named Andhaka, alias Lingaka, for one year, and finally seized and put him to death with all his family and relations; and how he then established a city named Bh\u00famandana, on the site above described, and took up his residence there for the security of that part of his father\u2019s dominions. This story may possibly relate to Rama-chandra, here corrupted into Hemachandra.\n\n**Vijayanagar.**\u2014Under the Vijayanagara sovereigns, who subsequently became paramount in the south, arose the local rulers of greatest note in the modern annals of the District.\nMorasu Wokkalu.\u2014It is related that about the end of the fourteenth century a party of travellers, consisting of seven farmers with their families, halted at the foot of a hill named Ramaswami-betta, to the east of Nandidurga. From their having arrived in carts they were called the bandi k\u0101palu or cart ryots, which may either indicate that carts were an unusual sight or have been equivalent to \"carriage people,\" denoting the possession of greater wealth than those among whom they came to settle. They were of Telugu origin and subsequently became known as the Morasu Wokkalu, a name still borne by a large section of ryots in this District. They were worshippers of Baire Deva, and had the strange custom of amputating the ring and little fingers of the right hand of their daughters before marriage. The leader of the band was Rana Baire Gauda, who had been forced to fly from the village of Alur, near Conjeveram, in order to preserve his daughter Doddamma from mesalliance with a powerful suitor of lower caste. The fugitives, escaping along the banks of the Palar, were at one point in imminent danger of falling into the hands of their pursuers, when the girl who was the innocent cause of the flight invoking the aid of Ganga and casting her earring into the water as an offering, the river miraculously divided, allowing her whole party to cross, and then interposed its swollen current to baffle the pursuers.\n\nOn the night of their encampment on the spot before mentioned Rana Baire Gauda was directed in a dream to settle in that neighbourhood. They accordingly built some huts and formed the village of Ahuti, now Avati, north of Devanhalli. But before long they resolved to separate. Rana Baire Gauda remained at Avati and his son was the founder of Devanhalli, Dod-Ballapura and Chik-Ballapura; Sanna Baire Gauda betook himself to Holuvanhalli or Korampur, and founded Kortagere (Tumkur District); Timme Gauda went to Sugatur near Jangamkote, and became the ruler of Kolar and Punganur and the founder of Hoskote, while a descendant of his founded Anekal. The destination of three others is not known, but the seventh established himself at Yelahanka.\n\nJaya Gauda.\u2014This was Jaya Gauda, who acquired the title of Yelahanka Nadu Prabhu or lord of the Yelahanka-nad, as a feudatory of the Vijayanagar sovereigns. He ruled for 15 years (1418\u20131433) and was succeeded by his son Giide Gauda. Being without children, the latter is related to have made a vow to Kempamma, the consort of Baire Deva, that if by her favour he should be blessed with male issue, his descendants ever afterwards should bear her name. The goddess was propitious and he had a son, whom in accordance with his vow he named Kempa Nanja Gauda. After a rule of 10 years (1433\u20131443)\nGidde Gauda was succeeded by Kempe Nanja Gauda. This chief governed his territory with benevolence and justice for the long space of 70 years (1443-1513).\n\nKempe Gauda.\u2014Kempe Gauda, his son, the most distinguished of the line, succeeded, and acquired the favour of Krishna Raya and Achyuta Raya, the kings of Vijayanagar. Once, while making a tour through the Yelahanka-nad, he came to a village named Sivanasamudram, 10 miles south of Yelahanka, and 3 miles south of Bengaluru. The site appearing to him favourable for the erection of a fort, he obtained permission of Achyuta Raya to establish his capital there, and in 1537 built a mud fort and transferred to his new town the name of Bengaluru (Bangalore). As a reward for his zeal and activity, the following places were granted to him by Achyuta Raya, namely, Old Bengaluru, Vartur, Yelahanka, Bevur, Halasur, Tengeri, Talagattapar, Jigani, Kumbalgod, Kanalli, Banavar, and Hesarghatta. The revenue derived from the twelve hoblis amounted to 30,000 pagodas. This accession of wealth was partly devoted to the erection of temples, of which the principal are those of Venkataramana-swami in the fort of Bangalore, of Gavi Gangadharesvara at Gavipura, a mile to the south of the fort, and those of Basavesvara and others in the same neighbourhood. A large tank was formed near these edifices and named the Kempambudhi after the family goddess.\n\nNot content with feudal honours, the chief now usurped the prerogatives of royalty and established a mint (tankasale), whence issued the Baire Deva coins. At this period Achyuta Raya, his patron, died, and was succeeded on the Vijayanagar throne by Sadasiva Raya, under the guardianship of Rama Raja. Rumour of Kempe Gauda\u2019s proceedings having reached the court, he was summoned to account and cast into prison, his territory being sequestered and added to that of Jagadeva Raya. After remaining in confinement at Anegundi for five years, he obtained release by the payment of a heavy fine, and his possessions were restored to him. His residence at the metropolis apparently wrought some change in his views, for on his return he is said to have suppressed the custom of amputating the fingers of the marriageable females in his family, considering it incompatible with his dignity as Lord of the country. He appears also to have secretly adopted the worship of Siva in place of that of Baire Deva, the family\n\n---\n\n1 This was Hale (or old) Bengaluru, as it was afterwards called, the site of which is pointed out near Kodigehalli, north-west of Hebbal tank. The Bangalore District was for a long time called the Sivanasamudram country.\n\n2 The observance of this barbarous custom continued in some branches of the sect until 1874, when it was prohibited by Government.\ngod. His rule continued till 1569, being 43 years before and five years after his imprisonment.\n\nHis son, Immaqti (or the second) Kempe Gauda succeeded to the government. By him were erected the Somesvara pagoda at Halasur, and a number of tanks in various parts. He extended his territory westwards and obtained possession of Savandurga and Magadi, where he built a mud fort and the large temple, now in ruins, of Somesvara, two miles to the west.\n\nJagadeva Rayal.\u2014After the overthrow of the Vijayanagar empire by a Muhammadan confederacy on the field of Talikota in 1564, the dominions of that mighty Hindu sovereignty fell a prey to numerous invaders. The Bijapur and Ahmednagar princes having agreed on different lines of conquest to avoid mutual interference, the forces of the former made many acquisitions to the south. Emboldened by success, an attempt was made on Penugonda, which had for a time been the capital of the ousted kings of Vijayanagar, but whence Timma Raja had transferred the seat of government some years before to Chandragiri. The attack on Penugonda was gallantly repelled by Jagadeva Rayal,\u00b9 a relation of the Raja's, and his services were rewarded by bestowal of a large district which extended his possessions from Baramahal to the Western Ghats. He fixed his capital at Channapatna, which his descendants held till 1630, when it was captured after a long siege by Chama Raja of Mysore, together with Kankanhalli.\n\nIn 1638 Ran-dulha Khan, the general of the Adil Shahi prince of Bijapur, captured Bangalore from Kempe Gauda and made it his chief residence, the Gauda retiring to his stronghold on Savandurga.\n\nShahji.\u2014On Ran-dulha Khan\u2019s return to court, Shahji, father of the celebrated Sivaji, being second in command, was appointed to govern the districts subdued by the Bijapur forces in Karnataka and Dravida, named Carnatic Bijapur. With the view of attaching him to the fortunes of the government, he was afterwards granted as a j\u00e1gir Bangalore, Kolar, Hoskota, Dod-Ballapur and Sira. He fixed his residence at first at Bangalore, but afterwards, when not engaged in military expeditions, lived sometimes at Dod-Ballapur and sometimes at Kolar.\n\nThe story of his eventful life is not without romance and demands more than a passing notice. His father, Malloji Bhosla, was an officer, serving with a few men mounted on his own horses, in the Nizam Shahi army, in the time of Malik Amber, the celebrated Abyssinian minister of Ahmednagar. He was, it is said, for many years childless when, in\n\n\u00b9 The Jug Deo Raycel of Wilks.\n1594, by virtue of the prayers of Shah Sherif, a Muhammadan saint at Ahmednagar, his wife bore a son, whom in gratitude he named Shah-ji after the holy man. When five years old the boy accompanied his father to an entertainment at the house of his commanding officer, Lukji Jadu Rao, a Mahratta chief of high birth, who was at the head of 10,000 men. Jadu Rao, attracted by the appearance of Shahji, seated him beside his daughter Jeejee, a pretty child of three or four years old, and when they began to play together remarked jestingly that they were a fine pair. But the merriment which this occasioned was checked by Malloji\u2019s rising and calling upon his friends to witness that Jadu Rao had formed with him a marriage contract. The chief seemed astonished and was mute. Affecting to treat what had passed as a mere joke, he next day asked Malloji the father to a dinner. But the latter declined the invitation unless Jadu Rao would formally recognize Shahji as his son-in-law, which was indignantly refused.\n\nThe crafty father, however, never relinquished the design, and having acquired wealth and a high command, was eventually successful. The marriage of Shahji to Jeejee Bai was accordingly celebrated with great pomp in 1604, and honoured by the presence of the Sultan. The offspring of this union were Sambhaji and the illustrious Sivaji.\n\nIn 1620 Shahji, who had succeeded to his father\u2019s j\u00e1gir, distinguished himself in a battle against the Mughals. In 1629 he appears as a supporter of the cause of Khan Jehan Lodi, who had been driven into rebellion by the jealousy of the emperor Shah Jehan. Finding he had adopted a failing cause, and fearing the loss of his j\u00e1gir, Shahji made a tender of his services to the Mughal emperor, promising, on condition of receiving a safe-conduct and a letter of pardon, to repair to the imperial presence. The indulgence being granted, he came to court accompanied by his immediate dependents and a body of two thousand horse. Having paid his respects to Shah Jehan, he was promoted to the command of 5,000 horse, and not only confirmed in his patrimonial j\u00e1gir but received a grant for some other districts.\n\nIn 1632, dissatisfied with the proceedings of the imperial court, he made overtures to the Bijapur government with such inducements as led to their acceptance. In order to detach him from this alliance his wife and family, who in consequence of his second marriage had separated from him, were seized by the imperialists, but immediately released through the influence of Jeejee Bai\u2019s relations, who were adherents of the emperor. Shahji became thenceforward a leading partisan of the Bijapur state, and subdued the Ahmednagar territories, of which he made himself regent. But in 1636 Muhammad Adil Shah was compelled to sue for peace from the emperor. Pardon to\nShahji, on condition of giving up his forts, was one of the articles of the treaty concluded, and from this time his attention was confined to the Carnatic provinces.\n\nIn 1649, being suspected of secretly inciting the rebellion of his son Sivaji, he was treacherously seized at an entertainment. On being brought to court he denied all connection with his son's proceedings, but nothing could convince Muhammad Adil Shah of his innocence. Enraged at his supposed contumacy, the king ordered him to be confined in a stone dungeon, the door of which was built up, except a small opening, which he was told would be forever closed if within a certain period his son did not submit. Through the influence of the Mughal emperor Shah Jehan and others he was saved from a cruel death and released from his dungeon on giving security, but was kept a prisoner at large in Bijapur for four years.\n\nIn 1653 Shahji was permitted to return to his government. Soon after his restoration his eldest son Sambhaji, who during his absence had been at the head of affairs, was killed in an expedition. In 1662, with the approval of his sovereign, Shahji, accompanied by his other son Venkoji (or Ekoji), paid a visit to Sivaji and was successful in effecting a reconciliation between him and the Bijapur state.\n\nIn 1664 the active career of Shahji was brought to an end, at the age of 70, by a fall from his horse while hunting at Basavapatna, on the banks of the Tungabhadra, in the Shimoga District, where he had joined the Bijapur army to assist in reducing some refractory zamindars. At his death he possessed, besides the estates conferred upon him by Bijapur before mentioned, the fort of Arnee, Porto Novo, and the territory of Tanjore, acquisitions made by conquest.\n\nHis son Venkoji, or Ekoji, continued to govern the j\u00e1gir with the aid of Raghunath Narayan, who had been his father's principal adviser. The latter is described as a person of superior abilities. His relations with the son of his patron were never altogether amicable, though mutual interests prevented an open rupture. But in 1675 Raghunath Narayan left the Carnatic and in course of time entered the service of Sivaji, who received him with distinction. The intention of laying claim to a half share in his father's possessions as an hereditary right had been formed by Sivaji, and with the aid of this new counsellor he matured his plans for an expedition into the Carnatic and the enforcement of his claim. The expedition which set out in 1677, and the negotiations between\n\n---\n\n1 Venkajee in Duff, Vincaji in Elphinstone, Angojee or Ekojee in Scott, Ekojee in Wilks. The latter is no doubt a corruption of the former, in the same way as Venkuta is often at the present day transformed into Eukta. I have attempted to reconcile the spelling of the two forms.\nSivaji and Venkoji are matters of history. By 1678 all the disputed districts had been overrun, and Sivaji's horsemen levied chauth and sardeshmukhi in every direction, but an amicable arrangement having been come to, Venkoji regained possession the same year. Sivaji died in 1680.\n\n**Mysore Wodeyars.**\u2014Meanwhile the Wodeyars of Mysore, who had gained possession of Seringapatam, were rising to power. In 1654 Kempe Gauda of Magadi had been defeated at Yelahanka by Kanthirava Narasa Raja with great loss and forced to pay a contribution. In 1687 Bangalore also passed into the hands of the Mysore kings in the following manner:\u2014Sivaji was dead, and Venkoji, established on the throne of Tanjore, found his distant dominion of Bangalore to be an expensive and precarious possession, insulated in a great degree by the contending armies which constantly ranged over the intermediate country. He therefore determined to sell it to the highest bidder, and Chikka Deva Raja, who, taking advantage of the general anarchy, had been gradually extending his possessions, finally agreed to purchase it for three lakhs of rupees (\u00a330,000). He accordingly sent a detachment to occupy the new purchase and to pay the money. But the negotiation having been long protracted had become a matter of notoriety, and attracted the attention of Harji Raja, the Mahratta commander-in-chief at S'enji, and of Aurangzeb, who had just raised the siege of Golkonda. These powers, entertaining a high opinion of the importance of Bangalore, sent each a detachment from their distant and opposite stations to anticipate the Raja of Mysore. Khasim Khan, the general of Aurangzeb, by forced marches along the west of the Ghats, arrived first, and the place being in a dismantled state preparatory to its sale, fell into his hands almost without opposition. The detachment of Harji Raja, finding themselves forestalled, marched back as they came. The imperial colours, however, were hoisted for only four days on the ramparts of Bangalore. For Khasim Khan, who had more important objects in view, resolved to accept the terms still offered by the Mysore Raja, as he would thereby obtain a large sum of money and escape the necessity of leaving a detachment to occupy the place. At the same time its use as a point of communication would still be preserved. Thus, in July 1687, this important town became a part of the Mysore kingdom.\n\nAt Dod-Ballapura is an interesting inscription of the thirty-second year of Aurangzeb (1689), recording its capture by Khasim Khan and its bestowal upon a descendant of one of the courtiers at Delhi.\n\nIn 1728 Deva Raja, Dalavayi of Dodda Krishna Raja, made an attack upon Magadi with a view of replenishing the treasury, which had\nbeen heavily drained by the contributions levied by the Muhammadans and the Mahrattas. Kempe Gauda imprudently allowed himself to be surrounded in the weak fort of Magadi and was forced to surrender at discretion. He was carried to Seringapatam as a state prisoner, and there ended his days, the last of his line. The impregnable fortress of Savandurga, with the accumulated plunder of nearly two hundred years, thus fell into the hands of the Mysore army.\n\nIn 1749 the siege of Devanhalli was undertaken, in which Haidar Ali first distinguished himself as a volunteer horseman, and here his son and successor Tipu was afterwards born. In 1758 the fort and district of Bangalore were conferred on Haidar as a jagir in recognition of his distinguished services. In 1759 the Mahrattas under Gopal Hari invested Bangalore and surprised Channapatna, but both places were relieved by his address. In 1761 he obtained from Basalat Jang the cession of Hoskote and of Dod-Ballapur, the jagir of Abbas Kuli Khan. From this year dates his usurpation of the Mysore throne, from which period therefore the District was under the Muhammadan rule of himself and of his son and successor, Tipu Sultan.\n\nIn 1791 Bangalore was captured from Tipu by the British under Lord Cornwallis, to whom also Devanhalli and other places submitted. Savandurga, Raingiri, Sivangiri and other hill forts were taken. On the death of Tipu in 1799 the District was included by the treaty of Seringapatam in the territory of the Mysore Raja. Under the native government which followed, the Bangalore and Kolar Districts constituted the Bangalore Faujdari, which was afterwards called the Bangalore Division, until the formation of the Nundydroog Division in 1863, when the name Bangalore was confined to the District. The most important topical changes that occurred in the District during this period were the foundation of Closepet in 1800, and the establishment of the British Cantonment at Bangalore in 1809, the latter of which events has added so greatly to the wealth and prosperity of the surrounding country.\n\nOn the Rendition in 1881, the site of the Bangalore Cantonment was made over as an Assigned Tract to the British Government, who at the same time surrendered to Mysore the island of Seringapatam. In 1882 were established the Eurasian and Anglo-Indian colonies of Whitefield and Sausmond, in the east of the Bangalore taluq. The Closepet Sub-Division, comprising the taluqs of Channapatna, Magadi and Kankanalli, was formed in 1884.\n\nIn 1888 the fort of Bangalore was given up to the Mysore civil authorities, being no longer required for military purposes, the Residency and grounds being added to the Assigned Tract in exchange.\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014The entire population of the District is 802,994, according to the census of 1891, the number of males being 399,486, and of females 403,508.\n\n*Density.*\u2014This gives 262\u00b733 persons to a square mile, a higher rate than in any other District of the Province. But the result is largely affected by the presence of the Town and Cantonment of Bangalore, the united population of which is 180,366. Excluding these from the calculation, the density of population in the District is 204\u00b717 persons per square mile. Individual taluqs show a much higher rate. The most thickly peopled at the time of the census was Anekal, where there were 288\u00b76 persons to a square mile. In Bangalore (taluq only) the rate was 269, in Dod-Ballapur 231, in Nelamangala 229\u00b75, in Hoskote 223\u00b79, in Channapatna 219\u00b72.\n\n*By Religion.*\u2014The numbers professing each of the principal forms of faith are as follows:\n\n| Religions | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|-----------|----------|----------|-------|\n|           | Male     | Female   | Male  | Female | Total | Percentage |\n| Hindus    | 224,716  | 229,913  | 126,251 | 127,257 | 708,137 | 88\u00b72 |\n| Muhammadans | 21,654  | 20,557   | 13,737  | 13,279  | 60,227  | 8\u00b75 |\n| Jains     | 576      | 477      | 272     | 253     | 1,578   | 2 |\n| Christians | 7,660    | 7,222    | 4,596   | 4,531   | 24,099  | 3\u00b70 |\n| Others    | 18       | 11       | 6       | 8       | 43      | \u2014 |\n| **Total** | **254,624** | **258,180** | **144,862** | **145,328** | **802,994** | |\n\n*Increase.*\u2014The following table compares the statistics according to the kh\u0101neshum\u0101ri accounts of 1853-4 with those obtained in the censuses of 1871, 1881 and 1891:\n\n| Taluq     | 1853-4 | 1871 | 1881 | 1891 |\n|-----------|--------|------|------|------|\n| Anekal    | 23,596 | 55,828 | 44,423 | 54,834 |\n| Bangalore | 267,717 | 231,666 | 233,571 | 269,083 |\n| Channapatna | 66,535 | 109,304 | 87,484 | 99,294 |\n| Devanhalli | 45,117 | 57,815 | 44,079 | 53,582 |\n| Dod-Ballapur | 46,732 | 77,375 | 52,021 | 65,613 |\n| Hoskote   | 38,194 | 65,694 | 51,903 | 60,667 |\n| Kankanhalli | 47,136 | 84,551 | 65,323 | 71,868 |\n| Magadi    | 51,011 | 86,156 | 50,295 | 64,334 |\n| Nelamangala | 32,468 | 73,844 | 50,565 | 63,119 |\n| **Total** | **618,506** | **842,233** | **679,664** | **802,994** |\nSome of the variations are due to redistribution of taluqs, and to changes in the limits of the District. There was an apparent increase on the whole up to 1871 equivalent to 33.9 per cent. in 18 years. But 25 per cent., as we have seen (Vol. I.), was due to defective enumeration in the early record. The loss inflicted by the famine of 1877-8 sent down the total 19.3 per cent. by 1881, but it had risen again 18.14 per cent. by 1891.

The births registered numbered 14,314, being 7,419 males, and 6,895 females. The total number of deaths registered was 8,848. Excluding the Civil and Military Station, 3,802 were deaths of males and 3,511 of females; of which 6,389 occurred among Hindus, 554 among Muhammadans, and 370 among other classes. The causes of death\nregistered (inclusive of Civil and Military Station) were: from diseases\u2014cholera 112, small-pox 131, fevers 4,345, bowel complaints, 399; from injuries\u2014suicide 23, wounds or accidents, 123, snake-bite or wild beasts, 15; all other causes 3,640.\n\n**Diseases:**\u2014*Endemics.*\u2014The chief endemic disease is malarious fever, which prevails extensively in some of the taluqs, *viz.*, Closepet, Magadi, and Kankanhalli, and is very frequently attended with enlargement of the spleen. It likewise prevails in all the other taluqs, but not so severely. It is not generally fatal when properly treated. I am not aware that any improvement is taking place in this disease. In some years it occurs severely in certain taluqs, and during others there is a comparative freedom from it. It is difficult to assign any special cause for the origin of the malaria which gives rise to this fever, but, generally speaking, it may be stated that when the rains and seasons are favourable fever is less prevalent. It is most frequent at the commencement and close of the monsoons. Even Bangalore is not exempt from malarious fever, but the type is less marked, and cases met with easily treated. With the exception of malarious fever I am not aware that any other class of disease is endemic in this District.\n\nIn Bangalore, of late years, many cases of typhoid fever have occurred among Europeans, but I have never seen a well-marked case in a native. Measles and whooping-cough are also frequently met with, and occasionally diphtheria. Pneumonia in natives, and congestion of the liver in Europeans, are exceedingly common. Syphilis may perhaps be said to be almost endemic both in Bangalore and in the District generally. It prevails extensively, and when neglected, as it often is, assumes a very virulent form.\n\n**Epidemics.**\u2014Cholera becomes epidemic occasionally. When it occurs it generally commences in February or March, and prevails more or less until the commencement of the cold season. In the epidemics that have hitherto occurred, the first cases are generally supposed to have been imported from infected districts in the Madras Presidency.\n\nSmall pox is always more or less prevalent in the District during the hot season and commencement of the rains. I do not think the disease is worse or more fatal in this District than in other countries. During some years the disease is comparatively dormant. Vaccination is carried on in every taluq by a staff of vaccinators, but the system is capable of improvement.\"\n\nThe annual deaths from cholera and small-pox since 1881 were as follows:\n\n---\n\n1 Contributed by Dr. Oswald when Surgeon to the Mysore Commission.\nAs cholera is constantly imported by pilgrims returning from Tirupati and other places, quarantine camps and chattrams have been provided at important railway stations for the purpose of affording travellers and pilgrims accommodation close by and passing them on to their destinations with as little delay as possible, thereby preventing their wandering into towns in search of food and shelter. But Surgeon-Colonel McGann, the head of the Medical Department, impresses upon Government \"the importance of improving village sanitation. Every advance in that direction, in the way of improving and conserving the water-supply, and promoting general cleanliness, by preventing the storage of manure in the streets and back-yards of houses, and preventing, as far as possible, the defilement of the ground in and immediately around towns and villages would be a distinct gain, would improve the general health of the people, diminish their liability to fevers, bowel complaints and cholera, and tend to check the spread of the last-named disease on its occurrence amongst them.\" In order to reduce the mortality from small-pox, he strongly urges the introduction of a Compulsory Vaccination Act as the only effectual course.\n\nA severe epidemic of dengue occurred in Bangalore in the latter part of 1872. It was confined chiefly to the native population, and seems to have been imported, as it was prevailing in many parts of India. Influenza was epidemic in 1890.\n\nMedical Relief.\u2014Dispensaries, with trained Hospital Assistants in charge, have been established at all taluq stations; and qualified native midwives are supplied to every taluq.\n\nTRADE\n\nManufactures.\u2014An account has already been given (in Vol. I) of the steam cotton, woollen and silk-mills established at Bangalore, also of the steam oil-mills, soap and candle factories, iron foundry, etc. The most general manufactures, carried on all over the District, are those of cotton cloths and coarse woollen blankets or kamblis.

The art has been carried to great perfection in the Central Jail, the carpets made in which, of Persian and Turkish designs, are in great demand even for England, at from Rs. 12 a square yard.\n\n**Silk Fabrics.**\u2014Silks of stout durable texture and costly patterns are largely made by patvegars in Bangalore and sold by weight at from Rs. 4 and 5 a tola.\n\nRaw silk.\u2014The production of ra silk, an industry confined to the Muhammadans, declined for many years owing to continued mortality of the worms. The attempt to establish a Silk Filature Company at Kengeri in 1866 was on that account a failure. The industry has now revived, as either through importation or climatic changes, a healthy breed of insects has been established.\n\n**Metal Manufacture.**\u2014In Magadi taluq, much iron is made and some steel. Steel wire of a superior quality for strings of musical instruments is made at Channapatna.\n\nGold and Silver lace is also made at Bangalore. Lacquered ware and toys are well-known manufactures of Channapatna.\n\n**Oils.**\u2014The extraction of oils forms an important branch of industry. These consist of castor-oil of two kinds, the inferior description\n\n\u00b9 See also Vol. I, p. 537.\nobtained from the large seed being called lamp oil; ground-nut oil, caron oil, and gingelli oil, of good and inferior kinds. They are more fully described, with their uses, under Oil-pressing.\n\nThe manufacture may also be mentioned of coir ropes and matting; of goni bags or sacks; and of bamboo matting and baskets.\n\n**Arts.**\u2014The arts of printing, bookbinding, lithography and photography are pursued in Bangalore, with electro-plating, boot and shoemaking, smiths' work of all kinds, and carpentering in all its branches, including coach-building and furniture-making. The variety of handicrafts is too numerous to specify, and is probably on the increase owing to the demand of a growing population.\n\n**Marts.**\u2014The chief marts of trade, in addition to that of Bangalore, are at Channapatna, Dod-Ballapur, Sarjapur, Vadagenhalli, Tyamagondal, and Hindiginal.\n\n---\n\n**REVENUE**\n\nThe revenue of the District for five years is exhibited in detail in the following table:\n\n| Items          | 1890-1 | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Land revenue   | 10,55,594 | 10,88,501 | 11,35,915 | 12,00,221 | 11,94,261 |\n| Forests        | 1,28,689 | 1,33,399 | 1,22,432 | 1,45,729 | 1,36,266 |\n| Mohatarla      | 41,420 | 41,183 | 42,055 | 41,461 | 27,697 |\n| Akkari         | 1,43,556 | 3,25,352 | 7,47,755 | 7,36,131 | 7,87,220 |\n| Sayar          | 5,490 | 6,546 | 4,883 | 98 | 159 |\n| Salt           | 18 | 12 | 12 | 12 | 15 |\n| Public Works   | 1,635 | 1,491 | 2,529 | 1,166 | \u2014 |\n| Stamps         | 1,44,331 | 1,83,510 | 1,56,525 | 1,67,269 | 1,61,247 |\n| Law and Justice| 22,976 | 34,819 | 9,282 | 6,777 | 10,239 |\n| Registration   | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 21,502 | 21,529 |\n| Jails          | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,481 | 1,524 |\n| Education      | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 13,475 | 15,592 |\n| Police         | 62 | 37 | 49 | 22 | 121 |\n| Other items    | 33,395 | 38,502 | 60,825 | 13,050 | 11,172 |\n\nTotal Rs. | 15,77,175 | 18,53,352 | 22,82,262 | 23,48,394 | 23,67,042 |\n\nThe items which are blank in the first three years are included in some of the other heads.\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nRailways.\u2014The railways radiating from the Bangalore City station are\u2014the Branch Railway to Madras, broad gauge, running east to Jalarpet, of which about twenty-three miles are in this District, with stations at Bangalore Cantonment, Krishnarajapuram, Whitefield and Devankundi; the Mysore State Railway, metre gauge, running southwest to Mysore and Nanjangud, of which about forty-two miles are in this District, with stations at Kengeri, Bidadi, Closepet, Channapatna and Mudgere; the Southern Maharatta Railway, metre gauge, running north to Guntakal, and from Yevantpur junction north-west to Harihar and Poona.

Brahman kitchens have been built in the compounds for vegetarian Hindu officials.\n\n*First Class*: Closepet. *Second Class*: Bidadi, Channapatna, Devanhalli, Dod-Ballapur, Hebbagod, Sompur, Solur, Yelahanka. *Third Class*: Anekal, Kankanhalli, Kumbalgod, Magadi.\n\nMus\u00e1firkh\u00e1nas for the accommodation of native travellers are maintained by Government at Anekal, Dod-Ballapur, Golhalli, Harohalli, Hindiginal, Kadgodi, Kankanhalli, Nelamangala.\n\n---\n\n**GAZETTEER**\n\n**Agara.**\u2014A village in Bangalore taluq, about five miles south-east of Bangalore, head-quarters of the same name. Population 746. Contains large tanks, which inscriptions show were in existence in the 8th century. The Artillery practice ground is on the Agram plain.\n\n**Alsur (Ulsoor),\u2014see Halas\u00far.**\n\n**Anekal.**\u2014A taluq in the south-east. Area 190 square miles. Head-quarters at Anekal. Contains the following h\u00f3blis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with Population.\u2014Anekal, 7,719; Sarjapur, 3,017; Dommasandra, 2,284; Attibele, 1,613; Jigani, 1,418.\n\nThe taluq was increased by the addition of the Sarjapur and Bidarguppe hoblis, on the breaking up of the Sarjapur taluq, in 1873.\n\nThe S. Pinakini runs along the eastern side and receives nearly the whole drainage. The western side is jungly and marked by a continuous range of hills, through which several rivulets, uniting under the name of the Suvarnamukhi, descend to the Arkavati at the lower level of Kankanhalli. The taluq consists of two principal valleys, which collect all the smaller streams running eastward: the southernmost extends from Anekal to Attibele; through the northern flows the Sanatkumara, which joins the S. Pinakini near Hosur, in the Salem District, five miles beyond the Mysore boundary.\n\nExcept in the western parts the soil is fertile and well cultivated, but a somewhat better rainfall in those parts, owing to the proximity of hills, allows of the growth of rice without artificial irrigation. The principal dry crops are the ordinary ragi, gram, &c. The wet crops consist chiefly of paddy and sugar-cane. In favourable seasons two crops of rice are grown under large tanks. The sugar-cane is of a superior kind. There are many gardens of the betel vine, with some areca and cocoanut plantations. Minor garden produce is raised by Tigalas in the south-east. Mulberry cultivation is also met with here and there. The Sanatkumara supplies several small channels and tanks. Its waters are further utilised by means of pikota wells.\n\nIron ore is collected and smelted in the western parts of the taluq. Common cotton cloths are made at Anekal, Dommasandra and other places. Raw silk is produced at Anekal and Sarjapur. At this latter place muslins of various patterns, turbans, and small cotton carpets are made.\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1891. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 49,934; wet, 7,699; garden, 2,212) ... 59,845\n- Unculturable (including village sites, &c.) ... ... 42,506\n- Inam (with Commissariat kavul 450) ... ... 19,400\n\nTotal area, acres ... 121,751\n\nOf the culturable area 7,434 acres were waste.\n\nThe total revenue under all heads for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,46,612; and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,44,823. The land revenue from Government lands in those years was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891-92 | 1892-93 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|\n|             | Area    | Assessment | Area    | Assessment |\n| Dry         | 40,897  | 65,764   | 41,596  | 66,936   |\n| Wet         | 5,885   | 31,321   | 5,972   | 31,822   |\n| Garden      | 2,028   | 9,855    | 2,043   | 9,950    |\n| Total       | Ac. 48,810 | Rs. 1,06,940 | Ac. 49,611 | Rs. 1,08,708 |\n\nThe average rainfall at Anekal for twenty-five years (1870-94), and at the other places for two years (1893-94), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Anekal... | 0\u00b012 | 0\u00b017 | 0\u00b048 | 1\u00b000 | 4\u00b045 | 2\u00b036 | 3\u00b070 | 5\u00b061 | 5\u00b053 | 6\u00b018 | 2\u00b065 | 0\u00b078 | ... 33\u00b093 |\n| Attibele... | \u2014 | 0\u00b080 | 0\u00b013 | 1\u00b059 | 4\u00b002 | 5\u00b010 | 2\u00b068 | 3\u00b021 | 3\u00b033 | 7\u00b061 | 1\u00b095 | \u2014 | ... 30\u00b042 |\n| Hebgod... | \u2014 | 0\u00b089 | 0\u00b030 | 1\u00b081 | 5\u00b053 | 6\u00b058 | 3\u00b092 | 4\u00b004 | 3\u00b016 | 6\u00b029 | 1\u00b093 | \u2014 | ... 34\u00b095 |\n\nThe trunk road from Bangalore to Salem runs through the taluq, from north-west to south-east, with a branch road to Anekal from near Hebbagod. From Attibele in the same main road there are branches south to Mattikere, south-west to Anekal and north to Sarjapur. From this place there is a road to Whitefield Railway station, with a branch to Bangalore through Agara. There is also a road from Bangalore to Anekal by way of Bannerghatta. Local roads run from Anekal to Mattikere, and from Anekal towards Denkanikota. One from Anekal to Kankanhalli has also been traced.\n\n**Anekal.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 42' N. lat., 77\u00b0 43' E. long., 22 miles south-east of Bangalore. Head-quarters of the Anekal taluq, and a municipality. The direct road from Bangalore is by Bannerghatta, but there is also a cross road from the Hosur road beyond Hebbagod.\nThe suburbs are Bendarhalli, population 100, and Bahadurpur, 200. A fair is held every Friday, attended by 400 persons.\n\nThe origin of the name\u2014\u00e1ne-kal, hailstone\u2014is not known. The town was founded about 1603 by Chikka Timme Gauda, a descendant of the original Sugatur chief. The general of the Bijapur State, after seizing Timme Gauda's hereditary possession of Hoskote, granted him Anekal, which formed a h\u00f3bl\u00ed of that pargana. He thereupon erected the fort and temple, constructed the large tank to the west, and set on foot such improvements as tended to the opulence and prosperity of the town. After a reign of thirty years he died, and was succeeded by his son Timme Gauda. The latter reigned twenty years, and left the territory to his son Dodda Timme Gauda, in whose time Anekal was conquered by the Mysore R\u00e1ja. The chief, however, remained in possession, paying an annual tribute of 2,000 rupees, and died shortly after, having completed a long reign of 60 years. His son Vira Nanjana Timme Gauda then ruled for 24 years, and was in turn succeeded by his son Jama Gauda. This chief, in common with many others, was expelled by Haidar and his possessions were annexed to Mysore.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 | 1895-96 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 2,478) | Rs. 2,336 | Rs. 2,001 | Rs. 4,065 | Rs. 4,300 |\n| Expenditure | 4,687 | 3,659 | 3,770 | 4,420 |\n\nArades'ahalli.\u2014A J\u00f3di village in Devanhalli taluq, four miles south-west of Kund\u00e1na. Population 390. Contains some old stone inscriptions, one of Ak\u00e1lavarsha, and two relating to the Punn\u00e1d kings (see Vol. I, p. 312).\n\nArkavati.\u2014A tributary of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, flowing through the District from north to south and receiving the drainage of all the country between the central watershed and the western chain of hills. Its reputed source is a well on Nandidroog, on the south-west. Thence entering the Dod-Ballapur taluq it forms several large tanks, as at Dod-Ballapur, Kakolu and Hesarghatta; and passing through\nthe east of the Nelamangala taluq, receives in the south the Kumadvati from the west. It then flows through the Magadi taluq, passing east of Savandurga. Penetrating between Ramgiri and Sivangiri near Closepet, it runs through the Channapatna taluq in a south-easterly direction past Closepet and K\u00fanagal, which are on the left bank, into Kankanhalli taluq. Near Muduvadi-durga it is joined on the north by the Vrishabh\u00e1vati and then runs due south, leaving Kankanhalli on the right bank, and discharges into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri on the southern frontier. The length of the main stream is about 120 miles.\n\nThe greater part of its course from Magadi onwards is through a wild country amid rocky hills, precipices and thick jungle. Its waters are therefore little utilized in those parts for purposes of cultivation. Though never entirely dry, it presents in the hot season the usual aspect of a sandy bed with a little current of water flowing at one side. Holes scooped in the sand furnish a ready means of water supply to the dwellers on the banks. In the rains, when the freshes come down, it is a formidable stream, swollen by mountain torrents and bearing along in its irresistible force logs of timber and uprooted trees torn from the forests on its banks. It is bridged in three places for roads from Bangalore, namely, 5 miles east of Nelamangala, 10 miles east of Magadi, and at Closepet. The calculations for the second of these gave a maximum flood discharge of 50,000 cubic feet per second, with an ordinary monsoon discharge of 3,500.\n\nAvati.\u2014Properly Ahuti, a village in the Devanhalli taluq, 4 miles north of the kasba, on the road to Chik-Ballapur. Head-quarters of the Avati hobli. Population 975.\n\nIt is historically interesting as being the original settlement of the seven enterprising farmers from Kanchi, whose story holds so prominent a place in the annals of the Bangalore, Kolar and Tumkur Districts. The three sons of Baire Gauda, the leader, it will there be seen, established themselves as chiefs of Devanhalli, Dod-Ballapur and Chik-Ballapur respectively. Timme Gauda became lord of Sugatur Nad, obtained the title of Chikka R\u00e1yal, restored Kolar and founded Hoskote; while his descendants became the chiefs of Punganur and Anekal. Sanna Baire Gauda settled at Holavanhalli and founded Koratigere. Jaya Gauda became lord of Yelahanka Nad and founder of Bangalore, his descendants being the chiefs of Magadi.\n\nBairan-durga.\u2014A hill in the north-west of the Magadi taluq near Kud\u00far. It was fortified by the Mahrattas about 1609 and, with Hulikal, formed into a separate pargana. It was purchased twenty years afterwards by the Mysore R\u00e1ja, who appointed Timma Nayak as governor. He improved and strengthened the fortifications, which\nconsisted of three lines of defence and some outworks on the north and east faces, built the temple of Bairava at the summit, and changed the name of the hill from Abdul Bandar to Bairan-durga. The works were demolished and the town removed to Kudur by order of Tipu Sultan in 1792, on account of its unhealthiness and a deficiency of water.\n\nBangalore.\u2014A taluq near the centre.

By these accessions its limits were restored to nearly what they were in 1799.\n\nThe greater part of the taluq drains to the east, the waters being collected into two streams, which, forming continuous chains of tanks, fall into the S. Pin\u00e1kini. The northern of these commences beyond Yelahanka and, uniting near Hebbal with a stream from the north, flows into the S. Pin\u00e1kini at Kadgodi. The southern runs from Vasantapur, past Vartur, into the same near the Patandur hill. In the western part of the taluq a stream from Oyali Dinne feeds the Vrishabhavati, which, rising near Gavipura, flows past Kengeri and Bidadi to the Arkavati in Kankanhalli.\n\n\u00b9 The name has now been changed to Kasba Bangalore hobli.\nThe south-west is rocky and hilly; the remainder being composed of open, well-cultivated country, undulating much towards the north-west. Some of the principal elevations are those at Dod-Bettahalli (3,158 feet), in the north; at Banavar (3,108 feet), in the north-west; at Kotnur (3,118 feet) in the south; at Banasvadi (3,029 feet) in the east. From the Oyali Dinne (3,118 feet), north of Bangalore, was measured the base line of the Great Trigonometrical Survey, for 7 miles north-east, to near Gubbi. There are numerous quarries around Bangalore of gneissose stone, which is not only largely employed for every variety of building in the town, but transported to distant places.\n\nThe prevailing soil is the red, on which are cultivated ragi and the commonly associated dry crops. Paddy and sugar-cane are grown on the lands under tanks. In the immediate neighbourhood of Bangalore, especially on the south, numerous kinds of fruits and vegetables are raised for the European market, such as apples, peaches, grapes, mangoes, strawberries, &c.; cauliflowers, peas, knol-kohl, cabbage, lettuce, &c. Coffee cultivation to the south-east of Bangalore has proved of late years very successful, and plantations are being opened in other parts.\n\nThe weaving of cotton cloths is the most extensive native manufacture. These are of the ordinary as well of superior kinds. Coarse woollen blankets and goni for bags are also made. But the most important local arts are those of silk-weaving and carpet-making in the City of Bangalore, regarding which and other arts pursued in Bangalore more particular mention will be found elsewhere.\n\nThe taluq is intersected in all directions by roads radiating from Bangalore, and, except on the south-east, by railways.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into the Bangalore, Agara, Halsur and Yesvantpur hoblis in 1872; Yelahanka, Krishnarajpur and Kengeri, in 1875; Begur and Vartur in 1877.\n\nThe total revenue under all heads for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 2,13,287, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,13,116. The land revenue from Government lands in those years was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891-2 | 1892-3 |\n|------------|--------|--------|\n|            | Area   | Assessment | Area   | Assessment |\n| Dry        | 71,114 | 84,853    | 71,854 | 85,594    |\n| Wet        | 7,078  | 31,346    | 7,269  | 32,420    |\n| Garden     | 3,840  | 25,979    | 3,772  | 25,640    |\n| Total      | Ac. 82,032 | Rs. 1,42,178 | Ac. 82,895 | Rs. 1,43,654 |\nThe following was the average rainfall for 25 years (1870-94) at Bangalore, and for 2 years (1893-4) at the other stations:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Bangalore | ... | 0\u00b007 | 0\u00b027 | 0\u00b083 | 1\u00b014 | 4\u00b067 | 3\u00b039 | 4\u00b051 | 6\u00b049 | 6\u00b000 | 7\u00b040 | 2\u00b071 | 0\u00b042 | ... | 37\u00b090 |\n| Hebb\u00e1l (Butts) | \u2014 | 0\u00b030 | 1\u00b000 | 1\u00b055 | 5\u00b073 | 4\u00b043 | 4\u00b013 | 4\u00b058 | 5\u00b020 | 5\u00b071 | 2\u00b075 | \u2014 | ... | 35\u00b038 |\n| Krishnar\u00e1jpur | \u2014 | 1\u00b036 | 0\u00b039 | 1\u00b099 | 3\u00b036 | 2\u00b089 | 2\u00b003 | 3\u00b080 | 5\u00b034 | 5\u00b041 | 1\u00b096 | \u2014 | ... | 28\u00b053 |\n| Vartur | ... | \u2014 | 1\u00b040 | \u2014 | 1\u00b062 | 4\u00b020 | 3\u00b079 | 3\u00b041 | 4\u00b016 | 4\u00b090 | 7\u00b054 | 4\u00b015 | \u2014 | ... | 35\u00b017 |\n| Yelahanka | ... | \u2014 | 0\u00b009 | 2\u00b042 | 1\u00b034 | 3\u00b061 | 5\u00b004 | 4\u00b024 | 3\u00b067 | 3\u00b006 | 3\u00b028 | 1\u00b022 | \u2014 | ... | 27\u00b097 |\n\n**Bangalore.**\u2014Chief town, situated 12\u00b0 57' N. lat. and 77\u00b0 35' E. long. The seat of government for the Province of Mysore, and head-quarters of the former Mysore Division and present Bangalore District of the Madras Army. Population 180,366. It covers an area of 20 square miles, and consists of two separate parts, namely, the City (the P\u00e9te or old native Town of Bangalore Proper), and the Civil and Military Station (formerly called the Cantonment).\n\nIts name Bengal\u00faru, of which Bangalore is a corruption, is said to be derived from bengalu, a kind of beans, to account for which the following story is related:\u2014One day, when king Vira Ball\u00e1la was hunting, he became separated from his attendants, and losing his way, wandered about till nightfall. At last, faint and weary, he came upon a solitary hut, in which was an old woman, to whom he applied for something to eat. She had nothing better to offer him than some bengalu, green beans boiled in a little water, which however he was glad enough to get, and sharing them with his horse passed the night under shelter of the lowly hut. The incident speedily became known, and the village (\u00faru) which sprung up thence took the name of Bengal\u00faru. This was situated to the north of Kodigehalli, and after Kempe Gauda had given the name to his new capital was called old or Hale Bengal\u00faru. At each of the cardinal points is an old watch-tower,\u00b9 which marks, it is said, the limits to which it was predicted the town would extend. The prophecy has now been more than fulfilled.\n\n**City.**\u2014Bangalore City includes the Fort on the south, and extends to the Maharaja's Palace on the north. Two large extensions have been added to it in recent years\u2014the northern, from the Race-course northwards, and the western, from the Fort westwards. It includes 19 suburbs, and occupies an area of 8\u00bc square miles.\n\n\u00b9 The one to the north is on the Oy\u00e1lidinne, overlooking the Rifle Butts; the one to the east is on the rock of the Halsur waterworks; the one to the south is above the quarry on the east of the Lal Bagh; and the one on the west is near Gavipur, at the northern end of the Kemp\u00e1mbudhi tank bund. This one has lost its dome.\nIn 1894 there were 10,800 houses, of which 537 were terraced, 437 tiled, 8,992 mud-roofed, and 834 thatched. The estimated annual rental value was Rs. 4.59 lakhs.\n\nThe town itself was originally surrounded by a deep ditch and a thickset thorny hedge, which had served as a defence against the Mahratta cavalry. It was stormed by the British in 1791, and a cenotaph is erected near the Halsur gate to Colonel Moorhouse and other officers who lost their lives in the attack. The hedge was cleared away about 30 years ago, and the ditch has been filled up and built upon. The orthodox number of gates (b\u0101g\u012blu) was eight, to correspond with the eight cardinal points, but after improvements have added several new ones. The principal are the Yelahanka gate on the north, the Halasur gate on the east, the Fort and Mysore gates on the south, the Agrahara and Sondekoppa gates on the west, and the Bale gate on the north-west.\n\nThe town is divided into numerous p\u0113te or quarters. But the Dodda-p\u0113te (High-street) running from the Yelahanka gate in the north to the Fort gate in the south, separates the two comprehensive divisions of D\u0113shada p\u0113te on the west from Nagarta p\u0113te on the east. This line is crossed at right angles by a street running from the Halasur gate on the east to the Sondekoppa gate on the west. The intersection of these two main roads is styled the chauk, or square, near to which is situated the Taluq Cutcherry.\n\nBetween the Fort and Mysore gates is an excellent public market. Siddi Katte, the quarter in which many Brahman officials live, occupies, it is said, the site of an old tank, built at the expense of Siddi, a lady of the Kempe Gauda family. The City Railway-station is on the west of the Dharm\u0101mbudhi tank, and its advent has caused a great transformation on that side of the town. The houses forming the quarters of the railway staff are chiefly to the west of the station, where there are also a church and a chapel.\n\nOwing to the circumstances of its origin, the rapid growth of the town, and the various hands through which it has passed, the streets in the old parts are often narrow and mostly irregular in appearance. The latter defect has been to some extent remedied by the construction of\nstone drains along both sides of the principal streets, which has also promoted the cleanliness of the town. Many streets, too, have been widened as far as possible. Substantially built and imposing edifices may be seen in Chikka-p\u00e9te and other parts, belonging to wealthy natives, but their effect is a good deal lost from their scattered positions. Bangalore, however, presents a lively specimen of a Hindu town, the main streets being generally crowded with pedestrians, among whom vehicles of all kinds, from the carriage or brougham of the high official to the rude jatka of the merchant trader and the slow and heavily-laden bullock-cart, thread their difficult way by dint of continual vociferous shouts.\n\nThe open stalls or bazaars on either side of the Dodd\u00e1-p\u00e9te and other thoroughfares display their wares arranged on tiers of shelves, all within reach of the owner, who sits comfortably ensconced among them. Customers stand in the street to make their bargains, or squat on a small ledge in front of the shop for a preliminary chat with the proprietor. Those of a trade generally flock together, so that many shops containing the same description of goods will be found side by side. In the Grain market (Taragu-p\u00e9te) a perfect block of carts stops the way, their contents being discharged in heaps into the street, where they are measured before being stored. In the Cotton market (Arale-p\u00e9te) the verandahs of the warehouses are piled with bulging bales. Arrangements have been made to remove these markets to the western extension, a railway siding being constructed for their convenience.\n\nIn the quieter and more private parts of the town the floor and ground at the entrance to the houses will be seen carefully washed with purifying cowdung, and pleasingly decorated with numerous geometrical figures, which are drawn afresh by the women with lines of white chalk every morning, while the lintel of the door is decked with mango leaves strung on a thread as a sign of welcome. On all sides may be seen women, with water jars and shining brass vessels, grouped round the public wells and fountains, or on their way to a tank with baskets of clothes. The peculiar odours of eastern bazaars pervade the streets; mendicants go from house to house sounding their conchs or gongs; and the universal babel gives evidence of the out-door life of the people.\n\nThe water supply of the native town was hitherto derived principally from the Dharm\u00e1mbudhi tank on the north-west. From this reservoir water was laid on to the streets and drawn out by the people as required from the square troughs or basins constructed at convenient points. The residents of the north-east quarter resorted to the Sampangi tank, the bed of which is now a polo ground. The well-water in the town is mostly brackish. But at a cost of $19\\frac{1}{3}$ lakhs a pure and abundant\nwater supply has now been provided, drawn from the Hesarghatta tank, 13 miles to the north-west. The water is pumped up to the top of a hill at Banavar, and from there runs by gravitation through cast-iron pipes to the settling and filter-beds above Sankey's reservoir to the west, and thence to a subterranean reservoir at the Race-course, whence it is distributed in iron mains to all parts of the City, and drawn off at stand-pipes or hydrants at suitable points in the streets.\n\nThe drainage of the P\u00e9te is collected into one main channel, which runs out from the southern side and is continued as far as the Sunnakal tank, a distance of two or three miles, where the sewerage is applied to agricultural purposes.\n\nThe Fort is no longer used for any military purpose, and is now a part of the City. The original Fort was of mud, and is said to have been erected in 1537 by Kempe Gauda, Prabhu of Yelahanka and ancestor of the Magadi chiefs. Under its Hindu masters, namely, the Magadi gaudas, the Mahratta governors subordinate to the Adil Shahi princes of Bijapur, and lastly the Mysore Wodeyars, the Fort retained its old character, with no doubt some additions to its strength. But under the Muhammadans the fortress was enlarged and rebuilt of stone. This work is attributed to a Khiledar named Ibrahim Sahib, and was carried out in 1761, the first year of Haidar Ali's reign. The form of the Fort is oval, with round towers at proper intervals. It had, when captured by the British in 1791, five powerful cavaliers, a fausse-bray, a good ditch and covered way without palisades, but the glacis was imperfect in some parts. The two gateways, one in the north and the other in the south, were called the Delhi and Mysore gates respectively. The former, which opened towards the P\u00e9te, was a handsome structure in the best style of Muhammadan military architecture, and consisted of several gates surmounted by traverses.\u00b9 But there being no ditches between the gates, an enemy taking possession of the works over the first gateway had a ready communication with all the others, which the British troops who stormed the Fort at this point took advantage of.\n\nWithin the Fort the principal building was the Mahal or palace (on the plan of one at Sira), which, though the walls were of mud, was not without some degree of magnificence. The building was of two storeys. A large open court in front was surrounded by a corridor, in the centre of which, opposite the palace, was the naubat kh\u00e1na or raised band-stand.\n\n\u00b9 The old tortuous entrance through seven gates was given up some thirty years ago and a straight entrance pierced through the wall at the side of the Delhi gate. Openings in the walls have also now been made for a wide road running east and west through the Fort, on which some new buildings have been erected.\nThe upper storey of the palace contained the public and private apartments of the Sultan and his ladies, with two balconies of state from which he gave audience. Paint and false gilding decorated the walls.\n\nBuchanan thus describes the arrangements of the building as he saw it in 1800:\u2014\u201cOn the upper story it contains four halls, each comprising two balconies of state for the prince, and each balcony faces a different cutcherry or court for giving audience. No persons, except a few trusty guards, were admitted into the hall with the Sultan; but at each end of the court was erected a balcony for the officers of the highest rank. The inferior officers occupied a hall under the balcony of the prince, open in front, and supported by columns as high as the roof of the upper story. The populace were admitted into the open court, in which there were fountains for cooling the air. At each end of the hall are private apartments, small, mean, and inconvenient. The bath consists of a small room, in which a person may sit, and have water poured over him.... There were two apartments for the ladies. One, for the principal wife, contains a cutcherry, where, like the Sultan, she gave audience to the concubines, and to the ladies of the Musalman chiefs. The other apartment belonged to the concubines. It is a square court, having at the two sides a corridor, under which the women sat at their meals and amusements.\u201d\n\nWhen the Fort was restored to Tipu at the peace of 1792, he dismantled it, but after 1799 Purnaiya had it completely restored on the former foundation. On the removal of the British garrison from Seringapatam in 1809, some of the troops had their quarters in the Fort, where the General Commanding and many of the European residents also lived. The arsenal was not transferred to it till about 1823. From 1831 the principal departments of the Administration were accommodated in the palace above described, until in 1868 the new Public Offices in Cubbon Park were completed, the removal to which carried away the few remaining European residents. The palace having partly fallen in the greater part was demolished, but the Government Press remained there till the present building was erected for it. The arsenal had been given up, when the military guards were withdrawn and the Fort was handed over to the Civil authorities on the 2nd October 1888. What remains of the palace is used for the Forest, Police and Excise offices. The Municipal office is also in the Fort.\n\n1 An inscription found in it says it was begun in 1778 and completed in 1789. The dates are expressed in phrases, meaning \u201cAbode of happiness\u201d and \u201cEnvy of heaven.\u201d\n\n2 Besides the fort itself, and the remains of the palace, objects of interest pointed out are:\u2014a dungeon near the Delhi gate in which Colonel (afterwards Sir David) Baird was confined in 1794, preparatory to exchange of prisoners with the British, and in front of the palace, a well at which he was made to draw water in order that the Sultan\u2019s ladies might see him.\nOutside, on the east, are the Lascar Lines, a quarter inhabited by large numbers of the lower orders of natives. On the west side, south of the Mysore road, is the new western extension, Chamarajendrap\u00e9te, with a large Government Hospital under construction; north of that road are the barracks of the Barr or Mysore infantry.\n\nThe most prominent buildings and places in the City limits are, the Maharaja\u2019s Palace, to the north-east, near the Cantonment Railway station; the Public Offices in Cubbon Park, with the Band Promenade around Sir Mark Cubbon\u2019s statue, and the Tennis Courts and Museum lower down. In the road from the Public Offices to the Yelahanka gate are the Government Press, the Central College and Meteorological Observatory, the District Cutcherry, with St. Martha\u2019s Hospital and the Maternity Hospital beyond to the east, and the Central Jail to the west. North of the Jail is the Race-course with the Silahdar lines to the west. Between the Race-course and the Golf Links is a new quarter composed of houses mostly in the European style, occupied by the leading Durbar officials. The cotton-mills are on the north-west, close to the Southern Mahratta Railway line, and the fine building of the woollen-mills to the south-west, also close to the line.\n\nNo account of Bangalore would be complete without a notice of the Lal Bagh. This beautiful pleasure garden, situated about a mile to the east of the Fort, appears to have been first laid out in the time of Haidar Ali (perhaps after one at Sira) and enlarged in the time of Tipu Sultan.\n\nDr. Buchanan, writing in 1800, says:\u2014\u201cThe gardens are extensive, and divided into square plots separated by walks, the sides of which are ornamented with fine cypress-trees. The plots are filled with fruit-trees and pot-herbs. The Musalman fashion is to have a separate piece of ground allotted for each kind of plant. Thus one plot is entirely filled with rose-trees, another with pomegranates, and so forth. The walks are not gravelled, and the cultivation of the whole is rather slovenly, but the people say that formerly the gardens were well kept. Want of water is the principal defect of these gardens; for in this arid country everything during the dry season must be artificially watered. The garden of Tippoo is supplied from three wells, the water of which is raised by the capily, or leather-bag, fastened to a cord passing over a pulley, and wrought by a pair of bullocks, which descend an inclined plane. This the workmen say is a much more effectual machine than the yatam. Hyder\u2019s garden is watered from a reservoir, without the assistance of machinery. The taste of Hyder accorded more with the English than that of his son. His walks are wider, his cypress-trees are not so much crowded; and in the means for watering the plots there is not so much masonry or bricklayers\u2019 work employed. There is, indeed, so much of these in the parts of Tippoo\u2019s garden, which he probably considered the finest, as almost to cover the ground, and to leave nothing but holes, as it were, through which the trees grow.\u201d\nDuring the latter part of Tipu's rule, and for long after, the Lal Bagh was supervised by two Darogas, father and son. The former, named Muhammad Ali, seems to have been invested with considerable powers and was able to do a good deal for his charge; but under Abdul Khader, the son, whose authority was probably more limited, the garden became an ill-kept jungle of fruit-trees. In 1836, Sir Mark Cubbon made over the Lal Bagh to the Agri-Horticultural Society, then newly formed in Bangalore, and assisted them with convict labour. But the Society came to an end in 1842 and restored the garden to Government. In 1856, on the recommendation of Dr. Hugh Cleghorn, it was formed into a Horticultural Garden, and a professional Superintendent was obtained from Kew for its management. This system has continued to the present time and the gardens have a wide-spread reputation. Flower and fruit shows have all along been held twice a year, in July or August and in January or February, when numerous prizes are awarded, and there is a keen competition among exhibitors, of whom the greater number are native gardeners.\n\nThe Lal Bagh contains a rare and valuable collection of tropical and sub-tropical plants, together with indigenous and foreign fruit-trees. The stock is constantly replenished by exchanges and donations or importations. Being situated under a tank, the cultivation is easily supported by irrigation. A menagerie adds to its attractions. Since the Rendition it has been extended to the east and now contains nearly 100 acres. A handsome and spacious glass house, the foundation-stone of which was laid by the late Prince Albert Victor of Wales, has been erected as an Exhibition Hall. A complete collection is being made of coloured botanical drawings of indigenous plants, for which a native artist is employed.\n\nCity Municipality.\u2014The administration of the City Municipality is conducted under the Municipal Regulations as amended by Mysore Regulations III of 1888 and I of 1890. The privilege of election was granted in 1892. The Municipal Board is now composed of a President and five ex-officio members appointed by Government, and of fourteen elected members,\u00b9 two for each Division or Ward as per margin.\u00b2 The number of qualified electors in 1894 was 4,543, of whom 1,926 actually voted.\n\n\u00b9 It has lately been ordered that half the twenty members, including the President, shall be nominated by Government, and half elected.\n\u00b2 There were eight Divisions at first, but in 1893 the Palace and High Ground Divisions were amalgamated into the Palace Division.\n\nNames of Divisions.\nI.

A separate paid President has since been appointed and the office of Vice-President abolished. In connection with the new western and northern extensions, a special City Improvements Committee was for a time appointed by Government, to carry out the apportionment and sale of sites, and to promote the suitable laying out and early occupation of the new quarters. Their operations thus relieved and assisted the work of the Board.\n\nThe following are statements of the Municipal income and expenditure for four years to 1894-5:\n\n| Receipts | 1891-92 | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Octroi   | Rs.20,230 | Rs.21,129 | Rs.25,444 | Rs.28,345 |\n| Taxes on houses and buildings | 26,272 | 18,712 | 16,931 | 19,599 |\n| Licenses | 15,200 | 14,584 | 24,290 | 24,553 |\n| Mohatrasa | 19,946 | 15,798 | 12,710 | 18,749 |\n| Rents    | 6,918 | 6,946 | 7,867 | 8,249 |\n| Fines    | 69 | 5 | 11 | 6 |\n| Miscellaneous | 16,333 | 21,936 | 31,481 | 26,993 |\n| Deposits | \u2014 | 3,523 | 5,430 | 2,387 |\n| Opening balance | \u2014 | 7,338 | 8,415 | 12,508 |\n| **Total Municipal Receipts** | Rs.1,04,968 | Rs.1,09,971 | Rs.1,32,579 | Rs.1,40,489 |\n| Contributions | 7,260 | 7,160 | 20,624 | 9,879 |\n| Jubilee Fund | 2,899 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Special Improvement Funds | 25,160 | 27,820 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Special Irrigation Fund | \u2014 | 12,256 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| **Grand total** | Rs.1,40,287 | Rs.1,57,207 | Rs.1,53,203 | Rs.1,50,368 |\n\n| Expenditure | 1891-92 | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 |\n|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Head Office charges | Rs.7,795 | Rs.5,286 | Rs.8,860 | Rs.9,969 |\n| Collections | 8,553 | 8,761 | 8,209 | 7,748 |\n| Conservancy | 16,845 | 17,937 | 18,039 | 18,667 |\n| Registration of Births and Deaths | 694 | 786 | 786 | 786 |\n| Lighting charges | 5,617 | 7,983 | 8,101 | 9,675 |\n| Public works | 38,037 | 33,832 | 50,029 | 41,128 |\n| Charitable grants | 19,105 | 15,713 | 16,650 | 16,593 |\n| Education | 7,888 | 8,408 | 7,992 | 7,510 |\n| Miscellaneous | 1,971 | 2,849 | 12,369 | 17,170 |\n| **Total Municipal Funds** | Rs.1,05,505 | Rs.1,01,555 | Rs.1,31,035 | Rs.1,29,246 |\n| Jubilee Fund | 2,899 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Special Improvement Funds | 14,414 | 38,257 | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| Contributions | 7,100 | 7,160 | 9,660 | 7,400 |\n| Closing balance | \u2014 | 10,235 | 12,508 | 13,722 |\n| **Grand total** | Rs.1,29,918 | Rs.1,57,207 | Rs.1,53,203 | Rs.1,50,368 |\n\n**Civil and Military Station.**\u2014Till the Rendition in 1881 this was known as the Cantonment (called *Dandu*\\(^1\\) by Hindus, and\n\n\\(^1\\) Pronounced Dhundoo and Lushker.\nLashkar by Musalmans). It was then made over to the British Government as an Assigned Tract, and is under the administration of the Resident. It is situated to the north-east of Bangalore Proper, and was established in 1809, on the removal of the British garrison from Seringapatam, which had proved too unhealthy for the troops. It includes 18 suburbs and covers an area of $12\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles.\n\nThe parade ground extends two miles east and west and is surrounded by a ride or mall, the Rotten Row of the station. At its western end, on a commanding site, stand the Residency, with the fine range of Mysore Public Offices rising out from the wooded grounds of Cubbon Park, and the Post Office. The north side of the parade ground is occupied by the guard houses of the Native Infantry regiments, with lines for the men some distance at the back. Further east stands St. Andrew's Kirk, and beyond that come the main-guard, the bakery for the troops and the barracks of the British Infantry. At the east end, and southerly from Trinity Church, are situated the extensive Artillery and Cavalry barracks and lines, with the native town of Halasur on the north. On the south side of the parade ground are St. Mark's Church, the Bowring Institute, the United Service Library, the Mayo Hall and the Gymkhana, besides some fine shops. From this direction thoroughfares lead south to the quarters known as Shoolay and Richmond Town, where numerous European pensioners and Eurasians live. Beyond this again are the Native Cavalry and Arab lines, and All Saints' Church.\n\nThe Cantonment bazaar, a native town in itself, lies in a valley to the north of the Infantry lines. It contains a commodious and well-kept Market, the Bowring Civil Hospital, numerous imposing stores for the sale of European goods, and large native buildings. To the north of this again is the populous district of St. John's Hill, inhabited by great numbers of European pensioned soldiers, whose neat little cottages, with the spire of the parish church rising up in their midst, give the place somewhat the appearance of an English village. To the east of St. John's Hill are the lines of the Sappers and Miners, on the north, Cleveland Town, and on the west, the Pioneer lines and the Cantonment Railway-station.\n\nAmong the buildings deserving a more particular notice are the Residency, the Convent Schools, the Roman Catholic Cathedral and St. Mary's Church, the Mayo Hall, the Kirk, the Cavalry barracks, etc. Near the New Market will be seen more than one ornamental mosque, and the gopura or tower of the Halsur pagoda is a good specimen of the Hindu pyramidal architecture.\n\n2 The Cavalry barracks occupy the site of what was the old Race-course.\nThe population of the Civil and Military Station is classified as follows:\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 176 Jains) | 28,544 | 29,407 | 58,251 |\n| Muhammadans | 12,210 | 11,682 | 23,892 |\n| Christians\u2014 | | | |\n| Europeans | 3,262 | 1,723 | 4,985 |\n| Eurasians | 1,127 | 1,522 | 2,649 |\n| Natives | 4,726 | 5,542 | 10,268 |\n| Others (23 Brahmos, 6 Parsis, &c.) | 20 | 16 | 36 |\n| **Total** | **50,189** | **49,892** | **100,081** |\n\nAn analysis of the population according to occupations, gives the following results as to means of livelihood:\n\n| | Males | Females | Totals | Per cent. |\n|---|-------|---------|--------|-----------|\n| Government\u2014 | | | | |\n| Administration | 1,825 | 1,777 | 3,602 | |\n| Defence | 6,843 | 4,424 | 11,267 | |\n| **Pasture and agriculture** | **3,187** | **2,793** | **5,980** | **5'27** |\n| **Personal and household service** | **8,625** | **8,182** | **16,807** | **16'79** |\n| **Preparation and supply of material substances** | **14,538** | **15,886** | **30,424** | **30'39** |\n| **Commerce, transport and storage** | **4,810** | **4,568** | **9,378** | **9'37** |\n| **Professions, learned and artistic** | **2,662** | **2,977** | **5,639** | **5'63** |\n| **Indefinite\u2014** | | | | |\n| Unskilled labour | 3,966 | 5,076 | 9,042 | |\n| Undefined | 299 | 432 | 731 | |\n| **Independent of work\u2014** | | | | |\n| Property or alms | 690 | 882 | 1,572 | |\n| Pensions | 2,744 | 2,895 | 5,639 | |\n| **Total** | **9,773** | | **7,211** | **7'20** |\n\nGood water is obtained from wells in some parts of the Cantonment, but in several quarters, among others the Cavalry barracks, there is no water. These barracks are supplied from the large Halsur tank and wells adjacent to it, from which the water is pumped up by an engine to the top of a rock and thence distributed in pipes. The Cantonment bazaar and Sepoy lines get water from a chain of reservoirs known by the name of Miller\u2019s tanks. There is also a tank for Shoolay.\n\nThe water supply being inadequate for the growing demands of the town, Sankey\u2019s Reservoir was designed, by the Chief Engineer after whom it is named, in order to remedy the want. It provided for collecting and storing the rain-flow over an area of $2\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles on the high ground to the north-west, about 3 miles distant, such land as\nwas under the plough being thrown out of cultivation. The run-off from the surface was conducted by means of contour channels to the reservoir, which again was connected with Miller's tanks, and afterwards with the Dharmambudhi also. Work was begun in 1875, but was interrupted and virtually stopped by the famine. The reservoir was eventually made serviceable by 1882, the total cost having amounted to 5\u00be lakhs.\n\nBut even this scheme, though affording material help, it became evident would not suffice to provide for the water supply of the Civil and Military Station, much less for that of the whole of Bangalore. A prize for the best essay on the subject was offered to public competition, and schemes and opinions of extraordinary diversity have been brought forward since by a succession of Engineer officers, several of them specially appointed by the Government of India to report upon the whole question. Indeed, there is scarcely a site or a tank for miles round Bangalore that has not formed a part of one or another project. The latest proposal was the formation of a reservoir in the Maligal valley, about 7 miles distant on the Magadi road. Meanwhile the Mysore Government have completed the Hesarghatta scheme for the supply of the City, and it seems probable that the Civil and Military Station will also be provided for from the same source. The matter is of urgency in relation to the public health.\n\nThe drainage of the bazaar and Cantonment is carried by a large sewer, passing through a tunnel in the Halsur tank, to some distance beyond Halsur, where it is applied to cultivation.\n\nAdministration.\u2014An imperium in imperio, under the control of the Resident, the Assigned Tract is provided with the various departments of administration, separate from those of the Mysore Government.\n\nLand.\u2014The area for cultivation is a little over five square miles, of which only about two-fifths are Government land (375 acres of it unculturable); the rest belongs to k\u00e1yamgutta, jodi, and sarvam\u00e1nya villages. The revenue work continued under the Deputy Commissioner of the Bangalore District till the 1st of April 1884, when it was made over to the Station District Magistrate as Collector, and he is aided by an Amildar. In Legislation, all Acts, Rules, and Regulations in force before the Rendition continued in force; but in 1883-4 a revised list of such as applied to the Civil and Military Station was issued by the Government of India, declaring to what extent and with what modifications they were to be the law. Other enactments have since\n\n---\n\n1 In 1892-93, owing to the drought, Hebbal tank was temporarily connected with Sankey's reservoir, and additional water pumped up for the use of Bangalore, both City and C and M Station.\nbeen extended to the Civil and Military Station from time to time. The Police force is composed of a District Superintendent, with (in 1894) 48 subordinate officers and 278 constables, costing Rs. 62,653.\n\nThe Courts of Criminal Justice are the Bench of Honorary Magistrates (established in September 1888), with third-class powers in regard to offences under sections 352 and 405 of the Indian Penal Code, and 34 of Act V of 1861, or against Municipal Regulations and bye-laws the penalty for which does not exceed Rs. 50; the Court of the Second Magistrate, with powers of the first class; that of the District Magistrate (who took the place of the previous Town and Cantonment Magistrate); and the Sessions Court. The powers of a High Court were vested in the Chief Judge of Mysore till May 1884, when they were transferred to the Resident, and the other courts above-named established. The duties of Civil and Sessions Judge were united in one officer till August 1891, when the Assistant Resident was made Sessions Judge, and a post of District Judge was created. The receipts in Criminal Courts for 1894\u20135 amounted to Rs. 8,377, and the charges to Rs. 25,357. The number of cases brought to trial was 2,726, involving 4,212 persons. The great majority were disposed of by the Bench of Magistrates. There is no separate jail, the Bangalore Central Jail being close at hand. For Civil Justice there are the Munsiff's Court, established in January 1887, under the Second Magistrate, with jurisdiction up to Rs. 500; the District Court, with unlimited jurisdiction, and the Small Cause Court with jurisdiction up to Rs. 500, both these being under the Civil Judge, who also hears appeals from the Munsiff. The Resident exercises the powers of a High Court. The receipts in 1894\u20135 were Rs. 35,679, and the charges Rs. 19,861. The number of suits for disposal was 2,911.\n\nFor Registration the Assistant-Resident has been Inspector-General since July 1886, relieving the Mysore officer; the District Judge is the District Registrar; and the work of Sub-Registrar, previously held by the Second Magistrate, was, in October 1888, given to the Amildar. There were 1,681 documents registered in 1894\u20135. The receipts were Rs. 6,434, and the charges Rs. 699.\n\nThe Resident's Treasury, besides dealing with the accounts of the Assigned Tract, is the medium through which the subsidy from the Mysore State is paid, and it disburses a variety of charges connected with the Military, Ecclesiastical, Post Office, Telegraph, and other services, as well as pensions, leave allowances, and other items. The total receipts in 1894\u20135 were over 98 lakhs, and the disbursements nearly 95. The District Magistrate was made also Treasury officer in October 1888, the separate post being abolished. The accounts are in the first instance audited at Madras, after which the transactions\nwhich pertain to the Residency and to the Assigned Tract are transferred to the books of the Government of India. The revenue surplus, previously credited to Mysore, is since 1884-5 retained by the Government of India. It will suffice in this place to give the Revenue and Expenditure of the Assigned Tract for the past five years:\n\n| Receipts | 1890-91 | 1891-92 | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Land Revenue | 4,599 | 3,692 | 3,125 | 5,417 | 4,445 |\n| Stamps | 65,026 | 61,833 | 71,666 | 62,763 | 68,562 |\n| Excise | 3,88,045 | 3,41,594 | 4,26,328 | 4,35,297 | 4,62,136 |\n| Forest | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 2,038 |\n| Registration | 6,023 | 5,792 | 5,923 | 6,421 | 6,175 |\n| Law and Justice\u2014Courts of Law | 2,375 | 3,319 | 2,719 | 3,593 | 3,452 |\n| Police | 1,384 | 1,380 | 1,550 | 1,762 | 1,683 |\n| Scientific and other minor departments | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1,051 | 1,223 | 1,483 |\n| Other items | 36 | 56 | 22 | 64 | 630 |\n| **Total** | Rs. 4,67,488 | 4,17,666 | 5,12,384 | 5,16,540 | 5,50,604 |\n\n| Disbursements | 1890-91 | 1891-92 | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 |\n|---------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Refunds and drawbacks | 4,377 | 5,214 | 4,889 | 3,648 | 5,539 |\n| Land Revenue | 1,731 | 1,741 | 1,745 | 1,735 | 1,741 |\n| Stamps | 653 | 651 | 690 | 696 | 729 |\n| Excise | \u2014 | 7,584 | 26,570 | 13,732 | 12,248 |\n| Registration | 685 | 622 | 694 | 579 | 699 |\n| Law and Justice\u2014Courts of Law | 48,924 | 45,878 | 41,939 | 47,237 | 44,633 |\n| \u201d \u201d Jails | 3,550 | 4,238 | 3,474 | 4,477 | 4,524 |\n| Police | 61,121 | 62,319 | 63,709 | 62,220 | 62,538 |\n| Education | 28,945 | 27,815 | 29,495 | 34,667 | 35,852 |\n| Medical | 4,437 | 4,410 | 4,329 | 8,855 | 4,767 |\n| Scientific and other minor departments | \u2014 | \u2014 | 885 | 1,011 | 1,134 |\n| Superannuation | 1,654 | 1,677 | 1,742 | 1,552 | 1,477 |\n| Stationery and printing | 1,497 | 1,316 | 1,385 | 1,589 | 1,524 |\n| Miscellaneous | 7,489 | 7,408 | 7,728 | 6,770 | 6,568 |\n| Civil works | 5,025 | 5,025 | 5,025 | 5,025 | 5,025 |\n| **Total** | Rs. 1,70,088 | 1,75,898 | 1,94,299 | 1,93,793 | 1,89,298 |\n\nThe principal item of Revenue is under Excise, and is derived from the lease of farms, grant of licenses, and the levy of duties. Arrack is supplied from the Durbar distillery, which has the exclusive privilege of manufacture and wholesale vend, the Station paying a proportionate share of the expenses for maintenance and testing. Separate contracts are made for toddy, ganja, beer and opium. The entry under Forest relates to the sale of sandalwood growing in the Station. The heading Scientific and Minor Departments accounts for fees of the Primary and Secondary School examinations, as also do the\nentries per contra. In the Disbursements, the entry against Jails represents the cost of feeding prisoners from the C and M Station committed to the Bangalore Central Jail.\n\nThe Medical institutions are the Bowring Civil Hospital and the Halsur Dispensary. The latter was established in March 1884, when also the Bowring Hospital was placed in charge of the Residency Surgeon. The numbers treated in 1894-5 at the Hospital were 1,985 in-door, and 22,809 out-door patients; at the Dispensary 8,559, all outdoor. Of the in-door, 459 were Europeans or Eurasians, and of the out-door 2,392. The remainder were 227 in and 8,770 out, Musalmans; 763 and 14,611, Hindus; 536 and 5,556, other classes. Education continued to be supervised till December 1888, gratuitously, by the Director of Public Instruction in Mysore, who was assisted by his Deputy Inspector. It was then added to the charge of the Inspector of Schools, Madras Western Circle, an old officer of the Mysore Educational Department, and on his transfer in 1894 to the Central Circle, he still retained the charge. There are no Government schools in the Civil and Military Station, all being Aided schools. Inspection is therefore the main duty that devolves on Government. The Inspector visits Bangalore in June, July and August for that purpose, and a Sub-Deputy Inspector is stationed here permanently. Probably no place in India of the size of Bangalore is better provided with the means of education for all classes, and nowhere is a more earnest attention devoted to the subject than on the part of the various private agencies at work. The following are the statistics for three periods:\n\n|                  | 1831-82 | 1887-88 | 1894-95 |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                  | For Boys | For Girls | For Boys | For Girls | For Boys | For Girls |\n| No. Pupils       |         |         |         |         |         |         |\n| Arts Colleges    | 1       | 10      | 2       | 41      | 1       | 14      |\n| Secondary Schools| 14      | 291     | 7       | 91      | 16      | 746     |\n| Primary Schools  | 23      | 1,884   | 15      | 877     | 26      | 2,082   |\n| Special          | 1       | 91      | 1       | 157     | 1       | 10      |\n| Total            | 39,276  | 22      | 968     | 453,026 | 30,1627 | 25,2757 |\n| Unaided Schools  | 52      | 1,537   | 14      | 592     | 49      | 1,965   |\n| Total            | 91      | 2,813   | 36      | 1,560   | 94      | 4,991   |\n| General total    | 127     | schools | 133     | schools | 113     | schools |\n\nAccording to caste or creed, the last total includes 1,934 Europeans\nor Eurasians, 1,081 Native Christians, 3,054 Hindus, 1,372 Muhammadans, and 29 others. The expenditure on English education was Rs. 89,724, and on Vernacular education Rs. 13,889. It was distributed among the schools of the various religious denominations as follows:\n\n| Denomination          | Government | Private | Total | Per cent |\n|-----------------------|------------|---------|-------|----------|\n|                       | Imperial   | Municipal| Fees | Other Sources |       |\n| Church of England     | 10,140     | 1,320   | 6,949 | 7,404    | 25,813 | 24'92 |\n| Church of Scotland    | 3,600      | 360     | 9,857 | 1,138    | 14,955 | 14'43 |\n| Roman Catholic        | 6,563      | 600     | 8,767 | 14,376   | 30,306 | 29'25 |\n| Wesleyan Mission      | 1,740      | 1,937   | 2,832 | 4,469    | 10,978 | 10'59 |\n| Lutheran Mission      | \u2014          | 250     | 12    | 529      | 791    | 7'6  |\n| Hindu                 | 4,800      | 900     | 4,200 | 4,154    | 14,054 | 13'56 |\n| Muhammadan            | 1,200      | 1,868   | 223   | 3,425    | 6,716  | 6'49 |\n| **Total**             | **Rs 28,043** | **7,235** | **32,840** | **35,495** | **1,03,613** | **100'00** |\n\nThe only College is St. Joseph\u2019s, which is of the second grade, educating to the standard of the First in Arts examination, and attended by both Europeans and Natives. The principal High schools are Bishop Cotton\u2019s, St. Andrew\u2019s, Baldwin, and Convent schools, for Europeans; with Narrainswami Mudaliar\u2019s for natives.\n\nStation Municipality.\u2014The municipal administration was conducted under the Bangalore Municipal Regulations of 1871 as amended by Government notification of the 28th April 1881, until superseded by the Regulations of 1883. The District Magistrate is the President, and the Board is composed of six *ex-officio* and eighteen non-official members, the latter being elected. There are six Divisions or Wards, as per margin, and the elected Commissioners are so apportioned as to represent the several classes in each. There are thus six Europeans and Eurasians, four Muhammadans, and eight Hindus and others. Elections at first took place as vacancies occurred, but in 1888 the rule was amended so as to secure a general election every two years. The Fort formed Division VII, and was represented by an extra Commissioner till given up in 1888. A tax on arts, professions, trades and callings was introduced on the 1st January 1884.

The northern and north-western part is traversed by several ranges of hills, contains large tracts of waste land, more or less covered with scrub-jungle, and is generally devoid of tanks and other artificial irrigation works. The southern and south-western parts are plain,\ncontain more populous villages, and are studded with tanks, some of which are of considerable importance.\n\nThe Arkavati flows past Closepet and K\u00fanagal through the west, and the Kanva past Malur through the east, both running from north to south. The course of the former is surrounded with lofty hills, precipices and jungle, which are characteristic of much of the taluq. Its waters are therefore little used for purposes of cultivation, except that it is fringed with a multitude of mulberry gardens, irrigated by lifts from the stream. Its tributary, the Vrishabh\u00e1vati, joins it in the extreme west. The Kanva, on emerging from the hills a short distance north of Malur, enters on a broad and fertile valley of wet and garden land, which continues to the limits of the taluq. This river is dammed near Abbur, and is made to feed several good tanks. The principal hills picturesquely grouped around the town of Closepet are Ramgiri (which formerly gave its name to the taluq), Sivangiri, Sidlukal, and Achalbetta.\n\nOwing to the broken nature of the country the soil is very varied. The produce of wet cultivation, consisting of paddy, cocoanuts, betel-leaf, plantains, and sugar-cane, is considerable. Numbers of cocoanut gardens are formed along the lower course of the Kanva river, the soil being well adapted for the purpose, and water tapped a few feet from the surface. The trees are watered only when young: on arriving at maturity they are left to depend upon rainfall and subsoil moisture. Much raw silk is produced at Closepet and Channapatna and exported, though disease among silkworms for many years destroyed the industry. The annual production is estimated at 1,850 maunds, valued at nearly 3 lakhs. Channapatna is one of the principal manufacturing and trading towns in the country. Coarse cotton cloths are woven in many parts of the taluq.\n\nThe whole of this region formed part of the Ganga dominions, Mankunda having been the royal residence in the seventh century. The western part of the taluq was included in the district of Chikka Gangav\u00e1di, whose chief town was Honganur. Under the Chola kings Mal\u00farpatna and K\u00fadal\u00far were important places. Subsequently, after having formed part of the Hoysala kingdom, the entire stretch of territory east and west between the Ghats was conferred by the fallen Vijayanagar sovereign upon Jagadeva R\u00e1yal, for his services in defending Penugonda. He made Channapatna his capital. In 1630 it was taken by the R\u00e1ja of Mysore and the territory absorbed into the Mysore kingdom.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1893, except in Bidadi h\u00f3ibli, which was settled in 1879, when a part of the Magadi taluq.\n\nThe area of the taluq was thus distributed:--\nCulturable (dry, 91,136; wet, 5,855; garden, 8,442) ... 105,433\nUnculturable (including village sites, &c.) ... ... ... 99,183\nInam villages ... ... ... ... ... ... 28,230\nState forests, plantations, and kavals ... ... ... 40,202\n\nTotal area ... Acres 273,048\n\nOf the culturable area 6,324 acres were waste.\n\nThe total revenue under all heads for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 155,950, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 156,494. The land revenue from Government lands in those years was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891-92 | 1892-93 |\n|------------|---------|---------|\n|            | Area    | Assessment | Area    | Assessment |\n| Dry        | 60,218  | 53,630   | 61,098  | 54,387   |\n| Wet        | 4,229   | 24,617   | 4,267   | 25,695   |\n| Garden     | 6,540   | 29,849   | 6,544   | 29,864   |\n| Total      | Ac. 70,987 | Rs. 1,08,096 | Ac. 71,909 | Rs. 1,09,945 |\n\nThe following was the average rainfall for 25 years (1870-1894):\n\nJan.

Alongside of the railway is the old trunk road to Mysore. From Closepet a road runs south-east to Kankanahalli, and one north to Magadi. From Channapatna there is a road southeast to Satanur, with a branch to Halagur.\n\n**Channapatna**, or **Chennapatna**.\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 38' N. lat. 77\u00b0 13' E. long., 37 miles south-west of Bangalore, on the Bangalore-Seringapatam road. Head-quarters of the Channapatna taluq, and a municipality. The industrial portion of Channapatna, the handsome city, is called Sukrav\u00e1r-p\u00e9te, Friday bazaar, and contains 6,381 of the population. The suburbs are Kottanhalli (857) and Godamodu (544).\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|---------------------|--------|----------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 1 Jain) | 2,532  | 2,658    | 5,190 |\n| Muhammadans         | 1,761  | 2,187    | 3,948 |\n| Christians           | 13     | 9        | 22    |\n| Total               | 4,306  | 4,854    | 9,160 |\nThe fort appears to have been built about 1580 by Jagadeva R\u00e1yal,\\(^1\\) who made Channapatna the capital of the territory, yielding it is said a revenue of nine lakhs of pagodas, bestowed upon him for his gallant defence of Penugonda, by the fallen Vijayanagar prince, to whom his daughter was married. Possessions which included such widely distant places as Mulbagal and Periyapatna, Kankanhalli and Budihal, thus suddenly acquired, must have formed a government more extensive than consolidated. The original possessions of the family were in Baramahal. Buchanan states that they were of the Telugu Banajiga caste and rose to power about the fourteenth century. The following names are given of the R\u00e1yals of this line who ruled at Channapatna:\u2014Ranoji Raya, Imma\u1e0di Jagadeva, 15 years; Mumma\u1e0di Jagadeva, 8 years; Kum\u00e1ra Jagadeva, 7 years; and Ankusha Raya, 16 years. The fort stood a long siege in 1630, when it was captured by Chama Raja Wodeyar of Mysore. In 1759 it was surprised by the Mahratta army under Gopal Hari, but was speedily released by Haidar Ali. It was repaired by the Dewan Purniah and contains portions of a palace erected for a relative of the then Maharaja, but has become much depopulated by reason of extreme unhealthiness from fever.\n\nThe P\u00e9te lies to the north-east of the fort. It is celebrated for the manufacture of lacquered ware and toys, of fine steel wires for strings of musical instruments, and of glass bracelets, of all of which an account will be found elsewhere. It is the residence of a large number of Muhammadans belonging to the Labbe and Daira sects, who trade with the western coast.\n\nNorth of the p\u00e9te are two large Muhammadan tombs, one erected in memory of Akil Shah Kadiri, the religious preceptor of Tipu, and the other in honour of Savyid Ibrahim, a commandant of Bangalore, distinguished for his humanity to the English prisoners taken by Tipu.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-93 | 1893-94 | 1894-95 | 1895-96 |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 1,460) | 5,027   | 3,518   | 3,895   | 4,065   |\n| Expenditure    | 5,606   | 3,893   | 3,486   | 4,288   |\n\nClosepet.\u2014A Sub-Division of the Bangalore District, composed of Channapatna, Magadi and Kankanhalli taluqs.

There is an inscription on a pillar in the town to this effect in Persian and Kannada. It is generally called in Kannada Hosapete, in Hindustani Nuvipet, both meaning the new town. It is also called Ramgiri, from a neighbouring hill, at foot of which the original town stood. Closepet was founded in 1800 by the Dewan Purnaiya, for greater security of the high road, which there passed through a wild and jungly tract. It was at the same time made the head-quarters of the Bargeer, or irregular horse. The horse-breeding establishment of the Silahdars, since removed to Kunigal (Tumkur District), was formerly at Closepet.\n\nThe town has an agrahara at the side of the river, with a temple of Arkesvara, and a chatram established by Purnaiya. The Muhammadans here are largely engaged in the rearing of silkworms. This industry was brought nearly to a stand by the disease which for some years destroyed the insects: those engaged in it emigrating in large numbers to the coffee districts. But the industry has now revived.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance, Rs. 1,938) | 2,717   | 2,940   | 2,975   | 2,810   |\n| Expenditure      | 3,018   | 2,953   | 3,634   | 4,503   |\n\nDevanhalli.\u2014A taluq in the north-east. Area 232 square miles. Head-quarters at Devanhalli. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with Population.\u2014Devanhalli, 6,693; Vadigenhalli, 3,970; B\u00fadigere, 1,591.\n\nThe taluq was abolished in 1882, but re-established in 1886. The S. Pin\u00e1kini forms a part of its eastern boundary, and receives all the smaller streams. The country undulates in gentle curvatures, the valleys being fertile and well cultivated. The elevated parts are covered with low jungle. There are a few small hills and rocks to the north and west, but generally speaking it is an open country, healthy and well supplied with good water.\n\nIn addition to the usual dry and wet crops, there was, until prohibited, some cultivation of the poppy for opium. Potatoes of good quality are raised in considerable quantities. Pamelos attain a large size. Coffee cultivation has been recently commenced on an extended scale in the west. Sugar of superior quality was formerly manufactured, under the instruction of some Chinese brought over for that purpose by Tipu Sultan. A few coarse cotton cloths and cumblis are made.\n\nAn early place of importance in the taluq appears to have been Nellurpatna in the east, a town which has lain for centuries in ruins. In the thirteenth century Kund\u00e1na seems to have been the royal residence of the Hoysala king R\u00e1man\u00e1tha, who had possession of the south and east of the Hoysala dominions. Devanhalli was subsequently founded by one of the family of refugees who, settling at Avati, became the founders of the Magadi, Chik-Ballapur, and other lines of chiefs. Vadigenhalli, which is largely populated by merchants, is one of the chief trading-places in the Bangalore District.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1885, at the time when the taluq had been broken up and portions annexed to other taluqs. Thus Kundana hobli was assigned to Dod-Ballapur taluq, J\u00e1la hobli to Bangalore taluq, and Devanhalli hobli to Chik-Ballapur taluq. The wet rates were found to be generally so high as to be prohibitive, in\nconsequence of which all available manure was applied exclusively to the dry fields, and much rice land was waste. The batayi system which prevailed was also unfavourable to cultivation in many ways. The new Survey rates have rectified these matters. In the north of the taluq talpargis, or surface springs, are numerous, and the supply of water from them almost unfailing. Channels led off from these talpargis irrigate rice and sugar-cane extensively. When the water ceases to flow of itself, a jata is erected, and the water thus lifted at the fountain head. Wells are very numerous, and water is found with certainty almost anywhere in the low-lying lands, not far from the surface.\n\nThe total revenue under all heads for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,24,394, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,35,105.

II.\nA fair is held every Wednesday, attended by 500 persons.\n\nDevanhalli appears to have been originally a small village, named Devandoddi from Deva its headman. About the year 1501 Malla Baire Gauda, a son of one of the refugees from Kanchi who settled at Avati, being led by auspicious omens, formed the resolution of building a fort on the spot. The consent of Deva Gauda was obtained with difficulty, and only after the bestowal of liberal compensation and the promise that the new town should bear his name. A fort, the remains of which were formerly visible inside the present one, was accordingly erected by Malla Baire Gauda and named Devanhalli, or Devandhalli. He conferred the government upon his brother Sanna Baire Gauda, who succeeded in bringing a large tract of the surrounding country under cultivation. He reigned 40 years and was succeeded by his son Baire Gauda, who reigned 25 years. The following chiefs succeeded to the government, each being the son of the preceding. Day\u00e1l Baiche Gauda ruled 37 years, Mudda Baire Gauda 20 years, Immadi Sanna Baire Ganda 37 years, Gopal Gauda 35 years, Dodda Baire Gauda 54 years, and Rangappa Gauda only 10 months. The latter dying without issue, was succeeded by his relative Chikkappa Gauda of Chik-Ballapur, three months after whose accession Devanhalli was invested by the Mysore army under Nanja Raj. It fell in 1749 after a gallant defence of 8 months and was thenceforward annexed to Mysore.\n\nIn this siege Haidar Ali, the future ruler of the country, first gained distinction as a volunteer horseman, and at Devanhalli his son and successor Tipu was born. These circumstances were sufficient to invest the place with peculiar interest in the eyes of the family.\u00b9 Haidar therefore commenced rebuilding the fort. It was built of stone, in the form of an oval, flanked with circular bastions and two cavaliers on the eastern face, and was not quite completed when invested in 1791 by the army under Lord Cornwallis, to whom it easily submitted. When the fort was erected, the old p\u0113te surrounding it to the south and east was levelled to the ground, to prevent its sheltering the besiegers in case of an attack, and a new one on rising ground half a mile to the westward was afterwards erected, called the Sultan P\u0113te. This was soon deserted for the old quarter after the capture.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance, Rs. 1,531) ... | 1,284 | 1,308 | 2,406 | 2,870 |\n| Expenditure     | 2,418 | 1,494 | 2,174 | 3,537 |\n\n\u00b2 The site of Haidar's house is still pointed out, to the west of the fort.\nDod-Ballapur.\u2014A taluq in the north-west.

The N. Pin\u00e1kini rises on the north-eastern frontier and immediately leaves the taluq. Near the same spot rises the Arkavati, which, flowing S.S.W., receives the drainage of the entire taluq and supplies several large tanks, particularly at Dod-Ballapur, Kakolu, and Hesarghatta. The country is open and in general free from very sensible irregularities of surface. All the west, some parts of the south, and the neighbourhood of the hills on the frontier are covered with jungle, the pasturage in which forms a source of revenue.\n\nThe soil generally is good. Besides the usual crops, some tobacco is cultivated and a small quantity of potatoes. Coffee cultivation is being introduced in the east. Weavers are numerous in Dod-Ballapur and cloths of the commoner descriptions are manufactured throughout the taluq to a considerable extent. Sericulture, which for many years was at a standstill, is again making progress. The famine of 1877\u20138 affected this taluq more severely than any other in the Bangalore District.\n\nPassing over the times of the Gangas,\u00b9 the Cholas and the Hoysalas, the country at a later period formed part of the dominions of Malla Baire Gauda, the founder of Devanhalli, who, resigning that possession\n\n\u00b9 Chola-Ganga, called the great king of Orissa, is said in inscriptions to have been born in the Hejj\u00e1ji Twelve of the K\u00e1dan\u00far Seventy, which are both in this taluq (see Vol. I., p. 317).\nto his brother, and led by auspicious omens, founded the present Dod-Ballapur. With the countenance of the Vijayanagar king, who maintained a shadow of the former state at Penugonda, he speedily subdued all the neighbouring tract of country, forming the Goribidnur and Gudibandha taluqs, and possessed himself of a territory yielding a revenue of a lakh of pagodas. His descendants continued to rule this dominion until it was subdued by the Bijapur army under Randulha Khan. The Mahrattas subsequently held it for a short time, when it was taken in 1689 by the Mughals under Khasim Khan and dismembered. After annexing the north to Chik-Ballapur, and other parts to Sira, the remainder was formed into a j\u00e1gir yielding a revenue of 54,000 pagodas, and bestowed on a general named Ali Khuli Khan. On his death it passed to his son, and afterwards formed a part of the province of Sira, until subdued by Haidar and incorporated with the State of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1881. Alternate forcing of the revenue, under the batayi system, and checking it under an erroneous system of wet rates, it was found, had exhausted as well as misdirected the resources of the taluq. But the new settlement remedied these defects. The soils are best in the south, and worst in the north and north-east. They range from light red to dark brown, the latter being generally found in the low-lying lands. The red soils have a large admixture of sand. Talpargis or surface springs are numerous.\n\nThe total land revenue for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,57,620, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,77,943. The amount realized from Government lands was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891\u201392 | 1892\u201393 |\n|------------|---------|---------|\n|            | Area    | Assessment | Area    | Assessment |\n| Dry        | 60,035  | 79,937   | 61,044  | 81,160   |\n| Wet        | 5,240   | 27,445   | 7,466   | 41,019   |\n| Garden     | 1,296   | 9,547    | 1,344   | 9,912    |\n| Total      | Ac. 66,571 | Rs.1,16,929 | Ac. 69,854 | Rs.1,32,091 |\n\nThe following was the average rainfall at Dod-Ballapur for 25 years (1870\u20131894).\n\nJan.

Similarly, in Hindustani it is called **Bara-Ballapur** and in Telugu **Pedda-Ballapuram.** It is said to derive its name from the circumstance that a cow used to drop a **balla** of her milk daily over a certain ant-hill, an omen which led to the foundation of the town.\n\nIt was an important place of trade in the twelfth century under the Hoysala kings. But Malla Baire Gauda of Avati, the founder of Devanhalli, was also the founder of the present Dod-Ballapur. He was revolving in his mind the import of the omens he had witnessed in hunting, when the god Adi Narayana was revealed in a dream as the dweller in the ant-hill above mentioned. A temple and fort were shortly erected, the jungle cleared and cultivation encouraged. Obtaining authority from the king at Penugonda to punish the neighbouring refractory pallegars, Malla Baire Gauda speedily possessed himself of territory yielding a revenue of a lakh of pagodas. In the government of this he established his brother Haveli Baire Gauda, who died after a prosperous reign of 20 years and was succeeded by his son Dodda Haveli Baire Gauda. He ruled 25 years and was followed by his son Haveli Baire Gauda, who ruled for 40 years. On his death Chikkappa Gauda, the heir, being a minor, the government was for a time conferred on Tammanna Gauda, the nephew and Dalavayi of the late chief. He discharged the trust reposed in him with zeal and fidelity for ten years, when he died, and Chikkappa Gauda, now come to years of maturity, succeeded. Three years after his accession Dod-Ballapur was besieged\nand taken by the Bijapur army under Randulha Khan. After 40 years of possession by that power it was surrendered to the Mahrattas, by whom the fort was enlarged and various temples erected. In ten years it was invested by the Mughals under Khasim Khan, and yielded in 1689 after an obstinate defence of two months.\\(^1\\) Dod-Ballapur and a part of the surrounding country were then formed into a j\u00e1gir yielding a revenue of 54,059 pagodas, and bestowed on a favourite general named Ali Khuli Khan. He enjoyed it only for a short time and died. It was next bestowed on his son Durga Khuli Khan, then Subadar of Sira, which however he shortly after relinquished and retired to Dod-Ballapur, but only enjoyed it for one year. It remained attached to the government of Sira for 49 years, when it was seized by the Nizam, and bestowed as a j\u00e1gir on Abbas Khuli Khan. In 1761 it was captured by Haidar Ali and has ever since been subject to Mysore.\n\nThe fort, of which only the name remains, is said to have been erected with stones from the ruins of Rajaghatta. There are remains of several fine buildings and tanks in the fort, the principal, now almost destroyed, being the Ashur Khana erected by Abbas Khuli Khan, and a fine well with three flights of stairs leading down to it and a very stout stone grating over the water. At the west of the town is the darga or tomb of a saint named Mohiuddin Chishti, said to have died nearly 200 years ago. It is built of materials taken from Hindu temples. The town extends lengthwise north and south for above two miles. Cotton cloths in great variety are made here.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 3,302) | 1,722 | 1,993 | 4,052 | 4,265 |\n| Expenditure | ... | 3,095 | 2,950 | 4,056 | 5,605 |\n\n**Domlur.**\u2014A suburb of Bangalore, on the east, included in the Civil and Military Station. Population 792. On an old temple are some Grantha and Tamil inscriptions of the time of the Hoysala king V\u00edra-R\u00e1man\u00e1tha, the thirteenth century. The name of the village was Dombalur or Tombalur, perhaps Tumbalur, which may be a clue to the title of one of the earliest Kannada authors (see Vol. I., p. 496). It also had the Brahman name of Des'im\u00e1nikka-pa\u1e6d\u1e6dana.\n\n\\(^1\\) This capture is recorded on a stone in the fort, which bears a Hoysala inscription of 1267 A.D. The idolatrous symbols at the top have been removed and the Persian inscription has been engraved in their place.\nDommasandra.\u2014A village in the north-east of Anekal taluq, 3 miles west of Sarjapur, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus            | 916   | 918     | 1,834 |\n| Muhammadans       | 232   | 213     | 445   |\n| Christians        | 2     | 3       | 5     |\n| Total             | 1,150 | 1,134   | 2,284 |\n\nThere is a considerable weaver population, and the Dommasandra cloths are in good repute.\n\nMunicipal Funds.\n\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 865) | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Expenditure                     | 451    | 329    | 686    | 745    |\n|                                 | 685    | 682    | 1,275  | 1,267  |\n\nDuckworth.\u2014One of the Eurasian and Anglo-Indian settlements (see Whitefield) in the east of the Bangalore taluq. It is 10 miles east of Bangalore, and 2 miles south of Sausmond. It was the outcome of proposals by Dr. Duckworth, after whom it is named, for assisting military pensioners and people of small means to settle on the land and acquire homes for themselves. His scheme provided for an allotment of 150 acres to a batch of ten families (preference being given to Government pensioners) at the rate per family of 10 acres of arable land for cultivation, and 5 acres for pasturage and fuel planting. Grain seed, implements and cattle, to be supplied gratis at starting, and for a period of 12 months a supplementary allowance of Rs. 10 a month to be made to each family, to be spent in improving the land. Some of the first settlers seem to have turned out badly, but in 1886 there were 7 resident, and 4 non-resident settlers. Their holdings were from 10 to 12 acres of land each, with a cottage built by the Association at the cost of about Rs. 120.\n\nGangavara.\u2014A village in Devanhalli taluq, on the right bank of the S. Pinakini, near the head of the Hoskote tank. Population 405. The inscriptions and remains show that it was a place of some importance in the eighth century under the Gangas, and subsequently under the Cholas. The Somesvara temple has some picturesque fluted pillars with a seated lion for the pedestal.\n\nGavipur.\u2014A suburb of Bangalore City, about a mile south-west of the Fort. Population 733.\nIts chief feature is the cave temple of Gavi Gang\u00e1dharesvara, the Sivite emblems attached to which, carved on a gigantic scale out of solid stone, are curious specimens of the mason's art. They consist of the tr\u00eds\u00fala or trident, the chhatri or umbrella, and the damaruga or double drum, each being 15 feet or more in height and proportionately wide. They were executed in the time of Kempe Gauda.\n\nHalasur.\u00b9\u2014One of the suburbs of the Civil and Military Station of Bangalore, situated north-east of the Cantonment, close to the large tank of the same name. It appears to have been founded by Kempe Gauda, under the following circumstances. The surrounding country was then covered with forest, into which he had wandered from Yelahanka in pursuit of game, and being much fatigued, laid himself down under the shade of a tree. In his sleep the god Somes'vara, formerly worshipped on that spot by Mandava rishi, and which lay buried in the sand, appeared in a dream, and revealing to him the existence of a hidden treasure, bid him therewith erect a temple, promising at the same time the divine favour. He accordingly secured the treasure and built the Somes'vara pagoda, employing, it is said, a sculptor from Belur, a descendant of the famous Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, to ornament the walls with scenes from the marriage of Siva and Parvati. The gopura is an imposing structure in the Dravidian style. The village of Halasur was also built, containing residences for the attendant Brahmans, and made the kasba of 33 villages, from each of which one kolaga for each kandaga of grain was appointed to be given as an endowment for the maintenance of the religious services. There is another temple on a large scale, dedicated to Subba Raya, but unfinished. The village is a prosperous one and contains several wealthy residents of Tamil origin.\n\nHindiginal.\u2014A trading village in the north-east angle of the Hoskote taluq, near where the Kolar-Vadigenhalli road crosses the Bangalore-Kadapa road. Population 1,020.\n\nHonganur.\u2014A village about 5 miles south of Channapatna, headquarters of the hobli of the same name. Population 1,705. In the time of the Ganga kings it was the chief town of Chikka Gangav\u00e1di, a district which occupied most of the valley of the Shimsha.\n\nHoskote.\u2014A taluq in the east. Area 271 square miles. Headquarters at Hoskote. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n\u00b9 The form Alsur (Ulsoor) is due to the Tamil pronunciation, there being no aspirate in that language.\nPrincipal places, with Population.\u2014Hoskote, 4,917; Sulibele, 1,927; Hindiginal, 1,020.\n\nAt the time of the British conquest Hoskote included Jangamkote, Malur, Masti, and Sarjapur. The hobli of Mugalur was added to it in 1873 from Sarjapur taluq.\n\nTowards the north the S. Pinakini forms the western boundary. After entering the taluq it supplies the large tank at Hoskote, and thence flows southwards past Kadgodl, where it receives a stream from the Bangalore taluq on the west. With the exception of some low hills on the north, the country is open and easily crossed in all parts. The tracts best cultivated are those bordering on the S. Pinakini and the neighbourhood of Nandagudi eastwards. From Nandagudi southwards and along the Bangalore road the soil is stony and unfertile. Some cultivation is carried on of potatoes, and formerly the poppy was also grown, in addition to the usual wet and dry crops. Considerable attention is given to the cultivation of hay for the Bangalore market, especially in the neighbourhood of Hoskote.\n\nAt Nandagudi are traces of former buildings, of which it is related that they mark the site of Patalipur, the capital of Uttunga Bhuja Raya, whose nine nephews, the Nava Nanda, being imprisoned by him, were released by the schemes of Chanikya. The story is taken from the Mudra Rakshasa, a play on the successful usurpation of Chandra Gupta and the establishment of the Nanda kings. In a similar manner Dharmesvara, in the same neighbourhood, is connected with Dharma Raya and the Pandus. They are stated to have been rendered insensible by the poisonous exhalation of a well made by Duryodhana for their destruction. This incident is said to be sculptured on a pillar at the temple over the spot. Two masons, engaged in the repairs of\nthis temple 60 years ago, are related to have fallen down senseless from the exhalation on shifting the stones covering the well.\n\nThe country at times belonged to the Gangas, and to the Pallavas or Nolambas. The Cholas followed, but subsequently it formed part of the Hoysala dominions, and on their partition, went with the Tamil territory to R\u0101man\u0101tha. Eventually, under Vijayanagar, it became a possession of the Sugatur family, one of whom erected Hoskote, or the new fort, as distinguished from Kolar, and settled traders in the place. Afterwards it became a part of the territory administered by Shahji, the representative of the Bijapur princes, and changing hands several times, was finally ceded to Haidar in 1761, and united to the kingdom of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1886. The total land revenue in 1891-2 (15 months), was Rs. 1,58,592, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,67,983. The amount realized from Government lands was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891-2 | 1892-3 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|\n|             | Area   | Assessment | Area   | Assessment |\n| Dry         | 38,062 | 68,363   | 38,496 | 69,140   |\n| Wet         | 3,921  | 24,930   | 5,301  | 33,884   |\n| Garden      | 2,421  | 13,573   | 2,558  | 13,827   |\n| Total       | Ac. 44,404 | Rs. 1,06,806 | Ac. 46,355 | Rs. 1,16,851 |\n\nThe average rainfall at Hoskote for 25 years (1870-1894) and at K\u0101dgodi for 2 years (1893-4) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Hoskote | 0\u00b021 | 0\u00b039 | 0\u00b059 | 3\u00b044 | 1\u00b088 | 2\u00b066 | 3\u00b061 | 4\u00b081 | 4\u00b005 | 2\u00b060 | 0\u00b053 | ... | 24\u00b077 |\n| K\u0101dgodi | 0\u00b090 | 2\u00b012 | 1\u00b062 | 3\u00b066 | 2\u00b071 | 4\u00b014 | 3\u00b046 | 4\u00b028 | 7\u00b026 | 2\u00b026 | ... | 32\u00b041 |\n\nThe Bangalore branch of the Madras Railway crosses the south of the taluq, with stations at Whitefield and Devankundi. The Bangalore-Kolar road runs through the taluq from west to east, and gives off at Hoskote roads to Kadapa, to Jangamkote and to Sulibele northwards, to Malur eastwards, and to K\u0101dgodi southwards.\n\n**Hoskote.**\u2014A town on the left bank of the S. Pin\u0101kini, situated in 13\u00b0 4' N. lat., 77\u00b0 48' E. long, 16 miles E.N.E. of Bangalore, on the Bangalore-Kolar road, and 6 miles north-east of the Whitefield Railway station. Head-quarters of the Hoskote taluq, and a municipality.\nAt the Amritesvara rathotsava, held for ten days from Vaishakha suddha 11, there is an assemblage of 4,000 people. On full moon day in the same month, Dharma Rayan karaga is attended by 5,000 people.\n\nHosa-kote, new fort, so called to distinguish it from Kolar, was built about 1595 by Timme Gauda, the chief of Sugatur, who had recently settled at Kolar and obtained from the Penugonda sovereign the title of Chikka R\u00e1yal. The superiority of the soil to that of Kolar induced him to fix on the new site, as well as the facility with which the waters of the S. Pin\u00e1kini might there be dammed for purposes of irrigation. The large Hoskote tank, with an embankment two miles long, which forms when full a sheet of water not less than ten miles round, bears testimony to the sagacity of his choice. Raising an armed force, he subdued Anekal, Mulbagal and Punganur, and added them to his possessions. He ruled till 1632. Shortly after, the territory was conquered by the Bijapur army, and subsequently conferred as a j\u00e1gir on Shahji, the governor of Karnatak Bijapur, who resided at Bangalore. On the capture of these districts by the Mughal troops under Khasim Khan in 1663, they became part of the province of Sira. In 1756 Hoskote was taken by the Mysore army, but was subdued the following year by the Mahrattas. It changed hands several times, until finally ceded to Haidar Ali and annexed to Mysore in 1761.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance, Rs. 782) ... | 1,166 | 1,231 | 2,227 | 2,228 |\n| Expenditure ... | 1,865 | 1,258 | 2,117 | 2,713 |\n\n**Hulikal.**\u2014A village in the north of Magadi taluq, head-quarters of the hobli of the same name. Population 673.\n\nIt is said to have been founded in 1310 by the Hoysala king, under the following circumstances:\u2014A sannyasi named Guriachinta, who had gained his favour, lived at the foot of the adjacent hill called Ramalinga.\nBetta. On a certain day one of the holy man's bullocks, attacked by a tiger, not only threw off its assailant but killed it. This being reported to the king, he considered it a happy omen and ordered the hill to be fortified, naming it, in memory of the incident, huli-kallu, tiger-rock, or, according to the tradition of the place, huli-kollu, tiger-kill. It subsequently came into the possession of Baiche Gauda of Koratigere, whose descendants held it as tributaries of the Mysore kings. The chief was expelled by Tipu Sultan and the place annexed to Mysore.\n\nHuskur.\u2014A village in Bidarguppe hobli, Anekal taluq. Population 778.\n\nA fair takes place on Friday, attended by 300 people. A festival (parishe) is held for five days from Phalguna bahula 3rd, in honour of Madhuramma, at which 3,000 persons assemble and as many as 10,000 bullocks are brought for sale.\n\nColonel Boddam gave the following account of a visit to the cattle fair in 1871:\u2014\"There are peculiarities about this fair; it is essentially one for low castes, both human and bovine. There is a superstition that cholera and cattle plague are averted by worship at the Huskur temple (a very insignificant one) at this time; consequently all the idol cars of the surrounding villages are dragged to the temple, each with about forty bullocks and their owners and a rabble; usually there are not less than 25 of these cars, run up like high Chinese pagodas on a framework of bamboo and covered with gaudy paintings of Hindu deities. The religious ceremonies last five days, and then the cattle fair is held, after which the cars are taken back; on an average about 10,000 bullocks are collected, but the greater portion of them are inferior cattle. Looking over the lot, I found all the good caste animals were born outside the Province, principally at Mahadeseo. I only came upon one good animal bred in this District; the mother was said to be of fine breed. As a rule the people do not keep fine cows; they are content with the small cows of the country for giving milk, and do not attend to breeding. This year, owing to many people being still engaged in threshing their grain, which had been delayed by the recent unusual rains, there were less idol cars brought (15 only), and fewer bullocks\u2014not 8,000 in all.\"\n\nKankanhalli.\u2014A taluq in the south.

The southern half of the taluq is a succession of hills and forests, affording extensive grazing grounds, in proximity to the river Kaveri. The principal heights near Kankanhalli are: on the west, Banati Mari Betta, 3,422 feet above the level of the sea, Narasimha Deva Betta, and Mudvadi Betta; on the east, Bilikal Betta and Koppa Betta, the latter 2,822 feet in elevation.\n\nThe Arkavati is joined on the west near Mudvadi by the Vrishabhavati from Bangalore, which itself receives a little higher up the Suvarnamukhi from Anek\u00e1l taluq. Another considerable stream from the same quarter unites with the Arkavati at Kankanhalli, as well as two further south, one on the west and one on the east. Ragi, are, and the castor-oil plant form the principal cultivation of the open parts. Tamarinds and cocoanuts are also important products, as well as mulberry. But the soils are for the most part inferior, and generally very shallow and rocky.\n\nThe taluq was included in the territory granted to Jagadeva Rayal, and by him the fort of Kankanhalli seems to have been erected. It was captured along with Channapatna by the Mysore Raja in 1630.\n\nThe revenue settlement was sanctioned in 1896. The area of the taluq is thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 94,316; wet, 1,671; garden, 2,651) . . . . 98,638\n- Unculturable (including village sites, &c.) . . . . 175,264\n- Inain villages . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13,825\n- Forests (84,391) and iavalis (6,003) . . . . . . . . . 90,394\n\nTotal area acres . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 378,121\n\nOf the culturable area 4,263 acres are waste.\nThe total revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,04,879, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,00,183.

It was captured by Chama Raja of Mysore in 1630.\n\nThe principal feature in the fort is the ancient temple of Ranganatha, much out of repair. The town was twice burned or laid waste by Tipu Sultan to prevent its being of use to the British army on their march to Seringapatam. The beasts of prey increased so much in consequence that during the last two years of his reign eighty persons\nwere carried away by tigers from within the walls of the fort. Except on the north it is surrounded at a short distance by lofty mountains and thick jungle. On the banks of the Arkavati are many cocoanut gardens.\n\nThe alliteration of the name excites attention and arouses curiosity as to its derivation. Buchanan has the following remarks on the subject:\u2014\"I went three cosses to Kankaranhalli, commonly called Kankanhalli. The former name is universally said by the natives to be the proper one; but the derivation which they give of it seems very forced. Kanikarna, they say, is the genitive case of kanikar, which in the Tamil language signifies a proprietor of land; and halli, in the language of Karnata, is a village.\" In a note he adds: \"The name of this village is properly Kanya-karna, composed of two Sanskrit words, kanya, virgin, or the goddess Bhavani, and karna, ear.\" This cannot be said to throw much light on the question.\n\nAn inscription of the 13th century gives the name as K\u0101\u1e47ik\u0101rahalli, which accords with the first explanation.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 595) | 1,233 | 1,128 | 1,888 | 1,882 |\n| Expenditure     | 1,868 | 1,077 | 1,660 | 2,264 |\n\nKengeri.\u2014A town in the Bangalore taluq, 9 miles south-west of Bangalore, on the Bangalore-Mysore railway. It is a municipality, and till 1873 was the head-quarters of a taluq of the same name.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 733   | 702     | 1,435 |\n| Muhammadans       | 91    | 94      | 185   |\n| Christians         | 2     | \u2014       | 2     |\n| Total              | 826   | 796     | 1,622 |\n\nKengeri or Ten-g\u00e9ri, southern street or road, appears formerly to have been of greater extent than it is now, but was destroyed by Tipu to prevent its giving shelter to the army of Lord Cornwallis. The town was for a short time the seat of the raw silk trade. In 1866 Signor de Vecchj, an Italian gentleman, noticing the then depressed condition of the industry, made exertions, with the assistance of the Government, for its revival. He attributed the mortality of the silk-worms to degeneracy owing to continued propagation from the same stock, to feeding on inferior species of leaf, and to want of care in rearing. The raw silk produced was also deteriorated in value from negligent methods\nof reeling. In order to remedy these defects, cartoons of silk-worm eggs were imported from Japan and freely distributed, superior kinds of mulberry-trees (*Morus sinensis*, *M. perotetra*, *M. alba*, and *M. nigra*) were grown from cuttings and seed, and finally a steam factory for Silk Filature was established at Kengeri, with eighty basins. The hands employed in this delicate process were female orphans from the Bangalore Convent, under the charge of native nuns. These measures produced their natural effect, and a great impetus was given for a time to sericulture. Not only were cocoons bought to any extent for filature, but the refuse silk (*chusum*), not taken into consideration before, became an important article in the market. But the severe drought of 1866 proved disastrous to the imported worms. Fresh were obtained in two successive seasons. After all, however, the eradication of disease among the worms was not effected, and the business was at length given up.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 1,449) | 441     | 444     | 895     | 985     |\n| Expenditure ... | 1,035   | 932     | 1,521   | 1,123   |\n\n**Kudalur.**\u2014A village on the left bank of the Kanva, about 4 miles south-east of Channapatna.

Its bed being deep and generally surrounded by hills, the country adjoining derives little benefit from it as to cultivation. The streams of the north-east flow into the Arkavati; those of the centre and west flow south, forming the Kanva; those of the north-west flow south-west into Kunigal. The loftiest mountain is S\u00e1vandroog, 4,024 feet above the sea. It is surrounded by deep defiles, covered with rocks and jungle, among which is situated the S\u00e1vandroog state forest, 17 square miles in extent. Bairandurga is a conspicuous hill, formerly fortified. Much bamboo and various kinds of timber are met with in the southern parts of the taluq. There are several productive tanks, the one at Tippasandra being very extensive.\n\nThe soil generally is a shallow red mould mixed with stones, not very fertile unless when the rains set in plentifully and at the right seasons. The crops consist chiefly of those raised without irrigation, ragi, gram, avare, togari, &c. Tobacco is grown to some extent.\n\nThe Cholas appear to have held the district in the 12th century, followed by the Hoysalas. From them it is said to have been wrested by Pratapa Rudra of Orangal, and soon after to have been conquered by Harihara, king of Vijayanagar. The deputy of the Vijayanagar sovereigns, S\u00e1manta R\u00e1ya by name, taking advantage of the feebleness of the government, declared his independence, and the country was held by his descendants to the third generation, when Kempe Gauda, the chief of Bangalore, obtained possession. In his family it remained till 1728, when it was captured by the Raja of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1879. The total revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,50,164, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,52,650. The revenue realized from Government lands was thus apportioned:\n\n| Cultivation | 1891-2 | 1892-3 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|\n|             | Area   | Assessment | Area   | Assessment |\n| Dry         | 65,528 | 71,256    | 68,392 | 73,909    |\n| Wet         | 5,419  | 21,479    | 5,766  | 22,886    |\n| Garden      | 2,321  | 10,675    | 2,342  | 10,776    |\n| Total       | Ac. 73,268 | Rs. 1,03,410 | Ac. 76,500 | Rs. 1,07,571 |\n\nVOL.

It soon passed into the hands of the Hoysala kings, and after them into those of the Vijayanagar line. In the time of Achyuta R\u00e1ya of that house, S\u00e1manta R\u00e1ya was appointed Adhik\u00e1ri, or manager of the district. He enlarged the town and fortified the height of S\u00e1vandurga, in return for which that part of the country was granted him as an amara or j\u00e1gir. He enjoyed it for 28 years, from 1543 to 1571, and was succeeded by his son Sampaja R\u00e1ya. He governed for 17 years and repaired the temple of Rangaswami at Tirumale. His son Chikka R\u00e1ya or M\u00falaka R\u00e1ya, after ruling 16 years, threw himself in a fit of madness into the pool on the droog and was drowned. He left no children, and Gangappa N\u00e1yak, the tal\u00e1ri or watchman of Balakara, taking advantage of the confusion, seized the government and strove to enrich himself by plunder. But Imma\u1e0di Kempe Gau\u1e0da of Bangalore marched against him, took the place and put him to death. Kempe Gau\u1e0da being shortly after ousted from Bangalore, retired to Magadi, which is thenceforward identified with that family, whose history is given elsewhere. Magadi was captured by the Mysore army in 1728 and the chief carried prisoner to Seringapatam, where he died, the last of his line.\nThe fort is now deserted. The P\u00e9te is built on a slope to the north. Beyond the eastern end is the village of Tirumale, and some distance from the western end a large temple of Somesvara in ruins.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance, Rs. 675) ... | 1,637  | 1,677  | 2,949  | 3,071  |\n| Expenditure ... ... ... ... | 3,095  | 2,131  | 3,918  | 3,723  |\n\n**Malur.**\u2014A village on the banks of the Kanva. Head-quarters of the Malur hobli, Channapatna taluq. Population 2,161.\n\nMost of the residents are Brahmans of the Srivaishnava sect: they give the village the name of R\u00e1jendrasimha-nagara. There are several ruined temples in the place, and a number of Chola inscriptions; but the large temple of Aprameyaswami is maintained in good order. The sage named Vijn\u00e1nes'vara yogi here composed his celebrated bh\u00e1shya or commentary on the code called the Yajnavalkya Smriti.\n\n**Malurpatna.**\u2014A village on the right bank of the Kanva, about 3 miles south of Malur in Channapatna taluq. Population 1,078.\n\nIt contains a number of ruined temples and inscriptions of the Ganga and Chola periods. It was originally called Manal\u00far, but the Cholas gave it the name of Nikarili Cholapura. In 1764 Haidar Ali granted Malurpatna as an inam to a fakir.\n\n**Mankunda.**\u2014A village in the west of Channapatna taluq, about 2 miles north of Mudigere. Population 658.\n\nIn the 7th century the Ganga kings Bh\u00favikrama and S'\u00edvan\u00e1ra appear to have made this the royal residence, removing from Talak\u00e1d. The place was probably destroyed in the Chola invasion.\n\n**Manne.**\u2014A village in the north of Nelamangala taluq, about 5 miles north of Tyamagondlu. Population 702.\n\nUnder the name of M\u00e1nya pura it was a royal residence of the Ganga kings in the 8th century, in the time of S'\u00edripurusha. It was captured and destroyed by the Cholas at the beginning of the 11th century, and as Mannai-kattakam, is referred to in their inscriptions as one of their principal conquests. Several ruined temples attest its magnificence, and its extent is shown by the tradition that the city included Chik Hejjaji and Belavangala, 8 miles or more to the east.\n\n**Nelamangala.**\u2014A taluq in the west. Area 275 square miles. Head-quarters at Nelamangala. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n---\n\n1 The a, it should be observed, is short, which causes the name to sound like Motur.\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Nelamangala, 4,171; Tyamagondal, 3,748; Sondekoppa, 1,624; Hesarghatta, 1,051.\n\nThis taluq was formed out of the old parganas of Nelamangala, Doddabele and Nijagallu. It is drained on the east and south by the Arkavati, and on the west by the Kumadvati, an affluent of the former, both flowing southwards in deep and rocky channels. The Garudachala rises in the north-west and takes a northerly course into the Tumkur District. A chain of mountains runs through, and in some places bounds the taluq on the west, the chief heights being Sivaganga (4,559 feet above the sea) and Nijagal. The country on this side is hilly, broken and jungly. The other parts are open and contain some large valleys in which excellent tanks have been formed, one at Tyamagondal, fed by the Kumadvati, being the largest.\n\nThe soil is generally a red mould, shallow and gravelly, dependent for its cultivation on abundant and seasonable rains. The dry crops are chiefly ragi, ballar, sav\u00e9 and gram; the wet crops paddy, sugar-cane and some wheat. Iron ore is obtained in some parts.\n\nIn the 8th century Manne was a place of great importance, under the Gangas, and in the 11th century Mannai-nattu was still the chief district, under the Cholas. The Hoysalas soon after succeeded, and in the temporary partition of their territories in the 13th century this part of the country fell to the share of Ramanatha, who had the Tamil districts. After sharing in the fortunes of Dod-Ballapur and Bangalore, Nelamangala was apparently acquired by the Mysore Rajas at the same time as the latter place.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1878. The total revenue realized in 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,61,666, and in 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,66,280. The revenue realized from Government lands was thus apportioned:\u2014\nThe following was the average rainfall at Nelamangala for 25 years (1870-1894):\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0\u00b019 | 0\u00b033 | 0\u00b067 | 3\u00b029  | 2\u00b064| 2\u00b010 | 4\u00b028 | 3\u00b075 | 5\u00b002 | 1\u00b044 | 0\u00b049 | ...  | 24\u00b010 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Harihar railway runs through the northern half of the taluq, with stations at Golhalli, Dodbele and Nidvanda. The Bangalore-Tumkur road goes through Nelamangala and Sompur or Dobbspet, where it meets the road from Kolar via Dod-Ballapur. A short cross road connects Tyamagondal with both. The Hassan road branches off at Nelamangala to the south-west. There is also a road from Nelamangala to Dod-Ballapur, and a short one from Dobbspet to Sivaganga.\n\n**Nelamangala.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 6' N. lat., 77\u00b0 27' E. long., 16 miles north-west of Bangalore on the Bangalore-Tumkur road.

It is said to have been founded by Sumati, son of Hemachandra, king of Karnataka, whose capital was Yadupatna. Having succeeded in an expedition against a robber chief at Devaraydurga, he took up his residence at Bhumandana for the security of that part of his father's dominions. The actual history has been given above under the taluq. Nelamangala appears to have been transferred to the Mysore Rajas along with Tyamagondal at the time when Bangalore was\npurchased from the Mughal general Khasim Khan. This was in 1687.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 2,754) | ... | 1,132 | 2,201 | 2,470 | 2,259 |\n| Expenditure | ... | 1,443 | 2,953 | 2,315 | 3,727 |\n\n**Nellurpatna.**\u2014A ruined city 5 miles south-east of Devanhalli. It is stated to have been of great extent and ruled by a rich and powerful line of kings. In the time of the last of these, named Chauda Raya, the city was captured, after maintaining an obstinate defence for three years, during which the enemy was twice forced to raise the siege. Its fall was due to an act of treachery on the part of the king's daughter, who, being married to the chief of Gubbi in the Hoskote taluq, had accompanied her husband to the war, and made known the existence of the subterranean passage by which the city was supplied with water from a distance. Chauda Raya is said to have blown up his palace, containing his family and treasures, while the enemy were scaling the walls.\n\n**Nijagal.**\u2014A hill, also called S'\u00faragiri, in the north-west of the Nelamangala taluq, accessible only on the north and east. The fort which formerly occupied the summit owed its strength more to nature than to art, and was the scene of many desperate encounters. The p\u00e9te has been for many years almost deserted, the inhabitants having removed to Tyamagondal. The present population is 158.\n\n**Pennar.**\u2014See Pin\u00e1kini.\n\n**Pinakini.**\u2014The Southern or Dakshina Pin\u00e1kini, a river flowing through the eastern parts of the District. It is better known to European geographers as the Southern Penn\u00e1r. The continuous curve formed by the course of the N. and S. Pin\u00e1kini, which both rise near the hill of Nandi, sacred to Siva, may probably account for their receiving the name of Pin\u00e1kini, from pin\u00e1ka, the bow of Siva. This is the only designation by which the streams are known to the Kannada people; but it seems also to be called the Ponnaiy\u00e1r in the Tamil country.\n\nThe S. Pin\u00e1kini rises in the Chenna Kesava hill, east of Nandidroog. Its course, after entering the Bangalore District, is southwards through the Devanhalli and Hoskote taluqs, where it forms the Jangamkote and Hoskote tanks, the latter one of the largest sheets of water in the\n\n---\n\n1 It is also the ancient name in Tamil works, as appears from a stanza of the poetess Avvaiyar, in which the Pin\u00e1ka is given as the southern boundary of Tondamandalam.

Thence, turning eastwards, it makes its way through the Eastern Ghats near the town of Krishnagiri and, after traversing the Salem and South Arcot Districts of Madras, falls into the Bay of Bengal near Fort St. David, a few miles north of Cuddalore. The length of its entire course is 245 miles, of which about 50 miles from the source are in the Mysore. It is estimated that 85\u00b760 per cent. of the water of this portion is stored for agricultural purposes.\n\n**Ramgiri.**\u2014A picturesque hill, at one time fortified, on the left bank of the Arkavati, three miles north of Closepet. It formerly gave its name to the taluq, the town of Ramgiri being at its base. The place was captured by the British in 1791. On the foundation of Closepet the residents removed to the new settlement.\n\n**Sarjapur.**\u2014A town in the Anekal taluq, 12 miles north-east of the kasba, and a municipality. Till 1873 it was the head-quarters of a taluq of the same name.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 1,232 | 1,279   | 2,511 |\n| Muhammadans       | 265   | 241     | 506   |\n| **Total**         | **1,497** | **1,520** | **3,017** |\n\nA small fair is held on Sunday, visited by 100 people.\n\nCotton cloths, carpets and tape are made here in considerable quantities. Formerly it appears that muslins of fine quality were woven.\n\nSarjapur, with 18 other villages, was formerly a j\u00e1gir, held from the Mughals on condition of maintaining a military force for the service of the emperor. The j\u00e1gir was confirmed by successive rulers, as appears from some interesting sanads exhibited to me several years ago:\n\n(1) Grant in Persian, by Dil\u00e1var Khan, Subahdar of Sira, in the name of Alamg\u00edr, P\u00e1dsh\u00e1h i Gh\u00e1zi.\n\n(2) Grant in Mahratti, by M\u00e1dhava R\u00e1o, minister of the Peshwa.

It is 12 miles from Bangalore, and 3 miles south of Whitefield. Named after Dr. Sausman, now President of the Association. It originally contained 926 acres, but only 812 were occupied and the rest relinquished. In 1889 there were 45 families belonging to the settlement, of whom 25 were non-resident. The Report for 1895 says:\u2014\"The land is for the most part in the hands of the wealthier members of the community, and there are only six families that come within the term poor. The former are mostly absentee, but have agents to supervise the working of their farms and give employment to some of the poorer settlers. They have greatly improved their holdings by growing coffee, fruit-trees, casuarinas, &c. A dairy has been successfully started by one of them.\"\n\n**Savandurga.**\u2014A mountain in the Magadi taluq, 7 miles southeast of the kasba, and familiarly called the Magadi hill. It is an enormous mass of granite, rising to 4,024 feet above the level of the sea, and standing on a base eight miles in circumference. The summit consists of two peaks, separated by a chasm, each being independent of the other, and abundantly supplied with water. One is called the Kari or black peak, the other the Bili or white peak.\n\nThe hill appears to have been first fortified in 1543 by S\u00e1manta R\u00e1ya, the officer appointed to the charge of the Magadi district by Achyuta R\u00e1ya, the king of Vijayanagar. Taking advantage of the feebleness of the government, and relying no doubt on the natural strength of his position, he made himself independent, and took up his residence on the droog, with a force of 8,000 men, officered by 8 gurikars. He died in 1571 and was succeeded by his son Sampaja R\u00e1ya. He ruled for 17 years, and was followed by his son Chikka R\u00e1ya, who, after a rule of 16 years, threw himself in a fit of madness into the chasm and was drowned, leaving no issue. Ganga, the tal\u00e1ri, or watchman of Gudamarnhalli, seized the place and began plundering\nin order to enrich himself. But Immadi Kempe Gauda of Bangalore put him to death, secured the stronghold for his own family, and changed its name from S\u0101manta-durga to S\u0101vana-durga. He soon had need of the retreat, being driven out of Bangalore by the Bijapur army. His descendants held S\u0101vandurga till 1728, when Deva R\u0101ja, Dalavayi of Mysore, obtained possession and carried Mumma\u1e0di Kempe Gauda, the chief, prisoner to Seringapatam, where he ended his days, the last of his line. The name of Krishnar\u0101ja-giri then given to the droog has not survived. The memorable capture of S\u0101vandurga in 1791 by the British under Lord Cornwallis is thus described by Wilks:\n\n\"Colonel Stuart encamped within three miles of the place on the 10th of December, and immediately commenced the arduous labour of cutting a gun-road through the rugged forest to the foot of the rock, a work which, added to the difficulties of dragging iron twenty-four pounders over precipices nearly perpendicular, called for a degree of incessant exertion and fatigue which could scarcely have been exceeded.\n\nThe batteries opened on the 17th, and the breach in what was named the lower wall of the rock, although at least fifteen hundred feet higher than its base, was deemed practicable on the 20th. Immediately overlooking it, at a precipitous height, and perfectly well situated for destroying, by the usual artillery of rocks and stones, everything that should attempt to ascend beyond the breach, was a range of ancient wall. Lord Cornwallis had come from the camp, distant seven miles, to witness the assault; the grenadiers were ordered to their stations, and the garrison was seen to be collecting behind this wall. This observation fortunately prevented the assault on that day; the experiment was made of pointing with sufficient elevation by receiving the trail of the gun carriage into an excavation behind the platform. The execution was not only perfect, but the wall was found to be so frail that a few discharges must dislodge its defenders. The arrangements for the ensuing day were founded on the fact thus opportunely ascertained. The batteries were prepared for the purpose, and in the morning the requisite number of guns were directed against this wall with the most perfect success; every person behind it was dislodged, and the storming party, having been placed without observation within twenty yards of the breach, the assault commenced by signal at eleven o'clock in the forenoon.\n\nThe defenders had been so unexpectedly dislodged from their appointed positions that no new disposition had been made. The assailants accordingly ascended the rock without the slightest opposition, clambering up a precipice which, after the service was over, they were afraid to descend. The eastern citadel was completely carried; and the assailants, on reaching the summit of the rock, had the satisfaction to descry a heavy column of infantry, destined to reinforce the garrison, in full march to enter the place, which would have been effected if the assault had been postponed even for half an hour. A division of the assailants, after descending considerably above the breach, had been directed to turn to the right along a path which\nhad been observed to be practised by the garrison, leading along the side of the rock to the western citadel. The killedar of that citadel, observing the defenders of the eastern rock to be driven from their post above the breach, and the assailants to have begun climbing up, sallied with the view of taking them in flank, but was unexpectedly met among the rocks by the division described; and, at the same instant, a few well-directed shot from the batteries fell with great execution among his troops. He retreated in surprise and dismay, followed with great energy by the English troops. At this instant the assailants, who had gained the highest eminence of the eastern rock, obtained a distinct view of the pursuit; they observed the killedar to fall just as he approached the gate of his citadel, and the pursuers to enter with the fugitives. Everything was carried within one hour from the commencement of the assault; and an enterprise which had been contemplated by Lord Cornwallis as the most doubtful operation of the war, was thus effected in twelve days from the first arrival of the troops, and five of open batteries, including the day of assault, with a moderate amount of casualties in the previous operations, and in the assault itself his Lordship had not to regret the loss of a single life.\"\n\nSivaganga.\u2014A sacred hill in the north-west of the Nelamangala taluq, whose acute conical peak rises to a height of 4,559 feet above the level of the sea. On the east its outline is supposed to resemble a bull, on the west Ganesha, on the north a serpent, and on the south a linga. The number of steps leading to the top is said to equal the number of yojanas hence to Benares. The place is therefore called Dakshina K\u00e1si, and an ascent to the top is vicariously as meritorious as a pilgrimage to the holy city. The pur\u00e1na\u015b give it the name of Kakudgiri. Coming down to historical times, it is mentioned by its present name in the twelfth century as the place where Santala Devi died, the first queen of Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala line, and also as one of the distant points to which the Ling\u00e1yit faith, recently established by Basava, the minister of Bijjala, king of Kaly\u00e1na, had extended.\n\nThe northern face is occupied with numerous sacred buildings, many of which were erected at the expense of Kempe Gau\u1e0da, the chief of Magadi. The two principal temples, dedicated to Gang\u00e1dharesvara and Honna Devamma, are formed out of large natural caverns, the ascent to which is by an imposing flight of stone steps. There are eight springs or tirthas on the hill, one of which, contained in a deep and extremely narrow cleft of the rock, is named the P\u00e1t\u00e1la Ganga or Ganges of the lower regions. The level of the water in this is said to rise several feet during the hot season and to sink during the rains, an effect due to natural causes, but regarded as miraculous. On the eastern face is a Ling\u00e1yit establishment called the R\u00e1cho\u1e6di m\u0101\u1e6dh. The\nremaining sides are covered with low jungle, in which and in the caves around bears and other wild animals may be met with. At the extreme summit are two pillars, from beneath one of which about a quart of water oozes on the day of the winter solstice or *makara-sankranti*. The attendant priests receive the tiny stream in a vessel, and devoting half to the god, convey the other half to the palace at Mysore.\n\nThe village of Sivaganga is at the northern base of the hill. Population 535. The houses are entirely of stone and form a single street through which the car is drawn at religious festivals. At the entrance to the village is a lofty towered gateway. The math having become involved in great pecuniary difficulties, the revenues of the religious endowments are, on the wish of the g\u00faru, being managed by the Muzrai department.\n\n*Sivan-giri.*\u2014A fortified hill near Closepet, on the right bank of the Arkavati, opposite to Ramgiri. It surrendered to the British in 1791 without much resistance.\n\n*Sulibele.*\u2014A village in the north of Hoskote taluq, head-quarters of the h\u00f3bli of the same name, and a municipality. Population 1,927.\n\nThis part of the country in the 10th century was in the hands of the Nolambas, and subsequently of the Cholas. In modern times, under Vijayanagar, it was part of the province belonging to the Sugatur family.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 459) | 897     | 908     | 971     | 994     |\n| Expenditure      | 496     | 875     | 928     | 1,437   |\n\n*Tirumale.*\u2014A village 2 miles east of Magadi, and included in it.

Population 112.\n\nIt is in no way remarkable but for an old temple of Vallabhar\u00e1ya-swami, which is a favourite resort for native wedding parties from Bangalore.\n\n**Whitefield.**\u2014The principal of the Eurasian and Anglo-Indian settlements in the east of the Bangalore taluq; named after Mr. D. S. White, the founder of the original Association in Madras. It is 2 miles south of the railway station of the same name (formerly called Kadgodi station) and 12 miles east of Bangalore.\n\nThe Eurasian and Anglo-Indian Association in Mysore (numbering 213 members in 1895) was formed in November 1879, for the purpose of co-operation among the members in improving the condition of families belonging to those communities. This object was to be attained by promoting industrial and agricultural pursuits among them.\nA boot and shoe factory was started, and as long as it was open proved successful; arrangements were also made for apprenticeship to other trades; and an Art and Industrial Institute was in view, where poor women and girls could be employed in needlework and fancy work, and in making Indian condiments and jams. But the main reliance was on the land scheme, which aimed at the formation of agricultural settlements or colonies. The Mysore Government readily lent its aid by a grant in July 1881 of nearly 4,000 acres of land, selected by the Association, to be held free of assessment for the first five years. With the help of Sir James Gordon, special sanction was obtained for holding a lottery in order to raise funds for starting the scheme. One lakh was thus obtained, but half of it was allotted for prizes. The original intention was to establish four colonies, as follows:\n\nGlen Gordon \\(^1\\) ... ... 527 acres \\{ In the Sri Gandha Kaval, 8 miles west of Haldwell Green ... ... 757 ,, \\} Bangalore, on the Magadi road. Whitefield ... ... 542 ,, \\} 12 miles east of Bangalore, as above Sausmond ... ... 926 ,, \\} described.\n\nBut this was found to be more than the Association could accomplish. They therefore, in July 1883, relinquished the lands of the Kaval and also the outlying lands of Sausmond, the Mysore Government having sanctioned their giving up any of the lands either absolutely or in favour of any specified individual or individuals. The terms on which the lands retained were held were further modified in November 1884 in the following manner:\u2014No assessment was to be levied on village sites, and on land set apart for common pasturage. On the rest, the assessment was remitted for 3 years more; half rates to be levied in the 4th year, and full rates thereafter.\n\nWhitefield in 1889 contained 25 families, of whom 6 were non-resident. In 1894, in accordance with the wishes of the settlers, the Association transferred its right of occupancy to them, so that they became the registered tenants and paid their assessment direct to Government, but as members of the Association they are bound by its rules as to the disposal of the land.\\(^2\\) The report for 1895 gives the number of permanent residents at that time as 115. From it is also gathered the following information:\u2014Whitefield now embraces two plots of land, the larger being the grant made by the Mysore Government to the Association, and the smaller consisting of the lands of Pattandur, leased by the late Mr. White from the Jodidar.\n\n\\(^1\\) The first was named after Sir James Gordon, and the second after a prominent member of the Association.\n\n\\(^2\\) Claims to control on the part of the Madras Association have led to serious dissensions, but these it is believed are now at an end.\nThe number of landowners in Whitefield proper is 26, but all the available holdings have been taken up and there is no room left for expansion in this direction, but land can be had in Pattandur from Mrs. White. The number of houses built on the farms is 14, and cottages on the village site 12. There are 8 houses in Pattandur, also a Roman Catholic chapel and parsonage. In Whitefield there is a Protestant church, where Church of England and Dissenting services are regularly held alternately, and a parsonage is under erection. There is a good school, with 31 pupils, aided and inspected by Government. Room is also provided for the residence of the Head-Master and his wife, who assists him in teaching. The Association has also established a Family Benefit Fund, and offers various prizes and scholarships for promoting education and athletic sports.\n\nYelahanka.\u2014A town 10 miles north of Bangalore, on the railway to Guntakal and on the Bangalore-Chikballapur road; a municipality. Till 1871 it was the head-quarters of a taluq of the same name.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 1,208 | 1,284   | 2,492 |\n| Muhammadans       | 90    | 78      | 168   |\n| Christians        | 4     | 4       | 8     |\n| Total             | 1,302 | 1,366   | 2,668 |\n\nYelahanka is historically interesting as being one of the oldest places in the District. As Ilaip\u00e1kka under the Cholas, and Elahakka under the Hoysalas, it gave its name to all the surrounding country. It was the first possession of Jaya Gau\u1e0da, the progenitor of the Kempe Gau\u1e0da line of chiefs, who founded Bangalore and subsequently became identified with Magadi and Savandurga. Jaya Gau\u1e0da obtained the title of Yelakanka Nad Prabhu in about 1420, and the place remained in possession of his family for 230 years, when it was captured by the Mysore Raja.\n\nA car festival held for 10 days from Chaitra suddha 8th in honour of Venugopala is attended by 2,000 people.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892\u20133 | 1893\u20134 | 1894\u20135 | 1895\u20136 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income (opening balance Rs. 413) | 502    | 527    | 1,049  | 1,249  |\n| Expenditure     | 1,443  | 452    | 1,082  | 2,010  |\n\n1 The form Yelahanka probably arose from the old Prakrit custom of indicating a duplicated consonant by a round dot, like that used to express a nasal, for which latter purpose it is now exclusively employed.\nKOLAR DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014A District in the east of Mysore, situated between 12\u00b0 48' and 13\u00b0 57' north latitude and 77\u00b0 26' and 78\u00b0 39' east longitude. Its greatest length is from north to south, about 85 miles, but from east to west an equal distance may be measured between the furthest points.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 3,168 square miles.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014The Bangalore and Tumkur Districts bound it on the west. On all other sides it is surrounded by Districts of the Madras Presidency, having Anantapur on the north, Kadapa and North Arcot on the east, and Salem on the south.\n\nDivisions.\u2014The Chik Ballapur Sub-Division was formed in November 1891, comprising the Chik Rallapur, Goribidnur and Bagepalli taluqs. The District contains the following taluqs, Gudibanda being a sub-taluq of Bagepalli.\n\n| No. | Taluq       | Area in square miles | No. of Hoblis | No. of Villages or Towns | Population |\n|-----|-------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|\n| 1   | Bagepalli   | 447                  | 8             | 374                      | 58,086     |\n| 2   | Bowringpet  | 335                  | 7             | 444                      | 71,042     |\n| 3   | Chik Ballapur| 250                 | 5             | 272                      | 51,502     |\n| 4   | Chintamani  | 503                  | 6             | 326                      | 49,888     |\n| 5   | Goribidnur  | 341                  | 7             | 272                      | 71,990     |\n| 6   | Kolar       | 299                  | 6             | 332                      | 72,543     |\n| 7   | Malur       | 260                  | 6             | 424                      | 54,180     |\n| 8   | Mullagal    | 361                  | 6             | 355                      | 56,269     |\n| 9   | Sidlaghatta | 363                  | 6             | 350                      | 58,977     |\n| 10  | Srinivaspur |                     | 7             | 329                      | 46,463     |\n|     | Total       | 3,168                | 64            | 3,478                    | 591,030    |\n\nPhysical Features.\u2014The District occupies that portion of the Mysore table-land immediately bordering on the Eastern Ghats. But the frontier touches the Ghats only in the north-east and south; between those points it recedes from the range to a mean distance of 15 miles.\n\nThe chief watershed lies in the north-west, in and around Nandidroog, the height of which is 4,851 feet above the sea. The streams which spring from this elevated region, said to be the birthplace of seven\n\n1 Included in Chintamani.\nrivers, radiate in all directions, receiving the drainage of the intermediate tracts of country. The Arkavati and Northern Pin\u00e1kini (or Penn\u00e1r), rising to the west of Nandidroog, flow one to the south and the other to the north; the Chitravati and P\u00e1paghni rise in the north and have a north-easterly course: the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and Southern Pin\u00e1kini (or Penn\u00e1r) springing from the eastern side, run eastward and southward respectively. Of these several streams the Arkavati and most of the S. Pin\u00e1kini belong to the Bangalore District. The main part of the Kolar District comprises the head of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r river system on the south and that of the N. Pin\u00e1kini on the north, separated by an imaginary line from Chik-Ballapur to S'rinivasapur.\n\nThe principal chain of mountains runs north from Nandidroog, the highest point, through Gudibanda, as far as Penugonda and Dharmavaram in the Anantapur District. More or less parallel with the Nandidroog range, and from 30 to 40 miles to the east of it, is a line of hills entering the District due north of Gumnavayanpalya, and separating the valleys of the Chitravati and P\u00e1paghni. At the frontier the range is known as the Dongala or Dokkala-konda. After a considerable interval it reappears in the isolated peaks of Murugamale, Ambajidurga (4,399 feet) and Rahmandurga (4,227 feet). Thence, forming the chain of hills to the west of the town of Kolar (highest point 4,026 feet), it is continued in the Vokkaleri and Tyakal hills to the south.\n\nA third line of low hills, represented in places merely by mounds or rising ground, commences near S'rinivasapur, and, preserving the same general direction as the former, passes to the east of Kolar, and extends through the southernmost parts of the Bowringpet taluq to Kangundi, Kuppam and the Ghats.\n\nThe hills still more to the east incline in some places to a circular arrangement, enclosing elevated valleys which are occupied by villages. This configuration appears at Mudimadagu and Sunnakal.\n\nThe central and eastern parts of the District, forming the valley of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r, are undulating and well cultivated, the general level varying between 2,786 feet at Kolar, 2,970 feet at Malur, and 2,989 feet at the foot of Ambajidurga. A considerable depression occurs in the valley of the N. Pin\u00e1kini towards Goribidnur, the height of Hindupur just beyond the boundary being only 2,068 feet, and of Penugonda 1,677 feet. The outlying districts along the northern frontier mark with alternate rise and fall the descent to the level of the Anantapur country. On the east, the Mugli and Naikaneri passes to the plains of the so-called Carnatic are some distance beyond the boundary.\n\n**Tanks.**\u2014In no District has the tank system been more fully developed, as none offered equal facilities for the purpose. The entire\nwater of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r is intercepted for purposes of irrigation, while of the N. Pin\u00e1kini and its affluents upwards of 85 per cent. of the drainage is similarly utilized. The series of tanks form a marked feature in the landscape when surveyed from a height, as from Nandidroog, whence 400 can be readily counted. The total number for the District is 5,497, covering an area of upwards of 120,000 acres.\n\nThe P\u00e1l\u00e1r chain of tanks consists of the Som\u00e1mbudhi, Jannagatta, Mudvadi, Chillapalli, Manigatta, Holali, Betamangala, and R\u00e1ms\u00e1gars tanks, which are at a mean distance of four or five miles from each other, extending through the Kolar and Bowringpet taluqs. The Kolar, Nangali and Kurubur tanks are also connected with the same system. The largest of the above and in the whole District is the R\u00e1ms\u00e1gar. The particulars given below show the capacity and dimensions of some principal tanks of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r system. To these may be added the tanks of the S'rinivasapur sub-taluq, namely, the Bagavadu, irrigating 663 acres, the Ronur 280 acres, the Kolatur 150 acres, and the Lakshmansagar 226 acres.\n\n| Name of tank | Embankment | No. of Sluices | No. of acres irrigated |\n|--------------|------------|----------------|-----------------------|\n|              | Length     | Height         | Depth                |\n|              |            |                | At base | At top |                  |\n| R\u00e1ms\u00e1gar     | ft. 1,500  | 45             | 150     | 18     | 4                 | 1,500 |\n| Betamangala  | 4,152      | 24             | .89     | 12     | 2                 | 700   |\n| Somambudhi   | 5,475      | 18             | 74      | 10     | 3                 | 1,500 |\n| Kolar        | 6,000      | 18             | 90      | 10     |                   | 800   |\n| Nangali      | 4,272      | 21             | 50      | 8      |                   | 1,112 |\n| Kurubur      | 3,732      | 20             | 70      | 9      |                   | 450   |\n\nThe head waters of the S. Pin\u00e1kini form the Kandavara and Gopalkrishna tanks at Chik-Ballapur, irrigating 625 and 715 acres, and Kata-machanhalli tank, lower down in the same taluq, irrigating 540 acres. The surplus waters of the Gopalkrishna tank feed the Ammankere and Bell\u00fatikere, two large tanks at Sidlaghatta, irrigating 350 acres each. The Bhadrana tank irrigates 1,600 acres.\n\nThe N. Pin\u00e1kini and its affluents the Chitravati and P\u00e1paghni supply many important tanks. Of these the Bairasagar at Gudibanda is one of the largest in the District. Others are the Vatadahoshalli, a very deep tank north-west of Gudibanda, formed by embarking a gorge between two chains of hills; two tanks at Hudugur, irrigating 434 and 408 acres, one at Nagaragere, irrigating 391 acres, and one at Namagondlu, irrigating 376 acres, all in the same taluq. South-west of\nGoribidnur is the Purnasagara tank, irrigating 250 acres. The tank at Periasandra, formed by the Chitravati, irrigates 256 acres.\n\n| Name of tank       | Embankment | No. of Sluices | No. of acres irrigated |\n|--------------------|------------|----------------|------------------------|\n|                    | Length     | Height         | Depth                  |                      |\n|                    |            |                | At base    | At top   |          |                        |\n| Bairsagar          | ft. 4,032  | 27             | 94         | 18       | 5        | 1,100                  |\n| Vatadahoshalli     | 1,923      | 51             | 185        | 6        | 2        | 1,500                  |\n| Srinivasa-sagara   | 2,100      | 40             | 117        | 20       | 3        | 1,200                  |\n| Venkata-sagara     | 1,293      | 42             | 110        | 20       | 2        | 990                    |\n\n**Channels.**\u2014In addition to the numerous tanks of the District, a few small channels are drawn from the N. Pin\u00e1kini in Goribidnur taluq, and from the Chitravati near Bagepalli in Bagepalli taluq. Some anicuts built across streams and large water-courses in the Chik-Ballapur, Gudibanda, Bagepalli, and Sidlaghatta taluqs, also supply water for a good deal of cultivation.\n\n**Rocks.**\u2014The rocks of the District are for the most part similar to those of the adjoining District of Bangalore, being composed of gneiss, but with a smaller admixture of mica, and a paler felspar. The low hills previously referred to, which cross the course of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and run south through the Bowringpet taluq, are composed of a soft ferruginous clay slate. They are flat at their tops and mostly barren, with a soil about them of fine argillaceous red earth. Gold has long been found close to the surface near these hills in considerable quantities, either mixed with the soil or interspersed in quartzy stones. It almost invariably occurs either in thin veins or disseminated in grains in the veins and beds of quartz, associated with iron ore, and sometimes with platinum. Mining operations were also carried on from a remote period by the natives of Mysore, but had long been abandoned by them. Deep mining by Europeans has now established here the most valuable gold mines in India.\n\n**Soils.**\u2014The soil on the high grounds is red and gravelly, with very often rocks of gneiss or granite, of little cohesion, appearing on its surface. The lower parts of these high grounds are intersected by nullahs or deep ravines, torn up by the torrents of water precipitated from the heights in the rainy season. The tops of the ridges are usually very barren, producing nothing but a small jungle. The soil in the valleys is a good and loamy mixture, formed of the finer particles of the decomposed rocks, washed down and deposited during the rains.\nOn the first ascent from the valley the soil is of a middling quality, suited for dry grains, and is a mixture of loam, sand and oxide of iron, with a portion of vegetable and animal matter. Higher up, towards the top of the ridge, a silicous sand prevails in the soil, which is on that account adapted only for horse-gram. Below the superficial soil there is commonly a bed of gravel, which immediately covers a gneissic or granitic rock, very often in a state of disintegration considerably advanced.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate does not differ materially from that of the Bangalore District. So far as reliance can be placed on the register of observations, the mean temperature at Kolar is about $80^\\circ5$\u00b0 of Fahrenheit. The average rainfall, on the other hand, is considerably less, being only from 29 to 30 inches. This is doubtless due to the influence of the mountain ranges running through the west of this and the Bangalore District, which intercept much of the rain brought by the monsoon from the south-west quarter. So that this District is mainly dependent on the north-east monsoon. The description given in the preceding paragraphs will show, however, the abundance of the water supply with which the District is, notwithstanding, enriched.\n\nIt is generally a healthy country, remarkably so in the neighbourhoods of Chik-Ballapur and Kolar, which are probably not surpassed in that respect by any other parts of the Province. Kolar and the towns east and south of it were formerly much visited with cholera and other epidemics, originating among the crowds of travellers continually passing through the Ghats to and from Madras and the large towns of the Carnatic, more especially among bands of pilgrims to the shrine of Tirupati. The diversion of this passenger traffic to the railway, and the successful carrying out of sanatory operations by the municipal boards, have almost freed that portion of the District from the scourge of diseases for the prevalence of which it was at one time notorious. But the recent influx of labourers from so many different parts to the gold mines has led to outbreaks of cholera among them from time to time.\n\nTemperature.\u2014From the accompanying table, compiled as well as the data allowed from observations taken at Kolar in 1873 and 1874, it appears that a maximum heat of $94^\\circ$\u00b0 and $95^\\circ$\u00b0 was experienced in April and May respectively. The minimum temperature was $57^\\circ$, registered in February; during January and March it reached $59^\\circ$\u00b0.\n\n---\n\n1 No more recent registers are procurable.\nThe extreme annual range of the thermometer was 38\u00b0. The means of maximum and minimum temperature were 83.08 and 67.16, giving a general average of 75.12.\n\nRainfall.\u2014The rainfall at Kolar shows an annual average of 29.24 inches, based upon the observations for 25 years (1870-94). The register by months is given under each taluq. The average annual rate for the 25 years at other taluq stations was as in the margin.\n\nThe actual annual fall at Kolar has been registered as follows:\n\n| Year | Rainfall |\n|------|----------|\n| 1868 | 47.65    |\n| 1869 | 36.00    |\n| 1870 | 18.64    |\n| 1871 | 22.45    |\n| 1872 | 26.48    |\n| 1873 | 25.12    |\n| 1874 | 37.66    |\n| 1875 | 16.52    |\n| 1876 | 12.19    |\n| 1877 | 32.63    |\n| 1878 | 42.80    |\n| 1879 | 26.49    |\n| 1880 | 30.40    |\n| 1881 | 36.00    |\n| 1882 | 33.09    |\n| 1883 | 41.56    |\n| 1884 | 23.73    |\n| 1885 | 25.60    |\n| 1886 |          |\n| 1887 |          |\n| 1888 |          |\n| 1889 |          |\n| 1890 |          |\n| 1891 |          |\n| 1892 |          |\n| 1893 |          |\n| 1894 |          |\n\nOut of the 27 years the average has been exceeded in 15. In only 4 years has the fall been less than 20 inches, and in 4 it has been above 40.\n\nVegetation.\u2014The only forest containing trees of large growth is in the neighbourhood of Nandidroog. On several of the hills in the District the soil is a shallow blackish vegetable mould lying on rock, and though trees and bushes grow abundantly they never attain any size. In the northern taluqs near Gummayakanpalya and Gudibanda the hills are very barren, and produce only stunted bushes of bandrike, tangadi, dodon\u00e6a, barleria, small devadari (*sethia indica*), beppale (*wrightia tinctoria*), and a few bushes of *butea frondosa* and *cassia fistula*. In portions of these taluqs wild tamarinds are abundant, and in the plains are topes of mango, mohwah or ippe, and tamarinds. The reserved forest of 142\u00bd square miles in the Narasimhadeva hill consists principally of bamboos and stunted *dindiga* trees.\n\nThe hills in the south-east corner of the Bowringpet taluq are covered with a profuse but small growth of various common fuel trees, among which tamarinds are not uncommon. In the Chik-Ballapur taluq the babul and topal (*acacia leucophloea*) grow freely, and near Nandidroog there is much j\u00e1l\u00e1ri (lac tree), chiefly in the west and south-west of the hill. The vegetation up to the fort walls is frequently dense, but of no size. Within the enclosure are several fine champakas, and the growth of all trees is better. Acacias are also common in groves in Kolar, Mulbagal, Sidlaghatta, and Srinivasapur. In this last-named sub-taluq\nis a jungle, covering in all perhaps some 11 square miles, besides the R\u00e1yalp\u00e1d forest of over 34 square miles. At the bases and on the lower slopes of the R\u00e1yalp\u00e1d hills the scrub is of a superior description, several bushes of *cassia auriculata* running up to six and seven feet in height. The trees hereabouts average 20 feet; they consist chiefly of pach\u00e1ri, cheninge, naval\u00e1di, small d\u00e9vad\u00e1ri, huluv\u00e9, yenne maddi, ral\u00e9, wild tamarind, j\u00e1l\u00e1ri, a few shisham, and a few k\u00e1rachi, while high up on the Mudimadagu hill is some bad teak. Near the top of this hill, and all round and about the large Sunnakal hill, bamboos are abundant, also j\u00e1l\u00e1ri or lac trees.\n\nIn the M\u00e1lur taluq there are fewer trees, and the uncultivated plains are covered with the ordinary scrub, mixed with euphorbias, which are also common in the Kolar taluq. Many villages in parts of this District are surrounded with stout and high hedges, in which banyans and bhair (*zizyphus jujuba*) trees are common and well grown. Cocoa-nut trees are principally cultivated in the Mulbagal and Goribidnur taluqs, and areca in the latter. Near Mudav\u00e1di in Kolar taluq, there are good fuel tracts, which, as well as the Kolar hills, supply the town of Kolar with firewood. The sandal is scarce, but attempts have been made to propagate it in the Nandi forest.\n\nBesides the *State forests* reserved at Nandi, Narasinhadeva-betta, and R\u00e1yalp\u00e1d, already mentioned, there are the Agara jungles of 15 square miles in Mulbagal taluq, the Kamsandra jungles of 26 square miles in Bowringpet taluq, and the Valsebeta forest of $4\\frac{1}{4}$ square miles in Goribidnur taluq.\n\nThere are also 32 plantations under the Forest department, covering an area of $16\\frac{1}{4}$ square miles, and 10 plantations under the Revenue department, occupying a little more than 3 square miles.

None of the forests in the District yield good timber trees of any size. Babul and toppal grow freely, and the former is here considered durable timber, being used for buildings and carts. The District is rich in honge trees (*pongamia glabra*), which grow more luxuriantly here than in other parts of the State. They are most useful to the ryots; the leaves and flowers being excellent manure for rice fields, the seeds yielding oil for lamps, and the wood being used for fuel.\n\nThe planting of avenues along the public roads and of village topes has been successfully carried out. Up to the 30th of June 1893 there were 490 miles planted with avenues, and 8,087 acres occupied with groves containing 382,699 trees, all planted by the ryots.\n\n**Agricultural Produce.**\u2014The cultivated products are similar to those of the Bangalore District, but owing to the large number of tanks there is a greater proportion of wet and garden cultivation. Potatoes are extensively cultivated in the rich valleys of Chik-Ballapur and Sidlaghatta taluqs. Poppy cultivation, now prohibited, was formerly a source of great profit to the ryots. A little coffee is grown at Nandidroog, and mulberry in the Chik-Ballapur, Sidlaghatta, and Kolar taluqs.\n\nThe number of acres cultivated with rice in 1893 was 40,476, wheat 69, other food grains 322,906, oil seeds 11,508, sugar-cane 7,492, fibres 60, tobacco 826, vegetables 27,032, mulberry 1,751.\n\nThe kinds of rice grown in the district are *dodda baira*, *gidda baira*, *dodda kembatti*, *sanna kembatti*, *arsina kembatti*, *gutti sanna*, *bili sanna*, *sukad\u00e1s*, *punagar\u00e1j*, *yalakki bhatta*, *putta bhatta*, *t\u00f3ka nellu*, *kari t\u00f3ka nellu*, and *gandhasale*.\n\nThe following list shows the quantity and value of each article of produce raised in the District, and the quantity and value exported:\n\n| Name | Produced | Exported

A few bears are met with in the Mekal-naikanpalya and Budikota jungles; cheetahs and wild boar in the Nandidroog, Mudimadagu, Sunnakal and Dokkal-konda hill ranges. Unfrequented parts of the District, where there is shelter, are the resorts of hyenas, jackals, antelopes, porcupines, and hares. The mongoose and other small animals find protection in the thick hedges around villages.\n\n**Birds.**\u2014The wild birds are similar to those of the Bangalore\nDistrict. A large kind of vulture takes shelter and breeds on the almost inaccessible top of Worlakonda, a large hill between Peresandra and Gudibanda.\n\nFish are stated to be not so plentiful as the number of streams and tanks would lead one to expect, but large fish are found in the Betamangala and Ramasagara tanks.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014The indigenous bulls of the district are of a diminutive breed. Large-sized ones are imported by ryots from the woodlands and jungles on the Madras frontier, and reared either for local use or for sale at places below the Ghats. Buffaloes are generally met with throughout the District as well as sheep and goats. Gunnavayanpalya is noted for a superior breed of sheep, sold at moderate prices.\n\nLarge cattle fairs are held at Nandi, Vanarasi, Vokkaleri, and Avani, as well as at the Gh\u0101\u1e6di Subrahmanya festival on the Goribidnur-Doddballapur border, mentioned in connection with the Bangalore District. The fair at Nandi is held for 15 days from Sivar\u0101tri, on the occasion of the Nandisvara car-festival. It is attended by 20,000 people, and 10,000 bullocks are brought for sale. The V\u0101nar\u0101si fair is held for 15 days in April, in honour of Iralappa, and is visited by 5,000 people. No less than 10,000 bullocks are brought to the market. The fair at Avani is in honour of R\u0101mal\u012bnga. It lasts for 10 days from Sivar\u0101tri, and attracts a concourse of 10,000 people with 20,000 bullocks.\n\nCattle shows instituted by Government were at one time held at Nandi, in connection with the festival above mentioned, at which bulls and bullocks from all the surrounding country are brought together, and thousands of animals change owners. Colonel Pearse, describing the show of 1872, says: 'I rode over the whole of the ground where the cattle were picketed, and the lowest computation was that quite 10,000 head were assembled, many of them remarkable for power, symmetry, and good hard condition, with the fine bold spirited look of the old Amrit Mahal breed specially apparent; and as on this occasion no false and mischievous rumours were spread tending to alarm the ryots and lead to a misunderstanding regarding the intentions of Government, the very cream of these cattle was produced at the show ground on the evening of the 12th of March. The bulls were very fine, and some of the bullocks were truly magnificent animals. Selection was not only a work of time but a really difficult task. Quite 500 pairs were brought into the enclosure, and the value placed on some by the owners was very high, the asking price for one pair being Rs. 800. The spirit of competition was most gratifying, and no owners in any part of the world could have been more eager to attract attention than the ryots\nat the Nandi Cattle Show. This show was exclusively composed of cattle from the Bangalore and Kolar Districts.'\n\nPoultry.\u2014The town of Kolar and the villages adjacent to it are noted for turkeys, which are reared in large numbers for export to Bangalore, Bellary, and other places.\n\nHISTORY\n\nOn tracing back the history of the District the usual legends are encountered. These are associated principally with Avani in the Mulbagal taluq, which is identified with Avantika-kshetra, one of the ten chief sacred places in India. Here Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana, it is said, lived, and here Rama remained for some time on his way back to Ayodhya after the conquest of Lanka. Hither, too, Sita retired on being rejected by her husband, and, under the protection of the sage Valmiki, gave birth to her twin sons Kusa and Lava, to whom he became the preceptor.\n\nThe hills to the west of Kolar, called the Satasringa parvata or hundred peaked mountains, are also made the scene of the story of Renuka and Parasu Rama, and there the latter is said to have revenged upon Kartaviryarjuna the murder of his father Jamadagni, committed in order to obtain possession of Surabhi, the cow of plenty. The koliha or \"shouting\" consequent on this feat is represented to have given the town its name, since shortened into Kolar.\n\nAt both places the Pandavas are stated to have lived in the course of their wanderings: Kaivara is said to be Ekachakrapura, and Sadali is said to have been founded by Sahadeva, the youngest of the brothers. At Kudumale the gods are said to have mustered their forces previous to assaulting the mythical city of Tripura.\n\nMahavalis.\u2014From inscriptions it may be gathered that the Mahavali or Bana kings were in possession of the country east of the Palur river early in the Christian era. Traces of them are found throughout the Mulbagal and Chintamani taluqs, as well as in Bowringpet taluq.\n\nGangas.\u2014In about the second century the Gangas either founded or became masters of Kolar, from which, as long as their dynasty was in power, or for nearly a thousand years, they took the title Kuvalaya-puravaresvara. The narrative of their migration to this place is given in Vol. I., p. 311. But, as there stated (p. 316), among the Kalinga Ganga inscriptions, one of 1118, from Vizagapatam, contains a very full and circumstantial account connected with Kolar. According to it.\nG\u00e1ngeya, the progenitor of the line, was succeeded by the following eighteen kings:\n\n| Virochana | Saur\u00e1nga | Jayasena (II) |\n|-----------|----------|---------------|\n| Samvedya  | Chitr\u00e1mbara | Jitavirya     |\n| Samvedin  | S\u00e1radhvaja | Vrishadhvaja |\n| Dattasena | Dh\u00e1rma (Dhammeba) | Pragalbha (Pragarbba) |\n| Soma      | Parikshit | Kol\u00e1hala     |\n| Ams\u2019udatta | Jayasena | Virochana (II) |\n\nKol\u00e1hala, the last but one of these, it says, \u201cbuilt the city named Kol\u00e1hala, in the great Gangav\u00e1di vishaya.\u201d After eighty kings (not named), in succession to Virochana (II), had enjoyed the city of Kol\u00e1hala, there arose Virasimha, who had five sons,\u2014K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava, D\u00e1n\u00e1rnava, Gun\u00e1rnava, M\u00e1rasimha and Vajrahasta. The first of these, giving over his own territory to his paternal uncle (not named), set out with his brothers to Kalinga, where he founded a new Ganga dynasty. As grants have lately been discovered in the names of some of these kings, it may be well to give the list, with the number of years each is said to have ruled (see Ep. Ind., iv., 186).\n\n| K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava I | ... | 36 | Jit\u00e1nkus\u2019a\u00b9 | ... | 15 | Gundama II | ... | 3 |\n| D\u00e1n\u00e1rnava... | ... | 40 | Kalig\u00e1l\u00e1nkus\u2019a | ... | 12 | Madhu K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava VI | ... | 19 |\n| K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava II | ... | 50 | Gundama I | ... | 7 | Vajrahasta V | ... | 30 |\n| Ran\u00e1rnava... | ... | 5 | K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava IV | ... | 3 | (crowned in 1038) |\n| Vajrahasta II | ... | 15 | Vinay\u00e1ditya | ... | 3 | R\u00e1jar\u00e1ja | ... | 8 |\n| K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava III | ... | 19 | Vajrahasta IV | ... | 35 | Chola Ganga (crowned in 1078) |\n| Gun\u00e1rnava | ... | 27 | K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava V | ... | \u00bd |\n\nWhatever truth there may be in this account, it is undoubted that the Gangas of Mysore came into conflict with the B\u00e1anas from the first, and occupied nearly all the District down to the eleventh century.\n\n**Pallavas.**\u2014Their principal rivals in the east, however, were the Pallavas of Kanchi, who in general ruled over the tracts east of a line from about Goribidnur, through Nandi, to Avani and Hunkunda. The Gangaru Thousand was an important province in this region.\n\n**Vaidumbas.**\u2014Of these kings occasional inscriptions are found in Chintamani and Bagepalli taluqs.\n\n**Cholas.**\u2014There is a traditional account of the foundation of Kolar to the following effect. A herdsman named Kola discovered a hidden treasure, which the king Uttama Chola hearing of, sent for him to Kanchi the capital, and being warned in a vision by Renuka in the form of Kol\u00e1halamma, erected a temple in her honour, founded the city of Kol\u00e1hala, and invested Kola with the government. The name\n\n\u00b9 Instead of this and the following name, two grants have Vajrahasta III, 40 (or 44), while Gundama is said to have ruled 3 years, and K\u00e1m\u00e1rnava IV, 35. Vajrahasta V is also given 33 years.\nis with equal probability derived from *Kola hala*, Kola\u2019s plough, the implement which turned up the treasure. Be this as it may, the hoblis of Yerkalve, Mulbagal, Murgamale, and Betamangala were annexed to the new settlement, in the enjoyment of which Kola and his descendants continued under the Chola dynasty. Of that line Vira Chola, Vikrama Chola, and Raja Narendra Chola are stated to have erected sh\u00e1sanas at Siti betta, Avani, Mulbagal, and other places in the vicinity.\n\nThis tradition is evidently based on some confused reminiscence of certain names and historical events. From the records of the period we know that the Cholas subverted the power of the Gangas by the capture of Talak\u00e1d in about 1004, and speedily possessed themselves of all the south and east of Mysore. The important city of Kol\u00e1hala, or Kolar, thus became subject to them, together with the whole of the present Kolar District. In accordance with their usual system, they gave the name of Nikarilichola-mandala to the District, and formed it into sub-divisions, of which Jayamkondachola-valan\u00e1d was towards the south.\n\nAt a later period we find a family of Chola-Gangas ruling over the parts around Kolar, of whom, in the thirteenth century, we have the names of Uttama Chola-Ganga, Vikrama Chola-Ganga and others.\n\n**Hoysalas.**\u2014But before this, or in about 1117, the Hoysalas under Vishnuvardhana captured Talak\u00e1d, and drove out the Cholas from Mysore. Kol\u00e1la is specially mentioned among the conquests of this king, and the lower ghat of Nangali is specified as the eastern boundary of his kingdom. On the death of Somesvara, in 1254, a partition of the Hoysala dominions took place between his two sons, and the Kolar District was included in the Tamil provinces, which fell to the share of R\u00e1man\u00e1tha. In the next reign the kingdom was again united under Ball\u00e1la III., but the ancestral capital of Dorasamudra or Haleb\u00eddu having been destroyed by the Musalman invaders in 1326, we find him residing, among other places, at Hosav\u00eddu (the new capital), now Hosur in Goribidnur taluq.\n\n**Vijayanagar.**\u2014The empire of Vijayanagar was founded in the fourteenth century, and Bukka R\u00e1ya I. made the same place, called Hosapa\u1e6d\u1e6dana, his residence for a time, and it may have been then the eastern boundary of the kingdom. Under Deva R\u00e1ya it appears that Mulbagal was the principal place in the District, and in the fifteenth century we find two brothers, Lakhana Dan\u00e1yak and M\u00e1danna Dan\u00e1yak, as the Heggade Devas or chiefs who were governing there as representatives of the supreme power. But we may now revert to the annals of the principal modern local rulers.\n\n**Timme Gauda.**\u2014The history of the Bangalore District has already\nintroduced us to the story of Baire Gauda and the band of refugees of the Morasu Wokkal tribe, who, escaping from Kanchi, settled at Avati in the Devanhalli taluq. On their agreeing to separate, Timme Gauda, one of the seven, took up his abode at Sugatur, near Jangamkote. This was about the year 1418. Another Sugatur near Kolar lays claim to be the place, but apparently without foundation.\n\nSoon afterwards Timme Gauda repaired to the Vijayanagar court, and having ingratiated himself with the authorities, returned with the title of N\u0101\u1e0d Prabhu, or Lord of the Sugatur N\u0101\u1e0d. In course of time he discovered a hidden treasure, which, as it was in a tract claimed by Yerra Ganga and Challava Ganga, two men of the Yerralu tribe, he did not disturb, but resorted again to court, where he received the command of a small body of men. While thus employed he had an opportunity of rendering signal service by rescuing some members of the royal family who had fallen into the hands of the Mughals. For this gallant act he was rewarded with the title of Chikka R\u0101yal, and soon after returned with royal permission to appropriate the treasure he had discovered and with extended authority. He accordingly repaired the fort of Kolar, built Hoskote (the new fort), and possessed himself of Mulbagal, Punganur and the adjacent parts, turning out the descendants of Lakhana and Madanna. To Kolar he added the hoblis of Vemgal, Bail Sugatur, Kaivara, Buradagunte, and Budikote. At this period some Lingayit traders, headed by Chikkanna S\u2019etti and Kalasanna S\u2019etti, leaving the Bijapur country on account of troubles there, placed themselves under the protection of Chikka R\u0101yal Timme Gauda, who with wise policy appointed the former as Patna S\u2019etti of Kolar and the latter of Hoskote, thus attracting merchants and settlers to these two towns. He further favoured the same sect by erecting Jangamkote for their jangama or priest.\n\nImmadi (or the second) Chikka R\u0101yal Timme Gauda succeeded. On his death he divided the territory between his two sons. To Mummad\u012b (or the third) Chikka R\u0101yal Timme Gauda he granted Hoskote, and Kolar to Timme Gauda. The latter ruled for five years under the name of Sugatur Timme Gauda, and was succeeded by his son Timme Gauda, who in turn was followed by his son Chikka R\u0101yal Timme Gauda.\n\nShahji.\u2014In the middle of the sixteenth century the District appears\n\n---\n\n1 A wandering tribe identical with, or closely related to, the Korachar. They are known in Coorg as Yeravas. For a full account, quoted from Mr. Stokes, see Nellore Manual under Yerukalas, p. 154. But this story may be only a reminiscence of Ganga or Chola Ganga rule.\n\n2 Another account says of the Palegar of Chingleput.\nto have been in a disturbed state owing to the incursions of some robber chiefs, until it was subdued by the Bijapur army, and placed under the governorship of Shahji in 1639. The latter bestowed the Punganur district upon Chikka R\u00e1yal Timme Gau\u1e0da in place of Kolar, the charge of which he committed to his own son Sambhaji. On the death of whom, his son Soorut Singh managed Kolar, and subsequently it formed part of the territories of Venkoji or Eccoji.\n\nDuring his government the Mughal army under Khasim Khan conquered this part of the District, which was thenceforward attached to the province of Sira for 70 years, during part of which time Fatte Muhammad, father of Haid\u0101r Ali, was Faujdar, with Budikote as his j\u00e1gir. It next passed into the hands of the Mahrattas, of the Nawab of Kadapa, and then of Basalat Jang, chief of Adoni and brother of the Nizam. Kolar and Hoskote were ceded by the last named in 1761 to Haid\u0101r Ali, who regarded Kolar with peculiar interest as being the country of his birthplace and connected with his family. Mulbagal and Kolar were taken for a time by the British in 1768. In 1770 the Mahrattas under Madhu Rao again seized the District, but it was recovered by Haid\u0101r. In 1791 it was a second time taken by the British under Lord Cornwallis, but restored at the peace of 1792, since when it has been incorporated with the State of Mysore.\n\nMalla Baire Gau\u1e0da.\u2014The history of the north-western part of the District carries us back again to the band of exiles at Avati. Their leader Baire Gau\u1e0da had three sons, the youngest of whom, Malla Baire Gau\u1e0da, we have seen, in connection with the Bangalore District, providing for his eldest brother Sanna Baire Gau\u1e0da by founding Devanhalli, and for the second brother Havali Baire Gau\u1e0da by founding Dod-Ballapur.\n\nHaving accomplished these undertakings, Malla Baire Gau\u1e0da, about the year 1478, when on a visit to the ancient temple of Varadarajaswami at Kandavara, went out hunting northwards along the tank bank with his son Mare Gau\u1e0da. As they approached Kodi Manchanhalli, the site of the present Chik-Ballapur, they were surprised to see a hare turn upon the hounds. As this indicated heroic virtue in the soil, it was resolved to erect there a fort and petta, for which the consent of the Vijayanagar sovereign was obtained. Chik-Ballapur was accordingly founded, and long remained in the possession of Mare Gau\u1e0da and his descendants, who extended the territory by the purchase of Sidlaghatta and strengthened themselves by fortifying Nandidroog, Kalavaradroog, Gudibanda and Itikaldroog. The annals of this house are given elsewhere.\n\nChik-Ballapur, which was assisted by Mur\u00e1ri Rao, the chief of Gutti,\nwas exposed to the rival contests of the Mahrattas and the Mysoreans until taken in 1762 by Haidar Ali, who carried the chief as a captive to Bangalore, and subsequently removed him to Coimbatore. The family were kept prisoners there until released by the British army and reinstated by Lord Cornwallis in 1791, but on peace being made with Tipu Sultan, they were again forced into exile, and the district was included in the territory of Mysore.\n\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014According to the kh\u0101neshum\u0101ri returns for 1853-4, the population at that time was 461,979. The total population as ascertained at the regular census periods since has been as follows:\n\n|       | Males   | Females | Total   |\n|-------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 1871  | 309,635 | 309,269 | 618,954 |\n| 1881  | 228,193 | 232,956 | 461,129 |\n| 1891  | 297,655 | 293,375 | 591,030 |\n\nThe diminution after 1871 is of course due to the great famine; and the disproportion of the sexes in 1881 may probably be traced to the same cause. The disparity of the sexes in 1891 no doubt arises from the preponderance of male labour in the gold mines.\n\n*Density.*\u2014There are thus 186\u00b76 persons to a square mile. The taluqs most thickly peopled are Kolar, with 253\u00b76 to the square mile; Bowringpet with 212\u00b71; and Goribidnur with 211\u00b71. Next follow Chik-Ballapur with 206\u00b73, and Malur with 201\u00b74. The lowest is Bagepalli, with only 129\u00b79 to the square mile.\n\n*By Religion.*\u2014Classified according to religious belief the following are the numbers and percentage under each head:\n\n| Religion     | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total | Percentage |\n|--------------|----------|-----------|-------|------------|\n|              | Males    | Females   | Males | Females    |\n| Hindus       | 184,809  | 180,233   | 93,342| 96,348     | 554,732 | 93\u00b782 |\n| Muhammadans  | 10,689   | 8,984     | 6,623 | 6,109      | 32,405 | 5\u00b748 |\n| Jains        | 326      | 277       | 153   | 140        | 896    | 1\u00b75 |\n| Christians   | 1,201    | 779       | 511   | 505        | 2,996  | 5\u00b71 |\n| Parsi        | 1        |           |       |            | 1      | \u2014    |\n| **Total**    | **197,926** | **190,273** | **100,629** | **103,102** | **591,030** |\nIncrease.\u2014The following table compares the statistics by taluqs according to the kh\u0101neshum\u0101r\u012b accounts of 1853-4 with those obtained in the censuses of 1871, 1881 and 1891:\n\n| Taluq          | 1853-4 | 1871   | 1881   | 1891   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Bagepalli     | 61,526 | 66,382 | 50,821 | 58,086 |\n| Bowringpet    | 45,460 | 62,662 | 51,288 | 71,042 |\n| Chik-Ballapur | 60,942 | 59,273 | 41,450 | 51,592 |\n| Chintamani    | 89,330 | 96,886 | 66,131 | 79,151 |\n| Goribidnur    | 26,087 | 76,400 | 58,676 | 71,900 |\n| Kolar         | 47,264 | 73,721 | 59,048 | 75,834 |\n| Malur         | 38,845 | 58,971 | 44,545 | 54,180 |\n| Mulbagal      | 44,686 | 70,606 | 53,389 | 61,327 |\n| Siddaghatta   | 47,839 | 81,872 | 55,786 | 67,828 |\n| **Total**     | **461,979** | **646,773** | **481,134** | **591,030** |\n\nSome of the variations are due to redistribution of taluqs, and to changes in the limits of the District. There was an apparent increase in the whole up to 1871 equivalent to 40 per cent. in eighteen years. But 25 per cent. must be allowed for defective enumeration in the early account. The famine of 1877-8 sent down the total 25\u00b76 per cent. by 1881, but it had risen again 18\u00b75 per cent. by 1891. The net result may be stated at an increase of 2\u00b734 per cent. in thirty-eight years.\n\nClasses.\u2014Classified according to sources of livelihood and nationality, the population is composed as follows:\n\n| Class                  | No.   | Per cent. |\n|------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| A. Agricultural        | 186,108 | 31\u00b748     |\n| B. Professional        | 31,939 | 5\u00b740      |\n| C. Commercial          | 55,079 | 9\u00b732      |\n| D.

These account for 487,713, or 82\u00b751 per cent. of the population:\n\n| Wokkaliga             | 163,160 |\n| Holeya                | 57,665  |\n| Bedla                 | 47,329  |\n| M\u00e4diga                | 39,607  |\n| Banajiga              | 36,296  |\n| Kuruba                | 35,304  |\n| Musalmans             | 31,759  |\n| Brahmans              | 23,325  |\n| Woddla                | 23,090  |\n| Tigala                | 10,156  |\n\nThe most numerous classes of Wokkaligas are the Morasu (84,263) and Reddi (40,267). Of the Banajigas the Telugu Banajigas (26,222) predominate. Of Musalmans, the Shekhs number 8,831, Saiyids 6,541,\nand Pathans 4,937. The chief Brahman seats are Mulikin\u00e1\u1e0d (2,986), Badagan\u00e1\u1e0d (2,771), Des'astha (2,503), and Ulchakamme (2,030).\n\nStock.\u2014The agricultural stock in 1893 included 29,733 carts and 81,673 ploughs; the manufacturing stock consisted of 4,890 looms\u2014namely, 2,653 for cloths, 1,732 for cumblies, 13 for girdles, and 21 for goni, besides 471 proprietary looms. The number of oil-mills was 456, of which 365 are of stone and 91 wooden.\n\nA number of iron sugar-cane mills have also been introduced, some of them manufactured at the iron works in Chik-Ballapur.\n\nDwellings.\u2014Houses of the better sort number 682, occupied by 6,233 tenants, and those of the inferior sort 123,964, with 584,797 inhabitants. Houses of the first class are most numerous in the Chik-Ballapur, Sidlaghatta and Bowringpet taluqs, and after these in the Kolar and Chintamani taluqs.\n\nTowns and Villages.\u2014The towns and villages, according to population, may be classified as follows:\n\n| No. | Pop.   |\n|-----|--------|\n| Over 10,000 ... | 2 22,771 |\n| 5,000 and under 10,000 ... | 3 18,871 |\n| 3,000 \" | 5,000 ... | 2 7,024 |\n| 2,000 \" | 3,000 ... | 3 7,928 |\n| 1,000 and under 2,000 | 29 39,969 |\n| 500 \" | 1,000 | 126 86,672 |\n| 200 \" | 500 | 722 212,312 |\n| Under 200 | 1,958 | 195,483 |\n\nThose with a population exceeding 5,000 are:\n\nKolar ... ... ... 12,551 Sidlaghatta ... ... 6,572\nChik-Ballapur ... ... 10,623 Mulbagal ... ... 5,026\n\nThe Kolar gold-fields, reckoned as the fifth, do not form a regularly constituted town.\n\nThe number of municipal towns is 11, all taluq or sub-taluq headquarters. There are altogether 2,865 villages and 785 hamlets populated, with 608 villages depopulated.\n\nGreat Festivals.\u2014The following religious festivals are the most numerously attended in the District:\n\nAt Nandi, Chik-Ballapur taluq, on the occasion of the Nandis'vara rathotsava, held for fifteen days from Magha bahula 14th, which attracts 20,000 people.\n\nAt Avani, Mulbagal taluq, where 10,000 people attend the festival of Ramalinga, lasting for fifteen days from the same date.\n\nAt V\u00e1nav\u00e1s\u00ed, Kolar taluq, 5,000 people assemble at the festival of Ir\u00e1lappa,

Ascending the Ghats near Kuppam in a north-west direction, it enters the Bowringpet taluq, and keeps that course to the Junction at Bowringpet, eleven miles from Kolar. Thence it continues due west through M\u0101lur taluq. The Gold Fields Railway runs for ten miles east and south from the Bowringpet Junction to the Mysore mine. The Bangalore-Guntakal Railway passes through the Goribidnur taluq from south to north.\nRoads.\u2014The length of Provincial roads is 187 miles, maintained at an annual cost of Rs. 25,860.

The summit, which is 4,399 feet above the level of the sea, was fortified by Tipu Sultan, but taken by the British in 1791. Until 1873 the surrounding hoblis formed a taluq called after this hill, with head-quarters at Chintamani.\n\nAvani.\u2014A village and hill in the Mulbagal taluq, eight miles south-west of the kasba; head-quarters of the hobli of the same name. Population, 723.\n\nThe region is said to be the Avantika-kshetra, one of the ten places of greatest sanctity in India. The hill is related to have been the residence of the poet Valmiki, author of the Ramayana, and thence to have been called Valmiki-parvata. Rama is said to have encamped here for some time on his return from the expedition against Lanka or Ceylon, and hither Sita, when subsequently banished by her husband, is stated to have come and given birth to her twin sons, finding in Valmiki a protector for herself and a preceptor for her children. It is mentioned in a Bana inscription, the professed date of which is 339, and in a later inscription is called the Gay\u00e1 of the south.\n\nThere is a considerable group of temples dedicated to Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Satrughna, as well as to Vali and Sugriva. But earlier than these was a temple erected in the ninth century, to the memory of her husband, by the Kadamba princess who was married to the Nolamba king Bira Mahendra (see Vol. I., p. 307). A memorial to a certain Tribhuvana-karttar Deva, who died in 961, states that he governed Avani for forty years, during which he built fifty temples, and constructed several tanks. Inscriptions of the Pallavas, the Cholas, the Hoysalas and the Vijayanagar kings found there show the importance attached to the place for several centuries.\n\nThe temples were repaired in the fourteenth century by Ilavanji Raya and Vasudeva Raya, who came, together with a merchant named Navakoti Narayan Shetti, from Kumbhakona. A guru of the Smarta sect resides here. To the great annual festival, held for ten days from Magha bahula 14th, in honour of Ramalingesvara (the linga set up by Rama), 10,000 people resort and 20,000 bullocks are brought for sale.\n\nBagepalli.\u2014A taluq in the north, formerly till 1882 called Gunnayakanpallya. Area 447 square miles. Head-quarters at Bagepalli.\n\n1 The title Nava-koti, or nine crores, indicates a millionaire possessed of wealth to that amount, reckoned in pagodas.\nIncludes the Gu\u1e0dibanda sub-taluq, and contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n| No. | Hoblis.     | Villages | Hamlets | Government | Sarvam\u0101nya | Jodi. | Kayamgutta | Population |\n|-----|-------------|----------|---------|------------|------------|-------|------------|------------|\n| 1   | B\u0101gepalli   | 45       | 29      | 38         | \u2014          | 5     | 2          | 8,371      |\n| 2   | Bill\u016br      | 41       | 42      | 39         | \u2014          | 2     | \u2014          | 7,422      |\n| 3   | Ch\u0113l\u016br      | 36       | 25      | 34         | \u2014          | 1     | 1          | 6,610      |\n| 4   | Gu\u1e0dibanda   | 71       | 7       | 66         | \u2014          | 3     | 2          | 7,097      |\n| 5   | G\u016bl\u016br       | 30       | 18      | 27         | \u2014          | 2     | 1          | 6,548      |\n| 6   | Mittemari   | 38       | 33      | 33         | \u2014          | 5     | \u2014          | 6,553      |\n| 7   | P\u0101ly\u0101       | 38       | 45      | 33         | \u2014          | 4     | 1          | 8,423      |\n| 8   | S\u014dmenhall\u012b  | 75       | 19      | 72         | \u2014          | 1     | 2          | 7,062      |\n| Total|             | 374      | 218     | 342        | \u2014          | 23    | 9          | 58,086     |\n\nPrincipal places, with population:\u2014Gu\u1e0dibanda, 1,957; B\u0101gepalli, 1,389; Ch\u0101kav\u0113l, 1,296; Mittemari, 1,019; G\u016bl\u016br, 971.\n\nA rugged and hilly taluq, the centre of which is crossed from north to south by the Dongala-konda hills. The south-eastern portion is watered by the P\u0101paghni, which receives a considerable stream named the Vandanam, rising near P\u0101tp\u0101lya. On the frontier, near Chelur, the P\u0101paghni forms a very large tank, called the Vy\u0101sa-samudra, after Vy\u0101s\u0101r\u0101ya-sv\u0101mi, a guru of the M\u0101dhva Brahmans, by whom it is said to have been constructed. Through the western side of the taluq flows the Chitravati, which near B\u0101gepalli is dammed by anicuts, and supplies some small channels for irrigation. In the open country east and west of the hills there are many good tanks, the number in the taluq altogether being 481. The most productive part is probably the north-eastern. But much of the surface of the country is broken and irregular and unfit for cultivation. The neighbourhood of the hills, except where there are fruitful valleys, is covered with low jungle. Iron ore is found and manufactured in great quantities. The taluq produces a good breed of sheep.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1885, except in the Gu\u1e0dibanda and S\u014dmenhalli hoblis, which had been settled in 1876. The unculturable area in the former was 133,335 acres, or 208\u00bd square miles.\n\nThe total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (fifteen months) was Rs. 1,34,127, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,64,494. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 1,02,765 and Rs. 1,14,121 respectively.\nThe average annual rainfall at B\u0101gepalli for twenty-five years (1870\u201394), has been as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n|      |      |      |      |     |      |      |      |       |      |      |      | 18'44 |\n\nThe old road from Bangalore to Bellary runs through the west of the taluq from south to north. From B\u0101gepalli there are roads east to Chelur and south-east to Chintamani. From the high road there is also a branch west to Gu\u1e0dibanda and to the railway at Goribidnur.\n\n**Bagepalli or Bagenhalli.**\u2014A small frontier town on the right bank of the Chitravati, about sixty miles north-west of Kolar, on the old Bangalore-Bellary road.

Inscriptions show that the first of these was in existence in the fourteenth century.\n\nThe place now derives all its importance from being the taluq head-quarters. An attempt was made some years ago to remove it to the left bank of the river for the sake of communication with the high road, but without success, as the people could not be induced to move and rebuild their houses on the new site.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 321     | 305     | 398     | 697     |\n| Expenditure...   | 442     | 451     | 529     | 973     |\n\n**Betamangala.**\u2014An old town on the right bank of the Palar, which till 1864 gave its name to and was the head-quarters of what is now the Bowringpet taluq. It is eighteen miles south-east of Kolar, with which it is connected by road. A road from Bowringpet to Mulbagal also passes through it. Population 1,160.\n\nA fair held on Friday is attended by 1,000 people.\n\nThe name is a contraction of Vijay\u0101ditya-mangala, derived from the\nB\u00e1na king Vijay\u00e1ditya, probably its founder. Two old inscribed stones worshipped in a temple under the name of Gangamma, are of the dates 904 and 944, the Nolamba period. The large tank was repaired in the time of the Nolamba king Iriva Nolamba, about 950. It again breached and was restored in 1095 by Chokkimaya, general of the Hoysala prince Vishnuvardhana, while encamped at Nangali, after a victorious expedition to the countries in the east below the Ghats.\n\nThe town lost its importance on the opening in 1864 of the railway, which diverted the former large passenger traffic, and the removal, owing to increasing unhealthiness, of the taluq head-quarters to the newly-formed town of Bowringpet.\n\n**Bowringpet.**\u2014A taluq in the south-east, formerly called Betamangala.

The west of the taluq is crossed from north to south by the auriferous tract, generally uncultivated and marked by low flat hills, in which have now been formed the Kolar Gold mines. The southern borders of the taluq abut upon the Eastern Ghats, and are rugged and jungly.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1890.\n\nThe total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (fifteen months) was Rs. 2,03,390, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,68,709.

From Bowringpet there are roads north to Kolar, east to B\u00e9tamangala, south-west to Budikote, and a loop road east south and west through the gold mines to Kamasandra. There is also a road from B\u00e9tamangala to Kolar.\n\n**Bowringpet.**\u2014A new town, situated at the former Kolar Road, now Bowringpet station of the Bangalore Branch Railway, to which it owes its origin. It includes the previously existing villages of Maramatlu and Hosingere, and was established in 1864 on the opening of the railway, being named after Mr. Bowring, then Chief Commissioner.

The Nandidroog range runs north and south through the western side, the hills of Dibbagiri, Brahmagiri or Vargkonda, Channakesava-betta, Hariharesvara-betta, and Kalavara-durga being included in the taluq, besides the lofty peak of Nandidroog itself. The valley between this mountain and Brahmagiri encloses the principal forest in the District, in a part of which coffee is cultivated. Of the passes through the chain, the Manchenhalli ghat, through which a road connects Chik-Ballapur and Goribidnur, is the chief. A road to Dod-Ballapur runs through a pass called the Basavan kanive to the north of Nandidroog, but a level road from Nandi has been carried round the base of the hills to meet the other beyond.\n\nAround this spot and within a few miles of Chik-Ballapur the S. Pin\u00e1kini rises on the east of the range, flows through the tanks of the town, and bends southwards to Jangamkote. The Chitravati rises in the north-east and continues that direction past Per\u00e9sandra. The N. Pin\u00e1kini rises on the west and flows north-west into Goribidnur. The Arkavati, rising near the same spot, takes a south-west course to Dod-Ballapur.\n\nThe soil on the table-land about Chik-Ballapur and Nandi, and to the west of the range, is of great fertility and extremely favourable for the cultivation of the sugar-cane. Much of the Per\u00e9sandra hobli, on the other hand, is unfavourable to husbandry, abounding with deep ravines and broken ground, through which the streams from the mountains and high lands westward fall into the low country about Sadali.\n\nBesides the fortifications of Nandidroog there are several buildings in the taluq deserving of mention, among others the temple of Um\u00e1-mahesvara at Nandi, decorated with some delicate stone carving, and of Rangaswami at the ranga sthala 2 miles west of Chik-Ballapur.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1884. The unculturable area is 82,062 acres, or 128\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) square miles, and the area of the Nandi State forest is 2,749 acres, or nearly 4\\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) square miles. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,43,567, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,78,257. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 79,316 and Rs. 83,622 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall for 25 years (1870\u201394) has been as follows at Chik-Ballapur:\n\n| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Rainfall | 0'04 | 0'08 | 0'53 | 0'87 | 3'29 | 2'97 | 3'69 | 4'96 | 5'77 | 6'05 | 2'74 | 0'51 |\n\nThe old Bangalore-Bellary road crosses the taluq from south to north through Chik-Ballapur, whence there are roads east to Sidlaghatta, west to Goribidnur, and south-west to Nandi and Dod-Ballapur. A road from Kolar to Dod-Ballapur passes through Nandi. A short branch\nconnects the south-eastern foot of Nandidroog with the high road near Devanhalli. A line of rail is proposed connecting Chik-Ballapur with the railway at Dod-Ballapur.\n\n**Chik-Ballapur.**\u2014A large town 36 miles north-west of Kolar, on the old Bangalore-Bellary road.

In Hindustani it is called Ch\u00f3ta Ball\u00e1p\u00far, and in Telugu, Chinna Ball\u00e1puram. It was founded about 1479 by *Malla Baire Gauda*, youngest son of Baire Gauda, the leader of the refugees who settled at Avati. The village which originally occupied the site was called Kodi Manchanahalli, in the vicinity of which Malla Baire Gauda, while hunting, observed a hare turn upon the hounds, and was led by this indication of *gandu bh\u00fami*, or male soil, to make proposals for the erection of a fort and petta there to Baiche Gauda and Baire Gauda, the joint patels. But permission of the Vijayanagar sovereign being necessary, Mari Gauda, the chief\u2019s son, was despatched thither and returned with a favourable reply. The moment determined on by the Brahmans as the most lucky for laying the foundation of the fort was to be proclaimed when Malla Baire Gauda and the workmen were on the spot, by the sound of a conch such as is carried by beggars. But unluckily one of that fraternity passing at the time sounded his shell, which being taken for the signal agreed on, the work was commenced half an hour too soon, in consequence of which it was foretold that the government should continue in that family only 300 years.\n\nOn its completion, *Mari Gauda* was appointed governor of the new state and ruled for 24 years. His son *Dodda Baire Gauda* succeeded. He reigned only 3 years and was followed by his son *Rangappa Gauda*, who held the government for 42 years. Dying without issue, he was succeeded by his brother *Jogi Baire Gauda*, who ruled for 30 years, and was followed by his son *Dodda Baire Gauda* for 46 years. The latter left no issue, but his wife *Venkatamma* carried on the government with the aid of confidential officers for 15 years longer, and at her death appointed *Mari Gauda*, a grandson of Jogi Baire Gauda\u2019s whom she\nhad brought up from an infant, to succeed her.\\footnote{Another account says he was a son of the Devanhalli chief and adopted by her.} After a reign of 45 years, through some defect or imbecility in his management, he was deposed, and succeeded by his eldest brother \\textit{Anni Gauda}, he being only the fifth son. The new ruler, during a reign of 18 years, purchased Sidlaghatta for 100,000 pagodas, annexed it to his territory, and died after amassing a fortune of 20 lakhs of pagodas. The brother who had been deposed appears to have been put in possession of Sadali and Itikaldurga as a j\u00e1gir. Anni Gauda\u2019s son \\textit{Havali Baire Gauda} succeeded, but after 4 months was deposed, on account of his tyranny and oppression, being succeeded by his nephew \\textit{Baiche Gauda}, who ruled 16 years.\n\nDuring his time the Mysore army under Kanthirava, the Dalavayi, attempted to reduce the fort. But the Mahrattas, to whom Baiche Gauda applied, forced him to raise the siege, and in a severe battle near Kotikonda, defeated and slew him, cutting off his head. Baiche Gauda soon after purchased and annexed Burdagunta. At his death he was succeeded by his son \\textit{Do\u00e7da Baire Gauda}, who during a reign of 2 years re-conquered those parts of the dominion which had submitted to Kanthirava during the siege of the capital. He was succeeded by his brother \\textit{Venkata Narayan Gauda}, who ruled 35 years, and was followed by his son \\textit{Baiche Gauda}. The latter after 9 months was deposed, and his uncle \\textit{Chikkappa Gauda} took the government.\n\nThree years after his accession, Haidar Ali appeared before the town, and after a siege of three months, during which many attempts were made to carry the fort by storm and mining, which from the pallegar\u2019s knowledge of counter-mining was unsuccessful, a treaty was concluded by which the Mysore army was to withdraw on condition of the chief\u2019s paying 500,000 pagodas and a golden head in the room of Kanthirava\u2019s, particularly insisted on by Haidar. Part of the sum was paid on the spot, and a confidential officer left to receive the balance. But no sooner had Haidar removed to Devanhalli than Chikkappa Gauda communicated with Mur\u00e1ri Rao, the chief of Gutti, who at once sent a reinforcement. Putting these troops in possession of the fort, the Gauda with his family took refuge at Nandidroog. Haidar, immediately on hearing of it, retook the fort, severely punishing the defenders by mutilation, and shortly after sent a force to reduce Nandidroog, Kalavaradroog, Gudibanda, Itikaldroog and Kotikonda. The pallegar and his family were kept close prisoners in Bangalore, where Chikkappa Gauda died, without issue. A report being circulated that a rescue would be attempted, the other prisoners were removed to Coimbatore.\n\nWhen Haidar visited Coimbatore some time after and desired them to be brought before him, they all attended except Baiche Gauda, the\none that had been deposed, whose pride was averse to saluting the conqueror. Unwilling to hurt the old man's sensibility, Haidar ordered that he should be admitted through a low door, intending to accept the bending down with his head forward in passing through it as a salute and return the compliment. But the obstinate Gauda, to prevent Haidar having even that gratification, presented one of his feet first, on which he was put into irons and close confinement.\n\nA younger member of the family, named Narayan Gauda, was afterwards re-instated by Lord Cornwallis and put in possession of Chik-Ballapur, which Tipu's troops had evacuated in order to defend Nandidroog. He declined assistance, preferring to rely on his own resources, which Tipu hearing of, made a sudden attack upon the fort, took and demolished it after a feeble resistance. On the capture of Nandidroog by the British in 1791, the chief was again in possession for a short time, but on the conclusion of peace with Tipu could no longer retain his power.\n\nThe town has been improved of late years by several large buildings for Sub-Division offices, Munsif's Court, &c. The London Mission have also made a principal out-station here.

That which lies to the north of the roads from Chint\u00e1mani to Bagepalli and to Kadapa respectively, is a kal s'ime or stony tract, draining to the north; all to the south of it is a kempu bail s'ime or open rolling country composed of red soil, draining to the south. Though the latter is the more favourable for general cultivation, the former has greater facilities for storing the drainage, both tanks and wells in that part being very good. Sugar-cane is largely grown and thrives well. Cocoa-nut and areca nut, on the other hand, are raised in very small quantities and are poor. Of the crops produced on dry fields, the ragi is of a superior description and highly esteemed. Fine topes of mango, tamarind and other trees are common. The honge is abundant everywhere.\n\nBlankets and coarse cloth are manufactured in some parts, as well as a finer cloth for kamarbands. Gunny for sacking is woven at Dimbala and Ronur.\n\nInscriptions show that the B\u00e1anas, the Vaidumbas, the Pallavas, the Cholas, the Hoysalas, and the Vijayanagar kings have at various times occupied this part of the country, until the Mahrattas in modern times gained an ascendancy for short periods.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1887. The unculturable area is 202,201 acres, or nearly 316 square miles: the area of inam villages is 17,075 acres, or about 26\\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) square miles. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,05,640, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,52,058. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 1,56,467 and Rs. 1,74,369 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall at Chint\u00e1mani for 25 years (1870\u201394) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0\u00b007 | 0\u00b022 | 0\u00b092 | 2\u00b063 | 2\u00b026 | 2\u00b037 | 3\u00b018 | 4\u00b002 | 6\u00b046  | 3\u00b056 | 1\u00b045 | ...  | 27\u00b014 |\n\nThe old Bangalore-Kadapa high road runs through the taluq from south-west to north-east, being met at Muragamale by one from Kolar through Sriniv\u00e1sapur. From Chint\u00e1mani there are roads west to Sidlaghatta, north-west to Bagepalli, north to Chelur, and east to Sriniv\u00e1sapur and Mulbagal, with a short one south to the Kadapa high road.\n\n**Chintamani** (more properly Chint\u00e1manip\u00e9t).\u2014An important commercial town, 27 miles north-north-west of Kolar; head-quarters of the Chint\u00e1mani taluq, and a municipality.\nThe town is named after its founder Chint\u00e1mani Rao, a Mahratta chief, and is the seat of the Komatis or banking class. Considerable trade is carried on in gold, silver, and precious stones, besides other merchandise. Pomegranates grow here to a large size. A low hill commanding the town on the north-west was formerly fortified.\n\n**Chitravati.**\u2014An affluent of the N. Pin\u00e1kini. It rises in the Hari haresvara hill, north of Nandidroog, and flowing north-east between the Worlakonda hill and Bagepalli, leaves Mysore a few miles north of the latter. Thence, entering the Anantapur District, it runs north past Kodikonda, after which, turning north-east again, it supplies the Bukkapatna and Dharm\u00e1varam tanks, and ends its course near Gaudalur of the Kadapa District, where it unites with the N. Pin\u00e1kini or Pennar. The stream is damned near Bagepalli in several places, from which channels are led off which irrigate a considerable extent of paddy land in the Bagepalli taluq.\n\n**Dibbagiri.**\u2014The terminal hill southwards of the Nandidroog range, properly Divigiri.\n\n**Dokkala-konda,** or Dongala kond\u00e1.\u2014The Robber hills (Telugu), so named from their affording a shelter to the banditti who used to plunder the neighbouring country. The hills are on the Mysore frontier in the north of the Bagepalli taluq.\n\n**Goribidnur.**\u2014A taluq in the north-west. Area 341 square miles. Head-quarters at Goribidnur. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 3 Jains) | 1,525 | 1,582 | 3,107 |\n| Muhammadans | 372 | 359 | 731 |\n| Christians | 1 | \u2014 | 1 |\n| **Total** | **1,898** | **1,941** | **3,839** |\n\nMunicipal Funds.\n\n| Year | Income | Expenditure |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| 1892-3 | 2,200 | 6,083 |\n| 1893-4 | 2,082 | 2,565 |\n| 1894-5 | 2,223 | 2,732 |\n| 1895-6 | 4,144 | 3,952 |\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Hosur, 2,574; Manchenhalli, 1,989; Goribidnur, 1,765; Idagur, 1,514; Tondebh\u00e1vi, 1,444; D\u00e1dinayakanp\u00e1lya, 1,428; Hudagur, 1,409; N\u00e1magondlu, 1,379; Minakingurike, 1,172; Narsinganhalli, 1,140; Varavani, 1,038; Mudagere, 1,030.\n\nThe taluq was extended in 1886 by the addition of some neighbouring hoblis. It is composed of the basin of the N. Pin\u00e1kini, which river runs through it from south-east to north, being confined between the Nandidroog range of mountains on the east and a chain of hills from M\u00e1kalidurga on the west. The Kumadvati or Kundar, a tributary of the N. Pin\u00e1kini, rising on the west of M\u00e1kalidurga in Bangalore District, flows through the taluq from south to north and then enters the Maddagiri taluq of the Tumkur District. A small stream from the east of M\u00e1kalidurga waters the Tondebh\u00e1vi hobli and joins the N. Pin\u00e1kini a little to the east of Bommasandra.\n\nThe level of the taluq is considerably lower than that of the neighbouring parts of the District, the descent being marked on the south by the Nagralpille kanave on the Dod-Ballapur frontier, and by the Manchenhalli ghat on the east. The soil is loose and fertile, especially in the neighbourhood of the chief town, where water is easily procurable almost at the surface, not only from channels from the river but from shallow wells of never failing water, the sides of which are protected with wicker baskets to prevent their falling in. Sugar-cane, paddy, turmeric, and ground-nut are extensively cultivated; cocoanut and areca-nut especially near Varavani. The wild custard-apple grows abundantly on the hills, where also iron ore is plentiful.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1880. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (fifteen months) was Rs. 1,82,778, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,42,214. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 1,33,570, and Rs. 1,43,730 respectively.\nThe average rainfall at Goribidnur for twenty-five years (1870-94) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0.12 | 0.15 | 0.52 | 2.61 | 2.05 | 2.09 | 3.80 | 4.68 | 5.41  | 1.88 | 0.25 | 23.56 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Guntakal railway runs through the middle of the taluq from south to north, with stations at Tondebhavi, Goribidnur and Dod-Kurugod. The old road to Hindupur is close alongside the railway, and from Goribidnur there are roads east to Gudibanda and south-east to Chik-Ballapur. There is also a road westwards from Tondebhavi to Maddagiri.\n\n**Goribidnur.**\u2014A town on the left bank of the N. Pinakini, fifty-six miles north-west of Kolar, on the Bangalore-Guntakal railway, and the Dod-Ballapur-Hindupur road. Head-quarters of the Goribidnur taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus (with 16 Jains) | ... | 748 | 743 | 1,491 |\n| Muhammadans | ... | 137 | 132 | 269 |\n| Christians | ... | 5 | \u2014 | 5 |\n| **Total** | ... | 890 | 875 | 1,765 |\n\nIt is stated to have been in ancient times the residence of Vidura, an uncle of the Pandavas, and thence called *Vidur\u016br*. A peepul tree of great age, said to have been planted by him, is still an object of worship, under the name of the Vidur-asvattha, near Dod-Kurugod, four miles to the north. In modern times the town became a possession of the chief of Da\u1e0din\u0101yakanp\u0101lya, eight miles to the east, who gave it as a dowry to his daughter, and after her name it was called *Gauri Vidur\u016br*. The Muhammadans corrupted it into *Gori Bidn\u016br*, a form to which some *goris* or tombs erected by them near the town seem to give countenance. The fine tomb at Hire Bidnur, the other side of the river, is that of Husen Shah Mirza, one of the Bijapur nobles. The one at Goribidnur is of the same period, in memory of a saint named Bakh\u0101ri Vali.\n\nThe place lies low, 2,252 feet above the sea, and differs from all other parts of the District, bearing a resemblance, it is said, in some of its features to Conjeveram. The climate is hot, the soil loose and fertile, water abundant and easily procurable almost at the surface. The town\nis rising much in importance owing to the advent of the railway, and the establishment of a sugar factory by Messrs. Arbuthnot & Co. of Madras.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 761    | 1,452  | 1,422  | 1,398  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 1,039  | 1,975  | 1,945  | 3,681  |\n\n**Gudibanda.**\u2014A sub-taluq included in Bagepalli taluq, to the west; composed of the Gudibanda and Somenhalli hoblis. Head-quarters at Gudibanda. Till 1882 it was a separate taluq.\n\n**Gudibanda.**\u2014A town in the Nandidroog range of hills, fifty-eight miles north-west of Kolar. Head-quarters of the Gudibanda sub-taluk, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 27 Jains) | 685   | 727     | 1,412 |\n| Muhammadans       | 235   | 216     | 451   |\n| Total             | 920   | 943     | 1,863 |\n\nIt is situated at the southern foot of a *banda* or rock, of domelike shape, surmounted by a *gudi* or temple, whence the name. Gudibanda, with the jungly tract in its vicinity, was given to *Havali Baire Gauda*, on the capture of Dod-Ballapur by Khasim Khan. It was then the haunt of freebooters, and little or no improvements were made in cultivation till some time after, when he had address enough to conciliate them, and they became useful husbandmen. He first built the fortifications on the rock called Old Gudibanda, and some time after fortified the present rock, and dying without issue was succeeded by his wife's brother *R\u00e1ma Gauda*. This gave umbrage to Baiche Gauda of Chik-Ballapur, the line of succession of his family being thereby interrupted, which he endeavoured to recover by proposing a marriage between his son and Rama Gauda's daughter, and requested R\u00e1ma Gauda to pay him a visit at Chik-Ballapur to settle the terms. But this he declined, agreeing, however, to meet him half-way between their respective capitals. They accordingly had an interview near Mandikal, attended by their forces. After several apparently friendly conversations, one of R\u00e1ma Gauda's servants, whom Baiche Gauda had gained over, on a signal\ngiven, stabbed his master in the back. Gudibanda was thereby annexed to Chik-Ballapur, perhaps about the year 1689.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 502    | 487    | 461    | 921    |\n| Expenditure     | 629    | 682    | 565    | 1,098  |\n\n**Gumnayakanpalya.**\u2014A village in the B\u00e1gepalli taluq, to which, till 1882, it gave a name, and was formerly the head-quarters. It is 10 miles east of B\u00e1gepalli. Population 229.\n\n*Gumma-n\u00e1yakana-p\u00e1lya* is a small fortified circular rock in the midst of jungle, rising about 150 feet above the surrounding hilly tract, and to the eastward of the range. It appears to have been originally dependent on P\u00e1tp\u00e1lya, the residence of a B\u00e9dar named P\u00e1pa N\u00e1yak. A settlement was subsequently made there by *Gumma N\u00e1yak* and *Lakka N\u00e1yak*, two brothers from Devarajhalli, who discovered a hidden treasure, and induced some neighbours to join them. Asylum was also given to a band of freebooters from Kadapa, on condition of receiving half the plunder they might obtain. For their protection Lakka N\u00e1yak, about the year 1364, built a line of defence round the rock, naming the place after his brother, now dead. On a visit he paid to a neighbouring fair he was impressed with the state and retinue maintained by other pallgars and became desirous of increasing his consequence. He accordingly encouraged immigrants from the neighbouring districts to join his standard on condition of enjoying three-fourths of the produce of their lands and added to his forces. On his death, in 1372, he was succeeded by his son *Masal N\u00e1yak*, who, taking advantage of P\u00e1pa N\u00e1yak's death, subdued Patpalya and other places. He was succeeded in 1412 by his son *Kadrappa N\u00e1yak*, to whose honour it is related that he introduced many wise regulations and appointed village accountants to superintend and encourage cultivation. The withdrawal of the robbers protected by the former rulers was the consequence of these politic measures. The estimable Kadrappa N\u00e1yak died in 1472. Of his six sons, *Narsimha N\u00e1yak*, the eldest, ruled 3 years, *Kadrappa N\u00e1yak*, the second son, 7 years. *Masal N\u00e1yak*, the next son, then succeeded. During his tenure of power he gained possession, by force or stratagem, of some neighbouring p\u00e1lyams, and died in 1500 of a mortification in his back. His brother *Vira N\u00e1yak* succeeded, and pursuing the same policy died in 1532, \"little esteemed or regretted.\" His son, *Vasanta N\u00e1yak*, after a quiet rule of 5 years,\nwas followed by Lakka Nayak, son of the latter. He was shortly summoned to pay tribute to the Penugonda sovereign, to which he consented. At the same time he strengthened the fortifications of Gumnayakanpalya, constructed a large tank to the west and improved the town.\n\nNothing of interest is related of the succeeding rulers, during whose time various conquests were made, until the accession of Narsimha Nayak. He is described as a weak prince, on which account a dalavai was appointed, named Sani Narsimaya. He was a man of ambitious views, and by his successful conquests, including that of Itikaldurga, gained such an ascendency in the state that R\u00e1makka, the Nayak\u2019s wife, regarded with apprehension his growing power. When, therefore, the Mahratta army under Murari Rao appeared before the capital, she opened negotiations with the view of getting rid of the minister. He, however, coming to know this, offered them battle, and broke up their camp. R\u00e1makka\u2019s situation now became daily more critical, as she had gone too far to withdraw, and was entirely in the dalavai\u2019s power. She therefore secretly offered to all the neighbouring chiefs from whom conquests had been made an unconditional surrender of the places they had lost, provided they would combine against the minister. The latter opposed the confederate forces with his usual bravery. But they gaining intelligence that his resources were nearly at an end, cut the bank of the tank and forced him to capitulate. He requested permission to retire with his family and private property. This the allies refused, but through the advice of R\u00e1makka the terms were ultimately agreed to, and Sani Narsimaya retired to Chik-Ballapur, where he died of a broken heart. The p\u00e1lyam was soon after reduced by the army of Haidar Ali, and Narsimha Nayak with his wife R\u00e1makka were taken prisoners, first to Guramkonda and then to Seringapatam. The chief died on his way, his reign having lasted 64 years.\n\nHariharesvara-betta.\u2014A two-peaked hill rising to 4,122 feet above sea-level, north of Nandidroog, and one of the same range. It is the reputed source of the Chitravati.\n\nHosur.\u2014A large village in the Goribidnur taluq, 6 miles south-west of the kasba. Population 2,574.\n\nA fair held on Saturday is attended by 500 people. Under the name of Hosav\u00edd\u00fa, the new camp or residence, it was for a time occupied by the Hoysala king Ball\u00e1la III., who may have been its founder, and may have named it with reference to Haleb\u00edd\u00fa, his old residence or capital of Dorasamudra, which had been destroyed by the Musalmans. As Hosapa\u1e6d\u1e6dana it apparently formed in 1355 one of the boundary towns\nof the early Vijayanagar kingdom under Bukka Raya I. (see Vol. I., p. 346), and was a royal residence. It probably lost its importance when the Bijapur power was overcome by the Mughals in 1687, and is now greatly reduced in population and extent from what it was even a few years ago, the population in 1871 being 5,751, and in 1891 only 2,574.\n\n**Hunkunda.**\u2014A village in the D\u00e1sarahosahalli h\u00f3bli of the Bowringpet taluq, about 8 miles north by east of the kasba, near the Kolar-Betamangala road. Population 329.\n\nIt seems, from the numerous inscriptions there, to have been a frontier station down to the 10th and 11th centuries, where much fighting took place. It was successively in the possession of Mah\u00e1vali B\u00e1narasa, the Nolamba kings Ayyapa and Dil\u00edpayya, the Ganga king M\u00e1rasimha, and Uttama Chola Ganga.\n\n**Kaivara.**\u2014A village in Chint\u00e1mani taluq, 7 miles east by south of the kasba, near the Bangalore-Kadapa road. Head-quarters of the Kaivara hobli. Population 1,287.\n\nThere are several old temples in the place, which is said to have been formerly called Ekachakrapura, celebrated in the history of the P\u00e1ndavas. One of the temples is said to have been founded by them. The inscriptions are of the time of Ganga Perum\u00e1l in the 13th century, and of the Vijayanagar kings afterwards.\n\n**Kalavara-durga** or **Skandagiri.**\u2014The most prominent height to the north of Nandidroog, from which it is 5 miles distant, forming part of the same range. The summit, 4,749 feet above the sea, was formerly fortified and directly commanded the town of Chik-Ballapur. The P\u00e1paghni is said to have its source in this hill. The fort was taken by the British in 1791 and has been dismantled.\n\n**Kaundinya.**\u2014An affluent of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r. It rises in the Kuruduimale hill near Mulbagal. Taking an easterly course, after feeding some smaller tanks, it falls into the large one at Nangali. Thence crossing the frontier near the village of Potenagavara, it turns south-east near Palamner, and flows into the P\u00e1l\u00e1r near Gudiyatam.\n\n**Kumadvati** or **Kundar.**\u2014A tributary of the N. Pin\u00e1kini. It rises in the Bangalore District, west of M\u00e1kalidurga, and in its course northwards flows through the Goribidnur taluq, whence it enters the Tumkur District in Maddagiri taluq.\n\n**Kolar,**\u2014A taluq in the centre towards the south. Area 299 square miles. Head-quarters at Kolar. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Kolar, 12,148; Vokkal\u00e9ri, 1,674; Ky\u00e1lnur, 1,599.\n\nThe Palar runs through the northern and eastern parts of the taluq: the western side is occupied with the ranges of the Kolar and Vokkal\u00e9ri hills. It is generally well cultivated, including even the table-land on the Kolar hills. There are 300 tanks, of which at least ten may be called large. There are also numerous fine wells, especially in the south, with water close to the surface. The dry crop soils are generally red, mixed with sand. The best soil is found in Holur and the old Dalsanur hoblis, where also stretches of black soil are met with. Silk-worms are reared in many of the villages, the silk being exported.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1889. The unculturable area is 83,587 acres, or 130\u00bd square miles; the area of in\u00e1m villages is 29,937 acres, or nearly 46 square miles, and that of plantations 302 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,88,895, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,40,685. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 1,41,882 and Rs. 1,56,678 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall for 25 years (1870\u201394) at Kolar, and for two years (1893\u20134) at the other stations was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Kolar | ... | 0\u00b709 | 0\u00b704 | 0\u00b745 | 1\u00b722 | 2\u00b796 | 3\u00b727 | 2\u00b780 | 3\u00b796 | 4\u00b778 | 5\u00b751 | 3\u00b731 | 0\u00b784 | ... | 29\u00b724 |\n| Mudavadi | ... | 0\u00b711 | 0\u00b715 | 0\u00b742 | 1\u00b752 | 3\u00b709 | 1\u00b788 | 2\u00b782 | 3\u00b730 | 1\u00b719 | 7\u00b718 | 2\u00b718 | \u2014 | ... | 23\u00b784 |\n| Vemgal | ... | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0\u00b760 | 0\u00b750 | 3\u00b720 | 3\u00b765 | 2\u00b753 | 5\u00b705 | 2\u00b790 | 3\u00b744 | 2\u00b793 | \u2014 | ... | 24\u00b780 |\n\nThe old Bangalore-Madras road passes through Kolar, running west to east, from Hoskote to Mulbagal. From Kolar there are also roads south to the railway at Bowringpet, north to Srinivaspur, north west to Nandi, south-west to Malur, and south-east to Betamangala. There is also a short road from Vemgal leading to Malur.\nKolar.\u2014The chief town of the District, situated in $13^\\circ 6' \\text{ N. lat.}$, and $78^\\circ 7' \\text{ E. long.}$, 43 miles east-north-east of Bangalore by road, but connected with it by rail from the station at Bowringpet, 11 miles to the south.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 18 Jains) | ... | ... | 9,225 |\n| Muhammadans | 4,681 | 4,544 | 9,225 |\n| Christians | 1,043 | 1,491 | 2,534 |\n| Total | 186 | 203 | 389 |\n\nKolar is a place of great antiquity, but has passed through so many vicissitudes, and been so devastated by warfare in modern times, that but little now remains in it that is ancient. It was founded by the Gangas early in the Christian era, if not in existence before. Though Talakad was their capital, the title \"Lord of the city of Kuvalala\" (or Kolala,\u2014the old names of Kolar), is assumed by all the Ganga kings down to the 11th century, and also by the Chalukya princes whose mother was of the Ganga family. When the Ganga power was overthrown by the Cholas in about 1004, Kolar passed into the hands of the latter, and from inscriptions it would appear that the existing temple of Kolaramma may have been erected in the time of Rajendra Chola. Early in the next century the Hoysalas drove out the Cholas from Mysore, and Kolala is specially mentioned among the conquests of Vishnuvardhana. When, in the latter half of the 13th century, a partition of the Hoysala dominions took place between the two sons of Somesvara, Kolar was included in the Tamil districts, and fell to the share of Ramanatha. But even up to this time a family of Chola-Gangas continued in power there, who still bore the title \"Lord of the city of Kuvalala.\"\n\nPassing over the early Vijayanagar period, we come to the 15th century, in which Timme Gauja, with the title of Chikka Rayal, received authority to repair the fort of Kolar. Bijapur next subdued the place, and in 1639 Shahji, father of the celebrated Sivaji, became the Governor of this, with other Districts), and often resided there. The Mughals took it 50 years later, and in about 1720 Fatte Muhammad, father of Haidar Ali, became Faujdar of Kolar, under the Subadar of Sira, who had a residence on the Kolar hills. After various fortunes, Kolar was ceded to Haidar Ali in 1761. It was subsequently at times again lost to Mysore. In 1768 it was taken by the English under Colonel Donald\nCampbell. In 1770 it was taken by the Mahrattas under Madhu Rao. In 1791 it was again taken by the English under Lord Cornwallis, but at the peace of 1792 was restored to Tipu Sultan, and since then has been included in the Mysore territory.\n\nThe Makbara or tomb of Haidar Ali's father is one of the principal old buildings, and is still maintained with an endowment. The fort walls were levelled about 20 years ago and the ditch filled up. Many new streets were at the same time laid out. The Kolar tank on the east is a fine sheet of water. The town contains the usual District offices for Deputy and Assistant Commissioners, School, Dispensary, Barracks, &c. There is also an orphanage, now under the Methodist Episcopal Mission.\n\nThe old roads by the Mugli and Naikaneri passes from Madras and the districts east of the Ghats to Bangalore united at Kolar and, before superseded by the railway, brought a continual influx of travellers and pilgrims to the town from both sides. The result was frequent outbreaks of cholera, as a hot-bed for which fell disease Kolar was long notorious. The diversion of this heterogeneous stream of humanity, no less than superior sanatory arrangements, have entirely freed it of that scourge for many years. Scorpions abound, whose sting is unusually venomous and often fatal. A pit under the entrance to the Kolaramma temple is full of scorpions, which make a hissing noise on being disturbed, and among the offerings presented at the temple it is customary to include the figure of a scorpion in silver. The mulberry is cultivated for the rearing of silkworms. Turkeys are reared in large numbers for export to Bangalore, Bellary and other places. Cumblies or coarse blankets are also manufactured. A large fair takes place on Thursday, attended by 2,000 people, and 700 cattle.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 7,243  | 7,564  | 7,102  | 7,412  |\n| Expenditure    | 7,735  | 8,243  | 6,145  | 8,854  |\n\nKolar-betta or hills, also bear the name of Satasringa parvata, the hundred peaked hills. The range extends along the north west of the town of Kolar, the highest point being 4,026 feet above the sea. The hills present a barren and rocky appearance on all sides, but on the top is an extensive plateau occupied by villages and irrigated fields. A perennial spring on the east side, named the Antara Ganga or subterranean Ganges, is esteemed sacred.\n\nThe legends connected with these hills have been referred to in the\nhistorical summary. Two centuries ago they were fortified, and here the Mughal general Khasim Khan, the first Subadar of Sira, for some time resided. The fort was destroyed by the Mahrattas.\n\n**Kolar Gold Fields.**\u2014These are in the south of the Bowringpet taluq, to the east of a low ridge of hills of which Betar\u0101yan hill, 3,199 feet above sea level, is the most conspicuous point. They are connected by the Gold Fields railway with the Bangalore-Madras line at Bowringpet, and a road runs through them from Bowringpet to Kamasandra, where there is also a railway station. Information regarding the geology and the recent history and development of these gold fields has already been given in Vol. I. Upwards of $35\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles have been leased for gold-mining in the District, and the following thirteen companies are now at work (arranged alphabetically).\n\n| Company                  | Capital |\n|--------------------------|---------|\n| Balaghat                 | \u00a3200,000|\n| Champion Reef            | 220,000 |\n| Gold Fields of Mysore    | 275,000 |\n| Indian Consolidated      | \u2014       |\n| Kolar Central (East)     | 200,000 |\n| Mysore                   | 250,000 |\n| Mysore Reef              | 200,000 |\n| Mysore West              | \u00a3150,000|\n| Mysore Wynaad            | 150,000 |\n| Nine Reefs               | 62,500  |\n| Nundydroog               | 220,000 |\n| South East Mysore        | \u2014       |\n| Urigam (Ooregum)         | 265,000 |\n\nThe original Kolar Concessionaires\u2019 Company has gone into liquidation, and the blocks held by it are either owned by the Companies above mentioned or sub-leased to the Gold Fields of Mysore Company. Mysore, Urigam, Nundydroog and Champion Reef are the only mines where operations have so far been attended with satisfactory results.\n\n**Kuruda-male.**\u2014Or more correctly Ku\u1e0du-male, is the hill 4 miles north-west of Mulbagal, at the foot of which are the ruins of several large temples, with sculpture attributed to Jakanachari, but apparently restored by Ilavanji Raya and his companions from the south, mentioned in the account of Avani. The principal are those of Somesvara and Ganesha. The elevation of the hill is 3,312 feet above the level of the sea. The gods, it is said, on going to make war on Tripura, mustered their forces at this place, whence the name Ku\u1e0du-male or hill of assembly. The Kaundinya, a tributary of the Palar, has its source here, which is said to have been the site of the hermitage of Kaundinya rishi.\n\n**Kushavati.**\u2014There are two streams in the District of this name, one a tributary of the P\u00e1paghni, and the other of the Chitravat\u012b. The former rises from the Vali Isvara hill near the boundary of the Pungan\u00far zamindari, and after forming the Yerak\u00e1lave tank in this District crosses the frontier north-westwards near Mursanpalli. It then goes\nto Tippasandra tank of Madanpalli, in the Kadapa District, and ultimately falls into the P\u00e1paghni.\n\nThe other Kush\u00e1vati rises from Avalu-konda, or cow-hill, to the north of Nandidroog; and, after forming the Bairsagara tank before the town of Gudibanda, runs in a northerly direction, almost parallel to the Bangalore-Bellary high road, and falls into the Chitravati some miles beyond the frontier.\n\n**Madivala.**\u2014There are several places so called in this District, and in the east of the Bangalore District, each of which has a large Siva temple with many inscriptions in Grantha and Tamil characters. The name is a euphemism for a washerman, but seems here to indicate a holy place. The following are those in Kolar District:\n\n| Taluq          | Hobli         | Taluq          | Hobli         |\n|----------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Bowringpet     | Bowringpet    | Kolar          | Vemgai        |\n|                |               |                | Vokkaleri     |\n| Chintamani     | Kyasamballi   |                |               |\n|                | S\u00f3may\u00e1julapalli| M\u00e1kur         | M\u00e1kur         |\n|                | Trugampalli   | Mullagai       | Mallanay\u00e1kanhalli |\n\nThe oldest appears to be the one near M\u00e1kur, which has inscriptions dating in 988; also one of Hoysala Ramanatha, the 13th century. Most of the others have grants either by Chola, Hoysala, or Vijayanagar kings.\n\n**Malur.**\u2014A taluq in the south-west. Area 269 square miles. Head-quarters at M\u00e1kur.

It lies along the watershed separating the valleys of the P\u00e1l\u00e1r and S. Pin\u00e1kini. The elevated tracts are bare or covered with low jungle. The most fertile part extends along the eastern side from Nar\u00e1s\u00e1pura down to M\u00e1sti, through which flow streams which are tributary to the S. Pin\u00e1kini. One\nof these, rising south-west of the Vokkaleri hills, is named the M\u00e1rkanda. There are as many as 385 irrigation tanks, of which 55 are of good size. Excellent potatoes are grown in the taluq. The predominant soil is red, of considerable depth, but much mixed with sand. It is best in M\u00e1lur and Lakk\u00far hoblis, but towards the hills of Naras\u00e1pur and Ty\u00e1kal becomes inferior, changing to grey and falling off in depth. This is the case also in the south, where rocks, moreover, crop up at intervals.\n\nThe taluq is crossed from east to west by the Bangalore Branch of the Madras Railway, which has stations at M\u00e1lur and Ty\u00e1kal. From M\u00e1lur there are roads to Hoskote, to Naras\u00e1pur, to Kolar, to M\u00e1sti, and to Hosur in the Salem District.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1890. The unculturable area is 67,102 acres, or nearly 105 square miles. The area of in\u00e1m villages is 34,353 acres, or 53\u00bd square miles: that of plantations is 1,834 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,26,476, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,47,391. The amounts under Land revenue were Rs. 1,00,590, and Rs. 1,05,520 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall at M\u00e1lur for 25 years (1870\u201394), and at the other station for two years (1893\u20134) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| M\u00e1lur | 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b019 | 0\u00b035 | 0\u00b086 | 3\u00b089 | 2\u00b005 | 2\u00b060 | 4\u00b018 | 6\u00b002 | 5\u00b018 | 2\u00b024 | 0\u00b040...27\u00b098 |\n| Narasapur | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0\u00b048 | 2\u00b020 | 5\u00b020 | 3\u00b095 | 3\u00b068 | 4\u00b071 | 4\u00b009 | 5\u00b015 | 2\u00b013 | 0\u00b010...31\u00b069 |\n\n**Malur.**\u2014A town 18 miles south-west of Kolar, on the Bangalore Branch Railway.

In the 16th century it was one of the possessions of Timme Gauda, the chief of Hoskote. From him it was captured by the Bijapur army and held as a j\u00e1gir by several mansubdars. Subsequently it was farmed from the\nMahrattas by Hrida R\u00e1m Singh, a Rajput zamindar, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Melur. His descendants continued in possession until the subjection of the country by Haidar Ali.\n\nBy road it is connected with Hoskote on the north-west, with Kolar on the north-east, and with Hosur in the Salem District on the south. Also with Nars\u00e1pur and M\u00e1sti.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 1,022  | 945    | 990    | 1,550  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 1,257  | 1,389  | 1,370  | 2,288  |\n\nManchenhalli.\u2014A village in the Goribidnur taluq, on the right bank of the N.

He was summoned to Vijayanagar, where, having rendered some important military service, he was confirmed by Achyuta Raya in the possession of a territory yielding a revenue of 20,000 pagodas, and made M\u00e1sti his capital. His successors subsequently acquired Ankusgiri, with which the family became identified. On the capture of Kolar by the Mahrattas, M\u00e1sti was united to Hoskote and shared in the after fortunes of the District, until annexed to Mysore by the conquests of Haidar Ali.\n\nMelur.\u2014A village in the Sidlaghatta hobli, of the Sidlaghatta taluq, about 6 miles south of the kasba.

Excepting the range of hills extending north from Mulbagal, the taluq is well cultivated, especially eastwards towards Nangali. The chief feature of the taluq is the quantity of rock cropping up everywhere in the shape of rocky hills and hillocks, composed of loose boulders of gneiss. Large boulders are promiscuously scattered about everywhere, and masses of sheet rock all over the country. There are some rocky hills of considerable altitude near Mulbagal and Avani. The watershed runs nearly north and south through the centre of the taluq, the fall of the land to the west being gentle and to the east abrupt and steep. To the west there are rolling downs, broad valleys, and generally shallow tanks; to the east there are narrow valleys, deep tanks, much broken ground and rocky ridges. The number of tanks, large and small, is no less than 460. Irrigation from tanks is greatly supplemented by water from wells, which are usually open pits, only built up with stone where the y\u00e1ta is placed, and with the water close to the surface, often flush with it.\n\nThe dry crop soil is generally poor, grey and sandy. In the wet lands there is much sand and clay, and efflorescence of potash is not uncommon.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1887. The unculturable\narea is 108,125 acres, or nearly 169 square miles. The area of in\u00e1m villages is 22,970 acres, or nearly 35 square miles. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,66,265, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,00,987. The amounts under land revenue were Rs. 1,29,519 and Rs. 1,47,931 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall at Mulbagal for 25 years (1870\u201394) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0'15 | 0'16 | 0'44 | 0'83 | 3'20 | 2'78 | 2'72 | 4'35 | 4'14  | 5'61 | 4'90 | 1'16 | ... 30'44 |\n\nMulbagal\u2014or more properly Mudla-b\u00e1galu, eastern gate, so called from being situated at the eastern pass from the table-land of Mysore to the temple of Tirupati. The name also appears as Muluv\u00e1yi in old inscriptions, which conveys the same meaning. It is an important town, 18 miles east-north-east of Kolar, on the old Bangalore-Madras road by the Mugli pass. Head-quarters of the Mulbagal taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus             | 1,592  | 1,812    | 3,404  |\n| Muhammadans       | 829    | 782      | 1,611  |\n| Christians         | 11     | \u2014        | 11     |\n| **Total**         | **2,432** | **2,594** | **5,026** |\n\nSome ancient temples exist near the town, and the tomb of a saint named Haidar Wali attracts great numbers of Muhammadans to the place on the celebration of his anniversary. Pilgrims to Tirupati who pass through Mulbagal from all the western countries go through the preliminary ceremony of purification by shaving their heads and bathing in a pond named Narsimha tirtha. Sugar cane and fine paddy are cultivated in the neighbourhood, Mulbagal sugar and Mulbagal rice being esteemed the best in the District. The former is prepared by Musalmans employed by Brahmins.\n\nThe taluq formed part of the Mah\u00e1vali or B\u00e1na territory from early in the Christian era. Towards the close of the 10th century the Pallavas became the overlords, and the Vaidumbas held some of the north. It was the seat of government for the Kolar country when first brought under the sway of the Vijayanagar kings, who were represented by two officers named Lakkana Dan\u00e1yak and M\u00e1dana Dan\u00e1yak. It subsequently came under the control of Timme Gauda of Hoskote, and shared in the fortunes of the District as elsewhere related. It was\nbesieged by the British in June 1768, under Colonel Campbell, and betrayed by the killedar. The British field deputies afterwards took it upon them to put Muhammad Ali's troops in charge, who, in their turn, again betrayed it to Haidar. But it was recovered in October by Colonel Wood, who, after very severe fighting amidst the congeries of granite rocks and boulders scattered over the whole surface of the plain, defeated all the efforts of Haidar and his vastly superior force to prevent its recapture.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | ...     | 1,846   | 1,883   | 2,029   | 3,532   |\n| Expenditure      | ...     | 2,600   | 1,944   | 2,466   | 4,205   |\n\n**Nandi.**\u2014A village in the Chik-Ballapur taluq, at the north-eastern base of Nandidroog. Head-quarters of the Nandi hobli. Population 997.\n\nIt contains a large temple dedicated to Bhoga Nandisvara, which is surrounded with Chola inscriptions in the Grantha character. The foundation of the village is attributed to Baire Gauda of Avati, but the temple is much older. A Pallava and several Chola inscriptions are in the court yard. The village was for some years a British military station, till the troops were removed in 1808. Writing in 1809, Colonel Welsh says:\u2014\"The Pettah (that is, the present Sultanpet) is extensive, and was formerly connected with the foot of the hill by a line of works and deep ditch, now out of repair and useless; it had very good bazars in it, and the place altogether is famous for the best potatoes and soft sugar in the Peninsula; while the gardens abound in almost every fruit and vegetable of Europe and Asia combined.\" A large annual fair takes place at the Sivar\u00e1tri festival, attended by 20,000 people. The best bullocks reared in the country are brought for sale then, and as much as Rs. 1,000 is said to have been offered for a pair of draught bullocks. A cattle show was held by Government at this season for several years, and prizes were distributed, but in 1874 the show was transferred to Bangalore.\n\n**Nandidroog (Nundydroog).**\u2014A famous fortified hill in the Chik-Ballapur taluq, 31 miles north of Bangalore, at the termination of a range of mountains, of which it is the highest point, running north to Penugonda and the Bellary District. There is an extensive plateau at the top, sloping to the west, in the centre of which is a large hollow, containing a wood and a well-constructed tank, called the Amrita-sarovara or lake of nectar, fed by perennial springs. The four sides\nare built round with stone steps, which diminish as they descend, until they meet in a point at the bottom, where there is a small shrine.\n\nFrom the earliest period, and throughout their time, the Gangas had the title \"Lord of Nandagiri,\" and the hill was then a Jain place. Owing to subsequent changes, and the extensive quarrying of stone in recent times for the fortifications and buildings, all traces of this have disappeared, except perhaps the name Sravana-tirtha, given to a deserted and now inaccessible well at the edge of the precipice on the south. But in the Gopinatha hill, on the north-east, is an ancient Jain inscription, whose opening words are like those of the Ganga grants, and which claims that the chaitya there was founded by R\u00e1ma, the son of Das'aratha, and subsequently repaired by Kunti, the mother of the P\u00e1ndus! The name Nandagiri (hill of pleasure) was changed to Nandigiri (hill of Nandi, the bull of S'iva) in the 11th century, under the Cholas. As the Jain inscription above-mentioned begins by invoking the first Tirthankara, Vrishabha, whose name means bull, this may have helped towards suggesting the appellation. That the Sivites at once appropriated the hill is evident from the old inscription in the cave near the Bull temple (Nellik\u00e1yi Basava) on a ledge on the east, which records that a Saiva ascetic from Sriparvata took up his abode there. The situation of the well before spoken of, as well as that of the original entrance to the temple, may indicate that the tremendous fracture and landslip which produced the perpendicular precipice on this side as it is now, strewing the saddle below with immense boulders and laying bare in the middle of its face the great cavern known as the Asura cave and the Tiger cave, may have occurred after this period. There is evidence that the present Bhoga Nandis'vara temple, at the village of Nandi, near the north-eastern base, has been in existence from Pallava, Chola and Hoysala times; and the Yoga Nandis'vara temple at the summit must be at least as old. On the latter is an inscription of the end of the 11th century, which states that a robber chief then ascended the hill, with a force, in order to seize the hidden treasure supposed to be there, but did not succeed. On the Vira-bhadra temple under the cliff, near one of the gateways on the north, below the Sheristadar's house, is an inscription showing that it was in existence at the end of the 14th century.\n\nThe hill was probably first fortified by the Chik-Ballapur chiefs, but the extensive fortifications whose ruins now surround the summit were erected by Haidar Ali and Tipu Sultan, after its seizure by the Mahrattas under Madhu Rao in 1770. A precipitous cliff at the south-west angle is pointed out as Tipu's Drop, being the place over which prisoners are said to have been hurled by the orders of that\nruler. Haidar's Drop is on a small hill to the north, near the village of Nandi. Beneath the cliff over which prisoners were thrown is a cave in which many Europeans were confined. This is the place described in Meadows Taylor's *Tipoo Sultaun*.\n\nThis formidable stronghold, Nandidroog, was captured by the British army under Lord Cornwallis in 1791. The siege and assault, which were under the command of Major Gowdie, are thus described by Wilks.\n\nEvery fortified place the English had hitherto seen in Mysore exhibited evidence of the extraordinary attention paid by Tipu Sultan to the repair and improvement of this important branch of national defence, but the works of Nandidroog, a granite rock of tremendous height, seemed to have engrossed in a peculiar degree his design of rendering it impregnable; and its defence was committed to Latf Ali Beg, an officer who had always merited the highest distinction both from Haidar and Tipu. There was no choice with regard to the face to be attacked, because except on the west the precipice was inaccessible. That point had been strengthened by a double line of ramparts; and the foundation was laid for a third, which ultimately aided the assailants in forming their last lodgment. The defence was highly respectable; the ammunition of the cannon was well reserved, and the jinjals, or wall-pieces, were served with peculiar steadiness and skill; the labour was excessive of working regularly up the face of a steep and craggy mountain to breaching distance, and dragging cannon to the batteries; but in twenty-one days two breaches were effected; one in the exterior rampart, and the other in an outwork, and it was resolved to give the assault and form a lodgment for the farther operations against the interior works. The assailants received, however, a particular direction for endeavouring to enter with the fugitives, while the division allotted to forming the lodgment should be employed in providing cover; and in order that every possible impression might be made on the minds of the garrison Lord Cornwallis moved the army to the immediate vicinity: some additional flank companies were ordered in to lead the assault, and General Medows, with the usual spirit which animated him on such occasions, desired to take the immediate direction of the service.\u00b9\n\nThe assault was given by clear moonlight on the morning of the 19th of October; the arrangements of defence were excellent, and particularly the masses of granite reserved till this period to be rolled down the rock with tremendous effect, but the lodgment was within one hundred yards of the breach, and although the garrison was perfectly alert, the ardour and rapidity of the assailants surmounted every obstacle, and they pressed the fugitives so closely as to prevent their effectually barricading the gate of the inner rampart. It was forced after a sharp conflict, and the place\n\n\u00b9 Shortly before the assault, while all were waiting the signal in silence, one of the soldiers inadvertently whispered something about a mine. \"To be sure there is,\" said General Medows, \"and it is a mine of gold;\" a smothered laugh ran along the ranks and produced the proper impression.\nwas carried with the loss in the assault of only thirty killed and wounded, chiefly by the stones tumbled down the rock, and in the whole siege one hundred and twenty.\n\nA regiment was stationed at the foot, between Nandi and Sultanpet, from 1799 to 1808. It was during this period that the fruit-garden near the large tank was planted by Colonel Cuppage. The present dwelling houses on the droog were erected in about 1848\\(^1\\), the remains of an old tower or fort on the highest point being removed for the site of the principal one. The salubrity of the spot led to its becoming a resort in the hot season for European officials from Bangalore, and the large house at the summit was long the favourite retreat of Sir Mark Cubbon. The temperature, especially at nights, is on the average ten degrees cooler than that of the plain 1,800 feet below. Except on the west, where it is united to a certain height with the adjoining range, Nandidroog presents an almost perpendicular rocky face. The present name is composed of *Nandi*, the sacred bull of Siva, and *durga*, hill fort. The principal old pilgrim ascent was by regularly formed steps beginning on the north side, and continuing on the west, connecting the temple in the village below with the temple at the top. The steps have now been taken entirely up the north side. A bridle path has since been carried from the bottom of the saddle on the south up the western face, the ascent by which is 4 miles long. At one point another bridle path meets it from the Basavan Kanive, or Bull pass, on the north-west, where there is a large stone bull. A rude flight of steps on the south side, known as the coolie path, forms a short cut for pedestrians. There is also a very steep foot path from the north-east angle.\n\nThe summit, 4,851 feet above the level of the sea, commands an extensive view over the Kolar and Bangalore Districts, the hundreds of shining tanks scattered over the country, of which it is said 400 can be counted, forming a marked feature in the scene. Kalavara-durga or Skandagiri (4,749 feet) is a conspicuous height on the north, formerly fortified. Brahma-giri or Varg-konda (4,657 feet) on the south-west, and Chenna-Kesava or Chenna-Rayan betta (4,762 feet) on the north-west, are partially connected with Nandidroog. The following rivers radiating in all directions have their sources in either this hill or those in the immediate neighbourhood. The Northern Penn\u00e1r or Uttara Pin\u00e1kini rises on the north-west in Chenna Kesava-betta, and can be traced for a long distance through the Manchenhalli\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) By Colonel Hill (Glentilt), Sir Mark Cubbon, and his Secretary, Captain Cunningham (Oaklands); also one lower down, by his Sheristadar, between the inner and outer fortifications, looking over the pass.\nvalley to Goribidnur. The Southern Penn\u00e1r or Dakshina Pin\u00e1kini rises in the same hill, and flows south through the large Jangamkote and Hoskote tanks. The Arkavati rises in a well on the south-west of Nandidroog, between the two lines of fortification, and flows south-west to Dod-Ballapur. The P\u00e1l\u00e1r is said to rise in the well near the eastern summit. On the north-east the P\u00e1paghni and Chitravati may be discerned, the former of which rises in Kalavara-durga, and the latter in the Harihares\u2019vara hill.\n\nOn the first heavy fall of rain following upon a long period of dry weather, myriads of lights are seen at night along the valley of the Northern Penn\u00e1r, and towards the north, resembling the lamps in the streets of a great city\u2014a phenomenon which has not been satisfactorily explained.\\(^1\\) In the large cave on the south, almost inaccessible, black tourmaline is found in considerable quantities. The forest surrounding the mountain, as well as that on the neighbouring hills, is reserved by the State. It contains an occasional cheeta or panther, and numbers of wild pig; also pea-fowl and jungle-fowl.\n\n**Nangali.**\u2014A village in Mulbagal taluq, close to the eastern frontier, on the Kolar-Chittur road. Population 1,124.\n\nIt was an important frontier station from the time of the Hoysalas in the twelfth century, and is constantly enumerated among the conquests of Vishnuvardhana. Some large tanks exist in the neighbourhood.\n\n**Palar.**\u2014A river said to rise in a well near the summit of Nandidroog on the east, where the water of the little spring reputed as the immediate source used formerly to flow, as in the natural way, through a small stone bull, since mutilated. If however this be accepted as the source, it follows that the stream must at some point cross the S. Pin\u00e1kini\u2014a difficulty which the natives easily set aside by the hypothesis, for which there is no evidence, that it runs underground at that place. The river more probably springs from the neighbourhood of Kaivara, to the west of Ambajidurga and Rahmanghur. It first becomes visible, it is said, at Gautama gudda, a small hill southward of Kaivara. From Jangamkote it flows eastward, until ten miles\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) By some they are called corpse candles. Others consider them to be (and this seems the right explanation) the lights of the villagers used in the capture of the winged white ants, which issue from the ground at such times in countless profusion and are cooked and eaten by the lower orders as a great delicacy. Large coops of open wicker work are placed around the holes, surmounted by torches formed of the stem of an inferior kind of sugar cane. The insects, attracted by the light, fall in thousands into the hollows scooped below, where, as their wings drop off, they remain heaped together till gathered up.\n\nMr. Walhouse has suggested that the effect may be due to the mole cricket (*gryllotalpa vulgaris*), which emits a light that is often confounded with the *ignis fatuus*. *Ind. Ant.* IV, 47.\nbeyond Kolar, at the village of Yenandahalli, it receives an important tributary and directs its course south-south-east. Flowing through the Bowringpet taluq, where it forms the large Betamangala and Ramasagara tanks, it leaves the Mysore and enters North Arcot, near the village of Gundlapalli in the Kangundi zamindari. Running southwards to the west of Kangundi, it bends to the north-east past Vaniambadi and flows through the North Arcot and Chingleput Districts, passing Vellore, Arcot and Kanchivaram (or Conjeveram), and falls into the Bay of Bengal south of Sadras.\n\nThe name P\u00e1l-\u00e1ir, which means milk river, is rendered in Sanskrit into Kshira-nadi, the designation of the stream in the puranas. Its length in the District is about 47 miles, the entire drainage of its catchment basin, or 1,036 square miles, being utilized for cultivation.\n\n**Papaghni.**\u2014An affluent of the N. Pinakini. It rises in Kalavardurga or Skandagiri, north of Nandidroog, and taking a north-easterly course, flows through the Bagepalli taluq into the Kadapa District, where, after forming the Vyasa-samudram and other large tanks, it unites with the N. Pinakini near Kamalapur. The name P\u00e1pa-ghni, signifying sin-destroyer in Sanskrit, denotes the purifying efficacy of its waters. A dam is carried across the stream near Burudukunte, whereby irrigation is provided for 180 acres of land. The famous large tank of Vyasa-samudram is a few miles below this point, on the Kadapa frontier, and is said to have been constructed by Vyasa Rayaswami, the guru of the Madhva Brahmins. The discharge of the stream in maximum flood has been gauged as 5,244 cubic feet per second.\n\n**Pinakini.**\u00b9\u2014The Northern or Uttara Pin\u00e1kini, the Northern Penn\u00e1r of European geographers, rises in the Chenna Kesava hill, north-west of Nandidroog, and flowing north-west past the town of Goribidnur, enters the Penugonda taluq of the Anantapur District. Thence, crossing a projecting angle of Pavugada taluq, it re-enters the Anantapur District and, turning eastward, passes through the Kadapa and Nellore Districts, finally discharging its waters into the Bay of Bengal near the town of Nellore.\n\nIts principal tributaries from this District are the P\u00e1paghni and the Chitravati. The total length of the main river and its chief affluents within the Province has been estimated at 167 miles, with a catchment basin of 2,280 square miles, of the drainage of which 85\u00b735 per cent. has been intercepted for purposes of cultivation.\n\nFrom an inscription at Kallodi we learn that the water supply of Penugonda was drawn from this part of the river. Bukka Raya, the son of Harihara Raya, ordered his chief engineer, Singaya Bhatta, in\n\n\u00b9 For S. Pin\u00e1kini see Bangalore District.\n1389 to \"bring the Henne river (the Penn\u00e1r or Henn\u00e1r) to Penugonda.\" And he accordingly led a channel, remains of which may still be seen, to the Siruvara tank, naming it the Prat\u00e1pa Bukka R\u00e1ya channel.\n\n**Rahman Ghur.**\u2014A conspicuous hill-fort in Chintamani taluq, rising to 4,227 feet above the level of the sea, which surrendered to the British in 1791. A large boulder on the western side near Kaivara, is crossed by belts of a brown colour, and from a crevice in the side a liquid resembling blood is said to issue at the time of Sivar\u00e1tri, which kites and crows eagerly eat. The story is that Bhima, one of the Pandu brothers, imprisoned a giant under the mountain, who yearly turns upon his side and causes his wounds to bleed afresh. Tipu Sultan, mortified at the capture by the British of Nandidroog, which he had deemed impregnable, proposed to abandon it and strengthen Rahmanghur instead, but the design was not carried out.\n\n**Sadali.**\u2014A village in the north-west of the Sidlaghatta taluq, 18 miles north of the kasba, on the road to Bagepalli. Population 1,145.\n\nA great antiquity is attributed to this village. It is said to have been founded by Sahadeva, the youngest of the Pandu brothers, and thence called Sahadeva-patna, since abbreviated into S\u00e1dahalli or S\u00e1dali. The spot was selected by Saka risli, whom he had come to visit, and with whom he had an interview where Gumnayakanpalya now stands. The village changed hands several times until annexed to the Sira suba and bestowed as a j\u00e1gir on two Muhammadan chiefs, who, to prevent its falling a conquest to the Kadapa navab, privately disposed of it, about 1459, to Dodda Baiche Gauda of Chik-Ballapur.\n\n**Sidlaghatta.**\u2014A taluq in the centre towards the north.

The S. Pin\u00e1kini drains the south-west angle and forms two large tanks at the kasba. The northern parts of the taluq, marking the continuation of the Dongala-konda hills, are stony and rugged. The remaining parts are fertile and well cultivated. In the former the dry crop soils are, as a rule, poor and stony or sandy. In the vicinity of the rivers, however, black soil is not uncommon. To the south of Sidlaghatta the dry crop soil is usually reddish, of fair quality. The irrigated lands are generally superior, rich brown loam being very common. Wet cultivation receives special attention in the north, and the abundance of honge trees there (pongamia glabra) provide, in their leaves and branches, the manure required for the rice-fields. In the south, on the contrary, ragi is the staple crop, but potatoes also occupy a considerable area, as well as sugar-cane. The manufactures consist principally of ordinary women\u2019s cloths, cumblies, glass bangles, sack cloth, and thread.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1885. The unculturable area is 130,290 acres, or 203\u00bd square miles. The area of inam villages is 31,011 acres, or nearly 48\u00bd square miles; that of forests is 1,157 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,58,370, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,00,238. The amounts under land revenue were Rs. 1,21,798 and Rs. 1,44,190 respectively.\n\nThe average rainfall for twenty-five years (1870\u201394) at Sidlaghatta, and for two years (1893\u20134) at Jangamkote was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Sidlaghatta... | 0\u00b001 | 0\u00b006 | 0\u00b058 | 0\u00b067 | 2\u00b099 | 2\u00b084 | 2\u00b085 | 3\u00b087 | 4\u00b071 | 5\u00b057 | 2\u00b090 | 0\u00b069 | 27\u00b074 |\n| Jangamkote . | \u2014    | \u2014    | \u2014    | \u2014    | 0\u00b097 | 2\u00b098 | 3\u00b009 | 2\u00b060 | 3\u00b019 | 1\u00b097 | 5\u00b074 | 1\u00b098 | \u2014    | 22\u00b056 |\n\nFrom Sidlaghatta there are roads west to Chik-Ballapur, east to Chintamani, and south to Jangamkote and Hoskote. The Bangalore-Kadapa high road passes through the south-east angle and the Chintamani-Bagepalli road crosses through the taluq a little above the middle.

His father, named Kempe Gauda, appears to have been an outlaw from Ujanipatna, who, with a band of freebooters, settled at Abalod, north of Sidlaghatta. The gang were captured during some depredations near Vellore and put to death. Shivangi Gauda extended his power on all sides from Sidlaghatta by conquest, and his family held possession for 87 years. The Mahrattas then subdued and held it for 45 years, when it was taken by the Mughals. It afterwards again became subject to the Mahrattas, who sold it to Anni Gauda, the chief of Chik-Ballapur.\n\nFor about five miles round Sidlaghatta there occurs a kind of laterite, called chatitu, which differs from ordinary laterite in allowing of the growth of large trees, as on a hill south of the town. Reduced to clay it forms a very durable plastering for walls, and applied to roofs makes them permanently watertight.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | ...     | 2,811   | 2,807   | 2,823   | 4,351   |\n| Expenditure      | ...     | 5,765   | 4,567   | 3,594   | 5,911   |\n\n**Siti-betta.**\u2014A hill in the Vemgal hobli, Kolar taluq.

The taluq is bounded on the north and north-east by ranges of hills connected with the Eastern Ghats, among which are situated the two clusters of hills enclosing the elevated picturesque valleys of Mudimadagu and Sunnakal. The former is a circular basin, inaccessible on all sides except at the north and south, where there are passes leading to the country around. The village of Mudimadagu is situated in the centre of the valley, and some twenty villages in other parts of it. The group to the south also forms a circle, in the middle of which stands the village of Sunnakal. The only outlet now used is towards the west. There are four villages in the valley, and the scenery here is described as more picturesque than at Mudimadagu. Both these groups of hills are covered with thick jungle, and have been the strongholds of petty chiefs who held sway over the surrounding country. From the neighbourhood of Yeldur commence the low flat hills which indicate the auriferous tract extending to the southernmost limits of the District. Further description is included in that of Chintamani taluq.\n\nThe average rainfall at Srinivasapur for twenty-five years (1870-94) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0.03 | 0.46 | 0.43 | 0.71 | 2.76 | 2.38 | 2.61 | 4.03 | 5.85  | 5.21 | 2.98 | 0.36 | 27.51 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Kadapa road runs through the taluq in a north-east direction, and is joined at Tadgol by a road from Kolar through Srinivasapur. The Mulbagal-Chintamani road also passes through Srinivasapur. The Madanapalli and Chinna-Tippasamudram stations of the South Indian Railway from Vellore to Dharmavaram are close to the north-east angle of the taluq.\n\n**Srinivasapur.**\u2014A town 15 miles north-north-east of Kolar, with which it is connected by road.

The Divan Purnaiya, when he visited the place on his\nreturn from a pilgrimage to Tirupati, gave it the present name, calling it after his son Srinivasa Murti. Rough bits for horses and other articles of iron are manufactured here.\n\nAt Gulgampode, about two miles to the east, is pointed out the site of an ancient city, said to have been called Haralukote. Two Mahavali inscriptions, of the time of Banarasa and Vikramaditya, were excavated by me there some years ago,\u00b9 and a Pallava inscription dating in 768 was also found.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 874    | 825    | 920    | 1,566  |\n| Expenditure    | 1,355  | 1,103  | 967    | 1,628  |\n\nVanarasi.\u2014A village in the Holur hobli of Kolar taluq, seven miles north of Kolar.

Pinakini. It rises from the east of the Vokkaleri hills, passes by Sulikunte, and crosses the railway at the Bowringpet station. It then feeds the tank of Kuppam, and passing by Kendoti, leaves the District three miles beyond it. The stream descends into the plains by the Singarlapalli pass, receives the waters of the Markanda near Ankusgiri, and falls into the S. Pinakini near Krishnagiri.\n\n\u00b9 See Ind. Ant. X., 36. This was, I believe, the first discovery of the Mahavali or Bana dynasty.\nTUMKUR DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014A District in the centre and north-east, situated between $12^\\circ 15'$ and $14^\\circ 15'$ north latitude, and between $76^\\circ 30'$ and $77^\\circ 25'$ east longitude. Its extreme length is from north to south 96 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 69 miles.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 4,154 square miles; of which 1,667 square miles are under cultivation, and 1,604 square miles unculturable.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by the Anantapur District of the Madras Presidency, on the east by the Kolar and Bangalore Districts, on the south by the Mysore District, and on the west by the Chitaldroog, Kadur and Hassan Districts.\n\nDivisions.\u2014It is subdivided into the following taluqs. The sub-taluqs are: Huliy\u00e1r, included in Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli; Korat\u00edgere, in Maddagiri; and Turuvekere, in Tipt\u00far.\n\n| No. | Taluq.            | Area in sq. miles. | No. of Hoblis. | No. of Villages or Towns. | Population in 1891. |\n|-----|------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------------|---------------------|\n| 1   | Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli | 532                | 7              | 279                      | 51,620              |\n| 2   | Gubbi            | 552                | 8              | 421                      | 73,570              |\n| 3   | Kunigal          | 381                | 7              | 291                      | 66,502              |\n| 4   | Maddagiri        | 596                | 11             | 483                      | 97,973              |\n| 5   | P\u00e1vugada         | 532                | 7              | 145                      | 53,377              |\n| 6   | Sira             | 599                | 8              | 253                      | 68,327              |\n| 7   | Tipt\u00far           | 510                | 9              | 391                      | 78,867              |\n| 8   | Tumk\u00far           | 452                | 9              | 473                      | 90,782              |\n|     | Total            | 4,154              | 66             | 2,736                    | 581,018             |\n\nGubbi is the former Kadaba taluq; and Tipt\u00far, the former Honnavalli taluq. P\u00e1vugada taluq, which is separated from the rest by the intervening Madaksira taluq of the Madras Presidency, was transferred to this District from Chitaldroog in 1882. It was in the same year that the sub-taluqs were formed.\n\nPhysical Features.\u2014A considerable range of hills, forming the eastern boundary of the Krishna river system in Mysore, runs north\nand south through the eastern parts of the District. Entering its limits from the north, with K\u00e1mandurga (3,537 feet) and Ni\u1e0dugal (3,485 feet) in P\u00e1vugada taluq, it is continued by Midagesi-durga (3,414 feet), and includes the prominent peaks of Maddagiri-durga (3,935 feet), Channar\u00e1yan-durga (3,744 feet), Koratigiri (2,906 feet), Devar\u00e1yadurga (3,940 feet), Nijagal (3,569 feet), Hutari-durga (3,713 feet), and Huliyur-durga (3,086 feet). It is a part of the range running through the west of the Bangalore District, represented by Sivaganga and S\u00e1vandurga.\n\nThe streams issuing from these hills are of small size, the principal being the Jayamangali, which rises in Devar\u00e1yadurga and flows northeast into the N. Pin\u00e1kini; and the Shimsha, which rises to the south of the same hill and flows southwards towards the K\u00e1veri. The N. Pin\u00e1kini has a course of only a few miles across the extreme northeast corner of the District, in the P\u00e1vugada taluq.\n\nWest of the chain of hills above mentioned, a low range, commencing near Kibbanhalli, runs north-west past Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli and connects with the central belt of the Chitaldroog District. The watershed separating the river system of the Krishna northwards from that of the K\u00e1veri southwards may be defined by a line drawn east and west from Koratigere to Tipt\u00far; while the main chain of mountains forms the western limit of the upper N. Pin\u00e1kini basin.\n\nThe open parts of the District maintain a generally even level above the sea, the height at Tumk\u00far being 2,678 feet. At Kunigal it has been determined as 2,520 feet; at Kibbanhalli it is 2,734, at Maddagiri 2,462, east of Holuvanhalli 2,479. But the situation of S\u00edra is much lower, being only 2,160 feet above the sea. This depression is evident to the eye from the neighbourhood of the Shibi temple.\n\nThe southern taluqs, except around Huliyurdurga, where the country is wooded and hilly, consist of undulating plains, interspersed with clumps of tall and well-grown trees, where stone is scarce, except on occasional ridges or hillocks. Cocoanut and other palms are confined to the vicinity of tanks. Farther north, large plantations of cocoanuts occupy even the dry lands, especially in Gubbi, Tipt\u00far and Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli taluqs. After crossing Tumk\u00far eastwards, the park-like appearance of that taluq changes, north of Devar\u00e1yadurga, to the scenery of a hill country intersected by cultivated valleys: the hills and their skirts being for the most part covered with shrubs, interspersed with trees which remain verdant through the greater part of the year.\n\nTo the north-east extends a very fertile tract, irrigated from perennial springs, reached at a depth of only a few feet below the surface. These\nsprings, called *talpargis*, form a marked and peculiar feature of the Maddagiri taluq, as well as of the adjoining taluqs of the Madras Presidency. The water obtained from the spring-heads is either conducted directly by narrow channels to the fields, or a *kapile* well is constructed, from which the water is raised by two or four bullocks. Where the soil is not sandy, springs may be tapped at short distances from each other.\n\n**Rocks.**\u2014The majority of the rocks are similar in formation to those of the Bangalore District. But near Sir\u00e1 westwards the stratified hills make their appearance, running in straight lines in various directions. They are quite bare of trees, but in the wet season have a green appearance from the long hill grass (*anthistiria barbata*), which is almost the only vegetation that grows on them. These hills are mostly covered at top with a kind of magnetic iron-stone, that withstands the decomposing powers of the air and water much longer than the lower parts of the hills, which seem to be composed of ferruginous slate clay.\n\nIn the south-west, near Turuvckere, is a celebrated quarry, situated in Karekal-gudda, a ridge about half a mile long, a hundred yards wide, and from twenty to fifty feet in perpendicular height. This ridge runs nearly north and south in the common direction of the strata of the country, and is surrounded on all sides by the common gray granite, which, as usual, is intersected in all directions by veins of quartz and felspar; but neither of these enter the quarry. The stone is called *kare-kallu* or black stone by the natives, who give the same appellation to the quartz impregnated with iron, and to the brown h\u00e6matites; and in fact they all run very much into one another, and differ chiefly in the various proportions of the same component parts, but have a certain general similitude easily defined, and are found in similar masses and strata. The black stone of this place is an amorphous hornblend, containing minute but distinct rhomboidal lamellar concretions of basaltine. It is probably the same stone as that which by the ancients was called Basaltes. The surface of the ridge is covered with irregular masses, which, where they have been long exposed to the air, in the natural process of decay lose their angles first. When these masses have thus become rounded, they decay in concentric lamell\u00e6; but where the rock itself is exposed to the air, it separates into plates of various thicknesses nearly vertical and running north and south. In the sound stone there is not the smallest appearance of a slaty texture, and it splits in the wedges in all directions. The north end of the ridge is the lowest, and has on its surface the largest masses, but the natives have always contented themselves with splitting detached blocks and have never ventured\non quarrying the solid rock itself, where much finer pieces might be procured than have ever yet been obtained. The great basava, or bull, at Turuvekere is the finest piece of the wrought rock to be seen, and is exquisitely polished. The pillars of Haidar Ali's mausoleum at Seringapatam are said to have been obtained from here. Very handsome vases might be made of the stone polished. In the same neighbourhood is a quarry of pot stone, which is formed into small vessels and pencils.\n\nIn the hills east of Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli is found a hard whetstone or novaculite, used by natives for polishing diamonds and to compound medicines upon. The auriferous characteristics of the schistose rocks in the Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli band have been described in Vol. I, p.49.\n\n**Metals and Minerals.**\u2014Iron ore is largely obtained from the hill sides in Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli, either upon or at a very small distance below the surface. The metal is also smelted from the black sand brought down by streams from the rocks in Maddagiri and Koratigere. The Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli iron is esteemed the best, and is principally manufactured from the quarries of Dore gudd\u00e1. The h\u00e6matite or limonite obtained in the same neighbourhood is much used by braziers for polishing the utensils made by them. As yellow ochre it furnishes a dye, and is also applied as a colour-wash to walls of houses. Corundum or emery stone is found in small quantities in Turuvekere, and limestone or chunam in most of the taluqs.\n\n**Soils.**\u2014Except the taluqs of Maddagiri, Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli, and the eastern and northern parts of S\u00edra and Koratigere respectively, the soil is described as generally hard and poor, requiring much labour and manure to render it productive. Acres on acres may be seen in some parts on which there is nothing but scattered stunted shrub, without even a blade of grass. This has no reference to the superior land irrigated by tanks, n\u00e1las and spring channels, as these soils of the taluqs above referred to are exceptionally remarkable for their fertility. Pasture land is abundant, but poor, except in the Amrit Mahal k\u00e1v\u00e1ls throughout the District.\n\nThe southern and western taluqs may be described as most abundant in the red soil and contain large tanks. The eastern taluqs abound in sandy soil, the northern contain some black.\n\n**Climate.**\u2014The District generally enjoys the reputation of having an even, pleasant and healthy climate, agreeing alike with natives and Europeans. In the south and south-west the climate greatly resembles that of Bangalore; the high elevation, the red soil, and the greenness of the surface among the hills contributing to moderate the temperature. From S\u00edra northwards the lower level of the country and the\nprevalence of black soil raise the temperature more to that of the adjoining Bellary District. The eastern side of every range of hills is said to be perceptibly warmer than the western.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The following averages are given from observations at Tumk\u00far of the dry bulb thermometer at 9.30 A.M. and 3.30 P.M. during each month of 1873 and 1874. No observations appear to have been made in more recent years. The temperature is thus seen to be tolerably equable. For nine months in the year it is never very unpleasantly hot; the nights in the hottest months are comparatively cool. The hot season is from the middle of February to the middle of May. The average range of the thermometer throughout the year in the observatory at Tumk\u00far was from $74^\\circ$ to $83^\\circ$ at noon.\n\n| Months       | 1873          | 1874          |\n|--------------|---------------|---------------|\n|              | 9.30 A.M.     | 3.30 P.M.     | 9.30 A.M.     | 3.30 P.M.     |\n| January      | ...           | 68            | 71            | 73            | 75            |\n| February     | ...           | 75            | 79            | 80            | 82            |\n| March        | ...           | 79            | 84            | 84            | 86            |\n| April        | ...           | 79            | 84            | 87            | 88            |\n| May          | ...           | 81            | 84            | 78            | 81            |\n| June         | ...           | 76            | 80            | 75\u00bd           | 76\u00bd           |\n| July         | ...           | 73\u00bd           | 77            | 73            | 74\u00be           |\n| August       | ...           | 72            | 77\u00bd           | 73            | 74\u00bd           |\n| September    | ...           | 72\u00bd           | 78            | 71\u00bd           | 73            |\n| October      | ...           | 73            | 75            | 72\u00bd           | 74\u00bd           |\n| November     | ...           | 74            | 78            | 72            | 74            |\n| December     | ...           | 72            | 74            | 69            | 71            |\n\nRainfall.\u2014The average annual rainfall, calculated on the amount registered in each year at Tumk\u00far from 1837 to 1874, was 32\u00b77 inches, falling on from 40 to 50 days. The average, calculated on 25 years' rainfall from 1870 to 1894, is 37\u00b736.

Farther north the hills around Koratigere are clothed with good fuel jungle. Near Maddagiri the vegetation improves in appearance and variety. On the western range of hills running north from Kibbanhalli, there is a forest of karachi (hardwickia binata), extending from Bukkapatna northwards to Gangarapente.\n\nThe following are the reserved or State forests in the District:\n\n| Sq. m. | Sq. m. |\n|--------|--------|\n| Devarayadurga ... ... ... 30 | Huliyurdurga ... ... ... 30 |\n| Maddagiri... ... ... ... 32 | Kudare-kanave ... ... ... 21 |\n| Bukkapatna ... ... ... 50 | Kemlapura ... ... ... 1\u00bd |\n\nThere are also nine Forest plantations, covering 963 acres, and three Revenue plantations. Of these, three are for sandal, and the others for casuarina and cassia.\n\nThe best wooded taluqs are those which include the great eastern range of hills\u2014namely, Tumkur, Koratigere, Maddagiri, and the old Huliyurdurga taluq. In these, too, sandal grows. The south-western taluqs are well occupied with trees in topes, and such as have planted themselves in valleys and hedges. Cocoanut gardens are numerous, and in some parts the *butea frondosa* grows abundantly in waste lands. The north and centre of the Sira taluq is badly supplied with wood, but the wild custard-apple grows in profusion in the plains.\n\nWith the exceptions above noted the tree vegetation resembles that of the adjoining Districts on the east.\n\nCultivation.\u2014A list will be given below of the principal crops raised in the District by dry cultivation, as well as of the garden produce of irrigated grounds. Lands are generally manured to the extent of the annual collections of manure and refuse in the house or cattle yard of each landholder. Near large towns, or where municipalities are established, town refuse is freely bought and sells well.\n\nManure is conveyed to the fields on platform carts surmounted with large wicker baskets, or in gunny bags on buffaloes or on men\u2019s heads; and is chiefly composed, in addition to the village and town refuse, of ashes and silt, which are carefully collected in pits and used for the dry lands; while vegetable manure, especially leaves of the shrub karanj, and sheep\u2019s dung are used for wet lands.\nTanks and Wells.\u2014The number of Government tanks in the District is 2,254, of which 605 are classed as large, yielding a revenue of more than Rs. 300. The large one at Kunigal, when full, is 14 miles in circumference. The Maidalada, Kallamballa, Kadaba, Mallaghatta, and Dipambudhi tanks are all large reservoirs, the last-named being about 30 feet deep at the lowest point. Another large tank, recently constructed, is the Borankanave, in Chiknayakanhalli taluq. The number of wells is 13,495. There are also 145 tanks in Inam villages.\n\nCrops.\u2014The cereals, pulses and oil-seeds cultivated are the same as those of the Bangalore District. Cotton and indigo are grown to a small extent in Maddagiri and P\u00e1vugada taluqs.\n\nThe following is a list of miscellaneous products:\n\n| Kannada. | Botanical.       | English.   |\n|----------|------------------|------------|\n| Adike    | Areca catechu    | Areca-nut. |\n| Hoge soppu | Nicotiana tabaccum | Tobacco.   |\n| Kabbu    | Saccharum officinale | Sugar-cane.|\n| Kalle kayi | Arachis hypogea | Ground-nut.|\n| Mensina kayi | Capsicum annum | Chilly.    |\n| Tengina kayi | Cocos nucifera | Cocoanut.  |\n| Uppu N\u00e9rle | Morus            | Mulberry.  |\n| Viled-ele | Piper betle      | Betel vine.|\n\nGarden Produce.\u2014The names of vegetables and fruit raised in the District exhibit the variety of garden produce. Under the former may be mentioned brinjals, cucumbers, pumpkins, onions, garlic, potatoes, cabbages, beans, peas, ginger; the latter includes mangoes, oranges, figs, grapes, apples, peaches, strawberries, gooseberries, loquats, pomegranates, plantains, limes, citron, guavas, &c.\n\nAcreage under principal Crops.\u2014The number of acres under rice cultivation in 1893 was 61,208, wheat 84, ragi 428,864, other food grains 272,622; oil-seeds 38,408, sugar-cane 899, cotton and fibres 3,866, tobacco 2,775, vegetables 26,885, cocoanut and areca-nut 44,756, mulberry 818.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014The larger game is very scarce, and pretty nearly confined to the preserved forest tracts around Devar\u00e1yadurga, where tiger, panther, bear, and wild hog may be met with. In the jungly parts of S\u00edra taluq, deer may sometimes be found and occasional cheetahs. There are also deer about the plantations in Gubbi taluq.\n\nBirds of prey are stated to be very numerous.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014Among bullocks, those of Maddagiri, Turuvekere, and parts of Kadaba are highly esteemed on account of their breed, but the cattle generally resemble those of the other Districts on\nthe east. Buffaloes are commonly used both for agricultural and dairy purposes. Swine are numerous in certain localities. Cows are plentiful, but poor in size, breed, and yield of milk. Sheep are not of the highest quality, but a good breed is met with in Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli and the taluqs to the south and west. Those of Maddagiri, Midagesi and that side are considered less valuable.\n\nHISTORY\n\nOmitting the legends that the Kadaba tank was constructed by the orders of Rama, when encamped in the neighbourhood; that the emperor Nriga was cured of leprosy by bathing in the Nagini, the stream that forms the Kunigal tank; and that Salivahana was born at Hale Tanduga near Turuvekere: the place in this District claiming the highest antiquity is the village of Sampige in Gubbi taluq. It is said to be the site of Champaka-nagara, the capital of Sudhanva, son of a king named Hamsa Dhvaja. There was a Haihaya prince of this name, of whom the following account is given.\u00b9 \u201cTradition asserts that at the end of the Satyayuga a monarch named Sudhyumna presided over the destinies of the East. Of his descendants, one son, Nila Dhwaja, got the throne of Mahishmati; a second, Hamsa Dhwaja, became monarch of Chandrapur; and the third received the kingdom of Ratanpur.\u201d In later times the village of Kaidala near Tumkur is said to have been a large city named Krid\u00e1pura, and the birth-place of the famous sculptor and architect Jakanachari. The legend regarding Devar\u00e1yadurga and its capture from a robber chief, named Andhaka or Lingaka, by Sumati, son of Hemachandra, king of Karnataka, and the subsequent foundation of a city by Sumati near Nelamangala have already been related in connection with the Bangalore District.\n\nGangas.\u2014The Tumkur country was from an early period in possession of the Gangas, and an inscription of the tenth century spells the name as Tummeg\u00edru, which may mean the country of the tumme or tumbe, a common fragrant herb (leucas indica). Among other records of the Gangas, a grant by Nava K\u00e1ma (679-713) was obtained at Hebbur, and inscriptions of Sr\u00edpurusha (726-777) occur at Midagesi, and of Satyav\u00e1kya Nolambakul\u00e1ntaka (963-974) at Kibbanhalli.\n\nNolambas.\u2014The Nolambas or Nonambas, who were of Pallava\n\n\u00b9 Central Provinces Gazetteer, Int., I.\ndescent (see Vol. I, p. 307), have left many memorials throughout the east of the District. They had a capital city at Penje\u1e6du or Henjeru, in Tamil called Pperuncheru, which I have identified with Hemavati, situated on the northern border of Sira taluq, in Madaksira. Its name occurs in a number of professedly very ancient inscriptions, as well as in certain legends, and the existing remains show that it must have been a place of considerable importance. The Nolambas had their stronghold at Nidugal, which is only a few miles to the east, in Pavugada taluq. In the ninth century they were in matrimonial alliance with the Gangas, Nolambadhiraja having married Jayabbe, younger sister of the Ganga king Nitimarga. He also assigned to each of his other queens certain villages in the Sira country. The Nonaba ryots, who are more numerous in this District than anywhere else, are representatives of the subjects of the old Nonamba kingdom, the Nonambavadi Thirty-two Thousand, of which a further account will be found under Chitaldroog District (see also under Gubbi, and Vol. I, p. 230).\n\nHoysalas.\u2014The Hoysalas, whose inscriptions are numerous, succeeded the Gangas, and there are no regular Chola remains in this District. But the Hoysalas subdued Irungola, a chief whose capital was at Henjeu and his stronghold at Nidugal, and the line of kings to which he belonged had the title \"Lords of Oreiyur,\" the ancient Chola capital, now called Warriore, at Trichinopoly, and style themselves Chola kings. They profess to be descended from Karikala Chola, through a king called Mangi or Kali Mangi. His successors were Bebbi or Bichi, Govinda, Irungola (I), Malli Deva or Bhoga, Brahma or Barma, whose wife was Bachala Devi, and their son Irungola (II), called Irungola-Deva Chola-maharaya. A representative of the line, named Vira Bomma, who had a minister Baicheya or Chaicheya, seems to have been still in power at Nidugal in the thirteenth century.\n\nFrom Turuvekere the king Narasimha I appears to have obtained his wife Lokamma or Lokambika, whose name is perpetuated in that of the neighbouring village of Lokammanhalli, granted by her as an endowment to a temple. It is in his reign that we first meet with the singular name Anebiddasari or Anebiddajari, meaning \"the steep where the elephant fell,\" as that of the nad or district which included the Devarayadurga hills and the central and southern parts of the Tumkur taluq. It must have been in use, however, before that, and continued in use during the Vijayanagar period. The steep itself seems to have been on Devarayadurga, at a spot called Anegondi.\n\n1 See my Ep. Carn., Mysore, I, Intro., p. 2, and Coorg Gaz., p. 95.\nWhen, after the death of Somesvara, a partition was made of the Hoysala dominions between his two sons, the share which, along with the Tamil districts, fell to Ramanatha, did not extend west of the Devariyadurga hills, and a line from Urudigere to Hebbur, with one from there east to Lakkur in Malur taluq (Kolar District), would pretty well define the western and southern limits of his territory in the Mysore country.\n\nChalukyas.\u2014The later of the Henjeru Chola inscriptions and the earliest of the Hoysala inscriptions in the District acknowledge the supremacy of the Chalukyas, and the records of this line are met with throughout the western taluqs, Tiptur and Chiknayakanhalli. Under them, the Hoysalas Vinayaditya and Vishnuvardhana (at the beginning of his reign) are represented as ruling over the Gangavadi Ninety-six Thousand, and Narasimha as ruling over both that and the Nonambavadi Thirty-two Thousand.\n\nVijayanagar.\u2014The Vijayanagar empire arose in the fourteenth century and many traces exist of the rule of its kings throughout the District. It was under this sovereignty that several feudatory states arose of local interest.\n\nThe Nidugal chiefs were descended from Harati Tippa Raja or Tippa Nayaka, whose possessions were in the north-east of the Chitaldroog District, under which an account of him will be found. At his death he divided his territory among his seven sons. But on the invasion of the country by the Bijapur army, the descendants of these were driven out of their estates, and Timmanna Nayak, who had lost Dodderi, retired to the hill of Nidugal, which he fortified. There the family long remained, paying to Sira a tribute of 3,000 pagodas. On the capture of Sira by Haidar Ali in 1761, the Nidugal chief, also called Timmanna Nayak, submitted to the conqueror, who imposed on him a tribute of 7,000 pagodas and the supply of 300 men. Subsequently, while accompanying Tipu Sultan in the expedition against Mangalore, he fell ill, and when at the point of death, was compelled to sign a letter relinquishing his territory and ordering his son Hottana Nayak to deliver it up to the governor of Chitaldroog. Possession was at once taken, and Hottanna Nayak and his brother were sent as prisoners to Chitaldroog and thence to Seringapatam, where they were put to death when the British army ascended the Ghats.\n\nThat of Holavanhalli or Korampur, in the east, was founded by Baire Gauda or Vira Gauda, one of the band of refugees that settled in the fifteenth century at Avati, Devanhalli taluq, and whose history is so prominent in connection with the Bangalore and Kolar Districts. The newly-acquired territory of Holavanhalli does not seem to have been\nlong enjoyed by this family, when it was conquered by the chief of Magadi, who gave it to his own brother Ankana Gauda. The Baire Gauda then ruling, with his eldest son Dodda Baiche Gauda, repaired to the Musalman court at Sira, where he was not only well received but was invested with an important command. Meanwhile, the younger son, Sanna Baiche Gauda, apparently preferring his own people, sought protection from the chief of Dod-Ballapur, who, after a time, sending a force, reduced Holavanhalli. Sanna Baiche Gauda was placed in the government and Ankana Gauda with his family was imprisoned at Hulikal. But within two years the Sira army attacked Dod-Ballapur and captured it. Baire Gauda fell in the siege, and in recognition of his services the eldest son, Dodda Baiche Gauda, was invested with the government of Holavanhalli, with an increase of territory. Subsequent members of the family fortified Koratigere, subdued the neighbouring hoblis belonging to Devarayadurga, Makalidurga and Channaraya-durga, and waged war successfully with the chief of Maddagiri. The successes of the Mysore army soon reduced these possessions, which were finally annexed by Haidar Ali.\n\nThe Maddagiri line of chiefs arose in a similar manner, and extended their possessions over the north of the District, fortifying Maddagiri, Channaraya-durga and other points. In 1678 the joint rulers, Rama Gauda and Timma Gauda, on the capture of their capital by Deva Raja, the dalavai of Mysore, were taken prisoners and conveyed to Seringapatam. They were afterwards released and granted Midagesi as an estate.\n\nThe Hagalvadi chiefs appear to have had their origin from a talari of Yerrakatta, afterwards known as Sal Nayak, who, on the overthrow of the Vijayanagar government, became the leader of a band of free-booters, and succeeded in capturing Kandikere and Shettikere. He afterwards assisted the Penugonda army with a force on condition of being confirmed in his conquests, and when that army was defeated, escaped to his own country with such plunder as he could secure, including, it is said, twelve elephants. Chiknayakanhalli, the seat of government, had been founded and named after his brother, when Honnavalli, Turuvekere, and Nonavinkere were added to their possessions. It was on the completion of these enterprises that he is said to have taken the name of Sal Nayak, from the idea that his conquests extended in a salu or line. The Chiknayakanhalli country changed hands several times, being held alternately by the Muhammadans and the Mahrattas, until reduced by the Mysore army in the time of Chikka Deva Raja.\n\nAt Hebbur a small zamindari was formed under Hale Gauda and\nTimma Gauda, which, being seized for a time by Kempe Gauda of Magadi, who owned the southern parts of the District, and then by the H\u00e1galv\u00e1di chief, was finally united to Mysore.\n\n**Bijapur.**\u2014The overthrow of the Vijayanagar empire on the field of Talikota in 1564 opened the way for many invaders. The Bijapur army under Ran-dulha Khan overran all the north of the District in 1638, and S\u00edra, with Dod-Ballapur, Bangalore, Hoskote, and Kolar, forming what was called Carnatic Bijapur, were placed under the government of Shahji (see Bangalore District).\n\n**Mughals.**\u2014On the capture of Golkonda and Bijapur by Aurangzeb in 1687, and the conquest of their territories by the Mughal army, S\u00edra was made the capital of the new province,\u2014consisting of the seven parganas of Basvapatna, Budihal, S\u00edra, Penugonda, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, and Kolar,\u2014placed under Khasim Khan as Subadar or Faujdar of the Carnatic. This officer applied himself with energy and success to the task of regulating and improving the District. In 1698 he was killed at Dodderi, and the distinguished general Zulfikar Khan succeeded. Another governor named Rustam Jang is said to have built the fort and petta, and by his wise administration of affairs to have obtained the title of Bahadur and the name of Kaifiyat Khan. In 1757 S\u00edra was taken by the Mahrattas, and restored two years after, on the conclusion of peace with Mysore. In 1761 it was taken by Haidar, in alliance with Basalat Jang, who had conferred upon him the title of Navab of S\u00edra. In 1766 it fell again into the hands of the Mahrattas by the defection of Haidar's brother, and in 1774 was reconquered by Tipu. The Mahrattas once more occupied it for a short time in 1791 on marching to join the army of Lord Cornwallis.\n\nThe following is a professed list of the Subadars of S\u00edra under the Mughal government, as given in the Mackenzie MSS:\n\n| Subadar                  | Year |\n|--------------------------|------|\n| Khasim Khan              | 1686 |\n| Atish Khan               | 1694 |\n| Kurad Manur Khan         | 1697 |\n| Dhakta Manur Khan        | 1704 |\n| Pudud Ulla Khan          | 1706 |\n| Davud Khan               | 1707 |\n| Sadat Ulla Khan          | 1709 |\n| Amin Khan                | 1711 |\n| Ghaliib Khan             | 1713 |\n| Darga Khuli Khan         | 1714 |\n| Abid Khan                | 1715 |\n| Mulahavar Khan           | 1716 |\n| Darga Khuli Khan         | 1720 |\n| Abdul Rasul Khan         | 1721 |\n| Tayar Muhammad Khan      | 1722 |\n| Dilavar Khan             | 1724-1756 |\n\n**Mysore Rajas.**\u2014The foregoing accounts have, in order to present a continuous narrative of the history of each chiefdom, necessarily anticipated to some extent the steps by which the various parts of the District were brought under the rule of the Mysore Rajas. But it was Chikka Deva Raja who, at the end of the 17th century, effected the conquest of all the territory which was not appropriated by the Bijapur\ngovernment established at Sira. Thus Ketasamudra, Kandikere, Handalagere, Gulur, Tumkur and Honnavalli, are enumerated among his conquests. After which he seized Jadakanadurga and changed its name to Chikkadevarayadurga (now Devarayadurga). Maddagiri, Midagesi, Bijjavara and Channarayadurga were also subdued in his reign. The remainder of the District fell to Mysore on the conquest of Sira by Haidar Ali in 1761.\n\nAt the beginning of the present century the District was embraced in the Maddagiri Faujdari. After the British assumption in 1832 the Tumkur District was formed, and with that of Chitaldroog constituted the Chitaldroog Division. At the reorganization of 1863 this Division was broken up, and Tumkur became one of the Districts of the new Nundydroog Division. In 1882 it was extended so as to include Chitaldroog as a Sub-Division. In 1886 Chitaldroog was restored as a District, but Pavugada taluq remained as part of Tumkur District.\n\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014The population of the District is 581,018 according to the census of 1891, 291,237 being males and 289,781 females.\n\n*Density.*\u2014This gives 139.9 persons to the square mile. The most thickly peopled taluqs at the time of the census were Tumkur, where the number was 200.8 to the square mile, Kunigal, Maddagiri and Tiptur, where the rate was 174.5, 164.4 and 154.6 respectively. The most sparsely populated were Chiknayakanhalli, with only 97, and Pavugada, with 100.3 per square mile.\n\n*By Religion.*\u2014Dividing the population among the different religious classes, and separating adults from children, we get the following results:\n\n| Religion     | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------|\n|              | Male     | Female   | Male  | Female | Total | Per cent. |\n| Hindus       | 179,955  | 175,615  | 96,897| 100,379| 552,846| 95.13    |\n| Muhammadans  | 7,590    | 7,342    | 5,247 | 5,062  | 25,241 | 4.34     |\n| Jains        | 747      | 633      | 296   | 280    | 1,956  | 0.33     |\n| Christians   | 253      | 192      | 148   | 150    | 743    | 0.13     |\n| Others       |          |          |       |        | 232    |          |\n| **Total**    | 188,545  | 183,782  | 102,588| 105,871| 581,018|          |\n\n*Increase.*\u2014The following table compares the statistics according to\nthe kh\u0101neshum\u0101r\u012b accounts of 1853-4 with those obtained in the censuses of 1871, 1881 and 1891.\n\n| Taluq          | 1853-4 | 1871   | 1881   | 1891   |\n|---------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Chiknayakanhalli | 30,187 | 62,949 | 38,268 | 51,620 |\n| Gubbi         | 33,367 | 91,423 | 57,588 | 73,570 |\n| Kunigal       | 78,388 | 75,416 | 51,250 | 66,502 |\n| Maddagiri     | 92,045 | 115,665| 75,294 | 97,973 |\n| P\u0101vugada      | 37,978 | 62,178 | 42,732 | 53,377 |\n| Sira          | 42,663 | 75,815 | 51,780 | 68,327 |\n| Tiptur        | 59,862 | 88,750 | 65,606 | 78,867 |\n| Tumkur        | 59,908 | 116,830| 70,113 | 90,782 |\n| Total         | 433,498| 689,026| 452,631| 581,018|\n\nThe redistribution of taluqs, and changes in the limits of the District are responsible for some of the variations. There was an apparent increase in the first 18 years of 37\u00b708 per cent., but the early estimate was shown to be 25 per cent. too low. The famine inflicted a loss which sent down the total of 1871 by 34\u00b73 per cent. in the succeeding census of 1881. There was a recovery of 28\u00b736 per cent. by 1891. The net result appears as an increase of 7\u00b722 per cent. in 38 years.\n\nClasses.\u2014With reference to means of livelihood and nationality the population may be classified as follows:\n\n| Class                          | No.    | Per cent. |\n|--------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| A.

All the surrounding places depend on the weekly fair held here on Monday, at which trade is carried on to the value of Rs. 20,000. It is a great mart, especially for export products. The well-water is generally brackish, but a well of sweet water exists outside the town, where also there is a good tank.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 385     | 508     | 527     | 901     |\n| Expenditure      | 479     | 605     | 595     | 897     |\n\nBhasmangi.\u2014A fortified hill in the Maddagiri taluq, 26 miles north of Tumk\u00far, close to the frontier. On the summit is the temple of Bhasmangesvara. The original fortifications are said to have been erected by Budhi Basavappa Nayak, of mud and stone. But when Haidar Ali captured the place in 1768, he dismantled the old fort and\nerected a superior structure of stone and brick, with a mahal or palace. The hill has a perennial supply of water. Some Bedars live half way up, and cultivate the fields below.\n\n**B\u00fadih\u00e1l.**\u2014A ruinous town in the Chikn\u00e1yakanha\u1e37\u1e37i taluq, 9 miles west-north-west of Huliyar, on the road to Hosdurga. Head quarters of the B\u00fadih\u00e1l hobli. Population, 1,209.\n\nB\u00fadih\u00e1l formerly gave its name to a taluq, of which it was the chief town. It appears to have been founded by an officer from Vijayanagar, of the Golla caste, named Siriman or Sirimaya Nayak, to whom the surrounding district was granted as an estate yielding a revenue of 10,000 pagodas, of which half was paid as tribute. He settled first at Sujikal, but the incident of a hare turning on the hounds pointed out the site of the present B\u00fadih\u00e1l as a spot suitable for a fort, which was accordingly erected, and named Bh\u00fatipura. The next ruler, Kum\u00e1ra Mallappa Nayak, withheld the tribute, on which an army was marched against him and the district placed under Narsinga Rao as governor. There are several inscriptions of the Vijayanagar kings in the fort, dated in the sixteenth century.\n\nAfter the fall of Vijayanagar, B\u00fadih\u00e1l was seized by the Tarikere chiefs, but was soon added to the conquests of the Bijapur army, and subsequently formed a district of the province of S\u00edra under the Mughals. The pallegar of Chitadroog and the Mahrattas had in turn possessed it, when in 1761 it yielded to Haidar Ali. The Mahrattas took it again in 1771, but it was recovered in 1774. In 1790 it was once more in the hands of the Mahrattas, but was restored on the conclusion of peace in 1792. It was one of the last places at which the insurgents under the Tarikere pallegar created disturbances in 1831.\n\n**Channaraya-durga.**\u2014A conspicuous but deserted hill-fort in the Maddagiri taluq, situated midway between Koratigiri and Maddagiri, rising to 3,744 feet above the sea. Formerly the head quarters of a taluq bearing the same name. It appears to have been originally fortified by Chikkappa Gauda of Maddagiri, and named Allimenstikallu. In his family it remained for a long period, when it was taken by the Mahrattas, and Rama Gauda, at that time the chief, took refuge in Maddagiri. In two years, however, he retook it, but only to hold it for eight years longer. It was then captured by Komaraiya, general of the Mysore Raja, and Dodda Arasu placed in charge. Its name was also changed to Prasanna-giri. It was subsequently taken by Haidar, and after six years by the Mahrattas under M\u00e1dhava R\u00e1o, and after a like period retaken by Tipu. At the entrance are inscriptions of the Mahratta generals S'ripant pradh\u00e1n and M\u00e1dhava R\u00e1v Ball\u00e1l pradh\u00e1n. In the latter, dated in 1766, the hill is called Chandr\u00e1yadurga.\nChiknayakanhalli.\u2014A taluq in the west. Area 532 square miles. Head-quarters at Chiknayakanhalli.

These hills are part of the auriferous tract described as the Chiknayakanhalli gold-field (see Vol. I, p. 49). The land west and south of the hills is fertile and well cultivated. A stream starting from the south of S'ettikere runs north to Huliya\u1e5b, and one from Yelana\u1e0du runs north-west by B\u00fadih\u00e1l to the Vedavati in Holalkere taluq. From the humidity of the fogs which form on the range of hills the crops are often preserved from failure in dry seasons. The principal export trade is confined to coconut and areca-nut.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1879. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,46,403, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,68,080.\n\nThe average rainfall at Chiknayakanhalli and Huliya\u1e5b for twenty-five years (1870\u201394) and at the other places for two years (1893\u20134) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Chiknayakanhalli | 0\u00b004 | 0\u00b004 | 0\u00b033 | 0\u00b096 | 3\u00b048 | 2\u00b047 | 2\u00b013 | 2\u00b049 | 3\u00b079 | 4\u00b072 | 2\u00b001 | 0\u00b040 | 22\u00b086 |\n| Huliya\u1e5b | \u2014    | 0\u00b011 | 0\u00b018 | 1\u00b056 | 2\u00b045 | 1\u00b078 | 1\u00b098 | 1\u00b027 | 4\u00b098 | 6\u00b050 | 3\u00b025 | 0\u00b087 | 24\u00b093 |\n| B\u00fadih\u00e1l | \u2014    | 0\u00b040 | 0\u00b055 | 2\u00b078 | 6\u00b021 | 2\u00b016 | 0\u00b080 | 0\u00b039 | 2\u00b015 | 5\u00b054 | 1\u00b097 | \u2014    | 22\u00b095 |\n| Mattigatta | \u2014    | 0\u00b037 | 0\u00b020 | 2\u00b020 | 3\u00b075 | 3\u00b047 | 4\u00b089 | 1\u00b092 | 0\u00b091 | 3\u00b071 | 1\u00b024 | 0\u00b006 | 22\u00b072 |\n\nFrom Banasandra Railway-station there is a road north to Chiknayakanhalli and Huliya\u1e5b, from which place roads radiate eastwards to Sira, north to Hiriyur, west to Hosdurga northwards and Banavar south-\nwards, and south-west to Honnavalli and the Konchalli Railway-station.\n\n**Chiknayakanhalli.**\u2014A town situated in $13^\\circ 25' N.$ lat. $76^\\circ 41' E.$ long., 40 miles west-north-west of Tumk\u00far, on the Turvekere-Huliy\u00e1r road, 9 miles north of the Bangalore-Shimoga road, and 12 miles north of the Banasandra Railway-station.

The town was plundered and the fort destroyed by the Mahrattas under Parasu Ram Bha\u00f2, when marching to join the army of Lord Cornwallis before Seringapatam. The residents, it is said, foreseeing the treatment the town would receive, had hidden their most valuable effects and retired to the neighbouring hills. But they were not destined thus to escape. For when the Mahratta army returned to S\u00edra, the wealthy inhabitants were enticed to return by assurances of protection and by a daily distribution of charity to Brahmans. The leading men were then seized and forced by torture to disclose where their treasures were hid. Plunder to the value of Rs. 500,000 thus fell into the hands of the Mahrattas.\n\nIt is a prosperous town, surrounded on all sides by plantations of cocoanut and areca palms. Their produce, together with the coarse cotton cloths, white and coloured, manufactured in the place, are largely sold at the weekly fair. Many of the inhabitants act as carriers to the merchants of Nagar and Bangalore. Seven of the temples are endowed with land or money, the principal being one dedicated to Anjaneya. The town is dependent on the tank for fresh water.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income | ... | 1,468 | 1,734 | 1,727 | 3,349 |\n| Expenditure | ... | 963 | 1,016 | 1,643 | 3,104 |\n\n**Devarayadurga.**\u2014A fortified hill 9 miles east of Tumk\u00far, situated amidst wild and picturesque scenery and extensive forest. It consists of three distinct terraces or elevations, and is well supplied with\nsprings. Near the summit, which is 3,940 feet above the level of the sea, is a small temple, connected with the principal one on the lower level, dedicated to Durga Narasimha. On the intermediate terrace are three European houses, forming a retreat for the hot weather. The fortifications are carried round the three elevations, and must in former days have been of considerable strength.\n\nTradition relates that a robber chief named Andhaka or Lingaka had his stronghold here, and that he was subdued by Sumati, a prince whose father, Hemachandra, was king of Karnata and ruled in Yadupatna. On thus accomplishing the enterprise on which he had been sent, Sumati is related to have established the city of Bhundana near the present Nelamangala (Bangalore District), and taken up his residence there for the protection of that part of his father's kingdom.\n\nUnder the Hoysalas there seems to have been on the hill a town called Anebiddasari or Anebiddajari, which long gave its name to the surrounding district, especially the country to the west and south. The name means \"the steep where the elephant fell,\" and the incident out of which it arose appears to have happened at a spot on the hill now known as Anegondi, or the elephant pit, below the peak called Karigiri, or the elephant hill. A rogue elephant, which the local purana describes as a gandharva who had assumed that form, suddenly appeared before the town, to the great consternation of the people, and after doing considerable mischief to the tank there, madly tried to walk up the steep rock on the west, when he slipped, fell back, and was killed. Under the Vijayanagar kings the use of the same name continued, and a large tank named Bukkasamudra, after one of the earliest of them, was formed by throwing an embankment across the gorge from which the Jayamangali river has its source. Remains of the embankment and of the adjacent town can still be traced.\n\nThe hill was in the possession of a chief named Jadaka, and called Jadakanadurga, when it was captured in about 1696 by Chikka Deva Raja of Mysore, by whom the present fortifications were erected and who gave his name to it, since shortened into Devaraya-durga. The temples were built by Kanthirava Raja of Mysore, and are the scene of a great annual festival resorted to by 3,000 people. They contain jewellery and other property of the god to the value of Rs. 10,000 and are endowed with an annual grant of Rs. 848.\n\nDore-gudda.\u2014A hill in the Chiknayakanhalli taluq, of which there is a tradition that, owing to extensive excavations for the extraction of iron ore, it fell in, burying the miners of seven villages with all their\ncattle.

It is watered by the Shimsha, which flows through the middle from north to south, past Gubbi and Kadaba, where it forms a very large tank. At Kall\u00far it is joined by the N\u00e1ga from the west, and continues south. On the north-west of the taluq are the chains of bare hills separating H\u00e1galv\u00e1di from Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli, which belong to the auriferous tract. The remainder of the taluq is generally an open country and well watered. The soil is mostly a red mould, shallow and gravelly.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1882. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,92,786 and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,40,951.\n\nThe average rainfall at Gubbi for 25 years (1870-94) and at the other places for two years (1893-4) was as follows:\n\n| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|-------|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Gubbi | 0'03 | 0'03 | 0'22 | 1'67  | 3'00 | 3'03 | 3'77 | 5'02 | 5'82 | 5'60 | 2'82 | 0'54 | 31'55 |\n| Chitnahalli | \u2014    | \u2014    | 0'65 | 0'75  | 3'15 | 2'31 | 1'99 | 1'05 | 2'05 | 7'95 | \u2014    | \u2014    | 19'90 |\n| Kadaba | \u2014    | \u2014    | 0'57 | 0'30  | 0'93 | 1'31 | 4'52 | 3'89 | 1'34 | 4'23 | 8'37 | 0'30 | 25'76 |\n\nThe railway from Bangalore to Poona crosses the taluq from east to\nwest, somewhat south of the middle, with stations at Gubbi, Nittur, and Yelladagi. The Bangalore-Shimoga trunk road runs nearly alongside the railway, and at Nittur is crossed by a road running north to Sira, and south by Nelligere to Seringapatam. There is also a road from Gubbi south-east to Hebbur, and one from Hagalvadi, running east through Chelur and Bellavi to Tumkur. There is also a road connecting Hagalvadi with the road to Huliyar.\n\n**Gubbi.**\u2014An important trading place, situated in 12\u00b0 19' N. lat. 77\u00b0 E. long., 13 miles west of Tumkur, on the Bangalore-Poona railway and the Bangalore-Shimoga road. Head-quarters of the Gubbi taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 1,807 | 1,865   | 3,672 |\n| Muhammadans       | 210   | 207     | 417   |\n| Jains             | 35    | 28      | 63    |\n| Christians        | 14    | 21      | 35    |\n| **Total**         | **2,066** | **2,121** | **4,187** |\n\nIt is the entrep\u00f4t for the areca-nut trade between the Nagar Malnad and Wallajapet in the North Arcot District, as well as for the wolagra or internal trade of the neighbourhood. It is said to have been founded over 400 years ago by the Gauda of Hosahalli, two miles distant, and called Amaragonda-pura. He claimed to be a descendant of Honnappa Gauda, hereditary chief of the Nonaba Wokligas, who lived 700 years ago, and owned a district yielding a revenue of 3,000 pagodas. The family were first made tributary by the Mysore Rajas, to whom they paid 500 pagodas a year. Haidar increased the tribute to 2,500, leaving them little better than renters, and Tipu dispossessed them altogether. They are now in the position of ordinary cultivators, but their rank is acknowledged in their own tribe.\n\nGubbi formerly suffered much from the party spirit of the contending sects of Komatis and Banajigas or Lingayits, and was at one time in imminent danger of abandonment from this cause. During the administration of Purnaiya, the erection of a temple by the Komatis to a virgin who had cast herself into the flames to avoid dishonour, excited the previous animosity of the opposite party to such a degree that the town was ordered to be divided by a wall in order to separate the quarters of the two factions. An Amildar was at length chosen from the party which appeared least in the wrong, and with the help of the Brahmins and peaceably disposed inhabitants order was gradually restored, although the extreme measure of slaughtering an\nass in the main street was threatened, which would have compelled all Hindus to abandon the town.\n\nAt Gubbi is one of the chief annual fairs in the country, frequented by merchants from great distances. The neighbourhood produces coarse cotton cloths, both white and coloured, blankets, sack-cloth, areca-nut of the kind called wol\u00e1gra (or neighbouring), cocoanuts, jaggory, tamarind, capsicum, wheat, rice, ragi, and other grains; lac, steel, and iron; all of which here find a ready sale or exchange, as the imports are large, and it is an intermediate mart for all goods passing through the Peninsula in almost every direction. It is computed that at the weekly fair there are sold from 50 to 100 loads of areca-nut produced in the neighbouring districts of S\u00edra, H\u00e1galv\u00e1di, Chikn\u00e1yakanhal\u00ed, B\u00fadih\u00e1l, Honnavalli and Gubbi; as well as from 20 to 40 loads of kopri or dry cocoanut from the same districts. Taking the load at 8 maunds of 40 Sultani seers, there are thus sold annually at this mart alone 335 tons of areca-nut, and 134 tons of cocoanut, the produce of the neighbourhood, representing a money value of Rs. 2,18,400 and Rs. 33,280 respectively.\n\nOf the coarse cloths made in the vicinity by the D\u00e9v\u00e1ngas, Togatas and Holeyas 100 pieces on the average are sold at each fair, representing an annual value of about 15,000 rupees. There are, however, many other fairs in the surrounding country where these products are also sold to a considerable extent.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 1,384  | 1,599  | 1,777  | 2,932  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 1,638  | 1,837  | 1,355  | 3,141  |\n\nHagalvadi.\u2014A village in the Gubbi taluq, 25 miles north-east of the kasba. Population, 1,288.\n\nLing\u00e1yits and Kurubas are the prevailing classes in the place. The chief produce of the neighbourhood is areca-nut, and inferior kamblis are manufactured. It was the original possession of the line of chiefs named from it, who built Chikn\u00e1yakanhal\u00ed and owned all the west of the District. When subdued by the Mysore Raja they gave up the rest of their territory in order to retain H\u00e1galv\u00e1di free of tribute. Haidar Ali subsequently compelled them to pay for this also, and his son dispossessed them altogether.\n\nHebbur.\u2014A large village in the Tumk\u00far taluq, 15 miles south of Tumk\u00far, on the road to Kunigal. Population, 1,646.\n\nThe place is said to have been founded by two brothers named\nHale Gauda and Timme Gauda. It was at first called Heb huli (great or royal tiger), from the circumstance that a bullock attacked by a tiger had driven it off and pursued it, with the other cattle and their owners, until it was killed. The courage of the cattle was attributed to the peculiar virtue of the spot, pointing it out as suitable for the construction of a fort. Accordingly, the carcase of the tiger being burnt, the limits of the fort were marked out with its ashes, and the erection was completed with the countenance of the Vijayanagar king. The name was subsequently changed from Hebbuli to Hebbur, the great town, and Katti Kamanna was appointed as the king's agent; Hale Gauda and Timme Gauda being made patels of Hebbur, Kallesapura and Ramanhalli. The agent, however, instead of supplying his patron's exchequer, spent the public money in erecting temples, forming tanks, &c. For his insolence on being summoned to court to account for his proceedings, he was condemned to have both his eyes put out and to be expelled from the royal territories. A descendant of the Gaudas was next placed in charge, but after Vijayanagar was taken by the Muhammadans, Kempe Gauda of Magadi captured Hebbur, and held it for many years. It was then taken by the Chiknayakanhalli chief, and from him by Chikka Deva Raja of Mysore. A quarter of a century later it again changed hands, falling a prey to the Mughal army, but in course of time was regained by the Mysore Raja. For two years before the usurpation of Haidar Ali, again, it was in the hands of the Mahrattas. The place has thus seen many vicissitudes.\n\n**Heggere.**\u2014A village six miles west of Huliy\u00e1r. Population, 901. It contains some ruined temples and various Ch\u00e1lukya and Hoysala inscriptions which indicate that it was at one time an important place.\n\n**Hemavati.**\u2014A village on the extreme northern frontier of Sira taluq, in Madaksira. It has been identified by me as the site of the ancient Nolamba or Pallava capital called in inscriptions Penjeru or Henjeru (see Nidugal). It contains a number of large ruined temples and other remains which attest its former importance. The principal temple now kept up is that of Henjerappa, who, according to some accounts, was a man. The whole site is strewn with lingas of enormous size.\n\n**Holavanhalli.**\u2014A village on the Jayamangali river, in the Maddagiri taluq, 5 miles east of Koratigere. Population, 1,459.\n\nIt is said to have been formerly called Korampur, the inhabitants being a few persons of low caste whose chief was Holava Gauda. To them Baire Gauda, one of the Kanchi refugees who settled at Avati (Bangalore District), or a descendant of the same name, proposed to establish a fort and p\u00e9te at Korampur, to which the people would\nagree only on condition that the place should be called after their Gauda, whence its present name. Baire Gauda became tributary to the Vijayanagar kings, and obtained from them a grant of 33 villages in Kolahalli and the neighbourhood, together with other lands, yielding altogether 6,000 pagodas a year. During seven years Baire Gauda greatly improved his estate, when it was seized by the chief of Magadi, who placed his brother Ankana Gauda in charge of it. Seven years later it was taken by Haveli Baiche Gauda of Dod-Ballapur; but in two years Dod-Ballapur was itself captured by the Navab of Sira. Baire Gauda, who had joined the Sira army, was killed in this enterprise, but Holavanhalli was restored to his eldest son Dodda Baiche Gauda, with additions to the estate, on condition of paying a tribute. The fort and peta of Koratigere were built some time after by a member of this family, and the hoblis of Gundakal, Irkasamudra, Sageri, Kolala and Dasarahalli annexed, yielding altogether a revenue of 26,000 pagodas, subject to a tribute of 3,000 pagodas and the maintenance of a military force. The local chiefs continued in possession as tributary, successively, to the Mysore Rajas, the Mahrattas and the Navab of Sira, and afterwards to Haidar Ali, on whose death, in 1782, Holavanhalli was annexed to Mysore. In 1792 Lord Cornwallis reinstated one of the family, named Dodda Rama Baire Gauda, but on the withdrawal of the confederate forces, Tipu reduced the place and resumed possession.\n\n**Honnavalli.**\u2014A town in the Tiptur taluq, 8 miles north-west of the kasba. Population 2,102.\n\nThe place derives its name from Honnuamma, the tutelary goddess who in a vision directed Somesvara, one of the chiefs of Harnhalli (Hassan District), to found the town. It contains many Brahmins, and is situated amid cocoanut plantations, which produce a rare kind, named, from the delicious milk contained in the young nut, the Gangapani, or water of the Ganges. The town depends chiefly on one well for drinking purposes.\n\n**Huliyar.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 35' N. lat., 76\u00b0 36' E. long., 14 miles north by west of Chiknayakanhalli. Head-quarters of the Huliyar sub-taluq included in Chiknayakanhalli taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|------|\n| Hindus             | 614   | 572     | 1,186|\n| Muhammadans       | 117   | 129     | 246  |\n| **Total**         | **731**| **701** | **1,432** |\nThe addition of Kenkere, an adjoining suburb, would raise the population to 2,579. Huliy\u00e1r was formerly the head-quarters of the B\u00fadih\u00e1l taluq, but in 1886 was made the chief town of the sub-taluq named after itself. Inscriptions of the Ch\u00e1lukyas and other remains indicate that the place may, in early times, have been of some importance. Latterly, in the sixteenth century, it was included in the possessions of the chiefs of H\u00e1galv\u00e1\u1e0di. It then passed into the hands of the Muhammadans, and formed part of the province of S\u00edra. Haidar Ali subdued it in common with the rest of the District, and thus annexed it to Mysore.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 356    | 391    | 401    | 758    |\n| Expenditure     | 378    | 362    | 411    | 681    |\n\n**Huliyurdurga.**\u2014A town in the Kunigal taluq, 40 miles south of Tumkur, at the junction of roads from Kunigal and Magadi.

The place is surrounded with jungle, and derives its name from huli, tiger, which animal used to abound in the neighbourhood. The town and the fortifications of the hill commanding it, rising to 3,096 feet above the level of the sea, were erected by Kempe Gauda, the chief of Magadi. Muhammadans and Ling\u00e1yits form the principal classes of the population.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 195    | 242    | 291    | 670    |\n| Expenditure     | 243    | 163    | 174    | 866    |\n\n**Hutri-durga.**\u2014A fortified hill in the south-west of the Kunigal taluq, rising to 3,713 feet above the sea. The fort was taken by Lord Cornwallis in 1792.\nJayamangali.\u2014An affluent of the N. Pin\u0101kini. It rises in Devar\u0101yadurga, in a gorge called the J\u00e1lada-gondi, and flowing in a northerly direction into the Maddagiri taluq, receives the Garud\u0101chala near Holavanhalli from the east, and farther on, near Rampura, the Suvarnamukhi from the west. Thence, continuing its course through the east of the Maddagiri taluq, it flows into the N. Pin\u0101kini near Parigi in the Anantapur District. In the sandy bed are formed a number of kapile wells, and talpargi or spring-head streams are drawn from the channel.\n\nKadaba.\u2014A town in the Gubbi taluq, on the right bank of the Shimsha, 7 miles south-west of the kasba, on the road from Ni\u1e6d\u1e6d\u016br to Mayasandra. Head-quarters of the hobli of the same name, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus            | 695   | 729     | 1,424 |\n| Muhammadans       | 23    | 20      | 43    |\n| Total             | 718   | 749     | 1,467 |\n\nTill 1886 it gave its name to the taluq now called Gubbi, and was at one time the head-quarters of the taluq.\n\nIt is said to owe its name to Kadamba rishi, who performed penance here on the banks of the Shimshupa, as the Shimsha is called in the local purana. Rama, on his return from Lanka, is said to have encamped here, and at the request of Sita, the river, which was too narrow for the convenience of all the followers, was dammed so as to expand into the present large tank. There is a settlement of Sri Vaishnava Brahmans here, which seems to have been formed in the time of the reformer R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, who, fleeing from the Chola country, took refuge with the Hoysala king.\n\nKaidala.\u2014A village in Gulur hobli, 3 miles south of Tumk\u00far, containing the ruins of two fine temples. Population 577.\n\nIt appears to have been formerly the capital of a state, and is said to have borne the name of Krid\u00e1pura. It is also reported to be the native place of Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, the famous architect and sculptor to whose wonderful skill is attributed all the finest temple carving in the Province, as at Haleb\u00edd, B\u00e9lur, &c. Tradition relates that Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri\u2019s career began while Nripa R\u00e1ya was ruling in Krid\u00e1pura. He then left his native place and, entering the service of various courts, produced the works by which his fame is to this day upheld. After his departure, a son, Dankan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, was born to him, who, when grown\nup, set out in search of his father, neither having ever seen the other. At Belur the young man found the Chennak\u00e9sava temple in course of erection, and\u2014so the story goes\u2014remarked that one of the images had ablemish. As this would be fatal to its claim as an object of worship, the architect, who was no other than Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri himself, hastily vowed to cut off his right hand if any defect could be found in an image he had carved. To test the matter the figure was covered with sandal paste, which dried on every part except around the navel. In this on examination was found a cavity the son had detected, containing a frog and some sand and water. Mortified at the result, Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri cut off his right hand, and inquiries as to who his critic was, led to the unexpected discovery of their mutual relationship. Subsequently Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri was directed in a vision to dedicate a temple to the god Kesava in Krid\u00e1pura, his native place. Thither he accordingly returned, and no sooner was the temple completed than his right hand was restored. In commemoration of this incident the place has ever since been called Kai-dala, the restored hand.\n\nThe Gangesvara temple contains inscriptions stating that it and the Narayana temple were erected in 1150, in the reign of the Hoysala king N\u00e1rasimha, by a chief named G\u00fale B\u00e1chi. The name is there spelled Kayd\u00e1la, and there is nothing in support of the above story.\n\nKarekal-gudda.\u2014A hill in the south-east of the Tipt\u00far taluq, containing an old quarry of fine black hornblende, which has been extensively applied to the construction of temples. The quarry is situated about half a mile east from the village of K\u00e1dahalli.\n\nKoratigere.\u2014A sub-taluq included in Maddagiri taluq. The hoblis belonging to it are Channarayadurga, Holavanhalli, and Koratigere.\n\nKoratigere.\u2014A town situated on the left bank of the Suvarnamukhi, in 13\u00b0 31' N. lat., 77\u00b0 17' E. long., 16 miles north of Tumk\u00far, on the Tumk\u00far-Maddagiri road.

From the large tank at Kunigal it receives a stream called the N\u00e1gini. The south-east is occupied by the continuation of the great hill range which runs north to the Maddagiri taluq. The country around Huliy\u00fardurga, and between that place and Kunigal, is very hilly and jungly, the ground being rocky and barren. To the northward and westward the soil is fertile and well cultivated.\n\nEarly in the ninth century the Kuningil country, which apparently corresponded with the Kunigal taluq and neighbouring parts, was being governed by Vimal\u00e1ditya, a Ch\u00e1lukya prince who was the nephew of\nCh\u00e1ki R\u00e1ja, the R\u00e1shtarak\u00fata viceroy ruling the Ganga territories during the imprisonment of the Ganga king.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1881. The area of the taluq (including Koppa hobli, since transferred to Mandya taluq) was thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 135,225; wet, 10,825; garden, 3,948) ... 149,998\n- Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) ... ... 82,220\n- Inam villages (37,776), Amrit Mahal kavals (5,458) ... ... 43,234\n\nTotal acres ... ... ... 275,452\n\nOf the culturable area, 49,834 acres were unoccupied. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,33,652, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,58,772.\n\nThe average rainfall at Kunigal for 25 years (1870\u201394) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b014 | 0\u00b034 | 1\u00b019  | 3\u00b064| 2\u00b077 | 3\u00b059 | 4\u00b049 | 5\u00b068  | 6\u00b033 | 1\u00b098 | 0\u00b021 | 30\u00b038 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Hassan road passes through Kunigal, whence also there are cross roads to Tumk\u00far, and via Huliyurdurga to Maddur.\n\n**Kunigal.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 2' N. lat. 77\u00b0 5' E. long., 22 miles south of Tumk\u00far, on the Bangalore-Hassan road.

But from early inscriptions it would appear that the original form of the name was Kuningil or Kunigil.\n\nThree streams rising in Sivaganga, whose names are Na\u00f1ini, N\u00e1gini and Kamala, are said here to unite their waters. Their virtue is such that a king from the north, named Nr\u00edga chakravarti, is said to have been cured of leprosy by bathing in them, and to have constructed the large tank in consequence. A party of seven Lipi j\u00f3g\u00eds, it is said, subsequently came from the Him\u00e1layas and obtained a large treasure from the bed of the tank, after killing the seven-headed serpent which guarded it. The tank is estimated to be fourteen miles round when full. The foundation of the fort is attributed to a V\u00edra Kambala R\u00e1ya in 1290. It afterwards came into the possession of the Magadi chief,\nwho enlarged the town and fort. Owing to a low type of fever, the place at one time became very unhealthy. The Stud Farm for the breeding of horses for the Mysore Silahdars, formerly at Closepet, has been long established here.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income           | 1,281  | 1,358  | 1,313  | 2,334  |\n| Expenditure      | 998    | 1,370  | 1,277  | 3,464  |\n\n**Maddagiri.**\u2014A taluq in the north-east.

The valleys to the west of the range and south of Maddagiri have a greater elevation than the other parts of the taluq. The open country to the north-east is crossed at one corner by the N. Pin\u00e1kini, nearly parallel with which, on the west, flow its affluents, first the Kumadvati and then the Jayamangali. This is a very fertile tract of country, with water easily obtainable, at a few feet below the surface, from tulparg\u00eds or spring heads. All the wet and dry crops of the eastern Districts, as well as the fruits grown in Bangalore, are successfully cultivated.\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1877. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,31,803, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,82,898.\n\nThe average rainfall for 25 years (1870\u201394) at Maddagiri, and for two years (1893\u20134) at the other places, was as follows:\n\n|                | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|----------------|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Maddagiri .....| 0\u00b004 | 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b025 | 0\u00b055  | 2\u00b020| 2\u00b015 | 2\u00b019 | 2\u00b075 | 3\u00b002 | 4\u00b022 | 1\u00b060 | 0\u00b037 | 19\u00b036 |\n| Badavanhalli ...| \u2014    | 0\u00b010 | 0\u00b025 | 0\u00b048  | 1\u00b013| 3\u00b028 | 2\u00b008 | 1\u00b000 | 3\u00b050 | 3\u00b055 | 0\u00b068 | \u2014    | 16\u00b005 |\n| Itagadibbanhalli| \u2014    | 0\u00b003 | 0\u00b050 | 1\u00b065  | 2\u00b060| 2\u00b038 | 1\u00b088 | 1\u00b031 | 2\u00b044 | 8\u00b049 | 1\u00b037 | \u2014    | 22\u00b065 |\n\nThe Tumkur-Pavugada road runs through the taluq from south to north, by way of Koratigere, Maddagiri and Midagesi. At Maddagiri it is crossed by a road going south-east to the Tondebhavi Railway-station, and west to Sira. From Koratigere there is a road south to Dobbspet in Nelamangala taluq.\n\n**Maddagiri.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 39' N. lat. 77\u00b0 16' E. long., 24 miles north of Tumkur, on the Tumkur-Pavugada road. Headquarters of the taluq bearing the same name, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males. | Femals. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|\n| Hindus             | 1,339  | 1,399   | 2,738  |\n| Muhammadans       | 357    | 405     | 762    |\n| Jains              | 22     | 14      | 36     |\n| **Total**          | **1,718** | **1,818** | **3,536** |\n\nIt is surrounded on all sides by hills, the continuation of the north and south range which traverses the east of the District. The town derives its name from Madhu-giri, or honey hill, at the northern base of which it is situated. The two large temples of Venkatramanasa-wami and Mallesvara, standing side by side, are conspicuous objects. A very graceful ornament is carried round under the eaves of the roof of the latter, representing doves or pigeons, of about life size, in every natural attitude.\n\nThe erection of the original fort and town is ascribed to a local chief named Raja Hira Gauda. The circumstance of a stray sheep having returned from the hill dripping with wet led to the discovery that it was well supplied with springs of water. This being reported by the shepherds of the neighbouring village of Bijavara, the advantages of the situation were so apparent that the town was established, and mud fortifications constructed on the hill for its protection. About 1678, while Rama Gauda and Timma Gauda, descendants of the founder, were ruling in Maddagiri, they incurred the hostility of the Raja of Mysore. The dalavayi Devaraj was therefore sent against it, who, after a siege\nof a year, took the place and led the Gaudas with their families captive to Seringapatam. They were, however, released and sent back to Midagesi, which was left to them out of their lost possessions.\n\nThe fortifications of Maddagiri were greatly increased by Haidar Ali, and the place was the seat of a valuable trade, containing a hundred houses of weavers alone. Hither in 1763, on the conquest of Bednur, he sent as prisoners both the Rani and her lover, and also even the pretender Chenna Basavaiya, for whose rights he had ostensibly been fighting, and here they remained until the capture of the place by the Mahrattas in 1767. The Mahratta chief Madhava Rao held possession of Maddagiri for seven years, and when forced by Tipu in 1774 to retire, plundered the town of everything he could carry away. With the usual exaggeration its wealth is said to have been so great that he disdained to remove anything less valuable than gold. Tipu bestowed on it the name of Fattehabad, city of victory, and made it the capital of a surrounding district yielding a revenue of six lakhs of pagodas. But his exactions had nearly ruined the place, when the destruction was completed by the Mahrattas in 1791. Balvant Rao, one of Parasu Ram Bhaos officers, besieged it, though without success, for five months, having under his command a large army, according to native accounts, of 20,000 men. It was principally composed of banditti assembled by the palegars formerly driven from their strongholds, who had ventured back under the protection of Lord Cornwallis. On the conclusion of peace they were speedily dispersed by the Sultan, but not before they had devastated all the neighbouring country. Of 500 Mahratta horse who had joined this rabble, it is said that only 20 men, with their chief, escaped. On the conclusion of the third Mysore war and the death of Tipu, Maddagiri was included in the new territory of Mysore.\n\nThough its prosperity has somewhat revived, the town has never recovered from the ravages of the Mahratta army. It has, however, an extensive trade in brass, copper, and silver vessels of every description. There are also manufactures of iron, steel, coarse cloths and cumblis, and weekly interchange is held with the markets at Tiptur, Bellary and Hindupur in the Anantapur District, as well as with Bangalore. The chief article of export is rice, especially that called chinnada salaki, or golden stick, which is much cultivated and eagerly sought by Bangalore merchants, as it is esteemed to be the best in the Province. The cattle here are finer than those ordinarily seen in other parts of the District. The town, as well as the whole taluq, owes its prosperity to the richness of the soil, and the springs peculiar to this region, which abound everywhere near the surface, so that in the worst of seasons an unfailing\nsupply of water is obtainable for the crops, while the well-water is generally sweet.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | ...    | 1,086  | 1,332  | 990    | 1,880  |\n| Expenditure    | ...    | 1,110  | 1,167  | 1,243  | 2,158  |\n\n**Maddagiri-durga.**\u2014A bold fortified hill commanding the town of Maddagiri. The summit is 3,935 feet above the level of the sea. The only access is on the northern face, which slopes upwards at a steep angle, presenting large sheets of bare rock that scarcely allow of foothold except when perfectly dry. In time of war the garrison, it is said, were accustomed to pour oil down these rocky inclines, to prevent the assailing force from mounting the hill. The history of the fortress has already been given in connection with that of the town of Maddagiri. The present formidable lines of defence were erected by Haidar, as stated by a rude inscription in Kannada over one of the upper gateways. There are many springs and ponds of water on the hill, with large granaries and store-houses, formed out of caverns or excavated in the rock. \u201cThe view of Madhu giri, on approaching it from the east,\u201d says Buchanan, \u201cis much finer than that of any hill-fort I have seen. The works here make a very conspicuous appearance, whereas in general they are scarcely visible, being hidden by the immensity of the rocks on which they are erected.\u201d\n\n**Midagesi.**\u2014A town in the Maddagiri taluq, at the eastern base of the Midag\u00e9si-durga, 12 miles north of the kasba, on the Tumkur-P\u00e1vuga\u1e0da road. Head-quarters of the Midag\u00e9si hobli. Population, 1,039.\n\nIt is said to be named after a princess who was burned here with the corpse of her husband. R\u00e1nis of the same family continued to govern it until conquered by Chikkappa Gau\u1e0da, of whose family it remained the chief possession long after they had been deprived of Maddagiri and Channar\u00e1ya-durga. In 1761 it was reduced by Haidar Ali, and six years later by the Mahrattas, from whom it was recovered by Tipu in 1774. During the invasion of Lord Cornwallis a descendant of Chikkappa Gau\u1e0da returned to the town, but finding on the conclusion of peace that it must revert to Tipu, plundered it of the little that had escaped Mahratta rapacity, and did not leave it until Kamar-ud-Din was approaching with a large force. Under the Muhammadan government, Midag\u00e9si was the residence of an Asoph, and afterwards the head-quarters of a taluq, which was finally incorporated with Maddagiri.\nMuganayakankote.\u2014A town in the Gubbi taluq, 15 miles east of the kasba. Population, 977.\n\nIt is strongly fortified with mud walls, and before the last incursion of the Mahrattas contained a fine market, consisting of a wide street lined with cocoanut-trees. A somewhat droll account is given of the Mahratta attack on the place, which was repulsed by the inhabitants with the utmost gallantry. Parasu Ram Bhaq while at Sira despatched, it is said, a force of 500 horse with 2,000 irregular foot and one gun to capture the fort. Its defence was undertaken by 500 peasants from the neighbourhood, who had two small guns and 100 matchlocks; slings and stones being the only other weapons. The market was destroyed to prevent its giving shelter to the attacking party. The siege was maintained for two months, but though the Mahrattas repeatedly fired their gun, they never once, says the local historian, succeeded in hitting the fort! Disheartened by their ill-success and the loss of two or three of their men, the enemy abandoned the siege and retired, not one of the defendants having been hurt.\n\nNidugal.\u2014A fortified hill in the Pavuga\u00e7a taluq, 14 miles west of the kasba, with a village of the same name on the south and east. Headquarters of the Nidugal hobli. Population, 310.\n\nThe lofty pointed peak of Nidu-gal, literally the long or high stone or rock, rising to 3,722 feet above sea-level, is a conspicuous object throughout the north-east of the country, and it was at all times a formidable stronghold. In the ninth and tenth centuries it was held by the Nolamba kings, who were of the Pallava family, and whose capital was at Henjeru, now called Hemavati. Subsequently it was in possession of a line of kings of Chola descent, prominent among whom was Irungola, acknowledging the supremacy of the Ch\u00e1lukyas, whose name occurs as one of the opponents of the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana in the twelfth century. The Hoysalas appear to have finally captured the place in the time of Ballala II. Under the Vijayanagar kings, a line of chiefs, whose progenitor was Tippa Raja of Harati, held Nidugal. In 1761 they submitted to Haidar Ali on his conquest of Sira, and were finally ousted by Tipu, who took the last representative as a prisoner to Seringapatam, and put him to death when the British army ascended the Ghats. A fuller account is contained in the history of the District.\n\nThe hill was surrounded with six lines of fortifications. That round the summit was called K\u00e1lanjana-giri and K\u00e1lahasti-k\u00f3te; the second fort was Bhairavan-k\u00f3te; the third, Basavan-k\u00f3te; the fourth, Chen-nar\u00e1yan-k\u00f3te (the palace of the chiefs was here); the fifth, Allamdevar-k\u00f3te and Bestar-k\u00f3te; the sixth, V\u00edrabhadra-k\u00f3te.

It forms a large projection from the north-eastern frontier of Mysore, attached to it by a narrow neck less than five miles in width, and is separated from the remainder of the District by the intervening Madaksira taluq of the Anantapur District. The N. Pinakini runs across the extreme east and in some parts forms the boundary on that side. From Nidugal northwards the taluq abounds in rocky hills, many of which are crowned with fortifications. Ranges of hills also form the outer boundary of the Racherlu hobli, a separate tract entirely to the east of the N. Pinakini; and there is a thick cluster on the south, between the frontier and Madaksira.\n\nThe soil is sandy and abounds with talpargis or springs of water, which may be tapped at short distances from each other. In some parts of the taluq the wells, instead of being dug in the sand, require to be cut through a soft porous rock. Paddy, ragi, navane, and horsegram are grown in abundance, but all the dry and wet crops of the District are raised more or less, as well as tobacco and cotton. Iron and rice are exported to Bangalore, Bellary, Karnul and other places.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1872. The total revenue\ndemand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 96,971, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,15,146.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at P\u00e1vugada for 25 years (1870-94) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n|      |      |      |       |     |      |      |      |       |      |      |      | 18'58 |\n\nThe chief road is one from Maddagiri through Madaksira to P\u00e1vugada and the north. There is also a road from P\u00e1vugada east through Rodda to the railway at Penugonda, and one west to Chellakere. A road from Madaksira to Penugonda also crosses the south-east of the taluq. The old Bangalore-Bellary road ran through R\u00e1charlu.\n\nP\u00e1vugada.\u2014A town situated in 14\u00b0 16' N. lat., 77\u00b0 21' E. long., at the southern base of the hill so named, 60 miles north of Tumk\u00far, on the road from Maddagiri, and 19 miles west of the railway at Penugonda.

The place was the haunt of a body of freebooters, who subsisted by plundering the neighbouring country, when it was captured by B\u00e1lapa Nayak, the founder of the P\u00e1vugada line of palegars. He was one of three brothers of the Yerra Golla caste, who, about 1585, coming from Gutti, entered into the service of Havali Baire Gauda, palegar of Chik-Ballapur (Kolar District). This chief, having no children, adopted B\u00e1lapa Nayak, and when summoned to aid the king at Penugonda in an attack upon Gutti, sent him in command of the contingent. B\u00e1lapa Nayak, from his local knowledge, was enabled to surprise Gutti, and was rewarded with a grant of Pallavola and other villages. It was after obtaining this estate that he seized P\u00e1vugada and fortified the hill. At a later period a conflagration broke out at Penugonda, owing to a powder magazine being struck by lightning. Venkatpati R\u00e1ya was absent at the time, but B\u00e1lapa Nayak, hastening to the place, extinguished the spreading flames, for which service he was invested with the title of palegar, and received a large accession of territory.\nThis\u2014with occasional losses from attacks by the palegars of Ratnagiri, Ni\u1e0dugal and R\u0101ydurga, and the Mahrattas\u2014his descendants continued to govern until the place was taken by the forces of Haidar Ali, when the chief, Timmappa N\u0101yak, and his family, were sent as prisoners to Maddagiri. In 1777, when engaged in operations against Chitaldroog, Haidar visited P\u00e1vuga\u1e0da and ordered the erection of the present fortifications. The palegar of R\u00e1charlu was at the same time made prisoner and sent to Pe\u1e47ugonda, his territory being annexed to P\u00e1vuga\u1e0da. When Maddagiri was taken by the Mahrattas, co-operating with Lord Cornwallis against Seringapatam, Timmappa N\u0101yak obtained release, and took possession again of P\u00e1vuga\u1e0da. But on the conclusion of peace could not keep the place against Tipu.\n\nThe hill of P\u00e1vuga\u1e0da rises to 3,026 feet above the level of the sea.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 368    | 418    | 531    | 953    |\n| Expenditure    | 414    | 382    | 695    | 903    |\n\n**Sampige.**\u2014A village in the Gubbi taluq, four miles west of Kadaba.

Population, 875.\n\nIt is remarkable only for the temple of Narasimha, at which there is a great annual festival in the month of M\u00e1gha, attended by 10,000 people. The origin of the temple is thus related. In the days when there were no roads and the place was covered with jungle, a certain merchant carrying grain on pack bullocks halted at Sibi. But when his pot of rice was set on to boil on a small projecting rock, its contents turned to the colour of blood and he with his attendants and bullocks fell down in a swoon. While in this unconscious state Narasimha appeared to him in a vision and, revealing that the stone was his abode, commanded the merchant to build a temple over it in atonement for the desecration committed.\n\nThe small temple then erected was replaced by the present large building during this century under the following circumstances: Three brothers living at Tumk\u00far, who had enriched themselves by farming the revenue of the District in the days of Tipu, subsequently sought to atone for their oppressions by works of charity. To Nallappa, the eldest, Narasimha in a vision offered eternal happiness on condition of\nhis building and endowing the temple at Sibi. This was accordingly accomplished in ten years by the three brothers. It is an ordinary structure, surrounded by a high stone wall. The approach is lined on either side with mean stone sheds for the accommodation of visitors to the annual festival. Shops to the number of 400 are then opened by merchants from Dharwar, Bellary, Bangalore, Chitaldroog, Kumbhakonam and other distant places, and trade is carried on to the value, it is said, of several lakhs of rupees.\n\n**Shimsha.**\u2014An affluent of the Kaveri, also called the Shimshupa, the Kadamba and the Kadaba-kola. It rises to the south of Devaraydurga and flowing south-west through the Gubbi taluq, forms the large Kadaba tank. Thence running southwards, it unites near Kallur with the N\u00e1ga, which feeds the Turuvekere tank, and further on, in the Kunigal taluq, with the N\u00e1gini from the Kunigal tank. Afterwards, turning east, it skirts the hills west of Huliyurdurga and pursues a southerly course into the Mandya taluq of the Mysore District.\n\n**Sira.**\u2014A taluq in the north.

It is at a considerably lower level than the rest of the District. It is crossed from east to west by a stream which flows into the Ved\u00e1vati, and whose course is marked by cocoa-nut gardens. The tracts adjoining Madak-s\u00edra are fertile and well watered. The soil in other\nparts is mostly rocky and hard. Along the west there is a good deal of jungle, from Bukkapa\u1e6dna northwards.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1870. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,59,492, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,97,613.\n\nThe average rainfall at S\u00edra for 25 years (1870\u201394), and at the other places for 2 years (1893\u20134) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| S\u00edra | ...  | ...  | ...   | ... | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...   | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\n| Bukkapa\u1e6dna | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Kallambelle | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nThe Bangalore-Bellary road passes through S\u00edra, from whence also there is a road through Huliyar to the west, and to Maddagiri on the east, with one north to Amarapuram in Madaks\u00edra.

Before the fort was completed, S\u00edra and its dependencies were conquered by Ran-dulha Khan, general of the Bijapur state. Malik Husen, then appointed governor, completed the fort and enclosed the town with mud walls. Malik Rihan was Subadar from 1638 to 1650.\n\nThe capture of Bijapur by Aurangzeb in 1687 was speedily followed by the conquest of the Carnatic districts dependent on it. S\u00edra was made the capital of the new province south of the Tungabhadra,\u2014composed of the seven parganas of Basvapatna, Budihal, S\u00edra, Penukonda, Dod-Ballapur, Hoskote, and Kolar,\u2014with Harpanhalli, Kondarpi, Anegundi, Bednur, Chitaldroog, and Mysore as tributary states. Kh\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n was appointed as the first governor, under the designation apparently of Faujd\u00e1r Div\u00e1n, a title, however, which was often altered according\nto circumstances. He introduced the Muhammadan revenue system, elsewhere described, and governed with ability until 1698, when, being surprised by the Mahrattas and the chief of Chitadroog at Dodderi while in the conveyance of a large treasure; he either committed suicide to avoid disgrace or was killed by them. Zulifkar Khan succeeded, but a governor named Rastam Jang or Chak appears to have most distinguished himself by his administration, gaining the title of Bah\u00e1dur and the name of Kaifiyat Kh\u00e1n. The last of the Mughal governors of Sira, which shared in many of the contests between the rivals for the Subadari of the Dekhan, was Dil\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n, from whom the place was taken in 1757 by the Mahrattas.\n\nIn 1761, Haidar, having entered into alliance at Hoskote with Bas\u00e1lat Jang and received from him the title of Nav\u00e1b of S\u00edra, at once took the place and thence extended his conquests all over the north. In 1766 the brother-in-law of Haidar was induced by the Mahrattas to yield up S\u00edra, which remained in their hands till retaken by Tipu in 1774, since which time it has been attached to Mysore, except for a short period when it was occupied by the Mahratta army co-operating with the British against Seringapatam.\n\nS\u00edra attained its highest prosperity under Dil\u00e1var Kh\u00e1n and is said to have contained 50,000 houses. An elegant palace erected by him, now all ruined, was the model on which those of Bangalore and Seringapatam were built. A fine garden was also made, called the Kh\u00e1n B\u00e1gh, which was kept up by Haidar, and may have suggested the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh at Bangalore. The ruins of a large quarter, to which tradition assigns the name of L\u00e1tapura, may yet be seen to the north-west of the fort. Tipu forcibly transported 12,000 families from S\u00edra to form a population for his new town of Shahar Ganjam on the island of Seringapatam. These vicissitudes and the inroads of the Mahrattas reduced the town to 3,000 houses. There are now only about 700, much scattered. The Jama Masjid, of hewn stone (date 1696), is deserving of mention, and the tomb of Malik Rihan (date 1650). The fort, well built of stone, is surrounded with a moat and a fine glacis.\n\nA large tank to the north irrigates the subjacent lands. The soil around is favourable to the growth of the cocoa-nut, the dried kernel of which is the staple article of export. The population consists largely of Kurubar, who manufacture cumblis or coarse blankets, of wool imported from Davangere, Kankuppa and Madaks\u00edra. These are exported to Walaji, Kaudial or Mangalore, Bangalore, Mysore, Ganjam, Nagar and Coorg. The prices range from 8 annas to 12 rupees according to quality and texture, the entire trade being of the annual value of Rs. 5,000. Some years ago chintzes were largely manufactured,\nand a glazed kind found a ready sale among the higher classes. But the importation of English piece goods has put a stop to the native manufacture. Common sealing-wax continued to be made, but it was far inferior to the kind now prepared in England specially for India.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 1,500  | 1,571  | 1,404  | 2,383  |\n| Expenditure     | 1,158  | 2,085  | 2,018  | 2,843  |\n\n**Sitakal.**\u2014A village in the Kol\u00e1la hobli of the Tumk\u00far taluq.

On the south-east, near Dabbegatta, are some hills yielding a fine black hornblende, which has been formerly much quarried for pillars of temples and other public buildings. In the northern parts the soils are more or less gravelly; in the centre and south they are reddish, with an admixture of sand in the high-lying, and dark brown in the low-lying lands. In Ichanur there is an extensive area of stony soil of an inferior description. There are numerous tanks, some of them, especially in the south, being of considerable size. The principal dry crops are ragi, avare, horse-gram, chillies, and tobacco, with patches of castor and other oil plants. Rice is the general wet crop, sugar-cane cultivation being very limited. Some wheat is also produced. The gardens are almost entirely cocoa-nut, both irrigated and unirrigated. Areca-nut is limited to gardens specially well situated and having a good water supply. In these are also grown betel-leaf, plantains, and vegetables, while in the dry cocoa-nut gardens ragi and same are produced. The cocoa-nuts of Honnavalli are celebrated for their flavour. The taluq suffered very much in the famine of 1877-8.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1880. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\n| Description                                      | Acres |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Culturable (dry, 127,550; wet, 3,980; garden, 17,472) | 149,002 |\n| Unculturable (roads, village sites, &c.)          | 54,826 |\n| Inam villages (4,977), Amrit Mahal kavals (10,705) | 15,682 |\n\nTotal acres 219,510\n\nOf the culturable area, 63,746 acres were waste.

The trunk road from Bangalore to Shimoga passes through in the same direction, a little north of the railway line. From Tiptur there are roads south-west to Hassan, south to Chanraypatna, and south-east to\nTuruvekere. This latter continues on to Mayisandra, where it meets the Gubbi-Seringapatam road, with a branch to Yediyur. From Turuvekere a road runs north to Banasandra Railway-station, Chiknayakanhalli, and Huliyar. From Konehalli Railway-station, in the west, there is a road north to Honnavalli and Huliyar.\n\n**Tiptur.**\u2014A large trading-place, situated in $13^\\circ 15'$ N. lat. $76^\\circ 32'$ E. long., 46 miles west of Tumkur, on the Bangalore-Poona Railway and the Tumkur-Shimoga road.

The Jayamangali rises in them on the north, but during its short course in this taluq is of little benefit, owing to the rocky and rugged nature of the country surrounding its banks. The tracts south of the hills are well supplied with tanks, fed by streams which ultimately unite to form the Shimsha. The country around Tumk\u00far is very fertile and highly cultivated; to the westward it is less fruitful. The undulating nature of the country being favourable to the formation of tanks, there are extensive gardens of areca-nut and cocoa-nut, as well as the usual paddy cultivation. The streams, though none of them large enough to supply channels, are yet of great assistance to agriculture, the water after the rains being distributed from them to the adjoining fields by y\u00e1ta and kapile wells.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1871. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 152,516; wet, 14,652; garden, 4,860) | ... | 172,028 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | 66,768 |\n| Total acres | 238,796 |\n\nOf the culturable area, 29,675 acres were waste. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,83,178, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,53,148.\n\nThe average rainfall at Tumk\u00far for 25 years (1870-94) and at the other places for two years (1893-4) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Tumk\u00far | 0\u00b009 | 0\u00b008 | 0\u00b035 | 1\u00b034 | 4\u00b014 | 4\u00b019 | 4\u00b080 | 5\u00b078 | 6\u00b090 | 7\u00b006 | 2\u00b014 | 0\u00b049 | 37\u00b036 |\n| Bell\u00e1vi | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1\u00b030 | 5\u00b001 | 3\u00b078 | 2\u00b071 | 2\u00b040 | 0\u00b056 | 7\u00b044 | 0\u00b035 | \u2014 | 23\u00b055 |\n| Hebbur | \u2014 | 0\u00b020 | 1\u00b045 | 2\u00b089 | 5\u00b020 | 3\u00b035 | 3\u00b070 | 2\u00b000 | 2\u00b005 | 7\u00b005 | 1\u00b015 | \u2014 | 29\u00b004 |\n| Nelhal | \u2014 | 0\u00b013 | 0\u00b078 | 2\u00b075 | 4\u00b030 | 3\u00b098 | 5\u00b053 | 2\u00b093 | 1\u00b050 | 9\u00b050 | 1\u00b045 | \u2014 | 32\u00b085 |\n| Urdigere | \u2014 | 0\u00b045 | 0\u00b088 | 2\u00b035 | 5\u00b020 | 4\u00b082 | 3\u00b079 | 2\u00b009 | 10\u00b093 | 1\u00b045 | \u2014 | 31\u00b096 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Poona Railway runs through the taluq from east to west, with stations at Hirehalli and Tumk\u00far. The Bangalore-Shimoga road is close alongside the railway. From Tumk\u00far there are trunk roads north-west to Chit\u00e1ldroog and north-east to Maddagiri and Pavugada; with a road south to Kunigal, connecting at Hebbur with one from Gubbi on the west.\n\n**Tumkur.**\u2014The chief town of the District, situated in 13\u00b0 20' N. lat. 77\u00b0 9' E. long., 43 miles north-west of Bangalore, with which it is connected by rail and road.\nIt is prettily situated at the south-western base of the Devaray-durga group of hills, on elevated ground, near the waste weir of a large tank. The town is surrounded with gardens of plantains, areca and cocoa-nut palms, and betel vines, besides many groves of well-grown trees. The well water is generally brackish, but three wells close to the town yield sweet drinking water. Some of the streets are wide, forming thoroughfares for the high roads to Bangalore, Bellary, Shimoga and the coffee districts in the west. The native houses are mostly mud-built, of one storey and tiled. Of the European dwellings, which are somewhat scattered, the principal lie to the north beyond the town, but the advent of the railway has, of late years, increased the importance of the southern part.\n\nTumk\u00far is said originally to have formed part of a territory whose capital was Kaidala, now an insignificant village three miles to the south of it. Its name is said to be derived from *tumuku*, a small drum or tabret, the place having been granted to the herald or tom-tom beater of the Kaidala raja. But the earliest form of the name, as given in an inscription of the tenth century, is Tummeg\u00faru (*see* above, p. 161). From the twelfth century it formed a part of the A\u2019nebid-dasari or A\u2019nebidd:jari district (*see* p. 177). Kante arasu, one of the Mysore family, is said to have formed the present town, consisting of a fort, the walls of which have now been levelled, and a p\u00e9te to the east of it.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner\u2019s court is a conspicuous circular building of three storeys. The town contains the usual District offices, a High School, and other public buildings. It is the residence of a European Missionary of the Wesleyan Society, who have here a chapel and several schools.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 7,618  | 8,353  | 8,658  | 14,786 |\n| Expenditure     | 7,177  | 7,639  | 7,990  | 17,872 |\n\n*Turuvekere.*\u2014A town in the Tiptur taluq, 8 miles south of the\nBanasandra Railway-station.

It contains three fine temples, in two of which, dedicated to Chennigar\u00e1ya-sw\u00e1mi and Virabhadra, are inscriptions making gifts of agraharas in the time of the Hoysala king Narasimha, of whose queen Lokamma or Lok\u00e1m-bika it appears to have been the native place. Facing the temple of Gang\u00e1dharesvara is a recumbent bull of large size, elaborately carved in black hornblende from Karekal-gudda, and still retaining a brilliant polish. About 30 years after its foundation Turuvehere appears to have been captured by the H\u00e1galv\u00e1di chief named S\u00e1l Nayak, who committed the government to his brothers Chikka Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja of Mysore and has ever since been a part of the Mysore territory, Ling\u00e1yits form a principal part of the population. Till 1873 it was the chief town of a separate taluq, named after it.\n\nThe inhabitants depend for water entirely on the tank, which is fed by a stream called the N\u00e1ga and contains much lotus.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 661    | 570    | 492    | 634    |\n| Expenditure     | 678    | 560    | 571    | 645    |\n\nYediyur.\u2014A village in the Kunigal taluq, 12 miles south west of the kasba, on the Bangalore Hassan road.

The greatest length from east to west is about 97 miles; from north to south the extreme distance is about 102 miles.\n\nArea.\u2014The area of the District is 5,517 square miles, of which 1,914 square miles are under cultivation, and 2,356 square miles unculturable and waste.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by the Hassan and Tumkur Districts; east by the Bangalore District and the Coimbatore Collectorate; south by the Nilgiri and Malabar Collectorate; west by Coorg.\n\nDivisions.\u2014The District was extended to its present dimensions in 1882 and 1886, and is composed of thirteen taluqs and one j\u00e1gir. Five taluqs\u2014Krishnar\u00e1jpet, Malavalli, Mandya, N\u00e1gamangala, and Seringapatam\u2014form the French Rocks Sub-Division, which was constituted in 1882. Madd\u00far is a sub-taluq under Mandya.\n\n| No. | Taluq            | Area, square miles | No. of Hoblis | No. of Villages or Towns | Population in 1891 | Per square mile |\n|-----|------------------|--------------------|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|----------------|\n| 1   | Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1jnagar    | 479                | 10            | 179                      | 91,250            | 190'50         |\n| 2   | Gundlupet        | 544                | 6             | 179                      | 63,036            | 115'87         |\n| 3   | Heggadadevankote | 621                | 5             | 262                      | 61,226            | 98'59          |\n| 4   | Huns\u00far           | 672                | 10            | 412                      | 113,271           | 168'59         |\n| 5   | Krishnar\u00e1jpet    | 424                | 6             | 362                      | 91,453            | 215'69         |\n| 6   | Malavalli       | 391                | 7             | 223                      | 85,910            | 219'79         |\n| 7   | Mandya           | 452                | 12            | 301                      | 99,783            | 220'76         |\n| 8   | Mysore           | 322                | 8             | 150                      | 134,684           | 418'271        |\n| 9   | N\u00e1gamangala      | 401                | 5             | 354                      | 69,265            | 172'73         |\n| 10  | Nanjang\u00fad        | 384                | 9             | 199                      | 97,374            | 201'49         |\n| 11  | Seringapatam     | 274                | 11            | 210                      | 85,242            | 311'10         |\n| 12  | Tirumak\u00fcdlu Narsip\u00far | 217         | 7             | 138                      | 83,454            | 384'67         |\n| 13  | Vedatore         | 234                | 7             | 180                      | 74,262            | 316'93         |\n| 14  | Yeland\u00far J\u00e1gir   | 102                | 4             | 26                       | 31,754            | 311'31         |\n\nTotal | 5,517 | 107 | 3,175 | 1,181,964 | 214'24\n\n1 Omitting the City of Mysore, the rate is 188'31.\nThe following are the names of taluqs which have been altered:\u2014Hunsur was formerly Periyapatna; Krishnarajpet was Attikuppa; Serinapatanam was Ashtagram; and Tirumakudlu Narasipur was Talakad.\n\nPhysical Features.\u2014The river Kaveri, besides forming the boundary for some distance both on the western and eastern sides, traverses the District from north-west to east, receiving the tributaries Hemavati, Lokapavani and Shimsha on the north, and the Lakshmantirtha, Kabbani and Honna Hole or Suvarnavati on the south.\n\nLofty mountain ranges covered with vast forests, the home of the elephant, shut in the western, southern, and some parts of the eastern frontier. The only break in this mighty barrier is to the south-east, where the Kaveri takes its course towards the Ghats and hurls itself down the falls of Gagana Chukki and Bar Chukki at the island of Sivasamudram. The principal range of hills within the District is the Biligirirangan in the Yelandur Jagir at the south-eastern extremity, rising to a height of 5,091 feet above the level of the sea. Next to these the isolated hills of Gopalswami in the south near Gundlupet, 4,770 feet above sea-level, and of Bettadpur in the north-west (4,389 feet), are the most prominent heights, with Chamundi hill (3,489 feet) south of Mysore. The French Rocks (2,882 feet), to the north of Seringapatnam, are conspicuous points of a line culminating in the sacred peak at Melukote (3,589 feet). Short ranges of low hills appear along the southern parts of the District, especially in the south-west. On the east, in Malavalli taluq, are encountered the hills which separate the valleys of the Shimsha and Arkavati, among which Kabbal-durga (3,507 feet) has gained an unenviable notoriety.\n\nAn undulating table-land, fertile and well watered by perennial rivers, whose waters, dammed by noble and ancient anicuts, enrich their banks by means of canals; such has the Mysore District been described. Here and there granite rocks rise from the plain, which is otherwise unintermittent and well wooded. There is a gradual fall in the level of the country from west to east, Yelwal being 2,826 feet above the sea, Mysore 2,525, and Seringapatam 2,337. The extreme south forms a terai of dense and valuable but unhealthy forest, occupying the depression which runs along the foot of the Nilagiri mountains, the lowest part of which is the remarkable long, steep, trench-like ravine, sometimes called the Mysore ditch, which forms the boundary on this side, and in which now flows the Moyar.\n\nChannels\u2014The irrigated fields under the numerous channels drawn from the Kaveri and its tributaries cover many parts of the District with rich tracts of verdure. For within this District alone there are\n\n1 See Vol. I., p. 27.\nnine anicuts on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, seven on the Lakshmantirtha, five on the Hemavati, one on the Shimsha, one on the Nugu, two on the Suvarnavati (besides temporary ones erected annually), one on the Kabbani, and one on the Gundal. The total length of channels running is 691 miles, yielding a revenue of more than 4 lakhs a year. The importance of these works, which will be more fully described under each river, may be estimated from the following statement:\n\n| Name of River | Name of Anicut | Name of Channel | Length in

4,04,670\nRocks.\u2014The geological formation is principally of granite, gneiss, quartz, and hornblende. In many places these strata are overlaid with laterite. Stone for masonry, principally common granite, is abundant throughout the District. Black hornblende of inferior quality, and potstone are also found. Quartz is abundant, and is chiefly used for road metalling. Corundum occurs in Hunsur taluq. In Singanamaranhalli the corundum beds were found by Mr. Holland (of the Geological Survey of India) to be associated \u201cwith an intrusion of olivine-bearing rocks, similar to those of the Chalk Hills near Salem, and large masses of a rock composed of a highly ferriferous enstatite with magnetite and the iron-alumina spinel, hercynite. The association here is very strikingly like that of the rocks in which the corundum (emery) occurs in the Cortland series of New York State, where there is a development of pyroxenic granulites and ultra-basic rocks, presenting characters precisely similar to those of the charnockite and norite series in South India. A similar association of corundum with hercynite, magnetite, and rhombic pyroxenes has been described on the eastern edge of the Bohemian Forest\u2014the original home of the mineral hercynite.\u201d\n\nMinerals.\u2014Gold dust is sometimes found in the jungle streams of Heggadadevankote taluq. Mining for gold has been experimentally begun near Nanjangud, and exploration for the same purpose near Bannur. Altogether more than 10,000 acres have been taken up for gold-mining. Iron abounds in the rocky hills throughout the District, but is worked only in Heggadadevankote and Malavalli taluqs. The iron ore of the Malavalli taluq is procured from the Sravana hills near Tippur. The smelting furnaces are at Halgur and Husgur. The iron of Malavalli is considered the best in the Mysore territory. Of the quantity produced, about half was exported in a crude state: the remainder was manufactured in the taluq into nearly every description of implements, and of these the larger proportion were exported in various directions. But the indigenous iron manufacture has much declined and become nearly extinct during recent years, being unable to compete with importations from England and other European countries.\n\nStones containing magnetic iron are occasionally turned up by the ploughshare near Devanur of the Nanjangud taluq. The natives hold this ore in high esteem for medicinal purposes, and a magnetic cup was one of the many devices for prolonging life pressed upon the Raja who died in 1868 by his hakims. They have also a strange belief that milk boiled in a magnetic cup will not boil over. It is smelted in the same manner as common iron.\n\nTalc (abhraka) is found in several taluqs. It is used for putting a gloss on baubles employed in ceremonies. Native doctors hold it in\nhigh esteem for flux cases. It occupies the rents and small veins in decomposing quartz, but its laminae are not large enough to serve for glass. The natives commonly believe that it indicates the presence of diamonds.\n\nAsbestos (kaln\u00e1r) is found in abundance in Chamrajnagar taluq. It is used by native physicians as an antiphlogistic.\n\nNodules of flint called chakmukki are found in the east of the District. It was formerly the material for gun flints, and is even now used by the ryots for striking a light with tinder.\n\nSoils.\u2014The red soil is abundant and prevails throughout the District, but of the more fertile black soil, one of the most valuable tracts in the country runs through the south-east in the Chamrajnagar taluq and the Yelandur j\u00e1g\u00edr. In the latter there is probably not a single acre of uncultivated land, excepting on the hills.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate is hotter than that of the Bangalore District, and exhibits greater extremes. While the mean annual temperature is a little over 77, the minimum has been recorded of 50 in January, and the maximum of 100 in March and April. But for the intermittent fevers which prevail during the cold months the climate would be healthy.\n\nTemperature.\u2014The mean meteorological results of observations made at Mysore during 1894 and 1895 are here given as illustrating the monthly variations of the climate.\n| Barometer | Thermometers | Aqueous Vapour | Wind | Rain | Cloud. |\n|-----------|--------------|----------------|------|------|-------|\n|           | Red. to Sea Level. | Daily Range. | Mean. | Min. | Max. | Press.

The register by months is given under each taluq. The average annual rate for the 26 years at other taluq stations was as follows:\n\n| Station          | Rainfall |\n|------------------|----------|\n| Chamrajnagar     | 20.68    |\n| Gundlupet        | 23.66    |\n| Heggadadevankote | 24.82    |\n| Hunsur           | 30.57    |\n| Krishnarajpet    | 27.79    |\n| Malavalli        | 26.33    |\n| Mandya           | 29.94    |\n| Nagamangala      | 27.41    |\n| Nanjangud        | 26.06    |\n| Seringapatam     | 27.97    |\n| T.

There is generally no rain during the first three months of the year.\n\nThe actual annual fall at Mysore has been registered as follows:\n\n| Year | Rainfall |\n|------|----------|\n| 1837 | 22.7     |\n| 1838 | 20.2     |\n| 1839 | 11.7     |\n| 1840 | 15.8     |\n| 1841 | 33.1     |\n| 1842 | 23.8     |\n| 1843 | 22.6     |\n| 1844 | 34.6     |\n| 1845 | 34.1     |\n| 1846 | 27.2     |\n| 1847 | 25.4     |\n| 1848 | 26.9     |\n| 1849 | 25.4     |\n| 1850 | 36.7     |\n| 1851 | 22.6     |\n| 1852 | 52.8     |\n| 1853 | 37.8     |\n| 1854 | 20.5     |\n| 1855 | 34.8     |\n| 1856 | 26.8     |\n| 1857 | 30.3     |\n| 1858 | 30.2     |\n| 1859 | 27.8     |\n| 1860 | 30.7     |\n| 1861 | 30.2     |\n| 1862 | 35.9     |\n| 1863 | 31.4     |\n| 1864 | 32.2     |\n| 1865 | 30.6     |\n| 1866 | 35.4     |\n| 1867 | 28.46    |\n| 1868 | 29.22    |\n| 1869 | 31.37    |\n| 1870 | 35.63    |\n| 1871 | 27.38    |\n| 1872 | 26.28    |\n| 1873 | 23.17    |\n| 1874 | 28.71    |\n| 1875 | 20.22    |\n| 1876 | 22.80    |\n| 1877 | 31.68    |\n| 1878 | 31.72    |\n| 1879 | 26.28    |\n| 1880 | 46.34    |\n| 1881 | 23.54    |\n| 1882 | 38.99    |\n| 1883 | 37.69    |\n| 1884 | 21.50    |\n| 1885 | 30.54    |\n| 1886 | 33.82    |\n| 1887 | 38.77    |\n| 1888 | 23.80    |\n| 1889 | 32.09    |\n| 1890 | 35.66    |\n| 1891 | 26.84    |\n| 1892 | 40.02    |\n| 1893 | 33.48    |\n| 1894 | 25.45    |\n| 1895 | 32.10    |\n\nThe greatest fall occurred in 1852, when 52.8 inches were measured. This was a year of unusual rain throughout the south of the country. But in 1874, when a like excess occurred in Bangalore, Mysore had scarcely the normal quantity. In 1880 both were abundantly favoured, but in 1892 Mysore had an excess and Bangalore a deficiency.\n\nVegetation.\u2014In this District lies the great belt of forest which, commencing on the west at the Fraserpet bridge, about 10 miles north-west of Periyapatna, extends continuously for 80 miles to a point a few miles south-east of Bandipura in the Gundlupet taluq. From the Fraserpet bridge to the Viranahosahalli jungle in Periyapatna, the Mysore portion of this belt varies from 1\u00bd to 3 miles in breadth, and contains in abundance honn\u00e9,\u00b2 matti,\u00b3 arsentega,\u2074 dindiga,\u2075 naval\u00e1di,\u2076\n\n\u00b9 From Captain van Someren's Forest Report. \u00b2 Puercarpus marsupium. \u00b3 Terminalia tomentosa. \u2074 Nauclea cordifolia. \u2075 Conocarpus latifolia. \u2076 Vitex alata.\nud\u00ed, huluve, banni, a few blackwood-trees, and here and there patches of ill-grown stunted teak. Here the belt increases suddenly to 5 or 6 miles in breadth, and a portion of it is known as the Viranahosahalli jungles. The jungles of Metikuppa and Hunasekuppa adjoin the Viranahosahalli jungles, and between Bisalv\u00e1di on the west and R\u00e1mpura on the banks of the Nugu in the east, is that portion of the Heggadadevank\u00f3te taluq, which, measuring about 20 miles in length by 7 to 10 in breadth, contains the teak forests of Bisalv\u00e1di, K\u00e1kan-k\u00f3te, B\u00e9g\u00far and Ain\u00faru M\u00e1rigudi. Crossing the Nugu and passing through some thriving villages, a walk of about three miles brings one to the jungles of Beramb\u00e1di and Bandipura in the Gundlupet taluq. From Bandipura up to Yelandur the belt of forest again narrows. Much sandalwood is intermixed with it, very little teak is seen, open glades are common, and the country is very hilly.\n\nThe only other wooded portion of this District is the eastern taluq of Malavalli. There k\u00e1r\u00e1chi is not uncommon round the Basavana-betta hill, and bamboos are abundant. Honn\u00e9, matti, and ippe are abundant, but the vegetation generally is poor. The dindiga-tree, which yields a valuable gum, grows abundantly.\n\nThe Huns\u00far taluq has a comparatively heavy rainfall in the west, where it borders Coorg, and several very fine specimens of mangoes, tamarinds and banyans grow round the villages. In this and the Heggadadevankote taluqs to the south, the fields are frequently divided by quick hedges or bamboo fences, among which bushes of various kinds have sprung up, and which much favour the growth of sandalwood. This marking off of fields by hedges is not common in Mysore. Parts of Periyapatna are covered with thousands of the date-palm (P. sylvestris), growing in the waste lands, and further south on the road to Heggadadevankote are two large fuel tracts known as the Paduvakote and Janapanahalli jungles; much of the tree vegetation would, if enclosed, grow up into useful timber. The Heggadadevankote taluq has much forest in it, and the b\u00e1b\u00fal is very common in fields.\n\nThe taluq of Mysore has no forest, but b\u00e1b\u00fal-trees grow all over it in the fields. There are several planted topes of mangoes and banyans, and the j\u00e1mun-tree grows well in many parts. Some thriving cocoa- and areca-nut gardens are scattered throughout it. The taluq of Seringapatam is well irrigated by channels, and grows much rice and sugar-cane, as does the taluq of Tirumakudlu Narsipur in the east; but trees, except in planted groves, are scarce. Vedatore, another rice-growing taluq, is also bare of forest or large tracts of jungle; but the\n\n---\n\n1 Bignonia falcata.  \n2 Hardwickia binata.  \n3 Bassia latifolia.\nhigh waste-lands are covered with the *cassia auriculata*, and frequently the *cassia fistula*, both of which yield fuel for the use of the surrounding home population. The taluq of Mandya is very thinly wooded, and Maddur sub-taluq is not much better. Gundlupet and Chamarajnagar in the south are well off in this respect, the latter especially so, for in addition to the wood growing close by in the Ummatt\u00far h\u00f3bli, and the jungles in the vicinity of Punjur, the Biligirirangan hills are near at hand. It is a well-watered land, full of paddy fields and rich gardens, strongly fenced in. The Nanjangud taluq has no lack of wood for home consumption.\n\n**Forests.**\u2014The *State Forests* are Ain\u00far M\u00e1rigudi, 39 square miles in extent; Begur, 42 square miles; K\u00e1kank\u00f3te, 36 square miles; Viranhoshalli, Metikuppa and Hunasekuppa, 47 square miles; all in Heggadadevankote taluq. In Gundlupet taluq are the Bandipur, 25 square miles in extent, and B\u00e9ramb\u00e1di, 50 square miles. There are also Chamrajnagar, 40 square miles; Narayandurg, 15; and Hasuv\u00edn K\u00e1val Sandal reserve, 1\u00bd. *District Forests* have been formed at Paduvakote and Janapanhalli, between Hunasur and Antarsante; on Basavanbetta, and between Halgur and the banks of the K\u00e1veri in Malavalli taluq; near the line of State forests running from Bandip\u00far and Anechaukur; and near Atgulipur and Punjur on the road passing Hardanballi to the H\u00e1sanur ghat. There are also 24 plantations under the Forest Department, occupying 1,439 acres. There were in 1895 topes or groves to the number of 2,416, containing 81,402 trees; and 844 miles of road had been planted with avenues.\n\nAttention has been directed to the great drain on the teak forests of the Mysore District, which has been going on from the time of the taking of Seringapatam, or even before that, and which threatens to exhaust the supply. One cause has been that, while in many other parts of India the forests were comparatively untouched owing to want of roads, there were trunk lines of communication passing through several of the forests in the Mysore District, admitting of easy access and the removal of teak and other timber. Teak seedlings are, no doubt, found more or less frequently in these forests, but the undergrowth and surroundings of an old forest seem not to be favourable to the raising of teak seedlings. The formation of regular teak plantations is therefore being carried out in places where the growth of this valuable timber, the demand for which is ever on the increase, may be free and unimpeded; the climate and soil of Mysore in certain parts being specially favourable for its propagation.\n\n**Cultivation.**\u2014The following is a list of the cultivated products of the District:\u2014\n| Kanarese | Botanical                  | English            |\n|---------|---------------------------|--------------------|\n| Baragu  | Panicum miliaceum         | Common millet.     |\n| Bhatta  | Oryza sativa              | Rice.              |\n| Godhi   | Triticum aristatum        | Wheat.             |\n| H\u00e1raka  | Panicum semiverticillatum |                   |\n| J\u00f3la    | Holcus sorghum           | Great millet.      |\n| Kambu   | Holcus spicatus          | Spiked millet.     |\n| Navane  | Panicum italicum         | Italian millet.    |\n| R\u00e1gi    | Eleusine corocana         | Ragi.              |\n| S\u00e1me   | Panicum frumentaceum      | Little millet.     |\n\n**Pulses**\n\n| Kanarese | Botanical               | English            |\n|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Avare    | Dolichos lablab         | Cow gram.          |\n| Chennangi| Lens esculenta          | Lentil.            |\n| Hesaru   | Phaseolus mungo         | Green gram.        |\n| Hurali   | Dolichos uniflorus      | Horse gram.        |\n| Kadale   | Cicer arietinum         | Bengal gram.       |\n| Tadugani | Dolichos catiang        |                   |\n| Togari   | Cajanus indicus         | Pigeon pea, doll.  |\n| Uddu     | Phaseolus minimus       | Black gram.        |\n\n**Oil Seeds**\n\n| Kanarese | Botanical               | English            |\n|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Achchellu| Sesamum orientale       | Gingelli.          |\n| Huchchellu| Guizotea oleifera     | Wild gingelli.     |\n| Haralu   | Ricinus communis        | Castor-oil.        |\n\n**Miscellaneous**\n\n| Kanarese | Botanical               | English            |\n|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| Arale    | Gossypium indicum       | Cotton.            |\n| K\u00e1phi    | Coffea arabica          | Coffee.            |\n| Hoge soppu| Nicotiana tabaccum   | Tobacco.            |\n| Kabbu    | Saccharum officinale    | Sugar-cane.        |\n| Sanabu   | Crotolarea juncea       | Country hemp.      |\n| Uppu n\u00e9rle| Morinda                | Mulberry.          |\n\nThe crops both wet and dry are classed under two heads, according to the season in which they are grown, *hainu* and *k\u00e1r\u016b*. The season for sowing both wet and dry hain crops opens in July, that for sowing k\u00e1r wet crops in September, and for k\u00e1r dry crops in April. It was not uncommon in former times for the ryots to obtain annually both hain and k\u00e1r crops from their wet lands, the hain being the better of the two. It may however be doubted whether their aggregate out-turn in the year was greater than it is at present, as, without plentiful manuring, two crops a year tax wet land very severely. Now, owing to the yearly repair of the channels, and also in part to want of water, it is only under a few rain-fed tanks in the east of the District that both hain and k\u00e1r crops are obtained from the same wet lands in one year.\n\nOn dry lands it is usual to grow two crops in the same year, the latter being a minor grain, if the land is fertile enough to admit of it. Thus horse gram, kadale, hesaru, &c., are often put in immediately after j\u00f3la has been reaped. But of grains which form the staple food\nof the people, such as r\u00e1gi and j\u00f3la, the land will only admit of one crop a year as a rule, consequently the ryots are obliged to choose between a hain or k\u00e1r crop. In the northern taluqs, Yedatore, Mysore, Seringapatam, Mandya and Malavalli, hain crops are preferred, because their growth is then more influenced by the monsoon. But in the southern or Malnad taluqs, the ryots generally find a k\u00e1r crop more desirable, because while their jungle springs and the rain, which there falls more frequently, afford them a tolerable supply of water all the year round, the south-west monsoon, which falls with greater force on the forest land, would render ploughing operations in June laborious.\n\nThe k\u00e1r crops of paddy are further divided into Tula k\u00e1r, Kumbha k\u00e1r, and M\u00e9sha k\u00e1r. When the ryots are well supplied with bullocks and labour, then the Kumbha k\u00e1r crop is sown at the most favourable season, that is at the end of September. But sometimes, owing to deficiency of the aforementioned requirements, part of the crop is sown before and part after the proper season. The former is known as Tula k\u00e1r and the latter as M\u00e9sha k\u00e1r. The Tula k\u00e1r is an inferior crop. Under rain-fed tanks especially, which require some time to fill, the rice harvest is often very late, for many ryots are averse to trusting to future rain, and will not put in their seed until the tank is full.\n\nAll crops can be grown as either hain or k\u00e1r with the exception of certain sorts of paddy, cotton, wheat, gram, (which however is sometimes grown as manure for a wet crop,) h\u00e1raka, bargu, j\u00edrige, kadale, tada-gani, huchchellu, coriander, chillies and turmeric, which are grown as hain only.\n\nThe extensive system of irrigation channels gives special prominence to paddy and sugar-cane cultivation and other wet crops. Owing to the richness of the soil a liberal crop usually rewards the ryot without that constant manuring which is necessary in most other districts. The following is a list of varieties of rice known in the District: dod\u1e0da bhatta, or dappa bhatta, kembhatta, k\u00e9sari, pu\u1e6dr\u00e1j bhatta, chambe, kava\u1e0daga, kari bhatta, punugur\u00e1j, b\u00f3l mallige, ganda sarige, chinna sarige, kendalu, sukad\u00e1s, bil\u00e9 bhatta, kare k\u00e1ru, j\u00edrige sanna, haladi sanna, arsina sanna, k\u00e1r sanna, kalijy\u016br sanna, sal\u00e1ki sanna, g\u00f3b\u00ec sanna, sakl\u00e1ti sanna, bang\u00e1r ka\u1e0d\u1e0di, munduga or mur\u1e0duga (bara bhatta). The last named is grown by beng\u0101r or dry cultivation, and only needs a moist situation and a fair supply of rain. It has been found impossible to define exactly the season at which each is grown, on account of the different observances of each taluq in this respect. The usual period which elapses before the paddy arrives at maturity is six months, but two or three varieties, kar\u00e9 k\u00e1ru, for instance, require only $3\\frac{1}{2}$ months, while others, such as dod\u1e0da bhatta and mundaga require seven\nmonths. The sanna paddy is of superior quality to the others, and from it table rice is cooked.\n\nAs is the case throughout India, there are three methods of rice cultivation, both in hain and k\u00e1r: the bara bhatta or punaji, in which the seed is sown dry on the field; the mole bhatta, in which the seed is not sown until it has sprouted through being soaked in water and packed in leaves; and the n\u00e1ti, by which method the seed is first sown very thick in a small plot of ground and transplanted into the field when the shoots are a foot high. The last is the most common, and yields the best crop.\n\nAll the varieties of rice can be cultivated according to the n\u00e1ti or transplantation mode, with the exception of one, that one the coarsest of all, which is known in different taluqs under the several names of mundaga, muradaga, kannel bhatta and bara bhatta, being subject to the rules laid down for the bara bhatta (broad cast) or punaji method.\n\nR\u00e1gi (eleusine corocana) is the staple food of the District. The poorer classes and those who gain their bread by manual labour are here greatly prejudiced against rice, and fully appreciate the strengthening qualities of r\u00e1gi. The varieties of r\u00e1gi are kempa or yelchegan, hulupar\u00e9, kari, boliga, hasargambi, kari banduga, bili banduga and kari k\u00e1di. Of these, the two first are the most esteemed, and the two last held in least repute. The different kinds are not usually separated, three or four being often sown in the same field. Owing to the exhaustive nature of r\u00e1gi, the land on which it is sown will not ordinarily support another crop during the same year. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. R\u00e1gi straw is reckoned the best fodder for cattle, and they will thrive and work on it alone without requiring gram, which is not the case with respect to paddy-straw. It also supplies a very nourishing but too heating fodder for horses when grass is scarce. This grain thrives best on a rich red soil, and grows either in the hain or k\u00e1r season.\n\nTobacco is grown extensively in Huns\u00far and Yedatore taluqs and is of a superior quality at Bettadpur. Cotton is grown in the rich black soil which is most abundant in Chamarajnagar, Nanjangud, Tirumakudlu Narsipur and Mandya. Coffee cultivation has been tried but apparently with most success in the region of the Biligirirangan hills. Much attention was paid to promoting mulberry cultivation in the eastern taluqs for the support of silk-worms, but the same fatality for long attended the efforts to rear healthy insects as in other parts. This has now been overcome.\n\nArea under principal crops.\u2014The following figures show the number of acres cultivated in 1892 with the chief crops:\u2014Rice 97,475, wheat 5,911, other food grains 922,546, oil seeds 68,528, sugar-cane 2,505,\ncotton 1,218, tobacco 5,115, vegetables 6,973, cocoanut and areca-nut 30,453; mulberry 6,289.\n\n**Wild Animals.**\u2014The range of elephants extends through nearly the whole belt of jungle which fringes the south and part of the east and west of the District. They are supposed to breed chiefly in the Biligiri-rangan hills. In former years they were a constant source of ruin to the ryots in most of the southern taluqs, and even now they sometimes cause considerable damage to the crops in Heggadadevankote, Hunsur, and Chamarajnagar. But their numbers were found to be decreasing so fast, owing to increased cultivation, that extinction appeared imminent, and on the recommendation of Colonel Elliot, C.B., Commissioner of Ashtagram, the indiscriminate killing and snaring of elephants was provided against by an order of the Chief Commissioner, which appeared in the year 1868. It is now illegal to destroy elephants unless they prove destructive to the crops, in which case a special licence must be obtained. An account of the Keddah department formed in 1874 for the capture and taming of elephants, and of the operations under this head since, has been given in Vol. I., p. 179. Notwithstanding all the captures made, the numbers do not seem to diminish so much as might be expected, considerable catches having been made in 1896 and 1897.\n\nTigers are most numerous in the Heggadadevankote and Hunsur taluqs, in the former being met with everywhere. But, except in some portions of the north, they are found wherever there is sufficient jungle to give them cover. Their numbers have greatly decreased within the last 100 years, owing to the spread of firearms among the inhabitants and increase of cultivation. During the year 1891 only two people in all were killed by these wild beasts in this District\u2014a remarkable example of the increase of civilization since the last century, when all the inhabitants of a village were frequently driven away by the ravages of tigers. Buchanan gives a curious account of Periyapatna in this respect. In his time, tigers had taken possession of the inner fort, and especially of the temples, to such an extent that it was unsafe to enter it even in the daytime, and the inhabitants of the outer fort were compelled to shut themselves up at sunset.\n\nThe usual method of destroying tigers is to mark one down in a thick patch of jungle, and surround it with a strong net about 300 yards in circumference. It is then easily despatched. Great skill is shown by the shikaris, who are generally of either Bedar or Uppaliga caste, in following this plan. Another way is to hang up a loose net across where the tiger is expected to go. He is then driven towards it and, as it falls on him as soon as touched, gets entangled in its folds, when he is killed with spears.\nPanthers are common all over the District. Bison are abundant throughout the ranges frequented by elephants. Bears are found in the highlands, but not now in very great numbers. Sambar are not uncommon, and spotted deer are numerous in the south of the District. Antelope are now scarce owing to the great numbers shot and snared, and it is to be feared that unless preserving is resorted to this animal will become extinct in the District.\n\nBirds.\u2014Peafowl and jungle fowl are common in most of the jungles; bustard on the plains.\n\nFish.\u2014The following are the Kannada names of the larger fish found in the District: kurab or handi, gende, bale, beli, kochal, muchal, ravu, avul, havu (a kind of eel), argin, kal-kove, kal-korma, giral, kun, godle, chani, kotu, kari, kechal, charl, chupped, b\u00e1chanige. Most of these are good eating; some are found only in particular localities, but many are found not only in the rivers but also in the tanks.\n\nDomestic Animals.\u2014The finest cattle in the District, and indeed in Southern India, are the Amrit Mahal or Sultan\u2019s breed, which is supposed to have been originally obtained by Haidar Ali from a conquered p\u00e2l\u00e9gar. The breed was maintained with the greatest care by Tipu Sultan, and fell into British hands after the taking of Seringapatam. It was then placed under the Mysore Government, but subsequently, in 1813, the Commissariat Department of Madras assumed charge of the breed. In 1860 Sir Charles Trevelyan ordered the sale of all the herds, but a few years\u2019 experience showed the inexpediency of this measure, and in 1865 the Madras Government sanctioned the re-purchase of 4,000 cows and 100 bulls of the Amrit Mahal breed. Owing to five years\u2019 neglect it was with some difficulty that this number was collected, although 13,000 head had been sold in 1860. A large number had found their way to Egypt, being bought for the service of the Khedive. The herds were almost entirely in the hands of the Madras Government until 1882, when the establishment was taken over by the Mysore Government, under an agreement to supply the Madras Government with a certain number every year, as might be required, at a stipulated price. The breed is scattered in herds throughout the Mysore Province, the depot being at Hunasur in this District. The k\u00e2vals or grazing grounds are all over the province, the largest being at the Sule-kere tank in Shimoga and at Hanagod near Hunasur. The cattle are driven from one to another according to the state of the grazing.\n\nThe cattle of this breed are as superior to those of any other as a thorough-bred horse is to an ordinary roadster. Their great speed is equalled by their capacity of endurance. With them Haidar Ali\nmarched 100 miles in two days and a half to the relief of Chidambaram, and with them both Haidar and Tipu were generally enabled to draw off their guns in the face of an enemy. That the breed had not deteriorated was shown in the Afghan war, when they proved their superiority to all the other cattle employed, often remaining upwards of 16 hours in the yoke.\n\nIn height, bullocks of the Amrit Mahal breed often reach 54 inches, bulls measure from 45 to 50, and cows from 40 to 45, with frames stout in proportion. The horns are long, and generally thin at the root, the forehead prominent, and the head rather large. In colour, the bulls preferred for breeding are iron-grey or slate-coloured: after being gelt, they gradually become white, a colour of which bulls are seldom born. The cows are generally white, or iron-grey: a mottled brown is not uncommon, but black or light red are seldom or never seen. One of the chief characteristics of the breed is found in their feet, which are remarkably sound and strong. The cows do not yield much milk, which is, however, very rich. These cattle are always in the open air, not being housed at night like the other Mysore breeds. During the wet weather they are all driven down to the Hunasur jungles on the borders of Coorg. They are not worked till they are six years old. This breed is not prolific, the average of births being about 50 per cent. on the number of cows.\n\nThe Hallik\u00e1r is a local breed chiefly found in the hands of a few well-to-do patels. It closely resembles the Amrit Mahal: in fact, if the cattle of this breed were taken in hand and had the same care bestowed on them, they would probably equal the former, to which they are doubtless akin. The bulls of this breed are commonly iron-grey or slate-coloured: the cows iron-grey. The latter, like those of the Amrit Mahal breed, are bad milkers. The rearing of Hallik\u00e1r cattle receives special attention in the N\u00e1gamangala taluq, particularly in and about Karadiballi.\n\nMadesvara betta or Madhugiri is the name given to the large cattle found generally on the borders of the Coimbatore District. The bullocks of this breed are equal in point of size to the Amrit Mahal, but have neither the endurance nor the speed of the latter, and soon knock up in a long stage, especially when ill-fed: their feet, too, are seldom so hard and sound. White, mottled-brown, and light red are the colours most commonly met with. These cattle may also be known by their pendulous dewlaps and long loose sheaths, in which points they differ from both Amrit Mahal and Hallik\u00e1r. The cows are excellent milkers. The finest specimens of this variety are to be met with at Ganjam near Seringapatam, where the merchants are in\nthe habit of picking them up young and feeding them well till they are old enough to work, by which means they attain great size.\n\nThe cattle ordinarily seen in a Mysore village are of a poor description. This is partly owing to want of care and to starvation, and partly to the indiscriminate system of breeding in vogue. Government interference and aid is urgently needed here. The breed will continue to deteriorate until good bulls are introduced and a Government breeding farm organized. Where good grazing is plentiful some improvement in the breed is perceptible, especially on the Coorg frontier; but everywhere there is room for improvement.\n\nBuffaloes, sheep, goats, swine and asses are numerous. The Kurumbars, a jungle tribe, easily tame the young of the wild hog, and there appears to be little or no distinction between the domesticated and wild breeds.\n\nThe live stock of the District consisted in 1893 of 685,100 cows and bullocks, 4,259 horses and ponies, 9,163 asses, 653,920 sheep and goats, and 4,745 pigs.\n\nHISTORY\n\nA District traversed by the sacred stream of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri is assuredly not wanting in puranic legends, associated with every rapid, bend, island and hill in its course. But until a key to these tediously monotonous stories is discovered, if key there be, they must remain unmeaning and unprofitable fables.\n\nNext to the P\u00e1n\u1e0du expedition sent by Yudhishthira, and Sahadeva's attack on Mahishmati, described with such singular details in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata (see above, Vol. I., p. 280), one of the oldest legends of an historical character, and not connected with the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, relates to a city named Manipura, in Kannada Haraluk\u00f3\u1e6de, the site of which is pointed out three miles south-east of Chamrajnagar. It is stated to be the Manipura mentioned in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata, the princess of which, named Chitrangada, was married by Arjuna, one of the P\u00e1n\u1e0du princes.\u00b9 Babhruv\u00e1hana, the son of this marriage, in course of time became king of Manipura. A fight afterwards took place between father and son, owing to the horse destined by Yudhishthira for the asvamedha, the defence of which devolved on Arjuna, having in the course of its wanderings to the Dakshina or south country come to Manipura.\u00b2 Babhruv\u00e1hana, according to the local account, ruled the country wisely and all his people were happy. The rains fell at the right seasons and the crops were abundant. Thus was Manipura equal to\n\n\u00b9 Adi Parva, 7826\u20147833. \u00b2 Asvamedhika Parva, 2303\u20142431.\nIndraprastha. This prosperity invited an attack from two giants named Niv\u00e1ta and Kawacha, who bore a grudge against Arjuna. But Babhruv\u00e1hana applying to his father for assistance, the latter came to the rescue and destroyed them. He then appointed Anjaneya or Hanumanta as guardian of the place and set up his image at each of the gates. The city is said to have been six miles square, with a gate on every side, the position of each being still indicated by an image of Anjaneya. The inscriptions at the place are of the Hoysala kings, 800 years old.\n\nThe earliest mention of Mysore or Mahish\u00fara is referred to the time of Asoka in 245 B.C., when, on the conclusion of the third Buddhist convocation, a ther\u00f3 was despatched to Mahisha-mandala, as to Bana-vasi and other countries, for the purpose of establishing the religion of Buddha. Of other events of those early times, so far as they are connected with this District, we have no certain knowledge until the rise of the Gangas. But an old Jain work of the 10th century says that Bhadrab\u00e1hu, when he came to the south in the 3rd century B.C., with Chandra Gupta, and died on the journey at Sravana Belgola (see Vol. I., p. 287), was on his way to the Punn\u00e1\u1e6da country. This must be the Punn\u00e1\u1e0d described below, and corresponds with the Pounnata mentioned by Ptolemy, whence beryl was obtained in the Roman period.\n\nGangas.\u2014The Ganga dynasty appears to have been established in the 2nd century, and the Ganga kings ruled over the greater part of Mysore till about 1004, their principal territory being known as the Gangav\u00e1di Ninety-six Thousand. They claim Kuval\u00e1la or Kolar as their original city in this country, but tradition credits them with a capital called Skandapura, which is supposed to have been at Gajalha\u1e6d\u1e6di, on the Moy\u00e1r, near its junction with the Bhav\u00e1ni, beyond the south of the Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1ijnagar taluq, west of Satyamangalam. However, in the 3rd century the capital was established at Talak\u00e1\u1e0d on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, in Tirumak\u00fadal Narsipur taluq. At this period the south of the Mysore District was occupied by a kingdom called the Punn\u00e1\u1e0d Ten Thousand, whose capital was at Kittipura, identified by me with Kitt\u00far on the Kabbani, in Heggadadevankote taluq. This Ten Thousand country may correspond with the Padi-n\u00e1\u1e0d or Ten-nad country of later times, of which the name survives in Hadin\u00e1\u1e0d. In the 5th century the Ganga king Avinita married the daughter of the Punn\u00e1\u1e0d R\u00e1ja, Skandavarm\u00e1, and his son Durvinita seems to have absorbed Punn\u00e1\u1e0d into the Ganga dominions. Though Talak\u00e1\u1e0d continued to be the Ganga capital, the royal residence was apparently removed to Makunda (Channapatna taluq) in the 7th century, and in the 8th century to Manne (Nelamangala taluq).\nEarly in the 9th century the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6das, whose capital was M\u0101nyakheta (Malkhed in the Nizam's Dominions), seized and imprisoned the Ganga king, and appointed their own viceroy to administer the Ganga territories. An inscription of the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da prince Kambharasa, or Ran\u0101valoka, probably the first viceroy, occurs in Heggadadevankote taluq.\n\nEventually the Ganga king was restored to power, and in the 10th century there were matrimonial alliances and the greatest intimacy between the Gangas and the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6das. This was especially the case in the time of B\u016btuga, who married the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da king's sister, and whose son married the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6da king's daughter. He had secured the Ganga throne by putting to death the rightful heir, R\u0101chamalla, his brother, or half-brother. But an inscription in Heggadadevankote taluq shows that the chiefs of Bayal-n\u0101\u1e0d and other parts refused to recognize his claims and fought for R\u0101chamalla. At this period the Cholas were at war with the R\u0101\u1e63\u1e6drak\u016b\u1e6das, and, led by their king R\u0101j\u0101ditya, apparently entered the Mysore country in order to attack them, when B\u016btuga, by some treachery, killed the Chola king at a place called Takkola\\(^1\\) and brought the war to an end. This was in 950.\n\n**Cholas.**\u2014But in about 1004 a formidable invasion by the Cholas took place, under the command of R\u0101jendra Chola, son of the reigning king R\u0101jar\u0101ja. They succeeded in capturing Talak\u0101\u1e0d and overthrew the Ganga power, which had ruled over Mysore for nearly a thousand years. Giving to Talak\u0101\u1e0d the name of R\u0101jar\u0101japura, the Cholas speedily possessed themselves of all the country in Mysore south of the K\u0101v\u0113ri, together with that east from Seringapatam, along with the Bangalore and Kolar Districts. In accordance with their usual policy they imposed their own names on the conquered provinces, and the south of the Mysore District thus became the Mudikonda Chola-mandala, the part in which Talak\u0101\u1e0d was situated being called the R\u0101jendra Cholavalan\u0101\u1e0d. Towards the west, partly in Mysore and partly in Coorg, they subdued the Chang\u0101lva kings of Nanjar\u0101yapattana and Piriya Pattana, who in consequence received the name Kul\u014dttunga-Chola-Chang\u0101lva.\n\n**Hoysalas.**\u2014Meanwhile the Hoysalas, whose capital was at Dorasamudra (Halebid in the Belur taluq), had been gradually increasing in power. Vinay\u0101ditya, who came to the throne in 1047, subdued the Malapas or hill-chiefs, who may be identical with the Dan\u0101yaks of Be\u1e6d\u1e6dadak\u014d\u1e6de (on the Gop\u0101lsw\u0101mi hill, Gundlupet taluq). From the account given in Vol. I, p. 336, it will be seen that during the confusion that ensued on the break-up of the Ganga power, nine\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Possibly the Tati-hole, a stream described by Buchanan (I, 413), at Hanur in Coimbatore District, to the south of Sivanasamudra.\nbrothers, called the Nava Dan\u00e1yak, established themselves at Bettada-\nk\u00f3te, and after splitting into two hostile parties, the four victorious ones\ngot possession of Nanjangud and overran all the hill region from the\nsouth of Coorg to Goa, and from Satyamangala to the Bisale Ghat.\n\nBut soon after 1104 the Hoysalas gained a much greater accession\nof power under Bitti Deva (afterwards called Vishnuvardhana), who\nretook Talak\u00e1d and drove the Cholas out of Mysore. The capture of\nTalak\u00e1d itself was effected by his general Ganga R\u00e1ja, who was a\nrepresentative of the old Ganga kings. Vishnuvardhana recovered all\nthe Ganga dominions and took the title of Vira Ganga. In 1117 he\nclaims to be ruling over a territory extending from Nangali (Mulbagal\ntaluq) in the east to Barkanur (in South Kanara) in the west, and from\nKongu (Salem and Coimbatore), Chera (Travancore) and Anamale\n(the hills of that name) in the south to S\u00e1vimale (? in Dharwar) in the\nnorth. The career of the Hoysalas is given in detail in the chapter on\nHistory. It will suffice here to say that on the final destruction of\nDorasamudra by the Muhammadans in 1326, it was to Tondanur\n(Tonnur in Seringapatam taluq) that the Hoysala king retired.\n\nVijayanagar.\u2014In the 14th century the Hoysala dominion came to\nan end, and the Vijayanagar sovereigns next became paramount\nthroughout the south. Narasa, the founder of the second dynasty,\ncaptured Seringapatam in about 1495. A viceroy known as the Sri\nRanga R\u00e1yal, from Srirangapattana (Seringapatam) the seat of his\ngovernment, levied tribute in their name on the neighbouring chiefs,\nand had under his direct jurisdiction the districts of Patna Ashtagram\nand Mysore Ashtagram, with outlying territories to the west. In the\n16th century Jagadeva R\u00e1yal of Channapatna (Bangalore District) held\nsway over the eastern and some of the northern parts of the District.\nAt the same time a line of kings was ruling Padin\u00e1d, in the south of\nthe District, with a city at Yelandur. There were also chiefs at\nUmmatt\u00far, M\u00fag\u00far and other places.\n\nMysore Wodeyars.\u2014Among the feudatory chiefs the Wodeyars of\nMysore, the account of whose origin is given in the first part of this\nwork, rapidly rose to a position of independence. After evading the\npayment of tribute on various pretexts, R\u00e1ja Wodeyar, in 1610,\nsucceeded in gaining possession of Seringapatam. The mode in which\nthis was accomplished is involved in some obscurity. \u201cThe prevailing\ntale states that the viceroy Tirumal R\u00e1j, or Sri Ranga R\u00e1yal, as he is\nsometimes called, being afflicted with the r\u00e0jpura, or royal boil, the\ndisorder most fatal to opulent and luxurious Indians, retired to the\nholy temple of Talak\u00e1d, with the view of being cured by the inter-\nposition of the idol, or breathing his last before the sacred shrine; and\nthat previously to his departure he had selected R\u00e1j Wodeyar of Mysore for the confidential trust of administering the government in his absence; and in the event of his death, of transferring it to his kinsman and heir the Wodeyar of Ummatur.\n\nBut on adverting to the animosities and jealousies which had prevailed for many years between these two persons, and the recent attempt of the viceroy, only three years before, to remove R\u00e1j Wodeyar by assassination, we must reject as contrary to all probability the tale of this singular bequest of confidence and friendship.\n\nForty-six years had now elapsed since the subversion of the empire from which the viceroy had derived his original powers. This sinking and fugitive state, foiled in the attempt to re-establish its government at Penugonda, had now renewed its feeble efforts at Chandragiri. The viceroy himself was worn down with age and disease: his government, long destitute of energy, had fallen into the last stage of disorganization, faction, and imbecility: it is not improbable that, foreseeing its impending destruction, he concluded the best compromise in his power with his destined conqueror; and the manuscript of Nagar Pootia even details the names of the persons, probably of his own court, who had combined (as it is stated, with the permission of Venkatapati Raya, who then reigned at Chandragiri) to compel him to retire. All that can be determined with certainty is, the quiet retirement of Tirumal R\u00e1j to Talak\u00e1d, where he soon afterwards died; and the peaceable occupation by R\u00e1j Wodeyar of the fort of Seringapatam, which thenceforth became the seat of the government of his family. It is certain that until this period the Rajas of Mysore openly professed the religion of the Jangam; but many circumstances afford room to conjecture that it was about this time that they adopted the insignia and ceremonies of the sect of Vishnu; and as the whole of the old court had been of that persuasion, it is highly reasonable to suppose that the real or ostensible conversion of the new Raja was one of the fundamental conditions of their conspiring to depose the viceroy.\"\n\nThe extensive possessions of Jagadeva R\u00e1ya of Channapatna were absorbed in 1630, and the subsequent conquests of the Mysore Rajas speedily brought within their dominion a territory which, at the death of Chikka Deva Raja in 1704, extended from the Palni hills, south of the Coimbatore country, to Midagesi in the north of the Tumk\u00far District, and from the borders of Coorg to Vaniambadi and Carnatic Ghur. That sovereign had with judicious policy maintained a friendship with Khasim Khan, the Mughal general from whom he had purchased Bangalore, now governor of Sira, and through him with the\n\n---\n\n1 Wilks, Hist. Sk. I. 27.\ncourt of Aurangzeb. On the death of Khasim Khan, in 1699, he sent an embassy to the emperor, then at Ahmednagar, with the view of obtaining a recognition of his extended authority, on which occasion it is alleged that the privileges were conferred of sitting on an ivory throne and of using a signet bearing the title of Jagat Deva Raja.\n\nIt is unnecessary in this place to follow the fortunes of the royal family throughout their subsequent career up to 1761, the date of Haidar Ali's usurpation of power; or to describe the conquests whereby this ruler enlarged the Mysore territories, including that of the rich capital of Bednur; the various wars in which he and his son Tipu Sultan engaged; the siege of Seringapatam by the British in 1792; its capture in 1799, the fall of Tipu and the restoration of the Hindu raj. These events have found full and able historians and are described elsewhere, in the chapter on History in Vol. I.\n\nAfter 1799 Mysore became the capital in place of Seringapatam. In 1809, owing to the increasing unhealthiness of the latter, the British troops were removed to Bangalore. A native regiment was quartered at Hir\u00f3d, or the French Rocks, a healthy spot a few miles to the north, until 1867, when it was removed to a new cantonment at Mysore. But the site chosen for this, about three miles to the north, proved so feverish that the troops reverted to French Rocks, until the regiment was withdrawn altogether, in 1881.\n\nThe District formed at first part of the Patnada R\u00e1y\u00e1da or Sub\u00e1yana, and afterwards of the Ashtagram Faujdari. The latter, in 1862, merged in the Ashtagram Division, which included the Districts of Mysore and Hassan. Divisions had been abolished before the Rendition in 1881, and the island of Seringapatam was then made over to Mysore. In 1882 the District was extended by the addition of several taluqs from the Hassan District, which was also abolished. There were thus fourteen taluqs and three sub-taluqs, besides Yelandur j\u00e1gir, included in the Mysore District, of which five taluqs and one sub-tal\u00faq were formed into the French Rocks Sub-Division. In 1886 the Hassan District was restored, but the limits of the Mysore District remained as they now are, embracing the French Rocks Sub-Division.\n\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014The total population of the District, according to the census of 1891, is 1,181,814, composed of 580,737 males and 601,077 females.\n\n*Density.*\u2014There are thus 214\u00b724 persons to a square mile. But the population of the City of Mysore, which numbers 74,048, slightly affects the result; excluding this, we obtain 200\u00b782 persons per square mile.\nTirumakudal Narsipur is the most densely populated taluq, containing 384\u00b767 persons to the square mile. The rate in Yedatore, which is next, is 316\u00b793, in Yelandur 311\u00b731, in Seringapatam 311\u00b710. There are four other taluqs which exceed the average for the District.\n\nBy religion.\u2014The following table shows the numbers under the principal religious heads:\n\n| Religion                  | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|---------------------------|----------|----------|-------|\n|                           | Male     | Female   | Male  | Female | Total | Percentage |\n| Hindus                    | 339,160  | 363,386  | 214,268 | 211,346 | 1,128,160 | 95\u00b746 |\n| Muhammadans               | 15,542   | 14,999   | 9,165  | 8,795   | 48,501    | 4\u00b710 |\n| Jains                     | 720      | 659      | 388    | 391     | 2,158     | 0\u00b718 |\n| Christians                | 906      | 911      | 565    | 565     | 2,947     | 0\u00b725 |\n| Others (17 Parsis, 27 Sikhs, 4 Jews) | 15       | 19       | 8      | 6       | 48        | \u2014    |\n| Total                     | 356,343  | 379,974  | 224,394 | 221,103 | 1,181,814 | \u2014    |\n\nIncrease.\u2014The following figures compare the estimates of population in the kh\u00e1neshum\u00e1ri accounts of 1853\u20134 with the numbers recorded in the censuses of 1871, 1881 and 1891.\n\n| Taluq                  | 1853-4 | 1871 | 1881 | 1891 |\n|------------------------|--------|------|------|------|\n| Chamarajnagar          | 70,750 | 82,214 | 75,224 | 91,250 |\n| Gundlupet              | 33,657 | 58,620 | 54,404 | 63,036 |\n| Heggadadevankote       | 31,995 | 55,703 | 63,794 | 61,226 |\n| Huns\u00fcr                 | 74,730 | 116,632 | 113,334 | 113,271 |\n| Krishnarajpet          | 53,511 | 84,512 | 74,188 | 91,453 |\n| Malavalli              | 49,510 | 75,603 | 71,852 | 85,910 |\n| Mandya                 | 70,822 | 99,873 | 79,640 | 99,783 |\n| Mysore                 | 89,537 | 119,011 | 120,364 | 134,684 |\n| Nagamangala            | 52,528 | 74,825 | 54,615 | 69,265 |\n| Nanjangud              | 36,995 | 93,972 | 85,261 | 97,374 |\n| Seringapatam           | 66,506 | 77,548 | 77,671 | 85,242 |\n| Tirumakudlu Narsipur   | 39,560 | 72,466 | 71,286 | 83,454 |\n| Vedatore               | 37,978 | 66,370 | 61,358 | 74,262 |\n| Yelandur               | (25,000)| 27,459 | 28,103 | 31,754 |\n| Total                  | 733,079 | 1,104,808 | 1,031,094 | 1,181,964 |\n\nSome of the differences are due to redistribution of taluqs and changes in the limits of the District. Up to 1891 there was an apparent increase in the total of 65\u00b781 per cent. in 18 years. But 25 per cent. must be allowed for defective estimate in the kh\u00e1neshum\u00e1ri accounts. The famine caused the total to be reduced by 6\u00b767 per cent. in 1881, but it rose again in 1891 by 14\u00b763 per cent. The net result may be stated at an increase of 29 per cent. in 38 years.\nClasses.\u2014Classified according to occupation and nationality, the population consists of the following divisions:\n\n| Class                        | No.     | Per cent. |\n|------------------------------|---------|-----------|\n| A. Agricultural               | 400,851 | 33.91     |\n| B. Professional               | 68,252  | 5.77      |\n| C. Commercial                 | 115,778 | 9.79      |\n| D.

These account for 1,077,364 or 91.16 per cent. of the population:\n\n| Caste            | No.     |\n|------------------|---------|\n| Wokkaliga        | 325,557 |\n| Holeya           | 173,003 |\n| Lingayita\u00b9       | 155,184 |\n| Kuruba           | 115,805 |\n| Besta            | 59,550  |\n| Musalm\u00e1n         | 45,483  |\n| Br\u00e1hmana         | 42,998  |\n| Upp\u00e1ra           | 34,717  |\n| Panch\u00e1la         | 32,225  |\n| M\u00e1diga           | 23,816  |\n| Agasa            | 19,435  |\n| Banajiga         | 17,811  |\n| Kumb\u00e1ra          | 16,136  |\n| G\u00e1niga           | 15,634  |\n\nBy far the most numerous class of Wokkaliga are the Gangadik\u00e1ra (271,935), then the Telugu Wokkaliga (9,216). Of the Kuruba, 91,441 are H\u00e1lu Kuruba. Of the Besta, 26,034 are Pariv\u00e1ra. Of Musalmans the Shekhs number 28,634, Pathans 7,586 and Sayyids 7,327. The largest sect of Brahmins is the Srivaishnava (6,289), then Hala Kannadiga (5,580), Sm\u00e1rta (3,904), Desastha (3,608), and Badagan\u00e1d (3,298). Of the Panch\u00e1la, 18,498 are Akkas\u00e1le. Of Banajigas, the Telugu (6,438) are the most numerous, then D\u00e1s\u00e1 (5,410).\n\nStock.\u2014The agricultural stock in 1893 consisted of 22,220 carts and 152,848 ploughs. The manufacturing stock included 4,933 looms for cloth, 1,451 for kambli, 239 for girdles, 32 for goni, and 13 for carpets. There are also 1,295 wooden oil-mills.\n\nTanks.\u2014The number of tanks in the District is returned as 2,000.\n\nDwellings.\u2014The dwellings of the people in 1892 consisted of 194,854 houses, of which 166 were terraced, 26,454 tiled, and the rest thatched. The Mysore, Seringapatam, Nanjangud, and Tirumakudlu Narsipur taluqs contain the largest number of first and second class houses.\n\nTowns and Villages.\u2014The District contains 19 Municipal towns, with a population of 140,520, composed of 112,937 Hindus, 929 Jains, 24,354 Musalmans, 2,252 Christians, 17 Parsis, 27 Sikhs, and 4 Jews. The last three are all in Mysore. The following are the towns, with the population of each:\n\n\u00b9 There are also 5,088 included in Wokkaliga.\nThe total number of *asali* or primary villages in 1891 was 3,175, to which were attached 1,701 *dikhali* or secondary villages or hamlets. Of the former 2,759 were populated and 416 depopulated. Government villages numbered 2,818, and in\u0101m villages 357\u2014namely, sarvam\u0101nya 245, j\u014ddi 73, and k\u0101yamgutta 39.\n\n**Great Festivals.**\u2014The principal concourse of people occurs at the following religious festivals:\n\nAt Seringapatam, on the occasion of the *Rathasaptami utsava*, held for one day in January, when 20,000 people come together. At the same place 10,000 people assemble during the *Brind\u0101van\u014dtsava*, kept up a single night in October or November.\n\nAt Melukote, during the *Vairanudi utsava*, held for 12 days from Phalguna or Chaitra suddha 5, more than 10,000 people assemble.\n\nAt Ganjam, where 20,000 people collect for the *Karighatta j\u0101tre*, held for one day in February or March.\n\nAt Sante Kasalgere, Mandya taluq, where 12,000 people assemble for the *Chaud\u0113swara j\u0101tre*, held in March.\n\nAt Bettahalli or Mudukidore in Tirumakudlu Narsipur taluq, where 10,000 people come together on the occasion of *Mallik\u0101rjunaswami j\u0101tre*, lasting 15 days in January or February.\n\nAt Holalu, Mandya taluq, 6,000 people celebrate the *Patnada Amman j\u0101tre*, in February.\n\nAt Boppagaudapura, Tirumakudlu Narsipur taluq, 4,000 people assemble for the *Manteswami j\u0101tre*, held for three days in March or April.\n\nAt the Chamundi hill, on the occasion of the *Chamund\u0113swari Amma rathotsava*, held in October, 4,000 people attend.\n\nAt Marhalli, Malavalli taluq, where 3,000 people come together for the *Narasimhaswami rathotsava*, which lasts for five days in May.\n\nAt Salanur, in Mandya taluq, 3,000 people assemble for the *Bire Deva j\u0101tre*, held once in four or five years.\n\nAt Mugur, Tirumakudlu Narsipur taluq, the *Tibba Devi j\u0101tre*, lasting for 10 days in December or January, is attended by 2,000 people.\n\nAt Chunchankatte in Yedatore taluq, 2,000 people come to the *j\u0101tre*, which lasts for 20 days in January.\n\nBelow the Chunchanagere hill in Nagamangala taluq, 10,000 people come to the *Gang\u0101dhareswara j\u0101tre*, held for 15 days from Phalguna suddha 3.\nAt Somanhalli, in the same taluq, Ammana j\u0101tre held for five days from Margasira suddha 14, attracts 4,000 people.\n\n**Fairs.**\u2014The largest weekly fairs are the following:\n\n| Place          | Taluq         | Day       | No. of Visitors |\n|----------------|---------------|-----------|----------------|\n| Santemarahalli | Chamarajnagar | Tuesday   | 3,000          |\n| Satanur        | Malavall     |           | 1,000          |\n| Nidugatta      | Mandya       | Wednesday | 2,000          |\n| Gangapur       | Tirumakudlu Narsipur | Thursday | 1,000          |\n| Hirol          | Seringapatam |           | 2,000          |\n| Mandy          | Mandya       |           | 1,000          |\n| Terakanambi    | Gundlupet    |           | 3,500          |\n| Malavalli      | Malavalli    | Friday    | 1,000          |\n\n**Vital Statistics.**\u2014**Births.**\u2014The number of births registered in the District during the year 1893\u20134 was 17,447; of which 9,076 were of males and 8,371 of females. This gives a birth-rate of 14\u00b776 per mille of the population.\n\n**Deaths.**\u2014The number of deaths registered was 7,407 males and 6,495 females, making a total of 13,902. The death-rate was thus 11\u00b776 per mille of the population.\n\nOf the whole number of deaths 7,918 were from fevers, 535 from bowel complaints, 821 from small-pox, 385 from cholera, 219 from injuries\u2014namely, suicide 20, wounding or accidents 155, snake-bite or killed by wild beasts 44; from all other causes 4,024.\n\n**Diseases.**\u2014The most prevalent disease in the District is malarious fever. It is usually of the intermittent type, and in the great majority of cases tractable. In the most feverish taluqs, however, splenic enlargement and visceral congestions are not unfrequent. Attacks are most common and severe in the cold season, and when the wind is easterly. The outbreak of cholera seems generally to commence early in the year, about April. It is very rare to hear of a case in the cold season.\n\nAlthough, owing to the elevation of the District and the consequent coolness of temperature, Europeans generally enjoy fair health, fever is somewhat prevalent among them during the months of December, January and February; and exposure to the sun is perhaps more deleterious than in a hotter climate. Both Europeans and natives enjoy the best health during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, at which period the climate is agreeable and invigorating.\n\n**Dispensaries.**\u2014There are 15 taluq dispensaries, the number of patients treated in which during 1892\u20133 was 89,827.\nREVENUE\n\nThe subjoined is a statement showing the revenue of the District for five years:\n\n| Items          | 1890-1. | 1891-2. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. |\n|----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Land revenue   | 15,64,535 | 15,92,944 | 16,30,338 | 16,99,188 | 17,38,171 |\n| Forests        | 6,20,140 | 6,85,166 | 4,56,140 | 5,01,585 | 4,29,455 |\n| Mohatarfa      | 68,069 | 67,888 | 71,530 | 71,963 | 61,529 |\n| Abkari         | 2,86,062 | 3,82,127 | 3,84,092 | 5,86,599 | 5,83,989 |\n| Sayar          | 6,712 | 6,503 | 5,083 | 2,063 | 2,166 |\n| Salt           | 1,361 | 1,042 | 860 | 1,235 | 1,236 |\n| Public Works   | 5,468 | 73,674 | 70,172 | 3,723 | \u2014 |\n| Stamps         | 1,68,294 | 2,27,383 | 2,00,691 | 1,98,189 | 1,96,991 |\n| Law and Justice| 35,653 | 46,945 | 41,889 | 14,666 | 15,623 |\n| Police         | 2,824 | 2,735 | 682 | 50 | 152 |\n| Other items    | 21,983 | 21,991 | 29,494 | 63,667 | 65,326 |\n| **Total Rs.**  | **27,81,101** | **31,08,398** | **28,90,971** | **31,42,038** | **30,94,638** |\n\nTRADE\n\nManufactures.\u2014The articles manufactured in the District are cotton cloths, cumblis, brass utensils, earthenware and jaggory, both cane and date. A little silk weaving is also carried on. Coarse country paper used to be made at Ganjam and Yedatore, but the manufacture has long ceased. The cloths of the best quality are made in Mysore and Ganjam, but in nearly every village the ryots manufacture sufficient to supply their own wants.\n\nGovernment factories connected with the Commissariat were long maintained at Hunasur; consisting of a blanket manufactory, a tannery and leather manufactory, and a wood yard where carts and waggons were built. Although these have been abolished, the District continues to reap the advantage which they conferred in training workmen after the European model. Many of them still remain at Hunasur and are capable of turning out boots, knapsacks, &c., of good quality, some of which have been bought by Government for the use of native regiments and the police. What was formerly the Government Tannery is now in the hands of an enterprising native. For tanning\npurposes the American sumach (*caesalpinia coriaria*), introduced by Dr. Wallich in 1842, and called by the natives divi-divi, used to be considered the best. Excellent cumblis also continue to be made at Hunasur, but the large importation of English blankets has tended to throw them out of the market. Nearly all the country carts used in the District are built at the same place. There are also extensive pulping works for coffee, which is sent here from the Coorg estates.\n\nAnother important factory, established in 1847 by private enterprise, formerly in operation at Palhalli, under the designation of the Ashtagram Sugar Works, was closed some years ago, on the departure and death of the proprietors. Jaggory produced by the ryots from the sugar-cane and from the date-palm was here bought and refined into sugar on a large scale. The process is elsewhere described. Prizes, medals and other honours were awarded to the produce of the Ashtagram Sugar Works at the Universal Exhibitions of London, Paris, &c. The factory had, while in operation, an important influence on cultivation in the neighbourhood, especially of wet lands.\n\n**Commerce.**\u2014The principal exports of the District are: rice, r\u00e1gi, jola, chenna, horse-gram, betel-leaves, oil-seeds, silk, tobacco, hides, sugar, sandalwood and sheep; and the imports: hardware, piece goods, ghee, cotton, wheat and salt. But this list is liable to variation every year as the seasons are bad or good. There is a great demand for grain from the west coast and Coimbatore, and the Nilgiri market derives a portion of its supplies from the Mysore District. There is also considerable trade with Bangalore and Madras. Commerce is not confined to any one caste and a large number of the traders are Musalmans; there are also a great many Lamb\u00e1nis employed, principally on the Nilgiri road.\n\nThe large merchants are chiefly residents in the town of Mysore; and are for the most part of the Kunchigar caste. They employ agents throughout the District to purchase up the grain, in many cases giving half the price in advance before the harvest is reaped. By this means a few men of large capital are able, in a certain minor degree, to regulate the market.\n\nMuch of the trade of the country is carried on by means of weekly fairs or sant\u00e9s, which are largely resorted to, and at Chunchankatte in the Yedatore taluq there is a great annual fair, which lasts for a month. It is upon these that the rural population are mainly dependent for their supplies.\n\nThe following is an approximate statement of exports and imports in 1892\u20133:\u2014\n### MYSORE DISTRICT\n\n| Articles                  | Exports          | Imports          |\n|---------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n|                           | Tons.            | Value in Rs.     | Tons.            | Value in Rs.     |\n| Areca-nut                 | 35\u00bd              | 19,845           | 189\u00bd             | 1,00,931         |\n| Castor-oil seed           | 1,517            | 1,45,545         | 510\u00bd             | 48,512           |\n| Copper                    | \u2014                | \u2014                | 85\u00bd              | 79,645           |\n| Cotton and cotton thread  | 4                | 2,216            | 161\u00bd             | 1,09,280         |\n| Country cloths            | No.              | 5,000            | 80,000           | 80,000           |\n| Gall-nut                  | 370              | 69,084           | 200\u00bd             | 40,020           |\n| Ghee                      | \u2014                | \u2014                | 250              | 2,56,750         |\n| Horse-gram                | 2,000            | 1,54,000         | 500\u00bd             | 38,500           |\n| Hides                     | No.              | 60,213           | 3,000            | 3,000            |\n| Iron and steel            | \u2014                | \u2014                | 600              | 86,620           |\n| Paddy and rice            | 21,930           | 12,91,080        | 11,900           | 5,86,900         |\n| Paper                     | Reams            | \u2014                | 10,000           | 15,000           |\n| Pearls                    | No.              | \u2014                | 4,500            | 22,500           |\n| Piece goods               | No.              | 10,000           | 87,500           | 3,50,000         |\n| Pottery                   | No.              | 48,000           | 3,000            | 10,000           |\n| Ragi                      | 28,000           | 15,68,000        | 5,020            | 2,81,120         |\n| Salt                      | \u2014                | \u2014                | 4,200            | 4,70,400         |\n| Silk, raw                 | \u2014                | \u2014                | 1\u00be               | 16,308           |\n| Silk cloths               | No.              | \u2014                | 105,000          | 6,30,000         |\n| Sugar and jaggory         | 726              | 1,08,000         | 370              | 85,740           |\n| Tobacco                   | 120              | 67,200           | 50\u00bd              | 28,150           |\n| Wheat                     | \u2014                | \u2014                | 300\u00bd             | 60,750           |\n\n### COMMUNICATIONS\n\n**Railways.**\u2014The Mysore State Railway, metre gauge, runs through the District for about 60 miles.

Division, which included the Mysore and Hassan Districts. Till 1882 it was also the name of a taluq, then changed to Seringapatam.\n\nThere were formerly two taluqs\u2014Pattana Ashtagr\u00e1m and Mais\u00far Ashtagr\u00e1m, each of which originally contained eight villages or townships bestowed upon the Brahmans as charitable in\u00e1ms, whence the name ashta-gr\u00e1ma, eight villages. The tract north of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri was called Pa\u1e6d\u1e6dan\u0101 Ashtagr\u00e1ma, as attached to Srirangapa\u1e6d\u1e6dan\u0101 (Seringapatam), and that south of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, Mais\u00far Ashtagr\u00e1ma, from its connection with the city of Mais\u00far (Mysore).\n\nAttikuppa.\u2014The name of a taluq and town, changed in 1891 to Krishnar\u00e1jpet.\n\nBettadpur.\u2014A village in the Hunsur taluq, 20 miles north-west of the kasba, on the Piriyapatna-Hassan road. Population 2,209.\n\nThe isolated conical hill of Bettadpur, 4,389 feet above the level of the sea, is a conspicuous object to all the country round. The place is the principal seat of the Sank\u00e9ti Brahmans. It is said to have been in former times a Jain principality, founded in the tenth century by Vikrama R\u00e1ya, a fugitive from the inundation of Dv\u00e1raka. He, by treachery, overcame some Bedar chiefs who opposed his settlement, and established himself in Vikramapatna, having subdued a territory yielding a revenue of 7,000 pagodas. He was succeeded by his son Chengal R\u00e1ya, regarding whom some curious tales are related. His right ear, it is said, was like that of an ass\u2014a secret known to none but himself and the barber who shaved him. The possession of the secret so troubled the latter that to relieve himself he whispered it to the\n\n1 This would seem to be the same as Mallarajapatna, now an insignificant village on the right bank of the Kaveri opposite to Ramnathpur (Arakalgud taluq, Hassan District).\nsandal-tree in the courtyard of the palace, under which the king was accustomed to be shaved.\u00b9 Some time after, the king being pleased with the performance of some tumblers, at their request presented them with the sandal-tree in the courtyard for the purpose of making a drum. They cut down the tree and made the drum. But when it was beaten it gave forth no other sound than the words the barber had whispered to the tree, and thus the secret became everywhere known.\u00b2 Other stories about Chengal R\u00e1ya are that his arms reached down to his knees, and that the soles of his feet were covered with hair from his never putting them to the ground for fear of killing some living creature, which, according to the Jain faith, would be a heinous sin.\n\nChengal R\u00e1ya was evidently a powerful king. He built Bettadpur in consequence of a dream of his brother's, extended his territory till its revenue amounted to 12,000 pagodas, and formed with Nanjunda Arasu, the Lingayit ruler of Piriyapatna, an alliance which was cemented by the marriage of Vira Raja, son of the latter, to Mallajamma, the daughter of Chengal R\u00e1ya. On this occasion he is said to have renounced the Jain faith for the tenets of the Lingayits. Nanja Raja of Piriyapatna, 180 years afterwards, took the possession and granted the chief a few villages as a j\u00e1gir. In 1645 Piriyapatna and Bettadpur were taken by the Mysore army under the dalavayi Dodda Raja. The j\u00e1gir of the Bettadpur chief was, however, continued until resumed by Tipu.\n\nOn the hill of Bettadpur is a celebrated temple of Mallikarjuna. It has at some period been struck by lightning, whence the common story that the lightning once a year pays a visit to Isvara on the hill.\n\n**Biligiri-rangan hills.**\u2014A range of hills in the south-east of the Yelandur j\u00e1gir, running north and south for nearly 10 miles. On the highest point, 5,091 feet above the level of the sea, is the temple of Biligiri Rangaswami, from which the hills take their name\u2014in Sanskrit Svet\u00e1dri. They are ascended on the Yelandur side by two ghats, one of which is three miles long, very steep and only practicable for pedestrians; the other, now overgrown, was nine miles long and just passable for horses. The slopes are tolerably thickly wooded, the following being the principal trees found: teak, sandalwood, honn\u00e9, matti, bit\u00e9, kul\u00e9, kallub\u00e1gi, dadastu, jald\u00fa, n\u00edra banni, bejilu, kuggi. Long grass everywhere covers the hills, often reaching from 10 to 18 feet in height, which, at the commencement of the hot season, is fired. The only inhabitants are the wild aboriginal tribe of Soligas, who\n\n\u00b9 The similar story of Midas will at once occur to the mind of the European reader.\n\u00b2 There is another tradition, in the south of the District, of a king named Lamba Karna Raya, the long-eared king. (See Terkanambi.)\noccupy isolated hamlets, composed of five or six huts, made of mud and wattles and thatched with grass. Of wild animals, elephants are generally numerous; bison and s\u00e1mbar are common; tigers, panthers, and bears are occasionally met with.\n\nAt the top of the gh\u00e1t is a bungalow, near which is a cinchona plantation. A deep trench surrounds the garden to protect it from wild elephants, which are continually threatening it. With the exception of a small but thriving coffee estate, owned by the sh\u00e1nbh\u00f3g of the temple, there is no other plantation on this side of the Biligiri-rangans, although the soil and climate offer great advantages. Fever, which is prevalent at certain seasons, is one obstacle to settlers, and bad water, which at present has to be brought from tanks at some distance from the bungalow, is another. The temperature of the Biligiri-rangans is moderate, the thermometer seldom falling below 60\u00b0 or exceeding 75\u00b0.\n\nThe temple, which is a short distance from the bungalow, is a shrine of great antiquity, but except from its situation, close to the brink of a precipice, presents no point of interest. It is said to have been repaired by Vishnuvarddhana R\u00e1ya. A car procession takes place in April, to which about 3,000 devotees resort. Some copper-plates at the temple record a grant in 1667 by Muddu R\u00e1ja of Hadinad (see Yelandur) for the god, here called Bilikal Tiruvengalan\u00e1tha. The revenue of the temple is derived from two villages granted by P\u00farnaiya, and amounts to Rs. 945 per annum. On the summit of a hill, 12 miles north from the bungalow, are the ruins of an old fort named Kanchi K\u00f3te, said to have been built by Ganga R\u00e1ja of Sivasamudram for his son-in-law.\n\nChamarajnagar.\u2014A taluq in the south-east.

Near Attikalpur it is crossed by the Gajanur dam, whence springs the Bandigeri channel; and by the Hongalvadi dam, from which a channel of the same name runs to the large tank of R\u00e1masamudram near Chamarajnagar. Temporary dams are constructed by the ryots of stakes, mats and sand after the monsoon is over and when the water of the river is consequently low. By these means are fed the Homma, Alurhalla, Alur Hosahalla, Saragur and Maralhalla channels. There are besides many large and small tanks.\n\nTaken as a whole the taluq is remarkably rich and fertile, consisting of a fine, well-watered, and level plain stretching away north-westwards from the slopes of the Biligiri-rangan hills, which form its eastern and southern boundary. The low forest land at the foot of this range was probably well-populated in former times. The soils are of great variety, ranging from black and rich red to poor and gravelly. The poorer soils are on the slopes and watersheds towards the west, rapidly improving in depth and quality towards the east and in the valley of the Honnu-hole.\n\nJola is the staple dry crop; among the others, absence of cotton cultivation is remarked. The black soils produce almost all crops peculiar to such soil, including mulberry without irrigation; double crops in dry soil are not uncommon. In the wet lands comparatively little sugar-cane is raised. The gardens of areca, cocoa-nut and betel on the banks of the Honnu-hole are very fine. Date groves abound in all the hollows, when otherwise unoccupied, the tree being here very prolific. A very short neglect of gardens is sufficient to convert them into dense date-topes. There is some coffee cultivation, under European management. The original elephant keddahs are in the forests to the south-east.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1877 into 30 villages, occupying a tract of $61\\frac{1}{2}$ square miles in the south-east, bounded by the Yelandur j\u00e1gir on the north, the Biligiri-rangan hills on the east, and the Honnu-hole on the west, which it was intended to form into a j\u00e1gir\nfor the grandsons of the former Maharaja. But the general revenue settlement of the taluq was introduced in 1894. The area at this time was thus distributed:\n\nCulturable (dry, 82,796; wet, 3,897; garden, 3,372) ... 90,065\nIn\u00e1m villages ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 42,575\nState forests (68,059); k\u00e1vals (9) ... ... ... ... 68,068\n\nTotal acres 200,708\n\nThe unoccupied area was 3,501 acres. The whole of the Bedarpur and Ummattur hoblis are in\u00e1m, forming the endowments of the Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1jesvara temple. The total revenue demand of the taluq for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,65,000, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,08,689.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1jnagar for 26 years (1870\u201395) has been as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0'12 | 0'43 | 1'39 | 4'60  | 1'05| 0'75 | 2'12 | 2'47 | 4'82  | 2'43 | 0'50 | ...  | 20'68|\n\nThe trunk road from Nanjang\u00fad connects Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1jnagar with the railway there and continues on to Coimbatore by the Hasanur ghat. A road from Gundlupet crosses this at the kasba and is carried on to Tirumakudal-Narsipur. A branch from the Nanjang\u00fad road runs through Ummattur to Yelandur.\n\nChamarajnagar.\u2014A town situated in 11\u00b0 55' N. lat., 77\u00b0 E. long., 36 miles south-east of Mysore, on the Hasanur ghat road, and 22 miles from the railway at Nanjang\u00fad. Head-quarters of the taluq of the same name and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus             | 1,935  | 2,106    | 4,041  |\n| Muhammadans       | 247    | 269      | 516    |\n| Jains             | 53     | 61       | 114    |\n| Christians        |        | 4        | 4      |\n| Total             | 2,235  | 2,440    | 4,675  |\n\nIt is situated in a plain composed of black cotton soil and is a thriving place. The principal Jain bast\u00ed was erected in 1117, under the Hoysala king Vishnuvarddhana, by his general Punisa-R\u00e1ja, who claims to have terrified the Todas, captured Nilagiri, and made himself master of Kerala or Malabar. Its present name was bestowed in 1818 by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja Krishna R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore, who, on learning that his father, the unfortunate Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1j Wodeyar, was born\nthere, resolved to dedicate the town to his memory. He accordingly changed the name from Arako\u1e6dh\u0101ra\u00b9 to Ch\u0101mar\u0101j\u00f1agar, and in 1825 founded there a large temple to Ch\u0101mar\u0101j\u0113svara. This he endowed in 1828 with sarvam\u0101nyam villages yielding a yearly revenue of about Rs. 17,000 and an establishment consisting of an Amildar and 157 subordinates. As a work of art this temple contrasts unfavourably in point of durability and beauty with the old temple which it was intended to supersede, and from which most of the materials employed in its construction were procured. As in the temple at Nanjang\u016bd, its outside walls are surmounted with representations of the different deities ranged in rows, so that each votary may find his patron saint without trouble. At about the same time the R\u0101ja had a palace erected at Ch\u0101mar\u0101j\u00f1agar, an unshapely and ill-constructed building in the eastern style. A number of additional shrines in the temple were provided in 1850 and 1851 by some of the royal ladies.\n\nTwo miles east of the town is the populous suburb of R\u0101masamudram, containing 4,693 people, near to which are the ruins of an extensive city of antiquity, whose name, according to tradition, was Manipur.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 699    | 1,103  | 1,075  | 1,989  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 1,593  | 1,755  | 1,236  | 2,644  |\n\nChamundi.\u2014A rocky hill two miles south-east of the fort of Mysore, rising to a height of 3,489 feet above the level of the sea. Owing to its isolated position and precipitous sides it renders the position of Mysore conspicuous from afar. The oldest temple on the hill is that of Marbbala or Mah\u0101balesvara, which was endowed by the Hoysala king Vishnuvarddhana in 1128, and in 1620 by the descendant of the Vijayanagar kings, ruling at Chandragiri.\n\nThe hill takes its name from the goddess K\u0101l\u012b or Ch\u0101mundi, the consort of Siva, held to delight in blood, who is worshipped in a temple on the summit. Human sacrifices were common here in old times, but were rigorously put a stop to under the administration of Haidar. Krishna R\u0101ja Wodeyar III. repaired this shrine in 1827 and furnished it with a tower. In 1848 he presented it with the simha-v\u0101hana and other animal cars used in processions. A flight of stone steps leads to the top of the hill, and two-thirds of the way up, cut out of the solid rock, is a colossal figure of Nandi, the holy bull on which\n\n\u00b9 Properly ari kuth\u0101ra, an axe to the enemy.\nSiva is mounted in the mythological sculptures. The height of the figure is not less than 16 feet; the animal is represented in a recumbent posture and hung with trappings and chains of bells. Although the carving is in no way extraordinary, yet the gigantic size, the correct proportions of the statue, and the labour that must have been expended on it, render it inferior to no work of art of the kind in South India. Dodda Deva R\u00e1ja, who ascended the throne in 1659, and of whose character religion was the chief feature, was the author of this remarkable monument of devout zeal.\n\nThere is a bungalow at the top belonging to the royal family, which may be reached by a road carried along the northern slope, the distance by this way being 7 miles from Mysore.\n\n**Chunchan-katte.**\u2014A dam across the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, in Yedatore taluq, built in an advantageous position a short distance from the head of a narrow gorge called Danushk\u00f3ti,\u00b9 and a few hundred yards above the spot where the river falls from 60 to 80 feet in a succession of cascades. The R\u00e1masamudram channel led off from this dam, together with the anicut itself, were constructed by Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja Wodeyar, who came to the throne in 1672. The rapids in the river invest the spot with great sanctity: hence a large festival is held here annually in January, attended by upwards of 2,000 people.\n\n**French Rocks.**\u2014The hills so called at Hirodi (see below). The highest point is 2,882 feet above the level of the sea.\n\n**Hirodi or French Rocks.**\u2014A town, formerly a military station, 4 miles north of Seringapatam, on the Mysore-Nagamangala road.\n\nIt is now the head-quarters of the French Rocks Sub-Division, and a municipality. The Sub-Division was formed in 1882 and includes the Krishnarajpet, Malavalli, Mandya, Nagamangala and Seringapatam taluqs.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 823   | 824     | 1,647 |\n| Muhammadans       | 268   | 364     | 632   |\n| Christians        | 73    | 118     | 191   |\n| **Total**         | **1,164** | **1,306** | **2,470** |\n\nThe French in Haidar\u2019s and Tipu\u2019s service were encamped here, whence its European name. A regiment of Madras Native Infantry was quartered in the cantonment until 1881, when it was given up as a military station.\n\n\u00b9 An old inscription describes it as Sita\u2019s bathing-place, and calls upon all who catch fish there to make an offering to her shrine.\nGanjam, or Shahar Ganjam, a village at the east end of the island of Seringapatam, being a suburb of the city (which see). It was established by Tipu Sultan, who, in order to provide it with an industrial population, transported thither twelve thousand families from Sira (Tunkur District), which had been the seat of the Mughal Government. The place was dismantled by him in 1799, under the impression that the British Army of invasion would make use of it as they did in 1792. After the capture of Seringapatam, the village was laid out afresh and rapidly regained prosperity, in spite of its reputation for unhealthiness. It contains a number of well-to-do merchants, and country cloths are made. The former paper manufacture has entirely ceased.\n\nGopalswami betta.\u2014A lofty hill of extremely picturesque appearance, 10 miles south-west of Gundlupet, rising to a height of 4,770 feet above the level of the sea. An ascent of three miles leads to the top, and the base of the hill may be estimated at 16 miles in circuit. Its name is that of the shepherd god of the Hindus, an incarnation of Vishnu. In the puranas it is called Kamaladri and Dakshina Govardhangiri. The hill abounds in springs, and to its extraordinary moisture and the strata of argilla that compose it may be attributed its remarkable verdure. From a distance its summit appears surrounded by an entrenchment, the remains of the old walls carried round its sides. It is generally enveloped in clouds and mist, whence its name of Himavad G\u00f3p\u00e1lsw\u00e1mi betta; but when the weather is clear it commands a most extensive view of Mysore and the Wainad. Inside the old fort is a temple dedicated to G\u00f3p\u00e1lsw\u00e1mi, who is said to be heard blowing on his flute on certain occasions. Allusion has already been made to the history of the place (p. 221: also Vol. I, p. 336). It was fortified by Somana Dan\u00e1yak, and under the rule of the nine brothers named the Nava Dan\u00e1yak, bore the name of Be\u1e6d\u1e6dada-ko\u1e6de or hill fort. The scene of the perilous leap by one of the Dan\u00e1yaks on the north side, on the occasion of its capture, is still pointed out. At present the hill is uninhabited, except by two Brahmans belonging to the temple. An annual car festival is held there.\n\nGundlupet.\u2014A taluq in the south. Area 544 square miles. Headquarters at Gundlupet. Contains the following h\u00f3blis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Gundlupet, 4,022; Terakanambi, 2,178; Kabbilli, 1,819; Hangala, 1,578; Kelasuru, 1,552; B\u00e1chahalli, 1,335; Hosapura, 1,328; Kadasoge, 1,258; Padagur, 1,191; Bommalapura, 1,171; Huriyalla, 1,021.\n\nThe west and south of the taluq are occupied by extensive forests, covering 180 square miles, and including the Berambadi and Bandipur, reserved by the State. But these parts were probably more populous formerly. Pierced by good roads, affording egress both westward and southward, these forests present no inconvenience to the well-populated tracts lying east and north, except perhaps in being considered somewhat prejudicial to health. The inhabited portions of the taluq are separated from the vast forests beyond by a range of hills running parallel to the west and south boundary lines, and culminating in the G\u00f3p\u00e1lsw\u00e1mi hill, which is situated at the angle where they diverge. There is also a range of hills to the north of Hangala h\u00f3bli, intervening between it and Terakanambi and Gundlu h\u00f3bli.\n\nThe soils of the taluq vary considerably, running from good black or brown cotton soil to poor, shallow and rocky, the gradations being more marked in dry than in wet lands, which are more uniform in quality. The good soils generally are to the east and south-east, becoming more shallow as the forests and hills westward are approached.\n\nJola is the staple dry crop. R\u00e1gi is also largely grown, but its cultivation is limited by the quantity of manure available, of which it requires a liberal allowance. Cowdung is the principal manure, and it is not so much used for fuel as elsewhere. A second crop of pulses or grain is commonly obtained off dry lands. Togari and avare are sown independently, with castor-oil, and not with jola or r\u00e1gi. The area under wet crops is small. A very superior kind of rice is raised under the Vijayapur tank, but the rest is quite ordinary, and the little sugar-\ncane grown is of poor quality. No leaf-manure is used even in rice cultivation. The gardens contain little or no areca-nut or cocoa-nut, but betel-leaf is extensively grown, and is of special quality and value. Along the banks of the Gundal river and its feeders are large groves of the toddy-palm.\n\nThis river flows through the taluq from south to north, and falls into the Kabbani at Nanjangud. A masonry dam built across it near Komarvalli irrigates the lands in the neighbourhood. Along the southern boundary of the taluq runs the Moy\u00e1r, which unites with the Bhav\u00e1ni in the east beyond.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1891. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 118,444; wet, 1,463; garden, 826) | ... | ... | 120,733 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 114,361 |\n| Forests (115,000); In\u00e1m villages (2,131) | ... | ... | 117,131 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **352,225** |\n\nThe extent of unoccupied land was 7,645 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,10,615, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,27,613.\n\nThe average rainfall for 26 years (1870-95) at Gundlupet, and for three years (1893-5) at the other station, was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| Gundlupet | 0\u00b006 | 0\u00b011 | 0\u00b061 | 3\u00b000 | 4\u00b039 | 1\u00b066 | 1\u00b042 | 1\u00b077 | 2\u00b076 | 4\u00b089 | 2\u00b056 | 0\u00b043 | 24\u00b082 |\n| Begur | \u2014 | 0\u00b015 | 1\u00b005 | 3\u00b085 | 3\u00b057 | 1\u00b087 | 1\u00b039 | 1\u00b039 | 1\u00b093 | 6\u00b094 | 1\u00b022 | \u2014 | 23\u00b036 |\n\nThe Mysore-Ootacamund and Mysore-Gudalur road runs through Gundlupet, whence also there are roads eastwards to Chamarajnagar and westwards through Sultan\u2019s Battery to Cannanore. From Begur, 9 miles north of the kasba, there is a cross road to Sargur and Heggadadevankote.\n\n**Gundlupet.**\u2014A town situated in 11\u00b0 49' N. lat. 76\u00b0 45' E. long., near the left bank of the Gundal river, 36 miles south of Mysore, on the Mysore-Ootacamund road, and 24 miles from the railway at Nanjangud.

Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja gave it its present appellation and first made it a place of note in 1674. This prince appears to have acquired an interest in the Gundal territory from the fact that his early life had been passed in confinement at Hangala, an obscure fort to the south of Gundlupet. There his father died, and no sacred stream being at hand, the body was conveyed to the Gundal river at Vijayapur and there burnt. Chikka Deva Raja, after performing the last rites under the eye of his guards, returned to his prison at Hangala. He afterwards built an agrah\u00e1ra near the site of his father's burning-place, enlarged the fortifications of the town, and constituted it the great commercial emporium of this part of his dominions. Over his father's tomb he founded a pagoda of Aparamita Parav\u00e1sa D\u00e9va,\\(^1\\) which he richly endowed, and which remained in a flourishing state till the accession of Tipu Sultan, who withdrew its allowances. Nothing now remains of the agrah\u00e1ra, and the fine old temple has been allowed to fall into decay.\n\nThe rising town of Gundlupet gradually eclipsed the old fort of Terakan\u00e1mbi in importance, and has ever since remained the chief town of the taluq, although often depopulated by fever. The fort of Gundlupet, a rude mud-and-stone structure, still remains, though somewhat ruinous. It was last repaired under the government of Krishna R\u00e1ja Wodeyar III. The town has benefited by the opening of the railway to Nanjang\u00fad, and considerable transit passes through it to the Nilagiris by the Segur and Gudalur ghats, and to the Wainad and Malabar.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 1,045  | 1,278  | 1,119  | 2,428  |\n| Expenditure    | 992    | 1,842  | 2,056  | 3,245  |\n\nGundal.\u2014The Gundal or Kaundinya river is formed by streams issuing from the southern hills stretching east from G\u00f3p\u00e1\u0301lsw\u00e1mi betta. With a course due north, past the chief town, through the Gundlupet taluq, it enters the Nanjang\u00fad taluq, where, continuing in the same general direction, it forms the Nars\u00e1mbudhi tank and discharges itself into the Kabbani at Nanjang\u00fad. Though scarcely more than a monsoon stream, its waters are much utilized for irrigation. It is crossed\n\n\\(^1\\) The God of Perpetual Exile.\nby an anicut at Halhalli. The reventue below the tank and its sluice channels amount to Rs. 4,906 from 470 kandis of land.\n\n**Hadinaru**, more properly Hadi-n\u00e1\u1e0du,\\(^1\\) a village in the Nanjang\u00fad taluq, 5 miles north-east of the kasba, head-quarters of the Hadin\u00e1ru h\u00f3bli. Population, 1,857.\n\nIt is historically interesting as having witnessed the first step to power of the ancestors of the Mysore R\u00e1jas. Two young men, belonging it is said to the Y\u00e1dava tribe, being induced to push their fortunes in the south, halted at Hadin\u00e1ru, probably in the 15th century. At that time the Wodeyar of the place, being of unsound mind, had \"wandered forth into the wilds,\" and the p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1r of the neighbouring village of K\u00e1rugahalli, who was of the Toreyar caste, had taken advantage of the defenceless state of Hadin\u00e1ru to demand a daughter of the house in marriage. To this request the Wodeyar's family had been compelled to yield a reluctant assent, when Vijaya and Krishna, the two young adventurers from the north, appeared on the scene and espoused the cause of chivalry. By a stratagem they succeeded in slaying the low-caste p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1r of K\u00e1rugahalli, and the daughter of the Wodeyar, delivered from her persecutor, became the bride of Vijaya, who thereupon assumed the government of Hadin\u00e1ru and K\u00e1rugahalli, and is the ancestor of the Mysore R\u00e1jas. These two villages may therefore be considered as the nucleus of the Mysore State.\n\n**Heggadadevankote.**\u2014A taluq in the south-west. Area 621 square miles.

In Ganga inscriptions of the 10th century it appears as Adir\u00e1ru: in a Hoysala inscription of 1196 it is called Hadin\u00e1du, and also in a Vijayanagar inscription of 1585. Hadin\u00e1du would represent the old Pacin\u00e1du (see under Yelandur) or Ten na\u1e0ds, possibly the Punn\u00e1\u1e0d Ten-Thousand (see above, p. 220).\nMalali, 1,505; Kitt\u00far, 1,443; Hebbelakuppe, 1,332; Bidagal, 1,309; Heggadadevankote, 1,295; N\u00e9rle, 1,124; I\u021bna, 1,122; S\u00e1gati, 1,045; Mull\u00far, 1,002.\n\nA large proportion of the taluq is covered with forest, especially in the west and south. The State teak forests of K\u00e1kankote, Begur and Ainur M\u00e1rigudi, with other forests, occupy an extent of 130 square miles. In the first are situated the principal elephant keddahs.\n\nThe river Kabbani, rising in North Wainad, has a tortuous course through the taluq from south-west to north-east, passing near the town of Sargur. The west of the taluq is watered by the Nugu, which also has its source in Wainad, and with a northerly course falls into the Kabbani in the north, near the village of Hampapur. The Nugu is crossed by a dam at Lakshmanpura, whence springs an irrigation channel, 4 miles in length. But the principal irrigation channel is one drawn from an anicut on the Lakshmantirtha in Hunsur taluq.\n\nWherever land is cultivated it is found fertile and produces fine crops of r\u00e1gi. Except when the soil is poor, it is customary to raise two dry crops in the year. Red and dark brown soil is general. Wet cultivation is limited, partly owing to the unhealthiness of the irrigated tracts. There is little or no garden cultivation.\n\nThere is evidence that the taluq was probably far more populous in ancient times than it is now. Kitt\u00far, called in an inscription of 1027 \"the royal residence, the immense great city Kirttipura,\" was the capital of the Punn\u00e1d Ten-Thousand, which occupied the south of the Mysore District from the earliest times (see above, p. 220), and this must have exerted a great influence over all the neighbouring country. At a later period some part of this country was called the Bayal-n\u00e1d, which was under the government of Kadamba chiefs, until subdued by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, early in the 12th century.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1884. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Description                                      | Acres |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Culturable (dry, 76,367; wet, 3,725; garden, 321) | 80,413|\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | 178,771|\n| In\u00e1m villages                                    | 19,794|\n| Forests (83,254); k\u00e1val (12,228)                  | 95,482|\n\nTotal acres .. 374,460\n\nThe unoccupied area was 9,323 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 90,170, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,11,226.\n\nThe average rainfall at Heggadadevankote for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\u2014\nThe Mysore-Manantody road runs through from north-east to southwest, and is crossed by a road from Hunasur through Heggadadevankote and Sargur to Begur on the Mysore-Ootacamund road.\n\n**Heggadadevankote.**\u2014The chief town of the taluq which bears its name, and a municipality. It is situated in a wild forest tract, 36 miles south-west of Mysore, on the Sargur-Hunasur road. The taluq head-quarters were at one time at Sargur during the monsoon, and for some years permanently. But in 1886 the head-quarters were re-established at Heggadadevankote.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|--------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus              | 587    | 579      | 1,166  |\n| Muhammadans        | 51     | 50       | 101    |\n| Christians          | 13     | 15       | 28     |\n| **Total**           | **651**| **644**  | **1,295** |\n\nThe place can boast of considerable antiquity. Its puranic name was Brihad-bh\u00e1nu-pura, and thither first the P\u00e1ndus and then Janam\u00e9jaya are said to have gone, the latter being represented as the founder of the city. The Hegga\u00f1a D\u00e9va after whom it is now named, appears to have rebuilt the fort and restored in his own person the ancient line of rulers about the tenth century. The district was subsequently subdued by Vijayanagar, and only this town was granted to the chief as an estate, which was held as feudatory to Sri Ranga R\u00e1yal at Seringapatam. It was conquered in 1624 by Chama R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore, whose demands for submission Singappa Wodeyar the chief had contested by representing that he was related to Sri Ranga R\u00e1yal and inherited his authority. An incident connected with its capture, related by Wilks, seems strongly to illustrate the character of the times:\u2014\"The Mysorean army attacked the place during the absence of its chief, Chenna Raj Wodeyar, on a distant expedition, and obtained a great booty. The simplicity of a vak\u00edl, or negotiator, is preserved by tradition, who on the approach of the army came out to treat. 'My master,' (said he) is absent with the troops; the R\u00e1ni (queen) is in labour, and exceedingly alarmed at your approach; we have only fifty soldiers in the place, and the late rains have made two large breaches in the rampart, one on the southern and the other on the eastern face. To come at such a time is very improper and ungenerous.'\" During the time of the Sultan, Heggadadevankote was constantly annoyed by invasions of the Wainad pal\u00e9g\u00e1rs.\nMYSORE DISTRICT\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|\n| Income         | 230   | 205   | 215   | 383   |\n| Expenditure    | 331   | 152   | 195   | 853   |\n\n**Hemavati.**\u2014This river rises in the south-west of the Kadur District, and flows principally through the Hassan District (under which it is more fully described). In the Mysore District it runs from north to south in the west of the Krishnarajpet taluq, and flows into the K\u0101v\u0113ri near Hoskote. There are five dams on it in this District, and as many channels, irrigating 4,264 acres. The Mandigere channel is taken off on the right bank from an anicut near the village of that name in Akkihebbal h\u014dbli, and is now 27 miles long, discharging into the river near the village of Alambadi. It was at first only 15 miles in length; was extended 2 miles further in 1873; 6 miles in 1879; and 4 miles in 1881. The last 12 miles are thus known as the Hosan\u0101la. The Akkihebbal channel, 7 miles long, is on the same side of the river, and is drawn from an anicut in two sections, abutting on the island of Hosapattana, where there is an old deserted fort. The Hemagiri channel, 17 miles long, is taken off from an anicut at the foot of the Hemagiri hill. The land under it is mostly in\u0101m, and many complaints having arisen from ryots cultivating the other lands, regarding the management of the channel, which was in the hands of the inamdars, Mr. Bowring, the Chief Commissioner, persuaded the latter to assign one of their villages, Yachenhalli, for the purpose of the upkeep and improvement of the channel. The revenue derived from the village, about Rs. 1,000, is therefore paid into the treasury, and the channel is looked after by the Irrigation Department, with much benefit to all concerned. The Kalialli channel, 8 miles long, is taken from an anicut near the village of the same name. The land under it is all assigned for the support of the Parak\u0101lasw\u0101mi. The Kannamb\u0101di channel is taken off from the Dan\u0101yakan-katte, near the junction of the Hemavati with the K\u0101v\u0113ri. It is 14 miles long, and flows through the Kannamb\u0101di tank.\n\n**Honnu Hole or Suvarnavati,** both meaning golden stream, the name of a river which rises in the mountains to the south-east of the District, near the Gajalha\u1e6d\u1e6di pass, and flowing north through the Ch\u0101mar\u0101jnagar taluq and Yelandur j\u0101gir, enters the Coimbatore country, whence, passing to the west of Kolleg\u0101la, it falls into the K\u0101v\u0113ri opposite Kakkur near Talk\u0101d. The fertility which it spreads on either bank of the rich tract through which it flows is indicated by its name. It is crossed in Ch\u0101mar\u0101jnagar taluq by two permanent\ndams: the Gajnur, near Attikalpur, giving rise to the Bandigere channel, 9 miles long; and the Hongalvadi, with channel of the same name, 15 miles long, which feeds the large R\u00e1masanudra tanks close to the town of Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1jnagar. By means of temporary dams, constructed when the water is low, of stakes, mats and sand, several smaller channels are fed, namely, the Homma, the A'l\u00farhalla and Hosahalla, the Sargur and Maralhalla. The revenue derived from all the above is upwards of Rs. 38,000. Besides these, the stream is dammed in the Yelandur j\u00e1gir by the Ganganur anicut and feeds six channels, as well as seventeen large and eleven small tanks.\n\n**Hunsur.**\u2014A taluq in the west, till 1882 called Periyapatna, properly Piriyapatna.

The Lakshmantirtha runs through the south and east, a few miles within the limits of the taluq in those directions. It is crossed by several dams, which, with the channels issuing from them, are described in connection with the river. The principal hill is that of Bettadapura, rising to about 1,600 feet above the plain, and to 4,389 feet above sea-level. Thence westwards are some low ranges from which commences the great belt of forest which extends through the south-west of the District.\nThe surface of the country is very undulating, and from this cause not well adapted for irrigation from channels. But the soil being generally of a rich red description, r\u0101gi and other dry crops thrive remarkably well on it. The northern part is the most open, except on the extreme west, where it approaches the confines of Coorg. The centre and east are also open, but in places, especially in the kavals or grazing lands of the Amrit Mahal, scrub jungle is met with, and the n\u0101las generally are covered with trees and bushes of wild date. The west and south are thickly wooded.\n\nThe soils vary from a loose greyish or reddish sandy soil to a firmer red, and to a rich black loam, of great fertility and depth. This prevails mostly in the north. Even the poorest soils, such as those in the Bilikere hobli, though shallow, yield excellent crops owing to a good sub-soil. It is customary to grow two dry crops in the year, especially in the south-west. Tobacco of a superior quality is grown near Bettadapura. Rice cultivation is subject to the malarious fever which prevails in the irrigated lands. Sugar-cane is not now cultivated, though formerly it used to be. The grazing is exceptionally good.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1884. The area of the taluq, exclusive of inams, was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 178,197; wet, 9,386; garden, 3,200) | ... | ... | 190,783 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 140,960 |\n| State forests and 37 kavals | ... | ... | 58,021 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **389,764** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 28,059 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,95,903, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,26,307.\n\nThe average rainfall at Hunsur for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0'03 | 0'51 | 2'28 | 5'88 | 3'02 | 3'25 | 2'89 | 3'81 | 6'07 | 2'18 | 0'65 | ... | 30'57 |\n\nThe trunk road from Seringapatam branches 2 miles west of Hunsur to Mercara, via Piriyapatna and Fraserpet, and to Cannanore via the Periambadi Ghat. From Hunsur there is a road south to Heggadadevankote and Sargur, and one to Hanagod; also one north-east to Yedatore. From Piriyapatna there are roads north to Bettadpur and Ramnathpur, west to Siddapur and Virarajendrapet in Coorg, and south to Ancchaukur on the Cannanore road. There is also an unfinished road from Bettadpur to Fraserpet.\n\n**Hunsur** or **Hunasur**.\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 19' N. lat. 76\u00b0 20' E. long., on the right bank of the Lakshmantirtha, 28 miles west of\nMysore. Since 1865, head-quarters of the Piriyapatna taluq, from 1882 called the Hunsur taluq. It is also a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 1,829 | 1,818   | 3,647 |\n| Muhammadans       | 717   | 708     | 1,425 |\n| Christians         | 39    | 30      | 69    |\n| **Total**          | **2,585** | **2,556** | **5,141** |\n\nThe trunk road from Seringapatam here branches off to Mercara and to Cannanore. The importance of the place is due to its being the head-quarters of the Amrit Mahal cattle-breeding establishment, an account of which will be found elsewhere. Besides this a tannery, a cumbly manufactory and timber yard were, until 1864, maintained by the Madras Commissariat. Boots, knapsacks, and pouches are still manufactured to a large extent by an enterprising native, who, in consideration of his having bought up the Government stock in hand, was permitted to use the tannery and adjoining premises free of rent. Cumblies of a better quality than are to be found elsewhere in the District are also produced, although these latter have been to some extent thrust out of the market by the importation of cheap English blankets. The wool of which they are made is obtained from a strain of the merino sheep, which the Government formerly maintained at Hunsur. On account of the large manufacture of country carts to which the brisk traffic through Hunsur between Mysore, Mercara and Cannanore has given rise, the town has received from the natives the cant name of Ga\u1e0dipalya. Extensive coffee pulping works have been erected, where the berry received from estates in Coorg is prepared for shipment to England.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 2,422  | 4,050  | 3,485  | 3,744  |\n| Expenditure    | 2,807  | 2,915  | 3,379  | 3,363  |\n\nIlavala (Yelwal).\u2014A village 9 miles north-west of Mysore, at the junction of the roads from Mysore and from Seringapatam to Coorg. Head-quarters of the Ilavala h\u00f3bli. Population 1,093.\n\nOn rising ground to the west is the Yelwal Residency, erected in the time of the Hon. Arthur Cole, on designs taken from the Enniskillen seat in Ireland. The extensive stables and out-buildings have lately\nbeen partly dismantled and the materials taken to Mysore to be used for some of the new offices there. The large park had become overgrown with *lantana*, and advantage has been taken of this to sow a great quantity of sandal seed, to the plants from which it acts as a nurse until they are grown up. A mile or two to the south was the old Hinkal race-course, with several bungalows (now in ruins) erected for the occupation of the chief officers and guests at the races. About 3 miles north is Sravana-gutta, with an abandoned Jain statue of Gomata, which resembles the colossal one at Yenur (South Kanara) in being represented with a grave dimpled smile.\n\n**Kabbal-durga.** \u2014A fortified conical hill in Malavalli taluq, rising to 3,507 feet above the sea. Owing to its precipitous sides, it would, if properly victualled and supplied with water, be almost impregnable. It is accessible only on one side, and even there the ascent is very laborious, the steps cut in the solid rock for part of the way not exceeding six inches in width. A p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1r named Gath\u00e9k R\u00e1ja is said to have built the fort. It was used as a penal settlement under the Hindu and Musalm\u00e1n dynasties, and also under Mummadi Krishna R\u00e1ja\u2019s government, and as the bad nature of the water, which appears almost poisonous, renders the hill pestilential, troublesome State prisoners were generally sent there. Colonel Wilks speaks of Kabb\u00e1l-durga as a place of imprisonment, \u201cwhere the dreadful insalubrity of the climate was mercifully aided by unwholesome food to shorten the sufferings of the victims.\u201d It was here that the hereditary r\u00e1ja, Ch\u00e1ma R\u00e1ja, was sent to end his days by the da\u1e37av\u00e1yi Deva R\u00e1j. In 1864 the guns and ammunition were destroyed, and a small establishment of peons which had theretofore been maintained in the fort were removed, so that the stronghold is now uninhabited. Haidar Ali, who repaired the fort, re-named it J\u00e1far\u00e1b\u00e1d, but, as in nearly all cases where Musalm\u00e1n names were substituted for Hindu by Haidar and his son, the former is forgotten and the latter has re-asserted itself.\n\n**Kabbani, Kapini, or Kapila.** \u2014A tributary of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. It rises in the Western Ghats in North Wainad and enters Mysore at its south-western angle in Heggadadevankote taluq. Emerging from the dense jungles of K\u00e1kankote, it flows north-east past Nisana and Maggi, and winds its way to Sargur and Muttkere. Thence, turning eastwards, it receives the waters of the Nugu near Hampapura, and at Nanjang\u00fad those of the Gundal. Passing T\u00e1y\u00far it falls into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri at Tirumak\u00fadlu near Narsipur in Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur taluq, the confluence of the streams being esteemed a spot of pre-eminent sanctity.\n\nIt is a fine perennial river, averaging from 150 to 200 yards in breadth. During the dry season its body of water is not less than that\nof the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. There was formerly only one stretch of wet cultivation irrigated by the Kabbani,\u2014j\u00f3di land, about 9 miles above Nanjang\u00fad, on the left bank. But the recent extension of the Rampur channel for 32 miles has brought 1,367 acres under irrigation. At Nanjang\u00fad the river is spanned by a broad but rudely constructed bridge, built by the da\u1e37av\u00e1yi Deva R\u00e1j about the middle of the 18th century.\n\n**Kadamba.**\u2014See Shimsha.\n\n**Kalale.**\u2014A village in Nanjang\u00fad taluq, 3 miles south-west of Nanjang\u00fad, close to the Mysore-Ootacamund road. Head-quarters of the Kalale h\u00f3bli. Population 2,067.\n\nIt is historically interesting from having been in former times the ancestral domain of the Da\u1e37av\u00e1y\u00eds of Mysore. It is said to have been founded in the year 1504, by a connection of the Vijayanagar family, who with his descendants ruled the neighbouring country till the acquisition of Seringapatam by the R\u00e1jas of Mysore. Shortly after that event the Wodeyars of Mysore and of Kalale appear to have arrived at an agreement to unite their power. Thenceforth the Kalale family supplied the Da\u1e37av\u00e1yi,' an hereditary minister and general of the Mysore State, while the Mysore Wodeyars continued to occupy the throne at Seringapatam, being distinguished by the appellation of Kartar (Curtur in old English documents), which means the ruler. Latterly the Da\u1e37av\u00e1y\u00eds rendered the R\u00e1jas subservient to their interests, but were in their turn displaced by Haidar.\n\n**Karighatta.**\u2014A hill rising to 2,697 feet, in the Seringapatam taluq, east of the point where the L\u00f3kap\u00e1vani joins the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. The annual festival (j\u00e1tre) held for one day in February or March attracts an assemblage of 20,000 people.\n\n**Kaveri (Cauvery).**\u2014The Kabaris of Ptolemy and the Greek geographers, the principal river in the Mysore State. It rises in Coorg, in the Sahy\u00e1dri or Western Ghats, the reputed source being at Tala K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. Flowing eastwards through Coorg as far as Siddapur, it there turns to the north, and touches the Mysore near Fraserpet, from which, as far as Kannagal, it forms for 20 miles the boundary between Mysore and Coorg. Continuing northwards for a few miles through the Arkalgud taluq of the Hassan District, near Konanur it turns to the south-east, which direction it maintains throughout the Mysore District.\n\nRe-entering the latter near the anicut of S\u00e1ligram, it runs through a deep narrow gorge, suffering a fall of 60 to 80 feet in the rapids at Chunchanka\u1e6d\u1e6de. With a short bend to the north from Yedatore to\n\n---\n\n1 Formed from two Kannada words,\u2014da\u1e37a, army, and v\u0101yi (for b\u0101yi), mouth,\u2014the mouthpiece of the army, or the medium of commands to the army.\nmeet the Hem\u00e1vati near Tippur, it resumes its south-east course and receives the Lakshmantirtha near Bhairapura. Lower down, where the stream branches to form the island of Seringapatam, the northern arm is fed by the L\u00f3kap\u00e1vani. The growing river thence flows on to Narsipur, where its waters are replenished by those of the Kabbani. From this point, with a bend eastwards and southwards, it arrives at the ancient city of Talakad, all but buried in hills of sand. Again turning east, it is joined by the Suvarn\u00e1vati or Honnu-hole, and thence forms the boundary between Mysore and Coimbatore for 40 miles. From near Talakad to the island of Sivasamudram it runs northwards.\n\nThe branches of the stream which enclose that island form the picturesque falls of Gagana Chukki on the Mysore side and of Bar Chukki on the Coimbatore side. The re-united stream, with a bed 300 feet lower, passes thence eastwards through a wild gorge, receives the Shimsha and the Arkavati from the north, and narrowing at one place to what is called the m\u00e9ke dh\u00e1\u1e6du, or Goat's Leap, quits the State at the point where the Coimbatore and Salem boundaries meet. In its further course it runs southwards, forming the boundary between those two Districts and receiving the Bhav\u00e1ni and other streams. Thence, entering the Trichinopoly District in an easterly direction, it forms the island of Srirangam, and then spreads in a rich delta of fertility over the Tanjore District. The principal arm, under the name of the Coleroon, flows north-east, separating Trichinopoly and South Arcot from Tanjore, and falls into the Bay of Bengal near Devikotta.\n\nThe average breadth of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in Mysore is from 300 to 400 yards, but from its point of confluence with the Kabbani to the Sivasamudram Falls it swells into a much broader stream. The maximum flood discharge, as gauged roughly at Bannur, is 239,000 cubic feet per second. The ordinary monsoon discharge, calculated at 4 feet in depth, is 18,000 cubic feet per second, but 6, 8 and 10 feet are not uncommon. The bottom of the river is for the most part composed of rocks, generally of granite character, which renders it unfit for navigation. In some places, however, where there is sufficient soil to admit of it, the bed of the river is laid out in vegetable gardens during the dry season when the water is very low. These gardens of melons and cucumbers have an exceedingly pretty effect. The first fresh in the river generally occurs about the middle of June. In August the flow of water begins to decrease, but the river is not generally fordable till the end of October. Its water is in some parts considered unwholesome by the natives, and at Seringapatam they attribute the fever which is there prevalent to its influence, being prejudiced against even bathing in it during certain months.\nDuring the greater part of its course it is bordered on each bank by a rich belt of wet cultivation. There are, however, several breaks occasioned by the inadaptability of the country and deficiency of irrigation. The first of these is from the S\u00e1ligram anicut to Chunchanka\u1e6d\u1e6de, about 5 miles on the right bank, the second from Yedatore to the Tippur anicut, a distance of 4 miles on the right bank, and the third from Narsipur in the Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur taluq to the boundary of the Coimbatore District, about 12 miles, also on the right bank.\n\nThe waters of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri are dammed by no less than twelve anicuts, from each of which one or more channels have been led off for purposes of irrigation. Two of the anicuts are situated in Hassan and will be described with their channels under that District.\n\nThe first dam thrown across the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the Mysore District is the Alale Ka\u1e6d\u1e6de, Yedatore taluq, a long straggling structure of rough stone and of irregular section; length 570 and breadth 4 yards: it supplies the S\u00e1ligram channels on the left bank, which run for a distance of 24 miles, passing the large village of S\u00e1ligram. The revenue realized is Rs. 18,361.\n\nThe next dam in order down the river is the Hanumanta Ka\u1e6d\u1e6de, giving rise to the Mirle channel. It is irregular in section and built of rough stone, with a weir in its northern end. The channel is led off on the left bank and, after running for about a mile, divides into three branches, viz., the Hosa n\u00e1la, 6 miles in length, which receives the drainage of the S\u00e1ligram; the Hiri n\u00e1la, 12 miles; and the Attika\u1e6d\u1e6de, 6 miles. The drainage of these unites in the valley, and is led off by a channel called the Hampapura, which, after a course of 16 miles, ends in the Gullige tank. The revenue derived from these channels is Rs. 20,811. The dam and channels were constructed by Chikka D\u00e9va R\u00e1ja Wodeyar, and improved by Div\u00e1n P\u00farnaiya.\n\nChunchanka\u1e6d\u1e6de dam lies about two hundred yards below the last mentioned. It stretches tortuously across the river, and has a back facing. The dam is built in an advantageous position, a short distance from the head of a narrow gorge, and a few hundred yards above the Chunchan rapids, which are from 60 to 80 feet in height. The R\u00e1masamudram channel led off from this dam has a course of 41 miles, and runs near to the important town of Yedatore. The cultivated area is about 4,300 acres, yielding a revenue of Rs. 25,809. Both dam and channel were constructed by Chikka D\u00e9va R\u00e1ja Wodeyar.\n\nThe fourth anicut on the river is the Adag\u00far Ka\u1e6d\u1e6de, giving rise to the Tipp\u00far channel. It is composed of two separate dams of rough stone\nwhich abut on an island in the middle of the river. The channel has a course of 22 miles, and at its end joins the Anandur by means of an aqueduct thrown across the Lakshmantirtha river near the village of S\u00e1garkatte, Mysore taluq. The greater part of the land below the channel is in\u00e1nti, the revenue derived by Government being Rs. 4,089. Both dam and channel were constructed by G\u00f3vinda N\u00e1yaka, a p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1r chieftain.\n\nClose to the village of S\u00edt\u00e1pur, in the Seringapatam taluq, is the Madad ka\u1e6d\u1e6de dam, a low straggling structure of rough stone, 776 yards in length and averaging 15 yards in breadth. From this dam the Chikkad\u00e9var\u00e1yas\u00e1g\u00e1r is led off, the finest channel in the Mysore country: it runs for 72 miles on the left bank of the river, irrigating an area of 13,737 acres, from which a revenue of Rs. 89,571 is derived. In its course it crosses the Anch\u00e9 Halla and Mosale Halla streams, and a small monsoon river called the L\u00f3kap\u00e1vani near the station of French Rocks. Towards its end it feeds four important tanks, the Hosahalli, Kodagalli, Madagalli and Bannur, the last situated near the town of the same name. The channel passes the villages of Haravu, K\u00e9tanhalli, Nelmane, Pats\u00f3manahalli, Sethalli and Arekere, in its course. Both dam and channel were constructed by Chikka D\u00e9va R\u00e1ja Wodeyar.\n\nA few yards below the Madad ka\u1e6d\u1e6de is the Devar\u00e1ya dam, giving rise to a channel of the same name on the right bank of the river. Its length is 18 miles, and the revenue derived amounts to Rs. 12,787.\n\nNear the temple of Balmuri, a mile from the village of Belgula, is the Balmuri dam, giving rise to the Virj\u00e1nadi channel on the right bank of the river. This channel is the second in importance in Mysore, running for 41 miles through the Seringapatam taluq: it passes the large villages of P\u00e1lhalli, Kalasw\u00e1di, N\u00e1ganhalli, Nugan-halli and Hebb\u00e1di, and ends near the Ankanhalli tank. The revenue derived is Rs. 45,888, and the area irrigated is about 7,330 acres. By means of this channel, the former sugar and iron factories at P\u00e1lhalli used to be worked.\n\nThe eighth channel drawn from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the Mysore District is the Bang\u00e1r Dodd\u00ed. The dam is thrown across the Paschima-v\u00e1hini branch of the river. The channel, after crossing the Paschima-v\u00e1hini island, is led over a second branch of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri into the Seringapatam island by means of an aqueduct; it then divides into three branches, one enters the fort by means of an underground duct, a second terminates at the Darya Daulat garden, and the third, after traversing the island, ends at the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh near the mausoleum of Haidar and Tipu. The revenue derived from irrigated land amounts to Rs. 5,632.\nNext in order down the river is the R\u00e1masw\u00e1mi dam, giving rise to two channels, the R\u00e1masw\u00e1mi on the left bank in the Seringapatam taluq, and the R\u00e1jparam\u00e9svari on the right in the Tirumak\u00fadlu Narsipur taluq. The R\u00e1maswami has a course of 31 miles; for 12 miles it runs through the Bann\u00far hobli, then passing the large town of S\u00f3sile, ends about 8 miles from the town of Talak\u00e1d. The revenue derived is Rs. 16,793, and the irrigated area is 3,104 acres. The R\u00e1jparam\u00e9svari runs for a distance of 21 miles and passes the villages of Rangasamudra, Garg\u00e9svari and Tirumak\u00fadlu, irrigating an area of 1,848 acres, from which a revenue of Rs. 9,771 is derived. The land under the last three miles of the channel is sarvam\u00e1nya. Dam and channels were constructed by Div\u00e1n P\u00farnaiya.\n\nThe last dam on the river in the District is the M\u00e1dhava-mantri, situated near the village of Hemm\u00edge, about two miles above the town of Talak\u00e1d. The main channel formerly ran through the town, but in consequence of the influx of sand during high winds from the celebrated sand hills, the course was altered to a few hundred yards north of the town. After running for about two miles, the channel divides into three branches, whose total length is 18 miles. The revenue derived is Rs. 13,677, the acreage 2,939. The main branch of the channel ends in the J\u00e1g\u00edr of Sivasamudram, a few miles above the celebrated Falls of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri.\u00b9\n\nThe river is spanned by bridges at Fraserpet, Yedatore, Seringapatam and Sivasamudram. Those for the roads at the two latter places are interesting specimens of native construction. Yedatore, Seringapatam and Talak\u00e1d are the principal towns on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. The phenomenon of the sand dunes which have enveloped the latter has been noticed elsewhere.\n\nAlligators are numerous, but they have been seldom known to attack the fishermen, and the natives in general stand in no dread of them. Some of the varieties of fish found in the river are described under that head. Shoals of large fish are daily fed at Ramnathpur and Yedatore by the Brahmins.\n\nIn point of sanctity the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, also called the Dakshina Ganga, is perhaps inferior only to the Ganges: but this sanctity does not extend to the tributaries in the same degree. The reverence with which Hindus regard the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri is exemplified in the nullah which was the work of, and bore the name of, the celebrated Divan P\u00farnaiya. This canal, which was drawn from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri about 30 miles above Seringapatam, was upwards of 70 miles in length and terminated at Mysore. It was carried over the Lakshmantirtha river by means of\n\n\u00b9 See Sivasamudram.\nan aqueduct, so that although the nullah was partially available for irrigation, it is clear that not the least of Purnaiya's object was to bring sacred water into the city of Mysore. Immense labour was expended on excavation, and in many places cuttings upwards of 100 feet deep were made through solid granite. But this ambitious work was, after all, ineffectual for the accomplishment of the end proposed, for the difference of levels made it impossible that in the absence of mechanical aids the Kaveri waters themselves could ever reach Mysore. The nullah, which in the crowded parts of the city had become little better than a deep and noisome sewer, has now been filled up within municipal limits, and sites have thus been provided for handsome streets and buildings. At the same time the coveted conveyance to the city of the sacred waters of the holy river has, with the help of modern science, been successfully effected by the erection near Anandur of turbines, by means of which the river water is forced up to a special reservoir at Mysore. The scheme was completed and the water made use of for the first time on the occasion of the installation of the present young Maharaja.\n\nThe supposed divine origin of the river is related in the Kaveri Mahatmya of the Agneya and Skanda puranas. She was first Vishnumay\u00e1, a daughter of Brahma. By his direction she became incarnate in Lopamudr\u00e1, a girl formed by Agastya (with the view of her becoming his wife) of the most graceful parts of the animals of the forest, whose distinctive beauties (mudr\u00e1), as the eyes of the deer, &c., were subjected to loss (lopa) in her superior charms. Brahma gave Lopamudr\u00e1 as a daughter to Kaver\u00e1 muni, whence she acquired the name Kaveri. In order to secure beatitude for her new father, she resolved to become a river, the merit of whose waters in absolving from all sin and blessing the earth should accrue to him. But when she became of age, Agastya proposed to marry her. To reconcile the conflicting claims, Lopamudr\u00e1 or the mortal part of her nature became the wife of Agastya, while Kaveri or the celestial part flowed forth as the river.\n\nKittur.\u2014A large village on the right bank of the Kabbani, in Heggadadevankote taluq, south of the kasba. Population 1,443.\n\nIt is historically interesting as being identified with the Kitthipura or Kirthipura which was the capital of the Punnad R\u00e1jas (see above, p. 220, and Vol. I, p. 312). An inscription of the 11th century describes it as \"the royal residence, the immense great city Kirthipura.\"\n\nKrishnarajpet.\u2014A taluq in the north-west, till 1891 called Attikuppa, and till 1882 forming part of the Hassan District. Area 424 square miles. Head-quarters at Krishnarajpet. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\n### KRISHNARAJPET\n\n| No. | Hoblis. | Villages. | Hamlets. | Government. | Servamanya. | Jodi. | Kayamgutta. | Population. |\n|-----|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1   | Akkihebb\u00e1l... | ...60     | 14       | 43          | 16          | 1    | \u2014           | 15,434      |\n| 2   | Chinkuruli... | ...62     | 37       | 52          | 8           | 1    | 1           | 16,065      |\n| 3   | Kannamb\u00e1di... | ...50     | 19       | 41          | 9           | \u2014    | \u2014           | 15,999      |\n| 4   | Kikk\u00e9ri...    | ...60     | 20       | 59          | \u2014           | \u2014    | 1           | 13,064      |\n| 5   | Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t | ...67     | 21       | 66          | \u2014           | 1    | \u2014           | 16,350      |\n| 6   | Santeb\u00e1chihalli | ...63    | 12       | 59          | 1           | 2    | 1           | 14,541      |\n| Total | ...     | 362       | 123      | 320         | 34          | 5    | 3           | 91,453      |\n\n**Principal places, with population.**\u2014Sindaghatta 1,874; Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t 1,662; Gummanhalli 1,629; Kannamb\u00e1di 1,621; Hosaholalu 1,597; Kikk\u00e9ri 1,574; B\u00fakinkere 1,320; Ma\u1e0davank\u00f3di 1,130; Akkihebb\u00e1l 1,020.\n\nA number of villages from Chanraypatna and Hole Narsipur taluqs were added to the Kikkeri hobli in 1882, while the Melukote hobli was transferred to Seringapatam taluq, and some villages of Santeb\u00e1chihalli to Nagamangala.\n\nThe drainage of the taluq is from north to south in a westerly direction, most of the streams discharging into the Hemavati, which runs along near the western border and joins the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the south, on which side this latter river forms the boundary. On the eastern border are several rocky hills. There are some 284 tanks, at least 10 of which are of the first class. But the chief means of irrigation are the channels drawn from the Hemavati, of which there are five\u2014the Mandigere, 27 miles long, irrigating 2,720 acres; the Akkihebb\u00e1l, 7 miles long, irrigating 2,724 acres; the Hemagiri, 17 miles long, irrigating 1,460 acres, nearly all in\u00e1m land; the Kannamb\u00e1di, 14 miles long, irrigating 1,245 acres; the Kalhalli, 8 miles long, irrigating 328 acres.\n\nThe dry crop soils vary considerably, from good red in the low grounds to grey and sandy in the uplands, especially in Santeb\u00e1chihalli and Chinkuruli hoblis. Black soil is rare and in small patches. The crops taken from the red and sandy soils are better than might be expected. The rice lands under tanks are fairly good, and in the east a coarse kind of rice, *doddi* or *karibhatta*, is raised without artificial irrigation. The gardens, especially those for cocoa-nuts, betel-leaf and plantains, are productive. But land under the river channels, though somewhat inferior in quality, is more sought after, on account of the perennial water supply. The irrigated tracts are also free from the fever\nwhich prevails in such lands in the taluqs to the west. The cultivation of sugar-cane is general, especially marakabbu.\n\nSilk cloths of various kinds are manufactured at Sindaghatta. The raw silk brought from neighbouring taluqs is here spun into thread, dyed and woven.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1886. The area of the taluq was thus distributed, excluding minor in\u00e1ms:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 108,453; wet, 9,114; garden, 3,326) | ... | ... | 120,893 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 89,543 |\n| In\u00e1m villages (33,306); 11 Amrit Mahal k\u00e1v\u00e1ls (10,890) | ... | ... | 44,196 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **254,632** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 11,971 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,97,914, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,13,489.\n\nThe average rainfall at Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t for 26 years (1870\u201395), and at the other station for three years (1893\u20135), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t | 0\u00b009 | 0\u00b001 | 0\u00b040 | 2\u00b015 | 5\u00b065 | 1\u00b086 | 2\u00b005 | 2\u00b055 | 3\u00b044 | 6\u00b010 | 3\u00b011 | 0\u00b038 | ... | 27\u00b079 |\n| Chinkuruli | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 27\u00b070 |\n\nThe main road from Seringapatam to Chanraypatna runs through the taluq from south-east to north-west, passing by Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t; from which there are roads north-east to Nagamangala and east to Melukote. There is also an unfinished road west to Akkilhebb\u00e1l and Bherya. A road from French Rocks runs to Kannamb\u00e1\u1e0di and continues westward as a cart track.\n\nKrishnaraipet.\u2014A small town situated in 12\u00b0 41' N. lat., 76\u00b0 33' E. long., 23 miles from the railway at French Rocks station, and 35 miles north-east of Mysore, on the Seringapatam-Chanraypatna road. Till 1891 it was called Attikuppa. Head-quarters of the Krishnar\u00e1jp\u00e9t taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus             | ...    | ...      | 756    |\n| Muhammadans       | ...    | ...      | 785    |\n| Christians         | ...    | ...      | 2      |\n| **Total**         | ...    | ...      | 826    |\n|                   |        |          | 836    |\n|                   |        |          | **1,662** |\n\nThe place derives all its importance from being the head-quarters of the taluq.\nLakshmantirtha.\u2014A tributary of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. It rises in the Western Ghats, in the Brahmagiri which forms the southern frontier of Coorg. Its whole course is north-east. Entering Mysore two miles south of the village of Chikka Hejjur in Hunsur taluq, it flows past Hanagod, Hunsur and Katte Ma\u0142alv\u00e1di into the Yedatore taluq, where it falls into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri near the village of S\u00e1garkatte. It is a perennial stream, and though a smaller river than the Kabbani, is considerably more utilized for irrigation. The following lands are irrigated from it. The right bank from Hanagod to Katte Ma\u0142alv\u00e1di; the left bank from Katte Ma\u0142alv\u00e1di to the Seriy\u00far anicut; both banks from the Seriy\u00far anicut to Marchahalli: the left bank from Marchahalli to S\u00e1garkatte; the right bank from S\u00e1garkatte to the confluence with the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. It is crossed by seven dams.\n\nThe first dam thrown across the river is the Hanag\u00f3d, below the village of the same name. It is built in the ordinary manner, of rough rubble stone, its strength being greatly augmented by the rocky formation of the river bed. The channel, which bears the same name, is led off on the right bank of the river, and after running for nine miles, divides into three branches, viz., the Nellur 7, Hanumantapur 24, and Wudur 20 miles in length. The Nellur follows the course of the river, and ends in the Elephant tank near Hunasur. The Wudur and Hanumantapur, however, passing through a deep cutting, enter the watershed of the Kabbani river, the Wudur running in an easterly, the Hanumantapur in a southerly direction. Six tanks are fed by the Hanumantapur in its course, viz., the Puduk\u00f3te, Nanjanhalli, S\u00f3w\u00e9, Harrupur, Belliganhalli, and Gudamanahalli. The total revenue derived from the Hanag\u00f3d and branches, altogether 66 miles in length, irrigating 4,101 acres, is Rs. 18,245. The dense jungles which surround the channels interfere with extensive cultivation. The drainage from the Wudur and Hanumantapur channels is taken up by the D\u00e1sanp\u00far and M\u00e1ik\u00e1lwe; the latter feeds the Karigal, Holl\u00e9hundi and Parvatam tanks on the banks of the Kabbani.\n\nThe R\u00e1menhalli, an old breached dam, is the next, about three miles up the river from Hunsur; the channel was led off on the right bank, and ran for 20 miles, passing through the town of Hunsur.\n\nThe Katte Ma\u0142alv\u00e1di, situated near the village of the same name, about 4 miles below Hunasur, is the third dam on the river. The\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          |        | 419    | 459    | 676    | 747    |\n| Expenditure     |        | 938    | 694    | 709    | 1,080  |\nchannel has a course of 11 miles along the left bank. The irrigated area is 509 acres, while the revenue derived is Rs. 2,520.\n\nNear the village of Hundw\u00e1di is the H\u00e1ngrahalli dam, giving rise to two channels, the Siriy\u00far and Husenpura. The former, on the left bank, runs for 11 miles, and yields a revenue of Rs. 1,753; the latter, on the right bank, has also a course of 11 miles, with a revenue of Rs. 3,246.\n\nThe fifth dam is the Marchahalli, giving rise to a small channel of the same name. The dam breached in 1864 and a new dam was constructed at a short distance above the site of the old one. The channel which runs along the left bank is 10 miles long and yields a revenue of Rs. 2,392.\n\nThe S\u00e1garkatte dam, built by Divan Purnaiya near the village of the same name, gives rise to the Anand\u00far channel on the right bank. This channel was originally carried as far as Mysore, it having been the constructor's intention to supply the town with the river water; the design however failed, and the channel is in order for only 20 miles. The revenue derived is Rs. 7,278, on an irrigated area of 1,317 acres.\n\nThe Cholanhal\u00ed is the last dam on the river, about half a mile above its confluence with the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri; the dam breached in 1864, but the irrigation under the channel is kept up by the drainage of the Anand\u00far, under which channel it runs for its whole length.\n\n**Lokapavani** (world-purifier).\u2014A small stream running to the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. It rises to the west of N\u00e1gamangala, and flowing with an easterly course past the French Rocks, receives the stream from the Moti T\u00e1l\u00e1b, and enters the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri opposite the Karighatta peak, off the north eastern point of the island of Seringapatam.\n\n**Maddur.**\u2014A town on the right bank of the Shimsha, 36 miles northeast of Mysore, on the Bangalore-Mysore railway and the Bangalore-Seringapatam road. It is a municipality, and till 1875 was the headquarters of the separate Maddur taluq. This was for a time formed into a sub-taluq under M\u00e1ndya taluq, but in 1886 was absorbed in that taluq.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus...          | 769   | 846     | 1,615 |\n| Muhammadans       | 314   | 288     | 602   |\n| **Total**         | **1,083** | **1,134** | **2,217** |\n\nMaddur, properly Marud\u00far, appears to have been formerly a place of importance, but has never recovered from the destruction to which it became subject during the war of Tipu with the English, and is\nunhealthy. There are two large Vishnuvite temples, dedicated to Narasimha and Varada R\u00e1ja, which draw a nominal allowance from Government. A fine brick bridge of seven arches, constructed in 1859, spans the Shimsha, and has now been used for the railway as well as the road. Tradition claims for Maddur a great antiquity. It is stated to have been originally named Arjunapura, by Arjuna the Pandu prince, who arrived there on pilgrimage. The Shimsha also bears the name of the Kadamba, from a rishi who resided on its banks. Under the Gangas it formed part of the province of Chikka Gangavadi, and in later times Vishnuvardhana of the Hoysala line is stated to have given Maddur in n\u00e1m to the Srivaishnava Brahmans. He is also stated to have built the Maddur tank and the temple of Varada R\u00e1ja. The agrahara was called Narasimha-chaturvedimangalam, after his son. The fort was taken in 1617 by the Dalav\u00e1yi of Mysore, during the reign of R\u00e1ja Wodeyar, and was rebuilt by Haidar Ali. It was dismantled by Lord Cornwallis in 1791 on his march to Seringapatam.\n\nAbout three miles west of Maddur are the remains of an old fort named Nagarakere, which was inhabited 600 years ago by a p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1r named Magurta R\u00e1ya. According to the popular legend, he was the son-in-law of Ganga R\u00e1ja of Sivasamudram, and his wife was perpetually boasting of her father's splendour, declaring among other vaunts that she could hear her father's fort-gate, which was made of bell-metal, shut every evening at sunset. Incensed at this, her husband determined to prove his power superior to that of Ganga R\u00e1ja, and marched an army against Sivasamudram, which he took and destroyed.\n\nFour miles from the town is an unfinished tank, known as the S\u00fal\u00e9kere. It was commenced about 700 years ago by a woman of the dancing-girl caste, who died before it could be finished. It is estimated that its completion would cost a lakh and a half of rupees, and would bring more than a thousand kandis of wet land under cultivation.\n\nThere are cross roads from Maddur to Malavalli and the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri Falls southwards, and to Huliyurdurga northwards.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 358    | 260    | 804    | 800    |\n| Expenditure    | 1,004  | 461    | 622    | 1,108  |\n\nMalavalli.\u2014A taluq in the east.

At about the middle of the southern boundary the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri divides into two branches, forming the island of Sivasamudra, and precipitating itself into deep ravines in the picturesque K\u00e1v\u00e9ri Falls. The course of the Shimsha is at first east, but from the village of Sargur, where it is joined by the Kanva from the north, it runs south into the parent stream. Neither of these rivers is at present a source of irrigation, some channels which were formerly drawn from the Kanva having fallen out of repair. The latter part of the Ramaswami channel, drawn from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri near Bannur, irrigates lands in Purigal hobli, but they chiefly belong to the J\u00e1gird\u00e1r of Sivasamudra. All the remaining irrigated land is below the few tanks. The two largest, the Malavalli and Maranhalli tanks, are in the immediate neighbourhood of Malavalli, and their water, uniting into one channel, irrigates land to a distance of 9 miles. A large tank has also been recently formed by a dam across the Heb-halla, a tributary of the Shimsha, at Arasinkere.\n\nThe taluq generally is an undulating plain, except on the south-east, which is occupied by the Basavana betta State forest, and by hills of inconsiderable height: of these the principal are Kabb\u00e1l\u00eddurga (3,507 feet), Basavana betta, Bemmanakandi betta, Tayalur betta, Singrajpur betta and Achala betta.\n\nThe soil in the south-eastern quarter of the taluq is mostly rocky and shallow: also in parts of the north-west. In the remaining parts it is generally red, with more or less admixture of sand. Towards the south-west the soil increases in depth, colour and fertility, until the\nrich soils, including patches of black soil, on the border of the Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur taluq are met with. The crops vary with the soils, jola, cotton and Bengal gram being grown to some extent in the better soils, while only r\u00e1gi, save, avare, togari and other pulses are grown in the poorer soils. The wet lands may be described as generally inferior, and there is an almost entire absence of sugar-cane cultivation. Mulberry is the chief crop in gardens, and it is grown even in dry lands, but in the latter case is poor. Areca, cocoa-nut and plaintains are sparsely represented. Silk and hides are the principal articles exported from the taluq. Halag\u00far was once the seat of a considerable iron industry, but owing partly to lack of fuel and charcoal, and partly to the competition of foreign iron, smelting has been almost abandoned. A project formed by Dr. Dhanakoti R\u00e1ju for reviving this industry, though not carried out, has been described in Vol. I, p. 534.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1893. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 114,920; wet, 3,525; garden, 2,697) | ... | ... | 120,942 |\n| Unculturable (including village sites, roads, &c.) | ... | ... | 64,947 |\n| State forests and k\u00e1valas (24,661); in\u00e1m villages (38,780) | ... | ... | 63,441 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **249,330** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 4,479 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 85,640, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 94,981.\n\nThe average rainfall at Malavalli for 26 years (1870\u201395) was:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| 0\u00b016 | 0\u00b013 | 0\u00b066 | 1\u00b045  | 4\u00b019| 1\u00b008 | 1\u00b044 | 3\u00b095 | 4\u00b069 | 5\u00b067 | 2\u00b064 | 0\u00b027 | 26\u00b033 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Mysore road via Kankanhalli runs through Halag\u00far and Malavalli, and is crossed at Malavalli by the road from Maddur to Sivasamudram. There is also a road from Sosile through Belakavadi to Sivasamudram, with a branch from near Purig\u00e1l to Talak\u00e1d.\n\n**Malavalli.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 23' N. lat., 77\u00b0 7' E. long., 28 miles east of Mysore, at the intersection of the Mysore-Kankanhalli and Maddur-Sivasamudram roads, 18 miles south of the railway at Maddur.

It formerly possessed a large fort, built of mud and stone, which is now ruinous. Haidar gave Malavalli in j\u00e1gir to his son Tipu, so that it then enjoyed considerable prosperity, although it does not appear that the population was greater than it is now. Below the Malavalli tank is the site of a fruit garden which Tipu planted, now occupied by paddy-fields. About two miles from the town, and close to the new Mysore road, is the scene of the only engagement which took place between the British army under General Harris and Tipu Sultan, during the march of the former on Seringapatam in 1799. Bullets, &c., are frequently found in the neighbourhood after rain.

It gives rise to the Maddur Ane channel, running altogether for a distance of 12 miles to the Maddur tank, and irrigating 1,090 acres. This also branches into the following channels:\u2014Chamanhalli, 2\u00bd miles; Bairan, 2 miles; Vaidyanathapur, 3\u00bc miles; and Kemman, 5\u00bd miles: altogether irrigating 1,910 acres. The remains are visible of another from the Chikka Hol\u00e9 to the Kestur tank, but this has been out of repair and not used for about 80 years. The western portion of the taluq is occupied by chains of rain-fed tanks, the drainage being south-easterly, towards the Shimsha. There are altogether over 200 tanks used for irrigation, of which Maddur tank is the largest, and 29 others are large. The wells are of no importance.\n\nThe country is gently undulating, and is only moderately wooded with banyan, ippe and other trees, there being no jungle, and only some small scrub on the eastern and north-western boundaries.\n\nThe soils for dry crops are as a whole poor, being sandy and gravelly, shallow and in some places very stony, especially in the uplands in the north. Black soil is rare. Good red soil occurs in the centre, and east of the Shimsha in the south. The soils in the wet lands are pretty uniform and of fair quality, except in those reclaimed under the new Maddur channel, and even here they are gradually improving from being brought under cultivation.\n\nThe usual dry crops are grown. The principal wet crop is rice. There is not much sugar-cane, but there is a good deal of mulberry in the east. The areca gardens were ruined in the famine. The gardens that now remain are not very good and contain chiefly cocoa-nut, plantains and mulberry, with minor crops of chillies, vegetables, &c. The honge trees are not here utilized for supplying manure to rice-fields as in Districts to the east. But hucheh-ellu or other inferior crop is grown in rice-lands after the harvest and is then ploughed in. Silt from tanks is largely used for manure both in wet and dry soils.\n\nSheep are numerous. A superior kind of kambli is made at Mandya, Satanur, Mudagere and other places. Silkworms are largely kept by both Musalmans and Hindus, who send the cocoons principally to Channapatna, where the silk is reeled.\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1883, except in Koppa hobli, which was settled with Kunigal taluq in 1881. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 125,517; wet, 9,206; garden, 2,982) ... ... 137,765\n- Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) ... ... 94,262\n- In\u00e1m villages ... ... ... ... ... ... 23,753\n\nTotal acres ... 255,780\n\nThe unoccupied area was 11,785 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,96,560, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,20,606.\n\nThe average rainfall at Mandya for 26 years (1870-95) and at the other stations for three years (1893-5) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Mandya | 0'21 | 0'06 | 0'46 | 1'42 | 4'81 | 1'55 | 1'66 | 3'91 | 5'12 | 7'05 | 2'92 | 0'77...29'94 |\n| Koppa | \u2014    | \u2014    | 1'85 | 1'56 | 5'47 | 2'38 | 4'87 | 0'80 | 4'44 | 9'74 | 2'23 | \u2014...33'34 |\n| Lingarajchatra | \u2014 | 0'16 | 0'46 | 1'55 | 2'46 | 2'47 | 1'78 | 1'73 | 2'69 | 9'06 | 1'90 | 0'01...24'27 |\n| Maddur | \u2014 | 0'31 | 1'28 | 2'75 | 4'21 | 2'61 | 3'78 | 4'27 | 5'78 | 10'31 | 2'70 | \u2014...38'00 |\n\nThese results are somewhat questionable, as other observations for the same periods make the annual rainfall at Mandya 25'71 and at Maddur 31'22.\n\nThe Bangalore-Mysore railway runs through the south of the taluq from east to west, with stations at Maddur, Mandya and Yeliyur. The Bangalore-Seringapatam trunk road is close alongside the railway. From Mandya there are roads north to Basar\u00e1l and south to Bannur. From Maddur there are roads north to Huliyurdurga and south to Malavalli, Sivasamudram and the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri Falls. There is also a road from Lingarajchatra to French Rocks.\n\n**Mandya.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 32' N. lat., 76\u00b0 57' E. long., 25 miles north-east of Mysore, on the Bangalore-Mysore railway and the Bangalore-Seringapatam road.

In the Krita yuga, when the country was covered\nwith thick jungle, a rishi who made tapas here, was in the habit of teaching the wild beasts to pronounce the sacred word V\u00e9da. On this account he named the place V\u00e9d\u00e1ranya, and established therein the god Jan\u00e1rdana or Varadar\u00e1j\u00e1sw\u00e1mi, whose temple is still standing. During the same age another rishi set up the god Sakal\u00e9svarasw\u00e1mi there. Vishnu appeared to him, and hence the place was re-named Vishnupura. Towards the end of the Dw\u00e1para yuga, a king, by name Indra-varma, who was without issue, removed here in the hope of obtaining a son. His prayers were answered, and his son, whose name was S\u00f3ma-varma, built a fort and agrah\u00e1ra, and nominated the site Mand\u00e9v\u00e9mu, which has since been corrupted into Mandya.\n\nBut Mandya appears to be named after the native place, near Tirupati, of the first Brahman families who settled there; the village having been granted by Krishna R\u00e1ja of Vijayanagar, in 1516, to Govinda R\u00e1ja, twelfth in descent from Anant\u00e1ch\u00e1ya, a disciple of the reformer R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, and a distinguished devotee of the idol Venkatesa at Tirupati. Mandya continued to remain a sarvam\u00e1nyam village for Sri Vaishnava Brahmans until the time of Tipu Sultan, who withdrew the allowance. He also removed the taluq cutcherry from Mandya to Keragod, but Purnaiya retransferred it to Mandya.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 604     | 512     | 1,110   | 1,166   |\n| Expenditure      | 482     | 62      | 610     | 813     |\n\n**Manipura.**\u2014An ancient city of which the ruins are pointed out three miles south-east of Chamarajnagar.

When the Vaishnava reformer R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1rya fled from the persecution of the Chola king, early in the 12th century, he took up his residence at M\u00e9luk\u00f3\u1e6de and lived there for 14 years. It thus became the chief seat of the Sri Vaishnava sect of Brahmans, who reaped the benefit of the conversion by their apostle of the Hoysala king Bitti Deva, thenceforward called Vishnuvardhana, in obtaining assignments of all the most fertile tracts of land in the neighbourhood, especially of the ash\u1e6da gr\u00e1ma (see above, p. 235) on either bank of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri.\n\nThe place suffered at the hands of the Muhammadans who wrecked Dorasamudra in the 14th century, as it was to Tondanur, now Tonnur, at the southern foot of the hill, that the Hoysala king at first retired. It was subsequently restored, in about 1460, by Timmanna Dann\u00e1yaka, lord of N\u00e1gamangala, who was the minister of the Vijayanagar king Mallikarjuna or Immadi Praudha Deva R\u00e1ya. The buildings must have been on a grand scale, as the remains of the Gopal R\u00e1ya gate on the south are of immense proportions. The former approaches are flagged with stones for a considerable distance. There is now a good road.\n\nIn 1771, the Mahrattas having encamped to the south of the hill after their victory over Haidar Ali at Chinkuruli, the Brahmans deserted M\u00e9luk\u00f3\u1e6de, which was as usual plundered. For the sake of iron, the immense wooden cars belonging to the temples were set on fire, and the flames spreading to the religious buildings, some of them were entirely consumed. The principal temple is a square building, of great dimensions, but very plain, dedicated to Krishna under the name of Cheluva-pulle R\u00e1ya.\u00b9 The original name of the idol appears to\n\n\u00b9 Although the image represents Krishna, it is commonly called Chilla pulla R\u00e1ya, or the darling prince; for Chillapulla is a term of endearment which mothers give to their infants, somewhat like our word darling. The reason of such an uncommon appellation being given to a mighty warrior is said to be as follows:\u2014On Ramanyja's going to Melukote, to perform his devotions at that celebrated shrine, he was informed that the place had been attacked by the Turc king of Delhi, who had carried away the idol. The Brahman immediately set out for that capital; and on his arrival he found that the king had made a present of the image to his daughter; for it is said to be very handsome, and she asked for it as a plaything. All day the princess played with the image; at night the god assumed his own beautiful form, and enjoyed her bed; for Krishna is addicted to such kinds of adventures. This had continued for some time when Ramanyja arrived, and called on the image, repeating at the same time some powerful mantras; on which the idol immediately placed itself on the Brahman's knee. Having clasped it in his arms he called it his Chillapulla, and they were both instantaneously conveyed to Melukote. The princess, quite disconsolate for the loss of her image, mounted a horse and followed as fast as she was able. She was no sooner near the idol than she disappeared, and is supposed to have been taken into its immediate substance; which in this country is a common\nhave been R\u00e1ma-priya. A more striking edifice is the temple of Narasimha, placed on the very summit of the rock. The large temple is richly endowed, having been under the special patronage of the Mysore R\u00e1jas, and has a most valuable collection of jewels. As early as 1614 we find R\u00e1ja Wodeyar, who first acquired Seringapatam and adopted the Vaishnava faith, making over to the temple and Brahmans at M\u00e9luk\u00f3te the estate granted him by the Vijayanagar king Venkata-pati R\u00e1ya. There is also an inscription of 1785, showing that even Tipu Sultan granted some elephants for the temple. The Vairamud\u00ed festival, which is the chief annual celebration, is attended by 10,000 people. The guru of the S\u2019ri Vaishnava Brahmans, styled the Parak\u00e1lasw\u00e1mi, lives at M\u00e9luk\u00f3te and Mysore. The site of a ruined palace of the Mysore R\u00e1jas, adjoining the great temple, has now been laid out as a public garden.\n\nThe inhabitants are nearly all Brahmans, 400 of whom are attached to the great temple and receive thence a daily allowance, some of them being men of learning. There is also a class of temple servants of Sudra extraction, consisting of musicians, dancing-girls, and Vaishnava or S\u00e1t\u00e1nanas. The only persons in the place who live by industry are a few families of weavers and some shopkeepers. Two classes of Holeyas or outcastes, called the Tirukula and J\u00e1mbavakula, are credited with having assisted R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja in recovering the image of Krishna when it was carried off to Delhi, as related in the note at foot. Hence they have the privilege of entering the temple once a year to pay their devotions. The houses are roofed with tiles, and have an odd look from being covered with thorns. This is to keep off the monkeys, which are very numerous, and which, bearing a sacred character, it would be a grievous sin to destroy.\n\nCloths of good quality are made here, and ornamental punkahs or fans of the fragrant roots of the kuskus grass. There are many different kinds of rock on the hill. A strata of schistose mica which has decayed into a fine white clay is considered sacred. It is said to have been discovered by Emberum\u00e1n\u00e1r or R\u00e1m\u00e1nuja and is used by the S\u2019ri Vaishnava Brahmans for making the n\u00e1ma or sectarian marks on their foreheads. It is in such demand for this purpose, on account of its purity, that it is transported to distant places, even as far as way of the gods disposing of their favourites. A monument was built for the princess, but as she was a Ture, it would have been improper to place this building within the walls of the holy place; it has therefore been erected at the foot of the hill, under the most abrupt part of the rock.\u2014Buchanan, Journ., I, 342.\n\n1 Said to be a corruption of the words Vajra mukuti, diamond crown. Stolen from Vishnu by a serpent who carried it to P\u00e1t\u00e1la, it was recovered by Garuda, and presented to Krishna.\nBenares. It is fabled to have been brought to M\u00e9luk\u00f3te by Garutman, the bird of Vishnu, from Sveta-dvipa (the white island) in the Kshirasamudra (the milk ocean).\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 1,007  | 1,058  | 1,737  | 1,749  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 902    | 613    | 1,440  | 2,336  |\n\nMoti Talab, or lake of pearls, a large tank at Tonnur in Seringapatam taluq. It is formed by an embankment carried across a gap between two rocky hills, which stems the water of the Y\u00e1dava nadi and other mountain torrents that there unite their streams. The mound, whose dimensions are given as 78 cubits high, 150 long, and 250 thick at the base, is said to have been constructed by R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, the S\u2019ri Vaishnava Brahman reformer, who had taken up his abode at the neighbouring town of M\u00e9luk\u00f3te. He named the tank Tirumalas\u00e1gara. The superfluous water is let off through a channel which has been cut with great labour through one of the hills, at such a height as to enable it to water a great portion of the subjacent plain, which is three or four miles in extent. When the tank is full it contains a sufficient quantity of water to supply the cultivators for two years; but owing to failure of rain the water frequently continues lower than the opening of the outlet. Although the torrents bring down much sand, it so happens that the tank is never affected by that circumstance; for the two streams enter in such directions as to force all the sand towards the extreme corners, without diminishing the main depth. Nasir Jung, son of the Subadar of the Deccan, who visited it in 1746, gave it the name of Moti Talab or lake of pearls, an appellation to which its clear and beautiful water perhaps entitles it. The bank was breached and the water drained off by Tipu Sultan in 1798, to prevent its being used by an enemy besieging Seringapatam.\n\nMoyar.\u2014A river which forms the southern boundary of the Mysore State. It rises in the M\u00fakarti hill in the Nilagiris and flows north-east, having there the name of Paikar\u00e9. On reaching the edge of the plateau, it turns west and falls in a succession of cascades, known as the Paikara Falls (the upper 180 feet, and the lower 200 feet), to the tableland below. It then, for the rest of its course, flows east, running at the bottom of the singular gorge called the Mysore ditch, from its presenting the aspect of a long deep moat as seen from the crest of the ghats. Finally, after separating the Nilagiris from the Eastern Ghats at the Gajalhatti pass, it joins the Bhav\u00e1ni in the Coimbatore District, at Devan\u00e1yakankota, below the Rangaswami peak.\n**Muduk-dore.**\u2014A sacred hill near Talakad on the banks of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, where the river takes a sudden turn to the south. On the hill is a temple dedicated to Mallikarjuna, whose j\u00e1tre, held for fifteen days in January or February, is attended by 10,000 people.\n\n**Mugur.**\u2014A large village in Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur taluq, situated 6 miles south by east of Narsipur.

It lies between the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri on the north and east, and the Kabbani on the south, though these rivers are beyond the boundaries and actually touch the taluq for a very short distance. The drainage is principally from north to south, to the Kabbani. The nature of the country is undulating. There are few hills, the only one of importance being the Ch\u00e1mundi hill, overlooking the city of Mysore from the south-east, and rising to about 1,000 feet above it. In the south-west there is a little scrub jungle, and wild date trees abound in all n\u00e1las and low-lying places.\n\nA comparatively small extent of land is benefited by the river\nchannels drawn from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri and the Lakshmantirtha. The Viraj\u00e1nadi and Devar\u00e1ya channels irrigate a few villages to the east, and the Anandur channel a few in the north-west. There are 361 tanks, of which five are of the first class. The soil in wet lands is generally of superior quality, except under some of the channels. The soil in dry lands is mostly shallow and stony, with a large admixture of sand. But they vary much both in quality and depth. The prevailing colour is red. The dry crops are those usually grown in Mysore, there being two distinct seasons for sowing\u2014the k\u00e1ru and the hainu. Rice and sugar-cane are grown under the channels, and the former under some tanks. Cocoa-nut, areca-nut, betel vines and plantains are largely grown, with vegetables and minor garden produce, around Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1887. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 100,062; wet, 3,642; gardens, 4,191) | ... | ... | 107,895 |\n| Unculturable (including village sites, roads, &c.) | ... | ... | 58,309 |\n| In\u00e1m villages (28,958); 1 Amrit Mah\u00e1l k\u00e1val (759) | ... | ... | 29,617 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **195,921** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 11,514 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,62,786, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,55,101.\n\nThe average rainfall at Mysore for 26 years (1870\u201395) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Taluq Cutcherry | 0\u00b010 | 0\u00b011 | 0\u00b058 | 1\u00b097 | 4\u00b090 | 2\u00b017 | 2\u00b021 | 3\u00b000 | 3\u00b022 | 6\u00b074 | 1\u00b054 | 0\u00b036...26\u00b090 |\n| Jail Hospital | ... | 0\u00b010 | 0\u00b007 | 0\u00b063 | 2\u00b014 | 5\u00b065 | 2\u00b025 | 2\u00b027 | 3\u00b011 | 3\u00b081 | 7\u00b058 | 2\u00b028 | 0\u00b060...30\u00b049 |\n\nThe Mysore State railway passes through the taluq from north to south, with stations at Mysore and Kadakola. The Bangalore-Ootacamand road passes through Mysore, whence there are also roads to Bannur north-east, to Malavalli east, to Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur south-east, to the Wainad south-west, and via Yelwal on the north-west to Coorg and to Hassan.\n\n**Mysore.**\u2014The capital of the Province and residence of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja: situated in 12\u00b0 18' north latitude and 76\u00b0 42' east longitude, at the north-western base of the Ch\u00e1mundi hill.\n\nIt contains four suburbs and covers an area of 7\u00bd square miles. The population numbers 74,048, of whom 36,691 are males and 37,357 females. The number of inhabited houses is 12,546; of which 197 are terraced, 10,462 tiled, and 1,887 thatched. The population is composed of the following classes:\u2014\nThe population of the city was 57,815 in 1871, and 60,292 in 1881. It therefore increased by over 28 per cent. in the 20 years.\n\nThe city is built in a valley formed by two ridges, running north and south. There is also a slight ascent on the northern side. The streets out of the fort were comparatively broad and regular, and contained many substantial houses, some of them two or three storeys high. Within the fort, which is in the southern quarter, the streets were narrow and irregular, and most of the former houses had a mean and squalid appearance. But the great extension of the city, especially to the south-west, during recent years, and the immense improvements introduced on all sides have so completely transformed the place that persons who knew Mysore as it was twenty years ago would hardly recognise the present handsome and growing city, with its magnificent wide roads and imposing buildings.\n\nThe new portion of the town, called (after the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja) Ch\u00e1mar\u00e1japura, has more than doubled its area. Conspicuous on the high ground to the west, in Gordon Park, are the Public Offices, surmounted by a dome, with the statue of Sir James Gordon in front of the building. Close by are the Victoria Jubilee Institute and the pile of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja's College buildings, somewhat resembling a French ch\u00e2teau. Farther west are the groups of the Law Courts. The Maharani's Girls' School, Mari Mallapa's School, the Wesleyan Hardwicke College, and a Roman Catholic Church are among other large erections that catch the eye in this new quarter. A suitable railway station still remains to be built.\n\nIn the older parts of the city the changes have been equally striking. The most important perhaps has been the filling in of the portentous great drain known as Purnaiya's Nullah. Its place has been taken by a fine wide road, called Say\u00e1ji Rao road after the Gaikawar of Baroda. Other distinguished visitors have been similarly commemorated. One fine road is thus named the Albert Victor road; the new Devar\u00e1j Market has in front of it the Dufferin Fountain; and the Say\u00e1ji Rao road is flanked by the Lansdowne Bazaars, a picturesque two-storeyed range extending along the west of the Fort.\nThe Fort is of a quadrangular ground plan, three of the sides being about 450 yards in length, and the remaining or south side somewhat longer. The gates are situated on the north, south and west; those on the north and south are protected by out-works. Flanking towers command the curtain at frequent intervals; there is a casemate at the south-eastern, and a parapeted cavalier at the north-eastern angle, but the defences are mean and ill-planned. A ditch was carried round the fort and a sloping glacis, covered with houses abutting on it on all sides but the east, where the fort ditch is separated from the D\u00e9var\u00e1j tank only by the high road to Nanjangud. The interior of the fort was crowded with houses, principally occupied by retainers of the palace. All this has now been changed. The ditch has been filled up and ornamental shrubberies and gardens laid out round the fort. The most crowded parts of the interior have been cleared out and general improvements introduced. In the open space outside the east gate are the Rangacharla Memorial Hall and other large buildings, and it is proposed to erect here an equestrian statue of the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja.\n\nThe palace of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, which is situated inside the fort, facing nearly due east, is built in the ultra Hind\u00fa style, and, with the exception of a few paintings executed by European painters at various times in the palace employ, contains little trace of the influence of European art. The front, which is gaudily painted and supported by four elaborately carved wooden pillars, comprises the Sejj\u00e9 or Dasara hall, an open gallery where the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja is in the habit of showing himself to the people on great occasions, seated on his throne. This throne is one of the articles of interest in the palace. The original structure, which was of fig-wood overlaid with ivory, is generally stated to have been sent by Aurangzeb to Chikka D\u00e9va R\u00e1ja in 1699; but some doubt has been thrown on this assertion by Colonel Wilks. The palace legend runs that it was discovered buried at Penugonda, by the founders of the Vijayanagar empire, Hakka or Harihara and Bukka, to whom its locality was revealed by an ascetic named Vidy\u00e1ranya, and that it was handed down from dynasty to dynasty until it came into the possession of R\u00e1ja Wodeyar. According to the same legend, it had once been the throne of the P\u00e1ndus, who reigned at Hastin\u00e1-pura, and Kampula R\u00e1ja is said to have brought it thence and buried it at Penugonda. It is certain, however, that the ivory throne was used by Chikka D\u00e9va R\u00e1ja and his successors up to the accession of Tipu Sultan; that it was discovered in a lumber room of the Muhammadan palace after the downfall of Seringapatam, and employed at the coronation of the restored R\u00e1ja. Since then it has entirely lost its original character, the ivory which covered the fig-wood of which the\nthrone is made having been in its turn overlaid with gold and silver plating, which is carved into figures relating to Hindu mythology; the simha, or popular Hindu representation of a lion, whence the Sanskrit term for throne derives its name, being predominant, while the hamsa, a mythical bird, regarding which the legend runs that the head on which its shadow falls will once be encircled by a crown, surmounts the structure. As the crown in Travancore, so the throne is the peculiar emblem of royalty in Mysore, and on this account the Mysore R\u00e1ja is distinguished by the appellation of Simh\u00e1san\u00e1dhipati or ruler enthroned. Another seat, known as Bhadr\u00e1sana or the auspicious seat, is used for minor ceremonies.\n\nTo revert to the palace, its principal gate opens on a passage under the Sejje, leading to an open yard. At the further or west side of this courtyard is the door leading to the women's apartments, which occupy most of the western portion of the palace. The northern side comprises various offices, such as the armory, library, &c.; and on the south are the rooms occupied by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja. Of these the most interesting is the Amb\u00e1 vil\u00e1sa, an upstairs room sixty-five feet square and ten feet high, with a raised ceiling in the centre. It was here that the former R\u00e1ja received his European guests and transacted the ordinary business of the day. A wooden railing separated that portion of the room in which the R\u00e1ja's seat was placed from the rest, and the adjacent wall was hung with pictures, principally of officers connected at different periods with Mysore, which His Highness was accustomed to uncover and point out to his European visitors. The floor was of chunam, and, with the exception of the doors, which were overlaid with richly carved ivory or silver, there was no attempt at magnificence or display. This hall has been recently entirely renewed in more modern style, and the ceiling raised on handsome iron pillars. The sleeping and eating apartments of the R\u00e1ja, which are for the most part small and confined, all opened upon the Amb\u00e1 vil\u00e1sa, and just outside it was the stall in which was kept the cow worshipped by His Highness. The chapel is adjacent. Although the palace had been almost entirely built since the year 1800, it was in very bad repair, and many of the tenements attached to it were crumbling to ruin. The only remaining portion of the palace of the old Hindu dynasty, which Tipu Sultan demolished, is a room in the interior, with mud walls of great thickness and stability. This is known as the Painted Hall, owing to the decoration of its ceiling, and is said to have been the state room of the old palace, which was a much less pretentious building.\n\n---\n\n1 In February 1897, this and other parts were damaged by fire, and are being rebuilt with more durable and less combustible materials.\nwith most oriental courts, there was no attempt at isolation, and except in front, where there is an open space, the palace was pressed close on all sides by the dwellings of the poorer inhabitants.\n\nOpposite the northern gate of the Fort is a lofty building known as the Jagan M\u00f3han Mahal, intended by the former R\u00e1ja as an ornament to the town and a place of amusement for the European officers. The walls of the upper storey are painted with pictures, in many cases verging on the grotesque, representing the R\u00e1ja in procession on shik\u00e1r expeditions, and so forth. Another of the royal buildings is the Summer Palace, situated some distance east of the Fort. Here the late Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja received his instruction and the present Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja is doing the same. Adjoining it are the royal stables and a zoological garden. In the grounds is an old maze. In the same direction, to the south-east, is the new race-course, near the base of the Chamundi hill. The old race-course at Hinikal, some miles to the west, was given up in 1893.\n\nThe houses of the European residents are situated east of the town. The former Residency is now known as Government House, and is reserved for European guests. The front portion of the building, which possesses a large and handsome portico, was erected in 1805, under Major Wilks, and is of the Doric order of architecture. The back was added a few years later by Sir John Malcolm, and comprises one of the largest rooms without pillars in Southern India. It was designed by de Havilland. The present Residency is well situated on rising ground to the east, with an extensive view over Mysore. It was originally the residence of Dr. Campbell, the Durbar Surgeon in Sir Mark Cubbon\u2019s time. But Sir James Gordon, who had occupied it when guardian to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, converted it into the Residency in 1881. Of the other European houses, one opposite the west gate of Government House awakens interest from the fact that it was built and for some time occupied by the great Duke of Wellington, then Colonel Wellesley.\n\nThe present town of Mysore cannot perhaps boast of much antiquity. But the place seems to have been known by its present name from the remotest times. For it corresponds with the Mahishmati of the P\u00e1ndava prince Sahadeva\u2019s expedition mentioned in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata, and is the Mahisha to which the Maurya king Asoka sent a missionary in the 3rd century B.C. to proclaim the religion of Buddha. We find Maisun\u00e1d or Maisur-n\u00e1d mentioned in inscriptions of the 11th and 12th centuries, and the Y\u00e1dava princes from Dv\u00e1raka in Gujarat who, according to inscriptions, coming to worship their family god at Yadugiri or Melukote, became the founders of the Mysore house, are said to\nhave been attracted by the beauty of the country to settle in the town of Mahish\u00far. But at the beginning of the 16th century its site was occupied by a village named Pu\u1e63agere. At this time the dominions of the R\u00e1ja of Vijayanagar, the ancient city on the banks of the Tungabhadra, extended really or nominally over nearly the whole of South India. The tradition regarding the origin of the present Mysore dynasty, which savours of the age of knight-errantry, is given under Hadin\u00e1ru. The first of the line took the title of Wodeyar, and his successors gradually extended their little dominions until one of them named Be\u1e6d\u1e6dada Ch\u00e1ma R\u00e1ja divided his country between his three sons.\u00b9 To Ch\u00e1ma R\u00e1ja, surnamed B\u00f3l or the bald, he gave Pu\u1e63agere. Here a fort was either constructed or repaired in the year 1524, to which, from Mahish\u00e1sura or the buffalo-headed monster whose overthrow was the most noted exploit of K\u00e1li or Ch\u00e1mundi, the name of Mahish\u00far (buffalo town), or in its Anglicised form Mysore, was again given. Fort after fort was subdued, and the limits of the country followed the progress of invading armies to the south. But till the beginning of the 17th century each successive Wodeyar or Arasu paid tribute to the viceroy of Seringapatam, who derived his power from the R\u00e1ja of Vijayanagar; and an old manuscript affords a curious picture of the simplicity of the age and the poverty of the Mysore Arasu, who is stated to have been obliged to live on r\u00e1gi until a grant of wet land on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri from the viceroy at Seringapatam enabled him to procure rice for his table. But in proportion as the power of the viceroys became more and more effete, that of the Mysore Arasus grew stronger and stronger; the latter gradually evaded payment of tribute to the former, and in 1610, whether by fair means or foul is uncertain, obtained possession of Seringapauam itself, and with it what remained of the power and influence of the viceroys. Thenceforth Seringapatam became the seat of government of the Arasus.\n\nIt does not fall within the scope or purpose of this part of the work to follow the gradual expansion of the Mysore State under the Arasus, who in 1731 became subservient to the ends of the Dalav\u00e1yi or hereditary State minister and general; nor to describe the transformation of Mysore to a Musalm\u00e1n state under the usurper Haidar Ali, who kept the representatives of the Hindu dynasty in the position of State prisoners in their own palace at Seringapatam. Haidar\u2019s son Tipu attempted to obliterate all traces of the Hindu r\u00e1j, and in pursuance of this policy caused the town and fort of Mysore, the ancient residence of the R\u00e1jas, to be razed to the ground, and deported all the inhabitants\n\n\u00b9 Wilks says:\u2014\u201cA grant is extant, dated in 1548, from Tim R\u00e1j, probably the same to whom Hcmanhally was assigned.\u201d\u2014Hist., Ch. II, p. 22.\nto the neighbourhood of Seringapatam. The stones of the old fort he employed in building another fortress, on a slight eminence about a mile to the east, to which he gave the appellation, still retained by the site, of Nazar\u00e1b\u00e1d, or the place visited by the eye of the Almighty, and the remains of this fort are still to be seen.\n\nThe work, which, according to Major Wilks, could not have been of the slightest use in defending the country, was still unfinished at the fall of Seringapatam in 1799; and when it had been determined that the inauguration of the R\u00e1ja, then a child of four years old, should take place at Mysore, it was discovered that, owing to the almost universal demolition of the place by Tipu, the workmen's huts at Nazar\u00e1b\u00e1d formed the only accommodation available for the performance of the ceremony. Into the best of these the young R\u00e1ja was conducted and placed on the throne, while the work of rebuilding the palace of his ancestors was going on. The restoration of the fort was commenced at the same time, and for this purpose the stones which Tipu had removed to Nazar\u00e1b\u00e1d were brought back again. Owing to the presence of the court the town grew rapidly, and in time drew to itself much of the population of Seringapatam, which decreased as Mysore increased in importance. The R\u00e1ja, at first through the Dew\u00e1n P\u00farnaiya, continued to govern the country till 1831, when in consequence of disturbances in the north of Mysore a clause of the treaty of 1799 was put in force, and the government was vested in a Commission composed chiefly of British officers and subordinate to the Government of India.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja still continued to reside in his palace at Mysore, and the settlement on him of one-fifth of the revenue of the country enabled him in a great measure to give reins to the princely liberality which formed the chief element in his character. He died at Mysore on the 27th of March 1868, aged 75, the oldest sovereign in India. It seemed almost hard to believe that the R\u00e1ja who so short a time ago was on his throne in full possession of his faculties, was a man whose early childhood had been subject to the caprice of Tipu Sultan, and who remembered the great Duke of Wellington while yet in his prime: so completely had he outlived associations. Immediately after his death his adopted son, by name Ch\u00e1ma R\u00e1j\u00e9ndra Wodeyar, a child of four years old, was proclaimed Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, and in 1881 the country was restored to him and again placed under Hindu government. During his reign of 13 years took place the gradual transformation of Mysore into the handsome city it now promises to become. And after his lamented death at the close of 1894, his eldest son, then 10 years of age, was proclaimed Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja, under the regency of his mother, the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ni.\nMunicipality.\u2014The municipality is conducted under Mysore Regulation III of 1888, and is presided over by the Deputy Commissioner, with the Town Magistrate as Vice-President. There are eight wards or municipal divisions, called Mohallas, of which a list is given in the margin.\n\nBesides the President and Vice-President there are 20 Municipal Commissioners, half of whom are either ex-officio or nominated by Government, and the other half elected. The privilege of election was granted in 1892, and out of 985 qualified voters 695 went to the polls. The Commissioners are elected for two years.\n\nOf the various improvements carried out in municipal limits many have been largely aided by Government funds and executed by the Public Works Department, as they were quite beyond the means of the municipality. In 1886 a complete system of drainage was provided for the Fort, and by the acquisition of houses on payment of compensation some broad streets were opened out, and the precincts of the palace greatly improved. The sanitation of some other parts of the old town are still very defective. The Municipal Report says that \u201cin the Mandi, Lashkar and Devaraj Mohallas the houses are crowded together in all manner of ways, lanes in some places being too narrow even for one man to go through, and too crooked to admit of straight cuts of even 20 yards in their whole length. In these lanes also soak the sewage water of all the adjoining houses, so that only those long accustomed to the spots can walk there during nights without soiling their feet, and without knocking their heads against the walls of the houses.\u201d Proposals to improve these conditions are, notwithstanding, strongly opposed by the people generally. But a system of conservancy is being gradually introduced.\n\nThe most beneficial undertaking has been the provision of a pure water supply. For this purpose the Kukarhalli reservoir was formed towards the high ground on the west, and water has been for several years laid on to all parts of the city in iron mains, from which it is drawn off at hydrants and stand-pipes or fountains at all convenient points in the streets. A high level reservoir has also been constructed, the water in which is drawn from the Kaveri river near Anandur, and forced up with the aid of turbines erected there.\n\nThe operations connected with suitably laying out and populating the large western extension of Chamarajpura, by sale of sites, &c., were entrusted to a special Building Committee. The results have been already generally described. An interesting movement has been the\nmigration of a number of families of the weaver caste from Salem to settle in Mysore. For their accommodation a special site was granted in the new Mohalla, and a local sahuk\u00e1r has undertaken, with advances from Government, the erection of the necessary houses and buildings for them.\n\nThe following is a statement of the income and expenditure of the municipality for five years to 1895-6:\n\n| Receipts | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Octroi   | 59,687 | 60,226 | 58,048 | 58,650 | 60,000 |\n| Tax on houses, buildings and lands | 14,611 | 11,692 | 11,993 | 15,000 | 15,000 |\n| Licenses | 6,369  | 7,513  | 8,650  | 14,720 | 9,237  |\n| Carriage tax | 797    | 247    | 567    | 470    | 470    |\n| Tax on Animals | 1,487  | 499    | 848    | 930    | 930    |\n| Mohatarfa | 9,624  | 8,230  | 7,964  | 9,000  | 9,000  |\n| Rents    | 4,625  | 4,311  | 6,915  | 5,320  | 6,130  |\n| Fines    | 25     | \u2014      | 6      | 50     | 10     |\n| Miscellaneous | 5,769  | 7,058  | 13,402 | 5,380  | 6,250  |\n| Adjustment of advances | \u2014      | 8,159  | 12,503 | \u2014      | \u2014      |\n\nTotal Rs. | 1,02,994 | 1,07,945 | 1,20,896 | 1,09,520 | 1,07,027 |\n\n| Expenditure | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Head Office | 3,505  | 3,693  | 7,161  | 8,963  | 7,763  |\n| Collection  | 10,615 | 9,729  | 8,557  | 9,216  | 9,216  |\n| Conservancy | 25,628 | 21,474 | 23,912 | 24,742 | 23,992 |\n| Registration of Births and Deaths | 101    | 180    | 177    | 280    | 280    |\n| Lighting    | 5,632  | 6,202  | 5,328  | 7,760  | 6,260  |\n| Public Works| 23,555 | 23,336 | 32,087 | 41,112 | 32,512 |\n| Charitable Grants | 921    | 3,557  | 4,371  | 5,584  | 5,360  |\n| Education   | 11,915 | 10,222 | 9,346  | 9,696  | 9,596  |\n| Miscellaneous | 9,119  | 22,094 | 10,195 | 14,593 | 14,793 |\n| Advances    | \u2014      | 7,724  | 7,792  | \u2014      | \u2014      |\n\nTotal Rs. | 90,991 | 1,08,211 | 1,08,928 | 1,21,946 | 1,09,872 |\n\nN\u00e1gamangala.\u2014A taluq in the north, transferred from the Hassan District in 1882. Area 401 square miles. Head-quarters at N\u00e1gamangala. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014N\u00e1gamangala, 2,938; Bell\u00far, 1,484.\n\nThe Shimsha forms part of the eastern boundary, and receives nearly all the smaller streams of the taluq. The Lokop\u00e1vani has its source in the south-west. The country is generally pretty level, except for some low rocky hills in the north and west, more or less covered with scrub jungle. The principal point is called Chunchangiri. To the west of N\u00e1gamangala is a hill of talcose argillite, closely resembling potstone, and used by the natives in the same way for pencils. The number of tanks is about 130, of which some 30 are of considerable size; but many of them shallow from being silted up. There are no other means of irrigation.\n\nThe dry crop soils are mostly indifferent, sandy, gravelly and shallow soil being common. But good red soil is also met with; black soil is very uncommon. The soil of the wet lands is fairly good, but rather too sandy. R\u00e1gi is the staple crop. In the vicinity of the rocky hills a coarse kind of rice is grown in situations where, from percolation of moisture, ordinary dry crops cannot be raised. Rice is almost the only wet crop, sugar-cane being rarely grown. The gardens are poor, and the famine destroyed all the areca-nut trees, leaving only a certain amount of cocoa-nut trees.\n\nSheep are everywhere abundant, and a sheep farm was at one time maintained by Government at Heriganhalli. But it was given up in 1863. The cattle, as a rule, are small, but fine draught-bullocks, which are bred locally, are met with in most villages and fetch a high price. Karadihalli is the centre of a tract specially given to the breeding and rearing of Hallikar cattle. Brass work of various kinds is an industry of N\u00e1gamangala.\n\nIn the middle of the 15th century there was a family of chiefs who called themselves Lords of N\u00e1gamangala. They were of the Lohita family, and inscriptions mention the following:\u2014Singa\u1e47\u1e47a Wodeyar, whose wife was Sit\u00e1mbika. His son, Timmanna Dann\u00e1yaka,\nwhose wife was Rang\u00e1mbika or Ranga N\u00e1yaki; he was minister to the Vijayanagar king Mallik\u00e1rjuna or Imma\u1e0di Praudha Deva R\u00e1ja (1446\u20131467), and rebuilt Melukote. He was apparently the first who erected a fort on the island of Seringapatam. Deva R\u00e1ja, son of Singan\u00f1a Wodeyar; he built a new dam on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri and led a channel from it to Harahu, now called Haravu. This family apparently did not survive the disaster which broke up the Vijayanagar empire. For at the end of the 16th century we find N\u00e1gamangala included in the territory bestowed upon Jagadeva R\u00e1ya of Channapatna (Bangalore District) for his gallant defence of Penugonda against the Muhammadans. From him it was taken by the R\u00e1ja of Mysore in 1630. Being in the line of march of the Mahrattas to Seringapatam, it more than once suffered during the last century from their depredations, which have left their mark upon the taluq.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1888. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 100,695; wet, 4,783; garden, 1,600) | ... | ... | 107,087 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 125,905 |\n| In\u00e1m villages | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 8,926 |\n| Forests (838); k\u00e1v\u00e1ls (2,949) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 3,787 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **245,705** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 10,968 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,36,926, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,48,616.\n\nThe average rainfall at N\u00e1gamangala for 26 years (1870\u201395), and at the other station for 3 years (1893\u20135) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| N\u00e1gamangala | 0\u00b005 | 0\u00b015 | 0\u00b026 | 1\u00b046 | 4\u00b065 | 1\u00b060 | 1\u00b010 | 2\u00b098 | 4\u00b011 | 7\u00b067 | 2\u00b091 | 0\u00b047 | ... | 27\u00b041 |\n| Nelligere | \u2014 | 0\u00b010 | 0\u00b050 | 2\u00b034 | 4\u00b056 | 3\u00b013 | 2\u00b071 | 2\u00b074 | 7\u00b022 | 12\u00b058 | 3\u00b034 | 0\u00b015 | ... | 39\u00b037 |\n\nAnother register for Nelligere for 4 years gives the annual average as 35\u00b093.\n\nThe Bangalore-Hassan trunk road passes through the north of the taluq from east to west, and is crossed at Nelligere by the Seringapatam-Sira road, which runs north through French Rocks and N\u00e1gamangala. From the latter there is a road south-west to Krishnar\u00e1jpet, and two unfinished roads west to Sravan Belgola and south-east to Basar\u00e1l and Mandya.\n\nN\u00e1gamangala.\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 49' N. lat., 76\u00b0 49' E. long., on the Seringapatam-Sira road, 24 miles north of the railway at French Rocks, and 39 miles north of Mysore.

The inner fort was erected in 1270 by Chaimi Dannayak, and a line of chiefs of the Lohita family continued to be lords of N\u00e1gamangala till the end of the 15th century or longer. The outer fort was erected in 1578 by Jagadeva R\u00e1yal of Channapatna (Bangalore District), of whose dominions N\u00e1gamangala was one of the chief towns. It was captured in 1630 by Ch\u00e1ma R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore. The town was reduced to ruins in 1792 by the Mahratta army under Parasu Ram Bhaq, and 150,000 palm-trees were destroyed. Brass artistic work is made at N\u00e1gamangala.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 534    | 581    | 908    | 984    |\n| Expenditure    | 368    | 399    | 956    | 1,125  |\n\nNanjangud.\u2014A taluq in the centre southwards.

There was not much wet cultivation, what there was depending upon rain-fed tanks. But the recent extension of the Rampur channel has brought more land under irrigation. The largest tank is the Nars\u00e1mbudhi, two miles south of the kasba. A considerable quantity of j\u00f3la is grown.\n\nGold-mining has commenced at Wolgere, to the south-west of Nanjang\u00fad. In the north-west of the taluq are some quarries of pot-stone intermixed in layers with schistose mica.\n\nNanjang\u00fad is the present terminus of the Mysore State Railway from Bangalore. The Mysore-Trichinopoly road via the H\u00e1san\u00far ghat runs through Nanjang\u00fad, near to which the high road to Ootacamund branches off. There is also a road from Kaulandi to Yelandur. A road runs from Nanjang\u00fad east to Tirumak\u00fadlu-Narsipur, and west to Hullahalli, turning south to Hura. The road from Begur to Heggadadevankote crosses the south-west of the taluq.\n\nThe total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 2,13,692, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,50,172.\n\nThe average rainfall at Nanjang\u00fad for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | March | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|-------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| 0\u00b007 | 0\u00b003 | 0\u00b044  | 2\u00b039  | 5\u00b036 | 1\u00b061 | 1\u00b078 | 2\u00b051 | 6\u00b008  | 5\u00b086 | 2\u00b048 | 0\u00b045 | 26\u00b066 |\n\n**Nanjang\u00fad.**\u2014A town situated 12\u00b0 7' N. lat., 76\u00b0 45' E. long., on the right bank of the Kabbani, 12 miles south of Mysore, at the point where the trunk road from Mysore branches to Ootacamund and to the H\u00e1san\u00far ghat.

It is now noted for its temple dedicated to Nanjund\u00e9svara, an appellation given to Siva on account of one of his exploits in swallowing poison, and it is from this attribute of the god that the town derives its name. A temple of small dimensions is said to have existed from time immemorial. In one part of the temple are 66 images of Saiva saints, the tiruttondar, which may be of Chola origin, of the 11th century. But Karach\u00far Nandi R\u00e1ja, and afterwards P\u00farnaiya, enlarged the temple to its present size. The former prince made Nanjang\u00fad his favourite place of abode and fortified it. A celebrated car-festival, which lasts for three days, and is resorted to by thousands of devotees from all parts of South India, is held here at the end of March. The temple is 385 feet long by 160 broad, and supported by 147 columns. Some of the images are carved with great perfection of finish. Surrounding the outside of the temple are the figures of various deities with their names below, so that each votary can find his patron saint. The gopura was erected in 1845 by Mummadi Krishna Raja Wodeyar, and various shrines were added by the royal ladies down to 1853. This temple is inferior in point of sanctity to none in the Mysore District, and receives an annual allowance from Government of Rs. 20,197. At the point where a stream called the Ch\u00farnavati from the tank runs into the Gundal or Kaundinya river is the Parasu Rama kshetra, with a temple of Parasu Rama. The moist earth around, called mritika, is considered an effective application for various skin diseases, and is being continually carried away to be used for such purposes. But the excavations speedily fill up again.\n\nAbout a mile from Nanjang\u00fad is a fine bungalow attached to the Mysore Residency, near to which is a rude stone bridge across the Kabbani, constructed about 120 years ago by Deva R\u00e1j, the Dalav\u00e1yi of Mysore.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 4,956  | 4,432  | 4,334  | 5,462  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 5,691  | 6,953  | 7,301  | 8,904  |\n\n**Nidugatta.**\u2014A village in the Mandya taluq, 18 miles north-east of the kasba, on the Bangalore-Mysore road. Population 805.\n\nA large fair is held on Wednesday, attended by 2,000 people.\n\n**Nugu,** also called the Bhrigu, an affluent of the Kabbani. It rises in Wainad and, entering the Mysore District in the south-west of the Heggadadevankote taluq, runs in a northerly direction, joining the Kabbani near the village of Hampapura on the Mysore-Manantody\nroad. It is dammed by the Lakshmanpura anicut, from which issues a channel of the same name, 5 miles in length. The cultivation under the channel is of small extent, 297 acres, in consequence of the jungle surrounding. The revenue obtained amounts to Rs. 1,401. Gold dust in small quantities has been occasionally found in the bed of the stream, but never sufficient to repay the trouble of searching for it. It is supposed to be washed down from the source of the river in the Nellambur hills in Malabar.\n\n**Palhalli.**\u2014A village in Seringapatam taluq, on the right bank of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, 3 miles west of Seringapatam, on the Seringapatam-Mercara road. Head-quarters of the Palhalli hobli. Till 1871 it was the kasba of the then Mysore Ashtagram taluq. Population 1,858.\n\nIt used to be well known for the now abandoned factories of the Ashtagram Sugar Works, a description of which will be found in Vol. I. of this work.\n\n**Paschima-vahini.**\u2014A sacred spot on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, adjoining Seringapatam on the south-west, and a railway station. The river here makes a bend to the west, whence the name *paschima v\u00e1hini*, the western stream, sometimes shortened into *pachiv\u00e1n*. The royal bathing ghat of the Mysore R\u00e1jas is here, together with many other bathing ghats. The Bang\u00e1radodd\u00ed dam is on this stream, and gives rise to the channel of the same name, which waters the island of Seringapatam (see Seringapatam taluq).\n\n**Piriyapatna.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 21' N. lat., 76\u00b0 9' E. long., on the Mysore-Mercara road, 13 miles west by north of Hunsur. Formerly the head-quarters of the taluq which bore its name, now called Hunsur taluq. Population, 3,712.\n\nAccording to tradition the place was visited in the mythological ages by Agastya, the first Brahman teacher who crossed the Vindhya mountains. Its ancient name was Singapattana, and here Karikala Chola R\u00e1ja is stated to have formed a tank and erected a temple of Mallik\u00e1rjunesvara. From inscriptions it appears that the place was one of the principal towns in the territory of the Chang\u00e1lva kings of Nanjar\u00e1yapattana (near Fraserpet in Coorg). They submitted to the Chola kings, and were thence designated Kulottunga-Chola-Chang\u00e1lvas. They claim to be descended from an original Chang\u00e1lva who was victorious over king Bjjjala and assumed his titles. As Bjjjala the Kalachurya king reigned from 1156 to 1167, this must be the period of Chang\u00e1lva. In his line was descended N\u00e1ga, whose son was Ranga, whose son was Piriya, whose sons were Nanja and Mahadera, the former on the throne in 1521. Nanja's son was Nanjunda, his son Srikantha, his sons Vira (1559 and 1567), and Piriya (1586 and 1589).\nNanjunda Arasu, tradition says, passing that way to a marriage at Hanagod, was led by the circumstance of a hare starting up and biting the heels of his horse, which indicated *gandu bhumi* or male soil, to erect a mud fort there. But it was Piriya R\u00e1ja who replaced the mud fort by one of stone, established the p\u00e9te, and called the town after himself\u2014Piriyapattna. Another Nanja Raja followed, whose son, Rudra Gana or Piriya, was in power between 1597 and 1612. His son, Vira Raja, was on the throne in 1615, and during his reign the place was besieged for one year by Kanthirava Narasa Raja of Mysore. At last, when the fort was assaulted, Vira Raja, putting all his family and children to death, died fighting his enemies. During the reign of Tipu, Piriyapatna witnessed several conflicts between the Coorgs and Mysoreans, and the V\u00edra R\u00e1ya, or R\u00e1ja of Coorg, was confined within the fort for four years. On the approach of General Abercromby\u2019s army the houses of Piriyapatna were destroyed, and the fort was rendered useless to the enemy.\n\nOwing to its position, the town is chiefly inhabited by traders, who export commodities, such as cotton and tobacco, to Coorg, Cannanore, &c. The large stone fort is in a ruinous condition. It was formerly infested by tigers, and even now it is said that cheetahs are occasionally found there. A pack of hounds is maintained in the neighbourhood by Mr. Murray Aynsley, and regularly hunted by planters from Coorg and other gentlemen.\n\n**Saligram.**\u2014A town in the Yedatore taluq, on the north bank of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, 12 miles north-west of Yedatore, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|---------------------|--------|----------|-------|\n| Hindus...           | 1,532  | 1,579    | 3,111 |\n| Muhammadans         | 156    | 177      | 333   |\n| Jains               | 163    | 181      | 344   |\n| **Total**           | **1,851** | **1,937** | **3,788** |\n\nIt is esteemed sacred by the followers of Vishnu on account of its having been the residence of R\u00e1m\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1ri.

The L\u00f3kap\u00e1vani from the north, uniting with a stream from the M\u00f3ti T\u00e1l\u00e1b on the west, runs south into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri off the north-east of the Seringapatam island, under the Karighatta peak. The country rising gradually on both sides of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri is naturally fertile, and for some distance from either bank is irrigated by fine channels drawn from the river, which follow the windings of the hills, and as they advance horizontally to the eastward send off branches to water the intermediate space. Of the anicuts or dams which force the water into the sources of these channels, there are five in this taluq. (1.) The Madad Kat\u1e6de just beyond the border, in Krishnarajpet taluq, gives rise to the Chikkadevar\u00e1yas\u00e1gara, the finest channel in the Mysore country, 10 or 12 yards wide, and 3 or $3\\frac{1}{2}$ deep, running for 72 miles on the left bank. It is carried across the L\u00f3kap\u00e1vani by means of an aqueduct near the French Rocks, winds round the Karighatta hill, passes on to Arakere and terminates in the Bannur tank. (2.) The Devar\u00e1j Kat\u1e6de is close to the former, and supplies the Devar\u00e1j channel on the right bank, which is 18 miles long and runs by P\u00e1lhalli into the Mysore taluq. (3.) From the Balmuri dam, a mile from Belagola, is drawn the Virj\u00e1nadi channel, having a course of 41 miles on the right bank, of which 35 are in this taluq. (4.) The Bang\u00e1rado\u1e0d\u1e0di dam is thrown across the paschima v\u0101hini or western stream of the river at Seringapatam. The channel thence drawn is altogether 9 miles long. It is led by an aqueduct over a second stream into the island, where it divides into three branches, one entering the fort by an underground duct, a second running to the Darya Daulat B\u00e1gh, and the third to the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh near the mausoleum of Haidar and Tipu. (5.) The Ramaswami dam, situated between Arakere on the left bank, and Mahadevapura on the right, gives rise to two channels, which are mostly out of this taluq\u2014the Ramaswami, running for 30 miles on the left bank, and the R\u00e1japaramesvari, running for 21 miles on the right bank. There is also an anicut on the Lakshmantirtha near Yedatore, from which an old channel called the P\u00farn\u00e1s\u00e1gara N\u00e1la passes through the Belagola hobli, but this is not now in use. A line of hills runs through the taluq north from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, prominent peaks of which are Karighatta (2,697 ft.), French Rocks (2,882 ft.), and Yadugiri (3,579 ft.) at Melukote.\nThe soils under the channels are good, but of comparatively light order; towards the north-east there are some poorly populated and wild, but not very extensive, stretches of country. In the valleys and lowlands away from the channels there is a good deal of very fairly good soil. In addition to the cultivation of rice, which is general, sugar-cane of the kind known as pattapatti is extensively grown, especially under the first and third of the channels above mentioned. This found encouragement from the Ashtagram sugar works when they were in operation. The dry crops are those usual to the country, ragi being the principal, with which are sown avare and haralu. The gardens vary from those of the first class under channels to such as are merely hand-watered and planted with minor produce.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1890. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 70,956; wet, 21,898; garden, 2,650) | ... | ... | 95,504 |\n| Unculturable (roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 61,485 |\n| In\u00e1m villages, 18,206; k\u00e1vals, 191 | ... | ... | ... | ... | 18,397 |\n\nTotal acres ... 175,386\n\nThe unoccupied area was 7,937 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,74,463, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,01,293.\n\nThe average rainfall at Seringapatam for 26 years (1870\u201395), and for 3 years (1893\u20135) at the other station was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| Seringapatam | 0'23 | 0'04 | 0'58 | 1'63 | 5'27 | 2'13 | 1'91 | 2'97 | 3'58 | 6'72 | 2'24 | 0'67 | 27'97 |\n| French Rocks | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0'48 | 3'19 | 4'24 | 2'32 | 1'10 | 3'25 | 4'48 | 7'19 | 1'34 | \u2014 | 27'59 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Mysore Railway runs through the middle of the taluq from east to south, with stations at French Rocks, Seringapatam, and Paschima V\u00e1hini. The trunk road is alongside the railway, with the one to Coorg going off to the west from Paschima V\u00e1hini. There are also roads from Seringapatam, north to French Rocks and Nagamangala, with a branch to Krishnar\u00e1jpet and another to Melukote with continuation to the same place; and one south-east to Bannur. There is also a road from Lingar\u00e1jchatra west through French Rocks to Kannamb\u00e1di.\n\nSeringapatam.\u2014Properly S\u2019r\u00ed-Ranga-pattana, is situated in 12\u00b0 25' N. lat., 76\u00b0 45' E. long., at the western or upper end of an island in the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, about three miles in length from west to east and one in breadth. The eastern end of the island is occupied by the prosperous suburb of Ganjam. Seringapatam, the head-quarters of the taluq of the same name and a municipality, stands on the Mysore State Rail-\nway and on the Bangalore-Mysore high road, 75 miles south-west from the former and 10 north-east from the latter.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 2 Jains) | 4,997 | 5,592 | 10,589 |\n| Muhammadans       | 853   | 931    | 1,784 |\n| Christians        | 81    | 97     | 178   |\n| **Total**         | **5,931** | **6,620** | **12,551** |\n\nIn the earliest ages, Gautama rishi is related to have worshipped the Rangan\u00e1thasw\u00e1mi whose temple is the principal Hindu building in the fort, and to have done penance in this the western or Paschima Rangan\u00e1tha kshetra as distinguished from the eastern or P\u00farva Rangan\u00e1tha kshetra at Srirangam near Trichinopoly.\u00b9 The Gautama kshetra is a small island to the west of Seringapatam where the river divides. Under two large boulders on the north side of it is what is called the rishi\u2019s cave, now closed up. Opposite, on the north bank of the river, were found old Ganga inscriptions of the 9th century, referring to the Kalbappu hill at Sravana Belgola, and describing its summit as marked by the footprints of the munis Bhadrab\u00e1hu and Chandra Gupta.\n\nIn 894, during the reign of the Ganga sovereigns, a person named Tirumalaiya appears to have founded on the island, then entirely overrun with jungle, two temples, one of Rangan\u00e1tha, and a smaller one of Tirumala Deva, enclosing them with a wall, and to have called the place Sri-Ranga-pura or pattana.\u00b2 Subsequently, about 1117, Ram\u00e1nuj\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, the celebrated apostle of the Vishnuvite sect, on fleeing from Dravida to avoid a confession of faith prescribed by the Chola Raja to be made by all his subjects, the object of which was to establish the superiority of Siva over Vishnu, took refuge in the Mysore country, where he succeeded in converting from the Jain faith the powerful Hoysala king, Bitti Deva, thenceforth known as Vishnuvardhana. This royal convert conferred on his apostle and his followers the tract of country on each side of the river K\u00e1veri at Seringapatam, known by the name of Asht\u00e1gr\u00e1ma or eight townships, over which he appointed his own officers under the ancient designations of Prabhus and Hebb\u00e1rs.\n\n\u00b9 The temples of Rangan\u00e1thasw\u00e1mi on the three islands of Seringapatam, Siva-samudram and Srirangam are also called respectively those of Adi Ranga, Madhya Ranga, and Antya Ranga, or the Ranga of the beginning, the middle and the end.\n\n\u00b2 J. R. A. S. VIII, 6; Mad. J. Lit. &c Sr. XIV, 13.\nIn 1454, Timmanna, a Hebb\u0101r descended from one of these, lord of N\u0101gamangala, obtained, by a visit to Vijayanagar, the government of the district with the title of Dan\u0101yak, and permission to erect a fort at Srirangapattana. This he did with the aid of a hidden treasure he had discovered, and enlarged the temple of Rangan\u0101tha, making use of materials obtained from the demolition of 101 Jain temples at Ka\u1e37asv\u0101\u1e0di, a town 5 miles to the south. His descendants held the government until in 1495 Seringapatam passed into the direct possession of the Vijayanagar kings. For we learn from inscriptions that Narasa, the founder at that time of the second Vijayanagar dynasty, \u201cquickly damming up the K\u0101v\u0113ri when in full flood, crossed over and captured the enemy (unnamed) alive in battle. Taking possession of their kingdom he made the ancient Srirangapattana his own.\u201d The place was probably recognized as too important to remain in the hands of a nominal feudatory. It was eventually administered in the name of the Vijayanagar sovereigns by a viceroy known as the Sri-Ranga-R\u0101yal. Tirumala R\u0101ja, the last of these R\u0101yalu, was a relative of the royal family.\n\nWe have elsewhere seen how in 1610 Tirumala Raja, worn out with age and disease, surrendered his power to R\u0101ja Wodeyar, the rising ruler of Mysore. There is a halo of mystery surrounding this transaction, and some authorities maintain that the viceroy intended his sway to descend to his kinsman the R\u0101ja of Ummattur, but the probability is that, foreseeing his inevitable subjugation by R\u0101ja Wodeyar, he made a virtue of necessity in retiring voluntarily. Thenceforth Seringapatam became the capital of the Rajas of Mysore, and continued to be the seat of government under the Musalman dynasty until its capture by the British in 1799.\n\nBut in the interval Seringapatam had been several times besieged, particulars of which will be found in Vol. I in the chapter on History. In 1638 by Ran-dulha Khan and the Bijapur forces, which were repulsed with great slaughter by Kanthirava Narasa Raja. Later in the same reign by Sivappa Nayak of Bednur, when the invaders were again driven off. But the king thought it prudent in 1654 to strengthen the fort, and to stock it with provisions and stores to enable it to stand a prolonged siege. In 1697 by the Mahrattas, when the bulk of the army was absent, engaged in the siege of Trichinopoly. But this attempt was also foiled and the enemy suffered a crushing defeat. In 1732 the Navab of Arcot sent a powerful army against Seringapatam, but it was met at Kailancha, near Channapatna, and driven in confusion below the Ghats. In 1755, when most of the forces were again absent at Trichinopoly, the Subadar of the Dekkan besieged the fortress, with\nthe aid of a French force under Bussy. The latter was about to deliver\nthe assault against the north-east angle, when the enemy were bought\noff for 56 lakhs. The treasury being empty, one-third was raised on the\nplate and jewels of the Hindu temples and the property and ornaments\nof the Raja, and for the remainder bills were given, which, however,\nwere never redeemed. In 1757 by the Mahrattas under Balaji Rao,\nassisted by a European force. The place was reduced to extremity,\nand a compromise was made with the enemy for 32 lakhs; and as only\n5 could be raised in cash, 14 taluqs were pledged for the payment of\nthe rest. In 1759 the Mahrattas appeared in greater force under Gopal\nHari, and the defence was entrusted to Haidar Ali, now risen to high\ncommand. After various successes he compelled the enemy to give up\nthe pledged taluqs on payment of 32 lakhs in satisfaction of all\ndemands. By a levy on all the public servants and wealthy people\n16 lakhs were raised, and for the rest the bankers found the money on the\npersonal security of Haidar, in consideration of the restored taluqs being\nplaced under his direct management. Though not actually besieged,\nSeringapatam was taken possession of in June 1761 by Haidar, in con-\nsequence of the plots formed by the palace and the Hindu ministers to\nget rid of him, and his usurpation was from this time complete. The\nnext attack on the fortress was in March 1771, by the Mahrattas under\nTryambak Rao, after the disastrous defeat they had inflicted on\nHaidar at Chinkuruli. They blockaded Seringapatam for no less\nthan 15 months, when a treaty was concluded on payment of 15 lakhs\nand the surrender of seven taluqs in the east and north as security\nfor 15 lakhs more.\n\nThis brings us to the time of the two memorable sieges by the British\nin 1792 and 1799, in their wars against Tipu Sultan. On the former\noccasion the British army was commanded by Lord Cornwallis, the\nGovernor-General. The first attempt against Seringapatam was made\nin 1791, but owing to the failure of supplies and the great sickness that\nbroke out among men and cattle on the bursting of the monsoon, it\nwas found necessary to bury the battering guns and retire to Bangalore,\nwhich was done by the route of Melukote, Nagamangala and Magadi.\nThe operations against Seringapatam were resumed early in 1792, every\nprovision having in the interval been carefully made for the success of\nthe enterprise. The army arrived in sight of the fortress on the 6th of\nFebruary, and that very night were carried out the masterly operations,\nled by Lord Cornwallis in person, by which the whole of Tipu's force\nwas not only driven from the north of the river, but the British gained\na firm position on the island itself, occupying Shahar Ganjam and all\nthe east, including the Darya Daulat Bagh.\nThe following is a description of the place at that time by Major Dirom, who was a Staff officer with the army:\n\nThe fort and outworks occupy about a mile of the west end of the island, and the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh or garden about the same portion of the east end. The whole space between the fort and the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, except a small inclosure, called the Daulat B\u00e1gh, on the north bank near the fort, was filled, before the war, with houses, and formed an extensive suburb, of which the pettah of Shahar Ganjam is the only remaining part, the rest having been destroyed by Tipu to make room for batteries to defend the island, and to form an esplanade to the fort. This pettah or town of modern structure, built on the middle and highest part of the island, is about half a mile square, divided into regular cross streets, all wide, shaded on each side by trees and full of good houses. It is surrounded by a strong mud wall, and seemed to have been preserved for the accommodation of the bazar people and merchants, and for the convenience of troops stationed in that part of the island for its defence. A little way to the eastward of the pettah is the entrance into the great garden or L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh. It was laid out in regular shady walks of large cypress-trees, and full of fruit trees, flowers and vegetables of every description. The fort, thus situated on the west end of the island, is distinguished by its white walls, regular outworks, magnificent buildings and ancient Hindu pagodas, contrasted with the more lofty and splendid monuments lately raised in honour of the Mahomedan faith. The L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh, which occupies the east end of the island, possessing all the beauty and convenience of a country retirement, is dignified by the mausoleum of Haidar, and a superb new palace built by Tipu. To these add the idea of an extensive suburb or town, which filled the middle space between the fort and the garden, full of wealthy industrious inhabitants, and it will be readily allowed that this insulated metropolis must have been the richest, most convenient and beautiful spot possessed in the present age by any native prince in India.\n\nAfter an examination of the defences, it was determined to attack the fortress on its northern face, and in case of necessity it seemed possible by repairing an old dam or embankment on the west to throw the water of the north branch of the river entirely into the other branch. The siege was pressed with vigour, and Tipu on his side was strenuously engaged night and day in strengthening the defences on the north side, and impeding the British operations by all the means in his power. But fortune was against him, and on the 23rd of February he was forced to agree to the terms proposed by Lord Cornwallis\u2014namely, the surrender of half his dominions, the payment of three crores and thirty lakhs of rupees, the release of all prisoners detained from the time of Haidar Ali, and the delivery of two of his sons as hostages.\n\nThe siege of 1799 was under the command of General Harris, directed by the Governor-General, Lord Mornington (afterwards\nMarquis Wellesley), who had come to Madras for the purpose. Since the former siege Tipu had greatly strengthened the fortifications. Double ramparts and double ditches were added to the northern and western faces, in addition to those on the eastern and southern faces, thus creating what was like a fortress within a fortress. Besides this, a new line of intrenchments was formed from the Daulat B\u00e2gh to the Periapatam bridge, within 600 or 700 yards of the fortress. How General Harris arrived before Seringapatam on the 5th of April, after defeating Tipu at Malavalli, and outwitting him in regard to his route, are described in the historical part of this work. The south-western angle was on this occasion chosen as the point of attack. In spite of Tipu\u2019s efforts to dislodge the enemy, especially by a vigorous sally on the 22nd led by his corps of Frenchmen, the works were steadily pushed on. And on the 26th a night attack, commanded by Colonel Wellesley, the future Duke of Wellington,\u00b9 and followed up the next day, drove the Mysoreans from the last intrenchment they occupied outside the fortress. The final assault of the 4th of May, the circumstances attending the death of the Sultan, and all the events that followed upon it have been related in the chapter on History.\n\nBy this victory Seringapatam became the property of the British Government, who leased the island to Mysore for a fixed sum of Rs. 50,000 a year. Buchanan says the streets in the fort were narrower and more confused than in any place he had seen since leaving Bengal. The generality of the houses were very mean, although many of the chiefs were well lodged after their fashion. Tipu allowed no person to possess property in houses there. He disposed of the dwellings as he thought fit, and on the slightest caprice changed the tenants. The fort was for several years occupied by British troops, and to provide greater space within the walls the inner ramparts were thrown down and the inner ditch was filled up in 1800. The course of this ditch may now be traced by the line of tamarind trees planted along it when it was closed up. Seringapatam began rapidly to decline after the close of the war, and its decay was proportionate with the rise of Mysore. The population of the island, estimated by Buchanan to have reached at least 150,000 during the reign of the Sultan, before the expiration of a year had sunk to 32,000. Fever also gradually made its appearance and necessitated the removal of the troops to Bangalore, where the new Cantonment was formed in 1809. Seringapatam is now notoriously\n\n\u00b9 An incident of this affair was that Colonel Wellesley got separated from his troops and mixed up with the enemy, whom he mistook for them, and entered the fort along with them before he discovered his mistake, when fortunately he made his escape.\nunhealthy for Europeans, and also for most natives; a severe attack of fever is generally the penalty of two or three nights spent in it or its vicinity. It is, however, strange that immediately after its occupation by the British, when the city is described by Buchanan as \"a sink of nastiness,\" it does not appear to have been insalubrious. The increase in paddy cultivation may partially account for this change of climate, but the natives generally attribute it to the destruction of the sweet flag, a plant which formerly grew in profusion on the banks of the river, and was supposed to possess febrifugal properties.\n\nThe population continued still further to decline and was only 12,744 in 1852, falling still lower to 10,594 in 1871. But in 1891 it was again 12,551, and the advent of the railway, with stations at the Fort and at Paschima-vahini, together with improvements introduced by Municipal administration, have in recent years given it a somewhat more prosperous aspect. The railway cuts through the western part of the fort. With this exception the fortifications themselves are comparatively uninjured. On these the results of the breaching batteries are far more apparent than the work of time, and the fort is still so formidable that a great military authority who visited it a quarter of a century ago pronounced it the second strongest in India.\n\nAlthough the fort is washed on its northern and western sides by the two branches of the river, and before the invention of rifled cannon had the advantage of not being commanded from any immediately adjacent height, it is to the ceaseless labour which must have been expended on it that it owes its great strength. The want of science which was apparent in long straight walls, square bastions, and glacis steep enough to shelter an assailant, was compensated for by deep ditches carried through solid granite, huge and massive walls, and lofty cavaliers.\n\nThe principal entrance was by what is known as the Elephant gate on the south side. This is not now used, the road being carried through a more convenient gateway made to the west of it. The Elephant gateway bears an inscription in Persian, stating that the foundation of the fort was laid in the year 1219 from the birth of Muhammad, that is of Tipu's Mauludi era, (1791 A.D.), when Jupiter was in the ascendant, Sagittarius and Libra were rising, Venus in twilight obscured by Jupiter, Mercury in conjunction with Virgo, Mars in Scorpio, the tail of the dragon in Pisces, and Saturn in Aries. The influence of these conjunctions was to show that the fort was fully equipped, and by the grace and mercy of God the Creator would remain permanent, free from all misfortune.\n\nAt the south-west angle of the fort may be viewed the breach made in 1799, the spot from which the storming party issued on the opposite\nside of the river being marked by two cannon fixed perpendicularly in the ground at the edge of the stream. Within the walls, surrounded by a high enclosure, are the remains of the Musalman palace, now converted into a sandal-wood store, but the greater part was demolished. A description of this palace has been given in Vol. I, as seen by Swartz in 1779, at p. 396, and as seen by Buchanan in 1800, at p. 520. Near the large temples of Sri Rangaswami, which is close by, are a few mud walls and a sunken granary, the relics of the ancient palace of the R\u00e1yals or viceroys of Seringapatam and of the Rajas of Mysore.\u00b9 The enclosure was for some years used as a gun-carriage factory. A large mosque erected by Tipu, with two tall minarets which are conspicuous from a great distance, is in front of the Mysore gate. The spot where Tipu fell is on the north face. Having been compelled to abandon the outer rampart, he attempted to escape into the inner fort through a narrow archway, but the crowd of fugitives from the British troops, who had already gained the interior, prevented this, and he was slain in an open space between the two walls. The archway in which he was wounded no longer exists. But a wooden door leading into a garden, about a hundred yards to the east of the sally-port, is pointed out as the spot where he was killed.\n\nDary\u00e1 Daulat B\u00e1gh.\u2014Just outside the fort, on the island, is the Dary\u00e1 Daulat B\u00e1gh or \u201cgarden of the wealth of the sea,\u201d a summer palace which was Tipu\u2019s favourite retreat from business. Its graceful proportions, and the arabesque work in rich colours with which it is covered, render it very attractive. Mr. Rees, who has travelled much in India and Persia, says \u201cThe lavish decorations which cover every inch of wall from first to last, from top to bottom, recall the palaces of Isfahan, and resemble nothing that I know in India.\u201d Part of the walls are adorned with pictures in a style of broad caricature, representing Colonel Baillie\u2019s defeat at Conjeveram in 1780, Haidar and Tipu\n\n\u00b9 Of this building, Wilks says, that the Sultan, in removing the Raja\u2019s family from it, had intended to destroy it altogether, and gave orders for that purpose, which were afterwards changed. It was reported to him that several large apartments were full of books, chiefly of palm-leaf and cuduttums, and he was asked how they were to be disposed of. \u201cTransfer them,\u201d says he, \u201cto the royal stables as fuel to boil the cooltee (grain on which horses are fed),\u201d and this was accordingly done. A small miscellaneous collection was preserved from this destruction by the pious artifice of a Brahmin, and in the confusion of the final siege fell into the hands of a British officer. Among the historical tracts which this collection contained was the record of a curious inquiry into the state of the family about the year 1716, for the purpose of ascertaining which of the branches had preserved the true blood of the house unpolluted by unworthy connections, when, out of thirty-one branches, thirteen were pronounced to be legitimate, and eighteen were excluded from the privilege of giving wives or successors to the reigning R\u00e1ja.\nas they appeared in public processions, and numerous figures of R\u00e1jas and p\u00e1l\u00e9g\u00e1rs. These representations had been defaced by Tipu prior to the siege, but after the capture of Seringapatam were restored by Colonel Wellesley, who occupied the palace for some time. They were again allowed to become partially obliterated until Lord Dalhousie, during his tour in Mysore, caused them to be repainted by a native artist who remembered them as they were. Although the pictures have therefore twice undergone restoration it is probable that they are faithful prototypes of the original. The perspective is very bad, and the general effect is grotesque, but the artist has succeeded well in caricaturing the expression and attitude of the British soldier, and the Frenchmen under Lally must have been taken from the life.\n\nL\u00e1l B\u00e1gh.\u2014At the eastern end of the island towards the south is the Gumbaz or mausoleum which was built by Tipu for his father and in which he also is buried, as well as his mother. It is a square building surmounted by a dome, with minarets at the angles, and surrounded by a corridor which is supported by pillars of black hornblende. The interior is painted in lacquer with the tiger stripe, adopted by Tipu for military uniforms. The double doors inlaid with ivory were renewed by Lord Dalhousie. Each of the tombs is covered with a handsome pall. The mausoleum is supported at Government expense. A tablet on the tomb of Tipu contains some verses, in which the following expressions,\u2014The light of Islam and the faith left this world; Tipu became a martyr for the faith of Muhammad; The sword was lost; The offspring of Haidar was a great martyr:\u2014by the process called Abjad give 1213, the date of his death according to the Muhammadan era of the Hejira. A short distance from the entrance to the Gumbaz is the tomb of Colonel Baillie, erected in 1816 by his nephew, Resident at the Court of Lucknow. Of Tipu\u2019s palace which stood in the L\u00e1l B\u00e1gh nothing now remains. Buchanan in 1800 says of it, \u201cThough built of mud, it possesses a considerable degree of elegance, and is the handsomest native building that I have ever seen.\u201d\n\nThe eastern portion of the island northwards is chiefly occupied by the suburb of Ganjam (see above, pp. 242 and 297). On rising ground called Sabbir\u00e1n\u00ed Tittu, to the south of the Daulat B\u00e1gh, is a small monument to officers who fell in the final siege. Farther west, on the bank of the river, is Scott\u2019s bungalow. He was the officer in charge of the gun-carriage factory, and the R\u00e1ja built this bungalow for him. In 1817 he lost his wife and children by a sudden death, which so affected him that he deserted the house and left the country. But the R\u00e1ja directed that the house should remain as it was, untouched. Such of the old furniture and fittings as have not fallen to pieces by decay,\ntherefore, still stand in the rooms, and the place is an object of melancholy interest to visitors.\n\nOn an elevated site opposite the north-west of the fort is Webbe's monument, erected by Purnaiya, and known as the rana-khambha or war pillar, from the fight that took place there in 1809 in connection with the short-lived mutiny of British officers in the Madras army (see Vol. I, p. 759).\u00b9\n\nThe island is watered from a canal, which is carried across the south branch of the river by an aqueduct constructed by Tipu. It rises a short distance above Seringapatam and irrigates the Darya Daulat B\u0101gh and the garden attached to Haidar's mausoleum, as well as some rich sugar-cane fields on the island. Over the aqueduct is a bridge. The bridge across the northern branch was constructed by Purnaiya in 1804, and named the Wellesley Bridge in honour of the then Governor-General of India. It is an interesting specimen of native architecture. To the north-west of the fort may be seen the remains of a dam or bridge erected in the time of the viceroys of Vijayanagar.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-93. | 1893-94. | 1894-95. | 1895-96. |\n|-----------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|\n| Income          | ...      | 10,366   | 10,517   | 11,488   | 15,298   |\n| Expenditure     | ...      | 11,147   | 9,455    | 9,431    | 10,792   |\n\nShimsha or Shimshupa, also called the Kadaba or Kadamba, and the Maddur Hol\u00e9\u2014a tributary of the K\u0101v\u0113ri. It rises to the south of D\u00e9var\u0101yadurga in Tumkur District, and flowing southwards through that District enters the Mysore District in the north-east of Mandya taluq. Pursuing a south-east course, it runs through Malavalli taluq and enters the K\u0101v\u0113ri a few miles below the Falls at Sivasamudram. About nine miles north of Maddur is an anicut, rebuilt some years ago by the Public Works Department, of cut stone. From this dam is drawn the Maddur Ane channel on the right bank, which is 12 miles in length, and feeding the large Maddur tank, branches into four small channels, the Chamenhalli (2\u00bd miles), Bairan (2 miles), Vaidyan\u0101thp\u016br (3\u00bc miles) and Kemman (5\u00bd miles). Much mulberry is cultivated under these channels for the support of silkworms. The area irrigated from the channels is 3,000 acres, yielding a revenue of Rs. 18,889. The river is spanned near Maddur by a fine brick bridge of seven arches, constructed in 1850 for the Bangalore-Mysore road, and now used also for the Mysore State Railway.\n\n\u00b9 The details will be found in Colonel Malleson's monograph Seringapatam, Past and Present.\nThe valley of the Shimsha, under the Ganga kings, formed the province of Chikka Gangav\u00e1di, with its chief town at Honganur (Channapatna taluq).\n\n**Sivasamudram.**\u2014Though over the present boundary line of Mysore, this romantic spot is intimately associated with that country. It is on the south border of the Malavalli taluq, connected with the Railway and Bangalore-Seringapatam trunk road by a cross road from Maddur through Malavalli, 30 miles in length. The K\u00e1v\u00e9ri here branches into two streams, each of which makes a descent of about 200 feet, in a succession of picturesque rapids and waterfalls. The principal island embraced within these torrents, called Heggura, but more generally known by the name of Sivasamudram or Sivanasamudram (sea of Siva),\u2014the ancient city, of which a few vestiges are strewed around,\u2014is about 3 miles long by \u00be of a mile broad.\n\nOf its former history little is known; but the modern city appears to have been founded at the beginning of the 16th century by Ganga R\u00e1ja, a representative probably of the Ganga kings, whose sovereignty in Orissa then came to an end. An inscription of 1604 records a grant to the temple by the chief of Hadin\u00e1d. Through precisely the same mistake that occurred in the foundation of Chik Ballapur (Kolar District), the work was commenced before the appointed signal announced the lucky moment, and was therefore doomed to continue for only three generations. Ganga R\u00e1ja, after a prosperous reign, was succeeded by his son Nandi R\u00e1ja, who, to atone for a ceremonial offence, leaped into the cataract at Gagana Chukki on horseback with his wife. His son Ganga R\u00e1ja the second enlarged the city greatly, and lived with much splendour. He had two daughters, whom he gave in marriage to the two chief P\u00e1l\u00e9gars in the neighbourhood. The one was married to the R\u00e1ja of Kilimale, a place now in ruins, about 12 miles from Satyagala. The other daughter was married to the R\u00e1ja of Nagarakere, 3 miles east from Maddur. These marriages were very unhappy; for the pride of the ladies gave their husbands constant disgust. They were continually upbraided for not living in equal splendour with their father-in-law; and at length, having consulted together, they determined to humble their wives, by showing that their power was superior to that of Ganga R\u00e1ja. Having assembled all their forces, they besieged Sivasamudra; but for a time had very little success.\n\nThe siege had continued twelve years without their having been able to penetrate into the island, when the two R\u00e1jas found means to corrupt the Dalav\u00e1yi or minister of Ganga R\u00e1ja. This traitor removed the guards from the only ford, and thus permitted the enemy to surprise the place, while he endeavoured to engage his master's attention at the game\nof chess. The shouts of the soldiery at length reaching their ears, the prince started up from the game. The Dalav\u00e1yi, who wished him to fall alive into the hands of his sons-in-law, endeavoured to persuade him that the noise arose merely from children at play, but the Raja, having drawn his sword, first killed all his women and children, and then, rushing into the midst of his enemies, fought until he procured an honourable death. The sons-in-law on seeing this were struck with horror, and immediately threw themselves into the cataract at Gagana Chukki; and their example was followed by their wives, whose arrogance had been the cause of such disasters.\n\nJagadeva R\u00e1yal of Channapatna, and Sri Ranga Raja of Talakad, the two most powerful of the neighbouring chiefs, then came, and removed all the people and wealth of the place. During the British march upon Seringapatam in 1791, Tipu Sultan, having destroyed every means of forage between Bangalore and the capital, drove all the inhabitants and cattle into the island of Sivasamudram, presenting a silent and desolate country to the advance of the army of Lord Cornwallis.\n\nThe island was overgrown with dense jungle, and the old bridges which connected it with the mainland on both sides had become impassable when in 1818 their repair was undertaken by Ramaswami Mudaliyar, a confidential servant of the Resident of Mysore. He expended several thousand pounds on the work and was rewarded by the British Government with the title of Jan\u00f3pak\u00e1ra K\u00e1makarta or public benefactor. At the same time he was invested with a j\u00e1gir composed of five villages from the British Government, yielding a revenue of Rs. 8,000 a year, and seven villages from the Mysore State, yielding Rs. 9,000 a year. The bridges are built of hewn stone pillars, connected by stone girders founded on the rocky bed of the stream, and though rude are good specimens of native construction. A bungalow was erected by the J\u00e1girdar, near the road connecting the two bridges, for the accommodation of European visitors.\u00b9\n\nGagana Chukki.\u2014On the western branch of the river, which forms the boundary between Mysore and Coimbatore, are the Gagana Chukki or Gangana Chukki falls, about two miles from the bungalow. The approach is by a steep path leading down from the tomb of Pir Ghaib, a Musalman saint. The stream here dividing so as to form a small island called Ettikur,\u00b2 the parted waters dash with deafening roar over vast boulders of rock in a cloud of foam to unite again in the deep pool below, and with such violence that the column of vapour is at times\n\n\u00b9 He published an account of the place, with maps, in the Madras Journal, I, 83.\n\u00b2 Nellagana-tittu in Buchanan.\nvisible from Satyagala. \"I have never,\" says Buchanan, \"seen any cataract that for grandeur could be compared with this.\"\n\nBar Chukki.\u2014Grand and impressive as is the headlong turmoil of the waters in Gagana Chukki, the other falls, about a mile distant on the eastern branch of the river, being more easily viewed are generally more enjoyed. These are called the Bhar or Bar Chukki, and display a great volume of water, which in the rainy season pours over the hillside in an unbroken sheet a quarter of a mile broad. During the dry months it separates into several distinct falls of great beauty. In the centre is a deep recess in the form of a horse shoe, down which the principal stream falls, and having been collected into a narrow channel, rushes forward with prodigious violence and again falls, about 30 feet, into a capacious basin at the foot of the precipice. Hurrying on northwards, through wild and narrow gorges, the two streams unite again on the north-east of the island and continue their course to the east.\n\nThe most favourable time for visiting these Falls is during the rainy season, as in the winter months the island is excessively feverish.\n\nSomnathpur.\u2014An insignificant village on the left bank of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the Tirumakudlu Narsipur taluq, 5 miles north of S\u00f3sile, noted for the temple of Prasanna Chenna K\u00e9sava. This elaborately carved structure is attributed to Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri, the famous sculptor and architect of the Hoysala kings, under whom Hindu art in Mysore reached its culmination. Though not on the scale of the unfinished temple at Halebid (Hassan District), the general effect is more pleasing, from the completion of the superstructure, consisting of three pyramidal towers or vim\u00e1na surmounting the triple shrine; Prasanna Chenna Kesava occupying the central chapel, Gop\u00e1la the one to the south, and Jan\u00e1rdana the one to the north. Round the exterior base are portrayed consecutively, with considerable spirit, the leading incidents in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata and Bh\u00e1gavata, carved in potstone, the termination of each chapter and section being indicated respectively by a closed or half-closed door. The number of separate sculptured images erected upon and around the basement, whose mutilated remains are shown around, was no less than 74.\n\nThe building, according to a fine inscription at the entrance, was completed in 1269, by S\u00f3ma, a member of the royal family and a high officer under the Hoysala king Narasimha III., who also founded the city which formerly surrounded it. Later grants were made by Ball\u00e1la III. The vestibule is in ruins, and the images generally much\n\n1 Journ. I, 407. He had not, however, seen the falls of Gersoppa (Shimoga District).\ndamaged.

It was the head-quarters of the Talak\u00e1d taluq until 1868, when the kasba was established at Tirumakudlu Narsipur, 10 miles to the north-west, as being more central and accessible, and in 1882 the name of the taluq was changed to the latter. Population, 3,273.\n\nThe origin of the town is lost in antiquity; but one tradition is that its name was derived from two Kir\u00e1\u1e6da brothers, Tala and K\u00e1\u1e0du, who, cutting down a tree which they saw wild elephants worshipping, discovered that it contained an image of Vishnu, and that the elephants were rishis transformed. The tree being miraculously restored, all obtained moksha and the place was named Tala-k\u00e1\u1e0du, which was translated into Sanskrit as Dala-vana. Two stone images declared to represent the brothers are pointed out in front of the temple of Vedesvara. In a later age Rama is said to have halted here on his expedition to Lanka.\n\nThe earliest authentic notice of the city of Talek\u00e1d or Talak\u00e1d, in Sanskrit Dalavana-pura, is in connection with the Ganga line of kings.\nHarivarma, ruling 247\u2013266, was, according to an old chronicle, installed at Skandapura (said to be Gajalha\u1e6d\u1e6di, in the Coimbatore country, near where the Moy\u0101r flows into the Bhav\u0101ni), but resided in the great city of Dalavanapura in the Karn\u0101\u1e6da desa. Thenceforward Talak\u0101\u1e0d became the capital of these powerful sovereigns, and there the subsequent kings of that line were crowned.\n\nAt the beginning of the 11th century the Gangas succumbed to the Cholas, who captured Talak\u0101\u1e0d and gave it the name of R\u0101jarajapura. But about a hundred years later it was taken by the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, who drove the Cholas out of Mysore. After this time we find that Talak\u0101\u1e0d was composed of seven towns and five ma\u1e6dhas or monastic establishments. The town of M\u00e1yilangi or M\u00e1lingi, on the opposite side of the river, was also a large place, and had the name of Jana\u1e47\u0101\u1e6dhapura. Down to the middle of the 14th century it remained a possession of the Hoysalas, and then passed into the hands of a feudatory of the Vijayanagar sovereigns, whose line appears to be known as that of Soma Raja.\n\nIn 1634 it was conquered by the Mysore Raja under the following circumstances. Tirumala Raja, sometimes called Sri Ranga R\u00e1yal, the representative of the Vijayanagar family at Seringapatam, being afflicted with an incurable disease, came to Talak\u0101\u1e0d for the purpose of offering sacrifices in the temple of V\u00e9d\u00e9\u015bvara. His wife Rangamma was left in charge of the government of Seringapatam; but she, hearing that her husband was on the point of death, soon after left for Talak\u0101\u1e0d with the object of seeing him before he died, handing over Seringapatam and its dependencies to R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore, whose dynasty ever afterwards retained them. It appears that R\u00e1ja Wodeyar had been desirous of possessing a costly nose-jewel which was the property of the R\u00e1ni, and being unable to obtain possession of it by stratagem, and eager to seize any pretext for acquiring fresh territory, he levied an army and proceeded against Talak\u0101\u1e0d, which he took by escalade; the R\u00e1ja of the latter place falling in the action. The R\u00e1ni Rangamma thereupon went to the banks of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, and throwing in the jewel, drowned herself opposite M\u00e1lingi, at the same time uttering the three-fold curse,\u2014\u201cLet Talak\u0101\u1e0d become sand; let M\u00e1lingi become a whirlpool; let the Mysore R\u00e1jas fail to beget heirs.\u201d\u00b9 The latter part is now happily of no effect.\n\nThe old city of Talak\u0101\u1e0d is completely buried beneath hills of sand\n\n\u00b9 The following is what is known as the curse of Talak\u0101\u1e0d, in the original:\u2014\n\nTalak\u0101\u1e0du maral \u00e1gali.\nM\u00e1lingi maduv \u00e1gali.\nMais\u012bru dhoregalu makkal illade h\u00f3gali.\nstretching for nearly a mile in length, only the tops of two pagodas being visible. The sand hills used to advance upon the town at the rate of 9 or 10 feet a year, principally during the south-west monsoon, and as they press it close on three sides, the inhabitants were constantly forced to abandon their houses and retreat further inland. The town, however, is increasing in population, owing to the rich wet cultivation in the neighbourhood, derived from the M\u00e1dhava-mantri anicut and channel. More than thirty temples, it is stated, are beneath the sand. That of Kirti N\u00e1r\u00e1yana is occasionally opened with great labour sufficiently to allow of access for certain ceremonies. The most imposing temple left uncovered by the sand is that of Vedesvara.\n\nSteps have in recent years been taken (as suggested in the former edition of this work) to check the formation and advance of the sand-dunes, by planting suitable binding plants to prevent the sand lifting, and groves of trees, especially casuarinas, which grow so well in sand, in order to stop its drifting with the wind. These measures have been attended with a good deal of success. But without the directions of Government the people would do nothing, professing to look upon the phenomenon as the result of the curse before mentioned, and deeming it useless to fight against fate.\n\nTerakanambi.\u2014A town in Gundlupet taluq, on the Gundlupet-Chamrajnagar road, 7 miles east of the kasba. Head-quarters of the h\u00f3bli of the same name. Population 2,178.\n\nA fair is held every Thursday, attended by 3,500 people.\n\nThe town is evidently of great antiquity, though its early history is somewhat obscure. There is a general agreement that its name was formerly Trikadamba-pura, and that it sprung out of a village called K\u00fadugall\u00far, standing where the k\u00eddu-gallu or boundary stones united of three great countries\u2014namely, Dravida, Kerala, and Hadin\u00e1d or south-Karn\u00e1ta. On the point of junction a temple to Trikadamba, the consort of the three-eyed Siva, was erected in the 6th century, by a king named Lamba Karna R\u00e1ya (the long-eared king) ruling the southern part of Karn\u00e1ta; and hence the name of the town. This king, again, is stated to have belonged to the Kadamba line, and to be the same as Trinetra Kadamba, who would correspond with May\u00fara-varma. Should this be true, it may be conjectured that the temple of Trikadamba marked the common boundary of the Ganga, Kerala, and Kadamba territories. Inscriptions show that Bayaln\u00e1d (the Heggada-devankote taluq) was being ruled by chiefs of Kadamba descent until subdued by the Hoysalas.\n\nThe traditional list of rulers at Terakan\u00e1mbi, among whom occurs a Mandava R\u00e1ya, king of Sivasamudra, throws little light upon its history\nuntil the time of the Hoysalas, who in turn were succeeded by the Vijayanagar dynasty. Harihara of that line appears to have added to the city. In the 16th century the chief of Ummattur held it for a short time, and then a number of freebooters of Telugu origin ravaged the country for some years, until R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore took possession of it in 1624, after which period it became secondary in importance to Gundlupet. Under the Musalman dynasty Terakan\u00e1mbi was the head-quarters of a taluq, which was further sub-divided into Avval Terakan\u00e1mbi and Duyam Terakan\u00e1mbi, but Purnaiya merged these in the Gundlupet taluq.\n\nThe fort of Terakan\u00e1mbi was finally destroyed by the Mahrattas in 1747. Remains of five lines of fortification are still to be seen, and the site of the old palace is also pointed out, which, according to local tradition, was six storeys high. There are twelve temples in Terakan\u00e1mbi of large dimensions, but ruinous. Several of them contain inscriptions. The principal shrine is dedicated to Lakshmi Varadar\u00e1jaswami, whose effigy was removed to Mysore by Krishna R\u00e1ja III. These temples, as in most other parts of the District, are chiefly built of huge blocks of stone fitted to each other with great nicety, but their carving is not generally noteworthy. It appears as if the science of an inferior age to that in which they were founded had been brought to bear upon repairing them, so greatly inferior are some portions of them to others; an allowance of a few rupees is still devoted to keeping up most of them. In the neighbourhood of Terakan\u00e1mbi are numerous old tanks, now disused, but indicating the former importance of the place.\n\n**Tirumakudlu Narsipur.**\u2014A taluq in the east, till 1882 called Talak\u00e1d.

The Kabbani also enters the taluq from the west and forms a junction with the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, but is not here utilized for agricultural purposes. The course of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, on the other hand, may be traced by an almost unintermitting border of wet cultivation on each bank. The anicuts and canals are elsewhere described. In its course through this taluq the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri takes the nature of a wide and shallow river with a sandy bed, and is fordable at several places except during a fresh. Along its banks and in the lowlands black soil predominates, and here good crops are obtained; but in the uplands, especially in the west of the taluq, the soil is very poor and does not repay cultivation without constant manuring. Hain is the almost universal season for crop on both wet and dry lands: the only standard k\u00edr crop being j\u00f3la, which is grown largely, principally on the black soil, the rich nature of which allows of the cultivation of cotton, wheat, or coriander seed as a hain crop during the same year.\n\nWith the exception of a little under 35 rain-fed tanks, all the wet land is dependent on the channels from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. Hardly any bhara bhatta rice is grown. There are, however, several old tanks, most of which were breeched or fell out of repair during the Musalman rule. There is no jungle, and but little land is waste. There are extensive inam lands in this taluq; lands aggregating Rs. 10,205 annually are in the possession of relations and connections of the former Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja; and others yielding Rs. 13,000 were granted by that prince to Brahmans of his court. A few isolated rocky hills are found, the highest of which is Kund\u00far Be\u1e6d\u1e6da on the frontier of Malavalli. The remainder of the taluq is level cultivated land.\n\nThe total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,49,862, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,69,266.\nThe average rainfall at Tirumakudlu Narsipur for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b061 | 2\u00b044 | 5\u00b064  | 1\u00b092| 1\u00b023 | 2\u00b099 | 4\u00b035 | 6\u00b078  | 2\u00b000 | 1\u00b004 | ...  | 29\u00b002|\n\nAccording to another record for the same period, the annual average is 25\u00b087.\n\nThere are roads from Tirumakudlu Narsipur north-west to Mysore, north to Bannur and Seringapatam, and south-east to Talakad and Holesal. In each case the river has to be forded, as there are no bridges. There are also roads from Tirumakudlu Narsipur west to the railway at Nanjangud, and south to Mugur and Santemarahalli. Another road runs east from Sosile to Sivasamudram and the Kaveri Falls, with a branch to Talakad.\n\n**Tirumakudlu Narsipur.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 13' N. lat., 76\u00b0 58' E. long., at the junction of the Kabbani with the Kaveri, 20 miles south-east of Mysore, and 18 from the railway at Nanjangud. Headquarters, since 1868, of the taluq of the same name, which, till 1882, was called the Talakad taluq.

The above is the population of Narsipur; that of Tirumakudlu is 679. This spot has always been considered specially sacred, and possesses two temples\u2014one to Gunja Narasimha, which was repaired and embellished by the Dalavayi of Mysore about 320 years ago, and is supported by an annual allowance of Rs. 958; and a second, situated at Tiruma-kudalu (the most holy union), and dedicated to Agastyesvara, which receives annually Rs. 1,822, and has existed from time immemorial. The town of Narsipur is in no way noteworthy. Close to it on the south is Hosa Alagod, with a population of 1,667.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income          | 466     | 573     | 447     | 843     |\n| Expenditure     | 624     | 1,033   | 681     | 1,359   |\nTonnur.\u2014Properly Tondan\u016br, a village in the Seringapatam taluq, 10 miles north-west of Seringapatam. Population 546.\n\nIt is historically interesting as having been the refuge of the last of the Hoysala kings after the destruction of Dorasamudra by the Muhammadans in 1326. Here also is the splendid tank called the Moti Talab, lake of pearls (q.v.). There is a Musalman tomb close by, to Shah Salar Masaud Ghazi, bearing the date 760 Hijiri, or 1358.\n\nUmmattur.\u2014A village in Ch\u0101mr\u0101j\u00f1agar taluq, on the Nanjangud-Yelandur road, 10 miles north of the kasba. Head-quarters of the h\u014dbli of the same name. Population 1,827.\n\nUmmattur was formerly an important principality under the Vijayanagar kings. The R\u0101ja was related to the Sri Ranga R\u0101yal, or viceroy at Seringapatam, and to him Tirumala R\u0101ja, the last of the viceroys, seems to have formed the purpose of resigning his power, though compelled by circumstances to abdicate in favour of R\u0101ja Wodeyar of Mysore. Between the Mysore R\u0101jas and the Ummattur R\u0101jas there was naturally a strong feeling of enmity. This was shared by the house of Kalale, which the Ummattur chief had on one occasion nearly exterminated by a treacherous massacre of all its members, when one infant escaped. The latter grew up to restore the fortunes of his line, and a common interest, no less than relationship, formed the bond of union by which the Kalale chiefs became the Dalav\u0101yis of the Mysore State. In 1613 Ummattur was subdued by R\u0101ja Wodeyar and annexed to Mysore. It is now an in\u00e1m village, one of the endowments of the Ch\u0101mr\u0101jesvara temple at Ch\u0101mr\u0101j\u00f1agar.\n\nVaruna.\u2014A village in Varakod h\u014dbli, Mysore taluq, a few miles south-west of Mysore. Population 520.\n\nIt is evidently, from the remains there, a place of great antiquity. There is a Ganga inscription of the 8th century. In the 10th century the place was in the possession of a chief named Goggi, who was of the Chalukya family. It was perhaps his daughter who became the wife of Bhillama, one of the Y\u0101dava kings of Devagiri, earlier than the one mentioned in Vol. I, p. 342. In 1828 the queen Dev\u0101jammani of the Lakshmi-vil\u0101sa had a temple erected here, made a tank and a tope, and granted endowments.\n\n1 The Wodeyars of Ummatt\u016br undoubtedly for a long period exercised rule over the Nilagiris, and in their adversity found a refuge here, and for a time perhaps preserved their partial independence in the Malekota fort near Kalhatti. Near Malekota there are still living Bedar whose ancestors were in the service of the Ummattur R\u0101ja as tax-gatherers, and hence are still cordially hated by the Badagas, who, on the other hand, still call the Mysore Rajas their Kartas or lords.\u2014Grigg's Manual of the Nilagiri District, pp. 268, 269.\n\n2 See Fleet's Kan Dyn., new edition, p. 514.\nYedatore.\u2014A taluq in the north-west.

The K\u00e1v\u00e9ri flows through the taluq from west to east, forming, in the latter direction, part of the northern boundary, where it receives the Hemavati from the north. The Lakshmantirtha runs along the eastern boundary to its confluence with the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. The great feature of the taluq is, therefore, the river channels drawn from the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, running for over 100 miles. The principal anicut on the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri is at Chun-chankatte, from which two channels are taken, one to the north of the river, and the other to the south. Of the former, the Saligram series are 24 miles long and irrigate 2,884 acres, yielding a revenue of Rs. 18,361. The Mirle series are 38 miles long, irrigate 3,110 acres, and realize Rs. 20,811. The Ramasamudram channel is 41 miles long, irrigates 4,300 acres, and brings in Rs. 25,809. The Tippur channel is taken from an anicut near Adagur. It is 22 miles long, irrigates 590 acres, and the revenue is Rs. 4,089. There is also an anicut on the Lakshmantirtha, near Malhalli, from which there is a channel on the north bank, irrigating 245 acres. There are about 140 tanks, of which 10 may be termed large, and that at Galagekere is fed by the river channel.\nThe country is gently undulating in character, there being neither hills nor jungle. Low scrub is met with in many places on the high grounds, and occasionally date topes in the valleys. The soils are not of a very high order, and may be described as fair average red and sandy, and of rather varying quality, under the channels especially. That under the Saligram, Mirle and Tippur channels is the best. R\u00e1gi is the principal dry crop, sown in the early rains; oil-seeds, pulses and jola are also grown. Tobacco is cultivated in Byadarhalli. Only one crop of rice is raised in the year, the kinds chiefly grown being kembhatta, kaddibhatta and bolamallige. Sugar-cane has been given up, though grown to some extent formerly. The areca gardens suffered much from the famine, and the higher price of rice led to its substitution for areca in many parts. The other garden crops are plantain, betel-leaf, sweet potatoes, and various vegetables.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into Hanasoge in 1884, and into the remainder of the taluq in 1885. The area of the taluq in the latter survey was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 73,107; wet, 10,631; garden, 1,816) | ... | 85,554 |\n| Unculturable (including village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | ... | 27,565 |\n| In\u00e1m villages (12,891); k\u00e1v\u00e1ls (4,671) | ... | ... | ... | 17,562 |\n| **Total area** | ... | **130,681** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 5,574 acres, of which only 31 were wet or garden land. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,21,676, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,12,443.\n\nThe average rainfall for 26 years (1870\u201395) at Yedatore was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0\u00b739 | 2\u00b708 | 5\u00b775 | 1\u00b798 | 1\u00b787 | 2\u00b747 | 2\u00b796 | 6\u00b740 | 2\u00b748 | 0\u00b765 | ... | 27\u00b703 |\n\nThe Mysore-Hassan road runs through the east of the taluq from south to north westwards, crossing the river at Tippur, where there is as yet no bridge. From this road one branch runs west from S\u00e1garkatte to Yedatore and onwards on the south side of the river, and another west from Hampapura to Saligram and farther on the north side. There is a cross road connecting Bherya and Saligram, and an unfinished road from Yedatore south to Hunsur.\n\n**Yedatore.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 28\u2032 N. lat., 75\u00b0 27\u2032 E. long., on the right bank of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, 22 miles north-west of Mysore. Headquarters of the Yedatore taluq, and a municipality. It is reached by a cross road from the Mysore-Hassan road, 8 miles north-west of Yelwal.\nA fair is held on Friday, attended by 250 people.\n\nThe town derives its name from the bend to the left (ye\u1e0da) made by the river (tor\u0113) at this point, which invests it with peculiar sanctity. It was one of the places conquered by R\u0101jendra Chola after his overthrow of the Gangas in the 11th century.

Along the eastern side\n\n\u00b9 The whole J\u0101gir is sarvam\u0101nyam with reference to the Mysore Government. The classification is that which is local to the J\u0101gir.\nare situated the Biligirirangan hills, running (within the J\u00e1gir) for about 10 miles north and south. The peak after which they are named rises to 4,195 feet above the sea. Teak, sandal, honne, matti and other valuable trees are found on their slopes. The only inhabitants of the range are the Soligas, who are permitted to cultivate free, within prescribed limits, in their own desultory and shifting mode, in return for which they guard the forest on the hills and render service in the temple on the summit on festive occasions.\n\nThe remainder of the J\u00e1gir, north-west of these hills and quite distinct from them, is one compact level stretch of land, traversed from south to north by the Honnu-hol\u00e9 or Suvarnavati, which is the sole source of irrigation. It possesses one anicut (at Ganaganur) and six channels and feeds the Agara tank, the water in which is practically unfailing. The level surface of the country, and the very slight rise of the river banks render dams unnecessary, for as soon as the river becomes at all full its water flows naturally into the channels. When the river water runs very low temporary dams are constructed, as in Chamrajnagar taluq, of stakes; mats, sand, &c. But it is proposed to construct a permanent dam higher up the stream that will insure a permanent supply to the other large tanks, such as the Ambale, Yelandur, Yeriyur and Maddur. There are no rain-fed tanks worthy of mention, but some small ones near the Biligirirangans draw their water-supply from the hill streams.\n\nThe wealth of the J\u00e1gir is mainly due to the extraordinary fertility of the soil, which, except near the foot of the hills, is mostly a good black, free from the defects ordinarily found in it elsewhere. In the east, near the hills, the soil is red and sandy, but not poor. The garden crops are chiefly betel-leaf, areca, cocoa-nut and mulberry. The latter, indeed, is grown in all descriptions of land, garden, wet and dry. Sugar-cane is raised under the larger tanks and rice alone under the smaller ones. The staple dry crop is jola; togari and Bengal gram are also grown, but no cotton, though the soils are favourable for that crop. R\u00e1gi is not much cultivated.\n\nSilk is produced in large quantities, and piece goods are also manufactured. Brass is made into lamps and vessels at Yeragamballi. The principal markets resorted to are at Santemarahalli (Chamrajnagar taluq) and Kollegal (Coimbatore district).\n\nThere are inscriptions in the J\u00e1gir of the Ganga and Chola kings, and many of the time of the Hoysala kings. From the latter we learn that Yelandur was included in the Padin\u00e1d province. This was also the case during the Vijayanagar period, towards the close of which the name gradually changes to the modern form of Hadin\u00e1d, now\nrepresented by Hadin\u00e1ru (Nanjangud taluq). The kings of Padin\u00e1\u1e0d or the Ten N\u00e1ds (Padin\u00e1\u1e0dugalam) specially mentioned in connection with Yelandur are Singe-Depa; his son Rama, ruling in 1568; his younger brother Chenna; Tirumala R\u00e1ja and Nanja R\u00e1ja, the sons of the latter; Mudda R\u00e1ja, son of Tirumala, ruling in 1654. It was subsequently absorbed into the Mysore territory.\n\nIn 1807 Yelandur was given in j\u00e1gir by the British Government to Purnaiya in recognition of his services as Divan and Regent during the minority of the R\u00e1ja. The sanad, countersigned by Sir John Malcolm, is drawn up in terms of high eulogy and appreciation of the great and faithful services rendered by the recipient. That sagacious minister, on being offered his choice of lands, is said to have chosen Yelandur; firstly, because it contained a never-failing supply of water; and, secondly, because it was (at that time) out of the beaten track of Government officials and travellers without being at too great a distance from the capital. But as he belonged to a Coimbatore family it seems more likely that, apart from the obvious natural advantages of the place, he chose it as being on the borders of Coimbatore and Mysore. The present J\u00e1gird\u00e1r is the great-grandson of Purnaiya.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1896. The area of the J\u00e1gir was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 16,135; wet, 5,374; garden, 704) | ... | ... | 22,213 |\n| Unculturable (roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 12,504 |\n| Inam (principally Biligiri Rangaswami betta) | ... | ... | 30,341 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **65,058** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was only 432 acres, of which 394 was dry crop land.\n\nThe average annual rainfall is about 25 inches.\n\nThere is a road from Kaulandi on the Nanjangud road, through Santemarahalli, which enters the J\u00e1gir on the west and passes through Yelandur and all the most populous parts, on north to Kollegal. This part of the road is through sticky black soil and is in bad order. There is also a road from Yelandur to the foot of the Ghats westward.\n\n**Yelandur.**\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 13' N. lat., 77\u00b0 5' E. long., on the Honnu-hol\u00e9. The kasba of the Yelandur J\u00e1gir, and connected by road with the railway at Nanjangud, which is 26 miles distant, and thus with Mysore, 42 miles. Population 3,566.\n\nYelandur was from early times included in Padin\u00e1\u1e0d or Hadin\u00e1\u1e0d (corresponding perhaps with the ancient Punn\u00e1\u1e0d Ten Thousand) and was the seat of a wealthy principality at the time of the Vijayanagar\nsovereignty. The principal temple, that of Gaurisvara, was built by Singe-Depa, king of Padin\u0101\u1e0d, in about 1450, and later kings of Padin\u0101\u1e0d, or the Ten N\u0101\u1e0d country, granted endowments for it. The last R\u00e1ja entered into alliance with the Mysore and Kalale chiefs, giving his daughter in marriage to one of the latter. A Jain named Vish\u00e1-l\u00e1ksha Pandita, known as the Yelandur pandit, was the faithful adherent of Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja during his captivity at Hangala, and on his accession to the throne in 1672 became his first minister. The celebrated Ling\u00e1yit poet Sha\u1e0dakshara Deva, who wrote the popular R\u00e1jasekhara Vil\u00e1sa in 1657, was a member of the Danagur ma\u1e6dha near Yelandur.\n\nThe town is a thriving place, and many of the inhabitants are well to do. It contains a substantially built house of the J\u00e1girdar. The portico of the Gaurisvara temple is a good specimen of the carving of the period. The inscription at the temple explains the name of the place as Eleyind\u00far, the town of the young moon; and compares the town to the eye or centre of a lotus, surrounded by eight petals, which are eight hills in the surrounding country\u2014Svetasila (that is Biligiri) on the east, the Mallin\u00e1tha hill near K\u00e1r\u00e1pur on the south-east, the Suragi hill on the south, the Sankaresvara hill on the south-west, the Mallik\u00e1rjuna hill near Jann\u00far on the west, the Sambhulinga hill on the north-west, Srisaila on the north, and the Nirmala hill on the north-east.\nHASSAN DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014A District in the west; situated between 12\u00b0 30' and 13\u00b0 36' north latitude, and between 75\u00b0 3' and 76\u00b0 42' east longitude. The greatest length is from north to south, about 75 miles; and the greatest breadth is from west to east, about 68.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 2,641 square miles; of which 1,037\u00bd square miles are under cultivation.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by Kadur District; east by Tumkur and Mysore Districts; south by Coorg; and west by South Kanara, belonging to the Madras Presidency.\n\nDivisions.\u2014It is subdivided into the following seven taluqs. Alur is a sub-taluq under Hassan taluq. Arsikere is the old Harnhalli taluq.\n\n| No. | Taluq          | Area of Sq. Miles | No. of Hoblis | No. of Villages or Towns | Population in 1891 | Per Sq.

The only exceptions are certain outlying tracts along the west border\u2014namely, the western portion of the Manjarabad taluq, which drains to the Netravati in South Kanara; and the Arsikere taluq, whose waters run north to the Vedavati in Chitaldroog. The Kaveri flows through a small portion of the south.\n\nThe course of the Hemavati in the District is at first south and then east. Running from north to south of Manjarabad taluq, it turns east along the Mysore and Coorg frontier, and continuing in the same direction, separates Hassan and Arkalgud taluqs, and passing through-\nout Hole Narsipur taluq, leaves the District with a southerly course and falls into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the Mysore District. Its chief tributary is the Yagachi from the Bel\u00far taluq, which joins it near Gorur, in Hassan taluq.\n\nThe Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d side of the District, resting on the brow of the Western Ghats, forms a part of the Male-s\u00edme or Maln\u00e1d, hill country; the remainder being Maid\u00e1n or Bail-s\u00edme, plain country, also called M\u00fadu-s\u00edme or east country.\n\nThe mountains forming the western limit extend from the pass at the Bisale gh\u00e1t to J\u00e9nkal-b\u00e9\u1e6d\u1e6da, including within a grand panorama the towering height of Subrahmanya or Pushpagiri, close to the south-west border, rising to 5,626 feet above the level of the sea; Devar-b\u00e9\u1e6d\u1e6da, (4,206 feet), M\u00farkan gudda (4,265 feet),\u00b9 and the superb J\u00e9nkal-b\u00e9\u1e6d\u1e6da (4,558 feet).\u00b2 Besides the mountains in Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d, there are low ranges of granitic hills running along the northern limits of the District through the Bel\u00far, Hassan and Arsikere taluqs, marking the watershed which separates the Krishna and K\u00e1v\u00e9ri river systems. The Indra-b\u00e9\u1e6d\u1e6da at Sravana-Belgola (3,309 feet) is noted for the colossal Jain statue on its summit. Some low hills pass through Hole Narsipur taluq towards Hassan and Channar\u00e1yapatna.\n\nThe general level of the country slopes with the course of the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati, from the Ghat ranges towards the bed of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri in the south-east. At Bel\u00far the height above sea level is 3,150 feet, at Hassan 3,084, at Sakleshpur 2,998; while at Channar\u00e1yapatna it is 2,771, and at Arsikere 2,666.\n\nThe Maln\u00e1d or highland region, occupying the whole of the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d taluq and the western half of Bel\u00far, has been thus graphically described by Major Montgomery, a former Superintendent. \"The character of the country is generally undulating till on approaching the Ghats, when it becomes precipitous. Perhaps there is no scenery in India more beautiful than the southern part of this tract, adjoining the north-west of Coorg. It for the most part resembles the richest park scenery in England. Hills covered with the finest grass or equally verdant crops of dry grain, adorned and crowned with clumps of noble forest trees, in some instances apparently planted most carefully, and certainly with perfect taste. The highest and the most beautiful knolls have been generally selected as the spots on which to build the small mutts and other places of worship with which the country abounds, and the groves that surround or are in the vicinity of these are tended with the greatest care, and the trees composing them replaced as they die\n\n\u00b9 M\u00edru-kannu-gudda, the hill of the three-eyed, i.e., Siva.\n\u00b2 J\u00e9nu-kallu-betta, honey-rock hill.\noff or are blown down. The southern differs from the more northerly and westerly parts of the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d taluq, in the absence of that succession of dense jungles which obscure the view, and in the soft character of the hills, which are in most instances quite free from the stunted date, and smooth as the lawn of a villa on the Thames. But the whole taluq is beautiful, and less wooded than Coorg or Nagar, though greatly partaking of the features of both.\"\n\nThe Maid\u00e1n or lowland tract, forming the largest and most populous portion of the District, consists of an undulating plain country, generally cultivated, but here and there having extensive k\u00e1vals or grazing lands. Patches covered with the wild date are common, and in some parts are limited tracts of stunted jungle growing upon a gravelly, gritty soil. The high-lying lands, particularly in the Hassan, Channar\u00e1yapatna and Hole Narsipur taluqs, have a singularly bare and bleak appearance and are frequently so stony that they are unfit for cultivation. They form, however, good gathering grounds for tanks, and the valleys below are rich and well wooded.\n\nChannels.\u2014The District partakes in the system of irrigation-channels which is so marked a characteristic of the Mysore District. The following table exhibits a summary of particulars regarding the most important. There are also a number of temporary channels for rice-fields in the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d country, and altogether a revenue is derived of Rs. 55,130 a year.\n\n| Name of River | Name of Anicut | Name of Channel | Length in Miles | Acres Irrigated | Revenue in Rupees |\n|---------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|\n| Hemavati      | Srir\u00e1madevar   | North Channel   | 47\u00bd            | 4,413          | 25,092           |\n|               |                | South Channel   | 12             | 606            | 3,544            |\n| Yugachi       | Halvagal       | Halvagal        | 6              | 184            | 914              |\n|               | Changarvalli   | Changarvalli    | 9              | 281            | 1,599            |\n|               | Chakratirtha an\u00e9 | Chakratirtha | 2              | 130            | 749              |\n|               | Arehalli an\u00e9   | Arehalli        | 2              | 40             | 190              |\n|               | Kittur an\u00e9     | Kittur          | 9              | 559            | 2,557            |\n|               | Kudlur         | Kudlur          | 6              | 416            | 2,220            |\n|               | Madagatta      | Madagatta       | 8              | 550            | 2,501            |\n\nRocks.\u2014Throughout the District, kaolin, felspar, quartz, and other materials suitable for the manufacture of earthenware are abundant. Kunker, a tufaceous nodular limestone, is found in many parts of the District, and is the only form of limestone rock known. It is found in alluvial valleys and on the banks of some streams, under or mixed with coloured clay. Potstone, from which the images at Halebid are carved, is found at four places in the Hassan and Belur taluqs. Hematite iron\nore is obtained from the Bagadi hills in the Arsikere taluq, associated with granitic rocks, broken by trap protrusions.\n\nExtensive traces of old gold mines have been found in some parts, and gold-mining on modern principles has been commenced at Harnhalli and Kempinkote, though as yet with little result.\n\nSoils.\u2014The soil of the Maln\u00e1d is a rich red sedimentary, with forest loam in the jungles, and a red laterite soil on the grass-covered hills. The hills are of primitive formation, chiefly granitic, with a little iron ore. The products of this part are rice in the valleys, coffee and cardamoms in forest slopes.\n\nThe soils in the plains, surrounding the hills, are generally of a rich sedimentary character, easily worked, and affording fine crops of cereal or garden produce. On the tops of the rising grounds the soil is of course generally thinner and more sandy or gravelly than in the valleys, where on the contrary it is more clayey and darker in colour. There are also other extensive tracts with a gravelly sandy soil, resulting from the disintegration in situ of the primitive schists superimposed upon the granite. The black soil occurs, but only to small extent and in patches, chiefly in the Arkalgud, Channar\u00e1yapatna and Arsikere taluqs.\n\nClimate.\u2014The temperature of Hassan is slightly lower than that of Bangalore, the mean reading of the thermometer being $72^\\circ9'$, and the daily range about $20^\\circ$. The maximum has reached $97^\\circ6'$ in April, while the minimum has touched $42^\\circ7'$ in January. The heat during the hot months of March and April is much modified by the sea-breeze from the western coast, and by light fogs in the mornings and evenings. Owing to its proximity to the Western Ghats, and the moisture of the atmosphere from the numerous forest lands and marshy fields, the temperature of the Maln\u00e1d is some degrees lower; but this scarcely compensates for the malaria generated by the extensive decomposition of vegetable matter. The European settlers generally suffer from miasmatic fever after the early rains, but they soon grow acclimatized and are ultimately better able to withstand it than the natives themselves, numbers of whom succumb each year to its attacks.\n\nThe following is a table of mean meteorological results from observations recorded at Hassan in 1894 and 1895:\u2014\n| Year | Barometer | Thermometers | Aqueous Vapour | Wind | Rain | Cloud |\n|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------|------|-------|\n|      | Red. to Sea Level. | Daily Range. | Mean.

But the western districts bordering on the Ghats have a much heavier fall; the annual average at Sakleshpur being 83.55 inches, and at Aigur, near the Bisale ghat, as high as 100. At some of the western coffee estates even this is exceeded; the average at Byakarvalli Estate for 10 years being 110.26 and at Hulhalli Estate for 16 years 120.25. During the south-west monsoon, which prevails from the month of May till the middle of August, the weather is cold and raw; the rain-fall is continuous, with a few slight breaks. The sone or drizzling rain extends as far as Gr\u00e1ma, 8 miles west of Hassan, and the condition of the surrounding vegetation distinctly shows the lines of demarcation which separate the Maln\u00e1d from the Maid\u00e1n country. The north-east monsoon also reaches the District, and the heavy showers which fall in October are of great value in filling the tanks in the Maid\u00e1n taluqs.\n\nThe annual average by taluqs has been thus registered for the 26 years and for 10 years.\n\n| Taluq          | 26 Years | 10 Years |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| Arkalgud       | 26.33    | 28.27    |\n| Arsikere       | 26.16    | 25.80    |\n| Balur          | 29.88    | 31.00    |\n| Channarayapatna| 22.12    | 22.99    |\n| Gr\u00e1ma          |          | 28.77    |\n| Hassan         |          | 32.94    |\n| Hole Narsipur  |          | 26.81    |\n| Sakleshpur     |          | 83.55    |\n\nThe actual annual rain-fall at Hassan has been registered as follows:\n\n| Year | Rainfall |\n|------|----------|\n| 1868 | 30.62    |\n| 1869 | 32.40    |\n| 1870 | 38.19    |\n| 1871 | 27.59    |\n| 1872 | 33.38    |\n| 1873 | 43.70    |\n| 1874 | 47.57    |\n| 1875 | 22.63    |\n| 1876 | 18.06    |\n| 1877 | 38.55    |\n| 1878 | 29.01    |\n| 1879 | 34.11    |\n| 1880 | 33.23    |\n| 1881 | 16.12    |\n| 1882 | 42.49    |\n| 1883 |          |\n| 1884 |          |\n| 1885 |          |\n| 1886 | 35.83    |\n| 1887 | 34.95    |\n| 1888 | 29.20    |\n| 1889 | 31.80    |\n| 1890 | 30.55    |\n| 1891 | 29.92    |\n| 1892 | 29.57    |\n| 1893 | 30.35    |\n| 1894 | 33.88    |\n| 1895 | 29.71    |\n\nVegetation.\u2014The upper slopes of the Ghats which form the western boundary of the District are clothed with magnificent virgin forests, containing, amongst other trees, the poon (*calophyllum angustifolium*), the soem (*soymida febrifuga*), and blackwood (*dalbergia latifolia*). Some of these forests have been taken up for coffee and cardamom cultivation, but certain of them are reserved by Government as State forests\u2014namely, the Kempuhole Ghat, Kaganeri Ghat, Kabbinate Ghat, and Bisale Ghat, all in the Manjarabad taluq. Owing, however, to their inaccessible position, these forests have as yet been worked only on a limited scale. The timber found in the coffee jungles bordering on the Ghats is of little value, with the exception of the honne (*pterocarpus marsupium*), the nandi (*lagerstroemia microcarpa*), matti\n(terminalia tomentosa), heswa (artocarpus hirsuta), ebony (diospyros ebenum), and wild champaka (michelia champaca).\n\nLying more inland, in that tract of country in which the pure Malnad (hill country) merges into the Maidan (plain country), are the Gopigudda, Doddabetta, Hulkunda and Nagavara jungles. They contain chiefly inferior kinds of woods, with a quantity of nandi, matti and honne, much injured by indiscriminate felling. In the Arkalgud taluq, the only jungle worthy of mention is a strip of land lying on the borders of Coorg known as the Menasabetta, the value of which is at present very small from its having been overworked. In the Belur taluq is the Arehalli jungle, containing wood of the above description, but of little value from want of a road. There are also low matti jungles of some size near the Maharajandurga fort, and scrub jungle near the Sige-gudda in the Hassan and Hirikalgudda in the Arsikere taluqs. The babul (acacia arabica) is to be found growing in fields in parts of the Channarayapatna and Hole Narsipur taluqs.\n\nThe pepper vine grows wild in the jungles of Manjarabad. The dindaga (conocarpus latifolia) and b\u00e9vu (melia azadirachta), yielding gum, are met with in various places. The rottleria tinctoria is found in Manjarabad, the morinda citrifolia and morinda ternifolia in Belur, Manjarabad and Arkalgud. These yield the dyes known as kapile and maddi. The dyes called papli chakki and patanga are obtained, the former from the root of a scandent plant in Arsikere and Arkalgud, the latter from the bark of a small tree in Harnhalli. The j\u00e1la or lac tree (vatica) is found scattered over several other taluqs, but not in Manjarabad, Arkalgud and Channarayapatna. The sige kayi or soap nut (mimosa abstergens) is planted for village hedges in the east, but grows wild in Manjarabad and Belur. Except in the Ghat forests, sandal grows freely in the western taluqs in garden hedges and light jungle.\n\nForests.\u2014The State Forests cover an area of 185 square miles. The following is a list of them, including 5 sandal reserves which occupy 3 square miles:\n\n| State Forests | Sandal Reserves |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| Kempuhole Ghat | 16 Burdalbore | Kemmanbore | 32 |\n| Kaganeri      | 2 Hagare     | Gubbi     | 428 |\n| Kabbinale     | 23 Byala     | Gandagere | 554 |\n| Bisale        | 23 Sige-gudda| Gubbi     | 1,000 |\n| Vijayapur     | 5 Baisur    | Nakalgud  | 185 |\n| Hirikalgudda  | 92 Mallappan-betta | |\n| Doddabetta    | 3 Vantigudda | |\n\nPlantations.\u2014There are 12 Forest plantations, covering 3,053 acres;\nand 8 Revenue plantations, covering 582 acres. **Avenues.\u2014**There are 566 miles of road planted with avenues. **Groves.\u2014**The number of topes or groves is 1,502, stocked with 57,141 trees.\n\n**Cultivation.\u2014**The following is a list of the ordinary crops cultivated:\n\n| Kannada       | Botanical                  | English     |\n|---------------|----------------------------|-------------|\n|               |                            |             |\n| **Cereals.**  |                            |             |\n| Bhatta        | Oryza sativa               | Rice        |\n| Godhi         | Triticum aristatum         | Wheat       |\n| J\u00f3la          | Holcus sorghum             | Maize       |\n| R\u00e1gi          | Eleusine corocana           | R\u00e1gi        |\n| S\u00e1me          | Panicum frumentaceum       | Little millet|\n|               |                            |             |\n| **Pulses.**   |                            |             |\n| Avare         | Dolichos lablab            | Cow gram    |\n| Hesaru        | Phaseolus mungo            | Green ,,    |\n| Hurali        | Dolichos uniflorus         | Horse ,,    |\n| Kadaile       | Cicer arietinum            | Bengal gram |\n| Togari        | Cajanus indicus            | Dholl       |\n| Uddu          | Phaseolus minimus          | Black gram  |\n|               |                            |             |\n| **Oil Seeds.**|                            |             |\n| Haralu        | Ricinus communis           | Castor-oil  |\n| Huchchellu    | Guizotea oleifera          | Wild gingelli|\n| Pundi         | Hibiscus                   | Hemp        |\n| Wollellu      | Sesamum orientale          | Gingelli    |\n|               |                            |             |\n| **Miscellaneous.** |                        |             |\n| Arale         | Gossypium indicum          | Cotton      |\n| Hoge soppu    | Nicotina tabaccum          | Tobacco     |\n| Menasina kayi | Capsicum annum             | Chilly      |\n\nThe number of acres under cultivation of the principal crops is thus returned for 1893: Rice 103,081, r\u00e1gi 287,458, wheat 80, other food grains 47,004, oil-seeds 32,670, sugar-cane 6,327, cotton 231, fibres 105, tobacco 1,939, cinchona 36, coffee 53,277, vegetables 3,455, cocoa-nut and areca-nut 25,677, other products 64,861.\n\nThough the soil in many parts of the District is favourable, the ryots have directed little of their attention to the cultivation of wheat and cotton; the former is grown in the Arsikere taluq, and the latter in the Arsikere and Arkalgud taluqs.\n\n**Tobacco** is cultivated to some extent on dry lands in parts of the Arsikere, Belur, and Arkalgud taluqs. The tobacco grown in the Arkalgud taluq is much prized for snuff, but that of Harnhalli and Belur is of inferior quality and is chiefly sold on the western coast for chewing.\n\nThe grain principally cultivated in the Malnad is **rice**, which, though\nof an inferior quality, grows most luxuriantly in the long winding valleys and in fields cut in terraces on their sides. At the head of each valley is generally a small tank with a common mud bund, which serves to collect a little water from the spring rising above it, to be used when the rains hang off; but artificial irrigation is generally rendered superfluous by the exceeding abundance and regularity of the rains, which continue in good seasons with but little intermission from May to November. The rice cultivated in the north-west of the Hassan taluq, and that grown in the Maidan taluqs on land irrigated by the channels leading from the anicuts thrown across the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, Hem\u00e1vati and Yagachi rivers, is of a superior kind and bears comparison with the best table rice of Southern India. In other places in the Maidan country the crop is dependent on irrigation from tanks. In a few places where the means of irrigating is deficient, a coarse rice called bhar-doddi is raised, chiefly in the Arkalgud, Hole Narsipur and Channar\u00e1yapatna taluqs.\n\nThe sugar-cane grown is generally of the inferior kinds known as mara-kabbu and chaini-kabbu.\n\nThe rise in the price of rice, which has steadily taken place during the past few years, combined with years of drought, has lessened greatly the high estimation in which the possession of cocoa-nut and areca-nut palm gardens was once held. Many of the gardens are now much neglected, and the ryots no longer show the same avidity as they did formerly for this cultivation; which has the further disadvantage of not yielding a return till ten or twelve years after the trees are planted. The most valuable gardens are those situated in the Arkalgud taluq, where many of the Sank\u00e9ti and Sri Vaishnava Brahman proprietors work in gardens themselves. The areca-nut produced is known as the vol\u00e1gra, and is not held in such high repute as that of Nagar. The cocoa-nuts of the Arsikere taluq, which are allowed to remain on the tree till they drop, are, however, much prized, and are largely exported in a dry state to Tiptur for the Bangalore and Bellary markets.\n\nPlantains of good quality are grown to a considerable extent, and formerly every ryot in the Malnad had a few trees at the back of his house, but the cultivation has gradually yielded to that of coffee.\n\nThe cultivation of coffee takes rank as one of the most important products of the country. The rich red loam of the primeval forests which cover the slopes of the Malnad hills, is found to be well adapted for its growth. The cultivation of the berry, introduced first from Mecca by Baba Budan on the hills which bear his name in the Kadur District, was gradually extended into Manjarabad, and at the period of\nthe assumption of the administration of the country by the British Government in 1831 was beginning to attract some attention. The cultivation of the plant did not, however, become general till Mr. Frederick Green opened the first European plantation in Manjarabad in 1843: since which period others, being assured of its success, have taken up jungle lands and invested capital largely in the enterprise. Every native in the Malnad has a few coffee-trees planted at the back of his house, and the Patels and principal Gaudas have extended this cultivation till it embraces, in small plots, the whole of the jungles in which their villages are situated.\n\nThe following is the acreage under coffee in 1896 in the taluqs in which it is cultivated:\u2014Manjarabad, 48,773; Balur, 10,301; Hassan, 1,117; Arkalgud, 110.\n\nThe cardamom plant is indigenous, being found growing wild in the densely wooded ravines on the verge of the Western Ghats. Its systematic cultivation has, for some years, been undertaken on a large scale.\n\n**Wild Animals.**\u2014The forests of the Malnad and the rocky hills in the Hassan, Arkalgud and Arsikere taluqs, give shelter to numerous wild beasts, amongst which the tiger, cheeta, bear, elk, spotted deer, jungle sheep and wild pig are the most common; black cheetas are occasionally shot in Manjarabad, and herds of elephants and bison visit the hilly tracts on the verge of the Ghats. Wolves and hyenas infest the Arsikere taluq, and antelope are plentiful in the k\u00e1vals in the Maidan taluqs. Of the smaller mammalia, jackals, black and common monkeys, hares, squirrels, wild cats, sloths and porcupines are numerous. Otters are also found at the Krishnaraj anicut in the Arkalgud taluq and the Yettinhalla river in the Manjarabad taluq.\n\n**Birds.**\u2014Numbers of duck, teal, widgeon, a few wild geese and numerous waders visit the District in the cold season, and some remain to breed in the little tanks about Hassan and in the country to the west. Of the feathery tribes, jungle fowl, imperial pigeon, and peafowl are to be found in the jungles and gardens; and florican, bustard, and partridge on the plains. The *falco peregrinator* hawk is to be met with on the ghats in the Manjarabad taluq.\n\n**Reptiles.**\u2014Of the articulata, snakes and leeches are very numerous, especially in the forests of Manjarabad.\n\n**Fish.**\u2014The tanks and rivers are full of fish, of which the most esteemed for its taste is the mirl or maral.\n\n**Domestic Animals.**\u2014Owing to the number of k\u00e1vals or pasture lands in the District belonging to the Amrit Mahal\u2014some of considerable extent, such as the S\u00edge-gudda k\u00e1val near Hassan, affording rich pasturage and of sufficient size to maintain 2,500 head of cattle\u2014may\nbe attributed the possession by the more respectable class of ryots of a few cattle of superior breed. In the western taluqs the ploughing cattle are of diminutive size and of little value. Owing to the coarseness of the pasturage and the humidity of the climate, the mortality among the cattle in the Malnad is very great, so much so that the Gaudas have to replace their losses every few years by fresh purchases from the Maidan taluqs.\n\nDraught cattle are numerous in Hassan, which is the great carrying taluq of the country, and supplies nearly all the carts required for the carriage of the rice and coffee of this District and of Kadur.\n\nThe live stock of the District in 1893 consisted of 516,894 cows and bullocks, 300 horses, 2,886 ponies, 2,382 mules and donkeys, 243,683 sheep and goats, 5,821 pigs, and 64,016 buffaloes.\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe earliest event supported by any evidence was a migration of Jains from Ujjain, under the leadership of Bhadrab\u00e1hu, one of the sruta-kevalis or hearers of the first masters, in order to escape a dreadful famine of twelve years' duration. He was accompanied by his principal disciple, Chandra Gupta, who is said to be identical with the great Maurya emperor, contemporary with the Macedonian conqueror Alexander the Great. While the emigrants were on their way to the Punn\u00e1ta country (South Mysore) and the Ch\u00f3la-mandala, their leader, Bhadrab\u00e1hu, died at Sravana Belgola, attended in his last moments by Chandra Gupta, who also died there twelve years later. These occurrences are recorded in an ancient inscription engraved on the surface of the rock at the summit of Chandra-betta at Sravana Belgola, and may be assigned to the 3rd century B.C. They invested the place with a sanctity which led to the subsequent formation of the well-known Jain settlement there. The colossal statue of Gomatesvara at the same place, on the summit of Indra-betta, bears at its foot inscriptions stating that it was erected by Ch\u00e1munda R\u00e1ya. He was the minister and general of the Ganga king R\u00e1chamalla II, and its date is probably 983.\u00b9\n\nKadambas.\u2014During the first five centuries of the Christian era the west of the District was included with Tuluva (South Canara) as part of the Kadamba kingdom, whose capital was at Banavasi. After this the Kadambas became tributary to the Chalukyas, but we find Kadamba chiefs ruling as far south as Bayaln\u00e1d (the Heggadadevankote taluq) down to the end of the 11th century.\n\n\u00b9 See my book, Inscriptions at Sravana-Belgola.\nGangas.\u2014The Gangas, whose capital was at Talakad on the Kaveri, in the south-east of the Mysore District, were in possession of the whole of Mysore between the Western and Eastern Ghats from the 5th to the 11th century. The Jain establishment at Sravana Belgola (Channarayapatna taluq) was in a special manner under their protection.\n\nHoysalas.\u2014But the District is more particularly identified with the rise of the Hoysala power, and formed their ancestral kingdom. The origin of the line has been related in the general chapter on History (in Vol. I), and Sosevur or Sasakapura, the home of Sala, the founder, has been identified by me with Angadi, which, though by recent changes in taluq boundaries it is now just within the Mudgere taluq of the Kadur District, is properly a village of the long-standing Balam or Manjarabad country. The dynasty arose in the 10th century, and continued in power to the middle of the 14th century. Their capital was Dorasamudra, the modern Halebid (Belur taluq), and the boundaries of the kingdom in the time of Vinayaditya (1047\u20131100), the son of Sala, were\u2014on the west, Konkana (North Kanara) and Alvakheda (South Kanara); on the south, Bayalnad (Heggadadevan-kote taluq); on the east, Talakad (that is, not the city itself, but the province belonging to it; on the north, Savimale (a hill not yet identified).\n\nThe kings had hitherto been adherents of the Jain faith, but Bitti Deva, through the influence of a Vaishnava wife and the efforts of Ramanauja, the great Vaishnava teacher, who had taken refuge in Mysore from persecution by the Saiva king of the Chola country, embraced the religion of Vishnu and thence assumed his better known name of Vishnuvarddhana. He re-captured Talakad, which a century before had been taken by the Cholas, drove the latter out of Mysore, and possessed himself of all the old Ganga dominions. The Hoysalas had professed allegiance to the Chalukyas, but after this assumed independence. Ballala II (1172\u20131209) carried the Hoysala dominions up to the river Krishna, making Lakkundi in Dharwar his residence for a time; and Somesvara (1233\u201354) extended them southwards over the Chola country, where he took up his abode at Kannanur, near Trichinopoly. On his death there was a partition of his territories, the old Kannada provinces, with the capital, going to Narasimha III, and the Tamil provinces, with Kolar District and the north of Bangalore District, going to Ramanatha. The territories were re-united under Ballala III (1291\u20131342), but the Muhammadans now appeared on the scene and brought the Hoysala power to an end. In 1311, an army under Kafur, the general of Ala-ud-Din, sacked Dorasamudra and returned to Delhi laden with spoils. In 1326 an expedition sent by\nMuhammad III totally destroyed the city. The Hoysala prince retired at first to Tondanur (Tonnur, Mysore District), but lived at various places, such as Hosavidu (Hosur in Kolar District) and Unn\u00e1male (Trinomalee in South Arcot) maintaining an enfeebled power for about twenty years longer.\n\n**Vijayanagar.**\u2014In 1336 was founded the city of Vidy\u00e1nagara, afterwards called Vijayanagara, the sovereigns of which eventually became paramount over all the countries south of the Krishna. They are stated to have taken peculiar interest in the province of Balam, now Manjarabad, and to have made great efforts to colonize it. Every encouragement was given to settlers of all castes by granting them land at little or no rent. The wealthier immigrants were made Patels and received large inams. This is the period at which, it is assumed, the inhabitants generally obtained a proprietary right in the land and the patels hereditary feudal powers. Later, all the west of this District was bestowed, with adjoining tracts above and below the Ghats, upon Vina Ramappa, a court musician. After a reign of some years he abdicated, and the province of Balam, composed as above, and yielding a revenue of three lakhs of pagodas, was in 1397 made over by the rulers of Vijayanagar to Singappa Nayak, one of their generals and son of an old palegar named Manch Ayappa Nayak. The Balam palegars had their capital at Aigur and held the country for some generations.\n\nThe following is a tentative list of the N\u00e1yaks of Balam, with dates taken mostly from inscriptions:\n\n| Name                  | Dates       |\n|-----------------------|-------------|\n| Hiriya Singappa N\u00e1yak | 1397        |\n| Manchayya N\u00e1yak       | 1405        |\n| Chikka Singappa N\u00e1yak |             |\n| Hadapa Bayappa N\u00e1yak  | 1534-48     |\n| Krishnappa N\u00e1yak      | 1625-40     |\n| Venkat\u00e1dri N\u00e1yak      | 1646-56     |\n| Narasimha N\u00e1yak       | 1658-65     |\n| Venkat\u00e1dri N\u00e1yak      | 1671        |\n| Krishnappa N\u00e1yak      | 1686-1730   |\n| Venkat\u00e1dri N\u00e1yak      | 1751        |\n| Krishnappa N\u00e1yak      | 1772-93     |\n| Venkat\u00e1dri N\u00e1yak      | 1799        |\n\nThe fortunes of the family are further referred to below. Representatives are still in existence at Aigur.\n\nAt the end of the 16th century Jagadeva R\u00e1yal, already mentioned in connection with his capital of Channapatna (Bangalore District), was invested with a territory extending over the east of the District.\n\n**Mysore Rajas.**\u2014Kikkeri, Sindhugatta, Nagamangala, and other places belonging to this government had gradually fallen to the Mysore R\u00e1jas, along with Channapatna, when in 1633 the Mysore army gained Channar\u00e1yapatna from the palegar of Hole Narsipur after a very long siege.\n\n1 A performer, as his name indicates, on the *vina* or Indian lute.\nShortly after this period we find Sivappa Nayak, of the Ikkeri principality in Nagar, attaining considerable power. So much so that Balam was overrun and held for 37 years, and shelter even extended to a descendant of the Vijayanagar house who had resorted for protection and help to this late dependent on its sovereign power. Sivappa Nayak established him in authority at Sakkarepatna and Belur, and even invaded Seringapatam in 1654 in his behalf. Peace was concluded between Mysore and Ikkeri in 1694, by which the six n\u00e1ds of Manjarabad were ceded to the old chiefs, and the remainder of the province of Balam was divided between the two contending parties. Except Manjarabad, the whole of the Hassan District has from this time formed a part of Mysore territory. On the capture of Bednur by Haidar Ali in 1762, Balam, which belonged to it, was allowed to remain in the hands of the chiefs on payment of an annual tribute of 5,000 pagodas.\n\nThe Arsikere taluq appears to have suffered greatly from the raids of the Mahrattas, and at one time was handed over to these freebooters as security for the payment of tribute: the villagers are then said to have raised for their defence those earthen towers which are yet to be seen in different parts of the taluq.\n\nKrishnappa Nayak, who was ruling Balam in the time of Tipu Sultan, joined the army of Parasu Ram Bhao when advancing to cooperate with Lord Cornwallis against Seringapatam in 1792. On the conclusion of peace he fled to Coorg, fearing the Sultan's displeasure; but the latter induced him to return, and gave him the government of the Aigur-s\u00edme, forming the south of Balam. The rest of the province was attached to Mysore. Venkat\u00e1dri Nayak, son of Krishnappa Nayak, was in possession of Aigur-s\u00edme at the fall of Seringapatam in 1799, and not only attempted to retain his independence but to extend his authority farther to the north. He was after two years seized at Uggihalli and as an example hanged, contrary to the wishes of Colonel Wellesley.\n\nThe Hassan District during the present century first formed part of the Patnada R\u00e1yada, and was then called the Manjarabad Faujd\u00e1ri. From 1832 it was included in the Ashtagram Division. This was abolished at the Rendition in 1881, and in 1882 the Hassan District itself was reduced to a Sub-Division under Kadur District, with only four taluqs: Arsikere, Belur, Hassan (with Gr\u00e1ma sub-taluq), and Manjarabad. In 1886 the Hassan District, as at present constituted, was re-established, and in 1894 Alur was made the sub-taluq under Hassan instead of Gr\u00e1ma.\nNumber.\u2014The population of the District is 514,952; of whom 255,044 are males and 259,908 females.\n\nDensity.\u2014This gives 195 persons per square mile. The most thickly populated taluq is Arkalgud, where there are 290'12 persons to a square mile; next to which come Hassan, where the rate is 238'73, Belur 222'69, and Hole Narsipur 218'42. The most sparsely populated are Manjarabad, with 129'91 to the square mile, and Arsikere, with 133'27.\n\nBy religion.\u2014According to religion the population is classified as follows:\n\n| Religions | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|-----------|----------|----------|-------|\n|           | Males    | Females  | Males | Females | Total | Percentage |\n| Hindus    | 150,040  | 154,650  | 95,424| 96,551   | 496,665| 96'44      |\n| Muhammadans | 4,575   | 3,893    | 2,629 | 2,558    | 13,655 | 2'65       |\n| Jains     | 441      | 427      | 219   | 234      | 1,321  | 0'25       |\n| Christians| 1,124    | 953      | 586   | 633      | 3,296  | 0'64       |\n| Jews      | 2        | 5        | 4     | 4        | 15     | \u2014          |\n| **Total** | **156,182** | **159,928** | **98,862** | **99,980** | **514,952** | **\u2014** |\n\nIncrease.\u2014The following compares the statistics by taluqs according to the kh\u00e1neshum\u00e1ri accounts of 1853-4 with those obtained in the census enumerations of 1871, 1881 and 1891:\n\n| Taluq         | 1853-4 | 1871 | 1881 | 1891 |\n|---------------|--------|------|------|------|\n| Arkalgud      | 57,917 | 76,184| 66,157| 75,812|\n| Arsikere      | 29,753 | 74,720| 50,656| 65,306|\n| Belur         | 53,830 | 75,821| 67,538| 75,470|\n| Channar\u00e1yapatna| 34,356 | 79,178| 63,380| 78,211|\n| Hassan        | 43,460 | 111,921| 95,077| 113,397|\n| Maharajandurga| 45,793 | 111,921| 95,077| 113,397|\n| Hole Narsipur | 30,294 | 50,941| 37,783| 50,894|\n| Manjarabad    | 40,398 | 52,918| 50,342| 55,862|\n| **Total**     | **334,901** | **521,683** | **430,933** | **514,952** |\n\nBearing in mind that some of the variations are due to redistribution of taluqs and to changes in the limits of the District, there was an apparent increase on the whole up to 1871 of 55'77 per cent. in 18 years. But the early enumeration was 25 per cent. in defect. The\nfamine of 1877-8 sent down the total 17.39 per cent. by 1881, but it had risen again 19.5 per cent. by 1891. The net result may be stated at an increase of 20.61 per cent. in 38 years.\n\nClasses.\u2014Classified according to sources of livelihood and nationality the population is composed as follows:\n\n| Class                                      | Number   | Per cent. |\n|--------------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| A.

The produce of the looms in other parts of the country is of the coarsest description, the cloth being made either to order for the villagers or sold at the weekly markets.\n\nSilk.\u2014Musalmans at Channar\u00e1yapatna and Hole Narsipur earn a livelihood by making purses, silk cords and tassels.\n\nWool.\u2014Cumblies or the coarse woollen blankets generally worn by the peasantry are manufactured in all the taluqs, save Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d, by the Kurubar or shepherd class.\n\nMetals.\u2014A little iron ore is smelted at B\u00e1gadi in the Arsikere taluq. It is used chiefly for agricultural implements, but is of inferior quality, and no steel is manufactured.\n\nThe manufacture of brass and copper vessels is virtually a monopoly\nof the Jains residing at Sravana Belgola. Their pots are of excellent quality and meet with a ready sale at Mysore, and at the great annual festival at Subrahmanya in the South Kanara District.\n\nGold-mining, under European management, has been started in Arsikere and Channarayapatna taluqs, but as yet with no satisfactory results. There are, however, extensive traces of old and abandoned workings.\n\nOils.\u2014Under this heading may be added oil-mills, of which a large number are at work in the District, driven by bullock-power. The oil (castor, gingelli and wild gingelli) produced is mostly exported to Kanara, Coorg and to Birur in the Kadur District.\n\nBags.\u2014The manufacture of gunny bags gives employment to a few people, chiefly in the Arkalgud, Hole Narsipur and Channarayapatna taluqs. Bags for the export of grain are also made from the bark of a tree called gaja mara, or elephant-tree. The trunk is steeped in water, after which the bark is removed entire by threshing it, in which state it is not unlike the leg of an elephant.\n\nCoffee.\u2014But the most important industry of the District is the cultivation of coffee, the produce of which, estimated at 15 to 20 lakhs of rupees a year, is mostly exported to Mangalore and the western coast preparatory to shipment to Europe.\n\nExports and Imports.\u2014Though the exports of the District are large, the trade of the country is in the hands chiefly of outsiders, who frequent the different markets; there are therefore few merchants resident in the District of any wealth or importance. In addition to coffee, the articles exported are chiefly food grains. The imports consist of iron and of European cottons and woollens: ghee, areca-nut and cocoa-nut are also imported, together with salt.\n\nMarts.\u2014The great rice market is at Alur in the Hassan taluq, about 7 miles from the kasba: it is attended by the ryots of the Malnad, who bring their rice in large quantities for sale, and by purchasers, many of whom come from great distances with carts and droves of bullocks for the conveyance of the rice purchased. Other important trading places are Yesalurpet, Kenchammana Hoskote and Channarayapatna.\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nRailways.\u2014The Southern Mahratta Railway from Bangalore to Poona crosses the north-west of the District for about 18 miles, with stations at Arsikere and Banavar. But a project has been prepared for a line from Arsikere, by way of Hassan and Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d, to Mangalore, which would be of great importance for the District.\n\nRoads.\u2014In 1837 not a bridge had been constructed in the District, nor a road formed worthy of the name: the only means of carriage was by palanquins and pack bullocks. But now the District is intersected by several main lines of-road, which connect all the towns of any importance, and afford easy means of communication with the large towns of Bangalore, Mysore, Bellary and Mangalore, to which places the trade of the country chiefly converges.\n\nOf the passes to Mangalore and the country below the Western Ghats, there are two in Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d\u2014namely, the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d and Bisale. The Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d Ghat road, on the grand trunk line from Bangalore to Mangalore, is towards the south of the Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d taluq, and has been traced with great care. The gradients are from 1 in 20 to 1 in 14. The Bisale Ghat road is adapted principally for pack bullocks and foot passengers.\n\nThere are 127 miles of Provincial roads in the District, maintained at a cost of Rs. 23,120 a year. The length of District roads is 395 miles, costing Rs. 24,180. Particulars of each class of roads are given below:\n\n| Provincial Roads                      | Miles | Cost   |\n|---------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Bangalore-Mangalore road              | 85    | 17,000 |\n| Bangalore-Honnavar road               | 20    | 4,000  |\n| Banavar-Belur road                   | 13    | 1,040  |\n| Hassan-Chikmagalur road               | 9     | 1,080  |\n| **Total**                             | **127**| **Rs. 23,120** |\n\n| District Roads                       | Miles | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|--------|\n| Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d-Subrahmanya road          | 39    | 3,900  |\n| Arsikere-Channar\u00e1yapatna road        | 28    | 2,520  |\n| Hassan-Tiptur road                   | 24    | 1,920  |\n| Hassan-Cannanore road                | 37    | 1,850  |\n| Velwal-Hassan road                  | 33    | 1,650  |\n| Arsikere-Huliyar road                | 22    | 1,100  |\n| Tiptur-Channar\u00e1yapatna road          | 21    | 1,050  |\n| Kattaya-Hallibail road               | 19    | 950    |\n| Dudda-Arsikere road                  | 16    | 800    |\n| Seringapatam-Channar\u00e1yapatna road    | 5     | 750    |\n| Banavar-Sira road                    | 15    | 750    |\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\n| Route                                      | Miles | Cost |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------|------|\n| Channarayapatna-Narsipur road              | 13    | 650  |\n| Narsipur-Arkalgud road                     | 13    | 650  |\n| Anemahal-Mudgere road                      | 12    | 600  |\n| Ayyahalli-Yesalurpet road                  | 12    | 600  |\n| Banavar-Hiradi road                        | 10    | 500  |\n| Ramnathpur-Fraserpet road                  | 8     | 480  |\n| Hirisave-Nuggihalli road                   | 9     | 450  |\n| Arkalgud-Koolipet road                     | 9     | 450  |\n| Hampapur-Ramnathpur road                   | 8     | 400  |\n| Wongur-Mallipatna road                     | 8     | 400  |\n| Channarayapatna-Sravana Belgola road       | 7     | 350  |\n| Hassan-Salgiram road                       | 6     | 300  |\n| Sagarkatte-Ramnathpur road                 | 5     | 250  |\n| Raji-Belur road                            | 5     | 250  |\n| Banavar-Sakkarepatna road                  | 2     | 160  |\n| Bartavalli loop road                       | 3     | 150  |\n| Palya-Belagod road                         | 3     | 150  |\n| Kikkeri-Ippaya road                        | 2     | 100  |\n| Hullahalli loop road                       | 1     | 50   |\n\nTotal miles 395 Rs. 24,180\n\nAccommodation for travellers.\u2014For the accommodation of European travellers stage bungalows have been built at the stations named below.

In 1886 the taluq was again formed with the 6 hoblis detailed above.\n\nThe Hemavati forms the entire northern boundary: the Kaveri runs through a portion of the south. From the Krishnarajkatte on the Kaveri the Kattepura channel runs along the south bank, past Rudrapatna; and the Ramnathpur channel along the north bank, past Konanur and Ramnathpur to Basavapatna. Under these channels, although sugar-cane is but little grown, the rice crop is one of great yield and certainty. The kinds principally sown are kembhatta, putbhatta and donibil. The lands under tanks are of a very mixed character, and generally inferior in quality. Under the larger tanks, rice is followed by a crop of onions, which are very paying, and are extensively cultivated, especially in Arkalgud hobli.\nThe west of the taluq, up to the borders of Coorg, is jungly and hilly, being on the skirts of the Malnad. The southern portion, along the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, besides paddy cultivation, supports numerous cocoanut and areca-nut gardens. But the areca-nut is the coarse variety or g\u00f2du, and it takes 50 trees to produce a manud of nuts. The gardens wind along sometimes in the southern valleys for two or three miles at a stretch. On the high watershed towards the centre there is much cultivation of tobacco, which is converted into snuff.\n\nThe taluq formed part of the Province of Balam until 1647, when it was conquered by the R\u00e1ja of Mysore. In 1694 it was retaken from Sivappa N\u00e1yak of Ikkeri, into whose hands it had fallen, and has ever since been united to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1883. The culturable area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\nDry, 63,849; wet, 8,180; garden, 2,638 ... Total acres 74,667.\n\nThe total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,47,148 and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,51,953.\n\nThe average rainfall at Arkalg\u00fad for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0'01 | 0'01 | 0'17 | 1'88 | 3'45 | 3'17 | 5'48 | 2'46 | 1'99  | 4'73 | 2'43 | 0'55 | 26'33 |\n\nAnother register for 10 years gives an average of 28'27.\n\nA road from Hassan through Arkalg\u00fad and R\u00e1mn\u00e1thpur to Piriyapatna runs through the taluq from north to south. This is crossed at Arkalg\u00fad by the Narsipur-Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d road through Kodlipet, running from west to east, and branching at Mallipatna to the Bis\u00e1le Ghat. It is also crossed at R\u00e1mn\u00e1thpur by a road following the north bank of the river from Hampapur in Yedatore taluq to Fraserpet in Coorg, and there is a road running from it east on the south bank of the river to Yedatore.\n\nArkalg\u00fad.\u2014A town situated in 12\u00b0 46' N. lat., 76\u00b0 7' E. long., 17 miles south of Hassan, on the Hassan-Piriyapatna and Kodlipet-Narsipur roads.

He also set up the image of Arkesvara, the erection of whose temple is attributed to a Chola king. The present town was founded about 1568 by Krishnappa Nayak, one of the Aigur chiefs, who changed the name to Arkalgudu\u2014abode of the sun. But old inscriptions give the name as Arakalgudu. It was captured by Kanthirava Narasa Raj of Mysore in 1647, and subsequently by Sivappa Nayak of Ikkeri. In 1694 it was again besieged by Chikka Deva Raja and finally annexed to Mysore.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | ...     | 1,240   | 1,333   | 1,100   | 2,302   |\n| Expenditure      | ...     | 1,311   | 2,212   | 1,519   | 2,546   |\n\nArsikere.\u2014A taluq in the north-east, till 1882 called Haranalli.

In the north are the Hirekal-gudda hills, on which is a temple of Tirupati, called Malekal Tirupati. The drainage of the taluq is northwards to the Vedavati. But there are few streams or tanks of any size. There are several Amrit-mahal kavals in the south, which has led to the breeding of a good stamp of cattle, in some demand in the Malnad.\nThe prevailing soil is of a sandy grey colour and often very stony, improving in quality in the hollows, but so poor on the high-lying lands as to be in many places unculturable. The wet lands vary from fair to good quality. R\u00e1gi is grown everywhere, but in the west and south there is an extensive cultivation of chillies, for supply to the Maln\u00e1d. The cocoa-nuts of this taluq, allowed to remain on the tree till they drop, are much prized and largely exported in a dry state, kobri, to Tiptur, for the Bangalore and Bellary markets. They are grown in the northern parts without irrigation in low-lying situations. The chief exports of the taluq are chillies, oil-seeds and r\u00e1gi from the south, and cocoa-nuts from the north.\n\nThere are numerous memorials throughout the taluq of the Hoysala kings, consisting of deserted temples and large stones covered with inscriptions. This country formed part of the territory bestowed by the Vijayanagar kings on Jagadeva R\u00e1yal (of Channapatna, Bangalore District); on the overthrow of whose power it was seized by Timmappa Nayak of Tarikere, in whose family it remained till overrun together with the neighbouring districts by Sirappa Nayak of Ikkeri or Badnur in the 17th century. In 1690 it was incorporated in the Mysore by treaty with that state.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1879. The area of the taluq at that time was distributed as follows:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 90,072; wet, 3,339; garden, 7,481) | ... | ... | 100,893 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 67,658 |\n| In\u00e1m villages (1,973); 6 Amit Mahal k\u00e1v\u00e1s (12,899) | ... | ... | 14,872 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **183,423** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 35,667 acres, of which 22,395 were dry land. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,60,995 and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,86,722.\n\nThe average rainfall at Arsikere for 26 years (1870\u201395), and at the other station for 3 years (1893\u20135) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|-----|-----|------|\n| Arsikere | 0\u00b004 | 0\u00b001 | 0\u00b018 | 1\u00b092 | 3\u00b011 | 1\u00b092 | 2\u00b004 | 2\u00b076 | 4\u00b057 | 5\u00b041 | 3\u00b030 | 0\u00b090 | ... | 26\u00b016 |\n| B\u00e1n\u00e1vara | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0\u00b003 | 2\u00b017 | 2\u00b054 | 1\u00b050 | 0\u00b060 | 0\u00b033 | 4\u00b008 | 3\u00b050 | 0\u00b099 | \u2014 | ... | 15\u00b074 |\n\nThe railway from Bangalore to Poona runs through the taluq from east to west, with stations at Arsikere and B\u00e1n\u00e1var. Alongside of it is the Bangalore-Shimoga trunk road. From Arsikere there are roads south to Hassan, south-east to Channar\u00e1yapatna, and north to the Huliy\u00e1r road. From B\u00e1n\u00e1var there is a road south-west to Halebid and Belur,\nand north-east to Huliy\u00e1r. There is also a short cross road from Haranhalli eastwards to the trunk road.\n\n**Arsikere or Arasiyakere.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 19' N. lat., and 76\u00b0 19' E. long., 25 miles north by east of Hassan, on the Southern Mahratta railway. Head-quarters of the Arsikere taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus            | 850   | 575     | 1,425 |\n| Muhammadans       | 163   | 100     | 263   |\n| Jains             | 12    | 3       | 15    |\n| Christians        | 121   | 97      | 218   |\n| **Total**         | **1,146** | **775** | **1,921** |\n\nThe town derives its name from a large tank, *Arasiya kere* or princess's tank, which was constructed under the Hoysalas in the 11th century. The fine ruined temples to the north, one of which is a special model of the Chalukyan style, and the inscriptions, show that it was a large place and of considerable importance. Under the Vijayanagar kings it passed into the possession of Jagadeva R\u00e1ya of Channapatna (Bangalore District); afterwards into that of Timmappa N\u00e1yak of Tarikere (Kadur District); and then into that of Sivappa N\u00e1yak of Ikk\u00e9ri (Shimoga District); from whom it was acquired by Mysore by treaty in 1690. At a later period it was part of the H\u00e1ranhalli taluq, which was one of those made over to the Mahrattas as security for the payment of tribute, and suffered the general destruction at their hands which reduced it to an insignificant village. In this condition it remained, with an evil reputation as the haunt of robbers who infested the high road. Since the advent of the railway in 1889, and the location here of the taluq head-quarters, it has developed into a rising and busy centre. It will be the junction for the line to Mangalore, and already the staff occupying the railway quarters accounts for the considerable number of Christians in the population.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 1,777  | 1,836  | 1,608  | 2,212  |\n| Expenditure     | 1,736  | 1,912  | 1,608  | 2,971  |\n\n**Banavar.**\u2014A town in Arsikere taluq, 2 miles north-west of the railway station of the same name, on the Bangalore-Shimoga road. Head-quarters of the Banavar hobli, and a municipality.\nTill 1882 it was the head-quarters of a taluq named after itself, and included in the Kadur District. In 1886, on the formation of the Arsikere taluq, Banavar was absorbed in it and transferred to the Hassan District.\n\nIt is said to derive its name from b\u00e1na (arrow), and hora (carry), Rama having there \"carried the arrows\" which Lakshmana had dropped from fatigue. An inscription of the 12th century spells the name B\u00e1nav\u00faru, arrow town. It seems in about the middle of the 11th century to have been the chief town of a territory ruled by Harihara Somes'vara R\u00e1ya, who was also the founder of Harnhalli. It was then included in the Hoysala kingdom. After the fall of Vijayanagar it was one of the places seized by the Ikkeri chiefs, but was eventually captured by Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja in 1690 and annexed to Mysore. During his wars with the Mahrattas, Haidar Ali removed the people to form a new city at Nagapuri on the Hirekal hills, but the place proving unhealthy, they shortly returned to their original abodes.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income          | 667     | 597     | 618     | 1,164   |\n| Expenditure     | 747     | 670     | 580     | 1,364   |\n\nBelur.\u2014A taluq in the north-west.

The Yagache flows through the central portion in a south-easterly direction, and its tributary\u2014the Berinji-halla joins it in the north. The country in the west is hilly and covered with jungle, the valleys, which are often deep, being cultivated with rice, and the hills, where the trees are of sufficient size, with coffee. In the east, the stony and rocky hills are either bare or partially covered with scrub jungle, the valleys are of greater breadth, and cultivated with rice, sugar-cane and dry crops. The intermediate portion of the taluq, in the vicinity of Belur and along the valley of the Yagache river, partakes of the nature of both east and west, but is generally more level and distinguished by extensive gravelly plains, covered with either short grass or dwarf date. The rice lands here lie in much larger stretches.\n\nThe Yagache and the smaller streams falling into it supply several small channels. The Bomd\u00edhalli channel from the main stream runs for $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles on the right bank, ending near Belur. The Kittur channel, drawn from a minor stream in the north-west, has a length altogether of 15 miles to the west. The Maddigatta channel, 8 miles long, is taken off from another small stream in the south. There is an old ruined dam at Ranagatta, apparently designed to carry water from the river to the Halebid tank, by a large channel, called Sangidevar k\u00e1lve, the embankment of which is 15 to 20 feet high in some places.\n\nThe soils both wet and dry are poor in the west, gradually improving towards the east, until in the neighbourhood of Halebid dark soils of the best description are found, producing good crops of sugar-cane in the wet and often two crops in the year in the dry soils. Exceptions, however, occur, as in the stretch of black soil near Belur, and the poor high-lying dry soils near Halebid itself. A peculiar feature in the landscape in the south-west is the steep demarcation between high-lying and low-lying ground. Instead of the former merging gradually into the latter, it terminates abruptly, presenting an almost perpendicular scarp, varying in height from 50 to 100 feet. As the soil is very friable landslips are not uncommon, especially in the rains. In addition to the usual wet and dry crops, in the eastern hoblis tobacco is largely grown, of fair quality. In the Maln\u00e1d, to the west, are several coffee plantations which occupy the isolated patches of forest called ud\u00fave. Of 13,000 acres under coffee, 1,550 are held by Europeans. Brass pots are made by the Jains at Tagare and other places. In the neighbourhood of Halebid is found the potstone which has been used\nin the elaborate carvings of the temples. The principal mart for this taluq and the surrounding country is Bikk\u00f3d, the transactions at which are valued at Rs. 4,000 a week or 2 lakhs a year.\n\nThe taluq was in the heart of the Hoysala kingdom, the capital, Dorasamudra, being situated at Halebid. Subsequent to the destruction of that city, in the beginning of the 14th century, Belur was included in the province of Balam, which the Vijayanagar kings conferred, first upon Vina R\u00e1mappa, and then upon the Aigur chiefs. From these it was taken by Sivappa N\u00e1yak of Ikkeri, who bestowed it on the fugitive king of Vijayanagar, but in 1690 it was taken by Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1877. The old rates of assessment seem to have been based partly on the Vijayanagar varaha shist and partly on Sivappa N\u00e1yak's rekha shist. It appears that no assessment was formerly demanded on account of dry land, except in a few villages to the south, where the hakkal or dry land was included in the assessment of wet lands. The area of the taluq in 1877 was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 79,311; wet, 28,853; garden, 1,439) | ... | ... | 109,603 |\n| Unculturable (including grazing lands, roads, &c.) | ... | ... | 54,079 |\n| In\u00e1m (27,158); 9 Amrit Mahal k\u00e1vals (16,530) | ... | ... | 43,688 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **207,370** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 37,148 acres, of which 32,495 were dry land. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,84,679 and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,13,496.\n\nThe average rainfall at Belur for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| 0.19 | 0.37 | 1.66 | 3.18  | 3.83| 6.35 | 3.07 | 2.65 | 5.70  | 2.33| 0.55 | 29.88|\n\nAccording to another register for 10 years the average is 31. But in the west of the taluq it is about 80 inches.\n\nThe Hassan-Chikmagalur road passes Belur, whence there are roads north-east through Halebid to the railway at Banavar, west through Mudgere to the B\u00fand ghat, and south to Sakleshpur.\n\n**Belur.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 10' N. lat., 75\u00b0 55' E. long., on the right bank of the Yagache, 28 miles south-west of the railway at Banavar, and 24 miles north-west of Hassan, on the Hassan-Chikmagalur road.

Its sanctity is due to the celebrated temple of Chenna Kesava, erected and endowed by the Hoysala king Vishnuvarddhana, on the occasion of his exchanging the Jain faith for that of Vishnu, in the beginning of the 12th century. The carving with which the temple is decorated rivals in fertility of design and perfection of finish that of the Halebid temple, and is attributed to the same master hand, that of the famous Jakan\u00e1chari. The incident related under Kaidala (Tumk\u00far District) would indicate that it was nearly his last undertaking. The annual festival, held for five days in April, is attended by 5,000 people. The image of Chenna Kesava is said to have been brought from the Baba Budan hills, but by some mistake that of the goddess being left behind, and her wounded pride forbidding the removal afterwards, the god is under the necessity of making a trip occasionally to the Baba Budan hills to see her. On these occasions he is said to make use of a large pair of slippers kept for the purpose in the temple. When they are worn out, it devolves upon the chucklers of Channagiri and Basvapatna (Shimoga District), to whom the fact is revealed in a dream, to provide new ones; in order to present which they are allowed to enter the courtyard of the temple.\n\nThe later history of Belur has already been given under the taluq.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892\u20133. | 1893\u20134. | 1894\u20135. | 1895\u20136. |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income          | 1,905   | 2,255   | 2,248   | 3,330   |\n| Expenditure     | 1,806   | 3,342   | 3,664   | 4,650   |\n\nChannar\u00e1yapatna.\u2014A taluq in the east.

An elevated ridge runs along the north from east to west, a few small streams from which flow north and east to the Shinsha. It is a generally open and undulating country. Except a low ridge on the western boundary, the principal hills are the isolated peaks at the Jain settlement of Sravana-Belgola. The soil is mostly fertile and produces the usual wet and dry crops, but along the western border is generally shallow and very stony. The soil is of the ordinary light red and sandy description, going through few gradations, except near Nuggihalli where there is some soil of a colour approaching black. The pasture lands are very extensive and support large herds of cattle and sheep. There is a little irrigation from the Hole-Narsipur north channel. A considerable amount of the labour in the coffee districts is drawn from this taluq. It may prove to be rich in minerals, and gold-mining has recently been revived. Sravana-Belgola is noted for the manufacture of brass vessels. Small articles of silk are made by Muhammadans at Channar\u0101yapatna.\n\nThis part of the District, after the overthrow of the Hoysala power, became one of the possessions of the chief of Hole-Narsipur. It was conquered by Chama R\u0101ja Wodeyar in 1633, and annexed to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1885. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 140,124; wet, 7,399; garden, 4,841) | ... | ... | 152,364 |\n| Unculturable (roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 77,384 |\n| Inam (2,939); k\u0101vals (14,640) | ... | ... | ... | ... | 17,579 |\n| Total acres | ... | ... | 247,327 |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 51,742 acres, 50,586 being dry land.

About the year 1600 Lakshmappa Nayak, the chief of Hole-Narsipur, took the place from Puttagirija the Hebb\u00e1r, and bestowed it as a j\u00e1gir on his own son Channa R\u00e1ya, whom he had obtained by favour of the god Channar\u00e1yaswami, a name of Vishnu. To this deity a temple was erected, and the town was called Channar\u00e1yapattana.\n\nThe fort was built by a chief named Dodda Basavaiya, and when captured by Chama R\u00e1ja Wodeyar of Mysore in 1633, was in possession of the chief of Hole-Narsipur. It was subsequently re-built by Haidar Ali, with a wet moat and traverse gateways, having suffered much in repeated attacks from the Mahrattas.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 1,007  | 1,402  | 1,222  | 1,967  |\n| Expenditure     | 1,109  | 2,250  | 1,367  | 2,433  |\n\n**Garudangiri.**\u2014A conspicuous old hill-fort, 3,680 feet above the level of the sea, on the boundary of the District, about 7 miles north-east of Banavar. It was originally called Nonabanakal, but received the present name on being fortified in 1660 by the R\u00e1ja of Mysore, in order to be a protection to the frontier on that side, then overrun with jungle. In 1770 it was occupied by the Mahrattas under Tryambak M\u00e1ma, after their defeat of Haidar at Chinkuruli, but was restored to Mysore on the conclusion of peace. On the death of Tipu Sultan it\nwas delivered up to the British, and was garrisoned for some time by the Mysore troops.\n\n**Grama.**\u2014A large village, 7 miles east of Hassan, on the Bangalore road. From 1882 to 1894 it was the head-quarters of a sub-taluq of the same name, under Hassan taluq, comprising the Grama, Dudda and Kat\u1e6d\u0101ya hoblis. It is now the head-quarters of the Grama hobli, and since 1892 a municipality. Population 2,184.\n\nFrom inscriptions it appears that it was founded in the 12th century by S'\u00e1ntala Devi, queen of the Hoysala king Vishnuvarddhana, and was at first named S'\u00e1ntigr\u00e1ma.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 414    | 428    | 774    |\n| Expenditure     | 241    | 375    | 782    |\n\n**Halebid.**\u2014A village in the Belur taluq, 18 miles south of the railway at Banavar, and 11 miles east of Belur, on the Belur-Banavar road. Head-quarters of the Halebid hobli. Population 1,461.\n\nThe village of *hale-bidu*, old capital, marks the site of the ancient city of Dorasamudra, Dv\u00e1rasamudra or Dv\u00e1ravatipur\u00e1, the wealthy capital of the Hoysala kings, founded early in the 11th century. The city was taken by the Muhammadan general Kafur in 1310, and plundered of immense wealth. In 1326 another Muhammadan army carried off what remained, and totally destroyed the city. The fallen king, after this event, took up his residence first at Tondanur (Tonnur, Mysore District), and then at other places far to the east of his dominions in the Tamil country.\n\nThe splendour of the city is attested not only by the account of the fabulous riches obtained from its conquest, as related by Muhammadan historians, but by its architectural monuments, which still rank among the masterpieces of Hindu art. The most remarkable of these are the Hoysalesvara and K\u00e9d\u00e1resvara temples.\u00b9 The latter was the smaller, and a gem of art. But a banyan-tree, which had rooted itself in the *vim\u00e1na* or tower over the sanctum, dislodged the stones, and many of the figures thrust out of the walls have been removed to the Museum in Bangalore. The large Hoysalesvara temple, though never completed, is in better preservation. The marvellous elaboration of ornamental sculpture round the walls, and the general architectural effect, have elicited from the highest authority on these subjects\u00b2 the opinion that \"taken altogether it is perhaps the building on which the advocate of\n\n\u00b9 See Vol. I, p. 514.\n\u00b2 Fergusson, Hist. of Arch.\nHindu architecture would desire to take his stand.\u201d The critique will be found more at length in another part of this work.\n\nThe plain Jain bastis, though cast completely into the shade by the ornate Saiva temples, are also striking buildings. The city is said to have originally contained no less than 720. Three only now remain, those of Adin\u00e1thesvara, S\u00e1ntisvara and P\u00e1rsvan\u00e1thesvara, the latter of which is the largest.\n\nAround a small hill called Benne-gudda are pointed out portions of the old wall, and the site of the palace to the east. South of the palace was the \u00e1ne gundi or elephant pit. The position of the royal stables is indicated by the fields still entered in the revenue accounts as the l\u00e1ya (stables). Part of an aqueduct, by which the city was supplied with water from the Yagache, may be seen on the south. The balapam or potstone used in the sculptures is found on the Pushpagiri, or hill of flowers, near the town.\n\nThe only part that survived the general ruin was the potters\u2019 street, which it is said was spared on account of the shelter afforded by a potter to a distracted princess, whose two sons being beheaded at the instance of a royal mistress they had slighted, and herself forbidden the city, she cursed it as well as the royal family, predicting the speedy destruction of both, save only the potters\u2019 street.\n\nHaranhalli.\u2014A town in Arsikere taluq, 5 miles south of the kasba, on the Hassan-Arsikere road. Till 1882 head-quarters of a taluq of the same name. It is now the head-quarters of the H\u00e1ranhalli hobli, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|-------|\n| Hindus ...         | 960    | 980      | 1,940 |\n| Muhammiadans...    | 133    | 151      | 284   |\n| Total ...          | 1,093  | 1,131    | 2,224 |\n\nThe fort is said to have been erected in 1070 by a chief named Somesvara Raya. The large Nagati tank was named after his daughter. There are several fine temples, partly in ruins, and other monuments, without the fort walls, which indicate the existence of a large city in former times. The inscriptions that are legible belong to the Hoysala rule. The later history of the place is the same as that of Arsikere (see above).\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income ...       | 453     | 527     | 601     | 1,233   |\n| Expenditure ...  | 490     | 823     | 668     | 1,618   |\n**Hassan.**\u2014A taluq in the centre.

The taluq was formed as at present in 1882, with Gr\u00e1ma as a sub-taluq, the latter comprising the Gr\u00e1ma, Dudda and Katt\u00e1ya hoblis. In 1894 A'l\u00far was made the sub-taluq in place of Gr\u00e1ma, and includes the A'l\u00far, P\u00e1lya and Ponn\u00e1thpura hoblis.\n\nThe Hemavati forms the southern boundary. The Yagache flows through the west from north to south, receives most of the small streams, and joins the Hemavati near Gor\u00far. But a considerable water-course, running down through the east to the Hemavati, forms a chain of numerous tanks. The Yagache is dammed near Hassan, and supplies the Halvagal channel, 6 miles long. In the north is a group of hills called S\u00edge guddla. There are some low hills on the south, separating the taluq from Arkalgud and Hole Narsipur.\n\nThe south-western hoblis are partly Maln\u00e1d, P\u00e1lya being the most so, with fine breezy uplands, presenting in some parts the appearance of grassy open downs, and in others being covered with small scrub jungle. The climate and soils here are well suited to the production of rice of a superior description, but sugar-cane is raised only under special large tanks. Dry cultivation is little esteemed, and a crop once in three years is often deemed sufficient. Some 1,285 acres have been taken up for coffee. In the east of the taluq the villages are far apart, with extensive stretches of waste land which support large flocks of sheep. The soils,\nwhich run through many gradations, from light sandy grey to rich dark brown, are superior in the vicinity of the Yagache river, but deteriorate on the uplands as the river is receded from. R\u00e1gi is the staple crop in dry lands and rice in wet, with a fair proportion of sugar-cane. Dodr\u00e1gi is grown in the east, but gid-r\u00e1gi in the west, which admits in good years of an after crop of horse-gram. Fields in the east not adapted for r\u00e1gi are largely sown with chillies, between rows of castor-oil.\n\nHassan is the carrying taluq for the coffee districts which border it on the west, and supplies nearly all the carts required in this and the Kadur District. There is much good pasturage, and the large S\u00edge gudd\u00e1 k\u00e1val, belonging to the Amrit Mahal, will maintain 2,500 head of cattle.\n\nThe taluq was included successively in the Chalukya and Hoysala dominions. It afterwards formed part of Balam and shared the fortunes of that province. It was incorporated with Mysore in 1690 by treaty with Ikkeri.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into the A'l\u00far, P\u00e1lya and Chik-Kanag\u00e1l hoblis in 1881, and into the remainder of the taluq in 1882. The area was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 136,570; wet. 25,943; garden, 3,037) | ... | ... | 165,550 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 61,160 |\n| In\u00e1m (19,423); 26 k\u00e1vals (40,208) | ... | ... | ... | ... | 59,631 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | 286,341 |\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 63,537 acres, of which 59,107 were dry land. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,78,876, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,23,693.\n\nThe average rainfall at Hassan and Gr\u00e1ma for 26 years (1870\u201395) and at the other station for 3 years (1893\u20135) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Hassan | 0\u00b012 | 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b039 | 2\u00b053 | 3\u00b074 | 3\u00b025 | 5\u00b030 | 2\u00b049 | 3\u00b015 | 7\u00b053 | 2\u00b016 | 0\u00b057 | 31\u00b025 |\n| Gr\u00e1ma | 0\u00b001 | 0\u00b012 | 0\u00b022 | 1\u00b064 | 4\u00b055 | 2\u00b055 | 4\u00b007 | 1\u00b062 | 5\u00b003 | 5\u00b050 | 2\u00b040 | 1\u00b006 | 28\u00b077 |\n| Kattaya | \u2014 | 0\u00b007 | 0\u00b045 | 2\u00b099 | 4\u00b077 | 4\u00b079 | 2\u00b093 | 2\u00b018 | 1\u00b066 | 9\u00b003 | 3\u00b080 | \u2014 | 32\u00b067 |\n\nThe fall in the west is probably about 65 inches.\n\nThe Bangalore-Mangalore trunk road by the Manjarabad Ghat runs through Hassan, and from this town there are roads north to the railway at Arsikere\u2014with a branch from Dudda north-east to the railway at Tiptur,\u2014north-west to Belur, south to Arkalgud\u2014with a branch from Katt\u00e1ya west to Hoskote,\u2014and south-east to Hole Narsipur.\nHassan.\u2014The chief town of the District, situated in 13\u00b0 N. lat., 76\u00b0 9' E. long., 25 miles south by west of the railway at Arsikere, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus            | 2,448 | 2,469   | 4,917 |\n| Muhammadans       | 573   | 607     | 1,180 |\n| Jains             | 125   | 143     | 268   |\n| Christians        | 113   | 161     | 274   |\n| Jews              | 6     | 9       | 15    |\n| **Total**         | **3,265** | **3,389** | **6,654** |\n\nThe original town was at the adjacent village of Chennapatna. This was founded in the 11th century by Bukkana or Bukka Nayak, said to be an officer despatched by the Chola king to put down the depredations committed by neighbouring petty chieftains. In this enterprise he succeeded so well that he received permission to erect a fort and petta on the site of his encampment. He named the place Chennapatna, the handsome city, and made the large tank between it and Hassan. After a prosperous rule of 43 years Bukka Nayak died, and was succeeded by his son B\u00fachi Nayak, who after 6 years was followed by his son Chennappa Nayak, and he after 45 years by his son B\u00facha Nayak. The latter died after 50 years without leaving male issue.\n\nChennapatna was then conferred by the Hoysala kings on Sanjiva Krishnappa Nayak. On one occasion a hare which he had started took to the town and entered the gates. While in great distress at this bad omen, H\u00e1sinamma, the smiling goddess, appeared to him, and directed him to build a fort on the spot whence the hare had started, and where he would find her image. This he did and named the place H\u00e1vana after her. The present town therefore dates from the end of the 12th century. The sthala pur\u00e1na derives its name from a contraction of Simh\u00e1sana-pura, and hither Janam\u00e9jaya is said to have come.\n\nHassan was included in the province of Balam and partook of its fortunes until annexed to Mysore in 1690, during the reign of Chikka Deva Raja Wodeyar.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 7,994  | 8,123  | 9,568  | 9,876  |\n| Expenditure     | 8,060  | 13,287 | 8,930  | 10,358 |\nHemavati.\u2014Golden, also called in Kannada Yenne hole, oily or shining river. One of the chief tributaries of the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri. It rises just beyond the limits of the District, at J\u00e1vali, near Melbang\u00e1di, in Mudgere taluq, and flowing south is joined near the head of the Bund Ghat by the S\u00f3m\u00e1vati. Continuing south through Manjarabad, past Sakleshpur, it receives from the south the Aigur river, near the place of that name, and the Kete halla at the Coorg frontier. Thence turning east, it crosses a small portion of Coorg, and re-entering Mysore receives from the north the Yagache near Gorur. With an easterly course it flows past Hole Narsipur to Ganni, some distance beyond which it bends round to the south, and runs down into the K\u00e1v\u00e9ri, near Hoskote, in Krishnar\u00e1jpet taluq. Its length within this District is 113 miles.\n\nIts waters are dammed in several places, from each of which channels are led off. Only two are now in this District. The first dam is the Srir\u00e1m\u00fa\u00e9var anicut in Hole Narsipur taluq. This work was originally constructed of rough stone by Dan\u00e1yaka Hebb\u00e1raiya in 1533. It afterwards breached, and was three times repaired during the administration of the Dewan Purnaiya. The dam was 1,000 feet long and 24 feet high. In 1863 it again breached, since which a new anicut has been erected by the Public Works Department, at a cost of Rs. 2,78,504, a little below the former spot, on the principle now adopted of making the dam water-tight, which none of the others are. Two channels are led off from it, the Uttara or North channel, $47\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length, on the left bank; and the Dakshina or South channel, 12 miles long, on the right. The former irrigates 4,413 acres, and the latter, which runs through the town of Hole Narsipur, 606 acres. The Madapur anicut, 10 miles below Hole Narsipur, breached in 1863. The channels irrigated 417 acres.\n\nThe H\u00e9m\u00e1vati is crossed at Sakleshpur by a fine iron girder bridge of four spans, formed by lattice girders, each 120 feet long and resting on cylinders. It was finished in 1870 at a cost of Rs. 1,94,620.\n\nThe river is fabled to be the daughter of Daksha and wife of Isvara. The insult put upon the latter in not being invited to Daksha\u2019s sacrifice led to her casting herself into the fire, from which, when rescued, she was of the colour of gold (hema). Becoming incarnate as the daughter of Himavat, she performed penance with the view of being reunited to Isvara, who appeared to her and directed her to take the form of a river for the good of the world.\n\nHole Narsipur.\u2014A taluq in the south-east. Area 233 square miles. Head-quarters at Hole Narsipur. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\u2014\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Hole Narsipur 5,758; Hariharapura 1,255.\n\nThe H\u00e9m\u00e1vati runs through the taluq from west to east, and then turning south, forms a good part of the eastern boundary. The channels drawn from it are, the North channel of $47\\frac{1}{2}$ miles, and the South channel of 12 miles, both led off from the Srir\u00e1mad\u00e9var dam. Another dam, the M\u00e1d\u00e1pur, is breached. Near Hole Narsipur are a few isolated hills. Except for the channel irrigation, the taluq may be described as sterile. As the river is receded from, especially to the south, the uplands become bleak and unpromising. Even under the channels the soils are not very good, and in the taluq generally they are decidedly poor.\n\nThe taluq seems to have been the possession in the 12th century of a chief named Narasimha Nayak, who also owned Channar\u00e1yapatna. It was conquered from his descendants in 1667 by Dodda Deva Raja of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1884.

The Hemavati flows from the north-eastern angle down a part of the eastern border, and then crosses the taluq to the southern border, where it turns east, separating the taluq from Coorg. Near Aigur it receives the Aigur river; and on the Coorg frontier the Kete halla from the south. The western waters of the taluq flow down the Ghats to the Netravati in South Canara.\n\n\u00b9 The principal beauty lies in the wonderful contrasts which may be seen at a single glance. Scenery stern, rugged and precipitous is always to be enjoyed; but when you can contrast it, in almost a single glance, with the softest features of an English park landscape, the effect is heightened to an extraordinary degree. Even amongst the hills themselves the contrasts are very striking, and nature seems to have furnished in a single group every variety of mountain conceivable. In Europe the Pyrenees are the Pyrenees, and the Cheviots the Cheviots, with one common feature pervading each range of hills. But from a piece of elevated land not far from the spot where Arthur Wellesley pitched his camp of occupation, may be seen a complete amphitheatre of frontier mountains, presenting the greatest variety of character; one an overhanging precipice of rock, from which you may drop a stone thousands of feet into the gorge below; the next all grass, and softly rounded at the summit with cattle grazing on the slopes; a third rising abruptly into a pointed peak, with feathery strips of jungle clothing the lower ravines, and extending far up the mountain-side; while to the north of the group stretches a barren, serrated, rocky range, which in turn is broken by hills of a milder type.\u2014Elliot, Experiences of a Planter, I, 42.\nThe soil on the hills is generally of a rich deep red, while in the valleys it is sometimes red and sometimes approaches to black. The grain principally cultivated is rice, which grows most luxuriantly in the valleys and fields cut in terraces on their sides, and in the western parts double crops are regularly raised. At the head of each valley is usually a small tank, with a common mud embankment, which serves to collect a little water from the spring rising above it, to be used when the rains hang off; but artificial irrigation is generally rendered superfluous by the exceeding abundance of the rains. Dry cultivation is found to the east of the river. To the west scattered patches of r\u00e1gi may be met with, but the practice is to grow it only once in 2 or 3 years or at even longer intervals.\n\nThe cultivation of coffee has assumed great importance. Though only half a century old, it has already, by attracting the investment of European capital and the settlement of European planters, changed the face of the country and revolutionised the old feudal customs and immunities of this region. Cardamoms are also cultivated in the western parts.\n\nThe old name of this part of the country was Balam, said to be derived from bala, strength. The history of the province has already been given, and the succession of N\u00e1yaks.\n\nWhen the Aigur chief fled to Coorg in 1792, on the withdrawal of the British forces, he was invited back by Tipu Sultan and granted an estate yielding a revenue of 5,000 pagodas, composed of the mandes of Karodi, Yesal\u00far, Aigur, Bisale, and Uchangi. The remainder of the territory of Balam was annexed to Mysore, and a fort erected on one of the central heights for a garrison. The country being enveloped in fog when the Sultan inspected the works, he is said to have called it from that circumstance Manjar\u00e1b\u00e1d, \u201cthe abode of fog\u201d (manju).\n\nManjar\u00e1b\u00e1d proper consisted of 6 n\u00e1ds, sub-divided into 36 mandes. Each mande had a patel, and one of these in each n\u00e1d was the N\u00e1d Patel, a position of much local weight and influence. The senior N\u00e1d Patel was called the Shime Gauda, and had the precedence. Three of the n\u00e1d patels were Ling\u00e1yits, and the other three Hale Wokkalu, ancient farmers. The mande and gr\u00e1ma patels were Devar Makkalu, God\u2019s children. The slaves, now free, were called Hale Makkalu, ancient children, and Holeyaru.\n\nThe houses of the patels are generally fortified, and in some instances surrounded with a deep fosse. Within these precincts they still maintain much of the authority they formerly exercised as feudal chiefs, each farm being complete in itself, and in respect to the requirements of daily life independent of its neighbours. Cloths, blankets,\nhousehold utensils and such other articles as cannot be made up or manufactured in the house, are readily procured at the fairs held in different parts.\n\nThe patels and head men are a fine manly race, very superior to those of the plains. Their usual dress is a black cumbly, passed round the body and fastened over the left shoulder, leaving the right arm free. The waist is girded with a similar article, or with a cloth, generally dark blue with a white stripe. The turbans are mostly white, or dark blue with a small gold edging. The labourers have a similar dress of coarser material and usually wear a leather skull-cap. All classes carry a knife, and few are without a matchlock or musket.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1882. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 34,395; wet, 40,220; garden, 315) | ... | ... | 74,930 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 173,603 |\n| 20 coffee estates and 1 state forest | ... | ... | 24,373 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **272,906** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 20,086 acres, of which 15,917 were dry land. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,08,087, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,33,457.\n\nThe average rainfall at Sakleshpur for 26 years (1870\u201395) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| 0\u00b010 | \u2014    | 0\u00b071 | 2\u00b041 | 5\u00b017 | 15\u00b051 | 28\u00b012 | 14\u00b090 | 5\u00b089  | 6\u00b089 | 3\u00b006 | 0\u00b079 | ... 83\u00b055 |\n\nBut in the vicinity of the Ghats the average is considerably over 200 inches, diminishing every few miles to the east, until on the eastern border it is from 60 to 70 inches. At Hulhalli estate it is 120\u00b025; at Byakarvalli estate 110\u00b026; at Agalhatti estate 85\u00b014; at Lakkunda estate 60\u00b051.\n\nThe Manjarabad Ghat road from Hassan crosses the taluq through Sakleshpur; and the Bisale Ghat road runs through the south. The taluq is intersected longitudinally by a road from M\u00fadgere through Sakleshpur to Kodlipet and Arkalgud, giving off cross roads to Vang\u00far, to Yesalurpet, and by Kenchammana Hoskote to P\u00e1lya and Belur, and to Hassan.\n\n**Sakleshpur.**\u2014A town on the right bank of the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati, situated in 12\u00b0 57' N. lat., 75\u00b0 51' E. long., 24 miles west of Hassan, on the Bangalore-Mangalore road. Head-quarters of the Manjarabad taluq, and a municipality.\n\n1 By European coffee planters often called Sucklasspore.\nIt owes its importance to the spread of coffee cultivation, for the traffic connected with which the H\u00e9mavati has been spanned at this point by an iron girder bridge, leading to the Manjarabad Ghat road, over which trade finds an outlet to the port of Mangalore. The town derives its name from a temple on the bank of the river, dedicated to Sakalesvara (\u015bakala Isvara, the fragmentary Isvara, the linga having a small chip or dent).\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 1,961  | 2,875  | 2,953  | 5,297  |\n| Expenditure    | 1,622  | 5,473  | 4,392  | 7,445  |\n\nSathalli.\u2014A village in the Hassan taluq, 10 miles south-west of the chief town. Population 795.\n\nThe village is interesting as being the centre of a Christian agricultural community, which had its origin in the labours of the well-known Abb\u00e9 Dubois. Mr. Bowring says\u00b9: \u201cThere are twelve villages in the neighbourhood almost entirely inhabited by Christians, numbering about 1,000 souls. They are what are called caste Christians, that is to say, while following the Christian belief in all matters touching their faith and morals, they preserve their ancient social customs in everything which does not trench upon religion; and in respect to degrees of relationship in marriages and to succession to property have the same rules as their neighbours of the same caste who are not Christians.\u201d Attached to the church is a convent, where girls are taught by native nuns. There is a separate school for boys. The priests have also established a dispensary from which they supply medicine gratis to all comers.\n\nSravana-Belgola.\u2014An important village, between two rocky hills in the Channarayapatna taluq, 8 miles south east of the kasba. Headquarters of the hobli of the same name, and since 1893 a municipality.\n\nPopulation 1,763.\n\n\u00b9 Eastern Experiences, 82.\nIt is the chief seat of the Jain sect, being the residence of the principal guru. At the summit of Vindhya betta or Indra betta, 3,250 feet above the level of the sea, and about 400 feet above the village below, is the colossal statue of Gomatesvara, 57 feet high and surrounded with numerous sacred buildings. On Chandra betta there are also many temples, and between the hills a splendid tank (bel-gola). A considerable trade is carried on in brass utensils.\n\nAccording to the tradition of the Jains, Bhadrab\u00e1hu, one of the sruta-kevali, as the immediate successors of the personal disciples of their founder Vardham\u00e1na or Mah\u00e1vira are called, died here in a cave (still pointed out) on Chandra betta, while leading an emigration to the south from Ujjani, to escape a dreadful famine of 12 years' duration, which he had prognosticated. He is said to have been accompanied as his chief attendant by the celebrated emperor Chandra Gupta, who had abdicated the throne and, in accordance with Jain rules, adopted the life of a hermit. These events, which are borne out by rock inscriptions of great antiquity, though without a date, must be assigned to the third century B.C. The grandson of Chandra Gupta, it is said, paid a visit to the spot with an army, out of whose encampment arose the town of Sravana-Belgola, or Belgola of the Sravanas\u2014i.e., the Jains. The oldest basti on the hill is one dedicated to Chandra Gupta.\n\nThe gigantic statue was erected, as inscribed at its foot, by Ch\u00e1munda R\u00e1ya, probably in 983. He was the minister and general of the Ganga king R\u00e1chamalla. The name of the sculptor may have been Aritto Nemi. The surrounding enclosures were erected, as also inscribed at the foot of the statue, by Ganga R\u00e1ya, general of the Hoysala king Vishnuvarddhana. The image is nude and stands erect, facing the north, being visible for many miles round the country. The face has a serene expression; the hair is curled in short spiral ringlets all over the head, while the ears are long and large. The figure is treated conventionally, the shoulders being very broad, the arms hanging straight down the sides with the thumbs turned outwards, the waist small. From the knee downwards the legs are somewhat dwarfed. The feet are placed on the figure of a lotus. Representations of ant-hills rise on either side, with figures of a creeping plant springing from them, which twines over the thighs and the arms, terminating in a tendril with bunches of fruit. These symbolise the complete spiritual abstraction of a yati, absorbed and motionless during his long period of penance. Though by no means elegant, the image is not wanting in majestic and impressive grandeur. It was probably cut out of a rock which projected high above the hill, or the top of the hill itself may have been cut\naway. The figure has no support above the thighs. Though so old, the stone looks almost as fresh as if newly quarried. Within the enclosure around are 72 small statues of a similar description in compartments.\n\nThat Sravana-Belgola was an acknowledged seat of learning in early times is proved from the fact that a priest from there, named Akajanka Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, was in 788 summoned to the court of Hemasit\u0101la at K\u0101nchi, where having confuted the Buddhists in public disputation, he was instrumental in gaining their expulsion from the south of India to Ceylon. The temple was subsequently endowed by Narasimha and other Hoysala kings, but at the time of the conversion of Vishnuvarddhana to the Vaishnava faith by the reformer R\u0101m\u0101nuj\u0101ch\u0101r\u012b, the Jains suffered much persecution. Their influence at court, however, enabled them to bring about a compromise, which resulted, in the time of Bukka R\u0101ya of Vijayanagar, in a declaration of tolerance, which was inscribed on stones and set up in public places. One is still at Sravana-Belgola and another at Kalya (Magadi taluq). The Jain establishment, which received the support of the Mysore Rajas as well as of the dynasties preceding them, was shorn, in common with others, of many of its privileges and emoluments by Tipu Sultan, and is now in a reduced condition. The place abounds in inscriptions, some of the most interesting of which are those cut in the face of the rock on Chandra b\u0113\u1e6d\u1e6da, in ancient characters a foot long.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | ...    | 347    | 359    |\n| Expenditure    | ...    | 260    | 385    |\n\nYagache or Badari, the chief tributary of the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati. It rises in the B\u00e1ba Budan hills, and flowing south, receives the Berinji halla from the west, passes the town of Belur, and joins the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati near Gorur in the Hassan taluq. Yagache in Kannada and Badari in Sanskrit is the name of the jujube tree (*zizyphus*). There are three dams on the Yagache in this District, from which irrigation channels are led off. The Bomdihalli dam in Belur taluq, which is the first, provides irrigation for 290 acres from a channel of $4\\frac{1}{2}$ miles. The Halvagal dam, three miles west of Hassan, gives rise to a channel 6 miles long and irrigates 184 acres; and the Chengavalli dam, 3 miles from the point of confluence with the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati, also feeds a channel 9 miles long and irrigates 281 acres.\n\n1 The whole, to the number of 144, have been published by me, with translations, in *Inscriptions at Sravana-Belgola*.\n\n2 For a legend connected with the name, see Vol. I, p. 470.\nKADUR DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014The Kadur District lies in the west of the State of Mysore, and was formed in 1863, with head-quarters at Kadur, afterwards removed to Chikmagalur. The District is situated between $12^\\circ 56'$ and $13^\\circ 58'$ north latitude and between $75^\\circ 8'$ and $76^\\circ 25'$ east longitude. Its greatest length is, from east to west, about 86 miles. Its greatest breadth, from north to south, is about 55 miles.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 2,793 square miles. Of the whole extent 763 square miles are under cultivation, and 1,740 square miles uncultivable.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by the Shimoga District, on the north-east by the Chitraldroog District, on the east by the Tumkur District, and on the south by the Hassan District. On the west the boundary is the chain of the Western Ghats, which separate it from South Kanara of the Madras Presidency.\n\nSub-Divisions.\u2014It is sub-divided into the following taluqs. Banavar taluq was abolished in 1882 and divided between Kadur taluq and Arsikere taluq (Hassan District). At the same time Lakvalli taluq was abolished and Yedehalli sub-taluq formed, under Koppa taluq, which also includes the Sringeri Jagir, with 5 hoblis. In 1897 Yedehalli sub-taluq was abolished and a new taluq called Bale Honnur formed.\n\n| No. | Taluq          | Area, sq. miles | No. of Hoblis | No. of Villages or Towns | Population in 1891 | Per square mile |\n|-----|----------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 1   | Bale Honnur    | 410             | 5             | 87                       | 33,186             | 80'94          |\n| 2   | Chikmagalur    | 595             | 6             | 189                      | 71,187             | 119'64         |\n| 3   | Kadur          | 561             | 6             | 319                      | 72,217             | 128'72         |\n| 4   | Koppa          |                 |               |                          |                    |                |\n|     | Sringeri Jagir |                 |               |                          |                    |                |\n| 5   | Mudgere        | 302             | 5             | 139                      | 37,249             | 123'34         |\n| 6   | Tarikere       | 459             | 6             | 246                      | 72,352             | 157'63         |\n| Total|                | 2,793           | 33            | 1,327                    | 330,063            | 118'17         |\n\nPhysical Features.\u2014The main part of the Kadur District is composed of the most mountainous region included within the limits of Mysore. Bordered on the west by the mighty Ghat range, rising at this\npart into some of the loftiest peaks between the Him\u00e1layas and the Nilagiris; supporting on its centre the stupendous barrier of the B\u00e1ba Budan chain, of even superior elevation; between these towering masses, covered with a complete network of lofty hills whose altitude at certain points, as in the magnificent Merti peak of Kalasa, renders them conspicuous landmarks even in this neighbourhood of giant heights; while ranges of more modest pretensions extend throughout the north and east:\u2014this District, with a slight exception eastwards, may truly be described as pre-eminently the Maln\u00e1d or highland region.\n\nNor are these mountain tracts wanting in all those charms of wood and water which tend to soften the harsher features of so rugged a landscape. For though the summits rear themselves bareheaded into space, the slopes are thickly clad with primeval forest, through which the shining streams thread their often headlong way, fertilising the narrow valleys and open glades, till their waters descend to the level of the larger rivers, flowing in steep and sunken channels, whence daily issue dense mists that cover the face of the country, lifting as the heat of the morning sun increases in power.\n\nIn these vast solitudes the habitations of man are few and far between. A single homestead, hidden amid the luxuriance of tropical vegetation, is often the only sign of his presence for many miles around. Roads there are (or rather, thanks to the recent exertions of Engineer officers, were) none. No wheeled conveyance disturbed the peace of the well-nigh trackless woods, save where a space, annually cleared for the occasion, allowed the car of some popular god to be drawn a couple of hundred yards and back from his shrine in the depths of the forest. All the valuable produce of the country was, and to a great extent still is, transported on the backs of cattle, the rallying sounds from the belled leaders of the drove resounding far and wide.\n\nThe eastern or Maid\u00e1n taluqs partake of the general features of that description of country in the other Districts, the transition from Maln\u00e1d to Maid\u00e1n being very abrupt and striking on approaching Lakvalli from the west.\n\nThe congeries of mountains within the area of the District, so far as they can be reduced to a system, seem to range themselves into a central north-and-south ridge, with a great loop or circle on either hand; while at the south-western angle of the District the Western Ghats make a bend inwards to the east, marking the initial point of the line which divides the northern from the southern waters of the Mysore. The main ridge above spoken of commences at Ball\u00e1lr\u00e1yandurga, and passing east of Merti gudda and Koppa-durga, separates the basin of the Bhadra from that of the Tunga, and runs up towards Mandagadde, connecting with\nthe central range of the Shimoga District. On the west of this ridge is\nthe valley in which Sring\u00e9ri stands, enclosed with a girdle of moun-\ntains; while on the east of it and beyond the right bank of the Bhadra,\nis the J\u00e1gar valley, completely environed with the B\u00e1ba Budan\nmountains, which form as it were some gigantic out-work of the mighty\nAlpine wall.\n\nThe highest point in the District, and in Mysore, is Mulaina-giri in\nthe B\u00e1ba Budans, which rises to 6,317 feet above the level of the sea.\nOf the companion heights in the same group, B\u00e1ba-Budan-giri is 6,214\nfeet, and Kalhatti-giri 6,155. The loftiest peak in the Western Ghats\nis the Kudure Mukh or Horse-face mountain, so called on account of\nits appearance from the sea, to which it presents a landmark well\nknown to navigators of that coast. Its height is 6,215 feet. Another\nconspicuous mountain in the same range is the grand Ball\u00e1r\u00e1yan-\ndurga, 4,940 feet. The Gang\u00e1m\u00fala in Var\u00e1ha parvata is 4,781,\nWoddin gudda, 5,006, and Lakke parvata, 4,662. Of greater height is\nthe superb hill of Kalasa called the Merti gu\u1e0d\u1e0da, situated in the heart\nof the mountain region to the west, and presenting, especially towards\nthe north, a grand and symmetrical outline, towering above all the\nneighbouring heights. Its summit is 5,451 feet above the sea. Of\nother prominent peaks in the District, Kanchinkal-durga is 4,081 feet,\nand Sakunagiri 4,653. Koppa durga is 2,960.\n\nThe general level of the country lying along the south of the\nB\u00e1ba Budan and neighbouring ranges, which forms the water-parting\nbetween the northern and southern river-systems, is, at the Nirv\u00e1ni\nmatha, 4,015 feet above the sea, at Chikmagalur 3,481, at Wastara\n3,531, and at Aldur 3,454. The plains to the east of the District\nand the valleys in the west are a good deal lower, with a slope to the\nnorth. Thus at Kad\u00far the height is 2,553 feet above the level of\nthe sea, and at Tarikere 2,235. At Sangamesvara it is 2,525, at\nB\u00e1le Honn\u00far 2,516, at Baggunj\u00ed katte, 2,481, at Sring\u00e9ri 2,439, and at\nHariharpur 2,379.\n\nThe principal rivers of the District are the twin streams\u2014the Tunga\nand the Bhadra, the latter running most of its course here. They both\nrise at Gang\u00e1m\u00fala in the Var\u00e1ha parvata, situated in the Western\nGhats at the point where the boundaries of the Koppa and B\u00e1le\nHonn\u00far taluqs meet. The Tunga flows north-east past Nemm\u00e1r and\nSring\u00e9ri to near Baggunj\u00ed, where it turns north by west, and passing\nHariharpur, enters the Shimoga District, making a sharp turn to the\nnorth-east at the Bhiman-katte, and so to Shimoga. The Bhadra runs\neast for some distance past Kalasa, and then, turning north-east, flows\nwith a winding course past B\u00e1le Honn\u00far and Kh\u00e1ndya to Hebbe,\nwhere, receiving the Somav\u00e1hini from the J\u00e1gar valley, it continues to Lakvalli and thence flows on to Benkipur in the Shimoga District.\n\nOf the southern streams the H\u00e9m\u00e1vati has its source at Javali in Melbang\u00e1di, but almost immediately leaves this District and enters that of Hassan. The Berinji halla in like manner rises near Anur and shortly flows into Hassan District, where it joins the Yagache. The latter has its source near Sitalmalapan Kanive in the B\u00e1ba Budan range and runs through Hiremagalur towards Belur in Hassan.\n\nOn the east of the B\u00e1ba Budan range the Gauri-halla and the Avati are twin streams, rising near the peak of Mulainagiri. The first expands into the Ayyankere lake above Sakkarepatna, and issuing thence with the name of the Veda, skirts this town and flows north-east to Kad\u00far. The other, the northern stream, forms the large Madaga tank, and the two, uniting near Kad\u00far, continue into the Chitaldroog District under the name of the Vedavati.\n\nThe largest sheets of water are the two tanks or lakes in the gorges at the eastern base of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains. The first of these, called the Ayyankere or Dodda Madaga-kere, is formed 4 miles north-west of Sakkarepatna by an embankment thrown across the river Veda, where it issues through the only outlet in the surrounding hills, a gap of about 1,700 feet in width, at the south-eastern foot of Sakunagiri. It is a beautiful expanse of water, about 7 miles in circumference, and dotted with several islands. Four channels are drawn from it, irrigating about 300 acres. The other tank, called the Madaga-kere or Kad\u00far Madaga-kere, has been similarly formed by embanking the sister stream, the Avati, at a point where the two hills called Sivanagiri and Hagrikangiri so nearly meet as to form a natural basin. The bund is 1,200 feet long.\n\nThe numerous perennial streams springing from the mountains of the District have been dammed at nearly every available point, giving rise to short channels which collectively supply a large amount of irrigation. The following table will shew the number and value of these useful works:\n\n| Name of River          | Number of dams | Acreage irrigated | Revenue in rupees |\n|------------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|\n| Tunga and tributaries  | 20             | 303               | 1,298            |\n| Bhadra                 | 18             | 325               | 1,396            |\n| H\u00e9m\u00e1vati               | 3              | 26                | 59               |\n| Yagache                | 16             | 1,941             | 22,593           |\n| Veda and Avati         | 49             | 1,568             | 31,210           |\n| Other streams          | 9              | 765               | 4,729            |\n| **Total**              | **115**        | **4,928**         | **61,285**       |\nSoils.\u2014Along the south of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains is a rich tract of black cotton soil, whose fertility, enhanced by the command of an unfailing supply of water from the hill streams, is said formerly to have given to the plain of Chikmagalur the name of Honjavanige Sime, or land flowing with gold. The higher tracts of this region are generally gravelly. Black cotton soil also prevails in the neighbourhood of Ajjampur, together with red and gravelly soils. The western parts of Tarikere contain sandy and gravelly soils. About Yegate the earth seems poor and has a white chalky appearance. More to the south the soil is adapted to the cultivation of the cocoa-nut without irrigation, as in the adjoining parts of Tumk\u00far and Chitaldroog Districts.\n\nThe soil of the Maln\u00e1d bears a general resemblance to that of the same region extending through the neighbouring Districts north and south.\n\nMinerals.\u2014Iron ore is largely obtained and smelted along the hills east of the B\u00e1ba Budan range, and those around Ubrani. Corundum is found in abundance near Kad\u00far and throughout the east. Traces of extensive old gold mines have been found in the neighbourhood of Ajjampur, and gold-mining is being revived under European management.\n\nClimate.\u2014At Chikmagalur, the head-quarters of the District, the mean annual temperature appears from the recorded observations to be between $72^\\circ$ and $73^\\circ$. The following are given as readings of the thermometer:\n\n|       | Mean. | Highest reading. | Lowest reading. |\n|-------|-------|------------------|-----------------|\n| 1891. | Max.  | Min.             |                 |\n| May   | 85    | 67              | 88              |\n| July  | 75    | 64              | 78              |\n| December | 82   | 61              | 83              |\n\n|       | Mean. | Highest reading. | Lowest reading. |\n|-------|-------|------------------|-----------------|\n| 1892. | Max.  | Min.             |                 |\n| May   | 84    | 68              | 87              |\n| July  | 76    | 63              | 78              |\n| December | 80   | 61              | 82              |\n\nSituated in what was originally a treeless plain composed of black cotton soil, the heat would often be intense but for the neighbourhood of the mountains, the streams and breezes from which tend to moderate the temperature. A broad belt of trees has been planted completely round the town to form a protection against the high winds, which at certain seasons blow unchecked with great violence across the plain. The temperature of the Maln\u00e1d districts often falls much lower, the cold in the early morning about Christmas being very sharp. Malarious jungle fevers are always prevalent at certain seasons, and neither Europeans nor natives are exempt from attacks.\nRainfall.\u2014The average annual rainfall at Chikmagalur is 35.89 inches, calculated from the figures for 26 years (1870-95), though according to another register for 16 years it is 41.72. The monthly average is given under each taluq. The average annual rate for 26 years, and for 16 years, at other taluq stations, was as in the margin.\n\nOn turning to the country lying within the Western Ghats a rainfall is recorded which far exceeds that of any other portion of Mysore, and is little less heavy than that of the wettest regions of the globe. At Hariharpur, the late head-quarters of the Koppa taluq, 166.14 inches fell in 1874. At Mudgere the fall was 193.81 in 1882, and of the coffee estates in that taluq 145.10 inches fell at Chethalli estate in 1895, and 155.9 at Kessel estate in 1892. The fall is heaviest in June, July, and August, during the south-west monsoon, the monthly average for those months being: at Koppa, 23.29, 42.9, 25.08; at Chethalli estate, 43.64, 42.98, 28.89; at Kessel estate, 30.31, 40.2, 21.11, with 10.54 in September.\n\nVegetation.\u2014The west of the District is covered with some of the best forests in the country. This is especially the case with Lakvalli, which abounds in fine teak, and has for many years supplied the whole of western Mysore and the Bellary country with that timber, grown in the forests to the north of the B\u00e1ba Budans. Throughout the J\u00e1gar valley and most of the Koppa and Mudgere taluqs is a continuous stretch of valuable forest, densely clothing the hill-sides and giving shelter to much coffee cultivation. Sholas and hanging woods occupy almost every ravine and hollow of the B\u00e1ba Budans. The loftier heights are nearly always bare of trees, but clothed with much coarse grass and the dwarf date. The tree vegetation east and south of Santaveri is as a rule poor, and, even when the soil is better and the growth fair, there is but little good and useful indigenous timber. The eastern taluqs are generally devoid of trees. The date palm (*Phoenix sylvestris*) grows profusely in parts, especially in Kadur, and the grazing is good. In the north of Tarikere are the jungles round Ubrani, which, though not yielding large timber, are valuable as affording a supply of fuel in so poorly wooded a neighbourhood. The sandal grows on the slopes of the hills leading up to the B\u00e1ba Budans from the south and east.\n\nForests.\u2014The State Forests reserved in this District are that of Lakvalli, 47 square miles in extent; Gegargudda, 9 square miles; Basavankote, 15 square miles; and Muttodi, 17 square miles. *Teak plantations* have been formed at Lakvalli and at Hebbe, the extent of each being 375 acres at the former and 9 acres at the latter. There are\nalso 3 other Forest plantations, occupying 46 acres, as well as 2 Revenue plantations. Avenue trees have been planted along 526 miles of public road; and 545 acres are occupied by 440 topes or groves, containing 15,912 trees.\n\nCultivation.\u2014The following is a general list of the crops and other products of cultivation in the District:\n\n| Kannada       | Botanical                  | English         |\n|---------------|----------------------------|-----------------|\n| **Cereals**   |                            |                 |\n| Baragu        | Panicum miliaceum          | Rice            |\n| Bhatta        | Oryza sativa               |                 |\n| Godhi         | Triticum aristatum         | Wheat           |\n| Jiraka        | Panicum semiverticillatum  |                 |\n| Jola          | Holcus sorghum             | Great millet    |\n| Navane        | Panicum italicum           | Italian millet  |\n| Ragi          | Eleusine corocana          | Ragi            |\n| Sajje         | Holcus spicatus            | Spiked millet   |\n| Same          | Panicum frumentaceum       | Little millet   |\n| **Pulses**    |                            |                 |\n| Alasandi      | Dolichos catiang           | Cow gram        |\n| Avare         | Dolichos lablab            |                 |\n| Hesaru        | Phaseolus mungo            | Green gram      |\n| Hurali        | Dolichos uniflorus         | Horse gram      |\n| Kadale        | Cicer arietinum            | Bengal gram     |\n| Togari        | Cajanus indicus            | Pigeon pea, doll|\n| Uddu          | Phaseolus minus            | Black gram      |\n| **Oil Seeds** |                            |                 |\n| Haralu        | Ricinus communis           | Castor-oil      |\n| Huchchellu or Ramtil | Guizotea oleifera | Wild gingelli   |\n| Kusum\u00e9        | Carthamus tinctorius       | Safflower       |\n| Wollellu      | Sesamum orientale          | Gingelli        |\n| **Vegetables (Native)** |                        |                 |\n| Agachi k\u00e1yi   | Corolina grandiflora       | Linseed         |\n| Arisina       | Curcuma longa              | Turmeric        |\n| Badan\u00e9 k\u00e1yi   | Solanum melongena          | Brinjal         |\n| Bend\u00e9 k\u00e1yi    | Hibiscus esculentus        |                 |\n| Bellulli      | Allium sativum             | Garlic          |\n| Genasu        | Dioscorea atuleata         | Sweet potato    |\n| H\u00e1gala k\u00e1yi   | Momordica charantia        |                 |\n| Hir\u00e9 k\u00e1yi     | Cucumis acutangulus        |                 |\n| Jirige        | Cuminum cyminum            | Cummin seed     |\n| Kottambari bija |                         | Coriander seed  |\n| Kumbala k\u00e1yi  | Cucurbita pepo             | Pumpkin         |\n| Mensina k\u00e1yi  | Capsicum annum             | Chilli          |\n| Mentya        | Trigonella forum grecum    | Fenugreek       |\n| Mulangi       | Raphanus sativus           | Radish          |\n| Nirulli       | Allium cepa                | Onion           |\n| Padavala k\u00e1yi | Trichosanthes anguina      | Snake gourd     |\n| S\u00e1sive        | Sinapis dichotoma           | Mustard         |\n| Sunti         | Anomomum zinziber          | Dry ginger      |\n| Tond\u00e9 k\u00e1yi    | Bryonia grandis            |                 |\nBesides these, many kinds of European vegetables are grown with success in parts; among which, potatoes, French beans, cabbages, beet-root and knol kohl are the most common.\n\n**Area under principal crops.**\u2014The number of acres under rice cultivation is 107,165, wheat 490, r\u0101gi 129,064, other food grains 77,087; oil seeds 12,850, sugar-cane 957, cotton 452, other fibres 106, tobacco 784, coffee 83,326, cinchona 279, fruit and vegetables 18,540, coconut and areca-nut 14,930.\n\nThe varieties of **paddy** raised in the district are fourteen, named as follows: k\u00e9sari, honusunga, kowde dod\u1e0di, kirvana, putta kirvana, kempu sanna bhatta, bil\u00e9 sanna bhatta, kussad\u00e9, kesser b\u00edr\u00e1, sul bhatta, hola muradaga, putta bhatta, kumb\u00e1r k\u00e9sari and k\u00f3di bhatta. Of these, kempu sanna bhatta, bil\u00e9 sanna bhatta and putta bhatta are esteemed the best and fetch the highest prices.\n\nThe **areca** gardens, which occupy the moist and sheltered valleys throughout the west, produce the best description of nut in the country, that of Kalasa and its neighbourhood being in especially high repute.\n\nThe **coffee** cultivation of Southern India may be said to have had its origin in this District. For the plant was first introduced, in about the 17th century, by a Muhammadan pilgrim named B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budan, who, on his return from Mecca, brought a few berries in his wallet and taking up his abode on the hills that now bear his name planted them near his hut. It was not, however, till about 1820 that the cultivation extended beyond his garden, and not till 20 years later that European enterprise was first attracted to it. One of the earliest European planters was Mr. Cannon, who formed an estate on the high range immediately to the south of the B\u00e1b\u00e1-Budan-giri, where the original coffee plants are still in existence, flourishing under the shade of the primeval forest.\n\nThe success of Mr. Cannon\u2019s experiment led to the occupation of\nground near Aigur in South Manjarabad by Mr. Green in 1843, as stated under the Hassan District. Since 1860 estates have sprung up between these points with such rapidity that European planters are settled in almost a continuous chain of estates from the south-west of Shimoga to the southernmost limits of Manjarabad, not to mention Coorg and Wainad beyond.\n\nThe coffee zone in this District is estimated to cover about 1,000 square miles, extending over the whole western portion, and of this region one-tenth or more presents, as regards soil, aspect and shade, every condition necessary for successful cultivation. Within this area there were, in 1896, 160 square miles under coffee, as per particulars in the margin. There are altogether 543 European plantations, covering an area of 33,943 acres, assessed at Rs. 44,525, and 11,753 native plantations, occupying 66,406 acres, assessed at Rs. 61,608. The total area under mature plants is 55,510 acres, and under immature plants 25,685 acres. The remainder is not planted up. The gross average yield was estimated at 241 lbs. and 177 lbs. an acre on European plantations in 1895 and 1896 respectively, and 107 lbs. on native plantations. The total produce was nearly 12 million pounds of coffee.\n\nThe cardamom grows wild in the maln\u00e1d taluqs of the District, but owing to the extension of coffee estates it is no longer plentiful, except in the Kalasa and Melbang\u00e1di maganis. Its systematic cultivation has, however, been taken up by coffee planters, and in some parts with great success. The area under cardamom is 2,126 acres.\n\nOf the cinchona plantation at Kalhatti on the B\u00e1ba Budans, and the results obtained by its cultivation, an account will be found in the section treating of that subject generally. The area under cultivation in 1895 was 279 acres, and the number of plants 127,243. The bark produced was only 150 lbs.\n\nSome casual attempts seem to have been made to introduce the tea plant, but apparently without any valuable results. So also with the mulberry. To extend the growth of foreign cotton, a farm was established at Kadur under Mr. Meppin in 1849. But after a trial for five years it was given up as having produced no adequate results. The extent of land under cotton, which is confined to Kadur and Tarikere taluqs, is 452 acres.\n\nWild Animals.\u2014The elephant is occasionally met with in Kig, Kerra and other remote parts of the Western Ghats, and bison throughout the Maln\u00e1d. Tigers, panthers, and leopards are general, and the\nshivanga or hunting leopard is sometimes to be found. Among the smaller felidae may be mentioned the tiger cat and the civet cat.\n\nThe wild boar is found all over the District and is very destructive to sugar-cane plantations, especially at the time when the young cane begins to throw out its tender shoots. The porcupine frequents all parts of the District.\n\nOf the deer tribe, elk, spotted deer and antelope are less numerous than they used to be. The iguana, the mongoose and its enemy the coffee rat (golunda eleita) are common. Of squirrels, there are the flying squirrel, the large red squirrel and the common grey squirrel. Besides the lemur and the ape, the black monkey and the grey monkey abound in the forests.\n\nBirds.\u2014The bustard is common on the plains. The wild goose, duck, teal and snipe, the jungle-fowl and spur-fowl, partridges red and black, quail, peacock, pigeons blue and green, with doves of many varieties, are general. The buzzard and vulture, with various kites and hawks, are numerous.\n\nThe wooded tracts of the Malnad abound with birds of beautiful plumage, among which are hornbills, woodpeckers, and a great variety of smaller birds, as well as parrots and the talking mina.\n\nReptiles.\u2014The cobra and the carpet-snake are the most venomous and most dreaded. Lizards are in great abundance and variety, and the bite of one kind is supposed to be poisonous. There are three kinds of scorpion general in the District; the large black rock-scorpion, the large red field-scorpion, and the little red house-scorpion. Leeches are very numerous and active during the rainy months. Spiders of immense size are found in the bamboo jungles on the banks of the Bhadra. The alligator is common in rivers and large tanks.\n\nFishes.\u2014Fishes are abundant in both rivers and tanks. Besides the ordinary tackle of rod-and-line and nets, long conical baskets, called hiruguli, made of split bamboo interlaced with rushes, are used in catching them. The finest fish are found in the Tunga and Bhadra rivers and in the Madag, Ayyankere and Keresante tanks. The mahseer, probably the best freshwater fish in India, is sometimes caught in the rivers, and reaches to the weight of 20 lbs. At the S'ringeri math and other sacred places on the banks of the rivers, fishes are daily fed and are so tame that a call will bring them in thousands to the surface. The Brahmins invariably throw the remains of their rice to the fish. Some of these are even adorned with jewellery, such as nose-rings, or earrings, and ornaments fastened to their tails.\n\nThe following are some of the principal fishes found in the District:\u2014Kuchina murl (ophiocephalus striatus), bili korava (ophio-\nDomestic Animals.\u2014The cattle of the District generally are poor in size and of inferior breed. The climate of the Malnad is very destructive to them, so much so that farmers of that region are forced to replenish their stock annually. The hardy buffalo, on the other hand, thrives in the moisture of the climate. Hence, in the plains, the she-buffalo is tended with even more care than the cow, as, apart from a large yield of milk, the sale of her male calves to purchasers from the Malnad is found to be very profitable. Though grazing is abundant in the hilly regions, it is of a coarse description, whence ragi and paddy straw are commonly given to the cattle on returning home in the evening. During the dry season in the plains, where grazing is not to be had, straw as above, with the stalks of jowari, navane, hurali, &c., are used as fodder, and even tender leaves of the date tree. These, however, afford no nourishment.\n\nThe live stock of the District consisted in 1893 of 256,722 cows, buffaloes and bullocks, 3,953 horses, ponies and donkeys, 66,943 sheep, goats and pigs.\n\nHISTORY\n\nFew spots in the wild and romantic regions of this District, which contains the sources of the Pampa or Tungabhadra, the scene of memorable transactions recorded in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, are without a story connecting them with one or other of the heroes of the great Indian epics.\n\nS'ring\u00e9ri, as might be expected of the chief seat of Saiva Brahmanism, takes precedence of all other places in its claims to antiquity and historic fame. Its name is properly Rishya-S'ringa-giri. Here was the hermitage of Vibh\u00e1n\u1e0daka, and here the birthplace of his son Rishyas'ringa, a sage adorned with horns, who plays an important part in the opening scenes of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana. He was begotten without a natural mother, and grew up in the wilderness never having seen or heard of a woman. At that time the kingdom of Anga was suffering from a great dearth, and the king Lomap\u00e1da was informed by his spiritual advisers that the only remedy lay in bringing thither the immaculate Rishyas'ringa. This, therefore, was resolved upon, and the princess S\u00e1nta to become his bride. But how to bring him was the question, for all feared lest they should alarm the unsophisticated\nyouth and incur the wrath of the stern Vibh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0daka, whose single glance could reduce them to ashes in a moment. At last the plan was agreed upon that a band of fair damsels should be sent in the disguise of hermits, who, by the attraction of their all-powerful wiles, should entice the young recluse away from his forest home. They arrive at N\u0101rve near S'ring\u00e9ri, and concealing themselves in the woods, watch for an opportunity when the father should be absent. Then issuing forth, by their sports and gambols they draw the attention of the young hermit, who, lost in wonder, directs them to his cell, duly performs the rites of hospitality and is soon bewitched with his charming guests. Next day he hastens to pay a visit to their pretended hermitage and being led on board a raft made to resemble an island is floated away in the society of his fair companions. How his approach to Anga brought rain, how he was married to the princess, how he then became the priest of king Dasaratha of Ayodhy\u0101 and performed the asvamedha or horse sacrifice, the celebration of which procured offspring to the childless monarch and resulted in the birth of R\u0101ma, all this is fully related in the B\u0101la K\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a.\n\nSakunagiri, a lofty hill on the bank of the Ayyankere near Sakkarepatna, is said to be so called from the omens (sakuna) that Hanuman, the monkey leader in R\u0101ma\u2019s army, thence obtained, which guided him to the spot where the medicinal plant Sanjivini grew, that was used to revive Lakshmana from the swoon into which he fell on being wounded by R\u0101vana.\n\nHiremagal\u016br is said to be situated in Siddha kshetra and to have been called Bh\u0101rgavapuri. It is made the scene of the celebrated sarpa y\u0101ga, or serpent sacrifice, celebrated by Janamejaya R\u0101ya in revenge for the death of his father Parikshit by the bite of a serpent. Under Shimoga District we may see that copper-plate inscriptions are there in existence professing to record grants made by Janamejaya to the Brahmans who took part in this sarpa y\u0101ga. At Hiremagal\u016br a singular stone pillar, with a spear or flame-shaped head, is shown as the y\u016bpa stambha or sacrificial post that was used on the occasion. Inscriptions at the place prove that Hiremagal\u016br was an agrah\u0101ra in the time of the Gangas, in the 9th century.\n\nLeaving the mythological period and the mention of places visited by Parasu R\u0101ma, by R\u0101ma and by Arjuna, three places in the District have traditions undoubtedly historical, though the exact period to which they relate is not clear. They, however, certainly belong to a period anterior to the rise of the Hoysala power. One of these, the ruined village of Halasur, near Lakvalli, is said to mark the site of Ratnapuri, a city founded by Vajra Maku\u1e6da R\u0101ya, the story of\nwhose two sons, Chitras\u00e9khara and Somas\u00e9khara and of the romantic adventure by which the younger obtained the hand of R\u00fap\u00e1vati or Ratn\u00e1vati, the fair princess of Nil\u00e1vati-patna (Nirgunda) and with it the succession to that kingdom, is related under the Chitaldroog District.\n\nAnother ancient capital is Sakkarepatna. Its most celebrated king appears to have been Rukm\u00e1ngada, mentioned in the Mah\u00e1 Bharata, and Hire-magal-\u00faru (elder daughter\u2019s town), and Chikka-magal-\u00faru (younger daughter\u2019s town), the estates bestowed in dowry on the princesses of his house.\n\nMore definite than these is the historical account of S\u2019ring\u00e9ri, whose celebrated m\u0101tha on the Tunga is well known to have been established by S\u2019ankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, the great Saiva reformer of the 8th century.\n\nKadambas.\u2014The west of the District appears to have been subject from very early times to the Kadambas; while part of the frontier may have been included in \u00c1luva-kheda, the territory of the \u00c1luva, \u00c1lupa, or \u00c1lu kings, who seem to have ruled in South Kanara.\n\nHombucha.\u2014The subsequent history of that part is connected with the S\u2019\u00e1ntara kings of Pomburchcha (Hombucha or Humcha, Shimoga District). In the account given of that line we see that they extended their dominions over the hill country southwards as far as Kalasa, and thence established their capital first at Sisila or Sisukali, at the foot of the Gh\u00e1ts in Mudgere, and finally at K\u00e1rkala in S. Kanara. They became at one time feudatories of the Chalukya sovereigns. But the numerous inscriptions of the K\u00e1rkala rulers with the general cognomen of Bairasu Wodeyar, surrounding the temple at Kalasa, date from the beginning of the 12th to the middle of the 16th century, those from the 14th downwards being made with permission of the Vijayanagar sovereigns.\n\nGangas.\u2014All other parts of the District were in possession of the Gangas, as testified by inscriptions which occur in various parts. As far back as the 9th century we find mention in them of Piriyamuguli and Kiriyamuguli, which are the correct names of what are now called Hirimagal\u00far and Chikmagal\u00far. There seems, therefore, no foundation for the legend which derives the names from the elder and the younger daughter (magalu) of Rukm\u00e1ngada R\u00e1ya. The muguli is a useful tree, known botanically as acacia suma.\n\nHoysalas.\u2014This District can claim the distinction of having given birth to the powerful Hoysala kings, who succeeded the Gangas, and who ruled Mysore from the 11th to the 14th centuries. For though their capital was in the Hassan District, their place of origin, Sosev\u00far or S\u2019as\u2019akapura, has been identified by me with Angadi in the south of\nthe Mudgere taluq, where the existing temple of Vasantamma no doubt represents that of the goddess V\u00e1santik\u00e1, the scene of the incident with the tiger which transformed Sala into Hoysala. Throughout the District the memorials of the Hoysala kings are abundant, especially east and south of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains, in the neighbourhood of their capital Dorasamudra (Halebid, Hassan District). To the west their inscriptions are found at Kh\u00e1ndya, and the fortified height of Bail\u00f3-R\u00e1yan durga bears witness to their rule. Aluva-khada was the early boundary of their kingdom under Vinayaditya.\n\nVijayanagar.\u2014The foundation of the next paramount power, that of Vidy\u00e1nagara, afterwards called Vijayanagara, is in some accounts ascribed to, and was certainly greatly promoted by, the sage and scholar M\u00e1dhava, entitled Vidy\u00e1ranya or forest of learning. Wilson says: \u201cBesides experience and talent M\u00e1dhava may have brought pecuniary aid to the undertaking. His title Vidy\u00e1ranya and the scope of his writings show that he was a disciple of Sankar\u00e1charya, and in all probability he was connected with the S\u2019ringagiri (S\u2019ringeri) establishment, the members of which, alarmed by the increasing numbers of the Jangamas and Jains and the approach of the Muhammadans, may have contributed their wealth and influence to the aggrandisement of the sons of Sangama.\u201d These were Bukka and Hakka or Harihara, the progenitors of the Vijayanagar line. Vidy\u00e1ranya was their father\u2019s minister.\n\nUnder the Vijayanagar empire the west of the District, save the independent estate of S\u2019ring\u00e9ri, was mostly under the rule of the Karkala chiefs; the south formed part of the territory of Balam (Manjarabad, Hassan District) belonging to the Aigur chiefs; the north-east was included in the possessions of the Basvapatna or Tarikere palegars. The greater part of the District was subsequently, in the middle of the 17th century, overrun by Sivappa N\u00e1yak, the most distinguished of the Ikk\u00e9ri or Bedn\u00far chiefs. Sri Ranga R\u00e1ya, the representative of the Vijayanagar kings, resorted to his protection, and was by him established in the government of Sakkarepatna, Belur, and the neighbourhood. Meanwhile the Basvapatna territories had fallen a prey, first to the forces of Bijapur and then to those of the Mughals, and were in 1687 absorbed in the province of Sira.\n\nMysore Rajas.\u2014The R\u00e1jas of Mysore, having in 1610 gained possession of Seringapatam and in 1687 of Bangalore, now carried their conquests to the west, and between 1690 and 1694 subdued all the south of the District. In the latter year a treaty was concluded between Mysore and Ikk\u00e9ri, by which, with the exception of Aigur and\nVast\u00e1ra, the remaining conquests were retained as a part of the Mysore kingdom.\n\nHaidar Ali in 1761 took possession of Sira, and after receiving or forcing the submission of its various dependencies, planned his expedition against Bedn\u00far. This capital was taken in 1763, and the terrified R\u00e1ni escaped to Ball\u00e1l-r\u00e1yan-durga. Thither a detachment was sent in pursuit, by which she was taken prisoner and conveyed to Maddagiri (Tumk\u00far District), appointed as the place of her confinement. By this conquest the Mysore dominion was extended over the whole of the Kadur country.\n\nAfter the downfall of Tipu Sultan and the restoration of the Hindu r\u00e1j, the District formed part of the Nagara R\u00e1yada or Sub\u00e1yana. It was in the wild country north of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budans that some of the abuses were practised with impunity which led to the insurrection of 1830. In December of that year, Rangappa N\u00e1yak, the head of the Tarikere family, secretly left Mysore, joined the insurgents and seized upon Kaldurga and K\u00e1mandurga. These forts were, however, recovered by the Mysore troops in February and March 1831, and the p\u00e1legar was put to flight. On the assumption of the government by the British in 1831, and the restoration of order, this part of the country was included in the Nagar Division. In 1863, it was formed into a separate District named after Kadur, where fo, a time the head-quarters were established. Before long, however, Chikmagalur was selected for the chief station as being more central, and a considerable town has there now sprung up.\n\nIn 1882 the Kadur District was extended by having Hassan attached to it as a Sub-Division, with 4 taluqs (Arsikere, Belur, Hassan and Manjarabad). But in 1886 the Hassan District was restored, and the Kadur District formed with its present limits. In 1897 the Yedehalli sub-taluq was abolished and the new taluq of B\u00e1le Honn\u00far was then established.\n\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014The population of the District, according to the census of 1891, is 330,063, of whom 173,922 are males and 156,141 females.\n\n*Density.*\u2014Thus there are 118\u00b717 persons to the square mile. The most thickly peopled taluq at the time of the census was Tarikere, with 160\u00b742, followed by Chikmagalur and Kadur, with 127\u00b76 and 127\u00b736. The maln\u00e1d taluqs of Koppa and Mudgere had only 88\u00b755 and 95\u00b797 per square mile.\n\n*By religion.*\u2014Arranged according to religion the following results are obtained:\u2014\nIncrease.\u2014The following table compares the statistics for 1838, taken from Mr. Stokes\u2019 report, and those for 1853\u20134, according to the kh\u00e1ne-shum\u00e1ri accounts, with the results obtained by census in 1871, 1881 and 1891.\n\n| Taluq     | 1838   | 1853-4 | 1871   | 1881   | 1891   |\n|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Chikmagalur | 43,418 | 51,581 | 81,864 | 76,475 | 82,052 |\n| Kadur     | 23,878 | 47,828 | 70,639 | 56,820 | 72,217 |\n| Koppa     | 34,385 | 42,489 | 51,830 | 56,847 | 62,077 |\n| M\u00fadgere   |        | 37,633 | 34,537 | 35,604 | 41,365 |\n| Tarikere  | 43,713 | 56,647 | 69,608 | 66,380 | 72,352 |\n| Total     | 145,394| 236,178| 308,478| 292,126| 330,063|\n\nThe first column is wanting in the figures for B\u00e1n\u00e1var taluq, which should be included in Kadur; those for Vast\u00e1ra, now M\u00fadgere, are included in Chikmagalur. The apparent increase between 1853 and 1871 was equivalent to 30\u00b761 per cent., but 25 per cent. has to be allowed for defective enumeration. The famine sent down the total 5\u00b73 per cent. by 1881, but it rose again 12\u00b764 per cent. by 1891. The net result may be stated at an increase of 11\u00b78 per cent. in 38 years.\n\nClasses.\u2014Classified according to sources of livelihood and nationality, the population is composed as follows:\n\n| Class                  | No.   | Per cent. |\n|------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| A.

They represent a total of 217,389, or 65\u00b786 per cent. of the population.\nThe most numerous classes of Wokkaliga are the S\u00e1da (14,664), Gangadik\u00e1ra (13,386), and Nonaba (11,119). Among Kurubas, the H\u00e1lu Kuruba (17,017) predominate. Of the Brahmins the largest sects are the Srivaishnava (5,357), Sm\u00e1rta (2,384), Badagan\u00e1d (2,073), and Tuluva (1,108). Of Musalm\u00e1ns 10,912 are Shekhs, and 2,117 Pathans.

Jaggory is also made, and there is some production of iron. A certain amount of catechu or terra japonica is also prepared.\n\nThe most important exports are coffee, pepper, cardamoms, rice and other food grains, and oil seeds, the various products of the District. It is only during the last 20 years that the Malnad parts have been opened up by a network of roads, and only since 1889 that the railway has run through a small part of the District. These agencies are effecting considerable changes in trade and the transport of commodities, the full effect of which can hardly yet be seen.\n\nThe principal old traffic between the Malnad and Maidan taluqs was through the following five kanaves or passes:\u2014Talagudde, Talamakki, Birnahalli, Gantevinayakan and Sitalmallappan.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS\n\nRailways.\u2014The Southern Mahratta Railway from Bangalore to Poona runs through the east of the District for about 40 miles, with stations at Devanur, Kadur, Birur, Ajjampur and Shivani. A branch is also under construction from Birur, through Tarikere, to Shimoga.\n\nRoads.\u2014The length of the Provincial roads in the District is 219 miles, and of the District roads 404. The annual cost for the upkeep of the former is Rs. 37,975, and of the latter Rs. 24,305.

Head-quarters of the Ajjampur hobli, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 4 Jains) | ... | 1,370 | 1,338 | 2,708 |\n| Muhammadans | ... | 109 | 73 | 182 |\n| Total | ... | 1,479 | 1,411 | 2,890 |\n\nThe site was originally occupied by the village of Keral. In the 17th century, Azim Khan, an officer of the Sira government, while hunting in the neighbourhood, was surprised at observing the hares turn upon his hounds and pursue them. The circumstance indicating a spot favourable for the purpose, he was directed to build the present fort, which was named after him Ajim-pur, now generally called Ajjampur.\n\nA weekly fair is held on Tuesday, attended by 500 people. Black soil prevails in the neighbourhood, on which a considerable quantity of cotton is raised. Extensive old gold workings have been discovered in the vicinity, and a European company has commenced gold-mining.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income | ... | 700 | 767 | 920 | 910 | 1,650 |\n| Expenditure | ... | 2,280 | 1,707 | 1,261 | 1,065 | 1,830 |\n\nAmritapura.\u2014A village a short distance north-east of Tarikere. Head-quarters of the Amritapura hobli. Population, 362. Contains the remains of a very fine and large temple of Amrites'vara, erected in 1197, in the time of the Hoysala king Vira-Ball\u0101la. It is in the Chalukyan style and was originally profusely sculptured with decorative details, even on the round Hindu battlements of the outer wall.\n\nAngadi.\u2014A village, 7 miles south of Mudgere, near Ugghalli. Population, 553. It is of special interest from my having identified it with the Sosev\u016br, Sasipura or Sasikapura, which was the birthplace of the powerful Hoysala line of kings, and the scene of the incident with the tiger which gained their progenitor Sala the throne and the name\nof Poysala or Hoysala (see Vol. I., p. 335). It contains a number of old inscriptions and remarkable ruined temples. There is some beautiful sculpture in what remains of the two Jain bastis. On the opposite side of the deeply sunk village path are the ruins of three fine temples, dedicated to Kes'ava, P\u00e1t\u0101la Rudra and Malles'vara. But the principal deity now worshipped is Vasantamma, who has a great reputation, and is probably the original V\u00e1santik\u00e1 Devi of the Hoysalas.\n\n**Asandi.**\u2014A village in Kadur taluq, about 5 miles east of Ajjampur. Population, 996.\n\nNumerous old inscriptions and ruins in the place show that it was in ancient times of considerable importance. Under both the Gangas and the Hoysalas it was the chief city of a principality, which in the 8th century was governed by Vijay\u00e1ditya, son of the king Sripurusha, and in the 12th and 13th centuries by a line of chiefs of Ganga descent.\n\n**Ayyankere** or **Dodda Madaga-kere.**\u2014A beautiful loch, surrounded with high hills and studded with islands, 4 miles west of Sakkarepatna. It is situated at the eastern base of the B\u00e1ba Budan range, being formed by embanking the perennial stream of the Gauri halla at the foot of Sakunagiri. Its outflowing waters are called the Veda, which unites, after a short course, with the Avati near Kadur and forms the joint stream of the Vedavati.\n\nThe construction of this magnificent reservoir is attributed to Rukm\u00e1ngada R\u00e1ya, the ancient king of Sakkarepatna. The embankment, formed of earth and stone, is about 1,700 feet long, and 300 feet high at the rear slope. The tank is very deep and contains in many parts 35 feet of water. The contents of the bund have been estimated at 605,760 cubic yards, and the quantity of water at 207,900 cubic feet, or 12,854,260 gallons.\n\nThere is a tradition that the bank was once on the point of breaching, when the danger which threatened the town of Sakkarepatna from inundation was announced by the guardian goddess of the lake to Honbilla, the *nirganti* or waterman. He obtained a promise from her that the catastrophe should be delayed until he returned with orders what to do from his master the king of Sakkarepatna; and hastening to the town delivered warning of the impending danger. The king sagely but inhumanly thought that, under the conditions of the promise, to prevent the return of the messenger would be forever to avert the catastrophe. He accordingly had him killed on the spot and the embankment has stood ever since. A shrine has been erected at Sakkarepatna to the memory of the unfortunate man who was sacrificed for its stability, at which worship is still performed. Under the Hoysala kings considerable repairs were made to the bund. An inscription at the Ball\u00e1lesvara\ntemple, erected on a hillock towards the centre of the embankment, is of the time of Vira Narasimha, the middle of the 13th century.\n\nOf the 4 channels drawn from the tank, the Mallappan k\u00e1lve irrigates 18 acres; Basavan k\u00e1lve, 170 acres; Uru k\u00e1lve, 119 acres; and Kade k\u00e1lve, 82 acres.\n\n**B\u00e1ba Budan Mountains.**\u2014The loftiest range on the Mysore table-land, situated in the centre of the District, to the north of Chikmagalur, between $13^\\circ 23'$ and $13^\\circ 35'$ north latitude, $75^\\circ 37'$ and $75^\\circ 52'$ east longitude. The form of the chain is that of a horse-shoe, with the opening to the north-west. The northern arm, commencing with the Hebbe hill (4,385 feet), stretches eastwards without interruption for about 15 miles; whence, bending southwards, it presents to the east an unbroken wall of more than 20 miles. The southern arm is formed by the Basvan gudda and Woddin gudda ranges. The character of the chain is that of a stupendous ridge, 6,000 feet above the level of the sea, and in some parts only a few yards wide at the summit, rising at intervals into loftier peaks. The summit of the hills consists of steep grassy slopes, well wooded in the ravines, through which flow perennial springs. The sides are densely clothed with forests, among which are numerous coffee plantations, as well as in the J\u00e1gar valley, which is one stretch of forest as far as the eye can reach.\n\nThe highest point is the symmetrical Mulaina-giri, 6,317 feet above the level of the sea. It is towards the south of the range and is the loftiest mountain between the Him\u00e1layas and the Nilagiris. Next to this, north-eastwards, is B\u00e1ba Budan giri, V\u00e1yu Parvata or Marut Saila, 6,214 feet. Near it are the sources of the Veda and Avati. The hollow which succeeds marks the shrine of B\u00e1ba Budan. The conspicuous conical peak on the outer verge of the eastern face is Deviramman gudda. A beacon is lighted here at the Dipavali festival, which is visible to all the surrounding country. Near the north-east angle is situated Kalhatti giri, 6,155 feet in height; north of which is Kalhatti bungalow, a hot weather retreat for European officials. These vast wilds and solitudes, with scarcely a human habitation, were, until a few years ago, well stocked with every variety of game, from the elephant and bison downwards. The advance of the coffee-planter has now forced back the savage denizens to remoter and more secluded spots. The B\u00e1ba Budan mountain was the cradle of the coffee cultivation of Southern India, and the slopes of the entire range, as well as the south of the forest-bound J\u00e1gar valley, are now occupied by coffee gardens, both European and native. The first European coffee plantation, opened out by Mr. Cannon in about 1840, is to the south of B\u00e1ba Budan giri, with other early estates.\nTwo roads pass along the eastern face from Chikmagalur to Tarikere, one over the summit and the other at a lower level. About midway in the latter, under K\u00e1man durga, is the settlement of Santav\u00e9ri, from which a road, four miles in length, leads to Kalhatti. Santav\u00e9ri is occupied chiefly by a colony of Lamb\u00e1nis. On the north-east of the mountains are the Abbe falls, a descent of 600 feet by a stream running to the Bhadra.\n\nThe range is called in the Hindu pur\u00e1\u00f1as Chandra Drona, but derives its present name from a Muhammadan saint who took up his residence on one of the southern slopes. He is stated to have reared coffee from seeds he obtained at Mocha, and thus to have introduced that important staple into India. A cave, containing what the Muhammadans assert to be the tomb of B\u00e1ba Budan, but the Hindus to be the throne of Datt\u00e1treya, is a venerated place of pilgrimage for adherents of both creeds. A Mussalman kalandar is the custodian of the cave, which is designated the southern Mecca, and well endowed. By the Hindus the reappearance of Datt\u00e1treya at the mouth of the cave, into which in ancient times he vanished, is looked for as a sign prophetic of the final avat\u00e1r of Vishnu and the introduction of the millennium.\u00b9\n\nAttigundi, about a mile from the cave, is the residence of the Kalandar and the principal village on the hills.\n\n**Ballal-rayan-durga.**\u2014A fine spreading hill in the Western Ghat range, crowned with extensive fortifications. It is situated in $13\u00b0\\ 8'$ N. lat., and $75\u00b0\\ 29'$ E. long., in the north-west angle of the M\u00fadgere taluq, over against Kellagur. The fortifications were erected, as its name indicates, by the Hoysala kings. The old entrance is to the north, through what is now the Horik\u00e1n coffee plantation. There are two gates, the didd\u00ed b\u00e1galu and the simha b\u00e1galu. The citadel is a small square fort on the highest point, overlooking the South Kanara District. To the east of it is the old tank, now a bog, overgrown with impenetrable bushes. The pass to Kanara, north of the droog, is tremendously steep, but was formerly in regular use. To this fortress the R\u00e1ni of Bednur fled for refuge on the capture of her capital by Haidar Ali in 1763, and hence she was sent by him as a prisoner to Maddagiri (Tumkur District.)\n\n**Bal\u00e9-Honnur.**\u2014A new taluq in the west, formed in 1897. Area about 410 square miles. Head-quarters at B\u00e1l\u00e9 Honn\u00far. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 There is said to have existed a history of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains in Persian, compiled in the time of the Bijapur kings. But it was borrowed in recent times by some official and at his death was among his effects, which were sold by auction. It is believed to have found its way to Mangalore, but I have been unable to trace it.\nBALE-HONNUR\n\n| No. | Hoblis. | Villages. | Hamlets. | Government. | Sarvamanya. | Jodi. | Kayamgutta. | Population. |\n|-----|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------|-------------|\n| 1   | Baggunji ... | 14        | 67       | 14          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 4,104       |\n| 2   | B\u00e1le Honnur ... | 20        | 123      | 20          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 6,141       |\n| 3   | Kalasa ... | 13        | 37       | 13          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 9,772       |\n| 4   | Kh\u00e1ndya ... | 17        | 10       | 17          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 4,943       |\n| 5   | Megunda ... | 23        | 52       | 23          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 8,226       |\n| Total | ... | 87        | 289      | 87          | \u2014           | \u2014     | \u2014           | 33,186      |\n\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014M\u00e1vinakere, 3,662; Devad\u00e1na, 1,166; Karik\u00e9sari, 1,142; Kanabur, 1,081; Samse, 1,041.\n\nThe taluq was formed out of B\u00e1le Honn\u00far hobli of the abolished Yedehalli sub-taluq, Megunda and Baggunji of Koppa taluq, Kalasa of M\u00fadgere taluq and Kh\u00e1ndya of Chikmagalur taluq. The river Bhadra runs through it from south to north, with high mountains on either side, especially on the west, from the Merti peak of Kalasa in the south to eastwards of Koppa droog in the north. The whole taluq is purely Malnad and full of grand and picturesque scenery. It is a network of lofty hills and sunken valleys, the former densely covered with forests, which shelter a continuous belt of coffee plantations, the latter occupied by steeply terraced rice flats and areca gardens. The dry cultivation is very limited and of little value.\n\nThis part of the country was at one time under the S\u00e1ntara kings of Hombucha and then under the Hoysalas.\n\nB\u00e1le-Honn\u00far.\u2014A town (or rather group of villages) situated in 13\u00b0 20' N. lat., and 75\u00b0 32' E. long., on the west bank of the Bhadra. Head-quarters of the taluq of the same name. Population, with associated villages, 1,081.\n\nThere has always been a ford at this place over the Bhadra, but a fine bridge has now been built, increasing the importance of the town for through traffic. A little to the north is the B\u00e1lehalli ma\u1e6dha, the seat of one of the principal gurus of the Ling\u00e1yit sect.\n\nBhadra.\u2014The twin stream of the Tunga, which both united form the river Tungabhadra. It rises close to the Tunga in the Gang\u00e1v\u00fala peak in the Western Ghats, 15 miles west of Kalasa. With a tortuous course it flows first eastwards and then, being joined at Tungamesvara by the Anebidda halla from the south, turns north-north-east and runs past Khandeya, across the mouth of the J\u00e1gar valley, the drainage of which it receives in the Somav\u00e1hini at Hebbe. Thence, fed near\nLakvalli by streams from Kalhatti giri and Kal-durga, it continues, by Benkipur and Hole Honnur, to the point of confluence with the Tunga at Kudali in the Shimoga District. The extreme steepness of the banks prevents the waters being extensively utilized for irrigation, but there are 18 dams from which 325 acres are supplied with water. The dense forests through which it flows has procured it the reputation of being a less healthy stream than the Tunga. It is bridged at B\u00e1le Honn\u00far, and at Benkipur for the Bangalore-Shimoga high road. It crosses the Tarikere-Agumbi ghat road between Yedehalli and Lakvalli.\n\n**Birur.**\u2014An important trading town in the Kadur taluq, on the Bangalore-Poona railway and the Bangalore-Shimoga road, 4 miles north by west of the kasba, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 6 Jains) | 2,202 | 2,016 | 4,220 |\n| Muhammadans | 354 | 236 | 590 |\n| Christians | 14 | 4 | 18 |\n| **Total** | **2,570** | **2,256** | **4,828** |\n\nThe merchants of Birur receive areca-nut from the Malnad districts in the west and export it to Bellary and Dharwar. A very large traffic is also carried on in the cocoa-nuts, grain and other produce of the surrounding country. The annual value of the transactions at Birur is stated at nearly 50 lakhs of rupees. Birur is the junction for the branch railway to Shimoga, and has been extended in recent years.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income | 2,595 | 2,633 | 2,705 | 3,775 | 8,108 |\n| Expenditure | 4,929 | 2,916 | 5,585 | 9,633 | 9,052 |\n\n**Bund Ghat.**\u2014The Bund Gh\u00e1t (coffee ghat) is the principal outlet to the western coast from the south of the District. The Ghat road runs from M\u00fadgere and is led through the Wombat-mara\u1e0di or nine hills. The views from Kotigeh\u00e1ra of the approach to and down the ghat are very fine. Near the head of the ghat is a hill, called Hulikal, with two boulders on it supposed to represent the petrified forms of a tiger and a bull. The descent is by easy gradients of 1 in 20 to 1 in 15.\nChikmagalur.\u2014A taluq in the centre and south. Area about 595 square miles. Head-quarters at Chikmagalur.

The southern, northern, and eastern slopes contain many coffee plantations. The tract of country around Chikmagalur consists of an elevated plain, composed of rich black soil, extending along the southern base of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains and bounded east and west by inferior ranges of hills, which separate it from Sakkarepatna on one hand and from Vast\u00e1ra on the other. Apart from the excellence of the soil, it is watered by perennial streams issuing from the B\u00e1ba Budans, the principal being the Yagache, which flows south by east into the Hassan District. Such is the fertility of this tract that it received the expressive name of hon-javanige or land flowing with gold. It is very bare of trees but produces unfailing crops of wheat, Bengal gram, sugar-cane, rice, coriander, mentya, garlic, onions and kusumba. Neither cotton nor tobacco are grown, owing, it is said, to too much damp.\n\nThe western portion, which till 1875 formed part of the separate taluq of Vast\u00e1ra, borders the Malnad beyond and partakes of its character.\n\nThe country formed part of the territory of the Jain kings of Humcha and of their descendants the rulers of Karkala, latterly included in the Hoysala kingdom. Under the Vijayanagar empire it passed into the hands, first of the chief of Balaim, and then into those\nof the Nayaks of Ikkeri. It was subdued by Chikka Deva R\u00e1ja in 1690 and added to Mysore by treaty with Ikkeri in 1694; except the Vastara country, which fell to Mysore by Haidar Ali's conquest of Bednur in 1763.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1880. The area of the taluq as constituted at that time was thus distributed:\n\n- Cultivable (dry, 71,382; wet, 39,653; garden, 1,534) ... ... 112,569\n- Uncultivable (village sites, roads, etc.) ... ... ... ... 223,906\n- Coffee estates (1,551), kavals (28,696), Inam villages (20,370) ... 50,617\n\nTotal acres ... 387,092\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 27,381 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,38,214, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,18,967.\n\nThe average annual rainfall at Chikmagalur for 26 years (1870\u201395) has been as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0\u00b020 | 0\u00b019 | 1\u00b006 | 2\u00b021 | 4\u00b092 | 4\u00b048 | 6\u00b007 | 3\u00b028 | 3\u00b003 | 7\u00b039 | 2\u00b041 | 0\u00b065 | 35\u00b089 |\n\nAnother register for 16 years gives the annual average as 41\u00b072.\n\nThere are roads from Chikmagalur north-east to the railway at Kadur, south-east to Hassan, south-west to M\u00fadgere and Bund-ghat, with branches to Aldur and B\u00e1le Honnur, north-west, past the mouth of the Jagar valley, to Yedehalli, and north to the B\u00e1ba Budans and to Tarikere.\n\n**Chikmagalur.**\u2014The head-quarters of the Kadur District, and of the Chikmagalur taluq; situated in 13\u00b0 18' N. lat., 75\u00b0 51' E. long., 25 miles from the railway at Kadur. It is also a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus ... ... ... ... ... | 2,660 | 2,652 | 5,312 |\n| Muhammadans ... ... ... ... ... | 1,152 | 1,072 | 2,224 |\n| Jains ... ... ... ... ... | 36 | 4 | 40 |\n| Christians ... ... ... ... ... | 123 | 117 | 240 |\n| **Total** ... ... ... ... ... | **3,971** | **3,845** | **7,816** |\n\nIt is situated in the valley south of the B\u00e1ba Budan range, in a fertile tract of black soil. Since the removal hither of the District headquarters from Kadur, in 1865, it has enormously increased. The main bazaar street is a fine wide thoroughfare, more than 2 miles long,\nextending from the old fort of Chikmagalur to the village of Basavanhalli, which it includes. In fact, the place is often called by the latter name. A large fair is held on Wednesday, at which 3,000 people assemble. The wants of the neighbouring coffee districts have led to the settlement here of a number of Muhammadan traders and shopkeepers. The town, \u00faru, is popularly supposed to be named after the chikka magalu, or younger daughter, of Rukm\u00e1ngada, the king of Sakkarepatna, being her dowry, as the contiguous village of Hiremagalur was that of the hire magalu, or elder daughter. But as stated above (p. 379), there seems to be no foundation for this derivation. There are inscriptions in the fort of the Ganga kings in the 9th century, and of the Hoysalas in the 13th century. At certain seasons the high east winds, to which the place is much exposed, render it unhealthy. A wide belt of trees has been planted completely round the limits of the station, in the form of an oval, to mitigate this evil. Besides the usual District offices, there are a club, hospital, high school and other public buildings.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1891-2. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | ...     | 50,400  | 15,647  | 17,240  | 24,921  |\n| Expenditure      | ...     | 53,761  | 18,133  | 18,228  | 25,502  |\n\nGangamula.\u2014The source of the Tunga and Bhadra rivers, situated in 13\u00b0 15' N. lat., 75\u00b0 14' E. long. The hill from which they issue, called the Var\u00e1ha Parvata, is in the Western Ghats, on the confines of the Koppa and B\u00e1le Honnur taluqs. The legend is that after Vishnu, incarnate as the Var\u00e1ha or Boar, had raised up the earth from the waters of the ocean, into which a Daitya named Hiranyaksha had carried off and plunged it, he took his stand on this mountain, and the drops which trickled from his two tusks formed respectively the twin streams the Tunga and Bhadra. The Netr\u00e1vati, a stream which flows west through S. Kanara, is supposed to rise at the same place, and to have sprung from the drops which fell from the eyes (netra) of the Boar. The tunga (long) left tusk was the one he used as his weapon, the bhadra (firm and strong) right tusk was the one on which he bore up the earth: this is the dakshinonnata damsh\u1e6dr\u0101gra frequently invoked in inscriptions.\n\nMr. Bowring, who visited Gang\u00e1m\u00fala, says, \"It is in truth a wild country, and has a desolate grandeur about it, seeming to be the end of the world. On every side tower up magnificent mountains, spreading for leagues in every direction, and covered with immense forests, while\nnowhere can one detect the faintest trace of human life, either in the shape of houses or of cultivation.\" It was to these solitudes that the father of Pandita Ramabai retired for many years, and here it was that he taught her Sanskrit.\n\n**Hariharpur**, properly **Hariharapura**.\u2014A village situated in $13^\\circ 30'$ N. lat., $75^\\circ 22'$ E. long., on the left bank of the Tunga, on the Tarikere-Agumbi road, 7 miles east of the Agumbi ghat. Till 1897 the head-quarters of the Koppa taluq. Population 1,689.\n\nFrom inscriptions at the place it appears to have been an agrahara established in 1448 by Sabanna Wodeyar of Araga (Tirthahalli taluq, Shimoga District) in the reign of Harihara Raya of Vijayanagar, and named after the latter. Its importance has been mainly due to its being the taluq head-quarters.\n\n**Hemavati**.\u2014This river, a principal tributary of the Kaveri, is more fully described under the Hassan and Mysore Districts, in which most of its course is run. But it rises in this District, in Javali, in the Melbangadi maganji of the Mudgere taluq. The reputed source is a spring, behind the house of Lakshmayya, a coffee planter, which is led through a stone bull into a square stone well. The stream runs in a south-east direction to the Hassan District, which it enters at the common boundary of Manjarabad and Belur.\n\n**Hiremagalur**.\u2014A large village, 1 mile south-east of Chikmagalur, largely inhabited by Sri Vaishnava Brahmins. Population 2,028.\n\nIt is said to be named from the hire-magatu or elder daughter of Rukmangada, the king of Sakkarapatha, having been bestowed on her as a dowry, but see above (p. 379). Its former name is stated to have been Bhargavapuri. Here the emperor Janamejaya is related to have performed the sarpa yaga, or serpent sacrifice, undertaken to avenge the death of his father Parikshit from the bite of a snake. The scene of this sacrifice is marked by a spear-headed stone pillar in the town, called the yupa stambha or sacrificial post. It is said to be efficacious in restoring any one bitten by a serpent: the patient must circumambulate the pillar and bathe in the Siddha Pushkarini, a pond close by. The village is surrounded by a rich tract of black soil. Inscriptions at the place show that it was an agrahara in the 9th century in the time of the Ganga king Nitimarga, and in the 11th century in the time of the Hoysala king Vinayaditya. It contains some old temples, one dedicated to Kodanda Rama and another to Paras'u, the axe of Paras'u Rama.\n\n**Kadur**.\u2014A taluq in the east; area 561 square miles. Head-quarters at Kadur.

Originally, it appears, there were 4 taluqs, Kadur, Yagati, Garudangiri and Banavar. The two former belonged to the old Ikkeri kingdom, but were taken by the Mysore kings and given to the chief of Tarikere, in return for services in the field rendered by him. Haidar resumed them and annexed them to Mysore. Garudangiri was absorbed into Banavar, and about 1835 Yagati was absorbed into Kadur. In 1876 Kadur and Banavar were formed into one taluq, named after Banavar, which was the chief town. In 1882 the head-quarters were removed to Kadur, and in 1886, on the formation of the neighbouring Arsikere taluq, Kadur taluq was reconstituted, with the addition of Sakkarepatna hobli from Chikmagalur, while portions of the old Banavar taluq, together with Banavar itself, were transferred from this District to Arsikere taluq in the Hassan District.\n\nIt is now virtually bounded on the west by the congeries of hills east of the Baba Budan mountains, and those separating Chikmagalur from the Sakkarepatna valley, and on the south by the hills running up from Javagal to the conspicuous height of Garudangiri. It is traversed through the middle, in a north-east direction, by the Vedavati, which is formed by the junction, south-east of Kadur, of two streams, the Veda and Avati, and receives near Yagati a stream from the south, called the Javagal-halla. The Veda and Avati both have their sources in the Baba Budans; but the former comes through the Ayyankere and the latter through the Madagkere, the two largest tanks in that part of the country. These streams as they emerge from the hills have been dammed with great skill and a perennial water supply thus obtained.\nNumerous channels are taken off from each, converting a considerable stretch of country into irrigated lands of special fertility. The general character of the taluq is that of a slightly undulating plain. Most of the waste lands are covered with wild date or babul trees. A large extent of waste lands is kept for grazing purposes, the number of cattle and sheep being very considerable. Soils of almost every quality are found, varying from black cotton soil of good quality to the poorest sand. Irrigated lands are of average quality, varying principally as the proportion of clay or sand predominates. A high class of tobacco is grown in the south and west. Cocoanuts are largely grown without irrigation, in low-lying sandy soils. The tree thrives best in the drier parts, where also the produce is superior in quality. Iron ore is obtained from Hogari-betta in the north-west.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1878, and the area of the taluq as it then existed was distributed as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Acres |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Culturable (dry, 205,934; wet, 11,113; garden, 11,099) | 228,146 |\n| Unculturable (roads, village sites, &c.)          | 99,171 |\n| Five In\u00e1m villages (5,291); 15 Amrit Mahal k\u00e1vals (47,851) | 53,142 |\n| **Total acres**                                  | **380,459** |\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 100,830 acres, nearly all dry crop land. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,86,614, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,12,476.\n\nThe average rainfall at Kad\u00far for 26 years (1870\u201395), and at Yag\u00e1ti for 3 years (1893\u20135) has been as follows:\n\n| Month | Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|-------|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Kad\u00far | 0'12 | 0'03 | 0'34 | 1'24 | 3'27 | 2'39 | 1'98 | 1'19 | 2'32 | 5'53 | 2'03 | 0'94 | 21'38 |\n| Yag\u00e1ti| \u2014    | \u2014    | \u2014    | 2'89 | 2'39 | 1'61 | 1'85 | 1'06 | 2'66 | 7'49 | 1'88 | \u2014    | 21'83 |\n\nThe Bangalore-Poona railway runs through the taluq in a north-west direction, with stations at Devanur, Kad\u00far and B\u00edr\u00far, where it turns north-east and enters the Tarikere taluq. From B\u00edr\u00far a branch north-west to Shimoga is under construction. The Bangalore-Shimoga road is close alongside the railway, and there are roads from Kad\u00far southwest to Chikmagalur, and from B\u00edr\u00far north to Ajjampur and west to Lingadahalli and the B\u00e1ba Budans. There is also a road from Sakkare-pa\u1e47a to Devanur and Banavar.\n\nKad\u00far.\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 32\u2032 N. lat., 76\u00b0 4\u2032 E. long., on the Bangalore-Poona railway and the Bangalore-Shimoga road, 25 miles north-west of Chikmagalur. Head-quarters of the Kadur taluq and a municipality.\nIt was from 1863 to 1865 the chief town of the then newly-formed District, whence the latter obtained its name, and still later, till 1875, the head-quarters of the Ka\u1e0d\u016br taluq, which was then absorbed into Banavar taluq. In 1882 it was again made the taluq head-quarters, and in 1886 the taluq was again called after it.\n\nFrom inscriptions and other monuments it is evident that a Jain settlement existed here in early times, connected with the Ganga kings. It was subsequently under the Hoysalas. During the sovereignty of the Vijayanagar kings, in the 14th century, the lands around Yemme Doddigudda were conferred upon a dependent named Mada Nayak. At that time the agrah\u0101ra of Narnapura occupied the present site of Ka\u1e0d\u016br, and the Nayak, when hunting one day in that direction, had his dogs turned back and pursued by an elk. This led to the foundation of the fort, called Ka\u1e0d\u016bru, elk town, from ka\u1e0dave, an elk. The recent advent of the railway has increased its importance, as being the station for Chikmagalur and the coffee districts beyond.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | 1,600  | 1,607  | 1,670  | 2,562  | 2,766  |\n| Expenditure    | 4,160  | 1,621  | 2,285  | 3,785  | 3,861  |\n\nKalasa.\u2014A village in the B\u00e1l\u00e9-Honnur taluq, situated in 13\u00b0 14' N. lat., 75\u00b0 26' E. long., near the right bank of the Bhadra, by road 24 miles south-west of the kasba.\n\nIt is situated in a valley surrounded by the lofty hills of the Western Ghat range, and at the southern base of Merti, the grand hill of Kalasa. It contains a large temple dedicated to Kalasesvara, surrounded with inscriptions of the Bairasa Wodeyar family of K\u00e1rkala. The temple is said to have been founded by Shrutabindu, a king from the north, in order to atone for the sin of slaying animals in the chase. It was therefore probably a Jain temple originally. Mounds covering ruins on all sides point to the existence of a large town in former times. It was included in the dominions of Humcha and of the K\u00e1rkala chiefs descended therefrom. Subsequently it became the residence of the Aigur chiefs. The town then extended so as to include the present villages of Melangadi, Kilangadi, and Rudrap\u00e1da. Going through\nMelangadi and keeping on to the river, a sacred bathing-place called Ambu-tirtha is reached, where the stream rushes very deep between some water-worn rocks. At one point is a large boulder, a big square-shaped stone placed horizontally on another. On the former is an inscription in Sanskrit, stating that Sri Madhvacharya brought and placed it there with one hand! The Kalasa territory was administered by three chiefs of a thousand villages, called Hebbaru. The areca-nut produced in the neighbourhood is reckoned the best in Mysore, being known as Desavara, in distinction from that grown in other Malnad parts, which is called Honnavara, and from Volagra, which is the produce of other inland gardens. Kalasa is connected with the Bund ghat by a road through Balur, and with the Agumbi ghat by a road running north through Baggunji.\n\nKhandeya.\u2014A village in Bal\u00e9-Honnur taluq, on the right bank of the Bhadra, where it makes a bend to receive the Anebidda-halla, 5 miles north-east of the kasba.\n\nIt appears to have been formerly a large place. There are some considerable old temples, the principal being one dedicated to Markandesvara; also several inscriptions of the Hoysala and Vijayanagar kings. It is said to have been originally the hermitage of Markanda rishi. He sought from Siva the boon of a son, and was required to choose between one who should be distinguished for his wisdom but die at the age of 16, and one who should be a fool and live a long life. The saint chose the former, and obtained Markandeya. The distress of his mother as the time of his decease approached led to his discovery of his fate. But when Mrityu, the goddess of death, appeared to claim his life, Janardana (Vishnu) offered to be the substitute, and Siva, moved by the youth's devotion, gave him victory over death. The place derives its name from Markandeya, and the temples of Janardana and Mrityunjaya (conqueror of death) commemorate his deliverance.\n\nKoppa.\u2014A taluq in the north-west. Area 466 square miles. Headquarters, till 1897 at Hariharpur, now at Koppa.

The most open portion is the Sring\u00e9ri valley, which is traversed by the upper course of the Tunga. This river runs in a north-east direction as far as Narve, where it turns to the north-west. The watershed is in no part very distant, and the hill streams, though numerous, have not time to become of any size. The Sita and Begar hallas are the largest. The remaining three sides of the taluq are bounded by lofty mountains. From the Var\u00e1ha parvata at Gangam\u00fala, in the south-western angle, whence the Tunga and Bhadra take their rise, the Western Ghats run north, with such prominent points as Wolkonji, Sujibetta, Nemar and Kig. East from the same point stretch conspicuous ranges, culminating in the Merti peak of Kalasa, and thence northwards towards Koppa droog. The western and southern hills are mostly bare of trees at their summits, but are thickly wooded in the hollows. On proceeding eastwards the elevation of the tree zone rises, until only the highest hill-tops are devoid of forest. Most of the taluq is a succession of lofty hills and deep valleys, the latter, where not cultivated, being covered with jungle and heavy scrub.\n\nThe soil is a good red loam, whose fertility is yearly renewed by the decomposed vegetable matter which is washed down by the rain from the surrounding forests. Of dry crops, a little r\u00e1gi is grown for home consumption on high-lying makki lands; but this is not reaped, only the heads are picked, and cattle turned in to eat the straw. Castor and other oil seeds are grown to a small extent as a second crop in some of the rice lands. The staple wet crop is rice, and a second crop is grown in some villages to the west. The sugar-cane is generally inferior and raised only in small patches for home use. The jaggory produced is too watery to crystallize and is commonly used, mixed with water, as a drink. But in the neighbourhood of D\u00e1niv\u00e1sa, in the north-east, where sugar-cane is largely grown, the juice is made into sakkar\u00e9 bija or crystals, and afterwards manufactured into sugar. The principal garden crop is areca-nut, for which the taluq is renowned. The best gardens are in the south-east. Cardamoms are also a very valuable production, but require abundant and continuous moisture. Coffee cultivation has made great strides in the last 25 years. In 1870 Koppa and Nemar were the only coffee estates under European superintendence, whereas now this taluq is one of the principal centres for European coffee planters, and coffee is extensively cultivated in the hill ranges to the north and on the slopes of the Western Ghats.\n\nThe Sring\u00e9ri j\u00e1gir forms an endowment of the ma\u1e6dha of the Smarta\nBrahmans, founded in the 8th century by the Saiva apostle Sankaracharya, as elsewhere related. The country, from its inaccessible character, was virtually independent, each magani being the domain of some Heggaile or local chieftain. It was first included in the territories of the Humcha and Karkala rulers, and then in the Hoysala dominions. The religious establishment at Sringeri was intimately connected with the foundation of the Vijayanagar empire, and Harihara, one of the brothers from whom the royal line was descended, gave his name to the agrahara at Hariharapura. The Nayaks of Ikkeri gained possession of the territory on the overthrow of Vijayanagar, and in 1763, by the capture of Bednur by Haidar Ali, it was absorbed into the kingdom of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1880. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 492; wet, 22,014; garden, 6,041) | ... | ... | 28,547 |\n| Unculturable (roads, village sites, etc.) | ... | ... | 185,825 |\n| 2 Inam villages | ... | ... | 28,932 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | **243,304** |\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 1,752 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 3,31,885, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 3,57,158.\n\nThe average rainfall has been estimated at 172 inches a year in the western portions and 108 in the eastern. But the following is the result of observations at taluq stations for 26 years (1870-95):\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Koppa | 0\u00b019 | 0\u00b013 | 0\u00b041 | 1\u00b066 | 3\u00b072 | 2\u00b037 | 2\u00b090 | 4\u00b025 | 5\u00b008 | 9\u00b056 | 7\u00b040 | 2\u00b011 | 0\u00b045 | 116\u00b090 |\n| Yedehalli | \u2014 | 0\u00b016 | 0\u00b029 | 2\u00b007 | 3\u00b076 | 9\u00b092 | 16\u00b059 | 10\u00b002 | 5\u00b014 | 5\u00b023 | 2\u00b057 | 0\u00b047 | ... | 56\u00b022 |\n\nOther registers give an average of 119\u00b089 at Koppa for 16 years and 53\u00b064 at Yedehalli for 7 years.\n\nThe road from Tarikere to the Agumbi Ghat (the only one in the taluq 20 years ago) runs through Koppa, Hariharpur and the north. A cross road from Begar connects it with Sringeri and Nemar, and there is also a road from Sringeri to Kigga. From Hariharpur a road has been carried through Baggunji to Bale Honnur and Aldur. From Koppa there are roads to Sringeri, to Badagi, and to Tirthahalli. From Yedehalli there are roads to Bale Honnur, to Chikmagalur by the mouth of the Jagar valley, to Mandagadde, and to Shimoga by Umbalibail.\n\nKoppa.\u2014A village situated in 13\u00b0 16' N. lat., 75\u00b0 24' E. long., on the Tarikere-Agumbi Ghat road, 39 miles west of the railway at\nTarikere. Population, 782. Being appointed in 1897 as the headquarters of the taluq, it is likely to rapidly increase in importance.\n\n**Kudure Mukha.**\u2014A peak in the Western Ghats and one of the loftiest points in Mysore, the summit being 6,215 feet above the level of the sea. It is situated on the frontier in the south-west of the District, at the point where the line of the Ghats bends more inland. The approach from the Mysore side is by way of Samse, the hill being sometimes called on the spot the Samse parvata. Its name of Kudure mukha, or Horse-face, is descriptive of its appearance seawards, where it is a well-known mark for navigators. The officials of Malabar have a bungalow at the top as a hot weather retreat, and a bridle path has been formed from the Malabar side, which is the easiest means of ascending the mountain.\n\n**Lakvalli.**\u2014A village in Tarikere taluq, on the right bank of the Bhadra, 13 miles west of Tarikere. Population, 1,358.\n\nTill 1882 it gave its name to a taluq which included the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains and parts of what are now Koppa and B\u00e1le Honnur taluqs. West of it are vast forests on each side of the Bhadra, containing some of the most valuable teak timber in the country. Nowhere is the transition from Malnad to Maid\u00e1n more abrupt or striking than here.\n\nLakvalli is close to the site of Ratnapuri, the ancient capital of Vajra Makuta R\u00e1ya. The neighbouring country subsequently formed part of the Humcha and Ganga territory; then of the Hoysala and Vijayanagar kingdoms. The palegars of Tarikere afterwards acquired some portion of it, but were forced to yield it to the N\u00e1yaks of Ikk\u00e9ri. The overthrow of this latter power by Haidar Ali\u2019s conquest of Bednur in 1763 led to the absorption of the country into Mysore.\n\n**Merti-gudda,** also called the Kalasa hill, is situated in the B\u00e1le Honnur taluq, in 13\u00b0 18' N. lat., 75\u00b0 26' E. long. It is the loftiest peak between the B\u00e1ba Budan and Western Ghat ranges, the summit being 5,451 feet above the level of the sea. To the north it presents a majestic conical aspect. Towards the south-west it is connected with two lower heights and is so surrounded on all sides with high hills that its true elevation does not appear except at a distance.\n\nMr. Bowring, who left few hills unscaled, says: \u201cAfter a toilsome climb up its steep sides by the \u2018windy gorge,\u2019 one revels in a view which surpasses all expectation. On every side tower up hills of various shapes and sizes, stretching far away to the horizon, and presenting a wonderful spectacle of wild sublimity. The foot of the steep ridge which runs up to a sharp point forming the actual peak is\ncalled the T\u00faral b\u00e1galu (entrance gate), and is in a gap between the M\u00e9rti Parvat and another hill to the south. A very tough pull of twenty-five minutes takes one hence to the summit, the higher of two peaks, between which there is a dip.\n\n\"The top of Merti is quite bare, but its sides are clothed with fine forests, in which are splendid specimens of the champaka tree, so much esteemed by natives for its fragrant white flowers; while one sees beneath, in secluded nooks and sheltered valleys, stretches of paddy land in successive layers, one below the other, and numerous gardens of areca-nut, which, in this remote corner, attains an excellence surpassing that of any other place where the fruit is grown. The sides of Merti, where the nature of the ground admits of it, are cultivated in a series of terraces, in which abundance of rice is grown, with a little coffee: this, however, does not succeed well, owing to the humidity of the climate.\"\n\n**Mudgere.**\u2014A taluq in the south. Area about 302 square miles. Head-quarters at Mudgere. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n| No. | Hoblis. | Villages. | Hamlets. | Government. | Sarvam\u00e1nya. | J\u00f3di. | Kayamgutta. | Population |\n|-----|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|-------------|------------|\n| 1   | Banakal... | ... | 28 | 39 | 28 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 6,080 |\n| 2   | Bidarn\u00e1d... | ... | 14 | 3 | 14 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 6,107 |\n| 3   | G\u00f3nib\u00edd... | ... | 29 | 44 | 28 | \u2014 | 1 | \u2014 | 9,001 |\n| 4   | M\u00e9lbang\u00e1d\u00ed... | ... | 21 | 11 | 21 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 6,880 |\n| 5   | Mudgere... | ... | 46 | 66 | 45 | \u2014 | 1 | \u2014 | 9,181 |\n\nTotal | ... | 138 | 163 | 136 | \u2014 | 2 | \u2014 | 37,249\n\n**Principal places, with population.**\u2014B\u00e1l\u00far, 1,433; A\u2019ld\u00far, 1,355; Banakal, 1,200; Mudgere, 1,149; Hosahalli, 1,051.\n\nThe taluq was formed in 1876 out of parts of Manjarabad, Belur and Vast\u00e1ra taluqs. In 1897 the Kalasa m\u00e1gan\u00ed was transferred to B\u00e1le Honnur taluq, and Bidarn\u00e1d added from Chikmagalur. The taluq is Maln\u00e1d and picturesque like all such country. The Hemavati has its source here and flows out at the south-east. The forests are not composed of such big trees as towards Lakvalli, but the hollows are well wooded and the many hanging woods on the hillsides impart great beauty to the landscape. The principal productions are coffee, areca-nut, cardamoms, rice and sugar-cane, the last in small quantity. The rice is dependent chiefly on springs in the hills from\nwhich watercourses are led. Dry crops are of no account and do not generally thrive. Coffee cultivation is extensive and important, and there are many estates under European superintendence. Tulu is much spoken by the labourers and others from South Kanara.\n\nThe nature of the Malnad country, its climate, the constitution of its society, and the character of its inhabitants, all conspire to produce a sort of semi-independence. There are some descriptive lines to the following effect which convey the same idea:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Hanneradu s\u00e1vira gudd\u00e1} & \\quad \\text{K\u00e1dl-ella sampige} \\\\\n\\text{A'ru s\u00e1vira daiva} & \\quad \\text{U'r-ella hegga\u0111e}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nTwelve thousand hills; six thousand demons: in every forest, champaka; in every village, a Hegga\u0111e (or local chief).\n\nThe hopeless inaccessibility of the country in past times, together with its natural fertility, seem to have whetted the rapacity of the governing powers, and the following is given as a history of the revenue exactions:\u2014\u201cThe m\u00e1ganis were more or less subject, first, to the Virada or Var\u00e1ha-shist of the Vijayanagar kingdom; then to the Rekha-shist of Sivappa N\u00e1yak; then to the additional imposts of other Ikk\u00e9ri rulers, P\u00e1lleg\u00e1rs, and Haidar Ali, called Dasoha, Pagadi and Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di, or more generally Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di; then to the Paim\u00e1yish of P\u00farnaiya and the increased assessment imposed by him under the name of Shist-j\u00e1sti and K\u00e1n\u00edke; and by the process of commuting the money-assessment of some of the best lands for a grain contribution for the use of the R\u00e1ja\u2019s M\u00f3dikh\u00e1na; then to the impositions of over-zealous Amildars, mostly of this Minister\u2019s time, who, in villages rented in block to the Patels or other principal inhabitants, having found that these collected more than the Shist and Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di from the cultivators, carried this excess to account under the name of Beriz-j\u00e1sti; then to the arbitrary exactions of the Amildar during the R\u00e1ja\u2019s time, to which the Sharti system then in vogue necessarily gave rise; and then to the enhancement caused, after the assumption of the country by the British Government, by the Amildars to whom the duty of converting P\u00farnaiya\u2019s grain contribution into Suvarn\u00e1d\u00e1ya or money rent again was entrusted, and who settled the new money rates with reference to the Chads\u00e1l-jama or the highest share that had ever been realized, or with the aid of the more insidious Dhan-gutta system, which, professing nominally to levy only the grain rent, as a means of allaying the clamours of more suspicious ryots, levied a money rent in reality by compelling them to take the grain at an arbitrarily fixed price. Again, as in other Malnad parts, there was also the plan of compelling the ryots to keep in their holding every field they may at different times have taken either of their own accord or in consequence of pressure used\nto induce them to take up the holdings of their deceased relatives or neighbours, and to pay for these fields whether they were cultivated or waste. On the other hand, generally as a compromise necessarily due from the above extremely rigorous method of management to the actual exigencies of the revenue, it was customary to grant the concessions of the Shr\u00e1ya or Alave system, or reductions in whole or in part under the name of Tavaguf or B\u00e1ki, of the Beriz-j\u00e1sti or Pa\u1e6d\u1e6di, and even of the Shist, on the ground of the general excessiveness of the combined assessment, or of S\u00e1guvali-nashta, Kula-nashta and Nisthalu, which suppose so much waste rice-land or sup\u00e1ri garden, or of Alate-kammi and Hari-mara, which imply an actual deficiency either in the recorded extent of land or in the number of trees that should ordinarily be standing thereon in the sup\u00e1ri gardens.\"\n\nThe revenue settlement, based on a regular survey, which put an end to all these irregularities, was introduced in 1881, except in Gonibid m\u00e1ga\u1e47i, which was settled in 1877 with Bel\u00far taluq. The Kalasa m\u00e1ga\u1e47i, with an area of about 200 square miles, has now (1897) been transferred to B\u00e1le Honnur. Bearing these differences in mind, the following was the distribution of the area at the time of the settlement:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 7,357; wet, 25,900; garden, 1,583) | ... | ... | 34,840 |\n| Unculturable (roads, village sites, hittalus, etc.) | ... | ... | 230,864 |\n| 13 Coffee estates | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 6,086 |\n| **Total acres** | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | **271,790** |\n\nThe unoccupied area was 5,511 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 1,47,590, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 1,70,643.\n\nThe average rainfall at M\u00fadgere for 26 years (1870\u201395) has been as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| 0'22 | 0'04 | 0'62 | 2'33  | 5'25 | 18'87| 30'17| 16'74| 10'16 | 9'35 | 3'12 | 0'60 | 97'47 |\n\nAnother register for 16 years makes the annual average 102'50.\n\nThe road from Chikmagalur to the B\u00fand Ghat runs through the taluq from north-east to south-west by M\u00fadgere, with branches from Kotigih\u00e1r north to B\u00e1le Honnur and westwards to Kalasa. From M\u00fadgere there are roads east to Bel\u00far, south to Manjarabad, and south-west to Uggihalli. But the best road to Bel\u00far is from Anjur through Gonibid.\n\n**M\u00fadgere.**\u2014A village situated in 13\u00b0 8' N. lat., 75\u00b0 41' E. long., on the road from Chikmagalur to the B\u00fand Ghat, 19 miles south-west of\nChikmagalur. Head-quarters of the M\u00fadgere taluq. Population, 1,149. It owes its importance to being the taluq station. The road to Manjarabad also branches off here.\n\n**Sakkarepatna.**\u2014A village in the Kadur taluq, 11 miles south-west of the kasba, on the Kadur-Chikmagalur road. Population, 1,846.\n\nA large weekly fair is held on Friday. At the car festival of Rangan\u00e1tha, held in Vaish\u00e1kha, as many as 3,000 rams are sacrificed in honour of the god.\n\nTradition relates that it was in olden times the capital of Rukm\u00e1n-gada, a king mentioned in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata. Objects of interest in the town are the monument to Hon-billa, sacrificed for the stability of the Ayyankere (which see); a great gun, and an immense slab of stone, about 12 feet square and several inches thick, supported on 4 pillars. This is called Vira Ball\u00e1la Chauki and is said to have been the royal seat of justice. During the time of the Vijayanagar kings the town became a possession of the Aigur or Balam chiefs. It was next taken by the N\u00e1yaks of Ikk\u00e9ri. Sri Ranga R\u00e1ya, the fallen king of the Vijayanagar state, took refuge with the Ikk\u00e9ri chief, who espoused his cause and established him in power at Sakkarepatna. But in 1690 it was taken by the Mysore army and retained by the treaty of 1694.\n\n**Santaveri.**\u2014A small village, principally composed of Lamb\u00e1nis, situated on the eastern face of the B\u00e1ba Budan mountains, just below K\u00e1man durga. It is on the Chikmagalur-Tarikere road, about midway between those two places. A road hence leads to Kalhatti and the summit of the mountains.\n\n**Sringeri.**\u2014A j\u00e1gir in Koppa taluq, belonging to the chief ma\u1e6dha of the Sm\u00e1rta Brahmans. It is administered in imitation of the Mysore revenue system, and contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n| No. | Hoblis       | Villages | Hamlets | Population |\n|-----|--------------|----------|---------|------------|\n| 1   | Chadravalli-p\u00e1lu | 52       | 2       | 1,529      |\n| 2   | Hejje Hounavalli-p\u00e1lu | 70       | 13      | 3,974      |\n| 3   | K\u00e9la-p\u00e1lu    | 63       | 4       | 1,794      |\n| 4   | M\u00e9lu-p\u00e1lu    | 43       | 7       | 1,764      |\n| 5   | Silakara\u1e0dli  | 5        |         | 83         |\n\nTotal ... 233 26 9,144\n\nThe j\u00e1gir seems, from an inscription at the place, to have been granted as an endowment of the ma\u1e6dha in 1346, by Hariyap-O\u1e0deyar (or Harihara, the first king of Vijayanagar), his four brothers\u2014Kampan\u1e47a.\nBukkanna, M\u00e1rapa and Muddapa\u2014son-in-law Ballappa Danayaka, and the latter's son S\u00e1vanna. In an inscription of 1621 the Keladi king Venkatappa Nayak, who describes himself as grandson of Sad\u00e1siva Nayak, claims to have re-established Sring\u00e9ri, from which it would appear that some interruption had occurred in the enjoyment of the j\u00e1gir. It is about 8 miles long by 6 miles wide, and has the river Tunga running through it from south-west to north-east. The country is pure Mah\u00e1d, and similar in character to the adjoining Koppa and B\u00e1le Honn\u00far taluqs. The revenue is estimated at Rs. 50,000 a year, which is supplemented by Rs. 12,000 from the Mysore State.\n\nA road from Koppa to Nem\u00e1r runs through Sring\u00e9ri, where it is crossed by one from Beg\u00e1r to B\u00e1le Honn\u00far. There is also a road from Sring\u00e9ri to Kigga.\n\nSring\u00e9ri.\u2014A sacred village on the left bank of the Tunga, situated in 13\u00b0 25' N. lat., 75\u00b0 19' E. long., in the Koppa taluq, 15 miles southwest of the kasba, and a municipality. Population, 1,987.\n\nIt is the head-quarters of the Jagad-guru, the high priest of the Sm\u00e1rta Brahmans, who is proprietor of the surrounding tract of country. Sring\u00e9ri, Sringa-giri or Rishya Sringa-giri is related to have been the place where Vibh\u00e1ndaka rishi performed penance, and where Rishya Sringa, a celebrated character of the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, was born. The latter, according to the narrative, grew up to man's estate without having ever seen a woman; when Lomap\u00e1da, king of Anga, was advised that if the youthful recluse could be brought to his city and married to the princess S\u00e1nta the drought which prevailed in his kingdom would be removed. In order to entice the young saint from his hermitage a bevy of fair damsels was despatched. They are said to have made their last halt at N\u00e1rve, a few miles from Sring\u00e9ri, before essaying the power of their charms. Allurements, which even the most wary can rarely withstand, soon worked their effect on the unsophisticated youth. His curiosity being strongly excited to see more of these beautiful and gentle creatures so new to him, he was led away and conveyed to Anga. He afterwards became the priest of Dasaratha R\u00e1ya, and performed the asvamedha or horse sacrifice which resulted in the birth of Rama.\n\nIn subsequent times the great Saiva reformer Sankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya settled here, as directed by the image of S\u00e1rad-amma or Sarasvati, which he had brought from Kashmir; and founded the spiritual throne which has been occupied down to the present day by as apostolical a succession as the papal chair. The 8th century is now proved to be the period of Sankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya's religious conquests and revival of Siva worship. His opposition to the Buddhists and Jains, his destruction\nof their literature, and his polemical victories in all parts of India are matters of history. The Sring\u00e9ri Sw\u00e1mi is a man of eminent learning and great sanctity. His claims to reverence are admitted by all votaries of Siva, whether of the Sm\u00e1rta or any other communion. The enormous sums obtained from the piety of his disciples during his tours in various parts are spent with a lavish hand in hospitality and works of charity so called. He is often away from his capital on such expeditions for several years.\n\nSring\u00e9ri consists of a long street, with a loop on one side, encircling a small hill, Sringa-giri, on which stands a temple of Mallik\u00e1rjuna. There are said to be 120 temples in the place, one being a Jain basti. Many Brahman houses have a temple in the yard behind, of which the resident Brahman is the officiant. At the head of the street is the matha of the guru, within which is the temple of S'\u00e1rad-amna, whose image is said to be of pure gold. At the side of the matha is the temple of Vidy\u00e1s'ankara, an ornamental building of the Chalukyan style, on a raised terrace. Round the outer wall are sculptured images of various gods. At an angle on the right of the front entrance is a statue of Vy\u00e1sa, wearing a conical cap, the sacred thread and a dh\u00f3tra; his right hand in the position called abhaya hasta. He is imparting instruction to S'ankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya, whose statue, through the indentation of the plan, is at right angles to him. S\u00e1nkara has a palmyra leaf book in his left hand. These two figures, from being constantly anointed with oil, are quite black. Towards Vidy\u00e1ranypura, on the bank of the Tunga, is a small temple with an image of Sankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya seated as a yati. This is where he is said to have disappeared from life.\n\nSeveral large festivals occur during the year, the principal being the Navar\u00e1tri. On these occasions all classes are not only fed at the expense of the matha, but cloths and bodices are distributed to the women, and pieces of money to the men. The fishes in the river are sacred and daily fed at certain pools. Besides Rs. 50,000 a year, the revenue of the m\u00e1ga\u0144i, the cultivation of which is rice and areca-nut, the religious establishment is supported by a grant of Rs. 1,000 a month from the Mysore State.\n\nTarikere.\u2014A taluq in the north-east. Area 459 square miles. Head-quarters at Tarikere. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n---\n\n1 There is a good deal of toleration in religious matters in these parts, such as prevailed in the old times before sectarian prejudice became so bitter. Thus, the Ling\u00e1yits, I heard, are reconciled by being allowed to blow their conch-shells in the processions at S'ring\u00e9ri. Jain inscriptions (as at Kalbasti) begin with the usual verse in praise of S'iva. A Jain temple at Horan\u00e1d is served by a Havika Brahman.\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Tarikere, 7,056; Ajjampur 2,890; Sivane, 1,806; Lakvalli, 1,358; Kudlur, 1,250; Lingadahalli, 1,228; Durvigere, 1,015; Hunasagutta, 1,007.\n\nThis taluq is partly hilly and partly plain, the soil and climate being as varied as the configuration. Along the north are the Ubr\u00e1ni hills, which throw out short spurs into the plains. These were at one time covered with thick bamboo jungle. Around Ajjampur and up to the eastern border black cotton soil prevails, on which fine crops of wheat, cotton, Bengal gram, great millet, etc., are raised. All this portion of the taluq is perfectly bare of trees, and there is a good deal of saline efflorescence. In other portions red, sandy and gravelly soils are found, on which r\u00e1gi and different kinds of pulse are cultivated. The western portions of the taluq are semi-Maln\u00e1d.\n\nA portion of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budan range enters the taluq in the southwest, the slopes of which are covered with heavy forest, partially cleared for coffee plantations. Fine iron ore is much worked in the Ubr\u00e1ni hills, and those at Lingadahalli at the foot of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budans. In the hills near Ajjampur very extensive old gold workings have been discovered, and gold-mining is being revived under European superintendence by the Kadur-Mysore Company.\n\nDuring the period of the Hoysala sovereignty the greater part of the taluq appears to have formed a principality, whose chief seat was at K\u00e1tur, a village near Tarikere. It was subsequently subdued by the Muhammadan forces which took Dorasamudra in the first part of the 14th century, but the line of chiefs seems to have been restored to power under the Vijayanagar sovereigns. After the fall of Vijayanagar, the p\u00e1legars of Basvapatna, being driven south by the invasions of the Bijapur army, gained possession of the country and founded Tarikere, from which they subsequently took their name. The\nterritory eventually became subject to the Mughal government established at Sira, and so passed into the possession of Haidar Ali in 1761, and became a part of Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1877. The area of the taluq at that time was distributed as follows:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 158,829; wet, 9,404; garden, 2,547) ... ... 170,780\n- Unculturable (roads, village sites, &c.) ... ... ... 152,420\n\nTotal acres ... ... ... 323,200\n\nThe unoccupied area was 67,813 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,80,673, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 2,02,937.\n\nThe following was the average rainfall at Tarikere for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other stations for three years (1893-5):\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Tarikere | 0\u00b016 | 0\u00b012 | 0\u00b028 | 0\u00b087 | 2\u00b063 | 3\u00b039 | 6\u00b044 | 3\u00b060 | 3\u00b002 | 5\u00b000 | 1\u00b088 | 0\u00b046 | 27\u00b085 |\n| Ajjampur... | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 2\u00b073 | 2\u00b098 | 3\u00b017 | 3\u00b047 | 2\u00b040 | 2\u00b094 | 2\u00b095 | 0\u00b085 | \u2014 | 21\u00b049 |\n| Shivane | ... | \u2014 | \u2014 | 2\u00b070 | 2\u00b021 | 7\u00b057 | 2\u00b087 | 1\u00b070 | 2\u00b034 | 3\u00b033 | 1\u00b001 | 0\u00b088 | 23\u00b081 |\n\nAnother register for 16 years makes the average annual rainfall at Tarikere 31\u00b088.\n\nThe Bangalore-Poona railway runs near the south-east boundary, with stations at Ajjampur and Shivani. A branch from Birur is being made through Tarikere to Shimoga. The Bangalore-Shimoga road runs through Tarikere, whence there are roads west through Lakvalli to the Agumbi Ghat, east through Ajjampur to Hosdurga, and south along the eastern face of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budans to Santaveri and Chikmagalur, as well as over the summit near Kalhatti. From Lingadahalli there is a road to Birur railway station, and from Santaveri a short road to Kalhatti bungalow and the summit of the mountains.\n\n**Tarikere.**\u2014A town, situated in 13\u00b0 42' N. lat., 75\u00b0 52' E. long., on the Birur-Shimoga railway and the Bangalore-Shimoga road, 35 miles north of Chikmagalur.

The town and neighbouring territory were bestowed, it is said, on a chief named Kanehada arasu. A descendant of his, named K\u00e1ma Chakresvara R\u00e1ya, fortified K\u00e1mandurga on the B\u00e1ba Budans. The territory was afterwards subdued by Bukka Raya of Vijayanagar, and given to one of his Dan\u00e1yaks, or generals. The latter was succeeded at his death by S\u00e1l\u00fava Narsinga Raya, who transferred it to his brother K\u00e1rtika R\u00e1ya, and retired to Benkipur. Krishna R\u00e1ya, the son of K\u00e1rtika R\u00e1ya, constructed many useful irrigation works during his reign, among others the Tarikere-katte-hole. His son-in-law, Hale R\u00e1ma R\u00e1ya, followed, in whose time the territory was subdued by the Bijapur army.\n\nThe territory of K\u00e1tur is said to have been subsequently bestowed upon Sarja Hanumappa N\u00e1yak, p\u00e1legar of Basvapatna, by the Mughals. A descendant of the same name, while hunting, saw a hare turn upon the hounds, and erected on the spot where this occurred the fort and town of Tarikere, so named from the number of tari trees (mimosa catechu) which grew there. The date assigned for this event is 1569. This line of chiefs, since known as the Tarikere p\u00e1legars, continued in power till subdued in 1761 by Haidar Ali, who annexed the territory to Mysore, granting the chief a maintenance allowance. The representative of the house took a leading part in the rebellion of 1830, which ended in the assumption of the government by the British. His son continued at large, creating disturbances, till 1834, when he was seized and hanged.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income         | ...    | 4,485  | 4,311  | 5,134  | 6,093  | 6,925  |\n| Expenditure... | ...    | 6,875  | 4,965  | 5,881  | 4,580  | 6,432  |\n\nTunga.\u2014A river which rises in the same spot as the sister stream of the Bhadra\u2014namely, at Gang\u00e1m\u00fala, in the Var\u00e1ha peak of the Western Ghats, in the south-western angle of the Koppa taluq.\n\n---\n\n1 In confirmation of this it may be stated that one of the standards for garden measurement in the western portion of the taluq, down to so late as 1849, was the Hanuman d\u00edya, the measure of the left foot of the image of Hanuman at Hire K\u00e1tur. Of such feet 18 were computed to be equal to one k\u00e1ti, and 100 k\u00e1tis = 4,987 yards.\ngeneral course is north-east, but at Baggunji it turns to the north-west and keeps that direction to near Tirthahalli. Thence, with a sudden bend to the north-east, it takes its course past the town of Shimoga, and flows on to the point of confluence with the Bhadra at K\u00fadali; from which point commences the united stream of the Tungabhadra.\n\n**Vastara.**\u2014A village in Chikmagalur taluq, on the Chikmagalur-Mudgere road, 6 miles south-west of the kasba. Till 1875 it was the head-quarters of a taluq named after itself. Population, 882.\n\nIt is situated at the entrance to the Malnad country. The name is said to be a corruption of *vasu-dara*, land bestowed, that is, as an endowment. The foundation of the town is due to a S\u00e1ntarasa, one of the Humcha kings, and it was subsequently held by their descendants the P\u00e1ndya rulers of Sisugali and the Bairasa Wodeyars of Karkala. The chiefs of Balam and of Ikk\u00e9ri in turn possessed it. Though taken by the Mysore army in 1690, it was one of the places restored to Ikk\u00e9ri by the treaty of 1694. The conquest of Bednur by Haidar Ali in 1763 annexed it to Mysore.\n\n**Vedavati or Haggari.**\u2014A river which, after a lengthened course, principally through the Chitaldroog District, flows into the Tungabhadra in the Bellary District. It is formed by the union of two streams, the *Veda* and the *Avati*, which spring from the eastern side of the B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budan mountains. The immediate source of the Veda is the Gauri halla, which, rising near Mulainagiri, flows eastwards, and is embanked at a gorge near Sakunagiri, expanding into the Ayyankere. The stream, on leaving this tank, takes the name of the Veda, and, skirting the town of Sakkarepatna, flows north-east to Kadur. The Avati also rises near Mulainagiri, and after forming the Madaga tank, continues east to Kadur. The two streams unite at Tangli, 3 miles south-east of Kadur, and form the Vedavati, which shortly enters the Chitaldroog District.\n\n**Yedehalli.**\u2014A town in Koppa taluq, 14 miles north-east of the kasba, on the Tarikere-Agumbi road. Till 1882 it was the head-quarters of the Lakvalli taluq, and then till 1897 the head-quarters of the Yedehalli sub-taluq attached to Koppa taluq. It is a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|--------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 3 Jains) ... | 701   | 727     | 1,428 |\n| Muhammadans ... | 199   | 208     | 407   |\n| Christians | 1     | 1       | 2     |\n| **Total** | **901** | **936** | **1,837** |\nYedehalli is said to be so called because there was formerly a Siv\u00e1ch\u00e1ra m\u0101tha here, at which food (yede) was given every day to travellers. The town consists of two portions, the fort and the petta, which are a considerable distance apart. At the end of the 16th century it belonged to the p\u00e1legars of Tarikere, and afterwards fell into the hands of the Ikk\u00e9ri chiefs. It is the residence of several wealthy merchants, being an entrep\u00f4t for the produce of the Maln\u00e1d and a place of considerable traffic between the east and west of the country.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1891-2 | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 858    | 845    | 1,030  | 737    | 1,224  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 1,496  | 1,142  | 1,118  | 563    | 1,422  |\nSHIMOGA DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014A District in the north-west; situated between $13^\\circ 28'$ and $14^\\circ 38'$ north latitude, and between $74^\\circ 41'$ and $76^\\circ 9'$ east longitude. Its greatest length is 95 miles from east to west. From north to south the longest line is 80 miles.\n\nArea.\u2014Its area is computed at 4,009 square miles; of which 1,132 square miles are under cultivation, and 2,463 square miles unculturable and waste.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the east and south by the Chitaldroog and Kadur Districts respectively, on the north by Dharwar, and on the north west by North Kanara, both belonging to the Bombay Presidency, and on the west by South Kanara of the Madras Presidency.\n\nDivisions.\u2014The S\u00e1g\u00e1r Sub-Division, formed in 1891, comprises the Sorab, S\u00e1g\u00e1r and Nagar taluqs. The whole District consists of the following taluqs. Kumsi is a sub-taluq under Shimoga taluq.\n\n| No. | Taluq       | Area, sq. miles | No. of Hoblis | No. of Villages or Towns | Population | Per sq. mile |\n|-----|-------------|-----------------|---------------|--------------------------|------------|--------------|\n| 1   | Channagiri  | 465             | 5             | 243                      | 74,218     | 159.60       |\n| 2   | Honn\u00e1li     | 329             | 3             | 167                      | 63,527     | 193.09       |\n| 3   | Nagar       | 529             | 6             | 204                      | 42,841     | 80.98        |\n| 4   | S\u00e1g\u00e1r       | 666             | 6             | 246                      | 58,999     | 88.58        |\n| 5   | Shik\u00e1rpur   | 428             | 6             | 197                      | 64,404     | 150.47       |\n| 6   | Shimoga     | 659             | 7             | 393                      | 94,716     | 143.72       |\n| 7   | Sorab       | 461             | 6             | 306                      | 70,047     | 151.94       |\n| 8   | T\u00edrthahalli | 472             | 5             | 244                      | 59,229     | 125.48       |\n\nTotal | 4,009 | 44 | 2,000 | 527,981 | 131.69\n\nPhysical features.\u2014A line drawn from Talguppa to Anantapur and thence to the Ghats through Masarur and Kavaledurga, with one from this last point to Kodach\u00e1dri Parvata, would nearly correspond with the watersheds which separate the main lines of drainage. All the streams to the south, east and north of the line flow to the Tunga-\nbhadra; those on the west to the Sharavati, and those on the south-west to the Gargita. The main part of the District therefore consists of the western slopes of the upper Tungabhadra valley.\n\nThis river is formed by the union, at Kudali, of the Tunga and the Bhadra, of which the former runs most of its course within this District, in a north-easterly direction. From the point of confluence of the united streams the river runs north to the frontier, which it follows north-eastwards to beyond Harihara, receiving on the left bank the Choradi and on the right the Haridra. Thence, leaving the Mysore, it runs north, separating Madras from Bombay until joined on the left by the Varada, when again turning north-east, it marks the boundary between Madras and the Nizam\u2019s dominions, and receiving on the right the Haggari or Vedavati, flows past Hampe, the site of the ancient cities of Kishkindha, Anegundi and Vijayanagar, into the Krishna beyond Karnul.\n\nThe Sharavati rises near Kavaledurga and, uniting with the Haridravati on the right, pursues a north-west course to the frontier. Thence turning west it hurls itself down the Ghats by the J\u00f3g or far-famed Falls of Gersoppa, a sheer descent of over 900 feet, and runs into the sea at Honavar (Honore).\n\nThe streams rising between Kodach\u00e1dri Parvata and Kavaledurga flow west or south-west into the sea at Kundapur, the principal one being the Gargita, which descends to S. Kanara from the head of the Haidar Ghar Ghat.\n\nThe western side of the District, resting upon the Ghats, is very mountainous and covered with magnificent forest, the highest point being the Kodach\u00e1dri Parvata, a fine peak situated 10 miles north-west of Nagar. Its elevation is 4,411 feet above the level of the sea. Govardhangiri in S\u00e1g\u00e1r, and Chandragutti in Sorab, are also conspicuous hills, the height of the latter being 2,794 feet.\n\nThe interior of the District is crossed at the central watershed by a chain of hills running from Mandagadde on the Tunga northwards, between Anantapur and Kumsi, towards Sorab, and by a range from Atav\u00e1di westwards through Ikk\u00e9ri to T\u00e1lguppa. On the east are two lines of low, stony hills stretching from the south of Channagiri to the frontier, one following the course of the Tungabhadra northwards, the other crossing that river near Hole Honnur and passing near Shikarpur. The south-west around Nagar and Kavaledurga is full of hills.\n\nThe general elevation of the District along the watershed is about 2,100 feet above sea level, falling to 1,900 in the east and west. The height of Anantapur has been determined as 2,101 feet; east of which, Shimoga is 1,899 and Benkipur 1,872; while on the west, T\u00e1lguppa is\n1,956, S\u00e1g\u00e1r 1,973, Kollur Katte 1,928, Nagar 1,887, and Haidarghar 1,896. The head of the chasm at the Falls of Gersoppa is 1,670 feet.\n\nThe greater part of the District is reckoned as Maln\u00e1d or hill country, which, roughly speaking, may be described as occupying all to the west of a line drawn from Shikarpur to Gajanur; the eastern portion being Maid\u00e1n or Bailu s\u00edm\u00e9, open country. The whole of the first-named region presents a range of scenery abounding with every charm of tropical forests and mountain wilds. Trees of the largest size stand thickly together over miles of unbroken ranks, their giant trunks entwined with creepers of python dimensions, their massive arms decked with a thousand bright blossoming orchids. Birds of rare plumage flit from bough to bough. From the thick woods, which abruptly terminate on verdant swards, bison issue forth in the early morn and afternoon to browse on the rich herbage, while large herds of elk pass rapidly across the hillsides. Packs of wild dogs cross the path, hunting in company, and the warning boom of the great langur monkey is heard from the lofty trees. The bamboo forest has beauties of its own, whether waving in immense fronds of delicate green foliage, or whitening with its rice-like grain. Lively gardens of the elegant areca palm, for which Nagar is famous; the k\u00e1ns of Sorab, with the rich hues of wild cinnamon and the sombre green of the jack, intermingled with the truncated leaf of the begni palm, and the waving bunches of the pepper vine; the magnificent avenues of the dh\u00edpa tree in S\u00e1g\u00e1r:\u2014all unite to vary the attractions of a region replete with every natural beauty. The view from the head of the descent to the Falls of Gersoppa is probably one of the choicest bits of scenery in the world.\n\nThe features of the open country are tame in comparison with those of the woodland tracts, but there is much that is picturesque in the fertile taluq of Channagiri with its large S\u00falekere lake, the finest reservoir with one exception in the south of India.\n\n**Rocks.**\u2014Laterite is abundantly found and quarried in the western taluqs. The square blocks form the most common building material, being used not only for dwelling-houses, but for bridges and other public erections. Broken up it forms metalling for roads.\n\n**Minerals.**\u2014Iron ore is extracted in some parts. On the summit of the Ghats stones are frequently found possessing magnetic properties, as at Kodach\u00e1dri. Gold is widely diffused and a broad auriferous tract extends throughout the eastern half of the District. Gold-mining under European direction has been commenced in the Honn\u00e1li gold-field and south of Benkipur on the Bhadra.\n\n**Soil.**\u2014The general substratum of laterite in the western taluqs, wherever it approaches the surface, checks vegetation. The soil in the\nrice valleys, so characteristic of the Maln\u00e1di, is loose and sandy, while that of garden lands is stiff and clayey. The richest soil of the District is in the north-east, from the S\u00falekere northwards. The black soil here prevails, as also around Ny\u00e1mti and Belgutti in Honn\u00e1li taluq.\n\n**Climate.**\u2014Approaching as it does at one point within 8 miles of the sea, and extending eastwards nearly 100 miles, the District presents much variety of climate in different parts. For about 25 miles from the Ghats the south-west monsoon is felt in full force, the annual fall of rain at Nagar being from 150 to 170 inches. East of this line, however, the quantity rapidly diminishes, being at Shimoga about 31, and at Channagiri only about 25, or less. At Shimoga, which is 40 miles from the nearest Ghats, the south-west monsoon often produces nothing more than driving clouds with a strong steady breeze and moist cool atmosphere, with occasional drizzle and a few days of moderately heavy rain. East of the junction of the Tunga and Bhadra, the wind blows during the height of the monsoon with much force, but the clouds which are carried along with it rarely break. The heaviest rains on this side are in May and October, and come in thunder-storms from the eastward. The order of the seasons has been observed as follows by Mr. Stokes:\n\n\"In the middle of March, or a little before the commencement of the Hindu year, the weather becomes close and hot, the prevailing wind from the west being frequently interrupted by calms. In the course of the next fifteen days thunder-showers fall, which are sometimes very violent, and the first or second is usually a hail-storm, the hailstones varying from the size of a musket-ball to that of a pigeon\u2019s egg. These occasional showers continue through the month of April, but the heat is relieved on the western side of the District by the sea-breeze, which is felt distinctly at Shimoga. In May the weather gets still more uncertain, and before the close of the month one or more violent squalls occur, accompanied with heavy rain. About the end of the first week in June the south-west monsoon generally sets in and blows almost without intermission until the end of July or middle of August. A break then ensues, which lasts for 15 or 20 days, usually with a clear sky and little wind or rain. The monsoon, however, returns again, sometimes with much force, and continues till the end of September, when the weather again becomes unsettled, and thunder-storms from the east alternate with hot sunshine, till about the 10th of October, soon after which the north-east monsoon sets in. A dry north-east wind, mostly with a clear sky, blows daily from nine o\u2019clock a.m. till sunset, sometimes with great violence. The rapidity with which evaporation goes on during this wind is astonishing. The roads which\nhave been broken up into deep quagmires become in a few days dusty, and not a vestige is left of the numerous pools which had been visible all over the country. The water in the paddy fields is dried up, and the crops, till then green, become immediately dry. At this time the nights are calm and very clear, and a heavy dew falls. The mornings are very cool and sometimes foggy. The cold increases till about the 10th of January, and from the middle of December till the end of January the thermometer at daylight is not often more than $50^\\circ$; the cold then moderates, and the sea-breeze is sometimes felt in the evening and at night, and commonly brings with it a heavy fog, which in the Maln\u00e1d is so thick in the morning that objects cannot be seen at the distance of 10 yards. It seldom clears till past nine o\u2019clock.\n\n**Temperature.**\u2014The following are given as the results of thermometric observations at Shimoga in 1892, the latest procurable:\n\n|       | Max. | Mean. | Min. | Highest Reading | Lowest Reading |\n|-------|------|-------|------|-----------------|---------------|\n| May   | 92\u00b045| 56\u00b023 |      | 98              | 53            |\n| July  | 84\u00b071| 55\u00b094 |      | 92              | 55            |\n| December | 83\u00b085| 54\u00b040 |      | 85              | 49            |\n\nThe average temperature in the preceding years was:\n\n| Year | 9 A.M. | 3 P.M. | 9 A.M. | 3 P.M. |\n|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 1890 | 74\u00b098  | 78\u00b073  | 69\u00b083  | 78\u00b020  |\n\n**Rainfall.**\u2014The average annual rainfall at Shimoga, calculated on the observations recorded for 26 years (1870\u201395) is 34\u00b050 inches, or, according to another register for 14 years, 36\u00b099 inches. As previously stated, this rate is very greatly exceeded in the Maln\u00e1d districts according to their greater or less proximity to the Ghats. The monthly average is given under each taluq, but the average annual rate at other taluq and sub-taluq stations was as follows:\n\nChannagiri ... 25\u00b090 or 26\u00b034 S\u00e1g\u00e1r ... ... ... 71\u00b006 or 69\u00b071\nHonn\u00e1li ... ... 22\u00b069 ,, 22\u00b099 Shik\u00e1rpur ... ... ... 30\u00b013 ,, 31\u00b033\nKumsi ... ... 38\u00b094 Sorab ... ... ... 56\u00b020 ,, 57\u00b048\nNagar ... ... 184\u00b043 ,, 192\u00b059 Tirthahalli ... ... ... 116\u00b010 ,, 110\u00b035\n\nThe actual annual fall at Shimoga has been recorded as below:\n\n| Year | In.c. | Year | In.c. | Year | In.c. | Year | In.c. |\n|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|\n| 1837 | 27\u00b04  | 1846 | 32\u00b07  | 1855 | 15\u00b06  | 1864 | 34\u00b07  |\n| 1838 | 15\u00b08  | 1847 | 31\u00b03  | 1856 | 24\u00b07  | 1865 | 34\u00b01  |\n| 1839 | 31    | 1848 | 33\u00b06  | 1857 | 22\u00b01  | 1866 | 36\u00b03  |\n| 1840 | 23\u00b09  | 1849 | 39\u00b05  | 1858 | 33\u00b04  | 1867 | \u2014     |\n| 1841 | 23\u00b08  | 1850 | 38\u00b05  | 1859 | 31\u00b08  | 1868 | 34\u00b08  |\n| 1842 | 29    | 1851 | 20\u00b03  | 1860 | 20\u00b05  | 1869 | 26\u00b027 |\n| 1843 | 15\u00b03  | 1852 | 42\u00b08  | 1861 | 25\u00b08  | 1870 | 42\u00b074 |\n| 1844 | 30\u00b07  | 1853 | 29\u00b04  | 1862 | 24\u00b07  | 1871 | 35\u00b028 |\n| 1845 | 24\u00b01  | 1854 | 26\u00b01  | 1863 | 31\u00b03  | 1872 | 64\u00b046 |\n\nE E 2\nVegetation. \u2014 The Western Ghats and the country immediately below them are covered with magnificent evergreen forest. Many of the hills are heavily wooded up to their summits. In some parts the undergrowth is dense, elsewhere the forest is open, and on all sides trees with clear stems to the first branch of from 80 to 100 feet meet the eye. The great bulk of these trees can scarcely be realized except by actual measurement. The more valuable kinds are poon, wild jack, ebony, som\u00e9, heigni, erool; d\u00fapada mara, the large d\u00e9vad\u00e1ram, gamboge and a species of cedar. The wealth of timber in these forests is almost entirely unproductive, owing to the inaccessible nature of the country.\n\nMore to the east, as far as a line from Anavatti to midway between Shik\u00e1rpur and Honn\u00e1li and thence to Sakrebail, is a rich and productive belt of vegetation, including the k\u00e1ns of Sorab, areca palm and cardamom gard. and the rich rice-flats of S\u00e1gar, Nagar and Tirthahalli. Within this tract are the State and District forests. The more important trees are teak, black wood, honne, matti, sampaji, arsent\u00e9ga, alale, biridi, bilv\u00e1ra, b\u00e1gi, s\u00e1gade or chend\u00e1la, jambe, dindiga, hulvati or n\u00e1mad\u00e1ri, h\u00fanal and mashi, jani, kadaga, kuli, kalt\u00e9ka, nelli, naval\u00e1di, nandi, pach\u00e1ri, shi-anv\u00edge, tapasi, and kendatsal.\n\nTeak, not of the largest size, is found in Shik\u00e1rpur, Kumsi and Sakrebail. Bamboo is abundant everywhere. Sandal is most plentiful in Sorab, S\u00e1gar and Nagar taluqs. It also grows in parts of Shimoga and Shik\u00e1rpur, and a little in Chaunagiri and Honn\u00e1li.\n\nThe taluq of Sorab abounds with k\u00e1ns, many of which are cultivated with pepper vines, and sometimes coffee. The sago palm (*caryota urens*) is also much grown for the sake of its toddy. These k\u00e1ns are apparently the remains of the old forests, which appear once to have stretched as far east as Anavatti. At the present day at Anavatti itself there is no wood, and the surrounding country is clothed with either scrub jungle or small deciduous forest, generally pentapterous. K\u00e1ns are found also in S\u00e1gar, Nagar, and the other Malnad taluqs, but those in Sorab are, from their number, situation and accessibility, the most valuable.\n\nThe S\u00e1gar taluq is not so thickly wooded as that of Sorab, except along the Ghats. The adjoining taluq of Nagar possesses heavy forests.\n\n---\n\n1 Compiled from the Annual Report of the Forest Department.\nin the west (though several of the hills are cleared), but the wood grows generally in large k\u00e1ns, which are scattered unequally over the taluq. Going south to Tirthahalli much fine timber is found to the north of the Tunga, while to the south of the river the country is comparatively open. From Mandagadde in this taluq is a long stretch of wooded country, which runs north via Hannigeri through portions of the Shimoga taluq to the confines of Sorab and S\u00e1gar. In this strip there is good teak, much fine second-class timber, and a vast quantity of *inga xylocarpa*, which is largely used for making charcoal for the iron mines that abound near Masr\u00far, Shrigeri and other places in Anantapur and Shimoga.\n\nBetween Shik\u00e1rpur and Kumsi is a belt of jungle, parts of which have been placed on the State forest lists. In the eastern portions of Shik\u00e1rpur and Honn\u00e1li taluqs there is comparatively little wood. Between Shik\u00e1rpur and Sorab is a quantity of small pentapterous jungle near Udagani and Sir\u00e1lkoppa, which only requires conservation to grow up into a valuable second-class forest.\n\nThe Honn\u00e1li taluq is poorly wooded. Near Mal\u00e9benn\u00far, in the low hills to the east of the Tungabhadra, are the remains of old jungles, which apparently yielded small timber and much fuel. In Channagiri there is very little wood; in the south-west of the taluq is a small jungle.\n\n**Forests.**\u2014The reserved or State Forests occupy an area of 355 square miles, according to the following detailed statement:\n\n| Name                  | Sq. miles |\n|-----------------------|-----------|\n| Shankargudda          | ...       |\n| Butanbail             | ...       |\n| Sakrabail             | ...       |\n| Male Bennur           | ...       |\n| Telagadde             | ...       |\n| Kukvada Ubrani        | ...       |\n| Chorna Yedehalli      | ...       |\n| Masarur               | ...       |\n| Kumsi                 | ...       |\n| Kunchinhalli          | ...       |\n| Togarsi               | ...       |\n| Kavali                | ...       |\n| Basava Nandihalli     | ...       |\n| Are Telgadde          | ...       |\n| Karadi-betta          | ...       |\n| Belandur              | ...       |\n| Chandrakal            | ...       |\n| Gangavansara          | ...       |\n| Chandragatti          | ...       |\n| Bettadakurli          | ...       |\n| Kavadi                | ...       |\n| Malandur              | ...       |\n| Umblibail             | ...       |\n| Hunsekatte            | ...       |\n| Aldhara               | ...       |\n| Purdhai               | ...       |\n\n**Plantations.**\u2014There are 9 Forest plantations, occupying an area of 873 acres; and 2 Revenue plantations, covering 411 acres. Avenue trees have been planted on 611 miles of public road, giving a total of 126,654. Groves or topes number 261, containing 9,045 trees.\n\n**Cultivation.**\u2014Rice is the principal cultivated product of the District, of which more than 60 kinds are enumerated. Areca-nut is extensively grown in Nagar, S\u00edgar and Tirthahalli, that of the first-named place\nbeing considered superior to any in the Province. Sugar-cane is largely reared in Shik\u00e1rpur. Honn\u00e1li chiefly produces different kinds of dry grains as well as cotton. Pepper grows wild in the forests of Nagar and Sorab, while cardamoms are produced in the jungles about Agumbi, though not so good as those raised in areca gardens.\n\nThe sowing of rice commences in April and continues on till well in July. Reaping commences in November, and by the end of February or so is concluded. By the close of March, or a little after, the grain is threshed, and by the close of April or May is ready for the market.\n\nThe following are the names of the different kinds grown in the District:\n\n| Sakal\u00e1ti sanna | Chekkali bhatta | Varnagilli bhatta |\n|---------------|----------------|------------------|\n| D\u00e1sar         | Jangali        | Chale            |\n| Nerlagiri     | Hasar meluge bhatta | Nerogoli       |\n| Putti         | Kare d\u00e1di      | Ilaluganna       |\n| Bili          | Hunse huvina   | Kamariganna bhatta |\n| Kempu         | Bidane bija    | Kempu d\u00e1di banna s\u00e1le |\n| Marutra       | Kalave         | Bili             |\n| Nirlagiri     | Togarigina     | Nirada           |\n| Gauri         | Sidd\u00e1s\u00e1le      | Billikana hegge  |\n| Bhang\u00e1r kaddi bhatta | S\u00f3n\u00e1s\u00e1li | Juddi            |\n| Mentyas\u00e1le    | Jirige s\u00e1li    | Mardara          |\n| Kesari        | Motalingana    | Putti            |\n| Hasar kesari  | Hasibilevina   | Sampige d\u00e1l\u00e1     |\n| Kempu         | Bili hasadi    | Betta kend\u00e1l\u00e1    |\n| Hanes\u00e1le      | Mara hasadi    | B\u00e1le sul\u00ed        |\n| Keruvina      | Kugalli        | Hunkal mardiga   |\n| Ambe mori     | Kiruvannana    | Kavade doddiga   |\n| Hasadi        | Hasangana      | Kambu tige       |\n| Haralu honisana | Kodde     | Pusta manjari    |\n| Hudri         | Kurmi          | Bili mundakara   |\n| Jolasina      | G\u00fcgigonda      | Kempu            |\n\nNext to rice the most important wet crop is sugar-cane, of which the principal varieties cultivated are *kiri kabbu*, *mara kabbu*, *rastali*, and *pat\u1e6dapati* or *r\u00e1n rastali*. Planting operations commence in January and continue till June. The crop takes a twelvemonth or more to arrive at maturity, when it is cut and for the most part converted into jaggory, which is ready for the market about July of the year following that in which the cane was put down.\n\nThe coffee zone of the District is estimated to extend over 1,000 square miles, but a considerable portion of this area is not of the most favourable description. The number of plantations is 250, of which only half-a-dozen belong to Europeans. The area actually under coffee is 979 acres, distributed in the following taluqs:\u2014Nagar, 165; S\u00e1g\u00e1r, 5; Shimoga, 129; Tirthahalli, 680.\n\nIn 1861 an effort was made to stimulate the production of cotton, by the establishment in convenient localities of cotton gins manufactured in a workshop set up at Shimoga, and by the distribution of\nAmerican and Egyptian seed. But the attempt, owing to various causes, among others unfavourable seasons and the ravages of insects, to which the foreign plants seemed more particularly liable, was abandoned after a trial for two years.\n\n**Channels.**\u2014There are 165 anicuts on the rivers of the District and their feeders, from which are drawn channels for irrigation, having an aggregate length of 168 miles 1,007 yards. The following are the particulars:\n\n| Feeders of what Stream | No. of Anicuts | Length of Channels |\n|------------------------|---------------|-------------------|\n| Sharavati              | 70

articles contained in the above list, almost all the varieties of native vegetables are grown in gardens; where also are reared different kinds of fruits, such as mango, orange, lime, citron, guava, jack, jambalum, rose-apple, custard-apple, pine-apple, and r\u00e1mphal (bulb heart).\n\nThe places to which the agricultural productions of the District are exported are:\u2014Dharwar, Canara, Bellary, Birur, Chitaldroog, Harihara, Davangere, Koppa, Yedehalli, and Tarikere. The imports are chiefly from Dharwar, Canara, Coompta, Bellary, Kadur and Chitaldroog districts, Chiknayakanhalli, Mysore and Bangalore.\n\n**Wild Animals.**\u2014The larger game is most abundant in S\u00e1gar, where bison are common and elephants occasionally met with. Tigers, panthers and bears, which are the most feared by the people, are found principally to the west of Shimoga and in Shik\u00e1rpur. In Channagiri their numbers have been very greatly reduced. The wild boar, so destructive to crops, abounds in Channagiri, Nagar and other parts. Sambar, chital and jungle sheep are general in the wooded tracts. Elephants latterly became so numerous and destructive to the crops that attempts were made to reduce their numbers by shooting. But this was found ineffectual, and Keddah operations were started, resulting in the capture of over 60 elephants at Sakrebail at the end of 1894.\n\n**Birds.**\u2014Wild geese, ducks, and teal frequent the tanks in Channagiri and Shimoga, while pea-fowl and jungle-fowl are to be had in the woods.\n\n**Reptiles.**\u2014The crocodile is to be found in some of the streams, especially in the Tunga and in the tanks communicating with it.\n\n**Domestic Animals.**\u2014The best cattle in the District are to be met with in Channagiri, where there are several large k\u00e1vals belonging to the Amrit Mahal. About Shimoga the bullocks are a short, thickset breed, well adapted for agricultural purposes. The cows are very indifferent and give but little milk. Buffaloes are reared for the Malnad, the females being reserved for the dairy. These powerful animals are much used in Shik\u00e1rpur for all purposes, some being of enormous size. Droves of pack bullocks are kept in Nagar for the transport of grain to the coast. They are small in size and poorly nourished. During the rainy season they are driven to the large pasture grounds of S\u00e1gar, the grass in which, though very coarse, is considered good for cattle, as they thrive here better than in any other part of the Malnad. Asses are numerous in the neighbourhood of Shimoga, where also a few sheep and goats of inferior breed are reared.\n\n**Live Stock.**\u2014The District in 1893 contained 420,876 cows and buffaloes, 2,094 horses and ponies, and 46,771 sheep and goats.\nHISTORY\n\nThere are four copper-plate inscriptions in the District claiming to be grants made by the P\u00e1ndava emperor Janamejaya, son of Parikshit, of the Lunar line. This is the monarch to whom the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata was originally recited. The grant at the Bh\u00edmanakatte m\u0101\u1e6dha, near Tirthahalli, is dated in the year 89 of the Yudhishthira era, or B.C. 3012. The king is stated to be ruling at Kishkindha, and to have made the grant in the presence of the god Harihara, on the spot where his great-grandfather Yudhishthira had rested on the bank of the Tungabhadra.\u00b9\n\nThe other three grants\u2014Gauj, Kuppagadde and Begur, in Shik\u00e1rpur taluq\u2014profess to be grants made by Janamejaya to the officiating priests at the sarpa y\u00e1ga, or serpent sacrifice, which we have seen (under Kadur District) is supposed to have been performed at Hiremagalur. In these inscriptions the king is said to be ruling in Hastinapura, and to have made the grants in the presence of the god Harihara, at the confluence of the Tungabhadra and the Haridra. Their period, if genuine, would be about 3102 B.C., the commencement of the Kali-yuga, when Janamejaya is said to have reigned.\u00b2\n\nThe date of the Ganj agrah\u00e1ra plates was calculated by the Astronomer Royal, Sir G. Airy, to be really 1521 A.D., but this seems to have arisen from a mistake in the details as given to him. A native astronomer worked out the date for me as 3066 B.C. But an inscription discovered by me, dated Saka 366 (A.D. 444), expressed in similar terms but attributed to a Ch\u00e1lukya king Vira Nonamba, has thrown some light on the question, and in publishing it\u00b3 I examined the parallel passages and gave reasons for assigning all of them to about 1194 A.D. These and some other grants of a questionable character seem to be connected in some way with Henjeru (see Hemavati, Tumkur District) and Harihara (Chitaldroog District).\n\nThe legend of Jamadagni and Renuka (see Vol. I, p. 275) is also applied to this District, and at Chandragutti the latter is said to have performed the sah\u00fagamana and became a sati, leaving to her son Parasu R\u00e1ma the fulfilment of a curse upon K\u00e1rtiviry\u00e1rjuna, the murderer of her husband.\n\nAnother place of undoubted antiquity is the village of Kubattur, in\n\n\u00b9 Buchanan was shown a copy of an inscription at Banav\u00e1si said to be dated in 168 of the Yudhishthira era.\u2014Jour., II, 362.\n\u00b2 In Prinsep\u2019s Useful Tables Janamejaya is assigned to 1300 B.C. on the authority of Prof. Wilson according to the Bh\u00e1gavata Purana.\u2014Thomas, Ind.

Its former name was Kuntala-nagara, and tradition declares it to have been the capital of Chandrah\u00e1sa, the romantic story of whose life (see Vol. I, p. 283) occurs as an episode in the Mah\u00e1 Bh\u00e1rata,\u00b9 and is related at length in the popular Kannada poem, the Jaimini Bh\u00e1rata.\n\n**Mauryas** and **Guptas.**\u2014The earliest authentic history relating to the District is connected with the Mauryas. An inscription at Bandanikke (Shik\u00e1rpur taluq) says that they ruled over Kuntala, and in this province some parts of the Shimoga District were certainly included. The discovery by me of Edicts of As\u2019oka in Chitaldroog District has placed beyond doubt the fact of Maurya rule in the north of Mysore in the middle of the 3rd century B.C. We have also the statement in the Mah\u00e1wanso that As\u2019oka sent a ther\u00f3 to Banav\u00e1si to proclaim the Buddhist faith. Another inscription, at Kupatur, says that \u201cN\u00e1gakhan\u1e0daka (Shik\u00e1rpur taluq) was protected by the wise Chandra Gupta, an abode of the good usages of eminent Kshatriyas.\u201d In the Samudra Gupta inscription at Allahabad a list is given of kings in Southern India who submitted to him; among these, according to one reading of the passage,\u00b2 was Ott\u00faraka, he of Ott\u00far. Again, in the Mah\u00e1k\u00fa\u1e6da inscription near B\u00e1d\u00e1mi, in Bijapur,\u00b3 the Ch\u00e1lukya king K\u00edrttivarma is said to have subdued (besides the Mauryas, Kadambas and Gangas) among others, a king of Vatj\u00far. These are doubtless the same place, and may be identical with the Ott\u00far to the north of Sorab.\u2074 In the Kadamba inscription at T\u00e1lgunda, too, described below, it is implied that the king K\u00e1kushthavarma gave his daughter in marriage to a Gupta king.\n\n**Satavahanas.**\u2014The next guides we have to the history of those early times are the inscription discovered by me at Malavalli (Shik\u00e1rpur taluq), and one previously known at Banav\u00e1si, which show that H\u00e1ritiputra S\u00e1takarni, an \u00c1ndrabhritya or S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1hana king, was ruling in those parts in about the 2nd century A.D.\n\n**Kadambas.**\u2014The Kadambas followed the S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1hanas, and are specially identified with Banav\u00e1si, which was their original capital, and is mentioned in connection with As\u2019oka in the 3rd century B.C., and by Ptolemy in the 2nd century A.D. The fine inscription discovered by me at T\u00e1lgunda (Shik\u00e1rpur taluq) has given us for the first time what appears to be an authentic account of their origin and rise to power, free from the numerous legends that have become mixed up\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 See translation in Talboys Wheeler\u2019s Hist.

The information derived from this source, and all others available, has been summarized in the chapter on History in Vol. I.\n\n**Gangas.**\u2014While the Kadambas were exercising sovereignty in the west of the District, the Gangas were established in the east, and Mandali and Purali, on the river, close to Shimoga, one to the south and the other to the north, seem to have been places of importance under their rule. In the 4th century the Ganga king M\u00e1dhava II married the Kadamba king's sister; and in the 10th century the Banavase Twelve Thousand (the Shimoga District), with other provinces, was formally transferred to the Gangas by the R\u00e1shtrak\u00fatas.\n\n**Chalukyas.**\u2014The Ch\u00e1lukyas, claiming to be of the Lunar line and former rulers of Ay\u00f3dhy\u00e1, first crossed the Narmada or Nerbudda and appeared in the Dekkan in the person of Jayasimha, who, in the 4th century, defeated and destroyed the R\u00e1shtrak\u00fata or Ratta prince. He was subsequently killed in a contest with the Pallava king, but his immediate successors subdued the whole of the Kuntala country, and by the 5th century had established their capital at V\u00e1t\u00e1pi, now B\u00e1d\u00e1mi, in the Bijapur district. In the 6th century they profess to have subdued the Kadambas and Gangas. The former became their feudatories, but the latter remained independent, though they must have retired from much of the Shimoga District. In the 7th century the Ch\u00e1lukyas separated into two families, the Eastern Ch\u00e1lukyas fixing their capital at Vengi, in the God\u00e1vari District, and the Western Ch\u00e1lukyas continuing to rule from B\u00e1d\u00e1mi. The Shimoga District was under the latter, forming the Banavase Twelve Thousand province, with its seat of government at Belg\u00e1mi (Shik\u00e1rpur taluq). But in the 8th century the Western Ch\u00e1lukyas were overcome by the R\u00e1shtrak\u00fatas, and did not regain supremacy for two hundred years.\n\n**R\u00e1shtrak\u00fatas.**\u2014This line of kings exercised a great influence over the Mysore country, especially in the north-west. Their capital was M\u00e1nyakheta (Malkhed in the Nizam's dominions). They at first seized and imprisoned the Ganga king, and appointed their own viceroys to govern his territories. But eventually they reinstated him and entered into alliance with the Gangas. In the 10th century there were intermarriages between the families, and in return for Ganga help in defeating the Cholas, the Banavase Twelve Thousand, and other provinces were again added to the Ganga kingdom by the R\u00e1shtrak\u00fatas.\n\n**Humcha.**\u2014At the time of the commotions in the 7th century we find a Jain principality established at Pomburchcha or Hombucha (Humcha, in Nagar taluq), founded by Jinadatta, of the Solar race,\nand prince of the northern Mathura (on the Jumna, near Agra). This event is assigned to the year 500 of the fifth Kali yuga of the Jains, or 159 B.C. It seems more probable that the dynasty arose after the power of the Kadambas had been circumscribed by their superiors, the Ch\u00e1lukyas. Under the latter, Humcha kings, bearing successively the title of S\u2019\u00e1ntana or S\u2019\u00e1ntara Deva, can be traced by inscriptions in the 10th and 11th centuries. Jinadatta brought under his sway all the country as far as Kalasa (Kadur District); then, descending the Ghats to Sisila or Sisukali, finally established his capital at Karkala (S. Kanara), appointing lieutenants at Barkur, Bang\u00e1di, M\u00fadu Bidare and Mulki. The territories thus acquired yielded a revenue of 9 lakhs of pagodas above and 9 lakhs below the Ghats. His successors, under the general title of Bhairasu Wodeyar, continued in power down to the 16th century, being subordinate in turn to the Ch\u00e1lukyas, the Hoysalas, and the Vijayanagar kings, until their territories were subdued by the Keladi chiefs. The last of them, it is said, having no son, divided his territories among his seven daughters.\n\nChalukyas.\u2014In 973 Taila retrieved the fortunes of his dynasty by destroying the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1k\u00fa\u1e6das, and restored the Ch\u00e1lukya empire, which became more powerful than under the early kings. The capital was now established at Kaly\u00e1na (in the Nizam\u2019s Dominions). The Kaly\u00e1na dynasty was at the zenith of its glory in the 11th century, under Vikram\u00e1ditya, who established the Ch\u00e1lukya Vikrama era, used in subsequent inscriptions for nearly 200 years. During this period the Banavase Twelve Thousand was one of the most important provinces of their empire. In 1155 the Ch\u00e1lukya king was dethroned by his general, Bijjala Deva, of the Kalachurya line, a family which had been originally subdued at the same time as the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1k\u00fa\u1e6das or Rattas. The Ch\u00e1lukya power thus came to an end. The king retired to Banav\u00e1si, and a feeble remnant of the state appears afterwards to have survived, first at Annigere, in Dharwar, and then in the Konkan, for about a century later. The name then disappears from history.\n\nKalachuryas.\u2014The Kalachuryas possessed themselves of most of the Ch\u00e1lukya dominions, including the Banavase Twelve Thousand, and ruled at Kaly\u00e1na for three generations, down to 1182. During the reign of Bijjala Deva, before mentioned, it was that the Lingayit religion which prevails throughout the Kannada and Telugu countries arose, its founder, Basava, being his prime minister, whose sister, famed for her beauty, the king had married. No mention occurs after the 12th century of the Kalachuryas.\n\nHoysalas.\u2014This brings us to the time when the Hoysalas of Dorasamudra (Halebid, Hassan District) had subdued the whole of\nMysore. Among the provinces ruled by Vishnuvardddhana of that line are included Banavasi. Vira Ballala, advancing north of the Tungabhadra, came into collision with the Yadavas of Devagiri (Daulatabad). Between the forces of these two powers several engagements took place. At one time, in the 12th century, the Hoysalas advanced as far as the Krishna. A century later the Yadavas appear by inscriptions to have secured the allegiance of the Kadambas and gained possession of the northern parts of the District.\n\nThe Muhammadans now appear on the scene. Devagiri was reduced in 1294 by Ala ud Din, and twenty years later the Yadava line was extinguished. Dorasamudra was sacked in 1310 by Kafur, and totally destroyed in 1326, which terminated the Hoysala power.\n\nVijayanagar.\u2014The Vijayanagar empire next arose, the foundation of that city on the Tungabhadra being assigned to the year 1336. Within its dominions were ultimately comprised all the countries south of the Krishna. Towards the close of its ascendancy were established the houses of the Keladi, Ikkeri or Bednur chiefs in the west, and the Basvapatna or Tarikere chiefs in the east.\n\nKeladi.\u2014The origin of the former, who were Lingayits, is as follows. Bhadraiya, a Malava Gauda of Keladi, is said to have discovered a hidden treasure, which, after sacrificing two of his slaves, he took possession of, and therewith built a fort. He next visited the court of Vijayanagar and obtained from Sadasiya Raya, then ruling, a grant of the government of Barkur, Mangalur, and Chandragutti, with the title of Sadasiya Nayak. His successor transferred the capital to Ikkeri. Venkatappa Nayak threw off dependence on the fallen Vijayanagar sovereign, and in 1639, during the reign of Virabhadra Nayak, the capital was again removed and established at Bednur. Sivappa Nayak was a most able administrator, and conquered as far as Shimoga eastwards, with all Kanara westwards. He succeeded to the government in 1645, and is the most celebrated of the line, not only for the extent of his conquests, but for his politic regulations, elsewhere described. We have seen in the history of the Mysore, Hassan and Kadur Districts how he overran the province of Balam; also how he granted protection to Sri Ranga Raya, the fugitive king of Vijayanagar, establishing him in a government at Bejur and Sakkarepatna, and even adventuring to besiege Seringapatam in his behalf. Sivappa Nayak died in 1660, and the government continued in the same family till 1763, when Bednur was captured by Haidar Ali, and the District thus\n\n1 The Jain account is that the last of the Humcha kings became a Sivabhakta, taking the name of Gante Wodeyar; that he was the progenitor of the Keladi family, and that owing to his change of faith the provincial governors threw off their allegiance.\nannexed to Mysore. The R\u00e1ni Viramm\u00e1ji, with her adopted son, fled to Ball\u00e1lr\u00e1yandurga (Kadur District), a strong fortress at the head of the Kudakal pass; but being surrounded by Haidar's troops, she was taken prisoner and sent to Maddagiri (Tumk\u00far District).\n\nThe Kela\u1e0di, Ikk\u00e9ri or Bedn\u00far State was the most considerable of those that were absorbed into the present Mysore territories by the victories of Haidar Ali, and its conquest was always acknowledged by him to have established his fortune. Some details of its history are therefore here given, for a portion of which I am indebted to a manuscript favoured by Mr. F. M. Mascarenhas of Mangalore (a complete stranger to me), who has also written a History of Canara and other works relating to that interesting region. A notice of his document, which was late in reaching me, was printed in the former edition of this work as an Appendix to Vol. III, Coorg.\u00b9\n\nThe following is the list of the chiefs as given by him. It agrees generally with one taken by Mr. Stokes from a kadata or black book at Keladi, and appears to be more correct than one given by Buchanan:\n\n1.

Sad\u00e1s'iva N\u00e1yak received that name from Sad\u00e1s'iva R\u00e1ya of Vijayanagar, in reward for his services against the forces of Ahmednagar, and his success in putting down various rebellious chiefs in Tuluva or South Kanara, which he overran as far as Kasargod, in witness of which a stone pillar was erected by him there. The two\n\n\u00b9 \"I have consulted,\" he says, \"two Canarese manuscripts, one of which came to me from Bednore, and another from Kundapur in South Canara.\"\nSankanna Nayaks who followed were sons of different mothers. The elder after a time made over the government to his brother, and set out on a pilgrimage to all the holy places in India, from Ramesvara in the extreme south to Kedarnath, Nepal and Kashmir in the Himalayas. When at Delhi he is said to have defeated in the presence of the court a celebrated prize-fighter, named Ankush Khan, who had affixed a sword to the gate of the city as a challenge to all comers. During his travels the god Aghoresvara appeared to him at Paidana and Vira-bhadra at Avali, in consequence of which, on his return to his country, he set up the latter at Keladi and the former at Ikk\u00e9ri. According to Buchanan, he did not resume his power, but lived in retirement for the rest of his days. But it would appear that he did take up the government again, and was successful in various contests against the Muhammadans and in Kanara. It was during the reign of Sankanna II that the Vijayanagar empire was overthrown by a confederacy of Muhammadan powers. The Keladi chief seems to have embraced the opportunity to overrun the territories of Baira Devi.\n\nBut it was Venkatappa Nayak who assumed independence, and had to encounter the invasion of the Bijapur forces under Randulha Khan, which he succeeded in driving back. During his reign the dominions of his house were extended north and east to M\u00e1sur, Shimoga, Kadur, and Bhuvanagiri (Kavaledurga), while on the west and south they were carried to the sea at Honore by the conquest of the queen of Gersoppa\u2014the pepper queen of the Portuguese\u2014a feudatory of Bijapur, and down as far as to the borders of Malabar, his power being so firmly established that he was able to add 50 per cent. to the land assessment throughout a great part of Kanara. He came into collision with the Portuguese by espousing the cause of the queen of Olaya against the Bangar r\u00e1ja, who was an ally of theirs, and ousting him from his territory. The Portuguese, being at the time engaged in expeditions against Persia and Malacca, and desiring to gain the alliance of Venkatappa in order to secure the trade in pepper and keep it out of the hands of the English and Dutch, the viceroy at Goa sent him an embassy in 1623. An Italian nobleman, Pietro della Valle, who had been wandering for some years through Turkey, Egypt, Arabia and Persia, accompanied the ambassador to Ikk\u00e9ri, and has left an account of his journey. He mentions the fine wide level road from S\u00e1gar to Ikk\u00e9ri, and the splendid avenue of trees on either side. These are the magnificent dhupa trees, of which many may still be seen. He also came upon a woman performing sati, whom he endeavoured, without success, to save from the flames. M\u00e1stikal of the later Vijayanagar period are numerous in Sorab and neighbouring parts, and\nthe rite must have been very prevalent. He afterwards travelled alone through the country, \"marching at his pleasure; and as the roads throughout the dominions of Venkatappa were very secure he descended the ghats slowly.\"\n\nV\u012brabhadra N\u0101yak, by an embassy to the Bijapur sultan, stopped a formidable invasion by Randulha Khan, assisted by the r\u00e1jas of Sunda and Bilgi, and the chiefs of Tarikere and Banavar. He then removed the capital to Bednur. Sivappa N\u0101yak, his general, subsequently subdued Tulaya, and Bairasa Wodeyar of Karkala, invading Malay\u0101la and entering Coorg.\n\nSivappa N\u0101yak was one of the most distinguished of the line. He greatly enlarged Bednur, assisting merchants and artisans from all parts to settle there. His expeditions in Mysore extended over Balam to Vastara, Sakkarepatna and Hassan. He introduced the land assessment called shist. Father Leonardo Paes, who travelled in Kanara at the time, says that he had collected enormous treasure after his thorough conquest of Canara; that his possessions extended from the Tudry river to Kasargod or Niles'var; and that he had a standing army of from forty to fifty thousand men. There were more than 30,000 Christians among his subjects, originally natives of Goa and Salsette. Sri Ranga R\u0101ya, the fugitive king of the Vijayanagar dynasty, fled to him for refuge in 1646, and Sivappa N\u0101yak not only gave him the government of Belur and Sakkarepatna, but attacked Seringapatam on his behalf, gaining the sobriquet Pin\u1e0da of Ikk\u00e9ri, Minda of Mysore. Father Vincent, a Barefoot Carmelite friar, mentions in his travels the wealthy Musalman merchant Shah Bandari Isak, who was a favourite of the chief, and traded on the western coast and at Bednur.\n\nThere were frequent contests in subsequent reigns between the Mysoreans and the forces of Bednur; also several invasions by the Bijapur armies. In the time of Bhadrappa N\u0101yak the latter are said to have taken Bednur and besieged Bhuvanagiri, whither the chief, with his family, had retired; but a peace was eventually concluded. In 1664 Sivaji made a sudden descent on the coast of Canara, sacked Barcelore or Kundapur, and sailed back to Gokarna, plundering all the adjacent tracts, and levying heavy contributions from the rich mercantile towns, of which the English factory at Carwar paid \u00a3112 sterling.\n\nSomasekhara was murdered by his nobles, as stated by Dr. John Fryer of the English Navy, who was then at Carwar, and there were many intrigues regarding the succession, as he had no son. But, according to information given to Buchanan, he went mad, and during the paroxysms of his disease committed great enormities,\nripping up pregnant women with his own hands, and for the gratification of his lust seizing every beautiful girl that he met. At length he was assassinated by a Brahman named Somaya, who, though he had rid them of a monster, was nevertheless put to death by the Siva-bhaktas, as they considered that he had brought to an end the principal dynasty that professed their creed. His widow, Channam\u00e1ji, carried on the government, \"by and with the authority,\" Dr. John Fryer says, \"of one Timmanna N\u00e1yak, who from a toddy-man has, by his cunning polity more than true prowess and valour, raised himself to be General and Protector.\" The Rani adopted a son, and Timmanna N\u00e1yak, who kept them both under restraint, was killed in battle, on which things began to return to the regular current. The Rani's forces took Basavapatna and other places to the east. Harikere she fortified and named it Channagiri, after herself. She also gave shelter to R\u00e1ma R\u00e1ja, the son of Siv\u00e1ji, when he was in hiding from the Mughals, until he could escape to his own country.\n\nBasappa N\u00e1yak, her adopted son, next came to the throne. He seems to have been devoted to works of charity. All ascetics, of whatever faith, who came to his dominions in the winter, were provided, it is said, with an umbrella and a blanket. All wayfarers were fed at the dasoharas. At nightfall men were sent into the streets with cooked rice for wanderers, and milk for young children. As an atonement for the murder of Somasekhara, he imposed an extra assessment of $\\frac{1}{10}$th of an anna, or $\\frac{1}{100}$th of the standard rent, to provide funds for erecting chhatras and feeding pilgrims.\n\nSomasekhara II is said to have attacked Sira, and taken Ajjampur, Sante Bennur, and other places from the Mughals. Basappa N\u00e1yak was called Buddhi, or the Wise. Jacobus Canter Visscher, writing of this period, says:\u2014\"The Bednore Prince is much more magnificent and powerful than those of Malabar. His kingdom produces many peculiar commodities, such as sandalwood, which is found there in great abundance, as well as rice.\" He calls Bednore the granary of all southern India. He also writes:\u2014\"The city (Bednur) where the R\u00e1ja holds his court lies some leagues inland, and is connected with the seaport by a fine road, planted with trees, which the inhabitants are obliged to keep in excellent order. This road is so secure that any stranger might go and sleep there with bags full of money, and nobody would molest or rob him, for if such a thing occurred the people in the neighbourhood would not only be severely punished, but would be forced to make good the money.\" It was during this reign, in 1748, that the intrigues of Dupleix released Chanda Sahib from the Mahrattas at Sattara, as a candidate for the Nav\u00e1bship of the Carnatic, in oppo-\nsition to Muhammad Ali, the English candidate. Bednur was then at war with Chitaldroog, and both sought the countenance of Chanda Sahib, who was marching leisurely to the south, awaiting information from his partisans. He was induced to side with Chitaldroog, but in the decisive battle of Mayakonda, on the 24th of March 1748, the Chitaldroog forces suffered complete defeat, and their chief, Madikeri Nayak, was slain. The son of Chanda Sahib had been killed by his side, and he himself fell into the hands of the enemy, who were taking him in triumph to Bednur. But informing his Musalman guards of his prospects, they marched off with him to the French instead, and he eventually took Arcot in 1750. On the other hand, in 1752 the French were forced to surrender at Trichinopoly to Major Lawrence. Chanda Sahib escaped to the Tanjore general under a promise of being conveyed to some French settlement, but was basely stabbed by him, and his head sent to his rival, Muhaminad Ali. The latter gave it to Nanja Raj, the Mysore commander, who despatched it to Seringapatam, where it was exposed for three days over one of the gates. To return to Bednur. In 1751 a treaty was concluded between the Raja and the chief of the English factory at Tellicherry.\n\nAn adopted son succeeded Basappa, but on remonstrating with his adoptive mother on her amours, which had become a public scandal, he was put out of the way by a Jetti dislocating his neck in the bath, and Virammaji occupied the throne in her own name, adopting a son as her successor. But her notorious character, and an imposition of 50 per cent. additional tax in order to buy off the Maharratas, who threatened the country, had alienated the people, and Haidar's invasion now followed. The chief of Chitaldroog, whom he had just subdued, introduced to him a pretender, Channa Basappa, professing to be the prince who was thought to have been murdered. Haidar saw the use to be made of him, and invaded Bednur in January 1763, ostensibly to restore him to the throne, though even the troops nicknamed him the Ghaib, or resurrection raja. At Kumsi Haidar found the former prime minister of Bednur in prison, and obtained from him such information, that refusing all the offers of money made by the Rani to buy him off, which were raised in amount the nearer he approached, he pressed on to Bednur. Diverting the attention of the garrison by a feigned attack at the barriers, he entered with a column by a secret path revealed to him by the prime minister, and captured the city in March 1763. The Rani, with her paramour and adopted son, fled to Ballalrayandurga, leaving orders to set fire to the palace. The inhabitants en masse took shelter in the surrounding woods, and the triumphant Haidar, extinguishing the flames and sealing up the houses,\nacquired a booty estimated at twelve millions sterling. The Rani, her lover, and her adopted son were all seized by Haidar and transported to the fortress of Maddagiri (Tumkur District), together with even the pretender whose cause he had ostensibly espoused. They were liberated when the Mahrattas took Maddagiri. Viramm\u00e1ji died on the way to Poona, and Somasekhara ended his days there unmarried.\n\nBasvapatna.\u2014The founder of the Basvapatna family appears to have been Dh\u00fama R\u00e1ja, who coming from, it is said, Vijayanagar, formed an alliance with a Bedar family, and established himself at the Dhumi hill, near Holalkere. His son, Kongana N\u00e1yak, built the fort of Basvapatna, and subdued a territory extending from Harih\u00e1r and Kumsi to Tarikere and B\u00e1gur. Hanumappa N\u00e1yak, who succeeded, appears to have been confirmed in these possessions by the Vijayanagar sovereign, and to have founded Sante Bennur. The family were driven from their northern possessions by the Bijapur army under Ran-dulha Khan in 1636, and then established themselves at Tarikere (Kadur District).\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century the north-east of the District was the scene of much contest between the Chitaldroog and Bednur troops, culminating in 1748 in the decisive battle of Mayakonda, in which, as already described, Madakeri N\u00e1yak, the palegar of Chitaldroog, was slain, and Chanda Sahib, the claimant to the Nabobship of Arcot, who had espoused his cause, was captured by the Bednur army. The Nawab of S\u00e1vanur then held it for a short time, until the whole, with Bednur, was included in Mysore by the conquests of Haidar Ali. His successes in Sunda and S\u00e1vanur led to an invasion by the Mahrattas in 1765, repeated on several occasions afterwards. From the devastation of Shimoga and the open country in 1791 by the army under Parasuram Bhao a famine ensued.\n\nIn January 1783, when Tipu Sultan succeeded his father, Mysore being still at war with the English, a force from Bombay, under General Mathews, landed at Kundapur, and carrying by assault the formidable defences of the Hosangadi pass\u2014which bristled with a continuous series of batteries and breastworks, headed at the top by the strong fort of Haidarghar, the whole held by about 17,000 men\u2014occupied Bednur or Haidarnagar on the 27th, the governor having fled. But an expedition which began so well was doomed to end in disaster. The English general was deluded into a false security, and instead of making adequate preparations for defence, scattered his force in various detachments over the country. On hearing of this the Bombay Government superseded him by another officer, but on his way the latter was captured by pirates and killed. Tipu appeared in\nApril with a large army, recovered Kavaledurga and Haidarghar on one side, and Anantapur on the other, and invested Bednur. The garrison held out till the 30th, when they were forced by starvation to capitulate, which they did on condition of being sent to the coast. But, in violation of the terms, they were marched off in irons, some to Chitaldroog, but the majority to Seringapatam, where numbers were put to death with the most inhuman cruelties.\n\nAfter the death of Tipu Sultan and the restoration of the Hindu government in 1799, parts of the District were ravaged by Dhundia Wahag, a prisoner at Seringapatam who had obtained release at the time of the capture; but he was speedily put down by Colonel Wellesley, being killed in a cavalry charge led by that illustrious warrior in person. The tranquillity thus restored continued until 1830. But during the greater part of this time the principal authority had been left too much in the hands of one family. Every office was gradually filled with Deshasta Brahmins, who made themselves obnoxious to the Lingayits. A system of secret plunder was connived at, of which they and their patrons reaped the benefit. At the same time the mode of farming the revenue laid the people under burdens from which there was no redress. Matters grew to such a pitch that in 1830 the gaudas and ryots assembled in kutas or indignation meetings at Basvapatna and Honnali. The discontent was fomented by a pretender to the Bednur throne, named Budi Basavappa, who formed insurgent bands; and these again were shortly joined by Rangappa Nayak, the head of the Tarikere family, and by numbers of Thugs, professional stranglers. The Raja\u2019s troops failed to put down the now open revolt, and he was obliged to seek the aid of a British force. The suppression of the insurrection in 1831 was followed by an inquiry into the causes which had led to it, and as the result of that investigation the government was placed under British Commissioners. The District has since that time not only enjoyed the blessing of peace, but has advanced in a course of prosperity which has effectually obliterated all traces of the disorders by which it was previously afflicted.\n\nIn 1862 the Shimoga District, with Kadur and Chitaldroog, were formed into the Nagar Division. In 1879 the Division was abolished. In 1882 Davangere taluq was transferred to this District, but in 1886 reverted to Chitaldroog.\n**POPULATION**\n\n*Number.*\u2014The entire population of the District, according to the census of 1891, was 527,981, of which number 275,884 were males and 259,296 females.\n\n*Density.*\u2014This gives 131\u00b769 persons to the square mile. The Honn\u00e1li taluq was the most thickly peopled at the time of the census, containing 193\u00b709 persons to the square mile. In Channagiri there were 159\u00b760, in Sorab 151\u00b794, and in Shik\u00e1rpur 150\u00b747. The most sparsely populated taluqs were Nagar, with 80\u00b798, and S\u00e1g\u00e1r, with 88\u00b758.\n\n*By Religion.*\u2014The following table represents the numbers according to religion:\n\n| Religion     | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|--------------|----------|----------|-------|\n|              | Males    | Females  | Males | Females | Total | Percentage |\n| Hindus       | 165,397  | 144,492  | 91,826 | 90,996   | 492,711 | 93\u00b732      |\n| Muhammadans  | 9,743    | 8,593    | 6,027  | 5,834    | 30,197  | 5\u00b771       |\n| Jains        | 1,268    | 905      | 580    | 000      | 3,422   | 0\u00b764       |\n| Christians   | 770      | 303      | 264    | 254      | 1,051   | 0\u00b731       |\n| **Total**    | **177,178** | **154,413** | **98,706** | **97,684** | **527,981** | **\u2014** |\n\n*Increase.*\u2014The following figures compare the estimates of population in 1838, as given in Mr. Stokes's Report, and in 1853-4 according to the kh\u00e1neshum\u00e1ri accounts, with the numbers ascertained in the census periods of 1871, 1881, and 1891:\n\n| Taluq       | 1838    | 1853-4 | 1871   | 1881   | 1891   |\n|-------------|---------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Channagiri  | 38,363  | 43,948 | 69,593 | 65,267 | 74,218 |\n| Honn\u00e1li     | 39,525  | 49,925 | 59,067 | 55,970 | 65,527 |\n| Nagar       | 33,621  | 55,587 | 42,605 | 43,605 | 42,11  |\n| S\u00e1g\u00e1r       | 42,575  | 60,200 | 60,038 | 59,210 | 58,990 |\n| Shik\u00e1rpur   | 40,470  | 58,484 | 63,310 | 63,510 | 64,404 |\n| Shimoga     | 51,389  | 64,878 | 93,457 | 95,5   | 94,716 |\n| Sorab       | 42,529  | 60,072 | 67,073 | 66,5   | 70,047 |\n| Tirthahalli | 15,650  | 34,079 | 51,715 | 50,501 | 59,229 |\n| **Total**   | **304,128** | **427,170** | **506,858** | **506,531** | **527,981** |\nIn the first period of 15 years the total increased apparently at the rate of 40\u00b74 per cent., and in the second period of 18 years at the rate of 16\u00b78 per cent. The great advance in the former period bears ample testimony to the beneficial effect of the restoration of order under British rule, following upon the disturbances which had devastated the country for some years previously. But as the census of 1871 shows that previous estimates were 25 per cent. too low, it seems that the population remained almost stationary, or even slightly declined, in the 38 years to 1891. The famine of 1877\u20138 apparently had no effect in diminishing the population in this District. The increase in the 20 years from 1871 to 1891 has been only 4\u00b716 per cent., but it is a hopeful sign that the whole of this has occurred in the last decade.\n\nClasses.\u2014Arranged according to occupation and nationality, the population may be classified as follows:\n\n| Class                        | No.   | Per cent. |\n|------------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| A.

These account for 464,256, or 87\u00b793 per cent. of the population:\n\n- Wokkaliga ... 135,069\n- Beda ... 25,678\n- Agasa ... 13,103\n- Ling\u00e1yit\u00b9 ... 72,800\n- Kuruba ... 23,683\n- Panch\u00e1la ... 11,927\n- Holeya ... 38,000\n- M\u00e1diya ... 23,017\n- Upp\u00e1ra ... 10,956\n- Musalm\u00e1n ... 30,015\n- Wodda ... 14,918\n- Idiga ... 10,944\n- Br\u00e1hmana ... 29,374\n- Lamb\u00e1ni ... 14,127\n- Mahrata ... 10,645\n\nThe most numerous classes of Wokkaliga are the S\u00e1da Ling\u00e1yit (39,669), Halepaika (12,576), Gangadik\u00e1ra (9,081), Nonaba (8,552), and Kunchatiga (8,082). Of Musalm\u00e1ns 18,834 are Shekhs. The principal Brahman sects are Sm\u00e1rta (7,051), Desastha (3,804), Badagan\u00e1d (3,522), Hav\u00edka (3,235), Dr\u00e1vida (2,996), and Chitp\u00e1van (2,081). Of Kuruba 9,719 are H\u00e1lu Kuruba. Of Wodda there are 8,171 Mannu Wodda. Among Panch\u00e1la the Akkas\u00e1le number 6,846.\n\nStock.\u2014The agricultural stock of the District in 1892 consisted of 18,795 carts and 85,111 ploughs. The manufacturing stock consisted of 1,156 looms for cloth, 387 for kambl\u00ed, 4 for girdles, 26 for goni, and 1 for carpets; also of 98 oil-mills\u2014namely, 3 of stone and 95 of wood.\n\nTanks.\u2014The District contains 8,611 tanks.\n\n\u00b9 There are also 48,221 included among Wokkaliga.\nDwellings.\u2014The total number of houses in 1892 was 103,159. Next to Shimoga, the taluqs of Honnalli and Sorab contain the largest number of first-class houses.\n\nTowns and Villages.\u2014The District contains 14 municipal towns, with a population of 44,782, composed of 35,232 Hindus, 147 Jains, 8,612 Muhammadans, and 791 Christians. The following are the towns, with population:\n\n| Town          | Population |\n|---------------|------------|\n| Shimoga       | 11,340     |\n| Shikarpur     | 5,011      |\n| Channagiri    | 3,787      |\n| Honnalli      | 3,467      |\n| Nyamti        | 3,102      |\n| Hole Honnur   | 2,947      |\n| Sagar         | 2,857      |\n| Tirthahalli   | 2,359      |\n| Venkipur      | 2,270      |\n| Siralkoppa    | 2,125      |\n| Sorab         | 1,661      |\n| Kumsi         | 1,656      |\n| Nagar         | 1,576      |\n| Kolurkaite    | 624        |\n\nThe total number of asali or primary villages in 1891 was 2,000, to which were attached 1,551 dakhali or secondary villages or hamlets. Of the former 1,807 were populated and 193 depopulated. Government villages numbered 1,931, sarvamanya 9, jodi 58, and kayamgutta 2.\n\nGreat Festivals.\u2014The principal concourse of people occurs at the undermentioned festivals:\n\nAt Togarsi, Shikarpur taluq, during the Mallakirjuna jatre, held for 5 days in March, 10,000 people assemble.\n\nOn the bund of the Sitlekere, Channagiri taluq, 10,000 assemble for the Siddesvara rathotsava, held for 3 days in February.\n\nAt Shikarpur, Shikarpur taluq, 5,000 people come together for the Huchcha Riya rathotsava, which lasts for 3 days in April.\n\nAt Chikka-Hulikere, Channagiri taluq, on the occasion of Mahesvari jatre, lasting for 3 days in December, 6,000 people assemble.\n\nAt Chandragutti, in Sorab taluq, 5,000 people collect together during the Renukamma rathotsava, held for 8 days in Chaitra.\n\nAn equal number assemble at Tirthahalli, Tirthahalli taluq, for Ramesvara rathotsava, celebrated for 3 days in Margasira.\n\nAt Humcha, in Nagar taluq, the Padmavati Ammana rathotsava, lasting 7 days in March, attracts 4,000 people.\n\nA similar concourse takes place at Jenukal gudda, Nagar taluq, during the Jenukal Ammana jatre, held for 15 days in September; at Rampur, Honnalli taluq, during the Halswami jatre, lasting 4 days in Magha; at Sagar, during the Mari feast, held for 3 days; on the banks of the Tungabhadra, Shimoga taluq, during the Sangamesvara jatre, held for 3 days in April.\n\nAt Belgavi, Shikarpur taluq, 3,000 people come together for the car festival of Kedaresvara and Basavanna Devaru, lasting 3 days in March.\n\nAt Pillangiri, Shimoga taluq, during the Srinivasa Devaru rathotsava, held for 2 days in May, 3,000 people assemble.\nThere are 2,000 people at each of the following:\u2014At M\u00e1rikoppa, Honn\u00e1li taluq, for Haladamarma rath\u00f3tsava, 5 days in Asvija; at Nelli, same taluq, for Hariamma festival in February; at Keladi, S\u00e1g\u00e1r taluq, for R\u00e1mesvara rath\u00f3tsava, 3 days in Ph\u00e1lguna; at the R\u00e1machandra matha, Nagar taluq, for 10 days in March; at Sampeka\u1e6d\u1e6de, same taluq, for S'ambhulinga rath\u00f3tsava, 3 days in March.\n\nFairs.\u2014The following are the largest weekly fairs held in the District:\n\n| Place       | Taluq     | Day         | No. of Visitors |\n|-------------|-----------|-------------|----------------|\n| Shimoga     | Shimoga   | Tuesday     | 1,500          |\n| Benkipur    | do        | Monday      | 1,000          |\n| Hole Honnur | do        | Saturday    | 1,000          |\n| Anaveri     | do        | Thursday    | 1,000          |\n| Ayanur      | do        | Sunday      | 1,000          |\n| Ny\u00e1mti      | Honn\u00e1li   | Friday      | 1,000          |\n| Sir\u00e1lkoppa  | Shik\u00e1rpur | Sunday      | 3,000          |\n| Shik\u00e1rpur   | do        | Saturday    | 1,500          |\n| S\u00e1g\u00e1r       | S\u00e1g\u00e1r     | Thursday    | 2,000          |\n\nVital Statistics.\u2014Births.\u2014The number of births registered in the District in 1893-4 was 9,963, of which 5,135 were of males and 4,828 of females. This gives a birth-rate of 18\u00b787 per mille of the population.\n\nDeaths.\u2014The number of deaths registered in the same period was 11,279, being 5,942 of males and 5,337 of females. The death-rate was thus 21\u00b736 per mille of the population.\n\nAs the death-rate exceeded the birth-rate it is possible that the statistics for the latter are defective. The Local Fund report gives for rural parts only, 9,626 births and 9,675 deaths in 1894-5, with 10,072 births and but 7,756 deaths in 1895-6.\n\nOf the 11,279 deaths in 1893-4 there were 7,123 due to fevers, 1,139 caused by bowel complaints, 217 by small-pox, and 2 by cholera, while 141 were due to injuries\u2014namely, 20 to suicide, 105 to wounds from accidents, 16 to snake-bite or wild animals.\n\nMedical Relief.\u2014Besides the hospital at Shimoga, there are dispensaries at all the taluq and sub-taluq head-quarters, and at Benkipur.

In 1838 it was included in Nagar taluq, but afterwards, till 1875, was again the headquarters of a taluq bearing its own name. It is now the head-quarters of the Anantapur hobli. Population, 426.\n\nThe name of the town, it is stated, should be Anandapura, bestowed upon it in the time of Somasekhara N\u00e1yak, of the Keladi family, on account of the \u00e1nanda, or pleasure, he enjoyed in the company of a mistress named Champaka S\u00e1risi who lived here. But there are several inscriptions of the Ch\u00e1lukyas on the spot, dated in the 10th century, which show that it was a place of importance long before the rise of the Keladi house. From one of these it appears that the town was originally named after And\u00e1sura, who, in the account of Humcha, it will be seen opposed himself to Jinadatta in the 8th century, and was defeated. It was several times the subject of attack during the commotions of Haidar and Tipu\u2019s time, and during the insurrection of 1830.\n\nBesides the high road from Shimoga to S\u00e1gar, there are cross-roads hence to Shik\u00e1rpur northwards, and to Kollurkatte and Tirthahalli southwards.\n\nAraga.\u2014A village in Tirthahalli taluq, a few miles north of the kasba. Population, 454.\n\nIn old inscriptions it is called the capital of the Male-r\u00e1jya, or hill kingdom, and was in the S\u00e1ntalige Thousand. The S\u2019\u00e1ntara kings of Hombucha owned it under the Ch\u00e1lukyas. In the 14th century, and later on under Vijayanagar, it comprised 3 cities and 18 kampanas, and gave its name to the kingdom of A\u2019raga, which was governed by a prince of the royal family. The Keladi chiefs next held it, until they were subverted by the conquests of Haidar Ali.\n\nBandalikke or Bandanikke.\u2014A ruined and deserted village in the\nnorth of Shik\u00e1rpur taluq. It was in the earliest times the capital of the N\u00e1garakhanda Seventy, which an inscription informs us was ruled by the \u201cwise Chandra Gupta.\u201d It contains many ruined temples of large dimensions and wonderful sculpture. There are more than thirty important inscriptions, ranging from Saka 834 to 1369, and containing records of the R\u00e1shtr\u00e1k\u00fa\u1e6das, Ch\u00e1lukyas, Kalachuryas, Hoysalas, Y\u00e1davas and Vijayanagar kings. The place was probably destroyed by the Muhammadans after the fall of Vijayanagar.\n\n**Basvapatna.**\u2014A ruinous town situated in 14\u00b0 12' N. lat., 75\u00b0 52' E. long., in the north-west of the Channagiri taluq, 16 miles north-north-west of the kasba. Population, 1,218.\n\nBasvapatna, properly Basavapattana, is situated in a narrow valley enclosed with hills, and was the original possession of the Basvapatna chiefs, afterwards known as the Tarikere P\u00e1leg\u00e1rs. The founder of the family was Dh\u00fama R\u00e1ja, said to have come from Vijayanagar. When hunting in the forest where Basvapatna now stands he came upon the abode of the Beda who grazed his cattle there, and who had a beautiful daughter. Becoming enamoured of her he proposed to marry her, but her father was unwilling to give her to a man of a different caste. Dh\u00fama R\u00e1ja then obtained his consent by a promise that he would settle there, and that her sons should succeed him in the government. He established himself at the Dh\u00fami hill, and had two sons, Kongana N\u00e1yak and R\u00e1mappa N\u00e1yak, of whom the former succeeded his father, and built the fort of Basvapatna. During his rule he also subdued a territory extending from Anantapur to M\u00e1ya-kondu and from Harih\u00e1r to Tarikere. He was followed at Basvapatna by V\u00edra Hanumappa N\u00e1yak, he by Immadi Hanumappa N\u00e1yak, and he by Huchchu (mad) Hanumappa N\u00e1yak. In the time of Kongana N\u00e1yak, the next ruler, the place was taken by the Bijapur army under Randulha Khan. This was in 1636, and the chief then retired to Tarikere, which from that time became the residence of the family. Basvapatna was subsequently taken by the Bednur chief, who built a second or outer wall to the fort. It was next captured by the Mughals, and during the time that Dil\u00e1var Khan was governor of S\u00edra, seems to have enjoyed much prosperity for twenty years.\u00b9 It afterwards changed hands several times, being held by the Mahrattas for seven years, and by Haidar Ali, who destroyed the fortifications. The Mahrattas under Parasu Ram Bhao ruined the town in 1791. The fort was repaired after 1799, but the place has never recovered its former prosperity.\n\n\u00b9 Buchanan mentions a mosque near the fort which was celebrated as being the first abode of B\u00e1b\u00e1 Budan before he went south to the hill which bears his name in Kadur District.\nBednur.\u2014(See Nagar.)\n\nBelagavi or Balagami.\u2014A village remarkable for its antiquities, situated in $14^\\circ 24'$ N. lat., $75^\\circ 18'$ E. long., in Shikarpur taluq, 14 miles north-west of the kasba. Population, 1,470.\n\nBallig\u00e1ve, Ballig\u00e1mve, Balligr\u00e1me, Ballipura or Balipura, as its name is variously written in old inscriptions (the latter seldom) was, under the Ch\u00e1lukya and Kalachurya sovereigns, the capital of the Banavase n\u00e1d, or Banavase Twelve Thousand province. It was a place of such antiquity, even in the 12th century, as to be styled the mother of cities, the capital of ancient cities, the an\u00e1di r\u00e1jadh\u00e1ni, or immemorial capital, and is said to derive its name from the r\u00e1kshasa Bali. On account of its religious merit it was called the Dakshina K\u00e9d\u00e1ra, and it also had the name of Kam\u00e1tha. It contained five math\u00e1s and three pur\u00e1s, the former belonging respectively to the votaries of Vishnu, Siva, Brahma, Jina and Buddha. Its prosperity continued under Hoysala Vira Ball\u00e1la and the Y\u00e1davas. The place abounds with inscriptions, of which there are eighty-four, nearly all dated earlier than the close of the 13th century. There is little doubt that the city fell a prey to the Muhammadan armies which overturned the Y\u00e1dava and Hoysala powers soon after. The ruined temples of K\u00e9d\u00e1resvara, Pancha Linga, Kaitabhesvara, Somesvara and Tripurahantesvara are rich with carving which is not surpassed in taste and finish by any in Mysore, the handiwork, according to tradition, of the famous Jakan\u00e1ch\u00e1ri.\u00b9\n\nBelagutti.\u2014A village situated in $14^\\circ 12'$ N. lat., $75^\\circ 35'$ E. long., in the Honnali taluq, 5 miles north-west of Ny\u00e1mti. Population, 2,644.\n\nIt was the residence of a line of chiefs subject to the Ch\u00e1lukya and Y\u00e1dava kings. The inscriptions at the place are all of the 12th and 13th centuries. From these it is ascertained that Belegavatti was the original form of the name. The following chiefs are mentioned as ruling there:\u2014Malli Devarasa in 1196, Isvara Devarasa in 1216, Simhala Devarasa in 1232, Bira Devarasa in 1249.\n\nBenkipur.\u2014A town on the right bank of the Bhadra, at the point where the high road to Shimoga crosses the river, and where there will be a railway station. It is 12 miles south by east of Shimoga, and a municipality.\n\n\u00b9 The two fine dv\u00edrap\u00e1laka at the entrance to the Mysore Museum, were brought from the Pancha Linga temple.\nThere are the remains of a fine triple temple of Narasimha, of the early Vijayanagar period, never finished. The name of the town is properly Bankipur, for Vankipura, from Sanskrit vanki, a bend in a river, such as occurs here, making it a sacred spot.\n\nBhadra.\u2014One of the two main streams whose union forms the Tungabhadra. It rises in the Western Ghats at Gangamula in the Varaha Parvata, on the western frontier of the Kadur District, and flowing north-east along the western base of the Baba Budan mountains, enters this District in the south of the Shimoga taluq. Thence, running due north past Benkipur and Hole Honnur, it unites with its sister stream the Tunga at Kudali, about 8 miles north-east of Shimoga. It is bridged at Bale Honnur, and at Benkipur.\n\nBilesvara betta, or Agastya Parvata, a hill near Humcha in the Nagar taluq, from which several of the streams in the District spring: namely, the Haridravati, flowing north-west to the Sharavati; the Sharmanavati, which runs in the same direction into the former; the Kumadvati, running north and falling into the Tungabhadra; and the Kushavati, running south into the Tunga.\n\nChandragutti.\u2014A high-peaked hill in the west of the Sorab taluq, formerly fortified, with a village of the same name at its base on the east. Population 713.\n\nThe hill is said to have been originally of such a height that it obscured the moon, whence the name Chandragupti, but it was reduced to its present size by a rakshasa during his contest with Krishna, who hid here. The summit is 2,836 feet above the level of the sea. It was the early stronghold of the Kadamba kings of Banavasi, and the town below was the residence of Trinetra Kadamba. In modern times it was one of the first acquisitions of the Ikkeri chiefs, but was destroyed by the palegar of Bilgi in the time of Haidar\nAli.

The remaining parts of the taluq consist of an open country with very extensive grazing lands. Hence the cattle are superior to those in other parts of the District. In the north is a fertile tract containing much garden and sugar-cane cultivation. The cultivation of the black soil below, and the red soil around, the Sulekere, so long neglected that the wild date had invaded all the neighbourhood and made it extremely unhealthy, has been in recent years promoted by clearing the jungle and other measures conducive to that end. The hills to the west of the taluq are included in the auriferous belt running north from the Baba Budan mountains.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into the south of the taluq in 1870, and into the north in 1871. The area was thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 170,517; wet, 6,665; garden, 1,413) ... 178,595\n- Unculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... 73,495\n\nTotal acres ... 252,090\nThe unoccupied arable land was 79,813 acres.

In the twelfth century it formed part of the Ch\u00e1lukya dominions, and was included in the Nonambar\u00e1di Thirty-two Thousand province, over which the P\u00e1ndya Raja at Uchchangi ruled. Under Vijayanagar, in the sixteenth century, it was still under the Uchchangi district, and attached to Sante Benn\u00far. At the end of the seventeenth\ncentury the town was captured by the Bednur army, and named Channagiri after the reigning queen Channamaji, who erected the fort and granted the place as an estate to her sister.\n\n**Gersoppa**, Falls of.\u2014See Sharavati.\n\n**Govardhangiri**.\u2014A hill on the western frontier of the Sagar taluq, overlooking the old town of Gersoppa, said to have been fortified by Jinadatta, the founder of the Humcha state.\n\n\"It is in the remotest corner of Mysore, and has rarely been visited by Europeans. It stands on a promontory, the rock on all sides being precipitous, save an approach from the south-east, which is limited to a narrow neck of land on which are two causeways called s\u00e1ri, strongly fortified by outposts called ukh\u00e1s, and with tremendous ravines on either side. A difficult path then leads down to a third causeway, above which towers up the fort on one side, while on the other a rugged and devious path, commanded for some distance by the fortress, leads down to the plain country beneath. The fort is in fair repair, but is now deserted and overgrown with jungle, though the old pass is still used by traders, who carry down to Gersoppa on pack-bullocks the rice grown in the upper country, which finds a ready sale. The road is frightfully steep and rough, and it is a marvel how any laden animal can traverse it; yet 50,000 bullocks yearly descend and ascend it, carrying down grain and bringing up salt for consumption in the Malnad.\"\n\n**Hole Honnur**.\u2014A small town in Shimoga taluq, on the right bank of the Bhadra, 9 miles north-east of Shimoga, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 1,170 | 1,290   | 2,460 |\n| Muhammadans       | 235   | 252     | 487   |\n| **Total**         | 1,405 | 1,542   | 2,947 |\n\nIn Haidar Ali's time Hole Honnur was given in jagir to the officers of the Sowars, and a great many Mahrattas are settled there, most of whom have still one or more members of their family in the Sowar department.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 756    | 1,082  | 1,005  | 1,900  |\n| Expenditure     | 978    | 1,140  | 1,596  | 2,158  |\n\n1 Bowring, *East.

The taluq is crossed from south to north by the Tungabhadra, and bounded east and west by lines of low stony hills. The northern and eastern parts consist of dry crop country of unusual fertility, good black soil being common, and cotton and jowari the leading products. The extreme west, on the other hand, may be considered a purely rice country, with sugar-cane as usual intermixed, r\u00e1gi being the staple dry crop grain. The central part partakes of a mixed character between the two. Very rich black soil prevails around Ny\u00e1mti and Belagutti, and much money was made in this neighbourhood during the American War of 1864\u20135 by the growth of cotton. The Honn\u00e1li gold-field (see Vol. I) is at the foot of the hills in the south-west, of which the Kalva Rangan peak (3,388 feet) is the highest point within the District.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1874.

By the Muhammadan government it seems to have been called Bidiri. Honn\u00e1li means \"gold-bearing,\" but the Mackenzie MSS. state that the name is derived from Honnu and anala, \"gold of fire,\" the tradition being that fire is the father of gold. An inscription, however, gives it as Suvar\u1e47\u1e47\u00e1li, which is the same as Honn\u00e1li. The fort is occupied principally by Vaidika Brahmans, and the town by Ling\u00e1yit traders in grain. The place belonged to Vijayanagar, and after the overthrow of that power in the 16th century was seized by a chief named M\u00fagidora Mara N\u00e1yak. In spite of attacks from the Tarikere chiefs, he held it till ousted by the Bijapur conquests in the 17th century. On the fall of Bijapur, Honn\u00e1li was captured by the Bednur State, with which it was connected until taken by Haidar Ali, and annexed to Mysore. It was one of the centres of the insurrection of 1830. Honn\u00e1li is the residence of a Nav\u00e1b of Afghan descent. \"The founder of the family was a Jamaud Afghan named Abdul Nabi Kh\u00e1n, an officer of the court of Delhi, who received an estate from the emperor in Dharwar along with the Nav\u00e1b of S\u00e1vanur.

It was the capital of a principality founded by Jinadatta, who is said to have come from Mathura, in Upper India. His father, Sahak\u00e1ra, had a son Mardatta by a Kir\u00e1ta woman, at whose instigation an attempt was made to get Jinadatta out of the way in order to secure the succession for her son. Jinadatta was accordingly sent on a certain errand bearing the offering of a lime, which was to be the signal of their victim to the executioners appointed to murder him. But Mardatta, meeting him on the way, offered to relieve him of the message, and was consequently slain. Jinadatta, advised by his mother, fled, taking with him a small golden image of Padm\u00e1vati. He was pursued by a force of 1,200 men sent by his father, but on exhibiting the image of Padm\u00e1vati they were transported back to a distance of 150 miles. He continued his wanderings until he arrived at the spot where Humcha now stands. Being weary, he tied his horse to a kari lakki tree and fell asleep, when the goddess revealed to him that he was to be the founder of a kingdom in that place, and directed him to touch her image with his horse\u2019s bit, which, on his doing so, was instantly changed into gold. The story of the golden bit gained him the support of a local chief against the army of his pursuers, who now again appeared. They at last surrendered and entered his service, whereupon, being provided with funds by the goddess, who converted into gold all the iron brought into contact with her image, he commenced the building of the city. He also erected a temple to Padm\u00e1vati over the tree under which he had slept\u2014the same, it is said, which is now growing out of the side of the temple. All these things being accomplished, the golden image vanished, the king being directed to one of stone, in which the goddess would reside, and which was duly set up in the temple. These events happened, according to the account of the late Humcha swami, Devendra Tirtha Bhatt\u00e1raka, in the year 500 of the 5th Kali yuga (or 159 B.C.).\n\n\u00b9 Bowring, East. Ex., 107.\nAn inscription of the 11th century traces the descent of Jinadatta to R\u00e1ha, of the Ugra-vams'a, lord of the Northern Madhura, who was a successful leader in the Bharata war in Kuru-kshetra, on account of which he received a s'ankha, or conch shell, and the v\u00e1nara dhvaja, or monkey flag, from N\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u1e47a. After several kings had ruled in succession to him there came Sahak\u00e1ra, who turned a cannibal. To him and to his wife Sriy\u00e1-devi was born Jinadatta. Disgusted at his father's character, the latter fled to the south. On his way he slew an asura named Simharada, and thus obtained the simha l\u00e1nehhana, or lion signet. He also slew Andhak\u00e1sura and founded Andh\u00e1sura, a place which still bears the same name, immediately to the east of Anantapur. Then, coming to Kanakapura, the modern Humcha, he slew Kanak\u00e1sura, and drove away Kara and Karad\u00fashana, who were in Kundada-k\u00f3te, the hill near Agumbi. Pleased at his exploits, the goddess Padm\u00e1vati entered into the lakki tree (still shown growing out of her temple) at Kanakapura, gave it the name of Pombuchcha, and made it the capital of his kingdom. According to another statement, he was aided in establishing his kingdom by his guru, named Siddh\u00e1nta-k\u00edrtti. After several kings had ruled, there were S'ri'kesi and Jayakesi. The former had a son Ranakesi. He was followed by several kings, after whom came Hiranyakarba, who drove out the kings of Yadhi-v\u00e1sa and subdued the S\u00e1ntalige Thousand N\u00e1d (the present Tirthahalli taluq). He took the name of Vikrama S'\u00e1ntara, and was succeeded by the following S'\u00e1ntara kings:\u2014Ch\u00e1gi S'\u00e1ntara, Vira S'\u00e1ntara, Kannara S'\u00e1ntara, Ty\u00e1gi S'\u00e1ntara (who married a Kadamba princess), Nanni S'\u00e1ntara, R\u00e1ya S'\u00e1ntara, Chikka Vira S'\u00e1ntara, Ammana Deva, Tailapa Deva (who married a Ganga princess), Bira Deva S'\u00e1ntara (who married Ganga and Nolamba princesses), and his brother Barma Deva S'\u00e1ntara, ruling in 977. This genealogy is sufficient to warrant our placing Jinadatta in the 7th or 8th century. The grants continue to the 12th century, and give us the later names of Ammana, Taila, K\u00e1ma, Jagad\u00e9va and Bammarasa.\n\nJinadatta subdued the country as far as Kalasa (Kadur District), and fortified the hill of Govardhangiri on the western frontier of the Sagar taluq. He or his descendants afterwards removed the capital first to Sisila or Sisukali and then to Karkala, both in S. Kanara; establishing lieutenants in Barkur, Bang\u00e1di, Mudu Bidare and Mulki, and obtaining from the possessions a revenue of 9 lakhs above the\n\n---\n\n1 An inscription at Harihara contains a curious allusion to a king who, possessed by an evil spirit, became a cannibal, and in order to gratify his taste settled as a barber at K\u00e1lanjara, where he was slain by Krishna, one of the earliest of the Kalachurya princes.\nghats and 9 lakhs below. His successors at Karkala adopted the title of Bairasu Wodeyar, which was taken by all the line subsequently. The Jains say that Gante Wodeyar adopted the faith of the Sivabha\u1e6d\u1e6dar or Lingayits, on which the lieutenants refused to obey him and declared their independence, and that he was the progenitor of the Keladi chiefs who afterwards subdued the territory. The grants existing at Kalasa of the Bairasu Wodeyars of Karkala date from the end of the 12th to the 16th century, and are made under the Hoysala and Vijayanagar sovereigns.\n\nThe existing ruins of Humcha, situated at the foot of the Bilesvara hill, said to be the source of seven streams, indicate the site of a large town. The name Hombucha, golden bit, is considered to confirm the story of its origin, while that of Govardhangiri, given to the chief's first stronghold, points to his connection with the celebrated hill so called near Mathura.\n\nIkkeri.\u2014A village situated in 14\u00b0 8' N. lat., 75\u00b0 5' E. long., in the S\u0101gar taluq, 3 miles south of the kasba.

Ikk\u0113ri continued, however, to be the nominal capital, the Rajas were called by its name, and the coins were called Ikk\u0113ri pagodas and fanams, although, in fact, the mint was removed. Its walls were of great extent, forming three concentric enclosures. In the citadel was the palace, of mud and timber, adorned with carving and false gilding. The only vestige of its former greatness is the temple of Aghoresvara, a large and well-proportioned stone building. On the floor in front of the shrine are the effigies of three of the Keladi chiefs, doing obeisance, with the name inscribed above each. One of them, Huchcha (mad) Somasekhara, is represented as manacled and fettered. The distance between the central pillars was adopted as the standard measure for garden land. A rod of this length, equal to 18 feet 6 inches, was the space called d\u0101ya allowed for one tree, and the shist was fixed on 1,000 such d\u0101ya at various rates.\n\nKavale-durga.\u2014A hill in a wild and inaccessible region, in the west of the Tirthahalli taluq. It rises to 3,058 feet above the sea. The place is said to be the K\u0101myak\u0101-vana in which the Pandus lived for some time during their exile. They are related to have erected the ancient fortifications, of great size and strength, on the hill. Bh\u012bma threw the Bhimanka\u1e6d\u1e6de across the Tungabhadra, so as to turn the course of the river towards their abode. But the rishis performing penance lower down the stream, finding the water cut off, complained to Dharma Raya, who requested Bh\u012bma to release the stream, which he\ndid by making the three existing openings in the dam. The hill was in later times called Bhuvana-giri, and was a stronghold of the Bednur chiefs. A large slab of stone in the palace, 8 feet by 7 feet, called the R\u00e1ni\u2019s Cot, and well carved, has an inscription on it bearing date in the year Bh\u00e1va, corresponding to 1694.\\(^1\\) The present name Kavaledurga, guarding hill-fort, was given to the hill on its capture by Haidar Ali.\n\nThe old town, formerly head-quarters of what was, till 1882, called the Kavaledurga taluq, is to the west of the droog.\n\n**Keladi.**\u2014A village situated in \\(14^\\circ\\ 13'\\) N. lat., \\(75^\\circ\\ 5'\\) E. long., in S\u00e1gar taluq, 4 miles north of the kasba. Population, 1,388.\n\nIt is interesting as the place whence the Ikk\u00e9ri chiefs derived their origin, which is thus related. Two brothers named Chavuda Gau\u1e0da and Bhadra Gau\u1e0da, living in the village of Hale-bayal, in the Keladi taluq of the Chandragutti pargana, had two servants or slaves, named Y\u00e1dava and Mur\u00e1ri, who cultivated their masters\u2019 fields. A cow they had was discovered to shed her milk over a certain ant-hill, which, on digging into, Chavuda Gau\u1e0da found contained a linga, over which, therefore, he built a small temple. A little time after, the servants, when ploughing, turned up an old sword, which they put into the thatch of the house, intending to make a scythe of it. But they discovered that if a crow perched on the shed the sword leaped out in the form of a serpent and killed it. On this Chavuda Gau\u1e0da took it and, carefully cleaning it, kept it in his house, giving it the name of N\u00e1garamuri. At another time the ploughshare struck against the ring of a cauldron, which contained treasure. Afraid to disturb it, Chavuda Gau\u1e0da covered it up again, but that night had a dream, in which he was directed to offer a human sacrifice and take the treasure. On hearing this his two slaves volunteered to be the victims on condition that their memory was preserved. All the preparations being made, the place was dug up at night, and the slaves, after ablutions, prostrated themselves to the cauldron and were beheaded with the sword N\u00e1garamuri.\n\nWith this accession of wealth the Gau\u1e0das raised a small force and began to subdue the neighbouring villages. But they were seized and sent to Vijayanagar by orders from the king, and there put into custody. Hearing that a p\u00e1legar near Balihalu was rebellious, they made an offer through the court musicians to punish him if allowed to do so. Permission being given, they went with a force and killed the p\u00e1legar, on which they were released and confirmed in the possession of the places they had captured, receiving from the king a seal (sikha).\n\n\\(^1\\) This cot is now in the Victoria Institute at Mysore.\nmoharu). The town of Keladi was then founded, together with the temple of R\u00e1m\u00e9svara.\n\nOne day while the Gau\u1e0da was hunting, a hare turned upon his hounds, indicating heroic virtue in the soil of the place in which this occurred. He therefore removed his town to the spot, calling it Ikk\u00e9ri. His son and successor, with the sanction of Sad\u00e1siva R\u00e1ya the Vijayanagar sovereign, took the name of Sad\u00e1siva N\u00e1yak.\n\nTwo mounds, called Kalte, at the entrance to Keladi are pointed out as the scene of the human sacrifices. The principal building in the place is the double temple of R\u00e1m\u00e9svara and Virabhadra, a large and plain structure.\n\nKodachadri.\u2014A lofty mountain in the west of the Nagar taluq and a conspicuous landmark. Its height is 4,411 feet above the sea. It rises more than 2,000 feet above the level of the villages below, and is clothed with splendid forests. From Nagavadi, at the head of the Kollur ghat, it is 4 miles distant, and from this point the ascent is 3 miles. The first portion of the hill is very steep and difficult to ascend. Above this is a temple to the Huli Deva, tiger god, whose image is provided with thirty-two arms. The top of the hill, which from a distance has a bluff appearance, is in reality a narrow ridge, in many places only 12 feet across, with a precipice on either side. It commands an extensive and splendid view over the Western Ghats and Kanara.\n\nOn the west the hill descends almost perpendicularly for 4,000 feet, and the Kanara forests lie spread out below. The sea appears quite close, and on a clear day the vessels are discernible with the naked eye. The bay and town of Kundapur lie opposite. But for the very limited level space on the top, and the difficulty of access, this hill would make a most desirable sanitarium, having a beautiful climate, and so near the sea that it catches the earliest breath of the sea-breeze. There is a small bungalow at the top.\n\nKudali.\u2014A sacred village in Shimoga taluq, at the confluence (k\u00fadali) of the Tunga and Bhadra, where they unite to form the Tungabhadra, about 9 miles north-east of Shimoga. Population, 949.\n\nIt is the seat of a ma\u1e6dha connected with the one at Sring\u00e9ri, the original Guru having been appointed by the Sring\u00e9ri Sw\u00e1mi about 500 years ago to minister to the Sm\u00e1rtas of Mahratta descent. There is also a ma\u1e6dha of the M\u00e1dhva sect. Notwithstanding their being subject to the K\u00fadali gurus, the Mahrattas under Parasuram Bhao plundered and burnt the place in 1791, and were consequently threatened with excommunication, which was averted by timely gifts. There are three old temples at K\u00fadali, dedicated to Brahmes\u2019vara, Narasimha and R\u00e1mes\u2019vara.\nOf inscriptions at the place the one with the oldest pretensions is on copper plates at the Brahmes'vara temple, professing to be a grant by the emperor Rukm\u00e1ngada ruling at Ay\u00f3dhya. The Sring\u00e9ri ma\u1e6dha has one, also on copper, dated S'aka 1075, a grant by a Kadamba king named Purandara R\u00e1ya. Of those on stone, the oldest are of the Hoysala period. One records a grant to the R\u00e1man\u00e1tha temple by Vira-Ball\u00e1la (III) on the return of his son from Delhi, whither apparently he had been taken in the Muhammadan invasion. Later grants are by the Vijayanagar kings, and the Sring\u00e9ri ma\u1e6dha has copper grants by the Kladi chief Somasekhara N\u00e1yak in the 17th century.\n\nKumadvati or Choradi.\u2014An affluent of the Tungabhadra. It rises in Agastya Parvata or the Bilesvara hill near Humcha, and flowing north near Kumsi and Shik\u00e1rpur, receives at the latter place a stream on the left from Anantapur. Continuing north, it forms the large Masur Madaga tank on the frontier, and turning north-east, runs into the Tungabhadra at Mudanur, some distance above Harihar.\n\nIt is stemmed by twelve anicuts, giving rise to channels 33 miles in total length.\n\nKumsi.\u2014A town on the Shimoga-G\u00e9rsoppa road, 14 miles north-west of Shimoga. Head-quarters of the Kumsi sub-taluq (composed of Kumsi and H\u00e1ranhalli hoblis), and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus             | 694   | 680     | 1,374 |\n| Muhammadans       | 159   | 122     | 281   |\n| Christians         | 1     | \u2014       | 1     |\n| Total              | 854   | 802     | 1,656 |\n\nFrom inscriptions at the place it appears that its correct name is Kumbase, and that it was granted as an endowment by Jinadatta R\u00e1ya of Pomburcha (Humcha) for the Jain temple there. Kumsi was formed into a sub-taluq under Shimoga taluq in 1882.\n\nMunicipal Funds.\n\n| Income | Expenditure |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 1892-3 | 674         |\n| 1893-4 | 656         |\n| 1894-5 | 771         |\n| 1895-6 | 1,208       |\n|        | 826         |\n|        | 998         |\n|        | 781         |\n|        | 1,169       |\n\nThe Chola king R\u00e1j\u00e9ndra-Deva claims to have gained a great victory over the Ch\u00e1lukyas in the middle of the 11th century at K\u00fadali-sangam, which, as Dr. Hultzsch thinks, may be this place. On the other hand, it may be one near S'ris'aila.\nMadagada-kere or Masur-Madaga-kere.\u2014A large tank in Shik\u00e1rpur taluq, 7 miles north of the kasba, on the frontier. It is formed by embanking the waters of the Choradi or Kumadvati, at a point where it runs through a gorge in a low chain of hills. The original bund was 660 feet wide at top and 90 feet high, and according to an Arabic inscription on the spot it was at one time repaired by the Nav\u00e1b of S\u00e1vanur. The sheet of water\u2014second only to the S\u00falekkere\u2014thus formed irrigated a large extent of land in Dharwar. When the tank breached many years ago, the bund was reconstructed on a smaller scale, in consequence of which a considerable tract of rich land, formerly included in the bed of the tank, was left bare. This was soon taken up for cultivation, and as many as thirty-five villages have sprung up around, contributing Rs. 45,000 more to the Mysore revenue than was formerly realized. Should the embankment be ever raised to its original standard, as at one time contemplated, most of these villages would be submerged.\n\nMalavalli.\u2014A village in the north of Shik\u00e1rpur taluq, about 9 miles from Siralkoppa. Population, 588.\n\nOf interest on account of a pillar discovered by me there bearing an inscription of H\u00e1ritiputra S\u00e1takarni, probably of the second century; the oldest in Mysore next to the Edicts of Asoka. From this it appears that the original name of the village was Ma\u1e6d\u1e6dap\u0101\u1e6d\u1e6di.\n\nNagar.\u2014A taluq in the south-west. Area 529 square miles.

In 1875 a portion of it was again added to Nagar.\n\nThe taluq is enclosed on three sides by hills, the drainage of which\nflows north-west, uniting in the Sharavati. But the streams in the south-west of the taluq run directly down the Ghats westward and discharge into the sea at Kundapur, forming in S. Kanara the three rivers Gargita, Chakra nadi, and Mudur. The Honn\u00e1r hobli in the north-west is an isolated bit of country belonging to S. Kanara, and forming part of the endowments of the temple at Kollur below the ghats. The principal mountain is the Kodach\u00e1dri parvata in the north west, to the north of which is the Kollur ghat. The other pass to the coast is by the Haidar Ghar or Hosangadi ghat in the south-west.\n\nThis is a purely Malnad taluq. The whole is densely wooded, the southern part being composed of a perfect cluster of hills, in a basin formed by which Nagar, the capital formerly called Bednur, is situated. The Sharavati flows from south to north, and its valley may be said to be the most open portion of this very inaccessible country. The R\u00e1machandrapur N\u00e1la is a small stream which flows very close to and almost parallel with the Sharavati, and joins it near the boundary of the taluq. To the west of the valley in which these two streams flow the appearance of the country becomes wilder and wilder as the Ghats are approached, and these are here more precipitous than usual, and present few natural outlets. The rise towards the crest of the Ghats is very rapid, a height of 4,411 feet being attained at Kodach\u00e1dri, a mountain on whose summit meet the three boundaries of South Kanara, Nagar, and S\u00e1g\u00e1r taluqs. To the east of the Sharavati and to the north generally the country is more level, although the extent of jungle appears to suffer no diminution; but it changes considerably in character, the proportion of timber trees seeming to be greater than to the west, where the soil is more shallow, with much laterite.\n\nThe productions of the country are areca-nut, pepper, cardamoms, and rice. Dry crops are not raised anywhere. The areca-nut is reputed to be of very fine quality, but the gardens have been much neglected. They largely belong to Brahmans, who are dependent on labour imported from the coast for their cultivation. The forests are chiefly k\u00e1ns, there being but little deciduous forest; what there is being found chiefly to the north and east, towards Anantapur. Rice is exported to the coast, and areca-nut to Bellary and Wal\u00e1japet by way of Birur. All other articles of consumption, and cloths of every description are imported from the plain countries; about one-fourth by the merchants who come to buy areca-nut, and the rest by ryots from Tirthahalli, Avinhalli, and Kollur, either on bullocks or by porters.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1877, except in the Haritala and Kerehalli hoblis, which were settled in 1874 when they\nformed part of the Anantapur taluq. The area of the taluq was thus distributed in the survey of 1877:\n\nCulturable (dry, 8,169; wet, 31,268; garden, 2,255) ... 41,692\nUnculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... 189,136\nTotal acres ... 230,828\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 10,775 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,82,026, and in 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,63,997.\n\nThe average rainfall at Nagar for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other station for 3 years (1893-5), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Nagar | 0'14 | 0'12 | 0'86 | 3'92 | 4'20 | 7'20 | 3'03 | 4'02 | 1'50 | 7'89 | 2'02 | 0'34...184'43 |\n| Kollurkatte | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1'24 | 2'79 | 1'79 | 2'57 | 9'26 | 1'11 | 2'41 | 3'69 | 5'43 | 1'22 | ... 92'18 |\n\nAnother register for 22 years makes the annual average at Nagar 192'59 inches.\n\nConsiderable attention has been paid in recent years to improving the communications of the taluq, by a system of roads radiating from Kollurkatte. There are thus roads east to Ayanur, and north to Sagur and to Anantapur; with the Ghat roads to the coast south, through Nagar and Haidarghar to the Hosangadi ghat, and west to the Kollur ghat. There is also a road from Anantapur south through Humchada-katte to Tirthahalli, and one is projected from Hulikal near Haidarghar to Tirthahalli. A branch from the Sagur road connects with the Kollur ghat road.\n\nNagar.\u2014A town situated 13\u00b0 50' N. lat., 75\u00b0 6' E. long., on the Kollurkatte-Haidarghar road. Head-quarters till 1893 of the Nagar taluq, and has a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus             | 702    | 716      | 1,418  |\n| Muhammadans       | 64     | 64       | 128    |\n| Christians         | 19     | 11       | 30     |\n| Total              | 785    | 791      | 1,576  |\n\nIt was originally a small village, called, from the nature of the forest around, Bidaru halli, bamboo village, and contained a temple of Nilakantha, the property of a Brahman named Honne Kambli Bhatta. About 1640, under the name of Bidarur or Bidanur (Bednur), it became the capital of the Keladi chiefs, who transferred the seat of their government hither from Ikkeri. Being in the direct course of\ntrade by the Hosangadi ghat, it rapidly increased in size and importance, until there was a prospect of the houses reaching the number of a lakh, which would entitle it to be called a Nagar. The walls were 8 miles in circumference, and had 10 gates, named the Dilli, Kodial, Kavaledurga, &c. The palace was on a hill in the centre, surrounded with a citadel, and the whole city was encircled by woods, hills and fortified defiles, extending a great way in circumference.\n\nSivappa Nayak, whose conquests have been elsewhere described, did much to improve and enlarge the town, and his successors ruled here undisturbed till 1763, at which time their territories extended from Sante Bennur and Holalkere in the east, over the whole of South Kanara to the western coast. In that year Haidar Ali, having conquered all the northern parts of Mysore, advanced upon this capital. The Rani Virammaji, having in vain tried to buy him off with offers of large sums of money, took to flight, ordering the palace to be fired if the treasures could not be saved. The terror-stricken inhabitants fled en masse to the woods. Haidar pressed on, and, storming the town, extinguished the flames of the palace and gained possession of a booty estimated at twelve millions sterling in value.\n\nIn pursuance of the intention to make it a Nagar, he gave the place the name of Haidar-Nagar, and greatly increased its trade. He built a palace outside the fort, established in the town his principal arsenal, which employed many hands in the manufacture of arms and ammunition, and continued the mint, where coins were first struck in his name, the Haidari pagodas, and much money was coined during his reign. He gave great encouragement to merchants, and endeavoured, but with little success, to introduce the cultivation of mulberries and the rearing of silkworms.\n\nThe place suffered much during the wars with Tipu Sultan. It was captured by the British in February 1783, under General Matthews, and surrendered at the end of April. During the sieges the palace and the town were burnt. Tipu rebuilt the palace, and endeavoured to restore the town, but his regulations for the protection of internal trade dealt a severe blow to its prosperity. He also appointed a Kazi, who pulled down the Christian church and Hindu temples, broke to pieces numerous inscriptions on stone, and erected a mosque from the ruins. In the insurrection of 1830, Nagar, as it was called after 1789, again became the object of attack. But from the time that the court was removed the place lost its prospects, as it never obtained a footing as a mercantile town between the table-land and the coast, being merely a place of transit. Mr. Stokes, writing in 1838, says:\u2014\"Nagar and its vicinity exhibit traces of great decline in wealth and population.\"\nIt has nearly lost its trade, for which, from the difficulty of access, it is not naturally well adapted.\" Under the R\u00e1ja's government it gave its name to the Nagar Faujdari, which included the present Districts of Shimoga and Kadur. From 1831 that name was changed to Nagar Division, and from 1863 to 1881, when Divisions were abolished, the Nagar Division was composed of the Shimoga, Kadur and Chitaldroog Districts. Nagar has latterly benefited by the opening out and improvement of the ghat-roads, but the transfer of the taluq headquarters to Koll\u00farka\u1e6d\u1e6de in 1893 further tends to diminish its importance.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892\u20133. | 1893\u20134. | 1894\u20135. | 1895\u20136. |\n|------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income           | ...    | 486    | 512    | 497    | 642    |\n| Expenditure      | ...    | 621    | 578    | 554    | 669    |\n\n**Nyamti.**\u2014A town situated in 14\u00b0 9' N. lat., 75\u00b0 38' E. long., on the Honn\u00e1li-Ayanur road.

The grain of the Maln\u00e1d and the jaggory of the neighbouring taluqs, which can be stored in this dry climate for some time without risk of damage, with areca-nut from Nagar and Koppa, are forwarded to Bellary, Dharwar, &c., in return for cloths and other articles, which are sent to the Maln\u00e1d and Kanara.

The west and greater part of the north and south are bounded by the Ghats, a spur from which crosses the taluq from west to east, passing south of Ikk\u00e9ri and parting the western from the northern streams. The Sharavati runs through the middle from south to north-west, receiving near B\u00e1ranji the Yenne Hole. On touching the frontier it turns west, and descending the Ghats in the far-famed Falls of Gersoppa, flows to the sea at Honavar. The principal stream running north is the Varada, which rises near Ikk\u00e9ri. The chief heights are Deva-konda and Govardhangiri.\n\nThe taluq is considered purely Maln\u00e1d, but there is a considerable difference between the south-western and north-eastern portions, separated mostly by the river Sharavati. The rice-fields in the former bear a double crop annually, but the gardens, stocked with areca palms, pepper and cardamoms, are somewhat inferior. This tract presents the appearance of a rolling stretch of bare hill-tops, the sides and valleys densely wooded, the latter occupied by the gardens. The scenery is surpassingly beautiful, and the climate, in the hottest time of the year, is cool and pleasant. The people live in separate homesteads, and village communities, so far as living in one place is concerned, are unknown. The remaining portion of the taluq is comparatively level and open, but the climate is not so good as in the other part. Only one crop of rice can be raised annually, but some\nof the gardens are remarkably fine. The people, as a rule, live together in villages, but still there are many homesteads scattered here and there, principally to the south-west.\n\nThe forests, although on the whole extensive, are not in compact masses, nor are they very productive. Excepting the great Hinni forest, which lies to the south of the Gersoppa Falls, the remainder are chiefly k\u00e1ns, or tracts of virgin evergreen forest, in most of which pepper grows abundantly self-sown and uncared for, but little of the produce being collected owing to the depredations of monkeys. There are also towards the south patches of evergreen forest, generally only a few acres in extent, with very sharply-defined limits. There is a thick undergrowth of a low plant called Goravi katige. Deciduous timber trees are rare. Inside one of these patches of forest the growth of trees and underwood is so dense that it is difficult to pass through; on emerging, suddenly hardly a bush will be visible for the hundreds of yards or more of grassy open which may intervene between the patches. The real cause of this alternation of bare ground and densely-wooded patches is to be found in the laterite formation. Wherever the hard bed of laterite is near the surface wood refuses to grow. Towards the east the forest is gradually disappearing before the inroads of garden cultivators, who mercilessly strip and clear the Bayan Betta, as they are called, in order to obtain the soppu, or leaf manure, which is indispensable for their gardens.\n\nIn the k\u00e1ns the soil is rich and deep, but in most of the taluq the soil is hard and shallow, with much laterite. S\u00e1gar is essentially a garden taluq, and rice cultivation is also extensive. Dry crops are of no account, and raised on the same ground only once in three or four years. The rice is largely exported by the ryots themselves, chiefly to Gersoppa, by way of the Govardhangiri and Hinni ghats; but that of the southern m\u00e1ganis is often sent to Bhatkala or Baidur. Areca-nut is exported principally towards Bellary, though some goes also to Walajapet and to Birur. Cardamoms and pepper are taken to the Kanara and Dharwar markets.\n\nAt first under the Kadambas, this country subsequently was subject to the rule of the S\u00e1ntara kings of Pomburcha, as feudatory to the Ch\u00e1lukyas. Various governors of the Banavase Twelve Thousand, appointed by the Ch\u00e1lukyas, Hoysalas and Y\u00e1davas, held sway over it from the 12th century, until under Vijayanagar the Keladi chiefs arose to power, of whose territory it formed a part until taken by Haidar and annexed to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1874. The area of the taluq was thus distributed in 1892:\u2014\nCulturable (dry, 27,790; wet, 41,282; garden, 4,224) 73,296\nUnculturalble (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... 349,932\nTotal acres ... 423,228\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 29,057 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 3,97,453, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 4,14,295.\n\nThe average rainfall at S\u00e1gar for 26 years (1870-95) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| 0'12 | 0'02 | 0'28 | 1'89 | 2'85 | 14'19 | 26'86 | 12'94 | 5'23  | 5'22 | 1'28 | 0'18 | ... 71'06 |\n\nAnother register for 23 years makes the annual average 69'71.\n\nThe high road from Shimoga to the Gersoppa Falls runs through Anantapur and S\u00e1gar. From S\u00e1gar there are roads north to Sir\u00e1l-koppa, with a branch to Sorab, and south to K\u00fallurka\u1e6d\u1e6de, with a branch to the Kollur ghat. From Anantapur there are roads south-west to K\u00fallurka\u1e6d\u1e6de and Nagar, and south to Tirthahalli. The passes to the coast are the Gersoppa, Hinni, and Govardhangiri to Honavar; the Hogavadi to Bhatkal; and the Karni and Kollur to Baidur. Regular roads have been constructed through the first and last of these; the others are only fit for pack bullocks, which are largely used.\n\n**Sagar.**\u2014A town on the left bank of the Varada near its source, situated in 14\u00b0 10' N. lat., 75\u00b0 5' E. long., 40 miles west-north-west of Shimoga, on the Shimoga-Gersoppa road.

Pepper, sandalwood and other products of the Maln\u00e1d are exported by them to the Madras districts east and north, and to parts of Bombay in the west, the returns being made chiefly in cloths.\n\nThe town has been recently extended to the west by a quarter named Chamar\u00e1jendra P\u00e9te, in memory of the late Maharaja's visit.\nSante Bennur.\u2014A village in Channagiri taluq, on the road from Sulekere to Sasalu railway-station. Head-quarters of the Sante Bennur hobli. Population, 1,643.\n\nIt was called Sante Bennur on account of the large weekly fair (sante) held there, and to distinguish it from Male Bennur, Rani Bennur, and others of the name. It was founded, probably in the 16th century, by a chief of the Basavapatna family, on the spot where a hare had been observed to turn upon the hounds, which indicated heroic soil. The settlement of traders and merchants was encouraged, and a large petta sprung up. Hanumappa Nayak, one of the chiefs, erected a palace at Sante Bennur, and had a skilfully-constructed honda or reservoir made in front of the ancient temple of Ranganatha, faced round with flights of steps, and with ornamental pavilions at the angles and in the centre. The one in the middle, called the Vasanta mantapa, had a fountain playing from the top. After the capture of Basavapatna the town was taken by the Musalman forces of Bijapur, under Randulha Khan, who destroyed the temple and erected in its place a mosque of very large dimensions. Hanumappa Nayak, who had been forced to retire to Tarikere and Kaldurga, was greatly incensed at this, and watching his opportunity planned a night attack, in which he put to death the Muhammadan governor, and desecrated the mosque with the blood of hogs, pulling out a stone from the walls of each compartment. The Tarikere chiefs eventually regained the place and held it until it was taken by Chitaldroog early in the 17th century. In 1717 it was captured by the Bednur chiefs, who fortified it, and in spite of repeated attacks by Chitaldroog, retained it till 1761, when it fell into the hands of Haidar Ali. In common with other places in the neighbourhood it was plundered and destroyed by the Mahrattas under Parasu Ram Bhaoo in 1791. The mosque, never used since its desecration, and the honda, with its ruinous but graceful pavilions, are the only points of interest now left.\n\nSharavati.\u2014A river which rises at Ambu-tirtha, near Nonabar, in the Tirthahalli taluq. It takes a north-westerly course by Fatte-petta, receives the Haridravati on the right below Pattaguppe, and the Yenne Hole on the left above Barangi. On arriving at the frontier it bends to the west, and precipitating itself down the celebrated Falls of\nGersoppa, and passing that village (properly G\u00e9ru-sappe), which is really some 18 miles distant, discharges into the sea at Hon\u00e1var in N. Kanara. The name Shar\u00e1vati, arrow-born, is in allusion to its flowing from the Ambu-tirtha, which was formed by a stroke of Rama\u2019s arrow. The stream is crossed by 70 anicuts, from which small channels are drawn having an aggregate length of 26 miles.\n\nThe magnificent Falls of Gersoppa, or J\u00f3g, that is, the waterfall, as they are called by the natives, are unquestionably the grandest natural beauty in Mysore, rich as it is in splendid scenery. They eclipse every other Fall in India and have few rivals in any part of the world. \u201cWhile excelled in height by the Cerosoli and Evanson cascades in the Alps, and the Falls of the Arve in Savoy, the Gersoppa cataract surpasses them in volume of water precipitated; and while much inferior to Niagara in volume, it far excels those celebrated Falls of the New World in height.\u201d\u00b9 They are situated in 14\u00b0 14' N. lat., and 74\u00b0 50' E. long., on the borders of Mysore and N. Kanara, 62 miles from Shimoga in the former and 30 from the port of Hon\u00e1var (Honore) in the latter. Their existence appears to have been unknown at the time of Buchanan\u2019s journey in 1800. The Shar\u00e1vati, flowing over a very rocky bed about 250 yards wide, here reaches a tremendous chasm, 960 feet in depth, and \u201cperforms (as Captain Newbold has expressed it) this stupendous lover\u2019s leap from the chains of the giant Ghats into the arms of his ocean-rescued\u00b2 mistress\u2014prolific Kanara.\u201d\n\nThe water comes down in four distinct falls, presenting a scene of transcendent grandeur and sublimity, whose effect is greatly heightened by the wild and beautiful country around, covered with a wealth of luxuriant vegetation. The R\u00e1ja Fall\u00b3 pours in one unbroken column sheer to the depth of 830 feet. Half way down it is encountered by the Roarer, another fall, which precipitates itself into a vast cup and then rushes violently downwards at an angle of forty-five degrees to meet its famous compeer. A third fall, the Rocket, shoots downwards in a series of jets; while the fourth, called the Dame Blanche, is an\n\n\u00b9 The height of the Cerosoli cascade is 2,400 feet; that of Evanson 1,200 feet and the Falls of the Arve 1,100 feet. At Niagara, a river two miles across, contracted to less than half its former breadth, is hurled over a precipice 164 feet high in two great sheets into the basin below.\u2014J. A. S. B., xiv, 421.\n\n\u00b2 Alluding to the legend of the formation of the western coast by Parasu Rama.\n\n\u00b3 By various visitors this has been called the Grand fall, the Main fall, and the Horse-shoe fall. The R\u00e1ja after whom it is now generally named was the Sode R\u00e1ja of Sirsi, who proposed to erect a little shrine or mandapa on the spot, the lines for the foundation of which may be seen on the stone just above the R\u00e1ja\u2019s rock which projects over the chasm.\n\nThese falls are perhaps unique as a scene of natural beauty in India free from all signs of idolatry.\nUndine-like cascade gliding quietly over the mountain side in a sheet of foam.\n\nThe most favourable time for visiting these glorious works of nature is in the cold season, when the river is low enough to admit of crossing to the Mysore side, whence the best views are obtained. During the monsoon the place is enveloped in a dense cloud of vapour, through which rises the thunder of the invisible mighty waters in their fearful descent. There are good bungalows on both the Mysore and the Bombay sides, immediately at the head of the falls. Close by the latter is a slab of rock projecting over the verge of the gulf, by lying down on which and peering over the best view is obtained of the appalling abyss from above, rendered more striking by the continual flight across it of myriads of rock pigeons, which find a congenial home in the face of the cliffs.\n\n\"I lay down flat on this shelf (says a visitor in the month of August, fifty years ago) and drew myself up to its edge, over which as I stretched my head a sight burst on the view which I shall never forget and can never hope to describe. I have since looked down the fuming and sulphurous craters of Etna and Vesuvius, but have never experienced the sensations which overwhelmed me in the first downward gaze into this (hibernice) volcano of waters: for so it looks; a chaotic scene that rivets with basilisk fascination the gaze of the spectator. It was with great reluctance and with an intense feeling of depression that I withdrew my head, drenched in spray, from the brink of the precipice. One might almost gaze for ever on this abyss in which a mighty mass of water appears eternally burying itself in a mist-shrouded grave. The clouds of spray which continually ascend heavenwards in slow and majestic wreaths appear to typify the shadowy ghosts of the entombed waters.\"\n\nThe Falls are seen to greatest advantage from the selected points of view which have been cleared on the Mysore bank, the most popular being Watkins's platform. From this side a descent may be made to the pool below, the water in which is 130 feet in depth. But this is a difficult undertaking and the re-ascent extremely laborious. The view looking upwards from below is generally considered far less impressive than from the other points, as regards the Falls themselves, but the grandly rugged features of the chasm and the winding gorge in which it is prolonged are more clearly seen in all their savage nakedness.\n\nThe varying effects of light and shade at different hours are extremely beautiful. A lovely rainbow spans the waters in the afternoon, rising with the declining sun, and even lunar rainbows are said to be formed in certain aspects of the moon. Rockets and blazing torches or\nbundles of straw cast over on a dark night, throw out a fitful glare upon\nthe jaws of the abyss, producing weird and solemn effects as viewed\nfrom the R\u00e1ja\u2019s Rock. No words can suffice to adequately describe\nthe charms of a scene replete with every element of the sublime, com-\nbining in one superb panorama so many varying aspects both of terror\nand of beauty, all instinct with the life, the force and play of moving\nwaters.\n\n\"The precipice over which the water falls affords a fine section of\ngneiss and its associated hypogene schists, which dip easterly and\nnortherly away from the Falls at an angle of about $35^\\circ$. The gneiss is\ncomposed of quartz and felspar, with both mica and hornblende, and\nalternates with micaceous, talcose, actinolitic, chloritic and hornblende\nschists, imbedding (especially the latter) iron pyrites. These rocks are\npenetrated by veins of quartz and felspar and also of a fine grained\ngranite, composed of small grains of white felspar, quartz and mica.\nThe mass of hypogene rocks has evidently been worn back several\nhundred feet by the erosion and abrasion of the cataract; the softer\ntalcose and micaceous schists have suffered most. Rock basins are\nfrequent in the bed of the river, which is worn in the rock and rugged\nwith water-worn rocky masses.\"\u00b9\n\nTwo officers of the Indian Navy, deputed by Government to measure\nthe Falls, arrived there on the 6th of March, 1856. Their account of\nthe feat, written in the old bungalow book, is as follows:\n\nThrew a light flying bridge across the chasm from the tree overhanging\nthe Roarer, to the rock westward of that called the R\u00e1ja\u2019s rock. To this\nslung a cradle of light bamboo, capable of holding two people comfortably.\nThe cradle traversed on one single and two double blocks, through which\nroved the four hawsers composing the bridge. We had previously placed\nthe bridge from the R\u00e1ja\u2019s rock to the tree, but found that the lead line\nwould not, from any single part of the bridge, plumb clear of the Roarer,\nor the rocks on either side; thus proving beyond a doubt that the pool had\nnever before been plumbed from the sides of the chasm.\n\nIn the forenoon of the 12th of March, all arrangements being completed\nand provision made against remote contingencies, we made the passage in\nthe cradle from side to side, halting in the centre to pour a libation to the\nguardian spirits of the chasm. The arrangements being found perfectly\nsatisfactory, we proceeded to plumb the pool. The cradle with one person\nwas eased away to a distance of 47 feet from the tree. The lead line was\nlowered from the shore through a block (vulgo, a pulley) on the cradle,\npassing down through its centre. The plummet consisted of 7 lbs. of\nhard lead placed in the centre of an annular life-buoy slung horizontally,\nthe whole weight being about 18 lbs. When the lead reached the pool, the\n\n\u00b9 J. A. S. B., xiv, 420.\nlife-buoy floated it, and thus the lead man in the cradle felt the loss of weight. Having during our service had a little experience in deep water, we knew that a loss of 20 lbs. from a plumb-line of upwards of 100 fathoms would be scarcely appreciable, and so we found it. But by hauling up half a fathom and letting go suddenly, the life-buoy made a discernible splash in the water. A mark was then placed on the line by the block, and the angle of its dip taken with a theodolite on the brink of the precipice near the tree, at the hypotenusal distance of 47 feet. This gave the perpendicular depression of the cradle below the instrument (on a level with the tree) as 14 feet, which, added to the line paid out, 815 feet, gave the exact depth 829 feet.\n\nIn the afternoon we descended the ravine, and with a raft of a few bamboos and three boats' breakers, paddled and sounded all round and across the pool, having previously, from above, turned off a great part of the Roarer into the Rocket. We found that 22 fathoms was the greatest depth anywhere. This sounding was taken very near the west side, about 30 yards from the head of the pool or base of the Grand Fall. We climbed the rock on which the Roarer falls, and when about 30 feet up it, the stream, which before had been mild rather, came down with great force on our devoted heads, and we had to \"hold on by our eyelids\" to prevent being washed off.\n\nBy measuring a base we ascertained the horizontal distance between the centres of the Kanara and Mysore bungalows\\(^1\\) to be 710 yards; between the Raja's rock and the tree that plumbs the Roarer, 74 yards. The top of the Raja's rock is 5 feet below the level of the above-mentioned tree. A plumb-line lowered from this tree into the bed of the Roarer measured 315 feet.\n\nOn the 15th of March, broke up our bridge, from which we had taken several satisfactory views of the chasm, and descended by a rope into the cup of the Roarer, where we breakfasted, and afterwards, with some little difficulty at one point, passed down by the side of the Roarer, and reached a position at the back of the Grand Fall, whence the Rocket and Roarer were seen to the right of it. From this place only can you have a correct idea of the great depth of the cavern in front of which the Grand Fall drops. The sky clouded over and thunder pealed when we were below. The effect was grand in the extreme. At 5 P.M. reached the top of the cliff in safety.\n\nThe new Kanara bungalow is 1,670 feet above the level of the sea, the old one 1,850. The old Mysore bungalow was 30 feet lower than the last; the new one, built at what was known as Palmer's platform, is still lower.\n\n**Shikarpur.**\u2014A taluq in the north. Area 428 square miles. Headquarters at Shikarpur. Contains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) This was the old Mysore bungalow, no longer in existence.\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Shik\u00e1rpur, 5,011; Sir\u00e1lkoppa, 2,125; Is\u00far, 1,703; S\u00e1lur, 1,490; Belag\u00e1vi, 1,470; Tagarti, 1,223; Bilak\u00ed, 1,024; Ka\u0111enandihalli, 1,033; Beg\u00faru, 1,014.\n\nThe taluq is crossed from south to north by the Choradi or Kumadvati, which forms the large Masur-Madak tank on the northern frontier. There are lines of low hills on all sides, covered with jungle, which gives shelter to numerous tigers, cheetas, and other wild beasts.\n\nBeing on the border where Maln\u00e1d and Maid\u00e1n meet, it partakes of the characteristics of both. Except for the Jambur hills running down into the middle from the north, the gently undulating surface is unbroken, and where uncultivated is covered with low scrubby jungle, which in the south and west rises into forest. The soils are chiefly reddish-brown and grey, very light and friable, and containing much sand, except in the low-lying grounds, where they are much darker in colour and more clayey. In the extreme north, however, and on the banks of the Choradi, dark brown and black soil of a superior description is found, on which wet crops are raised. In the east, where dry crop cultivation is the most successful, the soil is less sandy and more like loam, except in the high-lying wet crop land.\n\nThe main cultivation is sugar-cane and rice, especially the former, to which crop the energies of the ryots are chiefly directed, and on the successful maturing of which the prosperity of the taluq rests. Dry crops in the west are poor, chiefly r\u00e1gi, horse-gram, and castor-oil. In the east the dry crops are much better, and cotton and jola grow well in some villages. The principal export of the taluq is jaggory, which mostly goes to Dharwar, and rice, which is sent in various directions. Sir\u00e1lkoppa is the chief market for grain, and Shik\u00e1rpur for cloth.\n\nThe taluq is a perfect museum of antiquities, and no part of Mysore is richer in remains and records of the past. It is here that I have found evidence of the rule of the S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1hanas and Guptas, and the\ntrue history of the early Kadambas. Bandanikke was the chief city of the N\u00e1garakhanda Seventy, and Belg\u00e1vi of the great Banavase Twelve Thousand province, which was one of the chief possessions of succeeding dynasties, the Ch\u00e1lukyas, the R\u00e1shtarak\u00fat\u00e1s, the Gangas, the Hoysalas, the Y\u00e1davas, and others, down to the time of Vijayanagar and the Keladi or Bednur chiefs, overwhelmed in the conquests of Haidar Ali.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1873, when the area of the taluq was distributed as follows:\n\nCulturable (dry, 60,173; wet, 42,545; garden, 1,613) ... 104,331\nUnculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... 106,083\n\nTotal acres ... ... 210,414\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 26,927 acres. The total revenue demand in 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,60,105, and in 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,90,082.\n\nThe average rainfall for 26 years (1870\u201395) at Shik\u00e1rpur, and for 3 years (1893\u20135) at the other station, was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| Shik\u00e1rpur | ... | 0\u00b009 | 0\u00b011 | 0\u00b029 | 1\u00b006 | 2\u00b097 | 4\u00b039 | 8\u00b016 | 4\u00b016 | 2\u00b081 | 4\u00b060 | 1\u00b027 | 0\u00b022 | 30\u00b013 |\n| Sir\u00e1lkoppa... | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0\u00b034 | 0\u00b089 | 1\u00b035 | 6\u00b031 | 9\u00b038 | 6\u00b000 | 1\u00b031 | 9\u00b069 | 0\u00b078 | \u2014 | 36\u00b005 |\n\nAccording to another register for 23 years the average at Shik\u00e1rpur is 31\u00b033.\n\nFrom Shik\u00e1rpur there are roads to Shimoga, Anantapur, Honn\u00e1li, and Sir\u00e1lkoppa.

During the time of either Haidar or Tipu, it received its present name of Shik\u00e1rpur or Shik\u00e1ripur, hunting or hunter's town, from the abundance of game\nthere met with during a royal hunt.

The greater part of the taluq on the west and south is covered with hills and forest, abounding in tigers, cheetas, bears, and other wild animals. The ancient divisions were G\u00e1janur-p\u00e1l to the west of the Tunga, Ye\u1e0datore-p\u00e1l between the rivers, and Benkipura east of the Bhadra.\n\nThe cultivation of the taluq lies almost all in the level valleys of the rivers, but owing to the width and the depth below the level of the country of their channels, their waters are not made use of for irrigation. On the other hand, the force of the currents, especially in the Tunga, serves to float timber towards the plain country. The hills in the south-west are covered with forest; those in the east bear only\nstunted teak; the northern hills contain nothing better than scrub-jungle. Laterite is almost entirely absent. The soils on either bank of the Tungabhadra, to the north, are very rich, and the climate remarkably favourable to dry cultivation. In the rest of the taluq the soils are, generally speaking, light and sandy, but the dry crop soils, though as a rule poor, are in some few spots of a rich dark colour. R\u00e1gi is the staple crop in the red soils, but black soils, which are confined to the north and north-east, produce a variety of crops, including jola, cotton, and oil-seeds. The rice lands are mostly of poor quality and not specially productive. A small amount of sugar-cane is grown. The gardens produce a little areca-nut, with betel-leaf and plantains.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1875. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 79,550; wet, 36,289; garden, 1,490) | ... | 117,329 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | 245,482 |\n| Total acres | ... | 362,811 |\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 30,288 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,94,993, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 3,39,798.\n\nThe rainfall in the taluq varies very much between the south-west and the north-east. The following was the average for 26 years (1870\u201395) at Shimoga and Kumsi, and for 3 years (1893\u20135) at the other stations:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Shimoga | 0\u00b013 | 0\u00b002 | 0\u00b049 | 1\u00b094 | 3\u00b061 | 4\u00b098 | 7\u00b078 | 4\u00b052 | 3\u00b073 | 5\u00b025 | 1\u00b066 | 0\u00b039 | 34\u00b050 |\n| Kumsi | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Ayanur | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Benkipur | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nAnother register for 14 years makes the annual average at Shimoga 36\u00b099 inches.\n\nA railway is under construction from Birur through Benkipur to Shimoga. The high road from Bangalore to Gersoppa passes through Shimoga, whence there are roads northwards to Honn\u00e1li and Harihar, south-west to Tirthahalli and the Agumbe Ghat, and north-west to Shik\u00e1pur. From Benkipur there are roads north-east to Channagiri and Chitaldroog, and south-west to Umbalibail and Yedehalli.

From inscriptions it appears that Mandali, a suburb of Shimoga to the south, was an important place in early times under the Gangas. This part of the country was, at a later period, ruled by the Ch\u00e1lukyas and the Hoysalas, after which it was included in the dominions of Vijayanagar. Little is known of its history but that from the 16th century it was one of the possessions of the Keladi or Ikk\u00e9ri chiefs. The place was taken by Haidar in his invasion of Bednur, and he subsequently brought a number of carpenters here from Mangalore to make lighters or barges for navigating the river. But they proved to be of no use. A battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Shimoga in 1798, between the Mahrattas under Parasu Ram Bha\u00f2 and Tipu Sultan\u2019s forces under Muhammad Reza, the Benki Nav\u00e1b, when the latter, being forced back on Haidarnagar (Bednur), Shimoga was besieged. The garrison was forced to capitulate, and the Mahrattas plundered and burnt the town. The scattered survivors of the population returned on the withdrawal of their army, but after the fall of Seringapatam the place was again pillaged by Dhundia Wahag, who left Shimoga and the neighbouring villages a heap of ruins. Being made the head-quarters of the District and of the late Nagar Division, it has gradually risen in population and wealth, which is likely to increase when the railway is finished.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 13,961 | 14,365 | 16,560 | 17,478 |\n| Expenditure     | 14,320 | 15,007 | 17,000 | 22,896 |\n\nSiralkoppa.\u2014A mercantile town in the Shik\u00e1rpur taluq, 11 miles north-west of the kasba, and a municipality.\nPopulation in 1891.\n\n|                  | Males | Females | Total |\n|------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus (with 1 Jain) | 799   | 817     | 1,616 |\n| Muhammadans      | 270   | 239     | 509   |\n| Total            | 1,069 | 1,056   | 2,125 |\n\nIt is of importance as forming a point of communication between S\u00e1gar, Sorab, and other parts of Mysore, and the Dharwar, Kanara, and Bellary Districts.

The minor streams unite in the Dandavati, which, rising near Sorab, flows north and west into the Varada near Jede. The principal hill is Chandragutti in the west, rising to 2,794 feet above the level of the sea.\nExcept Chandragutti m\u00e1gan\u00ed, the taluq is gently undulating, the bottoms of the valleys being occupied by rice-fields and gardens. Above the wet lands are stretches of open dry crop fields, called hakkal, and on the highest ground are the k\u00e1ns. The woodland scenery of the taluq is unique, on account of these patches of forest. These are composed of some of the finest forest to be found in the south of India, detached in small portions, with clearly demarcated lines. This arrangement is due to the position of the laterite which forms the substratum of the whole taluq. Outside the forest, on the higher ground, the soil is only about 4 inches in depth; while within, 15 feet from the edge, it is deep and rich enough to support the largest forest trees. These k\u00e1ns are full of the wild pepper vine, the produce of which used to be largely gathered; but the most valuable product now is the juice of the bagani palm, which is extracted for toddy by the Halepaikas.\n\nRice, jaggory, and areca-nut are the chief products of the taluq. The areca palm gardens are larger and more numerous in the south and west than in the other parts, and often contain cardamoms. On the areca trees attaining a certain size, betel and pepper vines are trained up the stem. Rice and sugar-cane cultivation are universal, and the crops good and certain. When the rice has been cut and stacked, the ground while still damp is ploughed up and left fallow till the early rain in May, no Vais\u00e1kh crop being raised.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into 19 northern villages in 1868, and into the remainder of the taluq in 1871. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 72,021; wet, 52,707; garden, 1,464) | ... | 126,192 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | 124,492 |\n| Total acres | ... | 250,684 |\n\nOf the unculturable area 32,477 acres are k\u00e1n. The unoccupied arable area was 27,874 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 2,89,269, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 2,96,197.\n\nThe average rainfall at Sorab for 26 years (1870\u201395) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|------|\n| 0'19 | 0'01 | 0'23 | 1'26 | 2'63 | 10'67 | 19'89 | 10'15 | 4'82  | 5'04 | 1'13 | 0'18 | 56'20 |\n\nAnother register for 23 years makes the annual average 57'48.\n\nThere is a road through Sorab from Sir\u00e1lkoppa to Siddapur; one south from Sorab to S\u00e1g\u00e1r, with a branch from Ulavi to Sir\u00e1lkoppa; and one north to Banav\u00e1si.

It is the principal residence of the g\u00fad\u00edgars or sandalwood carvers, whose delicate and elaborate workmanship is generally well known. The articles of their manufacture chiefly in demand are boxes, caskets, and cabinets. These are completely covered with minute and complicated designs of vegetation and scroll work, interspersed with figures from the Hindu pantheon; the general effect of the profuse detail being extremely rich. The carving of Sorab is considered superior to that of Bombay or Canton, and being a very tedious process, requiring great care, is expensive. The g\u00fad\u00edgars will imitate admirably any designs that may be furnished them. Boards for album-covers, the plates from Jorrocks's Hunt, and cabinets surrounded with figures in high relief of knights in medi\u00e6val armour, have thus been produced for European gentlemen with great success.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 751    | 840    | 1,100  | 1,764  |\n| Expenditure     | 917    | 890    | 1,430  | 1,938  |\n\nSulekere, the largest tank or artificial reservoir in Mysore, is situated in the middle of the Channagiri taluq. Its margin is said to be 40 miles round, and next to the Kambham tank in Kadapa, is probably the finest reservoir in Southern India.\n\nIts name is derived from s\u00fale, courtesan, and kere, tank. \"The local legend asserts that this woman was a king's daughter, who, having formed a connection with some divinity, built, as an expiatory act, the tank, which submerged the town of her father, who cursed her as a prostitute. The work is a very fine one, and the reservoir receives the\ndrainage of twenty square miles, all of which pours into the gorge where it is built, (the main stream bearing the name of Haridra or Haridravati). The embankment is of no great length, the defile between the adjacent hills being narrow; but it is of stupendous width, height, and strength, though not quite straight. It has resisted successfully the floods of centuries, but owing to the great pressure of the volume of the water in the tank, the difficulty of properly working with rude plugs the enormous sluices was immense, and the latter in course of time became much injured, and could not be utilized. (The old wooden plugs have now been replaced by iron ones.) Of the two sluices, that to the north was called the Sidda, and that to the south the Basava, and both were in bad order. During the drought which prevailed some years ago, advantage was taken of the circumstance to repair the sluices, which a man could pass through with ease, although the first adventurer was encountered by a cobra on entering the northern one. The channels had also fallen into disrepair, and the great extent of land immediately below the tank (reputed to be more than 20,000 acres) was covered by a dense date jungle; so that the vast supply of water afforded by this magnificent reservoir flowed uselessly away to the river Tungabhadra, near Harihar. (The channels have now been fully repaired, and hundreds of acres of sugar-cane are grown under them. The feverish jungle, formerly so dreaded by cultivators, has given place to smiling gardens.) It is a remarkable fact that notwithstanding the damaged state of the sluices and the great force of the water when escaping through them, the embankment has always remained firm and uninjured, a satisfactory proof of the solidity of the structure.\"\u00b9\n\nThe construction of the tank is assigned to the 11th or 12th century, and remains are pointed out, said to have belonged to Svargavati, the city which was submerged. Its king was Vikrama R\u00e1ya, who, having no children, adopted the son of the Gauda of Billahalli. This youth received the name of Ragi Raya. But a daughter was subsequently born to the king in reward for his devotion to Siva. She was called S'\u00e1ntava, and was the heroine of the story. At the east end of the embankment is a temple of Siddesvara, in front of which are some defaced inscriptions. One appears to be a Vijayanagar grant of the 16th century. There is said to be a stone dated S'aka 1311, in the tank. A large festival is held at the temple at the time of Sivar\u00e1tri.\n\nTalagunda.\u2014A village in Shik\u00e1rpur taluq, about 2 miles north-east of Belg\u00e1mi. Population, 967.\n\nThe original village was an agrah\u00e1ra called Sth\u00e1nagund\u00far, and was\n\n\u00b9 Bowring, East. Ex., 105.\nthe place in which the Kadamba king Mukanna or Trinetra established\nthe Brahmans he had brought from Ahichchatra. According to some\naccounts there were 12,000 Brahmans of thirty-two families, and\naccording to other accounts 32,000. The place is rich in ancient\ninscriptions, the most important of which is on a pillar discovered by me\nin front of a ruined temple. It is of about the 5th century; beautifully\nengraved in what are called box-headed characters, and contains in\nhigh-flown Sanskrit verses the only apparently authentic account that\nhas been found of the origin and rise of the Kadamba dynasty.\n\nTirthahalli.\u2014A taluq in the south-west, till 1882 called Kavale-\ndurga. Area, 472 square miles. Head-quarters at Tirthahalli.\nContains the following hoblis, villages and population:\n\n| No. | Hoblis       | Villages | Hamlets | Villages classified | Population |\n|-----|--------------|----------|---------|---------------------|------------|\n|     |              |          |         | Government          | Jodi       |            |\n| 1   | Agrah\u00e1ra     | 41       | 81      | 41                  | \u2014          | 10,167     |\n| 2   | Agumbi       | 41       | 270     | 41                  | \u2014          | 15,800     |\n| 3   | \u00c1raga        | 57       | 97      | 57                  | \u2014          | 11,872     |\n| 4   | Mandagadde   | 63       | 94      | 62                  | 1          | 9,046      |\n| 5   | Muttur       | 42       | 130     | 42                  | \u2014          | 12,344     |\n|     | Total        | 244      | 672     | 243                 | 1          | 59,229     |\n\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Tirthahalli, 2,359; Tall\u00far, 1,104;\nMulb\u00e1gal, 1,018.\n\nThe Tunga enters the taluq in the south and takes a northerly\ncourse to a point west of Tirthahalli, where it is joined by the Begar-\nhalla from Sring\u00e9ri. It then runs east, forming for some distance the\nboundary between the Shimoga and Kadur Districts. All the minor\nstreams, said to number seventy-five, run into the Tunga, except a few\nin the north-west, which flow into the Sharavati. The taluq is essen-\ntially Maln\u00e1d in its nature, hills, forests, areca-nut gardens and running\nstreams being the prevailing characteristics. The whole taluq is hilly,\nespecially the west, which touches the Ghats and is covered with\nsplendid forest. The chief heights are Kavaledurga, Kabbinada-gudda,\nand Kundada-gudda, the latter, which is near Agumbi, being a very\nconspicuous point. Iron stone of a superior quality is obtained at\nKabbinada-gudda (iron hill), the iron made from which the natives\nhold to be as good as steel.\n\nThe east and south of the taluq is heavily wooded. The undulating\ncountry in the centre and north is more open, the unculturable portions\nbeing usually covered with grass and bushes. Heavy forest prevails in\nthe west, the tops of the hills only being bare. Open patches often\noccur in the forest, owing to laterite cropping up near the surface, allowing only of the growth of a little poor white grass. In the vicinity of large stretches of garden the forest has often almost disappeared, owing to reckless cutting of trees to provide leaf manure for the areca gardens.\n\nThe principal productions are areca-nut, pepper, cardamoms, and rice, with a little coffee. Sugar-cane is grown for local consumption only. The areca-nut is considered as of better quality than that of Nagar, and only a little inferior to that of Kalasa and S\u00e1gar. The whole of it is exported to Wal\u00e1ja by way of Birur, and to Bellary and Channagiri taluqs. The pepper is exported to Kanara, and cardamoms to Haveri in Dharwar. A small quantity of cardamoms is produced spontaneously in the jungles about Agumbi, but this is not so good as what is produced under the shade of areca gardens. The rice grown is mostly of the coarser varieties. In the high-lying rice lands, called Makki, a little r\u00e1gi or other dry crop is raised. Coffee cultivation was introduced in 1847, but there are no European coffee gardens, and the native gardens are few and carelessly tended. The k\u00e1ns contain less pepper than those of Sorab and S\u00e1gar, but they are valued for the toddy extracted from the hogini palms. Much of the cultivation of the taluq is in the holding of Brahmans and N\u00e1md\u00e1ri Gaudas, who, in addition to their own field hands, formerly slaves, and even now in the wilder parts fed, clothed, housed, and married by their masters, are dependent on labour from below the Ghats. These below-ghat coolies can always be recognized by the peculiar cap, made out of the spathe of the areca palm, which both men and women are accustomed to wear.\n\nLarge vessels of balapam or potstone are made at Kavaledurga, and silver cups at Tirthahalli.\n\nThis part of the country formed the S\u00e1ntalige Thousand which is mentioned in many old inscriptions. Under the Ch\u00e1lukyas the S\u00e1ntara kings of Hombucha held possession. At a later period, and during the time of the Vijayanagar sovereignty, it was called the Aragada-r\u00e1jya or \u00c1raga kingdom. Eventually the Keladi chiefs acquired it, and Kavaledurga was their principal stronghold. This was captured by Haidar Ali, and the country annexed to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1878. The area of the taluq was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 10,537; wet, 42,918; garden, 6,593) | ... | 60,048 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | 242,724 |\n| In\u00e1m village | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 1,885 |\n\nTotal acres 304,657\nThe unoccupied arable land was 9,767 acres. The total revenue demand for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 4,54,107, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 4,39,495.\n\nThe average rainfall at Tirthahalli for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other station for 3 years (1893-5), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Tirthahalli | 0'01 | \u2014 | 0'49 | 1'61 | 2'67 | 2'22 | 5'8 | 4'29 | 9'99 | 2'5 | 0'67 | 116'10 |\n| Agumbi | ... | \u2014 | 0'41 | 1'23 | 6'53 | 7'94 | 6'46 | 9'38 | 8'2 | 8'46 | 3'09 | 2'18 | 1'35 | 316'16 |\n\nAnother register for the same period makes the average at Tirthahalli 110'35.\n\nThe main road from Shimoga to the Agumbi Ghat passes through Tirthahalli, and is met at Agumbi by the Tarikere and Koppa road. From Tirthahalli there is a road north to Anantapur, and roads are proposed south to Koppa and west to Hulikal on the Hosangadi Ghat. From Mandagadde, with the river between, there is a road to Yedehalli.\n\n**Tirthahalli.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 41' N. lat., 75\u00b0 17' E. long., on the left bank of the Tunga, 35 miles south-west of Shimoga, on the Shimoga-Agumbi road. Head-quarters of the Tirthahalli taluq, and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891. | Males. | Females. | Total. |\n|-------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Hindus (with 3 Jains) | ... | 1,026 | 840 | 1,866 |\n| Muhammadans | ... | 194 | 124 | 318 |\n| Christians | ... | 99 | 76 | 175 |\n| **Total** | ... | **1,319** | **1,040** | **2,359** |\n\nThe town derives its name from the number of *tirtha* or sacred bathing-places in the Tunga at or near this spot. A pool at one of the cylindrical hollows scooped out by the water in the rocky bed is a favourite spot for cleansing away sin by ablution. The formation of the hole is ascribed to Parasu Rama, who made it with his axe. At the Ramesvara festival, held for three days in Margashira, thousands of people pass through the hole. At that season the river can be crossed by stepping over the great boulders in the bed, the difficult places where there is a rush of water being temporarily bridged over by the Brahmins.\n\nIt is the principal centre of trade for the Nagar and Koppa taluqs, valued at five to six lakhs a year, one-half of which results from transactions at the Ramesvara festival. Cocoa-nuts and cocoa-nut oil are\nimported from Kanara by the Agumbi and Hulikal ghats, and various kinds of pulse, piece-goods, cattle, &c., from the maidan taluqs.\n\nThere are two maths, the Havika math on the town side, and the Putiki math on the opposite side. To this place all the people of the Malava caste resort from Kanara and Nagar to be branded with a religious stamp, mudra dharana, by their priest the Koppada Dasiya, who comes here from Koppa. Three miles up the river is the Mulbagal math, and a mile higher the Bhimankaatte math, which claims a fabulous antiquity.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | ...    | 1,654  | 1,848  | 1,242  | 2,000  |\n| Expenditure     | ...    | 2,261  | 2,815  | 1,413  | 2,667  |\n\n**Tunga.**\u2014This river rises in the Western Ghats, at Gangamula in the Varaha parvata (Kadur District), close to the twin stream of the Bhadra. Its course is at first north-east past Sringeri to Baggunji, where it turns north-west and continues in that direction to near Tirthahalli. Thence, bending round for some distance to the east, it eventually flows north-east past Shimoga to Kudali, where it unites with the Bhadra. Near Mandagadde it branches for a short distance into seven streams, hence called Yelukalu shilu, which prevents the passage of rafts of bamboos and timber during the dry season when the water is low. Its banks are not so steep as those of the Bhadra, and it is generally esteemed a more healthy stream, its current being more rapid and the banks less shut in by dense forest. A project was formed some years ago by the Madras Irrigation Company for damming the river either at Tirthahalli or at Mallur, and constructing an immense reservoir, all the requisite surveys for which were made.\n\n**Tungabhadra.**\u2014This famous river, the chief tributary of the Krishna, is formed at Kudali, 9 miles north-north-east of Shimoga, by the confluence of the twin streams Tunga and Bhadra.\n\nFrom this point its general direction is north, but it winds so as to form three loops before reaching Honnali. Thence with a more direct course it runs north, and receiving the Choradi or Kumadvati on the left, bends to the north-east, following the Mysore frontier to Harihara, where it is joined by the Haridra from the Sullekere on the right. Running again north along the boundary, it quits this State and, continuing north-west and north, separates the Madras and Bombay Presidencies. From the point where the Varada enters it on the left the river turns north-east and, flowing past the village of Hampe,\nbetween the sites of the celebrated cities of Kishkindha, Anegundi or Hastin\u00e1vati, and Vidy\u00e1nagara or Vijayanagara, forms the common boundary of Bellary and the Nizam's Dominions, receiving on the right the Haggari or Ved\u00e1vati. Soon after this its course is directly east, along much of the Karnul and Haidarabad frontier. Passing Karnul it enters the Krishna a few miles beyond, at K\u00fa\u1e0dali Sangam or S'ris'aila.\n\nThe river is never dry, but the channel being full of rocks will not admit of floats in the hot season when the water is low. In the rainy season it swells prodigiously, and forms an extremely rapid and muddy stream, 10 or more feet higher than the rocks. It is easily fordable in the dry season; at other times ferry-boats are used for crossing at favourable spots, where the banks approach one another and the water is deep. Alligators abound in it. The maximum flood discharge determined for the Harihara bridge was 207,843 cubic feet per second, the ordinary monsoon discharge being roughly calculated at 30,000.\n\nThe river is crossed at Harihara by a fine bridge of stone and brick, consisting of 14 elliptical arches of 60 feet span each. It was completed in 1868, at a cost of $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs of rupees. There is another magnificent bridge of 52 piers at Rampur, in Bellary, where the North-West line of the Madras Railway crosses the river.\n\nThe ancient and pur\u00e1nic name of the river is the Pamp\u00e1, by which it is mentioned in the R\u00e1m\u00e1yana, and which still survives in the name of the village Hamp\u00e9, at the Pampa kshetra, the site of the celebrated ancient and modern capital cities previously mentioned. The name Tungabhadra occurs in the Bh\u00e1gavata Pur\u00e1na. The mythological origin of the river, as given in the Tungabhadra Mah\u00e1tmiya of the Brahm\u00e1nda Pur\u00e1na, is to the following effect:\u2014Hirany\u00e1ksha, son of Kasyapa Rishi by Diti D\u00e9vi, seized the earth and bore it down to the lower world. The Brahmans having no ground to stand upon, discontinued their usual rites and sacrifices. The demi-gods, being thus deprived of their usual offerings, complained to Vishnu, who, assuming the form of a var\u00e1ha or boar, plunged into the ocean, entered the lower world, destroyed the demon, and brought up the earth again. The perspiration arising from this exertion of the boar trickled down its tusks as it rested on the Var\u00e1ha parvata and formed two streams, that from the left tusk being the Tunga and that from the right tusk the Bhadra. A third stream, the Netravati, is supposed to have its origin in the same place from the n\u00e9tra, or eyes of the boar.\n\nVarada.\u2014A tributary of the Tungabhadra. It rises at Varad\u00e1 m\u00fala, near Ikk\u00e9ri, and running north past Chandragutti and B nav\u00e1si, turns to the north-east, which direction it keeps till it leaves the\nMysore. Entering Dharwar it flows north, and, bending round gradually to the north-east some distance south of Bankapur and S\u00e1vanur, runs with an easterly course into the Tungabhadra at Gulnatha, below Havanur.\n\nIt is stemmed by 51 small anicuts in S\u00e1gar and Sorab, giving rise to channels having a total length of 36 miles.\n\nThe Vara-d\u00e1 (boon giving) river originated, according to legend, in the Bhagirathi water poured from his conch by N\u00e1r\u00e1yana (Vishnu) on the head of Siva at Varad\u00e1 m\u00fala, the hermitage of Sringa muni, in order to subdue the flame of austerities which threatened to consume the gods; performed by Siva to atone for his sin in pulling off one of Brahma\u2019s five heads.\nCHITALDROOG DISTRICT\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nSituation.\u2014A District in the north. Its situation, taking the extreme limits, is between $13^\\circ 40'$ and $15^\\circ 2'$ north latitude, $75^\\circ 42'$ and $77^\\circ 6'$ east longitude; but owing to a long and narrow projection into Bellary northwards the main part of the District does not extend beyond $14^\\circ 40'$ north latitude. Its greatest length from north to south is about 88 miles, the greatest breadth from east to west about 100 miles. The arm jutting north into Bellary is 32 miles long, by from 5 to 12 broad.\n\nArea.\u2014The area is 4,022 square miles, of which 1,650 square miles are cultivated, and 1,531 square miles are unculturable.\n\nBoundaries.\u2014It is bounded on the north by the Bellary District, and on the east by the Anantapur District, both of Madras; on the south-east by Tumkur District, south-west by Kadur District, and west by the Shimoga District, all of Mysore; while on the north-west it is bounded by the Dharwar District of Bombay.\n\nDivisions.\u2014It is divided into the following taluqs, the sub-taluqs being Hosdurga, under Holalkere taluq; and Harihar, under Davangere taluq:\n\n| No. | Taluq         | Area in sq. miles | No. of Hobls. | No. of Villages or Towns | Population in 1891 | Per sq. mile |\n|-----|---------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------------|--------------------|--------------|\n| 1   | Challakere    | 790              | 4            | 191                      | 60,711             | 76.84        |\n| 2   | Chitaldroog   | 531              | 4            | 189                      | 66,546             | 125.31       |\n| 3   | Davangere     | 552              | 8            | 262                      | 94,565             | 171.31       |\n| 4   | Hiriyur       | 807              | 5            | 215                      | 54,302             | 67.28        |\n| 5   | Holalkere     | 681              | 6            | 329                      | 67,051             | 98.45        |\n| 6   | Jagalur       | 371              | 3            | 169                      | 38,229             | 103.04       |\n| 7   | Molakalmuru   | 290              | 2            | 97                       | 32,560             | 112.27       |\n| Total|               | 4,022            | 32           | 1,452                    | 413,964            | 102.92       |\n\nPhysical Features.\u2014The whole of this comparatively arid District is included in the valley of the V\u00e9davati or Haggari, with the\nTungabhadra running for a few miles along the north-western boundary. The V\u00e9davati enters the District in the south-west and flows in a north-east direction to a few miles beyond Hiriy\u00far. From this point, where the stream begins to take the name of Haggari, it runs north, within a few miles of the main eastern boundary, and leaves the District near the eastern base of the Molak\u00e1lmuru projection. During the hot months it is for the most part dry, but supplies a number of wells sunk in the sandy bed.\n\nThe District is crossed from south-south-east to north-north-west by a belt, about 20 miles broad, of intermittent parallel chains of low hills, mostly bare and stony, through which are several kanives, or passes. The eastern line runs from the west of Hiriy\u00far up to Chitaldroog (3,229 feet), and thence, with a break for some distance, continues from Kankuppa hill (2,721 feet) to the frontier. The summit of Jogi Mara\u1e0di to the south of Chitaldroog, one of the highest points in this range, is 3,803 feet above sea-level. The western parallel commences at Hosdurga (3,226 feet), and passes by M\u00e1yakonda to Anaji. Around Molak\u00e1lmuru in the north are some detached clusters of rocky hills. Of these, Nunke Bhairava hill is 3,022 feet, Jatinga R\u00e1mesvara hill 3,469, and Santigudda 2,595. This part of Mysore, says Mr. Bruce Foote, is \"occupied by a tract of country of singular beauty. The bold, rocky hills which rise out of it in every direction are divided from each other by equally picturesque valleys full of fine trees, amongst which tamarind trees, pre-eminent for their love of granitic soil, abound. The road from the travellers' bungalow at Hanagal (on the Bangalore-Bellary high road), which skirts the south side of the line of hills for the first five miles, and for the next four passes right through them, takes one through scenery not easily forgotten for its striking beauty in grand rocks and rich vegetation.\"\n\nExcept in the region of the hilly belt, the whole extent of the District north and east is an open and level plain, entirely destitute of picturesque features, but presenting at certain seasons in favourable spots a vast expanse of verdant cultivation. Though there are no trees there is abundance of excellent pasture, while the black and dreary-looking soil seems only to require the contact of water to develop its productiveness. To the north and west of Chitaldroog the surface of the country is undulating and covered with thick and rich grass. Trees are few in number.\n\nThe general level of the District is about 2,000 feet above the sea.\n\n1 Geology of the Bellary District (Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Vol. xxv).\nAt Chitaldroog it is 2,383, but at Hiri\u00fdur it is 1,965, while at Harihar, probably the lowest point in Mysore, it is only 1,830.\n\n**Rocks.**\u2014The hills in the south-east are of secondary formation. They run in straight lines in various directions, and are bare of trees, but have a green appearance in the wet season from the growth of long hill-grass upon them. They are almost constantly covered at the top with a kind of magnetic ironstone, which withstands the decomposing powers of the air and water much longer than the lower parts of the hills. These seem to be composed of ferruginous clayey slate. Through the surface of the soil appear perpendicular layers of slate, which are often intersected with quartz or marl. The slate is iron-shot and always decomposing and red.\n\nThe hills to which Chitaldroog belongs are composed of the prevailing gneiss of Mysore, the felspar being in some places of a fine red, in others of a silvery white colour. When this rock begins to decompose it assumes a slaty form, the layers of which are pretty thick, but as the disintegration advances it scales off in thin laminae which are very brittle, and in them the mica is more apparent than in the fresh rock.\n\nThe lower ridges north and west of Chitaldroog consist of a compound in which chlorite, oxide of iron, and sometimes hornblende prevail. They often form basins of considerable size, which have a very fertile soil. Many of them are naked, but some are covered with fine grass and produce trees of a middling size.\n\nWest of these ranges of hills descends an extensive and variegated valley leading towards the Tungabhadra. The lower country is variously intersected with ridges, some of which are high, and all contain in their rocks much iron and magnesia. North of M\u00e1yakonda the country becomes long waving. Here and there are single hills of short ranges, the former mostly gneissic or granitic, the latter slaty. The nearer the river is approached the more black cotton soil and marl abound. Along its course the former predominates, and below it are beds of mica slate.\n\n**Minerals.**\u2014Clay ironstone constitutes some ranges of hills near Chitaldroog. Drawing slate is also found in the neighbourhood. Schorl in quartz is met with near Harihar. Potstone and actinolite occur frequently in nests near Mattod. It has a considerable admixture of iron, and when decomposed becomes quite red. Asbestoid is found in the potstone near Talya, and ligniform asbestos among the M\u00e1yakonda hills. Lamellar actinolite at Harihar. A mineral resembling brown spar occurs near Talya and Anaji. Near the former place and others among the Chitaldroog hills is found iron glance. Carbonate\nof soda is abundant. The hills running up from Hiriyur by Chitaldroog, to the frontier at Jagalur and Anaji, form part of the auriferous tract called the Central or Chiknayakanhalli band (see Vol. I, p. 50).\n\nSoils.\u2014The black cotton soil prevails throughout the taluqs north and west of Chitaldroog, interspersed with sandy and gravelly tracts. In the west a red and loamy soil occupies the valleys. In the south the soil contains much common salt, and on that account is favourable to the growth of cocoa-nut trees, of which there are large plantations. The eastern taluqs have a light sandy soil abounding in springs. These talpargis or spring heads may be tapped at short distances from each other. The water is either conducted by narrow channels to the fields, or a kapile well is constructed, from which the water is raised by two or four bullocks. These wells extend from Maddagiri up to Molakalmuru, but do not for the most part, except in the Chitaldroog taluq, cross to the westward of a nearly central line drawn from north to south. In the Tumkur District the water is near the surface, but in the greater part of Pavugada the wells require to be cut through a soft porous rock composed of decomposed hornblende, which, however, forms a wall of tolerable durability. North and west of this the water is still lower, and hard strata of rock have sometimes to be perforated before the springs are reached.\n\nClimate.\u2014The climate, as compared with that of other parts of the Mysore, may be described as drier and hotter: a difference due to the lower elevation, the less abundant rainfall, and the absence over a large proportion of the District of considerable inequalities of surface, which might tend to retain moisture and moderate the radiation from extensive and bare plains of black or whitish grey soil. In the western taluqs during the hottest season a cool western breeze often sets in soon after nightfall, and blows during the greater part of the night.\n\nTemperature.\u2014From the recorded observations the mean average temperature throughout the year is ascertained to be about seventy-seven degrees Fahrenheit. Captain Chalmers deduced $78^\\circ25'$ as the average from a register kept from 1837 to 1841, but the readings were taken at different places in moving about the old Chitaldroog Division, which included the Tumkur District.\n\nThe following tables contain the mean recorded results for 1894 and 1895. In the former year a maximum of $98^\\circ4$ was registered in March, and a minimum of $53^\\circ$ in January. In the latter year the maximum was $100^\\circ4$ in May, and the minimum $51^\\circ2$ in December.\n| Year | Barometer | Thermometers | Aqueous Vapour | Wind | Rain | Cloud |\n|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------|------|-------|\n|      | Red. to Sea Level | Daily Range | Dry Bulb | Wet Bulb | Humidity Per Cent | Daily Velocity Miles | Mean Direction | Fall Inches | Number of Days | Mean Per Cent | No. of Days |\n| 1894 |             |              | Mean | Max. | Min. | Range | Mean | Min. | Press.

The average monthly fall is given under each taluq. The average annual rate for the remaining taluq or sub-taluq stations for the same period was as follows:\n\n| Taluq     | For 26 Years | Other Returns |\n|-----------|--------------|---------------|\n| Challakere| 17\u00b037 or 18\u00b050 |                |\n| D\u00e1v\u00e4ngere | 19\u00b065 ,, 21\u00b005 |                |\n| Hiriy\u00far   | 16\u00b078 ,, 17\u00b015 |                |\n| Holalkere | 25\u00b060 ,, 23\u00b092 |                |\n| Hosdurga  | 22\u00b047 or 22\u00b024 |                |\n| Jagal\u00far   | 17\u00b071 ,, 18\u00b088 |                |\n| Molk\u00e1lmurn| 21\u00b014 ,, 22\u00b046 |                |\n\nThe distribution of rain diminishes as a rule from south-west to north-east. Hiriy\u00far and Challakere taluqs especially form a comparatively rainless tract, receiving in some parts less than ten inches in the year. From the tables it appears that the heaviest rainfall in the District is generally in October, at the break of the north-east monsoon. Hence the distress occasioned by a failure of the rains at that season, followed as it is by severally totally dry months, including in rapid succession the coldest, and then the hottest period of the year.\n\nThe actual annual rainfall at Chitaldroog has been thus recorded:\n\n| Year | Rainfall |\n|------|----------|\n| 1868 | 21\u00b027    |\n| 1869 | 22\u00b090    |\n| 1870 | 26\u00b085    |\n| 1871 | 25\u00b033    |\n| 1872 | 26\u00b038    |\n| 1873 | 31\u00b015    |\n| 1874 | 34\u00b031    |\n| 1875 | 12\u00b014    |\n| 1876 | 8\u00b039     |\n| 1877 | 12\u00b005    |\n| 1878 | 27\u00b015    |\n| 1879 | 24\u00b055    |\n| 1880 | 32\u00b066    |\n| 1881 | 12\u00b094    |\n| 1882 | 28\u00b084    |\n| 1883 | 35\u00b030    |\n| 1884 | 18\u00b031    |\n| 1885 | 26\u00b034    |\n| 1886 | 22\u00b039    |\n| 1887 | 23\u00b017    |\n| 1888 | 26\u00b047    |\n| 1889 | 30\u00b013    |\n| 1890 | 19\u00b063    |\n| 1891 | 18\u00b092    |\n| 1892 | 22\u00b058    |\n| 1893 | 28\u00b055    |\n| 1894 | 22\u00b024    |\n| 1895 | 32\u00b098    |\n\nVegetation.\u2014This District is almost throughout a \"dry and thirsty land.\" It has no forest. Great undulating plains, covered frequently with nothing but stones and a dwarf species of mimosa (called locally the hote j\u00edlli, and armed with vicious looking and formidable spines from one to four inches in length), are dotted at wide intervals, with villages lying in the hollows, having sometimes a few trees round them. These are the characteristics of fully one-third of the District. The whole taluq of Challakere answers generally to this description, but where there is any water in the soil there are some fine cocoa-nut gardens. The pastures, too, during the cooler months of the year, are good, and the Amrit Mahal has extensive grazing grounds in Dodderi, Tallak, Hosdurga, and other parts of the District.\n\nStanding on the low range of hills near the M\u00e1ri Kanave, the view which meets the eye is not, during the rainy months, altogether so desolate. Looking up the valley of the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati towards Hosdurga a few more trees are seen, and the country is not so very bare. To the\nsouth and south-east, along the Hiriy\u00far hills, there are jungles of the k\u00e1r\u00e1chi (*hardwickia binata*). Again, between Bommagondankere and H\u00e1ngal, in the taluq of Molak\u00e1lmur\u00fa, is another tract of country covered with the k\u00e1r\u00e1chi. In the same taluq, to the east of the kasba town and on the borders of the Bellary District, is a small fuel jungle among hills; and in the western corner of the Jagal\u00far taluq is another of tolerable dimensions. Not far from the town of Chitaldroog are a few small patches of acacias, and on the J\u00f3gi matti, a hill near Chitaldroog, are a few bamboos and some poor trees of second-class timber.\n\nYet the soil would not be unproductive if it only had water. Near Jagal\u00far and Bommagondankere, and one or two other spots where irrigation is possible from either tanks or wells worked by *kapile*, heavy crops are taken. On the high lands where the soil is a disintegrated rock, the dry crops, provided sufficient rain falls, are good.\n\nThe quantity of timber for building purposes is, as may be supposed, very limited; and the large towns draw their supplies chiefly from more favoured districts. In the villages the huts are very poorly built. The stems of cocoa-nut trees and wood obtained from dead fruit-trees growing in gardens are much used, and not unfrequently the scapes of the common aloe are used both as joists and uprights.\n\nMr. Bowring remarks: \u201cIt is not improbable that this portion of Mysore may have been less sterile formerly, as on many of the hills traces are to be seen of forests cut down long ago. In fact, old records mention the existence of fine timber where such has wholly disappeared, owing, no doubt, to the reckless way in which the cultivators have cut down whatever they required for agricultural implements, regardless of the destruction caused to young trees and saplings. No one ever thought of planting new trees to replace those that had been felled, and so, as population increased and agriculture spread, the few remaining forests rapidly disappeared. The denudation of trees under which the District suffers has probably had much to do with the prevailing drought, there being scarcely any vegetation to arrest the passage of the monsoon clouds, which float onwards without depositing their valuable contents.\u201d\n\n*Avenues* have been planted along the public roads as in other Districts, but with little effect, and the trees are kept alive with much difficulty. There were 425 miles thus planted up to 1895. At the same period there were 28,172 trees in 868 groves, covering 784 acres.\n\n*Forests.*\u2014The reserved State forests are Jogimatti, 7\u00bd square miles, and Nirtadi-gudda, 5\u00bd square miles. *Plantations.*\u2014There are three Forest plantations, covering 92 acres, and nine Revenue plantations,\ncovering 251 acres. Groves.\u2014There are 820 groves or topes in 798 villages, planted with 25,097 trees. Avenues have also been planted on both sides of 417 miles of road.\n\nCultivation.\u2014Chitadroog, Hiriyur, Mayakonda, Davangere, and Bilchod produce cotton, which is also grown, though in smaller quantities, in Anaji, Kankuppa, and Molakalmuru. Flax for the manufacture of linseed oil is raised in Davangere, Kankuppa, and Bilchod. All the northern taluqs produce wheat, jola, navane, sugar-cane, and chenna. Rice is less abundant. Cummin seed is grown in the north-east. In the south, about Mattod, are extensive groves of cocoanut trees, growing, as in the neighbouring parts of Tumkur, in the dry lands without irrigation. The cultivation in the south-west consists of the ordinary dry crops raised on red soil. All along the east the kapiile wells are largely used in raising crops by irrigation, including ragi, which on the Bellary border is cultivated in no other way.\n\nThe following are the principal crops cultivated in the District:\n\n| Kannada name | Botanical name          | English name       |\n|--------------|-------------------------|--------------------|\n| **Cereals**  |                         |                    |\n| Baragu       | Panicum milaceum        |                    |\n| Bhatta       | Oryza sativa            | Rice               |\n| Godhi        | Triticum aristatum      | Wheat              |\n| Haraka       | Panicum semiverticillatum | \u2014                 |\n| Jola         | Holcus sorghum          | Great millet       |\n| Navane       | Panicum italicum        | Italian millet     |\n| Ragi         | Eleusine corocana       | Ragi               |\n| Sajje        | Holcus spicatus         | Spiked millet      |\n| Same         | Panicum frumentaceum    | Little millet      |\n| **Pulses**   |                         |                    |\n| Avare        | Dolichos lablab         | Cow gram           |\n| Hesaru       | Phaseolus mungo         | Green gram         |\n| Hurali       | Dolichos uniflorus      | Horse gram         |\n| Kadale       | Cicer arinetinum        | Bengal gram        |\n| Korasani     | \u2014                       | Panic seed         |\n| Tadagani     | Dolichos catiang        | \u2014                  |\n| Togari       | Cajanus indicus         | Pigeon pea, doll   |\n| Uddu         | Phaseolus minimus       | Black gram         |\n| **Oil Seeds**|                         |                    |\n| Haralu       | Ricinus communis        | Castor oil         |\n| Huchchellu   | Guizotea oleifera       | Wild gingelli      |\n| Wollelu      | Sesamum orientale       | Gingelli           |\n| **Vegetables (Native)** |                     |                    |\n| Bellulli     | Allium sativum          | Garlic             |\n| Jirige       | Cuminum cyminum        | Cummin seed        |\n| Kottambari   | \u2014                       | Coriander          |\n| Mensina kayi | Capsicum annuum         | Chilly             |\n| Mentya       | Trigonella foenum graecum | Fenugreek         |\n| Nirulli      | Allium cepa             | Onion              |\n| Saute kayi   | Cucumis sativus         | Cucumber           |\n| Kannada name | Botanical name | English name |\n|-------------|---------------|--------------|\n| Adike       | Areca catechu | Areca nut.   |\n| Arale       | Gossypium indicum | Cotton.     |\n| B\u0101le        | Musa sapientum | Plantain.    |\n| Hoge soppu  | Nicotiana tabaccum | Tobacco.    |\n| Hunase      | Tamarindus indica | Tamarind.   |\n| Kabbu       | Saccharum officinale | Sugar-cane. |\n| Sanabu      | Crotolarea juncea | Country hemp. |\n| Tengina k\u0101yi | Cocos nucifera | Cocoanut.   |\n| Viledele    | Piper betle   | Betel vine.  |\n\n**Area under principal crops.**\u2014The cultivation of rice covered in 1893 an area of 34,954 acres; wheat, 1,152; other food grains, 730,659; oil seeds, 64,538; sugar-cane, 296; cotton, 44,676; fibres, 947; tobacco, 1,494; other crops, 10,762.\n\n**Wild animals.**\u2014The tiger, panther, bear, hy\u00e6na and wild hog infest more or less all the hilly and wild tracts. Deer are to be found chiefly in Hiriy\u016br, Chitaldroog and Holalkere taluqs.\n\n**Birds.**\u2014All kinds of wild fowl are very numerous in the secluded tanks in the south of the District. Pelicans may be seen about Mattod.\n\n**Domestic animals.**\u2014The cattle vary greatly in size and strength, some of the largest and finest in the south of India being occasionally bred, while the ordinary run of those employed by the ryots, both for domestic and agricultural purposes, is of small size and stature. The best cows and oxen are bred in Chitaldroog and the taluqs to the north and east of it. Buffaloes are finest in the neighbourhood of Chitaldroog.\n\nThe best sheep, and those which yield the finest wool, are bred in the north-western parts of the District. In the south and west they are slightly inferior, while those of Hiriy\u016br are considered still less valuable.\n\n**Live Stock.**\u2014The number of cows and bullocks in 1893 was 235,118; buffaloes, 63,334; horses and ponies, 1,998; donkeys, 4,383; sheep and goats, 316,300.\n\n**HISTORY**\n\nThe plates existing in Shimoga District, which profess to record grants made at Harihara by the emperor Janamejaya in 3066 and 3022 B.C., have been referred to under that District, and in the general chapter on History in Vol. I.\nMauryas.\u2014But the oldest authentic inscriptions found in Mysore, and indeed in Southern India, are the Edicts of Asoka discovered by me in 1892 in Molakalmuru taluq; and no older inscriptions have come to light anywhere in India. This discovery carried back the history of Mysore to the 3rd century B.C., and threw a new light on the condition of the Peninsula at that period. The accounts of Bhadra-b\u00e1hu and Chandra Gupta at Sravana Belgola (Hassan District) had connected Mysore with the Mauryas, but the Edicts of Asoka made it clear that the north of the country, probably the province long afterwards known as Kuntala, was a component part of the Maurya empire.\n\nSatavahanas.\u2014The next link in the chain of evidence for the early history of the District was the find of Buddhist lead coins on the site of the ancient city of Chandr\u00e1vali, immediately to the west of Chitaldroog. One at least of the coins bore the name of the S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1-hana king Pulom\u00e1yi, and in conjunction with the inscription of H\u00e1ritiputra S\u00e1takarni, discovered by me in Shik\u00e1rpur taluq (Shimoga District), left little doubt that the S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1hanas held sway over the north of Mysore in the 2nd century A.D.\n\nKadambas.\u2014The Kadambas succeeded the S\u2019\u00e1tav\u00e1hanas, and there is probably a trace of them in an old inscription at Anaji, which may be of the 4th century, and which mentions a great battle between a Pallava king named Nanakk\u00e1sar and a king named Krishnavarma, doubtless a Kadamba. The latter suffered so complete a defeat that the prince S\u2019ivanandavarma retired in consequence from the world. Banavasi was the chief Kadamba capital, but Uchch\u00e1sringi is also mentioned as an important seat of their government, and this corresponds either with Uchchangi-durga near D\u00e1vangere, or with a hill of the same name, but also called Hire-A\u2019ryara-durga, near Molak\u00e1l\u00f1muru, some Kadamba inscriptions being found here. A rock inscription of Chandiyamarasa, to the south-west of Chitaldroog, is also probably Kadamba.\n\nThe Ch\u00e1lukyas in the 6th century reduced the Kadambas to the condition of feudatories, and soon extended their dominion over this District in their contests against the Pallavas. But in the 8th century the R\u00e1shttrak\u00fat\u00e1s became supreme, and so remained for two hundred years. Under them part of the District seems to have been attached to the Kadambalige n\u00e1d.\n\nNolambas.\u2014But the distinctive ruling race in the District at this time was the No\u0142ambas or Nonambas, a branch of the Pallavas, and their territory was the Nolambav\u00e1di or No\u0142ambav\u00e1di Thirty-two Thousand, called in an inscription a girdle for her loins (kati-n\u00fapura) to the Lady Earth. They had a capital at Penjeru or Henjeru, now Hemavati, close to the eastern point of Hiriy\u00far taluq, but they also had\na city, Nolambapattana, of which only the name remains, to the east of Chitaldroog, near Aymangala, properly Ayyapamangala, so named after a Nolamba king, as also was Nanniv\u0101la.\n\nThe Ch\u0101lukya power was revived at the end of the 10th century, and their government of Nolambav\u0101di was at one time under the prince Vishnuvarddhana Vijay\u0101ditya, who had his capital at Kampili (in the Puryabhadra in Bellary District) and then under the prince Jayasingha No\u1e37amba Pallava, who also ruled over Banavase. From about the middle of the 11th to the end of the 12th century, the government was hereditary in a family of P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dyas, of whom Tribhuvana Malla P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya Deva, Vijaya P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya Deva, Vira P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya Deva, and another Vijaya P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya Deva are mentioned; whence the region, or some portion of it, was also called the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya r\u0101jya and the P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dya ma\u1e47\u1e0dala. Its capital at this time was at Uchchangi-durga (near D\u0101vangere). In the latter part of the period, though subordinate to the Kalachurya kings who supplanted the Ch\u0101lukyas, these P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dyas appear to have affected some degree of independence. They claim to be of the Y\u0101dava race and lords of K\u0101nchipura.\n\nHoysalas.\u2014At the close of the 12th century the District was absorbed in the kingdom of the Hoysalas, whose capital was at Dorasamudra (Halebid, Hassan District). Nolambav\u0101di and Nirgunda were both provinces of the Hoysala dominions, and descendants of the Ganga kings appear to have continued to rule over the latter as subordinate governors. The north-east, as far as Ni\u1e0dugal, was subdued by Vishnuvarddhana, and Molak\u0101lmuru by Vira Ball\u0101la.\n\nFor about 15 years from 1270, the Y\u0101dava kings of Devagiri (Daulatabad) gained some advantage over the north-western parts of the District, and the seat of the provincial government was apparently established by them at Bet\u016br, near D\u0101vangere, which, however, is also described as having long before been the capital of some local chieftain.\n\nIn 1287 the Hoysalas had recovered their possessions in this part of Mysore, but the seat of government seems to have been transferred to Bemmattana-kallu, the present Chitaldroog. Before long both Devagiri and Dorasamudra were taken and sacked by the Muhammadans, and the two royal lines were brought to an end.\n\nVijayanagar.\u2014From the middle of the 14th century, under the Vijayanagar sovereigns, who next became paramount, Bemmattana-kallu continued the chief town of the District. But subordinate to this sovereignty, in the course of the 15th century, arose the various palegars who held tracts of country on feudal tenure. The most considerable of these were the chiefs of Chitaldroog and Ni\u1e0dugal.\n\nChitaldroog.\u2014The Chitaldroog family were of the Beda or Boya\ncaste, corresponding with the Kir\u00e1tas of Sanskrit writers. Hunters and mountaineers, as the names indicate, they belonged to one of the hill tribes who subsisted by hunting and tending cattle. The accounts of their origin are somewhat confused, but it appears that three families emigrated from Jadikal-durga, in the neighbourhood of the shrine of Tirupati, and settled at Nirutadi near Bharmas\u00e1gar about 1475. The son and grandson of one of the leaders, named respectively Hire Hanumappa N\u00e1yak and Timmana N\u00e1yak, afterwards took up their residence at Matti in Hadadi hobli, D\u00e1vangere taluq. The latter, called K\u00e1mag\u00e9ti Tinmana N\u00e1yak, was appointed in 1508, by the Vijayanagar king, as N\u00e1yak of Holalkere, and afterwards to the same office in Hiriy\u00far and eventually in Chitaldroog. The hill at this place he fortified, and so conducted himself that a force was sent against him.\n\nOn this occasion Timmana N\u00e1yak distinguished himself as the hero of a most extraordinary adventure. Stealing into the camp at night, with the intention of carrying off the horse of S\u00e1lava Narasinga R\u00e1ya, the prince who commanded, he accidentally roused the groom. Hastily hiding among the litter, he lay quiet to escape observation, when the groom, driving in afresh the peg for the heel ropes, as luck would have it sent it right through the hand of the concealed chief. The latter bore the pain without moving, and when all was again still, releasing himself by cutting off the hand which was pinned to the ground, he succeeded in carrying off the horse in triumph. This unexampled proof of fortitude, while it attached to him more closely his immediate followers, showed the besieging army that no intimidation would be effectual with such an opponent. A peace was therefore, it is said, concluded, and Timmana N\u00e1yak invited to Vijayanagar, the sovereign of which expressed the greatest admiration of his courageous exploit. After successfully aiding the royal troops in an expedition against Kulburga, he visited the capital and was rewarded with many honours. At a later period he incurred the royal displeasure and was imprisoned at Vijayanagar, where he died.\n\nAccording to another account, Timmana N\u00e1yak came with a small body of armed men from a place called Madak\u00e9ri below the Ghats, 10 gun distant from Tirupati, and entered the service of the palegar of Basvapatna. Some quarrel arose about a mistress that Timmana N\u00e1yak kept at Matti, and he took refuge at M\u00e2yakonda, whence, on being pursued, he escaped to the jungle at Guntanur. Collecting a band, he commenced plundering on every side, and erected a small fort called Rangapatna near Hale\u00fdur. The neighbouring palegars of Harpanhalli, Nidugal, and Basvapatna, being much annoyed by his depredations, united against him and with the aid of some troops from Vijayanagar marched upon Rangapatna. Timmana N\u00e1yak was then forced to retire to Chitaldroog, where he was closely besieged, when the incident related in the text occurred and led to his formal recognition as one of the chiefs dependent on Vijayanagar.\nHis son, Obana Nayak, was in the next reign appointed Nayak of Chitaldroog. He took the name of Madakeri Nayak, and on the fall of Vijayanagar in 1564 assumed independence. In 1602 he was succeeded by his son Kasturi Rangappa Nayak, during whose warlike reign the possession of Mayakonda, Sante Bennur, Holalkere, Anaji, Jagalur and other places was contested in several battles with the Basvapatna palegar, and they remained as parts of the Chitaldroog territory. At the chief's death in 1652 his possessions yielded a revenue of 65,000 Durgi pagodas. Madakeri Nayak, his son, was next installed, and ruled till 1674. He extended the dominions, principally eastwards, until they yielded 100,000 Durgi pagodas.\n\nAn adopted son named Obana Nayak next succeeded, but after a few months was put to death by the dalavayis, who were dissatisfied with his management. His son Surakanta Rangappa then took the government, but on refusing to the troops the customary gratuities on the accession of a new master, they mutinied and killed him. Chikkanna Nayak, a younger brother of Madakeri Nayak, was next invited to the throne and installed in 1676. After forcing the Harpanhalli chief to raise the siege of Anaji, he was under the necessity of defending Harihar against the Muhammadans. This he effected by the following stratagem. Causing, on the approach of night, lights to be fixed to the branches of the trees and horns of the cattle at his encampment near the Batli hill, and the musicians to play as usual on their instruments as if the army were still there, he marched with nearly the whole force by a circuitous route and threw himself into the fort from the west, and thus drove off the besiegers. He formed alliances by marriage with the Rayadurga and Basvapatna chiefs, and died in 1686. His brother Madakeri Nayak succeeded, but was imprisoned by the dalavayis, who set up Rangappa.\n\nBut in 1689 Kumara Barmappa Nayak assumed the government and reigned till 1721. He was principally remarkable for the extent of his benefactions and the number of his children. It was during this period that the Mughals overran the Carnatic possessions of Bijapur and established their government at Sira, of which province Basvapatna and Budihal were made parganas, and to which Chitaldroog and the other neighbouring estates of palegars became tributary.\n\nHis son Madakeri Nayak, who came next, was engaged in continual hostilities against Harpanhalli, Savanur, Bednur, and the Mahrattas under Siddoji or Hindu Rao, the father of Morari Rao. He was generally successful in his engagements and annexed a large tract of country on the north-east, extending beyond Molkalmuru, conquered from Raydurga. In 1748 he secured the alliance of Chanda Sahib,\nwho, released from prison at Sattara through the designs of Mons. Dupleix, was marching south. But in the battle of M\u00e1yakonda, the Chitaldroog army encountered with disastrous result that of Bedn\u00far, which was assisted by the confederate forces of R\u00e1ydurga, Harpanhalli and S\u00e1vanur. Madakeri N\u00e1yak was slain, in single combat on elephants, by Somasekhara N\u00e1yak, the Harpanhalli chief; Chanda Sahib\u2019s son fell at his side, and he himself was taken prisoner by the Bedn\u00far troops. But having made known his hopes and designs regarding the Nav\u00e1bship of the Carnatic to the Musalman officers of the latter, they released him and joined his standard.\n\nKast\u00fari Rangappa N\u00e1yak, son of Madakeri, succeeded, and with the aid of Mor\u00e1ri Rao retook M\u00e1yakonda. He made various expeditions to the north and south, in the latter of which he gained some possessions in the Budih\u00e1l country. He at the same time kept up a friendship with the Subadar of Sira, who, it is said, invested him with the titles of Tall\u00e1ri and N\u00e1d-gauda of Sira. He died in 1754 without issue, and Madakeri N\u00e1yak, the son of Barmappa N\u00e1yak, was acknowledged as his successor.\n\nPlaced between the Mahrattas on one side and Haidar Ali on the other, this chief occupied a perilous position. In 1762 he was summoned by the latter, to whom the palegars of R\u00e1ydurga and Harpanhalli had submitted. Madakeri N\u00e1yak procrastinated, on which Haidar overran the whole country with his cavalry, and the chief was forced to compromise by paying a fine of two lakhs of rupees and an annual tribute. At this time, a pretender to the throne of Bedn\u00far, announcing himself as Channa Basavaiya, whom it was supposed had been murdered, had sought protection and assistance from Chitaldroog. Haidar Ali soon saw the use that could be made of him, and in 1763 the united armies of Mysore and Chitaldroog invaded the Bednur country, with the ostensible object of restoring the rightful king. The result of the expedition has been related in the history of the Shimoga District. Haidar, having accomplished his purpose, sent the pretender, called in joke the Ghaib (or resurrection) R\u00e1ja, to Maddagiri (Tumkur District) as a prisoner, along with the Bednur R\u00e1ni.\n\nIn 1777, when Haidar Ali was threatened with a formidable invasion by the allied armies of the Mahrattas and of Nizam Ali, the Chitaldroog palegar having received information which led him to consider that Haidar\u2019s fortune would shortly be reversed, held back from sending the usual contingent of troops to his assistance. Haidar, posted in a strong position at Gutti, found means to avert the danger, and immediately marched upon Chitaldroog to punish it, rejecting the offers of the chief to pay a large fine. The siege was maintained for\nsome months without success, when an arrangement was entered into and a fine of thirteen lakhs of pagodas levied on the chief. But the advance of the Mahrattas forced Haidar to destroy the siege works and hasten to the north-west before the whole was paid, and the palegar, still doubting to which side fortune might incline, evaded the order to accompany the army with his troops. The Mahratta campaign failed, from the mutual jealousy of the leaders and other causes, and Haidar, after a successful career of conquest over all the country between the Tungabhadra and the Krishna, once more sat down indignant before Chitaldroog. But only by the treachery of the Muhammadan officers in the palegar's service was the place at last taken in 1779. Madakeri Nayak, on finding himself betrayed, threw himself on Haidar's mercy. He and his family were sent as prisoners to Seringapatam; while to break up the Bedar population, whose blind devotion to their chief had so prolonged the contest, he removed 20,000 inhabitants to people the island of Seringapatam, and of all the boys of proper age formed regular battalions of captive converts or Chelas, who in following wars were of great service to him.\n\nNidugal.\u2014The founder of the Nidugal family appears to have come from the neighbourhood of Bijapur, and claimed to be a Kshatriya. According to tradition, he was born of a girl of that caste, whose family had settled at Dodderi, Harti, and Sarvad in the Bijapur country. At the age of seven she conceived by the Sun, and her father Timma Raja, to avert disgrace, exposed the infant to which she gave birth on a tippe or dunghill. The child was found by a cowherd named Kamma, who brought him up as his own. After a time the cowherd removed to Kamlapur near Vijayanagar, where there was an enclosure for the exhibition of tiger fights. On one occasion, when the king Krishna Raya was present, a tiger got loose and ran among the cattle, on which the boy killed it with his axe. The king made inquiry regarding a youth of such bold spirit, and on hearing his story took him away from the cowherd, alleging that as a foundling he belonged to the State. At the same time, from the fact of his having been found on a tippe, he gave him the name of Tippana Nayak.\n\nSome time after he defeated a noted champion athlete, who had prevailed against all other opponents at the Court, and put him to death; for which exploit he was granted a tract of country in the east of the Chitaldroog District, to be cleared of jungle and formed into an estate. Settling at Machisamudra, Gosikere, and Challakere, he built Dodderi and Harti, naming them after the towns of his ancestors; and took possession of the country extending from Chitaldroog to Pavugada, and from Molkalmuru to Sira. At his death, which must have happened\nin the latter half of the 16th century, he divided his territory among his seven sons.\n\nOn the invasion of the country by the Bijapur army the descendants of these were driven from their respective possessions, and Timmana Nayak, who had lost Dodderi, retired to the hill of Nidugal, which he fortified; and there the family long remained, paying to Sira a tribute of 3,000 pagodas. On the capture of Sira by Haidar Ali in 1761, the Nidugal chief, also called Timmana Nayak, submitted to the conqueror, who imposed on him a tribute of 7,000 pagodas and the supply of 300 men. Subsequently, while accompanying Tipu Sultan in the expedition against Mangalore, he fell ill; and when at the point of death was compelled to sign a letter relinquishing his territory and ordering his son Hottana Nayak to deliver it up to the governor of Chitadroog. Possession was at once taken, and Hottana Nayak, with his brother, were sent as prisoners to Chitadroog and thence to Srirangapatam, where they were put to death when the British army ascended the Ghats.\n\nMysore Raj.\u2014On the overthrow of the Muhammadan government and the formation of the present kingdom of Mysore, the Chitadroog country was included in it, and formed the Chitrakal Rayada, Subayana or Faujdari. The west and south suffered during the insurrection of 1830. Under the subsequent British management, the Chitadroog Division included the Chitadroog and Tumkur Districts, with headquarters at Tumkur. In 1863 that Division was broken up, by joining the Chitadroog District to the Nagar Division, and the Tumkur District to the Nundydroog Division. In 1879 the Divisions were abolished, and in 1882 Chitadroog was reduced to a Sub-Division under Tumkur District. In 1886 the Chitadroog District was re-established, but Pavugada taluq remained a part of Tumkur District.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nNumber.\u2014The population of the District by the census of 1891 consists of 209,590 males and 209,394 females, or altogether 413,984 persons.\n\nDensity.\u2014It will thus be seen that there are 102.92 persons to a square mile\u2014a comparatively low rate, due to the extent of the District and the barrenness of a considerable portion of it. The Davangere taluq was the most thickly peopled when the census was taken, the ratio being 162.41 persons per square mile, followed by Chitadroog\ntaluq, with 125\u00b772, and Jagalur taluq, with 103\u00b704. The scantiest population was in Hiriy\u00far taluq, with only 67\u00b728 per square mile. Challakere taluq had only 76\u00b784, and Molk\u00e1lmuru 83\u00b748.\n\nBy religion.\u2014According to religion the population is thus distributed, adults being shown separately from children:\n\n| Religion       | Above 15 | Under 15 | Total |\n|----------------|----------|----------|-------|\n|                | Male     | Female   | Male  | Female | Total | Per cent. |\n| Hindus         | 123,134  | 118,081  | 76,433| 77,224 | 394,872| 95\u00b738    |\n| Muhammadans    | 5,668    | 4,972    | 3,803 | 3,739  | 18,182 | 4\u00b739     |\n| Jains          | 266      | 172      | 117   | 84     | 639    | 0\u00b715     |\n| Christians     | 117      | 69       | 49    | 49     | 284    | 0\u00b706     |\n| Others(6 Parsis, 1 Jew) | 3        | 3        | \u2014     | 1      | .7     | \u2014        |\n| Total          | 129,188  | 123,297  | 80,402| 81,097 | 413,984| \u2014        |\n\nIncrease.\u2014The following figures compare the estimates of population in the kh\u00e1neshum\u00e1ri accounts of 1853-4, with the numbers recorded in the census periods of 1871, 1881, and 1891:\n\n| Taluq          | 1853-4 | 1871 | 1881 | 1891 |\n|----------------|--------|------|------|------|\n| Challakere     | 22,144 | 57,187| 45,747| 60,711|\n| Chitaldroog    | 34,720 | 75,442| 50,834| 66,546|\n| D\u00e1vangere      | 60,823 | 94,006| 72,749| 94,565|\n| Hiriy\u00far        | 30,785 | 61,866| 40,163| 54,302|\n| Holalkere      | 33,493 | 78,336| 47,249| 67,051|\n| Jagalur        | 26,710 | 40,311| 28,437| 38,229|\n| Molak\u00e1lmuru    | 22,133 | 28,405| 25,332| 32,560|\n| Total          | 230,808 | 435,553| 310,511| 413,964|\n\nSome of the differences are due to redistribution of taluqs and to changes in the limits of the District. There was an apparent increase in the first 18 years up to 1871 of 88\u00b797 per cent., and even allowing 25 per cent. of defective enumeration in the early estimate, as was shown to be required at the actual census, there still remains the high rate of 63\u00b797 per cent., an eloquent testimony to the security and prosperity of the District. But the great famine of 1877-8 fell with severity upon Chitaldroog, and the population went down 28\u00b77 per cent. by 1881. It has since again risen 33\u00b731 per cent. in the 10 years to 1891, indicating considerable elasticity in the population. The net result may be stated at an increase on the whole of 43\u00b749 per cent. in 38 years.\nClasses.\u2014Classified according to occupation and nationality, the population is composed of the following divisions:\n\n| Class                          | No.   | Per cent. |\n|--------------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| A.

Some have been turned out to the value of Rs. 200 and Rs. 300, of so fine a texture that they could be rolled up into a hollow bamboo, and were considered impervious to water. But the price of the more expensive kinds usually made, the wool being taken from the first shearing of the sheep, varies from Rs. 25 to Rs. 40. Coarser descriptions, costing from R. 1 to Rs. 12 each, are made in Chitaldroog, Challakere, and more or less in all the other taluqs.

The ore is first melted and the metal procured in balls or lumps: these are afterwards hammered into bars or pigs for use, or converted into steel as required. The iron articles manufactured are tools and implements of various kinds for agricultural and industrial purposes. From steel are made swords, daggers, knives, &c. Brass vessels and utensils are made north of Molk\u00e1lmuru by Panch\u00e1l\u00e1s, varying in price from 8 annas to Rs. 60. Similar articles, as well as lamps, are made in Hosdurga taluq.\nGlass.\u2014The manufacture of bangles or coloured glass bracelets, so largely worn by native women, is carried on at Mattod.\n\nOf other manufactures, that of paper was formerly an important branch, especially in Challakere taluq, the size of the paper made in which was the standard of a measure called the Dodderi gaz or yard.

The surface of the taluq is comparatively flat, with a few rocky ridges or bare hills. Date groves occur in some parts, and groups of b\u00e1bul in the beds of tanks and along the river. Except for these, the taluq generally presents a bleak and barren appearance. No less than 104 square miles are occupied by Amrit Mahal k\u00e1vals.\n\nThe soil is mostly red and sandy, but in the south-west corner there is some good black soil. The surface of the ground is often covered with loose stones, solid rock constantly crops up, and enormous boulders are found even in cultivated fields. In many villages the soil is impregnated with saline matter, which causes a white efflorescence on the surface. This soil is cultivated, but produces very poor crops. The tanks are numerous, but few are of the first class. Wells are more relied upon, many of which are formed from talpargis or spring heads. Great attention is paid to the cultivation of rice and other irrigated cereals, as well as to the cocoa-nut and areca-nut gardens, but dry crop cultivation is carried on in a slovenly and careless manner. Sajje and saje are the principal dry crops, but castor-oil, horse gram, r\u00e4gi, and javari are also grown. The two latter, however, as well as wheat, navane and tobacco, are almost always raised in irrigated lands. Cotton is grown in small quantities, chiefly in the black soil.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1872. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\u2014\nCulturable (dry, 251,169; wet, 4,934; garden, 9,434) ... ... 265,537\nUnculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... ... 102,205\n3 Inam villages (5,760); 22 Amrit Mah\u00e1l k\u00e1v\u00e1ls (66,560) ... ... 72,320\n\nTotal acres ... ... 440,062\n\nThe unoccupied arable area was 151,299 acres, 148,061 of it being dry crop land. Of the present taluq 153,480 acres are cultivated, and 192,335 uncultivable. The land revenue for 1891-2 (15 months), was Rs. 93,852, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 98,347.\n\nThe average rainfall at Challakere for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other stations for 3 years (1893-5), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|------|\n| Challakere | 0'02 | 0'23 | 0'84 | 3'28 | 1'21 | 1'23 | 1'75 | 3'91 | 2'45 | 2'36 | 0'09 | ... 17'37 |\n| N\u00e1yakanha\u1e6d\u1e6di | 0'13 | 0'08 | 1'34 | 1'65 | 1'48 | 0'56 | 1'08 | 1'52 | 3'92 | 1'62 | \u2014 | ... 13'38 |\n| Talak | ... | \u2014 | 0'13 | 1'75 | 1'28 | 1'91 | 1'04 | 0'73 | 4'88 | 5'38 | 0'85 | \u2014 | ... 17'95 |\n\nAnother register for 23 years makes the annual average at Challakere 18'50 inches.\n\nThe Bangalore-Bellary high road runs through the taluq from south to north, being met at Challakere by a road from Chitaldroog. There are also roads from Challakere north-west to N\u00e1yakanha\u1e6d\u1e6di and east to Pavugada.\n\n**Challakere or Chellakere.**\u2014Head-quarters of the Challakere taluq, situated in 14\u00b0 18' N. lat., 76\u00b0 43' E. long., on the Bangalore-Bellary road, 18 miles east-north east of Chitaldroog, with which it is connected by a road.

Towards the north the range is narrow and the hills bare and insignificant, but south of Chitaldroog it spreads out into greater width and the hills are loftier and peculiarly striking in appearance. The country to the east and west of the above range is comparatively flat and free from jungle. To the east black soil preponderates, while to the west the country for the most part is composed of red soil.\n\nThe western half has a better water supply than the eastern. In it is situated the large Bhimasamudra tank, about $3\\frac{1}{2}$ miles in length by 2 in breadth. Dry crops are cultivated principally on the eastern side of the taluq, and consist of jola, cotton, navane, gram, &c. The crops of the western side are jola, r\u0101gi, togari, &c., the r\u0101gi being frequently sown in garden and rice lands. The kind of rice cultivated is sal bhatta, which requires little water and thrives upon the rainfall alone, though generally planted near a tank or nullah in case of need.\n\nChitaldroog was once remarkable for the manufacture of silk and cloths of good description, but at present kamblis and cotton cloths are alone woven in that town, and in Turavanur and Siddavvanhalli, where also dyers in red carry on their trade. The caste called Reddis are very numerous in the eastern parts of the taluq, so much so that it is often spoken of as the Reddi country.\nThe east and north of the taluq are included in an auriferous tract, in which land has been taken up for gold-mining.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1867. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\n- Culturable (dry, 190,011; wet, 6,200; garden, 3,070) ... ... 199,281\n- Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) ... ... 106,872\n\nTotal acres ... 306,153\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 62,447 acres, mostly dry crop land. Of the present taluq 159,384 acres are cultivated, and 113,226 uncultivable.\n\nThe land revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 1,02,167, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,05,567.\n\nThe average rainfall for 26 years (1870-95) at Chitaldroog, and for 3 years (1893-5) at the other station was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apl. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Chitaldroog | 0.19 | 0.03 | 0.33 | 1.41 | 3.43 | 2.57 | 2.68 | 2.89 | 3.61 | 4.98 | 2.34 | 0.39 | 24.83 |\n| Vijapur | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 16.13 |\n\nThe high road from Hiriyur to Harihar runs through the taluq from south east to north-west, and is crossed at Chitaldroog by a road from the Holalkere railway station in the south-west to Challakere in the north-east. There is also a road from Vijapur to Jagalur and the frontier northwards.\n\n**Chitaldroog.**\u2014The chief town of the District, situated in 14\u00b0 14' N. lat., 76\u00b0 27' E. long., 24 miles from the Holalkere railway station, and on the Bangalore-Harihar road, 126 miles north-west of Bangalore.

The history of the place has already been related in connection with that of the District. There are many inscriptions on the hill, of the Ch\u00e1lukyas, the Hoysalas, and the Vijayanagar kings, dating from the 11th to the 15th century. Its name\nat that time was Bemmattanakalla or Bemmattan\u016bru. According to legend a giant named Hi\u1e0dimb\u0101sura was here slain by Vrik\u014ddara or Bhima, one of the P\u0101ndus. The present name of the place is derived either from Sit\u0101l\u0101- or Chitrakal-durg\u0101, meaning spotted or picturesque castle, or Chatrakal, umbrella rock, the umbrella being the ensign of royalty. To the south-west is a striking lofty hill of this form, considered sacred by both Hindus and Musalmans. At the top is a pillar and shrine of Dhavalappa or Siddesvara. The Muhammadans call it the tomb of Saad-ulla. There is also another hill south of Chitaldroog, with a shrine at the summit dedicated to Obala-devi, and held specially sacred by the Bedas.\n\nThe mahal or palace in the inner fort, erected by Tipu Sultan, with a fine fruit garden attached, is used as the cutcherry. Before it stands an immense trough for watering elephants, which was found on the hill, formed out of a single stone. In the town, water is laid on to all the streets from the Timmanhalli tank, a short distance to the south. The principal temple is one of two storeys, dedicated to Uchchangi-amma. The extensive fortifications, batteries and works of masonry forming the m\u00e9ldurga or upper hill-fort, which includes 14 temples, present many points of interest. The remains of the fort and palace of the palegars, which were of mud, are still to be seen, with the site of a pleasure garden. The formidable stone fortress, as it now is, was erected under Haidar and Tipu, by whom also were constructed the immense granaries and pits for storing oil and ghee. Chitaldroog was for some years garrisoned by British troops, but given up on account of its unhealthiness.\n\nBesides the usual Distriet offices, which are beyond the fort walls, 3 miles to the north-west is situated the Murgi math, the residence of the chief guru of the Sivabhaktas or Lingayits. It is a large and well-built edifice. In one part is an ingenious water wheel. The name of the math is said to be derived from mitru-gi, the three gi-s, namely y\u014dgi, j\u014dgi and bh\u014dgi. There is a fine math belonging to the guru on the hill, but it is deserted owing to his inability, on account of the opposition of other sects in the town, to visit it with all the insignia of his authority, one of which is a lighted torch by day.\n\nTo the west, among a wildly rugged and picturesque group of hills, is the Ankli math, of recent establishment. There is here a curious long series of subterranean chambers, now regularly built round with masonry and thickly covered with plaster. They are entered by a good stone staircase, which leads down to rooms of various sizes at different levels. In them are shrines, lingas, baths and pedestals, apparently for j\u014dg\u0101sana. The style of their present architecture may be from 300 to 500 years old, but the caverns no\ndoubt existed long before. When and for what purpose they were originally formed or occupied is unknown. When the Ankli ma\u1e6dha was first established, about 40 years ago, they were found deserted, and the entrance choked up with a thick growth of bushes. They are now merely used for storing things in. At the Panchalinga cave, near the entrance, is an inscription of 1286, in the reign of the Hoysala king N\u0101rasimha III, recording a grant by his minister Perum\u0101le.\n\nIn this quarter, immediately to the west of Chitaldroog, are traces of an ancient city, consisting of very large-sized bricks, and remains of pottery. Coins are frequently found after heavy rains. In 1888 a large find was made of Buddhist leaden coins, one of which bore the name of the Andhra or S\u2019\u0101tv\u0101hana king Pulum\u0101yi, of the 2nd century. According to tradition the city was called Chandr\u0101vali, and extended as far as the four points, N\u0101ralgundi, B\u0101ralgundi, Huligundi and Basavan-gundi. Huligundi is to the north of the Ankli ma\u1e6dha, and Basavan-gundi is to the north-west of the Cholagatta hill, near G\u0101rihatti village.\n\nAbout three miles south of Chitaldroog is the Jogi ma\u1e6d\u1e6di or mar\u0101di, one of the highest points in the District, being 3,803 feet above the level of the sea. It is surrounded with hills and is overgrown with bamboo, stunted teak and other trees. A road has been made to it and a plantation commenced. It is a convenient resort during the intense heat of the hot months.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 4,785   | 4,755   | 7,005   | 7,954   |\n| Expenditure      | 5,184   | 7,331   | 4,223   | 7,652   |\n\nDavangere.\u2014A taluq in the north-west, including Harihar sub-taluq.

The south-west is bounded by the chain of hills trending the right bank of the Bhadra and Tungabhadra from Ajjampur north-west to the frontier. Except where a low range of hills crosses the taluq from the east of M\u00e1yakonda to the east of Anaji, it consists of a wide unbroken level plain, sloping down to Harihar and the river in the north-west, upon which the insignificant B\u00e1ti hill makes a conspicuous figure, while Uchchangi durga, beyond the border, looms formidably upon the north-east horizon.\n\nBlack soil prevails in the west, and stony or gravelly soil in the east; but these are often intermixed, together with patches of red. The chief crops cultivated are jola, cotton, and r\u00e1gi, of which the ryots use the former principally for food. Rice and sugar-cane are grown to a small extent only under tanks.\n\nThe taluq is noted for the manufacture of kamblis, of which some of the finest texture are valued as high as from Rs. 200 to Rs. 300. Coarse cotton cloths are largely woven in the villages. More than half the population consists of Sivabhaktas or Lingayits.\n\nThis country was probably owned by the Kadambas at the beginning of the Christian era. It afterwards formed part of the province of Nonambav\u00e1di under the Ch\u00e1lukya and Hoysala kings, the seat of government being at Uchchangi-durga. The Y\u00e1davas of Devagiri held it for some years, making Bettur the chief town. It then fell a prey to the Muhammadan incursions by which the Hoysala dominion was overthrown, but on the rise of the Vijayanagar empire was enriched by its kings, from Harihara R\u00e1ya downwards. On the downfall of that State the principal places in the taluq were seized by the chiefs of Bednur and Tarikere, until taken, some by the Nav\u00e1b of S\u00e1vanur, and some by the palegar of Chitaldroog, who in their turn were forced to yield them to Haidar Ali; since when, with occasional possession by the Mahrattas in the latter part of last century, they have remained attached to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced into the old Harihar taluq in 1865, and into D\u00e1vangere taluq in 1866.

The Bangalore-Harihar high road passes by Anagod and D\u00e1vangere, while from Harihar there is a road south-westwards to Shimoga via Male Benn\u00far. From D\u00e1vangere there are roads south to Hadacli and east to Anaji. From A'nag\u00f3d there is a road south to the railway and to Holalkere, and one north to Anaji.\n\n**D\u00e1vangere.**\u2014One of the most important seats of trade in the Province, situated in 14\u00b0 28' N. lat., 75\u00b0 59' E. long., on the Bangalore-Poona railway and the Bangalore-Harihar road, 38 miles north-west of Chitaldroog.

Haidar Ali gave it as a j\u00e1gir to a Mahratta chief named Apoji R\u00e1m, who encouraged merchants to settle there. He died without heirs, but the place continued to increase under the\nencouragements given by Tipu Sultan, and it is now the most populous town in the Chitaldroog District. The merchants are principally Sivabhaktas or Lingayits. The increase in population, especially since the advent of the railway, has made it necessary to extend the town to the east.\n\nThe most valuable trade here is that which is carried on with Wallajapet in North Arcot on the one side, and Nagar and Saggar on the other. Areca-nut and pepper, the produce of the latter, are sent to the former; and Madras goods imported from Europe, China, Bengal, and the eastern islands, together with salt, obtained in return; which, as well as kamblis made in the neighbourhood, are transmitted to Nagar and Saggar. There is also a large trade in cotton, and a cotton ginning factory has been established by Messrs. Binny & Co. of Madras. Agents of Bombay houses are stationed here for the purchase of oil-seeds, &c.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          |        |        |        |        |\n| Expenditure     |        |        |        |        |\n\nDodderi.\u2014A village in Challakere taluq, 4 miles east of the kasba. Population 1,001.\n\nIt was founded by the progenitor of the Nidugal family of chiefs (see p. 463 above), and it was here that Khasim Khan, the Mughal governor of Sira, being surprised while conveying a large treasure, by a Mahratta force under Danoji Ghorpada, assisted by the palegar of Chitaldroog, appears to have committed suicide to avoid disgrace. His body was afterwards taken to Sira and buried there. From this time Dodderi remained in the possession of the Chitaldroog chief until it was taken by Haidar Ali. Down to 1882 it gave its name to the taluq now called Challakere, and was long the head-quarters. It was once celebrated for its paper manufacture, and the size of the sheets regulated the Dodderi gaz or yard, which was a standard measure of length.\n\nHaggari.\u2014The principal stream of this name, sometimes called Hire Haggari by way of distinction, is also known as the V\u00e9davati, and is described under that designation. But there are in this District a Haggari and a Chinna Haggari besides. For a description of the latter see Janaga-halla.\n\nThe remaining stream is formed by the outflow of the Anaji tank, whence running northwards, almost along the boundary, it continues in the same direction through the Bellary country to the Tungabhadra.\nHarihar.\u2014A sub-taluq under D\u00e1vangere taluq, comprising the Harihar and Male Bennur hoblis.\n\nHarihar.\u2014An ancient town, situated in $14^\\circ 31'$ N. lat., $75^\\circ 51'$ E. long., on the right bank of the Tungabhadra, at the Mysore and Dharwar frontier. Till 1875 it was the head-quarters of a taluq bearing the same name, now united to D\u00e1vangere, from which it is 9 miles west. It is a railway station and a municipality.\n\n| Population in 1891 | Males | Females | Total |\n|-------------------|-------|---------|-------|\n| Hindus            |       |         |       |\n| Muhammadans       | 2,384 | 2,487   | 4,871 |\n| Jains             | 712   | 715     | 1,427 |\n| Christians (with 1 Jew) | 19    | 5       | 24    |\n| Parsis            | 39    | 18      | 57    |\n| Total             | 2      | 4       | 6     |\n\nAccording to legend this spot was the capital or stronghold of a giant named Guha or Guh\u00e1sura, whose extent was such that its eastern gate was at Uchchangi-durga, the southern at Govinah\u00e1lu, the western at Mudanur, and the northern at Airani. The giant, having by his penance obtained from Brahma the boon of exemption from death at the hands either of Hari (Vishnu) or of Hara (Siva), became in consequence such a tormentor of gods and men that Vishnu and Siva, in order to counteract the spell, combined into one form of Harihara and destroyed him. The descent of this incarnation was at Kudalur, the confluence of the Tungabhadra and the Haridra, where its footprints are still pointed out. The expiring giant prayed that the place might be named after him, whence it was called Guh\u00e1ranya ksh\u00e9tra.\n\nThere are numerous inscriptions around the great temple, the earliest of which (passing over one on copper of the 7th century, which refers to another part) are dated in the 12th century. In the time of the Ch\u00e1lukya kings Harihara appears to have been an ancient agrah\u00e1ra, possessed by 104 Brahmans, and included in the province of Nonambav\u00e1\u1e0di, administered by governors bearing the name of P\u00e1\u1e47\u1e0dya. The present highly ornate temple of Hariharesvara, was erected in 1223 by Pol\u00e1lva, a general and minister of the Hoysala king Narasimha II, and some additions were made in 1268 by Soma, the general under a subsequent king of the same name and dynasty, and the founder of Soman\u00e1thpur (Mysore District) with its splendid temple. In 1277 S\u00e1lava Tikkama, commander of the forces of the Devagiri king R\u00e1machandra, appears as erecting a temple to Mahadeva, in honour of the preceding king so named. Many benefactions were bestowed down to\nthe 16th century by the Vijayanagar kings, one of the founders of which line, Hakka, assumed the name of Harihara R\u00e1ya.\n\nAfter the fall of Vijayanagar the place was seized by the Tarikere chiefs, who erected the fort. From them it was taken by the Nav\u00e1b of S\u00e1vanur, who granted it in j\u00e1gir to Shir Khan. While in possession of the Muhammadans the temple was left intact, but the roof was used for a mosque, a small Saracenic doorway being made into the tower for the pulpit. Harihara was subsequently sold to the chiefs of Bednur, for, it is said, a lakh of rupees. The Mahrattas next held possession, until it was subdued by Haidar Ali in 1763. Since that time it has been thrice taken by the Mahrattas.\n\nUntil 1865 a native regiment was stationed in the cantonment two miles north-west of Harihar. In 1868 was completed the splendid bridge across the Tungabhadra, over which runs the trunk road from Bangalore to Dharwar. It is of stone and brick, built in 14 elliptical arches of 60 feet span, and cost nearly $3\\frac{1}{2}$ lakhs of rupees. There is also now a separate bridge over the river for the railway.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 2,545   | 2,978   | 4,440   | 4,309   |\n| Expenditure      | 3,670   | 6,190   | 4,487   | 4,582   |\n\n**Hiri\u00fdur.**\u2014A taluq in the south-east.

Making its way through the gaps in these hills, with a course nearly at right angles to their general direction, the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati flows north-east across the centre of the taluq to some distance beyond Hiriy\u00far, where it turns north.\n\nThe south-western hoblis are peculiarly barren in appearance. They consist chiefly of large masses of hills, scantily clothed with jungle and generally capped with black rock. No gardens or tanks relieve the harshness of the landscape. Everywhere, to the very fields, stones cover the ground; pure soil is rarely met with, and then only at the very lowest parts of the valleys. But the rocks in this part are reported to be auriferous, connected with the Chikn\u00e1yakanhalli band. If the reefs should prove to be of sufficient value for mining, the aspect of the country might soon undergo a great change. In the north-west, Ayangala is a flat and stony country, but contains a large quantity of black soil. For the remainder of the taluq, an abrupt and decided line, almost identical with the course of the high road from Hiriy\u00far to Bangalore, separates black soil from red. All to the north is flat and composed chiefly of black soil; whilst to the south the country is at first stony and broken, and then hilly and composed of red soil.\n\nIn the black soils jola and cotton are the principal productions, but wheat and Bengal gram are grown in soil silted up behind embankments made for that purpose. In the red soil r\u00e1gi and avare are the chief crops, but togari, castor-oil and horse gram are also grown. The garden cultivation is very inferior, and some rice is grown under tanks.\n\nThe contact of water alone seems required to quicken the fertility of the dreary and barren tracts in much of this taluq, so much so that a single good season of rain enriches the ryots with comparatively little labour. The construction of a dam across the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati near Barmagiri at the M\u00e1ri Kanive, the last of the narrow gorges through which it passes the hills, has been long proposed, as a means of providing irrigation for this rainless land which would convert it into an expanse of rice-fields. But there appears to be some uncertainty as to the data on which such a scheme must be based, and the project is from time to time postponed. Another similar project is the Kumbar-katte.\n\nThough cultivation is wanting, manufacture is busy in the Mattod hobli and the neighbourhood of the hills. Iron is smelted at Arsingundi, Chikka By\u00e1ldakere and other villages. At the latter there is an extensive manufacture of shoes for bullocks and horses. At Mattod are glass works, formerly very extensive. The principal article made is bangles or glass bracelets for women.\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1868 and 1869. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\nCulturable (dry, 314,036; wet, 3,724; garden, 8,076) ... ... 325,836\nUnculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) ... ... 358,264\n\nTotal acres ... 684,100\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 146,423 acres. The total land revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 61,521, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 64,900.\n\nThe average rainfall at Hiriyur for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other station for 3 years (1893-5), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Hiriyur | 0\u00b710 | 0\u00b706 | 0\u00b714 | 0\u00b792 | 2\u00b778 | 1\u00b780 | 1\u00b725 | 1\u00b721 | 2\u00b795 | 3\u00b781 | 1\u00b739 | 0\u00b737 | 16\u00b778 |\n| Varaballi | \u2014 | 0\u00b770 | 0\u00b759 | 1\u00b793 | 2\u00b709 | 2\u00b726 | 0\u00b739 | 0\u00b738 | 1\u00b783 | 5\u00b703 | 1\u00b767 | \u2014 | 16\u00b787 |\n\nAnother register for 21 years makes the annual average at Hiriyur 17\u00b715 inches.\n\nThe high road from Bangalore branches at Hiriyur to Bellary northwards and to Chitaldroog north-west. There is also a road connecting Hiriyur with Huliyar, and another connecting it with Hosdurga, with a branch from Barmagiri to the Mari Kanive.\n\n**Hiriyur.**\u2014A town situated in 13\u00b0 57' N. lat., 76\u00b0 40' E. long., on the right bank of the V\u00e9davati, at the bifurcation of the Bangalore high road to Bellary and to Chitaldroog.

The family of the founder continued in possession for three generations, under Naula Allapu Nayak, Konchappa Nayak, who built the big temple, and Rangappa Nayak. During this time settlers were encouraged to take up their residence in the town, and it reached a prosperous condition. It was then taken, first by the Bijapur army and afterwards by the palegar of Chitaldroog, whose ancestor, before coming to power, had held the office of Nayak of Hiriyur under the\nVijayanagar kings. In 1762 it was captured by Haidar Ali, and suffered very severely during the subsequent contests of that ruler and the Mahrattas, whose devastations brought on a famine which swept off all the inhabitants.\n\nIts unhealthy condition led to an attempt in recent times to remove the town to a higher site on the other side of the river, where the taluq offices have been built; but the people, as usual, are loath to leave the neighbourhood of the ancient temples, one of which, dedicated to T\u00e1ra Mall\u00e9svara, has a lofty tower erected by the Chitaldroog palegar. East of the old town the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati is bridged for the high road.\n\n| Municipal Funds. | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income           | 760     | 755     | 773     | 1,116   |\n| Expenditure      | 988     | 774     | 785     | 1,008   |\n\nHolalkere.\u2014A taluq in the south-west, till 1882 called Hosdurga, which was then made a sub-taluq under it.

The north is also occupied by hills, and there is a group on the west covered with low jungle. The rest of the taluq is comparatively flat, with a preponderance of red soil, but good black soil occurs near Andnur and R\u00e1magiri. The good and bad soils are very intimately interspersed throughout the taluq. Long stretches of good grazing exist in different parts, but especially in the\ncentre. The country is intersected by many fair-sized n\u00e1las, and the Ved\u00e1vati runs in a direction from south-west to north-east across the southern extremity.\n\nThe most common dry crops are jola and r\u00e1gi. Cotton is grown, but to no extent. Iron is worked in the Gund\u00e9ri hobli, and in Hosdurga there are a good many workers in brass.\n\nThe oldest inscriptions in the taluq are R\u00e1shtr\u00e1k\u00fa\u1e6da, of the 10th century, and show this part of the country as being then attached to the government of the Kadambalige Thousand n\u00e1\u1e0d, which I have not been able to identify. The Ch\u00e1lukyas, the Hoysalas, and the Vijayanagar kings succeeded in turn. Under the two first the two great provinces of the Nonambav\u00e1\u1e0di 32,000 and the Gangav\u00e1\u1e0di 96,000 are constantly mentioned, and there is reason to believe that their boundaries met somewhere near R\u00e1magiri.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1868.

The total land revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 97,228, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 1,01,067.\n\nThe average rainfall at Holalkere and Hosdurga for 26 years (1870-95), and at the other stations for 3 years (1893-5), was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | April | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year |\n|------|------|------|-------|-----|------|------|------|-------|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Holalkere | 0'01 | 0'18 | 1'28 | 2'65 | 2'18 | 3'54 | 3'27 | 4'64 | 4'09 | 3'61 | 0'15 | ... | 25'60 |\n| Hosdurga | 0'06 | 0'06 | 0'21 | 1'51 | 3'41 | 2'45 | 2'50 | 1'58 | 2'93 | 4'58 | 2'87 | 0'31 | ... | 22'47 |\n| Dhumi | \u2014 | \u2014 | 0'52 | 0'57 | 1'63 | 5'26 | 6'34 | 4'04 | 1'13 | 3'48 | 0'70 | \u2014 | ... | 23'67 |\n| R\u00e1magiri | \u2014 | \u2014 | 1'49 | 1'74 | 1'96 | 3'84 | 2'02 | 2'42 | 1'42 | 4'77 | 1'05 | \u2014 | ... | 20'71 |\n\nOther registers make the average for 22 years at Holalkere 23'92, for 12 years at Hosdurga 22'24, and for 2 years at the two other places 25'99 and (?) 12'39.\n\nThe Southern Mahratta railway from Bangalore to Poona runs throughout the west of the taluq, from south to north, with stations at Bidarkere or Hosdurga Road, R\u00e1magiri, Holalkere, Chik J\u00e1j\u00far, and S\u00e1salu. There is a road from Channagiri through Holalkere to Chitadroog, with one from Huliyar through Hosdurga to D\u00e1vangere, most of it close to the railway line. There are roads from Hosdurga to\nthe railway at Bidarkere, to Ajjampur and to Hiriy\u00far.

The present town seems to have been founded in the 14th century, by a Boya gauda, under the protection of the Dhumi chief Do\u00e7dan\u00f1a N\u00e1yak. In course of time it fell into the hands of the palegars of Basvapatna; and in 1475, Timmanna N\u00e1yak, the progenitor of the Chitaldroog family, obtained from Vijayanagar his first appointment as N\u00e1yak of Holalkere. It remained in possession of the Chitaldroog family till taken by Haidar Ali, and suffered, in common with all the neighbouring parts, from repeated Mahratta invasions.\n\nIts situation on the high road, near the foot of the pass which leads to Chitaldroog, and a large weekly fair combined to make it a thriving town, and its prosperity has been promoted by the advent of the railway and the location here of the taluq head-quarters.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3. | 1893-4. | 1894-5. | 1895-6. |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Income          | 887     | 955     | 964     | 1,593   |\n| Expenditure     | 1,151   | 1,020   | 1,189   | 1,539   |\n\n**Hosdurga.**\u2014A sub-taluq under Holalkere taluq, composed of the Hosdurga and B\u00e1g\u00far hoblis.

In 1708, a Jangam priest, driven out of Bagur, took refuge with the Chitaldroog palegar, and was by him commissioned to build the petta below the hill and procure settlers to reside there. Eventually the place was taken by Haidar Ali and, with the exception of temporary occupations by the Mahrattas, has ever since been attached to Mysore.\n\nMunicipal Funds.\n\n| Income | Expenditure |\n|--------|-------------|\n| 982    | 1,866       |\n| 1,099  | 1,461       |\n| 1,060  | 1,134       |\n| 1,847  | 1,823       |\n\nJagalur.\u2014A taluq in the north, till 1882 called Kankuppa.

East of these lies an auriferous band continuous with one from Chitaldroog. There are no water-courses. The Janaga-halla flows along the eastern side; and the stream from\nthe Anaji tank, also called the Chinna Haggari, along the western. Here, too, there is an auriferous band.\n\nDividing the taluq into two nearly equal portions by a line from Basavankote through Kankuppa to Chikmallanhalli, the country to the north of this may be described as composed almost entirely of light and sandy soil, except among the hills in the north-west, where in some few places a rich red soil has been formed in the valleys by deposit of the finer particles of the decomposed rocks. All the better descriptions of soil are south of the line. The black soil is rather intimately interspersed with the surrounding red and sandy soils, but predominates in Jagalur and Bilichod. Probably one-fourth of the whole extent of cultivable soil in the taluq is either black or good brown soil.\n\nCotton and white jola are grown exclusively on the black soil. Rice and sugar-cane are largely cultivated, the latter of the small kind called hullu kabbu. The only extent of garden land is under the Jagalur tank. Much rice is grown on the banks of the Janaga-halla.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1867. There was at that time under cultivation an area of 94,590 acres (dry, 91,075; wet, 1,150; garden, 2,365). The present taluq consists of:\n\n| Culturable (dry, wet and garden) | ... | ... | ... | 147,200 |\n|---------------------------------|-----|-----|-----|---------|\n| Unculturable (including roads, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | ... | 89,600 |\n| Total acres | ... | ... | ... | 236,800 |\n\nThe unoccupied arable area is 36,480 acres. The total land revenue for 1891\u20132 (15 months) was Rs. 52,326, and for 1892\u20133 it was Rs. 54,229.\n\nThe average rainfall at Jagalur for 26 years (1870\u201395) was as follows:\n\n| Jan. | Feb. | Mar. | Apr. | May | June | July | Aug. | Sept. | Oct. | Nov. | Dec. | Year. |\n|------|------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|-------|------|------|------|-------|\n| 0'01 | 0'08 | 1'24 | 2'16 | 1'34 | 1'69 | 2'14 | 3'77 | 2'51 | 2'65 | 0'12 | ... | 17'71 |\n\nAnother register for 24 years makes the annual average 18'88.\n\nThe only road is from south to north through Jagalur and Kankuppa. A road is proposed from Jagalur east to Nayakanhatti.\n\n**Jagalur.**\u2014A town situated in 14\u00b0 31' N. lat., 76\u00b0 24' E. long., 28 miles north-by-west of Chitaldroog, with which it is connected by a road from Vijapur.

There is little of interest about the place, which derives its importance from being the taluq head-quarters, removed here from Kankuppa in about 1868. The houses are all built of an iron-shot slaty stone, and flat-roofed. Jagalur has a large tank.\n\n| Municipal Funds | 1892-3 | 1893-4 | 1894-5 | 1895-6 |\n|-----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Income          | 855    | 763    | 780    | 1,200  |\n| Expenditure     | 1,173  | 1,086  | 893    | 1,100  |\n\nMari Kanive.\u2014A pass in the eastern line of the Chitaldroog hills, through which the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati issues to the open country of Hiriur. So far back as Buchanan\u2019s time it was pointed out as a spot peculiarly favourable for the construction of a dam across the gorge, whereby an immense reservoir would be formed capable of irrigating the adjoining thirsty plains and converting them into a vast expanse of rice cultivation. The project, however, though much money has been spent on surveys and measurements, has not yet been commenced.\n\nMattod.\u2014A village in the Hosdurga sub-taluq, 10 miles east of the kasba, near the right bank of the V\u00e9d\u00e1vati. Population 880.\n\nIt is celebrated for its glass works, at one time more extensive than they are now. The articles made consist entirely of bangles, the rings worn round the wrists of native women. They are of five colours\u2014black, green, red, blue and yellow. The furnaces are constructed in a high terrace, built against the inside of the fort wall, but many of them seem to have long been disused. Only two are now in good repair. The process of manufacture is described in the first part of this work. All the materials are found in the neighbourhood.\n\nMattod was the seat of a line of palegars, whose founder was named Giriyappa N\u00e1yak. He was a handsome man, of great stature and prodigious strength, which he exercised in catching the wild beasts of the neighbourhood. Venkatpati R\u00e1ya, hearing of him through the B\u00fadih\u00e1l chief, sent for him to Penugonda, where, an elephant one day breaking loose, he had an opportunity of displaying his powers; for the infuriated animal could not be secured until Giriyappa N\u00e1yak boldly seized him by the tusks and fastened a rope to his trunk. For these and other feats he was, about 1604, made palegar of Lakavanhalli, his native place, with a grant of villages yielding a revenue of 9,000 pagodas. In 1710, Dodala N\u00e1yak, a descendant, built the fort of Mattod. He at the same time adopted the Lingayit faith. His son, Sangappa N\u00e1yak, distinguished himself at the court of Seringapatam by riding a most\nvicious and unmanageable horse which would allow no one to mount it; and when the courtiers, jealous of his success, pelted him with limes to embarrass him, he drew a sword and divided them as he rode swiftly about after them.\n\nH\u00e1lappa N\u00e1yak next succeeded, and after him Siddappa N\u00e1yak. He was the second son, but inherited the beauty, stature and prowess of his line; on which account his father had allowed him to supersede the eldest son, Dodala N\u00e1yak. The latter thereupon repaired to Chitaldroog, the palegar of which took up his cause, and defeating the younger brother, installed the elder in his place, subject to a tribute of 2,000 pagodas. On Siddappa N\u00e1yak\u2019s being taken prisoner to Chitaldroog, the daughter of the palegar of that place fell in love with him. His being a Ling\u00e1yit would have made their union impossible had he not been a Boya by descent. Eventually it was arranged that he should marry her and be restored to his government. His son H\u00e1lappa N\u00e1yak was induced by the growing power of Haidar Ali to assist the latter in the first siege against Chitaldroog. On Haidar\u2019s withdrawal the palegar of Chitaldroog in revenge took Mattod by assault, plundered the town and carried H\u00e1lappa off to prison. Chitaldroog was next year taken by Haidar and H\u00e1lappa released, but he never regained his territory.\n\nMolakalmuru.\u2014A taluq in the north-east, from 1882 to 1886 made a sub-taluq named H\u00e1ngal, under Challakere taluq, but then restored to a taluq. Area 290 square miles. Contains the following h\u00f3blis, villages and population:\n\n| No. | H\u00f3blis. | Villages. | Hamlets. | Government. | Sarva-m\u00e1nya. | Jodi. | Population |\n|-----|---------|-----------|----------|-------------|--------------|------|------------|\n| 1   | Devasmudra | ... | 52 | 11 | 48 | 2 | 2 | 16,094 |\n| 2   | Molak\u00e1lmuru | ... | 45 | 7 | 43 | \u2014 | 2 | 16,466 |\n| Total | ... | 97 | 18 | 91 | 2 | 4 | 32,560 |\n\nPrincipal places, with population.\u2014Molak\u00e1lmuru, 2,421; Devasamudra, 1,977; Konas\u00e1gara, 1,908; Roppa, 1,822; N\u00e1gasamudra, 1,677; R\u00e1mpura, 1,579.\n\nThis taluq is a long and narrow strip of country jutting into the Bellary district. A few isolated villages on the west are entirely separated from the body of the taluq. The surface is very undulating, and except where cultivated rice and garden lands exist, is covered with rocks and loose stones. A range of bare, rocky hills of considerable\nheight stretches right across the taluq, running from a south-easterly in a north-westerly direction. When the range approaches the western boundary it becomes split up into numerous elevations of different heights, which singly or in groups are scattered about in all directions, and some of which from the size and fantastic shapes of the enormous boulders of which they are composed present a very remarkable appearance. More than one-third of the whole surface is occupied by these hills, which are so barren that not a blade of grass or a tree will grow upon their sides. A tract of nearly 9 square miles in the south is occupied by kammar (Hardwickia bennata) jungle, but the distribution is thin and the trees have been pollarded and much denuded. It seems a pity that steps are not taken to replant and conserve this valuable wood. The southern half of the taluq is comparatively level, but the soils are of the poorest kind, comprising the light red and sandy descriptions, and there is no black soil whatever.\n\nThe Janaga-halla, after running along the western boundary for a short distance, suddenly turns to the east, and flowing in a north-easterly direction, with the name of Chinna Haggari, receives the drainage from the bare, rocky hills around, and unites with the Vedavati in the Bellary district. All the tanks of any importance are close to the river, and receive their supply from it by means of channels varying in length from a mile to five miles. These channels are little used for direct irrigation.\n\nThe principal feature in the cultivation is the lands irrigated from wells, which exist in almost every village, and under which, as a rule, two crops are obtained annually, chiefly rice; but betel-leaf, tobacco, wheat and javari are also grown. Betel-leaf is extensively cultivated in Devasamudra and Rampura for the Bellary market. Except under irrigation the soils are peculiarly unfertile, and dry crops are but little attended to, the ryots devoting all their capital and skill to the cultivation of the wet lands.\n\nKamblis, coarse cotton cloths, women's cloths with silk borders, and tape for belts are the principal manufactures. The women's cloths are chiefly made at Molakalmuru. Iron ore, brought from the Kumaraswami hill in Sundur, is smelted in one or two villages.\n\nThis part of Mysore has lately acquired a special interest from my discovery here in 1892 of Edicts of Asoka. None have ever been found before in the South of India, and this find has been pronounced by high authority as marking an epoch in Indian archaeology. It effectually lifts the veil which has obscured the ancient history, and leaves no doubt that the Maurya empire of the 3rd century B.C. extended as far as to include the north of the Mysore country. The\nEdicts found were in three places, close around the village of Siddapura (possibly the Isila to which the Edicts were addressed), engraved on rocks on either side of the Janagahalla\u2014one at Brahmagiri, another at the Timmanna rocks, and the third at the top of the Jatinga Ramesvara hill. Here Jatayu is said to have fallen in attempting to rescue Sita from Ravana.\n\nThe next oldest inscriptions in the taluq are also at the latter place and at the Nunke Bhairava hill. Those of the former are Chalukya of the 10th and 11th centuries, and show us Vishnuvarddhana Vijayaditza ruling the Nolambavadi 32,000, which thus included Molakalmuru, with his capital at Kampili, on the Tungabhadra in Bellary district. He was followed by Jayasingha, younger brother of Vikramaditya VI, and having, among others, the titles of Nolamba Pallava. The inscriptions at the Nunke Bhairava hill are Kadamba, and it is possible that the Uchchangi-durga to the north of Molakalmuru, also known as Hire-Aryara-durga, hill fort of the old Aryas, may be the Uchch\u00e1sringi which was one of the Kadamba seats of government. In the time of the Hoysalas we find a line of rulers of the Solar race, that is of Chola descent, who held Nidugal (see above, p. 163), in possession of Haneyakote, which was then the name of the Brahmagiri fort, and of which there is perhaps a reminiscence in H\u00e1ngal or H\u00e1neyagal. The fort was captured in the 12th century by Vira Ball\u00e1la, who changed the name to Vijayagiri.\n\nUnder the Vijayanagar kings, in the 15th century, Molakalmuru seems to have belonged to the chiefs of Rayadurga, 7 miles to the east. One of them, named Bomma Nayak the Foolish, gave it up to Mallappa Nayak of Hatti (now called Nayakanhatti) in exchange for some white cattle, of which he owned a rare and valuable breed. It was before long conquered by the palegars of Chitaldroog, in whose hands it remained till captured by Haidar Ali and annexed to Mysore.\n\nThe revenue settlement was introduced in 1872. The area of the taluq at that time was thus distributed:\n\n| Culturable (dry, 83,604; wet, 2,766; garden, 5,995) | ... | ... | 92,365 |\n| Unculturable (including roads, tanks, village sites, &c.) | ... | ... | 87,254 |\n| Total acres | ... | ... | 179,619 |\n\nThe unoccupied arable land was 34,466 acres, nearly all dry crop land. The total land revenue for 1891-2 (15 months) was Rs. 49,458, and for 1892-3 it was Rs. 50,023.\n\nThe average rainfall at Molakalmuru for 26 years (1870-95) and at the other station for 3 years (1893-5) was as follows:\u2014\nMOLAKALMURU\n\nJan.

Near to it a good echo is obtained from the k\u00faguva band\u00e9 or shouting stone, and in the east of it is a boulder on which is inscribed a yamaka verse in praise of K\u00e1lid\u00e1sa. To the north-west of this is the Nunke-Bhairava hill, on which, in a remarkable enclosed valley or ravine, with no visible outlet at either end, is an ancient temple of that name, served by a succession of Gos\u00e1yins from Northern India. Inscriptions show that the proper name of the god is Lunkes'vara, and it appears to have been set up in the 10th century by a Kadamba prince. The Kadambas also had a fort here called the Lun'zeya-kote.\n\nThe ancient history has been given under the taluq. In modern times, under the Vijayanagar State, it belonged to the chief of R\u00e1ydurga, 7 miles to the east. After the fall of Vijayanagar, the R\u00e1ydurga palegar Bomma N\u00e1yak, surnamed the Foolish, gave up Molakalmuru to Mallappa N\u00e1yak of Hatti (now called Nayakanhatti) in exchange for some white cattle, of which he owned a rare and valuable breed. Mallappa N\u00e1yak, finding water on the hill, fortified it and lived there. But in the time of his son the place was taken by the palegar of Chitaldroog, in whose family it remained till captured by Haidar Ali and annexed to Mysore.\nNayakanhatti.\u2014Formerly called Hatti, a large village in the Challakere taluq, 14 miles north-west of the kasba. Population 2,468.\n\nThe traditional history of this place relates that one Kotte Malla N\u00e1yak, the owner of numerous flocks and herds of superior cattle, living in the forests of Kara-male and Komma-male, to the east of the Srisaila mountains, was compelled by drought and famine to move elsewhere in quest of forage. He ultimately arrived, with 1,200 head of cattle, besides cows and sheep, in the neighbourhood of Hatti; where, finding abundant pasturage, he settled, obtaining permission from Vijayanagar to clear some of the forest, erect villages and bring the region under cultivation. A bh\u00e1\u1e6d or eulogist one day visited him, and was so liberally rewarded for his flattering verses that on repairing to court he extolled the N\u00e1yak in such extravagant terms as to excite the jealousy of the king, who sent a force to apprehend him. Mallappa N\u00e1yak, having no other resource, urged his cattle to charge the troops, which were completely routed by these novel defenders. The king, indignant at the repulse, offered a large reward to anyone who would bring the N\u00e1yak prisoner to him, but none would venture. Finally some courtesans undertook the task, but failed with all their seductive arts to get him into their power. Surprised at their failure, they questioned the genuineness of his virtue unless it could stand the test that all his cattle would run to him at the sound of his voice. He immediately mounted on a rock and called out in his usual manner, when all the herds and flocks ran and assembled round him. The report of the courtesans aroused the highest respect for Malla N\u00e1yak on the part of the king, who conferred on him all the country round Kondarpi-durga, with the title of palegar.\n\nOne of his descendants, in the third generation, separated with his cattle from the others and founded Hatti as a residence for himself. At a later time Budi Malla N\u00e1yak of this family rendered important military aid to Vijayanagar, and by victory over a jet\u1e6di or wrestler at court obtained the name of Bhima, and thereupon built Bhimankere. Afterwards, when Bomma N\u00e1yak the Foolish was palegar of R\u00e1ydurga, Malla N\u00e1yak at his request gave him 2,000 red and 1,000 white cattle, and received in exchange the hill of Molak\u00e1lmuru. This he fortified and thence extended his possessions; but in the time of his son it was seized by Barmappa N\u00e1yak of Chitaldroog, who confined the palegar.\nto his original estate at Hatti. This, too, was shortly taken by Hir\u00e9 Madakeri Nayak and annexed to Chitadroog; of which it remained a part till captured by Haidar Ali.\n\nNayakanhatti contains a celebrated tomb and temple dedicated to a Mah\u00e1-purusha or saint of the Lingayits, named Tippe Rudraiya, who lived about 200 years ago, wrought miracles and became the spiritual preceptor of the Hatti palegars. The large sums bestowed upon him by the faithful he devoted to the enlargement and repair of tanks, and to other works of public benefit which entitle his name to be held in honour.\n\n**Nirgunda.**\u2014A village in the Hosdurga taluq, 7 miles west of the kasba. Population 345.\n\nThis now insignificant village is interesting as marking the site of one of the most ancient cities in Mysore of which there is authentic record. Nirgunda was the capital of a Jain principality of the same name, included in the Ganga empire, 1,500 years ago. According to tradition, it was founded in B.C. 160 by a king from the north, named Nilasekhara, son of R\u00e1ja Paramesvara R\u00e1ya, who gave it the name of Nil\u00e1vati-patna. He was succeeded by Virasekhara, and their descendants continued to be independent sovereigns of their country.\n\nFrom the N\u00e1gamangala plates we know that Dundu, with the title of Nirgunda Yuva R\u00e1ja, and after him his son Parama Gula, with the title of Sri Prithivi Nirgunda R\u00e1ja, ruled early in the 8th century. The legend of the place proceeds to the reign of Vikrama R\u00e1ya of this house, in whose time occurred a romantic incident. Two princes, Somasekhara and Chitrasekhara, sons of Vajra Makuta R\u00e1ya, came secretly to Nil\u00e1vati from Ratnapuri (near Lakvalli, Kadur District) for the purpose of securing for the younger the hand of Ratnavati or Rup\u00e1vati, the king\u2019s daughter, famous for her beauty. Having rendered themselves invisible, they penetrated at night to the king\u2019s bed-chamber and attached to his arm a paper containing their demand. The king on discovering it was much perplexed; but a lion having taken refuge in a pleasure garden near the town and become a terror to the people, he caused it to be proclaimed that the princess would be given in marriage to whomsoever should destroy the lion. The two brothers, who lodged in disguise at a dancing-girl\u2019s house, sallied forth next night, killed the beast and, cutting off its tail, returned to their concealment. In the morning, M\u00e1ra, a washerman of the town, finding the lion dead, cut out its tongue, and carrying it to the king, presented himself as the champion to be rewarded with the hand of the princess. While preparations for this distasteful marriage were going on, the princes appeared before the palace in the guise of strolling musicians, with the\nlion's tail tied to their lute. This drew attention to them and the truth came out, which ended in Ratnavati being married to Chitrashekha. Vikrama R\u0101ya, dying without issue, left the kingdom to his son-in-law. His descendants were Bala Vira and Narasimha. About this time the Hoysala kings captured Nil\u0101vati, and some epidemic seems to have led to its desertion soon after. B\u0101g\u016br, a short distance to the north, was subsequently founded, and became the capital of the region in place of Nirgunda or Nil\u0101vati. Mounds of ruins and several old temples are still in existence around the village, with an old Hoysala inscription of 1065.\n\nVed\u0101vati, or Haggari, the principal river in the District, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. It is formed by two streams, having their sources on the eastern side of the Chandra Drona or B\u0101b\u0101 Budan mountains (Kadur District). The Veda, which is the chief one, forms the beautiful Ayyankere lake, whence issuing, it passes to the south of Sakkarepatna and then turns north-east. Near Kadur it is joined by the other stream, the Avati, and further on by the streams from the hills near Halebid and Harnhalli on the south, and those from the hills around Ubr\u0101ni on the north.\n\nWith a direct north-east course, the Ved\u0101vati now enters the Chitaldroog District, passing about midway between Hosdurga and Mattod; and penetrating the central belt of hills, it issues thence by the pass called the M\u00e1ri Kanive, to the south of Barmagiri-durga, and continues in the same direction past Hiriyur, to about seven miles beyond. Here, on receiving the streams from Sira and Hagalvadi, it turns northwards, taking the name Haggari, said to be derived from hagg\u0101-ari, freeing from the bonds (of sin).\n\nWinding through an open country, it leaves the Mysore about 5 miles north of Ghataparti in Challakere taluq and enters the Bellary District, with for some distance a north-east course. It then again turns north, and at a point nearly parallel with the furthest limit of Mysore on that side, receives the Janagahalla or Chinna Haggari from Molakalmuru. Continuing north, and leaving Bellary about 10 miles to the west, it flows into the Tungabhadra some distance to the south of Huchahalli.\n\nIt is a very shallow river and though impassable except by boats in the monsoon, in the dry season it presents a broad bed of sand, in which, however, kapile wells are readily formed. In the Bellary country the river is supposed to be gradually changing its bed. At Moka, 12 miles from Bellary, the sandy bed is two miles broad.\n\n---\n\n1 For the continuation of the story, describing the marvellous adventures by which Somasekhara won the hand of a princess of Hemavati (p. 182 above), see my Coorg Gazetteer, pp. 94 ff.\nThe river is bridged for the trunk road at Hiriyur (the first bridge erected in Mysore under the British Government), and for the Bellary Branch railway at Permadevanhalli. The project of embanking the stream at the narrow gorge of the M\u00e1ri-Kanive and thus creating, at a cost of about 15 lakhs, an immense reservoir that would irrigate 50,000 acres of the fertile but arid plains of Hiriyur, is a proposal of long standing, still under consideration. A great number of small channels are drawn from the Ved\u00e1vati in the Kadur District.\nAPPENDIX\n\nGLOSSARY OF JUDICIAL AND REVENUE TERMS\nAnd other Words occurring in Official Documents\n\nA'b\u00e1d ... ... ...

I.\n\nAdd, \"Mr. Bruce Foote, in his Geology of the Bellary District (Mem. Geol. Surv. Ind., Vol. XXV.), says:\u2014Captain Newbold did far more to elucidate the Geology of Southern India up to the establishment of the Geological Survey than all the other writers and investigators of the subject taken together, and his work deserves full notice, for most of it was well done according to the geological views prevalent in his day . . . . The principal point on which his views cannot now be accepted is his assumption that the schistose bands in the peninsula have been brought into their present positions by being broken through by great outbursts of granite. At first sight this appears to be the case, but on closer and more extended examination of the country this idea is found to be untenable, for the old granitoids are nowhere seen to be irrupted into the schists; on the contrary, the latter were deposited on the former by quiet, long-continued sedimentary action. This is, of course, a total change of the relative positions of the two rock series: the granitoids assume their true position as the true fundamental rocks of the country, and the schists are seen to be vastly younger in age than Newbold supposed them to be.\n\nThe granitic intrusions in the schist series which Newbold regarded as intrusions of the granitoid mass, are all found to be intrusions of much younger pegmatoid veins, and of very small extent and importance.\"\n\nBefore \"Metamorphic Rocks\" insert, \"Archean or.\"\n\nTo \"Southern India\". add as note 1, \"The schists are not, in the modern sense of the term, hypogene schists; they are truly and unmistakably sedimentary formations associated with contemporary trap-flows, and whatever metamorphism they have undergone since their deposition is due to great movements of the earth's crust, which led to their being bent up into great folds forming huge synclinals and anticlinals. When this had happened a period of vast erosive action ensued, and thousands of feet in thickness of the schistose series were removed, and the underlying granitoid foundation was again exposed; while much of the eroded material was re-deposited as the rocks of the younger Kadapa and Karnul systems. The equivalents of Newbold's hypogene schists (in the Bellary district) belong to the system I have called the Dharwar system. . . .\n\nThe greater mass of the Dharwars consists of schists, hornblendeic, chloritic, and argillaceous; but the associated traps, and more especially the hematitic quartizes, from their superior hardness and durability, occupy in many places much the most prominent positions; while, from the same reasons, the taluses they have given rise to in the hilly tracts are of extraordinary extent, and cover up much of the softer rocks, and mislead one as to their real extent.\n\nThe Dharwar rocks were originally deposited over very much larger areas than they now occupy, and very probably extended across the whole, or nearly the whole, peninsula. How far they may have extended to the north it is not possible at present to say, for the northern extremities of several of the Dharwar tracts are hidden under younger geological formations\u2014e.g., the Kaladgi and Bhima series, and the Deccan trap along the upper course of the Kistna river. To the southward the Dharwar rocks extend into and across\nthe valley of the Kav\u00e9ri almost to the northern slope of the Nilgiris. The Dharwar system was exposed to great contortion and deformation at a very remote geological period, and this had been followed by a vast period of denudation, during which the enormous folds into which they had been forced previously were largely eroded, and cut up into the great bands in which they now occur. In general structure these bands are of two types\u2014in the one, the band is a narrow synclinal fold, or a series of narrow synelines echeloned after each other at exceedingly acute angles. In the second type, the band shows a natural erosion boundary on one side, and on the other is faulted down against and among the underlying granitoids. It is owing to these faultings down into the older rocks that the softer schistose members of the system have in many cases escaped from being entirely denuded away.\u2014Bruce Foote, loc. cit., pp. 22 and 74.\n\n81 heading Omit \"Fruit.\"\n\n211 heading For \"Tudas\" read \"Todas.\"\n\n285 13 For \"now\" read \"near.\"\n\n340 34 For \"Chalasaravi (probably in the south of)\" read \"Byalanad (Wainad, in.\"\n\n419 Note Add, \"Welsh says:\u2014Though a short, swarthy-looking man, and rather inclining to fat, he was as hardy and active in body as in mind; and even when far advanced in life, he would ride thirty or forty miles a day, and chase a hare, an antelope, or a fox, with all the fire and vigour of youth.
