I.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL.1\n\nGORAKHPUR, a district in the Benares division, and after Mirzapur the most extensive non-Himalayan district in the North-Western Provinces, lies between north latitude 26\u00b0 7' 45\" and 27\u00b0 29' 15\", and east longitude 83\u00b0 8' 0\" and 84\u00b0 32' 30\". It is bounded on the north by Nep\u00e1l, from which it is separated\n\n1 The materials for this notice have been supplied chiefly by Mr. E. Alexander, B.C.S., who acknowledges the aid derived from the Settlement Reports and the writings of Swinton, Hamilton, Cunningham, Elliot, and others. But throughout the work, and especially in its latter portions, considerable additions have been made by Messrs. W. Crooke and H. Conybeare of the same service.\nby an arbitrary line of boundary pillars; and on the west by the district of Basti, the frontier being for a short distance formed by the Gh\u00fanghi and R\u00e1pti rivers. On the south it is divided from the Azamgarh district by the river Gh\u00e1gra; and on the east from the Champ\u00e1ran and S\u00e1ran districts of Bengal by a line mostly artificial, but supplied for a few miles by the former bed of the Great Gandak river, whose main stream now runs almost wholly within that province. The maximum breadth of the district from east to west is 86, the minimum 47, and the average 64 miles. Its maximum length from north to south is 83, its minimum 70, and its average 75 miles. Gorakhpur has, excluding fractions, a total area of 4,584 square miles, of which 2,700 may be roughly estimated as under cultivation, 1,102 as culturable, and 782 as barren.\\(^1\\) The total population by the last census (1872) was 2,019,361 souls.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe following table shows the subdivisions into which for purposes of revenue and general administration the district is divided, and details the area, revenue, population, and police jurisdictions of each:\n\n| Tahsil | Parganah | Included by the Ain-i-Akbar\u00ed in | Land-revenue in 1877-78 | Present area in square miles (omitting fractions) | Population in 1872 | Included in the police jurisdiction of |\n|--------|----------|---------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| I.\u2014Mah\u00e1r\u00e1l-ganj | 1.

The figures above given are founded on the settlement reports, allowance being made for the increase which has undoubtedly taken place since they were compiled, as well as for cultivation in jungle grant lands not surveyed at settlement.\n\n\\(^2\\) Details of this population will be found in the beginning of Part III.\nThe parganah divisions almost all represent roughly the limits of the territories of the various petty princes who parcelled out the country between them before the Muhammadans acquired any real hold on it, and their origin may be briefly described as follows:\n\n(1) Bin\u00e1yakpur corresponds with the eastern portion of the B\u00fatwal R\u00e1ja's territory as it stood after the separation of (2) Tilpur by Tilak Sen about 1725 A.D. He represented the younger branch of this family, and divided the family possessions with his elder brother, Bin\u00e1yak Singh. The parganah of Bin\u00e1yakpur was cut in two after the Nep\u00e1lese war by the cession of a strip of land to the Gurkha chiefs, and on the division of Basti from Gorakhpur in 1865 its western portion was included in the former district.\n\n(3) Haveli Gorakhpur.\u2014The northern, which is locally as well as in the settlement reports recognised as having formed a distinct tract from the southern portion, represents the domain held for some time by the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. It was divided from the southern portion, which formed the Sat\u00e1si r\u00e1j, by a vast forest, and was itself for the most part woodland. Not being clearly occupied by any R\u00e1ja, it received no separate name, and was considered by the Muhammadans as attached to the Haveli parganah.\n\n(7) Sidhua Jobna.\u2014The name is said to be derived from its being a wild region, into which holy men or siddhas went to perform austerities. It embraces all the tract which lay above the territory of the Majholi R\u00e1ja and east of the Sat\u00e1si r\u00e1j. The southern portion represents the country held by R\u00e1ja Madan Singh to the north and east, just as (9) Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur represents that to the south and west. The north agrees roughly with the limits of the Padrauna tal\u00faka. Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur was at one time included in the same parganah.\n\n(6) Maghar.\u2014This parganah was cut in two at the separation of the Basti district (1865), and marks the limits of the old Maghar r\u00e1j.\n\n(5) Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r corresponds with the possessions of the Sat\u00e1si r\u00e1j along the west bank of the R\u00e9pti.\n\n(11) Anola was the territory of the Anola R\u00e1ja.\n\n(10) Silhat is the tract so long (1633-83) disputed between the Majhauli and Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas; while (12) Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r was the country conquered by Dh\u00far Chand Singh (circ. 1350). (14) Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r, once known as Chahluap\u00e1r, was the name of a part of the country annexed by the Simara B\u00e1bu, who thereon became R\u00e1ja of Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r (circ. 1630); and (15) Salempur Majhauli was the permanent territory of the Majhauli R\u00e1jas, who held Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Silhat for a time only.\nThe formation of the present district may now be briefly described. Elliot\u00b9 describes sark\u00e1r Gorakhpur as consisting in Akbar's time (1596) of 19 parganahs and 24 mah\u00e1ls as follows:\n\n1. Atraula.\n2. Anola.\n3. Bin\u00e1yakpur (2 mah\u00e1ls).\n4. Rambnips\u00e1ra.\n5. Bh\u00e9wap\u00e1ra.\n6. Tilpur.\n7. Chil\u00fap\u00e1ra.\n8. Dhuri\u00e1ps\u00e1ra.\n9. Dhew\u00e1p\u00e1ra Kuh\u00e1na.\n10. Rihli.\n\nElliot apparently considers that this sark\u00e1r corresponded on the east and south with the present district, and that Dhew\u00e1p\u00e1ra included Sidhua Jobna, Salempur, and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. It is however more probable that the limits of the sark\u00e1r to the east corresponded with the western boundary Sark\u00e1r Gorakhpur line of parganahs Sidhua Jobna and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, which and its probable limits were at that time included together under the name of the former in sark\u00e1r S\u00e1ran. In the settlement report of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur dated 1832 this is clearly stated to have been the case, and, as will be shown in the historical account of the district, Sidhua Jobna never really formed part of the Majhauli r\u00e1j, and was not likely to be included with it in Dhew\u00e1p\u00e1ra. The name of the latter tract, too, clearly signifies the country just across the Dhewa (a name of the Gh\u00e1gra), and would be rightly applied to Salempur Majhauli, but not to Sidhua Jobna. Sidhua Jobna was transferred to sark\u00e1r Gorakhpur in 1137 F. S. (1730 A.D.) and carried Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur with it: the latter not being created into a separate parganah until about 1150 F. S. (1743 A.D.)\n\nSalempur took its present name on the conversion of the Majhauli R\u00e1ja to Muhammadanism in about 1565.\u00b2 Silhat, the only other parganah now existing which is not given in the above list, was separated from Haveli Gorakhpur about 1700, after its reconquest by the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas. And these four parganahs, with all those on the list except R\u00e1mgarh Gauri (which seems to have been retained by the Naw\u00e1b Vaz\u00edr), and with part also of B\u00fatwal, now in Nep\u00e1l, represent pretty accurately the district of Gorakhpur as it stood when made over to the British in 1801.\u00b3 To this district, however, the following\n\n\u00b9 Races of the North-Western Provinces, Vol. II., p. 119. Sark\u00e1r Gorakhpur was included in the province of Oudh (S\u00e1ba Avadh). \u00b2 The popular and more ancient name of the chief town Salempur is Naw\u00e1p\u00e1r, or, according to Buchanan, Nagar. \u00b3 It seems at this time to have been called in official correspondence sark\u00e1r Muazzimabad after Prince Muazzim, son of Aurangzeb.\ndivisions were annexed when the first English officer was appointed to their charge:\n\n1. Chakla Mahul (consisting of 6 parganahs).\n2. Chakla Azamgarh (11 parganahs).\n3. Nawabganj (6 parganahs).\n4. Khairagarh (7 parganahs).\n\nThe last named was immediately afterwards placed in charge of a separate officer, as being too distant from headquarters to be properly managed (1802). After the Nepalese war the whole territory of Butwal (except parganahs Binayakpur and Tilpur, which had for some time before our rule belonged at least nominally to Oudh) was transferred to Nepal (1816); while Nawabganj was surrendered to the Nawab in exchange for some land attached to the Shahjahanpur district, and in repayment of a money loan borrowed for war expenses. Parganahs 1, 4, and 10 in Elliot\u2019s list were thus made over to Oudh. The third change occurred four years afterwards (1820), when the whole of chakla Azamgarh and the bulk of Mahul were transferred from the Gorakhpur to the Ghazipur and Jaunpur districts, the undivided charge being found too heavy for one officer. A fourth alteration in area arose from the transfer of the Tarai to Nepal after the mutiny. No further change seems to have been made till 1864, when, the extent of the district being found too great to allow of its proper administration, a portion was separated to form the new district of Basti. This arrangement, completed in 1865, gave the new district parganahs Rasulpur, Kataha, Rihlapara, Mahuli, Mandwa, and Mandla, with parts of Binayakpur and Maghar.\n\nIt is not improbable that further changes will soon be made, as the present tahsil arrangement shown above dates only from 1872. The division by tahsils seems to have been introduced for the first time in 1804, when the present Gorakhpur district, with some part of Basti, was divided into five subdivisions, over each of which a tahsildar was placed. This officer was at first charged with the maintenance of the police and with the protection of life and property throughout his tahsil, as well as with the collection of revenue, for which the kanungo seems to have been directly responsible. He was allowed a percentage on the collections, and bound to maintain a sufficient police force to guard the treasure and put down dakaits with a strong hand.\nThe five tahsils were arranged as follows:\n\n1. The present parganahs of Salempur and Chillop\u00e1r.\n2. Those of Bha\u00fa\u00e1p\u00e1r, Anola, and Bakhira (in the present Basti district).\n3. Havelli, Silhat, Maghar, and Ras\u00falpur Ghaus (in Basti).\n4. Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Maholi (in Basti).\n5. Sidhwa Jobna, including Sh\u00e1jhjah\u00e1npur.\n\nOur authority at this date seems to have been merely nominal in Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur, which were mostly under forest.\n\nIn 1809-10, after the restoration of the appointment of tahsild\u00e1r, which had been abolished in 1808, Bha\u00fa\u00e1p\u00e1r and Anola were joined to the sadr tahsil, while Maghar and Ras\u00falpur Ghaus were taken from the latter and united to B\u00e1nsi (in Basti). In 1817-18 again, after the settlement of the Nep\u00e1l boundary, a new tahsil was formed in the north from parganahs Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur. This arrangement seems to have continued undisturbed till 1835-40, when a new tahsil was located at B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on, and Anola, Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r, and Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r were put under its jurisdiction.\n\nIn 1845 the Tilpur tahsil was brought further south and located at Mans\u00farganj, but after about 16 years the increase of cultivation and revenue in the northern parganahs made it necessary to move it north again. The site at last selected was Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, where it is still situated. Simultaneously with this second change it was found advisable to diminish the area of the sadr tahsil, and in 1871-72 a new tahsil was built at H\u00e1ta, which relieved it of a considerable portion of the Havelli parganah. To this new tahsil were added parganahs Sh\u00e1jhjah\u00e1npur and Silhat from the jurisdiction of the Sidhwa Jobna and Salempur tahsils.\n\nThe following table shows the present parganahs and their approximate cultivated area, including l\u00e1khir\u00e1j lands which are omitted in the settlement returns:\n\n| Parganah          | Area in acres | Cultivated according to the last settlement returns.

The \"r\u00e1j\" or territory of each separate\n\nTappas.\nindependent R\u00e1ja, though its boundaries were occasionally altered by the results of a local war, was usually marked off with clearness, and, as already noticed, gave their limits to most of the present parganahs. The tappa division seems to have been almost as ancient and almost as clearly defined.\n\nIts exact origin is extremely hard to ascertain; but there is much in favour of the theory that tappas represent the lands held by vassals of the independent R\u00e1jas under what Elphinstone\u00b9 justly calls the R\u00e1jput feudal system. There is no doubt that this system prevailed in Gorakhpur. The birt tenure in force to this day is nothing but a feudal tenure, the service it exacted having been, as in other similar cases, converted into a scutage or money payment.\u00b2 There are 158 tappas in the present district, with an average area of about 30 square miles each. In Sidhua Jobna and in South Haveli Mr. Lumsden notices that the subdivisions are in many cases co-extensive with natural divisions of soil, or with limits marked off by other natural boundaries, such as rivers. He also mentions that in the latter parganah they often represent tal\u00fakas \u201cwhich might appropriately be formed into tappas at the arrangement of fiscal subdivisions consequent on the cession.\u201d He does not, of course, by this mean that the tappa subdivision was only introduced at the cession. Tappas are mentioned as early as when R\u00edja Bern\u00e1th invaded and established himself in Chill\u00fap\u00e1r (circ. 625); and they seem to correspond roughly with the old \u201clordship of ten towns\u201d mentioned by Manu. There is, however, one broad difference between them and the same divisions in other parts of the country: the township was never here the same important limit as elsewhere. Mr. Wynne, in his Sah\u00e1ranpur report, but speaking of Gorakhpur, has pointed this out; and, as will be shown in the paragraph on \u201cTenures,\u201d the rights, tenures, and subdivisions below the r\u00e1j were in almost all cases founded by and dependent on the R\u00e1ja. The tappa was therefore no merely artificial classification of the townships for administrative purposes. It very probably at first represented the lands helds under the R\u00e1ja by each baron and his kinsmen. Afterwards, perhaps, when the country had to some extent settled down, when payment had been substituted for service, and the division of property amongst different members of the family had been recognised, the tappas were converted into merely fiscal subdivisions and their boundaries fixed by fiscal considerations only. The word itself seems to signify a share or offshoot of some larger whole. Thus it is sometimes used to signify a colony from an older village, as in the case of tappa Patna, a daughter settlement of Patna Kh\u00e1s in parganah Sh\u00e1ljh\u00e1npur.

Balla. |\n\nDistrict total: 1 whole, 1 in part.\n\nThe subdivision of Kassia was separated from the Sadr in 1868, in order to avoid the inconvenience of managing the Sidhua Jobna parganah from so great a distance as Gorakhpur. Comprising that parganah and part of Sh\u00e1ljah\u00e1npur, it is in charge of an assistant magistrate-collector, who enjoys a large measure of independence. The subdivision is likely at no distant period to become a separate district.\n\nThere are three munsifs' and one subordinate judge's court, their existing jurisdictions being shown below. The munsifs' courts were formerly at Mans\u00farganj, B\u00e1nsgaon, and Deoria; that of the last named being also held for three months in the year at Padrauan. In 1862 however, when the headquarters of the tahsil were shifted from Mans\u00farganj to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, the munsif's court was removed to Gorakhpur on account of the unhealthiness of the northern tract during part of the year. In 1865 the visits of the munsif to Padrauna were also discontinued, and the\nfollowing jurisdictions formed on the complete separation of the district have since been retained:\n\n| 1. The Sadr Amin's or Subordinate Judges | At Gorahpur | Parganah Binayakpur East. Tilpur. Haveil. 4 tappas from Maghar. 2 from Bhausp\u00e1r. 8 from Sidhua Jobna. |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| 2. Munsif's, 1st grade                   |             | Sidhua Jobna, with exception of 8 tappas above Salempur. Majhauil. 6 tappas Silhat. |\n| 3. Munsif's, 2nd grade                   | At Deoria   | Dhuriap\u00e1r. Chilliap\u00e1r. Anola. Bhausp\u00e1r, with the exception of 2 tappas. The remaining 5 tappas in Maghar and 6 tappas in Salempur. Majhauil. |\n| 4. Munsif's, 3rd grade                   | At Bansgaon | |\n\nBesides these there is the court of the civil (sessions) judge at Gorakhpur. The jurisdiction of the latter extends also over the district of Basti.\n\nLying east of Oudh and close under the Him\u00e1layas, the district in its physical characteristics differs much from the Gangetic plain. Speaking generally, Gorakhpur is a level tract broken by nothing higher than a few sandhills in the centre and east, and sloping very gently from north-west to south-east. The surface of this plain is intersected by numerous rivers and streams and dotted by a large number of lakes and ponds. The water supply, except in very dry years, is abundant, and the large amount of moisture in the soil gives the country a green fresh appearance, which at once strikes the eye of one entering the district from the more arid country south of the Gh\u00e9gra. In the north and centre are extensive tracts of jungle and sal forest. The trees are not as a rule of any great size, but the density and extent of the forest in some places convey a feeling of solitude and wildness which cannot fail to impress the traveller who has just left the populous and highly cultivated country in the south. Here and to the south-east there is an expanse of cultivation only broken by fine mango groves or by the numerous streams and tals which occur at short intervals. The west and south-west of the district, intersected by the Ami and the Ku\u00e1na, lie rather low, and in the rainy season this part of the country is as far as the R\u00e1pti liable to extensive inundations. If the rainfall is at all exception-\nally heavy the water collects in the valley of the Ami, and joining the lakes to the east, presents the appearance of an immense sheet of water several miles in extent. To the east of the R\u00e9pti the ground rises slightly and there are a few sandhills, but it again sinks towards the south-east, and the general slope of the country is, as before mentioned, in this direction.\n\nAlong the north of the district lies the tar\u00e1i at the foot of the first range of hills; these are about eight miles beyond the frontier in Nep\u00e1l. The snowy range can be seen distinctly from the frontier, and though there are no hills within the district, their propinquity changes the character of the country altogether from that which it bears in the south. The nature of the landscape in the north is somewhat similar to that of the D\u00fan. The streams are clear, and run, in some cases, over pebbly beds. Large tracts are covered by forests which contain some fine trees. In these tracts there are often open pieces of sward admirably adapted for pasturing cattle; sometimes there are large marshes full of na\u1e6d and infested by tigers and other wild animals. The principal cultivation is rice, and the inhabitants are mostly hill men (Gurkhas) or Th\u00e1r\u00fas, who, though differing from the former, are more like them than like the people of the south. The climate of this tract is, as elsewhere in the tar\u00e1i, very dangerous at certain seasons of the year, but mild and pleasant at the beginning of the hot season. In the south the appearance of the country is altogether altered, and the population is composed, as in the districts below the Gh\u00e1gara, chiefly of the ordinary Hindu and Muslim tribes. The climate is good and similar to that of the southern districts. In the east, especially somewhat north of the centre, the character of the country is mixed. Here are undulations and ridges which show for the first time an approach to the hills. Patches of jungle appear, and the climate is not so well suited to natives who come from other districts as that of the south.\n\nAs before remarked, the slope of the country is from north-west to south-east. The average height above the level of the sea is only 316 feet. In the north-west the usual elevation is about 350 feet, in the south-east about 305. The highest of the sandhills is 386 feet, and probably the ground nowhere sinks much below 300.\n\nThe soils of the district are classified either according to their position or their composition. According to their position these soils are:\n\n(1) Kh\u00e9dar or low riverside flats. Of such lands the R\u00e9pti basin affords typical specimens.\n\n---\n\n1 A tall kind of reed.  \n2 This hillock lies between Padrauna and Kassia. There is another ridge, very little lower, south of Nichlavai in parganah Tilpur.\n(2) Kach\u00e1r or the same when liable to yearly inundation. Kach\u00e1r land usually yields a spring crop only.\n\n(3) Chaur bh\u00e1t\u2014that is, land low and marshy, but not necessarily near a river, nor liable to inundation in the same way as kach\u00e1r. It is, in fact, rather a water-logged soil near some jhil than a kh\u00e1dir soil.\n\n(4) Chauri\u00e1r bh\u00e1t, a higher lying soil than the chaur bh\u00e1t, with considerable natural moisture and great fertility.\n\nAccording to their composition soils are distributed into the following classes:\n\n(1) Balua, a sandy light soil similar to that known elsewhere as bh\u00e9r.\n\n(2) Dorus,\u00b9 a dry siliceous loam, in which the sand slightly predominates over the clay, and whose spring crops, therefore, in most years require irrigation.\n\n(3) Mattiy\u00e1r, in which the proportions of sand and clay are reversed, and which requires in most parts of the district little irrigation in ordinary years.\n\n(4) Bh\u00e1t,\u00b2 a calcareous soil retentive of moisture and requiring no irrigation in ordinary years. Its productive qualities vary very much according to its position, and even the best kind (chauri\u00e1r bh\u00e1t aval) requires to be left fallow occasionally.\n\nThe dorus soil is most prevalent in the south and west, the bh\u00e1t in the centre and east, and the mattiy\u00e1r in the north of the district. In the centre and south-east the more sandy soil crops up in the bh\u00e1t, and rises in some places into the sandhills before alluded to. The mattiy\u00e1r soil in some parts is called karela, a name properly applicable only to a very stiff clay which can be dug up in large clods, and does not crumble like most other soils. \"Whenever,\" says Mr. Swinton, \"excavations are made, the sand formation below the superimposed stratum of culturable soil is sooner or later met with. The depth of both strata varies very much in different localities.\"\u00b3\n\nThere is very little \u00fasar in the district, though some is met with in the south. In the north there are some extensive swamps, and in Tilpur, Bin\u00e1yakpur, and the extreme north of Haveli,\n\n\u00b9 Dorus is near the Gh\u00e1g\u00e1ra usually known as banjar. In this locality it rises up towards the high bank of the Gh\u00e1g\u00e1ra, having been raised by the sandy deposit left after each successive foundation (Swinton's Manual, page 30.)\n\n\u00b2 On the west of the Little Gandak a number of small eminences crop up in the bh\u00e1t soil, formed of silicious soil like dorus.\n\n\u00b3 Manual, page 31. It may be here remarked that Mr. Lumaden was the only officer who at last settlement seems to have made any thorough classification of soils, and even he does not always keep to the natural composition. In the Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur reports Mr. White and Mr. Wynne seem often to take dorus, mattiy\u00e1r, and balua merely as names meaning 1st quality, 2nd quality, &c., and it is not at all to be presumed that what they call balua is really a sandy soil; it may be an inferior mattiy\u00e1r.\nowing to the cold left in the soil by the excessive moisture, a good deal of the land bears virtually only one crop, that of rice. In the south-west, owing to the extensive inundations, some of the land can be sown only with a spring crop, and there is consequently no autumn harvest.\n\nThe forests of the district, still very extensive, were a few years ago enormous; but the land they cover is chiefly culturable and often particularly good. From the historical sketch of the district hereafter given, it will seem probable that, owing to the long struggle between Bhars and invading Aryans, but little land was left free of jungle on the final subjugation of the former. The south-west was cleared by the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r R\u00e1jas; Chill\u00fap\u00e1r by them and R\u00e1ja Bern\u00e1th\u2019s descendants; and Salempur by the Majhauli R\u00e1jas. Between the latter and the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r R\u00e1ja\u2019s territory was left a broad fringe of jungle which extended along the R\u00e1pti, covering the greater portion of Silhat and Haveli, and remaining unreclaimed, chiefly, no doubt, because it was a bone of long contention between the Sat\u00e1si and Majhauli R\u00e1jas. Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r and a part of Haveli were brought under cultivation by the former; Anola and Maghar were reclaimed by the descendants of Chandra Sen\u2019s other sons; Bin\u00e1yakpur was brought under partial cultivation during the B\u00fatwal r\u00e9gime, and Tilpur, with part of Sidhua Jobna, by the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. Haveli was almost entirely covered with jungle till about 1600. Its northern and western portions were afterwards largely reclaimed; but the misgovernment of the \u00e1mils between 1750 to 1800 caused the cultivators to abandon their holdings, and the bulk of the parganah was in 1802 covered by jungle. On the rise of the Padrauna tal\u00faka the greater portion of the Sidhua Jobna parganah was in the same state, owing to the ravages of the Banj\u00e1ras and the misgovernment of the \u00e1mils.\n\nAt the time of its cession to the British a very large portion of the district was covered with forest and scrubby undergrowth. The Collector reported that a transit duty on timber had been levied under the preceding Government and brought in considerable sums. The duty was then farmed, and produced during its first year as much as ten thousand rupees for the Gorakhpur, Basti, and Naw\u00e1bganj districts, the wood exported being chiefly sal, which was sent down to Calcutta. About 1829-30, jungle plots were for the first time granted, subject to a progressive demand, which culminated during its tenth year. About 18,000 acres are still held under the terms of these grants on what is really fee-simple tenure. Most of this land lies in the Gorakhpur parganah, and more than half its area is cultivated. Appli-\n\n1 Mr. Routledge, 1802-03.\ncations for such grants soon, however, became so numerous as to excite apprehensions that too large a portion of the land-revenue might become fixed at low rates incapable of enhancement. Government accordingly directed, about the year 1840, that no further grants should be made on such terms. Leases might be granted for periods sufficient to make it worth the grantee's while to clear the land; but on the expiry of those periods the grants must be open to resettlement like other zamindari estates, and also liable to confiscation if the terms of the lease should not have been carried out. The main object of the grants was still to clear the land for cultivation, and a certain amount of land was fixed as the minimum which the grantee must clear if he wished to keep the grant. The amount of acres in any one grant was limited; conditions were also introduced as to sale on transfer and the maintenance of drainage. Still, however, the amount of land held under jungle grants became so large, and the forest was cleared off so rapidly, as to render a scarcity of timber probable. It was deemed more profitable to preserve what was left than to allow its conversion into fields. Accordingly, about 1850, the grants were stopped and all persons were prohibited from cutting wood in the jungles reserved for Government; licenses being, however, granted for the manufacture of charcoal.\n\nThe following list shows the jungle grants existing in the district during 1842:\n\n| Parganah | Acres |\n|----------|-------|\n| Binayakpur | 23,900 |\n|          | Mr. Bridgman | 19,120 |\n|          | Total | 43,020 |\n| Tilpur | 25,336 |\n|          | Mr. Finch | 1,932 |\n|          | Downes | 13,048 |\n|          | Total | 40,316 |\n| Sidhwa Jobna | 23,678 |\n|          | Sym | 22,484 |\n|          | Total | 46,162 |\n| Havelli | 50,800 |\n|          | Debosam | 39,164 |\n|          | Arrouch | 14,140 |\n|          | Campier | 17,624 |\n|          | Fitzgerald | 20,724 |\n|          | Sym | 24,484 |\n|          | Wilkinson | 18,812 |\n|          | McComish | 11,020 |\n|          | Augustin | 11,198 |\n|          | Fitzgerald (R) | 4,714 |\n|          | (A.) | 3,164 |\n|          | Total | 11,484 |\n|          | Total for district | 319,230 |\n\n1 Since 1862, when the new grant rules were passed, grants have been few and far between.\nBetween 1842 and 1850 further plots to the amount of 30,000 acres were granted in Silhat and of 4,000 acres in Sidhua Jobna. At the end of 1872 the area of the various jungle grants and proportion of cultivation in each stood as follows:\n\n| Parganah     | Grant Acres | Cultivated Acres |\n|--------------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Binayakpur   | 43,915      | 26,722          |\n| Tilpur       | 16,999      | 6,197           |\n| Havell       | 210,984     | 107,607         |\n| Sidhua Jobna | 60,024      | 30,015          |\n| Silhat       | 35,024      | 23,943          |\n| **Total**    | **362,035** | **194,414**     |\n\nSince 1872 a further area of 1,330 acres has been granted on leases which will expire in 1922; and arrangements are in progress for a still larger grant (about 5,000 acres) to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bettiah. It will be seen from figures just given that more than half of the entire area has been reclaimed. It has now become so much more profitable to grow timber than to reclaim, that on many of the later grants less than half the land has been cleared; and as Government has recently waived its right to resume solely on the ground that a proper area has not been reclaimed, it is probable that the greater portion of the land now under timber will remain uncleared.\n\nThe reserved forests are situate in 18 isolated blocks standing generally like islands in a sea of cultivation, which runs up into little bays and creeks. The edges of such forests are uneven, and the demarcation has in many cases been clumsily made and imperfectly denoted. A full description of the forests as they then stood is given in Major Pearson's report of 1870. According to this officer, the area is between 120,000 and 130,000 acres, or 190 square miles; and Mr. Colvin, in his letter on the settlement of the district, says 125,000 acres. From the report of the Forest Department for 1876, however, it appears that the area, lately 125 square miles, has been reduced to 115 only. Hence it is clear that the areas above mentioned must include part of the jungle grants or grazing lands not immediately under the Forest Department, and therefore not to be classed as reserved.\n\n---\n\n1 This column does not, like that at p. 277, include the cultivation on fee simple grants.\n2 Here the area had since 1842 diminished, owing partly to the settlement as zamindari estates of such grants as had fallen in, and partly to resumptions on account of rebellion.\n3 Printed in Selections from Government Records, 1870.\nThe discrepancy in the areas given by the Forest Department is perhaps to be explained by the transfer of a large block of forest land to the left bank of the Gandak, and to its annexation by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bettiah, with whom it has recently been settled as a grant. Though there are 18 blocks of Government forest, there are only nine forests shown in the departmental return for 1872, viz.:\n\n(1) Nagw\u00e1n, including blocks I. and VI.\n(2) Son\u00e1ri II. and part of VI.\n(3) Bhar B\u00e1ban VII. and VIII.\n(4) East Lehra III. and V.\n(5) West Lehra X.\n(6) Belimpur IX. and XI.\n(7) Dudhai IV.\n(8) R\u00e1mgarh XIII.\n(9) Tilkonia XII.\n\nDomakand and Bharatkand are not shown, and it was from these forests that the land just mentioned was annexed by the Bettiah chief. The whole area now occupied by forests in the Gorakhpur district may be estimated at about 200,000 acres, or about 313 square miles. In 1860 there were 600,000 acres in Gorakhpur and Basti, and as at least two-thirds of this must have been in Gorakhpur, it will be seen what a large area has been since then reclaimed. It is, however, certain that the area reclaimed since 1860 is small compared to that cleared between the cession of 1801 and that date.\n\nThe income from forests is about Rs. 40,000 yearly, and the net profit after deducting expenses about Rs. 20,000. This income is chiefly derived from the sale of trees felled by the purchasers and of sal logs sawed by the Forest Department. The usufruct of the minor produce, such as firewood, pasture, thatching-grass, and dyes, is usually let for each forest yearly, but yields little profit. A contract for the wild honey is sometimes taken by the Bhar caste. Before the forests were reserved it was a common practice for these people to tap the trees for gum, which sold well; but as it was found to ruin the trees it has been stopped. The forest is composed mostly of sal (Shorea robusta) or s\u00e1khu as this tree is called when young. There are also a large number of mahua (Bassia latifolia), semal (Bombax Malabaricum), and shisham (Dalbergia sissoo) trees. Most of the timber is at present short. The trees are much overgrown with creepers, and too closely planted to admit of proper growth. The existing supply of timber is therefore limited to small beams for building purposes and firewood. Large scantlings, such as those used for the boatman's \"dugouts,\" are as a rule obtained from Nep\u00e1l.\n\n1 The authority is Swinton's Manual\nGovernment Forests.\n\nI.\u2014Nagwan.\nII.\u2014Somari.\nIII.\u2014East Lehra.\nIV.\u2014Dhudhai.\nV.\u2014Do.

This is about 1,300 acres in extent and has been preserved for nearly 70 years. The s\u00e1l wood, of which it mostly consists, is therefore very fine, and the forest highly valuable. Most of the other private forests adjoin or intermingle with those reserved for Government, and having been cut as soon as the trees were worth anything at all, contain mere shrubs. The accompanying map shows roughly the jungles now existing with the changes since 1860, but it is impossible without a regular survey to note the exact changes in the limits of the jungles, and the map does not pretend to any great accuracy. It must be noticed that some portion of the jungle area is overgrown with long grass only, and not by tree or underwood. This is especially the case in the Bin\u00e1yakpur and Tilpur parganahs. Here and there in those parganahs patches of cultivation are dotted over the grass jungle, but the size of the map does not permit of their being shown on it. The existing tree jungle lies chiefly in Haveli and Tilpur, but there is some also in Bin\u00e1yakpur, Silhat, and Padrauna. In Bin\u00e1yakpur still remains a good deal of grass jungle. A description of the pasture land in the north of the district is given under the head of cattle in Part II. of this notice. These pastures generally lie in or around forests.\n\nThere are three great lines of drainage, the two first carrying southwards the surplus waters of the north, the third receiving those waters and conveying them south-eastwards into the Ganges.\n\nThe first line, that of the R\u00e1pti and its tributaries, drains the western half of the district. The watershed between it and the second line, which may be drawn a little east of the boundary between Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur parganahs, passes down through Mans\u00farganj, H\u00e1ta, Deoria, and Barhaj. In the northern portion of this tract is a network of small streams, of which the Rohin, the Gh\u00fanghi, and the Jh\u00e1rri are most important. These carry off the surplus water from the country immediately below the hills, pouring it into the channel of the R\u00e1pti, which carries it down to the Gh\u00e1gra. To the Gh\u00e1gra the R\u00e1pti also conveys the drainage of the centre of the district. The second line, that of the Little Gandak and its affluents, drains all the eastern half of the district, except a small portion of parganah Sidhua Jobna, which inclines towards the Great Gandak. This last-named river may, perhaps, be considered as marking a fourth line of drainage, but affects the Gorakhpur district too little to be classed as one of the principal lines.\nOf these the third is that of the Gh\u00e1gra, running south-eastwards. It drains the south-west corner of this and the south-east of the Basti district, receiving the R\u00e9pti and Little Gandak on its course down to the Ganges.\n\nOne of the distinguishing features in the first tract drained by the R\u00e9pti is the large number of lakes and swamps, and the wide spread of the water overflowing from them and from the streams during the rains. The country in the centre of this line is lower, and the water accumulates therein more than in the other two. The third tract, through which the Gh\u00e1gra flows, is quite different. The country seems to rise towards the banks of the river, and the water flows past rapidly, with none of the stoppages which it encounters on its way down the R\u00e9pti. A more detailed account of the principal rivers may now be given.\n\nThe name of the Rapti originally Iravati, was corrupted by the Muham-\n\nRivers of the district. madans into Rawati, whence its present title (vt-bt-pt).\n\nThe R\u00e9pti. After passing through Oudh and Basti it enters this district in parganah Haveli, near Mogalha. The general direction of its very tortuous course is towards the south-east. It joins the Gh\u00e1gra near Rajpur in tappa Kaparwar, parganah Salempur; and about three miles before the junction it divides into two streams, enclosing an island belonging to Gaura village. The size and velocity of the stream varies considerably. During the rains it is in some places more than a quarter of a mile broad, and runs at about five miles an hour; while during the summer it is as a rule but 100 or 150 yards wide, and travels rather less than two miles an hour. The bed consists of mixed sand and mud. Owing to its extremely winding course, and to the fact that the banks washed by its deep current are usually high and perpendicular, the river does not in most places cause extensive inundations. It nevertheless, by cutting fresh channels, transfers whole villages from one bank to the other, and south of Gorakhpur, where it forms the boundary, from one parganah to another. A precipitous bank on one side of the river is usually faced by a shelving bank on the other. But in some places (e.g. to the west of Gorakhpur) both shores are sloping, and here the river inundates the adjoining country. Such floods are fertilising, and only occasion loss when they retire so late as to prevent the ploughing of the riverside lands. There are a great number of small channels branching from and returning to the stream, but these are dry except in the rains. The chief tributaries of the R\u00e9pti in this district are the Ghunghi, Dhamela, Rohin, Taraina, Ami, Pharend, and Majhna.\nIn the rains the surface of the river rises so considerably that these streams are stopped or thrust back to overflow their banks. The Domingarh and Ami\u00e1r lakes are thus formed by the stoppage of the Rohin and Ami respectively. In the rains, boats of from 2,000 to 3,000 maunds\\(^1\\) burthen ply on the stream as far as its junction with the Dhamela.\\(^2\\) In the hot weather, boats of 300 maunds\\(^3\\) can navigate it to the same distance, and boats of 1,000\\(^4\\) maunds as far as Gorakhpur. The formation of its banks discourages its use for purposes of irrigation.\n\nMr. Lumsden (Settlement Report) mentions that in 1864 the volume of the stream suddenly decreased so greatly as to excite fears that, except in the rains, it would no longer remain navigable for boats of any size. This decrease, which arose from the formation of a new channel in the Basti district, was however only temporary, and next year the stream flowed as before.\\(^5\\) The chief places of importance on the river are Gorakhpur, Gajpur, Kotha, Kaparw\u00e1r, Barhaj, and R\u00e9jpur. These are all market towns, Gorakhpur and Barhaj being the most important. There are bridges of boats at Bird gh\u00e1t and Bhan\u00e1p\u00e1r gh\u00e1t; but during the rains the former bridge is removed and a ferry takes its place. Nadua is another gh\u00e1t lying within the jurisdiction of the sadr tahsil. K\u00e1rmaini gh\u00e1t lies within that of Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj at the mouth of the Dhamela. The water of the stream is not very clear, as it bears in solution a good deal of mud. Its temperature is high.\n\nThe river is of immense importance as a means for carrying cheaply, safely, and quickly the large export trade in grain and wood from Nep\u00e1l and the north of this district down to Gorakhpur, and thence into the Gh\u00e1gra and Ganges.\n\n(1) The Gh\u00fanghi n\u00e1di.\u2014Rising in the Nep\u00e1l hills, the Gh\u00fanghi flows south-westwards till it joins the Dhamela in two branches near Sikra and Giroi respectively. Its deep and well-defined bed serves for some miles as the boundary, first between Gorakhpur and Nep\u00e1l, and again between Gorakhpur and Basti. The stream, which is clear, with a sandy bed, runs very rapidly in the rains, and at a medium pace during the cold and hot weather. It abounds with n\u00e1ks or crocodiles. In the rains it presents a serious obstacle to travellers, but soon afterwards becomes fordable in most places. The water, escaping through its\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) From 71 to 107 tons.  \n\\(^2\\) From this point to near Bans\u00ed it is a small stream, only 20 or 30 feet in width, during the cold and hot weather. It some years ago threw out into the Basti district a branch which diverted the greater part of its waters from the old channel. The latter, to which the stream has never reverted, still exists to show how fine a river it must once have borne.  \n\\(^3\\) Between 10 and 11 tons.  \n\\(^4\\) Between 35 and 36 tons.  \n\\(^5\\) This was entirely owing to the increase which took place in the volume and size of the Dhamela, a fact which seems to prove that the water which before found its way down the channel of the R\u00e1pti has been diverted in Basti to that of the former river. The old channel, as before mentioned, has remained almost dry.\ncollateral channels, often works a good deal of mischief. The stream is not navigable, but timber is sometimes floated down it. It has several tributaries which serve to irrigate the ricefields of parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur. Chief of these are the Danda and the Gh\u00e1gra, both of which have steep banks, are infested by nd\u00e1s, and in the rains are considerable streams. There are no towns of importance on the Gh\u00fanghi in this district.\n\n(2) The Dhamela.\u2014The Dhamela, though it has but a short course in this district, is of considerable importance. On entering from Basti it is joined by the Ghunghi near Sikra and Giroi, and there divides; its smaller branch flowing southwards and joining the R\u00e9pti in the Basti district, the larger running south-eastwards and joining it some 70 miles further down its course, just above K\u00e1rmaini gh\u00e1t. The Dhamela is here much the fuller and finer stream of the two,\u00b9 and is on this branch never fordable. Boats of from 200 to 300 maunds\u00b2 burthen can navigate it during the entire year. The banks are as a rule high and abrupt. Here and there eddies or small whirlpools (bhaur), similar to those in the Great Gandak, are met with; but navigation is safe. In the rains the river floods a large part of the adjoining country, and often does mischief by sweeping away crops or boundary marks and preventing cultivation. The deposit left (partly sand and partly mud) does more harm than good, and the proprietors of the villages between the Dhamela and the R\u00e9pti complain of its effects. The banks in the hot weather are very steep, and the rise of the river in the rains is more than 20 feet above its summer level. The current is then very powerful, and the volume of water must be enormous. Dh\u00e1ni or Kh\u00e1nap\u00e1r B\u00e1z\u00e1r, one of the great grain marts of this district, lies a short distance east of this stream. N\u00e1ks and porpoises are common, as are rohu and the other ordinary river fish (vide list in Part II). The Government ferries are at K\u00e1rmaini gh\u00e1t and Magarha, and a private ferry at K\u00e1nap\u00e1r is of some importance.\n\n(3) The Rohin.\u2014The Rohin enters this district from Nep\u00e1l in parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur East, and passing through parganah Haveli, joins the R\u00e9pti below Domingarh, at the western end of the city of Gorakhpur. It is joined in the north by the Bhagela nadi. For about 15 miles northwards from its junction with the R\u00e9pti it is navigable throughout the year by vessels of 100 maunds burthen, and in the rains for some 15 miles higher. It is not fordable, even in summer, for 25 miles above Gorakhpur. The current is sluggish. In the north the banks are\n\n\u00b9 The parganah map of last settlement does not seem quite correct here, neglecting to mark with sufficient clearness the main stream of the Dhamela.\n\u00b2 Between 7 and 11 tons.\nsteep and well marked, but after it enters Haveli Gorakhpur they are usually sloping. It is joined in this parganah by a considerable tributary from the north-east, the Piy\u00e1s or Jh\u00e1rri, which also rises in Nep\u00e1l. Floods are rare, but at the point where it joins the R\u00e1pti there is a large tract of lowlying land, which is completely submerged in the rains; and it is chiefly owing to the rise of this river and a small stream near it that the Dom\u00edngarh and K\u00e1rmaini lakes to the west of Gorakhpur are formed. The Bhagela and Jh\u00e1rri are in the rainy season swift, strong streams, and serve to carry off the water which would otherwise accumulate below the hills. Both have high well-defined banks, and after the rains become shallow, sluggish streams easily forded. The colour and temperature of the water varies according to the time of year. In the summer it is clear and cold, being supplied in great measure by the melted snow from the hills; in the rains it is discoloured and warmer. Passing as it does through the large forest in parganahs Haveli and Bin\u00e1yakpur, it is extensively used for floating down timber. There are no places of commercial importance on its banks, and it carries little trade north of M\u00e1nir\u00e1m.\n\n(4) The T\u00fara n\u00e1di.\u2014The T\u00fara nadi rises in tappa \u00danti, parganah Haveli Gorakhpur, and falls into the R\u00e1pti near Bel\u00edp\u00e1r, below Gorakhpur. It is as small in size as importance.\n\n(5) The \u00c1mi.\u2014Rising from a small lake in Basti, the \u00c1mi enters this district near R\u00e1mpur village, at the junction of tappas Bharsand and Bhaduseri (parganah Maghar). It flows first eastwards, then south-east, dividing the parganah from Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r, and eventually joins the R\u00e1pti near Sohgaura in tappa Garmahi (parganah Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r). Except during the rains, it is, though deep in some places, a narrow, sluggish stream. Its waters are extensively used for irrigation, and the fishing in it is very valuable, rohu and similar river fish being abundant. The bed is muddy. In the rains the river rises and causes extensive inundations. Between it and the R\u00e1pti there is a ridge of high ground, and again on the west another ridge capped by B\u00e1nsgaon. Between them is a plain known as the Ami\u00e1r T\u00e1l; and the whole of this is in the rains one vast sheet of water, stretching for six or seven miles on either side of the Tucker embankment, and on a rough windy day resembling a small sea covered with white-crested waves. The river is bridged by the embankment just mentioned, and again near Chittai; also at Maghar in the Basti district. During the rains boats of 10Q maunds burthen can navigate it; but the course of the stream being difficult to follow owing to floods, and sunken trees being numerous, the navigation is\n\n1 Where a fine embankment, pierced by seven arches, bears across the Azamgarh road.\nattended with some risk. The subsiding waters of the stream leave behind them very little deposit; but such as is left is fertilizing loam, and the crops grown thereon are exceptionally good. The water is described as rather turbid and warm.\n\n(6) The Majhna.\u2014The Majhna rises from a pond east of Pipr\u00e1\u00edch (parganah Haveli), and flowing southwards through the forest, joins the R\u00e1pti near Majharia of tappa Nagwa Tikari in Silhat. Both in volume and other respects the stream is insignificant. At Rudarpur its name is changed to Bathua; at Surya, tappa Madanpur, it is joined by the Kurna nadi, and by the Kunhi near its junction with the R\u00e1pti. Both these tributaries are small summer-dried streams which, except for irrigation, are of no importance.\n\n(7) The Pharend.\u2014The sources of the Pharend must be found near Pipr\u00e1\u00edch in Haveli Gorakhpur, whence the stream flows almost due south to meet the R\u00e1pti. In the rains its size is considerable; but during the rest of the year it is narrow, shallow, sluggish, and fordable in almost all places. It is an irrigating, but not a navigable stream. Its name is derived from the pharend trees on its banks. It joins the Majhna on the border of Silhat, and their united stream flows into the R\u00e1pti under the name of the Bathua nadi.\n\n(8) The Taraina nadi.\u2014Rising from T\u00e1l Sonda in tappa Bankata (parganah Anola), and flowing in a south-easterly direction, the Taraina enters the north of the Bhenri T\u00e1l in parganah Chill\u00fap\u00e1r, whence it, or rather another stream bearing the same name, passes into the R\u00e1pti. The banks are as a rule sloping. The water is much used for irrigation. In the hot weather the stream almost dries up, leaving a succession of pools. But in the rains it runs with considerable force, as proved by the fact that in 1871 it swept away the bridge (now replaced) which bore the Benares road across it. It is however fordable, even during the rains, in many places. There are no n\u00e1ks in this stream, and it is not navigable. It has one tributary, the Silni or Gangri nadi, which rising in tappa P\u00e1li, parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, flows southeast to join the Taraina in tappa Majuri, near Maktop\u00e1r. This muddy-bedded stream is used for irrigation, but dries in summer; it is not navigable and can always be forded. It is called the Silni as far as Kanwadi in tappa Gagaha, and thence to its junction with the Taraina, the Gangri.\n\n1 Elsewhere called j\u00e1man (Eugenia jambolana).\nThe Great Gandak or Narayani, known in Nep\u00e1l as the Saligr\u00e1mi, rises amongst the hills of the latter country and forms the north-east boundary of this district. Its course is, generally speaking, south-easterly, and it joins the Ganges opposite the opium storehouse at Patna. The Gandak itself forms the district boundary for a very short distance only, turning eastward at the north-east corner of tappa Batsara into Lower Bengal. It again, however, touches the district at the south-east corner of parganah Sidhua Jobna, where it skirts the Bank Jogni tappa. Between this point and that where it again turns into Bengal the boundary is partly formed by a branch which there is good reason to believe was not along ago the main stream. Where it first enters British territory its bed is stony and the stream itself clear and rapid. The banks are high and the body of water even at the end of the hot weather very large. The Great Gandak is never fordable, and boats of 800 maunds' burthen can navigate it throughout the year. Owing, however, to the force of the stream and swirl of the so-called whirlpools (bhaur) caused by irregularities in the river bed, navigation is somewhat dangerous. Timber rafts from Nep\u00e1l are frequently broken up and boats upset. Snags are also not uncommon and increase the perils of the stream. The branch before referred to, while resembling in some respects the main stream, has lower banks and frequently cuts itself new channels, to the great loss and discouragement of the neighbouring cultivators. Mr. Lumsden observes that its influence on cultivation is on the whole injurious. Floods, however, very rarely occur; and as the deposits of the stream are chiefly sand, the fact need not be regretted. This offshoot rejoins the Gandak north of the Bank Jogni tappa, and henceforward the stream appears to be confined to one channel and does little mischief. Wood, grain, and sugar are the chief commodities borne by this river. The first comes from Nep\u00e1l, and the second mostly from British territory, while the third is the native chini manufactured in parganah Sidhua Jobna.\n\nCrocodiles, porpoises, and several kinds of fish abound, and the latter are caught in large numbers. The mah\u00e1s\u00e9r (Barbus mosal) is occasionally captured. The sand of the river is washed for the particles of gold which have found their way down from the hills.\n\nThe river is not much used for irrigation, chiefly because the soil near it is naturally moist (bh\u00e1t). Situated beside it are two marts, viz., Gola Pipragh\u00e1t on the main stream and Sahibganj on the branch in tappa Bank Jogni.\n\n1 Perhaps because ammonite fossils (Valigr\u00e1mi) are found along its banks. Amongst Hind\u00fas ammonites are revered as symbols of Vishnu. The other name of the river, Narayani, is derived from one of the numerous titles of that god. 2 Between 28 and 39 tons. 3 The stream flowing through the old channel has steadily diminished till now; it completely dries up in the hot weather. In the rains it is navigable by vessels of 10 or 11 tons.\nThere are ferries at Parsoni gh\u00e1t, Madhub\u00e1ni, Gola Pipragh\u00e1t, and Bansi gh\u00e1t near Padrauna. Two rivers, the Sonmati and Banmati, are said to join it about 14 miles above the frontier, at a spot where there is an annual fair in M\u00e1gh (January-February). It has in this district no important tributary. The water is clear, and from its depth has in many places a bluish hue. The temperature of the stream is cool, owing perhaps to the snow water it receives from the hills.\n\nFrom its source in the Chiriagora tappa, the Jh\u00e1rahi passes southwards into the S\u00e1ran district, forming lower in its course the extreme eastern boundary of parganah Salempur, and ultimately joining the Gh\u00e1gra. The stream is of considerable use for irrigation, and its piscatory is of some value. In the rains it flows with considerable force, but on their close slackens gradually until at the beginning of the hot weather its water is almost stagnant. The stream is considered injurious to health, and a dangerous kind of malaria often attacks strangers who halt near it for any length of time.\n\nLike the Jh\u00e1rahi, the B\u00e1ndi n\u00e1la has several branches which unite at the north of tappa S\u00e1ndi. It is a running stream only for a few months in the year, and soon after the conclusion of the rains is dammed up for purposes of irrigation. In the hot weather it dries up. It joins the Khanua in tappa Kh\u00e1n.\n\nKnown of yore as the Sarju, the Gh\u00e1gra or Dehwa flows along the southern boundary of the district. Entering the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r parganah at Majd\u00edp of tappa Beligh\u00e1t, and passing eastwards with a slight inclination to the south, it at length issues into the S\u00e1ran district of Lower Bengal. The stream is rapid in the rains, and flows about two miles an hour at the beginning of the hot weather. Steamers can navigate it during the rains, and boats of 1,000 maunds\u00b2 burthen throughout the year. The bed is sandy, and the breadth of the stream varies considerably according to the season. The main stream has been made the boundary between Gorakhpur and Azamgarh, but its shifting cause frequent transfers of villages from one district to the other. The main stream is said about 20 years ago to have joined the Ku\u00e1na, west of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, in the parganah of that ilk, but now flows considerably further to the south. A branch which the river threw out in 1872 adopted as its bed the old channel, and it was anticipated that the main stream would revert to the same course; but that anticipation\n\n\u00b9 In the south-east corner of the district it has during the last year or two shifted its course slightly to the east.\n\u00b2 Between 85 and 96 tons.\nhas not yet been justified by facts. The floods, which seldom though sometimes take place, serve but to injure the neighbouring crops, as the riverside is already watered amply from tanks and wells, and the deposit left is sandy. The R\u00e1pti joins the Gh\u00e1gra near R\u00e1jpur, and the Little Gandak further east. These streams and the Ku\u00e1na are the only important tributaries from this district. The banks marking the usual limits of the stream in the rains are high and sharply defined, and it is only between them that the breadth of the stream varies at the different times of year. When after the rains the river subsides, numerous chars, or islets of sand, appear in the channel, which becomes tortuous and in some places rather shallow. Country boats of the largest burden can, however, always ply the stream, which is never fordable. The chief market villages on its banks are Barhalganj, R\u00e1jpur, Bh\u00e1galpur, M\u00e1il Kh\u00e1s, and Nari\u00e1n. One of the most important marts in the district, Barhaj, stands a little way inland from the river above R\u00e1jpur. It was formerly situated on the river bank; but the R\u00e1pti having shifted slightly to the east, and the Gh\u00e1gra slightly to the southwest, the town now stands on a channel of the former. An immense trade in grain, principally from Barhalganj and Barhaj, is carried down the river to the Ganges.\n\nThere are ferries at (1) Kamharia gh\u00e1t, (2) R\u00e1ja Sultanpur, (3) Chapri, (4) Sahia gh\u00e1t, (5) Poila R\u00e1mpur, (6) Duhuja Khair\u00e1ti, (7) Barhalganj, (8) R\u00e1jpur, (9) Paina, and (10) Bh\u00e1galpur and M\u00e1il. In colour the water is rather opaque, containing a considerable solution of sandy mud.\n\nThe Ku\u00e1na rises in Oudh, enters this district in parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, and flows into the Gh\u00e1gra at Marhundia. Its name is said to be derived from the fact that its first source is a well (k\u00fala). Some years ago, when reinforced in Basti by branches of the Gh\u00e1gra, it was during its course in Gorakhpur a deep navigable stream. But by a southward movement of the former river the volume of the Ku\u00e1na was greatly diminished. In 1872 the Ku\u00e1na was again swollen by two branches of the Gh\u00e1gra, and increased so greatly in depth and volume as to be nowhere fordable in parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r; its capacity for navigation was thus of course greatly enhanced, and if the volume of water continues as at present, boats of 500 maunds\\(^1\\) or more will throughout the year be able to navigate the stream for some distance above Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r. Mr. Lumsden notices a similar enlargement of this stream by a branch of the Gh\u00e1gra in 1855, the result then being a considerable amount of diluvion. At present floods are rare, but the stream has cut numerous deep channels along its shores.\n\n\\(^1\\) Nearly 18 tons barthen.\nThe banks of the stream are steep and in the hot weather high. The current is slow and the bed sandy. Tikua B\u00e1z\u00e1r, Sikr\u00edganj, Gaurganj, Dhuri\u00e1-p\u00e1r, Sh\u00e1hpur, and Gola are places of some size on its banks. At Tikua, Gaurganj, and Gola markets are held. There is a Government ferry at Benri, and numerous private ferries for foot passengers at intervals of two or three miles.\n\nDescending from the Nep\u00e1l hills, the Little Gandak flows southwards till it joins the Gh\u00e1gra at Simaria, just within the S\u00e1ran district. It is often mistaken for a branch of the Great Gandak, but is really quite distinct, entering Gorakhpur to the west of that stream. For three months of the year, i.e., from the middle of July to the middle of October, it can be navigated by boats of 100 maunds burthen. But its volume and current, then considerable, decrease rapidly after the close of the rains; and it soon becomes a small stream, not more than 20 yards across, sluggish, and in most places fordable. The water contains a calcareous deposit which is said to be a frequent cause of goitre amongst those who drink it, and the soil along the stream is mostly bh\u00e1di, which is largely composed of chalk. Raggarganj, Captainganj, and Hetimpur are b\u00e1z\u00e1rs of some importance on its banks. Those banks are as a rule high and well defined, yet not so high as to prevent the frequent use of the water in irrigation. They are connected by Government ferries at Guria, Hetimpur, and Captainganj. A small branch known as the Khanua n\u00e1la leaves this stream near Hetimpur, and passes south-eastwards into S\u00e1ran. But, except as the boundary between parganahs Sidhua Jobna and Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1hanpur, and an occasional source of irrigation, this offshoot is of no importance.\n\nThe Dur\u00e1nchi is connected with the Mohan, a small stream which, rising west of Biraicha, flows south-eastwards as far as tappa Parw\u00e1rpar, where one branch joins the Dur\u00e1nchi and another the Little Gandak. The latter branch forms the northern boundary of parganah Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1hanpur and effects its junction near Hetimpur. Except during the rains, the Mohan is a mere rivulet. The Dur\u00e1nchi forms the border between the Silhat and Sh\u00e1jh\u00e1hanpur parganahs, joining the Little Gandak at the south-east corner of tappa Patna. When the rainfall is unusually heavy, and the Little Gandak rises so as to block their streams, these two rivers rise and inundate the neighbouring country. By such floods the sugarcane crop is damaged and a sandy deposit left to mar the soil.\n\nThe Chillua rises in the centre of tappa Katahra, parganah Haveli. Flowing south-westwards, it widens out into the Chillua lake, which is also connected with the Rohin. The stream\nflows for some distance through the forest, and is hardly of much importance. In the rains it used formerly to obstruct traffic on the Rigoli and Captainganj road, which it now, however, crosses on an embankment pierced by bridges.\n\nWith the numerous streams which flow through or by this district cases of alluvion and diluvion are necessarily numerous; but there appear to be no special local rules for settling disputes between the proprietors. Some of the large landowners, such as the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bettiah, the R\u00e1ja of Tamkubi, and one or two others, decide all such questions amongst themselves on the principle that if the changes made are not of much importance, the deep-stream rule prevails and fixes the boundary. If, on the other hand, the lands transferred by this rule are of considerable extent, the line laid down in the revenue survey map is restored as nearly as possible. Speaking generally, the deep-stream rule is observed throughout the district. In old days, any dispute on such a point between the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs of different villages would have been referred to the local R\u00e1ja, and a dispute between two R\u00e1jas would probably have been fought out. The larger rivers being usually the boundaries of the various principalities the deep-stream rule naturally obtained, as it would have been difficult for one R\u00e1ja to hold a small plot of land touching his neighbour's territory while severed from his own by a broad river.\n\nThere are at present no canals in the district, either for navigation or irrigation; and indeed the necessity for their construction is removed by a network of rivers. In 1859 Mr. Bird, the Collector, proposed to convert the Little Gandak into a canal for commercial purposes; and Mr. Lumsden, in his settlement report, approves of the suggestion, and says that the levels are favourable for the purpose. No steps, however, have as yet been taken towards carrying out the idea, and it is doubtful if much necessity exists for doing so. Some of the numerous streams in the north of the district, such as the Danda, the Gh\u00fanghi, the Gh\u00e1gra, and the Rohin, might easily be rendered navigable by a succession of locks with weirs sufficient to allow the rush of water in the rains to escape. But until this portion of the district has much advanced the undertaking would be unprofitable. Running as it does by Lotan and near B\u00fatwal, the Gh\u00fanghi offers, if thus treated, the best chance of financial success. In this part of the district there are, moreover, no good roads; but the sincere co-operation of the Nep\u00e1l Government, so necessary in the construction of a northern-frontier canal, is hardly to be expected.\nThe lakes of Gorakhpur are numerous\u2014so numerous that only those conspicuous for their size, position, fisheries, or other qualities, can be noticed here. Such lakes may be divided into those that are perennial, those which alternate from a sheet of water in the rains to a swamp at other seasons, and those which the summer leaves completely dry.\n\nTo begin with those that are perennial:\n\nThe Nandaur T\u00e1l in tappa Kasba, parganah Bhau\u00e1pur, lies near the Benares road, about 6 miles south of Gorakhpur, and is some 2\u00bd miles in length by half a mile in breadth. In its deepest parts it has during the hot weather about 25 feet of water. The rains seem little to affect the size of the lake, which always contains a copious supply of water noticeable for its extreme clearness. It is plentifully stocked which rohu and other fish, while its waters are used for irrigation.\n\nThe R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r T\u00e1l at Kasia is about half a mile long by a quarter mile broad. In the rains its length extends to a whole, and its breadth to half a mile; but in the summer these dimensions sink to about half a mile and 250 yards in breadth respectively. The average depth in the rains is about 12 feet, and in the hot weather 5. The lake is never dry. The water is used, although not extensively, in irrigation; and the fishing is valuable, letting for about Rs. 200 a year. It is chiefly remarkable on account of the Buddhist remains on its banks. These stand at the north-west corner of the lake, and consist of a lofty mound of solid brickwork now known as Devisth\u00e1n, an oblong mound crowned by a brick stupa,\u00b9 and a colossal statue of Buddha, lying a short distance apart from a small ruined building which was probably a shrine. To these remains some further reference will be made in the Gazetteer portion of the notice.\u00b2\n\nTo the north of the H\u00e1ta road is a smaller lake, communicating with the R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r T\u00e1l by two channels, over which bridges have been constructed. In the rains the water flows from this t\u00e1l with considerable force towards the R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r lake, and sometimes cuts the road. The R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r lake then rises and overflows towards the south-east, laying the Barhaj road for some distance under water. The Little Gandak is said to have once flowed by the more westerly of the two channels mentioned above.\n\nWe now come to the second class of lakes, which during summer degenerate into swamps.\n\n\u00b9 i.e. relic-temple. \u00b2 Article \"Kassia.\"\nThe R\u00e1mgarh Jhil, near Gorakhpur, is about 2 miles long by 1\u00bd broad. The bulk of its surface after the rains is covered by tall reeds, and presents the appearance of a dismal swamp. Passages are cut through the reeds for the fishermen's boats. Rohu and other fish are caught in large numbers, and the fishing, which is leased out by the proprietor, is valuable. In the rainy season the water rises 20 feet or more and covers the reeds. The lake is then a large unbroken sheet of water at least 5 miles in length by 3 in breadth. Immediately after the close of that season the water begins to recede, and the rices, dhan and boro, are largely grown on the land thus cleared for cultivation. In the rains some parts of the lake are 40 feet deep, but in summer none are above 20. The influence of the R\u00e1mgarh swamp on the health of those living near it is said to be decidedly deleterious, causing bad fever and malaria. Two or three channels branch forth from it. It is connected with another jhil of considerable extent, the N\u00e1rh\u00e1i T\u00e1l, which like it is covered with reed and thorny plants. After the rains the latter t\u00e1l dries up in many places, leaving detached pieces of water.\n\nThe surplus waters of the N\u00e1rh\u00e1i T\u00e1l are drained into the R\u00e1pti by the Gora brook. In the rains this is a stream of some size and affords ample means for communication, but at other seasons it scarcely runs at all and cannot be navigated, except by the smallest boats. A succession of little ponds linked together by the Gora form a chain between the N\u00e1rh\u00e1i T\u00e1l and the R\u00e1pti. Below the water in both the Narhai and R\u00e1mgarh jhil lies a deep mud. This when deserted by the waters and exposed to the sun grows hard and firm enough to support a man walking on it, but when covered or just left by water is soft and as dangerous to tread on as a quicksand. The drying of this mud and the stagnant nature of the swamp, except in the rains, are probably the cause of the malaria before mentioned. Crocodiles are common in the R\u00e1mgarh, but not in the Narhai T\u00e1l. Two or three offshoots from the R\u00e1pti join these lakes; and in the rains the river deposits through these offshoots large quantities of loam, by which the R\u00e1mgarh T\u00e1l is being gradually silted up. The water, it is said, has receded two or three hundred yards towards the east in the last ten years. Very probably the R\u00e1pti originally traversed the present site of Gorakhpur city, flowing afterwards through part of the R\u00e1mgarh jhil and the channel of the Gora. In this case it has gradually receded westward, raising the broad embankment of rich earth which now separates it from the swamp and the brook. Peas, linseed, mustard, wheat, and melons are grown on the more elevated portions of the land overlooking the water.\n\n1 See Dr. Planck's Sanitary Report, 1871.\nThe size of the Bhewri T\u00e1l, in tappa Sikandarpur of parganah Chill\u00fa-p\u00far, varies very much according to the season of the year.\n\nIn the rains it is a great sheet of water five miles long and three or four broad, but at their close it sinks rapidly, until at the end of summer it is about only one in length and about half that distance in breadth. The depth differs considerably, the greatest in the rains being 20, and in the summer 10 feet. The suson weed grows in abundance on the ground left dry by the receding water, and is used as fodder for cattle; rice is sown in considerable quantities along the edge of the lake. Here shells (sipi) are found from which mortar is made. The Tarjina joins the lake at its north-west corner and helps to fill it in the rains; while a branch of that lake stretches to the east, and in the same season shoots forth a stream to join the R\u00e1pti. It is said that when Raja Bern\u00e1th invaded Chill\u00fap\u00e1r he was for a long time unable to take a castle which stood on an island in the south-west of the lake. At length a fisherman pointed out to him that he could drain off part of the water into the R\u00e1pti. Acting on this advice he dug the channel through which the stream above mentioned flows, and was then able to cross to the island and storm the fort. But though the channel may have been deepened or widened by the R\u00e9ja, it is undoubtedly natural. The fishing is of some value and is let by the proprietors to boatmen who come from a distance. The usual arrangement is that the lessees shall pay half of what they catch to the landlord. When the rains are at all excessive the R\u00e1pti and Gh\u00e1gra are united through this t\u00e1l, which is then nearly 8 miles in length.\n\nThe Chillua T\u00e1l lies north of Gorakhpur city, at the east of tappa Mar\u00e1che Chandur. This lake is formed by the Chillua river, and till a few years ago was completely surrounded by thick jungle. The land to the south, however, has now been cultivated. To the north, northeast, and west there is still jungle, which near the water consists of cane and thorn-bushes, but further inland of s\u00e1l trees. The breadth of the lake varies greatly, not only according to the season of year, but from one place to another, being at some points half a mile and at others 50 or 60 yards only. At most seasons a current flows through it towards the Rohin; but in the rains, when this stream is blocked by the R\u00e1pti, it in turn obstructs the Chillua, which then overflows, filling the Chillua T\u00e1l, flooding the neighbouring country, and mingling its water southwards with those of the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n\u00ed lake. On the southern edge of the Chillua T\u00e1l the subsiding waters are succeeded by boro rice, and a considerable quantity of land reclaimed from the jungle is now sown with a spring crop watered from\n\n---\n\n1 Not to be confused with sarson (mustard).  \n2 Certain boatmen (Mall\u00edhe), calling themselves heirs of the fisherman here mentioned, have still rights of the fishing in the lake.\nthe lake itself. The fishing is valuable, but as usual is rather overcrowded by\nthe boatmen who rent it from the proprietors.\n\nThe last class of lakes are those which disappear with the approach of\nsummer. The Amiar T\u00e1l, in tappas Kasw\u00e1si and Pach\u00edse of\nparganahs Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r, exists only in the rainy season, when in\nconjunction with the Bijra T\u00e1l it extends for some miles on either side of\nthe Tucker embankment. It is formed by the overflowing of the \u00c1mi and sinks\nrapidly at the end of the rains, leaving bare a soil which produces excellent\ncrops. Boro is planted close to the river, where the mould remains sodden for\nsome times. Further from the bank peas are extensively sown, while barley and\nother spring crops are raised at the extreme edge furthest from the river. In\nsome rare years, when the rainfall has been heavy and the current of the \u00c1mi\nstrong, the river brings down a sterilizing deposit of sand.\n\nThe Domingarh and K\u00e1rmaini lakes on the outskirts of tappas Kasba\nand Gura in pargana Haveli, are formed, as before stated, by\nthe rise of the Rohin and a small stream to the west of Go-\nrakhpur. The former lake is about 2 miles in length and 1\u00bd in breadth; the\nlatter is larger. They are separated by some rising ground which becomes an\nisland in the rains.\n\nThe K\u00e1rmaini lake when at its greatest height extends north-west for five\nor six miles; but a considerable part of it is covered by trees and is rather shal-\nlow. The shores are lined by fine groves, which with their trees partly sub-\nmerged lend a very picturesque aspect to the lake. One or two small streams\nconnect it with the R\u00e1pti. At the end of the monsoon the lakes rapidly sub-\nside, and in a month are dry. Great quantities of tall khar and some vernal\ncrops are produced on the land thus uncovered. There is a current through\nthe lakes from north to south, occasioned by the tendency of the water to flow\ninto the R\u00e1pti, which eventually drains it off.\n\nThe Nawar T\u00e1l, in tappa Reh of parganah Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r, is during the\nrains rather over 2 miles in length and about 1\u00bd of a mile in breadth. But at\ntheir conclusion it dries up almost entirely, only a few pools being left.\nBoro and spring crops are sown on the lately submerged soil, which is watered\nfrom the lake itself.\n\nThe Ramkola Jhil in tappa P\u00e1pur of parganah Sidhua Jobna, lies south-\neast of the Ramkola, from which it derives its name. This is during the\nrains a very large oval sheet of water, communicating with the B\u00e1nde n\u00e1la.\nThe soil when relinquished by the water acquires sufficient consistency to be\ncapable of being dug with a spade, and resembles in appearance a stiff clay.\nIt retains too much moisture to produce first-rate spring crops, and is even said to be unsuited for the thirsty rice. If the lake could be drained so as to ensure the retirement of its water immediately after the rains, it would probably become highly productive. It is too shallow to sustain many fish, but is frequented by large flocks of wild fowl.\n\nThe lakes and rivers already named are only a few amongst the enormous number existing in the district. Small lakes, and more especially ponds (pokhre), are so numerous that but very little land is irrigated from wells. In a hot dry year, when there is little or no winter rain, disputes sometimes arise as to the use of water, but as a rule there is sufficient for all. In many places, especially in the north and east, no irrigation at all is required, the soil being naturally moist at all seasons. The large rivers of the district are chiefly valuable as affording carriage for the grain and sugar trade, which is very considerable.\n\nNavigation. The ordinary size of vessels employed in this carrying trade is from 200 to 1,000 maunds but then if the grain is to be carried out of the district as far as the Ganges, and from 500 to 2,000 maunds if it is to be carried to Calcutta. Within the district the usual measurement is from 100 to 500 maunds, but boats of only 50 or even 20 maunds are often employed on the Rapti and Dhamela, where the current is sluggish and navigation easy.\n\nThe only evil result of the usual abundance of water is that the people in many places trust almost entirely to the winter rains and natural moisture of the soil for the water required by their crops. They therefore dig few wells, and suffer severely when a year of drought has left them without means of irrigation.\n\nIn the district itself there are no railway stations. The nearest are those at (1) Akbarpur on the Oudh and Rohilkhand line, in the Faizabad district, 68 miles from Gorakhpur; (2) Zamania on the East Indian Line, in the Ghazipur district, 102 miles from Gorakhpur; and (3) Faizabad in the district of the same name on the Oudh and Rohilkhand line, 84 miles from Gorakhpur. The construction of the proposed light railway to Dohrighat in Azamgarh would place a station just outside the district, on the opposite bank of the Ghagra; while that of a similar line to Ghazipur will bring the nearest station of the East Indian Railway some 14 miles nearer Gorakhpur on the south. There used to be telegraphic communi-\n\n---\n\n1 Between 7 and 36 tons.  \n2 Between 17 and 78 tons. These large vessels usually start from Barhaj, the smaller boats being there unloaded and sent back to Gula, Gorakhpur, Dhani, or whatever mart they may ply from.  \n3 Between 3 and 18 tons  \n4 From under 2 to under 1 ton.\ncation between Gorakhpur and Zam\u00e1nia; but this has now been closed for many years. A light field telegraph was constructed during the famine of 1873-74, but afterwards removed.\n\nThere are two metalled roads, viz., (1) that from Gorakhpur to Benares via Barhalganj, of which there are 35 miles within the district; and (2) the Basti and Faizabad road, of which only 15 miles extending to Maghar lie within Gorakhpur. The greater portion of the latter road has been metalled within the last ten years.\n\nIn constructing and maintaining these bridged 1st class roads,\u00b9 the chief difficulties are found in the number of watercourses, streams, and lakes to be crossed. The celebrated Tucker embankment on the Barhalganj line is a wonderful example of such difficulties overcome. Constructed over the Ami\u00e1r and Bigra T\u00e1ls, which, as before mentioned, extend for several miles during the rainy season, it is three miles long, and has two very large, besides two smaller bridges. Before its construction the passage of these lakes in the rains was a tedious and dangerous process, numerous accidents occurring to travellers who were obliged to undertake it. For a considerable distance the sides of the bank are flanked by stonework, to enable it to stand the wash of the water, which on a windy day is very great. Commenced in 1845 and completed some five years later, it was named after Mr. Collector Tucker. An immense amount of convict labour was used in its construction, and, independently of the cost of maintaining these men, Rs. 70,000 were spent on the work. A bridge which conveyed the same road across the Taraina was less successful, being swept away during the rains of 1871 by that usually sluggish stream. It has been replaced by a new girder bridge. On the Basti road the encroachments of the R\u00e1pti are continually threatening, and have sometimes succeeded in cutting away the causeway, with which the stream runs parallel for the first six miles. Two large watercourses, tributary to the same river, are hardly less troublesome, and have on more than one occasion carried away the bridges with which they have been spanned. Mr. Peart has recorded his opinion that a bridge in the embankment bearing a road thus circumstanced is a source of weakness in time of flood, and likely to lead to disaster. The cost of keeping these roads in order had up to 1871 been regulated very much by the annual grant. An organized system of maintenance has now been introduced, and Mr. Peart estimates the rate of repair at about Rs. 300 per mile per annum. That sum includes occasional renewal of metal and repairs to bridges. The traffic on the Barhalganj road is very great, but it is not heavy,\n\n\u00b9 The information regarding roads has been furnished by Mr. Peart, late District Engineer of Gorakhpur.\nthe R\u00e9pti serving for the transmission of most weighty articles. It was metalled for the first time in 1865 at a cost of nearly one lakh of rupees. This highway, which affords throughout the year rapid communication with Benares and Azamgarh, is as important from a military as from a commercial point of view. Extensive repairs were effected during 1873 on the Basti road, and a new embankment was made to remedy the injuries caused by river encroachments. The road was embanked and partly metalled in 1869-70.\n\nThere are 912 miles of earthen or unmetalled roads, whereof almost the whole are tended by the Public Works Department. The only exceptions are the municipal roads in Gorakhpur city and a few other towns where the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX of 1856) has been introduced. Of earthen highways 476 miles are included in the 2nd class\u2014that is; amongst raised and bridged roads.\n\nThe remainder are village roads, usually mere cart tracks, but occasionally bridged. All the principal places are thus connected with each other and the capital, as also with many important towns or villages in adjacent districts. Constant repairs are needed on these roads, owing to the damage done by the rains and to the way in which the sand works up to the surface. The average cost of repairing is about Rs. 30 a mile per annum, but the amount spent varies considerably from one year to another. The following list, while distributing unmetalled roads amongst the 2nd and 3rd classes, shows also the mileage within the district of each line:\n\n### 2nd Class\u2014Raised and Bridged, but Unmetalled Roads.\n\n| Name of line | Mileage within district |\n|--------------|------------------------|\n| Gorakhpur and Lotan | ... 45 |\n| Nichlaval | ... 55 |\n| B\u0101sigh\u00e1t | ... 48 |\n| Sam\u00far | ... 52 |\n| Guntz\u00e1b\u00e1t | ... 61 |\n| R\u00e1ibhangh\u00e1t | ... 36 |\n| Kaurfr\u00e1m and Gola | ... 15 |\n| Sikriganj | L\u00e1rh | ... 56 |\n| Barhaj | Padrauna | ... 48 |\n| Rudrapur | Gola | ... 26 |\n| Captainganj, Karmaingh\u00e1t | ... 34 |\n| Total 2nd class | ... 476 |\n\n### 3rd Class\u2014Unraised Roads with Occasional Bridges and Culverts.\n\n| Name of line | Mileage within district |\n|--------------|------------------------|\n| Captainganj, Nimbus, and Bagha | ... 32 |\n| Sabia | ... 25 |\n| Padranna and Nichlaval | ... 32 |\n| Tiw\u00e1r\u00ed patti | ... 16 |\n| Sam\u00far | ... 22 |\n| Bh\u00e9galpur | Bhingari | ... 30 |\n| Mi\u00e1sela | ... 14 |\n| Nichlaval, Bagapur, and Bansi | ... 36 |\n| Chauparia and Mams\u00e1rganj | ... 25 |\n| Rudarpur and Barhaj | ... 14 |\n| Dhara | ... 27 |\n| Rudarpur and Deoria | ... 7 |\n| Tiw\u00e1r\u00ed patti and Sam\u00far | ... 12 |\n| Kazipur | ... 14 |\n| Kaurfr\u00e1m | Lindia | ... 32 |\n| Pipr\u00e1ich | Barhi | ... 24 |\n| Bagpur | Bagha | ... 38 |\n| Sahujana | Tilaura | ... 11 |\n| Sh\u00e1hpur branch, Rudrapur-Gola road | ... 12 |\n| Mahar\u00e9jganj branch, Gorakhpur-Nichlaval road | ... 3 |\n| Total 3rd class | ... 436 |\nThe difficulty of procuring nodular limestone (kunkur)\\(^1\\) renders it impossible to metal the greater portion of these roads; but numerous bridges and embankments have rendered them most valuable means of communication. Few or perhaps no new roads appear to be called for, but much may yet be done to improve the existing lines, especially in the north of the district.\n\nThe most important of the 2nd class roads are those\u2014(1) from Gorakhpur to Nichlaval; (2) from Gorakhpur to Bettiah via Padrauna and Bansighat; (3) from Gorakhpur to Chapra via Deoria, Lahr, and Ghatnighat; (4) from Barhaj to Padrauna; (5) from Gorakhpur to Samur via Hata and Kasia. The chief efforts of district engineers have of late been devoted to bringing the 2nd class roads into good order, and to making them passable at all times of the year by constructing embankments and bridges. The Deoria, Kasia, and Lotan roads have received special attention, and are now in very good order. Bridges have been constructed on them over the Tura, Majhna, Rohin, Little Gandak, and Dhanus. The Nichlaval road and the road from Rigoli to Captainganj have also been put in order. They are both of considerable importance\u2014the former as the road on which a large part of the rice and sugar trade from the north is brought down to Gorakhpur, the latter as connecting Captainganj with Dhani, Rigoli, and Karmaini gh\u00e1t. Another 2nd class road of importance is that from Sikriganj to Lahr, passing Barhalganj, Barhaj, and Paina. The facilities offered by the different rivers as a means of communication have been noticed above. The extreme north and north-west of the district will soon require something more than the cart tracks which at present serve as roads. The rice and pepper trade of that neighbourhood is becoming very considerable. If the Nep\u00e1l authorities would only consent to facilitate trade between their country and British India, keeping up the roads on their side of the boundary line, a very important trade in rice, timber, iron, and copper might be carried to Gorakhpur either via Tutibhari and Nichlaval or by Lotan or Naikot and Dhani. Even now the trade is large.\n\nThe following tables shows the distances of the principal towns and villages from Gorakhpur.

In the following table is shown its average at the principal stations of the district between 1844-45 and 1849-50:\n\n| Period | 1860-61 | 1861-62 | 1862-63 | 1863-64 | 1864-65 | 1865-66 | 1866-67 | 1867-68 | 1868-69 | 1869-70 |\n|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| 1st June to 30th September | 42\u00b77 | 46\u00b79 | 30\u00b74 | 43\u00b71 | 23\u00b78 | 34\u00b70 | 42\u00b77 | 47\u00b72 | 23\u00b78 | 33\u00b79 |\n| 1st October to 31st January | 4\u00b72 | 10\u00b70 | 2\u00b79 | 8\u00b72 | 8\u00b78 | 1\u00b71 | 9 | 2\u00b75 | 6 | 16\u00b72 |\n| 1st February to 31st May | 9\u00b72 | 8\u00b72 | 9 | 1\u00b76 | 8\u00b71 | 4\u00b72 | 6\u00b78 | 1\u00b79 | 8 | 2\u00b73 |\n\nTotal ... 49\u00b71 60\u00b71 34\u00b72 52\u00b78 39\u00b77 39\u00b78 49\u00b79 51\u00b76 25\u00b72 52\u00b74\n\nand for 1870-71 it was 57\u00b74\n\nUntrustworthy; the variations in different parts of the district are very great.\nThe rainfall in 1873 and again in 1876 has been abnormally small, and figures for previous years have therefore been given. The mean monthly temperature in the shade is about 76\u00b0, averaging from about 60\u00b0 in January to 90\u00b0 in June. How much the climate differs from that of most D\u00fa\u00e1b districts may be proved thus:\n\n**Monthly maximum and minimum average temperature, taken at meteorological observatory of Gorakhpur, from 1873 to 1877.**\n\n| Months | 1873 | 1874 | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 |\n|--------|------|------|------|------|------|\n|        | Average max. | Average min. | Average max. | Average min. | Average max. | Average min. | Average max. | Average min. | Average max. | Average min. |\n| January | 77\u00b0 | 49\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 47\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 48\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 47\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 48\u00b0 |\n| February | 84\u00b0 | 55\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 53\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 54\u00b0 | 88\u00b0 | 51\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 49\u00b0 |\n| March | 89\u00b0 | 62\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 61\u00b0 | 92\u00b0 | 64\u00b0 | 101\u00b0 | 61\u00b0 | 89\u00b0 | 61\u00b0 |\n| April | 100\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 102\u00b0 | 70\u00b0 | 101\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 98\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 | 100\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 |\n| May | 102\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 108\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 95\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 101\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 102\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 |\n| June | 104\u00b0 | 83\u00b0 | 93\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 97\u00b0 | 80\u00b0 | 104\u00b0 | 80\u00b0 | 101\u00b0 | 61\u00b0 |\n| July | 94\u00b0 | 85\u00b0 | 94\u00b0 | 73\u00b0 | 94\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 95\u00b0 | 80\u00b0 | 98\u00b0 | 80\u00b0 |\n| August | 92\u00b0 | 80\u00b0 | 90\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 89\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 91\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 | 92\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 |\n| September | 93\u00b0 | 79\u00b0 | 89\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 92\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 91\u00b0 | 76\u00b0 | 90\u00b0 | 78\u00b0 |\n| October | 92\u00b0 | 66\u00b0 | 89\u00b0 | 71\u00b0 | 97\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 | 86\u00b0 | 67\u00b0 | 90\u00b0 | 68\u00b0 |\n| November | 85\u00b0 | 57\u00b0 | 83\u00b0 | 58\u00b0 | 84\u00b0 | 56\u00b0 | 83\u00b0 | 55\u00b0 | 87\u00b0 | 59\u00b0 |\n| December | 78\u00b0 | 50\u00b0 | 75\u00b0 | 49\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 51\u00b0 | 77\u00b0 | 48\u00b0 | 74\u00b0 | 50\u00b0 |\n\nThe district, being situated near the hills, is not subject to very intense heat, and the abundance of moisture in the soil generally prevents the ground from retaining and giving out that scorching heat which is so distressing in districts like Agra. Dust-storms are very rare, and cool breezes from the north generally follow even short intervals of very hot weather. The climate is, however, relaxing, and the cold weather is not so keen or so bracing as in the North-Western Provinces west of Oudh.\n\n---\n\n1 From her husband's \"camp near Goruckpur,\" a few days before the close of 1837, Mrs. Henry (afterwards Lady) Lawrence writes as follows:\u2014\"For the last two months the weather has been as delightful as you can imagine\u2014the very beau ideal of climate. There has not been a drop of rain since the first week in October. The mornings and evenings are very cold, and all day the air is so cool that we can sit out of doors. I never had such enjoyment of nature. Sometimes our march begins two hours before sunrise, and the starlight mornings with the dawning day are beautiful beyond description. We have been in the northern parts of the district, where it joins the Nep\u00e1l frontier, and where there are long tracts of forest and jungle. The country in which we are is a perfect plain, but we have been in sight of the Himalayas and have had some glorious views of them; the lower range undulating and wooded behind them, the sharp peaks and angular outline of the snowy range looking like opal or mother-of-pearl. I could not have conceived the luxuriance of oriental vegetation till I saw it. The trees are splendid, and in this district very abundant, independently of the forest.\"\u2014*Life of Sir Henry Lawrence*, by Sir Herbert Edwardes and Herman Merivale, C.B. The highest of the snowy mountains seen from Gorakhpur is Dhv\u00e1lagiri. It is probable that since the passage just quoted was written, clearance of forest has much altered the climate.\nbore an unhealthy name, but recent clearances of forest have rendered the south and east of the district quite as salubrious as most places in India. The tarai and existing forest tracts are still, no doubt, highly malarious; and in the northern part of Haveli, in Tilpur and Binayakpur, fever is terribly fatal during the quarter succeeding the close of the rains. The rainfall is generally heavy, and rain about or soon after Christmas is always looked for; indeed, its failure has, as before remarked, an evil effect on the spring harvest. The rains commence about the middle or end of June and last till the middle or end of September.\n\nPART II.\n\nPRODUCTS OF THE DISTRICT, ANIMAL, VEGETABLE, AND MINERAL.\n\nThe wide wastes and forests of the district shelter many wild animals.\n\nWild animals. Through them within 30 years used to roam wild elephants, and tigers and leopards are still pretty common. In 1856, a short time before the rebellion, the mails to Padrauna and the north are said to have been stopped by the tigers which infested the road. These animals still venture sometimes within five miles of the city, and indeed in 1873 the Magistrate shot one within that city itself. Wild pig and deer are plentiful, especially in the north of the district, where the black-buck is found in considerable numbers. The wild buffalo or arna is also met with near the Nep\u00e1l frontier. Poisonous snakes are very common, and the death-rate owing to them is high. The amount of game in the district has much decreased since the mutiny, owing to the clearance of woodland and increase of population. Some trade in deer skins and horns is carried on with the north of the district and Nep\u00e1l.\n\nThe following is a list of the more remarkable animals found in the district:\n\nB\u00e1gh or sher, tiger (Felis tigris), still pretty common.\u00b9\nTendua, leopard or panther (Felis pardus), very common.\nChitta, hunting leopard (Felis jubata).\nBh\u00e1lu or richh, bear (Ursus labiatus), found occasionally on the Nep\u00e1l frontier.\nJangali suar or wild pig (Sus Indicus), very common, especially in thick forest.\n\n\u00b9 A native authority who furnished a list of animals for the Gazetteer states there are four kinds of tigers: (1) the true sher, (2) the gophla, which is very thick and short; (3) the ndhar or ndjar chor, which is very long and fierce; (4) the chitwa, which is smaller, but very fierce. (This may perhaps be the chitta.)\nChital or spotted deer (*Axis maculatus*). The male is called *jh\u00e1nkh*.\n\nKh\u00e1nkh, antelope (*Antilope bezoartica*).\n\nKh\u00e1nkra, identified by Mr. Lumsden with the barking deer (*Cervulus aureus*), known in other parts of India as *k\u00e1kar*. The name perhaps contains an allusion to the long canine teeth of its bearer (*kh\u00e1ng*, a tusk). The kh\u00e1nkra is a small deer about two feet in height, and from its handsome little skin *partalas* or sword-belts are usually made.\n\nNilg\u00e1o or rojh (*Portax pictus*), common in the jungle. A variety called the Ghordrojh, which is found in the Diw\u00e1ra lands near Barhaj and Paina, owes its name to the fact that its form is stout and supposed to resemble that of a horse.\n\nArna or wild buffalo (*Bubalus arni*).\n\nLang\u00e9r or large monkey (*Presbytis entellus*).\n\nSahi or porcupine (*Hystrix leucura*).\n\nN\u00e1k or magar, crocodile (*Crocodilus biporcatus*), very dangerous owing to the fact that it is almost omnivorous.\n\nGhar\u00edd or gavyal (*Gavialis Gangeticus*), a long-nosed river saurian, which, living on fish, is comparatively harmless.\n\nSt\u00fas or porpoise (*Platanista Gangetica*), very common in the R\u00e9pti and all the larger rivers. A smaller variety is called *goht\u00e1*.\n\nG\u00e1dur or flying-fox (*Pteropus Edwardsii*), everywhere abundant.\n\nThe sh\u00e1m\u00e1n, a bird with red and green plumage, is common here, but said to be rare elsewhere. Such birds are often sent for sale to other districts, where a very good specimen will fetch Rs. 10. When young they are sold for eight annas each. There is an immense variety of water birds, of which, however, few or none are peculiar to the district. The large grebe is sometimes found. The florican and jungle-cock are met with in the north of the district. Hill mainas and parrots are sometimes brought to Gorakhpur for sale, but no regular trade in them exists.\n\n**Poisonous snakes.**\n\nThe natives believe at least a dozen kind of snakes to inflict fatal bites, and the following undoubtedly do so:\n\n- Gehuw\u00e1n,\n- Dogla,\n- Doma,\n- Kar\u00e1it,\n- Khatkhor,\n- Ghorkarait,\n\nVarieties of the *k\u00e1l\u00e1 s\u00e1mp* or cobra (*Naja tripudians*).\n\nVarieties of the bungarus. The female karait is called *naggin* and the ghorkarait is said to make noise like a horse neighing.\nThe following are only sometimes deadly, but always cause pain and sickness in those whom they bite:\n\n- **Amaita**, a large snake with very long fangs.\n- **Chitar or chitra**, a spotted snake about 18 inches long.\n- **Ahritin, mahar**, about four feet long, yellow and grey; the bite produces swelling and great pain.\n- **Sonkatar**.\n- **Sogana or sigona**, a green snake.\n\nThe **ajgar** or python is sometimes, though rarely, found in the north of the district.\n\nBesides these there are a large number of harmless snakes, some of them possessing great beauty. Scorpions are very common. There are several water snakes which the natives declare are poisonous; the commonest are the **pantha**, **chakor**, and **zardrang** or yellow-hue. The number of deaths resulting yearly from snake-bite is very large. About half only of such cases are probably reported; but the following list of casualties thus caused during six warm months of 1872 will be found sufficiently long:\n\n| Month | Male | Female | Total |\n|-------|------|--------|-------|\n| May   | 10   | 11     | 21    |\n| June  | 30   | 59     | 89    |\n| July  | 47   | 59     | 106   |\n| August| 55   | 62     | 117   |\n| September | 32 | 31     | 63    |\n| October| 12   | 13     | 25    |\n| **Total** | **176** | **215** | **391** |\n\nIn the remaining half of the year, i.e., in the drier and colder months, but 43 cases occurred. Considering that (as before stated) there are probably just as many cases unreported as reported, this large total of 434 shows a very serious mortality. No measures, however, have as yet been taken for the destruction of venomous snakes, and perhaps none are possible. Except for the slaughter of pariah dogs and an occasional tiger, no reward for the destruction of noxious beasts has been claimed in the district for some years.\n\nAccurate returns of the number of cattle killed by snakes or wild beasts are not forthcoming, but it must be very considerable in the north, where large herds graze about forests still infested with tigers. The returns of persons destroyed by snake-bite and beasts of prey have since 1875 been amalgamated\nand kept in less detail. It is only certain that 516 persons of both sexes thus perished in 1875, 480 in 1876, and 427 in 1877: average 474 yearly.\n\nThe cattle of the district are as a rule poor and much inferior to those found up-country. Mr. Ridsdale mentions a letter written to the Board of Revenue about 1824-25 by the Collector of Gorakhpur, who complains of the extreme difficulty of getting any cattle sufficiently strong to drag the Government treasure carts. Since then cattle have certainly improved, but the breed produced is still inferior. No systematic breeding has been attempted; but the purchase of cattle from neighbouring districts and the practice of bringing large herds to graze in the north of Gorakhpur have of course done something to improve the stock.\n\nThe price of the common bullocks born and bred in this district varies according to age, strength, &c., from Rs. 5 to Rs. 25, hardly ever exceeding the latter sum. The average value of a pair of bullocks used in a plough in this district would probably be from Rs. 15 to Rs. 30, if they were of the district breed. As, however, many cattle of better breed are purchased from other districts, this price must be raised to find the true average for bullocks of all kinds. This may be fixed at about Rs. 25 a pair. Since the closing of the Government breeding studs at Ghazipur and Karantadik, stud-bred horses have rarely appeared for sale in the district. The ordinary country pony is the only steed for which anything like a demand can be said to exist, and is sometimes a very serviceable beast. The price for such animals, when young, ranges from Rs. 5 to Rs. 20, and when in their prime from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50. To the Englishman at Gorakhpur the acquisition of a good remount is a difficult or a doubtful matter. No horses are bred, and the station is too small and too much out of the way to attract dealers. No attempt has been made to establish a breeding stud of any kind here.\n\nIn 1866-67 proposals were made to import some bulls from Hissar in order to improve the breed of cattle, but the animals were found too large for the small cows of the district and the experiment failed. At the same time some rams were introduced, but these too were a failure, as they died within a year of their arrival. In 1869 Mr. Collector Clifford, again tried the experiment with some long-wooled sheep, but again without success. It should certainly be quite possible to improve the breed of cattle if bulls of a good stock but small size were imported, and the capital pasture here procurable should have a healthening effect on the\nyoung calves. A number of persons, chiefly Ahirs, live by pasturing cattle in the north of the district and on the skirts of Nep\u00e1l.\n\nScattered over the northern forests are large open glades covered with grass, which after the rains often grows to a great height. The charwahas (graziers) burn this and then bring their cattle to graze on the young shoots of grass which spring up. The best pasture lands are in the east of Sidhna Jobna. The exact extent of patches so mingled with the jungle cannot very well be estimated, but they must cover at least 30,000 acres. The grazier collects from his own and neighbouring villages a herd of cattle (lehar) containing from 60 to 200 head or even more. This he drives into the jungles at the end of Kartik (October-November). The cattle remain there till the end of Baisakh or Jeth (i.e. May or June), some six or seven months later, when they leave in order to reach their villages before the rains descend. The rates which these heads pay to the landlord vary considerably from one estate to another. But as a general rule, a herd of cattle numbering 100 head of all ages and sexes would be allowed, on payment of Rs. 5, to graze for the whole season of six months. Nor would the fee be increased if the head of cattle were nearer 150 than 100. For buffaloes Rs. 8 per hundred is the usual charge, but a price of two annas a head is occasionally asked. Cattle are brought from great distances to graze, being often driven 40 or 50 miles, and sometimes 80. The grazier is sometimes a servant paid at the rate of Rs. 3 a month by the different owners; sometimes several cattle-owners take it in turns to pasture their common cattle, and sometimes, but very rarely, the herdsman is paid by a share in the calves born while the herd is under his charge. Herdsmen or graziers are as a class very honest. Camels are very rarely used in this district: elephants being common, and the facilities of carriage by water great, they are needed neither for riding nor burthen. The climate, moreover, does not suit them. Goats are numerous, but there is no specially good breed, nor have any attempts been made to improve the poorer breeds that exist.\n\nSeveral varieties of river fish are used for food in this district, and constitute an important item in the fare of the poorer classes. The best kinds are:\n\nRohu (Labeo rohita), a kind of carp which runs up to 10 or 12lbs. in weight, the average being about 3 or 4. This well-known fish is caught in great numbers in lakes, such as the Bhenri and Nandaur tals, whose fisheries are rented. It is taken all the year round, but attains its best condition\nduring the winter. The Karonchhal and the Bakhna are varieties not quite so good to eat as the true rohu.\n\nThe mah\u00e1ser, here apparently called the mas\u00e1rh (*Barbus mosal*), is, as already mentioned, sometimes caught in the Naraini, towards the extreme north of the district.\n\n*Baikari* (*Schilbichthys garua*), of which the larger variety is known as silandi. This fish is only caught during the rains. It will take a fly, is found in very rapid currents, and in appearance somewhat resembles a mackerel.\n\n*Naini* (*Cirrhina mrigala*), resembles the rohu, but is yellower. Hindus say it is a foul feeder and seldom eat it; but the formation of its mouth is opposed to this statement, and it is probably just as clean in its diet as the rohu.\n\n*Arodri* or gray mullet (*Mugil corsula*), a small fish caught generally in the rains and of very good flavour.\n\n*Chillua* (*Aspidoparia morar*), a very small fish of good but sometimes muddy flavour. This is the \"whitebait\" with which Indian butlers favour their English masters. Small as it is, it will readily take a fly.\n\nThe following are also edible:\u2014*Girai* (*Ophiocephalus punctatus*), a small fish, eaten by the poor.\n\n*Gonch* (*Bagarius Yarrellii*), a large scaleless fish, rather like a freshwater shark. It is a very foul feeder, has a long mouth armed with sharp teeth, and is only eaten by the very poorest classes.\n\nThe *Jalkaph\u00e9r* (*Notopterus kapirat*) resembles the *baikari* in appearance, and is very good eating. It is caught generally in the rains, and has a pair of long barbels.\n\n*Tengar* (*Macrones tengara*), a fish which is described as full-blooded. It is also full flavoured, and its flesh is rarely eaten except in the form of a spiced preserve.\n\nThe *hilsa* is sometimes caught during the rains. There are two kinds of prawn (*jhinga*), one very large; and two kinds of crab (*kenkra*). All of these are edible.\n\n*B\u00e1m-b\u00e1mi* or eels (*Anguilla Bengalensis*) and *bilondha* are common in most of the rivers.\n\nThe spines on the fins of the *Singhi* (*Saccobranchus fossiliis*) and *sakuchi* (species unverified) are said to give poisonous wounds. The *singhi* seems to spend most of his time in mud holes at the bottom of the water.\nThe species of the following varieties remain to be identified by some practised ichthyologist:\u2014Bhakura, a large fish which is excellent eating and sometimes attains a weight of 20 or 30 lbs. Raiya, a small, edible, and graceful fish, something like a smelt. The sohiya, also small and edible, is a silvery fish which loves deep waters. The strong flavour of the piyas commends it to the palate of few except barges. The moi, smooth and shining, has fine scales, many bones, and little flavour. Its stomach is, however, thought a delicacy. The entrails of the parni, which sometimes reaches a weight of 80 lbs., are similarly esteemed. The kuasi is silvery and edible, but bony. The sidhri, sumbha, and khuria are all small pond fish, eaten by the poorer classes. The surji is described as small, but well flavoured. The mangur is some 6 or 7 inches in length and burrows in the mud of ponds. Its flesh is pleasant to the taste, but said to lack firmness. The pengna is a small fish with strong sharp fins, a body white below and brownish-green above, and a couple of barbels. Last and almost least comes the patharchatar with its length of about 6 inches. It has a brown back, sharp fins, and pleasant flavour.\n\nTurtles (kachhua) are very common, but are not, so far as can be ascertained, extensively used as food. Many persons however eat their eggs, which are often found 50 or 100 together. The rohu and its varieties, the bhakura, the karonchhal, the bilondha, the bokhna, and the baikri, all yield oil. So do the porpoise and the gonchh; but being too strong for the nets and lines ordinarily used, they are rarely captured. The fishermen are chiefly Mall\u00e1hs and T\u00farhas, a division of the Kah\u00e1r caste. Their apparatus is simple, but effective. The net most in use is the g\u00e1nja. This is a long hempen trap open at one end, and fixed along the course of a stream by means of a bambu framework. Through its open mouth, into a sort of chamber at the other end, the fish are driven by a boat pulling down-stream. The open end is then lifted out of the water and the net hauled ashore. The korhel and the t\u00e9pahu are generally used from boats; they are shaped liked extinguishers, and, like the g\u00e1nja, have a bambu framework. In rivers they are pulled up against the current, and in lakes they are repeatedly pushed down amongst the weeds where the fish lie. The mahd\u00edjal or seine net is fortunately rarely used. It is set by three or four boats, and covering a circumference of 200 or 250 yards, is very destructive. If it were very commonly employed, the fisheries of the district would probably be ruined. A small net called jhinguri or jhikhari is fastened to a triangle of bambu and pushed on in front of the fisherman by means of a long handle. Used to catch the prawns and small fish which abound in shallows, this is exactly similar to the prawn nets used in England. Besides these nets, long\nand short rods, called respectively *bansi*, and *katiya*, aid the fisherman in his labours. The terms employed by the fisherman of Gorakhpur are, for his line, *dori*; for his float, *taraina*; for his lead, *tuka* or *goti*; for the hook, *kantiya* or *kanta*; for the bait *chira*; and for the frame on which the line is wound, *pelni*. The last name is sometimes also applied to a hand-line. It is a common custom in the district to dam up streams which summer has left with little or no current, and then to build, across the shallow water below the dam, small compartments in which the fish can be easily chased and captured. Walls are often constructed across small lakes and ponds with the same object. Immense labour is sometimes spent on draining the lesser tals in order to catch the fish thus left gasping on their ooze.\n\nNative fishermen greatly overcrowd all places where there is anything like good fishing to be got. As they never dream of sparing a minnow once caught, it is lucky that the rainy season, with its boisterous floods, protects the breeding fish. Quite common is it to find 40 or 50 boats fishing in one lake which is certainly not large enough for more than 30; and as the sons of each fisherman deem themselves in some measure entitled to come and fish where their father fished before them, the number of destroyers is ever on the increase. The Rapti and the Ami are perhaps the two best streams for fishing, but fish are abundant in all of any size. The boatmen do not observe any regular close season, but catch fish whenever they can. For the due preservation of a great food resource legislation may perhaps be required.\n\nThe amount of fish consumed in the district must be something immense. Hind\u00fas and Muhammadans of all castes and classes eat it; and the average price during the greater part of the year being about one anna per ser only, or two annas for the best fish, such food is within the reach of even the poorest. During the rains and afterwards, until the waters subside, the price rises to two or even three annas a ser. Those who abstain from fish are mostly \"bhagats,\" devotees who have taken a vow of perpetual celibacy, and avoid meat, fish, and intoxicating liquor or drugs. The caste in which they are most numerous is the Koeri. Some Br\u00e1hmans, especially the worshippers of Shiva, refuse to eat scaleless fish (such as eels), but devour all other kinds.\n\nOn passing from the animal to the vegetable kingdom, cultivated crops demand our first notice. Of these a local distribution will serve as well as any more laboured classification; and we begin with the north of the district.\n\nHere the principal growth is rice (*dh\u00e1n, Oryza sativa*), for whose culture and irrigation the moist *tar\u00e1i* soil and numerous streams of Bin\u00e1yakpur and Tilpur afford exceptional facilities. More\nof it indeed is grown than of all the other crops put together, and the rice fields often present an unbroken expanse of some miles in extent. In par-ganah Haveli also the crop occupies a large area, and it is met with everywhere in the district, though to a small extent only in the southern and eastern tracts. A species of rice called boro must be elsewhere described, as its cultivation and time of reaping differ from those of the ordinary dh\u00e1n. Dh\u00e1n may itself be divided broadly into two classes\u2014bhadui and aghani.\n\nThe former is sown in Jeth (May-June) on land which has been left fallow since the autumn harvest of the former year. The ground is ploughed in P\u00fas (December-January) or M\u00e1gh (January-February) in order that the sun may penetrate and warm without hardening it overmuch.\n\nBhadui.\n\nThe field is again ploughed before sowing in Jeth. It is considered advantageous if a shower or two have fallen before this; but whether it rains or not, the seed must be sown by the end of the month just named. Seed sown before rain falls is called dhuria b\u00e1wag (i.e., the dusty or dry sowing). The soil best adapted to receive the crop is that lying low enough for the water to lodge, but not too low, as excessive flooding is injurious. If no rain falls before sowing, and unless the soil is very cold and moist, it is usual to irrigate the fields directly after that process. It is for this purpose that the Th\u00e1r\u00fas of Bin\u00e1yakpur dam up the small streams, which they then divert by numerous channels (l\u00falas) into their fields. As soon as the water has collected, naturally or artificially, to a depth of about three inches, the field is ploughed once more. This rather rough treatment is said not to injure the seeds, but to eradicate weeds which would otherwise choke the young crop. In As\u00e1rh (June-July) any grass or weeds which may have sprung up are weeded out by women and children, who receive as wages about 2\u00bd sers of rice a day. This process is called nirai. The amount of seed sown on the recognized bh\u00edga varies slightly in different parts of the district: the highest being 28 sers in B\u00e1ns\u00e1g\u00f3n, the lowest 22 sers in the Sadr tahsil. After sowing, the crop is generally dependent on the rains, and is ruined if they fail. As this kind of rice thrives most when the water around it is not too deep, its sower prefers a season of light and sustained to one of sudden and heavy rainfall. The fields have strong merhs or banks of about two feet high to retain the water. The crop grows rapidly and is cut in Kudr (September-October), or sometimes at the end of Bh\u00e1don (August-September), from which latter month it probably derives its name. Its best varieties are\u2014jhali, kap\u00farch\u00edni, gajesar, bendi (white and black), muttri, b\u00e1nsph\u00fal, parni or padni, dudha, s\u00e1tha, or s\u00e1thi, anjanava, sina, kauria, gajbel, and bandela.\nThe second kind of dh\u00e1n, aghani, is sometimes distinguished from its synonym jarhani; but no perceptible difference between the two would appear to exist. There are indeed two varieties of aghani, but these are varieties rather of cultivation than species, and the term jarhani applies to both. Jarhani in fact merely denotes the winter (j\u00e9ra) as opposed to the Bhadon or bhadui crop. Of the two varieties the first (chhitua) is generally sown or scattered (chh\u00fana) over fields which have lain fallow for some time and have been prepared, like those for the bhadui dh\u00e1n, some months beforehand. Often, however, a field in which gram, kirao, or linseed has been sown is selected for the crop. The stalks of the former one, being dug into the ground and mixed with the soil about two months before the rice is sown, form a kind of manure. The seed is sown in Asarh about a maund to an acre, and just as the crop has begun to rise from the ground, it is ploughed up again and dug into the earth. After a time it sprouts afresh with greater strength than before. It is cut generally in K\u00e1rt\u00edk (October-November). The second variety, behan, is so called from behan or bh\u00e1n, a cutting or seedling. This crop needs two fields. The first, called khet biyar, is ploughed twice or thrice in M\u00e1gh (January-February) and has high walls. In Asarh, after the first good fall of rain, it is ploughed and the water made to mix well with the soil. A plank heavily weighted is then dragged over it, and when the earth has become quite soft and slushy the seed is sprinkled broadcast and the plank taken over once again. About 30 to 35 sers of seed are sown to the acre. After a month the plant is usually ready for transplantation to the second field, which has been carefully ploughed for some time previously. If the crop is a good one, a biswa's growth in the biyar field is enough for planting a bigha in the new one. The plants, which are one or 1\u00bd feet in height, are stationed in their new home at distances of some two inches from one another. As it is necessary to complete this work quickly a great number of hands are employed, the average being a dozen men or women to the authorized bigha. These persons if hired laborers get two razias of rice and a quarter ser of charban, or, if they prefer it, two annas a day. A considerable quantity of water is needed for this crop, and the walls of the field are usually high and strong, so as to keep in the rainfall. The harvest is most often in Aghan (November-December). For carrying the crop to the threshing-floor the labourers get either two annas daily or one sheaf in 16, or if the harvest be poor and labour plentiful, one in 24 only. This kind of rice being cut very late, it is impossible usually to grow spring crop on the same\n\n1 Kirdo is a small pea usually sown with barley, when the combined crop is called jau kirdi.\n2 Bihnaur in Benares; in Fatehpur and Allahabad birde.\n3 A razia is equal to 1\u00bd ser.\nland. The same fields are therefore used year after year for this crop alone. When it is cut stalks of about ten inches high are left in the field; in the hot weather these are burnt, and as soon as any rain falls are dug into the ground, forming a valuable manure. Amongst the best kinds of aghani dh\u00e1n are the following:\u2014Finer (mihin) grains, phen, gauria, baharni (white and black), sy\u00e1m jira, and gurdhi. Coarser (mota) grains, harbelas, r\u00e1jal, sahiya, karga, nainjot, and angetha. The aghani rice is as a rule more valuable, and yields for the same area a larger outturn than the bhadui, but the latter of course leaves the land vacant for a spring crop. In Sidhua Jobna a class of rice called sengar is largely grown on lakes or ponds where the depth of water during the rains prevents the ordinary kinds of rice being grown. Its peculiarity is that it floats on the top of the water, and that the growth of the plant, whose roots are fixed in the soil below, keeps pace with the rise of the surface, even when that rise is sudden. It is cut in November, very often from boats, if the rains have been late and the water has not subsided.\n\nIn a good season the yield of rice is very great, and rice itself is the staple food of the poorer classes throughout the district. The outturn per acre of this and other crops will be shown on a later page. The process of threshing the rice, or rather of treading it out with bullocks, is the same as elsewhere, and known as dauri. But thoroughly to separate the grain from the husk, to turn the dh\u00e1n into ch\u00e1nwal, another process is required. The rice is placed in a dhenki or wooden mortar and pounded with a pestle, which, hinged on a fulcrum, falls by its own weight and is lifted by the pressure of a foot on its lighter or pedal end. Three sers of dh\u00e1n yield two of ch\u00e1nwal and one of chaff (bh\u00fasa). The husking is usually the work of hired labourers, who receive as wages one ser in twelve of the grain.\n\nExcept the cardamum and a little ginger there is no other crop in this part of the district worthy of notice. The hillmen raise a great deal of the former, which they sell on the spot to travelling merchants. These again export it, usually by the Dh\u00e1ni route, but sometimes by Nichlaval and Gorakhpur. The cardamums, which grow on small bushes about 3 feet high, are plucked in Chait (March-April) or Bais\u00e1kh (April-May) and spread out in the sun to dry. Either the thatch of the houses or a clean-swept square of ground is chosen as the drying-place. The price paid is about Re. 1-8 a panseri or Rs. 12 a maund; and the export trade via Dh\u00e1ni, Gorakhpur, and Barhaj towards the Gh\u00e1gra, and down that river to Patna and Calcutta, is considerable.\n\n1 Dauri is, strictly speaking, the rope with which the bullocks are tied together. See Elliot's Glossary and Forbes' Dictionary.\nPassing south and south-east, we find that though rice is still very widely cultivated, sugarcane, wheat, and opium are the principal crops. The east of parganah Haveli and the whole of Sidhua Jobna produce a large amount of the first named growth, which is indeed one of the chief staples of the district. An extensive trade is carried on in coarse chini (sugar), for whose preparation numerous factories have been built (Inf., Manufactures). The crop, which pays well, demands an immense amount of care and attention during the earlier stages of its cultivation. The process begins directly after the old crop is reaped. Cuttings of stalk about 5 or 6 inches in length are placed between layers of damp straw in a hole in the ground. This hole being closed up with a coating of earth forms a kind of hot-bed. The pieces of cane are called porha, and a bundle of one thousand an ansala. Some six of these bundles, costing from Re. 1-8 to Rs. 3, are required for the pakka bigha. After about eight days shoots sprout from the cuttings, which are dug up and planted in a field prepared with great care during the end of the rains and cold weather. It is necessary to plough the field some dozen times, besides taking a plank (palia) over it to break up the clods. By March or April these preliminaries are complete, the shoots are planted lengthways in the furrow, about one inch apart and 2 inches below the surface; and the soil is smoothed down with an unweighted plank. Sometimes the cuttings are after three days extracted and replanted, the plank being again passed over them; but this is not always done. Manure is spread over the surface, about 4 cart-loads to the bigha being sufficient. Partitions are then made in the field, which is carefully irrigated, the water being spread over the whole surface by means of a broad wooden shovel. From this time until the downfall of the rains the crop requires frequent watering; but it is of great importance that the soil should not be sodden by too much at a time. The labour required if the rains are late is extreme, as irrigation may be needed twenty times over; but when once the monsoon has broken, little remains to be done until the harvest in P\u00fas or Ph\u00e1lgun. Fields in which rice or kir\u00e1o have been previously reaped are considered best for cane, unless land which has been a whole year fallow can be obtained. If rice has been cut; the field is ploughed up and the cane sowed at the end of Ph\u00e1lgun; if kir\u00e1o, at the middle or end of Chait (March-April). Two crops are often raised from the same plant, the stumps being left in the ground after harvest and frequently watered.\n\n1 i.e. from January to March. A little cane is cut and sold for eating as opposed to manufacture in the earlier month of Aghan (November-December). In the bh\u00e9t lands of the Gandak valley the plant is sometimes grown without irrigation, but the juice is less saccharine.\nNew shoots sprout in May or June, and a fair crop is often secured. The more intelligent husbandmen assert, however, that this unrest is bad for the field. The name of the second crop is peri (or banjar). There are four kinds of sugarcane:\n\n1. Mahgujur, which grows to the greatest height.\n2. Saroti both yielding gur syrup,\n3. Bhaunwarw\u00e1r in abundance.\n4. Barokha or katarha yielding little gur and used chiefly for eating.\n\nSome account of the gur manufacture will be found in Part III. of this notice.\n\nGrown largely in the west of Haveli and centre of the district, wheat is more especially the staple of the south. B\u00e1ns\u00e1gon is noted for this and other spring crops, while Majhauli and the south of Padrauna also produce wheat in abundance. It is sown in October or November, and very commonly mixed with barley, in which case the combined crop is known as guj\u00e1di. The harvest is in April or May. About 30 sors are sown to a pakka bigha when wheat is sown alone. The dorus soil suits it best; but it grows very well on the uplands of Padrauna. The crop requires watering, but not very often. In M\u00e1h\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, indeed, there are some spots where it grows without any irrigation. Usually, however, the soil in the extreme north is not well adapted for wheat, for which moreover the inhabitants, preferring rice, care little. A considerable export trade in wheat is carried on via Gola and Barhaj, but cannot rival that in rice. The finest wheat is that grown in B\u00e1ns\u00e1gon and Maghar.\n\nOwing to the splendid crops which are raised in the Hasanpur Maghar parganah, the phrase \"Hasanpur k\u00e1 gehun\" is commonly used to denote an unusually fine crop. The outturn of wheat obtained without irrigation in the north is of course unequal to that of the highly cultivated south-country lands, but leaves a considerable profit to the farmer. Mas\u00far (Ervum lens), urd (Phaseolus radiatus), l\u00e1hi (Brassica napus), merua (Eleusine coracana), and other grains and pulses are grown throughout the south and centre of the district, but are not of enough importance to call for special accounts. The loki and the nenua, cucurbitaceous plants, something like pumpkins, are grown in great quantities by the poor, who train the plants over their low huts. The fruits are very large, and being, though of little\n\n---\n\n1 Soon after the first crop has been cut, the straw from its leaves, which have been allowed to lie where they fell, is sometimes ignited. Flames spread all over the field, without, however, injuring the plants, which after a little irrigation shoot forth again from beneath the ashes.\nflavour, edible, furnish a plentiful supply of food. They are seldom sold, but when they are, fetch about 12 annas a maund. Tobacco is extensively grown for local consumption, but is not exported to any great extent. Its cultivation has been described elsewhere,\u00b9 and, being marked in this district by no special peculiarity, need not be described again. Gorakhpur city is noted for its manufacture of *khamira*, a smoking mixture of tobacco and spices.\n\nIndigo is no longer grown in this district to the same extent as before the mutiny (1857). Many of the Europeans who then planted it have received or purchased sufficient land, untaxed or otherwise, to afford an ample rental and place them above the need of undertaking the notorious risks of indigo culture. Thus many places still called indigo factories are really but private residences. There are yet, however, a great number of factories where the manufacture is carried on more or less briskly. A list of these and a description of the process will be found under the head of *Manufactures*. Another cause which impedes the production of the dye in this district is the increased difficulty of obtaining rent-hold land on which to grow it. The crop is not one which native farmers care to sow themselves, and their landlords regard with jealousy the occupation of the soil by European planters. Tenants are therefore discouraged from subletting their holdings to indigo-planters even when they might otherwise be willing to do so. The times of sowing differ according to the nature of the land, but the ordinary season is in Chait or Ph\u00e1lgun, before the rains. Such is the case where the soil, being moist and cool, needs no saturation by early showers, or in those few spots where cheap wells supply the place of the lingering rain-cloud. Where, on the contrary, land is high by position or dry by nature, sowings are delayed until the first rains of Jeth or As\u00e1rh have expelled its heat. The first kind of land is considered best, and it is deemed a great advantage in either kind if it has lain fallow during the past year. Before being sown the fields are carefully weeded and ploughed into long furrows. The seed is then deposited, and the ground combed with a harrow. The crop grows very slowly till rain falls, when it shoots up with wonderful rapidity, growing as much as a foot in a week. Premature destruction is the doom of any weed that appears amongst the crop at this stage of its growth. The best weather for the rising plant seems to be that in which an interval of rain too short to swamp is succeeded by another of sunshine too short to parch. The time for reaping is, according to the forwardness of the season, the end of S\u00e1wan (August) or the beginning of Ku\u00e1r (September). Sometimes, where lands are subject to extensive inundations, the seed is scat-\n\n\u00b9 See, for instance, the notice on the Bijnor district, pp. 270-273.\ntered over them broadcast as the water subsides and left to grow as it may. But the outturn of the crop thus sown in Bh\u00e1don or Ku\u00e1r is, as a rule, extremely poor, and the practice itself is extremely rare.\n\nPoppy cultivation is allowed in all the tahsils, but is far more extensive in the south of the district than in the north. In Padrauna opium is one of the chief products, being gathered from plants on over 20,000 acres. The cultivation is, as a rule, confined to prosperous and respectable cultivators, a fact only mentioned here because in describing the condition of the agricultural population it is proposed to show how well the system of advances works in this particular case. The land must be prepared very carefully for the crop, which is sown in K\u00e1rtik, and indeed needs, except as regards irrigation, almost more care than sugarcane. About two sers of poppy seed are required per acre, but the amount appears to vary greatly in different localities. The crop is watered more or less frequently according to the nature of the ground and quantity of the winter rainfall. It always, however, demands laborious attention; and this fact accounts more perfectly than any religious or moral scruples for its rare cultivation by R\u00e1jputs and other persons of high caste but lazy habits. Ready for tapping in Ph\u00e1lgun or the beginning of Chait, the crop usually pays well, unless injured by the not unfrequent calamity of hail. The accompanying table, supplied by the sub-deputy opium agent (Mr. Campbell), shows admirably the difficulty of determining the average yield for the district generally of any one crop, varying as the outturn does from year to year and place to place. In the north poppy lands are classed as unirrigated, and hardly ever require watering. The crop thrives best on a sandy loam (dorus), and requires, like the sugarcane, a good deal of manure.

Barley (jau), as before remarked, is usually sown in the same field as wheat, whose cultivation its own closely resembles. As an unmixed crop, however, it is grown extensively in the Sadr tahsil alone, whence a good deal is exported via Barhaj. It is of course a spring crop, being sown in K\u00e1rtik and cut in Chait. Peas (mattar) are grown for the spring harvest, chiefly in the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on, Salempur, and the Sadr tahsil. They flourish on the rather moist lands left bare by receding floods, and are exported from the district in some quantity; masur also is a spring crop, grown mostly in the Sadr and Padrauna tahsils, and largely used for food; nothing in its cultivation particularly calls for remark.\n\nLinseed and sarson are the principal oilseeds, the latter being chiefly grown in the Gorakhpur, the former in the Basti district; they are spring crops. The mustard oil extracted from sarson is in great request as a relish for the bannocks (chap\u00e1ti) which among the native population supply the place of bread. Kodo is largely used as an article of food by the lower classes, and like most millets is cultivated for the autumn harvest. Arhar is extensively grown and thrives exceedingly. The crops of this plant grown towards the north-west of Haveli are especially good, and with their dark-green foliage vivify a landscape that would otherwise be somewhat bare. Arhar is less vulnerable than cereals to the attacks of hail, and as frosts are rare in the district, is considered a safe crop; but it occupies the ground too long to return much profit.\n\nThis is perhaps the fittest occasion to trace the progress under British rule of opium, indigo, and sugarcane cultivation, and to record the various attempts which have been made to introduce new staples or improve those existing. On the cession of the district to its present rulers, sugar cultivation was a rarity. The exactions practised on the cultivators rendered them unable as well as unwilling to grow so costly and troublesome a crop. Nor was the \"beast more kinder than mankind.\" As late as 1819 the Collector, writing to the Board for the information of the Governor-General, says: \"the extent of the forests, the white-\nants, and the wild elephants, which are very numerous in the north and east of the district, prevent the cultivation of the sugarcane, except in the south.\" In 1823 the Government monopoly of opium seems to have been first extended to the district, the Collector being made deputy opium agent, and the cultivation of opium, save under his permission, being prohibited. About 1830 the cultivation of indigo, little practised hitherto by the landholders of the district, was started by European planters. In 1837-38 Mr. Reade, reporting on the condition of Gorakhpur, writes that the sugarcane tillage is spreading, but at present confined to three parganahs\u2014Salempur, Shahjahanpur, and Sidhua Jobna. In these parganahs it had, however, made great progress, as had that of the poppy, the outturn of opium being twenty times what it had been only twelve years before. Again in 1840, reviewing the excise receipts, he speaks\\(^1\\) of \"the marvellously increasing culture of the bounteous sugar, promising to drive out the poppy\" and check the increase in the cultivation of the latter. The cultivation of both, however, continued to increase steadily. Its extension was most remarkable in Sidhua Jobna, fast recovering from the desolation whereto it had been reduced by the Banjaras, and possessed of a soil which, requiring little water even in the driest years, is especially fitted for the growth of sugarcane. The total area of land under opium cultivation in 1830 was about 4,900 bighas (pakka). At last settlement there were about 40,000, and there are now some 45,000 bighas.\\(^2\\) Sugarcane cultivation has increased still more wonderfully. The crop is now grown over 50,000 acres, nearly half of which lie in Sidhua Jobna. In 1830 there were not probably more than 5,000 acres at most, and the greater part of this was in Salempur-Majhauli. The increase of late years has been partially due to the usurers, who advance money more freely on sugarcane than on other crops. Indigo is not mentioned in the report of 1837-40, and was perhaps not grown to any very great extent till after the latter date. In his note on the settlement of the district Mr. A. Colvin mentions that there were 33,000 acres under indigo in 1870-71, but the statistics there given are deemed inaccurate, and from information locally collected it is probable that not over 20,000 acres are grown with indigo in a year. The average area thus cultivated amounts perhaps to 18,000 or 19,000 acres. Before the mutiny, the area occupied by this crop was probably greater than now. No systematic attempt has apparently been made to improve the staple crops of the district. The immense increase in the culture of sugar and opium is due rather to increased security of life and property under British rule than to any direct\n\n\\(^1\\) See Mr. Ridsdale's notes.\n\n\\(^2\\) About 21,000 acres. The bighas here mentioned are opium pakka bighas, which are no smaller than those of 1830.\nefforts for the extension of that culture. Indigo has been introduced by us, but it can hardly be called a staple crop, and its tillage is not likely to increase. Experiments have been made occasionally with hemp (in 1811), cotton (1861), and Carolina and other rice, but with no marked results. Cotton and the bajra millet (*Penicillaria spicata*) are the two crops which succeed least in the district; and it would be bad policy to attempt their introduction on lands now grown with the rice, sugarcane, poppy, and wheat, which really suit soil and climate.\n\nThe following statement shows the average produce per acre, average cost of cultivation, and average profits left to the cultivator. Figures furnished by the tahsildars were in most cases so obviously incorrect and contradictory that no trust could be placed in them. Those given in the settlement report (para. 24 of Board\u2019s letter) are also manifestly inaccurate, the outturn per bigha being apparently shown in many cases for that per acre. Mr. Alexander has had, therefore, to trust to the figures arrived at by a comparison of the information obtained from European district officers and that supplied by the subordinate judge, Ali Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n, who very kindly interrogated various landlords on this subject. One great difficulty has been the variation from place to place in the produce of the principal crops. The outturn in *gur*, for instance, from an acre of sugarcane in Padrauna is stated at 30 maunds, while at B\u00e1ns\u00e1gon it is put at 5\u00bd only. Though the latter figure is certainly wrong, the difference in the yield is probably considerable:\n\n| Crop                  | Sown in       | Reaped in     | Approximate area under cultivation in acres | Cost of cultivation per acre in rupees | Produce per acre in maunds and bers. | Value at average rates in rupees, and average profit per acre. |\n|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1.

Indigo he rarely grows for himself, but sublets his fields to the planter, receiving a rent of Rs. 5 or Rs. 6 per acre, and either so much for the crop or (more commonly) so much for his services as a labourer.\n\nThe method adopted in ascertaining the cost of cultivation, and the difficulties attending that or any other method, may be shown best by an analysis of the process in the case of one crop. Let us take wheat. The elements to be considered in its cost are of course rent, capital, and labour. The rent of good average land suitable for its cultivation is about Rs. 2\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) per bigha, or Rs. 4\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\) per acre. But in the cost of wheat the whole of this rent cannot be included. Very often a second crop of some kind is grown on the same land within the year; and though wheat is the crop from which the cultivator expects his chief profit, we cannot allow its share of the rent to exceed three rupees. The elements of capital and labour may be considered\n\n\\(^1\\)This of course excludes cost of manufactures.\ntogether, intimately blended or interchanged as they are in the successive processes of tillage. The first of these processes, ploughing, varies in cost immensely according to locality and according as the farmer has or has not cattle of his own. The number of times and depth to which the ground requires ploughing, the hire of cattle and expense of their keep, are variable quantities which combine to raise the cost of this operation from a single rupee in one case to Rs. 3 in another. In sowing, again, the weight of seed used differs oddly from place to place. The 30 or 35 sers which suffice for a bigha in the east are increased in the south to a maund. Hence the average cost of sowing one acre is from Rs. 2 to Rs. 3; but to this must be added the wages of the hands employed to assist the actual cultivator in the process. As this should not exceed 8 annas, and is often less, the average may be fixed at 6.\n\nIrrigation costs from 8 annas to Rs. 3-8 an acre, according to locality, season, and nature of soil. And lastly, the reaping and threshing, when the labourers are not paid in kind, demand an outlay of from 12 annas to one rupee. The total cost would thus range from about Rs. 7\u00bd to about 14 an acre. To this, however, must be added a proportionate share in the expenses of buying, maintaining, and replacing the fixed capital, the plough-cattle, and agricultural implements. In some places the cost of digging an earthen well once every two or three years must not be forgotten. Inexorable custom demands, moreover, that the peasant should pay a share of his harvest to several village magnates, the landlord's factor, the accountant, the watchman, and the family priest. Not less than half a maund must perhaps be deducted from the returns of each acre for these payments (sahdri),\u00b9 and this translated into money means about one rupee. Even supposing, therefore, that no well must be dug; that the cultivator has bullocks and ploughs enough of his own, and need merely pay his ploughmen and labourers, we cannot fix his outlay in money (or grain reduced to its money value) at less than Rs. 9 an acre, while it may amount to nearly double that figure. Nor does this sum include any allowance for the subsistence of the cultivator, though to get a fair estimate of the cost of production, the value of the labour given by himself and his family must be added. The tenant has in most cases to borrow about sowing time, and this loan must be repaid with heavy interest. Without the loan he could not cultivate, and its interest should therefore be added to the cost of production.\n\nThe profits here shown as left to the cultivator are minute, but it is doubted whether, taking good years with bad, they have been understated. In some papers published a few years back Mr. Halsey asserts that the cultivators\n\n\u00b9 Which is, being interpreted, aids. Conf. the aids of the European feudal system.\nof these provinces often work at a loss to themselves. Absurd as the statement sounds, it is probably true, in so far that the profits left them after their actual outlay do not equal fair wages at market rates for the trouble and skill they have bestowed on their work. In the compilation of the above table the farmer has been supposed to possess one plough and pair of bullocks, but has not, on the other hand, been allowed a large family to aid him. Some slight allowance has been also made for interest on borrowed capital. A fitting conclusion to the subject of agriculture may be given by the following statement, which shows roughly the areas grown in different tahsils and during average years with the principal classes of crop:\n\n| Name of crop                  | Sadr Tahsil | B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on | Deoria | H\u00e1ta | Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj | Padrauna |\n|-------------------------------|-------------|----------|--------|------|-------------|----------|\n|                               | Acres       | Acres    | Acres  | Acres| Acres       | Acres    |\n| Wheat                         | 42,353      | 41,674   | 39,74  | 20,663| 82,305      |          |\n| Barley                        | 63,187      | 62,511   | 54,197 | 26,165| 12,755      | 68,680   |\n| Mixed wheat and barley        | 58,595      | 20,837   | 41,929 | 12,482| 11,790      |          |\n| Gram                          | 11,275      | 5,214    | 8,913  | 5,413 | 11,117      | 915      |\n| Peas                          | 13,190      | 5,214    | 12,227 | 16,130| 1,020       |          |\n| Masur (pulse)                 | 12,745      | 2,607    | 2,485  | 2,919 | 2,722       | 1,667    |\n| Mixed peas, gram, and         | 33,833      | 5,211    | 3,790  | 9,503 | 859         | 19,872   |\n| (often) barley                |             |          |        |      |             |          |\n| Linseed                       | 1,470       | 277      | 3,193  | 10,855| 1,390       | 7,076    |\n| Sugarcane                     | 1,853       | 4,635    | 8,064  | 12,572| 279         | 38,69    |\n| Indigo                        | 1,961       | 1,751    | 8,242  | 418   | 362         | 2,408    |\n| Opium                         | 1,664       | 808      | 6,388  | 1,113 | 252         | 10,149   |\n| Sarson (mustard)              | 1,612       | 554      | 585    | 1,531 | 1,061       | 4,919    |\n| Kodo (millet)                 | 12,745      | 43,214   | 15,727 | 19,002| 872         | 11,098   |\n| Aghani                        | 48,740      | 18,341   | 63,211 | 75,151| 79,95       |          |\n| Bhadui {rices}                | 77,158      | 45,853   | 35,696 | 77,774| 83,447      | 93,793   |\n| Arhar (pulse)                 | 8,823       | 10,427   | 19,967 | 5,991 | 2,381       | 11,602   |\n\nThe mango (*Mangifera Indica*) is perhaps the commonest, and certainly the finest fruit tree in the district. It abounds in the southern and central tracts, and, though not so common, is frequently met with in the north. The Bombay and Maldah mangoes have both been introduced and thrive; the price per hundred is from Rs. 4 to 6. There are two kinds of the common country (*desi*) mango, which both sell from Re. 1-8-0 to Rs. 2-8-0 per hundred. The fruit ripens in June or July. The wood, which is much used for small beams and carpenter\u2019s work, is very cheap, and a fair sized tree may be bought for Rs. 10. The guava (*Psidium pomiferum*) is also common, and the jack-fruit (*Artocarpus integrifolia*), mahua (*Bassia latifolia*), pharend (*Eugenia jambolana*), and orange (*Citrus aurantium*) also abound. The guava, planted usually by Koeris, ripens\nin September or October. The jack-fruit is sold, as a rule, by weight. The pharend'or jamun bears a small bitter plum, from which a kind of vinegar, supposed to be efficacious in cases of indigestion and dysentery, is brewed. The flower of the mahua is chiefly used in the manufacture of country spirit, for which there is a great demand in the district; while its wood is well adapted for purposes of building and carpentry. An average tree will, if sound, fetch about Rs. 12. There are no less than nine kinds of oranges and limes. Of these the papery lime (kaghazi nimbu), so called from the thinness of its rind, and the sagdaran are most valuable, being supposed to possess medicinal properties. The papery lime (citrus acida) is also used in the concoction of sharbat. The common orange (naurangi) is very extensively grown, and its price ranges from 12 annas to Re. 1-4-0 per hundred. The t\u00e1r or palmyra (Borassus flabelliformis) and khaj\u00far or date-palm (Phoenix dactylifera) supply the south of the district with considerable quantities of toddy.\n\nThe principal woods, besides the mango and mahua, are:\n\n(1) S\u00e1l (Shorea robusta), grown chiefly in the Government forests or Nep\u00e1l, but also on land belonging to private individuals in the district. The average price for good wood already cut into logs is 10 annas per cubic foot. A medium sized tree is usually sold for Rs. 15 or 20 as it stands. The wood is very hard and durable.\n\n(2) Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo), very plentiful. Its wood, which is streaky, rather soft, and much cheaper than s\u00e1l, is used chiefly for making boxes, palanquins, and furniture.\n\n(3) Bargad or banyan (Ficus Bengalensis).\u2014This celebrated tree furnishes frames for arches and other brickwork, as well as for agricultural implements. Its wood is cheap and easily turned.\n\n(4) K\u00e9sam, elsewhere goesham (Schleichera trijuga), a strong wood, used for making carts and palanquins; is sold for about half the price of s\u00e1l.\n\n(5) T\u00e1n (Cedrela toona).\u2014This furnishes a good material for tables and other articles of furniture. The wood fetches about 4 annas a cubic foot.\n\nBesides these, the wild fig (Ficus glomerata), asna or assaina (Terminalia tomentosa), lasora (Cordia myxa), panan, elsewhere sandhan, (Dalbergia ougei-nensis), akol (Alangium Lamarckii), ebony (Diospyros ebenum), hara (Terminalia chebula), bab\u00fal (Acacia Arabica), n\u00edm (Melia Indica), and kurma, (Stephegyne parvifolia !) supply wood for agricultural implements. The piar (Buchanania latifolia), paniha (Randia uliginosa), baisa (Salix tetrasperma), and others serve for firewood. The ebony or tendu above mentioned is remarkable for the hardness of its black heart-wood, which is often used for the jath\u00b9 (or upright\n\n\u00b9 Called elsewhere in the Benares division pat.\npestle) of the sugar-mill. Bambus of more than one species are abundant. The common cane rattan, or bent (Calamus rotang), grows beside the Malawa swamp in the Sonari forest and elsewhere, but nowhere in any great quantity.\n\nSome of the trees already named are reputed to possess medicinal properties. The vinegar of the pharend has been mentioned. The fruit of the hara is used as a purgative. The bark of the paniha is mixed in the decoctions with which quacks profess to fertilize barren women. The roots of semal saplings are made ingredients in tonic medicines. An embrocation from the leaves of the n\u00edm is prescribed in cases of rheumatism. Other trees, however, are laid under requisition by the druggist. The juice of the peach, aru or shaftalu (Prunus persica), is drunk to purify the blood. A decoction from the fruit of the bel (Egle marmelos) is used in cases of dysentery, while the fruit itself is chopped up and given to cows and buffaloes with the idea of increasing their milk. The seeds of the par\u00e1s, elsewhere dhik (Butea frondosa), furnish a purgative medicine. The bark of the ganniar (Premna integrifolia) is boiled to yield a tonic for persons suffering from boils. A strong purgative is supplied by the long cylindrical beans of the amaltas (Cassia fistula). The yellow fruit of the mainphal (Randia dumetorum) renders a medicine said to relieve headache. Infusions from the leaves of the kharanj (Albizia procera), bakayan (Melia azedarach), and miuri (Vitex negundo) are administered to rheumatic patients.\n\nThe following are some of the miscellaneous purposes served by the trees of the district:\n\nThe leaves of the sal tree are made into cups in which offerings are made at marriages. The bark of the asna and the ashes of k\u00fasam wood are used in tanning. The berries of the aonla (Phyllanthus emblica) are brought to play in various religious ceremonies. The cotton-like substance found in the flowers of the semal is used for stuffing pillows. From the bark of the khair (Acacia catechu) is boiled a decoction called katha, which is mixed for chewing with betel. The flowers of the t\u00fan and harsing\u00e1r (Nyctanthes arbortristis) supply a yellow dye, while a paler shade of the same colour is obtained from the fruit of the hara.\n\nThe following vegetables and fruits are largely grown by Koer\u00eds and other \"market gardeners\" of the district. They are chiefly produced in the garden lands round Gorakhpur itself, where alone any great demand for them exists; but many\n\n---\n\n1 It has, for instance, been mentioned above as growing beside the Chilua T\u00e1l.\nof them are grown to some extent in the neighbourhood of other large towns:\n\n(1) Vegetable plants.\n\n| Baldi (turmeric). | Baingan (egg plant). |\n| Piy\u0101z (onion).    | Alu (potato).        |\n| Adrak (ginger).   | Gubi (cabbage).      |\n| Marcha (pepper).  | P\u0101n (betel).         |\n| Shakarkand (kind of yam). | Lahsan (garlic). |\n| G\u0101j\u0101r (carrot).   | Dhania (coriander-seed). |\n| M\u0101li (radish).    | Cucumber (kakri and kira). |\n\nOf these the commonest are yams, carrots, potatoes, and turmeric. The first is sown in August or September, ripening in January or February (M\u0101gh), and is usually sold for from Re. 1 to Re. 1-8-0 a maund. Carrots are sown about a month later, dug up in November or December, and bought for about 12 annas to Re. 1 a maund. Potatoes are dug about January or February and fetch as much as Rs. 2 a maund, their cultivation being more troublesome and their occupation of the ground much longer. Turmeric is sown in June or July and is ready by December or January, selling for Rs. 4 or 5 a maund.\n\n(2) Fruits.\n\n| Pineapple (anan\u0101s). | Lichi. |\n| Plantain (kela).    | Custard-apple (sharifa). |\n| Melon (kh\u0101rb\u016bza and tarb\u016bza). | Peaches (aru). |\n\nThe celebrated pineapples of Gorakhpur are largely exported. There remain to be noticed several processes common to the tillage of both field and garden: such are manuring and irrigation. According to Mr. Reade neither was much practised until the period of the settlements in 1833-37.\n\n\"In many parts,\" he writes in 1860, \"the use of manure was till then unknown. The improvement of crops by weeding and a better rotation was a novelty. Means of irrigation, always obtainable with ease from the nearness of water to the surface, were comparatively little used.\" His account of the ignorance of the peasantry is confirmed by the evidence of Messrs. Grant and Wroughton in 1821-22. Enquiring carefully into the subject whilst surveying the district, they decided that not only was the system of agriculture slovenly and unscientific, but that landlords who should have given the lead in improvements were the most inclined to regard their ignorance as a sacred heritage. The introduction and rapid extension of sugarcane cultivation, the lessons learnt from indigo factories, and the further stimulus given by the extension of poppy culture with its system of advances, have done wonders in teaching the people the value of better husbandry. Manuring is now commonly practised, and near the town of Gorakhpur as many as 20 or even 30 cartloads are given to one bigha. So liberal a measure is, however, dealt out only to such land as is expected to produce two\nor three crops in the year. No statistics exist to show the average quantity spread over a bigha of land adjoining an ordinary village, but that quantity would probably vary immensely from north to south. In the north, owing to its natural fertility, and the fact that it is seldom sown more than once a year, the soil is very rarely manured at all. In the south five cartloads would perhaps represent fairly the average quantity spent per bigha on the homestead lands surrounding a village. Those at any distance are very rarely found manured.\n\nIn the northern forests good crops are often obtained from the lands on which cattle have been penned during the spring and summer, and it is perhaps strange that this fact did not suggest systematic manuring to the yokels of the neighbourhood. One reason probably why they have not adopted the practice is that till quite recently they were in the habit of moving about from one place to another, never cultivating the same land more than three years running. In the south manuring is now general, though it has only lately become so. In his report on the settlement of parganah Chilliupar, Mr. Lumsden mentions that it had but recently been introduced in that pargana, and the remark holds good regarding the Dhuriapar parganah also.\n\nIrrigation from streams, lakes, and other reservoirs is common, but that from wells is, except in the south of the district, rare. The plentiful supply of water in all but exceptionally dry years renders wells unnecessary over a great part of Gorakhpur; and such tenants as have the means to make wells usually hold what they consider a sufficiently large area irrigable from natural sources. Hence, even near large towns like Gorakhpur, wells are seldom seen, although they might in most cases be constructed without very much expense. The result has of course been that in years when natural supplies have partially failed the crops have suffered severely from want of water. An account of such calamities will be shortly given. How near water lies to the surface in most places, and how easy therefore is the construction of wells, will be proved by the following extract from Mr. Swinton's Manual:\n\n\"In the Gorakhpur district water is often found in the cold season at from five to six feet from the surface, and in no instance have I found a brick well deeper than 29\u00bd feet to the bottom of the excavation with 14\u00bd feet of water in it. The greatest depth of water found in any well was at Maghar, in parganah Maghar, the water being 15 feet from the surface; and the shallowest pukka well found was at Datnagar, between Belwa and Amorha, in parganah Amorha, which was only 13 feet at the deepest part, with four feet of water. The highest parts of the district, judging from the depth at which water is found, are west of Bakhira, in parganah Hassanpur Maghar, where the well is 22\u00bd feet deep and the water 17 feet from the surface; Maghar (in the same parganah), well 20\u00bd feet deep, water 15 feet from the surface; Captainingaj in parganah Amorha, well 18 feet deep, water 12 feet from the surface.\"\n\nNow included in the Basti district.\nand the city of Gorakhpur, well 18\u00bd feet deep, water 11 feet from the surface; whilst the lowest parts of the district would appear to be at Radhan in parganah Hassanpur Maghar, well 11 feet deep, water 5\u00bd feet from the surface; Datnagar in parganah Amorha, well 13 feet deep, water 9 feet from the surface; Amorha in the same parganah, well 13 feet deep, water 9 feet from the surface. At Basti, in parganah Musanagar Basti,\u00b9 the water is about 6 or 7 feet from the surface, but in a well constantly used the water was 14 feet in depth.\"\n\nSeveral other causes besides the natural moisture of the soil have combined to impede the spread of irrigation. These may be summarized as follows:\n\nFirst.\u2014The want of tenant-right not only prevented the free peasant from making wells, but gave him unsettled habits which survived even after the new law had invested him with fixed interests in the land. He was more or less a nomad, shifting the scene of his cultivation from year to year. Such villagers, on the contrary, as were adscripti glebae, hindered by a half-servile status from migrating elsewhere, had neither the will nor the power to make wells from which they could derive no profit themselves.\n\nSecond\u2014Until quite lately, at least, a very large proportion of the proprietors were Br\u0101hmans, Th\u0101kurs, or Bhuinh\u0101rs, who then as now felt that repugnance to labour which makes them as a rule bad cultivators. Neither, therefore, were they disposed to dig wells themselves, nor to spend money on having them made.\n\nThird.\u2014Before the introduction of sugarcane and opium the principal crops were rice, gram, and barley, which are very rarely watered from wells.\n\nFourth.\u2014Owing to the large acreage till recently available for cultivation, it was customary in most parts of the district to allow land to lie fallow every two or three years; and this practice tended to discourage well sinking.\u00b2\n\nFifth.\u2014These causes having rendered it unusual for the fathers to dig wells, except where earthen wells were extremely cheap, their conservative children are slow to recognise the advantages of an innovation which is merely a safeguard against occasional drought.\n\nThe settlement reports of 1860-1865 show that outside the Bhan\u016bp\u0101r Recent increase of and Salempur parganahs well-irrigation is exceptional and wells. chiefly restricted to horticulture, whilst in all parganahs, save perhaps Salempur, water for the fields is derived from streams, lakes, and ponds. Noticing the same fact just forty years ago, Buchanan ascribed it to the greater cost of artificial irrigation in a country where natural is abundant.\n\n\u00b9 Also in the Basti district. \u00b2 Fallowing is now almost confined to the lighter soils of northern parganahs, such as Sidhwa Jobna, which require occasional rest. In the south the general use of manure renders that rest less necessary.\nSince he wrote, the expansion of sugar and opium cultivation has caused a corresponding increase of wells, more especially in southern parganahs like Dhuriap\u00e1r and Salempur.\\footnote{See appendix IX to the Board of Revenue's summary on settlement operations for 1867. This statement, however, does not distinguish between masonry wells built for field irrigation and those serving other purposes. But a third and a half respectively of the large totals returned at the past and present settlements of Gorakhpur-Basti (21,583 and 27,414) are said to represent field wells.}\n\nThere can indeed be little doubt that the great extension of occupancy and probability of rights amongst the tenantry, and the spreading cultivation further increase, of valuable crops which require frequent and certain waterings, must during the currency of the present settlement lead to further increase. If, as is likely, masonry linings are more often introduced to preserve the well, the best safeguard against the distress of drought will have been provided. Even in dry years the water, though sinking too low for many of the earthen wells, often only eight or ten feet in depth, would in most parts of the district be found sufficiently near the surface to fill masonry wells. The extent of the increase is likely in future years to depend much on the nature of the seasons. Dry years with a failure of the natural means of irrigation, though rendering the cultivators less able to afford the expense of well-sinking, will render the practice so obviously advantageous that it must be more generally adopted. Years of abundant rainfall will have an opposite effect.\n\nThe most common form of irrigation is undoubtedly that by the sling-basket (dauri, elsewhere beri). This is worked by two or four men (usually the latter), who, standing above the small basin in which the water is collected, immerse the basket, and then lifting it together with a swing, fling the water it contains into another basin some four feet higher. If the field is on a level with this second basin, nothing more is needed than to let the water thus raised run into the field by a narrow channel. But very often it is necessary to collect the water again in a third basin a little further on, and once more to raise it to a higher stage. Sometimes, therefore, it is raised as many as four stages (bodar); but as a rule one is sufficient. The baskets are round and shallow, about two feet in diameter, and four strings are attached to them, two on each side. Thus, if two men are working, both hands are used, one to each string, and if four only one hand. Sometimes two baskets are worked at the same basin, one close behind the other. In this case both have to be swung in exact time, so as to enable the second to fling in its freight of water before the other returns. The work is fairly hard, and to an unaccustomed hand very hard; it is however not at all unusual to see women taking part in it. The workers almost always work in gangs. The usual number of workers to one basket is six, of whom four work, while a relief of...\ntwo sit out for about ten minutes. Standing in the field upon which the channel is turned, another labourer distributes the water with a wooden shovel (h\u00e1tha).\n\nWater for such irrigation is most often obtained from lakes or tanks, and as these subside, lower channels and basins are dug down to the water from the first, or the original channel and basin are made deeper. In every stage the lower basin, from which the water is lifted, is deep, and the upper, into which it is thrown, is shallow. A larger daily area can be watered by the dauri than by the leathern bucket used in wells; the swing of the former is rapid, whilst lowering and relifting the latter takes a considerable time. The bucket, which is called moth, costs from one to three rupees, according to its size.\n\nMr. Crooke calculates that a party working one dauri with only one stage can water a little over one bigha daily; with two dauris that area would perhaps become half as much again. This is supposing them to work in reliefs from morning to evening, with only the usual interval of about two hours in the middle of the day. From a well with one bucket not more than one bigha could be irrigated, and the usual area is probably rather less. If there are two stages to be worked by basket the space watered would be rather, but not much less than with one: provided always that the water has not very far to flow between the stages. When this is the case, much is necessarily lost through absorption by earth and air. The expense of the bullocks which work the well is about equal to that of the hired labourers who aid the tenant to swing his baskets. The water required for this kind of irrigation is often obtained from the bed of some shallow stream dammed up to supply an ample reservoir. Sometimes, again, it is drawn from running streams; but those of any size have before the beginning of the irrigation season sunk too far below the crest of their banks to be thus utilized. The rice-lands of the north are flooded from dams built across the streams, here so numerous. In some few cases the fields above the dam are injured by water-logging, and complaints are occasionally brought questioning the right to erect or maintain these obstructions of the natural drainage. The host of small but well-fed streams in this part of the district present great facilities for a system of irrigation which would all but avert the danger of drought. In ordinary years little demand for water, or rather little wish to pay the water-rate, could be expected; but as a safeguard against scarcity and famine outlay, such a scheme might more than repay its cost. Perennial streams traverse the northern parganahs within eight or ten miles of one another, and might easily be connected by a net-work of small canals.\nIt is of course possible to be watered too much, and the south-west of the Gorakhpur district has not unfrequently to complain of injury from inundation. The Ku\u00e1na and the \u00c1mi are, as already mentioned, both liable to sudden swellings, which cause them to overflow their banks. In some seasons the Gh\u00e1gra also rises so high as to inundate the lower part of the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Chilliup\u00e1r parganahs. Thus, on the 10th August, 1823, a remarkable and sudden uprising of both Gh\u00e1gra and its tributary Ku\u00e1na flooded the whole of the Amorha, Aurangabad, and South Maghar parganahs of Basti, with a considerable portion of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Chilliup\u00e1r. At the same time the flood waters of the \u00c1mi and R\u00e1pti, which had also overflowed, were blocked back by those of the Gh\u00e1gra. The country round Gorakhpur itself became a sheet of water, and communication with Azamgarh was interrupted for several days. The damage done is described by the collector as \"deplorable.\" Nor was the destruction of several villages the only mischief worked by the flood. The drying of the waters was followed by so much sickness, and their losses had so disheartened the peasantry, that a long time and large Government advances were needed to restore cultivation. In 1839 another flood occurred, but luckily on a much smaller scale. Beyond washing away or swamping a good deal of rice along the R\u00e1pti, it did little damage. In 1840 the performance was repeated; but except in 1871 and 1873, when some small injury was inflicted by the same cause, no floods of much importance have since then occurred. The Gh\u00e1gra about three years ago broke into the Ku\u00e1na just under Sh\u00e1hpur of tappa Belgh\u00e1t, and swept several villages away.\n\nOn the whole the floods of the district have been far less destructive than its droughts; but its rainless years have not been frequent, for only seven have occurred since its cession to British rule (1801). No records have survived to show how often they occurred in earlier times, but tradition mentions two only in which the drought was so great as to cause any serious scarcity in the district. Of these one befell during the long reign of Aurangeb (1658-1707), and probably in 1661. It is said that no rain fell for two years, and that the R\u00e1pti ran almost dry. The R\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed nearly died of starvation; and a Br\u00e1hman family who still hold the village of Pipara in parganah Sh\u00e1jah\u00e1npur are said to have acquired their position by the wealth miraculously bestowed on an ancestor. He was a Br\u00e1hman mendicant, and when the people could no longer give him alms a miracle raised for him large crops of barley on fallow land.\n\n1 Ridsdale's note. 2 \"It is reasonable to infer,\" writes Mr. Girdlestone, \"that the scene of the (1661) famine lay about Dehli and the upper half of the D\u00fa\u00e1b.\" It may also be inferred that the visitation extended to Gorakhpur.\nlands which had never been ploughed. No sooner was the crop cut than another sprung up, and again, after the harvest of the second, a third. By the sale of the produce the Brahman became immensely rich, and purchasing land, became the founder of a powerful family. The second famine occurred about 50 years later, and in it a large number of persons are said to have perished, but no authentic details regarding it are known. Buchanan tells a somewhat strange story of a famine which in 1769 extended even to the beasts of prey. \"Most of the herbivorous animals having then perished, the tigers were famished, and fixing in great numbers upon the town of Bhanap\u00e1r, in a very short time killed about 400 of its inhabitants.\" The remainder fled, leaving the town for some years deserted.\n\nThe first drought recorded after the cession was that of 1803; but a partial failure of the autumn crop and some trifling difficulty in collecting the revenue were its only results. \"The records,\" writes Mr. Girdlestone,\u00b2 \"are almost silent concerning Gorakhpur. I have ascertained that in October, 1803, a considerable exportation of grain to the reserved dominions of the Naw\u00e1b Vaz\u00edr took place. This could scarcely have happened if there had not been supplies enough in store for home consumption. It is also stated that rain fell for many days continuously in August and September. At the time of the cession Gorakhpur was the least populous of all the districts which came into our possession. It is probable, therefore, that, with more moisture and less mouths to feed, the khar\u00edf placed the people above actual want. There are other reasons besides for this inference. The revenue was realized up to March with only trifling balances, and the subsequent monthly accounts show Gorakhpur to have consistently maintained a smaller gross balance than any other district. No remissions were thought needful up to November, 1804, when the crisis had passed.\"\n\nThe next scarcity, in 1809, although it affected only the south of the district, was within certain limits severer than that of 1803, and the spring crop was much injured where no means of irrigation existed. In 1814 a temporary failure of rain caused some damage to the autumn crop; but the spring was saved by a timely fall, nor does it appear that the natural sources of irrigation failed. The next serious drought was in 1837, when the collector reported that the want of rain and consequent depletion of natural water-stores had raised the price of gram from 60 sers per rupee to only 15, and that of wheat from 33 to only 14.\n\n\u00b9 Eastern India, II., 509. \u00b2 Report on Past Famines in the North-Western Provinces (1868), pp. 19-20.\nthis dearth, elsewhere so fatal, seems to have caused in this district little further distress than could be alleviated by a petty remission of revenue (Rs. 208). During the next twenty years Gorakhpur suffered more from inundations and excess of water than from want of it; but in 1850 there was again a partial failure of the autumn crop owing to an insufficiency of rain. In 1860 and 1868-69, to so many districts years of exceptional drought and distress, the Gorakhpur district escaped with little injury. In the former year, indeed, revenue receipts increased, although symptoms of distress showed themselves in an augmentation of crime. Less easy, however, was the lot of the district in 1873-74. The results of insufficient or inopportune rain were aggravated by the Bengal famine, which caused an enormous export of grain stored in previous years. Distress grew so great that it became necessary to open relief works and distribute food to a considerable number of persons. It is to be noted, however, that but for the drain on district produce caused by famine in the Lower Provinces the distress would probably have been slight only; and that it was chiefly the non-agricultural portion of the population who hied to the relief works. In 1875 there was again some distress owing to the same natural causes; and had there been a similar export of grain, there would probably have been just the same state of affairs as in 1874. Fortunately there was not, and the distress was therefore small.\n\nIn mineral resources the district is poor. Here is found no stone except such boulders and pebbles as mountain streams have succeeded in hurtling across the northern border. Nodular limestone or kankar is scarce. Of its two varieties, telia and dudhia, the former is quarried chiefly along the Taraina, the latter in the south country beside the Ghagra. Their average price on the spot is said to be Re. 1-8-0 per hundred cubic feet, but to this must always be added about 8 annas a mile for carriage. The cost of metalling a mile of road with the usual depth of kankar (6 inches) would amount more nearly to Rs. 1,600 than Rs. 1,500. Owing to the dearth of kankar the lime made from that material is expensive and fetches about Rs. 20 per hundred maunds. An inferior kind is sold for Rs. 15. Chunam is a lime made from the stpi, a shell found in the Bhenri Tal and other lakes. It sells on the spot for from Rs. 2 to Re. 1-8-0 a maund.\n\nTwo kinds of brick are made in the district. The smaller, known as lahori, measures about $5'' \\times 4'' \\times 1\\frac{1}{2}''$, and fetches from Re. 1-8-0 to Re. 1-12-0 per 1,000. The larger brick or\npakka lata of 12\" x 6\" x 4\u00bd\" sells for from Rs. 5-8-0 to Rs. 6-8-0 per 1,000. Ordinary flat tiles for roofing are obtained at from Rs. 2 to Rs. 2-8-0 the thousand, but a small kind sells for from Re. 1 to Re. 1-8-0 only. Round tiles fetch about half the price of flat. The figures here given are averages, as the price of tiles varies, and in the rains rises to almost double the usual amount.\n\nThe manufacture of salt is prohibited in the district, and the salt sold comes chiefly from Patna by boats; a large quantity of saltpetre is, however, made.\n\nPART III.\n\nINHABITANTS, INSTITUTIONS, AND HISTORY OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nThe earliest statistics which pretend to number roughly the people of the district are those given by Buchanan, about Population. 1835.\u00b9 Taking Gorakhpur, Basti, and a part of B\u00fatwal since transferred to Nep\u00e1l, he reckons the population at 277,099 families of about 8 persons each, and the area at 7,423 square miles.\n\nHis classification was made by police-circles; and the following are the figures which seem to belong to the present district:\n\n| Area in square miles | Number of families |\n|----------------------|--------------------|\n| 1.

Of that population he classes about 8 per cent. as Muhammadans, and the rest as Hind\u00fas. His statistics are curious, and even labour to enumerate the\n\n\u00b9 Eastern India, Vol. II.\nnumber of single though marriageable girls. But as regards population they are hardly worth scrutiny, resting on certain rather arbitrary premises which are themselves based on very untrustworthy data. Thus he ascertained through native subordinates the number of ploughs in a certain area, and, assuming each plough to represent a certain number of persons, worked out his agricultural population on this basis. The only point worthy of notice is perhaps the very few figures given for P\u00e1li and Nichl\u00e1wal as compared with the adjoining Man-s\u00farganj and Lotan. The devastations of the Nep\u00e1lese war in the two former parganas, and the settlement of numerous immigrants in the two latter, may perhaps account for the difference. Buchanan specially notices the large number of poor gentry who attempted to live on the land, though too proud to till it themselves. And to the demand thus created he attributes the steady influx of labour from Nepal.\n\nThe first regular census of the district took place in 1847. Including Basti, it was found to number 2,376,533 inhabitants, of whom about 1,473,055, or somewhat less than two-thirds, may be taken as the population of the modern Gorakhpur. The following is a brief classification of the figures:\n\n|                  | Agricultural | Non-agricultural | Grand total |\n|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| Hind\u00fas           | 1,779,678    | 331,247         | 2,110,925   |\n| Musalmans        | 198,765      | 66,843          | 265,608     |\n| Total            | 1,978,443    | 398,090         | 2,376,533   |\n\nThe proportion of Musalmans was therefore nearly 12 per cent., and the proportion of the agricultural to the total population about 85 per cent.\n\nIn 1853 the population was for the same area found to be only 2,087,874, the proportion of Muhammadans being over 13 per cent. The distribution by sex and occupation may be thus shown:\n\n|                  | Agricultural | Non-agricultural | Grand total |\n|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|\n|                  | Male.        | Female.         | Total.      | Male.        | Female.         | Total.      | Grand total |\n| Hind\u00fas           | 184,954      | 1,830,589       | 1,915,543   | 286,681      | 212,561         | 499,242     | 1,716,775   |\n| Musalmans        | 136,121      | 126,012         | 262,133     | 57,234       | 51,738          | 108,972     | 271,099     |\n| Total            | 321,075      | 1,956,571       | 2,277,646   | 293,915      | 264,318         | 558,233     | 2,087,874   |\n\nThis result has been obtained by deducting from the grand total the totals for Amorha Nagar, Basti, Bans\u00ed, Rastipur Ghaus, Bin\u00e1yakpur West, Maholl, and half of Maghar.\nThe population of Gorakhpur, excluding Basti, may by the same method as before be reckoned at 1,899,923. Neither, however, of the two returns just given can be viewed with much confidence. In 1865 the population of the same area, still including Basti, was found to be 3,439,513, an enormous increase on former totals. About 2,071,213 of that figure belongs to Gorakhpur, and the remainder to Basti. The details of occupation and sex are as follows:\n\n| Class          | Agricultural | Non-Agricultural | Total |\n|----------------|--------------|------------------|-------|\n|                | Male         | Female           |       |\n|                | Adults       | Boys             | Adults| Girls| Total| Male| Boys| Adults| Girls| Total| Grand total |\n| Hindus         |              |                  |       |\n|                | 738,541      | 533,328          | 119,726| 419,128| 3,300,628| 305,553| 129,671| 181,253| 108,500| 624,976| 3,024,599| ... |\n| Musalmans and others |            |                  |       |\n|                | 86,406       | 60,963           | 38,558| 60,804| 281,736| 42,556| 28,547| 40,962| 21,313| 133,178| 414,914| ... |\n| Total          | 824,948      | 594,190          | 802,294| 469,932| 2,661,359| 248,108| 158,018| 222,316| 129,813| 756,154| 5,439,515| 465 |\n\nBefore the next enumeration took place Basti had been severed from Gorakhpur. The census of 1872, the latest and probably the most correct hitherto effected, gives for Gorakhpur alone a population of 2,019,361, or about 440 to each square mile. There were 7,097 villages and 381,237 houses, of which but 3,019 were built with skilled labour, i.e., of masonry. The average population to each village was thus about 285, and to each house a little over 5. The household in the better class of dwelling averaged 9, and that in the poorer class 5 persons. There were but 184 towns containing populations of over 1,000, and of these only 22 had over 2,000, 12 over 3,000, 6 over 5,000, and 1 over 10,000 inhabitants. So that there were altogether 143 places with populations of between 1,000 and 2,000.\nThe following tables show the distribution of the population in the different parganahs, with statistics of religion and sex:\n\nA.\u2014Population distributed by religion, age, and sex amongst the various parganahs.\n\n| Pargana                  | Hind\u00fas | Muhammadans and others not Hind\u00fas | Total |\n|--------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n|                          | Up to 15 years | Adults | Up to 15 years | Adults | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female |\n| Bhaun\u00e1pur, sadr tahsil portion | 9,982  | 7,936    | 14,108 | 13,513 | 695  | 650    | 1,002 | 788   | 25,787 | 22,887 |\n| Havell, do.              | 45,151 | 85,629   | 64,269 | 59,388 | 5,131 | 4,403  | 8,730 | 8,096 | 128,495 | 107,718 |\n| Maghar                   | 13,734 | 10,984   | 19,185 | 18,296 | 838  | 628    | 1,191 | 1,024 | 34,878  | 30,932 |\n| Bhaun\u00e1pur, B\u00e1ns\u00e1g\u00e1n portion | 7,179  | 5,641    | 9,523  | 9,570  | 439  | 348    | 598   | 554   | 17,739  | 16,113 |\n| Anola                    | 15,251 | 11,581   | 20,127 | 19,385 | 873  | 697    | 1,182 | 1,070 | 37,433  | 33,683 |\n| Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r                | 36,281 | 25,607   | 53,746 | 51,651 | 2,272 | 1,699  | 8,390 | 8,196 | 95,539  | 82,153 |\n| Chilli\u00e1p\u00e1r               | 9,401  | 6,518    | 15,559 | 14,450 | 611  | 433    | 1,006 | 946   | 26,577  | 22,342 |\n| Havelli, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj portion | 47,713 | 38,886   | 65,430 | 61,867 | 5,877 | 5,044  | 8,345 | 7,651 | 137,364 | 113,448 |\n| Bin\u00e1yakpur               | 3,695  | 3,317    | 6,738  | 6,883  | 342  | 284    | 543   | 525   | 11,813  | 10,409 |\n| Tilpur                   | 10,817 | 8,195    | 16,257 | 15,395 | 1,383 | 1,168  | 2,305 | 2,101 | 36,162  | 26,859 |\n| Tappa Batsara, or Batesara | 6,648  | 5,249    | 10,420 | 9,279  | 984  | 759    | 1,352 | 1,249 | 19,413  | 17,536 |\n| Sidhna Jobna             | 68,109 | 52,108   | 105,545| 99,010 | 12,093| 8,998  | 18,395| 17,434| 204,143 | 177,550 |\n| Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur             | 15,555 | 12,218   | 22,088 | 20,989 | 2,431 | 1,914  | 3,216 | 3,151 | 48,290  | 36,272 |\n| Havell, Padranas portion | 14,162 | 11,326   | 20,249 | 18,942 | 1,338 | 988    | 1,696 | 1,636 | 37,131  | 32,690 |\n| Silhat                   | 26,591 | 19,892   | 41,374 | 38,710 | 1,950 | 1,317  | 3,190 | 2,890 | 73,105  | 62,742 |\n| Salempur                 | 56,877 | 40,262   | 100,168| 96,105 | 4,812 | 3,331  | 8,847 | 8,246 | 170,704 | 147,946 |\n\nTotal | 386,595 | 296,274 | 584,790 | 552,786 | 41,939 | 32,661 | 64,718 | 60,587 | 1,078,073 | 94,2781 |\n### B.\u2014Statistics of age in greater detail.\n\n| Hind\u00fas | Muhammadans and others not Hind\u00fas | Total population |\n|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------|\n|        | Male | Female | Percentage of total | Number | Percentage of total | Number | Percentage of total | Male | Female | Percentage of total | Number | Percentage of total |\n|        |      |        |                    |        |                    |        |                    |      |        |                    |        |                    |\n| Up to one year | 30,648 | 3\u00b71 | 25,531 | 3\u00b70 | 3,835 | 3\u00b70 | 33,955 | 3\u00b71 | 28,655 | 3\u00b70 |\n| Between 1 and 6 | 1,47,758 | 15\u00b72 | 1,31,605 | 15\u00b76 | 16,048 | 15\u00b75 | 14,590 | 15\u00b70 | 1,63,806 | 15\u00b71 | 1,46,193 | 15\u00b76 |\n| 6 and 12 | 1,68,004 | 17\u00b73 | 1,13,677 | 13\u00b74 | 18,249 | 17\u00b70 | 12,176 | 13\u00b70 | 1,86,353 | 17\u00b74 | 1,25,855 | 13\u00b74 |\n| 12 and 20 | 1,46,832 | 15\u00b70 | 1,09,919 | 13\u00b70 | 16,540 | 14\u00b76 | 12,456 | 13\u00b73 | 1,62,178 | 15\u00b70 | 1,23,376 | 13\u00b70 |\n| 20 and 30 | 1,83,875 | 18\u00b79 | 1,86,484 | 22\u00b70 | 19,969 | 18\u00b77 | 20,572 | 22\u00b70 | 2,03,844 | 18\u00b79 | 9,07,055 | 21\u00b79 |\n| 30 and 40 | 1,53,759 | 15\u00b78 | 1,41,057 | 16\u00b77 | 17,486 | 16\u00b74 | 15,698 | 16\u00b77 | 1,71,245 | 15\u00b78 | 1,56,859 | 16\u00b76 |\n| 40 and 50 | 82,024 | 8\u00b74 | 73,054 | 8\u00b76 | 9,354 | 8\u00b77 | 7,915 | 8\u00b73 | 91,378 | 8\u00b74 | 8,965 | 8\u00b76 |\n| 50 and 60 | 39,366 | 4\u00b70 | 42,319 | 5\u00b70 | 4,449 | 4\u00b71 | 4,442 | 4\u00b77 | 43,815 | 4\u00b70 | 46,716 | 5\u00b70 |\n| Above 60 years | 19,319 | 1\u00b79 | 24,414 | 2\u00b78 | 2,256 | 2\u00b71 | 2,616 | 2\u00b73 | 21,575 | 2\u00b70 | 27,003 | 2\u00b79 |\n| **Total** | **9,71,385** | **...** | **8,48,060** | **...** | **1,06,687** | **...** | **93,818** | **...** | **10,78,078** | **...** | **9,41,278** | **...** |\n\nIt will be seen that only 9\u00b79 per cent. are Muhammadans, while the rest, an almost unappreciable fraction excepted, are Hind\u00fas. The Muhammadans are most numerous in parganahs Haveli and Sidhua Jobna. But the Muslim population of the latter is mostly composed of the lowest classes, descendants of the camp-followers and soldiers who settled at Padrauna when that place became a cantonment of the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s army in the latter part of the eighteenth century.\n\nThe proportion of males to females is amongst Hind\u00fas 54 to 46, and amongst Muhammadans 53\u00b725 to 46\u00b775. Amongst R\u00e1jputs, a class elsewhere addicted to the murder of their infant daughters, the proportion is the same as amongst Hind\u00fas generally; and the percentage of female babies (below one year of age) is exactly the same in the Hindu as in the Muhammadan population. These returns are, if correct, strong evidence that female infanticide is not extensively practised; and this appears really the case. The great influence of his Br\u00e1hmans over the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1ja seems to have been exerted against the practice; and the Majhauli R\u00e1jas after their conversion to Muhammadanism, if not before, set their face against it. Mr. Ridsdale\u2019s notes cite a collector\u2019s report of 1802, in which a R\u00e1jputani charged with girl\n\n---\n\n1 These must be accepted as mere approximations. The untutored mind of the Indian rustic is rarely able to compute or recall his exact age.\n2 It is not to be supposed that the Majhauli R\u00e1jas are still Muhammadans. They have reverted to their ancient Hindu orthodoxy.\ninfanticide is stated to have urged in defence the recognized and lawful custom of her clan. To support this plea she produced a certificate of the Nagar parganah registrar (k\u00e1m\u00edngo). The court of circuit ordered her discharge and told the collector not to make arrests in such cases before taking their orders. A few years later, however, the offence was declared criminal, and of late years strong measures have been taken to repress it in Basti. Here, as before observed, it seems to have never been at all common. Gorakhpur is one of the few districts in which precautionary measures under the Infanticide Act (VIII. of 1870) have been judged unnecessary.\n\nThe census statistics show that the district contained 119 idiots, 105 persons of partly unsound mind, 772 deaf or dumb people, and 465 lepers. The idiots are most numerous in the Sidhua Jobna pargana, along the banks of the little Gandak, where goitre is also very common. There is a proverbial expression, \"Bhanap\u00e1r ka baule,\" meaning a particularly stupid person; but this refers rather to the general stupidity of the people who used to live at Bhanap\u00e1r than to any prevalence of idiocy in that parganah.\\(^1\\)\n\nThe table last given shows that of the total population nearly 5 per cent. had passed their 60th year, an age which in this country is a great one. The life statistics generally speak well for the climate.\n\nThe density of the population, as ascertained in 1872, was 441 to the statute square mile, against 435 in 1865, 395 in 1853, and 312 in 1847. Taking the density in individual tahsils the returns shew 506 souls to the mile in Gorakhpur, 563 in B\u00e1nsgaon, 259 in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, 499 in Padrauna, and 523 in Deoria. The number of villages or townships inhabited by the population is given by the census as 7,097; and amongst these are now (1878) distributed 8,216\\(^2\\) mah\u00e1s or estates. In 1847 four towns were entered as containing over 5,000 inhabitants; but of these one was Mr. Bridgman's estate, and the other a similar forest grant containing the town of Padrauna. There remained Gorakhpur and Rudarpur, with populations of 45,265 and 5,535 respectively.\n\nIn 1853 such towns had really attained the number of four, excluding Padrauna, whose population is again mixed with that of its enclosing property. The inhabitants of Gorakhpur were returned as 54,529, of Gola as 5,751, of \u00c1mwa as 5,158, and of Barhalganj as 5,058.\n\n\\(^1\\)Mr. Crooke ingeniously suggests that the phrase may be a mistake for bawaha sa-bole, or \"dumb idiot.\" The Sidhua Jobna idiots are, he adds, called baug. \\(^2\\)Or, excluding forest grants, 7,673.\nIn 1865 the number is the same, but the towns are different. The population of Gorakhpur has fallen to 50,853. Rudarpur, with 7,565 inhabitants, has displaced Gola and resumed its place next to Gorakhpur. \u00c1mwa maintains its place with 5,510, and Barhaj (5,080) has superseded Barhalganj. The population of Padrauna is again the population of the grant, and not of the town.\n\nIn 1872 the number has increased to seven, viz., Gorakhpur, (51,117), Rudarpur (6,538), \u00c1mwa (6,150), Gaura kh\u00e1s (5,482), Paina (5331), Gola (5,147), and Padrauna (5,092).\n\nDistributing the Hindu population amongst the four conventional divisions, the census of 1872 shows 193,270 Brahmans (90,382 females); 76,018 Rajp\u00fats (34,888 females); 58,061 Baniy\u00e1s (27,177 females); and 1,492,093 persons as belonging to the \"other castes\" (695,613 females).\n\nThe Br\u00e1hmans are classed as Kanaujiya (187,378), Bh\u00e1t, Bh\u00edkham, D\u00fab\u00e9, Gaur, Gujr\u00e1ti, Gautam, Maithil, Up\u00e1dhia, S\u00e1ras\u00fat, Sarwariya, Sangald\u00edpi, Shukul, Tilang, or unspecified. None of these subdivisions, except the Kanaujiya, numbers more than 5,000 members. Some of them, it should be observed, are not subdivisions at all. D\u00fab\u00e9, Up\u00e1dhia, and Shukul, being mere titles borne by many subdivisions, are for purposes of tribal distinction useless.\n\nThe Kanaujiyas, and therefore the Br\u00e1hmans of the district generally, belong chiefly to the Saw\u00e1l\u00e1khi, Bhu\u00ednhar, Naip\u00e1li, and Sarwariya clans. They are, in fact, inferior of their class; and this circumstance, together with their commonly lax habits, renders them of small account in the eyes of the Brahman aristocracy elsewhere. In his work on Hindustan Castes Mr. Sherring gives the fullest details procurable concerning these local Brahman clans. From his account, and from the earlier history of the district, it seems probable that the Naip\u00e1li, and perhaps also the Kashmiri and Magadha Brahmans, were cut off from their fellow-Aryans by a wave of aboriginal invasion. Cooped up in the neighbourhood of the Nep\u00e1l hills, they may perchance have acquired from their conquerors many habits which they before regarded as corrupt. It has been suggested in like manner that the Th\u00e1rus were Rajp\u00fats who, reduced to submission, were suffered to remain in the north of the country.\n\nThe Saw\u00e1l\u00e1khis or Siw\u00e1l\u00e1khiyas are said to derive their name from low-born ancestors, who, passed off as Brahmans by an ancient king, retained that title ever after. The king had sighed for the honour of feasting at one great\nbanquet 125,000 (sausa lakh) priestly guests; and as the requisite number was not forthcoming, made requisitions on other tribes.\\(^1\\) The numerous D\u00fcb\u00e9s, Up\u00e1dhias, Tiw\u00e1ris, Misrs, Dikshits, P\u00e1ndos, Awasthis, and P\u00e1thakhhs of the district belong mostly to this subdivision. There is nothing to show when they first became Br\u00e1hmans. But the legend may perhaps merely denote that they belonged to the same class as the Naip\u00e1lis, and being found in the country of the aborigines when the Aryans recaptured it, were deemed below the salt.\n\nThe Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs represent a later stream of immigration. Mr. Oldham shows strong grounds for believing them the offspring of Rajp\u00fat fathers and Br\u00e1hman mothers. Buchanan says that they are often treated with contempt as of impure origin, and cites the Domkat\u00e1rs as an instance.\\(^3\\) The Domkat\u00e1rs are not, however, true Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs, but Rajp\u00fats or men of already mixed race who intermarried with the Domras and other aboriginal tribes. The real Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs have always occupied a fairly respectable position, and scout the idea of being connected with the impure aboriginal tribes. Their chief branches are the Gautam, Kinwar, and Gaur. They live exactly like Rajp\u00fats, and will not hold the plough themselves. Sherring notices the use amongst them of the title Singh, and this Rajp\u00fat suffix is not uncommonly attached to their names in Gorakhpur. The R\u00e1ja of Tamk\u00fahi is a Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r.\n\nSarwaria Brahmans derive their name from Sarwar or Sarj\u00fap\u00e1r, a title formerly applied to this district, Basti, and perhaps part of Oudh. The following account of the tribe, supplied by a native lawyer,\\(^4\\) confuses them with the Saw\u00e1l\u00e1khis, but is of interest, as showing what Brahmans themselves say:\n\n\"R\u00e1ma\" he writes, \"invited to the district 16 lads belonging to different clans (gotra) of the Kanaujia Br\u00e1hmans. After investing them with the sacred thread, he gave them lands and titles as follows:\u2014\n\n(1.) The Tiw\u00e1ris, three in number, were sent to Pidi in Salempur Majhauli, P\u00e9la in B\u00e1nsi (of Basti), and Gorakhpur itself.\n\n(4.) The Shukuls to Bhedi of Silhat.\n\n(9.) The P\u00e1ndes to Itaiya in Maholi (of Basti).\n\n(9.) The D\u00fcb\u00e9s to S\u00e1r\u00e1r in Haveli.\n\n(10.) The two Misrs to Dharampur in Maholi and Beri in Haveli.\n\n(12.) The Gautamias to Madhubansi of S\u00e1ran.\n\n(13.) Bhargiwas to Bh\u00e1galpur in Salempur Majholi.\n\n(14.) The P\u00e1thakhhs to Sanaura in Basti.\n\n(16.) The Up\u00e1dhias to Kauria in Maholi.\n\n(16.) The Chaubes to Nay\u00e1npur, also in Basti.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) In an essay on caste, Munshi Kishori L\u00e1\u00ed professes to fix the exact date as 1568. Who the king was seems a subject of much dispute. The name of the tribe may perhaps be connected with that of the Siw\u00e1l\u00edkh hills.\n\n\\(^2\\) Memoir of the Gh\u00e1zipur District, by Wilton Oldham, LL.D., Bengal Civil Service.\n\n\\(^3\\) Eastern India, II., 336.\n\n\\(^4\\) Ganga Pr\u00e1sh\u00e1d P\u00e1nde\nAn Ojha Br\u00e1hman of Tirh\u00fat afterwards settled at Haveli and a Beng\u00e1li Brahman at R\u00e1dhi. The latter immigrant forced the earlier Brahmans to admit him to equality, and all yielded except the Bhargiwa Brahmans of Bh\u00e1galpur.\n\nLater still, a king of K\u00e1shi (Benares) forced a host of persons belonging to other castes to assume the emblems and rights of Brahmans. Their descendants are now known as J\u00fataha in opposition to the true Brahman or P\u00e1thiha; and if any of the latter intermarry or eat with the former, he becomes degraded.\n\nBefore quitting the Brahmans we may briefly notice the kindred Bh\u00e1ts. Mr. Sherring traces their lineage to a Br\u00e1hman father and S\u00e1dra wife; but they are in this district considered descendants of the celebrated Mayyura Misra by a Vaisya bride. Mayyura is often himself styled Bh\u00e1t, but Misr seems to be his correcter title. Of the 3,524 Bh\u00e1ts in the district, some possess considerable wealth. In the census returns all the Saw\u00e1l\u00e1khia and most of the Sarwaria Br\u00e1hmans are entered as Kanaujias. This race is supposed to number 187,378. But very few real Kanaujias exist in the district.\n\nThe principal Rajp\u00fat clans, including those which would more properly be termed Agn\u00edkulas, are the Bais (12,597), Sarnet (7,811), Ponw\u00e1r (5,137), Kausik (4,844), Chauh\u00e1n (3,470), Sengar 2,497, Sakarw\u00e1r (2,243), Gautam (2,198), and Chandel (2,146).\n\nTo the following tribes the census assigns less than 2,000 members each:\n\nBarg\u00fajar, Bh\u00e1t, Bhadauria, B\u00e1chhal, Bargy\u00e1n, Bisen, Bhu\u00ednb\u00e1r, Bil-khariya, Diksh\u00edt, Donw\u00e1r, Dakhanw\u00e1r, Gahlot, Gaur, Gahrw\u00e1r, Jaisw\u00e1r, J\u00e1don, Kutiyar, Kachhw\u00e1ha, Kinwar, Katehriya, Karcholiya, Kusmani, Kakan, Kharag, K\u00e1nhpuria, Malkhan, Mahta, N\u00e1gbansi, Ujjaini, R\u00e1thor, Raghubansi, Raikaw\u00e1r, R\u00e1wat, S\u00farajbansi, Solankhi, Sarwal, Sombansi, Suriya Tilag, and Thapa. About 12,000 Rajp\u00fats remain unspecified. The tribes which may be selected for some description are the Sarnet, Bisen, R\u00e1thor, Kausik, S\u00farajbansi, Gautam, Sengar, N\u00e1gbansi, Chauh\u00e1n, Ponwar, Palw\u00e1r, and Kulh\u00e1ns, the two last not mentioned by the census. The invasion of the Sarnet R\u00e1jas will be described in the historical portion of this notice. The earlier name of their tribe was perhaps Naikumbh; and Mr. Oldham tells how the new title was bestowed by one of the Dehli emperors. Having to enter a doorway, some Naikumbhs preferred to behead themselves on a sword fixed across it rather than bow their heads. But the derivation of the name conferred on their kinsmen by the admiring monarch is scarcely\n\n1 An allusion to the Saw\u00e1l\u00e1khia.\nsatisfactory. Buchanan again derives that term from a band of gold called \"net\" which one of the tribe was allowed to wear when serving at the Delhi court.\n\nThe R\u00e1jas of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, Anola, and Maghar, i.e., B\u00e1nsi, belonged to this clan, and another branch held lands in Gh\u00e1zipur. The tribe is said to have emigrated from Srinagar near L\u00e1hor, but its exact origin is of course uncertain.\n\nThe Bisen clan once held the south-east of the district, spreading thence as far west as Un\u00e1o. Though not pure Rajputs they are highly esteemed, and claim descent from Bhrigu, a saint of the golden age. From Bhrigu also was descended Parasur\u00e1ma; and from Parasur\u00e1ma, Mayyura, already named as the reputed ancestor of the Bh\u00e1ts. The head of the clan is the R\u00e1ja of Majhauli.\n\nThe R\u00e1thors of Gorakhpur are, as noted by Sherring, rather despised by the other castes. This contempt is no doubt due to their former subjection by the Domkat\u00e1rs or Donw\u00e1rs. It is not improbable, moreover, that the remnant left after that defeat formed m\u00e9salliances with the Domkat\u00e1rs and other less respectable tribes.\n\nThe Kausiks claim descent from ancestors of the lunar race, who entered the district with Dhur Chand. Legend traces them from Ham\u00edrpur to Gh\u00e1zipur, where King G\u00e1dh, brother of Dhur Singh, held his court. Ejected thence by the Muslims under Mass\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi, they took refuge in Gorakhpur. The R\u00e1jas of Barhi\u00e1p.ir and Gop\u00e1lpur both belonged to this clan.\n\nThe only important S\u00farajbansi or solar families are found in Maholi, Amorha, and Nagar of Basti. Buchanan identifies them with the Raghubansis, but is probably mistaken. The S\u00farajbansis invaded Amorha under K\u00e1nhdeo, who wrested that parganah from the Bhars. These S\u00farajbansis seem to have been entered in the census returns as Bais.\n\n1 Two alternative derivations are given: one from the Sanskrit sar, a head, and net, a leader, the other from the Persian sarv\u00e1st, headless. \"The Naikumbhs then, as now, only raised the hand to the head; and never bowed the head when making obeisance. The emperor, annoyed by this apparent want of respect of some Naikumbh chiefs in attendance at his court, ordered that before their entrance a sword should be placed across the doorway in such a manner that they, on entering his presence, should be compelled to stoop. Some of the Naikumbh chiefs maintaining their position were decapitated. The emperor, satisfied with this exhibition of their firmness and determination, permitted them in future to make their salam in their own fashion, and gave them the title of Sirnet.\"\u2014Statistical Memoir of the Gh\u00e1zipur District. The Kathiya Rajputs have an exactly similar tradition.\n\n2 Defeat, accompanied by circumstances of disgrace, would suffice to explain any contempt into which the R\u00e1thors may have fallen. Neighbouring Rajputs avoid intermarriage with certain Bisen families of Salempur, whose women are said to have suffered insult during the sack of their village in the mutiny.\nThe Gautams also are chiefly settled in Nagar, where they acquired a dowry of several villages by marriage with the S\u00faraj-bansis. Many of the Gautams entered as Rajputs in the census seem to belong more properly to the Gautam branch of the Bhunih\u00e1rs.\n\nThe Sengars are more numerous in the Basti district than here. Strongly represented in Et\u00e1wa and other Du\u00e1b districts, they seem to have spread thence into Oudh, and from Oudh into Basti and Gorakhpur. They are said to have gained a footing in this district by taking service under a Bhar chief, whom they afterwards deposed and murdered.\u00b9\n\nThe N\u00e1gbansi, as their name implies, are reputed descendants of the Takshak, N\u00e1ga, or serpent race, sometimes called Scythians. They are, however, recognized as indubitable Rajputs, descended according to some accounts from a hero who sprang out of the earth to defend St. Vasishtha's cow. The child of this cow-deliverer was afterwards lost in a forest, when the grateful Vasishtha caused it to be suckled by a snake. The N\u00e1gbansi may probably be descended from the ancient N\u00e1ga race who gave princes to this tract in early times, and the story of a serpent foster-mother may point to the fact of an aboriginal ancestress.\u00b2 Sidhua Jobna and Haveli are the principal homes of the N\u00e1gbansi.\n\nOf the Chauh\u00e1ns the district has few to boast. The founder of the B\u00fat-wal R\u00e1j claimed to belong to this clan, and the claim is maintained by his kinsmen and others whose ancestors were his companions in arms. It is, however, exceedingly doubtful if the story of their flight from Chittor is true. They seem rather to resemble the Domkat\u00e1rs and other mongrel tribes than the later invaders, the Kausik and S\u00farajbansi Rajputs.\n\nThe Ponw\u00e1r or Pram\u00e1ra clan, now so numerous, seems to have entered the district in but small detachments. Its present footing was gradually gained by marriage with the daughters of local chiefs, such as Majhauli.\n\nThe Palw\u00e1rs, again, are not very numerous, but their legends furnish another interesting illustration of the intermarriage of castes in olden times. Their ancestor Patr\u00e1j had four wives of various races, one being a Bh\u00e1r. From the Rajput wife was born a son\n\n\u00b9 A full account of the Sengars will be found in the notice on Et\u00e1wa Gazetteer, IV., 275, 276. The Sengar river in that district is said to derive its name from the clan\n\u00b2 The legend of the cow Kamdhenu and its attempted robbery by St. Viswamitra is somewhat differently told by Buchanan (II., 460, 461).\ncalled Palw\u00e1la, who ejected the Bh\u00e1rs eastward from Faizabad. From this new base a Palw\u00e1r colony invaded Basti, and finally established itself in Gorakhpur also.\n\nThe Chandel and Kulh\u00e1ns\\(^1\\) clans seem to have once possessed considerable tracts in the Basti district, the latter being still largely represented in Ras\u00falpur Ghaus. Buchanan's account of this tribe seems to assert that their ancestor, and not that of the Sirnet R\u00e1jas, destroyed the Domkat\u00e1rs. He was, says this writer, a Br\u00e1hman who came eastwards with his employer, a learned scribe. A Domkat\u00e1r chief having carried off the daughter of this priest, the scribe concerted and successfully effected the plan of poisoning the guards of the Domkat\u00e1r fortress and murdering its chatelain. Having thus outwitted the Domkat\u00e1r, the scribe was himself outwitted by his ungrateful servant the Br\u00e1hman, who managed to establish himself as R\u00e1ja of the newly-conquered domain. This tale is nonsense, and was probably concocted to conceal an origin derived from the intermarriage of Rajp\u00fats and aboriginal tribes. It does not account for the succession of the Sarnet family, or for the existence of Kulh\u00e1ns so far west of the Domangarh fort; and seems copied from a legend which makes a K\u00e1yath and a Br\u00e1hman eject the Bh\u00e1rs from Amorha.\n\nThe following are the principal clans into which the census divides the Baniya or mercantile class:\u2014K\u00e1ndu (29,856), Kasaundhan (9,795), Agarahri (3,883), Baramwar (3,516), Rauniy\u00e1r (2,486), Unaya (2,485), Agarw\u00e1la (2,107), Umar (787), and Kaerw\u00e1ni (367). The remaining tribes\u2014Bandarwar, Chausaini, Dasa, Gindauriya, Jaisw\u00e1r, Mahesri, Rastogi, Rautgi, and Sar\u00e1ogi\u2014have less than 300 members each. The Agarw\u00e1las, who hold a large amount of property in Gorakhpur city and its environs, may be considered the wealthiest of the district merchants. The history of their clan has been given in more than one former notice.\\(^2\\)\n\nThe following list shows the names and numbers of the tribes included amongst the \"other (Hindu) castes\" of the census returns (1,492,093 souls). But in preparing an enumeration of this sort some confusion of Hind\u00fas and Muslims was perhaps inevitable:\n\n| Tribe     | Number |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Agarei    | 484    |\n| Aghori    | 237    |\n| Ahar      | 3,906  |\n| Ah\u00e9ria    | 501    |\n| Ah\u00edr      | 242,383|\n| Arakh     | 143    |\n| Atit      | 4,635  |\n| Bah\u00e9lia   | 984    |\n| Bair\u00e1gi   | 3,132  |\n| Bandgar   | 1,609  |\n| Banj\u00e1ra   | 349    |\n| B\u00e1naphor  | 5,099  |\n| Barawar   | 6,810  |\n| Barhai    | 21,941 |\n| Berh\u00eda    | 15,912 |\n| H\u00e1ri      | 5,861  |\n| Basur     | 75     |\n| Batwar    | 1,932  |\n\n\\(^1\\) Or Kulh\u00e1n. Both forms are used, but that given in the text is the commonest.\n\n\\(^2\\) See Gazetteer, II., 395, and IV., 290.\nWe must now proceed to notice some of the more curious or important races here mentioned.\n\nIf, as before suggested, the Th\u00e1r\u00fas represent the remnant of the Aryan race who remained cut off in the north when the victorious aborigines expelled their kinsmen to south and west, there can be little doubt that they were Rajp\u00fats of the old solar race who had invaded the district from Ajudhia. The arguments in favour of this theory are:\n\n1. The common tradition of the people themselves both here and in the Kumaon Tar\u00e1i asserts that they were Rajp\u00fats who came up at the first sack of Chittor (which might well be substituted for the destruction of Ajudhia or of new K\u00e1shi near Rudarpur by the Bh\u00e1rs).\n\n2. The sacred thread (janeo) is commonly worn by some members of the tribe.\n\n3. The division into g\u00f3t\u00e1s, which is still recognised amongst them.\n\n4. The observance of some Hindu rules, such as the rejection of meat unless killed in the chase.\n\nIt is possible that many later Rajp\u00fat arrivals, who had lost caste by stooping to tillage, were thus reduced to intermarriage, and thereby incorporation, with the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. The chief clans of that race are the Pachhimi and P\u00farabi, or western and eastern. The former affect to despise the latter, and assume the\n\n---\n\n1 Though separately shown by the census, the Bh\u00f3j and Bh\u00e1rbunja tribes are probably identical.\n2 This heading apparently refer to Koris or Sindu weavers. There is a large community of Musalm\u00e1n Jul\u00e1has who have perhaps been entered amongst the Sh\u00faikhs.\ntitle of Chaudhari, which is properly restricted to their barw\u0101iks or headmen. This is all in favour of the theory that some of the Th\u00e1r\u00fas represent a later importation of Rajp\u016bts than the rest. And a further proof perhaps exists in the fact that amongst the Pachh\u00edmis some are known as Khattri, still wearing the sacred thread. But besides the western and eastern, there are several other subdivisions, such as the Dagwaria, Nawalpuria, Marchaha, Kupaliha, Jogith\u00e1ru, Kosith\u00e1ru, Kawasia, and Garhwaria; all of these, however, seem to belong to the P\u00farabi class, being divided between the Barhka P\u00farabi or \"upper,\" and the Chhutka P\u00farabi or \"lower\" eastern. The Pachhimi Th\u00e1r\u00fas refuse to eat with the P\u00farabi; and even between the subdivisions of the latter there are many restrictions on the practice of eating together. This is more curious because most members of the caste will eat pig's flesh and fowls, while all will drink country spirits.\n\nIn character Th\u00e1r\u00fas are peaceable and truthful. They seem rarely to quarrel amongst themselves, and have a horror of courts and cases which, it is hoped, will long continue. Their leading men are intelligent, and their manners are quite as good as those of true Hind\u00fas in the same relative position. The more ignorant of the other tribes are much afraid of them, especially of their women, who are deemed to possess the power of the evil eye, and can blight fields or persons by it. They appear to be worshippers of Mah\u00e1deo, on whom and perhaps on some other deities they bestow the title of lord (Th\u00e1kur). The name Th\u00e1r\u00fa is derived by R\u00e1ja Sivapras\u00e1d from Athw\u00e1ru, a villein who must work every eighth day for his lord; and if Th\u00e1r\u00fas be of Rajput descent, their condition during Bh\u00e1r supremacy could scarcely be far removed from serfdom.\n\nThe Ah\u00edrs are here the most numerous of all the Hindu tribes. The correctness of their numbers, as given by the census, is perhaps rather doubtful, and some Bh\u00e1rs and P\u00e1s\u00eds have perhaps been included in their ranks. But in any case the tribe is certainly very numerous. Their numbers may be explained by the wide extent of first-rate pasturage which still exists, and must have been at the times of the Rajp\u00fat invasions almost unlimited.\n\nThe Ah\u00edrs in all probability accompanied the Rajp\u016bts and Bhui\u00f1h\u00e1rs, tending their cattle and acting as camp-followers or marauders in their wars. Ah\u00edr women, were moreover, in some request as wetnurses; and the favour of a Rajp\u00fat foster-brother has raised more than one family to wealth and\n\n---\n\n1Mr. Beamis takes Barw\u0101ik as the name of a distinct Th\u00e1r\u00fa clan, to which he assigns a Tibetan origin. But the correct meaning of the word is that given in the text. Mr. Crooke adds that the headmen of the Th\u00e1r\u00fas are, like those of other tribes, called Mahto and Chaudhari. He, too, thinks that the customs and general appearance of the clan denote a Tibetan origin.\nOne Ah\u00edr household, with the title of R\u00e1wat, owns a large estate in Hasanpur Maghar. Ah\u00edrs, as a rule, remain faithful to their hereditary calling of herdsmen. But a good many engage also in tillage, and a few earn their living as woodmen, foresters, or carriers. The Ah\u00edrs deny drinking spirits and eating flesh, but in the north of the district are certainly guilty of the former. The Ah\u00edrs separately entered by the census are, Mr. Alexander imagines, the same as Ah\u00edrs; and in that case have no connection with the Ah\u00edrs of Rohilkhand.\n\nThe Cham\u00e1rs stand next in numbers. Like Ah\u00edrs, they seem in this district to have been rather the retainers of Aryan invaders than themselves the invaded aborigines. There is nothing to show any connection between them and the Bh\u00e1rs; and their large numbers are not at all inconsistent with the belief that 400 years ago they were but few. A district which supplies abundant pasturage for cattle soon enough attracts curriers to cure their hides.\n\nBetween Cham\u00e1rs and Koeris intervene, in numerical strength, the Br\u00e1hmans already described. The Koeris are the agriculturists, par excellence, of the district. It is they who keep up the market gardens around Gorakhpur, and produce also the greater part of the opium grown in the district.\n\nNext to Koeris in numerical strength, the Kurm\u00eds or Kunbis possess many villages in the district. Their influence is perhaps greatest in Sidhua Jobna, where the proprietor of the Padrauna tal\u00faka is a Kurmi. His family, like that of many other Kurmis in the parganah, claim descent from the celebrated Mayyura Misra by his fourth wife, thus connecting themselves with the Majhauli and Tamk\u00fahi R\u00e1jas.\n\nIn point of numbers the Rajp\u00fats above mentioned press close upon the Kunbis; and next to the Rajp\u00fats come the Lunias. The name of the Luni\u00e1s or Nunias shows salt-making to have been the ancient occupation of their caste. They now, however, live chiefly by the manufacture of saltpetre and by labour on the roads. Their large numbers are their only claim to notice.\n\nThe Telis or oilmen are also very numerous. But care is necessary to distinguish the caste from the calling; for while some Telis are agriculturists, many oilmen are Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\n1 Such families are known as Barg\u00e1h or Barg\u00e1hs, and hold to some extent aloof from their fellows. 2 Lon or non, salt.\nTheir servile status has perhaps prevented the Bh\u00e1rs from claiming or believing the distinguished history wherewith modern ethnologists have provided them. Some, known as R\u00e1j-bh\u00e1rs, go so far as to claim precedence over other Bh\u00e1rs on account of an unproven admixture of Rajput blood. Bh\u00e1rs are contemned and disliked by Hind\u00fas, who accuse them of devil-worship, but fail to explain why the propitiation of malevolent demons should be worse than the propitiation of Shiva. Mr. Sherring plausibly proves that they were once a powerful aboriginal race ruling from the Nep\u00e1l frontier to the hills of Mirz\u00e1pur.\n\nD\u00f3s\u00e1dhs or Dos\u00e1dhs are by Sherring classed with Cham\u00e1rs, but the identity of the two races is by no means a certainty. Mr. E. A. Reade remarks that many D\u00f3s\u00e1dhs fought in Clive's regiments at Pal\u00e1si (1757), and in the beginning of the century this clan supplied the district with all its village watchmen. These, the only police maintained under the Oudh Government, were repaid by the use of a small rent-free plot and contribution of grain at harvest. Other D\u00f3s\u00e1dhs, after serving in the Nep\u00e1lese wars, received on its conclusion lands in parganah Haveli.\n\nThe Doms or Domr\u00e1s seem an undoubtedly aboriginal tribe. To the present day they live a nomadic life, roaming about without any fixed habitation, and under colour of selling baskets or mats, subsisting chiefly by begging or theft. They are hereditary thieves, against whom the law relating to persons without visible means of subsistence has been constantly enforced. Good figures and intelligent faces often combine to render their appearance not unpleasing. But their glittering eyes and uncombed matted hair give them that wild look which is everywhere common to gipsy life. They themselves assert that there are seven divisions of their race, but the one most common and most troublesome is the Magaya. They will eat almost anything, and gladly accept broken victuals from givers of every creed and class except washermen, with whom all the uncleanliness of cleansed garments is supposed to remain. Their only religion seems a superstitious dread of malevolent local spirits (bh\u00e1t). Their objection to work of any kind gives a good deal of trouble when they at last find a home in the jail. Like the Bhantus of up-country districts, Doms have a language of their own. This seems, however, rather a sort of thieves' latin than a genuine aboriginal tongue.\n\nElliot represents them as founders of the Domangarh castle. But they boast that they never willingly lived in houses or under any shelter more substantial than a craftily constructed thatch of leaves. A few have abandoned\n\n1 Reade's Inferior Castes; Riddale's notes. 2 Criminal Procedure Code, chap. XXXVIII.\ntheir camps for homes in the larger towns; but the thievish propensities and wild habits of the rest have banished them from the more civilized parts of the country. The unhealthiness of swampy forests, the imprisonment of many, and flight of others, have greatly reduced their ranks. But they are the pariahs of the district, despised by every other caste, and should they finally disappear, few will be found to regret their extinction.\n\nThe name of Badhak, meaning assassin, sufficiently denotes the former occupation of the tribe that bears it. They were professional robbers, and furnished recruits to the bands of stranglers (thag) which roamed the district both before and some time after the British occupation. They were sometimes also called Siy\u00e1shm\u00e1rwas, from their habit of killing and eating jackals. The misgovernment of the country shortly before the cession, and the absence of any regular police force, gave grand opportunities to all these robber tribes. And the Badhaks especially grew so numerous and daring, that it was found necessary to keep up a large force of mounted and foot police to guard the frontier against their inroads from Oudh. They were at last declared a criminal tribe, and a large number being seized were located under surveillance near Gorakhpur. Most of the tribe have now settled down on the lands allotted to them. But some now and then contrive to slip away and resume their old trade of gang-robbery. Like the Domr\u00e1s, they have a slang argot once used to prevent bystanders understanding what they said.\n\nThe Chais are here said to be connected with the Kewat subdivision of the boatman (mall\u0101h) caste. Mr. Sherring, however, classes them with Nats and other jugglers. They seem now to belong to no tribe or caste, but to form a mere guild of thimble-rigging thieves. At fairs and other harvests of their trade they appear as a large and well-dressed swell-mob. An article pilfered by one is passed rapidly along through 20 or 30 hands, and the respectable appearance of the thief when arrested, coupled with the absence of the corpus delicti, goes often far to convince the accuser of his innocence. Chais are said to have secret rules binding themselves to provide for the family of any of their number who may be imprisoned for theft committed during such excursions, and to divide the spoil according to a fixed scale. The agreement holds in force only for one expedition, and after the division of the booty each thief is free to join another party if he pleases. But as a rule the same set combine together again.\n\nBantarias are described by Elliot as a class of wood-rangers who received lands from the Native Government untaxed in lieu of police services. They seem really to have been Ahirs. In 1839,\nafter the revision of the police-force, their services were no longer required, and they were allowed to keep the land at a fair assessment of revenue. They then held 39 villages in the north of the Basti district, and their chief or R\u00e1wat maintained a force of 120 musketeers, supplying 25 as a police-guard for the courts of Gorakhpur. Many of the villages are still in their possession.\n\nThe exact origin of the various hill tribes is uncertain, except in the case of the Gurkh\u00e1s, who are probably R\u00e1jputs. Their name has been misapplied to the Pah\u00e1ris who recruit our hill regiments; but the latter have no tribal connection with the ruling race of Nep\u00e1l. Dr. Wright says that the Gurkh\u00e1s, who still retain their Aryan appearance, quitted R\u00e1jputana after the sack of Chittaur in 1568.\u00b9 Settling down near P\u00e1lpa, under the same chief who founded the B\u00fatwal principality, they did not invade Nep\u00e1l until just two hundred years later. Their name, he adds, is derived from Gurkha, a town forty miles west of K\u00e1thm\u00e1ndu, which they occupied for some time before pushing into Nep\u00e1l. It is quite certain that the Gurkh\u00e1s were not heard of under their present name much before 1600 A.D., and that the accounts given by Swinton and others of their invasion nearly a thousand years before is incorrect. Few (if any) Gurkh\u00e1s permanently live in the district: but as their territory borders thereon, this account is not perhaps out of place.\n\nThe Chhatris or Kshatriya hillmen wear the sacred thread and claim descent from Brahman ancestors who wedded mountain wives. They hold in Nep\u00e1l the next place to Gurkh\u00e1s, who, however, keep aloof from them.\n\nThe R\u00e1nas, Magars, Gurangs, and J\u00e1pas come next. They are the soldier castes who mainly recruit our Gurkha regiments; but are allowed to eat with Kshatris only where the food has been first purified with melted butter (ghi). Next come the New\u00e1rs and Garht\u00eds, who represent the trading, mechanic, and agricultural callings. These cannot eat with Kshatris, but do so with the soldier castes. All the six classes last mentioned drink spirituous liquors and eat goat\u2019s flesh or fowls. All have the Mongolian type of features: small eyes, high cheek bones, and broad flattish noses.\n\nThe Limbu, Kir\u00e1ti, and Bhotia hillmen never dwell in the district, but sometimes visit it to trade.\n\n\u00b9 History of Nep\u00e1l (1877), pp. 25, 275-81. See also Elphinstone's Hist., bk. IX., chap. 1, and Thornton's Gazetteer, art. \"Udaipur.\" If the Nep\u00e1l Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jas are descended, as they say, from the M\u00e1b\u00e1r\u00e1ns of Chittaur, Mew\u00e1r, or Udaipur, they belong to the S\u00edsojiya branch of the Gahlot Rajputs. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jas of Vizianagram (Vijayanagar) are a cadet branch of that illustrious family.\nSome account of the Banj\u00e1ras will be found in former volumes.\\(^1\\) But an ingenious local derivation of their name may here be added to those already mentioned. This erratic tribe used, it is said, to fire the woods, and thereby clear out glades on which their numerous cattle might pasture. The practice caused them to be called forest-kindlers (ban, a forest; jdrna, to kindle).\\(^2\\) How they scoured the district towards the close of the eighteenth century will be shown in the historical section of this notice. They have now settled down into traders, carrying grain, salt, and other articles on pack-bullocks from one part of the country to another. The companies in which they travel are generally from twenty to thirty strong.\n\nThe numbers of the Sun\u00e1rs are respectable, but the Sun\u00e1rs themselves are not much respected. There is no doubt that until a short time ago they were mostly receivers of stolen property, and many of them still live by the same felonious trade. A native proverb shows in what sort of estimation they are held:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n& \\text{K\u00e1nta, b\u00e1nta, bahkhara,} \\\\\n& \\text{Badal, bori, p\u00e1n,} \\\\\n& \\text{Yahi men ye lete hain,} \\\\\n& \\text{Chiter ho, soj\u00e1n.}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nwhich is said to mean that, whether weighing with the usual scales, dividing by heaps, swapping (e.g. silver for gold), adjusting the balance, or testing by fire or water, these metallurgists will make something out of you. Verb. sop.\n\nThe following is a list of the slang words used by Sun\u00e1rs to facilitate their frauds. It will be found to resemble in many cases that given by Sir H. Elliot under the heading \"Kasbbara\":\n\n| Castes | Coin, Metals |\n|--------|-------------|\n| Tagna (taga, a thread) | Brahman. |\n| Dh\u00farha (dh\u00far, a land measure), | a samind\u00e1r. |\n| Kl\u00e1r | a Sun\u00e1r. |\n| Masik (masi, ink) | a K\u00e1ya\u0144h. |\n| Sagia (sag, vegetable) | a Koer\u00ed or K\u00farm\u00ed. |\n| Kong | a Musalm\u00e1n. |\n| Khauha (boiling milk) | an Ah\u00edr. |\n| Bokhara | a distiller. |\n| Sishar | a washerman. |\n| Bajina (bajn\u00e1, to ring ?) | a rupee. |\n| Baburi | an ashafri. |\n| Gandhan (wealth) | gold. |\n| Parikh (money-testing) | silver. |\n| S\u00fabh | copper. |\n| Kulhi | brass. |\n\n\\(^1\\) See, for instance, Gazetteer, V, 189-90 (Bijnor notice).  \n\\(^2\\) This derivation is given by R\u00e1ja Sivapras\u00e1d, C.S.I., late Inspector of Schools.\nGORAKHPUR.\n\n| Words connected with weighing. |\n|-------------------------------|\n| Tanganai ... ... ... to weigh. |\n| Tungani ... ... ... scales. |\n| Malna ... ... ... to raise. |\n| Parera ... ... ... correct, sail of scales. |\n| Pariw\u0101r ... ... ... so weighted that one scale remains a little down if so adjusted. |\n| Chimetha ... ... ... with a false beam. |\n| Kokni ... ... ... hollow. |\n| Gadni ... ... ... solid. |\n| Dh\u0101usi ... ... ... a false weight made heavier than it purports to be, used in buying gold, &c. |\n| P\u016bt (p\u016bra?) ... ... a true weight. |\n| Los\u0101ni ... ... ... filings of steel, &c., used for filling up jewellery which is made hollow. |\n\n| Other words ... |\n|----------------|\n| Sojh\u0101na ... ... ... to steal. |\n| Prewa ... ... ... a fool, pigeon. |\n| B\u012bra ... ... ... a sharp fellow. |\n| Kod ... ... ... a thief. |\n| Chunua ... ... ... a man. |\n| Kurti ... ... ... a woman. |\n| Lao\u00b9 ... ... ... dekho, look! |\n\n| Phrases ... |\n|-------------|\n| Tarike palante do ... test and weigh it. |\n| Tepna b\u0101ndho ... don't steal any. |\n\nAfter perusing these words and phrases the reader will probably agree with the natives in their estimation of the Sun\u0101r's honesty.\n\nThe K\u0101yaths are an important tribe by reason both of their numbers and their large landed possessions. The manner in which much of the latter was acquired is creditable neither to them nor our past administration; but some K\u0101yaths made very fair landlords. The chief division is the Srib\u0101stab, which, as noted by Mr. Sherring, receives honorary titles, such as P\u0101nde, K\u0101ntango, Amodha, R\u0101i, Th\u0101kur, and the like. The Srib\u0101stab now often styles himself B\u0101b\u016b.\u00b2\n\nThe Atfhs seem to form a subdivision of the Gosains, and are chiefly noticeable for the number of shares in villages which they have managed to acquire. In Silhat, Sidhua Jobna, Haveli, and Tilpur they are found acting for the most part as ordinary landholders, though some who are part owners of villages still wander about the country.\n\nThe Musalm\u0101ns number altogether 200,372 persons, of whom 93,969 are female. The great bulk (126,835) are Shaikhs. Muhammadians never had in this district the same influence as in\n\n\u00b9 Found sometimes in book Urdu as lo. \u00b2 It appears that in the district itself this division of the K\u0101yatha is sometimes misnamed Sri Bais.\nmost others of the North-West. There are now a few families of some importance, but none of any antiquity.\n\nOne of the most striking results is the extent to which the Muslim population has become Hinduised.\\(^1\\) Many observe the Hindu festivals, and some even go so far as to offer sacrifices of animals at shrines which, like that of Gorakhnath, may not be strictly Hindu, but are certainly not Musalm\u00e1n. Some of their leading men, again, eat nothing which has not been cooked by Brahmins, and the tomb of Kabir at Maghar is in charge of two custodians\u2014one a Hindu, the other a Muslim. The Musalm\u00e1ns always paid great homage to the tomb and the memory of its occupant. Yet Kabir was named by a Br\u00e1hman, and refused circumcision, besides making a pilgrimage to the temple of Jagann\u00e1th in Orissa, and otherwise showing his partiality towards Hinduism.\n\nHind\u00fas, however, are on their side equally willing to reciprocate the tolerance or laxity of the Muslims. They take part in such Musalm\u00e1n rites as those of the Muharram. The Muharram, which should be a mournful fast, is here a noisy festival; and its warlike processions are joined by all the idlers of the town. But as Hind\u00fas in some cases make offerings to what are intended for representations of the tomb at Karbala and the cave at Medina, it is clear that they regard these solemnities as something more than a mere spectacle. So also at the ceremonies held in honour of that somewhat mythical young martyr, S\u00e1l\u00e1ri-Masa\u00fad. Gatherings which might be thought especially likely to produce ill-blood between the two creeds are attended by large numbers of the poorer Hind\u00fas.\n\nMuhammadans are most numerous in the neighbourhood of Gorakhpur. When the R\u00e1ja of Salempur was converted, few Hind\u00fas followed his example. The bulk of the parganah is held by Br\u00e1hmans who obtained grants from former R\u00e1jas or members of the family who still remained Hind\u00fas, and the family itself has reverted to Hinduism. The chief Muhammadan families are those of W\u00e1jid Ali Sh\u00e1h, known as the M\u00fan S\u00e1hib of Gorakhpur; of Sayyid Sh\u00e1h Abdull\u00e1h Sabzposh, also of Gorakhpur; the Pind\u00e1ris of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r; and the Sayyids of Shakpur in the same parganah. Of the Christian population more than the usual proportion are European landholders. Mr. Bridgman owns a very large area in both Gorakhpur and Basti, and his estate is perhaps the best managed in either of these districts.\n\nThere are a few Sikhs, but they possess little influence, and their religion is not at all generally followed.\n\n\\(^1\\) They are perhaps the descendants of converted Hind\u00fas not quite thoroughly Muslimised.\nThe census thus divides the people, according to occupation, into those who get their living from the land and those who do not:\n\n| Religion | Agricultural | Non-Agricultural | Total |\n|----------|--------------|------------------|-------|\n|          | Landowners   | Cultivators      |       |\n|          | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female |\n| Hind\u00fas   | 72,967 | 66,740 | 233,150 | 630,957 | 175,269 | 150,833 | 971,385 | 848,060 |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns | 1,283 | 1,219 | 70,473 | 62,231 | 31,646 | 29,510 | 106,403 | 92,969 |\n| Christians | 2 | 3 | 124 | 74 | 158 | 172 | 284 | 249 |\n| **Total** | **74,252** | **67,962** | **793,748** | **693,292** | **210,073** | **180,024** | **1,078,078** | **941,276** |\n\nThe agricultural population numbers, therefore, 1,629,254 souls, or 80\u00b76 per cent. of the whole. Of these 132,507 are Muhammadan, and the rest Hind\u00fas. The percentage (8\u00b723) of the former is extremely low, but there exists little reason to doubt its accuracy. Of the Hind\u00fas 189,707, and of the Musalm\u00e1ns 2,502, are landholders. The total gives a percentage of 8\u00b771 landowners to every 200 agriculturists, which is rather a low proportion, considering the number of villages and shares distributed by grants in birt.\u00b9 The proportion of Muhammadan to total landowners is 1\u00b757 per cent.\u2014a further proof of the small influence they possess in the district. Taking the total agricultural population, we find 1\u00b716 acres of cultivated land to each individual; and as we may assume about one able-bodied cultivator to every five individuals, the average holding must contain about 6 acres.\n\nThe returns of 1872 divide the adult male population into six classes, of which the fourth is the agricultural; and distributes as follows the classings of the remaining or non-agricultural classes. The first or professional class embraces all Government servants and persons following the learned professions or literature, artistic or scientific occupations. It numbered 2,999 male adults, amongst whom are included 191 puroh\u00edtes or family-priests, 218 pandits or learned Hind\u00fas, 99 musicians, and so on. The second or domestic class numbered 27,107 members, and comprised all males employed as private servants, washermen, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, innkeepers, and the like. The third represents commerce and numbered 10,389 males; amongst these are all persons who buy or sell, keep or\n\n\u00b9*Infra, \"Tenures.\"*\nlend money and goods of various kinds, such as shop-keepers (4,005), money-lenders (955), bankers (224), brokers (36), and all persons engaged in the conveyance of men, animals or goods, such as boatmen (1,946), pack-carriers (1,479), and ekka or cart-drivers (357). The fifth or industrial class, containing 33,861 members, includes all persons engaged in the industrial arts and mechanics, such as necklace-makers (294), masons (320), carpenters (1,977), and perfumers (16); those engaged in the manufacture of textile fabrics, such as weavers (3,994), tailors (1,104), and cotton-cleaners (967); those engaged in preparing articles of food or drink, such as grain-parchers (538) and confectioners (308); and lastly, dealers in all animal, vegetable, or mineral substances. The sixth class contains 55,437 members, including labourers (51,608), persons of independent means (203), and persons supported by the community and of no specified occupation. The field labourers, as opposed to those who, like the beld\u00e1rs and Lunias, work chiefly on roads and other public works, should perhaps be included in the agricultural population. The number of boatmen, though large, is probably understated. Almost all the very considerable heavy traffic of the district is carried by water. The chief resorts of barges are Barhaj, Dh\u00fani, Gorakhpur, Gola, and Barhalganj; but their constant passage from one place to another must always render their enumeration somewhat difficult. During the past ten years but 7,322 inhabitants of this district (1671 females) have been registered for emigration beyond seas. Their principal destinations were Trinidad, Mauritius, Jamaica, Demerara, and the French West Indies.\n\nFrom the occupations of the people we may pass to notice some of their customs and mode of life. The councils known as panch\u00e1yat are mostly in vogue amongst the lower castes. The members are elected by the votes of the brotherhood. Their number, originally five, is now rather indefinite, and in some cases includes every present adult male of the fraternity. The panel is most often convened to decide questions of caste morality. Its sentence on the offender takes as a rule the form of a money fine; and this is usually spent in feasting as many members of the caste as possible, the judges themselves being always included.\n\nAn appeal often lies from this primitive court to the chaudhari or headman of the clan, who was until lately a personage of much recognized importance. It is said that chaudharis were at first peculiar to the Baniya and Kah\u00e1r castes. They have now been adopted by every class except Br\u00e1hmans, Rajp\u00fats, Agarw\u00e1la Baniy\u00e1s, K\u00e1yaths, and the\nupper order of Musalm\u00e1ns: by every class in fact that holds panch\u00e1yats. The lower Musalm\u00e1ns, such as weavers (Jul\u00e1ha), are not without their chaudharis. The office is, as usual in India, hereditary. But if the successor is considered unfit, the members of the caste concerned elect a panch\u00e1yat, who, after enquiring into the claims and qualifications of each candidate, appoint a new chaudhari. In important elections, such as that of a headman for the Baniy\u00e1s of the chief market in Gorakhpur, Government assent was till very recently necessary. And the chaudhari was held responsible for any serious breach of the peace within his jurisdiction.\n\nFor his services, such as they are, the chaudhari is repaid in several different manners:\n\n(1). If he be headman of a market, he receives a small percentage, often \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) ser (about \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) lb.) in the rupee\u2019s worth, of all grain sold. In S\u00e1hibganj baz\u00e1r, however, he gets a fixed sum (about 8 annas a month) from each trader who uses the market. Any dues levied by the landlord of the baz\u00e1r are collected by the chaudhari.\n\n(2). If he is headman of a craft or caste, like the carpenters or blacksmiths, he is paid by a percentage on their earnings, usually about one-third of an anna in the rupee.\\(^1\\)\n\n(3). If he belongs to some class, e.g., the Mall\u00e1h, in which this arrangement would not work well, he is usually remunerated by presents of two or three rupees at marriages, and by one-fourth of all fines levied under orders of the panch\u00e1yat for caste offences.\n\nThe diet of the labouring classes is usually limited to one meal a day, with perhaps a remnant for the evening. The food is coarse rice (mot\u00e1 dhan), kirao pulse, barley when cheap, and cucurbitaceous fruits, such as the lauki and nenua. Water-nuts (Trapa bispinosa) are eaten when obtainable; and in years of scarcity the berries and roots of the forest. A man\u2019s food costs from \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) ths to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) ths of an anna per day. The middle classes eat all kinds of rice, barley, arhar pulse, wheaten flour where cheap, and fish. The average cost is two to three annas a day. The higher classes eat the better kinds of the same grains, fish, and fruit, which is very abundant. Except by Muslims and the lower castes of Hind\u00fas, flesh is always avoided. Those who eat neither flesh nor fish are known as Bhagats or ascetics.\n\nThe houses in this district are almost all tiled, as thatch is found not to stand the heavy rainfall. The walls, as a rule, are of moistened earth well plastered. In the neighbourhood of the forests, however, they are built of brushwood woven round upright posts,\\(^1\\) e., about \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) per cent.\nand the roofs are often mere leaves matted strongly together by means of bamboo splints. The cost of a common tiled house in an ordinary village is, including the price of labour, from Rs. 20 to 35. That of a better class building, with well-beamed roof and doorways and the best tiles, is from Rs. 50 to 75. The brick houses, which are usually two-storied, have a good deal of woodwork about them, and demand an outlay of from Rs. 350 to 25,000 or more.\n\nTurning to religious buildings, we find two or three well-marked forms of Hindu temples. The oldest consists of a square base, with a sharp pyramidal roof or spire, thus:\n\nThe next is similar, but the lines of its spire are convex instead of straight, thus:\nThe third is a further development of the second form into the dome usually adopted for Muhammadan mosques, thus:\n\nThe expense of building an ordinary sized temple is said to be Rs. 2,000; a mosque, being usually larger, would cost more.\n\nThe absence of fanaticism amongst the Musalmans has been already noticed. They are mostly Shias, but the more influential among them are, with the exception of the Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, Sunnis. The Br\u00e1hma Samaj is not making much progress, but has been adopted by a few educated men in Government employ. The Christian religion gains a few converts yearly, but has never made any marked advance. The Christian village of Bish\u00e1ratpur was founded in the last decade by Mr. Wilkinson, a missionary. It has already a fair number of inhabitants, who support themselves partly by agriculture.\n\nHinduism is of course the prevailing religion, and its votaries may be divided into the following classes:\n\n(1). Those who have no marked preference for any one deity as compared with another, and will worship anything provided that it has been daubed with a splotch of red paint, and the worship is not forbidden by their Brahmans. These are the uneducated, and therefore the majority, of Hind\u00fas.\n\n(2). Worshippers of Siva or Mah\u00e1deo, the destroying god, and his consort, P\u00e1rvati or Bhaw\u00e1ni. These are the most numerous of the more educated sectaries.\n\n(3). Worshippers of Vishnu, the preserving god. These are not so numerous.\n\n(4). Worshippers of Vishnu\u2019s incarnations, R\u00e1ma and Krishna. These are rather deified heroes than deities, and, being more human than the gods just\nmentioned, are perhaps more popular. A portion of the respect paid to Rama is extended to his wife Sita and his monkey ally Hanuman.\n\n(5). Worshippers of local deities and of deified mortals, such as Gorakhnath and Kabir. This class perhaps includes more persons than any except the first.\n\nAs elsewhere, the great mass of Hind\u00fas have no very clear ideas on religion, as distinguished from caste formalities and rites connected with such events as birth, death, or marriage. Their creed may be summarised as a belief in supernatural beings with power to harm them, and in the sanctity of Brahmans. A general worship is accorded to all the deities above detailed.\n\nBut it is to the local divinities and the local shrines that persons seeking special favours have recourse. The chief of such shrines is undoubtedly that dedicated at Gorakhpur to Gorakhnath, a personage who probably lived no earlier than 1400 A.D. This is in fact allowed by the more intelligent of his worshippers. But they explain that both Gorakhnath and his preceptor, Machhendar Nath, were merely illusions sent to reveal the shrine which had been built in the golden age, and that Machhendar Nath is really a name for Vishnu. Other legends relate that Machhendar Nath was a form of the Fourth Buddha, Loheswara, and that he acquired the name because he assumed the form of a fish (matsya) to listen to Siva. His residence was on the hills beyond Nep\u00e1l; and Gorakhnath, having produced a drought in that country, got him to descend into the valley, where he worshipped him and obtained a blessing.\n\nThe present shrine is said to have been built by Fidai Khan, to whom the tomb of Kabir at Maghar is also attributed; but is really much later. It is acknowledged that the first temple was destroyed by order of the bigoted Aurangzeb (1658-1707), and Wilson says that the present temple was built by Budhenath, a prior (mahant) of monasteries, who lived not more than eighty years ago. This temple is visited by over 10,000 people on the Shivratri festival. The temple of Siva at Dudh Nath, in the forest between the capital and Rudarpur, that of Parasu Rama at Sohnag in Salempur-Majhauli, and the images near Kasia, are, with the above shrine and the tomb of Kabir, the chief goals of pilgrimage amongst the common people. Both the figures at Sohnag and those at Kasia appear to be representations of Buddha. But their origin has long been lost sight of, and it is to the glamour of mysterious antiquity that the sanctity of their unknown gods must be assigned. The temple at Dudh Nath and shrine at Maghar perhaps owe their celebrity to much the same feeling.\n\n1 In Phalgun (February-March.)\nThe language of the common people is a peculiar variety of the Bhojpuri dialect. It in many cases approaches Bengali rather than Hindi; but would probably be just as unintelligible to a native of Bengal proper (excluding Tirhut) as to one from Agra. Bishan Dat Pande has written on this subject a book which, if not printed already, certainly merits printing by Government; and an elaborate analysis of the local grammar will be found in the appendix to Mr. J. R. Reid's Azamgarh Settlement Report. From these sources, and some notes kindly supplied by Mr. Crooke, have been taken the following brief particulars:\n\n**Verbs.**\n\n(1). The present tense of the verb \"to be\" is almost always supplied by an old root distinct from that of hona, thus\u2014\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1st. Main or mon bdtan. | Hamhan bdtan. |\n| 2nd. Tain bate. | Tunhan bato. |\n| 3rd. Ut bd. | Unhan baten or bdtain. |\n\nThe present tense of other verbs is conjugated in the same manner.\n\n(2). The infinitive and future tense are always formed with a b termination, as rahab, to remain; main rahabon, I shall remain. The latter is thus conjugated:\n\n| Singular | 1. Main rahabon=main rahange, &c. |\n|----------|----------------------------------|\n|          | 2. Tain rahabe.                  |\n|          | 3. Ur rahab.                     |\n\n| Plural   | 1. Hamhan rahab.                |\n|----------|---------------------------------|\n|          | 2. Tain rahabo.                 |\n|          | 3. Unhan rahabain.              |\n\n(3.) The past participle and past tense are compounded of the root and an l suffix. Thus m\u0101ral struck; main rahal, I remained; tain dekh\u0101t rahlo, you kept looking.\n\n(4.) The active past tense is hardly ever formed with the usual ne, but by l, and terminations changing according to the person. Thus\u2014Uhmari-lus=us ne m\u0101ra; uh marlen=unhon ne m\u0101ra.\n\n**Pronouns.**\n\n(1). The pronoun of the 1st person is thus declined:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| N. Main or mon. | Hamhan, hamhan. |\n| G. Mor, mori, mora. | Hamor, hamari, hamare. |\n| D. Acc., monkhe, moke. | Hamranke hammanke |\n| Ab. Monse. | Hamanse. |\n\nIt is a mistake, as pointed out by Dr. Fitz Edward Hall (Hindi Reader), to suppose that this root has any connection with that (bks) which supplies the preterite bhayad. So, elsewhere in the Benares division, puchheba is used for puchhega, and the like. This is in fact merely another instance of the interchange of b and g. The most familiar illustration that can perhaps be selected is the change from Guillaume to \"Bill.\"\n(2). As in other modern languages, the pronoun of the 2nd person is rarely used in the singular. The plural is thus declined:\n\n**Honorific.**\n\nN. Raws (sp).\nG. Raws or raste.\nD. Acc. raws.\nAb. Raws log se (?).\n\n**Ordinary.**\n\nTain, tushan.\nTuhdr, tor, tushanke, tuharkane.\nToke, torake, tushanke, tuharkane.\nTuhee, tote.\n\n(3). The declension of the demonstrative pronouns, those of the 3rd person, may be shown thus:\n\n**Singular.**\n\nN. \u00da or \u00fa (ush or yih).\nG. Ohar, char, chari.\nD. Acc., Ohark, charik, etc.\n\n**Plural.**\n\nUnhan, inhas.\nUnhanke, charanke, inhanke, charanke.\nDitoo, ditte.\n\nBut besides these peculiarities in verbs and pronouns there are many others. Such is the habit of using what may perhaps be called diminutives, instead of the original nouns. Thus ghurawa is more often heard than ghora, kodua than kodo, dhobinia and bitiya than dhobin and beti. The participles barhka and chhutka are used instead of their cognate adjectives bara and chhota. A large number of words formed by metathesis from more familiar forms are commonly used in this district. Champona, or chaupna for instance, takes the place of pahunchna, niman of umda, lanish of ndlish, and khawan of khardb. A complete list would fill several pages, but a Rural Glossary is being compiled by Mr. Crooke.\n\nNo local literature, even in the form of a newspaper, exists. The district can boast of one printing press at Gorakhpur.\n\nThough still sadly deficient, education has of late years made considerable progress. How much better than their fathers the rising generation are instructed is shown by some statistics taken at the last census (1872). Of those over 12 years of age only 1\u00b79 in 1,000 were found able to read and write; but amongst those under 12 the proportion rose to 3 in 1,000.\n\nAbout 1835, Buchanan\u00b9 noted that the ordinary country dialect was universally employed; that in many divisions of the district there was not a single schoolmaster, and that, except children of literate parents and the highest families, none learned to read and write. The schoolmaster, who was affectionately and even respectfully addressed as Bhaiyaji, in some places taught during the rains alone. Writing only Devanagari, and not the cognate characters used in business, the Pandits were useless for ordinary correspondence. In 1847 the Collector, Mr. Tucker,\u00b2 remarked that \u201cwith the exception of some Brahmins to calculate fortunate moments, some Kayath officials, and a few respectable Muhammadans, a population of 2\u00bd millions was in a state of utter ignorance.\u201d\n\n\u00b9 Eastern India, II, 429.\n\u00b2 Educational Statistics compiled under orders of Government, N.-W. P., by Mr. R. Thornton, C.S.: Calcutta, 1850.\nIn the whole district, which was then vastly greater than at present, there were but 428 schools; of these 243 were Persian, 170 Sanskrit, and the remainder Hindi. In the Persian schools the *Daulat-i-Hind*, a work on gardening and agriculture by Mr. Fenwick, was much appreciated; but these schools seemed less susceptible of improvement than the Hindi, whose teachers showed less self-confidence and presumption. The total number of school-attending children was 3,808, of whom the bulk were Brahmins (2,239) and Kayaths (775).\n\nThe system of *halkabandi* or primary village schools was introduced in 1849, but cannot be considered to have made any real progress until after the mutiny. There are now (1877-78), as shown in the following statement, 180 such seminaries:\n\n**Statistics of schools in the Gorakhpur district, 1877-78.**\n\n| Class of school | Number of schools | Hindus | Muslims | Others | Average daily attendance | Cost per head | Expenditure borne by the State | Total charges |\n|-----------------|------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| Zila or district (middle B.) | 1 | 83 | 57 | ... | 110\u00b798 | 18\u00b707 | 1,915 | 2,006 |\n| Tahsili and parganah | 7 | 370 | 64 | ... | 329\u00b755 | 5\u00b76 | 1,823 | 1,866 |\n| Halkabandi | 180 | 687 | 299 | ... | 62\u00b755 | 2\u00b77 | 17,019 | 17,103 |\n| Government and municipal | 2 | 53 | 1 | ... | 35 | 7\u00b76 | 267 | 267 |\n| Municipal boys | 5 | 205 | 51 | ... | 193 | 2\u00b773 | ... | 528 |\n| \" girls | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n| Aided by Boys | 11 | 561 | 138 | 139 | 678 | 11\u00b734 | 8,816 | 9,690 |\n| Girls | 6 | 34 | 25 | 138 | 136 | 13\u00b766 | 504 | 1,777 |\n| Unaided, ... | Missionary and Indigenous | 195 | 594 | 87 | ... | 844 | 1\u00b78 | ... | 1,178 |\n| Total | 40 | 877 | 721 | 277 | 8881\u00b753 | 43\u00b714 | 25,344 | 34,416 |\n\nAll these schools are supervised by the Inspector of the Benares Division, in concert with the local educational committee. Of the latter the Magistrate is, as usual, *ex officio* President, and one of his Assistants, Secretary. The committee exercises direct control over all schools except the zila school at Gorakhpur. This is of the middle B. class, which instructs boys up to the standard of the middle-class vernacular examination. The Inspector reports somewhat unfavourably on this school, and, unless it improves \u201cafter not too long a period, could not advise its maintenance in its present status.\u201d\n\nThe tahsili and parganah schools are at Barhalganj, Majhauli, H\u00e1ta, R\u00e1mkola, Siswa, L\u00e1rh, and Piprauli. The results of the middle-class vernacular examination showed that of these\nschools Barhalganj alone could be \"classed as efficient.\" Of the halkabandi schools 8 are returned as upper and the remainder as lower; of the former three are pronounced \"really,\" and the rest \"fairly good.\" The returns of attendance may be deemed as accurate as careful and persistent scrutiny can make them. Teachers have been warned against keeping on the roll dummy names, and informed that quality not quantity, the efficiency of the school and not its numbers, is the point on which their credit depends. Here as elsewhere there is great difficulty in obtaining good halkabandi masters. \"It is almost impossible to get good local men on the present pay (Rs. 5 to 10 monthly); while outsiders, even if better qualified from an educational point of view, entirely fail to conciliate or command the respect of parents; and schools under their charge rapidly dwindle away and become comparatively useless.\" Fees levied at 6 pie per head monthly on the children of non-agriculturists have reduced the attendance in these schools, and it has been decided no longer to charge such fees for elementary instruction. The progress of other schools detailed above has been satisfactory, but not such as to call for special notice.\n\nThe increase of education is perhaps attested by the increase of post-office transactions during the past ten or fifteen years. That increase may be shown as follows, by a statement of financial results:\n\n| Year | Miscellaneous savings, fines | Passengers and parcels | Deposits, guarantees, family funds | Remittances | Postage | Total receipts | Charges, fixed and contingent, salaries, &c. | Mail service | Remittances | Other charges, refunds, advances, printing | Cash balance | Total charges |\n|------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|------------|---------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|--------------|\n| 1861-62 | 74                          | 2,125                 | 20                               | 5,091      | 5,780   | 13,090        | 5,094                                      | 2,126        | 6,287     | ...                                      | 140         | 13,647       |\n| 1865-66 | 219                         | 187                   | ...                              | 5,375      | 5,992   | 11,778        | 2,048                                      | 3,317        | 6,038     | 323                                      | 47          | 11,778       |\n| 1870-71 | 292                         | ...                   | 79                               | 17,747     | 9,177   | 27,295        | 12,956                                     | 4,217        | 9,892     | 70                                       | 160         | 27,295       |\n| 1875-76 | 57                          | ...                   | 98                               | 18,640     | 9,642   | 28,437        | 18,563                                     | ...          | 9,628     | 103                                      | 148         | 28,437       |\n\nThe receipts from staging bungalows were formerly credited to post-office instead of public works, and amounted in the first of the years here mentioned.\nto Rs. 3,847. There are 18 imperial and 18 district post-offices, the former being divided into one central (sadr) and two subordinate, with their respective branch offices. The imperial offices are at Gorakhpur (central), Barhalganj, and Tamkahi (both subordinate), Bansgaon, Belaharia, Deoria, Hata, Kasia, Lahr, Maharajganj, Mansurganj, Padrauna, Pipraich, Rigauli, Rudarpur, and Salempur (all branches to central office), Barhaj and Gola (both branches to Barhalganj). The district offices are at Barhi, Belghat, Biraicha, Chaura, Kazipur, Khanpur, Kotibh\u00e1r, Musola, Nichlaval, Panera, Pi\u00e1sia, R\u00e1mkola, Semra, Sahnjanua, Tarakulwa, Tutibh\u00e1ri, Bishanpur, and Taria Suj\u00e1n.

To the misgovernment of the Oudh prefects (amil) police was unknown; and during the brief re-establishment of native authority in 1857 many landholders clamoured for the abolition of this foreign innovation. The modern gurait or village watchman was represented in ante-cession times by the d\u00e1s\u00e1dh, a servant or official paid by the villagers to guard their crops. But in the north there existed a special gendarmerie known as Bantari\u00e1s, who perhaps held rent-free land in payment of their supposed services in tracking offenders and recovering stolen goods from the forest. The grant of rent-free holdings was certainly confirmed to them about the time of the Nepalese war (1814).\n\nUnder the system introduced with the Company's government (1801), the tahsildars were supposed to maintain a police force out of the percentage (11\u00bd per cent.) allowed them on the revenue. But, owing to the untrustworthiness of the tahsildars themselves, and the opposition of influential landholders, this practice soon declared itself a failure. In 1809 a force of barkand\u00e1z or grenadiers was organized to protect treasuries and travelling treasure; but of\n\n1 No record of covers despatched has during late years been kept.\n2 Wingfield's Mutiny Narrative, para. 38.\n3 Elliot's Supplemental Glossary, art. \"Bantaria.\"\n4 \"Lightning thrower\" is the literal meaning of this title.\npolice work, in the sense of protecting private property, they did nothing. Stations for these barkand\u00e1z were established at the tahsils and some places of importance along the high roads, such as Barhalganj and Nichl\u00e1val; while along the Oudh frontier a strong force of mounted police was kept up to prevent the irruption of Badhaks and similar marauders from that misgoverned country. About 1818, officers were first appointed to the permanent charge of barkand\u00e1z posts, with power to arrest and send up for trial criminals offending within their jurisdictions. And this would appear to have been the germ of the police circle (th\u00e1na) system.\n\nAbout 1835 again, when a revision of the police administration took place, the number of th\u00e1nas was increased, and an efficient force assigned to each. This measure was by no means premature. Some of the jurisdictions extended over 800, 900, and even 1,000 square miles. The \u00e9lite of the police, we are told,\u00b9 were still employed in preventing the invasion of criminals from Oudh. But what immediately led to enquiries and reform was the repeated execution by their captors of thieves caught red-handed in the theft. The impossibility of obtaining legal redress in the general dearth of policemen perhaps left the party of order no other alternative.\n\nThere are now 40 police stations, whereof 16 are of the first, 18 of the third, and six of the fourth class. The first class stations, which have usually a sub-inspector, two head and a dozen foot constables, are at Gorakhpur city, B\u00e1nagaon, Padrana, H\u00e1ta, Barhalganj, Gola, Rudarpur, Khukhandu, Barhaj, Kasia, L\u00e1rh, Belgh\u00e1t, K\u00e1zipur, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, Tarakulwa, and Semra. The third class stations, to which are generally attached two head and six foot constables, are at Deoria, Mans\u00farganj, Rigauli, Rudarpur, Barhi, Chaura, Khanap\u00e1r, R\u00e1mkola, Taria Suj\u00e1n, Kotibh\u00e1r, Baraicha, Nichl\u00e1val, Pi\u00e1sia, Panera, Pipraich, Bishanpur, Sahjanua, and T\u00fatibhari. The fourth class stations or outposts, whose quota consists of but one head and three foot constables, are at Kaur\u00ed-r\u00e1m, Mot\u00edr\u00e1m-ka-udda, Fakir-ki-kothi, Gagaha, Belip\u00e1r, and Chaumukha. From the th\u00e1nas or stations of higher classes these fourth class stations are distinguished by the name of chauki. All police stations, of whatever class, are manned by the regular police enrolled under Act V. of 1861. They are assisted by municipal and town police under Acts XV. of 1873 and XX. of 1856 respectively. In 1877, the three forces together mustered 774 men of all grades, including 12 mounted constables. There was thus one policeman to every 5\u00b792 square miles and 2,608 inhabitants. The cost of the force was Rs. 96,378, and of this Rs. 87,986 were debited to provincial revenues, the remainder being\n\n\u00b9 See Mr. E. A. Reade's note on the revision of the Gorakhpur police.\ndefrayed out of municipal and other funds.

These were in 1877 distributed amongst the 7,110 inhabited villages of the district at the rate of one to every 829 inhabitants, and at a sanctioned cost of Rs. 83,388, met out of the 10 per cent. cess.\n\nConvicts imprisoned through the agency of the police just described are sent to the Central Prison at Benares or the District Jail at Gorakhpur itself. The latter contained in 1850 an average population of 1,351 inmates; of 696 in 1860; and in 1870 of 509. The number of prisoners admitted was 2,248 in 1860 and 1,891 in 1870. The principal statistics for 1877 may be thus tabulated:\n\n| Total number of prisoners during the year | Hind\u00fas | Musalmans |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n|                                          | Males  | Females   | Males  | Females |\n|                                          | Average daily number of prisoners | Admitted during the year | Discharged during the year | Admitted to hospital during the year | Deaths | Total yearly cost per head of average strength | Net yearly cost per head of average strength after deducting profits |\n|                                          |        |           |        |         |        |        | Rs. 37 | Rs. 33 |\n\nThere was till comparatively recent times a watchman for every village, paid by an assignment of lands or contributions at harvest.\nOf the total number of prisoners, 110, principally debtors, had been imprisoned by order of the civil courts. The total population of the district being 2,019,361 persons, and the average daily number of prisoners as above, it will be seen that '0301 per cent. of the inhabitants are as a rule in jail. A comparison of the number of admissions with the total number of prisoners during the year will show that 640 of the latter had remained in jail since former years. The mortality was more than thrice as high as in any other district jail of these provinces; but 22 of the deaths were due to an outbreak of cholera. The excessive casualties can hardly be assigned to the age or extreme youth of the jail inmates, as 42 of the persons who died were between 16 and 40 years old. Of the jail population, generally, 29 are returned as juvenile offenders, or persons under 16 years of age; 1,868 as between 16 and 40; 415 as between 40 and 60; and 27 as above the latter age; but the age of the few remaining persons is not stated. The greater part of the average yearly expenditure on each prisoner consisted in the cost of his rations (Rs. 15-1-2\u00bd). The remainder was made up of his shares in the expenditure on establishment (Rs. 11-11-9\u00bd), clothing (2-13-11\u00bc), police guards (Rs. 2-10-9\u00bc), building and repairs (Rs. 1-6-5\u00bd), hospital charges (Re. 1-0-4\u00bc), and contingencies (Rs. 2-3-5). The average number of effective workers throughout the year was 493\u00b725; and of these most were employed on building or repairs connected with the jail (255\u00b725) as prison servants (194\u00b750), or on manufactures (103\u00b750). The previous occupation of the prisoners was in few cases such as to fit them for profitable work in prison, the majority having been agriculturists (1,298), men of independent property or no occupation, and Government and domestic servants. Of non-agriculturists, a term which is presumed to include shop-keepers and handicraftsmen, there were only 225.\n\nThe lock-up (havaldt) for under-trial prisoners is at Gorakhpur a division of the jail. It had during the same year (1877) 2,376 different occupants, of whom 1,911 were afterwards transferred as convicts to the jail proper, and the average daily number of its inmates was 84.\n\nThe fiscal history of the district begins with its cession to the East India Company in November, 1801.\u00b9 The wretched condition to which misgovernment had brought the country is vividly portrayed by its first Collector, Mr. Routledge. \"Although the soil of the Gorakhpur district,\" he writes in 1802, \"is proverbial for its fertility, and will certainly yield abundant crops (when properly cultivated) of the most valuable\n\n\u00b9 This sketch is based chiefly on Mr. Bidsale's notes.\nkinds, nothing but the common necessaries of life are now grown, and these scantily. The *jama* (revenue) will fall below the estimate, and this is purely owing to the exactions of the *amil* (Oudh governor) and his subordinates.\" Mr. Routledge discovered also that the Oudh Naw\u00e1b's troops had received no pay for a year, and he had great trouble in making them evacuate the district. They were, he says, a mere rabble, useless in war, but grievous as a burden on the unfortunate cultivators whom they were accustomed \"to squeeze for the *amil* and plunder for themselves.\"\n\nThe *amil* who, during the first year of our rule, was still employed in Khairagarh, was now brought to account. Being found to have embezzled about a lakh of rupees, he was dismissed, and a European officer appointed to Khairagarh, which thereon was severed from the district.\u00b9\n\nThe *amil* having been dismissed, Mr. Routledge proceeded to make arrangements for the collection of the revenue through tahsild\u00e1rs. Early administration. These were at first paid a fixed salary, to which a percentage of the collections was added if they managed to realize a fair proportion of their balances. The first year was spent in ascertaining the condition of the district and its inhabitants, and in acquiring the information necessary to any plan of administering its vast area. The collector was at this time subordinate to the Board of Commissioners for the ceded provinces at Farukhabad, and it was to them, therefore, that he reported his proposed arrangements.\n\nThe collections of the first year (1801-02) necessarily showed a large balance; and it was determined to make a triennial settlement \"at fair rates,\" with specially favourable terms for the cultivation of waste lands. This, the first assessment of Gorakhpur under British rule, marks the substitution of settlement with the landholders themselves for the ruinous farming system of the later Naw\u00e1bs. The change has perhaps contributed more largely than any other measure to the immense advance in prosperity which the district has made under English government.\n\nIncluding various cesses (Rs. 8,940), the revenue of Gorakhpur-Basti and B\u00fatwal had amounted at the date of cession to Rs. 6,27,570. But from this was to be deducted Rs. 77,715 of more or less permanent remissions (*n\u00e1nk\u00e1r* and *roz\u00edna*); and the net demand had therefore been Rs. 5,49,855 only. When, however, the first settlement was made, it was found that, owing to decreased cultivation and other causes, so large an assessment would, for the present at least, be futile. The demand was therefore fixed at Rs. 5,44,555, or, deducting remissions (Rs. 66,173), at Rs. 4,78,382, of which Rs. 27,482 fell on\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 275.\nB\u00fatwal. The new demand came into force with 1803-04. It had been estimated to increase during its third year (1805-06) by Rs. 1,70,000, but the collections fell far short of expectation.\n\nBut before the settlement came into force, other administrative measures had not been neglected. Security of life and property were as necessary for the collection of the revenue as intrinsically; and to restore order a large body of Company's troops was imported into Gorakhpur. Attempts were made to establish police jurisdictions; and advances were at the same time granted to landholders to enable them to plough and sow their lands (1802-03). But, as might have expected, the recipients squandered these sums in increasing the number of their dependents and other private expenses, and the efforts of the tahsild\u00e1rs to organize a police were strongly opposed by the R\u00e1jas and other powerful proprietors.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal was especially contumacious. His refusal to permit the establishment of police posts within his domains was very near bringing him into open collision with the Company's troops. It was reported in 1804 that he declined to pay a balance of about Rs. 12,000 due from him on account of the past two years. Inquiries showed that he had for many years under the Oudh r\u00e9gime succeeded in evading payment of the revenue due on his lands north of Tilpur. In 1805 he was imprisoned; but as Nep\u00e1lese troops at this juncture invaded his domains, it was found impossible to recover the balance. The timidity of the peasantry was found as great an obstacle to progress as the boldness of their landlords. Half a century of extortion and broken pledges rendered them suspicious of invitations to settle. It had indeed been a common trick for the \u00e1mil or his subordinates, after entering into solemn engagements that the cultivators should hold at low fixed rates, to seize on the ripened crop and extort double or treble the sum before agreed on.\n\nIt is not, therefore, surprising that these first advances of money proved a failure, and that great difficulty was found in recovering even a part of them.\n\nFrom 1802 to 1805 the Collector was occupied in enforcing the authority of the British Government and collecting the revenues of the triennial settlement. It was found absolutely necessary to have recourse to farming leases in many cases where the zam\u00edndars were either unwilling to accept or unable to satisfy the Government terms; and this led in some instances to armed resistance, which was met by sharp punish-\n\n1 In his note on the current settlement Mr. Auckland Colvin gives a far larger sum, viz., Rs. 6,81,293.\nment. Thus in 1803 one Damara Singh refused to acknowledge the British authority or to pay revenue. An armed force was sent against him, drove him into his fort, stormed it and razed it to the ground; after which his estates were farmed. Again, in 1805, the collector reports that the last of the forts held by contumacious zam\u012bndars had been levelled, and that a sharp watch was being kept to prevent their being rebuilt. In 1805 an attempt was made to raise the position of the tahs\u012bld\u0101rs, and at the same time to provide an efficient police, by making these officers an allowance of 11\u00bd per cent. on their collections and holding them responsible for \"an efficient police administration\" within their jurisdictions.\n\nA second triennial settlement in 1806 granted a slight reduction on the actual, and a great reduction on the nominal, demand of 1806-07 to 1809-10 inclusive. The assessment of the district, including Basti, was fixed at Rs. 5,96,288, excluding remissions. The transit dues hitherto taken were lowered, and a tax on professions was abolished. Some effort was made to ascertain the capabilities of the different mah\u0101ls (estates) by examination of the papers kept by the village accountants. The reduction seems to have been urgently needed, for, in some places, the zam\u012bndars were beginning to quit their villages for the forest, with threats to eject by force any one who should presume to till their lands during their absence.\n\nIn spite of all that had been done, sales of land for arrears of revenue continued frequent. The impossibility of efficient supervision and control left the native officials almost completely to their own devices; and native officials were in that day \"indifferent honest.\" How was a single European officer, fresh to the district, and destitute of all those aids now available in the shape of maps, records, and well-informed subordinates, to form even an approximate idea of the effect of the assessments he proposed? How could he scrutinize the action of tahs\u012bldars working in parts of the country which he had never seen, even on paper? It seems almost incredible, but it is true, that the collector was obliged to report his inability to describe the relative positions and extent of the parganas composing his charge. The enormous area and unsettled state of the district gave its chief officer no time to inspect details; and though, as before remarked, the principle of settlement at fair rates with landholders themselves had at once been recognised, years elapsed before it could be more than nominally carried out.\n\n1 Rs. 6,71,070 according to Mr. Colvin. 2 See Mr. Ridsdale's notes on 1805-06.\nThe peculiar position of the R\u00e1jas in Gorakhpur-Basti was now of great service. To make settlements with them, and even attain a rough fairness in the process, was comparatively easy; while their position and influence served to check the tahsild\u00e1rs and underlings of Government, no longer supported in their exactions by a military force.\n\nThe tahsild\u00e1rs nevertheless managed to abuse their power pretty freely; and the police became, under their management, almost as oppressive as the rabble of the \u00e1mils. In 1808, therefore, when the Board of Commissioners made on the spot a protracted enquiry into the administration of the district, it was determined to abolish these officials and attempt a system under which the revenue should be lodged directly with the collector. Needless to say that this scheme at once proved a failure, and tahsild\u00e1rs were reappointed in 1810, the police administration being, however, taken from them.\n\nThe machinery for the collection, as for the assessment, of the revenue was still very imperfect. The size of the district and the amount of thick jungle into which defaulters could always retire, the want of system and of adequate information, all rendered it extremely difficult to introduce any well-digested scheme. As the only means of checking arrears, sale of the lands on which they occurred was resorted to, and carried out to an extent which soon caused fresh troubles.\n\nIn 1812 the Board passed orders to reject sale in all cases where it could be avoided, as the frequency of the process had given occasion to serious disturbances, and in more than one case to successful resistance of authority. In 1810-11, it seemed indeed as if the general dissatisfaction caused by these sales and by the misconduct of the native officials might excite violence requiring fresh military repression. But the new settlement of 1810 and the Board\u2019s orders in some measure soothed the prevailing discontent. The R\u00e1jas were pacified by obtaining a mild settlement made directly with themselves and not with their dependents.\n\nThe other zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs could make no formidable resistance without their aid, and so the danger passed off without very serious consequences. The effect, however, of the excessive sales was for many years afterwards felt in the reluctance of zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs to settle on the wast\u00e9 lands still so extensive in the district, and more especially in the north.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 Amongst other estates the greater part of the Padrauna tal\u00f3ka was sold; the price obtained (Rs 8,000) was, however, so manifestly insufficient that the sale was annulled.\nComing into force with 1810-11, this third settlement seems to have been sanctioned for two years only. It was ultimately extended, however, for three years longer, expiring with 1814-15. In laying before the Board his proposals for assessment the Collector (1809) had to urge the inadvisability of making it permanent. His opinion was on this point accepted; but when he proposed to settle with the birtias and other sub-proprietors in possession, he was taken to task for sporting with, and offering violence to, the rights of the R\u00e1jas and tal\u00fakad\u00e1rs. The demand of the first year was fixed for the Gorakhpur-Basti district at Rs. 6,21,220, excluding n\u00e1nk\u00e1r remissions (Rs. 80,000). The excise revenue was at the same time farmed for an average of Rs. 83,000 per annum. This settlement was financially a success; for, notwithstanding the increase of sales for arrears, irrecoverable balances were small till 1814. In the latter year the Nep\u00e1lese war of course diverted attention from their recovery.\n\nThe operations of that war will be described elsewhere. Suffice it here to say that the unfortunate R\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal was again the cause of the disturbance. The amount of damage inflicted by the campaign was very great, and security of life and property was throughout the district rudely shaken. Large numbers of people were reduced to a state of destitution, and the zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs were not yet sufficiently tamed to resist the opportunities offered of indulging their animosities and reviving their ancient feuds. Gang-robberies became frequent and singularly bold. In 1813 over ten thousand rupees of Government treasure had been carried off by robbers while on its way to Azamgarh; but in 1814 an attack was actually made on the B\u00e1nsi tahs\u00edli and was with great difficulty repelled. The assailants numbered over two hundred, and were armed with spears, bows and arrows; and it was not before two barkand\u00e1zs had been killed and several wounded that they were repulsed. In the same year also, near Magbar, twenty thousand rupees were carried off from Government treasure-carts after a pitched battle in which three barkand\u00e1zs were killed and seventeen wounded. Several other unsuccessful attacks were also made on treasure parties during this and the two following years.\n\nPrivate property was, of course, exposed to still greater risk. But there was at present little private wealth to tempt the robbers. The Collector reported that there was no one able to contribute towards a Government loan, and that in his opinion there was no one whose bill for a thousand rupees would be accepted in a great trading city like Calcutta or Patna. The greater part of the injury done to private property\n\n---\n\n1 Or according to Mr. Colvin, who clearly includes these n\u00e1nk\u00e1r remissions, Rs. 7,18,027.\nwas the work of the Nepalese or of hostile zamindars; but added to the unsettling effects of war, it produced great recusancy in the matter of revenue payments. Thanks, however, to the energy of the collector and his subordinates, who all (including the collector himself) received rewards for their services, the balances were not exorbitant. The demand of the tract which chiefly suffered was indeed so light that its non-collection affected the total returns but little.\n\nThe war ended in 1816, and the frontier of the British territories was fixed at the end of the year. A considerable part of the B\u00fatwal territory was ceded to Nep\u00e1l, partly in order to secure a convenient and even boundary line, and partly to show our desire to treat the defeated Gurkh\u00e1s generously. With the latter object were also made large money allowances. With the former, a large tract west of the R\u00e1pti and other territorial concessions were exacted from Nep\u00e1l.\n\nBy the line thus laid down parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur was cut in two, and more than half of it, with part of Tilpur, made over to Nep\u00e1l. At the same time the loan of ten million rupees was repaid to the Naw\u00e1b Vazir by the cession of Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh. Chakla Naw\u00e1bganj, which had hitherto formed part of Gorakhpur, was at the same time ceded to that potentate in exchange for some territory added to the Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur district.\n\nThese changes effected, the authorities were at leisure to direct their attention exclusively to the administration of the district. A fresh or fourth settlement had opened with 1815-16, but was not formally sanctioned until after the close of the war. Its demand amounted to Rs. 6,86,175, excluding remissions (about Rs. 90,000) and excise. It continued in force for five years ending with 1819-20. Under its operation balances were small and sales for arrears less numerous. To encourage zamindars and to counteract a failure of the autumn harvest in 1817, the Board authorised large advances. Many Th\u00e1r\u00fas who had immigrated from the north were settled on grants in the outskirts of the north Haveli jungle, chiefly in tappas Lehra and Samakhor.\n\nA final proclamation had been issued at the commencement of the war, calling on the Th\u00e1r\u00fas and other subjects of the British Government residing north of Nichlaval to migrate southwards. The object of this measure was twofold. It was hoped, by stopping the cultivation of the Tar\u00e1i, to inflict loss\n\n1 See Smith's Five Years of Nep\u00e1l.\non the Nep\u00e1l Government; and at the same time to prevent British subjects from falling into the hands of the Gurkha troops. When the Gurkha raids began in earnest, so many persons obeyed these orders that 55 villages were colonised on lands still known as the Jungle Buridi grants. Those settlements have continued to prosper ever since, and now include over a hundred villages. Their immediate effect was also most beneficial. Not only did the settlers themselves bring a large area under cultivation, but their example encouraged others to settle on the land to the north and east.\n\nTrustworthy information had at last been acquired regarding the capabilities and condition of the district. In 1818 the collector compiled a series of statements showing the progress of cultivation, the condition of the cultivators, the nature of the allowances made to the various pensioners and dignitaries, and the incidence of the Government demand. These statements have unfortunately been lost; but the correspondence regarding them shows that the district had to some extent recovered prosperity in the south, while still backward in the north and east. These two portions of the district are frequently contrasted.\n\nThe south is mentioned as well cultivated, in some places with sugarcane and other valuable crops. It was blessed with some fair roads, fair health, and, except in rare instances, with immunity from breaches of the peace. It was also almost free from mischievous wild animals, which are mentioned as one of the chief obstacles to cultivation in the north.\n\nThe latter portion was almost entirely uncultivated, for the settlements of Th\u00e1r\u00fas had only just begun. It was, moreover, extremely unhealthy, covered to a great extent by morasses and forests, and devastated by wild elephants.\n\nThe condition of the cultivators throughout seems to have been very low. They had no rights of occupancy, and were almost all of the lowest castes. They were despised by the landowners, and treated with no more consideration than was absolutely necessary to prevent their running away. This, indeed, they were constantly doing, as the vast area still open to cultivation rendered it easy to find fresh holdings if life became unsupportable on those they at present occupied.\n\nThe revenue of the district (Gorakhpur and Basti) had now risen to about six and a half lakhs, and was collected with ease and punctuality. A fifth settlement was about to be made, and it was proposed to make this permanent. Operations began\nin 1820-21; but before they were completed Mr. Holt Mackenzie's Regulation VII. of 1822 made its timely appearance. Under this enactment were instituted a professional survey and a thorough inquiry into the condition of the various parganahs. For each were furnished statements showing the amount of cultivation and other details. The principle of assessment on the capabilities of the soil, on the cultivated and culturable areas, was recognized. Before this, assessment had been made on a rough guess of the rental, furnished for separate villages by the kan\u00fangos, and for the tal\u00fakas by the tal\u00fakad\u00e1rs themselves.\n\nThe result of these enquiries was to show clearly how little the district was ripe for a permanent settlement. The surveyors, Lieutenants Grant and Wroughton, were strong in their demonstration of this view. They pointed out that the population was scanty, the modes of cultivation imperfect, the peasantry depressed, the requisite capital wanting, and the landholders so ignorant and obstinate as to be utterly incapable of developing the resources of the country.\n\nPermanent settlement rejected. The scheme was abandoned, most happily as results have shown; but the enquiries made proved of the greatest importance. For the first time something more than a superficial enquiry was made into the position of the subordinate landholders; and the nature of their tenures and the errors and defects of the old system of settlements on information provided by the kan\u00fangos and village accountants were exposed. The papers kept by these officials were examined, and to some extent at least set right. Inquiries were instituted into claims made for the recovery of proprietary (zam\u00ednd\u00e1ri) rights, and illegal appropriations of waste land were cancelled. Property acquired a tangible and enhanced value. And lastly, the acquisition of systematic information enabled European officers to assume more directly the management of the district, while the power and authority of their subordinates was limited and carefully supervised. It is not saying too much to affirm that this settlement gave a new and powerful stimulus to the progress of the district.\n\nSoils were classified into b\u00e1ngar or uplands, bith (mattiy\u00e1r) and dh\u00fati (balua), rental rates being fixed for each. In the determination of tenures, a bounty was paid to the Collector for every revenue-free holding which he discovered as liable to assessment. This inquiry brought to light a wholesale system of fraud, many entire villages having been entered as tax-free which had paid land-tax up to the date of cession. Such false entries brought to punishment many village accountants and other Government officials.\n\n1 Or, to translate into less accurate and technical language, for separate villages by the parganah registrar, and for the baronies by the barons themselves.\nment was still made with the R\u00e1jas and other tal\u00fakad\u00e1rs, but the Collector in many cases curtailed their power of enhancing the amount payable by their birtia sub-proprietors. It was ruled that such enhancements must not exceed in proportion the enhancement made in their own revenue since last settlement. The chief control of the district had in 1819 been transferred to the Board of Commissioners for Bih\u00e1r and Benares, or, as it was afterwards styled, the \"Board of Revenue for the Central Provinces.\" This new authority directed that the chief object in assessment should be to ascertain the average produce of the soil, and the share in that produce usually paid to the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r. The amount and value of the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r's yearly assets being thus discovered, Government would leave him 10 per cent. for profits; another 10 per cent. to cover calamities of season, insolvency of tenants, &c., and 5 per cent. for his trouble and expense in collecting the rents. In other words, the demand was to be fixed at 75 per cent. of the proprietor's average receipts.\n\nThus assessed, the revenue for Gorakhpur-Basti amounted to Rs. 7,59,041, excluding the income from excise and ferries, which are now mentioned for the first time. The settlement was completed in 1824 and finally sanctioned in 1825. It lasted, in different parganshs, from ten to fourteen years, but meanwhile revisions and other causes had greatly increased its amount. The settlement in 1826 of parganah Amorha added Rs. 14,000 and raised the demand of that year to Rs. 7,63,000. In this case the Board set aside the claim of the R\u00e1ja, and ordered a direct settlement with the subordinate landholders. A revision in 1828 of the assessment on the Sat\u00e1si estate increased the district revenue by Rs. 7,000, while a similar measure in Ratanpur-B\u00e1nsi added during the following year Rs. 16,000. The assessment of parganah Sh\u00e1hj\u00e9h\u00e1npur had, owing to want of time, remained unaltered at settlement. It in 1830 came under revision, yielding an increment of Rs. 26,600. Without, therefore, allowing for the increase caused by progressive demands and assessment of waste land, the demand of the fifth settlement had by 1830 risen to Rs. 8,12,600. Including all items, it can hardly have amounted to less than Rs. 9,00,000.\n\nThe currency of the fifth settlement perhaps marks the transition from the misrule of violence to the reign of law. Disputes, which had been formerly settled by riot or by the coercion of some bribed native official, now found their way into the courts. A special commission in 1826 recommended that tahsil-d\u00e1rs should be invested with judicial powers to try such disputes. A long inquiry on the subject of sales for arrears recalled attention to a Board's order which had in 1812 forbidden such sales,\n\n1 Their proceeds being Rs. 16,910. 2 In Basti.\nunless after due investigation into the circumstances. This order had for a time checked the evil, but on the *inter arma silent leges* principle was forgotten during the Nepalese war. Between 1815 and 1821, therefore, sales went on briskly, and the enquiries now made in the fuller light of the settlement statistics revealed strange facts. The utter ignorance of the country, of the position of the lower proprietors, and of the interests of all subordinate many cases. to the superior landholders, is shown by the fact that in the sales at first made all rights of every kind were declared cancelled, and the estate sold was surrendered to the absolute pleasure of the purchaser. Clear proof was obtained that most sales had been manoeuvred by overtrusted native officials, intent on buying at a bargain the auctioned land. These abuses had caused much discontent, and the auction-purchaser had in some cases been ejected *vi et armis*. They now ceased, and the effects of their suppression were soon visible. The revenue, which had been enhanced about one lakh and a quarter, was collected with ease, and even punctuality. The zamindars were more contented than they had ever been before, and were induced by the longer term of settlement to extend their cultivation. Gang-robberies, though still not unfrequent, had become less daring. Riots, arson, and similar offences arising from local feuds regarding boundaries or waste lands, grew rarer. And the police began to exercise their proper function of guarding private property instead of merely acting as armed guards to escort Government treasure. Communications were improved, and the export trade in grain, which is now of so much importance, began to attract capital and to extend itself rapidly.\n\nThere were of course many checks and hitches in the course of this improvement. In 1821 the Collector wrote despairingly to the Board about his inability to obtain trustworthy information. \"The records, he says,\" are deplorably deficient; many important documents have been extracted and others falsified or mutilated.\" On another occasion, speaking of the k\u00e1n\u00fangos, he says \"they are utterly unworthy of confidence; they are possessed of valuable information, but retain it for their own purposes.\" The system of collecting the revenue was still so unscientific that as a rule quarterly and, in some cases, monthly instalments were realised, without regard to time of harvest.\n\nIn 1827-28 further information was collected. Invalid grants of tax-free land were resumed, and further inquiries as to the zamindar's right in waste plots were directed. The settlements of some\nvillages were, on the other hand, lightened, as it was shown that their value had through spite been exaggerated.\n\nIn 1829 Mr. R. M. Bird was appointed Commissioner of Gorakhpur, Gh\u00e1z\u00edzipur, and Azamgarh, with headquarters at the capital of the first-named district. At the same time the Board of Revenue (Central Provinces) was abolished and the Commissioner made subordinate to the Sadr (Supreme) Board of Revenue.\n\nIn 1830 the first jungle grant was made to a European (Mr. Wilkinson). Up to this time, by a short-sighted policy, Government had prohibited Europeans from settling in the country, and had ordered the collector on no account to allow such dangerous \"interlopers\" to establish themselves on Government lands. This prohibition was a relic of the time when the Company feared infringement of its trade monopoly, but had become an anachronism as commerce was discarded for empire. The stimulus which the grantees gave to the progress of the district is one of the most remarkable features in its history from this date up to the Mutiny. They contributed to the improvement of the country not only capital and energy, but personal influence. The protection afforded to the weak by their presence was of great importance in a day when courts were few, and when large questions left the district staff little time to inquire into petty acts of tyranny.\n\nIn 1833-34 the terms of the current assessments began to expire, and in the proposals for a sixth settlement under Regulation IX. of 1833 the rights of tenants are for the first time considered. The scheme advised by Mr. Bird, and with slight exceptions adopted, was to ascertain the class and value of the crops grown; to discover the fair rental of the villages, much as is done now, by fixing soil rates; and to divide the rental, in the proportion of two to three, between Government and the zam\u00edndars. Tenants were to be granted leases for their holdings at a fixed rent not liable to enhancement during the term of settlement. The chief difference between this and former settlements was the negotiation of assessment with the sub-proprietors to the exclusion of the tal\u00fakd\u00e1rs, and the concession to the latter in most cases of nothing more than a seigniorial allowance (mdl\u00edk\u00e1na). The claims raised by some of the R\u00e1jas to the ownership of forests in which Government was now making large grants were rejected. It was only conceded that no portion specially settled with them should be granted away, except for special reasons.\nIts accurate and exhaustive enquiries protracted the arrangement of this settlement; but when at last sanctioned in 1841-42, it was sanctioned for twenty years. How great had been the material progress since last settlement is shown by the vast increase in the demand; without proving oppressive, it was fixed at Rs. 17,63,000 in 1840, rising through progressive increments and other causes to Rs. 20,82,000 in 1860.\n\nOne result of settlement was to expose in the north of the district much the same abuses as had elsewhere come to light at the preceding assessment. The collector notices in 1838 the extent to which citizens of Gorakhpur had acquired, by intrigues with tahsil officials, snug domains in this remote tract.\n\nThe revision of police before referred to suppressed at about the same time the custom of deciding boundary quarrels by force; and to develop the rising commerce of the district Government organized a road fund, committees of landholders being appointed in the different parganahs to suggest and supervise improvements.\n\nThe new settlement worked extremely well. The only opposition against it came from the R\u00e1jas, who resented the system of an assessment with their inferiors and dependents, as they considered the zam\u00edndars in actual possession of the villages. In reporting the proposed arrangements for sanction, the Commissioner observes that \"the R\u00e1jas and other tal\u00fakad\u00e1rs must suffer from a village settlement. They are the very creatures of anarchy, and their revenues have in fact consisted of the large share of the Government's rights they continued to withhold.\" This language was much too strong, as the rights of the R\u00e1jas were far older than those which the Naw\u00e1b transferred to the Company. But it was impossible that their power and influence should be maintained under a strong Supreme Government such as now held the country. They were constrained to live at peace with each other, and having no longer any sovereign power, turned for excitement and pleasure to a lavish expenditure on sensual pleasures. This soon brought them into debt, and in some cases to ruin.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja of Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r was one of the first to mortgage his property.\u00b9 The R\u00e1ja of Gop\u00e1lpur plunged deeply into debt.\u00b2 The Sat\u00e1s\u00ed and Majhauli estates were both so mismanaged that at the outbreak of the Mutiny they were on the\n\n\u00b9 Arrears of revenue had some time before this caused the transfer of a part of his estates to the Pind\u00e1ri chiefs settled in the district. \u00b2 While reporting in 1836-77 the settlement of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, Mr. Reads writes that it is \"equitable, but must hasten the inevitable ruin of the R\u00e1ja of Gop\u00e1lpur, who is deeply sunk in debt.\"\nverge of ruin. The Padrauna family were not much better off.\u00b9 The only local magnate who seems to have improved his position was the R\u00e1ja of Tamkt\u00edhi. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bettiah also extended his influence in the district, but his residence and the bulk of his estates were then as now outside it.\n\nFrom 1840 to 1850 the improvement of the district was steadily carried on. Treasuries were built for the safety of the Government money on its passage,\u00b2 and the roads were put in order. Tahs\u00eds were erected and courts established in the interior of the district for the convenience of suitors. The clearance of forest and increase of cultivation perhaps improved the climate, and the state of the district generally was very encouraging when thrown back by the Mutiny (1857). This, as will be hereafter shown, effected considerable changes in the proprietary body. The estates of the Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r, and Barhi\u00e9p\u00e1r R\u00e1jas were confiscated, the titles of the two former becoming extinct. A part also of the Padrauna tal\u00faka was confiscated, and the stipend paid since 1845 to the last descendant of the B\u00fatwal R\u00e1ja, in compensation for his tal\u00fakad\u00e1ri rights in Tilpur, was abolished.\n\nPreparations for the seventh or current settlement had begun before the Mutiny and were resumed in 1859.\n\nThe chief peculiarity of this assessment was the heterogeneous nature of the agency and methods employed. As in Meerut and Budaun, the collector was also the settlement officer. But, including as it then did Basti, his district was the largest in these provinces. His numerous and varied labours left him, as might have been expected, no time to supervise and control the work of his settlement subordinates. Except in the case of parganah Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, his assistants were left to their own devices, assessing their parganahs in separate fashions, and submitting separate final reports on their proceedings. The parganah just named was settled between the winters of 1856-57 and 1861-62 by the collector himself, the late Mr. T. M. Bird, C.S.; parganahs Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r, Bhau\u00e1-p\u00e1r, Dhuri\u00e9p\u00e1r, Anola, Sidhua Jobna, and south Haveli, between those of 1859-60 and 1866-67 by Mr. J. J. F. Lumsden, C.S., afterwards collector; parganahs Tilpur and north Haveli\u00b3 in the winter of 1861-62 by Mr. P. J. White; Salempur-Majhauli and Silhat between the winters of 1859-60 and 1862-63 by the late B\u00e1bu Pi\u00e1ri Mohan Bandhop\u00e1dhyay; parganah Maghar between those of 1860-61 and 1861-62 by the late Mr. Herbert Wilson, C.S.; and parganah\n\n\u00b9 In 1211 fa\u1e63l\u012b, i.e. about 1805 A.D., their tal\u00faka was sold for arrears; but an insufficient price being offered, the sale was annulled, and one-half was placed under direct management, the rest being restored to the family. In 1237 fa\u1e63l\u012b the whole was restored to them.\n\u00b2 In 1837, for instance, at Khaliabad and Bakhra in Basti; and afterwards at Captaioganj, Paikoli, and Pipr\u00e1ch in Gorakhpur.\n\u00b3 South Haveli included the Haz\u00far tahs\u00edl and H\u00e1ta portions of Haveli; north Haveli its remaining or Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj portion.\nBinayakpur between those of 1861-62 and 1863-64 by the late Mr. H. LeP. Wynne, C.S.\n\nThe operations of the settlement may be described as usual under the three heads of measurements, rent-rates, and assessments.\n\nMeasurements. The measuring agency varied little in the different parganas. In four the patw\u0101ris or village accountants alone were employed; but in the remainder the ignorance or inexperience of these officials rendered the entertainment of am\u012bns or skilled surveyors necessary. Five parganas, indeed, were measured by the am\u012bns without the aid of the patw\u0101ris. The system of supervision employed by each of the six officers engaged in settlement was much the same. Sarghanas or head am\u012bns were appointed over parties of from 25 to 30 other am\u012bns or patw\u0101ris; and the work of these sarghanas was in turn checked as far as possible by the assessing officer himself. \"On the whole,\" wrote Government in reviewing the settlement, \"although the measurements were not made with the same close accuracy of figure and survey as those of the succeeding settlements, it may be safely assumed that the field maps are sufficient for all ordinary administrative purposes, and the areas quite exact enough to form a trustworthy basis for assessment.\" The classification of area was as follows:\n\n| Parganah          | Unassessable | Assessable |\n|-------------------|--------------|------------|\n|                   | Revenue-free | Barren     | Cultivable | Old fallow | Water | Unwater | Total cultivated | Total |\n| Salempur Majhauli | 5,612        | 70,782     | 28,589     | 12,143     | 222,151 | 35,191   | 257,272           | 374,898 |\n| Silhat            | 1,454        | 51,800     | 42,342     | 4,020      | 88,734   | 10,949   | 99,673            | 179,089 |\n| Sidhna Jobna      | 6,984        | 50,120     | 92,768     | 35,278     | 121,892  | 226,076  | 347,963           | 533,063 |\n| Shahjah\u0101npur      | 1,084        | 11,015     | 10,611     | 4,502      | 23,917   | 87,318   | 61,220            | 88,433  |\n| South Haveli      | 23,323       | 48,484     | 66,730     | 16,233     | 161,471  | 64,502   | 225,973           | 380,748 |\n| North Haveli      | 1,637        | 28,504     | 43,543     | 16,264     | 57,750   | 100,420  | 158,200           | 248,148 |\n| Binayakpur        | 300          | 1,947      | 11,208     | 2,281      | 3,365    | 11,958   | 15,318            | 31,051  |\n| Tilpur            | 1,299        | 9,021      | 32,785     | 13,698     | 11,565   | 47,610   | 59,175            | 115,881 |\n| Dhoriapar         | 4,310        | 55,697     | 20,165     | 7,332      | 93,656   | 22,161   | 115,718           | 203,992 |\n| Anola             | 1,542        | 14,871     | 7,769      | 2,845      | 39,370   | 5,906    | 45,276            | 71,803  |\n| Chilliapar        | 573          | 17,246     | 8,831      | 4,989      | 13,009   | 91,802   | 34,513            | 66,149  |\n| Bhanapar          | 4,951        | 20,086     | 9,159      | 3,892      | 33,604   | 19,635   | 53,239            | 90,867  |\n| Maghar            | 2,922        | 34,414     | 24,830     | 10,199     | 77,841   | 32,228   | 109,564           | 181,919 |\n\n1 The parganas measured solely by am\u012bns were Chilliapar, Bhanapar, Dhuriapar, Anola, and South Haveli; those measured solely by patw\u0101ris, Sidhna Jobna, Tilpur, North Haveli, and Binayakpur.\n\n2 The figures in the line for this pargana are approximate only. Maghar has been halved between Gorakhpur and Basti, and but half the figures given in the Board's review of settlement have been taken.\nThe next step was to assume standard rent-rates for the various soils or tracts of each parganah, and, by applying these rates to the areas, to ascertain the probable gross rental of each. In their manner of assuming such rates the assessing officers showed great divergence. Mr. Bird gives no clue to the method he adopted; and it is even doubtful whether, in ascertaining the rental, he went through the formality of assuming rent-rates at all. If he did so, however, he would seem to have fixed three general rates only, for clayey, loamy, and sandy soils respectively. Mr. Lumsden\u2019s method \u201cvaried as his experience increased.\u201d\u00b9 In Chilupar and Anola he adopted soil-rates, arranging his soils according to their composition into two classes, and using the same rates indifferently for both watered and unwatered land.\u00b2 His rates were based on those actually paid, as ascertained from personal enquiry on the spot, from the village records, and from the opinion of parganah officers. In Sidhua Jobna and South Haveli, following the custom of those parganahs, he assumed an average rate, not for each soil or village, but for each tappa as a whole. Mr. White sometimes adopted separate rates for different soils, and sometimes an all-round rate for an entire tract. But how such rates were framed, or on what induction of ascertained facts, is nowhere recorded. The rates of Babu Piari Mohan were based on the same data as those of Mr. Lumsden, and fixed for the three classes of clayey, loamy, and sandy soils. Mr. Wilson avowedly used no rent-rates, but depended chiefly on the results of inquiry into the actual rental returns of each village. Like Mr. Lumsden in Sidhua Jobna and south Haveli, Mr. Wynne framed average rates for each tappa, making no distinction between dry and irrigated lands. His rates were based on those returned by native officials as actually paid; and he checked them by comparison with the average rates per acre paid for various crops.\u00b3 There was one point in the methods of all these officers which struck the Board of Revenue as curious. Almost all explained that the rent of land was influenced mainly by its position with regard to the village-site: by its situation, that is, in the inner (goind), middle (miyana), or outer (pallu)\u2074 zones. But no single officer seemed to have adopted as the basis of his calculations this well-recognized arrangement. The rates adopted for the different soils or tappas of the parganahs assessed by each officer will be shown in the gazetteer articles on those parganahs themselves. Meanwhile it may be\n\n\u00b9 G. O. No. 2366A., dated 26th October, 1873. \u00b2 It should be remembered that in a district where the spring-level is so high as in Gorakhpur, the difference in productive power and rent between watered and unwatered land is less than elsewhere. Mr. Lumsden\u2019s two classes were (1) loam or loam and clay; (2) sand. \u00b3 The exact method of check is rather obscurely stated. \u2074 These words are derived respectively from Hindi gwaind, near, Persian miyan, middle; and Hindi pallu, margin, distance. They correspond to the gauhan or bara, manjha or majhaula, and barha or burhet of the Doab.\nmentioned that the average rate for the whole district, including Basti, was Rs. 2-3-2 per acre.\n\nThe application of the rent-rates to the total area, or, where rent-rates were discarded, other processes, gave for the whole Gorakhpur district an assumed rental of about Rs. 29,96,431.\\(^1\\) Deduced from this rental at 50 per cent.,\\(^2\\) the revenue would have reached Rs. 14,98,215. Its actual amount was fixed at Rs. 15,53,607, or including the 10 per cent. cess and fees (nazrana) on revenue-free estates, Rs. 17,39,894. In framing their assessments and even rent-rates, most of the settlement officials seem to have been guided by an estimate of the probable revenue and rental prepared by Mr. Reade in 1860. This officer, formerly a Commissioner of Gorakhpur, had drawn up a careful statement showing the increase which might \\textit{a priori} be expected from each parganah. His predictions of the gross rental coincided closely with those made by Mr. Robert Bird some twenty years before, and furnished a fairly true key-note for subsequent proceedings. Mr. Lumsden was, indeed, the only officer who worked with any pretence to independence of Mr. Reade's estimate, or who did not frame his rates more or less to suit that calculation. The assessments of Messrs. F. Bird and Wilson, who had either probably or certainly worked without regard to rent-rates, were afterwards subjected to some critical examination. But in neither case could much fault be found with the result. Mr. Bird's demand may have been deduced from a rental fixed by rule of thumb; yet after Mr. Lumsden's scrutiny, the Board decided that it should stand. A revision of Mr. Wilson's assessment was proposed by Mr. Money, Senior Member of the Board; but the idea was abandoned when it was found that resettlement on more approved principles would scarcely alter the result. The incidence of the new demand, again including Basti, was Re. 0-13-1 on the cultivable, and Re. 1-1-7 on the cultivated area. The corresponding figures of the past settlement were Re. 0-10-5 and Re. 1-1-3. The assessment just described was sanctioned for thirty years, expiring on the 30th June, 1889. The demand was in some cases progressive, not attaining its maximum until several years after the beginning of that term.\n\nIn giving the official account of the collections and balances for the past ten years, the following statement will also show how the settlement has worked:\n\n\\(^1\\)The reason why the assumed rental can be given but approximately is that the Basti and Gorakhpur portions of Maghar were settled together. We know, however, the amount of the ultimate demands assessed on each portion, and we know also the gross assumed rental for both. These form the data for a proportion sum whose result is the approximate assumed rental for Maghar of Gorakhpur.\n\n\\(^2\\)It is perhaps hardly necessary to mention that at the settlements now current the demand was reduced from \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) to \\( \\frac{1}{4} \\) of the assess.\nThroughout the district the revenue falls due in four instalments. The first two are payable after the autumn harvest, on the 15th November and 15th January; the latter two after the spring harvest, on the 1st of May and 1st of June.\n\nThe tenures of the proprietors who pay this revenue may be classed under three heads:\u2014(1) the ordinary zamindari, pattidari, and bhayachara, which have been described elsewhere,\u00b9 and need not be described again; (2) birt; and (3) talukadari.\n\nThe word birt, derived by Wilson from Sanskrit vritti, maintenance, signifies a tenure originally granted by a feudal chieftain on account of kinship or services rendered. This tenure is of four kinds:\u2014\n\n(1) Jewan (jeona, to eat) is an assignment of villages made to a cadet of the Raja's family as a perpetual subsistence for himself and his heirs; (2) Sankalp, meaning, according to Benfey, \"expectation of advantage from a holy work,\" was a religious grant to Brahmins, made in return for rites which were supposed to secure the safety of the grantor's soul; (3) Marwat (marna, to die) was a landed compensation made to the family of a dependant slain in the wars of the Raja: it was sometimes called khunbaha, or washing away of blood; (4) Mukaddam or headman's birt, which is described as more in the nature of a contract than the other forms.\n\nThe nature and rights of a tenure so common in the district formed the subject of long enquiries and deliberations at each recurring revision of assessment. The chief point was to ascertain whether the birt-holders (birtiya or\n\n\u00b9Gazetteer, II, 922, and V, 615-16. The zamindari and pattidari tenures of this district have been largely created by sales since the introduction of British rule. But a few ancient bhayachara village communities exist in the south. Throughout the district, by an error of record at settlement, a number of genuine bhayachara estates were entered as pattidari.\nbirtiha) were or were not proprietors entitled to engage for the revenue. Government at first took the negative view, and directed settlements with the R\u00e1jas and tal\u00fakad\u00e1rs. But in 1835 the Board changed its mind. On the report of the Collector, Mr. Armstrong, it held that the tenure was heritable and transferable, and that the birtiyas must be considered as proprietors of the villages held by them. Settlement has ever since been made with the birtiyas themselves, who have thereby become independent of their feudal chieftains. But they must still pay into the Government treasury, to be credited to those chieftains, a seignorial fee (m\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1na) of 10 per cent. on their revenue.\n\nThe policy of the plan now pursued cannot be questioned; but close inquiry into the former differences of the tenure make it rather doubtful whether it was fair to the R\u00e1jas to place all the birtiyas on the same footing of independence. The Jewan and Marwat forms certainly carried with them a proprietary right in the land assigned. The quit-rent paid by the birtiya was often merely nominal,\u00b9 and his right of transfer was in later times unquestioned. The Sankalp birt also, though it properly carried no right of transfer, was so near to a gift of the proprietary right in the land that there was no injustice in recognising it as such after the grantee had been some time in possession.\n\nBut the Mukaddam birt appears in many cases to have been merely a contract, whereby the management of lands, and a certain commission out of their rents, were granted durante bene placito of the grantor. Such assignments were not intended to convey a proprietary right. In some cases the birtiya was entitled to an allowance of but \u00bdth of the assets, while in return he was bound to collect the remaining \u00bdths for his lord. It seems that another common form of tenure was mistaken for birt, and that the confusion had something to do with the concession of proprietary right to this class of birtiyas. This other tenure was that on which the zam\u00edndars of villages in many of the Sidhua Jobna talukas hold. \"In consideration of protection\" these men transferred their lands to the tal\u00fakad\u00e1r, keeping back for their own support only a portion of the rent.\u00b2 The tenure in this case was not a birt or maintenance, but represented the land reserved by the real owner when making over his rights in the rest to some more powerful landlord. The following is a translation of a comparatively modern \"birt-n\u00e1ma\" supplied by the kindness of\n\n\u00b9It the case of Marwat, writes Sir H. Elliot, the rate was but half that of ordinary birt tenures.\n\u00b2See Mr. Lumden's report on the settlement of parganah Sidhua Jobna, paras. 41-64.\nMr. Irvine. It will be seen that it hardly conveys the idea of a permanent alienation of proprietary right:\n\n\"In the name of R\u00e1ja Joddhr\u00e1j Singh, whose happiness and prosperity equal those of Lakshmi Nar\u00e1yan, who is conspicuous for his virtues in the circle of the dependents whom he protects; who is of the most dignified and noble presence, the R\u00e1ja of R\u00e9j\u00e1s, the god-like dispenser of good and evil. Katnauli village in tappa Pandu of Mans\u00farganj having been assigned in birt to Bhoya Ghiml\u00fa Singh, the said person may with confidence cultivate the land himself or by means of others, and shall pay the rent of the same according to the rates payable by birtiyas. Dated As\u00e1d 1223 fasli.\"\n\nThe express permission here given of cultivating by means of others is much opposed to the idea that the grantee could sell or mortgage the land without leave of the R\u00e1ja. Being derived from the R\u00e1jas, birt tenure of all kinds is naturally rare in the north of the district.\n\nTal\u00fakas or superior tenures, to which the birts were formerly subject, include the remains of the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, Majhauli, and Anola principalities. Next to these come the tal\u00fakas of Padrauna and Tamk\u00fahi, with several others of less importance, founded on grants made by the Majhauli or Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas; and lastly, one held in great part revenue-free by the guardian of the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra at Gorakhpur.\n\nWithin the ancient R\u00faj of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r are now included two tal\u00fakas, known as the Pind\u00e1ri and the R\u00e1ni of Gop\u00e1lpur's j\u00e1g\u00edrs.\n\nThe Pind\u00e1ri j\u00e1g\u00edr was conferred on the celebrated chief Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n in 1818. The object of the grant was to remove him and another marauder, K\u00e1dir Bakhsh, from the scene of their former evil influence, and to afford them sufficient means for a peaceful livelihood. The R\u00e1ja of Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r being heavily in debt and also in arrears, Government sanctioned the Collector's proposal to purchase and make over a part of his estate to the Pind\u00e1ris. The property was at first granted free of all taxation, but was after Kar\u00edm Kh\u00e1n's death assessed with a demand of Rs. 6,000. This settlement was in 1837 declared permanent. At the current settlement, however, a sub-settlement was made with the birtiyas and other occupants of villages, while the Pind\u00e1ris were allowed 55 per cent. of the estimated rental. The domain includes 142 villages and a share in another. Almost the whole is held in birt tenure.\n\nThe Gop\u00e1lpur taluka is that portion of the Gop\u00e1lpur family estates still held by the R\u00e1ni. In this also are several villages held by birtiyas. The history of the Gop\u00e1lpur family will be given a few paragraphs hence.\nThe Majhauli taluka, usually called the Majhauli Raj, represents the remains of the old Majhauli principality, once co-extensive with parganah Salempur Majhauli. A large number of the villages in this estate are held by birtiyas, who hold, indeed, very nearly half the parganah. The domain has been placed under management of the court of wards until such time as a loan made by Government to the Raj\u00e1 is repaid. In the Anola taluka, also, the bulk of the villages is held by birtiyas.\n\nThe Padrauna taluka, coinciding roughly with the northern half of parganah Sidhna Jobna, originated in the grant of a few villages made to a dependent by the Raj\u00e1 of Majhauli about 1750. During the troubles of the next 50 years it was rapidly extended by the fears of numerous weak yeomen, who surrendered a portion of their rights in return for the talukadar's protection. The sons of the first grantee divided their possessions; and, owing to the mismanagement of one branch of the family, the history of half of the taluka was most disastrous, culminating in its confiscation for rebellion after the mutiny. The other half, though once sold for arrears and again nearly ruined by litigation between its owners and the Mahar\u00e1ja of Bettiah, recovered under the management of Isri Partap R\u00e1e, and is now in a flourishing condition. At the formation of the current settlement, a distinction was made between those villages of the taluka which were still partly held by the original proprietors and those which were held by birtiyas. The former were admitted to a sub-settlement which, without forcing the payment of seigniorial fees, m\u00e1lik\u00e1na, secured them in possession of the lands they retained when joining the taluka. The latter also were admitted to proprietary settlement, but required to pay the usual fee of ten per cent. on their revenue. A similar course was followed in the case of the Tamk\u00fahi Raj.\n\nBesides these there exist in parganah Sidhna Jobna five talukas of less importance\u2014B\u00e1nsgaon, Ramkola, Parwarp\u00e1r, Sikhoni, and Sankhop\u00e1r. All of these originated in grants made by the Raj\u00e1 of Majhauli to some of his retainers, after the defeat of Madan Singh's descendants and the conquest of his possessions in this parganah (circ. 1590.) In parganah Haveli the Sat\u00e1si Raj\u00e1s were up to the Mutiny talukad\u00e1rs, receiving seigniorial fees from a very large number of villages. The last Raj\u00e1 having, however, joined the mutineers, his rights were confiscated and the Raj came to an end. His seigniorial rights were put up to auction and purchased for a large sum by a lady resident at Benares. As in other cases, the m\u00e1lik\u00e1na is chiefly paid by birtiyas at the rate of ten per cent. on the demand.\nThe six talukas of Tighra, Domri, Paikoli, Balua, Barera, and Pandipar, were derived from grants made to kinsmen or dependents by the Satasi Rajas. They had before the British occupation been extended in the same manner as the Sidhwa Johna talukas. But after the cession (1801) the last-named property was broken up by sales at the instance of the proprietors, and after the Mutiny the two first were almost entirely confiscated for the rebellion of their owners. The remaining three, though not of much size or importance, still exist. Pargana South Haveli until quite lately contained several talukas held by Brahmins; but of these Brahmpur-Methab\u00e9l, owned by a large brotherhood of D\u00fabes, alone survives. The others, amongst which that of Lachhmipur was the most important, have been broken up by sales chiefly in execution of judicial decrees.\n\nThe Kusmahi taluka, held by the guardian of the Imamb\u00e1ra, consists of 19 villages, whereof 15 are revenue-free. The taluka had its origin in a grant made to the Sh\u00ed\u00e1 devotee Raushan Ali Sh\u00e1h by the Naw\u00e1b Asaf-ud-daula (1775-97), who also built the Imamb\u00e1ra. Raushan Ali was the son of Sayyid Ghul\u00e1m Ashraf, a native of Bukh\u00e1ra, who came to Dehli in the reign of Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (1719-48), but fled thence during one of the Abd\u00e1l\u00ed invasions. Either Raushan himself or his father afterwards settled at Sh\u00e1hpur in parganah Dhuriap\u00e1r. When of middle age Raushan quitted that village and adopted a religious life. He rapidly gained a reputation for peculiar sanctity, and devoted all he possessed towards building an Imamb\u00e1ra.\n\nHearing of his fame Asaf-ud-daula in 1790 came to his assistance, and besides enabling him to build the Imamb\u00e1ra, which is still one of the finest buildings in this district, conferred on him 15 villages. Raushan Ali was succeeded in 1816 by his pupil Ahmad Ali Sh\u00e1h, generally known as the Mi\u00e1n or M\u00edr S\u00e1hib. This Ahmad lived to the age of 80. He assisted Government during the troubles of 1857-58, and his right to hold free of revenue the original 15 villages of the endowment was recognised. Four other villages which were acquired by purchase or private gift are assessed with revenue. The Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib died in 1875, being succeeded by his pupil W\u00e1jid Ali Sh\u00e1h.\n\nThe history of the leading proprietary families will be described at some length in that of the district. Chief amongst them are the titled houses of Anola, Majhauli, Tamk\u00fahi, and\n\n---\n\n1 The Tighra taluka was conferred on Mr. W. Reppe; and half of the Domri taluka on Sardar Surat Singh, a Sikh nobleman. Balua has to a large extent been sold. 2 The forest attached to this domain has been already mentioned, supra p. 291. The domain itself seems to be rather a large revenue-free estate than what is generally known as a taluka.\nGop\u00e1lpur. The Anola R\u00e1j\u00e1s are Sarnet R\u00e1jputs, and have since the extinction of the Sat\u00e1si title been the elder representatives of a family which supplies also a R\u00e1ja to B\u00e1nsi of Basti. Their estates, which are taxed with a revenue of Rs. 6,000, lie in parganah Anola. The Majhauli R\u00e1j\u00e1s are Bisen R\u00e1jputs who have been converted to Muhamadanism. Their estates, lying in parganah Salempur-Majhauli and Lower Bengal, pay a Government revenue of Rs. 42,900. A younger branch of this house, the R\u00e1jas of Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r, was attainted for rebellion in 1857. The Bhu\u00ednhar R\u00e1jput family of Tamk\u00fahi is far newer in the district than either of those already mentioned. Its founder was, after the battle of Baksar (1764), driven from S\u00e1ran into Gorakhpur, where he acquired a large estate much diminished by the time of his grandsons. One of these, Shamsher Sihi, about 1830-40, recovered by purchase a great portion of the lost acres, and settling at Salemgarh, founded the family known as B\u00e1bus of that place. The eldest grandson remained at Tamk\u00fahi, and by continued good management increased the property. Inheriting the title of R\u00e1ja which his grandsire had brought from S\u00e1ran, he obtained from Government its recognition.\n\nThe estates lying in parganah Sidhua Jobna are assessed with a revenue of Rs. 54,500. In the Kausik R\u00e1jputs of Gop\u00e1lpur we again find an historic family. Their original founder, R\u00e1ja I'h\u00far, entered the district about 1350; and in the sixteenth century began constant struggles between the Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r and Gop\u00e1lpur branches of his descendants. In the beginning of the eighteenth century these quarrels ceased, and the head of the latter branch settled at Gop\u00e1lpur as its recognized R\u00e1ja. The present R\u00e1ja is his descendant.\u00b9 The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1ja of Bettia possesses considerable property and influence in this district. But as his residence and the bulk of his estates are in S\u00e1ran, it is unnecessary to give his family more than a passing allusion.\n\nBesides these families the following deserve notice:\u2014(1) That represented by Sayyid Sh\u00e1h Abdullah Sabzposh. The ancestor of this house, who, like other Sayyids, claimed descent from Muhammad, settled in Oudh during the reign of Sikandar Lodi (1488-1506). Hence his descendants came to this district in the time of Aurangzeb (1658-1707), and obtained some villages revenue-free. (2) The B\u00e1bus of D\u00e1nd\u00fap\u00e1r in parganah Haveli, descended from Rndar Singh of the Sat\u00e1si family. (3) The B\u00e1bus of B\u00e1ngaon in Sidhua Jobna descended from two troopers who received a grant from Aurangzeb. (4) The B\u00e1bus of Singhpur in Silhat, connections of the Sat\u00e1si family. (5) The B\u00e1bus of R\u00e1mpur.\n\n\u00b9The title of Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r, held by the other branch of this family, became extinct after the Mutiny.\nThese are Pramar Rajputs of parganah Salempur, where they settled on land granted by the Raja of Majhauli.\n\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the principal landed families are Rajputs of respectable and even great antiquity. In spite of their large rental, their manorial cesses, and their low revenue, the greater part of the landowners are described as by no means well off. The chief reason of their poverty is the indebtedness which diverts a large share of their profits into the hands of the usurers from whom they borrow. And the reasons of that indebtedness have usually been improvidence, excessive expenditure on marriages, and, in the case of a very large number, aversion to doing any labour with their own hands. Buchanan, who calls the landowners ashraf, mentions that very few of them will plough, sow, or reap themselves; and that of these three processes ploughing was held in the greatest aversion. The reason of this aversion was clearly that the men usually employed as harudhas or ploughmen are of very low caste. They are frequently Pasis or Bhars, who are accounted impure by the higher caste; and the plough is considered as contaminated by their use of it.\n\nThe description given by Martin of the relations between landlord and tenant confirms the statement already made, that before our rule the latter were rather in the position of serfs or labourers than of tenants. It shows also how wide was the division between them and the upper class, the ashraf or \"nobility.\" The greater part of the landholders were formerly either Rajputs or Brahmans holding from the different Rajas; and all their kinsmen enjoyed a position immeasurably above that of the churls who were retained to plough and do similar menial services. The invasions of the Hindus were accompanied by the extirpation, or at least the expulsion, of all those amongst the former occupants who had any higher rank than that of servants or labourers. Consequently there was no tenantry holding an intermediate position between the new owners and their slaves, and all who were not members of the conquering body were regarded as beneath contempt.\n\nIn course of time there necessarily arose a class who, though members of the chieftain's family, were in such reduced circumstances that they were forced to cultivate some small portion of land. These were probably the men whom Buchanan mentions as being considered ashraf, though holding an inferior position. The constantly recurring wars of former times prevented the grantees' descendants,\nunless Brahmans, from settling down into agricultural village communities. This, again, may have encouraged them to look on fighting as their proper occupation, and tillage as the inheritance of their servants or slaves. At any rate, the idea that cultivation was beneath the dignity of a gentleman survived till more peaceable times. When arms were laid aside, and attention was turned to the improvement of the land, the grantees found themselves restrained from personal farming. They accordingly let their properties at low rates to husbandmen of low caste, such as the Cham\u0101ra, who were attracted from Oudh and the south. When our rule was introduced, the system of demanding fixed payments for a certain period rendered the landlords ready to follow the same course with their tenants, if they could thereby obtain an increased rent. And the security given by our law and administration attracted a better class of tenants from the south. At the same time the withdrawal of the right of carrying on private feuds with their neighbours, and the non-recognition of any right of ownership over their servants or labourers, removed the causes which had induced the landholders to cultivate through their villeins or serfs. The latter were, moreover, left free to migrate whither they pleased. The area held by tenants (in the usual sense of the term) and by kinsmen of the landlord greatly increased. But it required time to overcome the dislike which petty magnates felt to working in their fields; and meanwhile many had fallen into debt. At the same time sales for arrears, at first enforced with needless frequency, threw a large portion of the zam\u012bnd\u0101rs completely into the hands of the money-lenders. The rascality and fraud of the unwatched native officials has before been noticed. The bitter necessity of providing large sums suddenly, before inquiry into the justice of the demand, and under pain of being sold up, forced landholders to borrow frequently. Buchanan thought that thirty years of such injustices had done more to impoverish proprietors than all the misrule of Muslim Governments. He might perhaps have allowed that the fault was partly that of the Native Governments themselves, which had taught men to refuse revenue when not exacted by force.\n\nBut, however contracted, the indebtedness of the proprietary body continues a serious evil. It during the currency of the last settlement displayed itself in large transfers of landed property. Taking the whole area of Gorakhpur and Basti as 3,208,892 acres, the Board of Revenue shows that 542,259 changed hands, 326,836 by private sale. The widest alienations were in the North Haveli parganah, where 102,670 out of 249,111 acres passed from their former owners.\n\n1 See its review of the current settlement, No. 958A, dated 2nd October, 1871, appendix IX.\nFrom the landlords we pass to their tenants. The cultivators are as a class ignorant, unenterprising, and indebted. They have hitherto lacked the spirit to raise themselves above an abject status inherited from ages of ill-usage and oppression. Even under their own R\u00e1jas and birtiyas they were regarded much as his villeins were regarded by a Norman baron; and the Oudh Government, as already mentioned, subjected them to worse evils than that of mere contempt. Mr. Wynne's settlement report constantly alludes to the degraded condition of many cultivators; and in one place he mentions \"a still lower class, veritable serfs,\" who had sold themselves for the loan of a lump sum, and who were perpetually working off the debt which they never succeeded in quite paying off. Mr. Colvin also notices the absence of the village communities which amongst the more \"robust tribes\" are of such importance, and \"the marked social distinction between the zamind\u00e1rs and cultivators which still exists.\" That distinction was at first, probably, one of race.\n\nAs the different R\u00e1jas conquered their dominions, they brought under subjugation a host of Bhars and P\u00e1s\u00eds whom as their subjects they protected from other enemies, but as a class they considered immeasurably inferior to themselves. These vanquished people were at first, no doubt, the only tillers of the soil. Constant risk of hostile attacks forbade the conquerors to scatter themselves amongst the villages, and they must have lived in a compact body about their chief. The owner of a village was often not only an alien but an absentee. But there was another great gulf betwixt landlord and tenant. If, as security increased, the tenant managed to acquire a fixed right in his holding, that right was extinguished in the troublous times that preceded the British rule.\n\nIn 1818 the Collector reported that \"the zamind\u00e1rs can evict all raiyats, unless holding on a term lease;\" and it appears that such leases were rarely granted for more than three years. Again in 1831 we read a similar assertion, proceeding from the same quarter. \"The cultivators generally claim no right of occupancy in the land. Their rents are paid in money, and are often fixed for a certain term, during which they cannot be evicted.\" As already mentioned, Mr. Bird in 1833 suggested that tenants should receive a twenty-years' lease, in order to give them some permanent interest in their holdings. The reports on the current settlement continue to record the depression of the cultivating class, notwithstanding that Act X. of 1959 was by this time investing some of its members with rights of occupancy.\n\n1Biddale's notes.\nIn his report on parganah Ras\u00falpur Ghaus Mr. Wynne notices that the condition of the tenants has not improved so much as might have been expected, considering the development of the district and the increased value of produce. For this he assigns three causes: (1) the exactions of the zamind\u00e1rs under the name of cesses (abw\u00e1b); (2) the indebtedness and ignorance of the tenants themselves; and (3) the uncertain demand for agricultural produce.\n\nIn his report (1869) on B\u00e1nsi parganah he goes further and says: \"As for tenant right it is non-existent. A few of the more intelligent cultivators may have learned the purport of Act X. of 1859, but I have never heard any other opinion than that the tenancy of the cultivator lasted only so long as the landlord pleased.\" Mr. Lumden in his Anola report mentions how the Bhars and P\u00e1s\u00eds, who were the chief cultivators before the previous settlement (1840), \"have been receding, giving way to the usual agricultural classes, Kurmis, Koeris, and Cham\u00e1rs, and passing further north in quest of fresh land which they can hold at the old almost nominal rates.\" And he notices that right of occupancy has been conferred solely by the provisions of Act X. Before the passing of that enactment it was unknown. Again, in his report on Sidhua Jobna he expresses his opinion that cultivators with a right of occupancy are a creation of the law lately introduced, which confers that right on all who have held land for a period of twelve years.\n\nThese statements will at once show that the position of the tenantry is lower, and was till lately more dependent on the caprices the landlord, than elsewhere in the North-Western Provinces. Under the present law their condition is improving and should continue to improve. But their progress is still opposed by two great obstacles\u2014ignorance and indebtedness. The former prevents their comprehending the protection afforded them by law, and renders them unable to cope with the chicanery of landlords or subordinate officials. The latter sweeps off to the coffer of the money-lender their fair share in the increased wealth, of the district.\n\nSome check has now been placed on the extra cesses and contributions levied by landholders; but there is little doubt that much money is still exacted under the name of abw\u00e1b. In 1818 the Collector, reporting on this subject, remarked that if all such exactions were prohibited, the zamind\u00e1r would get but Rs. 2 where he formerly got Rs. 4 or 5.\nThe most common of the cesses levied on cultivators, as opposed to those realized from trade and market dues, were the following:\n\n1. Fees on marriages; on building new houses; and ground-rent for houses occupied.\n\n2. Cost of valuing the crop with a view to fixings the money-rent.\n\n3. Present at harvest \"to secure good will.\"\n\n4. Fees to the accountant, barber, and other village-servants, often collected and appropriated by the zamindar.\n\n5. Penalty levied on grain sold to persons other than the zamindar or his accredited agents.\n\n6. Contributions to the landlord on the occasion of a marriage in his family.\n\n7. Presents to the factor on collection of the rents.\n\nThe 5th is especially a serious burden, as the zamindar often insists on buying at a lower rate than the fair market one. These exactions were more than once expressly prohibited by the Board and the Governor-General himself; but in 1837 the Collector writes that such prohibitions were useless. The people did not understand their full value, and were too much in the power of their landlords to venture on resistance. He adds that he has been unable to gain any satisfactory information regarding the rights of the tenants, as the zamindars were unwilling to acknowledge, and the tenants were too poor and too ignorant to know if such rights existed. They \"admitted the paramount authority of the zamindar and their absolute dependence on his pleasure.\"\n\nThe kanungos, he says, state that a tenant has rights of occupancy for three years in land newly brought under cultivation by himself. But these rights were not strictly observed if it suited the zamindar's purpose to ignore them; and he could as a rule eject a tenant when he pleased, whilst \"the tenant could in no case transfer his lands to a stranger without express permission.\"\n\nWith such a state of things existing less than 50 years ago, it is no wonder that the tenants have not yet freed themselves from all exactions. Nor are such exactions likely to cease until the general opinion of landholders sets against them. Mr. Alexander believes, however, that tenants have made a great advance towards independence of their landlords. From the exactions of the money-lender they will find it harder to free themselves. The direct interference of Government is in such commercial matters difficult, if not inadvisable.\n\nThis parjot is too often regarded as a nefarious exaction. It is in fact a just and by no means exorbitant rent. In towns it is sometimes called ghardwari.\nadvances made by indigo-factories and by Government itself for the cultivation of opium are at present the only means that have in any way aided the peasantry to free themselves of debt. Education may afford them some protection; but the existing generation of cultivators were reared in a day when education hardly existed, and are too old to begin learning now. So long as the money-lender secures the greater portion of the crop, it is vain to hope for much improvement in the condition of the cultivator.\n\nA small class of tenants known as *\u00e1b\u00e1dk\u00e1rs* were formerly conceded certain privileges in return for bringing waste land under tillage. If they cultivated it themselves, they obtained a lease for a term of years, during which they could not be ejected; and if employed as supervisors over the actual cultivators, they received a share in the rents, also for a fixed term of years. In both cases they could transfer their rights for the remainder of the term; and in both it was usual for the landlord to grant them an advance at starting. A few *\u00e1b\u00e1dkars* still exist.\n\nThe average size of a tenant's holding may be stated as rather over 5 acres in the north, rather over 3 in the south of the district. The larger area of the northern holdings is partly explained by the fact that the frequent migration of their occupants leaves a large number of fields free for yearly disposal. In some parts of the district, such as the light soils of parganah Salempur, it is absolutely necessary to allow all except the well manured and carefully-tilled land near the village to lie fallow once in three or four years. If the fallow land were counted, the holdings would average above the areas now given. But by holding must be understood the land which the tenant holds for cultivation, and on this assumption those areas may be deemed fairly correct.\n\nIn discussing the question as to \"whether a tenant with 5 acres would be as well off as if he had Rs. 8 a mouth,\" it is necessary to assume the following conditions:\n\n1st.\u2014That he has not to work with borrowed capital, and is not therefore burdened by the payment of interest as most cultivators really are.\n\n2nd.\u2014That his rent is an average rent of (say) Rs. 3 an acre.\n\n3rd.\u2014That the soil is of average quality only.\n\n4th.\u2014That he has a wife, one son, and one daughter to assist him, and that he ploughs with his own cattle.\n\nWith these premises our answer to the question must be\u2014No. If the holding consists of mere average soil, the tenant cannot continue growing the whole of it with the more valuable crops; and if he makes an average profit\nof Rs. 12 an acre he is a fortunate man. A succession of two or three bad seasons may, moreover, throw him into debt, and once indebted he will find his expenses nearly doubled. In his report on parganah Ras\u00falpur Ghaus Mr. Wynne has gone very carefully into the question, and comes to the conclusion that an average of Rs. 5-11-6 per bigha\u2014much less than Rs. 12 per acre\u2014is a fair estimate of the profits.\n\nThe effect of Act X. of 1859 and its successor, XVIII. of 1873, has been on the whole decidedly beneficial to the tenants. As before pointed out, their right of occupancy was almost entirely created by the former law. Some landlords profess, indeed, that to prevent the growth of that right they are compelled to eject tenants whose twelve years' occupation is nearly complete. But such ejectments are really very rare, whilst the great number of tenants who have acquired rights under the law may be estimated from the figures given in an appendix to the Board's review of the current settlement (1871). These show that whilst but 3,504 tenants with rights of occupancy existed at the time of the former settlement (1833-36), there were no less than 158,701 at that of the present.\\(^1\\) The advantage of conferring on the cultivator a secure position grows yearly greater, as unoccupied land on which he can settle, if ejected, becomes yearly less. Since the appendix just cited was compiled, the number of tenants with rights of occupancy has largely increased, and it may safely be computed that at least one-third of the whole tenantry is possessed of them. Ex-proprietary tenants have also sprung into existence under the Act of 1873.\n\nRents are usually paid in cash, except in the north of the district, where the landlords almost always receive them in kind. When paid in kind their amount varies from one-third to two-thirds of the produce, but more than half is rarely taken. In some cases the produce is divided after reaping and threshing, and in others after the landlord himself cuts his share of the crops. Frequently the produce is estimated before being cut, and the tenant is bound to deliver a certain weight of grain, or of grain and straw, within a certain time after the harvest. In some rare cases the rent is fixed at a certain weight of grain when the tenant takes the field. Almost always, unless the landlord cuts his own share, the tenant has to bear the expense of cutting and treading out the whole. He has usually, also, to supply his own seed grain. If the landlord supplies it, he almost always takes it back with interest, in\n\n\\(^1\\) But while showing 158,701 tenants with rights of occupancy, this appendix shows 469,334 without such rights. The average holding of the former is given as 3 acres 2 rods 2 poles, and that of the latter as 2 acres 3 rods 13 poles.\naddition to the rent; and as the landlord has a further advantage in measuring\nthe seed, the tenant has a bad bargain. The grain is lent by one measure and\nrecovered by a larger one, no allowance being made for the difference between\nthe two.\n\nRents are as a rule realised punctually and without difficulty. Consider-\ning the great extent of the district, the number of suits for arrears is small. This\nis no doubt chiefly owing to the fact that the rents themselves are moderate.\nIn the south of the district, where tenants have pretty generally acquired rights\nof occupancy, rents have risen. The increased value of produce caused by the\nextension of the export trade, the greater difficulty in obtaining fresh lands to\ncultivate elsewhere, and the right of occupancy conferred by the law after\ntwelve years' possession, have all combined to produce this result. Even the\nsouth has hardly yet reached the stage when the amount of rent is hotly contested\nin the courts; but the struggle is just beginning. Suits for enhancement of\nrent have hitherto been rare, the lowness of the rates before paid leaving room\nfor enhancement by agreement between the parties. In the north, owing to\nunhealthiness of climate, there are fewer tenants who retain holdings sufficiently\nlong to acquire occupancy rights. And landlords are restrained from enhancing\ntheir rents by the difficulty of inducing cultivators to take the land except at very\nmoderate rates. As, moreover, rents in kind are the rule, the amount received\nvaries greatly according to season, and there is perhaps less temptation\nto enhance than where the rent is paid in cash. In good years the value\nof the landlord's share increases with an increased harvest, and in bad years\nenhancement would be followed by the migration of his tenant. The Board's\nsummary of settlement operations shows that since the former settlement, 30\nyears before, the rent-rate on cultivated land had risen about 36 per cent. But\nthis is rather a calculation worked out on certain assumptions than a statement\nof fact.\n\nThere can be no doubt that since the Bhars, P\u00e1s\u00eds, Musahars, and other\nmigratory tenants have been replaced in the south by more\nsettled and more skilful cultivators, the rents of this part of\nthe district have risen very largely. Owing to a rather vague but general\ncustom which requires a tenant growing the more valuable crops to pay a\nhigher rent, the introduction of sugarcane into Sidhua Jobna has caused\na great rise in the rental of that parganah. This custom is probably founded\npartly on the assumption that land capable of growing the more valuable\ncrops is worth more than the rental commonly paid, and partly on the fact that\nthese crops are generally grown by Kurmis and other industrious tenants\nwhom the landlords think it fair to assess much more heavily than Brahmans or Thakurs.\n\nIn the south of Haveli also, and in other parganahs, the increased price of produce and cultivation of lucrative crops has led to an enhancement of rents, effected chiefly by agreement between landlord and tenant. But in the northern portion of the district the great increase in the rental must be ascribed to the extension of cultivation rather than to an enhancement in the rate of the rent. The progress made in northern Haveli and Binayakpur during the currency of last settlement was enormous. In the former the cultivated area increased from 89,900 bighas to 158,200, or by about 80 per cent.; and in the latter from 2,430 to 15,318, or more than 600 per cent. The latter percentage may be overstated owing to error in the figures given of the earlier settlement, but even taking it at 300 per cent. the progress is extraordinary.\n\nThe estimated rental of Gorakhpur is now 42 laks in round numbers; and as the revenue with cesses, also in round numbers, is only 18 laks, it is manifest that landowners are not as a rule called on to enhance. There is in fact not much danger of a rack-rent being imposed during the present settlement. Nor is it likely that the interference of the Courts will be much required in fixing rents. The illegal cesses before referred to are the peasant's real grievance in most cases where a grievance exists.\n\nThe wages received by agricultural labourers are sometimes paid wholly in kind, and seldom altogether in cash. But they may be set down as averaging Rs. 2 monthly. The average monthly wages of the chief artisan classes are as follows:\n\n| Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. |\n|-----|-----|-----|-----|\n| Masons ... 8 | Cobblers ... 6 | Gold or silver-smiths, 8 | Navvy (beldar) 4 |\n| Carpenters ... 8 | Tailors ... 8 | Braziers ... 8 | Litter-bearers, 5 |\n| Blacksmiths ... 8 | Dyers ... 8 | Cotton-carders ... 7 | Watermen ... 6 |\n| Potters ... 8 | Barbers ... 6 | Porters (coolie) ... 4 | Shepherds or herdsmen ... 5 |\n\nThe wages of carpenters and masons were returned in 1868 at 4 annas, and of labourers as from 1\u00bd to 2 annas daily. It was at the same time stated that wages had remained unaltered during the past ten years, but the value of that statement may perhaps be doubted.\n\n1 The following estimates of wages and prices in 1878 have been kindly supplied by the Magistrate-Collector.\n2 See a rather perfunctory return submitted to Mr. W. C. Plowden and printed in his *Wages and Prices*, 1871.\nFor comparing the prices of the past twenty years more abundant materials exist. The following statement shows the market value of the principal agricultural staples in 1859, 1868, and 1878:\n\n| Articles          | Weight purchaseable for one rupee in |\n|-------------------|-------------------------------------|\n|                   | 1859.     | 1868.     | 1878.     |\n|                   | S. c.     | S. c.     | S. c.     |\n| Wheat             | 22 0      | 21 3      | 11 10\u00bd    |\n| Barley            | 35 15     | 35 5      | 16 4      |\n| Gram              | 12 4      | 32 5      | 11 14     |\n| Bajra millet      | 10 8      | 6 0       | 12 6      |\n| Jodr ditto        | 35 9      | 22 4      | 18 11     |\n| District rice     | 21 2      | 22 5      | 10 15     |\n| Pulses of sorts   | 26 2      | 18 6      | 8 5       |\n| Salt              |           |           |           |\n| Cotton, wholesale, per ser | 18 6 4 | 18 8 0 | 110 3\u00bc |\n\nMoney is invested chiefly in land, grain-dealing, or usury. It is of course difficult to lay down the exact rates of interest; but the following are given in Mr. Tupp's Imperial Gazetteer article on the district (1877). In small transactions, when cheap articles are pawned, from 12 to 15 per cent.; and when merely personal security is given, from 18 to 37. In large transactions, when jewels and other valuable property are pledged, from 6 to 12 per cent.; and when land is mortgaged, from 9 to 18. When bankers lend money to bankers on personal security, the rate is from 9 to 18 per cent only. It may be added that when seed-grain is borrowed and the crop hypothecated to the creditor, the interest in grain is 25 per cent. at harvest. When money for the sowings is borrowed on the same security, 12\u00bd per cent. is paid.\n\nThe manufactures of the district are few, and the only one of any great importance at present is that of sugar-boiling, extensively practised in the H\u00e1ta, Padrauna, and neighbouring trade.\nparts of the Deoria and Sadr tahs\u012bla. It is difficult to obtain any very accurate statistics of the number of sugar factories,\\(^1\\) but the following figures were furnished a few years ago by the tahsildars:\n\n| Parganah          | Number of factories | Remarks                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Silhat            | 28                 | Of which 5 are in Mehia village of tappa Indarpur.                      |\n| Shahjahanpur      | 73                 | Of which 37 are said to be in tappa Patna, most of them being in R\u0101mpur Kh\u0101npur village, not far from Deoria. Almost all in the tappas lying north-west and north of Silhat. Of which half are said to be in Barhaj. The exact number is not stated, but is undoubtedly very large. Mr. Lumaden estimated that, in addition to the amount locally consumed, over 10,000 maunds of chini sugar were yearly exported from this parganah. Mr. Alexander thinks that the number cannot be far short of 100, as this is the parganah in which the cane seems to thrive best. Mr. Lumaden numbers 52 factories in his settlement report, but the number has since increased. |\n| Haveli            | 37                 |                                                                         |\n| Salempur          | 65                 |                                                                         |\n| Sidhua Jobna      |                    |                                                                         |\n\nThe factory owner does not as a rule cultivate his own sugarcane. He makes money advances to a number of neighbouring villagers, who grow the crop and usually also extract the juice (\\(r\\)as) in their own or hired mills. The kolhu or sugar-mill has already been described as \u201ca large drum-shaped mortar, in which an almost upright timber beam or pestle is made to turn by an arrangement attaching it to a pair of revolving bullocks.\u201d\\(^2\\) The pestle is here called j\u0101th.\\(^3\\) The horizontal cross-beam which connects it with the bullocks is named k\u0101tar; and on the latter sits a man, partly to guide the bullocks, partly to give greater weight to the j\u0101th. Another man feeds the kolhu and pushes the cane against the j\u0101th. When seen for the first time this operation seems likely to end in crushing the hand of the operator, but accidents very rarely occur. The expressed juice trickles into a lower compartment of the mill, called gh\u0101gu; and hence flows through a wooden spout or parndli into the vessels set to catch it. In Gorakhpur, owing to the difficulty of obtaining stone, the kolhus are all of wood. When extracted juice is generally boiled\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) By factory is here meant a whole factory, and not a single vat. The term k\u0101kh\u0101da is confusingly applied to both. And one tahs\u012bla returned 137 factories, meaning vats, in the single village of R\u0101mpur Kh\u0101npur.\n\n\\(^2\\) Gaz., V., 83 (Budaun district).\n\n\\(^3\\) Sir H. Elliot gives this as the term used in Bohilkhand, as distinguished from Benares. But it is used in this part of Benares also.\nat once in large iron vessels called kar\u00e1hi, which are usually lent by the owner of the factory to which the boiled syrup (gur or r\u00e1b)\\(^1\\) is to go, but are sometimes owned or hired by the cultivators. Occasionally, if the factory be very close, the juice is taken there at once. It makes of course a great difference to the cultivator whether he manufactures independently or on behalf of the factory owner. The latter takes an ample return for the advances he makes and for the hire of the kar\u00e1hi. But very few villagers grow cane altogether without advances; and one manufacturer informed Mr. Alexander that he did not care to deal with such persons. He had not, he explained, the same hold over them as over cultivators who had bound themselves, by taking his advances, to grow a certain amount of cane. In a year, however, when cane is at all scarce, an independent cultivator could command a very high price for his gur and obtain large profits. The clients of the factory, who receive payment at a rate fixed beforehand, derive no additional profit from high prices. But where most of the cultivators must work on borrowed capital, this system of advances is perhaps the best way of supplying a useful want.\n\nAfter its receipt at the factory the r\u00e1b syrup is again boiled twice and cleared of its scum. It is then allowed to harden and becomes ch\u00edn\u00ed,\\(^2\\) which finds a very large export towards the south. The sugar is sometimes refined by additional boiling and skimming, but is more often sent away in the rough state, packed in large earthen jars.\n\nNo trustworthy statistics are available to show the average amount of kh\u00e1nd or dry sugar produced yearly in a factory. But some establishments visited by Mr. Alexander at Pipr\u00e1ich confessedly turned out from 400 to 500 maunds of refined sugar (ch\u00edn\u00ed) each in a season. The average value was about Rs. 12 to 15 a maund; and as the cultivators get for their r\u00e1b about Rs. 3 to 4 only, the factories must make considerable profits. But they have usually, it must be remembered, to carry the ch\u00edn\u00ed some way before they can command a market.\n\nThe principal places where the kh\u00e1nd is collected for exportation are Captainganj, Pipr\u00e1ich, Gorakhpur, S\u00e1hibganj (in Sidhua Jobna), and Barhaj. From Captainganj a little is said to go up to Nep\u00e1l; but by far the greater part of the trade finds its way by Gorakhpur, the Rapti, or the Little Gandak and Barhaj, to the Gh\u00e9gra. A considerable amount also descends the Great Gandak to Calcutta. The Little Gandak is, as before mentioned, navigable only during\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In Gorakhpur the word g\u00e9r is used without distinction for both gur and r\u00e1b.\n\n\\(^2\\) Ch\u00edn\u00ed or Chinese is the term applied to coarse brown sugar, as opposed to the fine variety named misri or Egyptian.\nthe rainy season; but a large trade from along its banks travels by the Padrauna and Barhaj road to the latter place.\n\nBut the great trade of the district is undoubtedly the export of grain; and especially of rice, barley, and wheat. In his report on the settlement of South Haveli (1867) Mr. Lumsden comments as follows on the vast increase which during the past twenty years had occurred in this traffic:\u2014\u201cThe enormous rise in prices throughout this district is mainly to be attributed to the great increase in export trade. The natives thoroughly understand this, and prices during the last famine in Bengal rose to little under those current in the famine district, though grain was abundant, and it was commonly remarked that if the Sark\u00e1r (Government) would only stop the export trade, barley would be selling at a maund the rupee.\u201d\n\nThe rice comes chiefly from Nep\u00e1l and the north of Gorakhpur, whence it finds its way by the Lautan, Nostanwoa, Deogh\u00e1ti, and T\u00fatibh\u00e1ri tracks to Dh\u00e1ni b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Hence it is again distributed to Mendh\u00e1wal in Basti, Gorakhpur, or Barhaj on the Gh\u00e1gra. Another line taken by this traffic is through Bahwar or T\u00fatibh\u00e1ri and Nichlavai to Captaignanj, whence in the earlier part of winter the rice can be conveyed down the Little Gandak in boats. The carts which carry the rice are strongly constructed, so as to stand rough journeys across country. In the months of the cold weather, which is their busy season, they may be seen thronging the market at Dh\u00e1ni-b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Besides rices, they often bring chil\u00eds, lac, and the rough square pice of Nep\u00e1l.\u00b9 Except in the form of such coins, the import of copper into British territory is forbidden by the Nep\u00e1lese Government.\n\nThe rice imports from Nep\u00e1l amount, as will be hereafter seen, to about 1,37,500 maunds yearly; but how large a weight is produced in the north of the district itself is shown by the annual acreage under rice in Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj tahsil alone.\u00b2 Allowing for the local wants of the population in that tahsil, Mr. Alexander thinks there should be a surplus of at least 50,000 maunds for exportation in a fair year. But Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj is not the only tahsil which exports large quantities of rice. That of Sidhua Jobna finds its way either to Ragarganj on the Little Gandak, or by Tiw\u00e1ri Patti and S\u00e1hibganj to the Great Gandak. The large part played in export traffic by the rivers of the district has been already referred to. Quan-\n\n\u00b9 A large proportion of the so-called Gorakhpuri pice are apparently Nep\u00e1lese. \u00b2 About 156,400 acres, supra, p. 334.\ntities of grain from B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on and the south-eastern parganahs of Basti find their way down the Ku\u00e1na to Gola and Barhaj. Timber as well as grain are conveyed from Nep\u00e1l by the Rapti and its tributaries, the Dhamela, and Rohin. The greater portion of all this traffic is absorbed by the Gh\u00e1gra. The trade passing down that river, as registered by the Bengal Government at Darauli, just outside the Gorakhpur frontier, weighed in 1877-78 more than all the exports passing road posts in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh.\\(^1\\)\n\n\"The trade of the Gh\u00e1gra,\" writes Mr. Buck, \"is of very great importance in connection with the light railway project for the Gorakhpur district. It seems now tolerably certain that a railway can always compete with a river. This being the case, it would seem that a line running from Naw\u00e1bganj (in Oudh) down the Gh\u00e1gra-Gandak d\u00fa\u00e1b to Chapra on the Ganges would best meet the requirements of trade. A great part, perhaps the greater part, of the Gh\u00e1gra trade consists of grain, oilseeds, and sugar exported to the port of Calcutta.\" Amongst the oilseeds thus exported linseed is conspicuous; for like all sub-Him\u00e1layan tracts, Gorakhpur is a great producer of that commodity.\n\nSo much for trade-routes by river. We pass to those by road. With Nep\u00e1l, as we have already seen, the traffic is less by road than track. The distributing emporium in Nep\u00e1l is as a rule B\u00fatwal, while the Gorakhpur emporia are Dh\u00e1ni and Nichlaval. The chief highways to and from Bengal are the Gorakhpur-Chapra and Gorakhpur-S\u00e9r\u00e1n road, quitting the district at Gathnigh\u00e1t and Sam\u00far respectively. The trade with Gh\u00e1zipur and Azamgarh crosses the Gh\u00e1gra at Deorigh\u00e1t, entering this district at Barhalganj. Commerce with Basti passes by the Gorakhpur-Lotan and Gorakhpur-Basti roads.\n\nThe traffic with Nep\u00e1l, Bengal, and Azamgarh or Gh\u00e1zipur was in 1877-78 registered at several outposts of the Agriculture and Commerce Department. The Nep\u00e1l stations were at N\u00e1otanwa and Deogh\u00e1ti in Bin\u00e1yakpur, and T\u00fat\u00edbh\u00e1ri and Bahwar in Tilpar; the Bengal, at Gathnigh\u00e1t in Salempur and Sam\u00far in Sidhna Jobna; and the solitary south-frontier outpost was at Deorigh\u00e1t in Azamgarh. In the preceding year there had been a third Bengal outpost, at P\u00edpragh\u00e1t on the Gorakhpur-Bettia road; but this was, owing to the insignificance of its registrations, abolished. The following table shows the statistics of the Nep\u00e1l stations:\n\n\\(^1\\) The weight of Gh\u00e1gra exports, as registered at Darauli, was 39,83,592 maunds; and of Gh\u00e1gra imports, 3,76,342 maunds.\n## Imported across Nepal Frontier, 1877-78.\n\n| Name of outpost | Class A | Class B | Class C |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                 | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   |\n| Rahwar          | 27,903  | Rs.     | 38,859  | Rs.     | 8,623   | Rs.     | 7,445   | Rs.     | 8,360   | Rs.     | 21,436  | Rs.     |\n| Tuli-bhar       | 48,808  |         | 64,870  |         | 4,325   |         | 4,324   |         | 1,698   |         | 2,411   |         |\n| Deoghati        | 21,051  |         | 30,434  |         | 1,520   |         | 1,534   |         | 869     |         | 1,400   |         |\n| Naotanwa        | 40,022  |         | 1,00,204|         | 1,836   |         | 1,907   |         | 1,318   |         | 2,257   |         |\n| Total           | 1,37,591|         | 2,34,367|         | 16,304  |         | 10,336  |         | 11,330  |         | 15,354  |         |\n\n## Exported across Nepal Frontier in the same year.\n\n| Name of outpost | Class A | Class B | Class C |\n|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                 | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   | Weight  | Value   |\n| Rahwar          | 282     | Rs.     | 2,226   | Rs.     | 860     | Rs.     | 633     | Rs.     | 453     | Rs.     | 550     | Rs.     |\n| Tuli-bhar       | 29,93   |         | 33,793  |         | 2,52    |         | 6,453   |         | 5,493   |         | 9,897   |         |\n| Deoghati        | 722     |         | 4,541   |         | 409     |         | 1,503   |         | 1,573   |         | 1,027   |         |\n| Naotanwa        | 727     |         | 4,008   |         | 268     |         | 1,262   |         | 2,946   |         | 1,190   |         |\n| Total           | 4,794   |         | 3,4563  |         | 3,94    |         | 9,831   |         | 10,413  |         | 6,054   |         |\nAs, however, traffic finds its way across the frontier by numerous by-paths, the registration is confessedly imperfect. It has been determined to move the Nep\u00e1l posts further back from the frontier, chiefly on account of the highly malarious character of their present sites: and this measure is likely to increase also the accuracy of the returns. The figures for the Bengal posts have been supplied in less detail, being simply arranged under the headings of class A, or articles whose value is generally proportionate to their weight; class B, beasts or other chattels reckoned by number; and class C, goods whose value bears no relation to their weight:\n\n| Imports | Exports |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Class** | **Class** | **Class** | **Class** | **Class** | **Class** |\n| **A.** | **B.** | **C.** | **A.** | **B.** | **C.** |\n| **Weight or number** | **Value** | **Weight or number** | **Value** | **Weight or number** | **Value** |\n| Post. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. | Rs. |\n| Samur | 15,459 | 1,95,436 | 1,274 | 2,399 | 1,427 | 44,984 | 1,19,300 | 9,449 | 43,091 | 420 |\n| Gaitnigh\u00e9t | 10,966 | 2,06,995 | 4,795 | 1,958 | 6,055 | 18,346 | 1,90,811 | 2,242 | 929 | 1,076 |\n| Total | 26,425 | 4,02,431 | 6,069 | 4,357 | 7,482 | 63,329 | 3,10,111 | 11,691 | 43,020 | 1,496 |\n\nFor the Deorigh\u00e1t post, which at the close of 1877-78 had been established for nine months only, the returns are even simpler. They may be shown for half a year as follows:\n\n| Whence or whither bound. | Imports | Exports |\n|--------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                         | Maunds. | Rupees. | Maunds. | Rupees |\n| To or from Gh\u00e1zipur      | 24,124  | 16,09,396 | 8,468  | 52,291 |\n| Azamgarh                 | 8,509   | 2,14,808  | 2,839  | 24,303 |\n| Total                    | 32,633  | 18,24,204 | 11,307 | 76,594 |\n\nThe principal imports passing this station were, from Gh\u00e1zipur, European piece-goods (15,088 maunds), oilseeds, and saltpetre; from Azamgarh, cotton goods, oilseeds, and metals. The chief exports were to Gh\u00e1zipur rice (5,528 maunds), and to Azamgarh grain.\nFrom these registration statistics and other information it may be gathered that the chief exports of Gorakhpur are rice, sugar, grain, and oilseeds; the chief imports, European and other cloth. The district, in fact, disposes to others of its surplus food, and receives from others their surplus clothing. The distinctive feature of the cloth-trade is the import of European piece-goods from Gh\u00e1zipur. In the district itself, of whose total area but '002 per cent. is under cotton, little cloth is produced. Indigenous cotton and cotton manufactures find their way from many surrounding marts, and chiefly through Oudh from Cawnpore. But European fabrics are despatched from a few distributing centres only, of which Gh\u00e1zipur is one. The merchants who export grain are said to take in exchange large quantities of cloth, which are sold at Gorakhpur, Barhaj, Dh\u00e1ni, S\u00f3hibganj, and Mendh\u00e1wal, to numerous travelling retailers (baip\u00e1ri). Gorakhpur is of course the principal seat of this business; and a statement of its cloth and other imports will be found in the Gazetteer portion of this notice. A good deal of cloth is re-exported to Nep\u00e1l, just as most of the Nep\u00e1l rice is re-exported to other districts. Amongst minor imports must be mentioned the timber, hides, braziery, deer-horns, wool, and ivory, that Nep\u00e1l sends into this district. In Sidhua Jobna, also, is a large hide trade. That of Salempur has somewhat declined\u2014a fact which, as the business tended to encourage cattle-poisoning, is hardly to be regretted. Brass and iron vessels find their way from Patna and Calcutta as well as Nep\u00e1l.\n\nThe district trade is of quite modern growth. In 1802 Mr. Routledge writes that \"the \u00e1mil has before parting wrung out the last remnant of wealth in this desolated province. Nothing is grown beyond the bare necessaries of life, though the soil is good and fine crops might be grown on it. The produce is barely sufficient for local consumption.\" But jealous of a monopoly which they feared might be infringed, and of forests whose clearance they dreaded, the Company's officers did little at first to encourage trading enterprise. One of their first measures was to order a Mr. McCleish, who sought leave to build a bungalow, out of the district.\n\nThe first export trade seems to have been in timber, which anyone was apparently allowed to cut on payment of a duty. The collection of this duty was in 1803 farmed for Rs. 11,501. There was also some traffic in cattle and in a kind of coarse cloth imported from Nep\u00e1l; but the chief articles of import were salt and sugar. Small as it was, this trade was almost crushed by endless duties. Mr. Routledge reported that a s\u00e1ir tax was levied on every article crossing the Nep\u00e1l frontier, the Gh\u00e1gra, and the Gandak, and a r\u0101hd\u00e1ri or transit duty at every parganah boundary which it crossed. He endeavoured to make these imports smaller and more certain; and selecting at the same\ntime trade dep\u00f4ts in each parganah, placed over each dep\u00f4t a police officer (kotw\u00e1l) and a public weighman. In 1803 he speaks of establishing a flourishing trade between B\u00fatwal (then within British limits), Bh\u00fat\u00e1n, and Tibet. B\u00fatwal was then as now the great centre of Nep\u00e1l trade in this part of the submontane country. The same year an exceptionally dry season caused a scarcity, and a bounty was granted on the import of grain.\n\nIn 1806 application was made by another European, Mr. Yeld, for leave to build \"a residence for purposes of cultivating indigo and manufacturing the same.\" The Collector of the day strongly supported the request; but the Governor-General in Council refused it, as against public policy. In 1807 mention is made of bank-notes appearing in the district; and in 1805 or 1809 some land was at length granted for an indigo factory in Azamgarh, then a part of this district. Excise seems always to have yielded a large revenue, and the amount of this in 1812 was Rs. 1,07,405; but excise hardly perhaps comes within the scope of a trade history.\n\nIn 1812-13 exportation of grain into Oudh and Nep\u00e1l was forbidden, in view of \"the impending scarcity.\" After a few months, however, the prohibition was removed. Three or four years later mention is made of a considerable trade from Benares in cloth, sugar, and saltpetre. In 1820 L\u00e1hori salt is noticed as selling at 2\u00bd seers the rupee, and in the same year mention is made of an ad valorem duty of 5 per cent. on all goods coming into Gorakhpur city. In 1824 the Collector reported on the large lac trade flourishing in B\u00e1nsi and other places, and with Government consent imposed a heavy tax thereon. As an illustration of the means by which Government officers sought in those days to increase their salaries, it may be mentioned that he respectfully claimed a percentage on the collections, as a reward for having discovered this new source of revenue.\n\nIn 1827 the Governor-General in Council again grew uneasy about English and other European interlopers, \"often men who have accumulated money by embezzlement, and who now wish to take the trade of the country into their own hands.\" This gives the clue to the objections entertained by Government against indigo-planters and other European settlers. It was feared that in a vast district, officered by but one or two European officials, such persons might acquire sufficient influence to monopolise trade.\n\nIn 1830, after Mr. Reade's appointment as Magistrate and Collector, we hear the first mention of a considerable export trade in grain. He writes that \"the roads to Nep\u00e1l, Oudh, S\u00e1ran, Gh\u00e1zipur, and Tirh\u00fat are in excellent order, and large quantities of grain have lately been exported for the western\nmarkets.\" In the same year salt outposts were established to stop the illicit trade with Oudh, and an immediate rise in the price of salt ensued. In 1831 the first jungle grant was leased to Mr. McLachlan.\n\nAbout 1835, Buchanan made some attempt to gauge the exports and imports from or to the north of the district. How unsuccessful the attempt was may perhaps be gathered from the fact that he valued the rice imports at over 18 lakhs of rupees. The more modest modern estimate of the Agriculture and Commerce Department (Rs. 2,34,367), though no doubt imperfect, is far more likely to be accurate. Buchanan's rice, moreover, was all, save a minute fraction, husked; and recent returns shows that the rice now imported is all, save a minute fraction, unhusked. It is hard, again, to believe him when he writes that the greater part of commodities other than timber \"is sent by land carriage, and not by rivers.\" His remarks on the state of arts, commerce, and manufactures disclose the existence of no remarkable or peculiar industry. The arts were washing, carpentry, and boat-building; the manufactures brazen vessels, threads or string, cloth, and salt. The commerce in grain and sugar is noticed, and the timber trade mentioned as one of considerable importance, in which two Europeans are engaged. And we are told that the copper, copper-vessels, and copper-coin, \"all come from the dominions of Gurkha.\"\n\nIn 1839 it is mentioned that the owner of an indigo factory near Barhaj applied for a lease of the town and market for Rs. 1,000 yearly. He was refused, on the ground that he wished to compel the cultivation and export of indigo, which the people much dislike. But it is not even hinted that the town is a great centre of trade, and the export business of Gorakhpur seems in truth to have been irregular and unimportant until 1840. When Government treasure was not unfrequently snatched by gang-robbers from the custody of the spearmen, private traders would have been foolish to carry about them more than a few rupees worth of goods.\n\nThe rise of the present trade undoubtedly dates from the revision of police by Mr. Reade,\u00b9 and the clearance of the forest under numerous leases about 1840, when large tracts were granted to different gentlemen whose capital and enterprise gave a stimulus to commerce generally. How greatly commerce has extended in the last twenty years may perhaps be shown by the statistics relating to the import of cloth. Mr. Swinton's Manual\u00b2 values the cloth imported yearly into the district about 1860 at half a lakh of rupees. The Provincial Administration Report for 1862-63 increases the figure to two lakhs. About 1872, the imports of cloth into Gorakhpur city alone were\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 377. \u00b2 P. 25.\ndeemed worth 3\u00bd l\u0101khs, and the municipal returns for 1876-77 show that in that year the figure was actually over 5 l\u0101khs.\n\nThere is still room for an extension of the trade, especially with Nep\u00e1l; and if the Government of that country would but remove some of the import and export duties which now press on the traders, and turn their attention to improving the roads between B\u00fatwal and Lotan, or making some of the small streams in the same neighbourhood navigable, a large import business in copper, iron, and timber might be expected.\n\nIn the foregoing remarks on trade have been mentioned the principal marts of the district. But in each parganah are several lesser towns or villages where markets occur once or more weekly. At certain places fairs are held, generally in honour of religious festivals. The largest is the Dh\u00e1nuk Jag fair at Baikunthpur, in parganah Salem-pur-Majhauli. Held in November-December (Aghan), to commemorate the marriage of R\u00e1ma, it has an estimated attendance of from 30,000 to 40,000 persons, and lasts a fortnight. The bathing-fair at B\u00e1nsigh\u00e1t in Sidhua Jobna, held in the preceding month, is said to gather together 25,000 people, who for three days wash their sins away in the Gandak. Similar gatherings with 10,000 or 15,000 attendants muster at Rudarpur in Silhat on the Shi\u00far\u00e1ttri festival in February-March; at Barhaj on the K\u00e1rttik Puranm\u00e1sli in October-November; at Birdgh\u00e1t in Haveli, on the R\u00e1ml\u00edla in August-September; at Barhalganj on both R\u00e1ml\u00edla and K\u00e1rttik Puranm\u00e1sli; at Paikauli in Salempur, on the Janam-Ashtami and R\u00e1maanami, in March and August;\u00b9 at the Sohn\u00e1g shrine, in April-May; at Bahr\u00e1mpur in Haveli, in May-June, to celebrate the memory of Sayyid S\u00e1l\u00e1r-i-Mas\u00e1ud, saint and martyr; at Kabir-n\u00e1th in Sidhua Jobna, to worship at Shiv\u00e1\u2019s shrine; and at Tarkulwa, in the same parganah, to worship at that of his consort. Commerce and gaiety are the principal objects of these fairs; but the religious character which attaches to them is still something more than a fiction.\n\nIn the measures used at its marts and fairs the Gorakhpur district is most peculiar. In some parganahs every small market village has its own standards of capacity, weight, and measure. These vary not only from place to place, but in many cases with the nature of the commodity sold. The Government maund weighs as usual 8,228lb. avoirdupois, containing 4 panseris or 20 sers of 2,057lb. each; while the ser contains 16 chhat\u00e1ks of about 2 ounces. But in some parganahs, as for instance Bin\u00e1yakpur, these measures are altogether unknown.\n\n\u00b9 At Paikauli lives a holy man named Panh\u00e1n-j\u00ed, who presides over the fairs both at that place and Baikunthpur.\nThere the weight of 4 B\u00fatwal pice equals 1 ganda; 25 gandas equal 1 sei; 16 se\u00eds, one m\u00e1ni; and 16 m\u00e1nis, one gon.\\(^1\\) The sei weighs 1:149 of a Government ser. The m\u00e1ni is a familiar measure of seed, and therefore of land,\\(^2\\) in Bundelkhand and the Central Provinces. The rajia or rasia is another grain measure, weighing 42 gandas of pice.\n\nThe measures of area are no less Protean. The following table shows the officially recognized value of the bigha in different parganahs:\n\n| Parganah                  | Measure of Government bighas in square yards | Number of bighas to the acre | Bigha, what decimal fraction of the acre |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Dhur\u00edp\u00e1r, Bhau\u00e9p\u00e1r        | ...                                         | 3,136                       | 1:5433+                                |\n| Chilli\u00e9p\u00e1r and Anola      | ...                                         |                             | '6480                                  |\n| Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur     | ...                                         | 4,444                       | 1:0891                                 |\n| Maghar                    | ...                                         | 3,583                       | 1:3700                                 |\n| Sidhna Jobna              | ...                                         | 1,968                       | 2:4593                                 |\n| Mahauli                   | ...                                         | 3,306                       | 1:4640                                 |\n| Silhat                    | ...                                         | 3,161                       | 1:5311                                 |\n| Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur              | ...                                         | 2,600                       | 1:34                                   |\n| Haveli                    | ...                                         | 3,164                       | 1:5297+                                |\n\nThe bigha is the square of the measure of length known as a jar\u00edb or chain. The jar\u00edb contains as a rule 20 lathas, a term which may be literally translated rod or pole; and the latha 5 h\u00e1ths or cubits. The ignorance of mensuration shown by the common people throws a great power for evil into the hands of the landlord and village accountant. \u201cI have over and over again,\u201d writes Mr. White in his Haveli Settlement Report, \u201casked a cultivator to give me his idea of a bigha, to measure it off in paces\\(^3\\) or otherwise intelligibly describe it to me. And the invariable reply has been\u2014\u2018Don\u2019t know. Whatever the zam\u00ednd\u00e1r and patw\u00e1ri mark off and point out to us, that is our holding of so many bighas, and we pay rent accordingly.\u2019 The better sort of cultivators are not so obtuse; but I speak of the general ruck of raigats.\u201d A quarter of a bigha, or 5 biswas, is sometimes called manda; and half a mile, or a quarter of a kos, is known as dhdb. The bigha is used as a measure of distance as well as area.\n\n\\(^1\\) Under the name of don, this measure is familiar also in the west and south. \\(^2\\) The measurement of land by the quantity of seed required to sow it is common amongst the hilla on either side of Ganges valley. See Mr. Conybeare\u2019s Note on Parganah Deahi and its assessment, Chap. IV. \\(^3\\) The pace, elsewhere kadam, is here known as parag or deg.\nThe statistics of this part of the notice may be closed with a financial statement showing the total revenue and expenditure of the district for three out of the past fifteen years:\n\n| Receipts | 1863-64 | 1870-71 | 1877-78 |\n|----------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.      | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Land revenue | 28,35,478 | 16,61,642 | 17,34,639 |\n| Stamps    | 1,48,676 | 1,34,510 | 1,98,690 |\n| Miscellaneous and revenue receipts | ... | ... | ... |\n| Medical receipts (L. and J.) | 12,440 | 48,308 | 27,915 |\n| Police    | 3,950 | 1,060 | 1,586 |\n| Public works | 881 | 5,900 | 4,267 |\n| Income tax | 1,16,616 | 68,845 | 43,214 |\n| Local fund | 2,90,434 | 3,10,684 | 3,78,132 |\n| Post-office | 8,319 | 16,170 | 22,611 |\n| Medical   | ... | ... | 10 |\n| Education | ... | ... | 749 |\n| Excise    | 1,12,918 | 1,06,843 | 1,00,300 |\n| Forest    | 4,253 | 31,750 | 29,364 |\n| Cash and transfer remittances | 32,539 | 88,160 | 57,505 |\n| Transfer receipts and money orders | 4,44,527 | 8,45,153 | 1,81,272 |\n| Municipal funds | ... | 24,074 | 36,056 |\n| Recoveries | 6,31,745 | 3,480 | 729 |\n| Ledger and savings bank deposits | ... | 1,56,785 | 1,54,885 |\n| Miscellaneous | 35,803 | 16,210 | 11,824 |\n| Jail      | 260 | 2,510 | 6,840 |\n| Registration | ... | 16,284 | 16,121 |\n| Deposits  | 6,98,811 | 2,44,713 | 2,04,530 |\n\n| Expenditure | 1863-64 | 1870-71 | 1877-78 |\n| Rs.         | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Revenue charges | 1,04,719 | 85,470 | 1,28,257 |\n| Forest      | 2,597 | 4,681 | ... |\n| Excise      | 1,092 | 5,614 | 2,876 |\n| Assessed taxes | 1,894 | 315 | 5,809 |\n| Stamps      | 7,114 | 5,542 | 1,619 |\n| Settlement  | 54,657 | 14,670 | ... |\n| Judicial charges | 62,643 | 1,25,733 | 1,11,363 |\n| Police, district and rural | 1,19,461 | 94,580 | 90,119 |\n| Public works | 13,479 | 11,500 | 1,04,000 |\n| Provincial and local funds | 2,51,601 | 2,55,881 | 283,004 |\n| Post-office | 5,228 | 17,342 | 18,725 |\n| Medical     | 3,803 | 9,516 | 18,519 |\n| Educational | 1,200 | 7,750 | 8,661 |\n| Cash and transfer remittances | 20,22,478 | 2,95,616 | 4,83,221 |\n| Transfer receipts and money order | 13,80,847 | 54,613 | 66,139 |\n| Municipal funds | ... | 29,397 | 44,271 |\n| Advances    | 2,30,051 | 2,780 | 21,698 |\n| Pensions    | 1,230 | 10,073 | 10,195 |\n| Ledger and savings bank deposits | ... | 1,11,099 | 1,45,028 |\n| Miscellaneous | 3,160 | 2,130 | 3,775 |\n| Jail       | 20,879 | 18,100 | 28,331 |\n| Registration | ... | 6,620 | 4,824 |\n| Deposits   | 6,70,296 | 2,69,004 | 2,66,261 |\n| Military   | 1,24,306 | 1,35,348 | 1,75,584 |\n| Interest and refunds | 5,160 | 5,702 | 4,869 |\n\nTotal | 58,56,640 | 32,82,495 | 31,61,222 |\nTotal | 50,86,998 | 15,79,026 | 19,27,104 |\n\nSeveral items of the above account seem to demand some brief detail.\n\nThe municipal funds are collected and disbursed under Act XV. of 1873, by the corporation of Gorakhpur. In 11 lesser towns\u2014Barhalganj, Gajpur, Gaura, Gola, L\u00e1rb, Padrunna, Pipraich, R\u00e1mpur-Kh\u00e1npur, Rudarpur, S\u00e1lempur-Majhauli, and Siswa-b\u00e1z\u00e1r\u2014a house-tax is levied under Act XX. of 1856 on well-to-do residents. The income and outlay both of such towns and the municipality\nwill be detailed in the Gazetteer articles on each. Meanwhile, it may be mentioned that the expenditure is in every case chiefly on police, conservancy, and public works.\n\nThe income-tax was imposed by an Act of 1870, and abolished with the close of the financial year 1872-73. It was in the latter levy upon 559 incomes exceeding Rs. 1,000, and realized Rs. 18,528. The license-tax, imposed by Act VIII. of 1877, was in force for a part of 1877-78, attaining in that year a total return of Rs. 43,214.\n\nExcise is levied under Act X. of 1871. The income and expenditure under this head may be shown for five years as follows:\n\n| Year ending 30th September | Still-head duty | Distillery fees | License fees for vend of native and English liquors | Drugs | Madak. | Tarl. | Opium | Fines and macele-neous | Gross receipts | Gross charges | Net receipts |\n|---------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|------|-------|------|------|------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n|                           | Rs.            | Rs.            | Rs.                                           | Rs.  | Rs.   | Rs.  | Rs.  | Rs.                     | Rs.          | Rs.          | Rs.          |\n| 1872-73                   | 54,885         | 22             | 16,202                                        | 7,500| 746   | 16,602| 480  | 665                     | 97,101       | 4,912        | 92,170       |\n| 1873-74                   | 39,976         | 14             | 12,934                                        | 7,872| 238   | 16,210| 1,025| 108                     | 78,377       | 3,805        | 74,571       |\n| 1874-75                   | 52,901         | 4              | 10,372                                        | 9,156| 240   | 14,249| 1,494| 28                      | 88,444       | 2,938        | 85,506       |\n| 1875-76                   | 60,453         | 15             | 14,969                                        | 10,100| 360   | 17,210| 1,406| 21                      | 1,04,534     | 2,460        | 102,085      |\n| 1876-77                   | 59,744         | 16             | 23,189                                        | 14,394| 492   | 19,805| 1,549| 10                      | 1,19,198     | 3,356        | 115,842      |\n\nStamp duties are collected under the Court Fees Act (VII.) of 1870 and the Stamp Act (I.) of 1879, which has lately superseded that of 1869.

The expense of establishment and other charges amounted during the same year to Rs. 4,755-11-7. The total value of all property affected by registered documents is returned as Rs. 21,91,318, of which Rs. 19,35,412 represents immoveable, and the remainder moveable property.\n\nConnected with the subject of judicial receipts and expenditure is the number of cases tried. This amounted in 1878 to 42,197, of which 5,853 were tried by civil, 6,017 by criminal, and 30,327 by revenue courts.\n\nThe medical charges are incurred chiefly at the six dispensaries: the central at Gorakhpur, and branches at Rudarpur, Kasia, Barhalganj, Belaharia, and Mah\u00e1r\u00e9jganj. The returns given below show that the chief endemic disease of the district is intermittent fever or ague, due to the moisture of the climate, the highness of the spring-level, and the abundance of forest. The character of the ague varies in different parts of the district. In the south it is comparatively mild; but in the north, towards the Tar\u00e1\u00ed, it is of a severe and often intractable type, being attended with complications of the liver and spleen. The latter form of the disease often goes by the name of Gorakhpur fever. Goitre is extremely common on the calcareous bh\u00e1t lands near the river Gandak and its branches. It may be attributed with great probability to the water, which contains large quantities of lime salts in solution. The severest cholera epidemic of later years appears to have been that of 1869. Dr. Prentis came to the conclusion that about 11 per cent. of the inhabitants of Gorakhpur perished from it, and the cholera returns of the year show for the whole district 8,593 deaths. The mortuary statements for the five recent years may be thus summarised:\n\n| Year | Fever | Small-pox | Bowel complaints | Cholera | Other causes | Total | Proportion of deaths to every 1,000 of population |\n|------|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| 1873 | ...   | 37,028    | 14,928          | 2,312   | 429          | 5,270 | 59,967                                        | 29\u00b769 |\n| 1874 | ...   | 34,308    | 13,795          | 2,580   | 3,988        | 4,835 | 59,506                                        | 29\u00b716 |\n| 1875 | ...   | 38,949    | 631             | 2,286   | 2,662        | 5,604 | 40,092                                        | 19\u00b785 |\n| 1876 | ...   | 32,439    | 755             | 1,272   | 893          | 6,773 | 42,131                                        | 20\u00b786 |\n| 1877 | ...   | 36,329    | 58              | 1,441   | 4,285        | 8,179 |                                               | 23\u00b740 |\n\nThe number of deaths from small-pox will at once arrest attention. But that the Government vaccinators have not been idle will be seen from the\nfollowing figures:\u2014In 1873-74 as many as 6,912 out of 10,111 vaccine operations were successful; in 1874-75, 11,515 out of 16,027; 12,700 out of 15,956 in 1875-76; 19,584 out of 23,585 in 1876-77; and in 1877-78, 22,013 out of 24,711.\n\nThe following exhaustive list of indigenous medicines was supplied by the kindness of Dr. Prentis. It will be seen that many of them are familiar to the European as well as native pharmacopoeia:\n\n| Order | Scientific name | Vernacular name | Part used

He thinks that the district does not contain a single \"enlightened hakim.\" Turning from man to beast, he observes that though rot sometimes appears amongst the sheep, he has heard of no regular cattle-epidemic. Mr. Crooke adds, however, that rinderpest (*debi* or *debi k\u0101niks\u0101r*) is often imported into the district by cattle returning from the Tar\u00e1i pastures. Foot-and-mouth disease (*kh\u0101na*) is common and causes, if it occurs at agricultural seasons, great injury. The rot mentioned by Dr. Prentis is most frequent in the Gh\u00e1gra and R\u00e1pti valleys.\n\nWe close this portion of the notice with a sketch of the district history.\n\nThe legends of the traditional age which preceded the advent of the Muslims are as usual contradictory, absurd, and untrustworthy. But by the aid of other lights the following main points can be made out. The districts of Gorakhpur and Basti probably formed part of the ancient kingdom of Mah\u00e1-kosala.1 R\u00e1ma, who seems a not altogether mythical hero, is said to have passed some time in practising austerities near the junction of R\u00e1pti and Gh\u00e1gra in Gorakhpur. It was here that he received instruction from the sage Visvamitra; here that he in gratitude ceded the country north of Sarju to that sage's Kausik descendants. Some Brahmins of the district affirm, indeed, that the name Gorakhpur is a corruption of Gaurakshpur, denoting the country in\n\n1Buchanan's Eastern India (1838), p. 325.\nwhich R\u00e1ma tended the herds of cattle belonging to his uncle during a season of great drought at Ajudhya. Though undoubtedly wrong, the derivation is of some value as evidence in favour of the theory that the district was at one time a part of Mah\u00e1-kosala and an appanage of Ajudhya.\n\nBuchanan places the death of R\u00e1ma and first destruction of Ajudhya about 750, and the second destruction of that city about 512 years before Christ.\n\nThe birth of Buddha, S\u00e1kya Muni, or Gautama, took place, according to Gautama Buddha, circ. the best authorities, at some date between 600 and 550 B.C. 550 B.C. at Kap\u00edla; while his death occurred between 550 and 500 B.C. at Kusianagara, which General Cunningham has satisfactorily identified with Kasia in pargana Sidhua Jobna. From the accounts which we possess of his life and death, and from the description given of the country by Hwen Thsang, the Chinese traveller, it is certain that the country Bhar invasion. in the neighbourhood of Padrauna and Gorakhpur was one of the first localities in which the Buddhist doctrines gained general adherence, about 500 B.C. The next event in order of time Conquest by the Bhars, or Bhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas, circ. 500-450 B.C. is the traditional conquest of the district by the Bhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas.\n\nBuchanan asserts that, according to the people of Ajudhya, their city remained deserted from the date of its second destruction till the era of Vikram\u00e1ditya (57 B.C.) He quotes also other legends showing the spread of Buddhism down to Benares; the expulsion of the family of the Sun from that town; and the destruction of the same race at Ajudhya, and of the Lunar race at Magadha, by the Cher\u00fas. He adds a tradition, familiar in the district, An Aryan prince flies before them into this district. of theatre mpt made by some R\u00e1ja of one of these two races to establish himself near Rudarpur and found a new K\u00e1shi (Benares).\n\nHis account is much confused; but the local tradition clearly points to the fact that this R\u00e1ja came from Ajudhya after its second destruction (512 B.C.), and had very nearly succeeded in completing the walls of his new city. When, however, 999 out of the 1,000 projected temples had been built, he But is ejected. was overwhelmed and slain by the Bhars and other impure tribes.\n\nBuchanan alludes in the same passage to an invasion of Gurkhas, who, he says, were expelled by the Th\u00e1r\u00fas; and he seems to consider these last were Chinese. But the Gurkhas, as is well known, were not heard of till very much later.\n\n1 Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. II.; see also Gazetteer article on Kasia. 2 In pargana Silhat. Buchanan mentions that the place was then called Hansakshetra or Goefield, and gives the name of the prince as Vasishta Singu. 3 Probably not till the sixteenth century A.D. Supra p. 362\nAnd it is likely that they have been confused with the Cher\u00fas and Bhars, names which were probably synonymous.\\(^1\\) It is probable that on the first Aryan invasion these Bhars and Cher\u00fas fled for the refuge to the hills; and that their long residence in the mountains, before descending to reconquer the plains, may account for their confusion with Gurkhas. In a long article on the Bhars Mr. Sherring has plausibly proved that they once ruled a wide tract including the bulk of Gorakhpur and Basti, and extending to the foot of the Vindhyas in Mirzapur. Their present degraded status in no way disproves his theory, which is that the Bhars and other aboriginal tribes succeeded for a time in reconquering the Aryan invaders. The Bhars themselves say they came from the west, and the R\u00e9jbbhars claim connection with the Rajputs. But the latter pretension is easily explained by the desire of a conquered and utterly crushed people to give themselves more consequence in the eyes of their conquerors.\n\nThe only difficulty in identifying the Bhars with the aboriginal Cher\u00fas lies in the tradition which unites them with the Th\u00e1rus. The latter were either originally Hind\u00fas, or anciently Hinduized to a far greater extent than any other race we are acquainted with. Their tradition of descent from R\u00e9jputs of Chittor has been already noticed.\\(^2\\) They sometimes trace their lineage to Br\u00e1hmans who lost caste by mixing with the aborigines, drinking spirits, and eating flesh. But they also assert kinship with the Nep\u00e1l Br\u00e1hmans, whose rules have been relaxed somewhat similarly. While dismissing these theories as unlikely, Buchanan notices their pretension to be considered the real descendants of the Sun, who, dispossessed for a time by Gurkhas or impure tribes, recovered their kingdom after a short period of exile. It is not improbable that this last tradition may be founded on fact. The Th\u00e1rus may really, perhaps, represent the remnant of the old S\u00farajbansi invaders, who, unable to escape southwards from the Bhars, took refuge in Nep\u00e1l. They may have afterwards descended, and settling down amongst the conquerors, lost their caste distinctions. It may indeed be doubted if the strict rules regarding eating and other habits of life were in force at so early a date as that of the expulsion of the Aryans. The title Th\u00e1ru perhaps, as already noticed, records the servile condition of the tribe under Bhar rule.\\(^3\\)\n\nThe tradition which makes Th\u00e1rus leaders amongst the Bhars is easily explained by the closer connection between the former and the Aryans, and the unwillingness of later Aryan conquerors to allow that the Bhars were ever a nation strong enough to dispossess them of the country.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Buchanan seems to think that the Cher\u00fas represent a distinct and earlier wave of invasion than the Bhars. But Messrs. Sherring and C. A. Elliott (Chronicles of Unao) consider these races identical.\n\n\\(^2\\) Supra pp. 357-58.\n\n\\(^3\\) Ibid.\nThe Th\u00e1r\u00fas are said to have ruled the whole district with great splendour, and to have constructed castles all along the Gh\u00e1gra. But it is more convenient to suppose that they have been confounded with the Bhars, and to accept the common theory that the latter were the really predominant race of that day. Whatever the caste of the new rulers, the fact remains that, shortly after the rise of Buddhism, wild or aboriginal tribes succeeded in turning the tables on their civilized Aryan masters.\n\n\"When the Aryan race first settled in Ajudhya,\" writes Mr. C. A. Elliott, \"the natural resource of the aborigines was to fly to the hills or jungles. When the curtain next rises we find Ajudhya destroyed, the S\u00farajbansi banished, and a vast extent of country ruled over by aborigines called Cheru in the far east, Bhars in the centre, and R\u00e1jpusis in the west.\"\n\nThe history of Gorakhpur fits in exactly with this sketch. First we find it attached to Ajudhya as a vast pasture land for the cattle of the S\u00farajbansi or Solar princes; next, bestowed by R\u00e1ma on his spiritual instructor, Viswamitra; afterwards, garrisoned by one of the great chiefs of Ajudhya, who constructed the enormous fortified works near Rudarpur; lastly, annexed by a dynasty of Bhar kings, who expelled the S\u00farajbansi not only from Gorakhpur but also from Ajudhya and Magadha. These Bhars ruled in all probability for many generations.\n\nMr. Sherring believes that the aborigines rose and expelled the Aryans after the latter were weakened by the contest between Br\u00e1hmanism and Buddhism. It is not improbable that the conquering aborigines were themselves Buddhists or Jainas. We know that Jaina Th\u00e1r\u00fas established a dynasty elsewhere in the sub-Him\u00e1layan tract,\u00b9 and we know that a Buddhist S\u00fadra dynasty was about 350 B. C. established at Magadha.\n\nThe legend connecting the spread of Buddhism to Benares with the destruction of the families of the Sun and Moon is perhaps the story of the triumph of Buddhist Bhars or Cher\u00fas, over the Aryan invaders. The Buddhist remains noticed by Buchanan in the neighbourhood of Rudarpur may perhaps have been relics of a reoccupation by Buddhist aborigines.\n\nIt has been mentioned that the S\u00farajbansi founder of buildings in the same tract had fled eastwards before the Bhars from Ajudhya. This quite agrees with the legend of the Bhars themselves, that they came from the west. The date of their conquest may here be fixed at between 500 and 450 B. C. And they probably passed onwards to Magadha, where, according to Elphinstone,\n\n\u00b9Oudh Gazetteer, I, 111\nS\u00fadras established a dynasty about 400. The struggle between themselves and their Aryan masters must have lasted for many years.\n\nThe theory now advanced that Buddhism was the religion of the Bhars and other aboriginal or at least earlier races is supported by the fact that Gorakhpur and the country about it was certainly the tract first converted to the new faith; and was with equal certainty wrested from the Aryan conquerors by the Bhars about the time when the faith began to spread. About 250 B.C. we find the authority of Asoka, the great Buddhist S\u00fadra of Magadha, recognized not only in this district, but elsewhere north of the Narbada. Near Bh\u00e1galpur in parganah Salempur, is a pillar inscribed with his edicts; while at Kah\u00e1on, in the same parganah is a similar monument erected by some other Gupta king.\u00b9\n\nIf assumed to have conquered the district by 450 B.C., the Bhars must have held it for near a thousand years. The history of the reconquest by the Aryans seems to correspond with the legendary account of the revival of Brahmanism, known as the regeneration of the fire-races.\u00b2 But at its commencement we enter on the first stage of the historic period, and pass out of that which is merely traditional.\n\nThe first reinvasion seems to have been that of the R\u00e1thors, who, advancing from Kanauj about 550 A.D., expelled the Bhars from a tract on the east bank of the R\u00e1pti, from its mouth to near Gorakhpur. They are said to have established themselves in a fort near the R\u00e1mgarh lagoon; and legends represent them as living in amity with the Th\u00e1r\u00fas.\n\nThe Chinese traveller Hwen Thsang passed through the country about 635 A.D., but he makes no mention of the R\u00e1ja of Gorakhpur or of any other town of importance in its neighbourhood.\u00b3 He describes the country as filled with ruins of Buddhist convents and relic-temples, but says that it was for the most part desolate, overgrown with jungle and scoured by robbers.\n\nAbout 900-950 A.D., a R\u00e1ja called M\u00e1n Sen, or perhaps Madan Singh, was ruler of Gorakhpur (not then, however, known by this name). Buchanan\u2074 considers him to have been a Th\u00e1r\u00fa, but other traditions represent him as a R\u00e1thor. The difference\n\n\u00b9 Archaeological Survey Reports, vol. I.\n\u00b2 Marshman's History, vol. I, pp. 17-18.\n\u00b3 The earlier pilgrim Fa-Hian (circ. 400 A.D.) would appear to have visited Kasia, if not Rudarpur and other places in the district. For a map of his probable route see volume referred to in penultimate note.\n\u2074 Eastern India, vol. II., p. 343.\nmay perhaps be reconciled by the common story that the R\u00e1thors and Th\u00e1rus held the town together.\\(^1\\) He seems at all events to have been a real person. A large tank at Gorakhpur, called M\u00e1ns\u00e1war (M\u00e1n-s\u00e1g\u00e1r or M\u00e1n-sarovar) is ascribed to him; and a smaller one, named Kaul\u00e1da, to his wife Kaulavati. His wealth was widely celebrated and brought down on him an invasion by a tribe called both in the district and by Buchanan Domkat\u00e1rs, but who seem to be the same as the Donw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs mentioned by Oldham and Sherring.\\(^2\\) The exact origin of this tribe is not known, but there is no doubt that they were the descendants of Aryans who had intermarried with the aboriginal Doms (or Domras), and that they now fell on M\u00e1n Singh\u2019s capital and sacked it. They next proceeded to establish themselves in a very strong position to the east of the present town, and built a fort which was called after them Domangarh, and stood on a small island formed by the river Rohin.\n\nAfter them came the mixed Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r families, which seem to have been very common at this time. It appears, indeed, by no means improbable that up to about this period intermarriage between different races was not prohibited; and that all the strict rules relating to caste were introduced only when Brahmanism had again triumphed over the aboriginal tribes.\\(^3\\) It is at any rate almost certain that at this time the Brahmans allowed the R\u00e1jput chiefs who fought for them to marry into their families, and such alliances account for the R\u00e1jput titles Kausik, Donw\u00e1r, &c., by which Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r Brahmans have distinguished some of their sub-divisions.\\(^4\\) The license of intermarriage was in some cases, like that of the Donw\u00e1rs, extended to marriages with women captured from the impure aboriginal tribes.\n\nThe Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs invaded the district from the south, treading close on the heels of the Domkat\u00e1rs. The first family is said to have settled at H\u00e1rpur in Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, and to have been followed by that from which the R\u00e1jas of Majhauli are descended. The ancestor of this family, Maiur or Mayyura, is called a descendant of the Brahman P\u00e1rasr\u00e1m (Parasur\u00e1ma). But by other traditions he is styled both a R\u00e1jput and a Bh\u00e1t. He is supposed to have married four wives of different castes, and from one of these, a R\u00e1jputni, Bissu Sen, the founder of the Bissen R\u00e1jputs was born.\n\n\\(^1\\) It would also confirm the theory that Th\u00e1rus are descended from the Solar race, and therefore closely connected with R\u00e1thors. \\(^2\\) See Sherring\u2019s Castes, page 238. The difference there noticed as made by Dr. Oldham between the Donw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs and Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs is strong evidence in favour of the identity of the former with Domkat\u00e1rs. \\(^3\\) See a note on castes by Mr. Growne, published in the Census Report of 1872. \\(^4\\) See Mr. Oldham\u2019s Memoir of Gh\u00e1zipur.\nBissu Sen established himself at Nawapur, now Salempur, and soon rose into importance as one of the most powerful chiefs in this part of the country. His date is fixed at about 1100 A.D. Between his territory and that of the Domkatars or Domwars there was a broad tract of jungle which prevented their coming into collision. The Bhars still retained possession of the west of the district, and continued to hold Amorha in Basti till the time of Akbar, who granted it to the Jaipur princess, his wife. Her relations expelled then from this last stronghold and founded the Amorha Raj out of their possessions.\n\nAbout 1350 A.D., the Rajput chiefs who had been expelled by the Muslim invaders began to enter the district. One of the first of these was Dhur Chand, who claimed descent from one Raja Kausik, uncle of Visramitra. The legend which made Rama grant Sarjupur to that saint's descendants was now turned to advantage. That legend as given by Elliot relates that Rama, having promised to Visramitra as much land as his arrow could cover in its flight, drew his bow on the banks of the Sarju, and sped a shaft which fell at the foot of the hills. The tract thus bestowed was called Sarjupur or Sarwar, i.e. \"beyond Sarju.\" The exact site of the Ghadipur from which Dhur Chand's ancestors are said to have travelled is unknown.\n\nAll that can be said with certainty is that a Kausik Rajput invaded the district from the south and established himself in the tract of country called after him, Dhuriapar. The Bhars he is said to have conquered with ease, and the Bhuinhars of Harpur with difficulty. Before his death he had acquired considerable power, and his sons are said to have been allies of the Sharki kings of Jaunpur (1394-1457).\n\nAbout the same time the founder of Satasi Raj, Chandra Sen, appeared in the west of the district. He was a Sarnet Rajput to whom tradition assigns a small domain near Lahr. Offending an emperor of Dehli, he was pardoned only at the intercession of a Brahman from this district. On his release he accompanied the Brahman eastward, and after many adventures reached the Kuana river in this district.\n\n---\n\n1 See Mr. P. White's Settlement Report, Amorha.\n2 Races of the North-Western Provinces, vol. I., p. 50, where the story is told regarding a grant to the Sarwaria Brahmana.\n3 Elliot thinks it was part of Kanauj, p. 157.\n4 In his Bansri report Mr. Wyone puts the foundation of the Satasi Raj at 1144 A.D. Mr. Alexander thinks this date too early, and adds that Sen is merely a local pronunciation of the Rajput suffix Sinh or Singh.\n5 The name of his birthplace was Srinagar, but its exact location is uncertain.\n6 Why a Muslim emperor should have heeded the intercession of a Gorakhpur Brahman the legend does not explain. The intercessor is said to have lived near Salempur Majhanti, and some impoverished Brahmans in the district still claim descent from him.\nHere he established himself and began to extend his authority eastwards. In so doing he became involved in hostilities with the Domkatar (or Donw\u00e1r) chiefs.\n\nThey were on the point of compelling him to quit the district and seek his fortunes elsewhere, when his Brahman adviser suggested a stratagem which proved completely successful. Chandra Sen, being a pure R\u00e1jput, was deemed somewhat superior to the Domw\u00e1rs, who had intermarried with both Doms and Bhars. He now therefore proposed to wed his daughter to the son of the principal Donw\u00e1r chief, on condition of being allowed to retain a part of the country he had invaded. His proposal was gladly accepted. Immense preparations were made, and Chandra Sen gained admittance to the Domin-garh fort with a large body of followers. Then seizing his opportunity he treacherously murdered the Domkat\u00e1r chiefs, while his followers outside slaughtered as many of the beguiled clan as could be found. The power of the Donw\u00e1r\u00e1s was crippled by this blow, and Chandra Sen became one of the most powerful chiefs in the district.\n\nThe victims of his treachery fled in many cases to the north, where their descendants still flourish. During the same century (1300-1400) the B\u00fatwal R\u00e1j was founded by an adventurer whom his descendants represented as a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput. They used to say that he escaped from the siege of Chittaur in 1303, that his name was Makhund Singh, and that he at one time had great power. The truth of this story is, however, doubtful. Had he escaped from Chittaur, he would have been a Gahlot rather than a Chauh\u00e1n.\n\nHis descendants never maintained the position of pure R\u00e1jputs, but intermarried with the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. They never, moreover, possessed much authority within the present district of Gorakhpur. Being cut off from the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas by a wide tract of forest, they did not come into collision with those chiefs till much later. With the B\u00e1nsi branch of the Sat\u00e1si house they, however, carried on a long struggle, which reduced the border country to a state of utter desolation, and resulted at last in the defeat of the B\u00e1nsi family.\n\nThe establishment of the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1j marks that period in the history of the district when the invasions from the south began to cease. A few petty chieftains made conquests in the east of the district. But the power of the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Majhauli R\u00e1jas checked the stream of invasion from the south, whilst\nthe troubles in which the kings of Dshli were involved prevented the Muham-\nmadans from making any vigorous effort to subjugate the district.\n\nChandra Sen had prudently connected himself by marriage with the Ma-\njhauli R\u00e1ja, and thus averted invasion from that quarter till he had secured his\nposition. After his death his three grandsons divided his possessions. The eldest,\nOrigin of the name Sat\u00e1si. Jagdhar, took the eastern portion, extending over a\ncircuit of 84 kos and including a considerable extent\nof land on the east of the R\u00e1pti. The circuit of his territory was soon extended\nto 87 kos, and from this fact his R\u00e1j was known as the Sat\u00e1si.\n\nThe second grandson, J\u00e1i, settled at Maghar, and is said to have held lands with\na circuit of 42 kos. He was the founder of what afterwards became the B\u00e1nsi R\u00e1j.\n\nThe third, Randh\u00edr, occupied Anola, south-west of Gorakhpur, with a\nboundary line of 21 kos. The residence of the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas was at first a\nfort on the R\u00e1mgarh jh\u00fal. The site is still pointed out, but no traces of the\nbuilding remain. The first hundred years of their dynasty are noticeable for\na war which they carried on with the Mujhauli R\u00e1ja regarding a tract of land\nnear Rudarpur, and for the birth of Gorakhn\u00e1th.\n\nThe war continued with brief intervals of peace for three generations, and\nended in the occupation of the disputed tract by the\n1350-1450. War between\nthe Sat\u00e1si and Majhauli\nR\u00e1jas. R\u00e1ja of Majhauli. As consolation the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas\nsucceeded in wresting a small tract of country from the\nDhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r family. It is probable, however, that this tract had previously been\ntaken from the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1j during the struggle between them and Majhauli.\nIt was about this time that the celebrated Gorakhn\u00e1th flourished, and that the\ntown of Gorakhpur was founded.\n\nRegarding the life of Gorakhn\u00e1th there are hardly any authentic details.\n\nGorakhn\u00e1th, circ. 1400 His name is said to have originally been Matsyendra\nA.D. or Machhendran\u00e1th, and he lived as the pupil of a\nHindu Gos\u00e1in in the jungles near Ras\u00falpur. He discovered at the site of\nthe present temple a shrine sacred to the god Gurakh or Gorakh, who\nappears to have been a deity of great fame in the Nep\u00e1l country; and having\ndevoted himself to the service of this deity, practised the greatest austerities. He\nobtained a character for peculiar sanctity and took the name of Gorakhn\u00e1th or\nservant of Gorakh.\n\nShortly after his death a quarrel in the Sat\u00e1si family induced some of its\nmembers to leave the R\u00e1mgarh castle and establish\nFoundation of the pre-\nsent town of Gorakhpur. themselves near the shrine, from which the town they\nfounded took its name of Gorakhpur. Beyond the resemblance of sound, there\n\n1 Other accounts, however, represent him as but a friend of Machhendarn\u00e1th. See Elliot's\nGlossary, art. Harbong-ka-r\u00e1j.\nis not much to connect Gorakhpur and Gorakhnath with the Gurkhas. As already mentioned, the latter derive their name from a town named Gurkha.\n\nAccession of Hoal Singh. About 1,400 A.D. the Satasi Raja died childless, and Hoal Singh, whom he had adopted from the Anola family, was declared Raja. It is not improbable that this event had something to do with the quarrel just noticed.\n\nAbout the condition at this period of eastern Gorakhpur little or nothing is known. When Buddha died, towns of some size must have flourished in this part of the country. The names of one or two, such as Kusianagara (Kasia) and Pawa (Padrauna) are still preserved. But when Huen Thsang visited these places they were in ruins. In the beginning of the fifteenth century the south of the modern parganah Sidhua Jobna and the greater part of parganah Shahjahanpur are mentioned as attached to the dominions of one Mardan or Madan Sen, who appears to have been a chief of considerable power. The accounts left of him are too vague to identify this chief. But it is not impossible that he was the Raja of Saran and Champaran who gave the Muhammadan deputies of those parts so much trouble. Though a Rajput and a personage of much later date, he is very commonly confused with the Madan Singh whom the Domwars ousted in the tenth century.\n\nAt the close of the fifteenth, the district was therefore divided as follows:\n\nDivisions of the district at the close of the fifteenth century. The south-east, parganahs Salempur and Silhat, was held by the Bisen Rajas of Majhuli. The Kausik descendants of Dhur Chand occupied the south-west\u2014that is parganah Dhuriapar and its neighbourhood. The Sarnet Rajas of Satasi and Anola ruled the centre and west for some 20 miles north and east of Gorakhpur, as well as southwards along the right bank of the Rapti. Further east of this was Madan Singh, whose territory could, however, have included little of this district. North of the Satasi country was a vast forest which furnished hunting-grounds for the Raja. In the extreme north-west was the Butwal Raj; while the northeast was probably an uninhabited jungle. Beyond the limits of the present district, to the west of Anola, lay the domains of the Sarnet Raja of Maghar.\n\nAll these Rajas were quite independent of each other, and within their several territories had sovereign power. They and their kinsmen appear to have lived on the produce of their lands, careless of the world beyond their borders. With their neighbours they had little intercourse, except in the case of an occasional boundary dispute. No traditions, no remains of roads or bridges, testify to any commerce or connection with the neighbouring districts. The history of the country after\nthe fall of the Bhars is in fact merely that of the rise and fall of a number of separate families. There is no trace of any national bond of union between the Hindu invaders,\\(^1\\) or of any assimilation between them and the people they displaced. A small body of fellow-clansmen would eject the aborigines and settle down on a fertile tract large enough to support them. They would in turn be ejected or exterminated by some fresh tribe of invaders, who seldom cared to extend their conquest further than food requirements demanded.\n\nIt seems probable that between the downfall of Buddhism and the invasion of Domkat\u00e1rs and Bisens, the bulk of the district after the fall of Bhars had become uninhabited. As noted by General Sleeman in Oudh, jungle soon springs up on land which in these parts once falls out of cultivation. With the jungle come wild beasts and malaria; and it soon becomes extremely hard to reclaim. What, therefore, more likely than that the country, when laid waste by war between the R\u00e1thors and Bhars, should become a forest, broken only by the narrow clearings on which nomad aborigines grew their scanty meals. The invaders who first repeopled the district would naturally settle down in these clearings, knowing nothing of their neighbours, until extension of tillage removed the forest curtain and brought them into contact with one another.\n\nInformation regarding the extent to which the Muhammadans invaded and subdued the district is exceedingly meagre and unsatisfactory till quite recent times. The best authorities almost entirely ignore Gorakhpur, and the local traditions deal only with the semi-miraculous exploits of a few favoured individuals. The fact appears to be that the district was one of those in which the Muslims really interfered very little. Its Hindu R\u00e1jas remained independent in all but name until the time of the Naw\u00e1bs of Oudh.\n\nThe first mention of the Muhammadans is almost fabulous. Dh\u00far Chand is said to have fled before the Muhammadan force under S\u00e1l\u00e1r-i-Masa\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi. The date of this precocious hero is here fixed 300 years later than in Rohilkhand, or at about 1330 A. D.\\(^2\\) The sons or grandsons of the same R\u00e1ja are said (1399) to have sent an envoy with gifts to Tim\u00far; but as Tim\u00far never came nearer than Bijnor, it is doubtful if they ever reached his fleeting camp. The struggles that followed between the Jaunpur and Dehli kings, and the wildness and poverty of the district, protected it for some time longer.\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Common ancestry formed a land of union between the Anola, Maghar, and Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1jas, but they must be considered as exceptions. Even between them there was after the first century little intercourse.\n\n\\(^2\\) Some account of S\u00e1l\u00e1r-i-Masa\u00fad is given in Gazetteer, II, 77, and V, 90. Granted his existence, it is doubtful whether he ever penetrated further down-country than Bahraich. But he is here credited with the foundation of Gh\u00e1sipur.\nlegends which describe the wealth and grandeur of such chiefs as M\u00e1n Singh must be deemed exaggerations. The R\u00e1jas in the south of the district seem to have professed a kind of submission to the Sharki kings of Jaunpur (1394-1476), but they neither paid tribute nor furnished a vassal contingent.\n\nBahlol Lodi (1450-88) sent a force up as far as the Gh\u00e1gra, but did not cross it; and the struggle (1535-40) between Hum\u00e1-y\u00fan and Sher Sh\u00e1h seems to have prevented either from turning his attention to the conquest of the country. The descendants of Dh\u00far Chand are said to have sent an envoy to B\u00e1bar (1526), and to have been honoured in return with the title of his \"faithful allies.\" But this seems a mere repetition of the tale about T\u00edm\u00far; and until the reign of Akbar, who included the district in the province of Oudh, Gorakhpur would seem to have remained almost an unknown land.\n\nOn his rebellion against Akbar (1564) Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n seems for some time to have established himself on the Gh\u00e1gra, crossing over when pressed by the Emperor's forces, and taking refuge in the jungle which lined the bank. A royal force was sent over to secure him, and fruitlessly searched through the forest. But meanwhile Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n had escaped to the hills.\n\nThis was the first historical invasion of Gorakhpur or Basti by a Muslim force. After the defeat and death of Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n (1567), a fellow-rebel named Sikandar Kh\u00e1n, who is described as a kinsman of the usurper Sher Sh\u00e1h, fled across the Gh\u00e1gra into this district. He was pursued by the officers of Akbar; but when they arrived at Gorakhpur, they discovered he had crossed the Gandak into territory still held by the Afgh\u00e1n chiefs of Bengal; and after waiting some time for orders, the force was recalled to Agra.\n\nLocal traditions assert that it numbered over a hundred thousand fighting men, and was led by a general called Fid\u00e1\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n. Entering the west of Basti, it marched through that district into this. During its stay at Gorakhpur the Dhuri\u00e1j\u00e1r R\u00e1ja, who readily professed submission, and perhaps pleaded that his ancestors were the faithful allies of Tim\u00far or Babar, was not interfered with.\n\nBut the R\u00e1ja of Majhauli, by opposing the scouts sent to search for Sikandar, incurred the resentment of the invaders. He seems at first to have offered a determined resistance, but was speedily convinced of its futility. He not only submitted, but turned\n\n---\n\n1 Tabak\u00fat-i Akbar\u00ed; Dowson's edition of Elliot's Historians, V., 307. 2 He was probably the same Sikandar as deposed by Hum\u00e1-y\u00fan from the throne of Dehli and who submitted to Akbar in 1556. The Tabak\u00fat-i Akbar\u00ed (Elliot, V., 320) describes him as again breaking his engagements. 3 Tabak\u00fat, Elliot, 324; the first mention of Gorakhpur in the chronicles.\nMusalm\u00e1n. Legend relates that with this army was a holy man named Salem Sh\u00e1h, who had foretold the birth of Akbar's son Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr. He was now rewarded by a grant of land opposite to Naw\u00e1pur, and placed under the special protection of the R\u00e1ja. In his honour the R\u00e1ja named the new town which grew up round his residence Salempur, a title which was afterwards prefixed to that of its enclosing parganah Majhauli. As, however, the R\u00e1ja on his conversion assumed the title of Isl\u00e1m Kh\u00e1n, it is not improbable that the town and pargana are named after him.\u00b9 Majhauli itself seems equivalent in meaning to the English Middleton.\n\nAfter reducing Naw\u00e1pur, the army probably marched up the left bank of the R\u00e1pti and entered the Sat\u00e1si territory. The Sat\u00e1si family driven out of Gorakhpur since 1570 R\u00e1ja resisted the invasion and was worsted. Refusing conversion, he was expelled the district. His family removed to Gajpur, in parganah Bha\u00fap\u00e1r, where they afterwards came to terms. Fid\u00e1\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n, however, occupied Gorakhpur, where he is said to have built a large tank in order to supply his camp. The tank was perhaps dug to provide earth for an entrenchment or employment for the troops; but the neighbourhood of the R\u00e1pti renders the necessity for any fresh-water supply unlikely. The R\u00e1ja of Maghar was also attacked and compelled to declare himself tributary.\u00b2 With the exception of the north and east, the whole district thus became, in name at least, subject to the Emperor. In the west, however, some portion was still held by the Bhars; and this tract was now given by Akbar to the Kachhw\u00e1ha kinsmen of his wife, the princess of Jaipur. After a severe struggle they, partly by treachery and partly by strength of arms, ejected the Bhars and established themselves in Amorha. On quitting the district, the imperial army seems to have left garrisons at Gorakhpur and Maghar. Meanwhile (1577-92) Akbar was busy in crushing the Afgh\u00e1ns of Bengal, and their defeat by him gave an opportunity to the Majhauli R\u00e1ja of seizing on the country held by the descendants of Madan or Mardan Singh, who was probably tributary to the Afgh\u00e1n princes.\n\n\u00b9 The legend as to the period of Majhauli's conversion is here given for what it may be worth; but Mr. Crooke's researches tend to show that that conversion really occurred much later. The renegade R\u00e1ja, Boddh Mal, was the fifth predecessor of the present. Existing deeds by this Boddh and his son Bhawani are dated 1767-68 and 1778-79 (1175 and 1186 fa\u0161l) respectively; so that the death of the former may be fixed at a little more than 100 years ago. The appearance of his tomb, which stands on the Little Gandak between Salempur and Majhauli, points to the same conclusion. It seems that, being in arrear for his tribute, Boddh was summoned to Dehli and there converted. On his return his relations refused to receive him at Majhauli, and he lived at Salempur till his death. Meanwhile his orthodox son Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed was raised to the cushion.\u00b2 Not, however, before he had been driven from Maghar to B\u00e1ni. From the latter place his descendants still take their title.\nTradition declares that the R\u00e1ja or chief who was then head of the family owed his ruin to the curse of the goddess Devi, whose priest he had vainly commanded to visibly reveal her. His fall was really due to a dispute between his dependents and those of the Salempur R\u00e1ja, who marching against him with a large army defeated and slew him. As usual, the victory was followed by the extirpation of the conquered family, and their dominions were parcellled out amongst the victors' retainers or relations. The tal\u00fakas of R\u00e1mkola, B\u00e1ns\u00e1g\u00f3n, Parw\u00e1rp\u00e1r, and others, since broken up or absorbed in Padrauna and Tamk\u00fahi, owe their origin to grants made at this time.\n\nBuchanan's statement that the vanquished family were Th\u00e1r\u00fas,\u00b9 and their chief's alleged contempt for Devi, receive some corroboration from another legend which describes the image at Kasia as the wicked chief himself. It is just possible that, in spite of their R\u00e1jput origin, they may have kept up the temples and statues of Buddha still traceable around that town.\n\nA little later, the succession to the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r principality was fiercely disputed between two of Dh\u00far Chand's descendants, Badr and Pirthi. The R\u00e1j, as is not uncommonly the case in this country, did not necessarily descend to the eldest son. One son inherited, the others being in the position of mere dependents, receiving food and clothing from their luckier brother. In this case both claimants were powerfully supported, and the result was a violent struggle. It ended, as we shall hereafter see, in the division of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r between the combatants. Its immediate consequence was the plunder of both parties by their neighbours. The first to take advantage of the struggle was B\u00e1bu Bern\u00e1th Singh of Semara, a kinsman of the Majhauli R\u00e1ja. He succeeded in crossing the R\u00e1pti and annexing two tappas of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, corresponding roughly with what is now called Chill\u00fap\u00e1r. Establishing himself at N\u00e1harpur, he assumed the title of R\u00e1ja. Another chief, R\u00e1ja Ho\u00e1l Singh of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, is said to have helped himself to ten more tappas of the disputed tract. As Ho\u00e1l probably lived some two centuries before the quarrel, it is more likely that the robber was one of his descendants. But by one annexation or another Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r lost during this civil war 16 out of its 40 tappas.\n\nMeanwhile the progress of events in the Basti district, though not perhaps properly within the scope of this Memoir, claims attention. The two districts are so closely united in their history that it is impossible to explain events clearly in one without touching on the history of the other.\n\n\u00b9 The assertion that they were Th\u00e1r\u00fas is clearly due to a confusion between Madan Singh I, or M\u00e1n Sen, and Madan Singh II.\nIt has already been mentioned that the Bhars were at this time expelled from Amorha by the Kachhwahas or their dependents.\n\nThe first Raja of Amorha was, however, not a Kachhwaha, but a Kayasth favourite of Akbar's Kachhwahin wife. Jagat Singh appears to have accompanied Fidae Khan's army to Maghar. There his aid was invoked by the Brahman Bidyadhar, who wished to prevent a forced marriage between the Bhar chief Maniar and a Brahman's daughter. After treacherously gaining the confidence of the Bhar, Jagat intoxicated and slew him during a festival, with the aid of Bidyadhar. For this meritorious act his family is said to have received the sacred thread. They at all events, under colour of the real or pretended grant to their mistress, established themselves in Amorha.\n\nA Rajput connected with the Udaipur family, and therefore a Sisodiya Gahlot, was with Jagdeo at the time of the murder, assisting in both it and the subsequent struggle with the Bhars. In consideration of his services he received the eastern portion of the conquered tract, and established himself at Nagar. The ousted Bhars took refuge in the extreme north of the district, where they are said to have founded the Katahla Raj.\n\nIn 1610, Gorakhpur, which appears to have been looked on as a tributary province, was bestowed by Jahangir as a fief on Afzal Khan, governor of Patna. The troubles, however, which soon afterwards beset the Dehli empire rendered the Muhammadan hold on Gorakhpur insecure. The garrison was small, and its commandant had incurred odium by some petty act of tyranny.\n\nTaking advantage of these circumstances, Raja Basant Singh of Satasi, a descendant of Hoal Singh, raised forces and expelled it. He then established himself in a fort on a site now occupied by the Basantpur quarter. At the same time, or soon after, the Raja of Maghar or Banshi expelled the imperial garrison from the former place, and almost all the local Rajas withheld payment of tribute.\n\nDuring Shahjahans reign (1628-58) the Muhammadans were too busy in the Dakkhan to turn their attention to this part of the country, and no occupation of this district by them is recorded. But on the accession of Aurangzeb (1658) and establishment of his power their influence revived. About 1680, Kazi Khalil-ur-Rahman was created chakladar of the Gorakhpur government, and marching from Faizabad quickly made his power felt. The new Rajas of Amorha and Nagar submitted promptly, and were therefore not much molested. But Maghar was occupied by a strong force, and the Raja\nwas for some time at least deprived of the government of the country south of his capital, which he now established at B\u00e2nsi. Kh\u00e2filabad was about this time built, and through it a road was made from Faiz\u00e1b\u00e2d to Gorakhpur. Basant\u2019s son, Rudar Singh, was expelled from the latter town, taking up his abode in pargana Silhat, near the spot where the ancient S\u00fbrajbansi R\u00e2ja was said to have founded his new K\u00e2sh. Here he fortified himself strongly; and the Muhammadans, having other matters to attend to, appear again to have accepted a nominal submission and a promise to pay tribute. The town which grew up round his fort was called in his honour Rudarpur, and is now one of the largest places in the district.\n\nThe Musalm\u00eens seem, however, to have taken on this occasion more efficient means of retaining their position. They repaired Basant Singh\u2019s fort at Gorakhpur, making it a really strong place; and they left an officer with a numerous garrison in charge of the town.\n\nFrom this date\u2014that is from about the end of the seventeenth century\u2014the tribute which the R\u00e1jas had nominally promised to Akbar was collected with some regularity. But the Muhammadans never assumed the government in the same direct manner as the British. The independent position of the R\u00e1jas is strongly brought out by Mr. Wynne in his settlement reports. He notes that they held not as mere middlemen, nor even as mere representatives of the central authority (sark\u00e1r), but as that central authority itself. \u201cIt was they who assigned lands and honours, although the confirmation of the Emperor at Dehli might be solicited whenever the position attained by the grantee was so conspicuous as to draw attention to him. Almost the whole of the subordinate tenures in the district (and before our rule they contained the greater portion of it) are derived from grants which they make in their own names, and not merely permissively as agents of the Dehli or Oudh families.\u201d\n\nBefore going further into this subject, we should notice a visit paid to the district towards the close of the seventeenth century by the Emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e2h, then Prince Muazzim. He was attracted to Gorakhpur by accounts of its wonderful sport; and to him is ascribed the cathedral mosque (J\u00e2mi Masjid) at its capital. In his honour a division newly formed from sark\u00e2rs Gorakhpur and S\u00e2ran, with headquarters at Gorakhpur, was named Muazzimabad; and by this title the districts of Gorakhpur and Basti are mentioned in all official records from this date to that of the cession (1801).\nPrince Muazzim's visit may have strengthened the hold on this district of his dynasty. But, before the establishment of the government of the Vazirs at Lucknow, the real masters of the district were the Rajas. The imperial officers at the head of the division were quite content to accept an almost nominal submission from the local potentates; but the Nawabs of Oudh, who lived nearer and had more leisure, attempted a more systematic and scrutinising form of\n\nGreater influence of the government. The settlement of the dispute between Nawab Vazir and the rival claimants in Dhuriapar is the first sign of the change. The 'parganah' (which is then first mentioned under this designation) was divided into two equal portions. The descendants of Bhadr Singh settled to the west at Barhiapar, and Pirthi Singh's descendants to the east at Gopipur. The amil or prefect is said to have marked out the boundary between them, and to have been the chief agent in settling the dispute. As this took place about 1700-50, it is reasonable to connect it with the appointment of Saadat Khan as Viceroy of Oudh in 1721. It will be remembered that the Oudh province (Suba) had, since the reign of Akbar, included Gorakhpur. Being a man of energy, Saadat soon succeeding in becoming virtually independent of the weakening Delhi empire. He firmly established his rule in the province, reduced the power of the Rajas, and, in the south of the district at least exacted their tribute with regularity. In the north, owing probably to its difficulty of access, or its uninviting poverty, his authority was never so surely introduced. But soon after the division of Dhuriapar, a quarrel in the B\u00fatwal family and the assumption by Tilak Sen of independent authority obliged the Nawab to march a force into this part of the country.\n\nTilak Sen was head of the younger branch of the B\u00fatwal family, which, expelling the Th\u00e1r\u00fas from Tilpur, had for some time held it of the elder branch. He now rejected the suzerainty of his cousin, and declared himself an independent Raja. The chief instrument of his ambition was the aid of the Banj\u00e1ras, who now began to make occasional inroads from the west. In this turbulent and restless race he found useful and willing mercenaries. If his date was really rather later than that here given, these Banj\u00e1ras were perhaps fugitives driven before the Rohillas from Pilibhit and Khairagarh. Tradition asserts, that to shade their camping-grounds, they planted most of the mango-groves in the west and south of the district.\n\nThe name of Tilpur was long anterior to that of this particular Tilak; but Tilak Sen was probably a common title in the family.\nIt is certain that owing to their inroads that district declined in prosperity, for they pillaged and destroyed without attempting to colonize and recultivate the country. Much of the jungle south-east of Gorakhpur is said to have sprung up at this time; and the lawlessness they carried with them infected the Muhammadan garrison at Gorakhpur, who arose and re-opened the old quarrel with the Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1ja. About 1750 A.D. the state of affairs called urgently for interference, and the Naw\u00e1b accordingly marched a large army into the district under Ali K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n.\n\nThis army first reduced the turbulent Muhammaans to order, razing a stronghold which their leaders had constructed on the old site of the Domangarh castle. It then marched north, routed a force brought against it by Tilak Sen\u2019s son, and invaded the B\u00fatwal territories to recover arrears of tribute. But a tough struggle was required before the R\u00e1ja even nominally submitted; and peace was restored by compromise nearly twenty years later, when the B\u00fatwal R\u00e1ja seems to have paid the Naw\u00e1b a personal visit and arranged terms. After the subjection of Tilak Sen\u2019s son, the country he had held was annexed to B\u00fatwal. No attempt was apparently made to conduct its government through Muhammadan officials, and tribute was only nominally levied.\n\nIn Gorakhpur, however, a large force was established, and it was probably about this time that the Muhammadan rule was strongest and most distinctly felt. Owing to the absence of written chronicles and the indifference of natives to the past history of the district, it is extremely difficult to ascertain the exact character of this rule, and the extent to which it interfered with the powers and prerogatives of the local R\u00e1jas. Certain, however, that it did not even profess to provide its subjects with police and protection. It is extremely doubtful if, except at Gorakhpur itself, there were any courts of justice. The people trusted to themselves and their R\u00e1jas for protection against robbers and marauders, such as the Banj\u00e1ras.\n\nThe parganah divisions of the Muhammadans survive, but only because they corresponded pretty closely with domains known before as those of the various R\u00e1jas or their creatures. The Muhammadan name of the town and district, Muazzimabad, is unknown to the common people; and the government seems to have been at best an imperfect machinery for collecting revenue. The fact that hardly any place of note bears a Muhammadan name, and the scarcity of mosques or other Muhammadan buildings, show\nthe fleeting nature of even the Naw\u00e1b Vazir's mark on the district. Even in Gor\u00e1khpur itself\u2014a town which they undoubtedly held for some time\u2014the traces of the Muslim governors are but scarce and faint compared to those of the Hindu kings and saints whom they nominally conquered. Isl\u00e1m itself is probably nowhere else so strongly coloured by Hindu ideas and usages, and in few places have the two sects so closely united as in Gor\u00e1khpur.\n\nAll evidence in short tends to show that the position occupied by the Hindu R\u00e1jas tributaries, Hindu R\u00e1jas of the district had up to this time been not subjects, that rather of tributaries than of subjects. In his B\u00e1nsi report Mr. Wynne writes that, \"throughout, the authority of the local R\u00e1jas was sufficient to counterbalance, if not to overcome, that of the chaklad\u00e1r (or representative of the central government at Lucknow). The k\u00e1n\u00fangos appointed by the latter were, till a few years before the cession, regularly expelled, and the revenue they were sent to collect was as often withheld as paid. The right of private war was exercised without question. Occasionally the chaklad\u00e1r was able to collect revenue from the tenants direct; but in general such sums as were realised at all were paid through the R\u00e1jas.\"\n\nUnder these circumstances, it would appear natural that when the Battle of Buxar (Baksar), Naw\u00e1b's power was weakened by the battle of Baksar, 1784 A.D. the local R\u00e1jas would have thrown off the yoke and expelled the underlings who were no longer supported by his army. The result was, however, just the reverse. At no period prior to the cession does the authority of the R\u00e1jas seem to have been so weak, and the power of the delegates from Lucknow so strong, as at this. Not only did the notorious Major Hannay exercise an almost supreme power over the south of the district as the Viceroy's commander-in-chief, but the prefects and their subalterns also acquired an influence which they had never before possessed.\n\nUp to this time no regular system of collection seems to have worked, except in the south of the district. The power and the nominal submission of the local R\u00e1jas had enabled them to maintain their government by merely paying a kind of tribute. Even Sa\u00e1dat Khan seems merely to have enforced payment of this tribute, and to have left the government and the collection of rents to the R\u00e1jas. In other districts there was a regular system, under which a graded series of officers were appointed to make collections from the persons in\npossession of the land. This was extended to Azamgarh, but in Gorakhpur struck no root. It seems to have been as follows:\n\nAn officer called chaklad\u00e1r was appointed to the charge of a chakla or tract rather larger than a modern district, and under him were officers called \u00e1mils, who held a smaller division, about the size of a tahsili. Below these were k\u00e1n\u00fangos, who were supposed to keep the entire accounts of a tract about the size of a pargana, and to supply all the information necessary for the realization of a fair revenue from the persons holding cultivated land within it. Besides these was a semi-military officer called the n\u00e1zm, who seems to have been employed in coercing contumacious defaulters and protecting treasure; and beneath him were several deputies (n\u00e1ib-n\u00e1zm) who carried out these duties under his orders.\n\nBut, as before noticed, the system could not work in a country where a swarm of local potentates had each sufficient power to hold the k\u00e1n\u00fangos and even the \u00e1mils in contempt, and to counterbalance all the influence and strength of the chaklad\u00e1r himself. The k\u00e1n\u00fangos were expelled, and the \u00e1mils soon arrived at the plan of bargaining with the local R\u00e1jas for the payment of a certain sum in return for absolute non-interference. This system very soon passed into one of farming. The office of chaklad\u00e1r as at first instituted was abolished, and under the title of custom of farming the revenues, the local R\u00e1ja, if he was strong enough, or some publican from Oudh, if he was not, took a contract for collecting the revenues. The term of his lease was one, three, or five years, and a regular counterpart (k\u00e1l\u00e9tyat) for the sum to be paid, as well as a large amount in advance, was handed over to the viceroy.\n\nWhen a R\u00e1ja was weakened by a war with his neighbours or other causes, varying power of the farmers, the farm of his domains would be bought for a large sum by some powerful noble or professional farmer, who seized the opportunity of making his collections direct from the R\u00e1ja's dependants and tenants. And when the R\u00e1ja recovered his strength, he would either agree to take the farm himself, or to buy out the interloping farmer by guaranteeing him a certain profit on his engagement. Not unfrequently the matter was solved by the farmers taking a large compensation from the R\u00e1ja and disappearing with it, leaving the viceroy to realize the revenue as best he could. In such cases it was seldom realized at all, as this course was only adopted when the Naw\u00e1b's difficulties prevented the pursuit and punishment of the defaulter.\n\nThe Lucknow revenues, so far as drawn from this district, were indeed very precarious. A few tappas lying along the Gh\u00e1gra and for several miles\nup the banks of the Rapti were, as Mr. Reade mentions, held directly by Musalman delegates. Their great fertility, and their accessibility from the headquarters of the chaklad\u00e1r at Azamgarh, ensured the proper collection of their income. But in other parts of the district fealty to the Oudh Government was merely verbal, and revenues were paid only when coercion became imminent.\n\nThus were affairs conducted till within thirty years of the cession to the British. But in that short space of time occurred changes which completely altered the administration and delivered the country to a reign of exaction and misrule which unpeopled and well nigh ruined it.\n\nAs before mentioned, the Banj\u00e1ras first attracted attention about 1720-30. Thirty years later we find them a veritable scourge and terror in the district. They seem to have formed a number of separate bands under various n\u00e1iks or leaders, but frequently united to resist a powerful enemy like the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi.\n\nTheir object was almost always plunder; and the centre and east of the district, where great forests afforded an ample refuge, formed at first their base of operations. The east was, moreover, better adapted to their plans, because since the downfall of Madan Singh no power nearer than that of Majhauli could venture to repress them. And to this day the memory of their violence and cruelties lives fresh in this part of the district. But as plunder and success increased their strength, they began to take an active part in the politics of the district. They fomented quarrels between the Misery caused by them. R\u00e1jas, being always ready to supply troops to whichever side offered the best prospect of advantage or revenge. The peasantry were not, indeed, their only victims. Chiefs were harassed and weakened till they fell an easy prey to the swarm of oppressors who, under the authority, real or pretended, of leases from the viceroy, quartered themselves on the district.\n\nThese harpies usurped the titles of former officials, calling themselves, without much regard to their power, Naw\u00e1bs, Chaklad\u00e1rs, \u00c1mils, N\u00e1zims, Talukad\u00e1rs, and Naib-n\u00e1zims; but were all guided by one principle, that of acquiring as much money as they could in the shortest time possible. The chief officer of the district set them the example.\n\nSoon after the battle of Baksar, a Major Hannay received charge of the Naw\u00e1b\u2019s troops and of the B\u00e4hr\u00e1ch and Gorakhpur revenues. With the actual administration or maladministration of the country he seems to have\n\n1 Report on Salempur, 1836.\ninterfered but little. But he certainly strengthened the hands of revenue collectors, and maintained a force sufficient to coerce the R\u00e1jas, weakened as they were by their local disputes and warfare. Had he applied his power to maintain order and prevent the farmers and marauders from pillaging the people, he might perhaps have saved the country from the worst misfortunes which overtook it. It must, however, be allowed that the task would have been difficult, and might have cost him not only his position, but his life. The Oudh Government had already fallen into a condition of almost unparallelled inefficiency and venality. To realize this it is only necessary to quote the description of Oudh given by General Sloeman a lifetime later in 1850, and to apply the quotation to Gorakhpur. His account may be summarized as follows:\n\n\"The revenue was farmed to men whose only object was to extort as much as they could during their term of office. The Naw\u00e1b's attention was engrossed by the course of events which threatened his throne. Except the most powerful landholders, no man was safe for a moment in person, office, or property; and with such a feeling of insecurity prevailing, it was impossible that any country should flourish. There was no police. Those who should have protected were the first to plunder; and justice was to be had only by those who could pay for it.\" Such was Gorakhpur as left by Major Hannay. Regarding his personal exactions and cruelties there is perhaps not sufficient evidence to warrant a decided opinion. Burke accused him of having done incalculable mischief; and Mill, endorsing this opinion, states that he laid waste a vast tract of country which before his oppressions was rich and flourishing.\n\nBut whether he directed or permitted the pillage, the effect of his government was equally injurious. Either he had not the courage and will to oppose the extortions of his subordinates, or he had not the power. Perhaps the truth lies between these two alternatives. It is certain at all events that he made no scruple in farming out his charge piecemeal to a set of extortionate and heartless underlings, who rackrented and not unfrequently pillaged the people, till a great part of the agricultural population were driven to abandon their holdings and quit the district.\n\nThe Sat\u00e1si R\u00e1ja meanwhile, instead of devoting his strength to protect his domain from these evils, plunged into a war with the B\u00fatwal R\u00e1ja, by whom he was defeated with much slaughter in 1788. The B\u00e1nsi R\u00e1ja occupied himself in expeditions against the Banj\u00e1ras, whom he finally drove from his dominions about 1790, following them up and inflicting severe punishment on all who\n\n1 History, vol. IV., p. 313.\nfell into his hands. The Dhuriap\u00e1r R\u00e9jas had not yet recovered from their long family quarrel, and, having been further weakened by the Banj\u00e1ras, were powerless to withstand the exactions of the farmers backed by Major Hannay's troops.\n\nThe Majhauli R\u00e1ja alone seems to have been prudent enough to reserve his strength for the protection of the land around his capital. He virtually withdrew from the contest with the Banj\u00e1ras in the east, and abandoned the tract which now forms the Sidhua Jobna parganah to their ravages. By this means he contrived to save the greater portion of the Majhauli parganah from them and the farmers; and at the cession this was found to be almost the only portion of the district which was fairly cultivated and inhabited.\n\nThe terrible state of insecurity in the Sidhua Jobna parganah gave the opportunity for the rise of the two principal tal\u00fakas which still comprise between them the greater portion of the parganah.\n\nThe first of these was B\u00e1nk Jogni tal\u00faka or Tamk\u00fahi R\u00e1j, which was founded by Fateh Sah\u00e1i, Bhuf\u00e1b\u00e1r R\u00e1ja of Hoshy\u00e1rpur in S\u00e1ran. He claimed descent from Mayyura, founder of the Majhauli R\u00e1j, by a Bhuf\u00e1b\u00e1r wife; and his descendants are still recognized as connections by the Majhauli family. Refusing to acknowledge British authority, he was after the battle of Baksar expelled from S\u00e1ran, and settled on an estate he had bought a few years before in tappas B\u00e1nk and Jogni. He brought with him a large amount of treasure, and received also the support of the Majhauli R\u00e1ja, who was wise enough to see the advantage of retaining a friendly power as a rampart between himself and the Banj\u00e1ras. By usurpation, or more commonly by voluntary transfers from weaker zam\u00ednd\u00e1rs, he extended his possessions swiftly and widely over the south-east of Sidhua Jobna, and before his death was recognised as tal\u00fakad\u00e1r of nearly 100 villages.\n\nThe second tal\u00faka, that of Padrauna, rose into importance much in the same way, although its founders had a severer struggle with the Banj\u00e1ras before they succeeded in establishing any kind of security for their dependents. It originated in a grant made by the R\u00e1ja of Majhauli to one of his followers, and the first grantee was a dependent who had risen from a menial capacity, and was rewarded by the grant of some of the villages most harassed by the Banj\u00e1ras. This cheap method of providing for importunate claims accorded also with the policy which led the R\u00e1ja to support Fateh Sah\u00e1i.\n\nThe grant at first consisted of but two villages; but the state of the country gave the grantee an opportunity of extending his authority. The\nfact of his being a Kurmi furnished the pretext of claiming descent from Mayyura's fourth wife; and the influence he obtained from this connection with the Majhauli R\u00e1ja, still the most powerful prince in the district, gave him an ascendancy which enabled him very quickly to make the neighbouring villages acknowledge his authority. The dread, moreover, of Banj\u00e1ras and other marauders forced the weaker proprietors to obtain the support of some powerful ally. He usually, therefore, found them ready to surrender the nominal ownership of their villages, and to pay a certain percentage of their incomes, in return for the protection which he promised to afford them. The estates of the more independent he either by fraud or force annexed. In that age of misrule no redress could be obtained, except by those who were too strong to require it. The Majhauli R\u00e1ja was unlikely to interfere; and this portion of the district had now become too poor to attract the rapacity of either Hannay or his subordinates.\n\nIn this manner the taluka rose into importance almost as rapidly as that of Fateh Sahai; and, owing to their common dependence on Majhauli, both parties refrained from aggression on each other's domains. Whatever may be thought of the coercion and fraud by which these tal\u00fakas were to some extent established, there can be no doubt that the security they afforded was of the utmost value to the subordinate landholders whose estates they enclosed. Without the central authority of the tal\u00fakad\u00e1r these men could never have combined effectively to resist the Banj\u00e1ras. Nor would there have been any means of ending the quarrels and violence which prevailed before. One rapacious master was better than a host of petty tyrants.\n\nBut in 1801 the arrears of subsidies, due under various treaties for the use of English troops, had reached an amount which the Naw\u00e1b Vaz\u00edr found himself quite unable to pay; and to wipe off the debt Sa\u00e1dat Ali surrendered Gorakhpur and other tracts to the East India Company. Since the 10th November in the year just mentioned the district has been subject to British rule.\u00b9\n\nIts condition at the time of cession was about as wretched as could well be imagined. It is described as almost entirely without administration, overgrown with jungle, roadless, infested by robbers, and in many places laid waste by the armed retainers of the principal landholders. \"I find it impossible,\" writes Mr. Routledge in 1801, \"to convey to you any adequate idea of the desolated state of this country. I have been informed that in one year nearly 400,000 raiyats fled from it; and those who remained only cultivated by stealth for fear of opposition.\"\n\n\u00b9 See Aitchison's Treaties, vol. II, p. 61, note.\nThe B\u00fatwal domain in the north was considered less unfortunate; but it had been wasted by wars with Sat\u00e1si, and was still scoured by Nep\u00e1lese marauders pretending to collect a tribute which the R\u00e1ja did not owe. Like his brother chieftains, that R\u00e1ja was little disposed to submit tamely to the new government. Plunder and private war had become as the breath of their nostrils. Despoiled by the Banj\u00e1ras, the east was only beginning to recover under the protection of the newly-formed tal\u00fakas. The depopulation of the south-west had been successfully undertaken by the collectors of taxes; and the south-east, or Majh\u00e1uli country, was the only flourishing part of the district. Its centre had always been occupied by a large tract of jungle, which the misgovernment of later days had greatly extended.\n\nThe fiscal and general administration of the district, from the date of the cession to that of the Nepalese war, has been elsewhere described. Long before the former event the Gurkhas had taken advantage of the prevailing anarchy to increase their possessions in the plains. Their encroachments had extended all along the Tar\u00e1i country at the foot of the hills, but were most marked in what was then the north of this district. They had driven the R\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal from his mountain domain of P\u00e1lpa, and followed up their success by the occupation of his Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur territories. They had annexed Shi\u00far\u00e1j, a tract on the left bank of the Arrah, just north of the modern Basti. For the revenue of these tracts they indeed professed themselves liable to the Oudh Government; but they paid it or not, just as best suited their own convenience.\n\nIt has been already mentioned that at the first British settlement of land revenue the R\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal himself engaged to pay the assessment on his nominal domains in this district, and that he was afterwards imprisoned for refusal to defray arrears. About 1805 the Gurkhas claimed B\u00fatwal as part of the country conquered from him, and sent officials to collect the revenue. On his release from imprisonment the R\u00e1ja was inveigled to Kathm\u00e1ndu, where he was murdered on the ground of alleged intrigues with the British. His family surrendered B\u00fatwal to the direct management of the Company, and retired to enjoy their pension (m\u00e1lik\u00e1na) in peace at Gorakhpur. Meanwhile, by the beginning of 1806, the Nep\u00e1lese had annexed two-thirds of the disputed country. The provisional Governor-General, Sir George Barlow, who was then at Allahabad, sent them a letter demanding the evacuation of B\u00fatwal, but offering to let them keep Shi\u00far\u00e1j. This they answered by an offer to engage for the B\u00fatwal revenue on\n\n---\n\n1 Political and Military Transactions in India, 1813-23, by H. T. Prinsep, Bengal Civil Service: London, 1825. This contemporary work is the best that can be consulted on the subject of the Nepalese war.\nthe terms of the first settlement. But Sir George was shortly afterwards super-\nseded by Lord Minto, whose attention was engrossed by other matters. The ques-\ntion dropped out of sight, and the Nepalese completed the annexation of B\u00fatwal.\n\nEmboldened by British indifference, they in 1810-11 crossed the B\u00fatwal\nboundary and seized some villages of parganah P\u00e1li.\nThis led at the beginning of 1812 to a remonstrance\nfrom Lord Minto, who, while repeating the offer of\nShi\u00far\u00e1j, demanded the instant evacuation of B\u00fatwal. The Gurkhas replied\nby asserting a distinct right to all they had taken and more. Anxious to do\nthem every justice, Lord Minto appointed a commissioner to investigate\ntheir claims. Proceeding to the northern frontier of this district, Major\nParis Bradshaw in 1813 submitted a report on the whole dispute. He showed\nthat the Gurkhas had no right to either B\u00fatwal or Shi\u00far\u00e1j; and Lord Minto\nthereon demanded the evacuation of both. The Nep\u00e1l court sent a respectful\nand even affectionate answer, in which, without giving reasons, they said that\nMajor Bradshaw's investigation had led them to a conclusion just the reverse of\nthat formed by the British Government.\n\nHow Lord Minto would have met this reply it is vain to speculate. But\nat the end of 1813 he was succeeded by Lord Moira,\nwho early in the following year peremptorily\nordered the Gurkhas to quit both B\u00fatwal and\nShi\u00far\u00e1j. The Magistrate of Gorakhpur was at the same time directed\nto march the Gorakhpur contingent into the disputed tract if the order\nwere not obeyed in 25 days. The Nepalese, however, remained where they were,\nand the Magistrate (Sir Roger Martin) handed the dispute over to the military\nofficer commanding. Three companies occupied Shi\u00far\u00e1j and B\u00fatwal without the\nslightest opposition. The Magistrate established police-stations at Chitwa, Ba-\nsauria, and Saura in B\u00fatwal, with subordinate outposts in Shi\u00far\u00e1j (April, 1814).\n\nBefore, however, the troops had rearived at Gorakhpur, the Nepalese sur-\nrounded and attacked the three stations in B\u00fatwal.\nEighteen policemen were killed, and the chief officer at\nChitwa was, after his surrender, murdered in cold\nblood (May). The Magistrate ordered the fugitive remnant to retire on\nB\u00e1nsi; meanwhile one of the Shi\u00far\u00e1j outposts was attacked and four more\npolicemen slain (June). War was now of course inevitable, but its declaration\nwas for several reasons postponed till the 1st November, 1814.\n\nThe larger operations of the two campaigns that followed were conducted\non the Panj\u00e1b, Du\u00e1b, and Bih\u00e1r portions of the\nNep\u00e1l frontier. But of the four columns engaged in\nthe first campaign, one under General J. S. Wood was directed to make Gorakhpur its base of operations. Starting hence on the 15th of November, it was to penetrate through B\u00fatwal into Palpa. The column consisted of about 4,000 infantry, including the 17th Regiment of British foot, and was strengthened by 11 guns of different calibre.\n\nIt was late in November before General Wood left Gorakhpur. Through Action at B\u00fatwal, January, 1816. Bin\u00e1yakpur or Tilpur, and B\u00fatwal, he marched without opposition. But the town of B\u00fatwal itself lies at the foot of the hills, in the mouth of a pass; and across this pass the Nep\u00e1lese Colonel,\u00b9 Vaz\u00edr Singh, had built a strong stockade. To reconnoitre and carry this work General Wood left his Tar\u00e1i camp on the 3rd of January. A Brahman servant of the B\u00fatwal family, still living at Gorakhpur, offered his services as guide, and conducted the force up the banks of the Ghunghi. The last seven miles of the road lay through thick sal forest, but the General had been led to expect an open space in the immediate neighbourhood of the stockade. He was still in the wood with his advanced guard when the road brought them suddenly in front of their goal, now not more than fifty yards distant. The Nep\u00e1lese opened a smart fire, and, before General Wood had completed a hurried reconnaissance, wounded two officers. But the main body, including the British regiment, soon arrived; a party that had sallied from the stockade was driven up the hills; and in pursuing them upwards three companies of the 17th succeeded also in outflanking the enemy\u2019s work. The enemy scrambled away up the hillside behind the stockade. But General Wood, thinking the fortification would be untenable unless the hill also were carried, forbore to press his advantage, and sounded a retreat. Flushed with the prospect of a certain and easy victory, his troops were grievously disappointed. They had lost 24 comrades to no purpose. The fatuous strategy of their leader can only be excused on the ground that he had been hurried and worried by a difficult morning\u2019s march.\n\nThe bravery displayed by the enemy, and exaggerated rumours of Imbedility of General their strength, led him to imagine his own force in- J S. Wood. adequate for an advance. Parties of irregular cavalry were added to his force; but instead of attempting to penetrate the hills, he confined his operations to the defensive. Throwing up works at Lotan in Basti, he placed there a garrison to defend the main route from Gorakhpur. He himself moved with his main body to repel an incursion into Nichlavsl.\n\n\u00b9 The Nep\u00e1lese had early adopted English titles for their military officers. But these titles implied greater commands in their army than in the English. There were but one general and some three or four colonels on the whole of their army list. A captain commanded a battalion, and a laftan or lieutenant a company.\nHis vacillating policy rendered such incursions an almost daily occurrence. January, February, and even March, saw villages in the north of this district plundered and burnt. Though reinforced by further infantry and artillery, he still deemed himself too weak to act offensively. He burnt by way of retaliation several Gurkha villages, and marched whithersoever he heard the foe were advancing. He still, however, believed and represented the Nepalese force to be much greater than his own. And it was not till April, when directed to verify his belief by actual contact with the enemy, that he again appeared before B\u00fatwal. On the 17th of that month he bombarded the place for several hours without result. He then laid waste the Nepalese possessions in the plain and returned to cantonments at Gorakhpur. In the middle of May the victories of General Ochterlony put an end to the first campaign, leaving Dehra D\u00fan and Kumaun in the hands of the English.\n\nBut the demands of the Company were not yet satisfied. In March the Nepalese General Amar Singh had been consulted as to the advisability of ceding also the Gorakhpur and S\u00e1ran Tar\u00e1\u00eds, and had counselled his chief against it. In May the English had demanded the whole of the Tar\u00e1\u00ed, whether in Gorakhpur, S\u00e1ran, or elsewhere. The Nepalese were, however, unready to surrender a tract in which most of their principal courtiers had been granted fiefs; and the Governor-General deemed preparations for a fresh campaign advisable. It was proposed to reinforce the Gorakhpur column, and place it under the command of Colonel Nicholls for renewed operations against B\u00fatwal and P\u00e1lpa. In the second campaign, however, the Gorakhpur column took no part. Negotiations lingered on till the end of October. The British demand had by that time been reduced to the Tar\u00e1\u00ed country between the Sarju and Gandak, and any other parts already held by our forces. Compensation to the extent of two l\u00e1khs of rupees was at the same time offered to disappointed Nepalese grantees. These terms were accepted, and a treaty signed at Sigauli on the 28th November.\n\nBut this treaty was, so far as the Gurkhas were concerned, a mere feint. Ratification under their great seal was promised in fifteen days, but never came; and it was soon ascertained that the Nepalese intended to continue the war. A formal intimation to that effect met the British army on its way to the border in February, 1816. Sir David Ochterlony this time penetrated into Nep\u00e1l through Bih\u00e1r, completing the campaign by the beginning of the following month. The Nepalese ratified the treaty of Sigauli on the 4th March, and the whole of the lowlands between Sarju and Gandak, except B\u00fatwal Kh\u00e1s,\u00b9 passed into the hands of the British.\n\n\u00b9 i.e. B\u00fatwal, excluding Bin\u00e1yakpur and Tilpur.\nBut as a politic act of conciliation, the Governor-General decided to surrender to the conquered Nepalese as much of the Tarai as might not be required to form a straight and even frontier. The boundary was surveyed and marked out in the same year. It ran in a fairly direct line parallel to the trend of the hills, but, except just north of Pali and Shilpur, did not approach their foot.\n\nBetween the close of the Nepalese war in 1816 and the outbreak of the Mutiny some forty-one years afterwards, the history of the district is marked by no important events, except the settlements and famines already described.\n\nThe rebellion of 1857 was ushered in by disturbances towards the close of May. Some of the more turbulent landholders, including those of Paina on the Ghagra, burst out into acts of robbery and violence. On the 5th June, the headquarters of the 17th N. I., which supplied a detachment to Gorakhpur, mutinied at Azamgarh, and on the 7th July the convicts in the Gorakhpur jail made a desperate but unsuccessful effort to escape. On the 8th the infantry detachment attempted to seize the Government treasure, but were checked by Mr. Wynyard, the Judge, with some troopers of the 12th Irregular Cavalry. On the 10th, six European officers who had escaped from Faizabad were murdered in Nagar of Basti, and about the same time a detachment of the 17th N. I. plundered the opium treasury at Basti itself. Towards the close of July the landholders of the northern and western parganahs proclaimed our rule at an end, and the criminal classes reaped a rich harvest of plunder. Six Nepalese regiments were now marched to Gorakhpur by Colonel Wroughton, and the remnant of the 17th N. I. was disarmed (1st August). But disorder still spread through the district, and in what is now Basti a number of the tahsilis were plundered. Mutineers from Sigauli attempted to plunder also the opium treasury at Salempur, but were repulsed by the guard. It is not very clear why the civil officers felt themselves forced to abandon their district on the 13th August. Sir Charles Wingfield thinks it \"sufficient to say that they declined to remain with less than four regiments,\" while Colonel Wroughton declined to leave more than two. But there had as yet been no outbreak at Gorakhpur itself, and that post could hardly be deemed untenable. On the 13th, however, Europeans evacuate the Europeans and Nepalese left together; the Joint Magistrate, Mr. Bird, alone remaining. The care of the district had been entrusted to a committee of five Rajas\u2014Satasi, Gopalpur, Majhauli, Tamkahi, and Banshi; and Mr. Bird hoped to supervise their labours.\n\nThe retreating Europeans and Nepalese were followed from Gorakhpur by a body of insurgents under Muhammad Hasan, who was however repulsed with loss (18th July). On his return to Gorakhpur two days later he was\nwelcomed by the jail guard, whose charges had been released, and by the R\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, who had turned rebel. Mr. Bird fled into the forest, and, notwithstanding the reward of Rs. 5,000 set on his head, reached Motih\u00e1ri in safety. The committee of R\u00e1jas of course dissolved itself. By the treachery of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed and non-attendance of Majhauli, its numbers were by this time reduced to three. The R\u00e1jas of Barhi\u00e1par, Nagar, Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r, and other chiefs, followed the example of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, openly siding with the rebels.\n\nThe insurgent army camped near Gorakhpur, setting fire to most of the houses in the civil station and cantonments. But, considering himself secure in Muhammad Hasan's new authority, Muhammad Hasan endeavoured as far as possible to prevent destruction of property. Large sums of money were extorted by violence from the merchants and bankers of the city. And in the words of Sir C. Wingfield, who was appointed Commissioner just after the rebellion, \"the strong preyed everywhere on the weak.\"\n\nIn a very short time however, the reign of Muhammad Hasan came to an end. The Nep\u00e1lse forces advanced under Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur from the north, and the British force under Colonel Rowcroft from the south. The former occupied Gorakhpur on the 11th January, 1858, after slight skirmishes at Pipra on the Gandak, and Pipraich. The latter defeated the rebels under Harkishan Singh at Mairwa. The insurgents were driven through Gorakhpur city across the R\u00e9pti, and Muhammad Hasan fled with such speed that he the same day crossed the Gh\u00e1gra at T\u00e1nda. British authority was re-established, and many disloyal landholders were punished by death or the confiscation of their estates.\n\nThus in 1858 the Sat\u00e1s\u00ed R\u00e1j fell after an existence of 500 years. The Barhi\u00e1par title and estates were forfeited, and it was some years before the R\u00e1ja was pardoned and allowed to return to the district. Part of the Padrauna tal\u00faka shared the same fate, and the family having lost large sums in litigation with the R\u00e1ja of Bettia, were only saved from utter ruin by the industry and ability of Isri Part\u00e1b, father of the present R\u00e1e. The R\u00e1ja of Gop\u00e1lpur had remained faithful; but his estates were so burdened by debt that it was absolutely necessary to sell the greater portion. The R\u00e1ja's daughter-in-law, who purchased part of them, is generally known as the R\u00e1ni of Gop\u00e1lpur. The Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r R\u00e1j came to an end; the R\u00e1ja being\n\n---\n\n1 Sir Charles Wingfield simply says the 6th, without mentioning the month or year; but the date has been taken from Colonel Rowcroft's own report.\n2 Such as they were; but extravagance and litigation had left very little to be forfeited.\n3 The family regained their prosperity by the purchase for a small sum of the Jangal Padrauna grant, held before by Mr. Sym. \"The income derived from this rich tract,\" writes Mr. Lumden, \"has enabled Isri Partab to pay off his debts and recover a portion of the tal\u00faka.\" (Sidhwa Jobna Report, para. 4).\nhanged, and a small pension of about Rs. 30 paid to his widow. The Muslim R\u00e1ja of Sh\u00e1hpur in Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r met with the same fate. Part of his property was bestowed on the Gop\u00e1lpur R\u00e1ja, and may be said to have saved the latter from ruin. The R\u00e1ja of Majbaurli was so deeply indebted that, but for the timely intervention of Government, a few years must have seen him ruined. But his creditors were paid off by the State, and his lands placed under the Court of Wards, by which they are still managed.\n\nThe R\u00e1ja of Anola remained almost undisturbed by the rebellion; while the Tamk\u00fahi chief, who had prudently abstained from putting himself prominently forward on either side, preserved, and has since greatly increased his possessions. The R\u00e1ja of Nichiaval, last representative of the B\u00fatwal family, joined the mutineers, thereby forfeiting the stipend Government had since 1845 allowed him in compensation for his talt\u00edkad\u00e1ri rights in Tilpur. A year or two later Nep\u00e1l was rewarded for its assistance by large territorial concessions in the north of the district. The evil effects of the rebellion have now passed away, and the revenue of the settlement since effected with ease.\n\nThe large income and area of the district, as it then stood, in 1865 caused its division into two charges by the separation of Basti. Even thus shorn, Gorakhpur is much larger than the average district, and further reduction of its area has been long discussed.\n\nLooking back to the beginning of the century and of British rule, no one could deny that the strong arm and just intentions of our Government have despite defects of administration, developed the resources and multiplied the wealth of a land which native misgovernment had prostrated and ruined.\n## GAZETTEER OF THE NORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES.\n\n### GORAKHPUR DISTRICT.\n\n#### CONTENTS.\n\n| Page | Page |\n|------|------|\n| Amwa | 460  |\n| Anola | ib. |\n| Anola parganah | ib. |\n| Baikunthpur | 462 |\n| Belaruna | 463 |\n| B\u00e2ng\u00e2on I. | ib. |\n| B\u00e2ng\u00e2on II. | 464 |\n| B\u00e2ng\u00e2on tahsil | ib. |\n| Barhaj | 467 |\n| Barhalganj | 468 |\n| Barhi | ib. |\n| Belaharia | 469 |\n| Belghat | ib. |\n| Belip\u00e2r | ib. |\n| Bhagalpur | 470 |\n| Bhaus\u00e2p\u00e2r parganah | 471 |\n| Bin\u00e2yakpur parganah | 472 |\n| Biraicha | 475 |\n| Bishanpur | ib. |\n| Captainganj | 476 |\n| Chaumukha | ib. |\n| Chaurs | ib. |\n| Chilliup\u00e2r parganah | ib. |\n| Deoria | 478 |\n| Deoria tahsil | 479 |\n| Dh\u00e2ni | ib. |\n| Dh\u00e2riap\u00e2r parganah | 480 |\n| Fakir-ki-kothi | 485 |\n| Gagaha | ib. |\n| Gajpur | 487 |\n| Gaura | ib. |\n| Gh\u00e2ti | 488 |\n| Gola | 489 |\n| Gop\u00e2lpur | ib. |\n| Gorakhpur | 499 |\n| Gorakhpur or Head-quarters tahsil | ib. |\n| H\u00e1ta | ib. |\n| H\u00e1ta tahsil | ib. |\n| Ilaveli parganah | 500 |\n| It\u00e2ya | 505 |\n| Kah\u00e2on | ib. |\n| Kasia | 506 |\n| K\u00e1z\u00eepur | 510 |\n| Khakhundu | ib. |\n| Kh\u00e1n\u00e2p\u00e2r | 512 |\n| Kot\u00eebh\u00e2r | ib. |\n| L\u00e2rh | ib. |\n| Maghar parganah | 513 |\n| Mah\u00e2r\u00e2jganj | 515 |\n| Mah\u00e2r\u00e2jganj tahsil | 516 |\n| Majhauli and Salempur | ib. |\n| Mans\u00fbrganj | 519 |\n| Mot\u00eer\u00e2m-ka-udda | ib. |\n| Musela | 520 |\n| Nichlav\u00e2l | ib. |\n| Padrauna | ib. |\n| Padrauna tahsil | 523 |\n| Paikauli | ib. |\n| Paina | 524 |\n| Paisya | 525 |\n| Panera | ib. |\n| Pipr\u00e1ich | ib. |\n| R\u00e2nkola | 526 |\n| Rampur-Kh\u00e2npur | ib. |\n| R\u00e2nigh\u00e2t | ib. |\n| Rig\u00e2uli | ib. |\n| Rudarpur-East | ib. |\n| Rudarpur-West or Rudrapur | 530 |\n| Sahiya | 531 |\n| Sahnjanua | ib. |\n| Salempur parganah | ib. |\n| Semra I | 534 |\n| Semra II | ib. |\n| Sh\u00e2hjh\u00e2npur parganah | ib. |\n| Sidhua Jobna parganah | 537 |\n| Silhat parganah | 541 |\n| Siwa-b\u00e2z\u00e2r | 543 |\n| Sohan\u00e2g | 544 |\n| Surnuli | 546 |\n| Tamk\u00fbhi | ib. |\n| T\u00e2rakulwa | ib. |\n| Tar\u00e2-Suj\u00e2n | 547 |\n| Tilpur parganah | ib. |\n| T\u00fbl\u00eebh\u00e2ri | 550 |\n\n59\nAMWA Kh\u00e1s or Proper, a collection of scattered villages in tappa R\u00e1mpur Dh\u00e1b of parganah Sidhua-Jobna, stands near the Champ\u00e1ran frontier, 68 miles by road from Gorakhpur. The Great Gandak, on whose bank it formerly stood, now flows some miles to the east. But the alluvial tract between Amwa and the river is still subject to occasional flooding.\n\nIts population, 6,150 in 1872, is Amwa's only claim to notice. But except in numbers, that population is nowise remarkable. It consists chiefly of agriculturists belonging to low Hindu castes. The villages or hamlets which compose Amwa contain no private buildings of any importance, and no public buildings at all. So insignificant, indeed, is the place that in 1870 the Sanitary Commissioner\u00b9 was unable to find it. And he very rightly came to the conclusion that, except in the form of scattered villages, no such town could exist.\n\nANOLA or Sangr\u00e1mpur, a compact village in tappa Haveli of the parganah to which it gives its name, stands on a cart-track branching from the Gorakhpur-Belgh\u00e1t road, 13 miles south-south-west of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 a population of 2,735 persons, chiefly husbandmen and Hind\u00fas.\n\nThe village stands on a slight eminence, and, being surrounded by thick masses of trees, presents at a short distance a rather picturesque appearance. Not far north of it lie some large patches of forest, which are preserved for the sake of the sport which they afford to the local r\u00e1ja. The strong bramble hedges that fence in the fields around the village show that deer, antelope, and other four-footed foes of cultivation are still numerous. The only public institution is an elementary school. The r\u00e1ja of Anola, whose family history has been elsewhere\u00b2 told, inhabits a large brick house in the village; and a good many old brick wells may be found in the neighbourhood. But the prevailing material of construction is mud. A house-tax was formerly levied under Act XX. of 1856, but this has now been abolished. The name of the village is sometimes written as if it were derived from \u00e1nula or aonla, the tree elsewhere known as emblic myrobalans. But between the place and the plant there seems to be no real connection. Anola is still spelt Anaula, and was once spelt Anhaula.\n\nANOLA, a parganah of the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsil, is bounded on the south-east and north-east by parganah Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r; on the north by Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r and parganah Maghar; on the south-west by the Basti district, and on its irregular southern frontier by parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r. The north-eastern boundary with Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r is formed by the Ami\u00e1r lagoon and \u00c1mi river. The Ku\u00e1na affords an\n\n\u00b9See his report for that year, p. 38, para 119. \u00b2Above, pp. 401, 436.\noccasional frontier with Basti; and the Tarena, which rises in the parganah, with Dhuriap\u00e1r. Anola is divided into three tappas, Haveli, Mahsin, and Bankata. Containing 401 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza), it had in 1878\u00b9 an area of 71,303 acres and a land revenue of Rs. 43,721.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Anola contained 325 inhabited sites, of which 217 had less than 200 inhabitants; 90 between 200 and 500; 12 between 500 and 1,000; 2 between 1,000 and 2,000; 3 between 2,000 and 3,000; and 1 (B\u00e1ns\u00e1gon) between 3,000 and 5,000. The population numbered 70,116 souls (32,683 females), giving 294 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 66,294 Hind\u00fas, of whom 30,916 were females; and 3,822 Musalm\u00e1ns (1,070 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shews 9,818 Br\u00e1hmans (4,565 females); 4,735 R\u00e1jputs (2,232 females); and 2,014 Baniyas (924 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 49,727 souls (23,195 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (9,818). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Sarnet (2,414), Sakarw\u00e1l, Bais, and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the following subdivisions: K\u00e1ndu (425), Agarw\u00e1l, Agrahri, Baranw\u00e1r, Unai, and Kasaudhan. The most numerous among the other castes are the Bind, Teli, Ko\u00e9ri, Ah\u00edr, Loh\u00e1r, Hajj\u00e1m, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Satw\u00e1r, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Kalw\u00e1r, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Thathera, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, B\u00e1ri, Atith, Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Bharbhunja, and Beld\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are distributed amongst Shaikhs (3,317), Sayyids (10), Mughals (6), and Path\u00e1ns (444), or left unspecified.\n\nThe parganah is a well-wooded and well-cultivated plain, whose only prominences are the slight undulations adjoining the low basin of the \u00c1mi. A memorial of ancient woodland survives in tappa Bankata, whose name means the \"forest-clearing;\" and at the assessment of 1839-40 there was still a large area of forest. But this has dwindled down till limited to the game-preserve, less than one square mile in extent, north of Anola.\u00b2 The bulk of the parganah is cultivated and, thanks to the freshness of its cultivation, fertile. Of the total area 55,390 acres are recorded as either tilled or arable.\u00b3 The extension of cultivation under British rule has allowed the land-revenue to increase nearly fourfold.\n\n\u00b9 Government Circular No. 701., dated 4th July, 1878.\n\u00b2 See article on that village.\n\u00b3 Mr. Lamden's settlement report, which gives the same total area as shown above.\nThe soils are loam (dorus) and sand (balua). There is no natural clay soil (mattuy\u00e1r) although the manured lands around village homesteads sometimes pass by that name.\\(^1\\) Water for irrigation is obtained from many ponds and the pools of many streams. Eighty-seven per cent. of the total area is watered. But the instability of the sub-soil, and the distance of water from the surface, render wells expensive. Of the two harvests, the largest and most remunerative is the spring. Its principal crops are barley, wheat, and pulses; but gram, peas, tobacco, and opium are extensively raised.\n\nAnola can boast no other noteworthy products. The only considerable manufacture, that of coarse cloth, is not peculiar to the parganah. Weekly markets are held at five towns or villages, of which the most important for trade purposes is Bhainsa Mathu in Mahsin. The official capital is B\u00e1ns\u011f\u00e1on, the historic capital Anola. The marts at which the parganah sells its crops are, however, rather outside it than of it. It is connected by road or river with many places, such as Gorakhpur or Barhaj. Two unmetalled highways traverse the centre, two cart-tracks the east of the parganah. The \u00c1mi and the Ku\u00e1na are navigable for at least two-thirds of the year.\n\nThe parganah was first cleared and colonized by the dependents of the Sarnet R\u00e9jputs. The traditional leader of the colony was Randh\u00edr Singh, ancestor of the present r\u00e1ja of Anola. At what exact period he lived it is now impossible to say. But at the end of the sixteenth century we find Anola a parganah of the Gorakhpur division (sark\u00e1r) and Oudh province (stiba), with a State rental of Rs. 5,028.\\(^2\\) Part of Oudh it remained until ceded to the Company and included in its present district (1801). The land-taxes since imposed on it have been at the first assessment Rs. 11,698; at the second, Rs. 10,648; at the third, Rs. 9,542; at the fourth, Rs. 12,368; and at the fifth, Rs. 30,673. The sum last named had before the expiry of the fifth settlement risen to Rs. 43,200; and the demand of the next or current assessment has been shown above.\\(^3\\)\n\nBAIKUNTHPUR,\\(^4\\) a village in tappa Kachu\u00e1r of parganah Salempur Majhauli, stands on the banks of the Little Gandak river, about 40 miles southwest of Gorakhpur. It in 1872 had 869 inhabitants. The village is held by a family of Bisen R\u00e9jputs, an offshoot of the Majhauli house. It is remarkable as the site of the most important fair in the district, held by the Panh\u00e1ri Ji of Paikauli (\\(q.v.\\)) on the fifth of the bright half of Aghan.\\(^5\\) The fair has been established for the last 52\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) For a brief description of all these soils see above, p. 285.  \n\\(^2\\) 2,01,120 ddam; see Akbar's Institutes.  \n\\(^3\\) For some account of all these settlements see above, pp. 379-65.  \n\\(^4\\) This article has been kindly contributed by Mr. Crooke.  \n\\(^5\\) November-December.\nyears. On its principal day a dramatic performance, representing the Dhanuk Jug, or contest for the hand of Sita, daughter of Janaka, king of Mithila, is given. The successful suitor, R\u0101mchandra, breaks the bow of Siva on a large masonry platform amidst the acclamations of the assembled spectators. The fair is attended by about 30,000 people; while it lasts, a large market is established; and as there is no good trade-centre in the neighbourhood, the surrounding villagers flock hither to lay in their annual supplies of cloth, vessels, &c. The sales are very large.\n\nBairauna Kh\u00e1s or Proper, a village in tappa Bairauna or Bairon\u00e1u of parganah Salempur Majhauli, contains the ruins of an ancient fort attributed to the Bhars.\u00b9 The distance by unmetalled road from Gorakhpur is about 37 miles. The population in 1872 was 738 only.\n\nB\u0101usg\u0101on, or \"the village of bambus,\" is the capital of the tahs\u012bl so named. It stands on a cart-track in tappa Mahsin of parganah Anola, 19 miles south of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 3,069 souls.\n\nThe town or village really consists of 10 hamlets, whereof the principal are Sh\u00e1hpur Kabra or B\u0101usg\u0101on, Bar\u00e1ban, Dunkh\u00e1r, and Majhgaw\u00e1n. On the slight eminence crowned by Bar\u00e1ban, \"the great forest,\" stand close together the munsif's court and the tahs\u012bli. Between them and Dunkh\u00e1r, which contains the first-class police-station, lies the excise store-house. Beyond the police-station, in Sh\u00e1hpur Kabra, rises the great mass of the village houses, which are mostly poor buildings of mud. The only public institutions not hitherto mentioned are the imperial post-office, a Government school, a hostel (dharm\u015b\u0101la) built in 1871 by general subscription, two Hindu temples and one Muslim mosque. As might be expected, however, in a mere cluster of agricultural hamlets there is no building of any special interest.\n\nIn Bar\u00e1ban are some masonry structures and the greatest appearance of comfort, but as a whole the place looks like most Indian villages\u2014poor, squalid, and untidy. Where, however, a short distance lends enchantment to the view, Bar\u00e1ban nestling amongst its fine groves of mango trees looks well enough.\n\nThe land around the town is held by a great number of proprietors, some of whose holdings are barely sufficient to support existence. Owing probably to the nearness of Gorakhpur, into which the villagers carry their grain for sale, there is little local trade. But a market is held every Friday, and a fair on the ninth of the bright half of Ku\u00e1r (September-October). On this latter occasion, writes Mr. Crooke, all the Sarnet Rajputs go to worship Devi at an old asth\u0101n or shrine. Cutting their bodies in seven places,\n\n\u00b9 For some account of the manner in which the Bisens expelled the Bhars see articles on Majhauli and Salempur.\nthey offer up the blood to the goddess. They also sacrifice a male buffalo, and carry round a young pig, which they kill by knocking it against the ground. The ceremony is in memory of their conquest of the Chauhans and occupation of Bansgaon.\n\nBansgaon, an agricultural village in tappa Rampur Ragaha of parganah Sidhua Jobna; lies 64 miles by road east of Gorakhpur. Its only claim to notice is its population, which amounted in 1872 to 3,340.\n\nBansgaon has an elementary (halkabandi) school. About a dozen years ago one of its landholders started an indigo factory which has long ceased working. The village is said to have been founded by Bhuinharas from the south, and still contain many Bhuinhar inhabitants.\n\nBansgaon, a tahsil with head-quarters at the Bansgaon first mentioned, is bounded on its irregular north-eastern frontier by the Rapti, which severs it from tahsils Deoria, Hata, and Gorakhpur; on the north, again, by the Gorakhpur Head-quarters tahsil, on the west by the Basti district; and on the south south-west by the Ghagra, which divides it from the Azamgarh district. Tahsil Bansgaon contains the parganahs of Anola, Dhuriapar, and Chilupar, with all except the two northern tappas of parganah Bhauapar. It had in 1878 a total area of 394,648 acres, or over 616 square miles; and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,30,279. Its population in 1872 was 345,401, or 563 persons to the square mile. But a detailed account of the tahsil will be found in the articles on its four parganahs.\n\nBarhaj, in tappa Raipur of parganah Salempur Majhauli, is the principal mart of the Gorakhpur district. It stands on the junction of several unmetalled roads and a cart-track, 41 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. Tradition mentions that the Ghagra and Rapti used once to meet nearly four miles west of the town. But the tendency of the confluence has ever been to follow eastwards the current of the two rivers. In 1873 they mingled their waters just opposite Gaura, less than two miles west of Barhaj; and Barhaj now stands on the Rapti, above its union with the Ghagra. The town had in 1872 a population of 4,970 persons, chiefly Brahmins, Kalwars, Mallahs, and Ahirs.\n\n\"Barhaj,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"is certainly the most thriving and about the dirtiest town in Gorakhpur. But besides its commercial importance, it has not a single feature of interest. From the Rapti it presents the appearance of a mass of squalid houses interspersed with the spires of a few Hindu temples. The river bank is covered with immense piles of wood, part for exportation, part for boat-building, which is an active trade, and the greater part to feed the furnaces of the numerous sugar factories. The only buildings even moder-\nately respectable are a brand new masonry police-station (first class) and a Government (halkabandi) school. At right angles to the river is one long street, which passes by a bridge over the foul Rakba watercourse\u2014the 'cloaca maxima' of Barhaj. This road was once metalled, but is now out of repair. As it approaches the river it loses itself in a maze of filthy lanes which wind on to the police-station and the gh\u00e2ts. The rest of the town consists of crooked irregular streets crammed with merchandise of all sorts.\n\n\"The school has about 60 boys on its rolls and an average attendance of about 40. All the pupils are from the poorer classes. None of the merchants' sons attend. One of the leading mah\u00e2jans remarked lately to the writer that they did not send their sons to school because they did not want Government service, which was the sole end of education. They prefer to let their sons sprawl about the shops and pick up the mah\u00e2jani alphabet from the clerks.\n\nOne of the principal trades of Barhaj is sugar-refining. It is carried on, according to the usual system, by boiling down the lumps of raw sugar (bheli) in an immense caldron (kar\u00e2h), skimming and filtering the syrup, and then coagulating it in earthen pots, finally dissolving the treacle from the saccharine particles by the moisture from a layer of river grass (siw\u00e2r). The process is rather rude and there is little regard to cleanliness. The sugar produced is of the coarse brown variety known as Chinose.\u00b9 Barhaj is the depot for all the sugar produced in parganahs Sidhua-Jobna, Salempur Majhauli, and Sh\u00e2hjah\u00e2npur. Dr. Planck ten years ago (1870) reckoned the number of factories at 40.\u00b2 A visitor who sees the town only in its squalid every-day state would be surprised to watch on a market day the enormous string of carts which crowd into the place and render traffic in the narrow lanes almost impossible. Cloth and vessels are largely imported and sold for local use or distribution to the smaller district marts. Since the license-tax was introduced a new industry has been started, that of preparing a second set of ledgers for the inspection of the assessing officer. The most enterprising merchants are a colony of M\u00e2rw\u00e2ris, and some Kalw\u00e2rs, Baniy\u00e2s, and Ir\u00e2k\u00ees. Some of the M\u00e2rw\u00e2ris do a good trade in insuring boats and cargoes from the danger of the snags and rapids of the R\u00e9pti and Gh\u00e2gra. The influence of the Barhaj trading classes in the neighbouring parts of the district is very large. They scatter advances through the villages for sugar and grain; and there are few threshing-floors or sugar-mills in the vicinity where one of their emissaries is not on guard during the harvest season. It must be admitted that the Barhaj dealers have rather an equivocal reputation. Judiciously managed bankruptcies are a regular trade.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 413, note. \u00b2 See above, page 412, table, \"Remarks\" column.\n\"In Barhaj sanitation and local improvements are at a very low level. As the trustee of the r\u0101ja of Majhauli, the owner of the place, Government has no funds to spare for conservancy or local works. The most pressing work is to clear a road straight down to the R\u0101pti landings and improve the town drainage. At present the refuse of the sugar refineries, added to the usual abominations of a native town, supply a bouquet of disgusting odours which Cologne could not rival.\"\n\nThe above description requires but little supplement. The Hindu temples therein mentioned are four or five modern structures dedicated to Mah\u0101deo or Siva. There is at least one good-looking modern mosque; and to the list of public institutions must be added the imperial post-office. A few masonry houses are occupied by leading merchants. Numerous but ill-kept wells tap water at a distance of 25 feet from the surface. Many of the sugar factories are really considerable buildings, enclosing extensive courtyards. The manufactured sugar is shipped in large quantities for Calcutta, but is not the only great export of Barhaj. The town is an important depot for the down-country distribution of grain. It in 1870 contained no less than 31 golas or granaries, courtyards surrounded with covered racks for the storage of the laden sacks. Amongst minor exports must be mentioned wood, oilseeds, and hides; amongst the imports iron, cloth, and salt. But something on this subject will be found in the account of trade and manufactures for the district generally.\n\nThe principal business quarters are Farehatta, Namakhatta or the salt-market, Dalhatta or the pulse-market, and Naya or New Bazar. At the east of the town is an extensive quarter of Mall\u0101hs or boatmen. Six hundred resident members of that caste earn their living by loading and unloading vessel with that grain. But at Gorakhpur and Dh\u0101ni, higher up the R\u0101pti, the numbers are only 250 and 100 respectively. The Rakba or Bh\u0101gar water-course joins the R\u0101pti, and its mouth forms a convenient dock for small shipping. On the R\u0101pti itself may be seen a little forest of masts.\n\nMarkets are held every Tuesday and Wednesday, and on the full moon of October-November (K\u0101rtik) Barhaj is enlivened by a fair. Near the town stand the villages of Gaura and Paina, where many of its merchants have villas. Though practically suburbs of Barhaj, these places will be described in separate articles. If their population be added to that of Barhaj, the result will be a total of 15,783 inhabitants.\n\nLegend derives the name of Barhaj from one Barahan or Barha-ji, a Br\u0101hma\u1e47 hermit who turned Musalm\u0101n. His supposed tomb is still an object of veneration. Later still lived\n\n1 Supra pp. 411-21. 2 Reports furnished by tahsildars to Mr. Alexander.\none Kunwar Dhir Sahi, who built here a castle. This stronghold is said to have been stormed and destroyed by Musalmans not long before the foundation of the modern town; but its ruins may still be seen. The founders of the existing Barhaj were the ancestors of the Majhauli raja, and its age is computed at about 110 years. Its rise to commercial prominence had been rapid. In 1870 Dr. Planck was informed that the first sugar factory had been started but 40 years before.\n\nBarhalganj, a small town in tappa Haveli of pargana Chillupar, stands on the crossing of the metalled Azamgarh and another unmetalled road, 36 miles south south-east of Gorakhpur. The former highway crosses the Ghagra just south of the town. Barhalganj was in 1872 inhabited by 4,449 persons.\n\nIt was formerly deemed to include four mullahas or quarters. The first, Lalganj, was called after the Lai Sahib, brother of the rebellious Bisen raja of Narharpur. The second was Kasba Barhal or Barhalganj proper. The third, Chillupar, which perhaps gave its name to the parganah, took that name from the fact that it lay across (par) a small stream styled the Chillu. In the fourth, Gola or the granary, a grain-market was formerly held. But the separate existence of the three quarters last named has been almost forgotten, and the terms Lalganj and Barhalganj may be considered nearly synonymous.\n\nThe town consists chiefly of a street of masonry shops lining the sides of the Azamgarh road. It has a fine metalled market-place flanked by stone drains. There is a famous temple sacred to Shiva as lord of Jalesar (Jalesar-Nath Mahadeo). Another thakurdwara, known as the Charanpaduka, is under the management of the prior of Paikauli (q.v.) A little distance north of the town, beside the Azamgarh road, the leading merchant Jagmohan Das has built a third temple. In the town itself is a fine masonry house belonging to the same citizen. Attached to the first-class police-station are Public buildings. a pretty garden and two mounted policemen, who patrol the road just mentioned. Barhalganj has also a parganah school, a hostel (sardai) for travellers, a dispensary, and an imperial post-office. Several fine groves surround the town; and the trimness with which its road and market-place are kept give it an exceptionally neat appearance. The House-tax. Chankidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force; and during 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 71 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 871. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 480), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 730. Of the 944 houses 225 were assessed with the tax, the incidence being Rs. 3-8-11 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-11 per head of population.\nBarhalganj has little trade of its own. But a good deal of traffic passes through it along the metalled road, on its way to or from the Gh\u00e1gra shipping, Azamgarh, or Benares. Retained between calcareous (kankar) banks, the Gh\u00e1gra is here unusually narrow. On the full moon of K\u00e1rtik (October-November) and the ninth of the bright half of Chait (March-April) large multitudes flock hither to bathe in the stream.\n\nUntil the rebellion of 1857 the market belonged to the r\u00e1ja of Narharpur, a village about one mile east of the town. On the confiscation of his property it was found that the dues brought in about Rs. 2,400 yearly. But Mr. Collector Young, under whose direct management the estate was placed, remitted the collections and imposed the house-tax already mentioned. The removal of what was virtually a transit duty gave a great impetus to the prosperity of the town; but Barhalganj is still behind Dohari, the Azamgarh mart on the opposite bank of the Gh\u00e1gra. Outside the town lie some lands known as \u00c1r\u00e1zi Barhalganj, which when confiscated were bestowed on the r\u00e1ja of Gop\u00e1lpur in reward for his mutiny services. He both mortgaged and sold them, an inconsistency which has led to long lawsuits not yet ended. Riots and disputes between the rival claimants have lately compelled the Collector to take this property also under direct management.\n\nBarhi,\u00b9 the site of a police-station and district post-office, stands on the left bank of the R\u00e1pti, in tappa R\u00e1jdh\u00e1ni of parganah South Haveli, 13 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,058 souls. The road from Gorakhpur to Barhi crosses the line of drainage from the R\u00e1mgarh and adjoining lakes, and is cut away every rainy season. It is not now kept under repair. The surrounding country is greatly exposed to inundation from the R\u00e1pti, and the soil is so sandy as to render the construction of buildings very difficult. It is proposed to transfer the third-class police-station to the adjoining village of Dihgh\u00e1t, which occupies a more elevated site. The first establishment of this station was due to the host of highwaymen which once infested the road. A short distance east of Barhi, in the villages of Tongri, Upadaulia, and R\u00e1jdh\u00e1ni kh\u00e1s, are the remains of a great city and fortress coeval with the Sahankot of Rudarpur, and said to be the home of the Maurya dynasty.\u00b2\n\nBelaharia, or Bela Haraiya, the site of a dispensary and post-office, lies in tappa Lehra of parganah North Haveli, on the road from Nichlaval to\n\n\u00b9 This and the five succeeding articles are chiefly from the pen of Mr. Crooke, of whose notes some advantage was taken also in the last. \u00b2 I.e., the dynasty of Chandragupta (Sendrakottos) and Asoka.\nKarmaini-gh\u00e1t, about 40 miles north north-west of Gorakhpur. It lies on the forest grant\\(^1\\) of Mr. J. H. Bridgman; and an excellent house is occupied by his resident agent, Mr. W. Palmer. Hard by stands S\u00e1hibganj b\u00e1z\u00e1r, an important mart for country produce. Bela Haraiya had in 1872 a population of 1,730 inhabitants.\n\nBelgh\u00e1t, a large agricultural village of the tappa so called in parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, stands on the junction of an unmetalled road and a cart-track, about 26 miles south south-west of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,513 persons. The village contains a first-class police-station and district post-office. It is the head-quarters of B\u00e1bu R\u00e1mavat\u00e1r Singh, a Kausik R\u00e1jput of the Gop\u00e1lpur family, who has a considerable estate in the neighbourhood. During the rains the place is difficult of approach from Gorakhpur, owing to the necessity of crossing the Ku\u00e1na river. There is nothing of any interest in Belgh\u00e1t. Its name implies that the Sarju or Gh\u00e1gra once flowed past it; and a late change of course has again brought the river within some two miles of the village.\n\nBel\u00edp\u00e1r, a police outpost on the metalled Azamgarh road, stands about 14 miles south of Gorakhpur, in tappa Kasw\u00e1nsi of parganah Bhan\u00e1p\u00e1r. It occupies the high ground overlooking the Ami\u00e1r lagoon. The embankment known as the \"Tucker bandh,\" which connects Bel\u00edp\u00e1r with Kaur\u00edr\u00e1m on the other side of the marsh, begins a short distance south of the outpost. The population of the village is 679 only.\n\nBh\u00e1galpur, a market village in tappa Ballia of parganah Salempur-Majhauli, crowns the left bank of the Gh\u00e1gra, 52 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 a population of 1,540 inhabitants. The place was evidently the site of a very ancient city. Apparently the ruins at Khair\u00e1g\u00e1rh, which are now on the Azamgarh bank of the river, were once conterminous with Bh\u00e1galpur, and have been separated from it by a change in the course of the Gh\u00e1gra. The ancient buildings on the Gorakhpur side have almost all disappeared, and only the ancient pillar described by Buchanan\\(^2\\) remains.\n\n\"Bh\u00e1galpur,\" writes that wordy author, \"is said to be a corruption of Bhargiwpur,\\(^3\\) and it is said to have been the residence of the family of Br\u00e1hmans which gave birth to Parasur\u00e1ma, the incarnation of Vishnu.\\(^4\\) Immediately below Bh\u00e1galpar the Dehwa (Gh\u00e1gra) has laid bare some masses of brick rubbish, and this may possibly be part of the family abode, the remainder of which has been swept away by the river; but the quantity of bricks is trifling, and they are usually considered by the natives as having belonged to a mud fort built above by Sudri\u00e1hta Nar\u00e1yan, a Kum\u00e1r or younger brother of the Bhojpur family who made some conquests in this part of the country. Near this fort, in a garden, is a stone pillar, which is a mere cylinder with a small flat cap, and totally\n\n\\(^1\\) Supra, pp. 286-87.  \n\\(^2\\) Eastern India, II, 364-66; see also Cunningham's Archaeological Survey Reports, I, 85-86.  \n\\(^3\\) I.e. the town of Bhargiwa Sarw\u00e1ris.\ndestitute of elegance. There are no traces of buildings round it, and a considerable portion is probably sunk in the ground. It has contained a long inscription in an ancient character, which the Pandits cannot entirely read, many of the letters being of obsolete forms. The inscription is besides very much defaced, partly by the action of time, and partly by some bigot having attempted to cut through the pillar just in the middle of the inscription. The zeal of this bigot was cooled before he cut half through the pillar, and if he wrought with a sword, as is usually alleged, he must have had considerable patience to cut so far. It is however commonly believed that he desisted from terror, blood having sprung from the stone when he made a gash in it with one blow of the sword. Some say that this zealous person was a Muhammadan; others give the honour to a Yogi. This latter opinion has probably arisen from some persons having carved above the inscription, in modern characters, the words 'Raj Yog,' 1007; but this, I am told, has no connection with a person of the order of Yogis, but implies accession to the Government, 1007. Neither the name of the person succeeding nor the era is mentioned, and the character being very different from the other part of the inscription, had even these circumstances been known, they would have thrown no light on the antiquity of the pillar. Many persons call it the staff (lath) or club (gada) of Parasurama; but others say that it belonged to Bhim, the supposed son of Pandu, and others allege that it was erected by Bhagadatta, of whom I made frequent mention in the account of Rangpur.\"\n\nDuring the last rains, 1879, the remains of an ancient masonry passage under the river are said to have been discovered. The head-quarters of a subdivision of the Opium Department, Bhagalpur has a good opium bungalow with weighing sheds and other offices. Its bathing fair on the full moon of Karttik (October-November) is attended by some 6,000 people.\n\nBhauapar, a parganah of the Bansgaon and Head-quarters tahsil, is bounded on its convex north-eastern frontier by the meandering Rapti, which divides it from parganahs Silhat and Haveli; on its concave south-western frontier by parganahs Maghar, Anola, and Dhuriapar; on its short eastern termination by Silhat; and on its short western termination by Maghar. A large portion of the boundary with Maghar and Anola is supplied by the Ami river and the Ami lagoon. Bhauapar is divided into seven tappas. Of these the two northern, Ret and Haveli, belong to the head-quarters tahsil. The five southern, Kuswansi, Pachasi, Gurhmi, Kota, and Gagaha, are a part of tahsil Bansgaon. The parganah contains 432 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza). It had in 1878 an area of 91,200 acres and a land revenue of Rs. 58,477.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 Bhauapar contained 280 inhabited sites, of which 151 had less than 200 inhabitants; 87 between 200 and 500; 29 between 500 and 1,000; 10 between 1,000 and 2,000; and 2 between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\n1 Granted however its existence, this passage must not be deemed an anticipation of Brunel's Thames-tunnelling feat. The passage did not run under the river, but the river has run over the passage. General Cunningham mentions a tradition that the Ghagra once flowed three miles north of Bhagalpur. 2 49,610 acres and Rs. 32,397 belong to the Bansgaon tahsil; 41,620 acres and Rs. 26,170 to the Head-quarters.\nThe population numbered 82,526 souls (39,000 females), giving 1,153 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 77,452 Hind\u00fas, of whom 36,660 were females, and 5,074 Musalm\u00e1ns (2,340 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shews 13,065 Br\u00e1hmans (7,228 females); 5,296 R\u00e1jputs (2,479 females); and 3,560 Baniyas, (1,706 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 12,444 souls (5,761 females).\n\nThe principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (12,867). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Ponw\u00e1r (1,292), Chandel, Sarnet, Sakarw\u00e1l, Bais, Kausik, Solankhi, and Chauhan. The Baniy\u00e1s belong to the K\u00e1ndu (1,460), Agarw\u00e1l, Agarahri, Baranw\u00e1r, Unai, and Kasundhan subdivisions. The most numerous among the \"other castes\" are the Bind, Dos\u00e1dh, Gound, Teli, Koeri, Ah\u00edr, Loh\u00e1r, Hajj\u00e1m, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Satw\u00e1r, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mull\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbhar, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Barai, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1si, Thatheri, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, B\u00e1ri, \u00c1tth, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kadera, Bharbhunja, and Beld\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (4,034), Sayyids (27), Path\u00e1ns (426), and unspecified.\n\nThe parganah is a long irregular strip of country with a maximum expanse of about 30 by 7 miles. The flatness of its surface is broken only by slight undulations whose ridges are often shaded by fine mango groves attributed to the Banj\u00e1ras. The soil is fairly productive; and of the 9,867 acres returned as its total area at settlement 66,290 were either cultivated or culturable. The soils are loam (doras) and sand (balwa). What is called clay (matti\u00e1r) is only found to a very limited extent in lowlying situations. The crops chiefly grown for the autumn harvest are bhada\u00edn or bhada\u00ed rice and maize; for the spring harvest the usual cereals, the usual pulses, and indigo. Until a few years ago at all events no sugarcane was raised. Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r is well drained by the R\u00e1pti and \u00c1mi, which meet at the junction of tappas Kusw\u00e1nsi and Gurhmi. The interfluvial tract including tappas Ret, Haveli, and Kusw\u00e1nsi, is much exposed to inundation not only from the rivers themselves, but from the Nawar and Nandaur lagoons. During the monsoon this part of the parganah is a continuous sheet of water, spanned between Belip\u00e1r and Kaurir\u00e1m police outposts by the magnificent embankment known as the Tucker Bandh. When the floods subside they leave a rich alluvial deposit; the beds of the smaller lagoons are sown with a winter crop; and the \u00c1mi shrinks into a narrow stream winding through fertile corn lands. The south of the parganah is as a rule higher and sandier,\n\n1 Sie in the Census report. Perhaps Gond is intended. 2 Supra p. 322. 3 Supra p. 307.\nwhile the spring crops are generally better than further north. Of the total cultivated area 61 per cent. is irrigated, chiefly from lagoons, artificial ponds, and former beds (dohar) of streams. But as water is very near the surface, temporary unbricked wells are easily dug.\n\nThe leading families are the Sarnet Rajputs of Pandepur, Balwan, and Landholding fami. Kota, the Palwar Rajputs of Gagaha, the Tiwari Brahmins of Saigaura, and the Pande Brahmins of Balwan.\n\nThe Naiks or Banjaras of Chauriya in tappa Gurhmi deal largely in cattle, and lend money and grain in the neighbourhood. The Satasi family has settlements in Gajpur and Bhauapar villages; and at the latter place are the ruins of a large castle on the highland overlooking the Rapti. It was above mentioned how in 1769, when a famine had killed the cattle, the tigers fell upon the inhabitants of Bhauapar. In the time of Buchanan (1835) the same beasts were still credited with slaying yearly some seven or eight people and 250 cattle of the neighbourhood. But the parganah has now been so long without tigers that it has almost forgotten their existence.\n\nThe chief commercial mart is Kalesar in tappa Ret, near the bank of the Rapti, and adjoining the metalled road from Gorakhpur to Basti. This lately established emporium is an important depot for the produce of the fertile parganah Maghar. Piprauli in the same tappa, south of Kalesar, is a thriving market, noted chiefly for the country cloth which is imported for sale from Gorakhpur, parganah Maghar, and the neighbouring villages. The minor bazars are Saraiya, Siwai, Gajpur, and Daunrpar. The parganah is thoroughly traversed by the metalled Basti and Azamgarh roads and their unmetalled feeders, while an additional trade-route is provided by the navigable Rapti.\n\nThe only remains of archaeological interest are the Satasi stronghold at Antiquities and Bhauapar and numerous mounds or other traces of old History. forts and villages attributed as usual to the Tharus. The Institutes of Akbar (1596) return Bhawapara as a parganah of the Gorakhpur division and Oudh province, with a State rental of Rs. 3,897 (1,55,900 d\u00e3ms). How greatly cultivation has since then extended is shown by the revenues imposed at modern British settlements. These were, at the first, Rs. 15,430; at the second, Rs. 14,721; at the third, Rs. 14,750; at the fourth, Rs. 17,253; and at the fifth, Rs. 40,904. The demand of the next or current assessment has been shown above.\n\nBinayakpur, the most northern parganah of the district and the Maharajganj tahsil, is bounded on the north north-east and west north-west by\n\n1 P. 436. 2 P. 343.\nNep\u00e1l, the boundary on the latter quarter being supplied by the Gh\u00fanghi river; on its irregular south south-western frontier by parganah Haveli; and on the south-east by the Jharri river, which severs it from parganah Tilpur. To distinguish it from Bin\u00e1yakpur of Basti, the parganah is sometimes called Bin\u00e1yakpur East. It is divided into three tappas, Mirchw\u00e1r, Nagw\u00e1n, and Sirsia; and contains 79 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza). Bin\u00e1yakpur had in 1878 an area of 93,116 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 17,111.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it contained 77 inhabited sites, of which 55 had less than 200 inhabitants; 18 between 200 and 500; 2 between 500 and 1,000; and 2 between 1,000 and 2,000. The population numbered 21,722 souls (10,409 females), giving 150 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 20,028 Hind\u00fas, of whom 9,600 were females; and 1,694 Musalm\u00e1ns (809 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 544 Br\u00e1hmans (222 females); 255 R\u00e1jputs (111 females); and 474 Baniy\u00e1s (217 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 18,755 souls (9,050 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (539). The chief R\u00e1jput clan is the Bais (127). The Baniy\u00e1s belong to the Agarw\u00e1l, K\u00e1ndu, Agarahri, and Kasaundhan sub-divisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Ah\u00edr (3,389), Hajj\u00e1m (1,525), Cham\u00e1r (2,177), and Kurmi (1,832). The following castes comprise less than one thousand members each: Dos\u00e1dh, Teli, Koer\u00ed, Loh\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, Son\u00e1r, Kah\u00e1r, Barhai, Barai, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1si, Thathera, B\u00e1nshphor, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, B\u00e1ri, At\u00edth, Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kum\u00e1r, Kori, and Baheliya. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (1,366), Sayyids (16), Mughals (5), Path\u00e1ns (243), and unspecified.\n\nAs a part or outskirt of the Sub-Him\u00e1layan Tar\u00e1\u00ed, Bin\u00e1yakpur is both wild and swampy. From the base of the lower Him\u00e1laya, some 15 miles distant, a series of rapid and roughly parallel streams flow down across its northern border. Excluding the Gh\u00fanghi and Jharri, already mentioned as mere boundaries, we find the west of the parganah traversed by the Gh\u00e1g\u00e1r, Danda, and Ainjar, tributaries of the former; the centre by the Rohin and its affluents, the Nidhi, Dhundi, Bhaghela, and Manauwa. The course of all these streams lies almost due southwards. The Gh\u00fanghi and Rohin, which rise in the hills themselves, are as usual\n\nThis estimate includes forest grants.\ndistinguished from other rivers by their high banks of accumulated alluvial matter. These banks slope rapidly down to the level of the surrounding country, the beds of the rivers being often, probably, raised above that level.\n\nOf the total area about 38,300 acres are or were jungle grants;\u00b9 about 23,200 are reserved Government forest. But before 1872 some 26,720 acres of the jungle grants had been brought under cultivation; and when the term of the last grant expires, in 1906, tillage will have still further extended. Including the area just mentioned, the total cultivation amounts to about 39,910 acres.\u00b2\n\nBut how small a fraction of the total area this represents may be seen by referring to the first paragraph. The parganah consists chiefly indeed of marsh and forest; and of these the eastern tappa Nagw\u00e1n is wholly composed. Here are numerous morasses growing long reeds, the resort of the tiger and wild buffalo; here probably may be found the origin of that malaria which makes Bin\u00e1yakpur East twice as feverish as its western namesake, although not so unhealthy as its eastern neighbour, Tilpur. But in the remaining tappas reclamation has of late years proceeded rapidly. Along the banks of the Gh\u00fanghi tillage has now reached the Nep\u00e1l frontier. Along, however, a considerable part of that frontier, the parganah is a dreary land of grass dotted near streams with a few trees. Hither at the end of the rainy season large flocks are brought for pasture. But as they return southwards, the drovers find pasture gradually give way to rice-fields and s\u00e1l forest to mango-groves. The owners of villages are chiefly Br\u00e1hmans, R\u00e1jputs, and Mongol-faced Th\u00e1rus; the peasantry are mostly of the caste last named, Kurmis and Ahirs. In their system of cultivation advantage is taken of the many streams, which are dammed and diverted through artificial channels (kula) to water the fields. The principal crops are for the autumn harvest late (jarhan) rice; for the spring harvest cereals and pepper. But the people assert that, owing to the \"coldness\" left in the soil by the rains, little of a spring harvest is realized.\n\nIts crops and timber are the parganah's only important products. But at its own little villages, such as Paisia and Sirsia, there is even in these little trade. Dh\u00e1ni, Nichlaval, and other marts of neighbouring parganahs are also the marts of Bin\u00e1yakpur. Of officially-recognized roads the parganah is entirely destitute.\n\nIn the fourteenth century, Bin\u00e1yakpur and Tilpur were colonized by the first r\u00e9ja of B\u00fatwal, now a town of Nep\u00e1l. This chief is said to have been a Chauh\u00e1n R\u00e1jput; but if the tradition of his History.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, pp. 286-88. \u00b2 Or 13,190 acres, excluding the cultivation of jungle grants. See Wynne's Settlement Report.\nmigration from Chittaur is to be trusted, was more likely to have been a Gahlot. His descendants intermarried with the Tharus and other hill-tribes; and at some date unknown a cadet of the family obtained Tilpur as a separate fief. Though the independence of the Tilpur rulers was never recognized, the separation between the two tracts continued. In the Ain-i-Akbari (1596) they are entered as separate parganahs of the Gorakhpur division (sarkar) and Oudh province (siba), Binayakpur being credited with a State rental of Rs. 15,000 (6,00,000 d\u00e3ms). The parganah was then, however, very much larger than now. It included, as it now does not, the eponymous village of Binayakpur. When the tract was transferred from Oudh to the East India Company (1801), the raja of B\u00fatwal was granted a money allowance in lieu of his claims on the ibadkars. But not many years afterwards the Nepalese ejected him from his hill domain of P\u00e1lpa, and in virtue of this conquest claimed and seized Binayakpur also. Their presumption was ultimately punished in the Nepalese war, and Binayakpur once more became British territory.\n\nBut in the course of the campaigns the population had been greatly strengthened by the influx of refugees from B\u00fatwal and the Tarai, and within the next twenty years Captain Stoneham was employed to bring this parganah and the neighbouring North Haveli into better cultivation. Lands were parcelled out, embankments were built, and channels for draining the marshes were dug. Thus began a work which has been toilsomely continued by the unassisted efforts of the people themselves.\n\nAfter the rebellion of 1857-58, the friendly services of the Nepalese were rewarded with a grant of territory which, extending to the northern frontier of Haveli, severed Binayakpur into two portions, east and west. On the formation of Basti (1865) the latter was included in that district. The first British assessment of the parganah took place in 1813, and the demands, then and since imposed, have been as follow:\u20141813, Rs. 520; 1839, Rs. 688; and 1864, Rs. 7,505.\n\nBiraicha, a village in tappa Biraicha of parganah Haveli, stands near the right bank of the Little Gandak river, 34 miles north-east of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to but 1,370; and Biraicha is remarkable only as the site of a third-class police-station and district post-office.\n\nBishanpur or Bishanpura is another small village noticeable for the same causes. It stands in tappa Patnipur of parganah Sidhua-Jobna, on an old bed of the Gandak and a cart-track, 62 miles east of Gorakhpur. Its police-station and post-office are of the same classes as those at Biraicha. But of its population, which is insignificant, the Magistrate-Collector is unable to supply details.\n\n1 Supra p. 407.\nCAPTAINGANJ, or Kaptanganj, a fairly thriving market village in tappa Parwarp\u00e1r of parganah South Haveli, stands on the junction of two unmetalled roads, 28 miles east-north-east of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 3,647 souls. The village, writes Mr. Crooke, was after the mutiny confiscated for the treason of its former owners, and the market has since remained in the hands of Government. A metalled road and masonry drains have been constructed. Hard by on the east flows the Little Gandak; and the place has a considerable trade in sugar and country produce, which is sent down that river to Patna and D\u00e1napur. Captainganj or Captain's market is the 2nd stage on the road from Gorakhpur to Padrauna. It has a good encamping-ground and an elementary school.\n\nCHAUMUKHA, a police out-post on the crossing of the unmetalled Gorakhpur-Lotan and Captainganj Karmain\u00edgh\u00e1t roads, lies in tappa Bhari of parganah North Haveli, 25 miles north of Gorakhpur. East of it rises a dense, but somewhat stunted sal forest. The population amounted in 1872 to 933 only; and the place is only noticeable as a halting-place on the junction of two important highways. It derives its name from a well with a tall four-faced platform, said to have been built by a former district officer as a traveller's refuge from the numerous wild elephants which then haunted the neighbourhood.\n\nCHaura, or Chaura Chauri, a village in tappa Ke\u00fatali of parganah South Haveli, stands on the unmetalled Gorakhpur and Deoria road, 16 miles south-east of the former place. It was in 1872 inhabited by 132 persons only. But Chaura has a third-class police-station, a district post-office, a small hostel (s\u00e1rd\u00ed) for travellers, a cattle pound, and an elementary school. It occupies some high ground overlooking a great depression which is flooded in the rains. When in early winter the water subsides, fever is prevalent. The village contains so few grain-dealers' shops that supplies must be brought a considerable distance.\n\nCHILLUPAR, the smallest parganah of the district and the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsil, is bounded on the north-east by the R\u00e1pti, which severs it from parganahs Salempur and Silhat; on the west north-west by parganahs Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r and Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r; and on the south by the Gh\u00e1gra, which divides it from the Azamgarh district. It is divided into five tuppas, Majhaulia, Semra, Haveli, Kasba, and Sikandarpur; and amongst these are distributed 210 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza). Parganah Chillup\u00e1r had in 1878 an area of 70,636 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 42,070.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it contained 163 inhabited sites, of which\n\n| Population | Number |\n|------------|--------|\n| less than 200 | 88     |\n| between 200 and 500 | 50    |\n| between 500 and 1,000 | 19   |\n| between 1,000 and 5 |  |\n\n1 From whose notes this and the two following articles are taken.\n2,000; and one (Barhalganj) between 3,000 and 5,000. The population numbered 48,919 souls (22,342 females), giving 203 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 45,923 Hind\u00fas, of whom 20,963 were females, and 2,996 Musalm\u00e1ns (1,379 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 8,025 Br\u00e1hmans (3,602 females); 3,510 R\u00e1jputs (1,629 females); and 1,516 Baniy\u00e1s (731 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 32,872 souls (15,001 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman subdivision found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (7,931). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Ponw\u00e1r (323), Chandel, Bais, and Kausik. The Baniy\u00e1s belong to the following sub-divisions: K\u00e1ndu (726), Agarw\u00e1l, Agarahri, Barasw\u00e1r, Unai, and Kasaundhan. The most numerous among the other castes are the Bind, Dos\u00e1dh, Gound, Teli, Koeri, Ah\u00edr, Loh\u00e1r, Hajjam, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Satw\u00e1r, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Barayi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1si, Thathera, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e1gi, B\u00e1ri, Atith, Khatik, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kadera, Bharbhunja, Bold\u00e1r, Kum\u00e1r, and Kori. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (2,559), Sayyids (56), Path\u00e1ns (137), and unspecified.\n\nThe plain of Chill\u00fap\u00e1r forms the point of the wedge between R\u00e1pti and Gh\u00e1gira. Through it, after furnishing for some distance the boundary with Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, the Taraina runs on to join the former river. The chief geographical feature is the wealth of large lagoons, which filling in the rainy season become almost dry before the end of the hot. Of such reservoirs the greatest is the Bhewri, through which the Taraina flows. From them and artificial ponds the fields obtain most of their water. Except in the west of tappa Haveli, wells are devoted almost solely to garden crops. But an additional source of fertilizing moisture is found in the Taraina, which as it becomes stagnant is dammed for irrigation. A little over 40 per cent. of the cultivated area is watered. The parganah is perhaps the most highly cultivated in the district. No less than 45,331 acres were at settlement (1861) returned as tilled or arable. But arable waste is rare, and no traces of forest are left. The soils are loam (doras) and sand (balua), clay being unknown. The sand along the bank of the Gh\u00e1gira is extremely light and poor.\n\nAs the water recedes towards the centres of the lagoons, their edges are sown with rice. This and indigo are the principal crops of the scanty autumn harvest. The spring harvest, which is by far the most important, consists mostly of wheat, barley, garden-crops, and the pulses mas\u00far, gram, and arhar. A\n\n1 See article on parganah Bhaudg\u00e1r, \"Population,\" note. * Supra p. 304.\nlittle sugarcane is grown. Though said to be of comparatively recent introduction, manure is highly prized. The soil is no longer so fresh as in other parts of Gorakhpur, and requires restoratives.\n\nIts agricultural raw produce is Chill\u00fap\u00e1r's only noteworthy product. When not sold at Barhalganj, Semra, or some other local mart, this can be exported to other districts by the R\u00e1pti. But one metalled and one unmetalled road connect the parganah also with Gorakhpur, Barhaj and Gola, in the district itself.\n\nThe earliest traditional masters of the parganah were as usual the Bhars. It is said that they were expelled about the middle of the fourteenth century by Dhur Chand Kausik, first r\u00e1ja of Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r. In the end of the sixteenth or beginning of the seventeenth, quarrels amongst his descendants enabled Bern\u00e1th Singh Bisen of Semra to seize most of Chill\u00fap\u00e1r, and to assume from that tract the title of r\u00e1ja.\\(^1\\) From the time of this annexation Chill\u00fap\u00e1r probably dates its existence as a separate pargana. It is entered in the Institutes of Akbar (1596) as a separate mah\u00e1l of the Gorakhpur division and Oudh province, with a State rental of Rs. 7,232 (2,89,302 d\u00e1ms). The same authority mentions that at Chill\u00fap\u00e1r village is a brick fort. On its transfer from Oudh to the Company the parganah was included in its present district. The demands assessed on the parganah at successive British settlements have been at the first, Rs. 12,283; at the second, Rs. 12,145; at the third, Rs. 14,204; at the fourth, Rs. 14,543; and at the fifth, Rs. 31,257. The present demand of the next or current settlement has been shown above.\n\nDeoria, the head-quarters of the tahsil so named, is a town of tappa Deoria, in the north of parganah Salempur. Through it passes an unmetalled road from Gorakhpur, 33 miles distant on the north-west. The population of 1872 was 1,069. But this estimate includes as usual the inhabitants of several separate villages which together form the nominal town.\n\nDeoria has a tahs\u00edl, a third-class police-station, a munsif's court, an imperial post-office, and an excise godown. Proposals were once made for removing the office first named to Musela or Salempur. It was formerly located at Mahuadih in Silhat, where the remains of one of the round towers formerly used for the deposit of Government treasure are still visible. Plans for the abolition of the excise godown have been based on the statements that the water of the neighbourhood is unsuitable for the manufacture of liquor, and that the demand for liquor is small.\n\n\\(^1\\) The r\u00e1jas of Chill\u00fap\u00e1r lived at Narharpur, near Barhalganj, and on that account were sometimes styled the Narharpur r\u00e1jas. Their title became extinct in 1858, when the last r\u00e1ja was convicted of rebellion.\nAbout half a mile from the sandy hillock on which stands the tahsil may be seen the village of Mehra. Here is the market-place of Deoria. The only modern institution which remains to be mentioned is the encamping-ground. Near it in a field lies the grave of a British soldier who died here at the time of the expedition to Paina.\n\nAccording to General Cunningham the name of Deoria is commonly applied to some place which contains a temple or other holy building. Mr. Crooke notes that in the village of Bharauli, about a mile north of the town, and on a mound beside the Kurna watercourse, are an old statue of Shiva and the remains of what was probably a temple. \"In the next village, Bamhni, south of the Kurna, there are more extensive ruins. It is said that about ten years ago one Rikhai Tiwari, of the adjoining village of Pinra, dreamt that there were some images in the mounds of Bamhni. He proceeded to dig and ultimately found an ancient lingam and argha and a small black stone image about a foot high, now known as the Bhagawati. The moulded black foundations of two old temples are visible. West of these temples is an ancient tank about 40 yards square; and up to the temples there are remains of what was apparently a flight of masonry bathing stairs. North of the Bhagawati temple is a very old pipal tree.\n\n\"At the other side of the Kurna, where the Gorakhpur road crosses the water-course, are the remains of some Oudh governor's fort. The moat is still clearly traceable. On the top is a Musalm\u00e1n tomb called the 'martyr man (shahid mard).' Here the country people make petty offerings, but none can say whom the grave contains.\"\n\nDeoria tahsil will be described in the article on its single parganah Salempur, with which it is co-extensive and identical.\n\nDhani, an important market in tappa Rigoli of parganah North Haveli, stands on the meeting of two cart-tracks, 33 miles north north-west of Gorakhpur. The market-place really lies in Khanap\u00e1r, from which Dh\u00e1ni is a separate village. But it is always known as Dh\u00e1ni b\u00e1z\u00e1r. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,913, or including that of Khanap\u00e1r to 4,886; but this population fluctuates from season to season.\n\nFor Dh\u00e1ni stands just west of the Dhamela. During most of the year this stream flows quietly about 30 feet below the level of its banks, which are steep and well defined; and at such seasons the place is crowded with traders.\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, Mutiny History.  \n2 Arch. Surv. Reports, I., 65.  \n3 The lingam is the phallic emblem of Shiva. The argha is the boat-shaped metal vessel from which libations are poured.  \n4 Not to be confused with the Khanap\u00e1r in parganah Salempur.\nBut during the rains the river rises, and at many points overflows its banks. Floods and the violence of the current put a stop to trade and navigation; and the merchants return home to Gorakhpur, Barhaj, or elsewhere. The trade, which is Dh\u00e1ni's chief claim to notice, has been described above. Its landlords, chiefly R\u00e1jputs and Br\u00e1hmans, derive from its market a large income. The streets are rather narrow, and the Dhamela landing might well be improved. The surrounding fields are very fertile, and let at rents which in some cases rise to Rs. 12 or 14 per acre. This rate is for Gorakhpur high indeed; and is perhaps demanded because the land produces about the best potatoes in the district. Near the town is a large lagoon which affords good fishing.\n\n**Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r**, the largest parganah of the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsil, is bounded on the east by parganahs Chill\u00fap\u00e1r and Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, and on the north by parganah Anola, all of its own tahsil; on the north-west by the Basti district; and on the south south-west by the shifty Gh\u00e1gra, which divides it from the district of Azamgarh. The parganah occupies, in fact, the south-western corner of its district. It contains the 24 tappas of P\u00e1li, Tiar, Gur or Gaur, D\u00e1ndi, Nahuri or Narrai, Kohara, Ath\u00e1isi, Majuri, Khutahan, Barhaj, Ch\u00e1ndp\u00e1r, Karmaut or Karm\u00fat, Bhabn\u00fali, Sh\u00e1hpur, Bhad\u00e1r, Parsi, Usri, Th\u00e1thi, Nak\u00fari or Nakauri, Chodur or Chorur, Haveli, Bankat, Ratanpur, and Belgh\u00e1t.\n\nOf these all except the last and largest lie north-east of the Ku\u00e1na river. Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r is divided also into 1,213 of the revenue divisions known as villages (*mauza*). It had in 1878 an area of 203,099 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,12,181.\n\nIn it, according to the census of 1872, were 945 inhabited sites, of which Population. 666 had less than 200 inhabitants; 232 between 200 and 500; 36 between 500 and 1,000; 9 between 1,000 and 2,000; and one between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants was Mad\u00e1riya or Gola, with a population of 5,147.\n\nThe inhabitants numbered 177,692 souls (82,153 females), giving 261 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 167,235 Hind\u00fas, of whom 77,253 were females; 10,454 Musalm\u00e1ns (4,895 females); and 3 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 28,101 Br\u00e1hmans (13,123 females); 8,969 R\u00e1jputs (4,166 females); and 4,321 Baniy\u00e1s (1,976 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 125,844 souls (57,993 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (27,127). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Ponw\u00e1r (346),\n\n---\n\n1 Fp. 414-418.\nChandel, Bais, Kausik, and Chauhan. The Baniyas belong to the following sub-divisions: Kandu (887), Agarwal, Agarshri, Barauna, Unai, and Kasaudhan. The most numerous amongst the other castes are the Bind, Dosadh, Teli, Koeri, Ahir, Lohar, Hajjam, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kahar, Satwar, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mallah, Nuniya, Kayath, Musahar, Kalwar, Sunar, Kamangar, Kahar, Barhai, Barayi, Bh\u00e1t, Pasi, Thathera, Mali, Bansphor, Bairagi, Bari, Atith, Khatik, Khakrob, Kis\u00e1n, Halwai, Kadera, Bharbhunja, Kumhar, Kori, Baheliya, Gosain, and Jaiswar. The Musalmans are Shaikhs (2,250), Sayyids (1,612), Mughals (49), Pathans (814), and unspecified.\n\nThe parganah is a rather fertile plain, of whose total area 143,215 acres were in 1865 either culturable or cultivated. Its staple crop is that of the spring harvest. Now, as that crop requires plenty of irrigation, 81 per cent. of the cultivated land is watered. The water is drawn from lagoons, small ponds, wells, and streams. The lagoons are never large; but the largest are at Kasoh and Nenua in tappa Chandpur and at Karpaicha in tappa Tiwar. The two former are silting up. The parganah is first bounded, and afterwards traversed, by two streams flowing south-east towards the Ghagra. Of these the most northerly is the Taraina, for a short distance the frontier with Anola. Running between raviney banks, it is on the close of the rains dammed for irrigation. The other and larger river, the Kuana, is for a few miles the boundary with Basti. Its lower reaches are navigable at all seasons; but in the drier months by light craft only. This Kuana divides Dhuriapar into two rather different portions. The kachar or alluvial lowlands of tappa Belghat and the bangaar, uplands or remainder of the area. The lowlands clearly owe their origin to the deposits of the Ghagra, which from year to year and place to place still shifts across them. Owing to this fact, and to the great sandiness of their soil, they have never been brought into perfect cultivation. They are covered in places by tall wild grasses, and by picturesque palmyras, which in ancient days were called the kings of grasses (trinaraja). But except tappa Khutahan, this is the only tract in which sugarcane is systematically cultivated. Even here there are no sugar factories. The cane is eaten raw, or its juice is merely boiled down into the coarse treacly syrup known as gur. Throughout the lowlands water lies near the surface, but in the uplands its distance increases to about 18\u00bd feet.\n\nThe uplands, writes Mr. Crooke, are \"a fairly flat tract consisting generally of doras or light loam, well adapted for the cultivation of the Bhadui or autumn rice and the usual spring\n\n1 Probably intended for Baranwar, i.e., Baniyas of Bulandshahr.\n2 And the Ghagra, where that river has usurped the Kuana's bed.\ncereals. In some parts poppy is extensively grown, but the deficiency of large towns does not encourage the cultivation of vegetables, for which the soil is well adapted. As in most of the district there is nothing grand or striking about the scenery. A glimpse of the Himalayan snows can occasionally be seen on a clear morning in the cold weather. The horizon is shut in on all sides by splendid mango groves, amidst which red-tiled hamlets nestle, each graced by a lordly pipal or bargad tree or surrounded by clumps of feathery bamboos. But the landscape has a quiet grace of its own when seen under an unclouded sky in the winter months. At this season the young crops cover the country with one sheet of green, varied only by the yellow flowers of the mustard. The sole exception to the general fertility is an \u00fatar or saline plain extending over some 2,000 acres at the junction of tappas Gaur, Ch\u00e1ndp\u00e1r, and Kurmaunt. Traversed and gnawed into ravines by a small watercourse called the Kach\u00e1ni, this tract is still haunted by herds of blue-bull which damage the neighbouring crops.\n\n\"The most remarkable fact in connection with the recent history of Shifting of the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r is the change in the course of the Gh\u00e1gra, which Gh\u00e1gra. occurred about eight years ago. Formerly this river met the south-western corner of the parganah at the village of Majd\u00edp. Thence, taking a south-eastern course, it wound round by the villages of Shi\u00fapur Raushanganj and Urdiha, and met the Ku\u00e1na at the village of Narhon, about 2 miles southeast of the important commercial mart of Gola. But about the year 1871-72 it suddenly changed its bed and burst away due east from Majd\u00edp, through a series of marshes and lowlying land, until it met the Ku\u00e1na under the present town of Sh\u00e1hpur or Bil\u00e1on Khurd. Thenceforward the Gh\u00e1gra and Ku\u00e1na became one stream, and the old bed of the Ku\u00e1na was considerably widened. The effect of this change has been to sever from the rest of the parganah over a third of tappa Belgh\u00e1t. The tract so severed, which now lies on the \u00c1zamgarh side of the deep stream of the Gh\u00e1gra, has a maximum length from east to west of about 13 miles, and a maximum breadth from north to south of about 4. At the recent alluvial settlement it became a question whether or not this portion of the parganah should be transferred to \u00c1zamgarh. It was finally decided to retain it as part of Gorakhpur for the following reasons:\u2014Its transfer would have involved sending the records to \u00c1zamgarh and necessitated a re-adjustment of police and revenue jurisdictions. Most of the proprietors, moreover, live in the Gorakhpur district and fined it more convenient to do their business there. Up to the present (1880) the Gh\u00e1gra\n\n\u00b9Mr. Alexander remarks that the groves are not quite so fine as in Anola or Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r.\nhas year after year changed its course. Its latest tendency is to push once more southwards, and resume its former channel by gradual erosion of the entire intervening country. The soil being a very unstable alluvium, all hope of controlling the movements of the river has been abandoned. The change in its course has caused enormous loss to the proprietors of the villages which have been destroyed; and Government has of course been compelled to make extensive remissions of revenue.\n\n\"The parganah contains few objects of antiquarian interest. At Dhuri\u00e1-\n\nAntiquities. p\u00e1r proper, which is said to take its present name from a somewhat mythical R\u00e1ja Dh\u00far Chand, there are the ruins of an enormous fort on the left bank of the Ku\u00e1na. This, like all similar ruins in this district, is traditionally assigned to a Bhar or Th\u00e1ru dynasty. All really known is that it was for long occupied as their headquarters by the Kausik R\u00e1jputs, who have divided into the two families now residing at Gop\u00e1lpur and Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r. Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r is marked on the settlement maps as Bhad\u00e1r Kh\u00e1s, in tappa Bhad\u00e1r, at the extreme north of the parganah. Here is a series of enormous mounds, evidently marking the site of a very extensive city. The place has not yet, it is believed, been properly explored. Some of the mounds may perhaps represent the sites of temples. The writer at a recent visit could find no inscriptions or images in the neighbourhood. It is suggested that the remains are of the early Brahmanical period.\n\n\"The chief families in the parganah are the Kausik R\u00e1jputs of Leading families. Gop\u00e1lpur and Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r. Both have lost most of their importance in modern times. The Gop\u00e1lpur family is now represented by Dulhin Harp\u00e1l Kunwari, nephew's wife of the late R\u00e1ja Krishna Kishor Chand, who distinguished himself for loyalty in the mutiny. At the time of that rebellion the Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r r\u00e9ja was Tej Part\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur Chand, who when accused of treason absconded. After a wandering exile of some 14 years, he was finally allowed to return. His estates and title were confiscated, the former being made over to Jhagru Tiw\u00e1ri, the loyal landholder of R\u00e1jgarh in tappa Narri. The present representative of this grantee, who near the end of the rebellion was killed in a skirmish at Ch\u00e1nd\u00edpur gh\u00e1t on the Gh\u00e1gra, is R\u00e1mpal Tiw\u00e1ri. The Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r family now hold but half their original estate. This moiety, which was entered on the revenue-roll in the name of the R\u00e1ni, escaped confiscation. The R\u00e1ni has\n\n1 The former name of the parganah, and presumably of the village also, is said to have been Sherpur. But it is altogether unlikely that the Persian word Sher or Lion could have been imported into the district before the present name was crystallized. Dh\u00far Chand is supposed to have lived in the fourteenth century. The first invasion of the Persian-speaking Muslims took place much later. Supra pp. 434, 439.\nadopted as heir her nephew L\u00e1endar Bah\u00e1dur Chand, commonly called the Lallan S\u00e1hib. The Sikr\u00edganj domain is held by a family of Pind\u00e1ris who were settled here after the great Central India campaign. They are now represented by Muhammad Sh\u00e1h and Muhammad Y\u00e1r Kh\u00e1ns, who arrogate to themselves the title of Naw\u00e1b. They receive the usual seignioralty (m\u00e1l\u00edk\u00e1na) of ten per cent. on the revenue of the domain, which has been resettled by Birtiyas and other under-proprietors. Another branch of the Kausik family is settled at Belgh\u00e1t and is now represented by R\u00e1mawat\u00e1r S\u00e1hi, a man of considerable influence in this part of the district. Other leading Kausik families are the B\u00e1bus of M\u00e1l\u00e1np\u00e1r and Jaswantpur in Tappa Bhabn\u00fali, and of H\u00e1ta in tappa Majuri. Amongst Br\u00e1hmans the chief families are the Shukuls of M\u00e1nkor and Kak\u00e1\u00edjkor in tappa Majuri and the P\u00e1ndes of Sariya. Most of the proprietors are Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs. The villages are generally broken up into petty shares. The proprietors occupy the best lands as home-farm. Rent-rates are low except near Gola, Rs. 2 or 3 per bigha being the prevailing rate. Like most of the Gorakhpur proprietors, the people are extremely litigious. This evil is increased by the smallness of the shares. Widows' inheritances and alluvial lands are fertile causes of litigation. Crime is rare, and very few serious offences ever occur.\n\n\"There is no specially noted shrine in the parganah. Before the change in the course of the river the chief bathing-place was Narhon in tappa Barhaj. Now the chief scenes of religious ablution are Bisra gh\u00e1t, Jhapatiya gh\u00e1t and Sh\u00e1hpur. The enormous profits of the grain trade have lately enabled the Gola merchants to erect several Shiv\u00e1las and other temples. Such are those built by Buddhu Kalw\u00e1r and being built by Hann\u00e1n Kalw\u00e1r. The latter promises to be, when complete, a very magnificent building. Dulhin Harp\u00e1l Kunwari is raising a fine temple at Bisra gh\u00e1t, a mile west of Gola.\n\n\"There are few or no manufactures in the parganah. The indigo factory at Beuri, adjoining Gola, formerly the property of Mr. Goutier, is now owned by Messrs. Moran and Co. of Calcutta. There is a branch concern at Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r proper. The parganah contains 21 places where markets are held. The chief grain marts are Gola-Gop\u00e1lpur in tappa Barhaj, formerly on the Ku\u00e1na, but now on the Gh\u00e1gra; and Dhakwa B\u00e1z\u00e1r on the Ku\u00e1na in tappa Bhad\u00e1r. The former belongs to the Gop\u00e1lpur, and the latter to the Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r family. From both are exported by river large quantities of wheat,\n\n1 Supra p. 398. 2 The title is not recognized by Government. 3 Gorakhpur-Basti Settlement Report, I, 46-47.\nlinseed, and rice. Next to these Mr. Lumsden mentions Bil\u00e1on Khurd. The minor markets for country produce are Uruwa in tappa Kurmaut, Sikr\u00edganj in tappa Parsi, Jhalia, K\u00fanri and At\u00e1nagar in tappa Belgh\u00e1t, Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r proper in tappa Bankat, and M\u00e1lanp\u00e1r in tappa Bhabnauli. Asaunji in tappa Th\u00e1thi is famous for excellent g\u00e1rha cloth. Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r is the only parganah in the district which produces the wood of the bab\u00fal acacia. This is extensively exported for making the beds of sugar-mills (kolhu).\n\n\"There is little or no shooting. A few herds of nilg\u00e1i and wild-pig frequent the diw\u00e1ra of the Gh\u00e1gira. The numerous small ponds and marshes are in winter a favourite haunt of snipe and the various kinds of wild-duck. The Gh\u00e1gira produces excellent fish, the chief of which are the bhakura, rohu, and parhin. It abounds with gavyals and crocodiles; and on the wide sandbanks immense flocks of wild geese congregate in the cold weather.\"\n\nWe have already seen that the history of the parganah begins with its colonization by Kausik R\u00e1jputs in the fourteenth century.\n\nAt the end of the sixteenth it is entered in the Ain-i-Akbari as a parganah of the Gorakhpur sark\u00e1r and Oudh province, with a State rental of Rs. 37,942 (15,17,708 d\u00e1ms). But by this time the internecine quarrels between the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r branches of the Kausik tribe had enabled a Bisen to sever and annex Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r (q.v.) Similar annexations continued until, at the close of the civil war, Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r had lost 16 out of its 40 tappas. The feud was at length suppressed by the Naw\u00e1b of Oudh, probably in the second quarter of the eighteenth century. Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r and Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r then became, as above mentioned, separate principalities. But the effects of long war and anarchy were still visible for nigh a hundred years afterwards.\u00b9\n\nThe parganah was not brought into proper tillage until long after its neighbours Anola and Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r. But cultivation may now be said to have reached its average margin. The progress which has taken place since the fourth British settlement of land revenue (1813) may be shown by the amounts of the demands imposed before and after that assessment. Those demands were:\u2014at the first settlement, Rs. 44,907; at the second, Rs. 41,947; at the third Rs. 37,743; at the fourth, Rs. 40,358; at the fifth, Rs. 88,436; and at the sixth or current (1865) Rs. 1,12,391. It will be observed that at the third assessment (1809) the demand was actually less than in the reign of Akbar.\n\nFak\u00edr ki kothi, or the Hermitage, is the site of a police outpost on the unmetalled road to H\u00e1ta, 6 miles east of Gorakhpur. The Magistrate-Collector\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Lumsden asserts in his settlement report that the parganah had not altogether recovered even at the time of the last settlement (1835).\nis unable to discover in his office any record of the population by the last census.\n\nGAGAHA,\\(^1\\) a police outpost in tappa Gagaha of parganah Bhau\u00e1pur, stands on the metalled road from Gorakhpur to Benares, 26 miles from the former. This place, which in 1872 had but 159 inhabitants, is the headquarters of the Palw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs. Sir Henry Elliot is wrong in fixing the Palw\u00e1r Chaur\u00e1si in Anola.\\(^2\\) It is really in tappa Gagaha. The Palw\u00e1rs are said to have originally held but 84 bighas of land, which increased by conquest to 84 villages. They speak of \"unch\u00e1s kos-ki-bh\u00e1t,\" meaning that kinsmen from 49 kos distance attend their weddings and other ceremonies. But the 49 kos are thus reckoned:\n\n| Asamgarh district | Kauriya | ... | ... | 7 |\n|-------------------|---------|-----|-----|---|\n|                   | Chhota Gop\u00e1lpur | ... | ... | 7 |\n|                   | Atraulia | ... | ... | 7 |\n| Faizabad ditto    | Birhar   | ... | ... | 14 |\n|                   | Surharpar | ... | ... | 7 |\n| Gorakhpur ditto   | Gagaha   | ... | ... | 7 |\n| Total             |          |     |     | 49 |\n\nThey also have the phrase \"unch\u00e1s kos-ki-kumak,\" thereby boasting that they can get help from 49 kos. They were a most turbulent tribe. In the mutiny they attacked a party of Gurkhas escorting treasure. The story is that the Gurkhas threw a box of rupees among them, and, while they were seizing its contents, flung a shell filled with pepper over them, and then attacked them while they were still in a stupefied state. A number of Palw\u00e1rs were taken prisoners, of whom all were beheaded with the deadly Nep\u00e1lese knife (kukari), as the people say, \"like so many goats.\" The villages of the defeated party were burnt, and a great part of their land was afterwards confiscated for rebellion. The Palw\u00e1rs have never held up their heads since. Gagaha has an elementary Government school and a very ancient masonry well. Nodular limestone (kankar) is found in its neighbourhood.\n\nGAJPUR, a small town on the right bank of the R\u00e1pti, in tappa R\u00e1mp\u00far Kota of parganah Bhau\u00e1pur, lies 18 miles in a direct line south south-east of Gorakhpur.\\(^3\\) It in 1872 had 3,210 inhabitants.\n\nGajpur once possessed a police out-post; and the Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is still in force. During 1877-78, the house tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 179 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 587. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 205), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 343. Of the 590 houses in the village, 149 were assessed with the tax, the incidence being Rs. 2-11-10 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-7 per head of population.\n\n\\(^1\\) This and the following article have been kindly contributed by Mr. Crooke. \\(^2\\) Beames' Elliot, II., 61. \\(^3\\) Twenty-five miles by road.\nGajpur has not much trade, and is in fact little better than a halting-place for boats on the R\u00e9pti. Nearly opposite the village a bank of nodular limestone runs across the river. This, which is a serious impediment to boats, it has been proposed to remove by mining. The place belongs to the Sat\u00e1si domain. Near the river is a ruinous kot or castle occupied by the widow of the L\u00e1l S\u00e1hib, son of the late attainted R\u00e1j\u00e1 of Satasi. The castle was built by R\u00e1ni Soh\u00e1s Kunwari, grand-mother of the L\u00e1l S\u00e1hib.\n\nGaura, a western suburb of Barhaj, stands on the unmetalled road between that place and Barhalganj, 39 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 5,482 souls. Musalm\u00e1ns are rare; but Mall\u00e1hs and other persons earning their livelihood by traffic on the R\u00e9pti are common. The place contains also many R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, Kurmis, Kalw\u00e1rs or distillers, Sun\u00e1rs or metallurgists, and Lunias or saltpetre-workers. Though Gaura is a suburb of Barhaj, and though both are parts of parganah Salempur, the former is situate in a tappa (Kaparw\u00e1r) different from that of the latter.\n\nGaura has several chini sugar-factories; but Barhaj absorbs most of the trade which might otherwise belong to it. The Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force; and during 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, together with a balance of Rs. 236 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 1,094. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 593), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 783. Of the 1,063 houses in the town 130 were assessed with the tax, the incidence being Rs. 2-9-7 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-2 per head of population. Except, perhaps, two temples of Shiva, Gaura can boast no noticeable buildings.\n\nIts name is somewhat laughably derived from the Arabic ghaur, reflection\u2014the reflection being that of the Majhauli R\u00e1ja when asked to permit the foundation of the town. But Gaura was probably christened in much the same manner as Gauda or Gonda of Oudh and Gaur of Bengal. Some connection with Gaur R\u00e1jputs or Br\u00e1hmans may be suspected.\n\nGh\u00e1ti, a village in the tappa so named of parganah Salempur, stands in the fork between Khanua and Little Gandak rivers, about 45 miles in a direct line south-east-by-east of Gorakhpur.\n\nThe population amounted in 1872 to 913 only, and about the village itself there is nothing interesting. It contains, however, a second-class police-station and district post-office. The surrounding country is very fertile and well cultivated, growing large quantities of sugarcane, poppy, and other valuable crops. During the rains, owing to floods from the Chhota Gandak and its tributaries, the approach to the village is difficult.\nGOLA, Mad\u00e1ria or Gola-Gop\u00e1lpur, a flourishing town of tappas Ch\u00e1ndp\u00e1r and Barhaj in parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, stands on what was once the bank of the Ku\u00e1na and is now the bank of the Gh\u00e1gra. On it converge three unmetalled roads from Gorakhpur, 33 miles distant on the north; and one of these continues its way to Barhalganj and Barhaj. By the last census (1872) the population mustered 5,147; but, since the change in the course of the Gh\u00e1gra, must have very greatly increased. The most influential caste is the Kalw\u00e1r, to which most of the local merchants belong.\n\nSome fine groves which surround, and the river which flows past it, give Gola an appearance which at a distance is decidedly pleasing. A nearer inspection is not so satisfactory. In spite of the house-tax imposed some years ago for conservancy and other purposes, there is still room for improving the tidiness and fragrance of the town. Gola consists of one narrow straggling street of shops running parallel to the Gh\u00e1gra and separated from it by a thick mass of mud houses, through which a network of narrow lanes leads down to the river landings. There are five muhallas or quarters, viz., (1) Bh\u00edkh\u00edganj, said to derive its name from the metallurgists' (Sunar's) shops which used once to abound in it; (2) R\u00fah\u00e1ta, or the cotton-market; (3) Baramth\u00e1n; (4) D\u00e1ldahi; and (5) Anjaiganj, or the grain-market. The third and fourth are small quarters on the bank of the river. On that bank are several large masonry houses. As remarked in the Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r article, the traders have of late years shown much rivalry in erecting fine temples. Gola has a new first-class police-station, an imperial post-office, and a good elementary (halkabandi) school. It is the head-quarters of a sub-division of the Opium Department.\n\nThe town is a considerable depot for the collection and river-export of grain, but has little original trade. A brass-founder named Bishweshwar has a local reputation for making a kind of squirt used in sprinkling perfumes at marriages and other festivities. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is, as already noted, in force. During 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 213 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 1,104. The expenditure, which was principally on police (Rs. 578), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 756. Of the 1,298 houses in the town 191 were assessed with the tax, whose incidence was Rs. 4-10-8 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-9 per head of population.\n\n1 The reason of this derivation is not apparent. Bh\u00edkhi is more likely to mean a beggar than a metallurgist. But it is not uncommon as a man's name; and after some person so named the quarter was probably called.\nGol\u00e1-Gop\u00e1lpur, or Gop\u00e1lpur's grain-market, was so called because founded by some former R\u00e1ja of the neighbouring Gop\u00e1lpur.\n\nThe market still belongs to the family, and the present r\u00e1ja derives from its rents an income of about Rs. 5,000 yearly. The prosperity of Gola depends almost altogether on the caprices of the Gh\u00e1gra. About the time of the great rebellion, when that river reinforced the Ku\u00e1na with its channels, the town could as a grain emporium compete with Barhaj. But before 1872 such channels had ceased to flow; and when visited in that year by Mr. Alexander, Gola looked poor and squalid enough. The Gh\u00e1gra has now in its full volume usurped the bed of the Ku\u00e1na; and the town has resumed its place as a great distributor of grain. It can no longer, however, claim to be the rival of Barhaj.\n\nGop\u00e1lpur, a large village in tappa Ch\u00e1ndp\u00e1r of parganah Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, lies on an unmetalled road about four miles north-west of the place just described. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,213, or including the inhabitants of Old Gop\u00e1lpur, to 1283. The prevailing caste is the R\u00e1jput. Ever since the division of the parganah between its contending Kausik factions, Gop\u00e1lpur has supplied title and residence to a r\u00e1ja. A fine castle of brick is still occupied by r\u00e1n\u00ed Dulhin Kuarin, widow of the late r\u00e1ja Krishn Kishor. From its walls can be obtained a good view of the surrounding country, which is rather low and liable to inundation. An excellent elementary school is held in a house belonging to the R\u00e1n\u00ed, who takes great interest in education. West of the village rises an extensive mound used as a brick quarry by the villagers. It was apparently a very large fort of the older Kausik colonists.\n\nGorakhpur, the headquarters of the district, lies between north latitude 26\u00b042' and east longitude 83\u00b023', about 335 feet above sea-level and 134 miles from Benares. Its population was 45,265 in 1847, 54,529 in 1853, and 50,853 in 1865. The census of 1872 gives its site an area of 727 acres, with an average of 70 persons to the acre. There were in the same year 51,117 inhabitants, of whom 33,986 were Hind\u00fas, 16,924 Musalmans, and 207 members of the Christian and other faiths. Distributing the population among the rural and urban classes, the returns show 1,444 landowners, 4,412 cultivators, and 45,261 persons pursuing occupations unconnected with agriculture. The number of houses according to the same returns was 11,538, of which 1,925 were built\n\n---\n\n1 See article on pargana Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r, \"History.\"\n2 This article has been compiled from the accounts of Messrs. Alexander and Crooke; a minute, dated 22nd February, 1850, by Mr. E. A. Reade, C.B.; Mr. Planck's Sanitary Reports; Buchanan's Eastern India; the Census Report of 1872; and Thornton's Gazetteer.\n3 The distance is thus computed: By rail from Benares to Jaunpur, 32 miles; by road from Jaunpur to Gorakhpur, 102 miles; total, 134. Another route is by rail from Benares to Akbarpur of Faizabad, 64 miles; by road from Akbarpur to Gorakhpur, 71 miles; total, 155.\n\"with skilled labour,\" i.e., of masonry, and 9,613 of mud. Of the former dwellings 1,888, and of the latter 6,574, were occupied by Hind\u00fas. Taking the male adult population, who numbered 18,815 persons over fifteen years of age, we find the following non-agricultural occupations pursued by more than fifty males:\u2014servants, 5,057; labourers 2,038; cultivators and ploughmen, 1,948; weavers, 910; grain-dealers and sellers, 771; land-owners, 635; shoe-makers and sellers, 483; greengrocers, 380; cloth-merchants, 364; oil-makers and sellers, 350; carpenters, 292; tailors, 278; washermen, 277; porters, 265; beggars, 261; Government servants, 252; shopkeepers, 208; milkmen, 200; barbers, 199; fruiterers, 159; fishmongers, 155; grain-parchers, 148; gold and silver smiths, 144; water-carriers, 130; pandits, or doctors of Hindu divinity and law, 124; butchers, 112; pack-carriers on ponies or on bullocks, 107; cotton-cleaners, 104; dyers, 101; tobacconists, 97; betel-leaf-sellers, 95; wood-sellers, 93; toddy-sellers, 87; rope and string makers and sellers, 85; merchants, 84; blacksmiths, 81; blanket-weavers, 80; sweepers, 74; book-sellers, 70; braziers, 67; and brick-layers, 62.\n\nBounded on the south-west on the navigable R\u00e1pti, Gorakhpur may be said to be surrounded on every other quarter by lakes. To north-west and north lies the Karmaini and Domingarh T\u00e9ls; to the east and south-east those of R\u00e1mgarh and Narhai. When the rains have swollen such waters, sailing becomes a favourite amusement with the European residents, of whom several possess tiny yachts. Not many miles east of the civil station lie forests which provide the additional pastime of shooting. The town itself seems to have found its origin in a small hamlet or village known as Old Gorakhpur, which was built, under circumstances hereafter mentioned, by a branch of the Sarnet R\u00e1jput house of Sat\u00e1si. Old Gorakhpur is now so widely severed from the more southern modern city as hardly to be deemed a part of it at all. As their numbers gradually grew, the settlers founded other hamlets near the first, and the later Muhammadan invaders built castles around which more villages sprung up. The names of these settlements, derived from their founders, from some local deity, or from some circumstances under which they were founded, often give a clue to their ages. Its piecemeal method of accumulation fully accounts for the large area over which Gorakhpur is scattered, as well as for its present appearance. Though containing less than 52,000 inhabitants, the town stretches more than three miles from north to south. Though its component villages have become muhallas or quarters of a single municipality, that municipality still seems in most places a collection of villages rather than one continuous town. The different quarters are often severed by market gardens and groves of fruit-trees.\nand bamboos. For the soil is rich, manure is handy, and water but 12 or 15 feet from the surface. Wells are numerous, but their contents are for drinking purposes not so good as those of wells beside the Ganges.\n\nBut, in spite of its straggling character, Gorakhpur may be broadly divided into two portions\u2014a northern with 29 and a southern with 39 quarters. The two are divided, not only by a strip of cultivation, but by a water-course which from a small pond connected with the R\u00e1mgarh lagoon finds its way to the R\u00e1pti. They are so entirely separate that on leaving one for the other it is at first hard to believe that one has not altogether quitted the town.\n\nThe principal quarters of the northern portion are Dil\u00e1z\u00e1rpur, Al\u00ednagar, and Captainganj. Of these the largest is Al\u00ednagar, where live all the wealthier native inhabitants of the city. Its tree-shaded main-street, lined by well-built masonry shops, is the best marketplace in Gorakhpur. In the southern part of the town the chief muhallas are Basantpura, Mi\u00e1n-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, Urdu-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, S\u00e1hibganj, Gola, and Ghan\u00edpur. The main-road of Basantpura is a narrow street winding parallel to the river. It has a few fairly good shops, but its neighbourhood, the south of the city, is a poor one. Mi\u00e1n-b\u00e1z\u00e1r lies on the eastern outskirt, and therefore adjoins the civil station. Its site drains towards the R\u00e1mgarh jh\u00edl, and through it by an artificial cutting flows in flooded seasons the water of the R\u00e1pti. Its name is derived from the fact that the late Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib of the Gorakhpur Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra founded here a fine market-place (b\u00e1z\u00e1r). Near the market-place is the house still occupied by his successor. Between Mi\u00e1n-b\u00e1z\u00e1r and the river lies Urdu-b\u00e1z\u00e1r or the Camp-market, the most important and populous quarter in the city. Many of its houses are brick built. Connected with it by a western road is Halseyganj or Halsey\u2019s mart, named after an Assistant Magistrate who some years later enriched Cawnpore with the fine market named Collectorganj. This Halseyganj is a small triangular space with a fenced and grass-grown centre. From another but a much earlier official, Routledge S\u00e1hib, the S\u00e1hibganj market and muhalla takes its name. Mr. Routledge was first Collector of the district. S\u00e1hibganj, which stands just north-east of the jail and river, passes between two great tanks, of which more will be said hereafter. It contains some substantial masonry houses and shops, and is the principal grain mart of the town. Leaving it by a northern road we reach Gola. Gola too means, as usual, a grain market; but its northern portion is a market for vegetables also. Here are sold the potatoes, pineapples,\n\n---\n\n1This watercourse has now half a dozen different names. When the R\u00e1pti is flooded the water-course may perhaps be said to run from the river to the R\u00e1mgarh jh\u00edl. 2 Sep\u00fala pp. 379-80.\nyams, carrots, and radishes, for which the market-gardens of Gorakhpur are famous. The market-place stands on a raised site, shaded in the centre by trees, but blocked towards its northern end by a small mud-built im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra. It is to the southern part of the city what Alinagar is to the north. North again of Gola lies Gh\u00e1nipnr, a Musalm\u00e1n quarter, which is also the northernmost quarter of this part of the city. It includes the garden lands on the banks of the dividing water-course already mentioned.\n\nThe civil station and cantonments lie east of the southern portion of the town. Neither are large of their class. The European residents of the former are generally limited to the judge, the magistrate-collector and his two covenanted assistants, the civil surgeon, the district engineer, the district superintendent of police and his assistant, the sub-deputy opium agent, the inspector of customs, the inspector of post-offices, and the postmaster. In the latter is located a native infantry regiment with its complement of officers; but a troop of native cavalry has sometimes been detached hither from Kasauli. In 1841 there was, besides these forces, a detail of native artillery.\u00b9 Within the cantonments and north of the military lines stands the military hospital. This has been surrounded with an earthwork embankment, and would be used as a place of refuge in case of disturbances.\n\nBefore closing the descriptive part of this notice, it remains to mention some of the principal public buildings. The masonry sar\u00e9i or hostel of Mr. Collector Chester stands in Basantpura, on the rising ground overlooking the stretch of modern alluvium which intervenes between the city and the river. Its high and turreted enclosing wall is entered by a great gateway; the enclosure within is shaded by trees and includes a mosque. Dr. Planek (1870) complains that it is isolated from the rest of the city by mud houses, which block up its approaches until \"what might be a great ornament seems lost in a corner.\" The same cause damages the appearance of the Im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra. An im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, it should be explained, is a consecrated building where during the Muharram festival Musalm\u00e1ns perform the rites of mourning for the Im\u00e1ms Hasan and Husain. This im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra was built, as above\u00b2 related, by a holy mendicant named Raushan Ali, assisted by Asaf-ud-daula, Naw\u00e1b of Oudh (1775-97). Though an imposing, it is therefore not an ancient structure. The adjoining house of its guardian, the Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib, was mentioned in the penultimate paragraph. The Khud\u00e1i mosque, the principal place of ordinary Muhammadan worship, closes the vista formed\n\n\u00b9 Bengal and Agra Guide for that year, quoted by Thornton. \u00b2 P. 409.\nby the long line of shops in the Urdu bazar. It is a plainly built and rather heavy-looking edifice, raised on a narrow plinth above an open space from which four roadways diverge. The builder was Kazi Khalil-ur-Rahman of Maghar; but the building was, as elsewhere told, ordered by prince Muazzim, in whose honour Gorakhpur was for a short time called Muazzimabad.\n\nThe jail marks the site of the old fort reared above the Rapti by raja Basant Singh of Satasi, after whom the enclosing quarter, Basantpura, is named. This stronghold was afterwards occupied as a cantonment by both the Muhammadan and the British masters of the district. But when the present cantonments were laid out east of the city, it became converted to its present uses. The last remains of the old castle were removed in 1874, during the extension of the jail; and the Rapti has now receded some distance to the west. The site is raised about eight or ten feet above the general level of the town, and the jail itself is built throughout of masonry. It has a double wall entered on the north by a not very imposing gateway; and is aired within by several open spaces grown with grass, flowers, or shrubs. Ventilation has been secured without by removing the surrounding houses, till on the city side there is now a clear precinct of about 40 yards width. The low-land abandoned by the river is cultivated as a jail garden.\n\nThe shrine of Gorakhnath, adjoining the old Gorakhpur quarter, is more remarkable for the strange legends told of the saint in whose honour it was founded than for any architectural merit. The building is buried in the enormous grove for which its multitude of mango-trees is said to have earned the name of Pachlakhia; and is thus hidden from observation in a manner that somewhat adds to its mystery. Not far from the shrine is the Mansarwar pond, overlooked by another temple. The priests at St. Gorakhnath's are Earbored Jogis.\n\nMr. Commissioner Reade's dharmasala or hostel stands in the Aladad quarter, on the south of the city. It was built about 1837 for the use of landholders visiting the city, and is now a benevolent trust managed by Government. On the shores of the Domingarh lake and site of the old Domingarh castles the same officer erected a large house intended as a sanatorium for the European residents of Gorakhpur. Of European houses at Gorakhpur itself, the finest is perhaps that belonging to Mr. Bridgman. Other British buildings which deserve special mention are the church, orphanage\n\n---\n\n1 P. 443. 2 See p. 442.

Three miles east of the city, at a place which bears the very appropriate name of Bish\u00e1ratpur or Evangelopolis, the society has a branch establishment. In Urdu b\u00e1z\u00e1r it has a small masonry schoolhouse.\n\nThe courts and offices of the judge, magistrate-collector, and other European officials will be found in the civil station. Gorakhpur has also a tahs\u00edl, a new central police-station (kotw\u00e1l\u00ed) in the Turkm\u00e1npur quarter, police outposts in several other mohallas, a central dispensary, a district (sila) and five municipal schools, and a central post-office. It has been already mentioned that some good native houses and shops may be seen in Al\u00ednagar, Urdu b\u00e1z\u00e1r, S\u00e1hibganj, and other quarters of the city. But Gorakhpur is built chiefly of mud; and most of its dwellings have therefore a poor and squalid appearance. Its tiled roofs give it no doubt a neater look than is possessed by the towns of thatch, but this advantage is somewhat neutralized in its northern quarters by the monkeys, the chartered libertines of many an Indian city. According to Buchanan, these animals \"in their insatiable curiosity to discover what is below them turn over tile after tile, thus setting whole roofs in disorder.\"\n\nAn unfailing characteristic of mud-built cities is the large number of holes and pits from which the earth for buildings has been dug. Dry Sanitation. in summer, in the rainy season charged with stagnant of and unsavoury ditchwater, such excavations have always been the chief eyesore of Gorakhpur. But within the last fifteen years strenuous exertions have been made to reduce their number, and to turn the larger pools into graceful reservoirs. The largest were the Egrets' pond (Bagl\u00e1dah) and the Crows' pond (Kaww\u00e1dah), between which the S\u00e1hibganj road passes. The improvement of the former was taken up as a relief-work during the famine of 1873-74; and it has now been converted into a tank with regular sides, surrounded by a municipal garden. The Crows' pond, whose name popular legend prefers to derive from a princess named Kaul\u00e1vati,\u00b9 was similarly treated during the famine of 1877-78. It is now a magnificent oblong sheet of water. The overflow of these tanks is conducted into the R\u00e1pti.\n\nTo prevent the flooding formerly so common in the city, natural drainage lines have been widened and deepened. The west of Gorakhpur is now drained into the Crows' pond, the north into the Sonaha t\u00e1l, the centre, south, and east into the R\u00e1mgarh jh\u00edl. But these have not been the only improvements of late years. About 1870 Mr. Collector Young did much for the city in widening its main streets; and there were then no less than 14 public latrines.\n\n\u00b9 See p. 432.\nThe rapid development during the last seven years of the municipal income has enabled the Municipal Secretary, Mr. Crooke, to push forward reforms with his accustomed energy. New roads have been constructed through the purlieus of the M\u00ed\u00e1n-b\u00e1z\u00e1r quarter and the slums between Al\u00ednagar and Jafra b\u00e1z\u00e1r. Funds are now available for clearing a similar passage from Halseyganj to Birdgh\u00e1t on the R\u00e1pti, and for removing the unsightly houses between the Crows' and Egrets' tanks. Existing highways have been metalled and flanked by excellent masonry drains. Some police lines have been built opposite the jail, a vegetable market in Halseyganj, a new school on the Domingarh road, and new octroi outposts on various outskirts of the city.\n\nFrom the duties collected at those outposts the municipal income is chiefly derived. The following table shows the expenditure as well as the income for two recent years:\n\n| Receipts | 1876-77 | 1877-78 | Expenditure | 1876-77 | 1877-78 |\n|----------|---------|---------|-------------|---------|---------|\n| Rs.      | Rs.     | Rs.     | Rs.         | Rs.     | Rs.     |\n| Opening balance ... | 10,390 | 10,652 | Collection ... | 3,024 | 3,485 |\n| Class I.\u2014Food and drink ... | 19,503 | 19,970 | Head-office ... | 341 | 349 |\n| II.\u2014Animals for slaughter, ... | 758 | 776 | Supervision ... | ... | ... |\n| III.\u2014Fuel, &c. ... | 4,254 | 4,816 | Original works ... | 8,254 | 12,415 |\n| IV.\u2014Building materials ... | 525 | 331 | Repairs and maintenance of roads. ... | ... | 8,346 |\n| V.\u2014Drugs and spices, &c. ... | 511 | 441 | Police ... | 3,836 | 4,293 |\n| VI.\u2014Tobacco ... | 464 | 787 | Education ... | 1,340 | 1,520 |\n| VII.\u2014Textile fabrics ... | 8,004 | 6,201 | Registration of births and deaths. 24 ... | ... | ... |\n| VIII.\u2014Metals ... | 1,099 | 881 | Lighting ... | 2,016 | 1,845 |\n| Total ... | 35,118 | 33,503 | Watering roads ... | ... | ... |\n| Rents ... | 480 | 606 | Drainage works ... | 1,750 | 2,370 |\n| Fines ... | 317 | 410 | Water-supply ... | 17 | ... |\n| Pounds ... | 1,032 | 3,683 | Charitable grants ... | 4,472 | 1,032 |\n| Miscellaneous ... | | | Conservancy ... | 4,578 | 6,267 |\n| Total ... | 30,947 | 38,202 | Miscellaneous ... | 647 | 331 |\n| Total ... | 30,297 | 42,274 |\nIn the year last shown the octroi fell at the rate of Rs. 0-7-11 per head of population.

The city itself produces little except tobacco and the vegetables above mentioned. Its manufactures are few and unimportant. The only specialities are the carpentry, chiefly palanquins, made in the Raiganj quarter, and the turnery, such as round boxes, made in Raiganj and Iht\u00e1 P\u00e1nde.\naccount already given of the district trade will be found some scattered references to Gorakhpur. But it is not a commercial city. With the exception of the officials, the troops, and the traders who supply the local demand for necessaries, the population is chiefly agricultural.\n\nThe name of the town was probably derived, as already told, from St. Gorakhnath, whose shrine adjoins old or original Gorakhpur. A quarrel in the Satasi family induced some of its members to quit the ancestral castle beside the Ramgarh jhil, and migrate hither in the beginning of the fifteenth century. But legend says that Mansarwar tank in the same neighbourhood was excavated in the tenth century by a king named Man Sen, who was overthrown by the Domkat\u00e1r founders of the Domangarh fort.\n\nIt seems certain that the cluster of hamlets which first constituted Gorakhpur lay somewhat north of the present site. There are grounds for believing that the Rapti then flowed considerably north and east of its modern course, sweeping round through that site and the Ramgarh jhil. \"Evidence of this,\" writes Mr. Reade, \"is constantly furnished by the discovery of drift wood and portions of dinghis (boats) in excavating new wells.\" The first settlers probably found their position defended by the great Haveli forest to east and north, by the Rohin to the west, and by the Rapti to the south.\n\nIn 1567 and 1570, during the reign of Akbar, Gorakhpur was visited for a first and second time by Muslim invaders. They built here a brick fort which is mentioned at the end of the century by Akbar's Institutes. But as the position of that fort is unknown, its erection furnishes us with no clue as to the date when the recession of the Rapti made way for the present city. That recession, however, took place before 1610, when the Muslim garrison was ejected and a fort built on the site of the present jail by raja Basant Singh of Satasi. About 1680 the founder of the Khudai mosque, Kazi Khalil-ur-Rahman, was appointed governor. He re-expelled the Hindus, repaired Basant's fort, and threw into it a garrison. Mr. Reade informs us that the citadel of the fort was built by Muizz-ud-din Khan, \"who first seems to have been able to establish security of life and property in the neighbourhood of the forests.\" But by Muizz-ud-din is probably meant prince Muazzim, afterwards the emperor Bahadur Shah, who visited Gorakhpur towards the close of the century. For many years the city was in his honour officially styled Muazzimabad.\n\n---\n\n1 Supra pp. 413-18. 2 Page 436. 3 It should be observed, however, that Mansarovar is the name of a great Tibetan lake with which the mythology of the Hindus has always been sufficiently familiar. And ponds named after that lake may be found in other places.\nBefore the middle of the last century the Musalm\u00e1n garrison had shown a tendency to assert independence of the emperor and his Oudh naw\u00e1b. On the part of the latter, therefore, a large army under Ali K\u00e1sim visited the city and razed a tower of refuge which the rebels had built on the site of the old Domangarh castle. About the same time Gorakhpur was visited by the Jesuit father Tiefenthaler. He mentions that the R\u00e9pti was crossed by a bridge of boats 100 paces in length; and that the circuit of the city was three miles, though the residents reported it as seven. He notices the Khud\u00e1i and another mosque, which being ruinous in Buchanan\u2019s time is probably no more. His plan of the fort shows a square building with a bastion at each corner and two intermediate bastions on each curtain.\n\nIn the second year of the next or present century the town and district were ceded by the now independent Oudh naw\u00e1b to the British. The first collector pitched his tents near what is now the racquet-court, on the margin of a pond whose edges had been cleared of jungle. Round his camp, to keep off the tigers, was drawn a cordon of elephants. The cantonment was located in the Captaininganj quarter, on the site of a house and grounds afterwards called Crommelin\u2019s. But in summer both the civil and military officers used to take refuge in the fort, which had been repaired, and was probably cooler. In 1810, when the behaviour of the Nep\u00e1lese brought the importance of Gorakhpur as a military station into prominence, the Company\u2019s troops were removed from Faizabad in the naw\u00e1b\u2019s territory and posted here. A larger cantonment was necessary, and that now existing on the east of the city was laid out. \u201cThe natives,\u201d writes Buchanan, \u201cwill not in general consent to cut any tree that has been planted; and it required a very odious exertion of power to clear so much ground as was sufficient to form a parade and a kind of breathing-hole for the European officers of Government.\u201d Meanwhile a civil station of double-storied houses had arisen on the other side of the town. But the civilians were not long in following the soldiers, and thus their present settlement arose. The security afforded by the presence of a large military force, and the abolition of a cess hitherto imposed on the native inhabitants by the r\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1si, largely increased the number of persons who made the town their home. In 1815, during the first Nep\u00e1lese campaign, Gorakhpur became the head-quarters of a column under General J. S. Wood. The collector who was his contemporary, Sir Roger Martin, laid out a race-course bisected by the Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r road. But this hippodrome no longer exists.\n\nThe growing size of Gorakhpur had not hitherto been accompanied by a growing attention to cleanliness. But in the third decade of the century the city had the good fortune to be ruled by a collector who of all officials in these\nprovinces has perhaps earned for himself the longest immortality. Mr. R. M. Bird steadily directed his efforts to clearing and bridging the natural lines of drainage. These efforts did not cease when Mr. Bird was promoted to the commissionership; but they were brought to an abrupt close by a Government order transferring to imperial or provincial purposes all the funds (Rs. 26,000) which had been saved for the improvement of the town. About 1835 that town was visited by Buchanan, who describes the buildings as very mean and the streets as \"crooked, dirty, and filled with impediments.\" In this state of relapse Gorakhpur continued until 1850, when Mr. Reade describes its sanitary condition as \"deplorable.\" He, however, drew up a minute, laying down the lines of those improvements which have ever since been steadily effected. Some impetus to reform was given by the appointment in 1868 of a municipal committee, and Gorakhpur is now as tidy and well ventilated a place as could be found in the North-Western Provinces.\n\nGorakhpur, the Head-quarters, Sadr, or Haz\u00far tahsil of the district, has its offices at the place just described. It is a tract of very irregular shape, but its minor excrescences and indentations being disregarded, it may be said to be bounded on the south, east, and east north-east by tahsil H\u00e1ta; on the north-east by tahsil Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj; on the west north-west by the Basti district; and on the south south-west by intruding angles of the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsil. The R\u00e1pti forms for some distance the boundary, first with Basti and afterwards with B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on. The Head-quarters tahsil includes the two northern tappas of parganah Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r, the whole of the Gorakhpur parganah Maghar, and 10 tappas on that side of parganah Haveli which adjoins the R\u00e1pti. It had in 1878 a total area of 419,819 acres and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,63,340. Its population in 1872 was 330,875, or 506 persons to the square mile. But a detailed account of the tahsil will be found in the articles on its three parganahs.\n\nH\u00e1ta, a village in tappa Badaholi, of parganah Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, stands on the unmetalled Kasia road, 28 miles east of Gorakhpur. Not far west of it flows the Mohan brook. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,033 persons only; but H\u00e1ta has since 1872 been the head-quarters of a tahsil.\n\nIt contains, besides the tahsil, a first-class police-station, an imperial post-office, a tahsil school, and a branch dispensary.\n\nH\u00e1ta, a tahsil with court and treasury at the place just described, is bounded on the east north-east by the Padrauna tahsil, the Kh\u00e1nua river forming in places the boundary; on north-by-west by the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj tahsil;\n\n---\n\n1 Mr. Reade was then a Member of the Board of Revenue.  \n2 It should be remembered that adjoining this parganah Maghar is another in the Basti district.\non its concave western frontier by the Head-quarters and B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsils, the R\u00e1pti being for a short distance the border with the latter; on the south south-west again by the R\u00e1pti, which severs it from the B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on tahsil; and on the south-east by tahsils Deoria and Padrauna. Tahsil H\u00e1ta includes the parganahs of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and Silhat, and 6 tappas on the central eastern side of parganah Haveli. It had in 1878 a total area of 367,867 acres and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,81,699. Its population amounted in 1872 to 287,230 souls. But further details of area, revenue, and population will be found in the articles on the three parganahs of the tahsil.\n\nHaveli or Haveli-Gorakhpur, the largest parganah of the district, forms part of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, Head-quarters, and H\u00e1ta tahsils. On east-by-north it marches with parganah Sidhua Jobna, the boundary being the Little Gandak river; on the north-east its angles protrude into parganahs Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur; on the north-west the Gh\u00fanghi river severs it from Nep\u00e1l and Basti; on west south-west, or south-west by west, it is bounded chiefly by the Dhamaela and R\u00e1pti, which divide it from Basti and parganahs Maghar and Bhau\u00e1pur; its irregular south-eastern frontier indents or is indented by parganahs Silhat and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. It contains 28 tappas,\u2014namely, Sum\u00e1khor, Katahra, Rigauli, Sikra, Lehra, Matkopa, Bh\u00e1ri-Baisi, Banki, Baraicha, Unti, Andh\u00e1ya, and Lekhman, all in tahsil Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj; Patra, Khutahan, Pachw\u00e1ra, Kasba, Mar\u00e9chi-Chand\u00far, Gaura, Haveli, Ke\u00fatali, Rajdh\u00e1ni, and Ras\u00falpur, all in the Head-quarters tahsil; and Padkhori, Bharsand, Parwarp\u00e1r, Agaya, Bandw\u00e1r, and Ded\u00fapar, all in tahsil H\u00e1ta. The parganah contains 2,001 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza). It had in 1878 an area of 909,117 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 4,69,843.\u00b9\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 Haveli contained 1,592 inhabited sites, of which 657 had less than 200 inhabitants; 713 between 200 and 500; 174 between 500 and 1,000; 25 between 1,000 and 2,000; 6 between 2,000 and 3,000; and 4 between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants was Gorakhpur, but this had over 50,000.\n\nThe population numbered 541,846 souls (253,856 females), giving 580 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 483,011 Hind\u00fas (226,038 females), 58,319 Musalm\u00e1ns (27,576 females), and 516 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 33,185 Br\u00e1hmans (15,574 females); 5,894 R\u00e1jputs (2,546 females); and\n\n\u00b9 505,284 acres and Rs. 2,08,368 belong to the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, 100,265 acres and Rs. 87,258 to the H\u00e1ta, and 303,566 acres and Rs. 1,74,217 to the Head-quarters tahsils.\n15,648 Baniyas (7,409 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 482,284 souls (200,509 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this pargana is the Kanaujiya (32,448). The chief Rajput clans are the Bais (1,521), Ponw\u00e1r, Chandel, Sirnet, Sakarwal, Kausik, and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (3,121), Agarw\u00e1l, Agarahri, Barawa,\u00b9 Unai, and Kasaundhan subdivisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Bind, Dos\u00e1dh, Gond,\u00b2 Teli, Koeri, Ahfr, Loh\u00e1r, Hajj\u00e1m, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Satw\u00e1r, Gaddariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbhar, Sonar, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Bar\u00e1yi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1si, Thathera, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Jogi, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, B\u00edri, Atith, Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kadera, Bharbhunja, Beld\u00e1r.

The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (34,872), Sayyids (948), Mughals (204), Path\u00e1ns (10,955), and unspecified.\n\nThe settlement reports divide Haveli into two portions; the northern containing the six tappas first named, and the southern the twenty-two remaining sub-divisions. North Haveli had in 1865 an area of 358,659 acres, whereof 158,200 were cultivated, 59,807 were cultivable, and 115,511 formed parts of forest grants more or less reduced to cultivation. On the east an unbroken plain of flourishing fields, it towards the centre, as tappa Katahra is reached, becomes worn into undulations by numerous water-courses. In the troughs of such undulations lie considerable stretches of low moist land grown chiefly with late rice (jarh\u00e1n). But the cultivation is unmistakably inferior to that of the tract we have just quitted, and is, moreover, subject in places to the ravages of four-footed marauders from the great forest. Between tappas Katahra and Lehra that forest even yet forms an almost impenetrable barrier. It is no purely local feature, but a part of the great wedge of woodland which stretches from Nep\u00e1l to some 20 miles south-east of Gorakhpur city. The rivers along which it grows are the Rohin and the Rohin's affluents, the Jharri or Piy\u00e1s and the Chillua. The Rohin is the only stream that completely crosses Haveli; and the Jharri is its only important feeder which does not rise within that parganah. About two miles west of the former river the forest ceases and the cultivation of tappas Lehra and Sum\u00e1khor begins. This tract consists of a northern or Jangal Buridi and a southern or Rajgat sub-division. The name of the former shows it to have been shorn from the\n\n\u00b9 See article on parganah Dhuri\u00e1d\u00e1r, \"population,\" note. \u00b2 Article on parganah Bhau\u00e1d\u00e1r \"population\" section, note.\nforest; but it is less fertile than the latter, which was brought under cultivation earlier. Passing westward over Mr. Bridgman's great forest grant, we finally reach tappas Rigauli and Sikra, the richest perhaps of Haveli. Watered by many a lagoon and by the pools of many a stream, they receive every rainy season rich alluvial deposits which, in return for no other labour than sowing, yield most luxuriant spring crops. After traversing a corner of the tract, the navigable Dhamela throws itself into the R\u00e1pti.\n\nSouth Haveli had in 1867 an area of 553,639 acres, whereof 225,973 were cultivated and 82,968 cultivable. The proportion of forest grants, which as in North Haveli have been more or less brought under tillage, was 172,891 acres. As in North Haveli, the woodland belt continues to bisect the parganah, and though greatly narrowed and sometimes pierced by modern clearings, still girds with a broad fringe of forest the country north and west of the capital. East and west of this belt the landscape might but for its many mango-groves be called open. On both sides the land is thickly peopled and thickly cultivated, but much of the low western side is subject to inundation from the R\u00e1pti and its tributaries. The fine alluvial soil always produces a rich spring crop; but the autumn outturn, especially between R\u00e1pti and Robin, is often endangered by the floods. Though everywhere common, lagoons are on this side of South Haveli commonest.\n\nOn the eastern side of the forest the land rises into undulating ridges (dh\u00fas) of sand. Large patches of waste land are commoner than on the west; but the soil is sufficiently fertile to produce large quantities of sugarcane. This part of the parganah is drained by the T\u00fara, Pharend, Mohan, and Majhni, of which the last forms the boundary line with Silhat. In the extreme south the surface is much broken by deep watercourses which convey the drainage of tappa Rajdh\u00e1ni to the R\u00e1pti. These and floods have between them caused the abandonment of the road along the bank of that river, from Gorakhpur to Barhi.\n\nThe soils of the parganah are as usual divided into loam (doras), sand (balua), and clay (mattiy\u00e1r or karaila). But of that last named south Haveli has but little, and this fact fully accounts for its small outturn of winter rice. On the banks of the Gh\u00fanghi and R\u00e1pti, as well as on the eastern side of North Haveli, is a good deal of the marly soil\n\n---\n\n1 Like the name Bankata, so common in these provinces, Jangal Buridi simply means the forest clearing.\n2 \"The principal of these,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"is R\u00e1ngarh, which is connected with a string of smaller marshes, and extends due south nearly as far as the Barhi police-station. In the rains this line of jh\u00fala becomes one mass of water. A considerable part of their drainage passes into the R\u00e1pti by a ndia (watercourse) under the village of Lahesara, about 4 miles from Gorakhpur. The question of draining the R\u00e1ngarh jh\u00fala has been for some time under consideration. It has been proposed for this purpose to deepen the Lahesara and other n\u00e1ls. There can be little doubt that this would be a most valuable sanitary improvement, and would greatly improve the climate of the city and cantonments.\"\ncalled *bh\u00e1t*. Land flooded by R\u00e1pti is known as *kach\u00e1r*. On the distinction between the three great natural classes of soil just named the people lay little stress, for in each are found very great differences of quality. The numerous streams and lagoons afford ample means of irrigation; and Mr. Lumsden was satisfied that not 10 per cent. of the cultivated area in South Haveli was left unwatered for want of facilities. The average depth of water is but $1\\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the surface, and unbricked wells are easily dug. The staple crop of the parganah is autumn (*bhadui*) rice. But as already mentioned, winter rice is not altogether absent, and the drying margins of lagoons are in summer largely planted with the rice called *boro*. Another great crop of the autumn harvest is *m\u00e1sh* or *urd* pulse; and sufficient indigo is raised to keep several factories at work. At the spring harvest the principal staples are wheat, barley, linseed, and gram. For the excellence of their wheat the western tappas, and especially Pachhw\u00e1ra, are noted. The cultivation of poppy is comparatively limited.\n\nExcept those of indigo and sugar, which latter is refined at many factories, the parganah has no important manufactures. Its crops are in fact its only noteworthy products. The principal markets are Gorakhpur, Dh\u00e1ni, Captainganj, Pipr\u00e1ich, Rigauli, and S\u00e1hibganj; but there are also many smaller village marts, such as Gaura, Jaswal, and Par-tawal. The mileage within Haveli of the metalled Benares road is small. But some half dozen unmetalled roads traverse the parganah on their way to Gorakhpur, and one on its way from Padrauna to Karmaini-gh\u00e1t. Additional trade routes are provided by the rivers R\u00e1pti, Dhamela, Rohin, and Little Gandak, of which all are navigable.\n\n\"The chief places of archaeological interest,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"are the great Dom fort at Domingarh, near the junction of the Rohin and R\u00e1pti; the immense Maurya city at Upadaulia or Rajdh\u00e1ni proper in tappa Rajdh\u00e1ni; the tomb of Abdul K\u00e1dir Hazrat at It\u00e1ya in tappa Khutahan; the Jh\u00e1r Khandi Mah\u00e1deo in tappa Haveli; and remains of forts at Mathia in tappa Unthi, Mednipur in tappa Bahraicha, Baila Gaunar and Bagh\u00e1r in tappa Ki\u00fatali, and Barhampur in tappa Ras\u00falpur.\n\n\"A good deal of shooting may be got in the parganah. The jungle east of Gorakhpur itself abounds in deer, nilgai, and pig, and several leopards have been shot there. Tigers have disappeared owing to the cutting of the forest which once ran in one unbroken line up to the Tar\u00e1i. There are immense quantities of duck and teal in the\nlakes of R\u00e1mgarh, Chilla, and Jamu\u00e1r, and there is excellent snipe-shooting in the neighbourhood of Gorakhpur. The black partridge is found in the east of the parganah.\"\n\nWhat existing tribe can claim the honour of having first peopled parganah Haveli is doubtful. The earliest ruler of whom tradition speaks was one M\u00e1n Sen, who is variously called a Tharu or a R\u00e1thor. He was overwhelmed about the middle of the tenth century by the Domkat\u00e1rs or Domw\u00e1rs, a race of somewhat mixed origin. In the fourteenth century, again, the Domkat\u00e1rs succumbed to the Sarnets, whilst a chieftain said to have been a Chauh\u00e1n occupied some small northern part of the parganah. The two principalities thus founded, those of Sat\u00e1si and B\u00fatwal, continued their existence into the present century.\n\nWith the appearance of the Muslims, towards the close of the sixteenth, the parganah assumed its present name. Haveli signifies the land surrounding a fort, the fort in this case being that of Gorakhpur. In the Institutes of Akbar (1596), Haveli Gorakhpur has a State rental of Rs. 14,209 (5,68,385 d\u00e1ms). The smallness of the sum shows how large a part of the parganah must still have been under forest. We know that a hundred years later Prince Muazzim was attracted to Gorakhpur by accounts of the grand sport which the neighbourhood afforded; and the turmoils of following centuries are unlikely to have favoured the increase of cultivation. Much of the woodland south-east of Gorakhpur is said to have sprung up during the devastations of the Banj\u00e1ras in the beginning of the last century.\n\nWith the beginning of the present however, when the parganah passed to its present rulers, a marked improvement took place. After the Nep\u00e1lese war (1816), the Jangal Bur\u00edd\u00ed villages were bestowed for reclamation on refugees who had fled the scene of campaign. Forest grants to other persons still further increased the area under the plough. But the spread of cultivation under British rule is best proved by the steadily rising demands of successive revenue assessments. These demands were at the first settlement (1803) Rs. 55,660; at the second (1806), Rs. 59,688; at the third (1809), Rs. 70,045; at the fourth (1813), Rs. 79,290; at the fifth (1840), Rs. 2,76,610; and at the sixth or current (1865-67), Rs. 4,00,109. The remaining forest is so valuable that reclamation has probably reached its limit; but during the term of the fifth or last assessment large tracts of waste and woodland were converted into fields. The extension of tillage was not the sole effect of this conversion. The climate was improved, facilities of traffic increased, and the\n\n---\n\n1 See article on Gorakhpur city, \"History.\"\nsecurity of life and property was established against the attacks of robbers and the ravages of wild beasts.\n\n**It\u00e1ya**, a hamlet in the forest, about 8 miles north-east of Gorakhpur, is a place of worship much affected by the Musalm\u00e1ns of that city. Its shrine is thus described by Buchanan, to whose account Mr. Crooke thinks nothing need be added:\n\n\"It is a small monument dedicated to a saint named Abdul K\u00e1dir Hazrat Ghaus L\u00e1zim Dastgir. He was buried at Baghdad, but he fasted 40 days and nights in the forest here, and the keeper says that he is the saint's descendant. As such a fast is considered by the people here as rather an ordinary exertion of holy men, the keeper, in order to enhance the merit of his monument, has brought a brick and lamp from Kichhauchha in the dominions of the Naw\u00e1b Vazir. He has 100 bighas free from assessment, and from 1,000 to 1,500 people assemble on the day of the longnamed saint.\"\n\nIn 1872 It\u00e1ya had but 307 inhabitants.\n\n**Kah\u00e1on**, a small village in tappa M\u00e1il of parganah Salempur-Majhauli, lies three miles north of M\u00e1il and 46 south-east of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 a population of 352 persons only.\n\nKah\u00e1on is part of the Majhauli domain, now under the Court of Wards. Its only interest arises from its Buddhist or Jaina antiquities. Chief of these is a coarse grey sandstone column, standing 24\u00bd feet from the surface, and popularly known as Bh\u00edmsen's pillar (l\u00e1th). For 4\u00bd feet from the base it is square, each face being 1 foot 10 inches broad; for the next 6\u00bd feet it is octagonal; as it tapers further upwards towards its bell-shaped capital it is first fluted into 16 sides and afterwards circular. A metal spike at the top would seem to show that the pillar was once crowned by a lion or some other termination. In small niches on each side of the square abacus above the capital are naked figures, and on one side of the base is a sculptured image of some divine being facing west. The image rests its back on what is supposed to be a canopy of cobra's heads, and at each of its feet is the representation of a votary. On the three northern faces of the octagonal portion is a fairly legible inscription in the Gupta character of the Allahabad column.\u00b9 It merely mentions that one Madra, \"the constant and friendly patron of Br\u00e1hmans, Gurus, and Yatis,\" dedicates five images of Indra. The term Yati is in the present day applied to Jain priests, who are generally Br\u00e1hmans. The naked figures of the columns, with their crisp curled hair, must, says General Cunningham, belong either to the Jains or the later Tantrika Buddhists. It may be added that the cobra canopy, though applied also to other deities and prophets, is the special symbol of the great Jain tirth\u00e1nk\u00e1ra, P\u00e1rasn\u00e1th. The date of the inscription\n\n\u00b9 Copies of the inscription and engravings of the pillar will be found in Buchanan's Eastern India, II, and Cunningham's Archaeological Reports, I.\nis 141, but the era is still a point of dispute amongst the learned. If Dr. Fitz-\nEdward Hall is right in supposing the sambat intended, the pillar was raised\nin 84 A.D.; if General Cunningham's choice of the S\u0101ka be approved, the year of\nerection was 219 A.D. The overthrow of the Gupta or Maurya dynasty\noccurred some hundred years later.\n\nIn the immediate neighbourhood of the pillar are three ancient tanks or\ngars\u00b9 known as the Purena Karnahi, and Jhakarahi or Sopha. Around the pil-\nlar are no traces of the enclosure mentioned by Buchanan, and the old well has\nbeen filled up. Near the edge of the Karnahi tank is a small ruined temple,\nalmost levelled with the ground. This may have been the two storied pyra-\nmidal building seen by Buchanan. On the rubbish is a black stone image of\nBuddha, now broken into two pieces but once about 7 feet high. The natives\ncall this Ak\u0101sk\u0101m\u012bni, and the same name is applied to another large tank east\nof the village. Arrangements are being made for protecting this idol from the\nweather. Curiously enough, it seems to have escaped Buchanan's notice. The\nfragments of two images mentioned by him are not now visible. Nor could\nthey be discovered at the time of the arch\u00e6ological survey (1861-62).\n\nThe officer who effected that survey presumes that the pillar must have\nbeen placed opposite the temple in which the Panchendra, or five images of\nIndra, were enshrined. Several temples and other buildings are likely to have\nbeen crowded round the column; for it would otherwise be hard to account for\nthe great size of the mound on which both column and village stand. Though\nnot more than 6 feet in height above the fields, this eminence extends from\nwest to east upwards of 1,200 feet, with an average breadth of 400.\nThe village contains some fine old wells, whose gigantic bricks must\nsurely have been taken from some ancient building. It may be men-\ntioned that the inscription on the pillar would seem to call that village\nKakubharati; and from some compound of Kakubha, such as Kakubh\u0101wan,\nthe name Kah\u0101wan or Kah\u0101on might easily have come. \"The pillar,\" writes\nMr. Crouke, \"is analogous to that at Bh\u0101galpur, which is about 7 miles south\non the banks of the Sarju (Gh\u0101gra). But the Kah\u0101on pillar is much more\nelaborately carved, and is not disfigured by some zealot as is that at Bh\u0101galpur.\nKah\u0101on is probably one of the Buddhistic stages between Bh\u0101galpur and\nKasia, as mentioned in the article on Sohan\u0101g. No fair is held, but milk and\nother dainties are offered to the image by the neighbouring villagers.\"\n\nKasia, the head-quarters of the sub-division so named, is a village of tappa\nMainpur-Sabekhor, in parganah Sidhua-Jobna. It stands on the crossing\n\n\u00b9 This strange word is by General Cunningham derived from Sanskrit gri, to wet. But may\nit not be another form of garha, gadhaiyu, &c.?\nof two unmetalled roads, 37 miles east of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 918 persons only.\n\nKasia contains a first-class police-station, an imperial post-office, a branch dispensary, and the court and residence of the officer in charge of the sub-division. It was not long ago proposed to make the village the headquarters of a separate district. But that scheme is for the present shelved; and Kasia still derives its chief importance from its Buddhist associations and Buddhist remains.\n\nThe latter lie south-west of the village, near the Kh\u00e1nua and other branches of the Little Gandak river. They consist of (1) a lofty mound of solid brickwork, styled Dev\u00edsth\u00e1n or R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r-Bhaw\u00e1ni; (2) an oblong eminence bearing a much-ruined relic-temple (stupa), and named the castle of the dead Prince; (3) a large statue of Buddha the Ascetic; (4) a low square mound covered with broken brick, near the village of Anrudhwa; and (5) a number of small earthen hillocks which are scattered like barrows over the plain north and east of the great mound.\n\nThe R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r mound (tila) derives its names of Dev\u00edsth\u00e1n and Bhaw\u00e1ni from the fact that its summit is now sacred to the consort of Shiva. The goddess has no temple; but some votive figures of baked clay, shaded by a fine old banyan-tree, mark the place as her own. The mound is situated on the western bank of the R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r lagoon, which forms part of the bed of the Roha watercourse, a discarded channel of the Little Gandak. Dev\u00edsth\u00e1n is somewhat less than a mile distant from Kasia, and still rises 49 feet above the surrounding fields. It is probably the ruin of a great brickwork relic-temple; and at its south-eastern foot General Cunningham discovered the remains of a smaller stupa. The wedge-shaped bricks of this latter building showed its diameter to have been 16\u00bd feet only.\n\nNearly 1,600 yards north north-west of the R\u00e1mabh\u00e1r mound lies that known as the castle of the Dead Prince, or Prince M\u00e1tha M\u00e1tha k\u00faar k\u00e1kot. This, which is now covered with scrub-wood and broken bricks, rises over 30 feet above the plain. Some 600 feet in length by from 200 to 300 in breadth, it would seem to have been formed from the ruins of two large buildings and of several small ones. At its highest point stands a Buddhist relic-temple of the usual type, i.e., a round brickwork tower with spherical grass-grown roof. General Cunningham concludes that this tower was built between 200 and 600 A.D., on the d\u00e9bris of some older building. Its original diameter, now somewhat reduced, was about 27\u00bd feet; and its original height would, according to the usual proportion, have been\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, p. 302  \n2 Archaeological Survey Reports, I, 77.\ntwice that figure. Small detached mounds and wedge-shaped bricks seem to show that several lesser stupas must have once adorned the eminence. Towards its north-west end are some rather large spaces quite clear of bricks; and these may be supposed to represent the courtyards or other vacant intervals between the buildings. The mound is shaded in places by fine pipals, sacred trees of the Hind\u00fas. But the total absence of statues seems to show that it was crowned by few or no Hindu temples.\n\nThe Buddhist statue of the \"Dead Prince\" himself lies prostrate some 1,100 feet from the standing stupa just described. Carved from the dark-blue stone of Gaya, it represents Buddha the Ascetic seated under the Bodhi tree near that city. The sculpture is 10\u00bd feet in height by 4\u00bd feet in width; and the figure itself is colossal, the breadth across the shoulders alone being 3 feet 8\u00bd inches.\u00b9 The statue has, however, been split from head to foot and otherwise injured. The short inscription on its pedestal has been almost worn away by constant use as a whetstone. Beside it on the east is a low square mound, once perhaps the site of the temple which enshrined it. By local legend this statue is sometimes described as the remains of a wicked king, who was first petrified and afterwards clef in twain by a holy hermit.\n\nBetween the R\u00e1ma bh\u00e1r and M\u00e1tha k\u00faar mounds lies a lower eminence some 500 feet square, which from its neighbourhood to the village of Anirudhwa or Anrudhwa may be called the Anrudhwa mound. This mound bears some fine pip\u00e1l trees, and some ruins which from their square shape are perhaps the ruins of a Buddhist monastery. The adjacent village clearly derives its name from Aniruddha, the cousin of Buddha. But of both persons more hereafter. General Cunningham identifies the mound and village as the site of the ancient Buddhist city.\n\nTo north and east of the M\u00e1tha k\u00faar mound are a host of low grassy barrows from 3 to 6 feet in height and from 12 to 25 in diameter. That they are tombs General Cunningham is certain. Megasthenes (circ. 300 B.C.) describes the Indian sepulchres as plain tumuli of low earth. But neither here nor elsewhere at Kasia did the General's excavations result in any discovery. An old resident told him that these mounds were called Bh\u00edm\u00e1wat, which perhaps means \"fearsome spots\"; and that ghosts were sometimes seen flitting about them. The common people have a legend that these are the graves of some gypsy tribe once numerous in the neighbourhood.\n\n\u00b9 A sketch of the carving will be found in Buchanan's Eastern India, I.; and of its site in Cunningham's Archaeological Reports, I.\nSuch are the existing remains of Kasia. Its many Buddhist shrines have been effaced by the floods of the Little Gandak, or destroyed to supply material for the humbler structures of surrounding villages. But for over 1,100 years Kusinagara, the city of the holy grass, was a place of importance and sanctity. It was here that, about 550 years before Christ, Buddha died, or in the language of his followers, obtained nirvana. On his death the assembled mendicants were consoled by the venerable seer Aniruddha, who was not only his cousin, but one of his ten great disciples. The gods, said this Aniruddha, were looking down on earth and bewailing the saint with dishevelled hair and uplifted arms. The death, he added, must be announced to the Mallian chieftains. And the Mallian chieftains came with garlands, and bright raiment, and music; and for six days the body lay in state, attended by the people of Kusinagara. On the seventh, when the nobles attempted to lift it for cremation, they found themselves unable to move it. This, explained Aniruddha, was because they intended to carry it into the city by a southern gate; let them carry it through the northern. They assented, and the body was lifted. Bearing it on a bier formed of their lances, they brought it to the coronation-hall of the Mallians. Here was the funeral pile; but the chieftains were unable to ignite it, and Aniruddha said that the gods would prevent its burning till Mah\u0101k\u0101syapa arrived; for Mah\u0101k\u0101syapa had been the saint's chief disciple. At length from Padrauna (P\u0101wa) came this Mah\u0101k\u0101syapa; and when he had opened the end of the pile, it burnt without mortal lighting.\n\nKasia now became a great place of Buddhist pilgrimage, and as such was in the fifth and seventh centuries visited by the Chinese pilgrims. writers Fa Hian and Hwen Thsang respectively. The latter informs us that Buddha died in a s\u0101l-forest rather more than half a mile from the city, that is from the modern Anirudhwa. The forest was at a short distance from the Hiranyakavati or Ajitavati river. This is now called the Little Gandak; but in conversation with General Cunningham a man of Padrauna styled it Hirana, which is of course a relic of the name first given. From these details it may fairly be assumed that Buddha died on the spot now called the Castle of the Dead Prince. On the scene of his death were erected three large and\n\n---\n\n1 Kusa, Poa cynosuroides. In the Buddhist books Kusinagara has several alternative forms, such as Kusinagara, Kusin\u0101ra, and Kusigr\u0101mak\u0101. 2 i.e., emancipation from matter and re-absorption into the essence of the Deity. The Buddhists say that their prophet's death took place on the full moon of Baisakh (April-May) 543 B.C. Buchanan makes the Hirana a feeder of the Little Gandak. But in the districts adjoining the \u0100r\u0101\u1e47\u012b river often desert their beds, which thereon become mere affluents. The name of Hirana may still live in those of more than one branch or affluent of the Little Gandak.\nthree small stupas, all standing in Hwen Thsang's time. The largest, 200 feet in height, had been built about 250 B.C. by Asoka. That monarch also erected here a pillar whose inscription described the nirv\u0101na of Buddha. In a great vih\u0101ra or monastery on the same site was a recumbent statue representing Buddha as about to enter that state. The ruins of this monastery and of Asoka's stupa were by General Cunningham identified with existing remains on the M\u0101tha k\u016bar mound.\n\nOf the city itself Hwen Thsang remarks that its walls are ruined and its interior almost deserted. But that its circuit had formerly been about two miles (12li) was clear from the brickwork foundations then still visible. The ruined mound of Anrudhwa General Cunningham would identify with the palace of the Mallian kings, where according to the Ceylonese account above given Buddha was burnt. But there are other legends as to the exact spot where the cremation took place; and these the General would reconcile by supposing that the R\u0101mabh\u0101r mound was its scene. We know that the place was marked by a famous stupa, and we have already seen that the remains of stupas exist on that mound. Hwen Thsang describes Kusinagara as 116 miles north-east of Benares, and about 148 miles north-west of Vais\u0101li. The distance by modern routes is much the same.\n\nK\u0101zipur or Fazlnagar, a village of parganah Sidhua-Jobna, stands on the meeting of an unmetalled road and a cart-track, 47 miles east-by-south of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 but 419 inhabitants, and is remarkable only as the site of a first-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\nKhakhundu or Khukhundu, a village in tappa Khakhundu of parganah Salempur, stands on the unmetalled road from Gorakhpur to Gathnigh\u00e1t, 44 miles south-east of the former. It has a first-class police-station, and a population by the last census of 1,424. But its chief claims to notice are antiquarian.\n\nThe remains cover nearly one square mile on the southern outskirt of the village. They include a few large tanks and about 30 low mounds bristling with broken bricks and thick scrub-wood. Of the mounds all the largest are square, leaving little doubt that they were once the sites of temples. But the fine trees which now shade their summits, the sacred figs,\u00b9 the bel, and the tamarind, and the siras, have overthrown the houses of the gods.\n\nMost of the mounds (deora) have no special name. The greatest, which lies just between Khakhundu and the hamlet of Parhalahi, is 120 feet square at base and 16 feet in height. One or two have been already ransacked in the\n\n\u00b9 The bany\u0101n, the pipal, and the p\u0101kar are all represented.\nhouse-building peasant's search for bricks; but except Bar\u0101ghon in Bih\u0101r, General Cunningham has seen no place which would still so well repay the excavations of the antiquary. \"Amongst the rubbish,\" he writes, \"we might expect to find both statues and inscriptions, and perhaps other objects, all of which would help to throw light on the rise and progress of modern Br\u0101hmanism, more particularly during the long period of its struggles with expiring Buddhism.\"\n\nBut on the tops of the mounds many ancient and interesting objects are even now visible. There are four-armed figures of Vishnu, and representations of the same god under five of his ten incarnations. There are phallic emblems of Shiva, and statues of himself, his wife P\u0101rvati, and his son Ganesha. So much for stone antiquities; but there are also fragments of walls, of bricks with flower ornaments and other mouldings, and of the plaster that covered the walls. In some cases the remains, whether sculpture or masonry, are distinctly Jain in character. Thus on the pedestal of one statue we see naked or \"sky-clad (digambara)\" figures, and an antelope, the cognizance of the 16th Jain hierarch (t\u012brthankara) Santan\u0101th. In the headdress of a naked figure, which General Cunningham deems to represent Shiva, is a smaller naked figure, which he calls a Buddha. A mutilated four-armed figure in another spot is called Jug-v\u012bra, \"the hero of the age;\" and this title might not unfitly be applied to Mah\u0101-v\u012bra, \"the great hero,\" the 24th hierarch and pontiff of the present age. On a long low mound of bamboo-hidden ruins General Cunningham discovered the remains of an octagonal building which he was inclined to believe a Buddhist relic-temple (stupa).\n\nThough it now contains no Jain residents, Khakhundu has still a Jain temple. This is a small modern structure, square, flat-roofed, and brick-built. Inside, squatting beneath a triple umbrella, is a blue stone figure. Over his head flits an aerial drummer; and on his pedestal is a bull symbolizing the fact that he is Adin\u0101th, the 1st Jain heirarch. By the people, however, he is mistaken for the 23rd, P\u0101ran\u0101th. Another statue, surmounted by a naked Buddha-like figure, resembles that mentioned at the end of the last paragraph. The temple is often visited by Agarw\u0101la Sar\u0101gis from Gorakhpur and Patna, who say that the proper name of the village is Kishkindapura. Kishkinda is the title of a Southern Indian mountain, celebrated in the Lay of R\u0101ma; but coming as it does from a class little distinguished for veracity or learning, the derivation must be distrusted.\n\n1 Arch. Survey Reports, L, 91.\nThe Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Hwen Thsang, who visited Kasia about 635, encountered 30 miles south-west of that city a large town; and in this town dwelt a Br\u00e1hman millionaire who was devoted to Buddhism. From its position one might at first suspect that the town was Rudarpur. But it was on the route from Kasia to Benares, and through Rudarpur that route could not have passed. Such an alignment would have involved the passage of the R\u00fapti as well as the Gh\u00e1gra. General Cunningham is satisfied that the old high road crossed the latter river at some point below its reinforcement by the former; and popular tradition places the ancient ferry at M\u00e1l. The General suggests, therefore, that the town must have been Khakhundu, which by the old winding tracks would have been about 30 miles from Kasia, and which is the most extensive of the several ruined towns in this part of the district.\n\nKh\u00e1nap\u00e1r, or \"the other side of the Kh\u00e1nua,\" stands near that branch of the Little Gandak, in tappa Haveli of parganah Salempur. Fifty-two miles south-east of Gorakhpur as the crow flies, the village is 61 miles distant from that city by road. It in 1872 contained but 1,435 inhabitants, and is remarkable only as the site of a third-class police-station.\n\nKot\u00edbh\u00e1r, a village in tappa Pur\u00e1ni Karhi of parganah Tilpur, stands on the unmetalled road from Gorakhpur to Nichlaval, 40 miles north-east of the former. The population amounted in 1872 to 575 only; but Kot\u00edbh\u00e1r has a third-class police-station and district post-office.\n\nL\u00e1rh or L\u00e1r, a town of tappa Balia and parganah Salempur, is the principal place in the south-eastern corner of the district. Flanking the junction of two unmetalled roads from Gorakhpur and Carhaj respectively, it lies 58 miles south-east of the former. It had in 1872 a population of 4,382 persons.\n\n\"From a distance,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"it looks one of the most imposing towns in the district. It is surrounded by beautiful mango-groves and fields in unusually excellent cultivation. On a closer inspection it is found to contain no building of importance except the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra. The b\u00e1z\u00e1r is narrow and incommodious, and the merchants' houses are mean in the extreme.\" L\u00e1rh has, however, a first-class police-station, a parganah school, and an imperial post-office. It possesses also a hostel (s\u00e1rdi) for travellers; but this a poor structure standing on a site exposed to floods. Besides the im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, which in design and workmanship is the best modern Muslim building in the district, there are two or three\n\n---\n\n1 See articles on Bh\u00e1galpur, Kakdon, and Soh\u00e1ndg.\nmosques. All these places of worship are due to the strong Muhammadan fervour of the Ir\u00e1ki Shaikhs, who are the principal merchants of the town. Though their name would point to a Mesopotamian origin, their physique and appearance indicate an extensive admixture of Hindu blood.\n\nThe Ir\u00e1kis might be called the only enterprising Muslims in the district.\n\nTrade. Exporting to Calcutta and Patna large quantities of grain, spices, indigo, hemp, linseed, and sugar, they import in exchange cloth. This again they export, by way of Dh\u00e1n\u00ed or Nichlav\u00e1l, to Nep\u00e1l. They some time since attempted to start sugar refineries. But the black-ants which abound in the town are said to have impeded the business, and all the sugar of the neighbourhood is now refined at Barhaj. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force at L\u00e1rh; and during 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 208 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 948. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 398), conservancy and public works, amounted to Rs. 614. Of the 901 houses in the town 251 were assessed with the tax, whose incidence was Rs. 2-15-2 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-9 per head of population.\n\nL\u00e1rh has no history. It has however a Hindu temple, whose foundation is ascribed to the descendants of a local saint. Now as this saint had a cow which was carried off by a tiger, his name was probably Vasishta.\u00b9 The stolen animal was rescued by following the trail of foam (l\u00e1r) which had dropped from her mouth. And hence, says tradition, the salivaceous name of L\u00e1r.\n\nMaghar or Hasanpur-Maghar, a parganah of the Head-quarters tahsil, is bounded on the east by parganahs Bha\u00fa\u00e1p\u00e1r and Haveli; on the north by Haveli and parganah Maghar of Basti; on the west by the parganah last named; and on the south by parganah Anola. The greater part of the boundary with Bha\u00fa\u00e1p\u00e1r is formed by the Ami river, and the whole of that with Haveli by the R\u00e1pti. The parganah is divided into the nine tappas of Gahas\u00e1nd, Satgaw\u00e1n, Uttar-Haveli, Aurangabad, Bhar\u015b\u00e1nd, Bhadessari, Suras, Pach\u00far\u00ed or Pachaur\u00ed, and Khaj\u00far\u00ed. It contains 333 of the revenue-divisions called villages. It had in 1878 an area of 74,661 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 62,953.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Maghar contained 264 inhabited sites, of which 149 had less than 200 inhabitants; 89 between 200 and 500; 17 between 500 and 1,000; 8 between 1,000 and 2,000; and one between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 355.\nThe population numbered 65,810 souls (16,113 females), giving 567 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 62,199 Hind\u00fas (29,280 females) and 3,611 Musalm\u00e1ns (1,652 females.) Distributing the Hind\u00fa population among the four great classes, the census shows 8,575 Br\u00e1hmans (4,081 females), 1,619 R\u00e1jputs (710 females), and 2,517 Baniyas (1,212 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 49,488 souls (23,277 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (8,369). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Sakarw\u00e1l (451), Bais, and Solankhi. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (1,427), Agarw\u00e1l, Agarahri, Unai, and Kasaundhan sub-divisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Bind, Teli, Koeri, Ah\u00edr, Loh\u00e1r, Hajj\u00e1m, Cham\u00e1r, Dhobi, Kah\u00e1r, Satw\u00e1r, Gadariy\u00e1, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Nuniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbhar, Son\u00e1r, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Bar\u00e1yi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Thathera, M\u00fali, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e1gi, B\u00e1ri, At\u00edth, Khatik, Bharbhunja, Beld\u00e1r, Kum\u00e1r, Gos\u00e1in, and Jaisw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (1,933), Sayyids (16), Mughals (8), Path\u00e1ns (500), and unspecified.\n\nMaghar is a flat and fairly fertile plain, sloping almost imperceptibly down to the R\u00e1pti. The tract skirting and once formed by that river, a fine alluvial tract famed for its wheat, includes tappas Galas\u00e1nd, Satgawan, Uttar-Haveli, and Aurang\u00e1b\u00e1d. The five remaining tappas, or southern portion of the parganah, are equally if not more productive. But after crossing them the river \u00c1mi forms, as already mentioned, the boundary with Bhan\u00e1p\u00e1r; and the land along its banks is comparatively poor. Here the fields are either low and liable to flooding, or cut into small ravines through which the freshets of the monsoon rush down to join the stream. In tappa Bhadesari are yet left remnants of the forest which once clothed the face of the parganah. Groves of mango and mahua are still numerous elsewhere. But since the time of Buchanan (1835), who describes Maghar as scantily cultivated and covered in great measure by trees, tillage has made rapid strides. The parganah is now as open as any in the district. The soil is chiefly loam (doras); but clay (mattiyar) is not unknown, and along the banks of the R\u00e1pti is a little of the marly bh\u00e1t. A few small lagoons are scattered over the parganah, and the great Bakhira mere intrudes into the north-western corner from Basti. The land adjoining this jhil is subject in the rains to inundation.\n\nThe metalled Gorakhpur and Basti road passes from east to west through the heart of the parganah, and an unmetalled line of the third class spans its north-eastern corner. The navigable R\u00e1pti provides a third trade-route. The principal market villages within\nthe parganah itself are Sahnjanua, Bhiti, Gahasand, Harpur, Pachauri, and Khajuri. But the marts chiefly used by the inhabitants are in the adjoining parganah Maghar of Basti. Such are Mendhawal, Baghnagar, and Hanumanganj. It is almost needless to remark that the one great product of Maghar is its agricultural raw produce.\n\nIts earliest existing colony was that founded by Sarnet Rajputs. In the end of the fourteenth, or beginning of the fifteenth century Ja\u00ef Singh, a grandson of the first raja of Satasi, settled at Maghar, now in Basti. His possessions rapidly extended until their circuit was 84 miles, and he assumed the title of raja. His descendant Bansdeo moved to a place called Komar, which he renamed Bansai; and Ratan, the son of Bansdeo, gave the new capital the additional title of Ratanpur. Hence, in the Institutes of Akbar (1596), Maghar forms part of a larger parganah called Ratanpur or Ratanpur-Bansi. Some twenty years earlier Maghar village had become the quarters of a Musalm\u00e1n garrison; but some thirty years later the raja of Bansai or Maghar expelled the intruders. About 1680 the Musalmans re-occupied the place in force; and it was probably at this time that Maghar, with the Musalm\u00e1n prefix of Hasanpur, was severed from Ratanpur-Bansi. In 1801, on their cession to the British, both Hasanpur-Maghar and Ratanpur-Bansi became separate parganahs of Gorakhpur, and on the separation of Basti, in 1865, twenty tappas of the former and the whole of the latter were transferred to the newly-formed district. Since thus shorn the parganah has not been subjected to any fresh assessment of land-revenue. What portion of former demands fell on its remaining nine tappas is uncertain; and those demands need not, therefore, be shown.\n\nMaharajganj, the head-quarters of the tahsil so named, is a village of tappa Sonari and parganah Haveli. The terminus of a third-class unmetalled branch from the road between Gorakhpur to Nichlaval, it stands 36 miles north-east-by-north of the former. Its population amounted in 1872 to 1,249 only.\n\nThe tahsil is a strong masonry building which cost over Rs 20,000, and might be defended against a force which lacked artillery. But this is not the only Government establishment at Maharajganj. There are a first-class police-station, an imperial post-office, and a branch dispensary. The patients attending the last suffer chiefly from goitre and fever. The neighbourhood of the Tarai and of the Sonari forest render the surrounding country unhealthy. And this circumstance, together with its isolation, makes Maharajganj as unpopular a station amongst native officials as Padrauna. An excise godown\nwhich formerly existed has been closed, and its materials are being utilized in the construction of a new building which will house the dispensary.\n\nThe tahsil establishment was removed hither from Mans\u00farganj about 1870, when the increased land-revenue of the northern parganahs demanded its location nearer the northern frontier.\n\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj, a tahsil with court and treasury at the place just described, is bounded on the north-north-east by the Gandak river, which divides it from the Champ\u00e1ran district, and for a much longer distance by Nep\u00e1l; on the north-west by the Gh\u00fanghi river, which divides it from Nep\u00e1l and the Basti district; on the west by Basti, the rivers Dhamela and R\u00e1pti supplying some two-thirds of the boundary; on south-by-west again by the R\u00e1pti and Basti, and by the Head-quarters and H\u00e1ta tahsils; on the east-south-east by the Padrauna tahsil, and for a short distance by the Gandak and Champ\u00e1ran. Tahsil Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj contains the whole of parganahs Tilpur and Bin\u00e1yakpur, with 12 tappas of parganah Haveli. It had in 1878 an area of 782,164 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 2,74,074. Its population amounted in 1872 to 355,504 persons, or about 259 to the square mile. But further details concerning the tahsil will be found in the articles on its three parganahs.\n\nMajhauli and Salempur, adjoining villages of tappa Haveli and parganah Salempur, stand on either bank of the Little Gandak river, 53 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. They may be considered as one town, of which Majhauli is the Hindu and Salempur the Musalm\u00e1n quarter. In 1872 they had between them a population of 4,850 persons, amongst whom R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, and Muslims were largely represented.\n\nThe more ancient of the two is Majhauli, which rises on the north or left bank of the river. Here are the residence of the Majhauli r\u00e1jas, four temples of Shiva, and a parganah school. In Salempur on the right bank are an imperial post-office, two mosques, and a market-place. The markets are held every Wednesday and Saturday; and to them the crops are conveyed along the Gorakhpur and Gathnigh\u00e1t road, which passes through Salempur.\n\nThe Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force at Salempur-Majhauli.\n\nDuring 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, together with a balance of Rs. 169 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 891. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 480), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 642. Of the 797 houses in the united villages, 310 were assessed with the tax, whose incidence was Rs. 2-5-4 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-1 per head of population.\n\"In connection with this town,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"it may be interesting to give some account of the great Bisen house of Majhauli, certainly the most important of the ruling families in Gorakhpur. It claims descent from an ascetic called Mew\u00e1r or Mayur Bhat. There are various accounts of his origin. Some say he came from Hastin\u00e1pur and was the son of one Ashwa Th\u00e1ma; others that he was an emigrant from the Panchbati Mahar\u00e1shtrades. He read Sanskrit for a while at Benares, and became a proficient in astrology. Quitting that city at last under a divine impulse, he settled in Kakr\u00e1dih village of parganah Sikandarpur in Azamgarh. The whole of that parganah gradually became his own. He had three wives, the first a Br\u00e1hmani named Nagseni; the second S\u00farajprabha, a S\u00farajbans Rajp\u00fat\u00f1i; and the third Haikum\u00e1ri, a Gautam Bh\u00fa\u00ednh\u00e1rin. But besides these he had a Kurmin concubine. He is said to have been a contemporary of Bikram\u00e1jit of Ujjain. By his wife S\u00farajprabha he had a son, Biswa or Bissu Sen, the ancestor of the Bises; by Haikum\u00e1ri, a son Balkal or Bagmar S\u00e1hi, the ancestor of the Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r families of Kuw\u00e1ri and Tamk\u00fahi; by Nagseni, a son Nages, Nagesar, or Nagsen; and by his concubine a son Indardawwan Mal. At this time the west part of parganah Salempur was held by three Bhar brothers, of whom the chief was Suraha of Surauli, while B\u00edru held Bairauna and N\u00edru the fort of Nai. Taking advantage of the opportunity afforded by the marriage of Suraha's daughter, Mayur captured the Surauli fort. This seems a common narrative in connection with the early R\u00e1jput conquest, and is told in other places in connection with the downfall of the Bhars and Thatheras. Mayur then founded a fort in Kundilpur of tappa Haveli, which is now called Kunara, and lies about two miles south-east of Majhauli. All his wives came to live there; but his Kurmin concubine lingered on at the old castle of Kakr\u00e1dih. S\u00e1ran district was then held by Chakra Nar\u00e1yan R\u00e1jbhar. Mayur conquered him also. In his old he surrendered the kingdom to Biswa Sen and went off on a pilgrimage to the Him\u00e1laya, where he died. From Indardawwan Mal, who remained in possession of Kakr\u00e1dih, a large Kurmi house has sprung. To the third brother, Balkal, Biswa Sen gave the north-eastern portion of his kingdom, that portion which now forms the T\u00e1mkuhi and Hathwa estates. Nagsen, the fourth brother, got some villages near Majhauli and planted the Chaubaria R\u00e1jpats to watch the frontier. After Biswa Sen came 79 generations, all of whom retained the title of Sen. The 80th r\u00e1ja, Hardeo Sen, obtained for his bravery the title of Mal from one of the Dehli emperors. Then followed 23 generations, of whom nothing is known but their names.\n\n1 Beames' Elliot, I., 42, and supra, pp. 353, 354, 438. 2 Oudh Gazetteer, II., 65, 107, 408. 3 See article on Surauli.\nFor the r\u00e1jas who followed some scraps of history may be gathered from papers in possession of the Dharmner branch of the family. Bh\u00edm Mal, who reigned from 1311 to 1366 A.D., is said to have been arrested for arrears of revenue by Mub\u00e1r\u00e1k Khilji. Despatched to Dehli, he was there condemned to be crushed to death by an elephant, but showed such bravery that he was released and restored to his kingdom. The fact that nothing is really known of the r\u00e1j till the fourteenth century seems to show that this was the true period of its origin. This is indeed about the time given by the Oudh R\u00e1jputs, such as the Sombanais, Nikumbhs, and Kati\u00e1s. As to the immediate successors of Bh\u00edm Mal, we have only the dates of their accessions and deaths. But Bodh Mal, who is said to have succeeded in 1564, is also said to have been arrested by Akbar for default of revenue. He was sent to Dehli, converted to Muhammananism and called Muhammad Salm\u00edn. On his return the R\u00e1ni refused to allow him into the Majhauli castle. He therefore settled at the town of Nagar, on the opposite bank of the Little Gandak, and founded the town of Salempur; while the r\u00e1n\u00ed managed the r\u00e1j during the minority of her son Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Mal. As it goes on the chronicle has nothing of interest. Bhaw\u00e1n\u00ed Mal was succeeded by his brother Lachhmi Mal, whose grandson, Part\u00e1p Mal, became r\u00e1ja of Bh\u00e1galpur. Then followed Bhim Mal and Shi\u00fa Mal. On the latter's death the estate was managed by his mother, Bachana Kunwari. Aj\u00edt Mal was r\u00e1ja from 1753 to 1805. During his time the British took over the district. His wife, Dilr\u00e1j Kunwari, had a daughter who married the r\u00e1ja of Rewah. Dilr\u00e1j Kunwari administered the r\u00e1j till 1815. Then followed Tej Mal from 1815 to 1843, when the present r\u00e1ja, Udai Nar\u00e1yan Mal, succeeded. By a career of extravagance and bad management he ruined his estate. Finally it was in 1870 put under the Court of Wards, in whose charge it still remains.\n\n\"Among the Gorakhpur Bisens the chief families are those of Narharpur in parganah Chill\u00fapar and of Baikunthpur, Dharmner and Mahend in Salempur. In the parganah last named the Misrs of Piy\u00e1si in tappa Bhitni of Dogari in tappa Donr, and of Rew\u00e1li in tappa Ballia, all claim kinship with the family through Nagseni, wife of May\u00far Bhat. Connected with them are the Misrs of Chainpur and Charnadih in Azamgarh. Similarly, through May\u00far Bh\u00e1t's Kurmin concubine the Kurmis of Madhoban and Lakhnaur in Azamgarh assert their relationship with the Bisens. But while accepting the Br\u00e1hman connection, the Majhauli family disclaim any kindred with the Kurmis. They admit their cousinhood with the Oudh R\u00e1jas of R\u00e1mpur Bhinga and\n\n1 Oudh Gazetteer, II, 63-5, 318-19, 429. 2 The title is now extinct. 3 The title of r\u00e1ja, once held by this branch of the tribe, was forfeited for rebellion.\nM\u00e1nikpur, but assert that these houses were all founded by cadets of the Majhauli family.\n\n\"They assert that their territory was originally bounded by the Gh\u00e1gra, the R\u00e1pti, and the Nar\u00e1yani or Great Gandak rivers. If so, very little is now left of their former greatness. They have generation after generation proved improvident and bad administrators. They have never produced a single man of any note. Still they have made good marriages with the Sarnets of B\u00e1nsi, Rudarpur, and Anaula; with the S\u00farajbans families of Mah\u00fali in Basti; with the Kausiks of Barhi\u00e1p\u00e1r and Gop\u00e1lpur; with the Hayobans of Hardi in Ballia; with the Gabarw\u00e1rs of M\u00e1nda in Allahabad and Bijaipur in Mirz\u00e1pur; with the Baghels of Rewah, and with the Chandels of Agori-Barhar and Bijaigarh in Mirz\u00e1pur.\"\n\n\"The Majhauli castle or kot is a block of commonplace brick building on a sandy bluff overlooking the Little Gandak river. All the present structures are modern in date and of no military strength. The castle occupies however a position which in resolute hands, and particularly in the rainy season, would be capable of defence. But the Majhauli Bisens never seem to have been a fighting race. In their great contest with the Sat\u00e1s\u00ed r\u00e1j they lost parganah Silhat; and since then proprietary rights have been conferred on the Br\u00e1hman birtiyas in many of their best villages.\"\n\nMans\u00farganj, a village containing a third-class police station and an imperial post-office, lies in tappa Padkhori of parganah Haveli, 18 miles north-east-by-east of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 a population of 675. What was known as the Mans\u00farganj jurisdiction at the time of Buchanan's survey contained a great part of parganahs Haveli and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. The tahsil itself was at Mans\u00farganj, and the building which housed it is now used as the police-station. Broken up about 1870, the tahsil was distributed between the Head-quarters and H\u00e1ta jurisdictions. The tahsil offices were then removed to Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj.\n\nMotir\u00e1m ka Udda or Adda Motir\u00e1m is a police outpost on the Deoriya road, 8 miles south-east of Gorakhpur. It is also known as Ch\u00e1h shikasta, or the broken well, the well in question being a large masonry structure in the forest hard by. The outpost, which lies amidst dense sal woods, was established here to watch the road and protect travellers from the gangs of Doms and other robbers who formerly infested the neighbourhood. They have long since been dispersed and the road is now as safe as any other in the district. The climate of the place is very feverish in the rains. It\ncontains a few huts only and its population is not separately shown. In the forest around it are found leopards, deer, and pigs.\n\nMusela or Mi\u00faela, a village on the unmetalled road from Gorakhpur to L\u00e1rh, lies 46 miles south-east of the former, in tappas Khakhundu and Puraina of parganah Salempur. The village consists of Little Musela in the former and Great Musela in the latter tappa. It had in 1872 a population of 153 souls only; but has a district post-office.\n\nNichlav\u00e1la, an ancient market village of tappa Kh\u00e1s and parganah Tilpur, stands on the meeting of several unmetalled roads and cross-country tracks, 51 miles north-east by north of Gorakhpur. The principal road is that from Gorakhpur itself. Nichlav\u00e1la had in 1872 a population of 1,098 inhabitants, and is the principal mart in the north of the district. It is, moreover, the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office. Not many miles distant stand the ruins of a castle which is said to have been the scene of a sharp fight during the Nepalese campaign.\n\nPadrauna or Parauna, the head-quarters of the tahsil so named, is a cluster of five villages in tappas Pakri-Gangr\u00e1ni and Barg\u00e1on of parganah Sidhua-Jobna. It stands on the banks of the B\u00e1nri watercourse and the junction of several unmetalled roads, 49 miles east-by-north of Gorakhpur. Its population amounted in 1872 to 5,092 souls. The villages composing the town stand on a forest-grant whose population was by former censuses lumped together with that of the town itself. And to this day the town is called Jangal Padrauna, or Padrauna-forest.\n\nThe B\u00e1nri watercourse which passes through the site of Padrauna was once probably a bed or branch of the Great Gandak. This idea is suggested not only by its appearance and direction, but from the fact that in making during the late scarcity (1877-78) a tank near his house, the chief (r\u0101j) of Padrauna unearthed a large boat. The B\u00e1nri is now, however, a running stream in the rainy season only. Even then it cannot be called a river, as its course ends in a succession of large pools which have no defined outlet. Hence perhaps the name of B\u00e1nri or \"tail-less.\" The overflow of these pools, and the succession of stagnant puddles to which the watercourse is reduced in summer, are accused of rendering Padrauna malarious. But malaria is not its only malady. Goitre (ghegra) is very common in the neighbourhood, and there are an unusual number of the partially dumb-idiotics called baug, who in trying to make themselves understood go through most unpleasant facial contortions.\n\n1 Supra pp. 414-15. 2 P. 454, ad fin. 3 See pp. 286-88, 350-51.\nThe chief of Padrauna, popularly but wrongly styled its r\u00e1ja,\\(^1\\) is a Kurmi; and to this and other low castes most of the population belong. Padrauna is not, therefore, what the high-caste Hindu is willing to consider a nice place; and he has expressed his contempt for it in the following couplets:\n\n\"Marne ch\u00e9ho, m\u00e4r na kh\u00e9,\nChalo, chalo, Parauna j\u00e9.\"\n\n\"Should you want to die, don't kill yourself; but go, go to Padrauna.\"\n\n\"Kurmi r\u00e1ja, marwa an, B\u00e1nri nadi, khaird ban;\nR\u00e1ja praja ekhi rang, ghar ghar n\u00e1che m\u00fasal chand.\"\n\n\"The r\u00e1ja is but a Kurmi, the grain is but marwa millet, the river is but the B\u00e1nri, the forest is but of catechu acacias.\n\n\"R\u00e1ja and retainers are just alike; from house to house the only thing that dances is the pestle in the mortar.\"\n\nBy omitting negatives and other means the inhabitants have ingeniously attempted to pervert these proverbs into expressions of admiration. But their readings meet with little support; and whatever the reading, it is still deemed an insult to recite one of these couplets to a Padrauna man.\n\nPadrauna proper stands in tappa Pakri-Gangr\u00e1ni; but the other important components of the town, Chh\u00e1oni and S\u00e1hibganj, are parts of tappa Barg\u00e1on. Chh\u00e1oni is so called because it was a cantonment of the Oudh Naw\u00e1b's forces; S\u00e1hibganj is so called because founded by an English indigo-factor, Finch S\u00e1hib. The former is the market-place; the latter is the head-quarters of a colony of very enterprising M\u00e1rw\u00e1ri merchants, who deal in cloth and trade with Nep\u00e1l. It is also the site of a Government schoolhouse, an excise godown, and an indigo factory, which is unoccupied partly on account of its unhealthiness. Padrauna has besides these buildings a small though strong tahs\u00edli, a first-class police-station, and an imperial post-office. In the north of the township are two temples called Shy\u00e1m-dh\u00e1m and R\u00e1mdh\u00e1m. The former was built about 65 years ago by Ishwari Prat\u00e1p, chief of Padrauna; and the latter about 25 years ago by his son, the present r\u00e1i. Near these temples is a grove whose trees were brought from a sacred plantation at Mathura; and between them has been made a reservoir filled by the B\u00e1nri. This reservoir is called Bh\u00fap's Ocean (Bh\u00fap sag\u00e1r), after Bh\u00fap Singh, a reputed ancestor of the Padrauna family. That family, writes Mr. Crooke, \"have always been devotees; and the collection of modern temples erected by them is probably the finest in the district. The present chief's house is an imposing cluster of buildings.\"\n\n\\(^1\\) No such title finds its way into the official list of r\u00e1jas and naw\u00e1bs for the North-Western Provinces.\nThe Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force at Padrauna; and during House-tax. 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 79 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 829. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 382), conservancy, and public works amounted to Rs. 626. Of the 821 houses in the town 322 were assessed with the tax, the incidence being Rs. 2-5-3 per house assessed and Re. 0-2-5 per head of population.\n\nIn Chh\u00e1oni, which lies south of Padrauna proper, is a large mound Antiquities. covered with broken brick and surmounted by a few statues. Buddhist. Two hundred and twenty feet in length from west to east, it is 120 feet broad, and at its western end rises 14 feet above the surrounding fields. A long trench on this higher or western side looks as if it had once formed the matrix of a wall since dug out for the sake of its bricks.\\(^1\\) Bricks sufficient for two houses had in 1861-62 been already excavated from a parallel wall whose traces were still visible on the eastern side. General Cunningham\\(^2\\) concludes, therefore, that the mound must have been the site of a conventual Buddhist courtyard, about 100 feet square, with cells on each side for the accommodation of the monks. In the centre of the yard, whose entrance was seemingly on the eastern side, stood probably a stupa or relic-temple. We know that on the cremation of Buddha\u2019s corpse the people of Padrauna or P\u00e1wa obtained one-eighth of the relics; and General Cunningham\u2019s excavations discovered wedge-shaped bricks of two sizes, such as the circular Buddhist stupas were always built of. Besides these traces of two relic-temples was unearthed the base of a grey sandstone pillar. And pillars of Asoka or some other Buddhist ruler are generally found in association with stupas.\n\nIn a small roofless brick building a short distance north of these remains are a few old statues. The temple is dedicated to H\u00e1thi Bhaw\u00e1ni, or the Bhaw\u00e1ni of elephants, that is, perhaps to the goddess as mother of Ganesha. Rude votive figures of elephants in baked clay lie scattered about. But the idol from which the temple derived its name was not that of a Hindu goddess, but of some naked Jain saint squatting under a triple umbrella. Since this statue was sketched by Buchanan,\\(^3\\) about 1835, it has disappeared. Its pedestal has been broken into three portions, each containing a more or less perfect figure. Two represent seated Buddhas, and the third a naked female nursing a baby. These fragments are still visible on the mound, and the remainder of the pedestal is preserved in the village. Buchanan\n\n\\(^1\\) Buchanan tells us that the trench was actually made \u201cin search of materials for building\u201d by a tahsild\u00e1r named Sakht\u00e1t-ul-lah (circa 1815). \\(^2\\) Archaeological Survey Reports, I, 74. \\(^3\\) Eastern India, plate I, fig. 2.\ntells us that when the big Jain statue was set up to represent a Hindu goddess, a devotee attached to the Oudh forces then at Padrauna indignantly smote off a part of its face with his sword.\n\nAbout four miles east of Padrauna is the tomb of Burhan the martyr (shahid). At this, which is said to be of great antiquity, flowers, oil, coppers, and bannocks (chapati) are still offered. A few votaries seem to gather for the purpose of worshipping it every Thursday night. This Burh\u00e1n was perhaps a comrade of the almost mythical S\u00e1l\u00e1r-i-Masa\u00fad. The tomb of a martyr so called is still shown at Bud\u00e1\u00fan, where he is said to have been one of S\u00e1l\u00e1r\u2019s principal officers.\n\nGeneral Cunningham identifies Padrauna with P\u00e1wa, a place which the Buddhist P\u00e1li annals mention as exactly the same distance away from Kusinagara or Kas\u00eda. The old name of Padravana, he says, might easily have been corrupted into Padar-ban, Parban, P\u00e1wan, and P\u00e1wa. If Padrauna is the same as P\u00e1wa, it must be at least 2,430 years old, for the latter place is mentioned in connection with Buddha\u2019s death. In the beginning of the fifteenth century, when the neighbourhood was ruled by Madan Sen, his family priest, Rasu Musahar, is said to have worshipped at a temple on the old mound. But the buildings of the existing Padrauna are modern. The place seems to have been refounded about 90 years ago by Gop\u00e1l, first chief of Padrauna; and its Sahibganj quarter is some 40 years younger.\n\nPadrauna, a tahsil with court and treasury at the palace just mentioned, will be described in the article on its one parganah, Sidhua-Jobna, wherewith it is co-extensive and identical.\n\nPaikauli, a large village in tappa Surauli of parganah Salempur, stands about 7 miles south-west of Deoriya, and had in 1872 a population of 1,596 inhabitants. It belongs to a family of Chaubaria Rajputs. The place is remarkable for a large math or monastery occupied by Vaishnava Bair\u00e1gis, whose prior or mahant is known as the Panh\u00e1ri ji. The title is said to be derived from Phal Ah\u00e1ri, because he eats fruits only, rejecting grain and meat. Greatly respected by natives, he spends his time wandering about this and the Saran districts. The shrine or monastery has been established in Paikauli for 52 years, and there are branch establishments at Ajudhia of Faizabad, Barhalganj, and Baikunthpur.\n\n1 See Gazr., V., 99,157. 2 Eastern India, II., 335-36; and supra p. 437. 3 This article has been kindly contributed by Mr. Crooke. 4 See article on Surauli. 5 For some account of the Bair\u00e1gis see Gazr., V., 591.\nThe prior presides at several religious fairs, of which the following are the principal:\n\n| District | Place                  | Time                                      |\n|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Gorakhpur| Baikunthpur            | Aghau (November-December), bright half 5th.|\n|          | Dohari Barhalganj      | As\u00e1r\u00e1h (June-July), bright half 3rd.      |\n|          | Sohan\u00e1g                | Bais\u00e1kh (April-May), bright half 3rd.     |\n| S\u00e1ran    | Sirkarpur              | K\u00e1rt\u00edtk (October-November), bright half 10th.|\n| Gh\u00e9zipur | Dadri Chatthar         | Ditto ditto full moon.                    |\n\nThe late mahant Siya R\u00e1m D\u00e1s died last year (1879), and has been succeeded by Ajudhia Parsh\u00e1d Tiw\u00e1ri of Mahu\u00e1n\u00ed in parganah Kopamau of Azamgarh. The monastery is supported by contributions of grain and other offerings presented by worshippers. The prior has refused to accept landed property. His disciples give vivid accounts of the dangers his predecessor experienced in carrying on his pilgrimages during the mutiny. There are no fine buildings at Paikauli; but the Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra and some extensive sheds for the accommodation of the ascetics deserve notice.\n\nPaina, a town in tappa Raipur of parganah Salempur, stands on the unmetalled Barhaj and L\u00e1rh road, near the left bank of the Gh\u00e1gra and 44 miles south-east-by-south of Gorakhpur. It in 1872 had 5,331 inhabitants.\n\nThe name is locally derived from paina, a stick or goad for plough-cattle. It is said that on coming to the Gh\u00e1gra to perform some religious austerities a devotee begged and obtained from the prince of the time a stick\u2019s length of land. On this narrow space he lived for many years; on it when he died was built a shrine, and around the shrine sprung up a village. That village still contains two temples of Shiva. It has, moreover, a Government school, where Urdu and Hindi are taught.\n\nMany of the inhabitants are boatmen (mall\u00e1h), who live by conveying traffic up and down the Gh\u00e1gra, between Barhaj and Patna. But the chief castes of the village are the R\u00e1jput and herdsman (Ah\u00edr). In the mutiny the landholders plundered and obstructed the Government commissariat trains. To punish them a small force under Mr. Collector Bird occupied the village, which was afterwards confiscated and bestowed on the loyal r\u00e1ja of Majhauli. It is said that the occupying levies carried off some of the R\u00e1jput women; and none of the neighbouring R\u00e1jput families will even yet give their daughters in marriage to the thus disgraced Paina Chhatris.\nPaisiya, Pi\u00e1siya, or Naikot,\u00b9 a village on the Nep\u00e1l border, stands in tappa Mirchw\u00e1r of pargansh Bin\u00e1yakpur, 40 miles in a direct line north of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 a population of 397, and is the site of a third-class police-station and district post-office. The village is situated near a large marsh called the Ainjar T\u00e1l, which is fed by the overflow of the neighbouring Gh\u00fanghi river. The staple crop of the neighbourhood is Aghani or winter rice. In the rains the flooded condition of the neighbourhood renders approach to the village very difficult.\n\nPanera or Kam\u00e1sin, a village of tappa Banki and parganah Haveli, stands on the unmetalled Captainganj and K\u00e1rmainigh\u00e1t road, 24 miles in a direct line north-by-east of Gorakhpur. It in 1872 had 1,588 inhabitants. The surrounding country has been lately cleared, but there still survives a considerable space of forest. Panera has a third class police-station and district post-office. The proprietors are Ah\u00edrs. There is nothing of any interest in the neighbourhood.\n\nPipr\u00e1ich, a small market and post town in tappa Pattra of parganah Haveli, stands on the Pharend river and unmetalled Padrauna road, 13 miles east north-east of Gorakhpur. The population of 1872 was 2,208.\n\nThe market flanks either side of the road as it passes through the town. A short distance west of that town the Pharend or Phren is crossed by a rude wooden bridge. The market is held weekly; there is a fair local trade in grain, cloth, and metal vessels; a good deal of sugar is refined; and Pipr\u00e1ich may be considered the head-quarters of the sugar trade in its own part of Haveli. But it is not a thriving place. With some adjoining estates it is included in the untaxed domain of the Gorakhpur Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib.\u00b2\n\nThe progress of the market has been checked by competition with the neighbouring and rival mart of Sidh\u00e1wa, the property of Government treasurer Sarju Parsh\u00e1d. The only buildings are a new third-class police-station, an imperial post-office, a Government elementary (halkabandi) school, and a temple of Mah\u00e1deo on the banks of the Phren.\n\nThe school will shortly be housed in a new structure which the Mi\u00e1n S\u00e1hib has promised to erect near the police-station. In the same locality is one of the old round towers built in more disorderly times for the safe custody of treasure on its way to head-quarters. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force at Pipr\u00e1ich; and during 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 75 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 525. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 192), conservancy,\n\n\u00b9 This and the three following articles are from the pen of Mr Crooke. \u00b2 Supra p. 40.\nand public works, amounted to Rs. 405. Of the 431 houses in the town 120 were assessed with the tax, the incidence being Rs. 3-12-0 per house assessed and Re. 0-3-3 per head of population.\n\nR\u00e1mkola, a large agricultural village held by R\u00e1jput proprietors, lies in tappa P\u00e1pur of parganah Sidhua-Jobna. Through it passes the unmetalled road from Padrauna to Gorakhpur, and its distance east north-east of the latter is 38 miles. The population amounted in 1872 to 2,058 persons.\n\nR\u00e1mkola has a third-class police-station, a district post-office, and a tahs\u00edli school. The last-named institution is sparsely attended, and its removal to the S\u00e1hibganj market-place of Padrauna is contemplated.\n\nRampur-Kh\u00e1npur, a village in tappa Patna of parganah Sh\u00e1jah\u00e1npur, had in 1872 a population of 2,308 inhabitants. Its distance east south-east of Gorakhpur by road is 38 miles.\n\nHere the Chaukidari Act (XX. of 1856) is in force. In 1877-78, the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 323 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 1,209. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 306) conservancy and public works, amounted to Rs. 687. Of the 630 houses in the village 108 were assessed with the tax, whose incidence was Rs. 8-3-3 per house assessed and Re. 0-6-2 per head of population.\n\nR\u00e1niqhat is a village on the Little Gandak river in tappa Gh\u00e1ti of parganah Salempur. Lying 46 miles in a direct line south-east of Gorakhpur, it had in 1872 a population of 206 souls. Here, on the banks of the river, are the remains of a very large fort, concerning which nothing is accurately known. It was probably one of the strongholds raised to guard the passage of the river by the early R\u00e1jput invaders.\n\nRigauli, a village in the tappa so called of parganah Haveli, is the site of a third-class police-station and an imperial post-office. Built near the junction of the R\u00e1pti and Dhamela rivers, and the point where the Captainganj and K\u00e1rmaini-gh\u00e1t road meets their united stream, it lies 20 miles in a direct line north-by-west of Gorakhpur. The population amounted in 1872 to 667. Near Rigauli is the K\u00e1rmaini-gh\u00e1t ferry over the R\u00e1pti. The adjoining country is very much cut up by old channels of that river, the Dhamela, and their numerous affluents. It is also liable to inundation from lagoons.\n\nThere is a small market-place; and a colony of Manih\u00e1rs or Ch\u00farih\u00e1rs carry on the manufacture of glass or lac bracelets (ch\u00fari).\n\nRudarpur, next to Gorakhpur the largest town in the district, lies in parganah Nagw\u00e1n Tikar of parganah Silhat, 27 miles south-east-by-south of\n\n---\n\n1 This article has been compiled mainly from a note by Mr. T. Stoker, C.S. But further aid has been derived from the memoranda of Messrs. Alexander and Crooke; from Mr. Planck's sanitary report for 1870; and from Buchanan's Eastern India.\nGorakhpur. An unmetalled road from that city to Barhaj is here met by two similar highways from H\u00e1ta and Deoria respectively. The population amounted in 1872 to 6,491; but if adjacent hamlets were included in the estimate, would perhaps amount to about 9,000.\n\nThis Rudrapur or Rudarpur must not be confused with the village so named in parganah Anola. To prevent such confusion it has long been the local practice to spell the former Rudarpur and the latter Rudrapur. But the distinction is not always as clear to outsiders as it might be, and it is a pity that the two places were not differentiated in the same manner as the two Fatehganjes of Bareilly; the Rudarpur of Silhat being called Rudarpur East and the Rudarpur of Anola Rudarpur West.\n\nRudarpur is an isolated country-town situated in the midst of a wild much-broken landscape, the watershed of the Majhna and Kurna rivers. The Majhna sometimes takes the name of its affluent, the Pharend; but is here most often called the Bathua. Running close by the town, on the west, a deep though narrow stream, it is in the rains navigable by boats which ascend from the R\u00e1pti. The Kurna, dry in summer, passes Rudarpur on the south-east. The town itself occupies a fairly raised and well-drained site on the Majhna slope of the watershed. But during the monsoon, when the flow of the neighbouring rivers is blocked back by the flooded R\u00e1pti, a good deal of water accumulates around it. In the same season a good deal of dirt and refuse is washed down to stagnate in the many excavations of the town. For though largely built of ancient brick, Rudarpur has many a hut constructed of mud quarried on the spot.\n\nWest of the town, almost as far as the R\u00e1pti, extends a great but uncultivated plain. On the north the land was but lately reclaimed from forest, and is still held as a forest-grant.\u00b9 The only traces of forest now left are a few stunted sal clumps, and many mahua trees, which on account of their vinous flowers have been allowed to remain in the fields. On the east a large tract of rather uneven waste stretches towards Deoria. On the south is the junction of the two rivers. As the surrounding country affords great facilities for grazing, many cattle are herded in the town at night. Rudarpur is then said to contain more bullocks than human beings. Cowsheds are numerous in or about the many unmade spaces sometimes called roads; and a considerable number of pigs is kept. It may therefore be gathered that the inhabitants are chiefly low-caste Hind\u00fas; and this is indeed the case. The Khat\u00edk pig-breeders live in the north-east, the Cham\u00e1r curriers in the east of the town. In the midst of the Cham\u00e1rtola quarter, occupied by the latter,\n\n\u00b9 Supra pp. 386-88.\nMr. Planck once observed a gigantic manure-heap which was \"quite a considerable hillock.\" The abundance of manure renders the outskirts of the town particularly fertile. The market-gardens, fenced in with prickly pear or other hedges, produce especially fine tobacco. Water lies some 25 feet from the surface, and there are many large wells, of which not a few furnish water as good for drinking as for irrigation.\n\nSince Mr. Planck's visit (1870) the sanitation of the town has been much improved and several roads have been made. Its principal place of business is the Gola or grain-market on the banks of the Majhna. This market is of moderate size, and the landing-slope which connects it with the river is steep. It consists of two open but shady spaces, on which three roads concentrate. Both the spaces and the roads are flanked by some good shops. From the former a short and tortuous watercourse passes down to the river. The road ascending northwards from the Gola has a cluster of well-built brick houses belonging chiefly to Baniyas; but beside it stand the imperial post-office and branch dispensary. The last-named institution was built and mainly supported by the late r\u0101ni of Sat\u0101si;\u00b9 and since her death its chances of permanence have become small. Her representatives have already announced their intention of discontinuing the subscription with which she was wont to enrich the Government elementary school. That school is housed in one of the old buildings forfeited for the rebellion of the late r\u0101ja. The only Government establishment remaining to be noticed is the first-class police-station. Perhaps the tidiest part of the town is the large quarter inhabited by fortune-tellers (Bhenduria). On the whole Rudarpur has a prosperous, if somewhat neglected and decayed appearance.\n\nIt is still a rich place. Amongst inhabitants are a large number of saltpetre-workers and metallurgists. The Gola has a very thriving aspect, and is the entrep\u00f4t whence the grain and gur syrup of the neighbourhood are exported by river. Some of this trade is said to reach Calcutta. But except by river the trade is purely local. It is prevented from developing by the cordon of quagmires which, created in the rains, at most seasons opposes wheeled communication with the rest of the district. The Chaukid\u0101ri Act (XX of 1856) is in force at Rudarpur; and in 1877-78, the house-tax thereby imposed, added to a balance of Rs. 283 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 1,983. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 738), conservancy, and public works, amounted to Rs. 1,420. Of the 1,427 houses in the town 196 were assessed\n\n\u00b9 See last paragraph of this article.\nwith the tax; the incidence being Rs. 8-2-8 per house assessed and Re. 0-3-11 per head of population.\n\nBut it is for its antiquities that Rudarpur is chiefly remarkable. Out-\n\nAntiquities and side it on the north-east is the ruined fort named after its history. traditional founder S\u00e1han's or S\u00e1h's castle (S\u00e1hankot or S\u00e1hkot). But S\u00e1han's claim to the honour of its foundation is not undis-\n\nputed. It has been above\u00b9 mentioned that the old name of Rudarpur was Hansakshetra or Gosfield; and that after the second destruction of Ajudhya, about 512 B.C., a R\u00e1jput prince named Vasishta Singh fled hither and founded a stronghold called New K\u00e1shi, that is New Benares. When Vasishta had completed 999 out of the 1,000 temples with which he had intended to adorn his fortress, he was overwhelmed by the Bhars and other \"impure\" tribes. The new masters of Rudarpur were probably Buddhists; and Mr. Carlisle\u00b2 believes that S\u00e1hankot was once a castle of the Maurya kings. It was perhaps held by the same masters as the similar S\u00e1hankot at Upadaulia of R\u00e1jdh\u00e1n\u00ed, about 12 miles distant. Buchanan adds that the goose from whom Hansakshetra or Hansatirtha derives its name was the emblem of Brahma, and that Brahma was the same as the Mah\u00e1 Muni of the Buddhists. But the present ruins are undoubtedly the remains of a castle built on the old site by Rudra or Rudar Singh Sarnet, R\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1si. He flourished towards the close of the seventeenth century, and from him Rudarpur derives its name. The etymology which connects the town with the god Rudra or Shiva is worthless.\n\nThe castle is now a quadrangle about 350 yards square, enclosed by a great mound of brick which rises some 40 feet above the surrounding country. In Buchanan's time there seem to have existed traces of a wall six feet thick; and from the d\u00e9bris of this wall the mound is of course formed. Around it runs a moat which in places has been filled up; and along its eastern side, about 200 yards from its base, runs the Majhna. On the south-eastern corner are remains of strong outworks, built perhaps to cover the ford of that river. In one of these fortifications Mr. Stoker discovered two large blocks of hewn lime-stone, which seemed to have been intended, but never used, for a gateway. Behind the fort, and defending the north or north-western side of the town, he found a long ridge of clay and rubble brick. With fragments of brick and stone the country all round Rudarpur is strewn, and from this great artificial quarry the inhabitants draw material for any building of the better order.\n\nAnother ancient monument of Rudarpur is the D\u00fadhn\u00e1th temple. To this is attached a convent of Bharati At\u00edths, presided over by a prior or mahant. The temple itself occupies a site which\n\n\u00b9 P. 429. \u00b2 Of the Archaeological Survey.\nbears traces of some far more ancient building. It is a small and rude brick structure surmounted by a pyramidal roof and surrounded by a flat-roofed cloister or gallery. \"The image of Shiva,\" writes Buchanan, \"to whom a temple of such celebrity is dedicated, of course came to its place without human aid, and in the most remote ages of the world; but according to the priests it was not discovered until after the authority of the pure Rajputs was established. A cow, as usual, pouring her milk (d\u00falk) on the ground, an opening was made and the god brought to light. It is on this account that the image is called D\u00fadhn\u00e1th.\" A little south of the temple have been several other figures, including one of Buddha. Additions were made to the temple by raja Bodhmal Bisen of Majhauli, who, as already mentioned, was converted to Islam about 1570. Whether this act of generosity took place before or after his conversion is uncertain; but the D\u00fadhn\u00e1th shrine is as popular amongst the less educated Muslims as amongst the Hind\u00fas themselves. Beside it, on the Shivar\u00e1ttri festival, is held a twelve-day fair of the usual half-religious and wholly profane character. And pilgrims sprinkle the phallic emblem of the god with Ganges-water brought from distant Hardw\u00e1r and Pray\u00e1g (Allahabad).\n\nFrom the time of raja Rudar Singh to that of the great rebellion Rudarpur was the head-quarters of the Sat\u00e1s\u00ed family. In the latter revolt the last raja joined. He was not a very energetic rebel, and for that reason perhaps escaped the penalty of death; but he has since died in transportation at the Andamans. His extensive palace, adjoining the S\u00e1hankot, is now in ruins. All his estates, except those which he had mortgaged to his daughter-in-law's Madrasi father, were forfeited. But on the confiscation the right of the daughter-in-law to the encumbered land was recognized. This lady, Bankat Narsaiya, alias Mangal Kunwari, lately (1879) died at Benares. She was generally called rani of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed; but as her father-in-law was attainted, and as her husband could not therefore succeed him as raja, she had no right to the title. From her husband, with whom she did not agree, she was separated. She made him a small allowance, which he eked out with alms from his father's old retainers. And she is understood to have left most of her property for religious purposes.\n\nRudrapur, a village of tappa Haveli and parganah Anola, stands on the meeting of two unmetalled roads, 10 miles south-west of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 but 490 inhabitants, and is remarkable only as the site of a third-class police-station and elementary (halkabandi) school.\n\n1 See article on Majhauli and Salempur.\nSAHIYA, in tappa Balia of Salempur, is one of the several once Buddhist villages found in the south and centre of that parganah. It stands about three miles east of Bh\u00e1galpur (q. v.), and had in 1872 a population of 415 persons.\n\nHere is a temple said to have been founded by Prat\u00e1p Mal Bisen, first r\u00e1ja of Bh\u00e1galpur, who seems to have flourished about 1700. A flat-roofed quadrangular building, it stands on a heap of bricks which are probably Buddhist remains. From these remains its idol was confessedly recovered; and its idol is a Buddhist statue. The image rests its left foot on the figure of a Buddha, and resembles one formerly visible in the subterraneous temple of the Allahabad fort. It is called, according to the taste of the worshipper, Th\u00e1kur Chatarbhuji-Nar\u00e1yani, or Chaturbhuja Vishnu.\n\nSahnjanua or Sahjanua is the site of a third-class police-station and district post-office in tappa Gahas\u00e1und of parganah Maghar. Situated on the metalled road from Gorakhpur to Basti, it is 10 miles west of the former, and the first stage on the route to Fyzabad of Oudh. The population amounted in 1872 to 344.\n\nIn the village are a good encamping-ground, a small bungalow belonging to the Public Works Department, a Government arboricultural nursery, and a temple sacred to Shiva.\n\nSalempur or Salempur-Majhauli, a parganah coinciding with the Deoria tahsil, is bounded on the east by the S\u00e1ran district; on the north-east by S\u00e1ran and parganah Sidhua-Jobna; on the north north-east by parganah Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur; on the north-west by parganah Silhai; on the south-west by the R\u00e1pti, which severs it from parganah Chilli\u00fap\u00e1r; on the south south-west by the Gh\u00e1gra, which divides it from the Azamgarh district; and on the south-east again by S\u00e1ran. Other rivers besides the Gh\u00e1gra and R\u00e1pti form in places the boundary. Thus the Little Gandak is for short distances the frontier-line with Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and S\u00e1ran; the Kh\u00e1na and Jh\u00e1rahi with S\u00e1ran only; and the Kurna for a long distance with Silhat. Parganah Salempur had in 1878 an area of 375,881 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 2,96,886. It is divided into 23 tappas\u2014Samogar, Nai-Gajhari, R\u00e1ipura, Bairauna, Surauli, Deoria, Gubr\u00e1in, Kachn\u00e1r, Satiy\u00e1on, Khakhundu, Pur\u00e1inn, M\u00e1il, Balia, Donr, Salempur, Bars\u00edp\u00e1r, Gh\u00e1ti, Bhitni, Haveli, Gautm\u00e1n, Sohanpur, Balw\u00e1n, and Kaparw\u00e1r. It contains 1,453 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza).\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it possessed 1,262 inhabited sites, of which 763 had less than 200 inhabitants; 359 between 200 and 500; 99 between 500 and 1,000; 35 between 1,000 and 68.\nand 2,000; two between 2,000 and 3,000; and two between 3,000 and 5,000. The only towns with more than 5,000 inhabitants were Gaura and Paina.\n\nThe population numbered 318,648 souls (147,944 females), giving 540 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 293,412 Hind\u00fas, of whom 136,367 were females; 25,227 Musalmans (11,572 females), and 9 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 43,254 Br\u00e1hmans (20,154 females); 21,937 R\u00e1jputs (9,984 females); and 8,948 Baniyas (4,218 females): whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 219,273 souls (102,011 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kananjiya (40,572). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Bais (3,482), Ponw\u00e1r, Chandel, Sakarw\u00e1l, Kausik, and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (5,161), Agarw\u00e1l, Baranw\u00e1r, and Unai sub-divisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Ah\u00edr (43,684), Cham\u00e1r (22,875), Kori (18,343), Koeri (17,593), Gond (11,266), Tali (9,164), Bhar (8,971), Loh\u00e1r (8,176), Kalw\u00e1r (7,754), Nuniya (7,453), Dos\u00e1dh (6,530), Mall\u00e1h (6,451), Hajj\u00e1m (4,761), Kam\u00e1ngar (4,263), Satw\u00e1r (3,763), Dhobi (3,810), Kah\u00e1r (3,976), Kurmi (5,458), K\u00e1yath (4,168), Bair\u00e1gi (2,252), Barhai (2,027), Son\u00e1r (1,779), Gadariya (1,875), Bind (1,532), and B\u00e1ri (1,054).\n\nThe tribes comprising less than one thousand members each are the Musahar, R\u00e1jbhar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Thathera, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e1gi, Atith, Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kadera, and Bharbh\u00fanja. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (19,897), Sayyids (110), Mughals (37), Path\u00e1ns (1,530), and unspecified.\n\nIn general fertility Salempur perhaps excels any other parganah of the district. Of its total area 257,593 acres were at assessment (1863) returned as cultivated; and tillage must since then have made still further inroads on the 40,508 acres which were uncultivated though cultivable. The parganah is studded with a host of fine mango-groves, but, except in a few villages of tappa Deoria, no traces of forest survive. Salempur bears, in fact, all the appearance of a long-settled country. Its husbandmen, especially the Kurn\u00eds of Deoria, are laborious and skilful agriculturists. But beyond the charm of verdant cultivation, almost uninterrupted save by shady groves, the landscape has few attractions. Though in the north a slight ridge or two may be sighted, the parganah as a whole is woefully flat. Its surface is drained by several rivers flowing southwards to swell the Gh\u00e1gra. Besides those already mentioned are some of a smaller order, such as the Kasli and Kuura. Of many lagoons, the chief are those named the\nTakia, Daurara, and Gurer. Such streams and lagoons between them provide ample means of irrigation. But as water lies near the surface wells also can be dug at a small expense.\n\nIts wealth of irrigation, indeed, almost secures the parganah from the visitations of famine. Floods, and not droughts, are the natural calamities which here are most to be dreaded. Inundations from the Ghagra sometimes sweep off the autumn rice (bhadui) and interrupt the sowings for the spring harvest. By herbivorous marauders cultivation is seldom troubled. The parganah is markedly devoid of game. The waterfowl and the snipe which haunt the margins of lagoons furnish the only sport obtainable. In spite of the abundant moisture the climate is fairly healthy. But in the rainy season fever prevails, and at all seasons the inhabitants of some villages suffer from goitre (ghagh). The soil is in most parts the light loam known as doras; but there are also a few patches of the sand (balua) and clay (mattiyar), whereof that loam is a mixture. The calcareous bh\u00e1t or chauri\u00e1r bh\u00e1t present themselves as usual in the neighbourhood of the R\u00e1pti, where sugarcane is widely grown.\n\nThis and poppy are the parganah's most valuable products. Like potatoes and other vegetables, the latter is most successfully grown by the Deoria Kurmis. The clay patches along the brinks of streams or lagoons are utilized for the growth of fine winter rice (Aghani). Tappa Khakhundu is famous for its splendid fields of arhar pulse. Cotton cultivation is little understood, and therefore little practised. The name of b\u00e1jra millet is unknown. But as elsewhere, the principal staples of the spring harvest are barley and wheat.\n\nThe manufactures of Salempur are insignificant; but those which are most important have been mentioned in the article on its principal mart, Barhaj. The most noticeable centres of trade, next to Barhaj, are L\u00e1rh, Majhauli, Salempur, and Bhing\u00e1ri of tappa Haveli. In the last class may be placed such mere market-villages as Bh\u00e1galpur, R\u00e1jpur, Kaparw\u00e1r, Paina, Khanap\u00e1r, Karaundi, Samogar, Balwan, and Khakhunda. At Bh\u00e1galpur, Baikanthpur, and Sohan\u00e9g are held great yearly fairs described in the article on each. The roads which connect all these places with one another and with surrounding parganahs are unmetalled fair-weather lines, four of the second and three of the third class. But the Ghagra, the R\u00e1pti, and the Little Gandak may be deemed the chief trade-routes. The two first are navigable for the whole, and the last for two-thirds of the year.\n\"The chief proprietors,\" writes Mr. Crooke, \"are Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs. The leading R\u00e1jput families are the great Bisen house of Majhauli, with offshoots at Baikunthpur, Dharamner, Bhing\u00e1ri, Khanap\u00e1r, Bairauna, Karaundi, and Kaparw\u00e1r. Among the Br\u00e1hmans the most important families are the Misrs of Piy\u00e1si, Dogari, and Rew\u00e1li, and the Tiw\u00e1ris of P\u00edni. The Chaubaria R\u00e1jputs are mentioned in the notes on Majbauli and Surauli.\n\n\"There are several remains of considerable antiquity, such as the Buddhistic pillars at Bh\u00e1galpur and Kah\u00e1on; the Jain or Br\u00e1hmanical temples at Khakhundu and Bharauli (tappa Deoria); the forts at Bh\u00e1galpur, Surauli, and Nai; the shrine at Sohan\u00e1g; ruins of various kinds at Sahiya, R\u00e1nigh\u00e1t, Bary\u00e1rpur (tappa Kachn\u00e1r), Bairauna, Khonda (tappa R\u00e1ipura) and Bamhni (tappa Deoria); besides innumerable d\u00edks or village mounds, all over the parganah attributed by popular rumour to Bhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas.\"\n\nIn these Bhars or Th\u00e1r\u00fas, who were perhaps Buddhists or Jainas, tradition discovers the earliest inhabitants of the parganah.\n\nThe first Aryan colony seems to have been founded about 1700 by Bissu Sen Bisen, first r\u00e1ja of Majhauli; but in the article on that place will be found all that need be said of him and his descendants. At the end of the sixteenth century the parganah formed part of Dehwap\u00e1ra Kuh\u00e1na, which included also Sidhua-Jobna and Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur. In the middle of the eighteenth, the power of its r\u00e1ja saved Salempur from the ravages of the Banj\u00e1ras. The year 1801 saw it ceded to the British and included in its present district. The land-tax demands since then assessed on the parganah have been Rs. 67,035 in 1803; Rs. 67,737 in 1806; Rs. 82,158 in 1809; Rs. 88,141 in 1813; Rs. 2,23,709 in 1840; and Rs. 2,90,740 in 1863.\n\nSEMRA or Simara, an agricultural village in tappa Lehra of parganah Haveli, stands not far east of the unmetalled road from Gorakhpur to Lautan, 36 miles north-by-west of the former. It contained in 1872 but 515 inhabitants, and is remarkable only as the site of a first-class police-station.\n\nSEMRA Hardeo is the site of a district post-office in tappa Barg\u00e1on-Chaura of parganah Sidhua-Jobna. Adjoining the Champ\u00e1ran frontier, it lies 48 miles in a direct line east-by-north of Gorakhpur. It in 1872 had 2,096 inhabitants.\n\nSH\u00c1HJAH\u00c1NPUR, a parganah of the H\u00e1ta tahsil, is bounded on south-east and north-east by parganah Sidhua-Jobna; on north north-east by parganah\n\n1 From whose notes and from the settlement report of B\u00e1bu Pi\u00e1rl Mohan this article has been chiefly compiled.\nHaveli; on west south-west by a short length of Haveli and a long length of parganah Silhat; on south south-west by parganah Salempur. The whole of the boundary with Silhat is furnished by the Dur\u00e1nchi; a small part of that with Salempur by the same river; small parts of those with Salempur and Haveli by the Little Gandak; a great part of that with Haveli by the Mohan; and a great part of that with Sidhua-Jobna by the Kh\u00e1nua. The parganah had in 1878 an area of 88,432 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 78,454. It is divided into nine tappas, named Bachauli, Bhatni, Chakdiya, Nagwa, Pari\u00e1par, Patn\u00e1n, Bhains\u00e1dabar, Majhwa, and T\u00e1rakulwa. And it contains 258 of the revenue divisions called villages (mauza).\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it had 246 inhabited sites, whereof 83 had less than 200 inhabitants; 118 between 200 and 500; 38 between 500 and 1,000; 6 between 1,000 and 2,000; and one between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\nThe population numbered 81,562 souls (38,272 females), giving 591 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 70,850 Hind\u00fas, (33,207 females); 10,711 Musalm\u00e1ns (5,065 females), and one Christian. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 5,224 Br\u00e1hmans (2,445 females); 2,961 R\u00e1jputs (1,392 females); and 2,330 Baniyas (1,031 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 60,335 souls (28,339 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (5,138). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Ponw\u00e1r (666), Chandel, Sakarw\u00e1l, Bais, Kausik, and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (1,882), Agarw\u00e1l, Baranwa, and Kasaundhan sub-divisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Dos\u00e1dh (2,020), Gound\u00b9 (2,024), Teli (2,645), Ah\u00edr (9,207), Loh\u00e1r (1,738), Hajj\u00e1m (1,179), Cham\u00e1r (7,529), Dhobi (1,282), Kah\u00e1r (1,548), Kurmi (9,885), Bhar (2,515), Mall\u00e1h (1,003), Nuniya (1,757), Kalw\u00e1r (2,118), and Kam\u00e1ngar (1,018). The following clans comprise less than one thousand members each:\u2014Bind, Son\u00e1r, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Bar\u00e1yi, P\u00e1s\u00ed, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e9gi, B\u00e1ri, \u00c1t\u00edth, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Khadera, Beld\u00e1r, Kum\u00e1r, Bah\u00e9liya, and Jaisw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (8,598), Sayyids (10), Mughals (44), Path\u00e1ns (1,369), and unspecified.\n\nSh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur is a flat and well-cultivated tract which, adjoining as it does Salempur, can hardly be called very fertile. Buchanan (1835) mentions it as consisting chiefly of waste land covered by long dismal grass and stunted trees; but tillage has since then advanced across it with rapid strides. Of the total area 61,220 acres were at\n\n\u00b9 See article on parganah Bhandp\u00e1r, footnote concerning this caste.\nassessment (1862) returned as cultivated and 15,113 as culturable. In tappa Pari\u00e1p\u00e1r the general monotony of level is relieved by a few sandhills from 10 to 30 feet high, which form the continuation of a ridge which divides part of Silhat from part of this parganah. But the only difference of elevation elsewhere is the slight difference between the watersheds (b\u00e1ngar) and the basins (kachh\u00e1r) of the Dur\u00e1nchi, the Mohan, and the Little Gandak. All these rivers in the rainy season overflow their banks; and in winter, when the floods have subsided, their basins are cultivated. The Little Gandak winds from north to south through the whole length of the parganah. The abrupt ascent from its low banks to the uplands is gnawed into many ravines by the drainage descending to the river. The soils of the watersheds are loam (doras) and clay (mattiyar and kurail). The calcareous bh\u00e1t soil is found along the edges of streams; and the sandy balua is found in spots where, as in the part of Pari\u00e1p\u00e1r just mentioned, the west-wind has driven it across from Silhat. The crops produced by these soils are just the same as described in the article on parganah Salempur.\n\nThose crops are the parganah's only important product. As before noticed, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur has only one village with over 2,000 inhabitants, and it cannot therefore be expected to possess any manufactures worthy of mention. At Hetimpur, indeed, are a small dying business and a few sugar factories. But trade is on the whole minute, and communications are therefore scarce. Through the parganah, near the northern border, runs the unmetalled Gorakhpur and Kasia road. On this the villages of H\u00e1ta and Hetimpur are situate; and from this two other unmetalled lines pass south south-westwards into Silhat and Salempur. On one of them stands T\u00e1rakulwa.\n\nIn the beginning of the fifteenth century Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur and part of the neighbouring Sidhua-Johna were seized, probably from the aboriginal Bhars, by the R\u00e1jput Medhan Singh. Also called Madan Sen, he was perhaps the same r\u00e1ja of S\u00e1ran and Champ\u00e1ran as gave the Muhammadan governors of those tracts so much trouble. It is not unlikely that his descendants acknowledged themselves tributary to the Afghan princes of Bengal; for when towards the close of the sixteenth century Akbar crushed those princes, the r\u00e1ja of Majhaul\u00ed was allowed to annex this parganah. Medhan Singh's family were extirpated, and their lands parcelled out amongst the victorious Bisens. Towards the close of the same reign (1596) Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur formed part of the great Dehwap\u00e1ra-Kuh\u00e1na parganah, in the Gorakhpur division of the Oudh province.\u00b9\n\n\u00b9 But see also p. 274.\nIts present name is derived from a still existing village within its limits; and that village, again, was perhaps called after the emperor Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n (1628-58). The parganah was ceded by Oudh to the British in 1801, and since then has been assessed with the following land-revenues:\u2014Rs. 15,734 in 1802; Rs. 10,645 in 1806; Rs. 11,212 in 1809; Rs. 12,406 in 1813; Rs. 39,445 in 1840; and Rs. 77,070 in 1862.\n\n**Sidhwa-Jobna**, a parganah coinciding with the Kasia sub-division and Padrauna tahsil, marches on north-east-by-east with the Champ\u00e1ran district, the Great Gandak river and one of its former beds affording in places a boundary. On west north-west the frontier is supplied by parganas Tilpur and Haveli, on west south-west by parganas Haveli, Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur, and Salempur; and on south-by-east by the S\u00e1ran district. The border with Tilpur is formed by the Little Gandak, and with part of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1npur by the Kh\u00e1nna branch of that river. Parganah Sidhwa-Jobna had in 1878 an area of 593,990 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 3,37,202. It is divided into 22 tappas, viz., Batsara or Batesara, Nagwan or Nangaw\u00e1n, P\u00e9pur, D\u00e1nd\u00fapur, B\u00e1nsi-Chiri\u00e1gora, Barg\u00e1on-Chaura, Pakri-Gangr\u00e1ni, S\u00e1ndi, Parw\u00e1rpar, Mainpur-Sabakhor, Bhalna, R\u00e1mpur-Ragha, R\u00e1n\u00edpur-Dh\u00e1b, Pirth\u00edpur, Dhuria-Bijaipur, Sipahi-Kuchia, Jhankaun-G\u00e1ngi-t\u00edkar, Kh\u00e1n, Malsil-Sareini, Badur\u00e1on-Bhasni, Haveli, and B\u00e1nk-Jogni. The parganah contains 1,295 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza).\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it possessed 1,251 inhabited sites, of which 544 had less than 200 inhabitants; 487 between 200 and 500; 159 between 500 and 1,000; 52 between 1,000 and 2,000; 6 between 2,000 and 3,000; and 1 between 3,000 and 5,000. The only towns containing more than 5,000 inhabitants were Padrauna and \u00c1mwa.\n\nThe population in 1872 numbered 417,641 souls (194,086 females), giving 799 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 356,377 Hind\u00fas (165,646 females) and 61,264 Musalm\u00e1ns (28,440 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes the census shows 28,480 Br\u00e1hmans (13,228 females); 13,616 R\u00e1jputs (6,195 females), and 11,643 Baniyas (5,429 females): whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes\" of the census returns, which show a total of 302,638 souls (140,794 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (28,089). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Bais (1,727), Chandel, Ponw\u00e1r, Kausik, Solankhi, and Chauh\u00e1n.

The most numerous among the other castes are the Ahir (41,088), Kori (40,236), Cham\u00e1r (37,477), Gound\u00b9 (13,401), Teli (13,107), Lohar (7,481), Hajj\u00e1m (5,354), Dhobi (5,752), Bind (2,915), and Kab\u00e1r (2,090). Besides these, the following tribes comprising less than one thousand members each are found in the parganah:\u2014Satw\u00e1r, Gadariya, Kurmi, Bhar, Mall\u00e1h, Noniya, K\u00e1yath, Musahar, Kalw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbhar, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Bar\u00e1yi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Thathera, M\u00fali, B\u00e1nsphor, Bair\u00e1gi, Jogi, B\u00e1ri, Atith, Khat\u00edk, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Khadera, Bharbh\u00fanja, Beld\u00e1r, Kum\u00e1r, Baheliya, and Jaisw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (33,897), Sayyids (163), Mughals (64), Path\u00e1ns (2,551), and unspecified.\n\nAn extensive tract straggling from the wild and marshy Tar\u00e1\u00ed to the verge of the fertile S\u00e1ran, Sidh\u00faa-Jobna presents a great variety of physical and agricultural features. The distinctions of surface are, however, chiefly due to the presence or absence of forest, and to the nearness or distance of the Great Gandak river. Northwards, in tappa Batsara, there is still some woodland left; and another fringe of trees extends along the bank of the Little Gandak into tappa Nagwan. Like most streams rising in the lower Him\u00e1laya, the Great Gandak is at first most fickle in its choice of a plains bed. Swollen by freshets, it almost yearly cuts some new course through the light argillaceous soil. It still more often overflows, and the deposits left by its floods are far from fertilizing. \u201cThe knowledge,\u201d writes Mr. Lumsden, \u201cthat what is now a rich sheet of paddy (rice) cultivation may next year become the bed of a new channel must needs affect the state of cultivation and the pursuits of the inhabitants. A disinclination to expend capital in carrying out improvements and extending cultivation, an inferior kind of agriculture, and the preponderance of shepherds and herdsmen amongst the inhabitants; these and many other like peculiarities are all to be traced, directly or indirectly, to the Great Gandak and its numerous branches.\u201d Below tappa R\u00e1mpur Dh\u00e1b, however, the river becomes less capricious and adopts one regular and well-defined channel. Unlike its major namesake, the Little Gandak is a steady river, seldom guilty of inundations. The only other streams which need be mentioned are the Jhar\u00e1hi and B\u00e1uri, both rising in the parganah itself; and the Kh\u00e1nua, which crosses its south-western corner.\n\nBut if the parganah differs from place to place, it has also some features which are common to its whole area. Such are the numerous shallow lagoons, connected by watercourses, and the smaller ponds, natural and artificial. Such\n\n\u00b9 See speculation on the identity of this caste in one of the footnotes to the article on parganah Bhaudp\u00e1r.\nare the large mango-groves and bambu clumps everywhere sighted, and such are the village homesteads whose neat and often tiled mud huts crown every convenient eminence.\n\nIt must not from the last expression be inferred that Sidhua-Jobna shows any sudden or striking inequalities of level. In its centre and south the country is described as undulating slightly; and between the watersheds and basins of rivers some trifling difference of elevation is of course visible. But like most of the district the parganah may be defined as a plain sloping gently south south-eastwards. On the watersheds the soils are chiefly loam (doras) and sand (balwa or dhust); in the river basins chiefly the chalky-looking clay called bh\u00e1t. The latter, which occupies nearly two-thirds of the whole cultivated area, does not require irrigation. And here it may be mentioned that of that cultivated area 35 per cent. was at assessment (1865) returned as watered, chiefly from lagoons, ponds, and streams.\n\nThe cultivated area was itself returned as 347,968 acres. But to this figure must be added a good deal of the unsurveyed waste-land grants (63,518 acres); and tillage must since then have spread over much of the 128,041 acres returned as cultivable. All the ordinary crops of the spring and autumn harvests are produced in fair quantity and quality. Sugarcane has within the past 40 years become the staple growth of the parganah. There are at least half a hundred native sugar factories, whose produce has under the name of bagaha gained an established place in the Calcutta market. Besides the usual kinds of rice is grown one called chenaue or sengar, which is almost peculiar to Sidhua-Jobna.\u00b9 Neither indigo nor poppy is extensively cultivated. On the watersheds the chief autumn growths are rices, pulses, and maize; on the bh\u00e1t lands, rices, turmeric, capsicums, ginger, and cotton. The chief spring crops of the watersheds are wheat, barley, and the pulses gram and arhar; of the bh\u00e1t lands, wheat, barley, and oil-plants.\n\nSeveral other products besides the crops require some brief notice.\n\nOther products. Small particles of gold are found mixed with the sands of the Great Gandak; and those sands are sometimes washed to find the precious metal. But the particles are far fewer than higher upstream, in the Nep\u00e1l Tar\u00e1i; and Mr. Lumsden reckons that to recover Rs. 10 worth of gold must cost the sand-washers of Sidhua-Jobna almost double that amount in time and labour. In the south and south-east of the parganah flourishes a fair trade in saltpetre. In 1865 there were as many as 168 factories and four refineries of this mineral. The luxuriant pasturage along\n\n\u00b9 Supra p. 324.\nthe banks of the Gandak, and the remains of forest in the north, encourage a considerable business in hides, which are exported half-cured to D\u00e1napur or Calcutta. Hemp matting and sacking is extensively manufactured in the south-east; and in the west is woven a strong but dirty-looking cloth called kokti.\n\nFor the local produce 42 market towns and villages provide a sale.\n\nMarts.\n\nThe most important emporia are Tiw\u00e1ripatti and S\u00e1hibganj, both on a branch of the Great Gandak; another S\u00e1hibganj, on the waste-land grant of the late Mr. Sym\u00b9; and Ragarganj on the Little Gandak. Other places which are noteworthy for less commercial reasons are Padrauna, Kasia, Tamk\u00fahi, Kutahi, Kohrauliya, Dh\u00e1nipatti, Bishanpura, Rampur-Borah\u00e1n, B\u00e1nsg\u00e1on, Amwa, Taria-Suj\u00e1n, Ramkola, and Semra-Hardeo. About eight highways, all unmetalled, connect these places with each other and surrounding parganahs.\n\nThe principal road-centres, that is the places where the largest number of the best roads meet, are Padrauna and Kasia. The lines which meet or cross at other places are not regularly bridged, and this defect, with the floods which often cover the country, causes the suspension of all wheeled traffic during the rains. But trade-routes are provided also by the Great Gandak, its navigable branches, and its minor namesake. In the monsoon small boats ply the Little Gandak as far north as Ragarganj. It was many years ago proposed by means of locks to convert this river into a navigation canal. The levels were so far as ascertained favorable, and the canal would have proved a great boon to the parganah. But the project has been almost forgotten.\n\nAs shown by the remains at Padrauna and Kasia, Sidhua-Jobna is a tract of ancient civilization. Of its Buddhist history, however, nothing is known; and we pass to the Hindu epoch. With as little truth probably as in most Hindu etymologies, the name of Sidhua is derived from the legend that it was a wilderness where holy men or siddhas came to perform austerities. But about the beginning of the fifteenth century the south of the parganah was annexed and colonized by Medhan Singh, of whom something was said in the last article. When his descendants succumbed to the Bisens, about 1580, the victors divided their conquest into several petty talukas or baronies. Such were Bansg\u00e1on, Ramkola, Parw\u00e1rpar, Sikhoni, and S\u00e1nkhop\u00e1r. At the end of the same sixteenth century the parganah formed part of the great parganah of Dehw\u00e1p\u00e1ra-\n\n\u00b9See article on Padrauna, of which this S\u00e1hibganj is a suburb.\nKuh\u00e1na, which included also Shahjah\u00e1npur and Salempur. A sub-division of the Gorakhpur Government and Oudh province, Dehwap\u00e1ra had a State rental of Rs. 17,941. The smallness of this sum as compared with that paid by a smaller parganah like Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r shows how much of the tract must at this time have been under forest.\n\nThe Bisens gradually spread northwards, and about 1750 we find their chief, the r\u00e1ja of Majhauli, granting Padrauna and other villages to a Kurmi retainer. How these villages become the nucleus of a great domain has been told above. From their original grantee is descended the r\u00e1i of Padrauna. About 1765, on the cession of Bih\u00e1r to the British, a Bh\u00fa\u00ednh\u00e1r chief, who was unwilling to acknowledge the new power, migrated from S\u00e1ran into this parganah. Before his death he had accumulated the large tract of villages known as the Bank-Jogni taluka; and from him the r\u00e1ja of Tamk\u00fahi is descended. The Padrauna and Tamk\u00fahi families may be considered the leading families of the parganah.\n\nThat parganah was ceded by Oudh to the Company in 1801; but until the settlement of the current revenue, in 1865, the Bank-Jogni and Padrauna talukas were always assessed separately. If we include them in the general reckoning, the following have been the demands imposed since cession on Sidhua-Jobna:\u2014At the first settlement (1802), Rs. 96,949; at the second (1806), Rs. 87,195; at the third (1809), Rs. 80,361; at the fourth (1813), Rs. 83,668; at the fifth (1840), Rs. 2,24,477; and at the current, Rs. 3,18,934.\n\nSilhat, a parganah of the H\u00e1ta tahs\u00edl, is bounded on east-by-north by the Dur\u00e1nchi river, which severs it from parganah Silhat; on north-by-west and on west north-west by parganah Haveli, the river Majhna supplying in places a boundary; on west and south south-west by the R\u00e1pti, which divides it from parganahs Bhau\u00e1p\u00e1r and Chill\u00fap\u00e1r; and on south-east by parganah Salempur, a long part of the frontier being provided by the K\u00farna river. Silhat had in 1878 an area of 179,170 acres and a land revenue of Rs. 1,15,987. It is divided into 17 tappas, viz., Banchara, Singhpur, Nar\u00e1yanpur-Chiurha, Kataura, Bakhira, Bin\u00e1yak, Chiri\u00e1on, Pah\u00e1rpur, Idr\u00e1kpur, Donth, Barnai, Gaura, Dhat\u00far\u00e1, Sirijam, Ind\u00fapur, Nagw\u00e1n-Tikar, and Madanpur. The parganah contains 477 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza).\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it possessed 441 inhabited sites, whereof 219 had less than 200 inhabitants; 155 between 200 and 500; 50 between 500 and 1,000; 14 between 1,000\n\n1 7,17,640 dimes. But see also p. 274 2 Pp. 399, 450-61. 3 Pp. 401, 450.\nand 2,000; 1 between 2,000 and 3,000; and 1 between 3,000 and 5,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants was Rudarpur.\n\nThe population numbered 135,847 souls (62,742 females), giving 485 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 126,500 Hind\u00fas (58,535 females) and 9,347 Musalm\u00e1ns (4,207 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 11,629 Br\u00e1hmans (5,543 females); 6,452 R\u00e1jputs (3,071 females); and 3,252 Baniyas (1,503 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 105,167 souls (48,418 females).\n\nThe principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this pargana is the Kanaujiya (11,335). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Ponw\u00e1r (1,441), Sarnet, Sakarw\u00e1l, Bais, Solankhi, and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (1,523), Agarw\u00e1l, Baranw\u00e1r, and Kasaundhan sub-divisions. The most numerous among the other castes are the Bind (1,341), Dos\u00e1dh (1,342), Gound (1,911), Teli (3,918), Koeri (3,249), Ah\u00edr (17,950), Loh\u00e1r (2,783), Hajj\u00e1m (1,756), Cham\u00e1r (1,368), Dhobi (1,637), Kah\u00e1r (2,736), Satw\u00e1r (7,832), Kurmi (1,891), Bhar (4,956), Mall\u00e1h (14,909), and Nuniya (5,426). Besides these, the following tribes comprising less than one thousand members each are found in the parganah:\u2014Kalw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbhar, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Kah\u00e1r, Dom, Barhai, Bar\u00e1yi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1si, Thathera, Mali, B\u00e1nsphor, B\u00e1ri, At\u00edth, Khat\u00fak, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Bharbhunja, Kori, Baheliya, and Jaisw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (7,676), Sayyids (53), Mughals (76), Path\u00e1ns (948), and unspecified.\n\nExcept where broken by an occasional sand ridge, the surface of Silhat Physical and agri-cultural features. is level. The general features of the landscape are almost the same as in the neighbouring Salempur. But in this parganah there is much more forest. Though a large fringe of woodland, which a quarter of a century ago shaded the west and south, has given way to cultivation, a wilderness of stunted trees still stretches along the banks of the Majhna to join the Kusmahi jungle in parganah Haveli. After forming, as already noted, the frontier with that parganah, the Majhna crosses this from north to south; and it is joined within Silhat by the Kurna. Along its banks and those of the R\u00e1pti the soil is the swampy and chalky-looking clay known as chaur bh\u00e1t. In the north occur the ridges of sand (dh\u00fasi) lately mentioned. But the bulk of the mould is loam (doras). Of the cultivated area 98,258 acres were at assessment (1,863) returned as cultivated and 23,984 acres as cultivable. Though the gram and urd pulses are more extensively grown here than in Salempur, the crops are mainly those described in the article on that parganah (q. v.)\n\n1 See article on pargana Bha\u00fa\u00e1p\u00e1r, population section, note. 2 Supra p. 291.\nBeyond the business in agricultural raw produce, Silhat has little trade; but what little exists has been noticed under the head of its chief town, Rudarpur. The parganah has many less important market villages, such as Madanpur, Sirijam, R\u00e1mpur, Sohiauna, Gauri, Mathia, Patharhat, Dharha, Parri, and Bakhira. Two unmetalled roads of the second and three of the third class tap the principal places, and additional routes are provided by the R\u00e1pti and Majhna, both navigable when the roads are waterlogged.\n\nRemains at Rudarpur render it probable that the parganah was once a stronghold of Buddhists. In those days the terms Buddhist and Bhar are likely to have been identical;\u00b9 and we may suppose that, as elsewhere in the district, the earliest inhabitants were Bhars. If so their peace was roughly disturbed about the middle of the fourteenth century, when the parganah became a bone of contention between the lately founded Sarnet dynasty of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed and the older Bisen house of Majhaul\u00ed. The war continued with brief intervals of peace for about a hundred years, and ended in the victory of the Bisens, who annexed the disputed tract.\n\nIn the end of the sixteenth century Silhat was a part of parganah Haveli Gorakhpur. From this it was severed about 1680, when Rudar, r\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, was ejected from Gorakhpur and made Rudarpur his capital. Through the remainder of the Dehli rule, through the whole of the Oudh supremacy, and from the beginning of the British occupation until the great rebellion, the Sat\u00e1s\u00ed r\u00e1jas continued to flourish in Silhat.\n\nThe progress of the parganah since its cession to the British (1801) may be proved by the steadily increasing demands imposed at successive settlements of land-revenue. These were:\u2014At the first settlement (1803), Rs. 8,516; at the second (1806), Rs. 9,283; at the third (1809), Rs. 12,657; at the fourth (1813), Rs. 16,461; at the fifth (1840), Rs. 54,300; and at the sixth (1863), Rs. 1,02,621. The sixth settlement is still current, but its demand has, as above shown, risen.\n\nSiswa-b\u00e1z\u00e1r, a village in tappa Old Karhi of parganah Tilpur, lies 43 miles north-east of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 but 1,732 inhabitants; and its only claims to notice are a parganah school and a house-tax. For the Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force within its limits. During 1877-78 the house-tax thereby imposed, with a trifling balance from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 184. The expenditure, which was solely on police, amounted to Rs. 144. Of the 385 houses in the village 142 were assessed\n\n\u00b9Pp. 431-32.\nwith the tax, the incidence being Re. 1-3-0 per house assessed, and Re. 0-1-7 per head of population.\n\nSohanag,\u00b9 a hamlet in tappa Mail and parganah Salempur, stands about 8 miles south-west of Salempur and about 50 south-east of Gorakhpur. It in 1872 had but 29 inhabitants.\n\nThe hamlet is remarkable as containing an ancient tank and a large mass of ruins and sculptures apparently dating from the later Buddhistic epoch. The tank itself lies, like all ancient excavations of the kind, in a due north and south direction. It is 146 latteas\u00b2 long and 77 broad, containing an area of 27\u00bd bighas.\u00b3 West of it and extending along its entire length rises a mound varying in height and breadth. The extreme elevation is about 50 feet and the breadth in the widest part about 100. This mound is formed chiefly of the large broad bricks characteristic of ancient buildings. It seems never to have been excavated, and it is impossible to say accurately what buildings it contained. But the highest part was probably a stupa erected over some Buddhistic relics; and the lower portion (which shows traces of a quadrangular building) a Buddhist monastery and apartments for ascetics.\n\nThe ancient name of Sohanag is said to have been Nagpur; and it is believed to be midway between Ajudhia and Janakpur in the Muzaffarpur district, the capital of Janaka, king of Mithila and father of Sita. At Mithila or Janakpur was held the assembly of kings at which raja Janaka promised his daughter Sita to the prince who could bend the bow of Shiva. Now with this bow, which was then in charge of Janaka, Shiva had conquered the gods in the sacrifice of Daksha. Rama succeeded in the task; and the Parasu Rama succumbed to the superior power of the Rama Chandra incarnation of Vishnu. He returned to Sohanag, and there did penance to recover his divinity. After this the shrine became ruined and the images were lost. Many years afterwards, a king of Nep\u00e1l named Sohan, who was grievously smitten with leprosy, set forth to die at Kashi (Benares). On his way he halted at Sohanag, and using the water of the tank was miraculously cured. In gratitude he restored the shrines. Some accounts say that Sohan was a Bisen Rajput; but others deny this. At any rate some claim seems to have been made by the Bisens of Majhauli to connect themselves in some way with the worship at Sohanag. The natural inference from the story is that on the revival of Brahmins the ancient Buddhistic rites were revived. An exactly analogous case is the restoration and re-identification of the Ajudhia holy places by king Vikramaditya of Ujjain.\n\n\u00b9 The whole of this article is by Mr. Crooke.\n\u00b2 The latte or lattha equals 8 feet 7\u00bd inches.\n\u00b3 I.e., about 18\u00bd acres, according to the proportion between bigha and acre prevalent in this parganah.\nThe chief remains visible at Sohan\u00e1g are now as follows. There is a small ruined brick enclosure containing a modern Hindu temple of the common type. In this shrine are four images, all doubtless Buddhistic. They are known as Chatarbhuj Nar\u00e1yan (the four-armed Vishnu), Paras\u00faramji, Kuber Bhand\u00e1ri (Kuber the storekeeper), and Ranchhor Tikam. The images of Paras\u00far\u00e1m and Kuber are engraved in Buchanan's Eastern India (II., 363).\n\nBut Buchanan never saw the place himself, and depended on the very imperfect description of his pandit. In the same enclosure are some ruined ascetic's cells and the remains of a small Mah\u00e1deo temple with a round black stone phallus, known as Maha Rudra N\u00e1th. The temple containing the chief images is said to have been built by Niw\u00e1z Singh, chakl\u00e1dd\u00e1r or commissioner under the rule of Oudh. It may perhaps be nearly a hundred years old, and probably dates from a period not long before our occupation of the district.\n\nOn the highest point of the mound is a semi-ruinous temple, containing a small black stone image representing a man with a woman in his lap. This is known as Gauri-shankar or Mah\u00e1deo and P\u00e1rvati. At the base of the mound, near the edge of the tank, is a small ruined temple containing a phallus and two black stone images in excellent preservation. They are said to represent Paras\u00far\u00e1ma's parents,\u2014Jamadagni, son of Rich\u00edka of the race of Bhrigu; and Renuka, daughter of r\u00e1ja Prasenaj\u00edt.\n\nBut both these statues are certainly Buddhistic, and have been appropriated by the Br\u00e1hmanical cultus. The phallus in this shrine is called the Jh\u00e1rkandi Mah\u00e1deo. On the edge of the tank are some remains of an ancient landing staircase; and under an adjoining p\u00edpal tree is a small Buddhistic figure known as Laukus,\u00b9 that son of R\u00e1mchandra who was miraculously formed out of a handful of holy kusa grass. In addition to the occasional visits of devotees to the shrine of Paras\u00far\u00e1m there is an annual fair held on the 3rd, bright half, Bais\u00e1kh (April-May). At this gathering attend on an average 20,000 people. The real priests (puj\u00e1ri) of the shrine are the At\u00edths of Karwaniya in tappa Ballia of parganah Salempur, whose present representative is prior (mahant) G\u00e1y\u00e1puri-Ji. The place is, however, practically in charge of a family of Bh\u00e1ts, who own two-thirds of the village of Sohan\u00e1g. Deokinandan L\u00e1l, a lawyer of Gorakhpur, whose family live in the adjoining village of Pilauli, has succeeded in procuring a decree in the civil court for the tank and the ground on which the fair is held.\n\nAdjoining this ancient site is a modern shrine occupied by a body of R\u00e1m\u00e1nandis. They have a Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra with images of Lachhman and\n\n\u00b9 The name seems, however, to have been compounded from those of both R\u00e1ma's sons, Lava and Kusha.\nJ\u00e1nki and several ammonite fossils (S\u00e1ligr\u00e1m). The founder of this convent was Dharni-d\u00e1s, who was succeeded by the noted ascetic J\u00edwa R\u00e1mji. The latter disappeared on a pilgrimage, leaving behind him a stone cup (kundi) which he announced would fall to pieces on the day of his death. The cup broke twelve years after his departure; but no one knows where he died. It is said that he could appear simultaneously at Sohan\u00e1g and Mathur\u00e1. The succession of priors since his time has been T\u00edk\u00e1r\u00e1m, Ganesh-d\u00e1s, Nar\u00e1yan-d\u00e1s, J\u00e1nki-d\u00e1s, P\u00e1rasur\u00e1m-d\u00e1s, Rameshwar-d\u00e1s, R\u00e9mparsh\u00e1d-d\u00e1s, and R\u00e1masaran-d\u00e1s, who at present occupies the cushion. The tomb (sam\u00e1dhi) of J\u00edwa R\u00e1m-d\u00e1s,\u00b9 with his broken cup, is greatly venerated.\n\nOn the whole Sohan\u00e1g is a very interesting place and offers a good field for arch\u00e6ological exploration. It seems to be one of a line of Buddhist shrines extending from Bh\u00e1galpur gh\u00e1t on the Gh\u00e1gra to Kasia or Kusana-gara, the scene of Buddha\u2019s death. The intermediate stages were perhaps Kah\u00e1on, Sohan\u00e1g, and Khakhundu, in all of which Buddhist remains exist.\n\nSurauli, a large village in the tappa so named of parganah Salempur, lies about five miles south south-west of Deoria. Its population amounted in 1872 to 424 persons.\n\nHere are the remains of an extensive fort, covering an area of about 22 acres. The site is overgrown with scrub, but clearly defined by the still visible traces of a surrounding ditch. Within are three large masonry wells, and the remains of a fourth with steps descending into its shaft. The village is held by Chaubaria R\u00e1jputs, who are said to take their name from parganah Chaubar in S\u00faran. Legend asserts that they were settled here by a r\u00e1ja of Majhauli, who wished them to watch his frontier; and that the fort was built about 10 generations ago by one Dambar S\u00e1hi. It was destroyed shortly before the British occupation (1801) by one of the Oudh naw\u00e1b\u2019s deputies. There is a superstition that any one attempting to plough within the fort immediately dies.\n\nTamk\u00fahi or Tamakhoi, a village of tappa Haveli and parganah Sidhua-Jobna, stands on the unmetalled road from Sam\u00far to T\u00fad\u00e1ri patti, 55 miles east-by-south of Gorakhpur. It had in 1872 but 708 inhabitants; and is here noticed solely as the site of an imperial post-office and the seat of the Tamk\u00fahi r\u00e1ja.\u00b2\n\nTarakulwa, a village of the tappa so named in parganah Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n-pur, stands on the unmetalled Kasia and Barhaj road, 40 miles south south-east of Gorakhpur. Its population amounted in 1872 to 1,020 persons.\n\n\u00b9 As no one knows where he died, this tomb is probably a cenotaph. \u00b2 Supra, p. 401.\nTarakulwa is situated on a great mound of sand, and its climate is considered good. It has a district post-office and a first-class police-station, with cattle-pound attached.\n\nTaria Sujan is the site of a third-class police-station and district post-office in tappa Haveli of parganah Sidhua-Jobna. It lies at a considerable distance from any road, 56 miles east-by-south of Gorakhpur; and in 1872 had 2,101 inhabitants.\n\nTilpur, a parganah of the Mah\u00far\u00e1jganj tahsil, is bounded on north north-east by the Champ\u00e1ran district and Nep\u00e1l, the border with the former being provided by the Great Gandak river; on north-west by the Jharrei river, which severs it from parganahs Bin\u00e1yakpur and Haveli; on its concave south-western frontier by the latter parganah; on east south-east by parganah Sidhua-Jobna, and again for a short distance by the Great Gandak and Champ\u00e1ran. Tilpur had in 1878 an area of 183,764 acres and a land-revenue of Rs. 48,575. It is divided into seven tappas, called Old Karhi, New Karhi, Bharatkand, Domakand kh\u00e1s, Sukarhari, and Son\u00e1ri. It contains 339 of the revenue divisions known as villages (mauza).\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 it possessed 251 inhabited sites, whereof 155 had less than 200 inhabitants; 79 between 200 and 500; 13 between 500 and 1,000; and 4 between 1,000 and 2,000.\n\nThe population numbered 57,021 souls (26,859 females), giving 199 to the square mile. Classified according to the religion, there were 50,164 Hindus (23,590 females); 6,853 Musalm\u00e1ns (3,267 females), and 4 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 3,370 Br\u00e1hmans (1,617 females); 772 R\u00e1jputs (373 females); and 1,841 Baniyas, (821 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 44,179 souls (20,779 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Kanaujiya (3,145). The chief R\u00e1jput clans are the Sarnet (152) and Chauh\u00e1n. The Baniyas belong to the K\u00e1ndu (1,224), Agarahri, Barauna, Unai, and Kasaundhan sub-divisions. The most numerous amongst the other castes are the Teli (1,832), Koeri (1,535), Ah\u00edr (6,225), Cham\u00e1r (6,077), Dhobi (1,050), Kah\u00e1r (1496), Kurmi (1,714), Mall\u00e1h (1,450), Nuniya (3,047), and Musahar (2,444). Besides these, the following tribes comprising less than one thousand members each are found in the parganah:\u2014Bind, Dos\u00e1dh, Gound, Loh\u00e1r, Hajj\u00e1m, Satw\u00e1r,\n\n1 See article on parganah Dhuri\u00e1dp\u00e1r, population section, note. 2 Article on parganah Bhand\u00e1lp\u00e1r, population section, note.\nGadariya, K\u00e1yath, Kalw\u00e1r, Rajbhar, Son\u00e1r, Kam\u00e1ngar, Dom, Barh\u00e1i, Bar\u00e1yi, Bh\u00e1t, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Thathera, M\u00e1li, B\u00e1nsphor, Jogi, Bair\u00e1gi, B\u00e1ri, Khatik, Kh\u00e1krob, Kis\u00e1n, Halw\u00e1i, Kum\u00e1r, Kori, Baheliya, Gosa\u00edn, and Jaisw\u00e1r. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (6,436), Sayyids (27), Mughals (18), Path\u00e1ns (311), and unspecified.\n\nThe parganah may be divided into two portions. Its larger or northern division may be deemed a part of the Tar\u00e1i, while its southern is an open and fairly cultivated plain resembling the bulk of the district. In the former tract must be placed tappas Son\u00e1ri, Sukarh\u00e1ri, Domakand, Bharatkand, and the northern half of tappa Kh\u00e1s. These are regions of reserved forest, large grass prairies, patchy and slovenly cultivation, poor hamlets, and morass. In the southern tract are included the other half of Kh\u00e1s and tappas New and Old Karhi. Here, as already mentioned, are found freedom from forest and a fairly extensive cultivation.\n\nOf the total area 59,175 acres were at the land-assessment of 1865 returned as cultivated. But this estimate excludes the cultivation of waste-land grants; and since it was framed tillage must have made still further annexations amongst the 46,386 acres which were returned as cultivable, though fallow. The soil consists chiefly of the sandy loam called doras; but there is a good deal of clay (mattiy\u00e1r) and a small amount of the almost pure sand named balua. So great is the natural moisture of the earth that the ordinary crops can be produced in abundance without artificial irrigation. Water, indeed, lies at an average depth of but 8 feet from the surface; and of the total cultivation not quite 20 per cent. is recorded as watered. Wells are used, not for fields, but for the purposes of human life. The usual sources of what little irrigation exists are not wells, but streams and lagoons.\n\nChief of the former are the Little Gandak watering the eastern, and the Malawa the western tappas. But there are many minor water-courses, such as Chandan, the Khekara, the Hirna, the Soleh, and the Ghorburwa. Most if not all of these rise in the parganah itself. The lagoons are of the usual type\u2014reed swamps which with the approach of summer gradually dry. But the form of some shows that they were once bends in the beds of rivers. Like its neighbour parganahs Tilpur is subject to extensive inundations. But owing to the sandy nature of the soil these rapidly disappear.\n\nAs usual in watery tracts, autumn rice is the staple of the parganah. For the spring harvest are grown a large quantity of wheat and communications. and a smaller quantity of chick-pea, (chana) barley, lentils, (mas\u00far), and mustard (l\u00e1hi.) Fruit is supplied by 1,500 acres of grove or\norchard. The wild hemp (bhang), which provides an intoxicating drug, grows like a weed in the fields. Catechu is tapped from innumerable khair acacias. But except in the vegetable kingdom, Tilpur has no products worthy of mention. Its trade is extremely limited, and its markets are of the agricultural order. Such are Nichlaval, Siswa, and Mithaura, with their minor rivals, Rudrapur, Harilapur, Bil\u00e1hikpur, Barbia, Chatia, Madanpura, and Chank. T\u00fatibh\u00e1ri and Kotibh\u00e1r are important on other than commercial grounds. The southern part of the parganah is fairly provided with communications. Four unmetalled roads run northwards to meet and end at Nichlaval, whilst a fifth crosses three of them in a westerly direction.\n\nIn the fourteenth century the principality of B\u00fatwal, with its capital at History. the foot of the Nep\u00e1l hills, was founded by an adventurer of uncertain origin. This Makhund Singh, or his descendants, gradually seized the whole of Bin\u00e1yakpur and Tilpur from the Th\u00e1-r\u00fas. It is probable that before the end of the sixteenth century Tilpur had been separated from the rest of this petty kingdom, as a fief for younger sons. The parganah is at all events mentioned as a distinct sub-division in Akbar's Institutes (1596), which adds that there is a brick castle at Tilpur; but no town or village thus called remains. The name of Tilak was perhaps common in the B\u00fatwal family. For after a prince so named Tilpur is said to have been called; and with another prince so named the parganah is connected in the beginning of the eighteenth century. This Tilak II. had held Tilpur as a fief from his cousin, the r\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal; but resenting another's suzerainty, he declared himself an independent r\u00e1ja. Calling in the aid of the warlike hucksters known as Banj\u00e1ras, he for long resisted the power of B\u00fatwal. But the internecine conflict led probably to arrears of revenue. About 1750 the naw\u00e1b of Oudh, the nominal ruler of the district, sent a large force to realize the land-tax. That force first defeated Tilak Sen's son, and afterwards came to terms with the B\u00fatwal r\u00e1ja. In accordance with those terms, or by right of the sword, the latter re-annexed Tilpur.\n\nCeded to the English in 1801, Tilpur was a few years afterwards annexed by the Nep\u00e1lese, who, having defeated the r\u00e1ja of Butwal, chose to consider it as still a part of his domains. The Nep\u00e1lese war followed, and the Nep\u00e1lese themselves disappeared. In the course of the campaign, however, Nichlaval and other places suffered from their incursions. After the great rebellion (1857-58) a northern strip of the parganah was granted to their descendants in reward for friendly services against the rebels. Amongst those rebels was the r\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal, whose family had for two generations been settled at Nichlaval.\nHis estates were confiscated and his title attainted. Since it became a British possession Tilpur has been assessed with the following land-revenues:\u2014Rs. 9,803 in 1803; Rs. 9,821 in 1806; Rs. 7,646 in 1809; Rs. 11,470 in 1813; Rs. 41,501 in 1840; and Rs. 41,888 in 1865. The increase which has taken place since the last date is chiefly due to the fact that the demands then assessed were in many cases progressive.\n\nT\u00fatf\u00edbh\u00e1ri, a village in the extreme northern corner of the parganah just described, adjoins the frontiers of Nep\u00e1l and parganah B\u00edn\u00e1yakpur. Situated on the banks of the Jharrei river in tappa Sukarhari, it lies 57 miles north north-east of Gorakhpur. It is far distant from any road, and its population was in 1872 limited to 1,468 persons. But T\u00fatf\u00edbh\u00e1ri is noticeable as the site of a third-class police-station and district post-office.\nSTATISTICAL,\nDESCRIPTIVE, AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNT\nOF THE\nBASTI DISTRICT.\n\nCOMPILED\nBY\nH.

Division, is for 38 miles on the north-\nnorth-east bounded by the kingdom of Nepal; for 98 miles\non the west-north-west by the Gonda district; for 62 miles\non the south-south-west by the Gh\u00e1gra river, which severs it from the district\nof Faizabad; and for 95 miles on the east by the Gorakhpur district. For east\nmight, perhaps, be written east by south; but for purposes of simplicity we\nneed hardly recognize more than sixteen points of the compass. The British\ntahsils which march with Basti are Utraula and Begamganj of Gouda; Faiza-\nbad and Akbarpur of Faizabad; and B\u00e1ns\u00e1g\u00f3n, Gorakhpur, and Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj\nof Gorakhpur.\n\nThe district extends from $26^\\circ 23' 0''$ to $27^\\circ 30' 0''$ north latitude, and\nfrom $82^\\circ 17' 0''$ to $83^\\circ 19' 30''$ east longitude. Its total area by the latest\nofficial statement was 1,784,049 acres, or something over 2,787$\\frac{1}{2}$ square\nmiles. Basti is, therefore, over 13 square miles larger than Lincolnshire.\nIts length from north to south varies between 52 and 68, with a mean\nof 60 miles; its breadth from east to west between 28 and 52 miles, with a\nmean of 40. The number of villages is returned as 7,524. The population,\n1,416,905 in 1865, had in 1872 risen to 1,472,994, or about 528 persons to\nthe square mile. But of both area and population further details will be given\nin part III. of this notice.\n\nFor purposes of administration, general and fiscal, Basti is divided into 5\nAdministrative tahsils or sub-collectorates, over which are distributed 8 par-\nsub-divisions. ganas or baronies. Here, as in Gorakhpur, we note the un-\nusual feature of parganahs lying partly in one and partly in another tahsil.\nBut though possessing separate records the parganahs are as administrative units\nalmost obsolete. The divisions of civil and criminal justice are respectively the\npetty judgeship (munshi) and the police-circle (th\u00e1na). Of the former there are\n3, whereof one, B\u00e1ns\u00e1g\u00f3n, is shared with the Gorakhpur district; of the\nlatter there are 26. But the following synopsis will show at a glance the\nvarious divisions, their equivalents at the close of the sixteenth century, and\ntheir modern land-revenue, area, and population.\n\n1The principal materials for this notice have been the settlement reports of Messrs. H.\nle P. Wynne, c.s., H. Wilson, c.s., and P. J. White, 1861-65; Martin's (Buchanan's) Eastern\nIndia, 1838; and the notes of Messrs. P. Wigram, c.s., and J. H. Thomson, c.s. But besides\nthese should be mentioned the census reports of 1872 and former years; the annual reports of\nthe various Government Departments; the records of the Board of Revenue, and brief memo-\nrands by different officers now or formerly posted in the district. References to other autho-\nrities, such as Elliot's Rulers and Historians, or Sherring's Causes, will be found in the text or foot-\nnotes. The British districts which surround Basti on three sides have all been described in the\nGazetteers of Oudh and the North-Western Provinces. From one of those districts, Gorakh-\npur, Basti was severed in 1865 only. It follows, therefore, that the scope of this notice is con-\nsiderably lessened, and that the Basti monograph will, in many respects, be little more than an\nappendix to that of Gorakhpur.\n\n2Government Circular No. 70A., dated 4th July, 1878.\n\n3This estimate excludes three outposts or stations of the fourth class. But it includes\ntwo which, before the end of the current financial year (1880-81), will be raised from the fourth\nclass to the third.\n| Tahsil | Farganah | Included by Akbar's Institutes (1569) in\u2014 | Land revenue (excluding cesses) in 1878-79. | Area in 1878. | Total population in 1872. | In the police jurisdiction of\u2014 | In the munsif of\u2014 |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------|\n| Domari\u00e9-gauj. | 1.

Throughout this notice, therefore, let Ras\u00falpur-Ghaus appear as Ras\u00falpur simply; Ratanpur-B\u00e1nsi as B\u00e1nsi; Aurangabad-Nagar as Nagar; Mans\u00farnagar-Basti as Basti; and Hasanpur-Maghar as Maghar. Here, as in Gorakhpur, the parganah divisions often coincide roughly with the limits of ancient principalities like Amorha, B\u00e1nsi, and Nagar. But of this enough will be said in the Gazetteer articles on the parganahs themselves. Before quitting the second column of the table we need only mention that eastern portions of Bin\u00e1yakpur and Maghar will be found in the Gorakhpur district.\n\nOn the compilation of Akbar's Institutes (1596) Basti formed part of the Gorakhpur and Avadh divisions (sark\u00e1r) of the Oudh or Avadh province (s\u00edba). In the Gorakhpur division and district (dast\u00far) were included parganahs Ras\u00falpur-Ghaus, Katahla, Bin\u00e1yakpur, Rihlap\u00e1ra, Mahauli, Mandwa and Ratanpur-Maghar; in the Haveli Avadh district of the Avadh division parganah Amorha. Katahla was B\u00e1nsi north of the R\u00e9pti. The old name became extinct when the Sarnet Raja of B\u00e1nsi defeated and slew the Bhar or Solankhi Raja of Katahla. B\u00e1nsi south of the R\u00e9pti was called Ratanpur, and included, as above shown, in the same parganah as Maghar. So far we have been dealing with certainties. But whether Rihlapara and Nagar are identical is doubtful. The identification was suggested by Mr. Reade, who may have been quite as wrong as when he made Amorha coincide with a lost sixteenth century parganah called Mandla. All the copies of the Institutes inspected by Sir Henry Elliot give Kihlap\u00e1ra, and Mr. Reade seems to have been the first who substituted an R for the K.\n\nWhen ceded by Oudh to the British (1801) all these parganahs were included in the Gorakhpur district; and in Gorakhpur they remained until 1864-65, when severed to constitute the existing district of Basti. Some account of their vicissitudes during the interval will be found in the Gorakhpur notice; but since their separation they have undergone no important changes of area. Nor have they discarded those ancient tappa sub-divisions whose multitude was the geographical peculiarity of the united district.\n\nAbove have been given some of Mr. E. B. Alexander's speculations as to the origin of tappas. He suggests that these tracts represent the subordinate fiefs into which the old Hindu r\u00e1j or principality was divided. But whether Hindu or not in origin, in name they are probably Muslim. In Persia tappa means a small hill; but the word is found also in Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n and other\n\n---\n\n1 Buchanan thinks that this prince belonged to the former tribe; some informants of Mr. Wynne placed him in the latter. 2 Mr. E. A. Reade, C.B., was successively Collector of Gorakhpur-Basti, Commissioner of Gorakhpur, and Senior Member of the Board of Revenue. He is the author of a work on the Inferior Castes of the North-Western Provinces. 3 Supra, pp. 274-76. 4pp. 277-78.\nparts of Central Asia. It is easy to imagine that the hill gave its name to the village stronghold which crowned it, and the village stronghold to the surrounding lands. But it is only fair to add that to the Persian of India\u2014the French of Stratford-att\u00e9-Bow\u00e9\u2014the word is unknown. Both Wilson and Forbes class it as Hindi. In Basti there are 130 tappas, distributed as follows over the different parganahs and tabsils:\n\n| Tahsil | Parganah | Tappa |\n|--------|----------|-------|\n| Domari\u0101-Ganj | Ras\u016blpur | 1.

Such is Geuk-Tepe (Gank-tappa), which may, perhaps, be translated Blue-bill.\nHaving now shown the revenue, criminal, and civil jurisdictions into which the district is divided, let us briefly notice the staff by which those jurisdictions are worked. The revenue and criminal courts are those of the magistrate-collector, his two covenanted subalterns, his deputy, and his five tahsildars. An European honorary magistrate has criminal powers in tahsil Khalilabad. The only civil courts are those of the three munisifs. The judge of Gorakhpur tries cases on committal from the magistrates, and on appeal from both magistrates and munisifs.\n\nThe principal district officials remaining to be mentioned are the civil surgeon, the district engineer,\u00b9 the district superintendent of police, the sub-deputy opium agent and his two assistants, the deputy-inspector of schools, and the postmaster. It may be noted that the \"deputy opium agent\" is the magistrate-collector, the prefect of the district. But from interference with the \"sub-deputy\" he in practice abstains.\n\nBasti may be defined as a well-watered and well-wooded alluvial plain, sloping almost imperceptibly towards the south-east. Hills it has none. Though some 450 miles distant from the nearest breakers of the Bengal Bay, it has a mean height above the sea of 326 feet only. The elevations of the dozen Great Trigonometrical Survey stations vary from but 353 to 302 feet. The district then is flat, so flat that its many streams and lakes cannot be seen from any distance. But of the Basti scenery as of most sceneries, it may be said that it is at times not without a beauty of its\n\n\u00b9 The Gorakhpur engineer is at present (1880-81) in charge of the district. But Basti had until quite lately an engineer of its own, and is not likely to remain much longer without one.\nown. There is a loveliness of colour as well as of form; and under the cloud-flecked sunlight of a day in the rains the gaze is refreshed by a verdure of many tints. At the close of the rains, again, the untrodden snows of the Himalaya sometimes lend a grand background to a northward view. But these are mere transient beauties, which vanish when the crops are cut and the haze of summer fills the air. It is perhaps in the many clumps of timber that the landscape finds its one stable element of the picturesque. Large groves of the evergreen mango abound all over the district. Feathery bamboos may be seen growing round most of the villages.\n\nMahua trees, with their mouse-odoured white flowers, are plentiful; but most plentiful on the banks of the Kuana and the Ami, in the middle of the district. Here they are clearly the survivors of the forest which once almost covered Basti. Their liquor-yielding virtues saved them when the ground was reclaimed for cultivation. In the north may be found a few other remnants of ancient woodland; but no valuable timber has been left. During the past fifty years forest and waste land have been cleared to an enormous extent. No less than 100,153 acres have been bestowed or leased under the jungle-grant rules; and of this area the bulk has been reclaimed. No waste-land now remains at the disposal of Government. And this statement implies also that there are no forests reserved by Government itself.\n\nThe following table shows the more important statistics concerning the more important jungle-grants, those, that is, which have an area of over 3,000 acres:\n\n| Pargahah | Name of grant | Area in acres | To whom granted | When granted | By whom now held | At what term expiring |\n|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|\n| Bansi, tappa Ghos | Alfdapur | 9,852 | Mr. T.

The first is that extending southwards from the Nep\u00e1l frontier to the R\u00e1pti. About twenty miles north of that frontier runs the first range of the lower Him\u00e1laya; and this tract is an integral part of the great sub-montane marsh called the Tar\u00e1i. In Basti it is about a score miles broad. Being exposed to a heavy rainfall, and flooded by the freshets of hill-streams, it is well-adapted to the cultivation of rice. This, indeed, is its staple crop. Much of it is too swampy to produce any other growth, and much was but lately cleared of jungle. The appearance of the inhabitants is sallow and aguish.\n\nBut when once it reaches the great catchwater drain of the R\u00e1pti, the swampliness perforce ends. The second or central belt, between that river and the Ku\u00e1na, is far less paludinous. The rainfall is smaller, the inundations are less frequent and serious. Moisture escapes by the \u00c1mi and other streams, besides those which bound the tract. Health improves. Rice is still the principal growth; but wheat and other cereals are fairly plentiful. The breadth of this belt varies from 12 miles on the west to 24 on the east.\n\nThe third or southern belt, that bounded by the Ku\u00e1na and Gh\u00e1gira, differs much from both its northern parallels. Parts of this also are marshy; this also is traversed by many small streams. But by those streams the rainfall escapes more rapidly; except in the south eastern corner, where the Ku\u00e1na is joined by a channel of the Gh\u00e1gira, inundations are rare; and the soil is much sandier, much drier. Rice is no longer the chief crop; and for the ordinary cereals irrigation is required. The tract ranges in breadth from 28 miles on the west to 12 on the east.\n\nWhat strata underlie the deep alluvial crust of the district is unknown; but it is consoling to know that the question is one of little present importance. The surface itself seems a fluviatile or estuarine formation of comparatively modern origin. Its soils are much the same as those described in the Gorakhpur notice. The same soil may bear different names according as its ingredients or its situation is considered; and while revenue records adopt the nomenclature by composition, the people prefer that by position.\n\nBy composition soils are *doras* or loamy; *mattiy\u00e1r* or clayey; *balua* or Classed according to sandy; and *bh\u00e1t* or limey clay. Owing to the rather disconnected nature of the Gorakhpur-Basti land-assessment, no general estimate of the space filled by each of these varieties is forthcoming. But it is believed that they have here been named in the order of predominance.\n\n---\n\n1 Pp. 284-85.  \n2 In three parganahs only, Ras\u00falpur, Nagar and Basti, did the settlement reports attempt any classification of soils. And even in these the classification was not uniform.\nDoras or loam is a compound of sand and clay, chiefly the former. It is Doras, mattiy\u00e1r, the d\u016bmat, rausli, and siw\u00e1i of other tracts in these probalua, and bh\u00e1t. vinces; and owing to its absorbent power and softness, is considered the best of soils. On it are grown all crops except rice. Mattiy\u00e1r, on the other hand, produces fine rice, while its outturn of spring crops is inferior in quantity and quality. In this soil the clay easily predominates over the sand; in balua, elsewhere called bh\u00e1r, the predominance of the sand is equally unmistakeable. Even with the aid of manure and irrigation balua yields but poor crops of the poorer grains. Bh\u00e1t is found in the low basins of rivers, and chiefly of northern rivers. Plentiful in parganah Ras\u00falpur, it is still commoner in parganahs Bin\u00e1yakpur and B\u00e1nsi. Its favourite localities are, in fact, the banks of the R\u00e1pti and of its numerous discarded channels, as, for instance, in tappas Awainia, Bh\u00e1tinpur, Nitwal, Kundri, Chhattisi, Bh\u00edr, and Patharhat. It produces the most luxuriant wheat and other spring crops, which are raised with the least possible outlay; for, being generally subject to flooding in the rains, bh\u00e1t requires no irrigation. Though for the same reason it bears no autumn crop, it is deemed of greater value than lands which return two harvests yearly.\n\nThe distinction between doras and mattiy\u00e1r is often very doubtful. In Ras\u00falpur Mr. Wynne found that if specimens of both soils were dried, pulverized, and again moistened, the difference between them was \"absolutely inappreciable.\" The fact seems to be that the settlement surveyors here classed as mattiy\u00e1r lands cropped in autumn, and as doras lands cropped in spring. Such a distinction would of course depend, not on the intrinsic constitution of the soils, but on their greater elevation and depression; on their capacity, that is, for retaining a smaller or larger proportion of moisture. The land classed as doras, and therefore as of the best quality, was often of the worst. He had never, he added, heard the natives use the terms doras and mattiy\u00e1r except in connection with the Government demand.\n\nTo the people, indeed, the only familiar classification is that by position. Soils are distinguished according to their relative situation with regard to village sites or the beds of rivers.\n\nThus, every village is theoretically circled into three concentric belts, the goend, gwaind or \"near,\" surrounding the homestead; the miy\u00e1na\u00b9 or \"middle,\" surrounding the gcend; and the pallu or \"distant,\" surrounding the miy\u00e1na. Here, as in the D\u00fa\u00e1b, where the same system prevails under a different nomencla-\n\n\u00b9In the records of the earlier British assessments this miy\u00e1na zone is sometimes called ausat.\nture, an obvious reason can be given for the oblivion of natural differences. The inherent character of the soil has been lost in its artificial advantages. The most highly cultivated land is the best, irrespective of its original nature. The goend is the most manured, the miy\u00e1na is the slightly manured zone. The pallu, perhaps, is never manured at all; but often contains some of those much-prized clay lands which are fit for the growth of winter rice (jarhan).\n\nWhen its position with regard to the bed of a river is considered, the soil may be either upland (b\u00e1ngar) or lowland (kach\u00e1r, kh\u00e1l\u00edr). The uplands are the sandy ridges of watersheds; and when irrigated will produce spring crops. The lowlands occupy the river basins, and consist of late alluvial deposits. The m\u00e1njha or sandy deposits of the Gh\u00e1gra are fit for little but the growth of thatching grass and tamarisk (jhau); but the silt left by the R\u00e1pti often consists of the fine moist bh\u00e1t above described. The banks of some of the smaller streams present long stretches of hard impracticable soil, which is often completely sterilized by saline efflorescence (reh). Such tracts and the occasional but rare patches of similar ground inland are called dh\u00fas when simply hard and impracticable; when subject to saline efflorescence, ri\u00e1i (reh-hai) or \u00fasar. Such efflorescence is in and ravines. Basti, however, a rather uncommon phenomenon. Even in the Domari\u00e1ganj and B\u00e1nsi tahsils, where it seems to be commonest, no \u00fasar plain of any size could be discovered. The efflorescing salt is collected by washermen and makers of glass ornaments. Under the name of salt-earth flowers (rehar matti ka ph\u00fal) it was in Buchanan's time exported somewhat largely to the east. A few ravines may be found on the edges of rivers; but no large area is rendered barren by a net-work of such erosions. Of the total area, 2,344 square miles are returned as cultivable, and of these but 516 are uncultivated.\n\nWater is of course nearer the surface in the lowlands than in the uplands; but for any generalization as to its average depth throughout the district, statistics are unluckily wanting. The distance from the surface must be slightest in the moist north-R\u00e1pti country; but the settlement reports and Mr. Swinton's Manual confine their figures to the central and southern parganahs. Let us first examine the returns of the former essays. The total depth of a well in Ras\u00falpur is given as from 18 to 19\u00bd feet; and allowance being made for at least a yard of water, the distance from the surface must here be between 15 and 16\u00bd feet. In\n\n1 N.-W. P. and Oudh Administration Report, 1878-79.\nBasti the average depth of wells is $14\\frac{5}{6}$ feet, and the distance from the water to the mouth $9\\frac{1}{2}$. The corresponding figures for Maghar are $19\\frac{1}{2}$ and $13\\frac{1}{2}$ respectively; for Nagar $25\\frac{7}{8}$ and $21\\frac{1}{2}$. At Rudhauli in Maghar Mr. Swinton discovered a well whose water lay but $5\\frac{1}{2}$ feet from the surface. The only parganah, however, in which his statistics have not been superseded by those of the settlement reports is Amorha. Sounding individual wells in those villages, he found the distance from the mouth at Datnagar 8, at Amorha 9, and at Captaininganj 12 feet. By striking a rough average for the central and southern parganahs, Mr. J. B. Thomson obtains a water-level of 18 feet from the surface.\n\nThe more important of the Basti streams have already received passing mention; but the time has come to describe in detail both these and the rest. The drainage line of course follows what has been mentioned as the general slope of the country; and lies therefore from north-west to south-east. The drainage systems may be reduced to three\u2014those of the R\u00e1pti, of the Ku\u00e1na, and of that Gh\u00e1gra which in Gorakhpur receives both.\n\nLike the great river of Burma, the R\u00e1pti derives its name from that System of the R\u00e1pti. Ir\u00e1vati to whom legend assigns its formation. Ir\u00e1vati, or the Watery, was the cloud elephant on which rode Indra, god of thunder. But the R\u00e1pti is not, like the Irawaddy, a snow-fed stream. Rising in the Nepalese lower ranges, flowing westwards, and afterwards doubling back through Bahraich and Gonda, it touches this district at Singarjot in Ras\u00falpur (latitude $27\u00b0 18'$ north, longitude $82\u00b0 32'$ east). After running in a southerly direction for about ten miles, and forming so far the western boundary of Basti, it turns and winds east-south-eastwards across the whole district, leaving it at Karmaini-gh\u00e1t in Maghar (latitude $27\u00b0 1'$ north, longitude $83\u00b0 18'$ east). Thence it enters Gorakhpur, in which it finally joins the Gh\u00e1gra. A peculiarity of this river is that throughout Basti it has two distinct channels, both full during the rains, but one almost dry at other seasons.\u00b9\n\nThe old channel, or Budhi R\u00e1pti, enters the district about seven miles north of the modern bed. The distance between them increases to about ten miles before they once more approach each other. They were formerly about four miles\n\n\u00b9 By a mistake in addition, or a clerical error, the settlement report makes this figure 6 yards 1 foot 10 inches, or $19\\frac{1}{2}$ feet. Thus Mr. Wigram. But the two channels are now more distinct than the Burhganga and the Ganges. The one is not an offshoot of the other, though it may perhaps flow in that other's discarded bed.\napart at B\u00e1nsi, re-uniting close to Karmaini-gh\u00e1t. Such, at least, was the case when the district was surveyed in 1837-36. But since then a fresh change has occurred. At B\u00e1nsi the R\u00e1pti forced its way north, and following a depression, which was probably another ancient channel, joined the Budhi R\u00e1pti. From this point, therefore, the southern branch is now almost dry. But in the courses of the rivers which traverse the sub-Himalayan belt of the N.-W. provinces frequent changes are inevitable. Like the Po and the Mississippi, these streams in places gradually raise their beds above the level of the surrounding country. In times of flood the R\u00e1mganga and the R\u00e1pti \"spill\" over into the nearest depression, carving therein a fresh channel. The length of the R\u00e1pti in this district is 84 miles; but the distance in a straight line is only 48. Its two channels form a great catchwater drain which intercepts all streams from the north. The principal of these in eastward order are the following:\n\nThe \u00c1rra, which issues from the hills, divides the Nepalese from the Oudh Tar\u00e1i, forms for about seven miles the boundary between this district and Gonda, and at length joins the the Budhi R\u00e1pti.\n\nThe Awinda, the Sarohi, the Satobi, and other tributaries of the Budhi R\u00e1pti, which rise in the Nepalese Tar\u00e1i, and traverse the north of Basti for distances varying from six to nine miles.\n\nThe B\u00e1nganga or Arrow-river, a hill stream which, after a course of about 18 miles in this district, joins the Budhi R\u00e1pti at Kakrahi-gh\u00e1t, some 5 miles north-east of B\u00e1nsi.\n\nThe Masdi, the Jamw\u00e1r, the Siswa, the Marti and the Til\u00e1r, all, save the last, Tar\u00e1i streams, which uniting after a course in British territory of about 20 miles, form one river called the K\u00fara.\n\nThe K\u00fara itself, which six miles farther on falls into the Budhi R\u00e1pti, and thence to Karmaini-ghat is called the Dhamela.\n\nAnd the Gh\u00fanghi, a mountain-stream which joins the Dhamela after forming for many miles the boundary with Gorakhpur.\n\nFrom the right or southern bank, in Basti itself, no large brooks reinforce the R\u00e1pti. But the \u00c1mi, which joins it in Gorakhpur, is an important affluent on this side. Rising on the western frontier of the district, in latitude 27\u00b0 7' north, longitude 82\u00b043' east, near the Basti-Domari\u00fcganj road, the \u00c1mi flows south-eastwards; and after a course of about 44 miles quits Basti to join the R\u00e1pti in Gorakhpur.\nThe principal places on the banks of the R\u00e1pti are the tahsil capitals Domari\u00e1ganj and B\u00e1nsi, and the grain marts Bitharia, G\u00e1ora, and Tikar. Flowing through a sandy or other soft alluvial soil, this river is somewhat capricious in its choice of a bed. The two existing channels are by no means the only channels visible. For a long distance on either side of the river are depressions through which it once flowed; and villages which tradition places on its banks are often found many miles from it. South of B\u00e1nsi may be seen distinct traces of two old channels; whereas the R\u00e1pti now runs north of B\u00e1nsi. But since the change already mentioned\u2014since the main stream cut across the lowlands near that town, and reverted to the bed of the Budhi R\u00e1pti\u2014the course has altered little. The earth of which the banks are composed is, as a rule, too friable to admit of steepness. In the dry season the river is a series of long shallow reaches, studded with dry stretches of sand and enclosed between shelving declivities. Here and there, however, where the earth is firm and the current strong, steep cliffs may be seen overhanging darkling pools. During the rains the river is full to overflowing; and, where the banks are lower than usual, escapes to flood afar the surrounding country. By such inundations are formed many large swamps and lagoons. At B\u00e1nsi, where B\u00e1nganga approaches R\u00e1pti, the whole tract between them is sometimes overlaid with water for six miles.\n\nBut the B\u00e1nganga is not the only flood-spreading affluent of the R\u00e1pti. Those of the latter's tributaries which do not rise in the hills have their source in low marshy spots, such as ricefields. At length is reached a series of hollows in which the water seems to stand; and a defined channel soon after begins to make its appearance. The bushy banks at last become steep. But in the monsoon they are quite unable to contain the stream, which sometimes floods the neighbourhood for days. The amount of silt thus deposited is in any single year inappreciable; but during a long course of years has in places had a marked effect in raising the level of the country. After an experience of more than two decades in the district, the planter Mr. Pepp\u00e9 noticed that many parts of his estate had acquired a much higher surface. Land which had of yore been flooded deeply every year was now high and dry enough to yield a wheat crop. The fertility of the soil is indeed more often improved than spoilt by the deposits of the R\u00e1pti's tributaries. Of such streams the steadiest is the \u00c1mi; for after crossing the Basti-B\u00e1nsi road this runs between steep banks which in ordinary years it\nnever overflows. The \u00c1mi and the Jamw\u00e1r are amongst the few Basti rivers for which any statistics of velocity or depth are forthcoming. Where crossed by the Basti-Menhd\u00e1wal road the \u00c1mi varies in depth from seven feet during the dry to 27 during the rainy season. In the latter its flood velocity is ten feet per second. The corresponding figures for the Jamw\u00e1r, taken on the B\u00e1nsi-Nep\u00e1l road, are depth, 4' to 22 feet; velocity, 5.\n\nThe R\u00e1pti is throughout its course in Basti navigable by boats of 100 maunds.\\(^1\\) During the rains vessels of the same burden ply on the B\u00e1nganga, which at other seasons is useless for navigation. The K\u00fara and its continuation, the Dhamela, would in flooded months bear country boats of any size; but in such months there is little traffic. On the right bank of the K\u00fara, and the lands of several villages, stands the large grain mart of Uska, which collects and distributes the rice of the surrounding country and the Nep\u00e1lese Tar\u00fai. This and other grains are in winter sent down the river to its junction with the R\u00e1pti, in boats of 100 maunds; and, reshipped in larger vessels, pass through Gorakhpur to the Gh\u00e1gra. No other affluents of the R\u00e1pti are navigable.\n\nAcross the R\u00e1pti there are many private ferries, of which the two principal, at Domari\u00e1ganj and B\u00e1nsi respectively, belong to the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi. For these in the dry season are substituted bridges of boats. Other ferries, the property of the same owner, convey the Domari\u00e1ganj-Nep\u00e1l road across the Budhi R\u00e1pti and the Arra. The B\u00e1nsi-Nep\u00e1l road passes the B\u00e1nganga and Budhi R\u00e1pti just below their confluence, by the r\u00e1ja's ferry in the rains and by ford in the dry season. The Jamw\u00e1r it spans on a bridge. A branch which leaves this highway for Lautan crosses the K\u00fara at Soh\u00e1s, by bridge of boats in the dry and ferry in the flooded months. Another branch passes through Rehra-b\u00e1z\u00e1r to cross the K\u00fara by ferry. The \u00c1mi is bridged by roads from Basti to Domari\u00e1ganj, B\u00e1nsi, and Gorakhpur; while on that from Khal\u00edlabad to Menhd\u00e1wal it is crossed by a ferry. The other streams of the R\u00e1pti system are fordable in the dry weather. In the rains the country is so flooded that traffic ceases to cross them.\n\nWe come now to a far less important system, that of the Ku\u00e1na. Rising System of the in Gonda, near Balr\u00e1mpur, the Ku\u00e1na after a course of Ku\u00e1na. 28 miles reaches the western corner of parganah Ras\u00falpur\n\n\\(^1\\) i.e. of between 3 and 4 tons.\n(long. 82\u00b0 30' E., lat. 27\u00b0 9' N.). Between this and Gonda it forms the boundary for some 16 miles. Flowing next for about 54 through parganahs Basti and Mahauli, it enters Gorakhpur; and some 20 miles lower falls into the Ghagra. Its depth near Basti varies from 13 feet in the shrunken to 40 in the flooded season; and its highest recorded velocity during the latter is 7 feet per second. The Kuana receives in Basti many tributaries, but none of any great size. The principal are the Katnehia from the north and the Rawai and Manwar or Manarama from the south. The Manwar, again, is replenished on its right or southern bank by a small stream known as the Ramrekha.\n\nThe Kuana is in Basti noted for the firmness of its banks, which in the upper part of its course, as far as the neighbourhood of the district capital, are steep and high. For twenty miles every bend marked in the revenue survey map of 1837-38 still exists. But when the river has been reinforced at Lalganj by the Mauwar, its bed becomes more shiftily sandy and its banks more sloping. On those banks scrubwood at the same time gives place to grass. The Manwar itself has shelving sides. Rising in Gonda, it passes through parganahs Amorha and Nagar, draining the south of the district. Its low-water depth on the Basti and Tanda road is 7 feet, its flood depth 22; and its velocity when swollen by heavy rain is 6 feet a second. The other southern tributary, the Rawai, is a small stream with steep banks. The Katnehia and its affluent, the Garehia, are mere channels in the centre of a broad depression. Their sources are swamps crossed by the Basti-Bansi road. In the dry season they contain very little water; but what remains is carefully embanked for irrigation. Herein these streams differ from the Rawai, which becomes too dry to furnish the spring crops with water.\n\nThe only noteworthy villages on the banks of the Kuana are the marts of Mansurnagar, Deoragon, Lalganj, and Mukhlispur. The Navigation and river is throughout the district navigable. In the dry season, however, navigation is above Deoragon obstructed not only by occasional shoals, which prevent boats with a draught of over three feet from passing, but also by rude bridges on piles, constructed for local and temporary use. Snags, too, are not uncommon. But below Deoragon the river is used all the year round by boats of 100 maunds. For vessels of the same burden the Manwar is in the rains navigable as high as Haraia. Being, however, narrow and sinuous, it is little navigated, and its banks can boast no large marts.\nThe Ku\u00e1na is crossed near Basti by a bridge, and at Mans\u00farnagar, L\u00e1l-ganj and Mukhlispur by ferries. The Manwar and R\u00e1m-rekha are bridged on the road from Basti to Faizabad; the former on that from Basti to T\u00e1nda. Except in the rains the Raw\u00e1i is fordable. The Katnehia and Garehia are bridged on the Basti-Gorakhpur road. Soon after their junction they are met by that from Basti to Menhd\u00e1wal, which crosses them on a pile-bridge.\n\nThe third and last river system is that of the Gh\u00e1gra or Sarju. The name Gh\u00e1gra, or more properly Gh\u00e1ghra, is a corruption of the Sanskrit onomatopoeia Gharghara. It may, therefore, for want of some more high-sounding English equivalent, be translated Gurgle. The river so-called bounds the whole south-south-western length of the district from Ajudhya-gh\u00e1t on the Faizabad to Bel-gh\u00e1t on the Gorakhpur frontier. But of the district drainage this river directly receives almost nothing. Except in the immediate neighbourhood of its banks, all surplus water is intercepted by the Manwar or the Kn\u00e1na. When the Gh\u00e1gra indeed is in flood, it is less a receiver than a giver of drainage. By overflowing its banks and drowning the adjoining lowlands, it often does serious damage. In 1870 some unusually heavy floods on the Manwar were explained by the fact that the Gh\u00e1gra had from opposite Ajudhya spilt across country into that river. Next year the Gh\u00e1gra flooded much land, and destroyed the crops in the south of parganah Mahauli. In one instance, near Sonh\u00e1n in parganah Mahauli, has been formed for four miles a deep channel through which some of the Sarju\u2019s surplus waters yearly pass into the Ku\u00e1na, making the latter navigable for country boats of all sizes. This channel now bears the name of the Malda.\n\nThe river wanders through a broad sandy bed which shifts from year to year. The width of the basin between the high firm banks is fully four miles; and of this three or four are sometimes occupied by a flooded rapid stream. In dry weather the river is a mixture of water and sand-banks, the resort of the \u201ccruel, crafty crocodile.\u201d It is then fringed by broad tracts of light sandy soil, here barren, there bearing a spontaneous crop of tamarisk (jh\u00fao) bushes, and elsewhere, where a little good silt has settled, cultivated.\n\nOnce, though so long since that the date is forgotten, the stream ran on the northern side of the basin. This is clearly shown by the old boats that are sometimes unearthed there. But the great river changed its course and forced its way to the extreme south, where it ate into the bank till stopped by the firmness of the soil. For some years past again the process has been reversed.\nYear by year more of the inhabited lowland which has formed on the northern side is being cut away. The stream, too, is changing its course, and the deep current edging northwards.\n\nSchemes for strengthening the northern bank, opposite Ajudhya or elsewhere, have been considered; but such schemes usually end in the prudent resolve to avoid the costly and dangerous process of playing with water.\n\nThe Gh\u00e1gra is navigable by country boats of all tonnages. The sand-banks already mentioned are especially numerous in the western part of its course, from Ajudhya to T\u00e1nda; but oppose no serious obstacle to navigation. On the northern or Basti side of the river are situated no large marts. There are ferries at the R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t or Royal Landing of Ajudhya, at Teora, Bilahari, Marna, Dalpatpur, Begamganj, Sherwa, Salona, Mahripur, the R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t of T\u00e1nda, Mubarakpur, Ph\u00falpur, Naurahni, Mainli, Chuhora, Mans\u00farganj, and Ch\u00e1ndipur. All these crossings, except that at the R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t of Ajudhya, are managed by the Collector of Basti. On none of them is a bridge of boats at any season maintained.\n\nOn the banks of the Gh\u00e1gra the rule for the adjustment of boundary disputes between riparian proprietors differs from that in force elsewhere. Here it has been decided that the deep stream alone shall be the boundary; that it alone shall determine to which district and to which village the disputed land belongs. In other parts of Basti the more general rule prevails. In these too the deep stream is ordinarily the boundary; and land gradually thrown up by a river belongs to the estate whereto it has accrued. But land, severed by a sudden change of channel and still capable of recognition, belongs to the estate from which it has been divided.\n\nNone of the larger rivers is used for irrigation. In the dry season, when water is most required, their beds are too far below the level of the country to compete with wells or lagoons. But it has been already noted that some of the Ku\u00e1na's affluents are dammed to supply the fields with water; and the same may be said of all the smaller streams. Even the \u00c1mi is in the upper part of its course no exception to this rule. The dams are mere earthen banks some three feet high; and being unable to withstand a flow of any volume, offer no real obstruction to a stream in the rains. But in the north-east of B\u00e1nsi may be seen conspicuous examples of more solid embankments. By substantially damming the Jamw\u00e1r and the S\u00edswa, two\nEnglish grantees of waste-land have provided irrigation for the whole of their estates. Basti has no Government canals; and whether it needs any is doubtful.\n\nLakes and swampy lagoons of many sizes are almost innumerable. Large tracts being subject to inundation in the rains, and the whole country being very flat, the surface drainage lodges in every slight hollow. Near the R\u00e1pti such hollows are often, as may be seen from their serpentine form, discarded channels of that river. By its overflow are filled the Bakhira and Pathra lakes (t\u00e1l), the largest sheets of water in the district.\n\nThe Bakhira or Bad\u00e1nch T\u00e1l, sometimes called the Motijhil, lies on the eastern frontier of the district, between Bakhira and Menhd\u00e1wal of parganah Maghar. The much-travelled Buchanan describes it as the \"finest piece of fresh water\" that he had seen in India. It holds water all the year round, the eastern or R\u00e1pti end being closed by an embankment. The lake thus formed in its deepest parts seldom outdepths four or five feet; but it covers a space of nearly five miles by two. On the western and southern sides, where the banks slope regularly down, the fringe of marsh is slight. But on the other sides no inhabited villages can be seen for miles; and the land is in the rains so constantly flooded that except for pasturage it is almost useless. To the north this flooded tract extends for fully three miles, dividing the swampy ground and rice fields on the edge of the lake from the villages on the higher banks of the R\u00e1pti. To the east there is a low fen stretching for about two miles to the edge of that river. Over this the floods spread every year to fill the lake; and over it the water would escape if not detained by embankment.\n\nThe Pathra T\u00e1l, which lies on the right bank of the R\u00e1pti between Domari\u00e1-ganj and B\u00e1nsi, is three miles long and from one to two broad. Its shape is highly irregular. In olden times it must have been a fine lake, but its waters are now allowed to return at the close of the rains to the river. The proprietors through whose lands the outlet passes refuse to let the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi, who owns the lake, build an embankment in their boundaries. The Chaur T\u00e1l, the property of the same owner, is wedged within the confluence of B\u00e1nganga and R\u00e1pti, not far north of B\u00e1nsi. In the rains the space between the rivers is, as already mentioned, extensively flooded; and the subsiding floods leave the Chaur T\u00e1l about two miles long by three-quarters of a mile\n\n---\n\n1 A list for tahsil Harai alone shows 37 considerable sheets of water. Yet tahsil Harai lies in the least swampy belt of the district.\nin width. It should be noted that in Basti, as in Norfolk, *chaur* or \"broad\" is a generic term for a stream-fed lake. The Chaur T\u00e1l is not the only chaur of the district, but merely the *chaur, par excellence*, in a certain part of the district. The wildfowl shooting on this and on the Pathra T\u00e1l is preserved by the r\u0101ja. One of the southern parganahs, Nagar, is graced by another large lake called the Chandu T\u00e1l.\n\nThe Chandu lake. This is fully two and a-half miles long and one broad. Except at the eastern end, where the water escapes to finally join the Manwar, the Chandu has regularly sloping sides. All these lakes or lagoons are more or less used for irrigation. All in winter offer more or less employment to the fowling-piece. The whole country is so moist that they have no particular effect on the general health. But to the almost ubiquitous swamps and marshes must be attributed the fever, ague, and spleen diseases which ravage the district.\n\nUntil lately Basti enjoyed the evil reputation of complete division from the rest of the world. Now, however, its county town is within what, in this country of long distances, might be called easy reach of a railway. The Oudh and Rohilkhand line passes through the neighbouring district of Faizabad; and within a radius of 38 miles from Basti are the stations of Malipur, Akbarpur, Gos\u0101inganj, Nara, Ajudhya, and Faizabad. Of these the most easily accessible are Akbarpur and Faizabad, which lie respectively about 30 and 40 miles distant by road. But between the district and the railway the Gh\u00e1gra fixes in the rains a great gulf.\n\nThe three southern tahsils are traversed by one great metalled road, that from Gorakhpur to Faizabad via Basti. This has within the district itself a length of 61 miles. But by the Public Works Department it is divided into two separate highways, one of 28 miles from Basti to Gorakhpur, the other of 33 from Basti to Faizabad. Connecting the cantonments of Faizabad with those of Gorakhpur, the road is of some military importance; and it is flanked by encamping grounds at Khalilabad, Marirwa, Basti, Tilokpur, Mangh\u00e1t, and Khaliy\u00e1npur. As a trade route the road is chiefly valuable between Faizabad and Basti. On it are situated three tahsil capitals, Khalilabad, Basti, and Haraia.\n\nOf the remaining roads, all unmetalled, the chief are those from Basti to Nep\u00e1l, via the tahsil capital of B\u00e1nsi; from Basti to Nep\u00e1l, via the tahsil capital of Domari\u00e1ganj; from Basti to Karmaini-gh\u00e1t, via Menhdawal; from Basti to T\u00e1nda, via R\u00e1jgh\u00e1t; and from Bikramjot on the Faizabad to Bh\u00e1npur on the B\u00e1nsi line. But the following list will show at a glance all\nroads, divided into class I., metalled, raised and bridged; class II., raised and bridged but not metalled; and class III., occasionally bridged, but neither metalled nor raised:\n\n| First-class roads. | Mileage within district. |\n|--------------------|--------------------------|\n| Basti and Gorakhpur | ...                       |\n| \" Faizabad         | ...                       |\n| Total              | ... 61                    |\n\n| Second-class roads. | Mileage within district |\n|---------------------|-------------------------|\n| Basti to Tanda      | ... 16                  |\n| \" Nejli, via Domariagaj | ... 50                |\n| \" Bansri and Naugarh | ... 60                  |\n| \" Pipra             | ... 3                    |\n| \" Karmaini-ghat     | ... 35                  |\n| Uska to Naugarh, Birdpur and Nepali frontier | ... 24 |\n| Total               | ... 178                 |\n\n| Third-class roads. | Mileage within district |\n|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Bikramjot to Bhinpur | ... 30                |\n| Gorakhpur to Biskohar | ... 55                |\n| Dumdumwa to Dhakeri | ... 36                  |\n| Jharna to Nepali frontier | ... 3            |\n| Gorakhpur frontier to Birdpur, via Uska | ... 22 |\n| Udaipur, Dumdumwa and Lautan | ... 20 |\n| Birdpur to Intwa    | ... 28                  |\n| Alidapur to Nepal frontier | ... 8   |\n| Misrauli to Dhebarua | ... 10                  |\n| Bansri, Domariaganj and Biskohar | ... 34 |\n| Bhinpur to Nandaur  | ... 26                  |\n| Bakhira to Chhapra-ghat | ... 36 |\n| Murerwa to Gae-ghat | ... 18                  |\n| Basti to Lalganj     | ... 12                  |\n| Kuana-bridge, near Basti, to junction with last | ... 5 |\n| Basti to Kothila     | ... 14                  |\n| Gorakhpur and Gonda frontiers | ... 65 |\n| Lautan to Nepali frontier | ... 7   |\n| Chandradip-ghat, via Bitharia, to Mankaura | ... 13 |\n| Total               | ... 441                 |\n\nGrand Total, all classes ... 680\n\nOn the downfall of the rains traffic north of the Rapti comes to an almost complete standstill. The roads are either lost under a sea of water, or, being unmetalled, are converted into long lines of mire. None is thoroughly\nbridged, in the sense of possessing bridges wherever required; and in such a tract and season unbridged roads are useless. But here it may be noted that the district is nowhere rich in bridges. The largest is the iron girder structure over the Ku\u00e1na near Basti; and even this is but 165 feet long. The manner in which the principal roads cross the principal streams has been told under the heading of rivers.\n\nThus may be shown the distances from the capital to the other principal places of the district. But the figures in every case represent mileage by road, and not distance as the crow flies. Paikaulia, for instance, is 37 miles distant by road, and is entered as such; but by cross-country cart-tracks the 37 miles could perhaps be reduced to 20:\n\n| Place                  | Distance in miles from Basti | Place                  | Distance in miles from Basti |\n|------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Amorha                 | 28                           | Domariaganj            | 32                           |\n| Bang\u00e1on and Parasr\u00e1mpur| No road.                     | Dudh\u00e1ra                | 15                           |\n| Bankata                | 32                           | G\u00e1egh\u00e1t                | 16                           |\n| B\u00e1ns\u00ed                  | 32                           | Har\u00e1ia                 | 17                           |\n| B\u00e1rak\u00fani               | 24                           | Hariharpur             | No road.                     |\n| Birdpur                | 57                           | Intwa                  | 42                           |\n| Bisokhar               | 50                           | Kalv\u00e1ri                | 12                           |\n| Buddh\u00e1band             | 13                           | Khalilabad             | 22                           |\n| Belwa-b\u00e1z\u00e1r            | 28                           | Kothila and Sonaha     | 92                           |\n| Bakhira                | 26                           | Lautan                 | 56                           |\n| Captainganj            | 8                            | Maghar                 | 27                           |\n| Ch\u00e1honi                | 22                           | Mahauli                | No road.                     |\n| Chhapia                | 25                           | Menhd\u00e1wal              | 27                           |\n| Chhapra-gh\u00e1t           | 45                           | Miar\u00e1llia              | 54                           |\n| Chilis                 | 50                           | Mahson                 | 7                            |\n| Dhebaru                | 59                           | Paikaulia              | 37                           |\n| Dubaulia               | 23                           | Rudhauli               | 19                           |\n| Deldalha               | 33                           | Tilokpur               | No road.                     |\n| Dhaghata               | 40                           | Uska                   | 50                           |\n\nBang\u00e1on and Parasr\u00e1mpur may be considered as respectively 34 and 30, Hariharpur as 25, Mahauli as 22, and Tilokpur as 47 miles distant across country.\n\nIn climate Basti somewhat resembles North Rohilkhand, which indeed lies in the same submontane tract. The characteristics of the weather in that tract are dampness, moderate heat, and partial immunity from the violent simooms and dust-storms which make summer hideous elsewhere. Here the dry west wind begins blowing in March, about the time of the vernal equinox. Towards the close of April it gives place to the prevailing breeze of the year\u2014that from the east; but may still be sometimes felt breathing faintly after midday, when the east wind often drops.\nSummer has now set in; the crops have been harvested; the fields are brown and bare. Owing, however, to the nearness of the Himalaya, and the slight depth of water from the surface, the temperature is probably less than in districts south of the Ghagra. In May cooling showers, known as \"the little rains,\" sometimes slake the heat, and the grateful scent of moist earth refreshes the nostrils. But the relief is only too fleeting; and the thermometer steadily rises till the end of June, when the crash of thunder heralds the descent of the regular rains.\n\nIn Basti these are far heavier than in the more western districts of the provinces. But the fall varies greatly from place to place, and in the two northern tahsilis is several inches heavier than in the three southern. The mean for the whole district and a series of years is about 43 inches yearly; but the following table gives ample details:\n\n| Months   | 1875 | 1876 | 1877 | 1878 | 1879 | Mean |\n|----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| January  | 0\u00b762 | 0\u00b748 | 3\u00b754 | 1\u00b728 | ...  | 1\u00b718 |\n| February | ...  | 0\u00b748 | ...  | 0\u00b774 | 0\u00b704 | 0\u00b749 |\n| March    | ...  | 0\u00b716 | 0\u00b754 | 0\u00b774 | ...  | 0\u00b713 |\n| April    | 0\u00b718 | 0\u00b760 | 0\u00b786 | 1\u00b716 | ...  | 0\u00b756 |\n| May      | 2\u00b788 | 0\u00b766 | 0\u00b784 | 2\u00b718 | 0\u00b766 | 1\u00b744 |\n| June     | 8\u00b744 | 2\u00b758 | 1\u00b786 | 1\u00b734 | 9\u00b720 | 4\u00b768 |\n| July     | 11\u00b712| 12\u00b724| 5\u00b768 | 7\u00b724 | 22\u00b778| 11\u00b781|\n| August   | 17\u00b782| 9\u00b798 | 2\u00b708 | 9\u00b724 | 13\u00b798| 10\u00b762|\n| September| 5\u00b746 | 9\u00b718 | 1\u00b768 | 14\u00b754| 11\u00b730| 8\u00b743 |\n| October  | ...  | 3\u00b710 | 4\u00b781 | 0\u00b710 | 9\u00b710 | 3\u00b743 |\n| November | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  | ...  |\n| December | 0\u00b716 | ...  | 1\u00b702 | ...  | 0\u00b726 | 0\u00b729 |\n\nTotal | 47\u00b716 | 38\u00b798 | 23\u00b790 | 38\u00b706 | 67\u00b732 | 43\u00b706\n\nThe yearly mean for the six years ending with June, 1872, seems to have been much heavier, amounting to 51\u00b74 inches.\n\nThe rains generally cease in the beginning of October; and with them their cloudy days and chromatic sunsets. But the dampness long continues. The drying of the waterlogged earth is a feverish and unhealthy process. Very seldom, and even then for a few days only, is felt the dry bracing cold which marks the winter of more western districts. In some parts of Basti, especially its eastern and northern parts, dense fogs obscure the morning; and at evening each village lies hidden under its own low pall of smoke. But at the beginning and close of the clearer days may be seen the snows of the great\n\n1 Kindly supplied by Mr. S. A. Hill, B. Sc., the Meteorological Reporter for these Provinces.\nWhite Mountain (Dhv\u00e1lagiri) and its lesser sisters, some 50 leagues distant on the north. In January, but never with any great punctuality, fall the slight winter rains; and somewhat later, in rare years, hailstorms make the farmer tremble for his rising spring crop. Buchanan mentions that in winter, when the west winds have blown strongly for some days, water is readily converted into ice. The conversion can, of course, take place only at the very witching hour of night or during the small hours which succeed it. Pit-ice, that is ice naturally frozen in pits, is at such times procured in districts which lie much farther south than Basti. But at Basti no pit-ice is made. Liquor is cooled with saltpetre, or by ice frozen in small private machines.\n\nThe following mean monthly thermometrical and barometrical readings for nearly three years were taken by Mr. Percy Wigram, then magistrate-collector of the district. The thermometer was in the shade; the barometer was a small aneroid, whose figures were taken at 10 a.m. daily. But this aneroid seems to have shown, as might be expected, considerable deviations from the mercurial instrument in the Gorakhpur observatory. And as the climatic conditions of Gorakhpur and Basti are much the same, the reader would do well to compare the thermometrical readings also with those already given for the former district:\n\n| Month    | Thermometer | Barometer |\n|----------|-------------|-----------|\n|          | Maximum     | Minimum   |           |\n|          | 870         | 1871      | 1872      | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 | 1870 | 1871 | 1872 |\n| January  | 75          | 75        | 71        | 45   | 42   | 17   | 29\u00b033 | 29\u00b019 | 29\u00b027 |\n| February | 81          | 81        | 77        | 49   | 49   | 56   | 29\u00b051 | 29\u00b026 | 29\u00b014 |\n| March    | 90          | 91        | 93        | 58   | 52   | 69   | 29\u00b041 | 29\u00b021 | 29\u00b000 |\n| April    | 97          | 99        | 99        | 65   | 66   | 67   | 29\u00b032 | 29\u00b008 | 29\u00b002 |\n| May      | 105         | 95        | 103       | 73   | 71   | 73   | 29\u00b006 | 28\u00b089 | 29\u00b092 |\n| June     | 98          | 94        | 99        | 78   | 77   | 78   | 28\u00b093 | 28\u00b080 | 28\u00b081 |\n| July     | 89          | 89        | 89        | 77   | 76   | 76   | 28\u00b085 | 28\u00b079 | 28\u00b075 |\n| August   | 89          | 88        | ...       | 75   | 76   | ...  | 28\u00b091 | 28\u00b084 | ...  |\n| September| 90          | 88        | ...       | 75   | 73   | ...  | 29\u00b002 | 28\u00b090 | ...  |\n| October  | 88          | 91        | ...       | 67   | 67   | ...  | 29\u00b012 | 29\u00b003 | ...  |\n| November | 82          | 84        | ...       | 52   | 56   | ...  | 29\u00b036 | 29\u00b015 | ...  |\n| December | 76          | 75        | ...       | 42   | 44   | ...  | 29\u00b043 | 29\u00b024 | ...  |\n\nThe thermometer of the Jail Hospital is examined twice daily, at sunrise and 1 p.m.; but the practice has hitherto been too spasmodic to afford results of value. Returns for five years are before us; but for two only, 1877 and 1879, are those returns complete in every month. The maximum temperature\n\n1 Supra, p. 313.\nof the former year, 101\u00b0, was registered in June; the minimum, 51\u00b0, in February. In 1879 the observations ranged from a maximum of 100\u00b0 in May to a minimum of 52\u00b0 in December.\n\nPART II.\n\nANIMAL, VEGETABLE, AND MINERAL PRODUCTS.\n\nTo any peculiarity of fauna Basti can lay no claim. Its beasts, birds, and fishes are all found elsewhere in the plains of the North-Western Provinces, and have all been named in the introduction to the fourth volume of this series.\u00b9 But a few local particulars regarding the more remarkable creatures may yet be profitably given. Let precedence be assigned to the domestic animals.\n\nA few elephants and camels are kept by the few who can afford to keep them; but for camels the climate is said to be too moist. Horses are seldom used and still more seldom bred. Those who want them must seek the fairs of Sonpur in S\u00e1ran, Dev\u00edpatan in Gonda, or even Batesar in Agra. But the ordinary country pony (tuttu) is common enough. On this rather fragile beast the landholder and the corn dealer take their lazy rides or lade their grain for market. Ponies cost from Rs. 7 to 25 each, and are extensively bred; but in more than one place they are sometimes found wild, the descendants of domesticated ancestors. Several specimens haunt unmolested the Gh\u00e1gra basin in Eastern and Western Chhapra of parganah Mahauli. A few again may be seen on the banks of the Tehri watercourse, which from a lagoon in Oudh flows to join the Gh\u00e1gra near Belwa. When captured such wild animals sell for about Rs. 20 each; but they are reported to be rather vicious than otherwise.\n\nOf horned cattle there are no purely local breeds. But \"Mahauli for bullocks or men\" (Mahauli k\u00e1 bard y\u00e1 mard) is a proverbial boast of that parganah. The Mahauli bullocks are rather below the average size of those elsewhere used for agricultural purposes, but are specially sturdy and muscular.\n\nTheir price and that of agricultural bullocks generally may be said to range from Rs. 15 to 40 the pair. A rather better class of animal is employed to carry grain sacks or other burdens; but the best class of all is that kept for purposes of draught by landholders. Whether the breed of cattle has really deteriorated with decreasing pasturage\n\n\u00b9 Gazetteer IV., pp. VI. et seq.\nis doubtful. In 1812, when the grazing-grounds were still ample, the collector reports that there are \"no cattle in the district fit to draw a treasure tumbril.\" Bullocks are fed on chaff, bran, and the straw of various cereals. When well-fed a single animal may cost as much as 3 annas daily. Ordinary cows vary in price from Rs. 5 to 20 each; but the best yields perhaps not much more than 2lbs. of milk a day. The clarified butter (gh\u012b) made from that milk is reserved, as a rule, for medicinal or ceremonial purposes. A few wild kine are found on the banks of the Ku\u00e1na, where that river bounds Domari\u00e1ganj; but the herds which formerly haunted tappa Atr\u00e1wal of Maghar have disappeared with the clearance of the forest.\n\nMale buffaloes, which are little used except as beasts of burden, fetch from Rs. 5 to 15 each; but females, on the other hand, sell from Rs. 9 to 35. The reason of their greater value is their milk, from which are made the curds and clarified butter in ordinary use. R\u00e1jputs and Ah\u00edrs are the principal owners of buffaloes; but goats and sheep are kept by the lower castes alone, Ah\u00edrs, Garariyas, Cham\u00e1rs, Khatiks and Jul\u00e1has. Goats are bought by butchers or slaughtered at Hindu sacrifices. They are valued, however, chiefly on account of their skins, from which are constructed drums (dhol, t\u00e1sa) and other articles. Whilst a she-goat is worth Re. 1 and a he-goat Re. 1\u00bd, a good goatskin sells from Re. 1 to Rs. 2. Of the castes last-named the Garariyas, as their name shows, devote themselves chiefly to the breeding of sheep. The price of these animals has within the last few years risen from Re. 1 to Rs. 2 per head. They are not generally used as an article of food, and themselves therefore obtain no food but grass. Their use is to supply the peasantry with skins, wool, and manure. The skins are sold by butchers to shoemakers at the rate of Rs. 20 to 25 the hundred. Of the wool are made blankets. Between S\u00e1wan (July-August) and K\u00e1rttik (October-November) sheep are allowed to wander about such fields as are reserved for the next spring crop; and in consideration of the manuring thus obtained their owners receive a small payment in kind. Government in 1863 attempted to improve the stock by the importation of two fine rams from Hiss\u00e1r; but one died next year, and the progeny of the other never survived their lambhood. Numerous cattle of all sorts are yearly driven into the Nep\u00e1lse Tar\u00e1i for pasture. Departing about Aghan (November-December), they return in Jeth (May-June) or As\u00e1rh (June July).\n\n1 Letter in Board's records, Jany. 31st, 1812. 2 In India milk is measured by weight. 3 Garariya or Gadariya is derived from Hindi g\u00e1dar, a sheep.\nIn the summer months rinderpest is often epidemic. It bears the same name (m\u00e1ta) as human small-pox, to which the natives deem it analogous. It is highly contagious and very fatal, the rate of mortality amounting to about 80 per cent. of the cattle attacked. The most prominent symptoms are loss of appetite, constipation of the bowels, excessive thirst, quick respiration, grinding of teeth, and great heat of skin. To these in a day or two succeed profuse mucous discharge from mouth and nostrils, inflammation of mouth and gums, purging, great prostration, and eruptions which from groin and udder extend over the whole body. Foot and mouth disease (kh\u00e1ng) appears also in summer, but not in sufficient force to be deemed epidemic. The same remark applies likewise to diarrhoea.\n\nThe district is no longer rich in large game. Tigers, leopards, and bears are now unknown. But in Buchanan's time the first named beasts molested the police of Dhuliy\u00e1b\u00e1n\u1e0dar\u00b9 and had lately been numerous around Lautan. The following is a list of the more important wild mammals, both common and uncommon:\u2014Wolf, jackal, fox, boar, buffalo (arna, Bubalus arni), blue-bull (n\u00edfga\u00e9, Portax pictus), hyena, spotted-deer (ch\u00ed\u1e6dal, Axis mivulatus), antelope, cat (banbil\u00e1r, Felis chaus), porcupine, fox, hare, monkeys of kinds (lang\u00far, Presbytis entellus; bandar, Inuus rhesus), mongoose (uowal, Herpestes Malaccensis), otter, and porpoise (s\u00fans, Platanista Gangetica). But some of these are seen very rarely indeed. The wild buffalo, for instance, can only be regarded as a visitor who sometimes loses his way from the Nep\u00e1lese Tar\u00e1i. Much the same may be said of the spotted deer; but wild-pig, the antelope and the blue-bull, wolves and jackals, are common. The wolves are especially numerous in the m\u00e1njha, the tract of tall thick grass along the banks of the Gh\u00e1gra. For the slaughter of a female wolf Government offers Rs. 5; for that of a male wolf, Rs. 4; and for that of a male or female cub, annas 8. But, although an occasional attempt is made to pass off the cub of a jackal for that of a wolf, wolves are seldom killed. The jackal is said to suffer from hydrophobia which he sometimes communicates to men. The people imagine that the disease lies dormant until the first thunder after the victim has been bitten, and then makes its appearance. They also distinguish a species of jackal called murdakhor, or corpse-eater, who preys on Muhammadan corpses; but such ghoul-like repasts are, when obtainable, relished by all jackals. Another quaint superstition was once entertained with regard to antelopes. In 1813, when those beasts were \"the pest of the country\" when\n\n\u00b9 Dhuliy\u00e1b\u00e1n\u1e0dar was a police jurisdiction lying between the Jamw\u00e1r and Til\u00e1r rivers. Part of it now lies in parganah B\u00e1nsi, while part has apparently been ceded to Nep\u00e1l.\nthe low-caste huntsman, with his poisoned arrows, might sight a thousand head a day, their multitude was thus explained: \"Formerly, the whole country being covered with long harsh grass swarming with muskitoes, the antelope bred only once in two years; but, since much has been cleared, and the number of muskitoes reduced, they breed every year.\" From the porpoise is extracted an oil which is medicinally applied to burns and bruises.\n\nLike wolves, reptiles are responsible for a good many deaths. In kindly supplying the following list of snakes Mr. Thomson makes occasional reference to the pages of Fayer's *Thanatophidia*: \u2014 Ajgar or python, atibaran, alhsar, andhawa, bas\u00e1o, bhamani, paniha, long paniha, chikor, dukla, dudhiya cobra (page 7), doma, dundha, dhusr, dh\u00e1min (page 66), karait, blue karait (page 11), kutkhor (page 55), ghor karait, kodaili, khutkat\u00e1i, soh\u00e1min, mihar, siy\u00e1r, majgidwa, ndgin (p. 6), sonkitar (p. 8), sugoa, sotiar, susk\u00e1r, and phitar. The paniha and chakor, although locally believed to be poisonous, are in reality harmless. So are the long-nosed crocodile (*Gharial*, *Gavialis Gangeticus*), and the turtle (*Kachhwa, Trionyx Gangeticus*), reptiles of other orders. But the ordinary crocodile (*n\u00e1k* or *nakra*, *Crocodilus biporcatus*) is a voracious and dangerous saurian.\n\nGhariyals are said to be commonest in the Ghagra, n\u00e1ks in the R\u00e1pti and the Bakhira lagoon; but both are more or less numerous in all the larger channels and sheets of water. The flesh of the n\u00e1k is sometimes eaten by fishermen, while his oil is used for medicinal purposes or burning. How he is captured may be shown by the following extract from the writer last quoted:\n\n\"The fishermen in pursuit of the crocodile look for him in shallow parts where some spots of the land project with channels of water running between. In such places they find the crocodile basking on the land. On the approach of the canoe he retires into the water, but goes only to a very little distance, and by paddling slowly on and carefully observing the motion of the weeds and air bubbles that escape from his lungs, they soon discover where he is. They then fix loosely, on the handle of a long paddle, a strong barbed harpoon iron, which is joined by a rope to the paddle, and putting the harpoon gently down, find where the animal is. He is very sluggish, and does not move when they touch his side, so that they draw up the instrument, and thrust it into his back without any dexterity. The animal flounces a good deal, but never attacks the canoe, which one stroke of his tail could instantly send to the bottom. He often, however, shakes out the harpoon, after which he neither seems to have an increase of ferocity nor shyness, but allows himself, as in the instance I saw, to be struck a second and a third time until he is secured and dragged on shore. He there flounces and snaps with his horrid jaws in a violent and dangerous manner, but, a large bamboo being thrust into his mouth, he bites with such violence that he cannot readily disengage his teeth, and gives the people time to secure the gag by tying a rope round his jaws. He is then helpless. In the one\n\n1 Eastern India, II, 503-504.  \n2 *Python molurus*, Linn Sometimes called rock-snake.  \n3 Supra, p. 816.\nwhich I saw caught a ball fired through his head from a small fowling-piece instantly deprived him of motion, nor did he show almost any sign of sensation when immediately afterwards the harpoon was torn from his back. On the whole the crocodile, seems to be a stupid animal, and to make but a poor resistance, considering his great power, and the tremendous force of tail, jaws, and teeth, with which he is provided. The hardness usually attributed to his skin will appear from the above account to have been very much exaggerated. I have seen the crocodile, however, move with very great velocity, and have no doubt that in the pursuit of fish it uses great exertions of this kind; nor does it seem to be entirely destitute of cunning, as crocodiles have been repeatedly found lurking in the fords of rivers through which high roads pass. Of this indeed I saw one instance, and am assured that it is not uncommon.\"\n\nThe average number of persons killed by wolves or reptiles during four recent years was 221.5 yearly, the figures being 158 in 1874, 263 in 1875, 226 in 1876, and 239 in 1878.\n\nIn an available native list of \"flying things (parinda)\" the only remarkable point is the classification. Birds and bats are grouped together, but winged insects are for some doubtless valid reason excluded. It is, however, amongst the birds alone that the Basti sportsman will find sufficient food for his powder. The wildfowl shooting on the Chandu, Chaur, Pathra, and Sikandarpur lagoons is uncommonly good, and on the Bakhira Tal may be called excellent. The Imperial Gazetteer mentions pochard, pintail, mallard, spot-bill, grey duck, grey goose, brown goose, bean goose, cotton teal, blue-winged teal, grebe, coots, and water hens as common. But these wild fowl are mostly birds of passage, descending from the Himalaya at the beginning of winter, and revisiting the cool hills as summer approaches. Snipe, too, are mere cold-weather tourists. Small game of other descriptions is as scarce as elsewhere in a country where cover is rare and preservation almost unknown. A few partridges, quails, ortolans or pigeons are all that could be got in a morning's shooting. Peacocks are encountered, but there is the usual prejudice against their destruction. Falcons and tiercelets of kinds are obtainable, but falconry is little practised. Buchanan gives the following brief account of fowling on the Bakhira tal:\n\n\"On dark nights a wide long net is stretched vertically between two canoes, with its lower edge turned up, so as to form a bag near the water. Other canoes go, and disturb the birds in distant parts of the lake, driving them towards the nets\u2014for several are usually placed in a row. Whole flocks are entangled at once, dropping into the bag; and are immediately secured by lowering the upper side of the net.\n\n\"The coot, which does not seem to differ from the kind that Mr. Latham calls common, is taken in broad day. It is a tame bird, and allows a canoe paddled slowly to approach near, and usually, to save the trouble of rising, which it does with difficulty, it dives to allow the canoe to pass. Three or four canoes therefore paddle towards a coot, and when it dives, stop\n\n1 The Sanitary Commissioner's report for 1877 leaves the Basti columns blank.\nover the place, the people looking round, until they see it rise, on which they immediately set up a shout. The bird terrified at this, dives again immediately, and remains until it is much exhausted, so that, when it rises, it is neither able to fly nor to dive immediately. The people indeed give it no time to recover, for, by carefully observing, they perceive some air bubbles escape from the poor animal, just before it rises, and are prepared to seize its head as it reaches the surface. Such haste is not however absolutely necessary, as one, which they caught in my presence, was not able to move for several minutes after it was taken into the canoe. When it had revived, I threw it into the lake; and with the utmost stupidity it immediately dived, and remained again below until quite exhausted, but, as we had removed to a distance, it recovered, and then took wing.\"\n\nIn birds and plumage the trade is insignificant. There are of course a few fowlers, belonging mostly to the Baheliya and Pasi castes. Netting is their favourite method of capture; and from netting, indeed, the latter tribe derives its name.\u00b9 The birds thus captured, chiefly waterfowl and pigeons, sell for from 9 pies to 1 anna each, and are eaten by both Hindus and Muslims. Pet birds from the hills, such as the chakor partridge and the mimicking black maina, are brought down from B\u00fatwal by the Nep\u00e1lese. The same merchants import also a small quantity of deer-horns and yaks' tails. A chakor can be bought for Re. 1, and a good maina for from Rs. 3 to 5. Other feathered pets, such as l\u00e1l\u00e9 and sham\u00e1ne,\u00b2 are procurable in the district itself. The l\u00e1l\u00e9s are sold for from Rs. 5 to 8 the hundred. Peacocks' feathers are sold for fans. A few fanciers from the great towns of Murshidabad, Patna and Sh\u00e1habad in Bengal visit the district to return with the gorgeous plumage of the \"blue-breast (nilkanth)\" and other birds.\n\nIn a watery district like Basti fish and fisheries are subjects of the liveliest and most general interest. Before the close of the rains the overflow of rivers has converted great tracts of country into one gigantic fish-pond. The piscium genus haunts the bush nota qua sedes juerat columb\u00eca. And the people take most successful precautions that as few as possible of the finny invaders shall retire with the retiring waters.\n\nAlmost all the fish mentioned in the Gorakhpur list\u00b3 appear also in that for Basti. The only three exceptions are the khuria, surji, and pengna, which in this district perhaps bear other names. Such aliases are certainly borne by the parni and patharchatar, which are here known as parhini\u2074 and patharjit. It is indeed the great variety of local names which renders the scientific identification of most species by any but the practised ichthyologist impossible. The nomenclature adopted by text-books, such as Captain Beavan's Fresh Water\n\n\u00b9 Sanskrit p\u0101sha, a net. \u00b2 Supra, p. 315. \u00b3 Sura, p. 318-20. \u2074 rQ parhini,\nFishes of India, often differs greatly from that of remote districts in the North-Western Provinces. In the following supplement to the Gorakhpur list all attempt at scientific terminology has been discarded:\u2014Argi, badhi, baigasa, bajjahi, bakahi, bhaglad, bilangra, bulla, chandsa, chengu, dhansahar, dhaur, dhawi, dhumi, durhi, hansi, janam, kandya, kawa, khaswa, khuntra, kojaitu, kutta, lapchi, mahas, makhui, malga, masadhar, parchallu, patasi, patra, phansi, photha or bhotaha, raho, saur, and simaya.\n\nThe phansi is so called because there is a ring or noose (phansi) on its neck. Of the masadhar\u2019s large scales small playing-cards (ganjifa) are sometimes made. Oil is extracted in small quantities from the rohu, bhakura, moi, and other fish; but it is merely made to meet the domestic requirements of the fishermen themselves, and no regular oil industry exists. The favourite time for the manufacture is the winter, when the fish are in the best condition. Small sun-dried or smoked fish are exported in a more or less putrescent state to Nep\u00e1l, where they sell from Rs. 2 to 3 per maund; and for a fresh fish the Nepalese are said to pay twice its weight in grain. In the district itself the price of the latter commodity varies from season to season; but, on the whole, may be quoted at from 1 to 2 annas per ser for the choicer, and from \u00bd to 1 anna for the coarser varieties. Except Bhagats, Sadhus, and others, who are prevented by their religious vows, all classes eat fish. But that food is the staple diet only of low Hindu castes, such as Beldars or Kahars, and of the fishermen themselves. The fishermen are chiefly Mallahs and Chuhis, tribes of boatmen; Khewats, Goria Kahars, and Turhas, classes of porters and labourers; and the Siwarias, who, as sellers of grass and wood, may perhaps be called lumberers. Fishing is not, however, confined to these castes. It is the subsidiary occupation of many others. Every cultivator follows more or less, according to his leisure and opportunities, the trade of St. Peter.\n\nThe methods of capture are most varied. Hardly any form of fishing known in other countries is unknown here. Even poisoning is practised, although practised rarely. A given part of a river or lagoon is enclosed in a framework of bambus, and within the enclosure are scattered pieces of wild fig-bark.\u00b9 This process has the effect of poisoning the fish, who one by one rise dead to the surface. Nets of all sizes and shapes are used. The mesh is often so small as hardly to admit of a finger passing through it. The destruction of small fry may, without exaggeration, therefore, be called vast. But of all creatures fish, perhaps, increase most greatly in excess of the means of subsistence. The three principal rivers of\n\n\u00b9 Elsewhere the bark of several other trees is employed for this purpose.\nthe district afford a comparatively secure and hitherto inexhaustible nursery. And it would be difficult to put in execution any restrictions as to the closeness of the nets used.\n\nThe larger nets are, as a rule, employed during the rainy season and the smaller after its conclusion. The g\u00e1nja, kowhel or karihil, jhinguri, and tapahu or t\u00e1pa have been described in the Gorakhpur notice.\u00b9 The ch\u00e1tur and bat\u00e1o resemble the t\u00e1pa, and the pelua the jhinguri. The seine is here named batwan. Three other nets, called g\u00e1ghi, kachua, and til, are sometimes used. The rod and line (haluka) or line simply (shisht) are familiar spectacles on the banks of rivers; but comparatively few fish are caught by these means. The principal fisheries are those of the great rivers and lagoons mentioned in part I.; and these are fished all the year round, without thought of a close season. But the bulk of the fishing is done in winter, on the smaller sheets of water left by the yearly rains.\n\nWhen the water is shallow and expected to dry up soon the process is simple. Across the orifices of the pool or rice-field are thrown mud dams (bandh). In the one exit left is fixed a grass or reed screen (patuka, chaundhi, or chilwania); so that while the water escapes, not a fish can escape with it. As that water subsides the work of destruction proceeds. First, the fish are taken in the extinguisher-like t\u00e1pa. Then, as the shallowness increases, men may be seen wading in all directions with cone-shaped baskets. Having thrust the wider ends down into the mud, they can remove at their leisure, through the smaller ends, any fish that have been thus imprisoned. When the water has almost disappeared, what little remains is baled out, and the fish are left flapping helpless in the mud.\n\nMuch the same system is adopted even on those lakes which never run dry. These are fed, as a rule, by a-flood channel from some river, and at the end of the monsoon that channel is embanked. The dispute which prevents the embankment of the Pathra T\u00e1l has been glanced at above. The fishermen of the neighbourhood bitterly complain that at the close of the rains the finest fish now return from the lake to the R\u00e1pti. But they can still afford to rent the piscatory rights for some Rs. 150 yearly. The r\u0101ja of B\u00e1nsi, one of the parties to the dispute just mentioned, duly embanks the outlet of his own preserve at B\u00e1nsi. His practice of netting a few fish only when required is an honourable exception to the rule which seeks to destroy yearly all the life in a lake.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 320.\nBut the various methods of fishing large sheets of water are most perfectly exemplified on the Bakhira T\u00e1l. In the outlets of the dam which embanks its escape channel are fixed screens which entangle many a fish. All round its edges may be seen t\u00e1pas, which are ready for use in its shallower parts whenever the cultivators find time to become fishermen. But the form of capture here most extensively adopted is spearing. The bottom is too weedy to be netted with much success, and the shore is in few places so clear as to admit of the drawing of a seine. But the water, being clear and nowhere very deep, is a very favourable field for the harpooner. The spear or harpoon (b\u00e1nsa) is an ordinary bambu staff, split into 15 or 20 pieces, each tipped with iron. These are again bound together, and the central piece being thickened by coils of string, the whole forms a bundle of spears some eight or ten inches in diameter. The harpooners are sufficiently expert to make almost certain of striking a fish some twelve or fifteen feet distant. The water is regularly beaten by a line of five or six canoes, each containing a spearman at the prow and a punter or paddler at the stern.\n\nBut enough has been said of the animal, and we pass to the vegetable kingdom. Though somewhat empirical, the division into trees and crops will serve our purpose sufficiently well. The following list shows the principal trees of the district:\n\nAgh\u00e1i (Dillenia pentagyna).\nAkol (Alangium Lamarckii).\nAm, mango (Mangifera Indica).\nAmr\u00fat, guava (Psidium guava).\nAn\u00f3nia (Phyllanthus emblica).\nArjun (Terminalia arjuna).\nAsidh (Lagerstroemia parviflora).\nAsna (Terminalia tomentosa).\nAsog (Suraca Indica).\nB\u00e1b\u00f3l (Acacia Arubica).\nBahera (Terminalia bellerica).\nBair, jujube (Zizyphus jujuba).\nWild do., jharberi (Zizyphus nummularia).\nBaisa (Salix tetrasperma).\nBakai (Melia azedarach).\nB\u00e1ns, bambu (Bambusa, several species).\nBar or bargad, banyan (Ficus Bengalensis).\nBarhal (Artocarpus lakoocha).\nBel (Aegle marmelos).\nBent, rattan (Calamus rotang).\nBhurk\u00far (Hymenodictyon excelsum).\nBhij\u00e1s\u00e1l (Pterocarpus marsupium).\nGani\u00e1r (Premna integrifolia).\nG\u00f3lar, wild fig (Ficus glomerata).\nHarra (Terminalia chebula).\nHarsingar (Nyctanthes arbortristis).\nImli, tamarind (Tamarindus Indica).\nJalt (Sesbania Egyptiaca).\nJamua or j\u00e1man (Eugenia jambolana).\nJhigana (Odina Wodier).\nKachla (Strechoc nux vomica).\nKachn\u00e1r (Bauhinia variegata).\nKalth (Feronia elephantum).\nRambhar (Gmelina arborea).\nKar\u00e1nj (Pongamia glabra).\nKarawunda (Carissa carandas).\nKarma (Stephogyne parviflora).\nKarri (Sarcopeplum tomentosum).\nKathal, jack fruit (Artocarpus integrifolia).\nKela, plantain (Musca sapientum).\nKhair (Acacia catechu).\nKh\u00e1ja (Briedelia retusa).\nKhaj\u00far, wild date (Phoenix sylvestris).\nK\u00fas\u00fam (Schleichera trijuga).\nLasora (Cordia myra).\nMod\u00e1r (Colotropis gigantea).\nMahua (Bassia latifolia).\nMainphal (Randia dumetorum).\nM\u00falsari (Mimusops Elengi).\nNim (Melia Indica).\nP\u00e1kar or plikhan (Picus cordifolia).\nP\u00e1nam or s\u00e1ndhan (Dalbergia Ougrimensis).\nP\u00e1ndar or p\u00e1dal (Stereopermum suaveo lens).\nPany\u00e1r (Barringtonia acutangula).\nPar\u00e1s or gh\u00e1k (Butea frondosa).\nPatju (Pteranjiwa Roxburghii).\nPind\u00e1r or pan\u00e1r (Randia aliginosa).\nP\u00edpal (Ficus religiosa).\nPiy\u00e1r (Buchanania laiffolia).\nRauna or rohna (Mallitus Philippinensis).\nAs already mentioned, the district is well and almost densely wooded with clumps of mango, bambu, and mahua. The flower of the last-named tree is eaten, or distilled into whiskey-like liquor; and from its seeds (koendi) is extracted an oil. Mahuas are common around the district capitals, and in a single tappa of Nagar are numbered at 10,000. The name of this tappa, Pipra, is derived from the sacred and ubiquitous p\u00edpal. In valuable timber trees Basti is less rich. Here, as elsewhere in unafforested India, a tree has little chance of surviving to maturity unless it is a fruit tree. The s\u00e1khus of the district are few and small. But it is not intended to repeat what has so often been said of these more familiar trees. In the Budaun, Bijnor, and Gorakhpur notices will be found quite enough matter concerning the appearance or uses of the mango, guava, aonla, asna, bab\u00fal, bakain, bambu, bel, barhal, ganni\u00e1r, g\u00falar, harra, tamarind, j\u00e1mun, kachn\u00e1r, jack-fruit, plantain, khair, jhigna or jh\u00edngan, wild date, k\u00fasam, mahua, n\u00edm, p\u00e1kar, p\u00e1nan, par\u00e1s, p\u00edpal, s\u00e1khu, semal, custard-apple, shisham, siras, palmyra, ebony, t\u00fan, and warga. The instant elimination of these well-known species will lighten the task of both writer and reader.\n\nThe agh\u00e1i has a hard wood not easily worked, but apt to warp and crack. Its leaves are used as plates and laid under grass thatching, while its buds and fruit are eaten. The timber of the akol, on the other hand, is readily manipulated; and though well adapted for more ornamental purposes, furnishes a material for the stilts of ploughs. The sweet but somewhat astringent fruit is edible, and the aromatic root is used in native medicine. Various medicinal uses, too, has the greenish-white bark of the arjun. Its wood is in some demand for fuel and coarser carpentry, but is difficult to work. The asidh, a biggish tree with ashy bark and white fragrant flower has a tough timber extensively used for rafters, furniture, and agricultural implements. It may be mentioned that of this material are sometimes made the shafts of European buggies. The sweet gum is eaten, while the bark and leaves are largely employed in tanning. The red or yellow flowers of the asog may be seen in gardens and near Hindu temples; but its timber, when used at all, is used as fuel.\nThe large *bahera* yields the common myrobalans used in dyeing. From its fruit are made ink and medicinal vinegar, and from the kernels thereof oil. Its wood furnishes scabbards, fishing floats, and other articles whose object is lightness rather than durability. The *jharberi* or wild jujube is here a mere bramble bush, used chiefly for hedging; but its leaves are eaten by cattle, while its rufous and bullet-like berries are in times of scarcity an important food for men. These berries are probably identical with the famous fruit of the Lotos-eaters.\u00b9 The *baisa* is a kind of willow which grows in watery places and supplies a firewood. Like other willows it has romantic associations. As Majn\u00fan and Laila were famous oriental lovers, and as the weeping willow is called after the former, the baisa sometimes bears the name of the latter. The thorny *bent* or rattan is found in small brakes along the edges of shallow streams. The wood of the *bhurk\u00far* is used for boxes, toys, scabbards, and the stocks of firelocks; its bark as a febrifuge and in tanning; and its leaf as cattle fodder. In Basti the timber of the *bij\u00e1s\u00e1l* or \"bastard teak\" is more familiar than the tree itself. The scantlings here used are small, and are worked up into drums, furniture, and other pieces of carpentry. The *harsing\u00e1r* is a large shrub or small tree which derives its generic name (*nyctanthes*) from the fact that its fragrant flowers, like evening primroses, open at nightfall to drop at sunrise. From these flowers is sometimes extracted a fine but transient buff or orange cloth-dye; the leaves may be used in polishing wood; but the timber of the tree itself is used only as fuel.\n\nThe *jait* is a soft-wooded tree of short stature and short duration. It is chiefly useful as a source of firewood; but rope can be made of its bark and cattle-fodder of its leaves. It is said that when a widow of low caste is remarried, this tree sometimes represents her in the marriage ceremony. The bridegroom, that is, goes through the form of being wedded to the tree. The *kachla* is a small evergreen with smooth ash-coloured bark and berries which in colour and size resemble oranges. In the bark, and to a greater extent in the seeds of the berries, is found a small quantity of the frightful poisons strychnine and Brucine (the latter familiar to readers of *Monte Cristo*). The wood of the *kaith* is used in a great\n\n\u00b9 Herodotus IV., quoted in Sir H. Elliot's Supplemental Glossary.\nvariety of carpentry and as fuel. The acid pulp of its fruit furnishes the people with a kind of jelly or pickle. The bark is medicinal, and the gum contributes with that of other trees to supply the East Indian gum-arabic of commerce.\n\nKambh\u00e1r. The fruit, root and bark of the kambh\u00e1r are used in native medicine. Its wood is highly esteemed for its durability under water; but furnishes also a material for furniture, drums, toys and all kinds of ornamental work. The pods (karanj kal\u00e1n) of the karanj are familiar to native druggists, but it may be doubted whether the tree itself is at all familiar to other inhabitants of the district. The karaunda is a large evergreen shrub whose wood makes an excellent fuel. But it is cultivated on account of its fruit, which when half ripe is made into tarts, jellies, or pickles, and when wholly ripe is eaten raw.\n\nKarri. The yellow wood of the karri furnishes good rafters, but is apt to crack in seasoning. The leaves can be used as fodder for cattle.\n\nKh\u00e1ja. So can those of the kh\u00e1ja, which affords good timber to the carpenter and builder, an astrigent bark to the tanner, and a sweetish fruit to the peasant. Though used for roofing, planks, and boxes, the wood of the karma is not very durable. Than the white-bloomed lasora few trees could be more variously useful. Its soft timber here serves chiefly as fuel; but can be worked into gun-stocks, well-curbs, and agricultural implements. Of its bark may be made ropes; and with the fibre of that bark boats are sometimes caulked. The leaves are used as plates, and in Pegu as the covering leaf of the Burma cheroots. The fruit is edible, and when young is often pickled. The viscid pulp thereof serves as birdlime, and the juice supplies a transient marking for cotton goods. A large shrub with thick branches, growing in dry places, the mad\u00e1r supplies from its juice a medicinal drug and from its inner bark a strong silky flax. The latter was formerly woven into fine cloth, but is now the material of bowstrings, fishing-lines, and nets. The wood of the mainphal is used for agricultural tools, fences, and fuel. Its bark and fruit are medicinal; and when unripe the latter is sometimes roasted for eating. The leaves are given as food to cattle. The maulsari is a large evergreen tree which is cultivated chiefly on account of its white, star-shaped and fragrant flowers. Its fruit is eaten, from its seeds is expressed oil, and its bark is used medicinally. But its timber is almost worthless.\nThe wood of the *p\u00e1ndar* is burnt and makes excellent charcoal; but when large enough can be used also in building. The root and bark find their place in the native pharmacopoeia.\n\nThe *pany\u00e1r* grows in moist places, such as the edges of swamps; and hence perhaps its name (*p\u00e1n\u00ed*, water). Though used elsewhere for various kinds of carpentry, the wood is here good enough for fuel only. The *patju* is a middle-sized evergreen tree whose nuts are strung into rosaries and the amulet necklaces of children. From this latter use it derived its original name of *putranjiva*, or \"child's life.\" The wood of the *pind\u00e1r* or *paniha* is burnt, and its fruit cooked for eating. The kernels (*chiraunji*) of the *piy\u00e1r*\u2019s fruit are edible, and taste something like pistachio nuts. From them is extracted oil. The bark of the tree is used in tanning, while its leaves are a substitute for platters.\n\nOf the *rauna* also the bark is not unknown to the tanner. But the most important product of this large shrub is the powder which covers the ripe fruit (*kamala*). Used in dyeing silk, this is also a purgative and anthelmintic. But the rauna has other medicinal qualities. Its leaves and fruit are applied externally with honey against the bite of poisonous animals. The seeds, too, are elsewhere sold as drugs; but the wood is of service only as fuel. The castor-oil plant or Palma Christi is a small soft-wooded tree cultivated in and around villages on account of its oleaginous virtues. Of other virtues it has none. Teaks are sparsely planted in gardens for the sake rather of ornament than of timber; and none indeed of those planted is as yet large enough to furnish valuable scantlings. The *sainjna* is sometimes called \"the horse-radish tree,\" because Europeans use the bark of its root as a substitute for horse-radish. But the tree is cultivated mainly on account of its pods, which are eaten as vegetables or pickled; its flowers and leaves are also considered edible. The latter and the twigs are lopped for cattle-fodder; but the wood is fit only for the fire.\n\nAnd here it may be mentioned that the average price of wood fuel, when cut and stacked for use, is from Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 per 100 maunds. The timbers chiefly used in construction, mahua, j\u00e1man, and mango, fetch when sold in the log about eight annas the oubic foot; and when hewn into scantlings, from 12 annas to Re. 1. Mahua trees sell for from Rs. 7 to Rs. 15 each, j\u00e1man trees from Rs. 3 to\nRs. 10, and mango trees from Rs. 5 to Rs. 10. But the woods of all three are much liable to decay through the dampness of the climate and the ravages of the so-called white ants. It is therefore to be regretted that the more durable s\u00e1l timber is so rare and so expensive. The Chitia forest in tahsil B\u00e1nsi is, perhaps, the only spot where good s\u00e1l logs may be locally procured. Such timber is usually brought when required from Gorakhpur or Bahr\u00e1m-gh\u00e1t of Oudh. A tree of moderate size sells for from Rs. 20 to Rs. 25; but s\u00e1l wood is most often bought in beams (silli), or in blocks (latta) containing four beams each. These beams and blocks are not, however, definite measures; their dimensions vary, and with those dimensions the prices of beams vary from Rs. 5 to Rs. 20, and of blocks from Rs. 20 to Rs. 80. When hewn and sold by the cubic foot, s\u00e1l timber fetches from Rs. 3\u00bd to Rs. 4. Large bambus may be bought for Rs. 20, and small for from Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 the hundred.\n\nFor further information regarding the trees mentioned in the above list the reader is referred to Dr. Brandis' Forest Flora of North-West and Central India.\u00b9 We must now quit the grove for the field.

Priority has been assigned to the autumn crops, because here, as elsewhere, the agricultural year begins on the 1st of July. By that time the rains have usually fallen, the earth awakes from its long summer sleep, and the operations of tillage are renewed with vigour. For the autumn harvest are tilled some three-quarters of the arable area north of the R\u00e1pti; but south of that river the proportion is reversed, and about the same fraction of the total cultivation devoted to the spring harvest.\n\nThough the above are the principal crops of the district, there are many minor growths which have probably fallen under the miscellaneous headings. Such are hemp (san or sanei, *Cannabis sativa*), patwa or patsan (*Hibiscus cannabinus*), the millets kodon (*Paspalum frumentaceum*), marua (*Eleusine coracana*), saw\u00e1n (*Oplismenus colonus*), k\u00e1kun (*Panicum Italicum*), and chen (*Panicum miliaceum*), the pulses urd or m\u00e1sh (*Phaseolus radiatus*), moth (*Phaseolus aconitifolius*), and mung (*Phaseolus mungo*), m\u00fanj grass (*Saccharum munja*), and til or sesamum, called in South Indian reports jingelly (*Sesamum orientale*). These are all products of the autumn harvest. The minor growths of spring are oats (*jai*, *Avena sativa*), linseed (*tisi* or *alsi*, *Linum usitatissimum*), mustard (*l\u00e1hi*, *r\u00e1i*, or *sarson*, *Brassica campestris*), mas\u00far pulse or lentils (*Ervum lens*), safflower (*kus\u00fam*, *Carthamus*).\ntinctorius), and vegetables. All the ordinary English vegetables can be raised in winter; and to them we must add several plants grown at other seasons, such as ginger, melons, and gourds of kinds, coriander, pepper, betel-leaf, turmeric, cowach, and aniseed (ajwain).\n\nBut we can here spare space only for a few details concerning the most important crop. Rice is the staple growth of the autumnal harvest, and the autumnal is, as already mentioned, the staple harvest of the north of the district. Rice is therefore the staple crop of the north of the district; but it is also, from the surpassing area which it occupies, the staple crop of the district at large. Here, as in Gorakhpur, dh\u00e1n may be divided into three broad classes: (1) the coarse early rice named ausani or Bhadui; (2) the finer late rice called jarhan or Aghani; and (3) the comparatively scarce summer rice styled boro.\n\nAusani or Bhadui derives its first name from the Sanskrit root \u0101sh, to eat;\u00b9 its second from the fact that it sometimes occupies the ground until Bh\u00e1don (August-September). Its varieties are many; but the difference is in many cases so slight that only the practised eye of the rice-grower himself can detect it. The following list is long enough, but does not pretend to be exhaustive:\u2014Anjanawa, parhni, parhni-surkh, saraya, m\u00fatri, jh\u00e1li, madansanki, katauncha, baguri, parbh\u00e1ya, mahiya, s\u00e1thi, sokan, ganjkaisar, b\u00e1nsph\u00fal, kap\u00farch\u00edni, ph\u00falgend, regan, gandsi, kundiya, jei or j\u00e1su, n\u00e1hu, narh, gaigaur, s\u00e1tha, tabreni, sonkharcha, unniy\u00e1n, dudhi, regan-j\u00e1su, bedi, nibua, banki, rankajra, and kesar. Of these varieties the best and most familiar are perhaps the b\u00e1nsph\u00fal, kap\u00farch\u00edni, and sokan. Little need be added to the description above\u00b2 given of the manner in which the Bhadui crop is cultivated. The first ploughings seem, however, to take place in February-March, a month later than in Gorakhpur. Towards the close of March they are suspended, the season being deemed unlucky. The crop is here sown chiefly on uplands not subject to inundation. The time of sowing is June-July, and the weight of seed sown about 40 local ser\u00b3 to the acre. When the weather is wet and likely to continue so, when it is feared that the seed may be chilled and killed by the unusual moisture, that seed is often sown a day or two after germination. To make it germinate it is first steeped in water for twenty-four hours and afterwards placed in a heap covered with grass and blankets. Except when the usual rains fail, no irrigation is required after sowing. But of late years\n\n\u00b9 Fallon's Hindust\u00e1ni-English Dictionary, art \"\u0101\u015ba.\"\n\u00b2 Page 322.\n\u00b3 The local ser equiposes 100 of the copper coins known as Gorakhpuri pice.\none or two weedings have always been considered necessary.\\footnote{\u201cWeeding,\u201d writes Mr. Pepp\u00e9, \u201cuntil a few years ago was never thought of. But now, unless the fields are well weeded, the grass comes up and chokes the dh\u00e9m.\u201d} The crop is generally reaped in September-October, the average outturn being about 16 m\u00e1nis, or 6\u00b74 maunds per acre. Mr. Thomson estimates the cost of production at Rs. 6 per acre including rent; Mr. Pepp\u00e9 places it as high as Rs. 9, leaving a profit of Re. 1 to the cultivator. But it has been already\\footnote{Page 332.} shown how complicated is the problem of forming such estimates.\n\nThe later Jarhan or Aghani rice is so called because it is reaped in the winter (j\u00e1ra) month of November-December (Aghan). The following are some of its often scarcely distinguishable varieties: Baharni, mircha, satdiya, gogh\u00e1i, parjatta, mott\u00e1s\u00e1yar, k\u00fasmi, r\u00e1nth, karangi, mah\u00e1jogin, mohanbhog, gola, amma, god, sug\u00e1panki, kaitra, hansr\u00e1j, desi, parjatti, l\u00fadra, r\u00fadwa, r\u00e1m bhog, ketaki, r\u00e1s, harbil\u00e1s, pel\u00edn, l\u00e1ngi, pauwa, Barhmaha, r\u00e1tgol, gauriya, \u00e1nandi, changendwa, r\u00e1n\u00ed-k\u00e1-jar, latera, madh\u00fakar, gurdih, r\u00e1jh\u00e1ns, mot\u00edch\u00e1r, kanakstra, m\u00e1lda, r\u00e1mjawain, dosan, bh\u00e1tin, bagulb\u00e1hin, ritiya, bilamr, mans\u00e1r, barwi, panya and t\u00edni. Of these the most highly esteemed are the latera, mot\u00edch\u00e1r, and Barhmaha or Burmese varieties. Like Bhadui, jarhan is usually sown in June-July; but, unlike Bhadui, it is usually sown on the loamy lowlands surrounding villages (goenr doras). From its original field it is commonly transplanted as described in the Gorakhpur notice\\footnote{Page 323.}; and the places selected for its final home are the flooded hollows called d\u00e1bar or soi. Plants which cover but one acre in the nursery will cover six in the field of transplantation. The quantity of seed sown and the average produce per acre is much the same as that of Bhadui rice. But Mr. Pepp\u00e9 fixes the cost at Rs. 9\u00bd and the profit at Rs. 3. Aghani rice is sometimes attacked by the kapt\u00ed caterpillar and sometimes by a disease called toti, which prevents it from flowering.\n\nThe boro or summer rice is planted in February-March along the edges of lagoons or ponds. In such moist retreats it can scorn the daily increasing ardour of the sun, and presents a fringe of lovely green when the surrounding fields have become a bleak brown playground for the hot-winds. It is reaped in May-June. The largest expanse of boro rice may be seen around the edge of the Bakhira T\u00e1l. The mill or mortar in which rices of all kinds are husked is called akhui, and corresponds to the okhli of other districts.\nA sufficient account of those remaining crops, which are important by reason of their great area or great value, has been given in the Bareilly and Gorakhpur notices. Such are jo\u00e1r, wheat, barley, peas, sugarcane, indigo, and opium. According to Mr. Thomson the crop last named is the only one whose cultivation may be considered to have increased largely of late years. Its tillage has attained the widest development in parganah Amorha. The increase here and elsewhere is in no small measure due to the money advances which the Imperial Government grants to those who agree to plant poppy. The progress of tillage under British rule, before the separation (1865) of this district from Gorakhpur, has been elsewhere noted.\n\nThe average outturn per acre of rice, with the average cost and profit per acre of its cultivation, has been shown above. Some statistics supplied by the tahsildars enable us to give, for whatever they may be worth, similar figures for the other principal crops. The results may best be thrown into a tabular form, thus:\n\n| Crop                  | Total outturn per acre in maunds | Total cost of cultivation per acre in rupees | Net profit per acre in rupees |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                       | Maximum.                         | Minimum.                                   | Maximum.                      | Minimum.                     |\n|                       | Sers.                            | Rs. a. p.                                  | Rs. a. p.                     | Rs. a. p.                    |\n| Jo\u00e1r millet           | 13                               | 7                                          | 12 4 0                        | 6 2 0                        | 1 0 0                        | 5 13 6                        |\n| Arhar pulse           | 8                                | 5                                          | 8 14 0                        | 4 8 0                        | 3 10 0                        | 0 9 0                        |\n| Sugarcane             | 90                               | 10                                         | 34 12 0                       | 12 8 0                       | 22 13 0                      | 6 3 0                        |\n| Wheat                 | 113                              | 8                                          | 21 4 0                        | 9 11 0                       | 8 12 0                        | 0 10 3                       |\n| Barley                | 134                              | 7                                          | 14 8 0                        | 6 0 0                        | 6 12 0                        | 0 13 0                       |\n| Mixed wheat and barley| 16                               | 8                                          | 8 8 6                         | 8 0 0                        | 9 9 0                        | 1 5 0                        |\n| Gram                  | 8                                | 6                                          | 8 0 0                         | 5 4 0                        | 6 8 0                        | 0 10 0                       |\n| Peas white (matar) and purple (kirdo) | 8\u00bd                             | 7                                          | 9 0 6                         | 5 4 0                        | 7 8 0                        | 0 15 6                       |\n| Opium                 | \u00bd                                | f0                                         | 48 12 0                       | 10 13 6                      | 39 4 0                        | 3 11 0                       |\n| Tobacco               | 30                               | ...                                        | 14 0 0                        | ...                          | ...                          | ...                          |\n\nThe variations between the maxima and minima of the profit columns are in every case so great as to be viewed with suspicion. The profit returns of tahsil Khalfabad have in most cases indeed been excluded as excessive and untrustworthy. But the outturn statistics of tahsil Haraia, which are even more open to the same objection, have been altogether rejected. In the case of sugarcane it is not stated whether the outturn is in raw juice or in the\n\n---\n\n1 Gazr., V., 554-66; supra, pp. 324-29.\n2 Pp. 329-31.\nboiled syrup known as gur; but if we may judge by the analogy of other districts, the former is intended. The tobacco returns are for tahsil Khalilabad only. The statements from which these figures have been selected relate chiefly to the minor crops; but with these last we have not time to deal. We need prolong our prose georgic only to describe briefly a few of the more important agricultural processes and agricultural terms.\n\nPloughing is an almost perennial operation. It is perhaps interrupted only by the hot weather and by the ill-omened intervals which at the ends of March and September succeed the equinoxes. Even in the hot weather the land is often broken up by hoe (kudiri). The auspicious date for beginning these preparations for the autumn crop is the third of the moonlit half of April-May. But in June-July, when the first downpour of rain has loosed the baked earth, every plough may be seen at work. The implement here used (hal or har) differs slightly from all four of those already pictured in notices on D\u00fa\u00e1b districts. It is indeed a radical mistake to suppose that the same plough is used all over these provinces. The chief peculiarities of the Basti instrument seem to be that its boot or sole (khopi) is much lighter, and its share (ph\u00e1r) much longer, than those used in Farukhabad or Mainpuri. A rough diagram will, however, serve our purpose better than any description:\n\n1. The muthiya or handle. 2. The jangha or stilt. 3. The harris or beam. 4. The agwasi and pdhku, pegs fastening the beam to the stilt. 5. The ph\u00e1r or hare. 6. The harsudha or pachela, a bolt securing the share in its place. 7. The khopi or sole.\n\nThe share is of iron, but all the remaining component parts are wooden. The cost of the whole instrument is about Re. 1. The yoke or j\u00faa, which\n\n1 See Gaz., IV., 514 (Mainpuri), and VII., 38-39 (Farukhabad).\nsupports the beam on the necks of the oxen, is composed of just as many pieces.\n\nIt may be thus shown:\n\n1. The *kandwar* or yoke proper, which rests on the bullock's shoulders.\n2. The *tarmichi* or lower piece.\n3. The two *pachas*, which join 1 and 2 and divide the necks of the bullocks.\n4. The two *sails* or outer pins, keeping the yoke straight on those necks.\n5. The *khura* or prominent knob round which 6, the thong (*medha*), is looped. This latter secures the yoke to the beam of the plough.\n6. The two *jothas* or thongs which fasten the yoke to the bullocks.\n\nThe two last are of leather and all the rest of wood. A complete yoke may be bought for from 4 to 6 annas. The ploughing apparatus here described is, according to Mr. Wynne, \"of the most miserably insufficient character, though probably a more efficient instrument could not be drawn by the weak ill-fed bullocks employed.\"\n\nWhether for the autumn or the spring harvest, every field is ploughed at least once in each direction. If the land, for instance, is first ploughed north and south, it will afterwards be ploughed east and west. Such double or cross-ploughing is called *samra*. Fallow fields prepared for wheat or poppy receive 8 samras; those devoted to sugarcane, 6; barley-fields which have already borne an autumn crop, 5; and rice-fields the same. A preliminary ploughing for the purpose of breaking up the clods is called *gorna*; and a last ploughing, for the purpose of weeding out the grass, *sohua*. The usual time of ploughing is from early morning to noon; but it is not uncommon arrangement to plough for three hours in the morning and three in the evening, with a rest at midday. A man possessing but a single pair of plough-bullocks is called an \"immature cultivator\" (*kacha kashikar*). The \"mature cultivator\" (*paka kashikar*), who has two pairs, can with ease plough a local *bigha*, or 1,775 square yards, daily. It is probable that in ancient Basti, as all over the Old World, the unit of land measurement was the vague and varying area which could be tilled within the year by a two-bullock plough. In some parts of Rasulpur and Banshi the rent is still assessed on the plough, and not on the bigha or acre. It is a reasonable inference that the plough-holding was once just as well recognized a measure of surface as either of the two latter standards.\nPlough measurements are still common in the wilder parts of Mirzapur. We have evidence that till the first half of the seventeenth century they were universal in the Dakhshan. The laws of the Manavas show that they once prevailed in Northern India. Examples of their occurrence in Europe are afforded by the old English carucate and perhaps by the old English hide. The plough-holding of Horatius Cocles, as mentioned by Livy, is perhaps not quite a case in point; for he received not as much as two oxen could plough within the year, but as much as they could plough within the day.\n\nAfter ploughing irrigation is perhaps the most important agricultural process. For the crops of the rainy autumn no irrigation is, except in years of drought, required; but for those of the spring harvest it is needed everywhere. As already noted, no canals supply water to the fields of the district; but an ample stock of that element is procurable from numerous streams, lagoons, reservoirs, and wells. From the first three sources the water is lifted by sling-baskets, as described in the Gorakhpur notice. When shaped like a boat such baskets are called dogala or beri; when shaped like a round shield, don or donri. The ropes or strings by which the basket is swung are termed dori, and the small wooden instrument used in opening and shutting the apertures of the water channels hitha. In his Eastern India Buchanan calculated that a \"gang of ten men, working two pairs of baskets, could irrigate some 4,727 square yards, or just under one acre, daily. Whether this estimate includes the men standing in the fields and distributing the water is uncertain. But Mr. Wynne reckoned that with eight labourers to lift and two to distribute, one paka bigha of 3,973 yards could be watered in the day. Though, as we shall hereafter see, the most expensive, this is the most common and popular method of irrigation. The people believe that the water thus raised contains a fertilizing sediment.\n\nWells are worked by exactly the same methods as those described in the Budaun notice. Water being near the surface, the commonest arrangement is the lever and pot. But the small winch-wheel (charhhi), with a pot at either end of its rope, is also familiar. The rarest method is that of the bullocks and leathern bucket (pur or moth). Part I. of this notice has already\n\n---\n\n1 See the compiler's note on the assessment of pargana Dudhi, p. 46. Supra, pp. 340-41.\n2 Gazr., V, 30-31.\n3 The terminology of the lever-well apparatus is as follows:\u2014The lever is called dhentul; the upright support or fulcrum on which it works, thamba; the peg which hinges the first into the second, patla; the rope, bart; the earthen pot, kund; and the little hollow dug for the reception of the water when first emptied beside the well, ghula. From the ghula the water finds its way into the fields by little earth-built cannels.\n4 This method of drawing water seems, however confined to certain limited portions of the three southern tahsils. Of the 21,019 wells in the district, only 149 are worked on the charhhi principle.\nshown what, in various parganahs, is the distance from the mouth to the water of the well.\n\nA masonry (paka) well usually costs from Rs. 100 to Rs. 130; but a great deal of this expenditure is purely unnecessary. It includes the marriage (jalotsang) of the well to an image; and this ceremony may eat up from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50 and more. When the wooden frame (jammat) of the well is deposited in its place, the carpenter throws over it a sheet. Into this the members of the founder's brotherhood cast from 2 pice to 1 rupee each, according to their means and liberality. The sum squandered by a leading landlord would hardly fall short of Rs. 200. \"On account of its expense,\" writes Mr. Wynne, \"the ceremony is often delayed one or two years, during which time the family of the builder will make no use of the water.\" About Rs. 20 are spent in providing the village Br\u0101hmans with food, money, and raiment. Similar offerings to the workmen employed may of course be considered as wages. But the 100 or 150 men collected and despatched for the work by the proprietors of surrounding villages do not deem that work one for which wages may be rightly demanded. The construction of a masonry well is a holy deed; the porridge, coarse sugar, and spirits given to the labourers are regarded in the light rather of a marriage feast than of remuneration. The cost of providing fuel for burning the bricks rarely falls upon the founder; for to assist him in his good work his neighbours collect wood. His expenses are further reduced by the fact that for the top courses of the masonry mortar is rarely used. A good masonry well, sunk through firm clay soil, lasts for about a century. Its area of irrigation varies from 10 to 20 acres, but is generally nearer the latter than the former.\n\nA masonry well is often built partly of fire-burnt and partly of sun-dried bricks. In this case it is called kacha-paka, and may cost as little as from Rs. 50 to Rs. 30 only. It should last for 10 or 20 years according to the nature of the soil: for a shorter period in sandy, and a longer in clayey earth. But the great majority of wells are mere cylindrical excavations (chonra) unsupported by bricks of any kind. These may be dug for small sums descending as low as Rs. 5 or even Rs. 2. They water from 3 to 5 acres, and endure usually for some eight months only. The rains too often reduce them into mere crater-shaped depressions.\n\nThe average cost of watering by sling-basket may be fixed at Re. 1\u00bd per acre. Well irrigation with one pair of bullocks and one bucket costs about 10 annas. But in the rare cases\nwhere more than two buckets are used a well ceases to be the cheapest kind of waterer. The cost per acre of working two buckets is Re. 1\u00bd; but three will raise the expenditure to Re. 1\u00bd, and four to Rs. 2\u00bd. It will be remembered, however, that these are averages. The cost varies of course according to the number of waterings which the crop demands. Barley, peas, and the minor spring crops are often watered only once, though generally twice; wheat always twice and sometimes oftener; poppy from three to five times; and sugarcane as often as eight. The first watering of the spring crop is called patik.\n\nThe available statistics touching the area under irrigation are not of the most convincing kind. According to the provincial answers to the Famine Commission (1878), about 600,000 acres, or 48 per cent. of the total cultivated area, are irrigable; while about 380,000 acres, or 28 per cent., are actually watered. But these figures must be received with some caution. The area, 164,000 acres, which they represent as watered for the autumn harvest, seems altogether exorbitant; and irrigation from other sources being commonest,\u00b9 that from wells should hardly have been credited with 254,000 acres. But the settlement reports, which return the watered as exceeding the unwatered area in every parganah except B\u00e1usi and Bin\u00e1yakpur, are perhaps even less satisfactory. If correct, they prove that at the beginning (about 1860) of the assessment term now current, irrigated and unirrigated cultivation measured 762,079 and 333,822 acres respectively. But they serve also to show that since the beginning (about 1840) of the last assessment-term irrigation had greatly increased. In the five parganahs,\u00b2 whose statistics for the earlier period existed, it had extended by 35,806 acres. Several causes which formerly impeded its more rapid extension have been recounted in the Gorakhpur notice.\u00b3 Irrigation details for separate parganahs will be found in the parganah articles at the end of this notice.\n\nFrom irrigation we pass to the less savoury subject of manuring. In Basti, as elsewhere in the fertile sub-Himalayan belt of the provinces, this process is comparatively rare. The principal source of manure is the muck-heap; but human excreta and the stalks or other refuse of plants may be mentioned as minor fertilizing agencies. The muck-heap accumulated just outside their premises by every family of cultivators contains about 5 tons of miscellaneous refuse. In it the droppings of cattle form a very small ingredient; for, except during the rains, when they cannot be dried, they are almost always burnt. It has been ascertained that elsewhere,\n\n\u00b9 So writes Mr. Thomson.\n\u00b2 Ras\u00e1ipur, B\u00e1usi, Nagar, Basti, and Mahauli.\n\u00b3 Supra, p. 339.\nin the neighbourhood of large towns, far more can be realized from the sale of such droppings as fuel than from the increase of produce which would result from their application to the land. Here, however, there is little doubt that firing could be more cheaply procured from the neighbouring forests and the numerous decayed mango trees. \"But as this,\" writes Mr. Wynne \"would involve the necessity of a little enterprise on the part of some, and a little cash expenditure on the part of all, it is considered better that the population should content themselves with the home-made article.\" But though the dung of cattle is burnt, its manuring virtues are not completely lost in the process. The ashes are added to the muck-heap, and some portion of the ammoniac vapours given out in burning must afterwards descend on the soil. When the weather is too wet for the preparation of fuel cakes, a fair amount of droppings find their way to the muck-heap. But when used as manure they are not used, as in European countries, with any admixture of straw. For straw and grass are generally burnt. No litter is generally placed in stables and cattle-pens, because it attracts snakes and insects. In this warm land, moreover, its fermentation is perhaps injurious to the feet and the general health of the cattle. But owing to its absence, all the liquid manure of those cattle is lost.\n\nThe second kind of manure is, like both others, almost monopolized by the fields which immediately surround the village homestead. These are fertilized by the villagers themselves, who in rural India perform certain necessary functions al fresco. In Basti and Gorakhpur, where villages have more than the usual number of outlying hamlets, manure of this sort is of course more evenly distributed than elsewhere.\n\nManuring with the leaves and stalks of plants is comparatively rare. Grain-parchers descend on the fields like locusts, removing all the leaves which will serve as fuel for their ovens. Elsewhere, indigo leaves are largely applied to the indigo crop; but in Basti the indigo crop, always a rarity, is now completely extinct. The stalks of all the commoner crops are used as fodder, roofing, or firing. About 15 inches of the stubble in jarhan rice fields is left uncut, with the view of its rotting or being burnt on the field. But the field is seldom enriched in either way. The cattle usually enter and browse down every stalk.\n\nSuch are the manures of the district. The small available quantity of the first and third kinds is often claimed for his home farm by the landlord, and surrendered by all but the better and more independent class of tenants. Manure is never bought; and the only cost incurred in manuring is that of\ncarriage. This, however, is slight, for the only fields manured as a rule are those which being nearest the village are known as goend. On these, indeed, are grown all the more paying crops, all the crops which the peasant finds best worth manuring. Such are the wheat, poppy, and vegetables grown for the spring harvest, and the sugarcane which occupies the ground throughout the year. Barley is seldom manured, and the autumn crops never. One of the tahsildars thus estimates the cost per acre of manuring the different manured crops:\u2014 For wheat and poppy, to which are devoted 96 maunds of manure, Rs. 1\u00bd; for vegetables (192 maunds), Rs. 3; and for sugarcane (160 maunds), Rs. 2\u00bd. Though intended probably to show averages, the estimate seems to err on the side of excess. If, however, it related only to sandy soils, it might not perhaps be deemed exorbitant. It goes without saying that such soils require more heavy manuring than loams or clays. The fields are manured in the months of September, October and November only. The manure then bestowed is considered sufficient for the whole year.\n\nThe minor agricultural processes may be passed over very briefly.\n\nOther agricultural After being ploughed the field is sometimes harrowed or processes. rather smoothed by a heavy board which the plough bullocks drag across it. This implement, which in up-country districts is called patela, here bears the name of henga; and the ropes which attach it to the yoke are known as barha or bardri. Weeding (nirdona) is usually practised twice during the growth of the crop, the spud or scraper employed being called khurpi. Throwing a field into fallow (banjar dalna) for any length of time is uncommon. The only case in which it ordinarily happens is that of a rice field wherein for the next spring harvest but one it is intended to sow wheat. As autumn returns such fields are left unoccupied, and called palih\u00e1r. The general name for other land tilled during autumn in preparation for a spring crop is chaumad. So far indeed from fallowing being common, it is lamentably rare, and overcropping is a vice which in some places seriously threatens the productiveness of the soil. After remarking in 1864 that the crops of Basti are still markedly superior to those of neighbouring districts, Mr. Wynne continues: \u201cYet under the ruinous system of overcropping now practised the land must deteriorate, unless improved methods of ploughing, improved farmyard economy, an improved breed of cattle, and a scientific rotation of crops are speedily introduced.\u201d\n\n1 See above, section on Soils. 2 i.e. in Kufr and Kartik. 3 The reason being that they are fallowed or tilled without bearing a crop during the four months (chau mds) of the rainy season.\nTo the last clause of this sentence a partial answer may be found in the fact that with the principles of rotation the people are not wholly unacquainted. Arhar pulse is followed in successive seasons first by barley or wheat, afterwards by a rice crop, and ultimately by gram, peas, mixed wheat and barley, or linseed. Rarely, indeed, are two \"white crops\" grown successively. Leguminous growths are interposed. The burden of such notoriously exhaustive plants as sugarcane, poppy, and arhar, is never thrown twice running on the same land. When after the reaping of the early rice the soil remains suitably moist, peas, lentils, gram or linseed will be sown. But only when that soil has been well and vigorously tilled will the rice crop be followed by sugar or wheat. Wheat is itself sometimes grown year after year in the same field. But it must be remembered that the field lies fallow during the autumn, and that in the long interval between the two crops it is well manured. When it is at length found that the powers of the land have been overtaxed, it is sometimes allowed to lie fallow for a year or so. A year before it is again sown, its clods are broken (lahua m\u00e1rna). This happens in August-September. In January-February the ground is once more stirred, this time with a hoe; and in the following June-July it is sown with an autumn crop. The same plan is pursued when cultivation annexes virgin soil, or when old waste is reclaimed.\n\nFields bear different names according to the crops and harvests for which they are successively tilled. Those prepared for the spring harvest are either palih\u00e1r, takr\u00e1r, or okh\u00e1on. Palih\u00e1r lands have been already explained as those which, hitherto reserved for an autumn crop like rice, are during some autumn left fallow and carefully prepared for spring wheat. The wheat is sometimes followed by sugarcane. Takr\u00e1r fields are rice lands which after the reaping of their rice are ploughed and manured to bear, for the spring harvest immediately following, a crop of gram, barley, mixed barley and pulses, mixed barley and wheat, or lentils. An okh\u00e1on field is one ploughed in August-September, manured in the following month, and sown with vegetables, poppy, or tobacco. Fields prepared for the autumn harvest may be either mair, janewa, or maghar. A mair field is one which after long lying fallow is broken up in August-September and dug again in January-February or May-June. In June-July it is carefully cleared of grass, manured, and sown with a rice crop. Janewa lands, which have already borne a spring crop within the year, are sown with an autumn crop in June-July; and maghar fields are those which, having borne rice during the preceding\nseason, are in the same month ploughed, hoed, and weeded for a fresh rice-crop.\n\nCrops, too, bear different names at different stages of their growth. Before their germination, while still imprisoned in the seed, they are known as l\u00eda. The husked rice grain (akun) which has been steeped in water to cause germination, is called jharai. Transplanted rice is during its seedling stage termed bihan; when it has grown to some height, dahi; and when at its full stature, fael. All cereals and millets, when the grain becomes distinguishable in the ear, are called ekonta; and when nearly ripe, reonra. Ears of barley and wheat are when half ripe styled r\u00fani. Pod-grains whose flower has fallen and pod has formed bear the name of dudha. When the crop is half ripe it is termed gudra or gudri.\n\nMost of the implements which constitute the cultivator's stock-in-trade have now been named. Of those remaining to be mentioned, the most important are the pharaha or mattock; the paina or ox-goad; the hasua or sickle; the gar\u00e1si or chopper; the nachtar or instrument for scraping the opium off the incised poppy-heads; the tabu or rope-muzzle for the oxen who tread out the corn; the p\u00e1ncha or rake for collecting the grain on the threshing-floor; and the ord and khincha, baskets. But enough has been written of agriculture. Pass we then to the vegetable products of the wilderness and the water.\n\nIn a district where forest has been so extensively cleared as in Basti, what are generally known as the \"minor forest products\" are of course rare. Chief amongst them are the flowers, fruits, leaves, gum and bark of several trees above enumerated. Such are the aonla, \u00e1sidh, bab\u00fal, bahera, bambu, wild date, harra, wild jujube, kha\u00edr, mahua, mainphal, par\u00e1s, and piy\u00e1r. The rattan cane is sparsely encountered in moist places. Twigs (kusraut) are collected for fuel. Several long grasses are used either for the same purpose or for thatching, matting screens, basketwork, and rope. It will here suffice to mention the species known as khar, bankas (Spodiopogon angustifolium), and k\u00e1s, with the flag-like n\u00e1r. Thatching with grass rolls 3 inches thick costs about Re. 1 per hundred square feet; and, on the whole, tiling is a cheaper form of roofing. Amongst forest products that are not vegetable let us note honey and lac. Wild honeycombs are occasionally found in trees, whence they are detached by Bhars, Musahars, and other men of low degree. The same classes collect a trifling quantity of lac, sometimes paying a small cess to the landlord from whose trees that commodity is gathered. In places the lac insect (Coccus lacca) is regarded less as a boon than as a nuisance. It afflicts the Br\u00e1hmans\nby frequenting and not unfrequently killing their favourite pipal. \"The remedy,\" writes Buchanan, \"to which these wiseacres have recourse is to cut a branch on which the insect has fixed, to carry it to Pray\u00e1g (Allahabad) and to throw it into the sacred stream. On this all the insects on the tree perish.\" Though a good deal of tusar silk is used in the district, and though \u00e1sna trees on which to rear the silkworm (Antheraea paphia) which produces it are common, sericulture is unknown.\n\nAmongst the products of lagoons and ponds the principal are the seeds (makh\u00e1na) of the water-lily, wild-rice (tin, tina or tinni), and the water-nut or water-caltrop. The seeds of the water-lily (Anneslea spinosa?) are fried and eaten. The wild-rice, which at the end of the rains springs up along the edges of the shallow water, corresponds apparently to the pasai of Rohilkhand. When its grains ripen they drop off into the wisps of grass with which the rice-heads are tied together. But it is in places the custom to sling round the neck of the gatherer a narrow canoe-shaped basket, about three feet long, which as he advances whisks under the ears and collects the falling seed. By a convenient fiction, which denies that this wild-rice is a grain, Hindus permit themselves to eat it on fast-days. The water-nut, being widely and systematically planted, deserves a wider and more systematic description.\n\nThe various species of the trupa or water-nut are, or have been, a familiar food in many parts of Europe and Asia. Quoting the authority of Pliny, Captain J. F. Pogson affirms that the European species natans supplied bread to the ancient Thracians. It is said that specimens of the same variety have been found in a very perfect state of preservation amongst the old lake-dwellings of Switzerland. But in southern Europe such nuts are still ground into meal. They are known in France as water-chestnuts (marron d'eau), and at Venice as Jesuit's nuts. In China the \"ling\" or trapa bicornis is an important article of diet. But we are now dealing with the Indian species, biapinosa, which Captain Pogson considers far superior to the Chinese. The husks of both Chinese and Indian species are provided with two horns or spines, from which they derive their specific names. It may be added that the vernacular title of the Indian variety is derived from a word (sing) meaning horn. This variety seems to be most widely cultivated in Kashmir, where, for great part of the year, it supplies the bulk of the population with a regularly-eaten food. Here it is planted chiefly by Kah\u00e1rs, in their character of boatmen and fishermen;\n\n1 In a paper read before the Agri-Horticultural Society of Calcutta, 1878.\nbut the K\u00e1ndu Bharbhunjas\u00b9 also engage in its cultivation. The time of planting is the earlier half of the rains. Before the end of that season, when the nuts ripen, many a tank is one great floating bed of singh\u00e1ra leaves. The nuts are eatable either raw or cooked, and remain eatable till the end of November. If dried in the sun they will continue edible for years. They can, however, be ground down into a material for sweetmeats, porridge and bannocks (chap\u00e1ti). Captain Pogson is for having the water-nut planted largely by Government on the great Southern Indian tanks and elsewhere. But its fine roots are accused of accumulating mud, and of thereby reducing the depth and value of the reservoirs which bear it. If, moreover, the crop were more nutritious or remunerative, it would be more generally grown by the people themselves. They can well gauge the comparative merits of staples wherewith their fathers were familiar.\n\nFrom cultivation we pass, as usual, to the droughts which have checked its progress. Some account of those which preceded the separation (1865) of this district from Gorakhpur will be found above.\u00b2 We need here deal only with those of 1868-69, 1873-74, and 1877-78.\n\nThe visitation of 1868-69 deserves no harsher title than that of a scarcity. No relief-works for famished paupers were needed; no poorhouses for the old or weak were opened; no land-tax was remitted or even suspended. Mr. Henvey is right in saying that from the famine of that year \u201cBasti escaped almost entirely.\u201d\u00b3 The monsoon broke tardily though regularly in the middle of July; but after a few days of rain there succeeded an interval of drought which lasted till near the middle of September. The long absence of moisture had meanwhile wrought considerable damage. In the trans-R\u00e1pti part of the district it was reckoned that three-sixteenths\u2074 of the rice had perished. But eight-sixteenths were still flourishing, and the remaining five-sixteenths were reported as recoverable in the event of opportune rain. South of the R\u00e1pti half of the same crop had been lost; but here, as already shown, rice and other autumn growths supply some quarter only of the whole yearly outturn. To save their rice the people utilized the lift-irrigation which in most years is reserved for the spring crop. But after brief storms in September the rain again ceased. By the beginning of November and in the north of the district half the rice-crop, both ausani\n\n\u00b9 Sherring\u2019s Castes and Tribes of Benares (1872), p. 303; and infra, B\u0101ris and Bharbhunjas.\n\u00b2 Pp. 342-44.\n\u00b3 Narrative of the drought and famine in the North-Western Provinces, 1868-70, p. 59.\n\u2074 The rupee containing 16 annas; it is common in Indian reports to imitate the native practice and reckon fractions in sixteenths.\nand *jarhani*, had failed. But the minor autumn growths had yielded a fair return, and the rising spring grains looked promising. In the south of the district little or nothing had been lost since September. The autumn millets had returned a fair harvest, and the prospects of the spring crop were good, notwithstanding the want of water. The lagoons and ponds had been almost emptied to save the rice-crop. In the south-western corner of the district the agriculturists manfully supplied the deficiency by the construction of cheap earthen wells. But in the south-eastern corner, where the soil is sandy, the evil was not so easily remedied.\n\nThe results at the close of the autumn harvest were that while about three-fourths of the ansani or early rice had been realized, a still larger fraction of the jarhani or later crop had been lost. But sufficient grain to serve for seed was in most cases garnered; and the stalks of the wizened crops did duty as fodder for cattle. The spring crop had in most places received its first or *patik* watering. Its appearance was so hopeful that there was no fatal rise in prices. The market was well stocked with grain. There arose no complaints of distress. No emigration took place. Had Government imprudently opened relief-works, the cultivators might have been withdrawn from the spring cultivation, which demanded all their labour, all their care.\n\nSome winter rain in January, 1869 still further improved the outlook. In February it was anticipated that while the outturn of arhar pulse and sugar-cane would be normal, that of wheat, barley, and peas would be some four or six-sixteenths below the average. Of gram a half crop only was expected; and the expectation was justified, for gram suffered severely. But in March, when the spring crop was garnered, it was found that the harvest was not more than 25 per cent. below par. An eighth only of the land usually tilled in spring had been left untilled that year. Prices, which had been somewhat enhanced by the exportation of grain to less favoured western districts, fell. By April they had regained their usual standard. All anxiety was quelled.\n\nIn 1873-74 Basti became the western outskirt of the tract affected by the great Bengal famine. This and the neighbouring Gorakhpur were the only North-Western districts which that hungry year smote with any approach to severity. In climate and agricultural conditions their northern tahsils closely resemble the Lower Provinces. In both rice is the staple crop. And in spite of the contradictory clamour which at the time arose from irresponsible quarters, the Bengal famine of 1873-74 was mainly a rice-famine.\n\n1 *Vide supra* sections on rice.\nThe rains of 1873 began a fortnight later and ended somewhat earlier than usual. While they fell, they fell with less than the average heaviness. At their close the lagoons and other reservoirs of the north-R\u00e1pti parganahs were found almost empty. An extensive failure of the later rice was deemed inevitable, and the result justified the expectation. The scanty spring crops of this tract would at best prove a slender staff of life; but even these were unpromising. The twice-cropped fields, on which a vernal crop should have succeeded the rice, were little better than earthenware. The winter rains, which make all the difference between a good and a bad spring harvest, held off. The advances, offered by Government for the construction of wells, offered but a partial remedy. In mid-January a frost of uncommon severity nipped the arhar and other tender pulse-crops. But in the first week of February the long-delayed rain fell in moderately heavy showers. At about the same time the exportation of grain to Bengal ceased and prices became less inflated. The starvation which seemed imminent was averted, and in its place was threatened mere hunger. The spring cereals could not, however, be hoped to supply the whole population with food. The fasting poor were invited to labour on road embankments and other public works of a kind which did not demand skilled labour. In March the average daily number of persons thus relieved reached 2,200. The Collector was now authorised to propose, where needful, remissions or suspensions of revenue. In order to meet betimes the demands of the autumn cultivation, advances for the purchase of rice-seed were directed. The seed was procured from Nep\u00e1l; but of the sanctioned Rs. 5,00,000, Rs. 43,209 only were disbursed.\n\nDistress reached its highest point early in April, 1874, when the daily muster on the relief-works averaged 28,000. As the harvesting of the spring crops began, as the real deficiency of the outturn became clear, prices once more rose. But a harvest there was; though grain was dear, the depleted market was replenished; and by the end of April dearth was held to be declining. The numbers employed on relief-works continued, nevertheless, to increase; and at the time just noted reached 84,000. Were the labour and discipline sufficient to exclude mere idlers in search of light work and cash wages; The question was decided when the Lieutenant-Governor (Sir John Strachey) visited the Benares province.\n\nHis inquiries resulted in the conclusion that there was no distress so severe as to deserve the name of famine. Hosts flocked to the relief-works, not so much because they were hungry as because they there found pleasant employment at a season when agricultural labour is always at a standstill. The\nattraction consisted \"in the light work, in the liberty of going at night to their houses after attending a sort of vast picnic during the day, and in the wages earned at a time when ordinarily they had no employment in the fields and had to live on their harvest savings.\" It was found that the labourers were buying not only necessaries but luxuries. Orders were therefore passed that a larger tale of work should be exacted, while the wages should be reduced to the lowest sum needed for subsistence. The rates hitherto paid had been for a man $1\\frac{1}{6}$ anna, for a woman $\\frac{4}{5}$, and for a child $\\frac{3}{5}$. Men's wages were now reduced to one anna, and those of the younger children to $\\frac{1}{3}$th.\n\nIt was in the following month (May) foreseen that with the downpour of the rains some change of system would be needed. The congregation of vast multitudes at an unhealthy season and on outdoor work was for sanitary reasons impossible. There were issued, therefore, the following prospective rules:\u2014First, that able-bodied persons of the labouring class should be employed on bona fide public works, at the usual rates of pay; second, that for such persons of the same class as were incapable of hard labour easy employment should be found on roads or in poorhouses; third, that for those altogether incapable of labour gratuitous relief should be provided; and fourth, that those who on account of caste or other prejudices refused to accept relief on the above terms should receive exceptional treatment. The poorhouses were to be worked on the principles that relief should be given as a rule in the shape of cooked food, and given only to those in actual want; that everyone should work who could; and that working paupers should remain the whole day within the walls. These preliminaries settled, warning was given that the existing relief-works would be closed. And poorhouses were opened at Bansi and Basti.\n\nThis was the beginning of the end. The labourers on the relief-works continued indeed to increase, and in the last week of May numbered 127,000 daily. But in the same week fell showers; early in June the regular rains set in; and all apprehensions of further dearth vanished. By the end of the month last named the last relief-work was closed. The bulk of the able-bodied paupers returned to till their fields. The poorhouses for the old and infirm, which had opened with an attendance of about 800, sheltered in August about 1,800 inmates. But in September the number fell to 1,200, and at the beginning of October to 550. On the 21st of the latter month all poorhouses were closed. The State expenditure on relief-works for the able-bodied had by this time amounted to about Rs. 4,28,560. The expenses of poorhouses and other\n\n1Administration Report, N.W. P., 1873-74.\ninstitutions for infirm paupers were deemed the fitting object of private charity. They amounted to Rs. 9,640. But of this sum Government also, in contributing to the Central Charitable Relief Fund, had contributed its share.\n\nThe next and last dearth, that of 1877-78, may be called a famine. Whether many of its victims died of actual starvation is perhaps doubtful; but directly or indirectly it considerably raised the death-rate. A comparison of the mortality during five corresponding months of the affected year and its predecessor will at once put this fact beyond question:\n\n| Deaths in |\n|-----------|\n| November | December | January | February | March |\n| 1876 | 1877 | 1876 | 1877 | 1877 | 1878 | 1877 | 1878 |\n| 2,385 | 2,762 | 2,514 | 4,894 | 1,984 | 6,911 | 1,792 | 5,639 | 4,207 | 4,413 |\n\nThe story of the calamity opens in the usual way. Not much more than a fifth of the usual rain fell during the monsoon of 1877. While the average fall from June to September inclusive had for five years been 51.9 inches, it was this year 11.3 only. Again, the northern rice-crop almost completely failed. The minor autumn grains yielded but a fourth of their usual outturn. The prices of food climbed high. During the last three months of the year the condition of the poorer classes was considered critical. On the 22nd October a poorhouse was opened at Basti; and in January, 1878, similar establishments at Bansi and Menhdawal. The number of inmates was inconsiderable; but, before the end of the famine, relief operations had become far more extensive than in the whole remainder of the Benares division.\n\nTill the end of February distress continued to increase. For some five weeks from the 19th of that month work for a few able-bodied paupers was provided on the Basti and Menhdawal road. Meanwhile, however, the harvesting of the spring crops had begun to give employment and bring in food. The outturn of wheat and barley was fair; but that of the inferior grains was much below the average. On the 21st March the poorhouses at Bansi and Menhdawal were closed. And here perhaps the famine might have been expected to cease. But the spring crops were after all insufficient to satisfy the wants of a district which had already lost, in rice, its principal means of subsistence. In May signs of unusual poverty and hunger appeared. People might be seen\n\n---\n\n1 1871-75 inclusive.\nwandering from village to village in search of employment and food. Some crossed the border for Nep\u00e1l and others for Gonda. On the 28th May and 8th June, respectively, relief-works were opened on the Rudhauli-B\u00e1nsi and B\u00e1nsi-Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t roads. Towards the end of the latter month distress reached its highest point.\n\nIn the beginning of July works on the Belwa dam were opened as a measure for the employment of all fully able-bodied persons requiring relief. But the number of people who patronised this new venture was small; and after a few days the Gh\u00e1gra, swollen by the fall of the rains, flooded out the few who had attended. The two works named towards the end of the last paragraph were fully manned until towards the close of September. On the 26th of that month employment on the Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t road was closed, for with good rains and the rising of the autumn crop suffering and prices had abated. By the 26th October, when the Rudhauli and B\u00e1nsi road-works were closed, the famine was over. But the Basti poorhouse remained open till as late as the 14th of March, 1879.\n\n\"The extent of the distress,\" writes Mr. C. A. Daniell,\u00b9 \"must be gauged by the number of recipients of relief in various forms. A few were foreigners from neighbouring districts, but their number amongst so many was inconsiderable. In the week ending 14th June the daily average was 28,982, or 1\u00b796 per cent. of the district population; in the week ending 21st June, 52,886, or 3\u00b759 per cent.; in the nine days ending 30th June, 63,908, or 4\u00b727 per cent.; in the week ending 7th July, 46,243, or 3\u00b713 per cent.; in the week ending 14th July, 29,685, or 2\u00b701 per cent. Thence each week showed a decline. The 7th September showed 0\u00b798 per cent., and the 14th October 0\u00b719 per cent.\" It may be added that, of the principal grains and pulses, rice attained its maximum price (8 sers the rupee) in July, 1878; jodr millet (10\u00bd sers) in February of the same year wheat (10\u00bc sers) in October, 1877 and July, 1878; gram (10\u00be sers) in February, 1878; and barley (11\u00bd sers) in the preceding November. The total cost to the State of relief-works, poorhouses, and other famine measures was Rs. 1,50,350. In the case of poorhouses the Government grants were supplemented as usual by private subscriptions (Rs. 2,788). In more spontaneous charity a conspicuous lead was taken by the R\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi, who at stated times bestowed a regular dole of food on a certain number of paupers. Dearth as severe as that just described do not often afflict a district where water is so near the surface and river communication so good as in Basti.\n\n\u00b9 Then Officiating Commissioner of the Benares Division. See his No. 41, dated 16th March, 1879.\nAt times and places the excess of water is almost as mischievous as its want. In Part I. of this notice was said enough of inundation from rivers; but such inundation often works much mischief. Untimely rain is a fertile source of blight, whether of the reddish-yellow kind called rust (gar\u0101hi) or of the dirty-black kind called smut (\u0101dhu, d\u0101wa). When showers fall before December-January the wheat is almost sure to prove a grand success. But if they descend after that month, when the grain has filled out in the ears, more or less of blight is the consequence. By rain which falls too soon after November-December the poppy plant is said to be killed.\n\nBut the crops have also several insect foes. Such is the so-called white-ant (termites); such a worm named t\u0101ngra, which devours the roots of the rice. Of the t\u0101ba, the khaira, and the gandhi nothing is known except that the last attacks grain while in a state of milky unripeness. For all these pests the people can find no better cure than the incantations of Br\u0101hma\u1e47 priests (guru) or low-caste magicians (ojha). In days when four-footed marauders were still extensively mischievous, they adopted the more practical remedy of daily sprinkling their crops with an infusion of cowdung and water. Even the wild buffalo rejected green food thus treated. It is oddly enough stated that in those times neither wild elephants nor deer ever attacked pulses.\n\nIn poverty of minerals Basti resembles most other great alluvial plains. No building-stone is found within it. The nodular limestone named kankar is, however, quarried in several places. In most of these it is soft, clayey, and fitted less for road-metal than for the manufacture of lime. But along the banks of the Manar\u0101ma, in tappa Manarp\u0101ra of Nagar, it is found in hard and excellent knobs. The following varieties of kankar are locally recognized; but the distinctions between them are distinctions of colour rather than composition:\u2014Telia or dark; bichhua or scorpion-shaped; balua or dh\u016bsrehwa, so-called, because found in sandy or saline soil; sufed, dudhia or ch\u016bn, that is white, milky, or lime-coloured. The price of nodular limestone depends on its solidity, but for well-cleaned knobs amounts to about Re. 1-12-0 at the quarry. To this must be added from 8 to 12 annas for cartage. Mr. Thomson calculates that the cost of metalling with six inches of kankar the one metalled road of the district would be Rs. 1,426 a mile. But he allows to the metalling a width of 9 feet only.\n\nLime is made from kankar and shells. Burnt with ordinary refuse, kankar lime costs about Rs. 10 per hundred cubic feet; but with charcoal or firewood from Rs. 15 to Rs. 16.\nShell lime is prepared as a rule with the latter kinds of fuel. That of lacustrine shells (stip) is employed for the finer varieties of cement and fetches about Rs. 3 per maund. But that made from snail (ghonghi) and other shells costs about Re. 1 only; or if burnt with refuse, as little as 12 annas. The lacustrine shells are gathered by saltpetre-workers (Lunia) from the sides of streams and lagoons. The banks of the rivers Ami, Manar\u00e1ma, Ku\u00e1na and Raw\u00e1i, and of the Bakhira lake, may be mentioned as good localities for their collection. As a material for whitewash and other plasters they sell unburnt at from 5 to 8 annas the maund.\n\nBricks are manufactured by the potters (Kumh\u00e1r), who may be found in any village of average population. The sun-dried or kacha article is of two sizes, the larger called g\u00fama, and the smaller, g\u00fami. The former sells for about 2,000, and the latter for about 4,000 to the rupee. Kiln-baked or paka bricks made by native methods are of five different sizes, the g\u00fami, g\u00fama, adhgazi, lakhauri, and ilm\u00e1s-s\u00e1hi. The g\u00fami, measuring $9'' \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 5''$, costs when of the best quality Rs. 8 per mille; the g\u00fama, $12'' \\times 6'' \\times 3''$, Rs. 10; the adhgazi, $18'' \\times 6'' \\times 2''$, Rs. 20; the lakhauri, $4\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 3'' \\times 1''$, Rs. 100 per l\u00e1kh; and the ilm\u00e1s-s\u00e1hi, $5\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 4'' \\times 1''$, Rs. 115 per l\u00e1kh. The brick used by the Public Works Department measures $9'' \\times 4\\frac{1}{2}'' \\times 3''$. The price of its first class is from Rs. 6 to 9, of its second from Rs. 4 to Rs. 5 the thousand.\n\nThe wood burnt in the kiln is generally that of the mango, the tamarind, or the figs called bargad and p\u00e1kar. A kiln containing a l\u00e1kh of bricks would require about 2,000 maunds weight of firewood; 25 maunds, that is, for every 1,000 bricks. Brick-dust or surkhi, an ingredient in plaster and other builder's messes, is either ground from brickbats in a kind of circular mill (chakki) or burnt from kiln-earth. Prepared in the former manner it sells from Rs. 9 to 12 and even Rs. 16 per 100 cubic feet, according to quality. But when made of kiln-earth burnt with refuse, it has a price of Rs. 6 only.\n\nLike bricks, tiles are made by members of the potter caste. As shown in the Gorakhpur notice, flat tiles cost about double the price of round; while in the rains the price of all tiles rises to almost double its usual amount. But when 10'' long, kiln-burnt, and of the best quality, they may be said to fetch on the average Rs. 4 per mille. Tiling with such material costs about 8 annas per 100 square feet. The price of building\n\n1 A l\u00e1kh = 100,000. It is probably because sold in lots of that quantity that the brick is called lakhauri.\nwood has been shown under the heading of trees. And the road is now clear enough for passing to the most important and engrossing subject of this notice\u2014the people themselves.\n\nPART III.\n\nINHABITANTS, INSTITUTIONS AND HISTORY OF THE DISTRICT.\n\nThe first attempt to count the people of the district was made about 1818 by Buchanan. But the requisite agency and the requisite knowledge of census methods were wanting; and the attempt can be regarded only as a rather praiseworthy failure. Some account of Buchanan's calculations has been given above. Such of his figures as seem to refer to Basti are these:\n\n| Police circle | Area in square miles | Number of families |\n|---------------|----------------------|--------------------|\n| Sanichara     | 374                  | 17,182             |\n| Mahuadabar    | 2.2                  | 10,526             |\n| Khamaria      | 225                  | 20,195             |\n| Domariaganj   | 326                  | 16,901             |\n| Basti         | 208                  | 7,286              |\n| Maghar, part of | 240                | 7,560              |\n| Bakhra        | 46                   | 2,143              |\n| Banai         | 687                  | 19,854             |\n| Dhuliyanbandar| 130                  | 3                  |\n| Lautan, part of | 103               | 2,129              |\n| **Total**     | **2,551**            | **102,478**        |\n\nIf we assume that Buchanan's estimate is correct, and that the family includes about five persons, the total population would, just before the Nepalese war, have amounted to 512,300. His Sanichara corresponded pretty closely with pargana Mahauli; his Mahuadabar with parganah Nagar; and his Khamaria with parganah Amorha. Of Dhuliyan-bandar, a tract between the Jamwar and Til\u00e1r rivers, part now lies in Nep\u00e1l and part in parganah Bans\u00ed. The Mahuadabar which gave its name to the circle so called was destroyed during the Mutiny, and must not be confused with the Mahuadabar of parganah Basti. The four circles of Vazirganj, Nawabganj, Mankapur, and Lalganj, which Buchanan enters as parts of the Gorakhpur-Basti district, are now included in Gonda.\n\nA first regular census was taken in 1847. As, however, Basti then formed a portion of Gorakhpur, and as the great Maghar parganah has since then been divided between the two districts, the results can be shown but approximately. One-third of the\n\n1 Eastern India, Vol. II. 2 Pp. 345-46.\nMaghar population deducted, the inhabitants of the district numbered 987,771, or about 345 to the statute square mile.\\(^1\\) There were 823,733 Hind\u00fas, of whom but 194,537 followed occupations unconnected with agriculture. Out of 116,038 Musalm\u00e1ns 81,157 were engaged in cultivation. Of the 15,714 parishes (mauza) in the united district, about 7,382 must have belonged to the modern Basti. Of those in Basti, Birdpur\\(^2\\) alone is returned as possessing more than 5,000 inhabitants. But being a forest grant, Birdpur is a group of villages rather than a single village. The census of 1847 neglected to record separately the male and the female population.\n\nThe next, that of 1853, remedied this defect. It showed for the district as it now stands a total population of about 1,235,720.\n\nBut for the same reasons as in the last case the figure is merely approximate. The density of the inhabitants was 453 to the square mile. And those inhabitants were thus classified:\n\n|                | Agriculturists. | Non-agriculturists. | Total. |\n|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------|\n|                | Male.           | Female.             | Agriculturists. | Non-agriculturists. | Grand total. |\n| Hindus          | 428,401         | 385,484             | 808,885        | 254,982             | 1,063,867    |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns      | 59,724          | 56,316              | 116,040        | 55,813              | 171,853      |\n| Total           | 488,125         | 441,800             | 924,925        | 310,795             | 1,235,720    |\n\nIt will be seen that in six years the population had increased by 295,949 persons. The number of parishes may be reckoned at the same figure as before. But two only (Birdpur with 11,715 and Menhd\u00e1wal with 7,273) had more than 5,000 inhabitants.\n\nThe penultimate census, that of 1865, showed for the first time details as to castes and occupations, the proportion of children to adults, and other important statistics. The Basti figures were still unsevered from those of Gorakhpur; but after the same deduction as before, the population may be roughly returned as follows:\n\n|                | Agricultural. | Non-agricultural. | Grand total. |\n|----------------|---------------|-------------------|--------------|\n|                | Males.        | Females.          |              |\n| Adults.        | Boys.         | Adults.           | Girls.       | Total. |\n| Adults.        | Boys.         | Adults.           | Girls.       | Total. |\n| Hindus, Musalm\u00e1ns. | 392,359     | 306,325           | 277,999      | 166,782 | 946,065 | 81,870 | 56,154 | 76,906 | 49,410 | 264,340 | 1,210,405 |\n| Total.         | 338,348       | 239,119           | 223,348      | 195,421 | 1,097,287 | 99,302 | 68,610 | 95,422 | 59,271 | 322,605 | 1,419,842 |\n\n\\(^1\\) That is, a square mile of 640 acres. Unlike succeeding enumerations, the census of 1847 employs as its standard of area the larger geographical square mile (847.2 acres). \\(^2\\) In the report of 1847 the name is misprinted Tirpore.\nThe only town which in this district contained more than 5,000 inhabitants was Menhd\u00e1wal (7,349). But the Birdpur grant, with its population of 13,671, is again entered as a single parish.\n\nThe next and last enumeration was that of 1872. As the latest and most perfect yet obtained, its statistics deserve greater detail than those of its predecessors; and the following table shows the population for each parganah separately. By adding to the totals of that table 41 non-Asiatics (17 females) and three Native Christians (2 females), the census shows a gross result of 1,492,994 inhabitants.\n\n| Tahsil and parganah | Hindus | Muhammadans and others not Hindus | Total |\n|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------------|-------|\n|                     | Aged less than 15 | Adults | Aged less than 15 | Adults | Male | Female | Male | Female | Male | Female | Density per square mile |\n| Tahsil Domariaganj. |        |                                   |       |\n| Rasulpur            | 29,118 | 22,924                            | 36,048 | 36,185 | 8,706 | 68,71 | 11,278 | 10,971 | 87,150 | 76,951 | 495 |\n| Bans\u00ed West          | 16,484 | 13,234                            | 21,061 | 20,973 | 5,588 | 4,492 | 7,049  | 6,885  | 50,182 | 44,764 | 378 |\n| Tahsil Bans\u00ed.       |        |                                   |       |\n| Bans\u00ed East          | 50,901 | 40,841                            | 67,007 | 63,721 | 10,227 | 8,464 | 13,648 | 13,049 | 741,033 | 125,875 | 476 |\n| Binayakpur          | 4,177  | 3,251                             | 5,854  | 5,583  | 441   | 380   | 791    | 636    | 11,178 | 9,850  | 429 |\n| Tahsil Haraiya.     |        |                                   |       |\n| Amorha              | 36,955 | 27,678                            | 50,466 | 47,054 | 2,754 | 2,920 | 3,559  | 3,429  | 93,734 | 80,975 | 652 |\n| Nagar West          | 14,102 | 10,672                            | 18,427 | 17,845 | 1,129 | 948   | 1,529  | 1,458  | 35,187 | 30,928 | 585 |\n| Basti West          | 13,616 | 10,728                            | 17,463 | 16,904 | 1,346 | 1,061 | 1,653  | 1,597  | 34,077 | 30,390 | 670 |\n| Tahsil Basti.       |        |                                   |       |\n| Nagar Fast          | 1,149  | 8,904                             | 15,782 | 15,285 | 1,551 | 1,361 | 2,140  | 2,302  | 30,622 | 27,750 | 614 |\n| Basti East          | 20,252 | 15,949                            | 29,004 | 26,643 | 2,807 | 2,110 | 4,049  | 3,676  | 56,113 | 48,378 | 611 |\n| Mahauli West        | 17,835 | 14,164                            | 26,387 | 24,974 | 2,164 | 1,764 | 2,979  | 2,883  | 49,365 | 43,775 | 548 |\n| Maghar West         | 10,838 | 7,985                             | 16,339 | 14,444 | 1,980 | 1,556 | 2,586  | 2,579  | 30,758 | 26,564 | 521 |\n| Tahsil Khulibabad.  |        |                                   |       |\n| Mahauli East        | 22,948 | 16,958                            | 38,261 | 29,935 | 2,213 | 1,778 | 3,158  | 3,158  | 59,880 | 51,899 | 526 |\n| Maghar East         | 33,896 | 25,961                            | 47,580 | 44,025 | 10,024| 7,987 | 13,829 | 13,306 | 65,339 | 90,679 | 571 |\n| Total               | 270,868| 218,149                           | 384,879| 368,469| 50,930| 43,919| 68,170 | 65,773 | 784,647| 688,303| 528 |\nIn 1872, then, Hindu males numbered 655,547, or 52\u00b79 per cent. of the entire Hindu population; while the number of Hindu females was 581,618, or 47\u00b71 per cent. of that population. In the same manner the Musalm\u00e1n males amounted to 119,102, or 52\u00b70 per cent., and the Musalm\u00e1n females to 109,685, or 48\u00b70 per cent. of the total Musalm\u00e1n population. Or, taking the whole population, we find that there is a centesimal proportion of 53\u00b72 males to 46\u00b78 females and of 84\u00b77 Hind\u00fas to 15\u00b73 Musalm\u00e1ns. In spite of the suspected murder of girl babies amongst certain clans, the proportion of females is slightly greater than that (46\u00b77 per cent.) for the provinces at large. If the figures of this and of the two preceding censuses are to be trusted, from them may be obtained two important but perhaps fortuitous results. The first is that between 1853 and 1872 the proportion of males to females steadily though slightly increased; the second, that the Hind\u00fas increased only one-quarter as fast as the Musalm\u00e1ns. Whether either result is partly or wholly due to the practice of female infanticide amongst certain classes of Hind\u00fas must remain to be solved in some work of more speculative character. The calculations of the results themselves will be found in Mr. Tupp's Imperial Gazetteer of the district.\n\nIn 1872 some attempt was for the first time made to collect the statistics of bodily infirmities. These statistics tended to show the existence within the district of 67 insane persons and idiots (18 females), or 1\u00b794 per 10,000 of the population; 204 deaf and dumb (44 females), or 1\u00b74 per 10,000; 793 blind (206 females), or 5\u00b74 per 10,000; and 135 lepers (23 females), or 9\u00b72 per 10,000. The rate per myriad is in every case below the average for the provinces at large. Insanes and idiots are separately shown by the census, but have here been lumped together. It is impossible that half-educated enumerators could have distinguished between the two classes. What Buchanan wrote of the district lepers forty-five years ago is still partly true: \"Both kinds of leprosy are pretty common; and the korh or korhi, that in which the joints fall off, is said to be on the increase. The people here do not separate the diseased from their families; and some of them continue to live with their wives and beget children, who seldom escape the disease. The white leprosy would not appear to be hereditary, nor is it beheld with such abhorrence as the korh. It is commonly called sufeda and charakh.\" But it may be doubted whether, as in Buchanan's days, many black lepers commit suicide. The korh or black leprosy, he explains, is deemed the punishment of sin, and to expiate that sin \"some go to Ajudhya and more to Pray\u00e1g, and throw themselves into the holy stream; while others, to whom a distant journey would be inconvenient, throw themselves into a pit filled with fire.\"\nAt the same time as the statistics of infirmities were collected the statistics of age. These latter are, for what they may be worth, shown in the following table. But it must be repeated that Indian rustics rarely know their own ages:\n\n| Age          | Hind\u016bs | Musalmans | Total population |\n|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n|              | Males  | Percentage on total Hind\u016bs | Males  | Percentage on total Musalmans | Males  | Percentage on total population |\n|              | Females | Percentage on total Hind\u016bs | Females | Percentage on total Musalmans | Females | Percentage on total population |\n| Up to 1 year | 27,612 | 4\u00b71       | 24,007 | 4\u00b71       | 5,039 | 4\u00b72       | 4,859 | 4\u00b70       | 32,651 | 4\u00b71       | 28,866 | 4\u00b71       |\n| Between 1 & 6 years | 107,823 | 16\u00b71     | 96,143 | 16\u00b76     | 20,179 | 16\u00b79     | 18,496 | 17\u00b78     | 128,002 | 16\u00b73     | 114,639 | 16\u00b76     |\n| \" 6 & 12 \"   | 114,392 | 17\u00b71     | 80,171 | 13\u00b77     | 20,715 | 17\u00b73     | 14,966 | 14\u00b70     | 135,107 | 17\u00b79     | 95,137  | 15\u00b78     |\n| \" 12 & 20 \"  | 103,637 | 15\u00b75     | 69,108 | 11\u00b78     | 17,509 | 14\u00b77     | 12,769 | 11\u00b79     | 121,146 | 15\u00b76     | 81,877  | 11\u00b79     |\n| \" 20 & 30 \"  | 192,351 | 18\u00b73     | 118,588 | 20\u00b75    | 21,489 | 18\u00b70     | 21,622 | 20\u00b72     | 143,841 | 18\u00b73     | 141,210 | 20\u00b75     |\n| \" 30 & 40 \"  | 94,286 | 14\u00b71     | 90,655 | 15\u00b75     | 16,829 | 14\u00b71     | 15,928 | 14\u00b79     | 111,118 | 14\u00b71     | 106,584 | 15\u00b74     |\n| \" 40 & 50 \"  | 53,735 | 8\u00b70      | 51,272 | 8\u00b78      | 9,468 | 7\u00b79      | 9,148 | 8\u00b75      | 63,192 | 8\u00b70      | 60,421 | 8\u00b77      |\n| \" 50 & 60 \"  | 27,189 | 4\u00b70      | 30,650 | 5\u00b72      | 5,004 | 4\u00b72      | 6,663 | 5\u00b72      | 83,193 | 4\u00b71      | 36,113 | 5\u00b72      |\n| Above 60 years | 14,668 | 2\u00b71      | 20,124 | 3\u00b74      | 2,912 | 2\u00b74      | 9,831 | 3\u00b75      | 17,471 | 2\u00b72      | 23,956 | 3\u00b74      |\n\nThe percentages on total population are, as a rule, above the average of the provinces. And this fact tends to prove that Basti is not, on the whole, unhealthy.\n\nThe facts attaching to the statistics of caste may perhaps prove less revolting to the reader. Distributing the Hindu population into four conventional classes, the census shows 173,056 Br\u0101hmans (81,220 females); 44,274 R\u0101jputs (19,240 females); 44,757 Baniyas (20,827 females); and 985,141 persons belonging to \u201cthe other castes\u201d (460,331 females).\n\nTo avoid overloading our text with statistics, the proportion of each great class to the total Hindu population is shown in a note. And that proportion may be compared with the proportion in the provinces at large, thus:\n\n| Caste         | Basti | North-Western Provinces at large |\n|---------------|-------|---------------------------------|\n| Br\u0101hmans      | 13\u00b79 per cent | 12\u00b72 per cent |\n| R\u0101jputs       | 3\u00b75   | 9\u00b70    |\n| Baniyas       | 8\u00b76   | 3\u00b79    |\n| Others        | 79\u00b70  | 74\u00b79   |\n| Total         | 100\u00b70 | 100\u00b70  |\nLegend divides Br\u00e1hmans into two great nations, of which one, the Gaur, colonised Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. Of the five races into which this Gaur nation is again severed four are italicized in the following paragraph.\n\nThe census classes the Br\u00e1hmans of Basti as \"without distinction\" (73,388), Sarwariyas (68,241), Kanaujiyas (22,150), Gaurs (2,813), and Gautams (585). Under the heading of \"miscellaneous\" it mentions also the following small tribes:\u2014S\u00e1ras\u00fat, Sangaldw\u00edpi, Lohma, Gorakhbansi, Kashm\u00edri, Niwan, Kanjal, Sank\u00e1h\u00e1r, Balodra, Maithil, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1shtra, Pachgoti, and San\u00e1db. Pachgoti sounds suspiciously like Bachgoti, which is the appellation of a R\u00e1jput and not of a Br\u00e1hman clan. The names P\u00e1nde, Shukul, Tiw\u00e1ri, Misra, S\u00e1ndel, and Vasish\u00e1 are added. But the first four are mere honorary titles; the last two are names of tribal subdivisions (gotra); and all are common to many Br\u00e1hman tribes. Such of these miscellaneous or minor clans as have not already been noticed must await description in notices on districts where they are a little more numerous. Of the major tribes, the Sarwariyas are described in the Gorakhpur; the Kanaujiyas in the Et\u00e1wa and Farukhabad; and the Gaurs in the Aligarh and Meerut Gazetteers. Gautam, again, is rather a subdivisional title of several tribes than the name of any one tribe. There are, for instance, Gautam gotras of the Khatkul Kanaujiyas, of the San\u00e1dhs, of the Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs and of the Sarwariyas. It is probable that the Gautams of Basti belong mostly to the two last-named tribes. Of the Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs something has been said in the Gorakhpur and more remains to be said in the Benares notice. Meanwhile some further account of the Sarwariyas, the principal Br\u00e1hman clan of the district, will not be out of place.\n\nThe Sarwariyas or Sarj\u00fap\u00e1ris derive their name from Sarwar or Sarj\u00fap\u00e1r, the country \"across the Sarju\" or Gh\u00e1gra. This tract included Gorakhpur, Basti, and part, if not all, of Gonda. Though belonging to the great Kanaujiya race, the tribe must not be confused with that portion of the race known as Khatkul Kanaujiyas or Kanaujiyas proper. As Kanaujiyas, the Sarj\u00fap\u00e1ris of course claim Kanauj for their earliest home. But like nearly all the Br\u00e1hmans of Basti, they trace a more immediate origin to Ajudhya, just across the Gh\u00e1gra. Ajudhya was the capital of the deified Solar R\u00e1jput R\u00e1ma; and many families of Sarwariyas still\n\n---\n\n1 See preceding volume, p. 576 (Bareilly).\n2 For some account of the S\u00e1ras\u00fats see Gazetteer, III., 494 (Muzaffarnagar); of the Maithils, Gazetteer IV., 540 (Mainpuri); and of the San\u00e1dhs, VII., 64 (Farukhabad).\n3 See above, p. 352; Gazetteer, IV., 272; VII., 63; and III., 256, 392.\n4 See note on the castes of the district, Census Report of 1865.\nassert that it was he who invited their ancestors to colonize this district. Some say that, on the conclusion of his successful campaign against the giant-king of Ceylon, he specially requested the original Sarwariyas to migrate from Kanauj. Another less flattering account relates that by receiving alms some Kanaujiya Br\u00e1hmans lost caste in their own country; and that the kindhearted R\u00e1ma provided them with the means of forgetting their disgrace in a new land. Certain it is that, except by themselves, the Sarwariya Br\u00e1hmans are not regarded as of equal rank with the Kanaujiya Br\u00e1hmans proper. If, as Buchanan says, they assert superiority over the Kanaujiyas, it is merely because they have an uneasy knowledge that the Kanaujiyas are their acknowledged betters.\n\nThe Sarwariyas have 16 clans or gotras, bearing respectively the names of Garg, Gautam, S\u00e1ndil, Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00faj, Vasisht, Vatsa, Kasyap, K\u00e1syap, Kausik, Chandr\u00e1yan, S\u00e1varanya, Par\u00e1sar, Pulasta, Vrigu, Atri, and Angira. These names are in several cases, such as those of Vasisht, Kasyap, K\u00e1syap, Vrigu, Atri and Angira, derived from the appellations of great Br\u00e1hman saints. Though locally recognized, the distinction between Kasyap and K\u00e1syap is doubtful. But St. Kasyap's son would have been called K\u00e1syap, and might, like his father, have founded a separate gotra. Each of the various clans has its honorary title or titles. Thus the Gargs are called Shukul and P\u00e1nde; the Chandr\u00e1yans, S\u00e1varanyas, Par\u00e1sars and K\u00e1syaps, P\u00e1nde; the Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1jes, Dube; the Vatsas and Gautams, Dube and Misra; the Kas-yaps and Kausiks, Misra; and the S\u00e1ndils, Trip\u00e1thi or Tiw\u00e1ri. But it will be at once seen that this list does not account for all the clans; and other titles, such as Ojha, P\u00e1thakh, Up\u00e1dhya and Chaube might be added. Buchanan asserts that besides these 16 gotras or \"pangtis\" there are three others, which derive their names from places. What those names are he does not tell us; and his statement may be doubted, as opposed to more modern authority. The three clans of the first rank are the Gargs, Gautams, and S\u00e1ndils.\n\nAmongst the Sarwariyas, but far below the 16 clans just mentioned, are sometimes placed others called Jutaha or counterfeit. But these, as shown by the Gorakhpur tradition, belong more properly to the class named Saw\u00e1lakh\u00eds. The line between the Sarwariya and the Saw\u00e1lakh\u00ed is often difficult to draw. But the former is the superior and the latter the inferior. The former will become spiritual adviser (guru or purohit) to a family of respectable rank; the latter will become a temple-priest (panda). But sacerdotal appointments of this kind can be obtained by comparatively few of either\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, pp. 352-53.

The number of Br\u0101hmans still deserves the epithet of enormous. Except Gorakhpur, Cawnpore, and Allahabad, no district in these provinces has so many of that caste as Basti.\n\nThe legendary origin of the R\u0101jput tribes has been mentioned elsewhere. On the distinction between the Solar, Lunar, and Fire races it is needless to dwell further. But in the following list the names which appear on Tod's roll of the 36 Royal Tribes have been italicised.\n\nThe R\u0101jputs are returned as S\u016brajbansi (9,491), Bais (7,212), Ponw\u00e1r (1,058), Gautam (4,512), Parw\u00e1r (1,216), Chauh\u00e1n (1,313), Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j (4,211), Raghubansi (1,895), \"without distinction\" (1852), and miscellaneous. Under the last heading appear the following sparsely represented tribes:\u2014Konohik, Shi\u00fabansi, R\u0101jkum\u00e1ra, Kulh\u00e1ns, Jaisw\u00e1r (or Bhatti), Gahruw\u00e1r, Bh\u00e1l (or Bh\u00e1la-Sult\u00e1n), Pundir, Kinw\u00e1r, Dikshit, Sakarw\u00e1r, Sarnet, Bachgoti, Balmangaur, Rathor, Bisen, Surw\u00e1r, Kharag, N\u00e1gbansi, Orik, Gaur, Arail, Baghel, Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r, Mahraw\u00e1r, Sarandw\u00edpi, Chandrabansi, Bargi\u00e1r, Bhimla, Raikaw\u00e1r, Katebriya, and B\u00e1nsi. Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j is a clan-name common to many tribes. The Phu\u00ednh\u00e1rs, who are just as often called Br\u0101hmans as R\u0101jputs, have been mentioned under the former heading. Many of the miscellaneous tribes have been described elsewhere; and those that have not are too small to enlarge this notice. A sufficient account of the Bais and Ponw\u00e1rs will be found in the Gazetteers of Bareilly and Farukhabad respectively. The subject of Chauh\u00e1ns, genuine and spurious, has been exhausted in the Mainpuri and Bijnor notices. There remain for description only the S\u016brajbansi, Parw\u00e1rs, and Raghubansi.\n\nAll R\u0101jputs of the Solar Race might perhaps be called S\u016brajbansi; but S\u016brajbansi is here the specific name of a tribe. Of the Solar Race the Basti S\u016brajbansi of course boast themselves members. But their standing amongst R\u0101jputs is not remarkably high; and Mr. Sherring suggests that they were at first recruited from the degraded scions of many Solar tribes. Such men would naturally have fore-\n\n---\n\n1 Gazetteer, V., 576.\n2 Balla of Tod's list.\n3 Gazetteer, IV., 545-57; and V., 286-87.\n4 Gazetteer, V., 286-87.\n5 Gazr, IV., 545-57; and V., 286-87. Castes and tribes of Benares, p. 225.\ngathered and intermarried under the common title of S\u00farajbansi or sun-born. Both north and south of the Ganges plain, moreover, that title is a favourite assumption of highland aborigines who seek a Hindu pedigree. And there is some evidence in favour of the theory that the S\u00farajbansi came from the northern hills.\n\nThe Solar tribes are so-called because they claim descent from Ikshv\u00e1ku, the grandson of the Sun. This Ikshv\u00e1ku founded Ajudhya; and his fifty-eighth descendant was the semi-historical R\u00e1ma.\\(^1\\) Unlike the other Solar tribes who perhaps without exception trace their lineage to R\u00e1ma's sons, Lava and Kusha, the S\u00farajbansi find an ancestor in his brother Bharat. As R\u00e1ma's capital was on the common frontier of Basti and Faizabad, it is odd that the tribe should in neither district claim continuous residence from the time of his rule. The legend is that Bharat left Ajudhya to assist a mountain uncle against some invaders. The realm of this uncle was Kekaya, which has been diversely identified as Bh\u00fat\u00e1n and Kashmir. But wherever on the Him\u00e1laya this place may have been, on the Him\u00e1laya Bharat remained. He is said to have founded Sr\u00ednagar on the Alaknanda in Garhw\u00e1l; and from the neighbouring Kum\u00e1un are said to have migrated the Mahauli S\u00farajbansi.\\(^2\\) Some of the old kings of Kum\u00e1un may have styled themselves S\u00farajbansi; for S\u00farajbansi is the tribal name borne by the K\u00e1shipur r\u00e1ja, who claims descent from those princes.\n\nThe Faizabad S\u00farajbansi claim descent from one L\u00e1lji Singh, who, quitting Kum\u00e1un about 350 years ago, became servant to a grain-dealer in parganah Haveli Avadh. The grain-dealer having died childless owing to the curse of a hermit, L\u00e1lji took possession of his property and became a great land-holder. The Oudh Gazetteer\\(^3\\) asserts that the Mahauli or Mahson S\u00farajbansi belong to the same stock as L\u00e1lji's descendants. The former certainly say that they came from Kum\u00e1un three centuries ago, when under their chiefs Alakdeo and Tilakdeo they expelled the native R\u00e1jbhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas.\\(^4\\) The prevailing gotra or clan is the S\u00e1varanya or S\u00e1varan. The r\u00e1ja of Mahauli or Mahson is a S\u00farajbansi; and members of the same tribe have played a dominant part in the history of parganah Amorha. But the S\u00farajbansi are less influential in this district than in Oudh, whence they have the privilege of sending three chiefs to attend the Viceroy's court (darb\u00e1r).\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Tod's Rajasth\u00e1n, Madras reprint (1878), I. p. 30. According to another legend Ikshv\u00e1ku was generated by a sneeze of the Supreme Being. See Growse's Mathur\u00e1, 2nd edition, pedigree opposite p. 52.\n\n\\(^2\\) Eastern India, pp. 456-57.\n\n\\(^3\\) II., 78. The work in question is, however, mistaken in saying that the r\u00e1ja of Amorha was a S\u00farajbansi. It is mistaken also in making Mahauli and Mahson separate principalities.\n\n\\(^4\\) Gorakhpur-Basti settlement report, II., 204-05; Rajas and Nawabs of the North-Western Provinces, 50.\nThe Parw\u00e1r R\u00e1jputs are often called Palw\u00e1r and Paliw\u00e1r. Mr. Sherring suggests that the title is perhaps identical with that of the Paliw\u00e1l Baniyas, who derive their name from Palli in M\u00e1rw\u00e1r, and are sometimes credited with descent from Barg\u00fajar R\u00e1jputs. In support of this speculation he might have added that the Paliw\u00e1ls appear in Tod's list of those 84 mercantile classes which are \"chiefly of R\u00e1jput origin.\" But, though the Parw\u00e1rs really derive their name from a place called P\u00e1li, they have in truth no connection with the Palw\u00e1ls. The R\u00e1jput tribe boasts that its ancestors were Sombansis, that is, members of the Lunar Race descended from Budh, the grandson of the Moon. As Hastin\u00e1pur was the principal seat of this Budh's descendants, we of course find the Parw\u00e1rs claiming a north-western origin. They aver that in the 13th century they conquered and took their name from parganah P\u00e1li of Hardoi. The Parw\u00e1rs have ever since been a powerful race in Oudh and in those districts of the North-West which adjoin Oudh. Their valour and turbulence gave during the Great Rebellion much trouble in Basti, Gorakhpur, and Azamgarh.\n\nOnce established in P\u00e1li, they rapidly extended their conquests eastward. Their original leader Pirthiraj, Patr\u00e1j or Burhdeo, is said to have wrested much of Faizabad from the R\u00e1jbhars. Like the great Mayyura Misra of Gorakhpur he married four wives of different castes. From the first, a R\u00e1jputin, are descended the class of Parw\u00e1rs called Kaur; from the second, an Ahfr\u00edn, those named Ahfriniya; and from the third, a Bharin captive of his bow and spear, those known as Bhariniya. The fourth was a fair but unhallowed fay (deokanya or d\u00e1n) whom he met in the woods. Her descendants are styled Dainiyas or Bantarias. It is said that one day this lovely demon was baking cakes. Her first babe, which was lying at some little distance, began to cry; and in order to feed it, without at the same time leaving the cakes, she assumed gigantic proportions. At this moment her husband returned; and finding the secret of her supernatural powers discovered, the lady fled for ever. Few, however, of the Parw\u00e1rs in this district claim her as their ancestress. The members of the tribe in Basti, Gorakhpur, and Azamgarh are chiefly Bhariniyas and Ahiriniyas. They boast that on grand\n\n---\n\n1 Sherring, 231-32; 268-84. Tod, I., 76 and 109. 1 The Census Report of 1865 (note on castes of Azamgarh), and after it Mr. Sherring speaks of P\u00e1li as in the neighbourhood of Delhi. But as the former authority prefixes to the name of P\u00e1li that of S\u00e1ndi, there was small excuse for this mistake. The several Oudh accounts quoted below leave no doubt as to what P\u00e1li is meant. 2 Supra pp. 353-54, 359 and 483. 3 Carnegie's Castes and Tribes of Oudh, p. 51; Sherring, and Census Report of 1865, as above; Oudh Gazetteer, I., 327-32, and III., 479-81.\noccasions they rally from all parts of a circle some eighty miles round. But of this enough has been said above.\\footnote{Supra, p. 486.}\n\nAbout the Raghubansis there is less to be said. Their eponymous ancestor, Raghu, king of Ajudhya, was the 55th successor of Ikshv\u00e1ku and the great-grandfather of R\u00e1ma. They therefore claim to be Solar R\u00e1jputs; and in this part of the country boast a continuous residence from the reign of Raghu himself. It is probable, however, that they crossed the Gh\u00e1gra and entered Basti at a more advanced and less mythical date. All over the North-Western Provinces, they of course trace their origin to Ajudhya. But in Eta and some other districts they are content to forget Raghu and to ascribe their colonization to the leadership of Kusha, son of R\u00e1ma. In Basti they are fairly numerous, but not of much landed importance. Their principal clan or gotra is the Kasyap.\n\nThe census classes Baniyas as Kasaundhan (9,795), Agarahri (9,702), K\u00e1ndu (29,856), Agarw\u00e1l (2,107), \"without distinction\" (1,977), and miscellaneous. In the last class are included the following small tribes: Panw\u00e1r, Gol\u00e1puri, Kasarw\u00e1n\u00ed, Dasa, Dh\u00fasar, Bandarw\u00e1r, Jaisw\u00e1r, Ummar, Bahwar, S\u00e1ndil, Rajab, and Rastogi. Panw\u00e1r is perhaps a misprint for Palw\u00e1r or Paliw\u00e1l. Some account of the Kasarw\u00e1n\u00eds will be found in the Gazetteers of Cawnpore and Et\u00e1wa.\\footnote{See Gazetteer, IV., 281; and supra, p. 64.} The Dasas or half-breeds, as opposed to the Bis\u00e1s or thorough-breds, are a division of the Agarw\u00e1ls. The Agarw\u00e1ls themselves receive more or less description in the Saharanpur, Aligarh, Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Et\u00e1wa, and Budan notices;\\footnote{Gazetteer, II., 183, 395; III., 259, 497; VI., 280; and V., 45.} the Dh\u00fasars in those of Saharanpur, Aligarh, and Cawnpore,\\footnote{Gazetteer, II., ibid.; supra, p. 64.} the Ummars in those of Cawnpore and Farukhabad;\\footnote{Supra, p. 64; Gazetteer, VII., 72.} and the Agarahris in the latter notice. S\u00e1ndil or S\u00e1ndel is a name applied to clans of several Baniya tribes. It is noticeable that the Baranw\u00e1r, Unai, Kamalpuri, Rauniy\u00e1r, and Baya Baniy\u00e1s mentioned by Buchanan have disappeared; but his Jaunpur\u00eds, though unmentioned in the census, still exist. Of the four classes at present most numerous, the Kasaundhans and K\u00e1ndus alone await notice.\n\nThe Kasaundhans belong to that upper rank of Baniyas whose widows do not remarry. They are in Jaunpur said to be descended from the union of a K\u00e1ndu and a Sun\u00e1r woman.\\footnote{Note on castes of that district, Census Report of 1865.} Lucknow is sometimes named as the first home of the tribe. But the names of its two clans, eastern (Purbiya) and western (Pachhaiyan), point\nto a more ubiquitous origin; and the Kasaundhans of these provinces are most numerous in the Hamirpur district. Though here considered descendants of the ancient Vaisyas, the Kandus are in many cases mere agriculturists. Allowing the morganatic remarriage of widows, they are therefore placed low in the scale of Baniyas. They will eat the flesh of the wild boar; but from intoxicating liquors they, in public at least, abstain. According to Buchanan, Rajputs have no scruple in accepting water from their hands. About half the tribe are served by Brahman priests; but the remainder follow the heretical sects which have ever been favoured by Baniyas. They, as a rule, call themselves Madhyadesis or midlanders, after the geographical division in which ancient Hindu writers placed this district. To their other clans are assigned the names of Kanaujiya, Gaur, and Chanchara.\n\nHitherto we have been dealing with tribes who claim descent from the\n\nThe \"other castes\" of \"twice-born\" races of Manu\u2014with tribes who have some pride of pedigree, and supply the district with its leading families. We now descend to the lower strata of society, to those whom Manu would most probably have classed as Sudras. But though of mixed or aboriginal origin, these \"other castes\" form by far the most numerous and useful part of the population. Their names are shown in the following compilation from the census. But it should be premised that, though classed with Hindus, several of the tribes here mentioned are for the most part Muhammadan. The Julaha, the Ghosi, and the Tawaf would have found a more appropriate place amongst the Muslim population:\n\n| Aghori (religious-sectary) | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | 44

be added 3,683 persons of unspecified caste or occupation.\n\nThe Bang\u00e1lis were probably deemed too few to be distinguished otherwise than by nationality. It will be noticed that no cobblers (Mochi) or water-carriers (Bihishti) appear on the list. The former have been included in the great army of Cham\u00e1rs, to which by caste they belong; the latter, being mostly Muhammadans, may perhaps be sought in the returns of the Muhammadan Shaikhs. For the K\u00e1chhis, so numerous in the D\u00fa\u00e1b districts, we may search in vain. Their place is here taken by Mur\u00e1os. An aboriginal race of Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs is found in Chut\u00eda N\u00e1gpur; but the census does not enter the Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1rs as aborigines. If, on the other hand, they are Aryans, it is hard to see why they were not classed\namongst the Br\u00e1hmans or R\u00e1jputs. The Ah\u00edrs, Arakhs, Baheliyas, Bair\u00e1g\u00eds, B\u00e1nsphors, Banj\u00e1r\u00e1s, Barha\u00eds, Bhars, Bh\u00e1ts, Ch\u00e1\u00eds, Cham\u00e1rs, Darz\u00eds, Dh\u00e1nuks, D\u00fas\u00e1dhs, J\u00e1ts, Jog\u00eds, Jotish\u00eds, Kam\u00e1ngars, Kaseras, Khattris, Koris, Kurmis, Lodhs or Lodhas, Nuner\u00e1s or Lunias, Rains, R\u00e1jbhars, Sani\u00e1s\u00eds, Sun\u00e1rs, and Thatheras are described in the fourth, fifth, present and seventh volumes of this series. The Kharw\u00e1rs, Gonds, and Seoris will be mentioned in the Mirz\u00e1pur notice. For some reason unknown the census has included the last-named class amongst the mendicant and religious orders. Accounts of such orders have found or will find more appropriate place in the \"religion\" sections of this and other notices. We here deal with castes only; and the same reason will save us the trouble of describing several classes which are as yet trades rather than castes. The Maim\u00e1rs, Pall\u00e1d\u00e1rs, Bahr\u00fapiyas, B\u00e1jg\u00eds, Beld\u00e1rs, and Koris\u00b9 are recruited by members of several different tribes. Their development into distinct and exclusive brotherhoods may be deemed incomplete. The following paragraphs deal briefly with most of the remaining castes. But the occasional absence of material forbids exhaustive treatment.\n\nThe Aheriyas or Abeliyas are a low and destitute caste descended from the Dh\u00e1nuks. Like the Dh\u00e1nuks they practise fowling; but their chief employment in many districts is the capture of snakes, which they eat roasted. They have hitherto been uncivilized, almost unclad, and notoriously bad characters.\u00b2 But the pursuit of agriculture has in some places begun to mollify their manners. Mr. Sherring describes the Barg\u00e1his as a caste engaged chiefly in the domestic service of high-class Hind\u00fas. But they are here probably identical with the Barg\u00e1ha Ah\u00edrs mentioned in the Gorakhpur notice.\u00b3 The B\u00e1ris are a caste with but one clan, who stitch or peg large leaves into temporary platters and cups. But they are sometimes torch-makers, tree-fellers, and even barbers. As servants they enjoy the reputation of great fidelity. Mr. Reade quotes a proverb which says that \"the B\u00e1ri dies fighting for his master.\"\u2074 As its reputed ancestors were a barber and a female tobacconist, and as its widows remarry, the caste ranks low in public estimation. The same may be said of the Bharbhunjas, who, according to Wilson, are descended from a Kah\u00e1r and a S\u00fadra woman. Like the Cham\u00e1rs and other low castes, they profess to be divided into seven clans (k\u00farti). All of these they can never enumerate; but the names of six, the Kanaujiya, Saksena, Uttar\u00e1ha, K\u00e1ndu, Madhesia, and Jaisw\u00e1ra, are ascertainable. A class of K\u00e1yaths, belonging to the\n\n\u00b9 According to Mr. Growse (note on castes, Census Report of 1872), the Maim\u00e1rs and Koris are sometimes Cham\u00e1rs. \u00b2 See Gazr., II., 397. \u00b3 Supra, pp. 358-69. \u2074 Inferior Castes of the N.-W. P., p. 14.\nM\u00e1thur clan, parch grain, and are therefore called Bharbhunjas. But with the Bharbhunja caste they have no connection. From the Halw\u00e1sis and Kah\u00e1rs that caste is not so easily distinguished. Some of its members, especially those of the K\u00e1ndu and Kanaujiya clans, make sweetmeats; and they are therefore mistaken for Halw\u00e1sis not only by Bharbhunjas of other clans, but by the Halw\u00e1sis themselves. The confusion is increased by the fact that the Halw\u00e1sis also have a Kanaujiya and a Madhesia clan. The various clans of Bharbhunjas, moreover, know little of one another. They neither eat together nor intermarry; and are practically separate castes. Amongst the Kah\u00e1r clans, again, we find the names of Jaisw\u00e1ra and Kanaujiya. But from both Kah\u00e1rs and Halw\u00e1sis the Bharbhunjas are separated by the prohibition of eating or wedding together.\n\nThe Bh\u00faj caste, which the census returns as existing only in this district, Gorakhpur, and Jaunpur, is perhaps merely a subdivision of the Bharbhunja. Bharbhunjas are variously styled Bhunja, Bhurji, Bhar-bh\u00faja, Bhad-bh\u00faja, Barbhunja, Bhuj\u00e1ri, and Bhunj\u00e1ri. The basis of all these names is the Hindi verb bh\u00fannd, to parch or fry; and the bhar, bhad or bar sometimes imposed thereon is nothing more than an abbreviation of the Hindi bh\u00e1r, an oven.\n\nBharti or Bhartiya is the name of both a Kunbi clan and a class of religious mendicants. As the census does not include the Bast\u00ed Bhartiyas amongst the latter, we may hazard the speculation that the former is intended. But no positive statement can be made on the subject. The caste is mentioned in the returns for this district and Sah\u00e1r\u00e1npur only; and is not apparently to be confused with the Bharthi or wood-splitting tribe of Mirz\u00e1pur.\n\nThe Chh\u00edpis are a separate caste, although their name simply means cloth-printer (chhapna, to print). It is almost needless to say that their claim to be considered R\u00e1thor R\u00e1jputs is frivolous. But they still inhabit in large numbers what was once the old R\u00e1thor kingdom of Kanauj. They have given their name to parganah Chhibr\u00e1mau in that neighbourhood; and also, perhaps, to Chhapra in Bih\u00e1r. The origin and nature of the Dh\u00e1dis or Dh\u00e1rhis, who are found here, in Gorakhpur and in Et\u00e1wa, have hitherto baffled research. The Dh\u00fanas, Dhunyas or Kateras, whom the bastard official language of the country sometimes prefers to style nadd\u00edf, card or comb cotton. Musalm\u00e1ns also engage in this occupation; but the Hind\u00fas with whom we are dealing form a distinct caste. \"The instrument by which the combing and cleaning are performed,\" writes Mr. Sherring, \"is\nsimply a bow. Squatting on the ground before a quantity of fresh cotton, which is ordinarily full of dirt, seeds, bits of stick and so forth, the bow being in his left hand and a wooden mallet in his right, the Katera strikes the string of the bow and brings it quivering to the surface of the cotton, portions of which adhering to it in light fibres are at once caught up by the string. The striking being repeated continuously, all the cotton is by degrees beautifully combed. And at the same time its foul particles, becoming separated from the fibres and being weighty, fall away of themselves.\"\n\nOf the Doms something has been said above. But for a further description of this interesting gypsy tribe, whose name has been plausibly identified with the \"Romany\" of Europe, no apology is needed. That the Dom is an aboriginal, and that his abject degradation had its origin in his enslavement by Hindu conquerors, is almost beyond doubt. But his present habits amply account for the contempt and disgust with which even the lowest castes regard him. He is personified pollution. He is the public scavenger, the public executioner. He eats the flesh of disease-slaughtered swine, and prepares the pile for the unclean bodies of the dead. He is a wine-bibber, a thief, and a vagabond. From the hour that he pitches his ragged reed tent on some grassy roadside patch near the village, thefts are expected, and expected with justice.\n\nThe seven clans into which he of course divides his tribe are by one list named Kunwar, Haz\u00e1ri, S\u00e1nwat, Bhagw\u00e1r, Chauh\u00e1n, Chaudhari, and Balgaiyan. Of these the first is highest; but clan distinctions are less regarded than the division into Maghaya Doms and Doms proper. The former, whose name is commonly derived from a place called M\u00e1g or Magha in the Gaya district, are quite irreclaimable. The latter sometimes adopt an honest life and enter the ranks of the B\u00e1sphors or kindred tribes. For the purposes of thieving and begging, the Doms divide the country into circles (il\u00e1ka or gol). The residents of different circles will not, it seems, intermarry. A Dom who committed theft in a foreign circle would quickly find himself surrendered to justice by his brethren of the poached preserve. So strict indeed are these laws of boundary that in some cases the customs of his fraternity would forbid him to leave his own circle. Thus in Gorakhpur a Dom of the Mah\u00e1r\u00e1jganj tahsil cannot, under pain of excommunication, pass west of the Rohin river. Though they sometimes accompany burglars, Doms seldom if ever consent to bore the usual hole through the wall of the house attacked. The burglar's chisel (sabri) they never carry. Their specialty in thieving is the use of the\n\n1 i.e., raw. 2 Pp. 360-361. 3 That of Mr. W. Crooke, o.s., who has kindly fur-\nnished an interesting note on the Doms.\nrough knife called *b\u00e1nk*, with which they cut through the wicker screens sometimes used as doors. This *b\u00e1nk* is their only weapon. No Dom was ever known to use a gun. But on their raids the gangs sometimes carry earthen pots filled with burning charcoal; and these when hard pressed they use as hand-grenades. On opening a campaign of larceny they often feign themselves Cham\u00e1rs or other men of low caste, bound on a pilgrimage to Ajudhya. In the connubial season of early summer they are particularly active, joining marriage processions with a view of begging or theft. Stolen property they barter for grain, the receivers being chiefly Cham\u00e1rs. When the theft is discovered and the Dom imprisoned, his kinswomen tie a cloth or string round their heads in token of mourning. At the same time an obliging friend undertakes the protection of his wife, restoring her only when the convict returns from jail.\n\nIn his relations with the fair sex, indeed, the Dom is somewhat licentious. The late Sah\u00e1i of Gorakhpur, the principal executioner in this part of the provinces, kept when not in prison four mistresses. But the Dom's licence is of the insolent rather than the gallant order, and his behaviour towards women often brings him into trouble. His marriage is celebrated without religious ceremonies, and without the intervention of any caste council (*panch\u00e1yat*). The tribe has indeed no regular foremen (*chaudhari*) to preside over assemblies of the latter kind. But the leading man of the circle is called master (*m\u00e1lik*), and felons of the Sah\u00e1i stamp sometimes acquire great influence.\n\nThe favourite viand of the tribe, both at marriages and other festivities, is pork. For the slaughter of fish or game they have neither net nor spear. They have not, like Hind\u00fas, any half-sacred circle (*chauka*) within which to cook their food; and content themselves with a mere fire-place of clods. Spirits, tobacco, and the intoxicating decoction (*g\u00e1vja*) from the wild hemp are greedily consumed when obtainable. Drunken brawls are common, and few adult Doms are unmarked by knife-scars. But against washing their dirty linen in public they have a chivalrous dislike. They never prosecute, never appeal an order, and when arraigned never call a witness in defence. In jail they are noted for their filthy habits. But on prison diet they rapidly fatten. They are indeed a very healthy race. Against small-pox they take no precautions, even in the way of inoculation. But from fever they protect themselves by always encamping in open places. In wet weather they creep into villages to shelter themselves in cowsheds or under the eaves of houses. But they rarely remain more than three days in one place. When that place has been\nthoroughly thieved, or becomes too hot to hold them, their women shoulder their few moveables and they decamp.\n\nThe Doms believe greatly in magic (ojh\u00e1i). They have no special dances or songs. But, like the Dus\u00e1dhs, they at weddings and on other important occasions worship a god called Rah\u00fa. Marching in a body to some open space, they plant in its midst a pair of stout bambus. Between and to these, again, they tie cross pieces of iron or wood which are supposed to represent swords. On this slender scaffolding they mount and perform a sort of funambulistic dance. A cock is sacrificed to the god; a trench is dug; a fireplace is built; while on the last, in an iron pot, are boiled milk, oil and clarified butter. The trench is about seven cubits long by one in breadth and depth; and in it, after the acts just described, firewood is burnt to cinders. During this process the women sing and beat drums; while one man pretends to feel the afflatus of the god, and babbles nonsense. After some time he who is called gurud, pastor and master, washes his feet in the liquids boiled hard by. He walks through the smouldering trench, and is followed by the other men. They are said to avoid burning their feet by applying thereto the juice of the mad\u00e1r (Culotropis gigantea). But as the man first through receives a present of about Rs. 4, it is presumed that the operation is not altogether free from danger.\n\nLike the Sun\u00e1rs, of whose vocabulary specimens were given above,\u00b9 the Doms have a special slang of their own. And with Mr. Crooke's list of their more important phrases we may bring our notice of the tribe to a close:\n\n| English | Dom\u00e1ni | English | Dom\u00e1ni

Hind\u00fas and Muslims. But the Hindu hair-dressers form a caste better known amongst themselves as N\u00e1i or Na\u00fa. All barbers are well employed in a land whose inhabitants are too lazy to shave themselves; but as Hind\u00fas rarely grow beards, the Hindu barber has far more work than his Muslim equivalent. The N\u00e1i shaves the head and face, pares the nails and cleans the ears. But he has also more important functions. Barbers are still in India what they have almost ceased to be in Europe, barber-chirurgeons. In the former country they are even yet the recognized cuppers and bleeders. They play also a considerable part in domestic diplomacy. They arrange marriages and superintend marriage-feasts. They are the envoys who invite guests to both weddings and funerals. On the seventh day after birth the new-born child and its mother are entrusted to the care of the barber's wife (naini). Amongst other clans of the caste may be mentioned the Sr\u00ed-B\u00e1stak, Kanaujiya, and Bhojpuriya.\n\nLiving simple lives and having healthy appetites, the inhabitants of India love sweets. The demand has produced a large supply of confectioners; and such artists belong in Basti chiefly to the Halw\u00e1\u00ed caste. The Halw\u00e1\u00eds are divided into the usual seven clans, which in their case are named Kanaujiya, Pachpiria, Baun\u00edw\u00e1la, Gaunr, Madhesia, Tih\u00e1r, and Lakhn\u00e1wa. In the Lower D\u00fa\u00e1b there are other divisions, such as the Chailha, D\u00fabe, Bakarra, and Tilbhunja. Though these clans hold\nas a rule quite aloof from one another, intermarriage is to some slight extent permitted. The Kanaujiyas, for instance, form an occasional alliance with the Madhesias. The Pachpirias have miscellaneous tastes in religion. They worship five deities of their own; but they also worship the banner erected in honour of the Muslim saint Gh\u00e1zi Miy\u00e1n, and the models of Saints Hasan's and Husain's tombs. They make pilgrimages to Bahraich, where the crescentading martyr, S\u00e1l\u00e1r Masa\u00fad Gh\u00e1zi, was slain. But Gh\u00e1zi Miy\u00e1n and Sal\u00e1r Masa\u00fad were perhaps, if they ever existed, the same. Buchanan mentions that, although keeping widows as concubines, the Halw\u00e1s are deemed as of almost equal rank with the Baniyas.\n\nThe word Kah\u00e1r is said to be a contraction of Kandh\u00e1r, which is in turn derived from k\u00e1ndha, a shoulder. For the Kah\u00e1rs are chiefly carriers of palanquins, whose poles rest on the shoulders. But here as elsewhere in India, improved modes of conveyance and the decline of litter-carrying have forced the Kah\u00e1r into other pursuits. He is a domestic servant, a fisherman, an agriculturist, a grain-roaster, a net maker, a stone-breaker and a general labourer. It is probable, however, that the three former occupations, though more often adopted than formerly, were always to some extent adopted by the tribe. When Anglo-Indians preferred native habits and eschewed wheeled vehicles, a large staff of palanquin-bearers formed part of almost every establishment. The head or sard\u00e1r bearer remained as a body-servant when palanquins were discarded and the rest of the Kah\u00e1rs dismissed. The names of the Bombay servants hamm\u00e1l and \"boy\" (bhoi) point to a similar origin. The Kah\u00e1rs assert that they have no more than seven clans; but Mr. Sherring's researches have resulted in the discovery of twice that number, viz., Jaisw\u00e1ra, Gonr or Gond, Dhuria, Kbarw\u00e1ra, Batma, Raw\u00e1ni, Turha, Dh\u00edmar, Gonria, Muri\u00e1ri, Jetans, Kanaujiya, Baradiya, and Tonha. The same writer suggests that the Gonds may at first have been Hinduized members of the aboriginal tribe so called. The industry and respectability of the Kah\u00e1rs have secured them a high position amongst the lower castes, notwithstanding the facts that their widows re-marry and that some members of the tribe eat pork.\n\nThough of almost the same rank as Baniyas, Kal\u00e1ls or Kalw\u00e1rs are not deemed very reputable members of society. Their widows do not re-marry; but they themselves too often indulge freely in the spirits which it is their trade to distil and sell. It is only fair to mention that one of their eight clans, the Bi\u00e1h\u00fat, neither sells\n\n1 See Gazr, II., 77, and V., 90.\nnor drinks intoxicating liquors. Bi\u00e1h\u00fats, who abstain also from meat, earn their living as grain-merchants and bankers. The remaining sub-castes are the Jais-w\u00e1ras, who wed as many wives as they please; the Bhuj-kalauras, descended from marriages between Bharbhunjas and Kalw\u00e1rs; the Surhis, Sunris or Sirdhis, who by eating swine\u2019s flesh have placed themselves lowest on the list; the Gurers, the Raikal\u00e1rs, the Bhojpuras and the T\u00e1nks. A ninth clan, the Rangkis, is sometimes added; but the Rangkis, being Muslims, are not members of the Hindu caste. None of the clans intermarries with others. The Kanjars are a much lower tribe, who in their gypsy habits resemble the Doms and Nats. They twist cotton and hemp into strings, make large brushes for cleaning cotton yarn, and weave the screens of aromatic grass-root which are used to cool houses during the hot-winds. Some of them are bird-catchers and skewer small birds on spiked rods. They have seven clans, called respectively Maraiya, Sankat, Bhains, Soda, Lakarh\u00e1r, Goher, and Dhobi-bans. The first six eat and marry together; but will have nothing to say to the last, whose name implies connection with the impure race of washermen. Kanjars eat everything save beef.\n\nKarwals.\n\nKarwals or Karils, found here and in Dehra D\u00fan only, are probably identical with the Karauls of Benares. If so, they are a tribe of fowlers, who assume the Rajput suffix Singh. They too count seven clans; but of these only four, the Haj\u00e1ris, Uttariyas, P\u00farbiyas, and Koireriyas, are Hindu. The remaining three, including one named Turkiya, are Musalm\u00e1n. The various clans do not intermarry.\n\n\u201cThe Pandits here insist,\u201d writes Buchanan, \u201cthat the K\u00e1yasths are mere S\u00fadras, and that they are lower than the K\u00e1ndus; but on account of their influence they are included among the gentry (ashr\u00e1f). All who have been long settled in this country live pure and are endeavouring all they can to elevate themselves from the dregs of the people; but this has yet failed of success, as many of their kindred from other countries, who come here, still adhere to their impurity, and sit on the same mat with the pure men of this district. This impurity consists in drinking spirituous liquors, and in eating meat killed by a butcher. They do not keep widows as concubines. The highest Br\u00e1hmans will not eat in their house, and the sweetmeats which they offer, even to the lower Br\u00e1hmans, must not pass through their hands. But a Br\u00e1hman admits them without scruple to sit on the same mat with him, which he will not do to any individual of a lower tribe who does not happen to be rich or powerful. None of them here will touch the plough, but they have been highly favoured in obtaining their lands, the rents having in general been at the disposal of their kinsmen. Almost\nthe whole are of the Srib\u00e1stav tribe. Perhaps 100 families of these are called Khara Srib\u00e1stav, alleging that the others, who are called simply Srib\u00e1stavs, are bastards; a compliment returned to the Kharas by the multitude. Many of the Srib\u00e1stavs, descended of some families who accompanied the Sarnets from the west, call themselves P\u00e1nd\u00e9, and are generally allowed to be higher than the others. There may be 10 families of Gaur K\u00e1yaths, 15 of Ath\u00e1naks, 2 of Bhatnagar, and about 10 who are avowedly bastards (Krishnapakshi). Almost all the K\u00e1yaths have farms, and as many as can find employment use the pen in the revenue and judicial departments; for fifteen-sixteenths can read and write, and many understand Persian. A few are traders, and a few carry arms in the police and revenue departments; for here the civil officers are armed.\" It should be remembered that these lines were written of combined Gorakhpur and Basti, and written some 63 years ago. The officials of the revenue department are no longer armed, although the traces of former armament may sometimes be noticed in the sword-sling attached to the belt of an orderly. When Buchanan speaks of gentry (ashraf, bhal\u00e1m\u00e1nush) he means the first of the four classes into which he divides the population. The others are the lower mercantile (Baniya, Bakk\u00e1l), the artisan (Alharf), and the ploughman (grihasth, khet\u00edh\u00e1r). None save the lowest consented to plough or reap; and both these occupations are still held in some contempt. The statement that K\u00e1yaths are allowed to sit on the same mat as a Br\u00e1hman seems to show that the former are not really considered S\u00fadras. It is laid down in the laws of the M\u00e1navas that a S\u00e1dra who sits on the same seat as a Br\u00e1hman shall receive a gash on the offending part.\n\nThe Kh\u00e1krob or \"dust-sweeper\" is perhaps better known amongst Hind\u00fas as Bhangi or Chuhra. The first of these two latter names is derived from bh\u00e1ng, the intoxicating juice of the wild hemp. But the Kh\u00e1krob has several grander titles, which have been invented in either concealment or irony of his despicable social standing. Such are Mihtar or prince, Hal\u00e1lkhor or eater of lawful food, and L\u00e1l-begi or worshipper of the Red Saint. This red saint or L\u00e1l Guru is an ancient tribal deity who has been identified with the demon (r\u00e1kshas) Aron\u00e1karat. But Kh\u00e1krobs who have turned Musalm\u00e1ns call him a follower of the Prophet; and when not translating his name into L\u00e1lbeg, style him P\u00edr Zahr. Such Kh\u00e1krobs are called Shaikhs. But most Kh\u00e1krobs, though conforming\n\n---\n\n1 Eastern India, II., 466-67.  \n2 Elliot attempts to prove (Supplemental Glossary, art. \"Chuhra\") that Mihtar is not a term of contempt. Makattara, the Sanskrit equivalent of that Persian title, was applied, he says, to Sudras generally, because they were more numerous than the other castes. But it is more usual to hear that the early Muslim invaders called the sweepers Mihtar in derision.\nin marriages and a few other ceremonies to Hindu modes, are in habits more Musalm\u00e1n than Hindu. They bury their dead. They sometimes sacrifice in the name of L\u00e1lbeg a fowl which has had its throat cut \"in the name of God the Compassionate, the Most Merciful.\" On the death of kinsmen they perform tija, which also is a custom peculiar to Musalm\u00e1ns. By including their Shaikh brothers the Kh\u00e1krobs manage to count seven clans; the six which are Hindu being the Hela, L\u00e1lbegi, Gh\u00e1z\u00edpuri R\u00e1\u00fat, D\u00e1napuri R\u00e1\u00fat, H\u00e1ri, and B\u00e1nsphor. But Sir Henry Elliot makes the Helas and R\u00e1\u00fats distinct castes, while adding the names of the following clans:\u2014Baniw\u00e1l, Bilparw\u00e1r, T\u00e1k, Gablot, Kholi, G\u00e1gra, Sardhi, Chand\u00e1l\u00eda, Sirs\u00e1wal, and Siriy\u00e1r. The Helas were perhaps distinguished from other Kh\u00e1krobs because they will not look after dogs, or eat food left by persons other than Hind\u00fas. But the D\u00e1napuri R\u00e1\u00fats share to some extent this prejudice, refusing food that has been served to Europeans. Most Kh\u00e1krobs will devour the leavings of all classes. The L\u00e1lbegis are so called because they once a year erect in honour of L\u00e1lbeg a long pole covered with flags, colored cloth, cocoanuts, and other cheap trifles.\n\nTo the clans above named might perhaps be added other such as the Gadahlas of Mirz\u00e1pur, who rear donkeys and thereon remove the city sweepings. Mr. Sherring asserts that in Benares the various clans do not intermarry; but the evidence of Sir H. Elliot and Mr. P. Carnegy shows that in the rest of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh they do. In spite of their dirty habits and general degradation, the Kh\u00e1krobs boast themselves superior to sweepers of some other castes, such as Dh\u00e1nuks.\n\nThe Khatiks or Khatiks must not be confused with either the professional musicians called Kathak or the Khatak Path\u00e1ns found in parts of the D\u00fa\u00e1b. The Khat\u00edk rears pigs, goats, and poultry. But he is sometimes a butcher, a leather-worker, a stone-cutter, or a fruiterer; sometimes extracts the juice or toddy from the bark of the wild date and the palmyra.\u00b9 As this last operation is most often performed by P\u00e1s\u00eds, we are not surprised to find a P\u00e1s\u00ed clan amongst the Kh\u00e1t\u00edks. The other clans, six of course in number, are the Bakar-ka-S\u00e1o, Chalan-Mahr\u00e9o, Ghor-Char\u00e1o, Ajudhy\u00e1b\u00e1si, Sunkhar, and Bauria. The Sunkhars and P\u00e1s\u00eds are said to have at one time smoked together; but when the former adopted the low trade of poulterer, the latter withdrew from their society. None of the clans eats or intermarries with another. At Khat\u00edk marriages boys dress themselves in women's clothes and dance in public.\n\n\u00b9From the native name for the fermented juice (t\u00e1ri or t\u00e1li) of the palmyra (t\u00e1r or t\u00e9d) is derived the English word \"toddy.\" Another word of similar sense, \"punch,\" has also an Hind \u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed origin.\nKumh\u00e1r or Koh\u00e1r is a contraction of the Sanskrit *kumbhakdra*, a potter; Kumh\u00e1rs, K\u00fazagars, and Laberas. Pottery is still the chief trade of the Kumh\u00e1rs, but they also make bricks and tiles. Their seven clans are the Kanaujiya, the Hatheliya, the Swariya, the Bardhiya, the Godaihiya, the Kasgar or Kastora, and the Chauh\u00e1nia-misrs. All Kumh\u00e1rs are according to the Dharma Purana descended from a Br\u00e1hman and a Kshatriya woman; but such descent seems now claimed only by the Chauh\u00e1nia-misrs, whose clan-name is compounded of two well-known R\u00e1jput and Br\u00e1hman titles. The Bardhiyas and Godaihiyas are said to derive their names from the fact that they load their brick-earth on bullocks (*bardha*) and donkeys (*gadha*) respectively. The Kasgars devote themselves chiefly to the manufacture of plates and dishes. The K\u00fazagars or \u201cjug-makers\u201d are all perhaps members of the Kumh\u00e1r caste, but confine themselves to the finer and more ornamental branches of the ceramic art. Intimately connected with both Kumh\u00e1rs and K\u00fazagars are the Laheras or Lakher\u00e1s, who varnish earthenware and other articles. Their name is derived from the lac (l\u00e1h) of which their varnish is made.\n\nThe Loh\u00e1rs, who trace their lineage to Visvekarma, the workman of the gods, are sometimes carpenters as well as blacksmiths. They have nominally seven clans, amongst which intermarriage is forbidden; but the number might be increased. Mr. Sherring mentions the following ten:\u2014Kanaujiya, Mahauliya, Sr\u00ed-b\u00e1st\u00e1k, Malik, Ban\u00e1rsiya, Chaurasha, Purbiya, Maghaiya, S\u00ednar, and Mathuriya. The name of the second is perhaps derived from Mahuli in this district. The M\u00e1l\u00eds or gardeners, who derive theirs from *mdl*, a wreath, are sometimes small-pox doctors also. Those who adopt the latter profession are known as Darshaniyas. The M\u00e1l\u00eds are in some districts said to be identical with the S\u00e1nis. They have, according to Buchanan, seven clans, named Magahi, Sirmaur, Ban\u00e1rsiya, Kanaujiya, Baghel, Kahauliya, and Desi. The tribe permits the remarriage of widows.\n\nAll boatmen of whatever caste are called Mall\u00e1hs. But there is a special tribe of boatmen, fishermen, and net-makers bearing this name. It is divided into the Mall\u00e1h proper, the Muria or Muri\u00e1ri, the Pand\u00fabi, the Bathawa or Badhariya, the Chaini, Chain or Chai, the Sur\u00e1ya, the Guriya, the Tiar, the Kulwant or Kulwat, and the Khewat clans. There is a tradition that these clans once intermarried; but they no longer do so. Their widows are allowed to wed again. Whether the Chai clan has any real connection with the Chai tribe above\u00b9 noticed is doubtful. Mr. Sherring describes them apart. The Khewats or rowers\u00b2, who are often\n\n\u00b9 Supra p. 361. \u00b2 Kheond, to row.\nbasket-makers as well as boatmen, sometimes appear as a separate caste. All Mall\u00e1hs claim descent from a common ancestor named Nikhad; but these Khewats boast that they alone are the offspring of his lawful wife. The Mall\u00e1hs of Benares assert that R\u00e1ma gave their chief a horse. But with the proverbial sailor ignorance in such matters the recipient placed a bridle on the tail instead of the head. Hence, it is said, the custom of placing the helm on the stern instead of the bow. The M\u00ednas are an aboriginal tribe of whom little or nothing is known except that they are expert thieves.\n\nThe Mur\u00e1os are the same as the Koeris, who are sometimes identified with the K\u00e1chhis also. They are market-gardeners and general cultivators. Buchanan derives their name from m\u00fbr or m\u00fbli, a radish; Sherring from mowr, the crown of flowers placed at marriages on the head of the bridegroom. The tribe has probably some twenty or thirty clans, though claiming as usual only seven. The names of some may be given as follows:\u2014Kanaujiya, Hardia, Il\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1di, Brijb\u00e1si, Kori, Purbiha, Dakkhanaha, Nar\u00e1igana, Ban\u00e1rsiya, Kachhw\u00e1ha, Torikoriya, Bardw\u00e1r, Jarahar, Goit, Chir\u00e1mait, Bh\u00e1ru, Sarwariya, and Bahmaniya. According to Buchanan the Koeris have the same priests, and eat in the same manner, as the Kurmis or Kunbis. He adds that being mostly Vaishnavas they reject animal food.\n\nThe Musahars are a half-wild tribe at the very bottom of the social ladder. They will eat almost anything, and are said to derive their name from the fact that mice (m\u00fbsa) form an important part of their diet. Like the Doms and Kanjars, already described, the Nats are a vagrant and a gypsy race. They live by fortune-telling, exhibiting animals, quackery, juggling, rope-dancing, and other acrobatic performances. If a Nat is asked to tell the clans of his tribe he will answer that there are seven, the Kshatriyas, the snake-exhibitors, the bear-exhibitors, the jugglers, the dancers, the rope-dancers, and the monkey-exhibitors. But there really exist many more, of which many are subdivided into branches bearing separate names. Of such subdivisions the following list makes no reckoning:\u2014R\u00e1ri, Bhantu, Gw\u00e1l, Lodhra, Maghaiya, J\u00fagila and Jhas\u00e1sth, all found in Gh\u00e1zipur; Gw\u00e1li\u00e1ri, Sanwat, Brijb\u00e1si, Bachgoti, Bijania, Baria, Mah\u00e1wat and B\u00e1zigar, in Oudh; Kam\u00e1rp\u00e1li, Dangarp\u00e1li, M\u00e1rp\u00e1li and Samarp\u00e1li, in Bh\u00e1galpur of Bengal. The Mah\u00e1wats and B\u00e1zigars have however been converted from Hinduism to Isl\u00e1m. Nats eat all kinds of flesh except beef.\n\n1 See Eastern India, II. 469; Castes and Tribes of Benares, 325; and Beames' edition of the Supplemental Glossary, I., 181.\nTheir dead are often buried. The Benares members of the tribe abstain from intoxicating drinks, but their Oudh brethren are described as great drunkards. Nat women go through much the same performances as their husbands, and in those performances are not often troubled by any qualms of decency. They sometimes bleed and extract teeth.\n\nA not improbable legend, current amongst the P\u00e1sis themselves, tells us that of yore that tribe were Bhars. There is, indeed, little doubt that the race is aboriginal. The P\u00e1si is not by Hindus regarded as Hindu, and his features are not those of an Aryan. But he nevertheless fables that his ancestors, whether called Bhars or P\u00e1sis, sprang from the sweat on the brow of the great Br\u00e1hman Parasur\u00e1ma. The first mention of the caste occurs perhaps in the Alh\u00e1 Udal Prast\u00e1h of Chand. Its original occupation was, as shown above, netting or fowling. This it still pursues; but it devotes itself also to watchmanship, pig-breeding, and field labour. The following are some of its clans: Jaisw\u00e1ra, Kainswat or Kaithwan, G\u00fajar, Tris\u00faliya, Pas\u00edw\u00e1n, Chhiriy\u00e1m\u00e1r, Biad\u00edh, B\u00edr\u00e1ri, and perhaps Belkhar. In the name of Chhiriy\u00e1m\u00e1r or bird-slayer we have again a reference to the earliest trade of the P\u00e1sis. The present trade of the Patwas or Patahras is the manufacture of cheap trinkets. These they make of gold-edged silk or silk cloth, zinc, tin and other inferior metals. Their five clans, which do not intermarry, are the Kh\u00e1rew\u00e1l or Khandiw\u00e1l, the Khara or Khare, the Deobansi, the Lahera, and the Jogi Patwa. The name of the Sar\u00e1hiyas perhaps shows them makers of earthen and often ornamental jugs or decanters (s\u00e1rdhi); but of this caste nothing certain is known. The Tambolis derive their name from the Persian tambol, a leaf of the p\u00e1n creeper (Piper betel). Like the Bar\u00e1y\u00eds, from whom they are however quite distinct, they devote themselves to growing and selling this commodity. They sell also the betel-nut with which the p\u00e1n leaf is chewed.\n\nThe Telis are, as their name shows, pressers and vendors of oil (tel). Amongst the lower castes they occupy a fairly respectable position. According to Sir J. Malcolm, indeed, they number in their ranks some persons of R\u00e1jput descent. When Parasur\u00e1ma, he writes, began his war of extermination against the Kshatriyas, many of that race saved themselves by saying that they belonged to other classes. Resolved to punish the evasion which he suspected, the Br\u00e1hman demigod insisted that each questioned person should eat food with that tribe to which\n\n1 Essay on the Bhils (quoted in Beames\u2019 Elliot).\nhe assigned himself. Many ate food with the Tel\u00eds, and thereby degraded themselves into that caste. Tel\u00eds have more than the usual number of clans, whereof a few are these:\u2014the Bi\u00e1h\u00fat-bans, Jaunpuri, Kanaujiya, Ch\u00e1chara, Ban\u00e1rsiya, Gulhariya, Gulhani, Sri-b\u00e1stak, Jaisw\u00e1ra, Lahori and Khara. The Bi\u00e1h\u00fat-bansis, who do not permit the remarriage of their widows, rank highest; the Gulh\u00e1nis, perhaps, lowest. The Jaunpuri-tel\u00eds have given up the sale of oil and taken to that of pulses.\n\nOf the B\u00e1isw\u00e1rs, Binds, Gadhonias, J\u00e1jaks, Khampris, Khag\u00e1rs, Orhs, Ramaias, Rangw\u00e1rs, and Taskhars, nothing has as yet proved ascertainable.\n\nWe pass to the Musalm\u00e1ns, whom the census classes as Shaikhs (30,982), Path\u00e1ns (23,292), Sayyids (3,982), Mughals (1,301), Musalm\u00e1ns. \"without distinction\" (165,154), and miscellaneous (1,624).\n\nThe term Shaikh was at first restricted to the descendants of Muhammad's first four vicegerents (Kh\u00e1lifa) on earth. These princes were Ab\u00fabakr the Sincere (Sad\u00edk), Umr the Discriminator (Far\u00fak) between truth and falsehood, Usm\u00e1n and Ali Murtaza. From them are derived the names of the four original Shaikh clans Sad\u00edki, F\u00e1r\u00faki, Usm\u00e1ni and Ul\u00e1vi. The descendants of Abb\u00e1s, uncle of the Prophet, were formed into a fifth class known as Abb\u00e1si. But the term Shaikh has long ceased to bear its early meaning. \"The first change was,\" writes Mr. J. C. Williams, \"that it was claimed by, and gradually conceded to, all who were descendants of men converted to the faith during the reigns of the first four Khalf\u00e1s. Thus there are the Kuraishi Shaikhs, who are descended from Muhammad's tribe, the Kuraish; the Ans\u00e1ri Shaikhs or \"the helpers,\" so named because their ancestors were citizens of Mad\u00edna who assisted the prophet on his flight from Makka; the Murw\u00e1n\u00ed Shaikhs, who are (I believe) a subdivision of the Kuraishis; the Hajj\u00e1jis, who are descended from Hajj\u00e1j bin Y\u00fasuf, one of the princes of Ir\u00e1k; and the Milkis, probably the same as Maliks, who were originally a Persian tribe, though more recently the word has been also used as a title like Kh\u00e1n or Beg. In more modern times the title of Shaikh has been assumed in a wholesale manner by all converts to Isl\u00e1m; and is now borne by thousands of the lower classes of Muhammadans all over India.\"\n\nThe Path\u00e1ns are for the most part descendants of the Afgh\u00e1n invaders who have at different times overrun Northern India. They call themselves children of Israel; their descent\n\n\u00b9 Oudh Census Report, 1869. \u00b2 i.e., Malik.\nfrom that patriarch being traced through Saul and through Afghan, the grandson of Saul. According to Herklot they are divided into two principal tribes:\u2014Yusufzai or descendants of Joseph and Lodi or descendants of Lot. But a multitude of minor subdivisions might be mentioned.\n\nThough here less numerous than Shaikhs or Pathans, Sayyids are here and everywhere the most exalted of Muslims. Their name, which means lord, has found its way into western Europe; and under the form Cid is the familiar title of a great Spanish hero. Sayyids are descended from the martyrs Hasan and Husain, sons of Ali, the fourth caliph, by Fatima, daughter of the Prophet. Every Sayyid can boast that the blood of four out of these five holy persons (panj tan-i-pdk) flows in his veins. The primary subdivision of the tribe was that into descendants of Hasan (Hasani) and descendants of Husain (Husaini). But other clans, bearing as a rule territorial names, have arisen in later times. Such, for instance, are the Baghdadi and the Tabrizi. The descendants of Ali by his other wives are called Sayyids; but are distinguished from true Sayyids by the qualifying epithet Alivi. This same title of Sayyid can also, as elsewhere mentioned,1 be inherited through a mother. Such inheritance is an exception to the otherwise invariable rule amongst Muslims, that the children belong to the father's tribe.\n\nThe word Mughal formerly and properly denoted the Tatar conquerors of both Persia and India. But in the latter country it has for centuries been applied to the naturalized descendants of Persians as well as Tatars, of Iranians as well as Turanians. It is now therefore most usual to consider Mughals as divided into two great classes, the Irani and the Turani. Mughals tack to their names the titles Agha and Beg; while their women are known as Khanam. Similar titles are assumed by the other three classes of Muslims already described. The male Shaikh is indeed styled Shaikh simply; but his wife hears herself called Ma, Bi, and Bibi. The Pathan alone is rightly entitled to the suffix of Khan; for that distinction is said to have been a reward for valour, bestowed on the first Afghan converts by one of the Caliphs. Pathan women are addressed as Banu and Khatun. The Sayyid is often called Mir; while his womankind have the pick of several titles such as Begam, Bibi, Bi, and Shah.\n\nWhatever their tribe, the people of Basti may by \"alterative exclusion\" be divided into two classes. There are those who as landholders or husbandmen derive their living from the\n\n---\n\n1 Gazr, v., 295.\nsoil and those who do not. To the former class the last census allots 1,161,384 and to the latter 311,610 persons. The details are as follow:\n\n| Religion | Land-owners | Agriculturists | Non-agriculturists | Total |\n|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------------|-------|\n|          | Male.       | Female.        | Male.              | Female. | Male. | Female. | Male. | Female. |\n| Hind\u00fas   | 65,258      | 58,249         | 465,608            | 405,899 | 134,720 | 117,470 | 665,583 | 581,618 |\n| Musalm\u00e1ns| 5,472       | 4,995          | 82,355             | 78,547  | 31,275  | 28,140  | 119,102 | 106,682 |\n| Christians| 1           | 2              |                    |         | 4       | 1       | 6       | 3       |\n| Total    | 70,731      | 68,246         | 547,961            | 479,446 | 165,999 | 145,611 | 784,591 | 688,303 |\n\nThere are then 133,977 land-holders, 1,027,407 agriculturists, and 311,610 non-agriculturists. Basti is one of the few districts in which the census returns seem to show anything like a sufficiently large proportion of cultivators. The agricultural population supplies 78\u00b78 per cent. of the total. The density of the inhabitants per cultivated square mile is 631\u00b78 in the Domari\u00e1ganj, 675\u00b73 in the B\u00e1nsi, 919\u00b73 in the Haraia, 900\u00b74 in the Basti, and 840\u00b77 in the Khal\u00edlabad tahs\u00edl.\n\nProceeding to minuter subdivisions, and following the example of English population statements, the census distributes the inhabitants amongst six great classes\u2014(1) the professional or official, (2) the domestic, (3) the commercial, (4) the agricultural, (5) the industrial, and (6) the indefinite.\n\nThe first or professional class embraces all Government servants and persons following the learned professions or literature, artistic or scientific occupations. It numbered 5,230 male adults, amongst whom are included 227 parohits or family-priests, 545 pand\u00edts or doctors of Hindu divinity and law, 216 musicians, and so on. The second or domestic class numbered 21,913 members and comprised all males employed as private servants, washermen, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, innkeepers, and the like. The third or commercial numbered 11,230 males. Amongst these are all persons who buy or sell, keep or lend, money and goods of various kinds\u2014such as shopkeepers (5,814), usurers (758), bankers and brokers (462); and all persons engaged in the conveyance of men, animals, or goods, such as pack-carriers (165) and ekka or cart-drivers (253). The fifth or industrial class contains 34,988 members, including all persons engaged in the industrial arts and mechanics, such as dyers (100), masons (57), carpenters (3,013), and perfumers (2); those engaged in the manufacture of textile fabrics, such as weavers (5,622), tailors (1,553), and cotton-cleaners (2,101);\nthose engaged in preparing articles of food or drink, such as grain-parchers (1,156) and confectioners (1,204); and lastly, dealers in all animal, vegetable, or mineral substances. Of the fourth or agricultural class sufficient has been said already. The sixth or indefinite contains 37,296 members, including labourers (32,371), persons of independent means (1), and 132 persons supported by the community and of no specified occupation.\n\nOf the labourer class 4,520 persons (1,317 females) have during the past ten years (1870-79 inclusive) been registered for emigration beyond seas. The colonies to which they departed were, in order of popularity, British Guiana (Demerara), Trinidad, the French West Indies (Guadeloupe), Natal, Jamaica, Nevis, Mauritius, St. Vincent, Fiji, St. Lucia, and Grenada.\n\nThe number of parishes or townships inhabited by the population, agricultural and otherwise, is returned by the census as 6,911 or about 2\u00b74 to the square mile. Of these 6,821 have less than 1,000; 88 between 1,000 and 5,000; 2 (Basti and Menhd\u00e1wal) between 5,000 and 10,000; and none over 10,000 inhabitants. The number of parishes (mauza) on the revenue-roll now (1880) amounts to 7,524; and the number of estates (mah\u00e1l), as usual in this part of the country, coincides with that of the parishes. It may be explained that in most districts of these provinces the estates greatly outnumber the parishes; while in a few tracts, like south Mirz\u00e1pur, the parishes somewhat outnumber the estates. The village homestead is generally built on the highest ground in the parish, that is, on the spot least subject to inundation and damp.\n\nAs elsewhere in a country which has neither stone nor squires with a taste for model cottages, the people live chiefly in mud huts. The census, indeed, shows but 442 masonry structures against 247,826 dwellings built with unskilled labour. But it must be remembered that a good double-storied mud house, inhabited by some well-to-do landholder, is often a house of greater comfort than many a dilapidated brick mansion. As the standard of living is low, and large towns are altogether absent, the number of noteworthy abodes is far smaller than in more western districts. The old mud forts with which Basti was formerly studded have all but disappeared, and of modern masonry habitations few really deserve mention. Such, perhaps, are the R\u00e1ja's castle at Bans\u00ed, the homes of the Jag-dispur and Parward\u00e1ra landlords in tah\u00e1f\u00ed Hara\u00edla, and one or two others in the streets of Menhd\u00e1wal, Bakhira, Maghar, and Hariharpur.\n\n1 This is one of the Leeward Islands.\nAbout 1835, Buchanan speaks of tiled roofs as a comparatively recent introduction, which rustic prejudice often eschewed as unlucky. It has been already noticed that in Gorakhpur such roofs have become the rule. In Basti they are still the exception, or, if that term be deemed too strong, the minority. The thatching most often consists of long grass or reeds, which make a neater and tidier roof than rice-straw. Rafters and laths are seldom used, the thatch being supported by the walls and by a single beam crossing from one gable-end to the other. Roofs of leaves, pegged together with bambu splints, are almost as obsolete as the wicker or brushwood walls which they generally covered. The ordinary dwelling is, as just mentioned, the mudhut. It contains, as a rule, but one room. Its walls are from 5 to 10 feet high and from $1\\frac{1}{2}$ to 3 feet thick. The outer surface of those walls is often adorned with a line or lines of handmarks, the hand being dipped in whitewash, and the wall stamped with the open palm. \"This,\" writes Buchanan, \"is considered as a very decent ornament for the house of a person of high rank and easy circumstances, and, in comparison of the cakes of cowdung that more usually occupy such situations, must be admitted as a great improvement.\" Mr. Thomson gives the average ground dimensions as 30 feet by 15, and the usual number of inmates as from 5 to 7. The interior is far cleaner than might be expected from the slovenly look of the outside. Whitewash and paint are seldom if ever used; but the walls are sometimes plastered with a solution of cowdung. The huts are huddled together in a manner which renders fires highly destructive. The best class of village dwelling is a two-storied quadrangle, enclosing a court or yard (sahan or chauk). Though of mud, its walls often rest on brick foundations. The cost of building the usual thatched mud cottage ranges from Rs. 10 to 15. A tiled house of a better kind, such as would be inhabited by the village grain-dealer, might be raised for Rs. 300. Its dimensions would be about 41 feet by 33; and it would have a sort of vestibule or veranda (ddil\u00e1n), which might serve as a shop. And here it may be mentioned that an ordinary villager's cottage is called ghar, a tradesman's house kothi or duk\u00e1n, a land-holder's dwelling bakhri, and a raja's castle kot.\n\nIf the houses of men are mostly mud-built, those of the gods are mostly built of brick. Above have been given sketches of the principal forms of Hindu temple. A th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra, a temple sacred to Krishna, the incarnation of Vishnu, may be raised for about Rs. 3,000. Its exterior is not unlike that of a well-built house, and it has in\n\n---\n\n1 Above, p. 368.\n2 Fp. 369-70.\nthis respect at least a far less specially sacred appearance than the cheaper shiv\u00e1la or temple of Shiva, which costs from Rs. 2,000 to Rs. 2,500. Mah\u00e1-deo-asth\u00e1ns and K\u00e1li-chauras, small shrines dedicated to the god last named and his consort, may be found in every village. They most often consist of a small mud-built plinth, surmounted by little idols; and are sometimes protected by a canopy of thatch or tiles. They are much frequented by all classes of H\u00ednd\u00fas, and especially on the outbreak of small-pox or similar epidemics. Small-pox, indeed, is always ascribed to the wrath of the malevolent goddess, and after her is named devi. One of the best known temples in the district is that of Tegdhar at B\u00e1nsi. This was founded in 1767-68 by r\u00e1ja Bhagwant Singh, and derives additional reverence from the fact that one of the sacred figs known as p\u00edpal has grown through its walls. The Muhammadan mausolea (makbara, rauza), mosques (masjid) and other places of worship (im\u00e1mb\u00e1ra, idg\u00e1h), present in this district no unusual features. Cheapest in construction is perhaps the idg\u00e1h, which according as it is built of mud or brick may cost from Rs. 55 to Rs. 750. On the great mosque at Maghar, the principal building of its class in the district, were spent about three centuries ago some Rs. 50,000. At Maghar, too, are the tombs of Kab\u00edr and K\u00e1zi Abd-ur-Rahm\u00e1n. But some account of all these buildings will be found in the Gazetteer article on Maghar. The district has but one Christian Church, that of the Church Mission at Basti.\n\nFrom the buildings that shelter the people let us turn to the clothes that cover them. And here we cannot do better than quote Buchanan, who wrote at a time when Europeans had a more intimate acquaintance with such matters than at present. His remarks are probably as true to-day as they were before the ink with which they were written was dry; for in India changes of fashion are almost unknown. Speaking first of female attire, he says:\n\n\"The petticoat (lahnga) is fully as much in use as in Bih\u00e1r; but the bodice (kurta) and veil (orhai) are confined to a few young women of the Muhammadan faith or R\u00e1jput tribe. Nor do any Hind\u00fas but the women of the Khatri and Agarw\u00e1la tribes adopt the drawers (f\u00e1s\u00e9r) of the Muhammadans; and even these (it is alleged) do so only when they go on private intrigues, to which they are said to be much addicted. The gown (peshw\u00e1z) is confined to less than 200g of the chief Muhammadan families and to the dancing-girls. The Hindu women, who wear a petticoat, use also a wrapper (adr\u00fat) which covers their head and body, but does not entirely conceal the face; at least all young women contrive to show theirs as they pass. Besides the lahnga and s\u00e1ri, in cold weather they use often a mantle or ch\u00e1dar. The petticoat is always coloured and\n\n1 Or 1175 of Akbar's harvest (f\u00e1sil) era. 3 It must be remembered that this figure includes Gorakhpur as well as Basti.\nmost commonly checkered. Those most valuable are of pure silk and cotton mixed, from M\u0101l\u0101da, and usually here called atlas. Then come those made of tasar silk and cotton, which are called gangam or gingam, and are made in the country between the Ganges and Gh\u0101ghra. The coarsest petticoats are made of cotton entirely in the same part of the country, and have various hard names according to their pattern. The longer wrapper (dh\u014dti) worn with the petticoat is always of cotton, and of various fineness according to the rank of the wearer. The finer ones are always bleached; and both fine and coarse are sometimes dyed, especially at marriages. Widows of pure birth are not allowed to use the petticoat; but the widows of low castes, who are in the expectation of becoming concubines, continue to use this indulgence. Those who use the coarse petticoat are in better circumstances than those who use the wrapper alone; so that it seems to have been chiefly the want of means that has preserved the original Hindu dress among the women. The female wrapper, when of full size, is here called dh\u014dti; which term in Bih\u0101r and Bengal is confined to the male dress, while the female wrapper of full size is there called \u0101shri. Many however cannot afford this, and must use not only a small wrapper (khilua), but that composed of several pieces sewed together, which is an abomination with the Hind\u016bs. So that every woman of rank, when she eats, cooks or prays, must lay aside her petticoat and retain only the wrapper made without the use of scissors or needle.\n\n\"The men also have chiefly preserved the Hindu dress from want of means to purchase the Muhamadan; for every one who can possibly procure a full dress (jora) by begging or borrowing uses it at marriages. The number who can afford to appear in this dress at visits of ceremony (darb\u0101r) is however very small, and very few can afford shawls. Many in visits adopt the more common Muhamadan dress (Hindust\u0101ni posh); but in ordinary almost every one uses the old Hindu fashion of a wrapper and turban, with a small mantle for the cold season. Even those Hind\u016bs who cannot afford the wrapper of a full size use the turban, although many have it of a pitiful size. But it must be observed that some old tribes, such as the Musahar, do not use this part of dress, which here, however, is more general than in any part that I have seen, even the pandits and men dedicated to religion wearing it; while in most parts they either go bareheaded or use a cap with flaps coming over their ears, such as we see in the old sculptures of Egyptian priests. The turban I have no doubt is of Persian origin. The Muslims at home use a small conical cap; and some of the scribes, who have studied Persian, are beginning to imitate them in this economy.\n\n\"In the cold season all who can afford it have quilts which they wrap round them, night and day, when cold. Those who are easy use quilts of chints (rasd\u012b) or of coloured cotton cloth (lihdf). Those who are poorer use quilts which when new are white (sufed\u012b) but are never washed. Those who cannot procure such quilts use those made of rag (gadri). But such are chiefly used by the low castes, who also use blankets; while those of pure birth, who cannot procure raz\u0101is or sufed\u012bs, use only a single (chadar) or double sheet (gillf, khol, or dohar). They use blankets for bedding, but never as a covering. The low castes, who use the blanket, always (?) have a sheet under it. In cold weather the women use little more covering than in the hot; the greater quantity of fat, with which women are provided, rendering them less susceptible of cold than\n\n1 Generally translated satin. The custom of mixing silk and cotton may perhaps have been introduced by the Muslims; for their prophet forbade his followers to pray in pure silk. Hence a mixture of silk and cotton is sometimes called mashr\u016b, or \"the lawful.\" 2 The tasar or kos (Antherea Paphia) is a kind of wild silkworm found in the forests of these provinces and elsewhere. 3 So its name, a corruption or turra-band, would seem to imply. The first part of this compound, turva, means the brocaded or fringed end of a turban cloth. Though originally Arabic, the word became naturalized in Persia.\nmen are. On the whole, the clothing here is fully as coarse and rather more scanty than in Bih\u00e1r and Sh\u00e1habad. But I do not think that it is quite so dirty, a great many having their linen bleached and cleaned by the washermen.\n\n\"Most of the men and of the Muhammadan women wear shoes; but very few of the low Hindu women use sandals. This, however, seems to be more from economy than aversion; as the women of the chief families, who can afford to live idle and in luxury, use the gaudy slippers made after the Patna fashion. Ornaments of lac are confined to the women of the tribes called Cham\u00e1r, Dom, and Dos\u00e1h, in the very dregs of impurity. The numerous tribe of Ahirs use the base metals, brass, bell-metal, and tin. The other tribes wear, almost all, ornaments of glass, with some of the metals according to their rank and circumstances. Some tribes of R\u00e1jputs never use the base metals, although even the Br\u00e1hm\u00e1ns use them on their legs and arms. By far the greater part of the women have at least a ring of gold in their nose; and perhaps 200 families have their women fully bedecked with the precious metals. Four or five families have coral, pearls, and diamonds. The ornaments of glass are however considered the proper ones to women of rank while in the prime of youth and beauty. And here it is these alone that widows are compelled to lay aside.\n\n\"Men very seldom anoint themselves with oil except at marriages and as a remedy for disease. The women more or less frequently, according to their station, anoint their heads with oil and paint their foreheads with red lead (send\u00e1r). This even by young beauties is seldom done oftener than twice a week, and by old ladies it is practised seldomer. A bit of coloured glass is pasted between the eyes at the same time, and is not disturbed by washing until the next day of ornaments. Their heads of course cannot be washed in the intervals. The washing of their forehead at any time is considered very disgraceful, and the alleging such an action considered a term of great reproach. For widows of rank are not allowed to paint, and the washing off the paint is considered an expression of a desire for the husband's death.\u00b9 Virgins are not allowed to paint; it would be considered too glaring a declaration of their desire to attract the notice of men. The eyes of bridegrooms are blackened; but no other males are guilty of this affectation after the age of infancy. For the women, when they blacken their own eyes (which is only done occasionally), apply some to those of their children. Most of the women are more or less tattooed, although the operation is by no means considered indispensable; and men of rank have no scruples in drinking from the hand of a nymph whose skin is without spot. The lower women, however, take a great deal of pains in adorning their skins with various figures.\n\n\"It is usual amongst the natives of India to cover themselves day and night with the same clothing. At night the turban and such ornaments as would incommode are laid aside; but no other material change takes place. The bedding therefore consists of what is intended to enable them to lie easily. Those who have the best kind of bedsteads, made by a carpenter, all the parts of which have received some degree of polish, have usually a bad mattress and some pillows covered with a sheet. Curtains are never used by the natives of this district, although several Bengalis have shown them the example. All the other bedsteads are of the rude kind called khatiya, which are mere rude sticks tied together, with a bottom of coarse ropes interwoven to support the bedding. This in some cases consists of a blanket and sheet, or of a carpet or rug. In other cases the bedding is a coarse mat or some straw. Many however cannot afford these luxuries, and sleep on the ground; spreading on this a coarse mat of k\u00e1sa or ganduri under which in winter\n\n\u00b9 Buchanan might have added that in some castes the bridegroom himself paints the parting (ming) of his bride's hair. Hence perhaps the idea that in washing the paint off the wife wishes for her husband's death.\n\n\u00b2 Fragrant grasses.\nis spread some straw. Religious mendicants are not allowed the use of bedsteads; but use good bedding, that is blankets or carpets. And many old infirm persons prefer the ground, as giving them less trouble.\"\n\nTheir beds and their cooking utensils are as a rule the only furniture which the people possess. Nothing need therefore prevent us from passing to their last and most important necessary of life\u2014that is food. The impecunious classes confine their diet chiefly to parched wheat (charban), the porridge (sattu) of various grains, peas, barley, lentils-pottage (mas\u00far-d\u00e1l), the s\u00e1w\u00e1n and k\u00e1kun millets, coarse rice and mahua berries. When food is cheap, writes one of the tahsild\u00e1rs, a poor man can live on half an anna a day; but the amount of salt and oil which he can consume for that sum must be lamentably small. His richer neighbours eat the finer rices, the arhar and m\u00e1lsh pulses, wheat, potatoes and other vegetables, curds, fish, and in some cases flesh. Their food is, moreover, flavoured with clarified butter (gh\u00e1t), salt, and sometimes with turmeric, capsicum or other spices.\n\nIt will be seen then that the staple diet is as usual grain. According to Buchanan's calculations, the daily weight of rice or meal consumed by a member of the luxurious classes would be 1\u00bd lb.; and by a labourer, 2 lb. It is not mentioned whether the term grain includes the usual allowance of pulse; but in any case the amount seems overstated.\u00b9 Rice is eaten either boiled (bh\u00e1t) or parched (l\u00e1wa and ch\u00fara). According to the manner in which it is ground, wheat yields three kinds of flour or meal, \u00e1t\u00e1, st\u00faji, and maida. From these are made the unleavened bannock (chap\u00e1ti) of the country and divers kinds of cakes, biscuits, and sweet-meats. Thus, a cake made with wheat-flour and clarified butter is called p\u00fari; with the former and milk, sh\u00edrm\u00e1l; and with flour, butter, and milk, b\u00e1karkh\u00e1na. The half-ripe grain is parched into charban, elsewhere known as chubena. Parched or parboiled barley is called ard\u00e1wa. Barley-water (ashjau) is prepared for medicinal purposes by twice boiling the grain, kneading it, and straining therefrom the liquor. The latter is before drinking sugared. The peas of the gram vetch are ground into besan, while its leaves and pods (\u00e1ti) are sold as vegetables. Vegetables themselves are generally eaten in the form of curry. In such messes a good many onions are used by Muslims, and a good deal of garlic by low Hind\u00fas.\n\nThe quantity of meat consumed is very small. Inferior goat's-flesh and mutton is eaten by Musalm\u00e1ns and the meaner Hindu castes. Meat offered in sacrifice seems sometimes\n\n\u00b9 See Gazetteer, V., 300, where the average daily consumption of a labourer is shown to be about 23 oz. of grain + 4 of pulse; and Eastern India, II., 424.\nconsidered lawful food for Hindus of a higher order; and even Rajputs eat hares and venison slaughtered in the chase. But the flesh chiefly devoured is that of the pigs sacrificed by the outcaste tribes, Chamars, Doms, Khatiks, and others. Except, perhaps, at Basti or Menhdawal, no butcher would find a trade. It has been already noted that almost all classes, except those prevented by religious vows, eat fish.\n\nMilk is a far scarcer article of diet than might be expected from the multitude of cattle. This fact is partly due to an unwillingness to deprive the calves of their drink. From the curds here used the butter has been already extracted; but curds are the regular food of the richer classes only. Gh\u00ed or clarified butter is an important element in both the daily fare of the rich and the rarely occurring feasts of the poor. The oils employed in the cookery are the mustard, the linseed, the sesamum, and the mahua. The amount of oil consumed daily by a family of ten persons varies, according to their means, from 10 to 136 ozs. avoirdupois. But this estimate, which is furnished by Buchanan, includes the small quantity burnt in what the poverty of the English language compels us to call their lamps (chiragh). The fragrant oil of sesamum is an ingredient in laddu, tilwa, reori, and other sweetmeats.\n\nExcept by the wealthy sweetmeats are seldom eaten. Sugar is most often tasted in its earliest stage of refinement, in the coarse treacly form known as gur or compost. The weight of salt consumed by a family of ten persons ranges, according to the authority last quoted, from 2:15 to 9:8 ozs. daily. But the amount must of course vary with the manner in which salt duties are levied. In Buchanan's day the salt here eaten paid no duty save the transit-tolls of the Oudh Government. Spirits and toddy are copiously drunk, even by classes who profess not to drink them. Tobacco is not only smoked but taken in the form of snuff and chewed. Four pipes (huqqa) of mixed tobacco and gur sugar are considered a fair daily allowance for a smoker. In the practice of chewing, whether the quid be tobacco or betel-leaf, the men are assisted by the women.\n\nThe total weight of food-grain produced in the district is by Mr. Buck fixed at 390,000 tons. Allowing the population a diet of 18 ounces per head, he reckons that 282,000 tons are consumed in the district itself. If, then, these figures be correct, there remains for export a balance of 108,000 tons.\n\n1 Answers to Chap. I. of the Famine Commission's Questions, 1878.\nFrom the food of the people to their customs. The *panch\u00e1yat*, the council which serves as both court of honour and trades-union committee, is as common here as elsewhere.\n\nBut little need be added to the remarks already made on this institution in other district notices. Amongst the Br\u00e1hmans, the R\u00e9jputs, and the classes who ape their habits it is, as already said, unknown. It is the jury of the low Hindu castes and of the low Muslim tribes who have not yet discarded the Hindu habits of their forefathers. The following list is not exhaustive, but at least shows with what classes the panch\u00e1yat is most popular:\u2014Arakhs, Baniyas of diverse races, Bar\u00e1is, Barha\u00eds, P\u00e1ris, Bold\u00e1rs, Bh\u00e1rs, Bharbhunjas, Bh\u00e1ts, Bhati\u00e1ras, Cham\u00e1rs, Daf\u00e1lis or drummers, Darzis, Dh\u00e1rhis, -Dhobis, Dhunt\u00e1s, Gararias, Hajj\u00e1ms, Hal\u00e1lkhors, Halw\u00e1is, Jul\u00e1has, Kah\u00e1rs, Kalw\u00e1rs, Khat\u00edks, Khewats, Kharw\u00e1rs, Kumh\u00e1rs, Kunjras, Lodhas, Loh\u00e1rs, Lunias or Nuni\u00e1s, M\u00e1lis, Mall\u00e1hs, Maim\u00e1rs, P\u00e1sis, Sun\u00e1rs, Telis, Thatheras, and Turhas.\n\nWhen any one belonging to any of these castes transgresses the rules of the tribe or trade, pilfers, or breaks the VIIth commandment, he is summoned and tried by an assembly of the brotherhood. A conviction discastes him; but honour and caste may be regained by payment of a fine (*t\u00e1v\u00e1n*), by a dinner given to the brotherhood, by hearing read the Bh\u00e1gavat Gita, by going on a pilgrimage, or by bathing in a holy river. The president or *chaudhari* of the panch\u00e1yat is elected by the members of the caste. He is, to some extent, a censor, seeking and receiving reports on the trespasses of his brethren. As an ensign of his office, he wears a peculiar turban. Amongst certain trades, or trades which are also castes, there exist hereditary chaudharis. But these are masters of a guild rather than presidents of a judicial council. Thus, the Bakk\u00e1ls, carters, and Kah\u00e1rs of different towns have foremen, with whom Government deals in making commissariat or transport arrangements. For their trouble they receive a commission on the earnings or sales of the trade. But though, as a matter of convenience, Government makes use of these chaudharis, it has long withdrawn from all interference in their appointment.\n\nPanch\u00e1yats or their foremen are sometimes concerned in the morganatic re-marriage (*sag\u00e1di*) of widows or discarded wives.\n\nThough the re-marriage of Hindu widows was legalized by Act XV. of 1856, the upper castes have never countenanced the practice. But by the low tribes who adopt panch\u00e1yats such second unions are\n\n---\n\n1 See Gazetteer, IV., 283-87 (Et\u00e1wa); V., 50-81 (Bud\u00e1un); supra p. 77 (Cawnpore); and supra 367 (Gorakhpur).\n\n2 The word \"discarded\" has been preferred to the word \"divorced\" because divorce is unrecognized by Hindu law, and except for persons professing Christianity, by the legislature. But there is no doubt that divorces, under whatever name may be preferred, are decreed by the panch\u00e1yats of the lower castes.\nfully recognised. They need be called morganatic only because the Hindu law, the customs of the upper castes as explained by themselves, forbids widows to re-marry. In Buchanan's time the children of these despised alliances inherited six-sixteenths of their father's property; and a proportion of ten-sixteenths was considered quite sufficient to show the slight superiority possessed by the offspring of the regular marriage. Nor is it to the re-marriage of women alone that Hind\u00fas of the higher classes are opposed. In most of these castes it is neither usual nor respectable for a man to take a second wife if he has had male issue by the first. But \"some rich men,\" writes Buchanan, \"indulge themselves; nor is any punishment or atonement thought necessary. The two wives, indeed, in general take care that the sufferings of the man should be adequate to his fault.\" Unmarried women, he adds, or widows who have not remarried, lose caste by having children. And \"although the Hindu law prohibits the capital punishment of women, the custom, from time immemorial until the British Government, permitted the near relations to put to death any female that disgraced them.\" If a girl be not married before she is physically nubile, it is deemed to disgrace the relations; and the wedding is therefore a mere betrothal. Nuptials take place chiefly in the beginning of the summer, when the harvesting of the crops has left the people free for such festivities. In the cookery of marriage feasts milk is perhaps the principal element; and it is urged as an objection against winter weddings that in the cold weather milk is hard to procure. An eldest son cannot be married in the month of Jeth (May-June), and it may be added that he cannot marry an eldest daughter.\n\nWedding expenses are as usual heavy, but funeral expenses are light.\n\nFunerals.\n\nExcept at the last rites of rajas and other celebrities, the reading of a funeral service is rare. Unless the family be rich, it seldom cares to reduce its corpses to ashes. After more or less singeing the body is committed to some river. According as the rank of the mourners is high or low, the mourning lasts from 10 to 30 days; and for at least the former period the family of the deceased is considered unclean. During the ten days of sorrow a pitcher may often be observed hanging from some sacred tree in the neighbourhood of the dead man's house. This contains water, and sometimes other viaticum, for his soul's journey. A small saucer bearing a lighted wick is occasionally placed in the same umbrageous position. This is intended to help the poor ghost along the dark road to Hades (Jampuri); and the ceremony of its suspension is called the lamp-giving (dipd\u00e1n). While the mourning lasts ten votive rice-balls (pinda) are thrown\ninto the river which received the corpse or its ashes. When that mourning is over an offering is made to the funeral priests (Mah\u00e1br\u00e1hman, Mah\u00e1p\u00e1tra), and the obsequies known as sr\u00e1ddh are performed. If the mourners can afford it, they give a cow to the Br\u00e1hmans. If they be poor they give four annas, which the fiction of the occasion deems the price of a cow.\\(^1\\) The commemoration (tithi, sapind\u00ed-sr\u00e1ddh) of deceased parents and grand-parents is observed yearly. On these occasions rice-balls are again offered. The funeral priests are a degraded class who must not be confused with true Br\u00e1hmans. A sneering phraseology sometimes styles them crow (Karathaha) Br\u00e1hmans, because like crows they flock round the carcass. But though their association with corpses keeps them in almost perpetual uncleanliness, their nominal status is high. In days of Hindu rule they were exempt from capital punishment; and Hindu sacerdotalism affects to regard them as greater than rajas.\n\nThe religion of the people is a subject on which at the first glance nothing would seem left to be said. Its main features are those already noticed in accounts of other districts. Christianity has as yet proved little more than an exotic. A handful of British inhabitants represents the Church of England; while a few Native Christians of the usual unenquiring type pass their lives under the paternal rule of the Church Mission.\\(^2\\) How sluggish the zeal of their class may perhaps be proved by the fact that it has never yet produced a fresh sect. Nor, in Basti, is the zeal of Isl\u00e1m much livelier. The fire of early Muslim conquest had burnt low before the Muslims invaded this district. Their temporal hold on Basti was never strong enough to impress the country strongly with their spiritual character. But the remote tract across the Gh\u00e1gra was not altogether unstirred by the fanatical thrill of the Wahh\u00e1b\u00ed revival. In tappa Uji\u00e1r of parganah Maghar, the earliest stronghold of the Muhammadans, lies a block of villages belonging to Muhammadan converts from Hinduism. For their rebellion in 1858, members of this community forfeited to Government land assessed with a revenue of Rs. 2,378 yearly; and in the midst of their little Isl\u00e1m, by one of their brotherhood, was about the same time founded a school of distinctly Wahh\u00e1b\u00ed character. This seminary at Karrhi may be small; but its reputation is apparently wide. The frequent visits which it received from wandering Musalm\u00e1n foreigners led, in 1880, to a visit from the magistrate; who, amongst its 18 pupils, found students from Bettiah, Nepal, Balr\u00e1mpur,\n\n\\(^1\\) Buchanan says that these 4 annas \"are called\" the price of a cow. But may he not have mistaken gdudd\u00edn for gau-ka-d\u00e1m? \\(^2\\) Some 30 Native Christians inhabit the Nay\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r suburb of Basti. But these, writes Mr. Powlett, are \"temporarily resident only; being without exception employees of the Mission.\"\nand Faizabad. For the blessings of gratuitous board, lodging, and instruction these pupils are indebted to the surrounding landlords, who support the school by the willing and regular contribution of one ser in every maund's weight of garnered grain. In a notice of this kind literary perspective cannot be sacrificed by devoting any further space to the minor religions. But, as already shown by census statistics, an overwhelming majority of the inhabitants are Hindus. And of these Hind\u00fas much remains to be written.\n\nThe Hindu of Basti is not bigoted, and readily reveres any god that is made Hinduism, Vishnu and with bands. But as might be expected in the neighbourhood of Ajudhya, R\u00e1ma and his wife S\u00edta are the principal objects of worship. Just as R\u00e1ma was Vishnu incarnate in the Solar race, so was Krishna R\u00e1ma incarnate in the Lunar.\u00b9 But the Lunar race is not strongly represented in Basti. Krishna is little worshipped and his wife R\u00e1dha less. Vishnu himself, that preserving deity of whom R\u00e1ma and Krishna were mere emanations, has many votaries; but they belong chiefly to the R\u00e1m\u00e1nandi sect, described once for all in the Et\u00e1wa notice. The idols which represent this god are as a rule named Vasudev or Chatarbhuj; and he is adored also under the form of an ammonite (s\u00e1ligr\u00e1mi). Such fossils are common enough on the banks of the Great Gandak or S\u00e1ligr\u00e1mi, just before its entry into Gorakhpur; and to reach Basti they have therefore not far to travel.\n\nBut though Vishnu as R\u00e1ma has the largest number of adorers, Shiva is the god of the upper castes. It is from Br\u00e1hmans, Rajputs, and other wearers of the sacred thread that the destroying deity receives most propitiation. These classes are supposed to be instructed in the meaning of two mysterious texts, which seem, however, to have had no original connection with Shiva. The first is the G\u00e1yatri, the most holy verse of the Vedas.\u00b2 On assuming the sacred thread the youth may learn it from any who can teach him; but by most it is soon forgotten. The second text, from the Tantras, can be taught only by the person adopted as priestly director. It is therefore called the Gurumukhi;\u00b3 and when a director is appointed he is vulgarly said to blow into his disciple's ear. As, once appointed, he often proves troublesome, many prefer to postpone learning the Gurumukhi until well advanced in years. The director is often an Atith, a member that is of the sect which makes the phallic emblem (linga) of Shiva its special charge. Without knowing much of his writings, this class professes to follow the\n\n\u00b9 It has not been forgotten that Krishna is sometimes given, on his father's side, a solar pedigree; but it is as member of a lunar dynasty, the J\u0101dons of Mathura, that he is chiefly celebrated.\n\u00b2 Translated by Colebrooke: \"Let us meditate the adorable light of the Divine Ruler; may it guide our intellects.\"\n\u00b3 From guru, a priestly director, and mukh, a mouth.\ndoctrine of a sage named Shankara. The worship of Shiva's consort or shakti is said to have been introduced after the introduction of British rule. Her names of Devi and Bhaw\u00e1ni were already known; but her sudden popularity was due to the rumour that she was the god whose favour had raised the English to power. Of her son Ganesha there are many idols; but except when perched over a door, he appears as a mere attendant on his father Shiva.\n\nThe village gods or demons (gr\u00e1myadevata), here called Dih or Dihw\u00e1r, are perhaps as extensively worshipped as any of those already mentioned. But their worship is almost always subsidiary to that of some greater deity. Few put their trust in the village gods alone. Almost every old village can show, on the mound beneath some shady tree, the shrine or sth\u00e1n of one of these divinities. It is said that they were once anonymous; but at the present day it is the fashion to name them after some god or some ancient local hero. Their priests are mostly of mean caste, and as often as not Cham\u00e1rs or Dos\u00e1dhs. From these ignoble servants the village-gods receive, at harvest-home, the swine and spirits purchased by the contributions of the villagers. But when the shrine is sacred to a great hero, the priest is often a member of that hero's caste. When it is named after some god who could not with decency receive a public offering of pork, the low-born priest performs the oblation in the privacy of his own hut. From the fact that they are tended chiefly by men of aboriginal race, it may be inferred that the Dihw\u00e1rs are a survival of the days when the demonolatry of the Mlechhas had not yet yielded to the purer Br\u00e1hmanism of the early Aryans. Members of the higher castes still avoid the Dihw\u00e1r; and when the fear of some ghastly epidemic has driven them to his shrine, ascribe the act to the solicitations of their women. In Bengal and southern India the Br\u00e1hmans are still said to hold his worship impious. Here, however, no actual objections are raised to his propitiation. At marriages the Br\u00e1hman himself sends, through that god's own priest, an offering to the village god. But the wily Br\u00e1hman has for many decades been supplanting the old Dihw\u00e1rs with village-gods of his own creation, with \"ghosts vastly more powerful and mischievous than those of the low fellows who had hitherto enjoyed the spoil.\" These modern deities are called Br\u00e1hma Devatas, and are provided with hereditary Br\u00e1hman priests. For the lumps of clay which represented the Dihw\u00e1rs have been substituted the images of popular divinities.\n\n1 Eastern India, II., 477. 2 The term Dihw\u00e1r is more properly applied to the mounds sacred to these gods than to the gods themselves.\nInstead of the swine and the spirits, of the rough statuettes of elephants and horses, are offered burnt sacrifices of coarse sugar and clarified butter.\n\nThe principal religious festivals are the Holi, the N\u00e1gpanchami, the Janamashtami, the Nandashtami, the Diw\u00e1li, and the Dasahra.\n\nHoli\n\nThe first falls on the full moon of Ph\u00e1lgun (February-March), when sacrifices of the kind last mentioned are offered to all the gods, with a view of their saving the people from the malevolent demon Dhundha. But for at least 15 days before, and often for eight days after, is held a kind of carnival. Obscene and abusive songs are sung by all; but the rich sometimes hire the singers. Women assemble together in houses, and are said to defile their lips with even greater indecencies than the men. For the former it is the festival of the Bona Dea; for the latter, the Saturnalia. Even sacred names come in for their share of abuse; and in order to vex his followers, the orthodox vilify Kab\u00edr. But the principal feature of the Holi is the red dye or powder with which, on the forenoon succeeding the great sacrifice, the people squirt or pelt one another. For weeks afterwards traces of the romp may be noticed on the garments of even those who claim a respectable position. At the close of the festival each prays to his favourite god; while the wealthier householders give a feast to their family and servants.\n\nThe N\u00e1gpanchami, or \"fifth of the serpents,\" is the fifth of the bright half of S\u00e1wan (July-August). It is probably a relic of snake-worship. Having bathed in the morning, the head of the family paints on the wall of his sleeping-room two rude figures of serpents, makes offerings to Br\u00e1hmans, and feasts his household. The Janamashtami, or \"eighth of the nativity,\" is a sort of Hindu Christmas, commemorating the birth of Krishna. The feast falls on the eighth of the dark half of Bh\u00e1don (August-September). In the same month, but on the eighth of the bright half, occurs the Nandashtami or Dadh\u00edkhand. This derives its first name from Nanda, the adoptive father of Krishna, who is said to have founded the festival; but that festival would appear to commemorate the destruction of certain demons (r\u00e1kshasa) by the goddess Devi. The people fast, burn lights before the images of Krishna or of R\u00e1ma, and make offerings. After this many take a good meal; and the night is passed in singing and music. On the following morning the roads resound with drumming, shouts, and the applause which rewards some vigorous dancing; while the throng is besprinkled with mixed water, curds, and turmeric. The Diw\u00e1lt is the birthday of Lakshmi, the wife of Vishnu and the goddess of wealth. It falls on the new moon of K\u00e1rttik (October-November), and is chiefly remarkable for the illuminations which brighten the streets at night. The agency\nemployed is simple. Nothing is required save a host of small wicks in small earthen saucers of oil. But the effect, when every storey sparkles with its rows of wee flame, is surprisingly fair; nor is the smell, when a thousand lights expire, less surprisingly foul. To the agriculturist the Diwali is a sort of settling-day, on which he must pay back the loans borrowed for his autumn cultivation. The Dasahra, which occurs in the preceding month (Aswin, Ku\u00e1r, September-October) on the tenth of the bright half, celebrates the victory of R\u00e1ma over R\u00e1vana, the giant king of Ceylon. Its eve, the ninth of the bright half, is known as the R\u00e1milla; and commemorates the exile and other events which preceded R\u00e1m\u00e1's accession. It should be noted that there is an earlier Dasahra, the tenth of the bright half of Jeth (May-June). Another festival connected with R\u00e1ma is his birthday, the R\u00e1mnauami, or ninth of the bright half of Chait (March-April).\n\nSuch are some of the features which most strongly mark the face of popular Hinduism. But amongst the Hind\u00fas there exist sects which, however degenerate, vaunt the guidance of a more refined and refining doctrine. There are others whose professed scorn for worldly pleasures leads them to set at defiance not only the comforts but also the decencies of life. The R\u00e1m\u00e1nandis, Kab\u00edranthis, Sikhs, Jains, S\u00e1dhus, Jogis, Bair\u00e1gis, and Sani\u00e1sis have found description in other notices. It remains to devote some brief space to the At\u00edths, R\u00e1dh\u00e1b\u00e1l-labh\u00eds, and Aghorpanthis.\n\nThe At\u00edths or At\u00edts are Shaivas who derive their name from the Sanskrit Att\u00e1, \"passed away,\" or \"freed from worldly cares and feelings.\" They are nominally a sub-division of the Dasn\u00e1mis, who are again a branch of the ascetic order known as Dandi. It should be explained that the Dandis or wand-bearers are the only legitimate modern representatives of the fourth or mendicant stage of life prescribed by Manu for all Br\u00e1hmans. Those Dandis who follow the precepts of Shankara or Shankar\u00e1ch\u00e1rya are divided into ten branches, and therefore called Dasn\u00e1mi or ten-named. But of these ten branches only three and a half maintain the purity deemed needful for true Dandis; and the backsliding majority, the V\u00e1nas, Aranyas, Puris, P\u00e1rvatis, Giris, S\u00e1garas, and part of the Bh\u00e1ratis, are styled At\u00edths. How the At\u00edths have lost their original sanctity is perhaps shown by the fact that they often lead luxurious family lives. They abstain no doubt from trade, and they affect the character of the religious sage. But\n\n1 For R\u00e1m\u00e1nandis or R\u00e1m\u00e1vata, see Gazr., IV., 390-92, for Kab\u00edranthis and Sikhs or N\u00e1naksh\u00e1his, ibid., 568-65; for Janis, Gazr., III., 467-99; for S\u00e1dhus or Satyan\u00e1mis, supra 73-74; for Jogis, Bair\u00e1gis and Sani\u00e1sis, Gazr., V., 591-92.\nsuch behaviour cannot conceal the blot of their departure from the rugged paths of celibacy and asceticism. The few who remain truly celibate are deemed sure of re-absorption into the divine essence, and are therefore called Nirv\u00e2ni; but the ordinary unmarried Atith is too often suspected of sensual indulgence. All places occupied by Atiths, whether married or bachelor, are called monasteries (math); and if inhabited by a prior (mahant) of the order, receive also the name of thrones (gadi). To the Atiths belong almost all the temples of Shiva and some of those sacred to his consort. Each temple lies within the jurisdiction of some prior, who appoints its priest (puj\u00e2ri). Such priests, and the heads of inferior houses, are chosen from the band of pupils (chela) attached to each prior. As pupils they often pass their lives in pilgrimage; and when once beneficed, they are supposed to send the prior all profits not required for their own subsistence. Before death the prior appoints one of his past or present pupils to succeed him, and the installation of the new chief is solemnized by the priors of neighbouring houses. The Atiths are in general quite illiterate. Their ranks are, according to Buchanan, recruited chiefly from amongst the Rajputs and the lower castes. Few Brahmins or Baniyas join them.\n\nIt has been mentioned that Krishna and Radha have few votaries; but amongst that select few must be reckoned the Radhaballabhis. These are of course Vaishnavas. They worship Krishna as lord or lover of Radha (Radhavallabha); but though professedly adorers of the husband, they show the wife or mistress a degree of preference which throws her better half into the shade. The Hindu religion, like most others, feels the need of some woman to worship. Yet the cultus of Radha is a most undoubted innovation. The Radha of the Mahabharata is a very different personage, the wife of Duryodhan's charioteer. Not even in the Bhagavat is any Radha specially mentioned amongst the fair cowherdesses with whom Krishna amused himself at Brindaban. The chief authority for this Radha's pretensions is the comparatively modern Purana known as the Brahma-Vaivarta. It tells us that in the beginning the Prim\u00e6val Being clept himself in twain. His right half became Krishna, his left Radha; and by their reunion was begotten the universe. With Krishna Radha continued to dwell in Goloka, the heaven of Vishnu. Here she gave origin to the Gopis, divine cowherdesses; while from her husband's person were in like manner produced their male equivalents, the Gopas. But from the heavens of the Hind\u00fbs conjugal infidelity is not excluded. Having had\n\n1 Eastern India, II., 483-84; Wilson's Essays on the Religion of the Hind\u00fbs, I., 204.\non one occasion ample cause to resent Krishna's conduct, R\u00e1dha shut him out of her palace. The Gopa Sud\u00e1ma, the confidential friend of her husband, protested. For his audacity he was cursed, and doomed to appear on earth as the demon Shankhachuda. But he retaliated with an imprecation whose equal power brought R\u00e1dha from heaven, to be born in the house of a Brind\u00e1ban Vaisya. About the same time Krishna made his worldly appearance; and in the fulness of years the two were married. But the curse of Sud\u00e1ma had not yet exhausted its venom; and from Krishna's adolescence to the close of his earthly career his wife was severed from him. They were re-united only after he had followed her back to the heavenly Goloka.\n\nThe veneration of the R\u00e1dh\u00e1bhallabh\u00eds for their goddess is much the same as that which, in the Pur\u00e1na just mentioned, is expressed by the god Ganesha. \"Mother of the universe,\" he cries, \"thou art the great goddess, the parent of all wealth, and of the Vedas. The wise ascetic who first pronounces thy name, and next that of Krishna, goes to the latter's heaven; but he who reverses this order sins the sin of slaying a Br\u00e1hman. The fool who reviles R\u00e1dhika shall suffer pain and sorrow in life; shall hereafter be doomed to hell, as long as sun and moon endure.\" Like most abuse, the last sentence is perhaps a confession of weakness. The R\u00e1dh\u00e1bhallabh\u00eds are perfectly aware that the weight of priestly authority is against them. Br\u00e1hman orthodoxy and Br\u00e1hman pride of race scorn the idea that Krishna the knightly Kshatriya, Krishna the descendant and the kinsman of Br\u00e1hmans, should have married the daughter of a S\u00fadra or even a Vaisya cowherd. That she was Krishna's paramour is not indeed denied; but the admission is of course even more insulting than the denial. Though by their own showing R\u00e1dha was on earth no more than a Vaisya, the R\u00e1dhaballabh\u00eds are aristocratic. They admit to their order none save Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs. But though a few pandits enter that order as directors, the Br\u00e1hmans as a rule avoid it. The sages of the R\u00e1dhaballabh\u00eds are mostly R\u00e1jputs who have forsown the world and women; who live in places called arenas (akh\u00e1ra); and themselves bear the generic names of Bair\u00e1gi and Vaishnava.\u00b9\n\nIf the At\u00edths represent the ascetic, and the R\u00e1dhaballabh\u00eds the feminine side of the Hindu religion, the Aghoris or Aghorpanthis display that religion in its most revolting form. Their original worship seems to have been the propitiation of Devi with human victims. In imitation of the goddess's grisly aspect, her votary made himself as hideous as possible. His wand was a staff set with bones; his\n\n\u00b9 Wilson, I., 173-77; Buchanan, II., 497-88.\ndrinking-cup the upper half of a skull. Though indifference to worldly objects was the keynote of his creed, he showed no reluctance against cheering himself with animal food and intoxicating drinks. The regular worship of the sect has of course been long suppressed; but a few disgusting wretches still extort arms by the practice of what they are pleased to call its rites. They eat and drink everything, down to ordure and carrion. With the former they smear their bodies or pelt people who refuse to grant their demands. They inflict gashes on their limbs, that the crime of blood may rest on the head of the recusant. Nor are these the only repulsive devices by which they draw cash from the always credulous and often timid Hindu. \"One of them at Gorakhpur,\" writes Buchanan, \"shocked the people so much that they complained to Mr. Ahmuty, then judge, who drove him out as a nuisance.\" In the present day a magistrate would probably apply to an Aghori those sections of the Criminal Procedure Code which relate to vagabonds. And it is perhaps the fear of such treatment which prevents the sect from practising its rites under the eye of the police. But in Buchanan's day its chief, who lived at Benares, gave instruction to many respectable persons including Br\u0101hmans and Rajputs; while in this district the principal landholders had \"a strong hankering after\" its doctrine. Derived as it was from the propitiation of Devi, that doctrine is of course Shaiva.\n\nA B\u0101nsi divine informed the writer last quoted that the highest known science was Vedic theology. On this and its attendant studies, grammar, mythology, astrology and law, he mentioned many works. But these were almost all composed in Sanskrit; and it may be doubted whether, of the few Sanskrit scholars in this district, half a dozen ever read them. Who wrote them is often uncertain; but it is at least certain that none of them was written in Basti. The poems most popular with the learned classes were the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a of V\u0101lmiki, the Raghu and Kum\u0101r of K\u0101lid\u0101sa, and the Naishad of Shri Harsha. Of two works on prosody, one was written in a language called Sarpabh\u0101sha, or the dragon's tongue. This, a gibberish corruption of Sanskrit, was supposed to be spoken in hell; but it had been learnt, perhaps with a view to future use, by several industriously idle savants. The book which is perhaps most favoured of most readers is the Hindi translation of the R\u0101m\u0101ya\u1e47a by Tuls\u012bd\u0101s. But Basti has not, and never had, any literature of its own. Not even a newspaper is published.\n\nOn the Bhojpuri patois spoken by the bulk of the people much has been said above. Specimens already given have shown how much its declensions and conjugations differ from those of book Urdu and book Hindi. But in the\n\n1 Wilson, I., 233-84; Buchanan, II., 492-93.\n2 Pp. 372-73.\nmatter of vocabulary the difference is equally striking. For *yih*, this, we have *itihu* or *hai*; for *wuh*, that, *otihu* or *hau*. Instead of *m\u00e1*, mother, a peasant will say *mat\u00e1ri*; he will call his daughter not *larki*, a girl, but *larkuni*. His wife is styled *mihr\u00e1ru*, not *joru*; and similarly, with regard to his wife, he is not *sha\u00fahar*, a husband, but *mansiddhu*. This patois is not confined to the peasantry. It, or something like it, is spoken by women of all ranks; and is therefore spoken in their homes by even educated men. In the India of to-day, as in the Italy of Cicero, the dialect of ladies is not always that used in public by their sons. The public language of gentlemen is Urdu.\n\nThe educational conditions of 1835 and 1847 have been noted in the account of Gorakhpur, which then included this district. Public instruction is now directed by a local committee, whereof the magistrate-collector is president and one of his assistants secretary. Supervision on behalf of the educational department is effected by the school inspector of the Benares circle. And the statistics for all classes of schools were in 1877-78:\n\n| Class of school | Number of schools | Hind\u00fas | Muslims | Others | Average daily attendance | Cost per head | Expenditure borne by the State | Total charges |\n|-----------------|-------------------|--------|---------|--------|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------|\n| **Government,** |                   |        |         |        |                          |               |                               |              |\n| Tahs\u00edli         | 5                 | 369    | 38      |        | 369\u00b77                    | 5             | 1,742                         | 1,878        |\n| Halkabandi      | 133               | 4,039  | 36\u00b71    |        | 3,919\u00b7                    | 3\u00b76           | 13,976                        | 13,976       |\n| Girls           | 3                 | 57     | 36      |        | 81                       | 4\u00b77           | 584                           | 384          |\n| **Aided by Government\u2014Boys** | 2 | 184 | 16 |        | 120\u00b7            | 17\u00b728         | 975                           | 2,071        |\n| **Unaided\u2014Indigenous** | 86 | 364 | 181 |        | 645\u00b7            | 5\u00b73           | 300                           | 2,941        |\n| **Total**       | 229               | 4,963  | 631     | 3      | 5,034\u00b77                  | 4\u00b721          | 17,377                        | 21,250       |\n\nThe absence of a *zila* or district school will at once be noticed. Did one exist, it would probably belong to the middle class, which gives secondary instruction in English. But the small demand for such instruction is already satisfied by the two aided institutions, the \"middle\" of the Church Mission and another Anglo-veracular school. The district lacks also the educational establishments known as parganah, municipal, aided girls, and unaided missionary.\n\nThe tahs\u00edli schools are at Menhd\u00e1wal, B\u00e1nsi, Basti, Haraia, and Bh\u00e1npur. They teach boys up to the standard of the middle class vernacular examination.\nThe result of that examination (1877-78) was to show that of these schools all save one were efficient; while three had improved since the preceding year. The halkabandi or village schools teach rural children reading, writing, arithmetic and other elementary learning. Of these 34 only were classed as efficient and 76 as improved, the remainder being stationary or retrograde. The experiment of levying fees from non-agricultural children, which had been unsuccessfully tried in three schools, was abandoned. The Government girls, whose curriculum is much the same as that of the halkabandi schools, are at B\u00e1nsi, Old Basti, and the adjacent Nay\u00e1 B\u00e1z\u00e1r. Female education is as yet in the experimental stage; and owing to want of funds, or native apathy, or both, the experiment has as yet met with little success. Of indigenous schools little is known except that they are usually short-lived, and that their discipline is too lax to admit of much progress in those \"three R's.\" which are their only useful teaching. How small an area education has hitherto covered may be judged from the returns of the 1872 census. The sexes, ages, and creeds of the few persons then able to read and write may be summarized thus:\u2014 Hindu males, 4,623, and females, 29; Musalm\u00e1n males, 457, and females, 6; Christian males, 4; total of all classes, 5,119, or '342 per cent. of the district population. But these figures are confessedly imperfect, and most so in the case of females. The forms distributed to census enumerators contained no column for women; and women were often, therefore, excluded from the reckoning. The reluctance of the educated classes to supply information concerning their womankind is well known.\n\nBetween 1872 and the present time, if we may judge from postal statistics, Post-office. education has increased but little. The receipts of the post-office have not been markedly augmented by any augmentation in the number of those who can read or write letters. The following table shows both income and expenditure for two years:\n\n| Years | Miscellaneous, sav- ing, fines. | Deposits guarantee fund, family funds. | Remittances. | Postage. | Total receipts. | Charges, direct and contingent, salaries, &c. | Remittances. | Other charges, re-funds advance, printing. | Cash balance. | Total charges. |\n|-------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1870-71 | Rs. 117                       | Rs. 94                               | Rs. 6,931    | Rs. 4,026  | Rs. 11,168      | Rs. 6,955                                    | Rs. 4,050    | Rs. 40                                     | Rs. 123       | Rs. 11,168      |\n|        | Advances from treasuries.     | Opening balance.                     |              |           |                |                                             |              |                                          |               |                |\n| 1877-78 | Rs. 51                        | Rs. 7,245                            | Rs. 173      | Rs. 4,482  | Rs. 11,951      | Rs. 7,138                                    | Rs. 4,484    | Rs. 154                                    | Rs. 175       | Rs. 11,951      |\nThe actual number of letters received during the latter year was 179,296; of papers, 9,776; of packets, 3,442; and of parcels 1,950. The total number of missives which reached Basti by post was therefore 194,464. The district contains 10 imperial and 16 district post-offices. The former are at Basti (Sadr or central); Amorha, Banshi, Basti city, Domariaganj, Haraia, Khalilabad, Mahauli, Menhdawal, and Uska (branches of central). The district offices are at Bangon, Biskohar, Buddhahand, Captainganj, Chhapia, Chhapraghat, Chilia, Dhebarua, Daldalha, Dudhara, Gaghat, Kothila, Lautan, Misraulia, Paikaulia, and Rudhauli. There is as yet no telegraph.\n\nLike education and the post-office, a regular police was the introduction of British rule. According to the latest \"allocation statement,\" Basti contains 29 police-stations, whereof 6 belong to the first, 6 to the second, 14 to the third, and 3 to the fourth class. The first-class stations, which have usually a sub-inspector, two head and a dozen foot constables, are at Banshi, Basti, Chhapia, Domariaganj, Khalilabad, and Menhdawal. The complement of the second-class stations, at Chilia, Dudhara, Haraia, Kalwari, Parasrampur, and Rudhauli, is as a rule one sub-inspector, one head and nine foot constables. The third-class stations, at which are generally quartered two head and six foot constables, lie at Bankata, Barakuni, Buddhahand, Captainganj, Chhapia, Dhebarua, Dhanghatta, Lautan, Mahauli, Misraulia, Paikaulia, Sonaha, Tilokpur, and Uska. The fourth-class stations or outposts, whose quota consists of but one head and three foot constables, are at Intwa, Dubaulia, and Belwa bazair. From the thanas or stations of higher classes these fourth-class stations are distinguished by the name of chauki.\n\nSuch is the distribution of police-stations as at present recognized. But considerable changes have been proposed, and may some day be effected. The proposals include the degradation of the Dudhara, Kalwari, and Parasrampur stations from the second to the third class. If completely carried out, this arrangement will give the district three instead of six second-class, and 17 instead of 14 third-class stations.\n\nAll stations, of whatever class, are manned by the regular police, enrolled under Act V. of 1861. This force is assisted by the town police recruited under\n\n---\n\n1 Neither Kalwari nor Barakuni, Captainganj nor Haraia, is at present in the class shown by the allocation statement. But it was deemed sufficient, in the text, to compare the arrangement now recognized by Government with that proposed. The actual classification of stations at the end of 1880 may, if necessary, be shown thus:\u2014First class: Banshi, Basti, Captainganj, Chhapia, Domariaganj, Khalilabad, Menhdawal. Second class: Chilia, Dudhara, Third class: Bankata, Gaghat, Parasrampur, Rudhauli, Buddhahand, Chhapia, Dhanghata, Dhebarua, Lautan, Mahauli, Misraulia, Paikaulia, Sonaha, Tilokpur, Uska. Fourth class: Barakuni, Dubaulia, Haraia, Intwa, Kalwari. The abolition of the Gaghat station has been already sanctioned.\nAct XX. of 1856. In 1878 the three forces mustered together 425 men of all grades, including eight mounted constables. There was thus one policeman to every 6.55 square miles and 3.465 inhabitants. The cost of the force was Rs. 58,402, of which Rs. 57,340 were debited to provincial revenues and the remainder defrayed from municipal and other funds.

These were in 1878 distributed amongst the 9,620 inhabited villages of the district at the rate of one to every 728 inhabitants. Their sanctioned cost, Rs. 72,228, was met out of the 10 per cent. cess.\n\nMeasures for repressing the murder of female children here claim a more than usual share of the policeman\u2019s attention. A former Assistant Magistrate of the district, Mr. Robert Smeaton, has kindly furnished on this subject a note which deserves to be quoted at length:\n\n\u201cFrom the earliest times of British rule the Basti district has been notorious for the practice of female infanticide. Long before organized efforts were made by Government to put a stop to the crime, it was known to be prevalent. The earliest instance on record dates back as far as 1802. Writing on the 17th April of that year, not six months after the cession, the Collector-Magistrate of Gorakhpur reported that a female child had been slaughtered by her Rajput parents in parganah Nagar. But the father obtained a certificate from the local registrar (k\u00e1n\u00fango) to the effect that the act was justified by custom;\n\n1 Now Junior Secretary to the Government of these Provinces.\nthat killing of this kind was no murder; and the matter was apparently allowed to drop.\n\n\"About 1835, Buchanan alludes to the practice as still rife in Gorakhpur-Basti; but he notices that the drastic method of active murder, formerly in vogue, had by this time given place as a rule to the slower but equally sure process of starvation. Despite the evil reputation of the district, however, it was not until 1856 that the Government awoke to the necessity of introducing a policy of interference. In that year Mr. Moore, C.S., was deputed as a special commissioner to report generally on the prevalence of female infanticide; and a large portion of his elaborate report, which forms a valuable contribution to the records of the North-Western Provinces, was devoted to the Benares division and the Basti district. The appendices afford interesting details of 118 Basti villages, and of these 113 were found by Mr. Moore to be open to suspicion. The limit of age adopted in his enquiry was six years, this having been the standard previously used in Mainpuri and elsewhere for similar purposes; and the returns brought out in terrible prominence the existence of the crime. Hardly had the results of Mr. Moore's investigations been submitted to Government when the Mutiny broke out, and Mr. Moore was himself one of its earliest victims. What the intention of the Government of the time had been with reference to the reported results is not apparent. But the rebellion of 1857, with its larger interests and more important political issues, left the infanticide question unsolved; and again there ensued a period of inaction. It was not until the figures disclosed by the census of 1865 forced the attention of the Government to the disproportion between the sexes that the matter again came to the surface. So startling were the percentages that it was deemed expedient to institute a special enquiry; and Mr. Hobart, C.S., who was attached to the staff of the Basti district, was deputed in 1867-68 to undertake the work. An admirable sequel to Mr. Moore's recorded enquiry, the report contains in concise form all the leading facts in connection with the practice of female infanticide in Basti, with an elaborate analysis of the Rajput clans believed to be implicated. The returns are given for the 216 villages in which Mr. Hobart believed that the practice more or less existed, and the figures collated by him proved beyond the possibility of doubt that the crime still lingered in many Rajput villages and families.\n\n\"Although no immediate action was taken on Mr. Hobart's report, the results of his enquiry contributed not a little to the speedy passing of Act VIII. of 1870, the first legislative measure on the subject since the\n\n1 He was murdered in the Mirzapur district, of which he was then Joint-Magistrate. His promising life had lasted for little over 24 years.\ncommencement of British rule in Northern India. The provisions of the Act necessitated a careful house-to-house enumeration in all R\u00e1jput villages (the crime is practically restricted to R\u00e1jputs in Basti), where, for any reason, suspicion was believed to exist. This work devolved on me, as Assistant Magistrate of the district. Its results are recorded *in extenso* in my report on the subject, dated the 15th June, 1871, and published in the official records of the North-Western Provinces. It will thus be seen that there have been three distinct local enquiries and reports on the subject of female infanticide in Basti, and it may be interesting to show very briefly how the returns at these three periods compare. Taking first the 118 villages referred to by Mr. Moore, I found that the figures stood, so far as I could ascertain, as under:\n\n| Year | Under six years | Percentage of girls |\n|------|----------------|-------------------|\n|      | Boys | Girls |                |\n| In 1858 | ... | ... | ... |\n| In 1871 | 1,260 | 282 | 18\u00b730 |\n\n\"The detailed comparison instituted by me showed that whether the 118 villages were regarded from the standpoint of totals or percentages, *en masse* or in detail, on the basis of territorial sub-divisions or on the surer principle of clans and families, improvement was everywhere visible. This result was no doubt due partly to the slow growth of public opinion, partly to the greater supervision exercised under an improved system of administration, and partly to the warning which the two official investigations unquestionably conveyed to the suspected clans.\n\n\"In his enquiry of 1867-68 Mr. Hobart took the great mutiny of 1857 as his starting-point for the enumeration of male and female children; and I adopted the same land-mark in 1871, partly to facilitate comparison of results, and partly because it conduced greatly to the speedy carrying out of the census among people whose computation of time is usually far from accurate. Of the 216 villages I found that in the four years' interval 54 per cent. had improved while 16 were stationary and 30 retrogressive. The totals of the minor population (*i.e.* of all born since the Mutiny) stood as under:\n\n| Boys | Girls | Percentage of girls |\n|------|-------|-------------------|\n| 1867-68 | 2,533 | 714 | 28\u00b7 |\n| 1871 | 3,700 | 1,931 | 25\u00b7 |\n\n\"The proportion had thus improved in less than four years by three per cent., and the figures showed that in the interval the boys had increased by 1,167, and the girls by 517, in the ratio of 69 to 31. Here also, therefore, improvement was visible.\"\n\"My own enquiry in 1871 extended over a much wider field than that of either of my predecessors, for it embraced practically all the Rajput villages in the district. I adopted a girl percentage of 40 as a basis of operation, and regarded all with a percentage under that limit as prima facie open to suspicion. Of the 400 villages visited by me, I found 232 with under 40 per cent., and to these I added 26 villages, which, though able to show in 1871 a girl percentage of 40 or more, had been believed by Mr. Hobart to be open to grave suspicion. My proposal was to bring all the 258 under the operation of Act VII. of 1870 at the outset. Of these 258, 26 were over the 40 per cent. limit, 107 showed girl percentages varying from 25 to 40, while the remaining 125 had a female proportion of under 25. Of the 125, again, I found 38 villages unable to produce a single girl born since the mutiny. As regards totals, the returns showed that in the whole 258 villages which I recommended for proclamation, there were 4,374 boys to 1,531 girls, in the ratio of 74 to 26. The general percentage was of course vitiated by the startling figures of the group of 125 villages under 25 per cent, where there were 2,213 boys to only 369 girls in the proportion of 86 to 14.\n\n\"In the final orders on the subject, the Government of the North-Western Provinces exempted 18 of the 258 villages from the operation of the Act; and 240 villages, containing 2,096 families, with a minor population of 4,161 boys and 1,892 girls (in the ratio of 75 to 25) were duly proclaimed. A special police force was sanctioned, paid from rates imposed under the Act on the more guilty villages and clans.\n\n\"The practice of female infanticide is restricted in the Basti district to the Rajput caste. Foremost among all the guilty clans stands that of the S\u00farajbansi. They contributed 130 to the total of 240 proclaimed villages; and their girl percentage, on a minor population of 2,906, was only 23. The Amorha parganah is their home, and it is here that the sharpest measures and the closest supervision have been found necessary. These S\u00farajbansi Rajputs, though united by the bond of a common ancestry, and belonging to the common gotra of the Bh\u00e1radhwaj, are divided locally into three classes, known respectively as Kunwars, B\u00e1bus, and Th\u00e1kurs. All three were found to be deeply implicated, but the order of precedence in suspicion and guilt was that here given.\n\n\"Next to the S\u00farajbansi in evil repute come the Gautams, who are chiefly found in parganah Nagar. They are much less numerous than the S\u00farajbansi Rajputs; but in the 26 villages which were proclaimed, the minor population of 743 showed a girl percentage of only 19. Of the Bais and Halbaus clans\u2014the former scattered over the district, the latter found chiefly in\npargana Basti\u201428 and 14 villages respectively were placed on the proclaimed list; the aggregate minor populations (of 365 and 634) giving a girl percentage on each case of 30. None other of the other 16 clans which contributed to the total proclaimed number calls for comment, as the number of villages was in every case under 10, and the minor population small.\n\n\"Ever since the proclamation of the suspected villages in 1871 an elaborate system of registration and supervision has been maintained. From time to time changes have been introduced. The police rates have been somewhat modified, while here and there exemptions have been allowed both in villages and in families. But the proclaimed population is in the main the same; and it is interesting to note the final girl percentage of the proclaimed villages as given in the successive reports to Government on the subject, and to observe the steady improvement that has resulted. The figures are as under:\n\n| Year   | Girl Percentage |\n|--------|----------------|\n| 1874-75| 28.3           |\n| 1875-76| 32.08          |\n| 1876-77| 34.3           |\n| 1877-78| 36.9           |\n| 1878-79| 38.2           |\n\n\"These figures point conclusively to progress. It is impossible to claim for them absolute accuracy; but they may be safely accepted as approximating closely to the truth (having been verified from time to time by the covenanted staff), and as such they afford the best possible evidence of the good effects of the measures inaugurated by Act VII. of 1870.\n\n\"Of the causes of the crime, direct or indirect, it is hardly necessary to speak. There is no doubt that the large expenditure incident to the marriage of daughters is, so far as Basti is concerned, the chief. These Rajputs are a proud race; they have an elaborately constructed scale, under which each class finds its appropriate place; and they have a very definite code of rules as to intermarriage. All this means heavy expenditure; and as the class are as thriftless as they are impoverished, the resort to infanticide is not so much a matter of surprise as otherwise it might be. It has been held that to the idea that the terms \"sala\" and \"sasur,\" as disgraceful and dishonouring, is due in part the prevalence of the crime; and I am not prepared to say that this is not the case. But while allowing for this\u2014and for the influence of custom, habit, and example\u2014I am convinced that the real cause is to be found in the desire to escape from a burden of expenditure which traditional usage has\n\n1 Sala means brother-in-law; sasur or svara, father-in-law. As terms of abuse they convey the idea that the person using them has been on more than intimate terms with the sister or the daughter of the person addressed.\nfor ages imposed, in connection with the marriage of Rajput girls. *H\u00e1c fonte derivata clades.* As to the actual practice of the crime: when, how, and by whom it is perpetrated: what the means are\u2014salt or opium, strangulation or inanition; all such matters are involved in considerable doubt. Direct evidence is very rarely attainable owing to the extreme privacy with which the domestic life of the guilty clans is invested and to the difficulty of securing trustworthy testimony. Hence it is that conviction is so rarely secured even where there is moral certainty as to guilt and indirect proof of complicity.\n\n\"I do not think (but in this my opinion must be taken quantum valeat) that infanticide is now directly practised in one out of every hundred proclaimed villages in Basti and elsewhere; and I attribute the cessation of the practice wholly and entirely to the wholesome action taken under Act VII. of 1870. But I fear that indirectly the poison still lingers; that to neglect and insufficient nourishment at a certain age is due the abnormal number of deaths of female children among the guilty clans which is still observable. Time and education\u2014and the growth of civilising influences\u2014will doubtless help to remedy this; and then, but not till then, will the social sanction supersede the legal, and the voice of society condemn what the law so often fails to detect and punish.\"\n\nConvicts imprisoned through the agency of the police just described are sent to the central prison at Benares or the district jail at Basti itself. It has been elsewhere shown that though long-term prisoners generally go to the central, and short-term prisoners to the district establishment, there is no fixed rule as to the exact length of term which shall qualify the convict for either. In 1870, five years after the formation of the district, the Basti jail had an average daily population of 137 and received 776 inmates. The principal statistics for 1877 may be thus tabulated:\n\n| Hindus | Musalmans |\n|--------|-----------|\n| Total number of prisoners during the year. | |\n| Males | Females | Males | Females |\n| Average daily number of prisoners. | Admitted during the year. | Discharged during the year. | Admitted to hospital during the year. | Deaths. | Total yearly cost per head of average strength. | Net yearly cost per head of average strength after deducting profits of manufacture. |\n| 3,144 | 1,200 | 139 | 167 | 23 | 333:25 | 2,724 | 2,611 | 350 | 9 | Rs. 43 | Rs. 49 |\n\n*See Gazr., V, 660 (Bareilly). Long-term prisoners are those whose term exceeds two years.*\nOf the total number of prisoners 27, principally debtors, had been imprisoned by order of the civil courts. A comparison of the number of admissions with the total number of prisoners during the year will show that 420 of the latter had remained in jail since former years. Of the jail population generally, 9 are entered as juvenile offenders, or persons under 16 years of age; 1,310 as between 16 and 40; 188 as between 40 and 60; and 15 as above the latter age; but the age of the few remaining persons is not stated. The greater part of the average yearly expenditure on each prisoner consisted in the cost of his rations (Rs. 19-1-11\u00bd). The remainder was made up of his shares in the expenditure on establishment (Rs. 13-0-8\u00bd), clothing (Rs. 2-13-11\u00bc), police guards (Re. 1-7-6\u00bd), building and repairs (Rs. 4-5-0), hospital charges (Rs. 1-0-8) and contingencies (Rs. 2-0-6). The average number of effective workers throughout the year was 275\u00b725; and of these most were employed on building or repairs connected with the jail (99\u00b725), as prison servants (59\u00b775), or on manufactures (92\u00b775). The previous occupation of the prisoners was in few cases such as to fit them for profitable work in prison, the majority having been agriculturists (923), men of independent property or no occupation, and Government or domestic servants. Of non-agriculturists, a term which is presumed to include shopkeepers and handicraftsmen, there were only 360.\n\nThe lock-up for under-trial prisoners is at Basti an appanage of the jail. It had during the same year (1877) 1,568 different occupants, of whom 385 were afterwards transferred as convicts to the jail proper;\u00b9 and its average daily number of inmates was 61\u00b70.\n\nFollowing the usual order, we should here pass to fiscal history. But the fiscal history of Basti, down to its disruption from Gorakhpur, has been shown in the notice on the latter.\u00b2 As an independent district Basti dates only from the 6th May, 1865. The current assessment of land revenue had become current several years earlier. It remains only to show how the area of each parganah was classified by the survey preceding that assessment; to note what acreage was returned as barren, what as cultivated, and so on. The annexed table will effect our purpose at a glance:\n\n\u00b9 The small proportion of persons transferred to the jail proper is rather noticeable. The proportion of those convicted must have been much larger; and why did so few convicts find their way to prison? \"The reason probably is,\" writes Mr Powlett, \"that during the latter half of 1877, the scarcity half, the rattan took the place of the jail as a punishment.\"\n\n\u00b2 Above, pp 879-95.\n### AREA IN ACRES.\n\n| Parganah | UNASSESSABLE | ASSESSABLE | Cultivated | Total |\n|----------|--------------|------------|------------|-------|\n|          | Revenue-free | Barren     | Cultivable | Old fallow | Watered | Unwatered | Total cultivated | |\n| Binayakpur | 396         | 2,524      | 4,517      | 887       | 6,703   | 12,418    | 19,121           | 27,446 |\n| Maghar    | 4,642       | 56,831     | 58,845     | Not shown | 117,743 | 51,605    | 169,248          | 292,686 |\n| Bans\u00ed     | 6,044       | 45,665     | 73,233     | 33,512    | 120,353 | 157,280   | 277,683          | 436,017 |\n| Rasulpur  | 2,670       | 22,796     | 35,225     | 9,489     | 105,201 | 36,196    | 141,397          | 211,577 |\n| Mahuli    | 8,668       | 59,678     | 32,327     | 14,794    | 105,334 | 30,650    | 135,984          | 246,651 |\n| Nagar     | 1,921       | 15,739     | 28,648     | 6,906     | 75,306  | 11,558    | 84,864           | 138,578 |\n| Amorha    | 4,490       | 22,869     | 39,182     | 11,167    | 80,919  | 24,687    | 105,606          | 183,04 |\n| Basti     | 2,608       | 17,515     | 29,782     | 5,291     | 95,773  | 17,373    | 113,46           | 168,342 |\n| **Total** | **26,689**  | **34,317** | **301,759**| **...**   | **707,332** | **341,117** | **1,048,449** | **1,704,310** |\n\nThese figures have been taken in the case of Maghar from the settlement Report;\u00b9 and in all other cases from the Board's review of the assessment. But they can be regarded as approximate only. It has been found impossible to reconcile their grand total with that of the late official statement (1878) shown at p. 572. But the difference is more than accounted for by the difference in the total area of parganah Bans\u00ed.\n\nThe term of the current assessment expires on the 30th June, 1889. Its demand was in some cases progressive, attaining a maximum about 1873-74. How well it has worked may be shown by the following account of collections and balances for ten years:\n\n| Year | Demand | Collections | Balances | Particulars of Balances | Percentage of balance on demand |\n|------|--------|-------------|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|      | Rs.    | Rs.         | Rs.      | Real                    |                                |\n|      |        |             |          | In train of liquidation | Doubtful | Irrecoverable | Nominal |                                |\n| 1868-69 | 10,21,387 | 10,15,133 | 6,264 | ... | 4,810 | 1,444 | ... | .61 |\n| 1869-70 | 10,20,011 | 10,14,419 | 5,592 | ... | 4,911 | 681 | ... | .54 |\n| 1870-71 | 10,20,777 | 10,10,796 | 9,981 | 4,666 | ... | ... | 5,315 | .98 |\n| 1871-72 | 10,17,787 | 10,14,744 | 3,043 | 73 | ... | ... | 2,971 | .30 |\n| 1872-73 | 10,14,941 | 10,10,961 | 3,980 | 3,550 | 208 | 222 | ... | .39 |\n| 1873-74 | 13,20,283 | 12,76,170 | 44,113 | 42,959 | 899 | 255 | ... | 3.34 |\n| 1874-75 | 13,19,915 | 13,18,456 | 1,429 | 406 | 784 | 193 | 46 | .10 |\n| 1875-76 | 13,20,085 | 13,19,547 | 538 | 171 | ... | ... | 867 | ... |\n| 1876-77 | 13,19,644 | 13,19,398 | 243 | ... | ... | ... | 243 | ... |\n| 1877-78 | 13,19,514 | 13,18,261 | 1,253 | 1,228 | ... | ... | 25 | .09 |\n\n\u00b9 At assessment Maghar contained 29 tappas, of which 9 (Aurangabad, North Haveli, Satgawan, Gahasand, Bharsand, Bhadesari, Suras, Pachauri, and Khajuri) have remained in Gorakhpur. The figures for the other 20, which were included in Basti, have been added together and shown in the above table.\nThroughout the district the revenue becomes due in four instalments, payable on dates when the garnering of the various crops has brought rents into the landlord's pocket. The two first or autumn payments are made on the 15ths of November and January respectively, the two last or spring payments on the 1sts of May and June.\n\nThe tenures of the proprietors who pay this revenue may be classed under four heads:\u2014(1) the zamin-dari, and (2) the pattidari, which having been described before need not be described again; (3) the birt, and (4) the arazi. Mr Thomson gives the following analysis of the manner in which these forms of possession are distributed amongst the different parganas:\n\n| Parganah | Zamindari | Pattidari | Birt | Arazi |\n|----------|-----------|-----------|------|-------|\n|          |           | Perfect   | Imperfect | Whole villages | Parts of villages | Parts of villages |\n|          | Villages  | Villages  | Villages |                |                  |                  |\n| Rasulpur | ...       | 296       | 429     | ...            | 31                | ...              |\n| Banshi   | ...       | 301       | 1,448   | ...            | 34                | ...              |\n| Binayakpur | ... | 10        | 96      | ...            | 34                | ...              |\n| Nagar    | ...       | 166       | 5       | 522            | 101               | 31               |\n| Basti    | ...       | 334       | 199     | 36             | 2x2               | 3                |\n| Mahauli  | ...       | 472       | 138     | 487            | 176               | 41               |\n| Maghar   | ...       | 76        | 280     | 1,399          | ...               | ...              |\n| Amorha   | ...       | 517       | ...     | ...            | 286               | 94               |\n| Total    | ...       | 2,172     | 2,595   | 2,776          | 850               | 169              |\n\nFrom this it will be seen that, while prevailing in the south, imperfect pattidari is in the north absent. \"In many of the pattidari villages of the latter tract,\" adds Mr. Thomson, \"the lands held in common consist merely of the village-sites, tanks, groves and waste. Bhayachara tenure is everywhere unknown.\"\n\nIt is usual to contrast the birt tenures with the fiefs of the feudal system; but, as in most cases where European is compared with Indian, the comparison is too general. Some forms of birt no doubt resembled feudal holdings, but others did not. In order to prove this double proposition we need only examine the five forms of birt which once existed in Basti. Of these, four have been described in the Gorakhpur notice.\n\n1 Gazr., II., 222, and V., 615-16. 2 Supra, pp. 396-98.\nThe *jewan* birt was there defined as \"an assignment of villages made to a cadet of the r\u00e1ja's family, as a perpetual subsistence for himself and his heirs.\" The grand difference between this and the fief of medi\u00e6val Europe is that the bond between lord and vassal was primarily one of blood-relationship. Like the tenures of R\u00e1jput\u00e1na, the *jewan* was \"founded on the principle of family partition, and not on that of securing great military leaders.\" Nor did it demand from the vassal so complete a military service as in Europe. Complete homage it no doubt implied; for in Basti the r\u00e1ja was comparatively a greater man than in R\u00e1jput\u00e1na. Save perhaps in Nagar, he bore no brother near the throne. The authority within their own domains of his vassals was limited. The pretensions of the independent R\u00e1jput baron, who except in time of peace regarded the r\u00e1ja as his cousin, who claimed as of right a cousin's share in the land, would have ill been tolerated here. Against such pretensions the most jealous precautions were taken in the north, where ruled the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1jas. These chiefs seldom made *jewan* grants to any save illegitimate kinsmen, who were precluded from rivalry by their slender chances of succession. But in the south such grants were not so rare.\n\nThe *marwat* and *sankalp* birts were still freer from the obligation of military service. The first was a landed compensation made to the family of a dependant slain in the r\u00e1ja's wars; the second was a glebe granted to priests for the safety of the grantor's soul. The so-called *mukaddam* birt, again, depended on service, but on service of the least military kind. The *birtiya* was in this case not a feoffee, but a steward. His tenure depended on the rather one-sided contract by which he, the headman (*mukaddam* or *mahto*) of the village, had undertaken its management on behalf of the r\u00e1ja. The contractor was allowed to reserve for himself 7 per cent. of the area, while for the proceeds of the rest he accounted to his lord. But the arrangement lasted only during the r\u00e1ja's pleasure; it arose solely from the r\u00e1ja's convenience. Not till the clearance of a forest tract was needed did he find himself forced to concede greater permanence of tenure. To encourage arduous reclamations better terms were required. The contractor therefore received not only an advance, but a deed securing his future possession. In this deed was recognized his right to retain a tithe or a quarter of the cultivated land, and the whole of the manorial dues (*ad\u00eer*). But when land increased in value, the r\u00e1ja began to receive instead of giving an advance. As his necessities increased, he demanded larger and larger sums of purchase-money, making in return\n\n---\n\n1 Elphinstone's *History of India*, Bk. II, chap. 2.\nlarger and larger concessions to the birtiya. But the usual arrangement was that the latter should receive 20 per cent. or one-fifth of the yearly assets.\n\nThe only really feudal birt was in fact the murchabandi, or wardenship of the marches. Murchabandli means entrenching; and the murchabandli birtiyas were a real entrenchment against northern invaders. The r\u00e1ja settled some trusted R\u00e1jput family on a border tract; and in return for the grant they were bound to guard his frontier, to serve him in war and to swell his retinue in peace. Instances of this tenure are afforded by the R\u00e1jput villages of Mehnoni, Khuni\u00f3n and Chilia, all in B\u00e2nsi. In Gorakhpur none of the kind is apparently forthcoming; and in the notice on that district the murchabandi birt was not mentioned.\n\nSuch, before 1835, were the different forms of birt. But long before that year the hereditary and transferable rights of all birt-holders had become fully recognized; and in that year, as already noted, the Board of Revenue decided that all birt-holders must be deemed proprietors of the villages held by them. With them have ever since been made the engagements for the land-tax. At the settlement of 1839 they were still bound to pay their ancient chieftains a seignioralty (malik\u00e1na) of 20 per cent. on their revenue. But this fee has since been reduced to 10 per cent. It is paid into the Government treasury along with the revenue; and in some cases, where the former payee has been attainted for treason, is credited to Government itself. Thus in parganah Basti the State receives the seignioralty of the rebel r\u00e1ja of Gonda; and in parganah Nagar the seignioralty of the rebel r\u00e1ja of Nagar. The ancient chiefs and Government are now in the position of the superior proprietors called taallukad\u00e1rs; while the birt-holders represent their biswad\u00e1rs or sub-proprietors.\n\nThe word \u00e1r\u00e1zi, the plural of the Arabic arz, simply means lands; and here as elsewhere is used in that general sense. But it has also, as applied to a form of tenure, a special meaning. An \u00e1r\u00e1zi was a portion of a village or estate granted or sold to some owner or owners whom bars of rank or blood severed from the original landlords. It therefore came to be regarded more or less in the light of a separate estate, and in some cases the \u00e1r\u00e1zi-holder pays the revenue due on his holding direct into the treasury. In others, however, he is compelled to adopt the more usual course of paying it through the lambard\u00e1r, the landholder whom, when there are more than one in the village, Government holds responsible for the land-tax.\nHaving briefly described the principal proprietary tenures, we proceed to give some account of the principal proprietary families. By so doing we shall give also some idea of the castes whose acres are broadest.\n\nThe r\u0101ja of B\u0101nsi represents a family which has not only given r\u0101jas to other places, but has also absorbed the possessions of other r\u0101jas. Its origin is traced now to the Panjab, now to Garhw\u0101l, now to Bundelkhand, and now to Assam. But traditions as a rule agree that the Srinagar from which its ancestor came was some place in the far north-west. This ancestor was named Chandra Sen or Singh. His date ranges according to the best authorities\u00b9 from 1200 to 1350 A.D. He claimed descent from the Solar dynasty of Ajudhya, and there is some reason for supposing that he was a Dikshit R\u0101jput. But according to other accounts his tribe were Naikumbh R\u0101jputs, and therefore probably a branch of the Chauhans. The legend runs that, having incurred the displeasure of the reigning Muslim emperor, he was thrown into prison at Dehli. But, having used his influence in suppressing a revolt, he was released and rewarded with the title of Sarnet. This title, about whose exact origin and meaning accounts differ,\u00b2 has ever since been borne by his tribe.\n\nNow, while Chandra Sen was in prison, a Tiw\u0101ri Br\u0101hman from Chittia in this district had foretold his rise to greatness. On his release, this same Br\u0101hman advised him to push his fortunes in the direction of Gorakhpur. The two came to Basti together; and Chandra Sen had soon conquered or cowed into submission all the local chiefs north of the Ku\u0101na. How he extended his possessions into Gorakhpur, overcoming by guile the Domkat\u0101rs or military Br\u0101hmans, has been told elsewhere. Marrying a daughter of the Bisen r\u0101ja of Majhauli, he by her left three sons. Of these Jagdhar S\u0101h became r\u0101ja of Sat\u0101si in Gorakhpur; Jai Singh, r\u0101ja of Maghar in this district; and Randhir Singh, r\u0101ja of Anaula or Unwal in Gorakhpur. The title of Sat\u0101si was forfeited for treason in the great rebellion; and the r\u0101ja of Maghar or B\u0101nsi is now the senior titled chief of the house. The junior branch of Anaula is still however in existence. Chandra Sen is said to have left a fourth and perhaps illegitimate son, Bijai Singh. On him his brother Jai of Maghar bestowed a large domain now embracing some 400 or 500 villages in Maghar and Ras\u016blpur.\n\n\u00b9 Messrs. J. B. Thomson and E. B. Alexander. Some account of the family will be found above, pp. 353-54, 401, 434-36 and 440; in Mr. Wynne's Settlement Report of parganah B\u0101nsi; and in the official Rajas and Naw\u0101bs of the N.W.P. For general notices of the Sarnets here and elsewhere see Sherring's Castes and Tribes of Benares, articles \"Naikumbh,\" \"Dikshit,\" and \"Sarnet\"; Buchanan's Eastern India, II.; and Mr. C. A. Elliott's Chronicles of Undu. \u00b2 See pp. 353-54.\nThis tract is known as the Bajhera. On it dwell Bijai\u2019s descendants, the Bh\u00e1iyas or B\u00e1bus of Rudhauli. For their rebellion in 1857-58 one branch of this family forfeited land assessed with Rs. 8,808 yearly. But the confiscated estates were afterwards bestowed on Bh\u00e1iya Krishnaparsh\u00e1d Singh, the loyal head of the other branch. Krishnaparsh\u00e1d, who was certainly the most prominent member of the family in recent times, died last year (1879).\n\nThe Maghar principality, to which Jai I. succeeded on the death of his father, is credited by tradition with a circuit of 42 kos or 84 miles. He and his descendants ruled it for about 300 years. A list of those descendants is marginally given. But it should be remarked that a pedigree showing as many as 25 successions in as few as three centuries makes rather large demands on the credulity of the genealogist. It is the fashion in India to reckon generations as shorter than in Europe, where about three go to the century. But even in India, four successive monarchs of the same line have been known to reign between them 151 years (1556-1707). The last or 25th r\u00e1ja on this list, R\u00e1i Singh, died childless; but not before he had adopted as his successor his distant cousin, Hati or Sans\u00e1r Singh, son of the r\u00e1ja of Anaula. Hati was succeeded in turn by each of his four sons, Madhu I., R\u00e1m I., Udit II., and B\u00e1nsdeo or B\u00e1usdeo.\n\nBy the time that B\u00e1nsdeo had ascended the cushion, the Muslim armies of the Dehli emperors had begun to invade the district. He, probably, was the r\u00e1ja of Maghar who was attacked and forced into tribute about 1570. At the same time Maghar became the quarters of a Muslim garrison. But whether B\u00e1nsdeo was then the reigning prince or not, we know that he found Maghar unpleasantly crowded with the imperial soldiery, and that he migrated to a place called the Promontory (Komar). Being surrounded on almost every side by the R\u00e1pti, his new home was deemed a safe refuge. From his name it is said to have derived its modern appellation of B\u00e1nsi. In just the same manner, in just the same century, and perhaps with just the same amount of truth, the great town of B\u00e1ns Bareli is said to have taken its title from two brothers called B\u00e1usdeo and Bareldeo.\u00b9 But B\u00e1nsi is as likely to mean the\n\n\u00b9 See Gazr., V., 653.\nvillage of bamboos as anything else. A legend which makes St. Kabir predict prosperity to B\u00e1nsdeo if he left Maghar is probably an anachronism. Kabir seems to have died before 1450.\n\nB\u00e1nsdeo died childless, leaving, however, his widow pregnant. His prime minister, a Shukul Brahman of Shergarh near B\u00e1nsi, seized the opportunity of usurping the cushion. In his successful intrigues he was aided by the K\u00e1yaths of Saw\u00e1rd\u00e1nd and Chitiona. But the r\u00e1ni fled for life to her father, the Chauh\u00fan r\u00e1ja of Mainpuri; and at that place gave birth to a posthumous son, Ratan Singh. As usual in such legends, Ratan on attaining manhood recovered his patrimony. Returning to Basti with a few faithful followers, he enlisted the aid of the Solankhi r\u00e1ja of Katahla. By that prince's advice he settled in a village which he called after his own name, Ratanpur; and for several years occupied himself in the organization of a party. At last his opportunity arrived. Through one of the usurper's mistresses, who was intriguing with one of the usurper's slaves, he procured the assassination not only of that usurper but of that usurper's K\u00e1yath allies. He then succeeded to the bulk of his father's power. But the Muslims still remained at Maghar, and in their marches between Faizabad and Gorakhpur continued to overrun the south of the principality.\n\nIn the story of Ratan's restoration there is much of the improbable. The commonplace of ancient romance, whereby a single youth survives to revivify a family, is twice employed. The K\u00e1yaths of Saw\u00e1rd\u00e1nd and Chitiona are said to have been perpetuated by an ancestor who as a boy had been the sole remnant of Ratan's massacre. The r\u00e1ja of Katahla was an ancient foe of B\u00e1nsi; and in those days such feuds were not lightly forgotten. Ratanpur of tappa B\u00e1rikp\u00e1r is placed in that r\u00e1ja's territory; and an act of dominion such as giving his name to a village would scarcely have been permitted to an adventurer of a hated family. It is probable, however, that Ratanpur was not a part of Katahla. In the Institutes of Akbar Ratanpur and Katahla are entered as separate parganas, which in this part of the country generally meant separate principalities. The mention of Ratanpur in the Indian Domesday Book shows that Ratan's restoration must have taken place before 1596-98. The fact (if it be a fact), that his father left Maghar not earlier than 1570 would leave little time for the events narrated in the legend. But if Alexander founded Alexandria before he was 25, there is no reason why Ratan should not have founded Ratanpur at an equally early age.\n\n1 His followers say he lived 300 years, from 1149 to 1449; and accepting the latter date as that of his death, H. H. Wilson makes him flourish in the beginning of the fifteenth century.\n2 This castle stood within what is now S\u00edr\u00e1p\u00e1r village.\nThe Institutes had hardly named Katahla as a separate tract before it was absorbed in Ratanpur-B\u00e1nsi. The raja who had befriended Ratan died, leaving a widow and an infant son. The brother of the late prince succeeded by usurpation, while the widow and her child fled. But when the Tiw\u00e1ri of Chittia, a descendant of that Tiw\u00e1ri who had brought Chandra Sen to the district, pledged his writing for their safety, both widow and child returned. The latter was shortly afterwards murdered by his uncle; and upbraided by the bereaved mother, the Tiw\u00e1ri died of remorse. But on his deathbed he bade his heir avenge the murder which his negligence had permitted; and when the funeral rites were over that heir sought raja Ratan. Ratan was easily persuaded to turn his arms against his usurping neighbour. Sallying forth on pretence of hunting, he attacked and slew the raja of Katahla, who was fishing with a few friends. And Katahla itself was at once annexed to his own domains.\n\nWhen Ratan died is uncertain. By one account his death occurred in 1527; by another he is said to have annexed Katahla in 1530; but from what has preceded it will be seen that both dates are probably a long lifetime too early. He was succeeded by his descendants, rajas Tej II., Makrand II. or Mukram, Sakat, Part\u00e1b II., Kunj, and R\u00e1m II. Before his death in 1716 the last had treacherously slain and seized the lands of Kesari, Kulh\u00e1ns raja of Ras\u00falpur.\n\nThis R\u00e1m had two sons. The elder, Bhagwant, was slain in his father's lifetime by the roving Banj\u00e1ra freebooters who had now begun to harass the north of the district. The younger, M\u00e1dhu II., succeeded, but his rule was constantly disputed by Tej, son of the deceased Bhagwant. Peace was at length restored when M\u00e1dhu promised to abdicate after a certain term of years in favour of Tej; but before the expiry of that term the death of his uncle had already put the nephew in possession. After a reign of twenty years Tej II. was succeeded by his son Ranj\u00edt; but now began another internecine conflict. Ranj\u00edt's younger brother Dalj\u00edt revolted, was defeated and was imprisoned. Escaping after seven years he took service with the Chandel raja of Shi\u00far\u00e1jpur in Cawnpore, who appointed him manager of certain estates in Oudh. Here Daljit had the good fortune to save the wife of the reigning naw\u00e1b from the hands of some Rohilla marauders; and the grateful Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula (1756-75) lent him a force wherewith once more to try his fortunes in Basti.\n\n1 The first statement is made in Mr. Thomsen's notes; the second in the Rajas and Naw\u00e1s. The chronology of the latter authority is, however, little to be trusted. It brings Chandra Sen to Basti in the reign of Sh\u00e1hjah\u00e1n (1628-58); adds 32 generations; and after this addition informs us that Ratan \"became raja of Katahla in 1530.\"\n2 See above, pp. 444-45 and 447.\n3 For a long account of the Shi\u00far\u00e1jpur family see above, pp. 60-67.\nThe rival brothers met at Panghat\u00e1gh\u00e1t, about 6 miles east of B\u00e1nsi. Seeking one another out, they fought a single combat in which Ranjit was slain and Daljit mortally wounded. The unexpected death of both claimants led to a compromise by which B\u00e1nsi became, like Sparta, a land of two kings. Bah\u00e1dur and Sarabjit, the infant sons of Ranjit and Daljit respectively, were set up as joint r\u00e1jas. To the former B\u00e1nsi and to the latter Narkata were assigned as residences. On the death without issue of Bah\u00e1dur in 1777, his brother and successor Jagat attempted to dethrone Sarabjit. The result was that, calling in the aid of the B\u00fatwal r\u00e1ja, Sarabjit defeated and slew him. Thus were once more united the two parts into which the B\u00e1nsi domain had been divided. But that domain was greatly diminished by the reckless prodigality of its now sole owner. Towards the close of the last century Sarabjit bestowed no less than 987 villages around Bakhira on an illegitimate son, the ancestor of the rebellious B\u00e1bu of that place. On the attainder of the latter in 1858 these villages became confiscated to Government.\n\nSarabjit himself died childless, but not before he had adopted as his heir a son of the now very distantly related r\u00e1ja of Anaula. The new chief, Shri Pr\u00e1k\u00e1sh Singh, was succeeded by his son Mah\u00edp\u00e1l; who, dying childless, was succeeded by his brother Mahendra. During the great rebellion r\u00e1ja Mahendra distinguished himself by his loyalty to Government. For his services he was rewarded with the Companionship of the Star of India and with the forfeited estates of the rebel r\u00e1ja of Nagar. He was succeeded in 1868 by the present r\u00e1ja R\u00e1m III. Like the other r\u00e1jas of the district the chiefs of B\u00e1nsi were once independent princes; like the other r\u00e1jas of the district, they are still extensive landholders. Their estates in parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur East, B\u00e1nsi, Ras\u00falpur, Maghar, Basti, and Nagar, pay the State a revenue of Rs. 56,000. Their principal seat is Narkata on the R\u00e1pti, just opposite B\u00e1nsi.\n\nSomething of the S\u00farajbansi r\u00e1jas of Mahauli, who about three hundred years ago wrested that parganah from the aboriginal R\u00e1jbhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas, has been said in describing the S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jputs themselves. Compared with the Sarnets of B\u00e1nsi, these Mahauli R\u00e1jputs are a comparatively modern house. While claiming Ajudhya as their prehistoric home, they admit that their re-arrival in this neighbourhood dates no earlier than the sixteenth century. Whether there be truth in\n\n---\n\n1 1185 of the harvest sra.  \n2 Mr. Thomson says adzim, that is deputy of the Oudh Government. But the B\u00fatwal r\u00e1ja was at this time practically independent. Under the suzerainty of Oudh the r\u00e1jas were, as above shown (p. 446), tributaries, not subjects. The B\u00fatwal r\u00e1ja some eleven years later waged war on his own account with the r\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed. And it may be doubted whether the naw\u00e1bs of Oudh would have ventured to keep a deputy in his domains.  \n3 Of Gorakhpur.\ntheir assertion that they came from Kum\u00e1un is doubtful; but it may be conceded that they were led by two brothers named Alakdeo and Tilakdeo. Slaying Kaulbil the R\u00e1jbhar, and annexing his lands, these chiefs thereby gained a goodly nucleus for their later acquisitions. From some later emperor of Dehli their descendants obtained the title of P\u00e1l, which is still suffixed to the names borne by members of the house. Amongst those descendants is the present r\u00e1ja of Mahauli or Mahson, Bhaw\u00e1ni-Ghul\u00e1m P\u00e1l. Mahauli village was the old and Mahson was the present seat of his family. His estates, lying partly in parganahs T\u00e1nda and Akbarpur of Faizabad and partly in parganahs Mahauli and Ras\u00falpur of Basti, pay Government a land-tax of Rs. 22,000.\n\nThe Mahauli family has extensive ramifications in the south of the district. From this stock spring the B\u00e1b\u00fas of S\u00edktar and Matauli, of Pars\u00e1in, Hariharpur, Jaswal, Bh\u00e1npur, S\u00eds\u00e1i, and R\u00e1mpur. Half the villages of parganah Mahauli are in truth held by members of the r\u00e1ja's clan or by grantees (birtiya) of former r\u00e1jas.\n\nBut besides the Mahauli clan there are other S\u00farajbansi families who, while claiming the same general origin, invaded the district at other times and from other places. Such are the S\u00farajbans\u00eds of parganah Amorha, whose ancestor K\u00e1nhdeo migrated from Faizabad early in the seventeenth century. According to one account he came hither as a follower of his kinswoman, a Jaipur princess who had wedded the emperor of Dehli. But this is merely another version of the story which bestows Amorha on a K\u00e1yath favourite of Akbar's Kachhw\u00e1h\u00edn wife. The more trustworthy tradition tells how, after assisting a K\u00e1yath to expel the Bhars and become r\u00e1ja of Amorha, K\u00e1nhdeo claimed some portion of the booty for himself. This was at length conceded to his son Kansnar\u00e1yan, who by compromise with the K\u00e1yath r\u00e1ja obtained the eastern half of the parganah. But with half the S\u00farajbans\u00eds did not rest content. Slowly but surely ousting the K\u00e1yaths, they became, what they are still, the dominant landholding body in Amorha.\n\nThe r\u00e1jas of Basti belong to the same stock of Kulh\u00e1ns R\u00e1jputs as those Ras\u00falpur r\u00e1jas who were extinguished by the house of B\u00e1sni. But of this, to judge from the account supplied to the official R\u00e1jas and Naw\u00e1bs, they seem themselves unaware. That account is to the effect that a R\u00e1jput named M\u00e1dhu Singh had inherited from his ancestor Gardhi certain lands annexed without imperial warrant from the Bhars of parganah Basti. This M\u00e1dhu was in 1330 defeated and dispossessed.\n\n1 Census Report of 1865, note on castes of Gorakhpur and Basti. 2 Supra, p. 442.\nby Udhar\u00e1j Kulh\u00e1ns of Bhagulam, who by implication must be held to have acted with the sanction of the Dehli emperor. From Udhar\u00e1j, who before his death had annexed the whole parganah, is descended the present r\u00e1ja.\n\nThis statement errs perhaps on the side of modesty. It leaves out of sight the fact that the Basti domain is a remnant of the Kulh\u00e1ns kingdom, which once extended from the heart of Bahraich to the heart of this district. Mr. Thomson traces the foundation of that kingdom to one Sej, who with his brother Tej came from a village south-west of Dehli. The Oudh Gazetteer brings Sej or Sahaj from Bagl\u00e1n\u00e1, the western frontier of the Narbada valley, in the time of the Tughlak emperors (1321-1412). In either case the tradition of Sej's treacherous annexation is the same. Ugrasen, the Dom r\u00e1ja of Gonda, demanded his lovely daughter in marriage. Dissembling his rage at the proposed m\u00e9salliance, the Kulh\u00e1ns made preparations for a wedding; but at the wedding-feast drugged and slaughtered the whole of the bridegroom's party. The story is common enough. It accounts, in Gorakhpur, for the destruction of Domkat\u00e1rs by Sarnets; and led Buchanan to suppose that it was the Kulh\u00e1ns, and not the Sarnets, by whom the Domkat\u00e1rs were overreached.\u00b9\n\nBut however the Kulh\u00e1ns kingdom was established, we know that it included not only most of Gonda and Bahraich, but parganahs Ras\u00falpur and Basti of this district. According to Basti tradition Ras\u00falpur was bestowed on Tej, the brother of Sej; but it not long afterwards reverted to the line of the latter. The remainder of the kingdom was retained by Sej himself, who distributed it in fiefs each seven miles long amongst his principal knights. About tenth\u00b2 in descent from Sej was Achalnar\u00e1yan, who granted parganah Basti to his cousin, the ancestor of the present r\u00e1ja. And here, so far as the r\u00e1jas of Basti are concerned, the history of the Kulh\u00e1ns tribe might cease. But nothing can be lost by telling briefly the fate of its other branches.\n\nKing Achalnar\u00e1yan is a villain of local romance. The last act in his career of unbridled tyranny was to carry off to his castle in Gonda the maiden daughter of a small Br\u00e1hman gentleman. The outraged father pleaded as vainly as the father of Chryseis; and his vengeance was more complete. Starving himself to death before the gates of the oppressor, he before death pronounced a curse on that oppressor's dynasty. His ghost sought the Sarju, the faithful friend of Br\u00e1hmans, and prevailed on that river to avenge him. The Sarju sent up its bed a lofty wave which washed into nonentity the wicked\n\n\u00b9 Eastern India, II., 461; supra, 356, 435; Oudh Gazetteer, I., 540. \u00b2 The pedigrees of the Bhab\u00edp\u00e1i and Chhedw\u00e1ra families in Gonda show seven and thirteen generations respectively. The Gonda mean is therefore ten; and by Basti tradition also Achalnar\u00e1yan was tenth in descent from Sej.\nking, his castle and his household. There followed several years of anarchy, during which the kingdom was broken up amongst contending chieftains. But Sakat, the posthumous son of Achalnar\u00e1yan, succeeded in retaining a small domain which included Babhnp\u00e1ir in Gonda and Ras\u00falpur in this district. Babhnp\u00e1ir became the fief of a younger son; and at the death of K\u00edrat, the third descendant of Sakat, Ras\u00falpur alone remained in the possession of the direct line. R\u00e1jpur in that parganah was the capital of the principality. But the fifth successor of K\u00edrat, Kesari Singh, lost, as already seen, both life and lands to the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi.\n\nThe luckless Kesari left an infant son named Chhiatarp\u00e1l, who on attaining manhood obtained from Dehli a warrant reinstating him in his father's possessions. But finding himself unable to enforce the warrant, he retired to Babhnp\u00e1ir, where he was recognized as r\u00e1ja; and the present r\u00e1n\u00ed of Babhnp\u00e1ir is his representative. His uncle, the brother of Kesari, submitted to the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi; and left descendants who may still be found in Chaukadda, Sh\u00e1hpur, and Awainia villages. But of all direct male descendants from the ancient Sej, the Basti r\u00e1jas are the most important. Their estates in parganahs Haveli and Dhuri\u00e1p\u00e1r of Gorakhpur, in parganahs Basti, Amorha, Nagar, Mahauli, and Maghar of this district, pay Government a revenue of Rs. 33,142. Their seat is at Basti. The present r\u00e1ja is Mahesh S\u00edtlabakhsh Singh.\n\nBesides the three existing houses of r\u00e1jas, there were within the last quarter century two others which, though extinct in their main or titled branches, have not altogether perished.\n\nThese were the Gautams of Nagar and the K\u00e1yaths of Amorha. The ancestor of the Gautams, Jagdeo or Jagatjot, is said to have come hither from Southern India, but is more likely to have come from Argal in Fatehpur. Taking possession of a dozen villages which he had received as dower with his wife, he found the neighbourhood of Nagar ruled by a Domkat\u00e1r or Bhar r\u00e1ja named Badal. This Badal, otherwise Laila, had named Nagar Lail\u00e1p\u00e1r; and his father Rahila had named and fixed his headquarters in a village called Rahilw\u00e1ra. Jagdeo expelled Badal and built a castle on the shore of the Ch\u00e1ndu lake. He is said also to have named the principality, which he now founded, Aurangabad Nagar; but the first part of that name was probably given much later, in the reign of Aurangz\u00e9b (1658-1707). Jagdeo's grandson, r\u00e1ja Bhagwant R\u00e1o, was slain by an Afgh\u00e1n governor; but his son or grandson Chande R\u00e1o expelled the usurper and recovered the principality. Chande's great-great-grandson, r\u00e1ja Gajpati R\u00e1o, fixed his capital at Ganeshpur. The descendants of his brothers, whom he robbed of all their lands,\nmay be found as landholders at Penda, Bhainsi, and a few villages of the Basti and Haraia tahsils.\n\nThat Gajpati's brothers should have had any lands of which to be robbed may at first seem strange: The other great clans of Basti had a strictly monarchical constitution. The r\u0101ja, the representative of the eldest branch, retained complete authority over the whole of the ancestral domain. Arbitrary assignments of land might sometimes be made for the support of younger sons; but these were purely optional, were often revoked, and involved no sacrifice of the political suzerainty. With the Gautams of Nagar it seems to have been otherwise. Theirs was a democratic form of inheritance. Each cadet succeeded of right to some share of land and some share of sovereign power. Thus, of Gajpati's eight younger sons, four obtained the Pipra barony (ta'alluqa), containing 60 villages; while four others obtained that of Ganeshpur, containing 54. Some of the descendants of the Pipra chiefs rebelled in 1857; and 12 of the villages therefore confiscated were bestowed on Mr. W. Cooke, who during that troublous year had deserved well of Government. Of the Ganeshpur chiefs, three died childless; but the descendants of the fourth may still be found in various villages of pargana Nagar. Somewhat reduced by the claims of younger sons, the Ganeshpur barony was early in this century sold for arrears of revenue. The purchaser, Mrs. Fidden, widow of a gentleman who was at once a medical official and a timber-merchant, sold it to Government. And Government bestowed it on some reclaimed Pind\u0101ri cosacks whose descendants still live at Ganeshpur.\n\nThe younger sons of r\u0101ja Harbans, who succeeded Gajpati, received in like manner a barony of 60 villages, which they divided amongst themselves. In the time of r\u0101ja Ambar, the fifth descendant of Harbans, other 60 were granted away or sold for arrears of revenue. But by way of compensation, Ambar robbed his kinsmen Nih\u00e1l and Raghu of 60. Two or three generations later, or seventeen from r\u0101ja Jagdeo, the direct male line of the family failed; and the head of a collateral branch became r\u0101ja. On the establishment of British rule in 1801, one R\u0101mprak\u0101\u015b Singh held the title. The domain for whose revenue he engaged included 114 villages; and he was allowed also a seignioralty on the revenue of 62 others held by grantees of himself or former r\u0101jas. But his line was destined to a violent end. His fourth successor, r\u0101ja Jaiprat\u0101p, was slain in an affray with the landholders of Dengr\u0101pur; while r\u0101ja Udai-prat\u0101p, Jaiprat\u0101p's brother and successor, committed suicide while awaiting\n\n---\n\n1 The same was the case with the Bisens of Mahadewa, a not very distant parganah in the adjoining district of Gonda. See Oush Gazetteer, I., 510.\ntrial for rebellion in 1858. For that rebellion the title and estates were confiscated, the latter being bestowed, as already noted, on the r\u0101ja of B\u00e1nsi. But Udaiprat\u00e1p\u2019s son Bishn\u00e1th is still living.\n\nA Gorakhpur tradition makes the founders of the Nagar and Amorha dynasties allies. But in describing them as contemporaneous with Akbar (1556-1605), it is probably just as mistaken as in connecting Jagdeo Gautam with the Gahlot house of Udaipur. The twenty-three generations with which the Nagar dynasty is locally credited would argue a far higher antiquity than three centuries. According to Basti legend, the founder of the Amorha principality came hither some four hundred years ago. The Th\u00e1ru aborigines of pargana Amorha, it says, had been expelled by some Bhars, who fixed their capital at Choil-k\u00e9zi in tappa Rimgarh. The last Bhar chief, Mani\u00e1r, sought by force to marry the daughter of a high Br\u00e1hman living at Barhar. And to frustrate his honourable though highly insulting intentions, the Brahman doctor, Bidy\u00e1dhar of Ajudhya, summoned from Mirzapur a Sirk\u00e1ri K\u00e1yath named R\u00e1\u00ed Jagat Singh. Jagat hastened to obey the bidding of his spiritual master, and arriving in Basti slew Mani\u00e1r. For this act of valour Bidy\u00e1dhar rewarded the K\u00e1yath with the sacred thread, which the K\u00e1yaths of Amorha have ever since worn. But this \u201crewarding with the sacred thread\u201d is probably a mere phrase to express the idea that Bidy\u00e1dhar consecrated Jagat as r\u0101ja. As r\u0101ja of Amorha, he was recognized by the Dehli emperor. But he was not long afterwards despatched as governor to Guj\u00e1r\u00e1t, leaving his son Dodr\u00e1j behind him as regent.\n\nDodr\u00e1j was slain by his father\u2019s ally K\u00e1nhdeo S\u00farajbansi, who usurped the cushion; but the interloper was expelled by Khemr\u00e1j, the second son of Jagat. Then the S\u00farajbansis succeeded in killing Khemr\u00e1j\u2019s son and successor. But the next heir went to Dehli, turned Musalm\u00e1n, and, like the converted r\u0101ja of Majhauli, assumed the name of Sal\u00edm Khan. Having by this apostate device obtained the loan of an imperial force, he returned and ejected the R\u00e1jputs. But it has been already shown that he or his representative was at last obliged to surrender half the principality to K\u00e1nhdeo\u2019s son Kansnar\u00e1yan. The turncoat Sal\u00edm was himself dethroned by his unregenerate Hindu cousins, Karan and Ashkaran. But the reunion of church and state was, as we have seen, unable to check the tide of S\u00farajbansi aggression. The descendants of Karan\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, p. 442.  \n2 If not a Br\u00e1hman, almost every r\u0101ja is by courtesy a R\u00e1jput; and as a R\u00e1jput is entitled to wear the sacred thread. In days and places of Hindu rule the founder of a dynasty was consecrated by some Br\u00e1hman, who invested him with this thread (janeo), painted his forehead with the frontal mark (tilak), and hailed him as r\u0101ja. This explanation is given because Mr. White (Settlement Report) rewards Jagat with the \u201cBrahmanical thread\u201d for \u201cpreserving the purity of the Brahman blood.\u201d  \n3 Supra, pp. 440.\nand Ashkaran live in reduced circumstances at Chauri and Sikandarpur villages. Another branch of the family once held the office of parganah registrar (k\u00e1n\u00faingo), which was forfeited for treason in 1857; but still survives in Ridhaura village.\n\nThe last r\u0101ja of Amorha, Jang Bah\u00e1dur Singh, died in 1855. He was succeeded by his widow r\u0101ni Jagatr\u00e1j Kunwari, whose estates and title became forfeit for implication in the great rebellion. The former were, in reward for her loyalty, bestowed on the r\u0101ni of Basti.\n\nIn relating the vicissitudes of the house of B\u00e1nsi mention was twice made of the Chittia Tiw\u00e1ris. Though neither rich nor titled, these Br\u00e1hmans can boast a pedigree as ancient and as noble as that of any family in Basti. When the three sons of r\u0101ja Chandra Sen became respectively rajas of Sat\u00e1s\u00ed, Maghar, and Anaula, they respectively selected as their prime ministers the three sons of the Chittia Tiw\u00e1ri. The descendants of the officials thus appointed may to this day be met at the capitals of the three principalities\u2014at Gorakhpur, B\u00e1nsi, and Anaula. But they still recognize as their chiefs those far distant cousins who still live at Chittia of B\u00e1nsi. The cordial understanding between the B\u00e1nsi rajas and their Br\u00e1hman friends has stood the test of at least half a thousand years. The sons of Bhol\u00e1n\u00e1th Tiw\u00e1ri, a late member of the Chittia family, still hold several villages which their father received from r\u0101ja Sarabjit. But against itself the house of Chittia is divided. Feuds and litigation between its various branches have been and still are frequent. Yet, though such quarrels and the partition of their ancestral estates amongst many sons have deprived them of that union which gives strength, the Chittia Tiw\u00e1ris have still great influence. It is doubtful whether the whole family would now acknowledge any one man as their head; but one of their best known representatives is named Ach\u00e1rajan\u00e1th. A kindred house, the Tiw\u00e1ris of Madanpur in B\u00e1nsi, are descended from ancestors who migrated from Majhauli on the invitation of their Chittia cousins.\n\nBasti is not one of those districts in which land changes owners rapidly. It has no large towns where ancient patrimonies may be squandered, or where the man of commerce may amass means to become a man of acres. True that in 1858, when the district was still a part of Gorakhpur, large areas passed into fresh hands through the rebellion of ancestral landlords. The case of the Bakhira B\u00e1bu was above cited. His comrade Il\u00e1hi Bakhsh Kh\u00e1n of Nandor was not an ancestral landlord, but lost many villages in the same hazardous speculation of revolt. Hargovind\nSingh of Menhd\u00e1wal forfeited about 20, and Wali Muhammad Chaudhari of Tilja 40 or 50. But a rebellion has occurred only once during British rule and is not likely to occur again. The exact area which since the formation of the district has been transferred by more peaceable methods it would be extremely difficult to estimate. But the following table, compiled and shortened from those in the yearly reports of the Revenue Board, supplies other statistics of a hardly less important nature:\n\n### ALIENATIONS.\n\n| Year | BY ORDER OF COURT | BY PRIVATE ARRANGEMENT OR INHERITANCE |\n|------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|\n|      | Sold              | Number of transfers by sale or otherwise | Sold | Number of transfers by sale, mortgage, succession, or otherwise |\n|      | Aggregate land-tax on property transferred | Price of property transferred | | Aggregate land-tax | Price |\n| 1864-65 | ... | 395 | ... | 283 | 1,475 | ... | 279 |\n| 1865-66 | ... | 1,065 | ... | 189 | 1,678 | ... | 409 |\n| 1866-67 | ... | 1,515 | ... | 75 | 3,366 | ... | 575 |\n| 1867-68 | ... | 9,254 | ... | 75 | 4,255 | ... | 682 |\n| 1868-69 | ... | 1,380 | ... | 189 | 5,066 | ... | 1,088 |\n| 1869-70 | ... | ... | ... | 151 | 12,955 | ... | 1,808 |\n| 1870-71 | ... | ... | ... | 159 | 4,390 | ... | 816 |\n| 1871-72 | ... | 3,107 | 7,591 | 58 | 4,273 | 1,23,826 | 1,473 |\n| 1872-73 | ... | 2,001 | 3,988 | 68 | 5,929 | 2,10,116 | 1,754 |\n| 1873-74 | ... | 872 | 4,204 | 79 | 7,185 | 3,23,294 | 2,675 |\n| 1874-75 | ... | 512 | 4,072 | 93 | 5,168 | 2,46,628 | 1,780 |\n| 1875-76 | ... | 210 | 2,543 | 138 | 5,624 | 3,39,841 | 1,958 |\n| 1876-77 | ... | 172 | 5,127 | 127 | 9,817 | 4,99,792 | 3,341 |\n| 1877-78 | ... | 81 | 4,085 | 111 | 4,092 | 3,08,859 | 2,746 |\n| 1878-79 | ... | 46 | 697 | 91 | 12,423 | 4,38,603 | 4,824 |\n| 1879-80 | ... | ... | ... | ... | 11,095 | 4,16,292 | 5,171 |\n\nIn descending from landlord to tenant we must not forget that the former is often his own cultivator. The last fifty years have in this respect witnessed a great revolution. It has been elsewhere mentioned that Buchanan divided the population into four classes, of which none save the lowest would either plough or reap. The land was owned almost exclusively by the highest, who called themselves *ashraf* or nobles; while the manual drudgeries of tillage were scornfully resigned to men of low degree, such as Kurmis, Mur\u00e3os, and Lodhs. In commenting on this state of affairs Briggs predicts that the landlords must sooner or later betake themselves as elsewhere to husbandry. And his prophesy has been verified.\n\n---\n\n1 Details showing the revenue on all lands confiscated for rebellion will be found below towards the close of this part of the notice.\n\n2 Land-tax in India, 219-20.\nnumber of \"useless mouths\" is probably quite as great now as then. But the increase of population has produced many fresh mouths, which can be filled only by the labour of their owners. Br\u00e1hmans and Rajputs still prefer to let their lands; but in cases where those lands are too narrow to support both a landlord and a tenant, the landlord himself cultivates. Amongst the tillers of the soil almost every caste is now represented. The low cultivating tribes lately mentioned are still, however, the best and most numerous agriculturists.\n\nNext perhaps in skill and numbers stand several classes common in the north of the district\u2014the Ahirs, Dheluras, and Trukia or Turkia Musalmans. The last, a fairish race with blue-grey eyes and beards more often brown than black, seem to be sparsely scattered all over the Tarai belt of these provinces. In some lately cleared northern tracts, where cultivators of these agricultural castes are also the landlords, the result is a great gain to the general prosperity. Tappa Ghos or Birdpur of Bans\u00ed, for instance, is owned chiefly by Kurmis, Mur\u00e1os, and Trukias. Though populous above the average, it is equally above the average in wealth. It exports grain largely. \"Crime,\" writes Mr. Wynne, \"is rare; litigation almost unknown. The proprietary being merged in the cultivating class, the burden of supporting an idle, profligate, and litigious body of zamindars is not thrown upon the land.\"\n\nAs elsewhere tenants may be divided into two classes\u2014those with rights of occupancy and those without. Rights of occupancy are heritable by descendants, but can be transferred in no other manner. And native nomenclature\u2014not necessarily the nomenclature adopted in native translations of the statutes\u2014has been shrewdly judicious in calling the possessor of tenant-right an hereditary (maurisi), the man that lacks it a non-hereditary (ghair-maurisi) tenant. Neither of these classes has in practice more than one subdivision. Occupancy tenants are distinguished into occupancy tenants proper and ex-proprietary tenants. But the latter, who were created by the Rent Act of 1873, have yet had little time to assert their existence; and speaking broadly, we may say that the rights of both subdivisions are acquired in the same manner. The occupancy tenant proper obtains his by continuous cultivation for twelve years as tenant; the ex-proprietary tenant, who as his name shows was once a proprietor, by continuous cultivation for twelve years as landlord.\n\nTenants-at-will, again, are sometimes subdivided into tenants of the landlord and sub-tenants of a tenant. But in the rights of these two bodies there is no practical difference; and Mr. Thomson describes the last as rare. Rare, too, are those leasehold tenants who belong to neither of the two classes already\nmentioned; who are neither tenants with permanent rights of occupancy nor tenants for one year only. In estimating the numbers and average holdings of cultivators we need therefore show but three great classes\u2014the cultivating landlord, the occupancy tenant, and the tenant-at-will. The following table, collated from the various settlement reports, gives the latest available statistics regarding each of these classes:\n\n| Parganah | Area in acres cultivated by | Number of cultivators | Average holding in acres |\n|----------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|\n|          | The proprietors themselves | Tenants with occupancy rights | Tenants-at-will | All three classes |                     |\n| Rasulpur | 40,667                      | 18,837                | 80,398               | 101,397            | 24,172               |\n| Banshi   | 64,525                      | 64,013                | 418,955              | 277,563            | 69,185               |\n| Binyakpur| 4,092                       | 4,541                 | 10,488               | 19,121             | 5,724                |\n| Nagar    | 23,088                      | 22,939                | 40,443               | 86,465             | 26,898               |\n| Basti    | 38,771                      | 15,637                | 68,743               | 113,156            | 33,12                |\n| Mahauli  | 35,141                      | 25,929                | 74,333               | 135,394            |                     |\n| Maghar   | 72,038                      | 51,649                | 92,446               | 219,127            | 62,783               |\n| Amorha   | 42,249                      | 24,785                | 38,642               | 105,676            |                     |\n| Total    | 320,561                     | 230,821               | 544,447              | 1,057,919          |                     |\n\nThe third column seems to accuse Mr. Wynne of underrating the strength of tenant right. Writing in 1864, he asserts that to the northern parganahs that boon and the Act (X of 1859) which created it are alike unknown. He had heard on this subject but one opinion, which was that tenancy lasted only so long as the landlord pleased. But Mr. Wynne's statements are confirmed by Mr. Thomson, who adds that, though the existence of occupancy rights has at length dawned on the peasant, the peasant seldom fights for them in court. In case of disputes he prefers to abandon his holding and migrate to some other village. Nor is it the obstacle of leases which prevents the twelve-year tenant from claiming these rights. Leases are next to never granted. The arrangement between landlord and cultivator is generally verbal, the latter remaining as long and only so long as he pays his rent.\n\nStatistics for the two last columns of the lines for parganas Mahauli and Amorha are wanting. But by way of compensation, for three other parganahs, fuller details than those of the last column can be given. Thus in Nagar the average holding of the cultivating zamindar landlord is 5 acres; of the cultivating birtiya landlord, 6; of the occupancy tenant, 8; and of the tenant-\nat-will, 3. In Basti the averages are for zamindars 9 acres; for birtiyas, 12 for occupancy tenants, 4; and for tenants-at-will, 3. The Maghar figures are for the first class, 10; for the second, 14; for the third, 3; and for the last, 2.\n\nFor \"average holding\" some such phrase as \"allotment per head\" would perhaps be more appropriate. Three or four acres is no doubt the quotient of the cultivated area divided by the cultivators. But in Indian agricultural society partnership of brothers is still the rule. One or two cultivating kinsmen club together, using the same scanty capital, fixed and circulating. And the average holding of such a firm, who may be legally considered as one person, amounts to something over 5 acres. That is about the area which, within the year, can be properly tilled by the common plough and the common pair of bullocks.\u00b9 The importance of a cultivator, or in other terms the size of his holding, is still measured by the number of ploughs he uses. Witness the following quatrain:\n\n\"Das hal rao; ath hal ramas;\nChar hal ka bare kusna.\nDo hal kheti; ek hal barai;\nEk hal se bhalt kuddari.\"\n\nTen ploughs, that is, make a knight; eight ploughs a squire; and four ploughs a substantial yeoman. For ordinary field-work two are enough; but one shall suffice you for a garden only. Than one, indeed, a hoe is better. Though this proverb speaks somewhat slightingly of the one-plough fraternity, it is certainly right in calling the cultivator with four ploughs, or over 20 acres, a substantial yeoman. From such large husbandmen were taken in former days the headmen of the village, and to them is still and therefore applied, in the present day, the title of mukaddam or mahto.\n\nHis ploughs in some cases indicate not only the amount of the rustic's substance, but the amount of the rustic's rent. In the northern parganahs are found holdings which, because their rental is assessed per plough and not per bigha, are known as \"ploughly\" (hulbandi). The accomplished pen of the late Mr. Wynne has left us the following description of this tenure:\u2014\"Where it prevails there is no separate rent-rate on the different fields; but each plough in the village is taxed by the zamindar at from Rs. 16 to Rs. 22 annually. It generally happens, then, that\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Thomson gives 5 acres as the area which can be easily cultivated by a single plough. In the neighbouring district of Gonda, writes the Oudh Gazetteer (I., 528), the ordinary plough will suffice for the cultivation of between 5 and 6 acres. Hence our own estimate.\nthe cultivators form themselves into petty joint-stock companies, with so many ploughs allotted to each; every individual claiming his share of the profits according to the number of ploughs contributed by him to the joint-stock. For instance, if there are 36 ploughs in a village, the lessee will perhaps keep six in his s\u016br,\u00b9 and the remainder will probably be divided into five thoks\u00b2 of 6 ploughs each. In one of them there may be two and in another a dozen shareholders, who cultivate all the fields of the thok in common, and divide the profits according to the number of ploughs they possess, whether one or two or even half a plough.\" Half a plough here as elsewhere means a plough with a single bullock. The tenure thus described is met with in Bharauli, Raithanlia, B\u00fadhan, Manoharpur, and other villages belonging to tappa Awainian of Ras\u00falpur. But in B\u00e1nsi it is still more familiar. Universal in tappa Kop of that parganah, it is common in tappas Kh\u00e1nkot and Dew\u00e1ichp\u00e1r, occasional in tappas Dhebarua, Khajahni, and Budhi.\n\nRents are paid chiefly, however, by a rate per bigha, or by a lump sum on the holding. Cash rents are the rule; but, especially in the northern or rice-growing parganahs, rents in kind are by no means uncommon. They are general, for instance, in tappas Dhebarua and Khajahni just mentioned. On many holdings in the same locality it is the fashion to pay partly in money and partly in crops. In such cases the kind rents are paid on the late rice-fields, and the cash rents on the rest of the holding. Thus in some villages of tappa Banjara Mr. Wynne found the land divided into plots of 10 bighas each, half that area being rented in money and half in crops. The cultivators had distributed themselves into small clubs or companies whereof each tilled one or more of these plots. Rents in kind are paid chiefly by the system known as bat\u00e1i, that is by dividing the garnered grain between landlord and tenant. The threshed and winnowed crop is arranged in heaps (r\u0101s), of which both parties take a certain number. In the north the heaps are five. The first is appropriated by the tenant, \"to cover the expenses of cultivation.\" Of the remaining four half are received by the landlord and half by the cultivator. Here, therefore, the rent is \u00bdths of the produce. But in the south six heaps are usual. The tenant gets, as before, choice of the first; and as before, at the autumn harvest, the rest are equally divided. But at the spring harvest the landlord obtains two only of the five heaps remaining. Thus the rent for an autumn crop is \u00bdths, and for a spring crop \u2153rd of the produce. The landlord has often, however, by the\n\n\u00b9 i.e., or his own personal cultivation. \u00b2 i.e., shares.\nadvance of Rs. 16 for the expenses of cultivation, forestalled the tenant's right to the choice of the first heap; and in this case his rent rises at harvest to \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\)ths, \\( \\frac{7}{8} \\)ths, or \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\), according to the circumstances aforesaid. The advance is sometimes made in seed; but the baig or bisar customs, which regulate such seed-loans, are described elsewhere.\\(^1\\)\n\nWith suits for the enhancement of rent the courts are rarely troubled.\n\nDebt owed to the landlord, or traditions of subordination, render the tenantry submissive to his will. This yielding temper and the prevailing ignorance form, of course, strong temptations to exaction. But in the north a host of rival owners, who would welcome fresh settlers to their wide waste-lands, prevent the cautious squire from too greatly or suddenly increasing the rents of his estate. It seems, nevertheless, admitted that after the opening of the expired assessment landlords recouped themselves for enhanced land-tax by a proportionate enhancement in their demands on the tenantry. The practice thus introduced was again observed when the term of the current assessment opened. But Mr. Thomson believes that since then rents have been almost stationary. And this belief is to a great extent borne out by the statistics of enhancement cases. During 1874-75 there were but 17 such cases for disposal; during 1875-76 but 5; during 1876-77 but 4; during 1877-78 but 4; and during 1878-79 but 22.\n\nIn most cases the proprietor seeks to raise his income, not so much by an addition to rents as by an addition to those petty manorial cesses (abw\u0101b) which in every half-civilized society are a common feature of the relations between landlord and tenant. Of such irregular exactions a list has been elsewhere\\(^2\\) given. Some few of them may not, perhaps, offend European notions of equity. In the small ground-rent (parjot, behri or ghardw\u0101r\u012b), for instance, taken from non-agricultural occupants of houses in the village, there seems nothing unusual or oppressive. But the bulk of these cesses are open to graver objections. Thus a domestic occurrence in the landlord's family, or the indulgence of his private taste for bricks and mortar, are seized as occasions for levying an aid or fine from the tenantry. In two cases Mr. Wynne ascertained that the income-tax imposed on the proprietor was collected rateably and without a murmur from the villagers. But such exactions are borne only up to a certain limit; and when overdone result in the flight of the cultivators.\n\nThe villages owned by Gosains, whose monastic vows withhold them from\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) Gazr. V., 635 (Bareilly); and VII., 125 (Farukhabad).\n\n\\(^2\\) Supra, p. 406.\nthis kind of extortion, are always the most densely inhabited in the neighbourhood.\n\nThe imposts just mentioned are one of the causes which tend to maintain the tenant's present poverty. Another is the rarity of tenant-right; for resistance to exaction can hardly be expected where revenged by ejectment at the end of the year. A third obstacle to agricultural progress is the uncertain demand for agricultural produce. The enterprise of the country has not reached that point at which traders anticipate years of scarcity by buying in plentiful seasons; and at ordinary times, therefore, export is little encouraged. But these are not the principal causes of poverty. Marriage expenses, the support of poor relations, the religious necessity amongst Hind\u00fas of begetting children, and the reluctance to emigration, are more valid reasons for the general impecuniosity. In quitting her father's house the daughter leaves behind her a substantial souvenir of debt. The comparatively modern introduction of the principle that the state should in times of dearth support the hungry is perhaps a step towards a regular poor law. But the absence of any such statute has hitherto thrown a multitude of needy kinsmen on the hands of the well-to-do. It has been said that famine is the horizon of the Indian villager, insufficient food his foreground. From the account already given of such visitations it will be seen that the Basti peasant has had little to bemoan in the way of famines. But insufficient food is the certain fate of those who must almost all become fathers, who will almost none quit the ancestral village for some less crowded field of labour elsewhere.\n\nIt is not for a moment admitted, however, that the peasant is as wretched as a fashionable pessimism represents him. Poor and indebted from his birth, he knows not better things; ignorant and unambitious, he does not seek them. \"Oh, too happy the husbandmen,\" cries Virgil, \"if they only knew their own blessings.\" The Basti husbandman is not too unhappy, because he does not know his own evils. Of the leisures and pleasures of life he no doubt enjoys but little. Except through the weary heats of summer, when agriculture is suspended, his life is one of almost unceasing toil. In the sweat of his face he truly indeed eats his bread. But he has so few appliances for otherwise killing time that his labour perhaps serves to keep him happy. Cultivation, moreover, is not the most unpleasant form of toil. The cultivator may not take an amateur gardener's loving interest in the growth of his plants. But his money-\ngrubbing instinct is gratified as he sees his crop become worth daily so many more pieces of silver.\n\nOver the peasantry of other countries the Indian agriculturist can indeed boast many advantages. In British India the security of life and property is greater than in most parts of Southern Europe. Though the mouths are many, food and tobacco are cheap. At most seasons little clothing is required. The cold of winter nights is no doubt uncomfortably felt by the few who do not possess blankets; but it is never sufficiently severe to cause actual pain. People who spend most of their lives out of doors need little furniture. A roof to shelter them from rain is all they require in the way of housing. Of the peasant's character, as apart from his condition, it is beside our purpose to speak. But family affection is strong within him; his good temper and politeness are innate; and who shall say that these gifts cannot do something to increase the general happiness? It is elsewhere urged, as evidence against the existence of any general misery, that the proportion of suicides to population is less in the agricultural North-Western Provinces than in the commercial England and Wales. But this argument need not be further pressed. If orientals fear death less than Europeans, they also perhaps fear less the ills of life.\n\nIf indebtedness is the lot of the tenant, it is none the less the lot of the landlord. By both it is regarded as an immemorial custom, almost as a necessary accident of existence. It probably causes its victims less uneasiness than does a cough or a cold. By both proprietor and peasant it is incurred in much the same manner. If the lower classes are averse from emigration, the upper are averse from labour. But common to both is the duty of maintaining their poor relations; common to both an excessive expenditure on weddings and a reckless improvidence in most other matters. Common to both, it may be added, are a great lack of education and a small ideal of comfort. But in bearing and social rank there is a marked difference between landlord and tenant. The former is descended as a rule from a conquering, the latter from a conquered race. Until the beginning of the British rule (1801) the latter was rather a villein than a freeman. Above the abject humility which was inherited from ages of ill-usage and oppression he has as yet lacked the vigour to raise himself. Traces of serfdom may even yet be found in the status of the professional ploughman (harv\u0101ha). The lately published Oudh Gazetteer does not indeed hesitate to apply to this person, in all its nakedness, the term of slave.\n\n\u00b9 Gazr., VII., 115 (Farukhabad).\nHis proper name is S\u00e1wak, a corruption of the Sanskrit Sr\u00e1vaka, a pupil or votary. It is therefore identical with the title of Sar\u00e1ogi, now bestowed on the Jains of the district.\n\nBut it is here applied rather to the lien by which the servile status is acquired than to the serf himself; and the latter generally passes by the name of S\u00e1waki, an adjective formed from S\u00e1wak. The servitude of the Basti S\u00e1waki is less permanent and therefore less real than that of his fellows in the neighbouring district of Gonda. There men in urgent need of money execute a deed by which, in consideration of a loan, they bind themselves and their posterity forever to serve the lender. The sum for which he sells himself and his children's children varies with the necessities of the borrower; but seldom exceeds 200 or falls short of 100 rupees. It is in fact about the price of a good pony. Here, however, the serf ploughman no longer sells his services for longer than one year. The term is generally less, as will be seen from the following description of the three kinds of S\u00e1waki found in the district.\n\nThe tihdra, ploughman is a tenant with a small holding, but no plough-cattle of his own. He works for two days in the fields of another man; and in return gets on the third day the use of that man's cattle and plough for his own fields. But even when his employer is also his landlord, his services do not absolve him from the payment of rent on his holding.\n\nThe darmdhddar is the serf of two masters. Half the day he works for one, and the remaining half for the other. His employment lasts for six months, from May-June to October-November. He receives between Re. 1\u00bd and Re. 1\u00bd monthly from each employer; but is liable to have his pay cut for every day on which the rain stops his plough.\n\nThe s\u00e1wakd\u00e1r or chhat\u00e1n works throughout the year one plough for one master. Ploughing therefore for both harvests, he gets at each a sixth of the garnered and winnowed grain; while once in the year he receives also a cheap blanket. Eastwards, however, his payment often consists in the privilege of tilling, with his master's plough and cattle, 15 bis\u00fads of rent-free land. The small but variable sum\u00b9 known as his S\u00e1wak or bondage-money is everywhere paid in advance. It bears no interest and is repayable only when the serf repudiates his yoke. But this he seldom does. Mr. P. J. White describes the possession of the money as a strong moral bond which prevents as a rule any breach of the contract. And no doubt it is felt as such by a class who, though they deem it a duty to perjure themselves in court on behalf of their friends, are on the whole by no means dishonest.\n\n\u00b9 From Rs. 10 to Rs. 25 generally, but in a few exceptional cases more.\nSuch is the not unsightly outline of the terms on which the plough-bondsman serves. But the colouring added by Mr. Wynne's Saharanpur Settlement Report is less pleasant. There he calls the Gorakhpur-Basti Sawakis \"veritable serfs, bought, with their own consent, it is true, by the loan of a lump sum; which, and the sum advanced monthly for subsistence, they are supposed to work out by their labour; and which, it is needless to say, is never shown in the zamindars' books as quite paid off.\" \"These men,\" he adds, \"live in the utmost squalor, with often not a sufficiency of even the most miserable food. A more wretched proletariat it would be difficult to find in any country.\" The actual slaves, described by Buchanan as introduced from the east, were never probably found so far west as this district. They were chiefly Kurmis. Their thraldom was hereditary; they lived in their master's house, and were not suffered to intermarry with free persons. Concubines who are virtually slaves are now perhaps, as then, imported from the hills for the harems of wealthy Musalmans. The beauty of the fair mountaineers is not unjustly prized by dwellers in districts adjoining the foot of the Himalaya.\n\nIn 1863 Mr. Wynne drew up several elaborate and not uninteresting statements showing the income and outgoings of three different classes of cultivators. His calculations, now somewhat out of date, are too lengthy for detailed reproduction here. They will be found in his Rasulpur Settlement Report (pp. 41 to 47); and we need merely give their general results. His first statement shows us the cultivator in easy circumstances, tilling 30 bighas with 5 ploughs, but saddled with a family of nine persons. Here the receipts were Rs. 476, the expenditure Rs. 461, and the balance at the close of the year Rs. 15. The next picture is that of a small cultivator with a family of 5 persons, a holding of 6 bighas and one plough; the receipts in this case being Rs. 98-8-0, the expenditure Rs. 95, and the balance Rs. 3-8-0. We are finally introduced to a professional ploughman whose holding and family are the same as in the second example. His earnings are Rs. 59-6-0, his spendings Rs. 49-2-0, and his surplus at the end of the year Rs. 10-4-0. The two last classes of cultivators, when not occupied by their own fields, seek labour elsewhere.\n\nIn considering the condition of the agriculturist we must not indeed forget that he can often eke out the profits of his scanty holding by some non-agricultural pursuit. He is often a fisherman or a currier as well as a husbandman. While his autumn crop is growing, watched by his old mother or his little boy, he can work on the roads. The wages which he earns in this fashion, as\nwell as those which repay more skilled labour, are shown in the following table. In it the present rates are compared with those of the Rebellion and another more recent year:\n\n| Class of artisan or labourer | Average daily wages in |\n|-----------------------------|------------------------|\n|                             | 1857 | 1867 | 1879 |\n|                             | Annas | Annas | Annas |\n| Porter or common labourer   | ...   | ...   | 1     |\n| Mason                       | ...   | ...   | 2\u00bd and 3 |\n| Carpenter                   | ...   | ...   | 4 and 5 |\n| Blacksmith                  | ...   | ...   | 3 to 5 |\n| Scullion and torch-bearer (mash'alchi) | ... | 4 | 5 and 6 |\n| Litter-carrier              | ...   | ...   | 4 and 5 |\n| Salt-petre-worker           | ...   | ...   | 6     |\n| Potter                      | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Dyer\u00b9                      | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Tailor                      | ...   | ...   | 3     |\n| Sawyer                      | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Confectioner                | ...   | ...   | 3     |\n| Metal-polisher              | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Saddle-maker                | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Cotton-cleaner              | ...   | ...   | 2     |\n| Metallurgist                | ...   | ...   | 4     |\n\nBut in the cases of day-labourers and perhaps of some few others these wages vary according to sex and age. Women get usually a quarter and boys a half less than men. In the wages of some workmen are included what are really the profits of their fixed capital. Thus the ploughman who uses his own plough and cattle receives from four to six annas daily; while his ploughless brother of the same craft receives but from 1\u00bd to two rupees monthly. The remuneration of the Sawaki ploughman, who gets a sort of retaining fee, is of course even less. But agricultural labourers of all sorts are as often paid in kind as in cash. And whether paid in cash or in kind, their wages vary according to the process which they perform. The rate for watching, for instance, varies slightly from that for reaping. Reapers sometimes receive, instead of a daily wage, a sixth share (bh\u0101ta) of the grain; but from this share is of course deducted the amount of the advance which they have generally succeeded in getting.\n\n\u00b9 Dyers are now described as paid by the yard, the rate varying according to the colour of the dye. *But the more usual remuneration is a rate of 6 annas per foot sawn, and not a daily wage.\nNo excuse is needed for passing from wages to the kindred subject of food prices. The following table shows, for the same years as the last, the prices of the principal cereals, millets and pulses:\n\n| Grain                  | Average weight purchaseable for one rupee in |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|\n|                        | 1857. | 1867. | 1879.\u00b9 |\n|                        | Sers. | Sers. | Sers. |\n| Barley                 | ...   | 28    | 14    | 25 to 29 |\n| Small purple peas (kirdo) | ...   | 32    | 20    | 20      |\n| Arhar pulse            | ...   | 24    | 7     | 1\u00bd      |\n| Jodr millet            | ...   | 28    | 17    | 23\u00bd to 26\u00bd |\n| Marua do.              | ...   | 30    | 20    | 24 to 29\u00bd |\n| Coarse rice            | ...   | 15    | 10    | 13\u00bd to 20 |\n\nIn an almost purely agricultural district like Basti grain-dealing and grain-lending are common forms of investment for capital. Cultivators borrow seed from the village landlord or corn-chandler, repaying it in kind at harvest. The interest charged is nominally 25 per cent., but is really much more. Why it so can be best explained by a quotation from the Farukhabad notice. \"The lender takes advantage of the natural fall in prices between the time of sowing, when they are highest, and of reaping, when they are lowest. The terms of the account are astutely shifted from kind to cash when grain is dear, and from cash to kind when it is cheap. Thus, if 10 sers of seed are borrowed for the spring sowings in K\u00e1rttik (October-November), when the price is Rs. 4 per maund of 40 sers, the lender's books debit the borrower with Re. 1. At the reapings in Bais\u00e1kh (April-May), when the market-rate has fallen to (let us say) Rs. 2 the maund, the cash-figure is reconverted to grain, and the debt appears as 20 sers. Interest is now added at the rate of 25 per cent., which raises the sum to 25 sers. As a matter of fact much more than 1\u00bd times the loan is repaid. In the extreme case just taken the debtor returns 2\u00bdfold.\" But for further details concerning the sharp practice of grain-lenders the reader is referred to the Farukhabad notice itself, to the Bareilly notice, and to Mr. Beames' note on Bisdr in his edition of Sir Henry Elliot's Glossary.\n\n\u00b9 As during the early part of 1879 prices had not altogether recovered from the influence of famine in 1877-78, it has been thought advisable to show those rates only which were prevalent from the beginning of June to the end of the year. To the prices here given may be added those of wheat, 15 to 16 sers; gram, 16 to 13\u00bd; and kodon millet, 18\u00bd to 24. On the last-named grain, which if taken in sufficient quantity has intoxicating or poisonous effects, the half-famished population of 1878 are said to have recovered their strength. For in the autumn of that year the kodon crop was unusually abundant. \u00b2 See Gazr., VII, 124-26; V., 634-36; and Beames' Elliot, I., 230-32.\nThe classes who lend money are much the same as those who lend grain; but amongst landlord usurers Br\u00e1hmans are especially conspicuous. Of large houses which confine their business solely to banking and money-lending there are few. When cheap ornaments are offered as security but half their value is lent; and if interest is charged, the rate varies from 12 to 18 per cent. yearly, according to the magnitude or pettiness of the transaction. When merely personal security is given, the interest rises from 16 to 37 per cent.; but if the borrower be a banker, with whom the lender has frequent dealings, as little as from 6 to 9 per cent. is charged. Here as everywhere, however, money is easily obtained only by those who want it least. Except to a wealthy firm, it is never lent on purely personal security. By others valuable jewels must be pledged or their lands mortgaged. In the former case from 6 to 18 per cent. interest is charged; in the latter from 9 to 18 percent. As received by the borrower, the loan is often less than its nominal amount. When large sums are lent, the usurer first deducts 5 per cent., by virtue of what is called his hakk pahr\u00e1wa, that is, perhaps, his preliminary right. Similarly, when small ornaments are pawned, one anna in the rupee is retained by the pawnee as hakk chhota or \"little right.\" Little right, indeed! the reader may exclaim. But it is only fair to mention that when such deductions are made the interest charged is less.\n\nWhen not invested in grain-dealing or usury, money seeks to multiply itself in land. Thus laid out it is expected to yield from 6 to 12 per cent. yearly. But it is from the safety rather than the profit of such investments that estates are purchased.\n\nThe openings for the speculator are indeed extremely few. Manufactures exist, but they are of the usual half agricultural description. Such is the sugar industry, which so far as the processes employed are concerned, has been described in the Budaun notice.\u00b9 But to the technical terms connected with the sugar-mill the following may be added. The hole through which the expressed juice escapes from the bottom of the mill is called kolhani; the wooden or earthen cup with which it is ladled into the cauldron, saika; the cauldron itself kardh; the wooden instrument wherewith the syrup is extracted from the cauldron, kh\u00e1ri, and the wooden vessel wherewith it is ladled into another cauldron, \u00e1dh; the iron skimmer with which the surface of the boiling juice is cleared, pona; the round flattish and earthen cooling-pan, ch\u00e1k; and the iron vessel which transfers to it the hot syrup, lanki.\u00b2 Connected with sugar are sweetmeats,\n\n\u00b9 Gazr., V., 83-84. \u00b2 For other terms connected with the sugar-mill, and for equivalents of these see Gazr., V, 53 (Budaun); ibid, 632 (Bareilly); supra, 412-13 (Gorakhpur); and Gazr., VII., 39-40 (Farukhabad).\nwhich to supply the local demand are concocted in cloying profusion. The manufacture of salt is as elsewhere prohibited, but considerable quantities of saltpetre are prepared by the Lunia, Nunia, or Nonera caste. Coarse cloth, coarse pottery, and neat though simple vessels of the baser metals are made in the few small towns and the larger villages. If charcoal-burning and hide-curing rise to the dignity of manufactures, both must be mentioned. In Basti and Northern India generally the carpenter is still what his name once implied, a cartwright.\\(^1\\) The principal products of his craft are wagons, ploughs and other agricultural apparatus. On the banks of the R\u00e1pti and Gh\u00e1gra are constructed a few clinker-built boats and barges. The method of building is perhaps peculiar to India. The prow and stern are exactly similar, and shall therefore be called the two ends. These ends and the bottom of the vessel are put together on the ground, in one flat piece, thus:\n\nThe ends are then bent up like those of a bow, being kept in that position by props; while the bottom is retained in its original flatness by weights. Next the sides are added; and our bow being now permanently strung, the props are removed. A few ribs are afterwards inserted for the sake of strength, but the vessel has no keel.\n\nIt is probable that, with the exception of sugar, few of the manufactures just mentioned are exported. The exports of Basti are limited chiefly to agricultural raw produce, a term in which unrefined sugar is included; and unrefined sugar, it should be explained, is sugar whose treacle has not been removed by pressing or straining. These agricultural exports find their way down-country by river to the marts of Gorakhpur and Bengal. The principal imports are the raw-cotton, cotton-stuffs, and salt sent by road from Cawnpore through Faizabad; the metal vessels and stone shipped by river from Benares and Mirz\u00e1pur; and the spices, drugs, iron and timber of Nep\u00e1l, which travel by both road and river. Proceeding from this general statement to details, we may classify the\n\n\\(^1\\) Lat. carpentarius, from carpentum, a cart or chariot.\ncommerce of Basti as external and internal, as trade with places outside the district and trade within the district itself.\n\nThe external trade, again, divides itself into trade with places outside British territory and trade with British territory itself. Let us begin with the foreign commerce. Until 1856 Basti was bounded on three of its four sides by native states, and the result was no slight check on trade. The cotton and other merchandise of western districts found the direct route to Basti and Nep\u00e1l practically closed. To avoid the exactions of Oudh, a wide detour through Jaunpur and Azamgarh was inevitable. Nor could river traffic attain its present development. The Oudh landholders levied harassing tolls on vessels passing up and down the Gh\u00e1gra. The annexation of Oudh introduced free-trade on the southern and western frontiers. But on the northern Nep\u00e1l still imposes certain restrictions on the natural course of commerce.\n\nThese restrictions are both direct and indirect. There are orders forbidding the passage of merchandise except by specified routes, and there is an objectionable system of taxing traders. The bulk of the traffic wending to and from Basti must pass through certain Nep\u00e1lese marts lying between our frontier and the foot of the hills. These are Sirsewa, Bah\u00e1durganj, and Captainganj, all in that Shi\u00far\u00e1j district which once formed a part of Gorakhpur-Basti. The two last are certainly modern foundations, being named respectively after the late Sir Jang Bah\u00e1dur and one of those captains who in the Nep\u00e1lese army command battalions. At Bah\u00e1durganj is quartered during the trading season a military force; and from this place probably are detached the patrols that watch the Basti border. An old mart further to the east, in what was once Gorakhpur, is B\u00fatwal. Through these towns is forced every form of Nep\u00e1lese export except fragrant resins (dh\u00fap), bankas grass, rough wood, grain, and clarified butter. But the tariff of exempted articles varies from place to place; and even for exempted articles a customs pass is required. The patrols prevent other commodities from passing the frontier except through the favoured dep\u00f4ts. If a British subject is caught crossing the border with prohibited goods, those goods are confiscated. A Nep\u00e1lese trader stopped under similar circumstances not only loses his wares but is turned back. Hence perhaps the common belief that Nep\u00e1lese subjects are forbidden to enter our territory.\n\nThe trade of the privileged towns is almost wholly in the hands of a few British subjects who have settled there as shopkeepers. They buy goods which\n\n---\n\n1 The term dh\u00fap is applied also to the wood, imported in small quantities, of the Juniperus excelsa, or pencil cedar. Dh\u00fap simply means, in fact, any fragrant fumigant used as incense; and to this use the wood just mentioned is sometimes applied.\nitinerant hucksters (baipdri) bring from British India, and sell these again to the hillmen. Conversely, they buy from the hillmen and sell to hucksters who are returning to this district. To take shops in the Nep\u00e1less marts these British subjects are practically forced by the fact that, if they do not, their merchandise is taxed at a rate about 25 per cent. higher. The Biskohar traders, most of them engaged in the Nep\u00e1l business, are said to complain bitterly of this regulation. \"If we may believe report,\" writes Mr. Fuller,\u00b9 \"the residence of the richer traders is rather enforced by official pressure than tempted by benefits.\" The so-called residents retire to British territory during the rains, when the malarious marts of the Nep\u00e1lese Tar\u00e1i are deserted. It may be urged that they need not return to Nep\u00e1l unless they please. But if they went not thither their occupation would be gone.\n\nThe prime object of these vexatious restrictions would seem to be the enrichment of the Nep\u00e1lese dep\u00f4ts at the expense of the British frontier towns. The latter, the natural and perennial centres of trade, have undoubtedly suffered. Though larger than when the Nep\u00e1l marts were first established, and all exports from them to British dominions forbidden under pain of death,\u00b2 the business of Biskohar has greatly declined. But these Nep\u00e1l marts, which are uninhabitable for a third of the year, cannot hope for any really corresponding gain. A second reason which perhaps forces traffic through them is, perhaps, the easier collection of the customs dues. In the same manner, it may be urged, and in a British municipality, imports must pass certain octroi outposts. In these Nep\u00e1lese towns customs dues are certainly levied; and it is a matter of regret that they are not levied by less uncertain methods. They are assessed in some cases on the load, in others on the weight, now on number and then on the value. The rate of taxation per maund, so far as can be gathered from Basti traders, is for the salt, sugar, potatoes, and tobacco imported into Nep\u00e1l, annas 4, 4, 10, and 4 respectively; for the exported cardamums and turmeric Rs. 5 and Re. 1\u00bd. But the taxes are farmed out to contractors and differ on the frontiers of different districts. All that is certain about them is their uncertainty; and their very arbitrary nature must have a rather discouraging effect on trade. Besides customs duties an octroi is sometimes levied on imports, while another impost known as khunt is taken from non-resident traders.\n\n\"A British trader,\" reckons Mr. Fuller, \"taking 100 maunds of coarse sugar (gur) to the Captainganj b\u00e1z\u00e1r will have to pay the following taxes.\n\n\u00b9 From whose able report on the Foreign trade of these provinces (1877-78) most of the information here given has been gathered. \u00b2 Gorakhpur-Basti Settlement Report, II., 76.\nThe value of a maund of gur is assumed to be Rs. 7, and the 100 maunds is presumed to be laden on 50 bullocks:\n\n| Rs. a. p. | Rs. a. p. |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Customs at | ... 0 0 9 per rupee of value | ... 32 13 0 |\n| Khunt at | ... 0 2 0 per bullock | ... 6 4 0 |\n| Plus octroi (if paid) at \u00bcth of total value | ... | ... 26 14 9 |\n| Total | ... | ... 65 15 9 |\n\n\"On his entry to a municipality in the North-Western Provinces he will not, as a rule, be taxed more than Rs. 12\u00bd, at the rate of 2 annas a maund. But it is not so much the amount levied by Nep\u00e1l that appears to be complained of as the manner in which it is levied. It is much to be wished that a fixed tariff of duties were published which would enable a trader to calculate with some certainty the profits of a venture, and give some basis on which illegal exactions could be complained of.\"\n\nFrom the restrictions on the Nep\u00e1l trade to the Nep\u00e1l trade itself. The two principal road-routes by which this enters Basti are: (1) from Sirsewa, Bah\u00e1durganj, and Captainganj, by way of Marni in the north-west corner of the district or of Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t on the B\u00e1nganga, above that river's junction with the R\u00e1pti; (2) from B\u00fatwal, ri\u00e2 Lautan or Uska. But most of the roads are little better than cart-tracks, and degenerate into such after crossing the Nep\u00e1l border. The produce of the Nep\u00e1l Tar\u00e1i enters the district by numberless by-paths or by no path at all. River-routes are provided by the B\u00e1nganga and Dhamela; but also, though not directly with this district, by the R\u00e1pti and other affluents of the Gh\u00e1gra.\n\nFive posts of the Agriculture and Commerce Department register the traffic passing to or from Nep\u00e1l by road. One, at Marni, watches the trade with Bah\u00e1durganj and Sirsewa; a second at Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t, that wending across the B\u00e1nganga and R\u00e1pti; the third at Uska; the fourth at Soh\u00e1s on the Kurna near Uska; and the fifth at Lautan, that which by several converging roads leaves or seeks B\u00fatwal. The value of the traffic which during the financial year 1878-79 passed these posts may be thus shown:\n\n| Post | Value in rupees of traffic, 1878-79. |\n|------|-----------------------------------|\n|      | Imports. | Exports. | Total. |\n| Marni | 1,00,816 | 2,32,362 | 3,33,170 |\n| Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t | 47,089 | 33,749 | 80,838 |\n| Uska | 4,64,570 | 34,387 | 4,98,957 |\n| Soh\u00e1s | 20,048 | 7,386 | 27,434 |\n| Lautan | 2,94,417 | 2,10,058 | 5,04,475 |\n| Total | 9,26,942 | 5,17,432 | 14,44,374 |\nThese returns are perhaps somewhat vitiated by the want of supervision and the unfitness, moral or mental, of the registering clerks. But \"whatever percentage of error they may contain, they do succeed in showing in broad lines of light and shade both the volume and the direction of exports and imports.\" The great excess of imports over exports will at once be noticed. The balance against Basti seems to consist chiefly in the value of the imported grain and timber. The cash paid for these articles is apparently retained in Nep\u00e1l, and not exchanged for British Indian commodities.\n\nThe imports from Nep\u00e1l are of two classes: those which are allowed to enter the district direct from the Tar\u00e1i, and those which traverse or proceed from the submontane marts. The Nep\u00e1lese hills are not near enough to maintain any direct trade with Basti, or rather their exports are unnaturally intercepted by the marts in question. The commodities supplied by the Tar\u00e1i are chiefly confined to unhulled rice and wheat; but barley and millets, gram and other pulses, are imported in more sparing quantities. The food thus introduced is collected at Lautan, Uska, and Menhd\u00e1wal. Hence it is sent, if intended for Calcutta, down the R\u00e9pti and the Gh\u00e1gra; or if intended for consumption in these provinces, across the Gh\u00e1gra to T\u00e1nda and Faizabad. Clarified butter, also, is of course largely imported from so well known a cattle-breeding tract as the Tar\u00e1i.\n\nBut with the exception of this grain and this clarified butter almost all the Nep\u00e1lese imports reach our border through the towns lying between that border and the hills. The principal articles thus received are drugs, fibres and fibre manufactures, hides, iron, oilseeds, spices, and timber; but to this list likewise should be added clarified butter and grain. Some opium also is imported; but as this must be contraband, the less said about it the better. The drugs, of which a large weight finds its way to Lautan, are nearly all non-intoxicating. They consist of ghurbach, the root of a flag (Acorus calamus) found in swampy places; lodh, the bark of a forest-tree (Symplocos racemosa); kaiphal, also the bark of a forest-tree (Myrica sapida); kaitha or terra japonica, the resin of the khair (Acacia Catechu); lob\u00e1n, bahroza or benzoin, the turpentine of the ch\u00edn pine (Pinus longifolia); kar\u00e1yal,\u00b2 the gum of the s\u00e1l (Shorea robusta); majith or Indian madder, the root of the small plant known as Rubia cordifolia; d\u00e1l hard, the yellow wood of the hill barberry (Berberis Lycium); ch\u00e1b, the berries of creeping plants of different species and the Piper genus; kakra singi, the horn (sing) like galls of the wild shrub called Rhus\n\n\u00b9 The quotation is from a letter (1880) by Mr. Buck, the Director of Agriculture and Commerce.\n\u00b2 Called also r\u00e1j, i.e., the gum par excellence; and dh\u00e1p or dh\u00fana, i.e., the fumigant.\nsuccedanea; kumkum, the young leaves of a genus named Didymocar pus; chiraita, the well-known liver medicine decocted from various species of Ophelia; pakh\u00e1nbed, the rhizome of Saxifraga ligulata; nirbisi or jadw\u00e1r, and aits, the roots of different species of Aconitum; with bikhman and singia, whose aconite origin is less certain. These drugs are used chiefly for medicinal and veterinary purposes; but we cannot linger further to describe their exact uses. An interesting note on the subject was contributed by Mr. J. Hooper, U.S., to the Agriculture and Commerce report for 1878-79. Mr. Hooper adds some half dozen other drugs whose botanical species he was unable to identify. The demand for such articles, chiefly spontaneous forest produce, surprises the inhabitants of the wild and wooded Nepalese hills. \"The Biskohar traders,\" they exclaim, \"are a strange folk, who give silver in exchange for sticks and leaves.\" One curious fact connected with the import of catechu and some other resins is that, in places where they are taxed at all, women and children are allowed to carry them across the frontier untaxed.\n\nThe fibres are those of the plant known as lariasan (Crotolaria juncea) and of the grasses bhanj and bankas (Spodicpogon angustifolium).\u00b9 The fibre manufactures are coarse jute sacks and coarse hemp cloth or matting (bhangra, bhangel).\u00b2 The alternative terms \"cloth or matting\" rightly express the great differences in the texture of this fabric. It is sometimes a coarse loose sacking; sometimes a compact wearing material; but in both cases of great strength and durability. Another stuff bearing the same name, with pua or allo prefixed, is made from the fibre of a plant called \"chahu shishan\" (Maoutia puya). This pua bhangra is finer, softer to the touch, and of a rather darker colour than the ordinary bhangra. The chief Basti mart for these fibre manufactures is Uska.\n\nNepalese hides and horns are imported in small quantities only. The iron is introduced in the form of either pig-iron or manufactured tools, such as pick-axe heads. But the import is decreasing in favour of the cheaper and better European article. The import of uncoined copper, though allowed in Buchanan's time, is now forbidden, being punished by the confiscation of the contraband metal. It is the not unreasonable conclusion of the Nep\u00e1l Government that the less raw copper is exported, the more coined copper will find its way into Hind\u00fast\u00e1n. The coppers known throughout these provinces as \"Gorakhpuri pice\" are largely coined at T\u00e1nsen in the P\u00e1lpa district, and largely imported into British India. The oilseeds are\n\n\u00b9 This identification was made at Kew. \u00b2 From bh\u00e1ng, the intoxicating wild hemp.\nchiefly linseed, rape (sarson), mustard (rai), and sesamum (til). The linseed seems as a rule to seek Lautan, the mustard Uska. A large quantity of these oilseeds finds its way down the R\u00e1pti and the Gh\u00e1gra to Calcutta.\n\nThe principal spice is turmeric, used in cookery as well as dyeing. The Nep\u00e1lese plant has a shorter, rounder, and yellower root than the variety known to the market-gardeners of the plains. Next to turmeric stand tejpat, the leaf of the cinnamon tree (Cinnamomum tamala); and timur, the aromatic berry of a shrub (Zanthoxylum alatum) found in the hills. The other spices are cinnamon itself, chilies, cardamums, ginger, black-pepper, coriander-seed, the hill betel-nut, and tree-lichens of kinds (burhna). But the latter are used as a perfume rather than a spice.\n\nThe timber which is the principal export of Nep\u00e1l is for the most part floated in logs down rivers such as the R\u00e1pti and the Dhamela. But a little of it passes also by road, in the shape of axles, cart-wheels, and other carpentry. The chief varieties are the woods of the s\u00e1l and \u00e1sna trees, both above mentioned as indigenous in this district also. S\u00e1l forests are the only plantations which the Nep\u00e1l Government takes any pains to preserve. But even s\u00e1l trees are rather recklessly felled; and unless some restraint is put upon this practice, the timber imports must surely decrease. S\u00e1l logs are so heavy that, to keep them afloat on their way down-stream, they must be lashed to \"dug-out\" canoes.\n\nExports from this district to Nep\u00e1l must in most, if not all, cases pass through the Nep\u00e1lese submontane towns. Chief amongst such exports are cotton-twist, cotton-stuffs, cocoanuts, hardware, salt, sugar, and tobacco. Probably on account of its heavy transport expenses, raw-cotton is little exported. Being both forced through the towns just mentioned, the cotton manufactures and the spices from Nep\u00e1l practically pay for one another. The former consist of a little country-spun yarn, a good deal of European piece-goods, and a far larger amount of native cotton. The European stuffs come chiefly via Gorakhpur from Gh\u00e1zipur; the little raw cotton and the country cloth from Faizabad or T\u00e1nda. The cocoanuts leave the district mainly by way of Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t. Hardly needful, perhaps, to note that they are a mere re-exportation, which cannot be produced in a country so far from the salt sea as Basti. The export of salt is increasing. But the Nep\u00e1lese prefer the Tibetan to the Indian chloride, and except in times of mourning, when the former is forbidden, rarely use the latter. Very little refined sugar finds its way into Nep\u00e1l. The exports, which adopt as\na rule the Kakrahigh\u00e1t route, consist chiefly of unrefined varieties like molasses (sh\u00edra).\n\nThe external trade with British territory may be trade with other districts of these provinces; or with districts of other Indian provinces; or even, through those other provinces, with England itself. The commerce with other districts of these provinces is of course the most important, but for the purposes of this notice need not be discussed as apart from the other two trades just mentioned. Materials, indeed, for any such separate treatment are wanting. In Basti the Department of Agriculture and Commerce registers Nep\u00e1lese traffic only. It may, however, be noted that the commodities exchanged between district and district in these provinces are chiefly limited to raw-produce\u2014cotton, unrefined sugar, grain, oilseeds, and timber. Exchanged also are salt, iron, and tobacco; but the two former come wholly, and the last partly, from other provinces or native states. The reason why imports and exports are chiefly unmanufactured is that the conditions and requirements of society are almost purely agricultural. There are no great manufacturing centres. On entering a district raw produce finds a limited manufacture in some small country town, whence the manufactured article is distributed to the immediate neighbourhood only.\n\nThe articles which Basti chiefly imports from British territory are raw cotton, cotton-goods, and salt. Next, after a long interval, come metal vessels, stone, and the timber of Gorakhpur or Gonda; but these need not be further mentioned. Cotton, which prefers a dry soil and climate, cannot here be grown in sufficient quantities for home consumption. It must, therefore, be imported. Produced in Bundelkhand and the D\u00fa\u00e1b, it is collected in the great emporium of Cawnpore. Hence in a raw or manufactured form it is sent across the Ganges to Faizabad or T\u00e1nda, and from these marts passes over to Basti. It travels mostly by road, eschewing as a rule the Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway. Of European cotton-goods much comes from Calcutta and little from Bombay. The imports of piece-goods are ten or a dozen times as great as those of cotton-yarn. The principal distributing centre is Gh\u00e1zipur, near the railway from Calcutta; and from Gh\u00e1zipur these manufactures travel to Basti by way of\n\n---\n\n1 A since closed post at the Ku\u00e1na-bridge near Basti registered in 1878-79 the traffic passing along the Faizabad and T\u00e1nda roads\u2014that is a certain amount of the traffic with Oudh. The value of the imports from Faizabad was returned as Rs. 3,24,838, and from T\u00e1nda as Rs. 2,16,578; total Rs. 5,41,411. The corresponding figures for the exports were, towards Faizabad, Rs. 3,90,469; towards T\u00e1nda, Rs. 3,21,621; and total Rs. 7,12,090.\nAzamgarh or Gorakhpur or both. Here as elsewhere in the North-Western Provinces the manufacture of salt is forbidden, and that necessary is imported chiefly from Jodhpur and Jaipur in Rajputana. But rather more English salt, from Liverpool via Calcutta, is used in the Benares division than elsewhere. Though in British India Tibetan salt is untaxed and Indian salt taxed, little or none of the former ever reaches the plains. Difficulties of transport raise its price even in the hills to that of taxed salt; and to bring it further would not pay.\n\nThe principal exports to British dominions are rice, wheat and other grains, sugar and oilseeds. Amongst minor exports may be mentioned opium, indigo, and clarified butter. Lac is collected in small quantities from the pipal and other trees, but in quantity so small that its import is more likely than its export. Owing to accidents of season the grain trade is liable to greater fluctuations than that of the exported sugar or the imported cotton. But as a rule Basti produces far more grain than it requires, and exports largely. Its surplus stocks pass across the Ghagra to the entrep\u00f4ts of Jaunpur and Benares, or down the Ghagra and its tributaries to Calcutta. How large the grain traffic on the Ghagra is has been shown above. If uninfluenced by abnormal causes, the traffic in spring grains lasts from about the middle of April to about the middle of August; and of these vernal products wheat is of course the most important. The large wheat export from these provinces to England through Calcutta promised for a small time great prosperity to India. The famine prices of 1877-78 nipped it in the bud, and whether it will live to flourish remains to be seen. But at present rates it pays better to keep corn in the country than to export it. The margin of profit, after sale in England, was never great. As compared with those of rice and wheat, the other grain or pulse exports of Basti are small. They include jowar millet, peas and gram.\n\nIn the requirements of its growth sugar is the opposite of cotton. Flourishing in the damp soil and climate of Basti, where cotton pines, it is thence exported to the cotton districts. To Bengal, too, much finds its way. The exports consist chiefly of unrefined varieties like compost (gur), putri, rad and molasses (shtra); but refined sugar leaves the district in no contemptible abundance. The same causes which render the district a productive field for sugar adapt it also to the growth of linseed. For its linseed, and not for its fibre, flax is widely cultivated. The export of other oilseeds\u2014mustard (rad), rape (sarson), and mahua-berry (koendi), is comparatively small. Oilseeds are, as a\nrule, sent down the rivers to Calcutta. The minor exports need not detain us long. A Government monopoly, opium is exported only to the Government factory at Gh\u00e1z\u00edpur. A small quantity of safflower and other dyes is transmitted to other districts of these provinces or Calcutta. The clarified butter exported from Basti is probably produced in the Nep\u00e1l Tar\u00e1i and re-exported. The principal producers of this commodity are, not the districts of the Benares division, but the Agra districts bordering the Jamna. The quantity produced in Basti itself is by reason of defective pasturage small.\n\nWe now come to the second great class of trade, the internal commerce between places within Basti itself. This may be briefly defined as the exchange of agricultural raw produce for coarse and primitive manufactures. The rustic brings his crops to the nearest market village or small town, bringing back cloth, metal vessels, or other simple necessaries. But his requirements are neither extensive nor expensive. His demand for manufactures falls short of his supply of grain, and he should therefore return with a cash balance. What becomes of this balance is an intricate question on which the village usurer could probably throw some light.\n\nIn every parganah are several places where markets are held once weekly or oftener. More about these rural centres of commerce will be found in the town and parganah articles. Suffice it here to mention that the only mart with any real pretensions to a large business is Menhd\u00e1wal. But a considerable trade is carried on at B\u00e1ghnagar in Maghar, B\u00e1nsi, Basti, Belwa of Amorha, Bh\u00e1npur, Biskohar, Chilli\u00e1, Dubaulia, Domari\u00e1ganj, G\u00e1eghat, Ganeshpur of Nagar, Hara\u00eda, Hanum\u00e1nganj of Maghar, Lant\u00e1n, Mukhlispur of Mahauli, Nagar, and Uska. At many places holy festivals become the excuse for fairs which are really commercial rather than religious. Chief of such gatherings are those held in the end of October-November and the beginning of March-April at S\u00edt\u00e1r\u00e1mpur in Amorha. The first, called the K\u00e1mki k\u00e1 Nih\u00e1n, has for its ostensible object ceremonial bathing in the Gh\u00e1gra, and is attended by about 100,000 persons. The second, which takes place on the R\u00e1mnauami festival, is attended by about 10,000. To the Ashn\u00e1n Bharat-bh\u00e1ri fair, held in the end of October-November at Bh\u00e1ri of Ras\u00falpur, are assigned 50,000 visitors. At Jign\u00e1n of Bans\u00ed, in the following month (November-December), some 35,000 holiday-makers celebrated the betrothal and marriage of R\u00e1ma (Dh\u00e1nukjug and R\u00e1mbiy\u00e1h). Attendances of 12,000, 11,000, and 10,000 respectively are ascribed to the gatherings assembled in March-April at L\u00e1lganj of Mahauli (the Muh\u00e1ra); at Amorha (the R\u00e1mrekha); and at Sirsi of Amorha (the\nMakhaura). The Shiur\u00e2ttri fair held in February-March at Tama of Maghar has about 9,000; the Bhadesarn\u00e2th held in the same month at Bhadesar of Basti, about 6,000 visitors. The same figure represents the numbers who assemble to celebrate the \"full-moon bathing\" (Ashn\u00e2n P\u00fbranm\u00e2shi) at Kakrah\u00eeghat of B\u00e2nsi in October-November; while about a thousand less meet at the \"pond-bathing\" (Ashn\u00e2n Pokhra) held in the following month at Amaulipur of Amorha.\n\nThe minor gatherings are those held thrice yearly at Menhd\u00e2wal and twice yearly at B\u00e2nsi; the Shiur\u00e2ttri at Katesarn\u00e2th in Ras\u00fblpur (February-March); the bathing-assemblages at Pachos and Pandol in Amorha (December-January and March-April); the f\u00eate of Kab\u00eer at Maghar (December-January); and the Palt\u00e2devi at Alid\u00e2pur of B\u00e2nsi (March-April). Some further account of the principal fairs will be given in the articles on the towns, villages, and parganas where they take place. It will be seen that they are chiefly of Hindu origin; but many are held also in honour of the rather mythical Muslim martyr Sayyid S\u00e2l\u00eer, alias B\u00e2l\u00e2 P\u00eer,1 alias Gh\u00e2zi Miy\u00e2n. None is deemed of sufficient size or turbulence to require the attendance of an additional police force. There is much sameness about the articles, often articles of luxury, exposed for sale at all. The commonest wares are cotton and woollen cloth, metal utensils, cutlery, rice and other grains, salt, spices, sugarcane, sweetmeats, toys, shoes, ornamental caps and cheap female ornaments.\n\nA corollary to the subject of commerce is that of weights and measures.\n\nWeights and measures. These are in many respects peculiar. The Government ser of 80 tolas or 2\u00bd lb avoirdupois is not in general use. The unit of weight is the copper coin called the Gorakhpuri or B\u00fbtwal piece, of which that ser contains 22\u00bd. Four of these pieces=1 ganda. Seven or eight gandas=1 local ser \"crude\" (kacha); 40 gandas=1 panseri, which equips 150 rupees; and 25 gandas=1 local ser \"mature\" (paka). The weight known as the sei varies in practice from 22\u00bd to 31\u00bd gandas, according to the locality and the nature of the grain sold. But the sei par excellence, the sei by which the variations of other seis are measured, is a sei of white rice; and this equals one local ser mature. Sixteen of these true seis = 1 m\u00e2ni and 16 m\u00e2nis=1 gon. But paddy or unhusked rice weighs about twice as much as husked or white rice; and in measuring the former 8 seis only go to the m\u00e2ni. In this paddy weight 5 m\u00e2nis=1 man; and this man=48 Government sors. Neither man nor m\u00e2ni must be confused with the smaller\n\n1 The title of B\u00e2l\u00e2 P\u00eer or High Saint is bestowed also on other persons, such as Shaikh Kab\u00eer of Kanauj. The latter is not, however, to be confused with the greater Kab\u00eer whose shrine may be seen at Maghar.\nand rarer weight known as m\u00e1na. The m\u00e1na equals $6\\frac{1}{2}$ gandas only; or, in other words, $4$ m\u00e1nas = 1 local ser mature.\n\nSo greatly do the customary standards differ from mart to mart that the above remarks must be taken as general only. In the present backward commercial state of the district and the provinces, the want of uniformity matters perhaps but little. So long as the people prefer this confusion of weights, the interference of the legislature would be undesirable; and before such interference becomes urgent, the extension of trade and communications will probably have rendered local measures almost as extinct as they are in England. Meanwhile it is needless to ask the question whether the State should not assert the exclusive right of making weights as it does of coining money. It is always open to a purchaser to claim measurement by Government weight, just as it is always open to the seller to claim payment in legal tender instead of Nepalese pice. Government weights are kept at all tahsildars' offices; and to these offices weights professing to represent Government standards can always be brought for verification and stamping.\n\nThe crudo ser is prevalent chiefly in the southern parganas, where the sei is not used. But, as might be expected from its rice origin, the latter weight is universal in the rice-bearing north-country. The mature ser is in vogue all over the district. When collected into heaps on the threshing-floor, grain is sometimes measured by a standard of capacity called p\u00e1thi. The weight of a p\u00e1thi varies in different villages from about 1 to about $1\\frac{1}{2}$ Government maunds. Like the m\u00e1ni, the p\u00e1thi is familiar in the hill-country south of the Ganges plain. Ordinary scales are called tar\u00e1zu; goldsmiths' scales, k\u00e1nta; giant scales for weighing sacks, rd\u00fal; and balances for weighing wood, tak. Weights, made as elsewhere of iron or stone, are named b\u00e1nt and batkara.\n\nFor measures of length and area an unit is supplied by the h\u00e1th or cubit.\n\nMeasures of length and area. The values of this standard differ in different parganas; but were sanctioned by the old Oudh Government and have been adopted by our own. They are as follows:\u2014In B\u00e1nsi, Ras\u00falpur, and Bin\u00e1yakpur, 22\u00b77 inches; in Amorha, 20\u00b76; in Nagar and Basti, 20\u00b79; in Maghar, 21\u00b74; and in Mahauli, 21\u00b73. From the cubit upwards, the table is everywhere uniform. Five cubits = 1 latta and 20 lattas = 1 jar\u00edb. The square of the latta is called dhur or bisw\u00e1nsi; that of the jar\u00edb a bigha; and every-\n\n---\n\n1 The death-blow to purely local standards was in that country given by the Imperial Weights and Measures Act, which, passed in 1824, came into force on the 1st January, 1826. The m\u00e1ni in Bundelkhand and the Central Provinces; the p\u00e1thi or p\u00e1thi in Chatia N\u00e1gpur and South Mirzapur.\nwhere 20 dh\u00fars = 1 dh\u00e1i or biswa, while a bigha contains 20 dh\u00e1is. But as the cubit varies, the uniformity of all these other measures is of course an uniformity in name only. The relative values of the bigha and the acre differ from parganah to parganah thus:\n\n| Pargana                  | Measure of Government bigha in square yards | Number of bighas to the acre | Bigha what decimal fraction of the acre |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| B\u00e1nsi, Ras\u00falpur, and Biu\u00e1yakpur | ...                                         | 3,976                       | 1\u00b72178 +                               |\n| Nagar and Basti          | ...                                         | 3,403                       | 1\u00b74229 +                               |\n| Amorha                   | ...                                         | 1,179                       | 4\u00b71051 +                               |\n| Maghar                   | ...                                         | 3,538                       | 1\u00b73700                                 |\n| Mahauli                  | ...                                         | 3,600                       | 1\u00b73828 +                               |\n\nBut besides these official or mature (paka) standards, there are many others known as crude (kacha). The average value of the crude h\u00e1th is about 20 inches. Three h\u00e1ths = 1 rassi or latta of 5 feet. The square of 5 rass\u00eds is called a mandi; while 24 mandis make a bigha of about 1,666\u00b75 yards English. The native yard or gaz varies everywhere. In the south it is a few inches shorter, in the north about 4 inches longer than the English yard; while at B\u00e1nsi it attains the monstrous length of 3 feet 7\u00bd inches. But a table showing all these crude measures would probably fill volumes. Mr. Wynne mentions that almost every landholder in Ras\u00falpur has his own mandi; while at the fairs at Bh\u00e1ri and Katesarn\u00e1th every trader has his own gaz. The term mandi is in navvy\u2019s work sometimes applied to the Government biswa.\n\nIn the coinage of Basti there is nothing peculiar, for the wide currency of Nep\u00e1lese coppers can hardly be called a peculiarity. A letter in the Board\u2019s Records for 1802 shows that there were then current seven different kinds of rupees. Taking the Lucknow coin and the figure 100 as its standard, it places the value of the Benares rupee somewhat above that par; those of the Moti Sh\u00e1hi, Gauhar Sh\u00e1hi, and Muhammad Sh\u00e1hi between 96 and 97; and that of the Rik\u00e1bi above 91. The Moti Sh\u00e1hi is said to derive its name from the same Scotch officer (Mr. Ahmuty) as Mot\u00edganj of Allahabad. The seventh rupee mentioned is the Gop\u00e1l Sh\u00e1hi; and Buchanan notes in 1813 the occasional use of others from the Calcutta, Murshidabad, and Farukhabad mints. But it may be doubted whether the keenest numismatist could now collect many specimens of these coins in Basti. The only rupees in general circulation are those of the modern British Government. And in British Government rupees the district\n**DISTRICT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURE.**\n\nIncome and expenditure for two out of the past ten years may be shown thus:\n\n| Receipts | 1872-73. | 1879-80. |\n|----------|----------|----------|\n| Land revenue | Rs. 13,37,653 | Rs. 13,36,571 |\n| Stamps | Rs. 50,840 | Rs. 81,851 |\n| Medical receipts (law and justice) | Rs. 7,682 | Rs. 11,179 |\n| Police | Rs. 473 | Rs. 6,823 |\n| Public works | Rs. 16,023 | Rs. 26,658 |\n| Income and license taxes | Rs. 16,750 | Rs. 16,711 |\n| Local funds | Rs. 3,58,680 | Rs. 7,048 |\n| Post-office | Rs. 7,907 | Rs. 33,794 |\n| Medical | Rs. 9 | Rs. 9 |\n| Educational | Rs. 269 | Rs. 157 |\n| Excise | Rs. 23,592 | Rs. 39,006 |\n| Cash transfer remittances | Rs. 34,280 | Rs. 1,41,900 |\n| Transfer receipts | Rs. 22,517 | Rs. 6,419 |\n| Money orders | Rs. 26,479 | Rs. 44,477 |\n| Municipal funds | Rs. 4,140 | Rs. 1,975 |\n| Recoveries | Rs. 404 | Rs. 1,057 |\n| Rates and taxes | Included in Local Funds | Rs. 2,50,086 |\n| Ledger and savings-bank deposits | | |\n| Miscellaneous | Rs. 10,492 | |\n| Jail | Rs. 4,580 | Rs. 6,857 |\n| Registration | Rs. 4,321 | |\n| Deposits | Rs. 8,041 | Rs. 9,914 |\n| Total | Rs. 18,61,455 | Rs. 21,71,928 |\n\n| Expenditure | 1872-73. | 1879-80. |\n|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Revenue charges | Rs. 68,164 | Rs. 1,76,810 |\n| Excise (including opium) | Rs. 1,842 | Rs. 1,373 |\n| Assessed taxes | Rs. 144 | Rs. 47 |\n| Stamps | Rs. 1,935 | Rs. 1,050 |\n| Judicial charges | Rs. 35,778 | Rs. 26,589 |\n| Police, district and rural | Rs. 1,16,654 | Rs. 1,33,195 |\n| Public works | Rs. 74,304 | Rs. 28,960 |\n| Provincial and local funds | Rs. 4,32,646 | Rs. 10,525 |\n| Post-office | Rs. 7,679 | Rs. 15,417 |\n| Medical | Rs. 4,150 | Rs. 12,667 |\n| Educational | Rs. 3,100 | Rs. 16,695 |\n| Cash and transfer remittances | Rs. 7,46,716 | Rs. 8,25,000 |\n| Transfer receipts and money orders | Rs. 2,869 | Rs. 9,133 |\n| Municipal funds | Rs. 6,606 | Rs. 1,595 |\n| Advances recoverable | Rs. 225 | Rs. 659 |\n| Pensions | Rs. 1,213 | Rs. 1,641 |\n| Ledger and savings-bank deposits | | Rs. 2,033 |\n| Miscellaneous | Rs. 1,110 | Rs. 2,342 |\n| Jail | Rs. 16,432 | Rs. 17,507 |\n| Registration | Rs. 3,579 | Rs. 2,772 |\n| Deposits | Rs. 65,358 | Rs. 1,26,017 |\n| Malikana | Rs. 18,476 | Rs. 11,417 |\n| Military | Rs. 1,700 | Rs. 558 |\n| Interest and refund, Famine Relief works (famine charges) | | Rs. 5,223 |\n| Total | Rs. 12,79,196 | Rs. 14,34,977 |\n\nSeveral items of this account will be none the worse for explanation.\n\nThere is no municipality in Basti. But the so-called municipal funds are collected and disbursed chiefly on police, public works and conservancy, in the towns of Menhdawal and Biskohar. Here, under Act XX. of 1856, a house-tax is levied on well-to-do residents. Though superintended by the Magistrate-Collector, its assessment is in the first instance effected by a committee (panchdyat) representing the townspeople. Until a few years ago there were as many as a dozen house-tax towns in Basti. The income and outlay of the two that remain will be detailed in their Gazetteer articles.\n\nThe income-tax was abolished in 1872; and the above account, which begins with April\\(^2\\) of that year, shows not the receipts for a perfect twelve-month. As an example, then, of what could be realized under this head, let us take 1870-71. In that year,\n\n---\n\n1 Allowances made to owners of sequestrated estates.\n2 In India, as in England, the financial year begins on the 1st April.\nunder the Act of 1870, the tax was assessed at the rate of six pies in the rupee on all profits exceeding Rs. 500 yearly. The actual assessment amounted, for the whole district, to Rs. 59,496. There were 844 incomes of between Rs. 500 and 750 per annum; 267 of between Rs. 750 and 1,000; 184 of between Rs. 1,000 and 1,500; 65 of between Rs. 1,500 and 2,000; 108 of between Rs. 2,000 and 10,000; and 9 of between 10,000 and 100,000. The total number of persons assessed was therefore 1,477. The license-tax, imposed by Act VIII. of 1877, yielded in 1878-79 and 1879-80 returns of Rs. 17,198 and Rs. 16,711 respectively.\n\nExcise is levied under Act X. of 1871. At the close of the year 1879-80 the district contained 147 shops for the sale of native liquor, but none for the sale of English spirituous drinks.

In 1876-77 fees to the amount of Rs. 7,872 were realized on the 3,350 documents registered under the Registration Act (VIII. of 1871). The expenses of establishment and other charges reached during the same year the sum of Rs. 2,772. The total value of all property affected by registered documents was returned as Rs. 13,20,981, of which Rs. 11,86,800 represented immoveable and the remainder moveable property.\n\nUnder the head of judicial expenditure we may note the results usually attained for the money, or in other words the number of cases usually tried in the year. Tried by Criminal Courts in 1878-79 were 2,900; by Civil Courts, 1,664; and by Revenue Courts, 804.\n\nThe medical charges are in great part those incurred at the one central and the three branch dispensaries. The first is at Basti; the three latter being situated at Birdpur, Bansi, and Menhdawal respectively. At these institutions cases are treated and medicines dispensed by native doctors, under the general supervision of the Civil Surgeon. The diseases which most often call for treatment, all more or less endemic, are as follow:\u2014intermittent and simple fevers, small-pox, rheumatism, indigestion, dysentery, diarrhoea, cholera, bronchitis, inflammation of the lungs, pleuritis, consumption, anaemia, dropsy, leprosy and other skin diseases (shingles, scabies, impetigo, &c.), mumps, liver and spleen complaints, paralysis, stone in the bladder, and goitre.\n\n\"Basti,\" writes Dr. Kelly, \"is peculiarly damp and relaxing. That part towards the north, known as the Tarai, has a malarious climate; and the natives suffer largely from intermittent fever,\\(^1\\) which may be considered the most prevalent disease. The inhabitants generally are poor, badly fed and clothed, and being exposed under such conditions to noxious climatic influences, readily succumb to disease. Enlargements of the spleen are very common as the result of repeated attacks of ague. Very little has been done towards improving the drainage of swamps in the district. But the cutting of\n\n\\(^1\\) Speaking of those fevers, Dr. Buchanan writes: \"Some of a slight nature are called 'cold and hot' (cordt-garmt), and require little attention. The people allege that they are also liable to slight febrile attacks if they omit for some days to eat before 10 o'clock in the forenoon, especially near the equinoxes. This kind of complaint is called kharai, and is accompanied by head-ache and bleeding at the nose.\"\nforests and increased cultivation have done much towards ameliorating the prevalence of disease.\n\n\"There has been a yearly epidemic of cholera for some time past. Cholera invariably appears at the commencement of the hot season and disappears soon after the setting-in of the rains. Its character is that of Asiatic cholera. Malaria, insufficient food and clothing, are amongst the chief causes to which its presence may be attributed. It attacks the poorer classes in large numbers. It is impossible to give any idea of the rate of mortality. The deaths reported as from cholera are not to be depended upon. Little attention is, in my opinion, paid to the cause of death by gorais (village-watchmen, whose duty it is to report deaths). My native doctors have frequently visited villages where cholera was reported, and on arrival were shown cases of fevers, simple diarrhoea, and dysentery.\n\n\"Small-pox also is annually epidemic, and is likely to remain so until natives entertain less aversion to vaccination. The mortality under this disease is, I believe, small, but I can give no data. It is not reported like cholera; nor will the inhabitants, as a rule, accept of any treatment for it. It is most prevalent in March, April, and May, but it is also present in the winter months.\"\n\nVaccination is, however, increasing. In Buchanan's time it was unknown. But in 1874-75 as many as 4,815 out of 5,778 operations performed by the Government vaccinators were successful; in 1875-76 as many as 28,787 out of 29,264; 9,455 out of 10,564 in 1876-77; 10,170 out of 10,985 in 1877-78; and in 1878-79, 11,014 out of 11,672. Inoculation is less common than elsewhere owing, according to Buchanan, to the extreme views which the Muslim inhabitants entertain on the subject of predestination.\n\nAfter Dr. Kelly's remarks the following figures, showing for five years the principal causes of mortality, must be taken cum grano:\n\n| Year | Fever | Small-pox | Bowel complaint | Cholera | Other causes | Total | Proportion of deaths to 1,000 of population |\n|------|-------|-----------|----------------|--------|--------------|-------|------------------------------------------|\n| 1874 | 13,737 | 2,132     | 579            | 964    | 2,063        | 19,475| 13'22                                   |\n| 1875 | 13,978 | 418       | 672            | 4,038  | 1,932        | 20,022| 13'59                                   |\n| 1876 | 90,29  | 1,004     | 706            | 2,338  | 2,794        | 27,264| 18'78                                   |\n| 1877 | 25,45  | 59        | 696            | 5,236  | 5,827        | 37,003| 25'12                                   |\n| 1878 | 51,865 | 311       | 1,151          | 568    | 8,520        | 62,415| 42'37                                   |\n| Average | 24,828 | 780       | 760            | 2,618  | 4,327        | 33,235| 22'56                                   |\nThe treatment adopted by private native practitioners (kabir\u00faj) is allopathic.\n\nNative medicines. But, though thus far in accord with the bulk of European opinion, these gentlemen hold somewhat singular beliefs as to the origin of disease. All maladies are assigned to one or more of four predisposing causes, viz., excess of air (b\u00e1th), bile or heat (pit), mucus (kaph) and cold (\u00e1t). All save perhaps a dozen of the native drugs mentioned in the Et\u00e1wa, Cawnpore, and Gorakhpur notices are procurable also in this district. But Dr. Kelly adds the following.

But we must content ourselves with the merest sketch. The materials, never very ample, have been almost exhausted in describing that Gorakhpur of which, till 1865, Basti formed a part.\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, \"Imports from Nep\u00e1l.\"\nThe two districts probably supplied its north-eastern corner to the ancient Puranic kingdom of great Kosh\u00e1la. This extended along the foot of the Him\u00e1laya from the S\u00e1rda to the Gandak, and from the foot of the Him\u00e1laya southwards to the Ganges. Its capital was Ajudhya, the court of the heroic R\u00e1ma. The mass of legends which surrounds his name must not obscure his claims to be considered a real and historic personage. According to the calculations of Buchanan, he must have flourished about 775 years before Christ. Had he been a Western potentate he would have been deified; and from a mortal emperor would have become an immortal god. But being an eastern ruler, he has been declared an incarnation of an already existing deity. As the earthly embodiment of the saviour Vishnu, he is still, as already shown, the favourite god of Basti.\n\nIt is unlikely, however, that Basti was at this time much more than a forest interspersed with swamps and pasture-glades. There is a legend that, during a season of drought at Ajudhya, R\u00e1ma drove his cattle across the Gh\u00e1gra to graze. But that there were some clearings occupied by villages is probable. Buddha, who lived about the middle of the sixth century B.C., was probably born in the district. The birthplace of the great faith-founder is however a name and nothing else. Kapila-vastu or Kapila-nagara has never been conclusively identified with any existing village. The forms vastu and basti are of course cognate and synonymous; but it must not be supposed that the comparatively modern Basti is the same as the ancient Kapila-vastu. Nagara, again, is merely the later nagar writ large; and General Cunningham seems to identify Kapila-nagara with the existing parganah capital of Nagar. Mr. Beal locates the city on the R\u00e9pti, about 60 miles above Gorakhpur; and thereby places it well within this district. Our knowledge about the position of Kapila may however be reduced to this:\u2014that it lay on the route from the Buddhist cities of eastern Gorakhpur to the Buddhist Sr\u00e1vasti of Gonda; and that that route probably passed between the Gh\u00e1gra and R\u00e9pti rivers.\n\nBut long before the time of Buddha the kingdom of Great Kosh\u00e1la had become divided. On R\u00e1ma\u2019s death and the partition of R\u00e1ma\u2019s empire, the paternal domains north of the\n\n---\n\n1 Sakti Sanggam Tantra, quoted in Eastern India, (II. 325).\n2 But the claim of Kapila to this honour is not altogether undisputed. The Sinhalese accounts say that Buddha was born at Benares; and Fa Hian mentions a place called Tadwa (To-wai), about 81 miles east of Kapila, as a pretender to the same distinction.\n3 It may interest the reader to remind him that vastu is merely the astu of his Greek-grammar days with a digamma superadded.\n4 See his map showing the travels of Chinese pilgrims (plate I of volume I, Archaeological Survey Reports.)\n5 Travels of Fa-Hian and Sung-yun, translated from the Chinese by the Rev. Samuel Beal, B.A., chaplain in H. M.\u2019s Fleet, London (T\u00fcbner\u2019s), 1869.\nGh\u00e1gra had fallen to the share of his son Lava. Being bounded on the south by Saketa or Ajudhya, and on the east by Vaish\u00e1li or Bih\u00e1r, the new kingdom must have included Basti. Its capital was sometimes Sr\u00e1vasti and sometimes Kapila. The king who ruled the tract in Buddha's day was Prasen\u00e1j\u00edt. The Vishnu Pur\u00e1na, which fables him the fiftieth in descent from Lava, adds also that he was the great-grandson of Buddha himself. At any rate he was the contemporary of Buddha and one of the earliest converts to Buddhism.\n\nFor about seven centuries after Prasen\u00e1j\u00edt's death the kingdom flourished under his successors. Whether those successors were all Buddhists it is impossible to say; but it is certain that Vikram\u00e1ditya, who conquered this part of India about 150 A.D., was a bigoted Hindu. The sacred Hindu buildings at Ajudhya being overthrown and overgrown by forest, he restored them. This Vikram\u00e1ditya, who was the most powerful monarch of Northern India, must not be confused with that earlier namesake who in 57 B.C. founded an era. To Buchanan must be ascribed the credit of first suggesting the distinction. While mentioning that the legends collected by Wilford required the existence of eight Vikram\u00e1dityas, Elphinstone seems to recognize the existence of one only.\n\nThe Ajudhya traditions relate that after a glorious reign of eighty years Vikram\u00e1ditya was in an evil hour visited by the ascetic Samudra Guptas. Samudra P\u00e1l. This Samudra beguiled him to allow his royal spirit to be transported by magic into a corpse. The king's body was no sooner vacant than Samudra re-occupied it with his own spirit, and refused to quit it. By this impious trick the man of piety acquired the throne of Sr\u00e1vasti, which his descendants retained for seventeen generations. The fact imbedded in this legend is that the Buddhist Samudra Gupta, who reigned for the first forty years of the third century A.D., overthrew the local dynasty and ruled in their stead. His success was perhaps merely the termination of civil wars excited by the drastic religious policy of Vikram\u00e1ditya. The eighty years assigned to the latter's reign will hardly surprise those who know that in ancient history a single name often stands for a whole dynasty. It is remarkable that from Samudra Gupta to Gay\u00e1ditya, the last Aditya monarch of Kanauj, there are exactly seventeen names on the list of the great Bais emperors who governed Northern India.\n\n1 See Oudh Gazetteer, I., 539, and III., 281-82. 2 Ibid.; Eastern India, II., 334-36, and Elphinstone's History, Bk. IV., chapter 1. 3 The correct transliteration of Hwen Thsang's Fei-she is Vaisya. But as pointed out by General Cunningham, Vaisa or Bais Kshatriya was probably intended.\nThe Guptas were themselves of lowly origin; and, as already shown, their predominance coincided with the uprising of those aboriginal tribes who all along the Sub-Himalayan tract, in Rohilkhand and Oudh, in Gorakhpur and Bih\u0101r, sooner or later supplanted the war-enfeebled Aryans. The accession of the new dynasty was in fact not only a triumph of Buddhist over Hindu, but of race over race. In the democratic bosom of Buddhism, which renounces caste, the despised autochthones had found a solace for the contumelies of the proud invaders who had lorded it over them so long. Of the many centuries of aboriginal rule which followed next to nothing is known. But there are aborigines and aborigines; and the legends collected by Buchanan seem to prove that the Bhar or the Cheru had at times to dispute the realm with the Th\u0101ru or the hillman. If we use the \"or\" instead of the \"and,\" it is because Bhar and Cheru, Th\u0101ru and hillman, are by some deemed convertible terms. The Th\u0101rus are said to have ruled with exceptional splendour, and to have left their brick strongholds scattered all over the north-Gh\u0101gra country. But their advent was elsewhere and perhaps here followed by the encroachments of forest and the decay of ancient towns. In the beginning of the fifth century the district was traversed by the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Fa Hian, who passed across it from Gonda to Gorakhpur. Sr\u0101vasti was then inhabited by but 200 poor families. In Kapila, the capital of Kosh\u0101la (kiu-sa-lo), \"there is no government or people; it is just like a great desert. There are simply a congregation of priests and about 10 families of lay people.\" The country of Kapilavastu (Ka-weilo-wei) is now a vast wilderness. You seldom meet any people on the roads, for they are much in dread of the white elephants and lions (wild elephants and tigers?) which frequent the neighbourhood and render it impossible to travel fearlessly.\" The palace of Suddhodana, where Buddha was born, was in ruins. But about a dozen towers (stupas or relic-temples), which marked the localities of great events in Buddha's life, were \"still existing.\" Fa Hian mentions also the spring called the Arrow Fountain; the place where king Virudhaka slew the offspring of the S\u0101kyas; and the spot where Buddha hurled a dead elephant outside the city walls.\n\n1 North-Western Provinces Gazr., V., 647; Oudh Gazr., I., 111; and Supra, pp. 429-32.\n2 Eastern India, II., 341; Oudh Gazr., I., 539. Buchanan mentions a race called Sivira as \"succeeding\" the Cher\u016bs. He perhaps means the Seoris or Soeris, a tribe sometimes deemed akin to the Cher\u016bs; but the identity of his Siviras was considered too uncertain to justify their mention in the text.\n3 Said by Mr. Beal to be a mistake for Kapilo-wei, i.e., city of Kapila.\n4 Beal, pp. 85-89.\nBut all these localities and buildings are described with much greater fulness by Hwen Thsang, who visited Kapila about 635 A.D. \"The kingdom of Kie-pi-lo-sa-sou-tou (Kapilavastu),\" writes the latter, \"has a circuit of about 4,000 li (660 miles). It has ten deserted towns, which present a dreary aspect. The royal city is in ruins, and one no longer knows what was the extent of its circumference. The palace which stood within the capital was from 14 to 15 li (about two miles) in circuit. It was entirely built of brick. Its remains are still high and solid, but it has been deserted for ages. The villages are fairly peopled. There is no king, but each town has its own chief. The land is fat and fertile; the sowings and the reappings take place at regular periods; the seasons never derange themselves; the manners of the inhabitants are sweet and affable. There were once nearly a thousand Buddhist convents whose ruins still exist.\" The relic-temples were even more numerous. \"To the north-west of the town one counts stupas by hundreds and thousands. It was in this place that the race of S\u00e1kyas was massacred. After king Virudhaka had conquered the S\u00e1kyas, he led them and their families prisoners to the number of 99,900,000 souls, and had them all slaughtered. Their corpses accumulated like heaps of straw; and their blood, which had flowed in waves, formed a large lake. Secretly prompted by the gods, men gathered up their bones and gave them sepulture.\" Virudhaka was the son of the Prasen\u00e1jit aforesaid, and effected this butchery because the S\u00e1kyas had taunted him with the fact that his mother was a slave-girl.\n\nBut Hwen Thsang does not content himself with mere general statements as to the number of the buildings he visited. The position of the various convents and shrines he describes with much careful detail. All seem to have been monumental, marking spots associated with the adventures of Buddha or other saints. Thus at the place where Buddha was born stood a monastery (vih\u0101ra); and at the place where he displayed his strength by \"putting\" the elephant, rose a temple. The ditch which the fall of the huge beast dinted in the ground might still be seen beside the southern gate of the city, and was called the elephant's fosse (Hasti-garta). Outside the eastern gate was the Hindu temple of Ishvaradeva, a stone idol of imposing size. When Buddha was still a babe, his nurse bore him into the temple. On his entrance the idol rose, and continued standing before him until his departure. Near the city were a stupa and a column, both reared about 250 B.C. by the emperor Asoka. The column was surmounted by the figure of a horse.\n\nSeveral incidental details serve to give the Chinaman's account a little local colour. The neighbourhood seems to have been fairly wooded. Just outside\nthe town on the south was a wood of fig-trees (g\u016bl\u0101r?); while at some distance in another direction might be seen some ancient asogs. Nearly five miles to the south-east, and flanked by a temple, lay the Arrow Fount, so called because it sprang from a hole pierced in the ground by Buddha's arrow. Southeastwards past Kapila itself flowed a little burn. This was perhaps the Manar\u0101ma, but was then called the River of Oil. Of oil indeed its stream had once consisted. But when Maya, the mother of Buddha, wished to bathe in it after her confinement, the oil was turned into water, which it had ever since, though \"sweet and unctuous,\" remained.\n\nThough noticing the religious buildings of the past, Hwen Thsang is altogether silent as to the religious beliefs which he found existing at the time of his visit. Whether, therefore, in the first half of the seventh century Basti was chiefly Hindu or Buddhist must ever remain uncertain. Buddhism had in places perhaps faded before the sister faith of Jainism. We know that about 1000 A.D. the neighbouring Gonda was ruled by a Jain dynasty whose race is diversely described as Th\u0101ru or R\u0101jput. It was perhaps a mixture of both; for Aryan invaders did not in that age altogether despise intermarriage with the aborigines. The contemporary kings of Gorakhpur are in just the same manner called sometimes Th\u0101rus, sometimes R\u0101thors. But before the end of the twelfth century the dynasties of both Gorakhpur and Gonda were crushed by the Domkat\u0101rs or Domwars. These are variously styled either R\u0101jputs or military Br\u0101hmans. But there is no doubt that they had wedded the daughters of both Doms and Bhars, deriving from the former tribe the first part of their own name. The realm of the new rulers extended from the west of Gorakhpur to the east of Gonda, and included of course the bulk of Basti.\n\nBut the supremacy of the Domkat\u0101rs did not long remain unchallenged. Their struggle with the Bhars. Buchanan asserts that they were from the very first forced to dispute possession with the Bhars, who at length gained the upper hand. That these Bhars now or afterwards obtained great power is undoubted. They were for many centuries later the dominant race in the southern parganahs Amorha and Mahauli; while by some accounts they about this time obtained possession of Katahla, a tract extending from the hills to the Par\u0101si brook near B\u0101nsi. But the rulers of Katahla were according to other traditions Solankhi R\u0101jputs.\n\n---\n\n1 M\u00e9moires sur les Contr\u00e9es Occidentales, par Hiouen Thsang ; traduits du Chinois en Fran\u00e7ais par Stanislas Julien (Paris, 1867), Vol. I., pp. 309-25. This volume owed its publication the munificence of the Third Empire. 2 Oudh Gazr., I., 539, and II., 283-84. See also above, 432-33. The Oudh Gazetteer is probably wrong in calling the Domkat\u0101rs Doms tout court.\nFor towards the close of the thirteenth century, when the Muslim empire had become firmly and more firmly established at Dehli, its encroachments began driving the R\u00e1jputs to seek fresh homes down-country. The first R\u00e1jput invasion which in this district assumed any great importance was that of the Sarnets. Above has been told how their chief, Chandra Sen, expelled the Domkat\u00e1rs from Gorakhpur and eastern Basti, about 1275. Above has been noted how, on Chandra Sen's death, his son Jai Singh succeeded to the principality of Maghar in this district. That principality probably included all B\u00e1nsi south of the R\u00e1pti. But B\u00e1nsi north of that river was held chiefly, as just mentioned, by the r\u00e1ja of Katahh.\n\nAbout the same time, moreover, as Jai succeeded to his heritage, another race of R\u00e1jputs seized some part of the north-R\u00e1pti country. These were the Chauh\u00e1ns, founders of the B\u00fatwal and P\u00e1lpa principality. But if it be true that their chief Makhund fled from Chittaur after its sack in 1303, they should rather be called Sisodiyas or Gahlots; and if their real tribe is somewhat uncertain, it is because they never cared to maintain an untainted R\u00e1jput lineage. They intermarried freely with those Th\u00e1r\u00fas whose lands in the north-eastern corner of the district they annexed. But their annexations lay chiefly in what are now Nep\u00e1l and Gorakhpur. In Basti their domains were limited to Bin\u00e1yakpur and B\u00e1nsi, west of the Jamw\u00e1r and K\u00fara rivers. Their misalliances estranged them from the other chiefs of the district; and in its history they find little place.\n\nThere is a legend that the Bhars were expelled from parganah Basti by Gardhi Singh, a R\u00e1jput of unknown tribe; and that Gardhi's descendants were in 1330 ejected by a Kulh\u00e1ns named Udhar\u00e9j. It is possible that Gardhi Singh was a Domkat\u00e1r, for at the beginning of the fourteenth century the western parganahs, Basti and Ras\u00falpur, were still held by the Dom or Domkat\u00e1r r\u00e1ja of Gonda. This r\u00e1ja was overthrown, and his domain in both Basti and Gonda annexed, by Sej or Sahaj the Kulh\u00e1ns. The date 1330 may be allowed to stand, as other accounts concur in bringing Scj hither in the time of the Tughlak emperors (1321-1412). With his conquest disappeared the last vestige of Domkat\u00e1r domination.\n\nThe date of the Gautam invasion is not even approximately known. But as, before the final extinction of the title in 1858, there had been twenty-three Gautam r\u00e1jas of Nagar, it may be presumed that these R\u00e1jputs made their appearance at least as early\nas either of the two tribes last mentioned. Their chief, Jagdeo or Jagatot, obtained his principality by wresting parganah Nagar from the hands of the Domkat\u00e1rs or Bhars. Different traditions give the names of both the latter races; and to both traditions geographical considerations lend some support. If the Domkat\u00e1rs held Basti on the north, the Bhars held Mahauli on the east and Amorha on the west.\n\nIf asked to describe the territorial allotment of the district at the beginning of the next or fifteenth century, we should therefore reply thus:\u2014The north, including the bulk of parganah B\u00e1nsi, was ruled by the r\u00e1ja of Katabla; but a small north-eastern corner, including parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur, belonged to the r\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal. The eastern centre, comprising parganah Maghar and B\u00e1nsi, south of the R\u00e1pti, owed allegiance to the r\u00e1ja of Maghar; the western centre, comprising parganahs Ras\u00falpur and Basti, to the r\u00e1ja of Gonda. The southern parganahs, Amorha and Mahauli, were held by Bhars; while the remaining southern parganah, Nagar, a barrier between the two Bhar principalities, was subject to the r\u00e1ja of Nagar.\n\nThese petty princes seem to have recognized, when it suited their convenience, the suzerainty of the Dehli emperors. In the south they may perhaps have extended this half-condescending submission so far as to acknowledge the superiority of the Jaunpur kings (1394-1476). But in practice if not in theory they were autocratic. Like the servants of Alexander in the Maccabees, they \"all put crowns upon themselves.\" To say that they resembled English barons in the reign of Stephen or John is to give a scant idea of their importance; for though just as independent of the sovereign, of one another they were far more independent. Except perhaps in Nagar, they were sole masters of the soil and of their subjects' lives. Each principality was a little country in itself, agriculturally and commercially self-supporting. Save when a disputed frontier provoked war, each was heedless of its neighbours. But for further details of Basti's condition in the middle ages we may search in vain. Like all old world Hind\u00fas, the inhabitants cared not to preserve their own history; and the district had not as yet tempted the sword or the pen of the Musalm\u00e1n. We must therefore hasten on to the time of the first authentic Muslim invasion.\n\nIn 1564 the rebel Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n fled across the Gh\u00e1gra into Sarw\u00e1r, and through the forests which then adjoined the north bank of the river was fruitlessly pursued by the\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, p. 437.\ntroops of the emperor Akbar. But Sarw\u00e1r or Sarjup\u00e1r included parts of other districts besides Basti, and whether the imperial force entered Basti is uncertain. When Kh\u00e1n Zam\u00e1n was three years later (1567) slain elsewhere, his example of seeking refuge in this part of the country was followed by a fellow rebel named Sikandar Kh\u00e1n. Sikandar was bootlessly chased through Basti and Gorakhpur by a large army under Fid\u00e1\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n. But the general lingered in the two districts some time, reducing the local chiefs to submission. Amongst others the r\u00e1ja of Maghar was rendered tributary; and at Maghar itself was left an imperial garrison. The humiliation and perhaps the active annoyance to which he was exposed caused the r\u00e1ja to quit the ancient seat of his family and to found a new capital at B\u00e1nsi in the extreme north of his domains. His descendants have ever since been known as the r\u00e1jas of B\u00e1nsi. The title of Maghar was indeed no longer applicable; for parganah Maghar was now completely in the hands of the Musalm\u00e1ns.\n\nBut though constantly marching across the south of the district, from Gorakhpur to Maghar and from Maghar to Faizabad, the Musalm\u00e1ns seem to have interfered but little with the local chiefs. So long as the latter paid their tribute, they might fight with and expel one another as much as they would or could. Thus some S\u00farajbansi Rajputs from the south were allowed to eject the Bhars and the few Th\u00e1r\u00fas who still lingered in parganah Mahauli. The brothers Alakdeo and Tilakdeo slew the Bhar or Rajthar r\u00e1ja and annexed his domains up to within a few miles of Maghar itself. To much the same period, that is to about 1580 A.D., is ascribed the expulsion of the Bhars from Amorha. It has been above shown that the real date of this event was probably earlier; but in cases of uncertainty the commonly accepted chronology is safest.\n\nAmorha, circ. 1580 A.D. The K\u00e1yath Jagat Singh, who slew the Bhar r\u00e1ja and seized his lands, is by some accounts represented as a favourite of the emperor Akbar's Kachhw\u00e1h\u00edn wife. But he seems to have been aided also by some S\u00farajbansi, who afterwards deprived his descendants of half their heritage. His own unwarlike tribe could have given him but little assistance.\n\nBy the Institutes of Akbar (1596) the whole of Basti is included in the Oudh or Avadh province (s\u00edba), Amorha being a part of the Avadh, and all the remaining parganahs of the Gorakhpur division (sark\u00e1r.) But the\n\n---\n\n1 Tabak\u00e1t-i-Akbari in Dowson's edition of Elliot's Historians, V, 307\n2 Ibid, 324\n3 Supra, 439-40. To Fid\u00e1\u00e9 Khan is attributed the foundation of Kabir's mausoleum at Maghar. After him, perhaps, is named tappa Fid\u00e1ipur of Mahauli. There was only one grandee of Akbar's reign thus called, and Fid\u00e1\u00e9 was merely his poetical nom de plume. His real name was Mirza Rustam; and as he was a general, and Governor of Bihar, he is probably the person intended. See Blochmann's Ain-i-Akbari, I, 314.\n4 Pp. 442.\ncomparatively small state rental debited to the tract is a sign of either imperfect Muslim authority or scanty population. A small contingent of yeomanry and militia is as usual entered opposite the name of each division; but, as usual, the force is likely to have been a merely paper force. Ras\u00falpur is shown as a separate parganah (mah\u00e1l), probably because it was held as a separate fief by some cadet of the Gonda family. Basti, which about this time was granted away in the same manner, appears under the name of Mandwa. The only modern parganah not then formed was B\u00e1nsi, whose elements were shared between the Ratanpur, Maghar, and Katahla sub-divisions.\n\nBut Katahla was not destined long to remain an independent sub-division.\n\nExtension of the B\u00e1nsi About 1600 it was annexed, and its r\u00e1ja slain, by principality. Ratan, r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi. Against the other northern power, that of B\u00fatwal, the B\u00e1nsi chiefs were less successful. Long wars, in which they were often worsted, laid waste the debateable lands between the two principalities. Tappas Banjara, Sob\u00e1s, and Ghos are mentioned as suffering great devastation. But the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1jas must have gained the upper hand when, at some date unknown, the B\u00fatwal r\u00e1ja was driven back into parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur, and parganah B\u00e1nsi assumed its present dimensions. About 1610, its rulers found an opportunity of regaining for a time their lost heritage of Maghar. Affairs in R\u00e9jputana and the Dakkhan had diverted the attention and the force of Dehli from this less important part of its empire. A simultaneous and successful attack was made by the r\u00e1ja of Sat\u00e1si on the Gorakhpur, and by the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi on the Maghar garrison. For about half a century afterwards the local chiefs of Sarjup\u00e1r were left completely to their own devices.\n\nBut on the accession of the emperor Aurangz\u00e9b (1658), the Musalm\u00e1n power again made itself felt. K\u00e1zi Khal\u00edl-ur-Rahm\u00e1n, who was about 1680 appointed commissioner (chaklad\u00e1r) of the Gorakhpur division, marched from Faizabad with a strong force and reduced the district to order. The r\u00e1jas of Amorha and Nagar promptly submitted. Maghar was re-occupied by a large garrison, and the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi driven back to the place from which he took his title. Khal\u00edlabad was founded, and named after the commissioner; while through it, from Faizabad to Gorakhpur, was constructed a new military road. The district was not long afterwards visited by the emperor Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h, then prince Muazzim. In his honour, the Gorakhpur division was renamed Muazzinabad; and by the latter title, with which is sometimes associated that of Maghar, the Gorakhpur\n\n1 The tomb of this officer may be seen at Maghar. See article on that town.\nand Basti districts are mentioned in all official records between this period and the cession (1801).\n\nMeanwhile the Kulh\u00e1ns house of Gonda had fallen into difficulties. The B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1ja annexes Ras\u00falpur, circ. 1704.\n\nThe B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1ja annexes Ras\u00falpur, which though similarly granted had been resumed, was the only possession left to the chief of the clan. In his reduced condition he fell an easy prey to the ambition of the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1ja, who about 1700 slew him and seized Ras\u00falpur. In 1721, then, when Sa\u00e1dat Kh\u00e1n became Viceroy of Oudh and assumed independence of the Dehli emperor, the parganahs, in this part of his dominions were distributed as follows:\u2014Maghar was ruled by his own deputy and garrison; Bin\u00e1yakpur by the Chauh\u00e1n r\u00e1ja of B\u00fatwal; B\u00e1nsi and Ras\u00falpur by the Sarnet r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi; Basti by the Kulh\u00e1ns r\u00e1ja of Basti; Amorha by the K\u00e1yath r\u00e1ja of Amorha, ill able to hold his own against S\u00farajbansi rebels; Nagar by the Gautam r\u00e1ja of Nagar; and Mahauli by the S\u00farajbansi r\u00e1ja of Mahauli.\n\nUnder the new r\u00e9gime the tribute due from the r\u00e1jas was at first collected with some regularity. But its collection was always an easier matter in the south than in the north, where, fenced by forests and moated by rivers, the local chiefs could fall into arrears with no little hope of impunity. An expedition under Ali K\u00e1sim Kh\u00e1n was about 1750 despatched across Basti and through Gorakhpur into the B\u00fatwal principality. It no doubt taught the northern r\u00e1jas that the arm of Oudh was long enough to reach them, but its effect was somewhat fleeting. The Muhammadan influence became again as slight as it usually has been in this district. The r\u00e1jas resumed their former position\u2014that of irregular tributaries, but not of subjects. The collection of their tribute was the only branch of administration to which the Oudh Government devoted its attention. The protection of life and property was left to their desultory care, and they became as despotic as before. Their private wars were not only connived at but encouraged. Thus about 1765, the Oudh Naw\u00e1b, Shuj\u00e1-ud-Daula, lent Dalj\u00edt Sarnet a force wherewith to attack his elder brother, the r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi. At the internecine battle of Panghat\u00e1gh\u00e1t near B\u00e1nsi both brothers were slain. And in 1777, the son of Dalj\u00edt was allowed, with the assistance of B\u00fatwal, to defeat and slay a rival but rightful claimant to the principality.\nNot long after the battle of Baksar (1784), an English officer of the Lucknow government was placed in civil and military charge of this and other districts. Southern Basti soon felt Major Hannay's vigour, and the hands of the Oudh officials were everywhere strengthened. A regular land-tax was imposed and collected with much oppression. The right of collection was leased out to contractors, who rack-rented and pillaged the people. That the former was often their own raja did not much mend matters. But if the men of the south suffered from the extortions of Oudh, those of the north groaned equally under the forays of the Banj\u00e1ras. Above has been shown how, during the last seven decades of the last century, these pedlar-bandits harassed Gorakhpur. From the north of this district they were finally driven about 1790, when the raja of B\u00e1nsi inflicted a severe defeat on their combined bands. They had early in the century slain the heir-apparent of a B\u00e1nsi raja; and with them, therefore, the Sarnets had something of a blood-feud.\n\nBut misrule came to a gradual end after November, 1801, when, in payment of arrears of subsidies due under various treaties, Basti and other districts were ceded by Oudh to the East India Company. Musalm\u00e1n rule was now extinct; and on the principle \"nothing save good of the dead\" we may quote as its epitaph the only words that have been said in its favour. \"It must be observed,\" writes Buchanan, \"notwithstanding the ferocity usually attributed to the Muhammadan conquerors, that scarcely any family of note among the native chiefs who possessed the country before the conquest had become extinct or been deprived of its lands during the long period which followed under Muhammadan control. But that, during the Hiuda Government, each change had been followed by the complete destruction or banishment of the family that was subdued.\"\n\nThe wretched condition of the district at cession has been amply described elsewhere. It was \"almost entirely without administration, overgrown with jungle, infested by robbers, and in many places laid waste by the armed retainers of the principal landholders.\" When the first collector, Mr. Routledge, took charge on behalf of the Company, he found his hands filled. He had first to get rid of the Oudh troops, clamouring for arrears of pay; next, of the parasitic Oudh officials,\n\n---\n\n1 P. 448. 2 Above, pp 379-80, 451-52. 3 Buchanan calls him \"Major Rutledge.\"\nThis nomenclature is perhaps the result of a confusion with Major Roughsedge, a well-known political and military officer of that day. But it is possible that, like Sir William Macnaghten and others, Mr. Routledge had been transferred from the military to the civil service of the Company. After crossing the Rapti, on their way from Gorakhpur to Lucknow, these troops lingered awhile and plundered the surrounding country (Board's Records). This district, which lay on the high-road to Oudh, must have been the principal sufferer.\nwho had at the same time stung and sucked the blood of the country. In his efforts to establish a police he was more successful than in his attempts to frame a solvent land assessment. To restore order a force of 360 sibandis was in March, 1802, raised by Captain Malcolm McLeod; while by November of the same year all defensible castles save those of the Amorha and Basti rajas had been razed to the ground. The latter measure was rendered necessary by the contumacious attitude of landholders who felt galled by the unaccustomed yoke of a real government.\n\nThe district was already making swift progress towards prosperity when that progress was checked by the Nepalese war (1814). The operations of the campaigns in 1815 and the following year have been recounted once for all. Suffice it to remind the reader that the cause of strife was the disputed territory comprising Shiuraj, north of the modern Basti, and B\u00fatwal north of the modern Gorakhpur. The police established in these frontier tracts by the British Collector had been slain or expelled by the Nepalese. During the war the north of the district suffered not only from the incursions of the enemy, but from the lawlessness of its own inhabitants. Notwithstanding the presence of a garrison which General Wood had left entrenched at Lautan, a night attack was in March, 1815, made on the Bansi tahsil by 200 men supposed to be \"Jackal-killers.\" Though the assault was repulsed, two grenadiers (barkandde) were killed: while four others, and the tahsildar himself, were wounded. A party conveying treasure was in May of the same year surprised as far south as Maghar by a band of gang-robbers (dakdit), who killed three grenadiers, wounded 17, and carried off nearly 21,000 rupees. With a perhaps unconscious pun the collector remarks that the grenadiers, being armed only with matchlocks of uncertain fire were no match for the long spears of the banditti.\n\nThe Nepalese war ended in March, 1816, but not so the turbulence which it had excited. In May of that year the Bansi tahsil was again attacked by Jackal-killers. The attack was again beaten off, but not without a loss of seven killed and six wounded. In January, 1817, over 6,000 rupees of treasure were plundered by gang-robbers at Captainganj. But by June, when the\n\n---\n\n1 Board's Records and Buchanan, II., 344.

Jackal-killer (siydr-marico) is a nickname applied to the Musshar caste; but it is here, probably, intended as a general term for men of low birth and character.\n4 But before the Nepalese war such robberies had been not altogether unknown. In March, 1811, and in a wood near Basti, some treasure on its way from Amorha was plundered by a band of 50 robbers. In January, 1812, another convoy of Government money was attacked between Mahauli and Azangarh by a gang supposed to be Jackal-killers from Balrampur in Oudh. Ibid.\nboundary with Nep\u00e1l was marked out according to treaty, order seems to have been restored.\\footnote{Ibid.} It was next and last disturbed by the rebellion of 1857-58.\n\nThe history of that sedition naturally centres in Gorakhpur, the capital of the district whereof Basti was then a part. But in recapitulating the main features of the outbreak we may add a few local details.\\footnote{Taken chiefly from Mr. (afterwards Sir Charles) Wingfield's Mutiny Narrative for Gorakhpur-Basti.} At Azamgarh on the 5th June, 1857, mutinied the headquarters of the 17th Native Infantry, which supplied detachments both to Gorakhpur and to the Opium Treasury at Basti. On the 8th and 9th their example was followed by the troops at Faizabad. Seven English officers from the latter garrison, who had failed in an attempt to descend the Gh\u00e1gra, crossed over that river into this district. Gathering together at Amorha, they thence proceeded to Captainganj, where the tahsildar warned them to avoid Basti and the detachment of the 17th. Turning at his advice towards G\u00e1egh\u00e1t, they were by a promise of accommodation and sharbat inveigled into Mahu\u00e1dabar of parganah Nagar. Here they were all save one massacred by the Muslim inhabitants (10th June). The survivor passed through some rather thrilling adventures to be rescued by Mr. Pepp\u00e9 and to tell the tale.\\footnote{See Oudh Gazetteer, I., 479-83.} Mr. Pepp\u00e9, a planter who for the time had been created deputy-magistrate, burnt Mahu\u00e1dabar to the ground. In this act of righteous retribution he was assisted by a party of the 13th Irregular Cavalry.\n\nOther fugitives from Faizabad met with a kinder reception. Colonel Lennox of the 22nd Native Infantry and his family were saved from destruction by Muhammad Hasan, afterwards rebel ruler of the district. Hiding them for a while in his little castle, he at last despatched them, disguised as natives, to Gorakhpur. A party of natives, dressed in their discarded clothes, were first sent out towards that city, beguiling his retainers and the surrounding villages into the belief that the Europeans had already departed.\\footnote{Colonel Lennox's narrative, Ibid., 478.} Muhammad Hasan's conduct on this occasion perhaps preserved his neck next year, when the gallows were busy. Another future rebel, Mirza Ali Hasan, followed his example by saving, near Amorha, two customs patrols. On the 19th June, Captain Boileau and four other officers from Gonda fled across the north of the district to B\u00e1nsi. After being sheltered here for a few days by the loyal raja, they departed through Gorakhpur to Gh\u00e1zipur, escorted by some of his troopers and matchlockmen.\n\nAbout this time the Basti detachment of the 17th Native Infantry plundered the opium treasury and marched off, but without injuring the few European resi-\ndents. About this time, too, martial law was proclaimed throughout the district. Instigated and sometimes led by their chief, the r\u00e1ja of Nagar, the Gautam Rajputs in July rose. They at once dispossessed existing proprietors of all lands which tradition assigned to their own ancestors; and their turbulent example was followed by most of the Amorha landholders, who openly defied the Government officials. It was proclaimed that British rule had given place to that of Oudh. And from Oudh, at the meetings of the Nagar r\u00e1ja and his rebel colleagues, it was resolved to obtain assistance.\n\nOn the 1st August the Gorakhpur detachment of the 17th was disarmed by Nepalese troops, and affairs began to assume a brighter appearance. But the Nepalese officers were averse to move their cholera-stricken forces. When this was once known, disorder again made head. On the 10th, local rebels, aided by a party from Oudh, plundered the Khalilabad tahsil; while on the same day the b\u00e1bu of Bakhira, an illegitimate descendant of the B\u00e1nsi family, expelled the police from Bakhira station. Two days later, the Captainganj tahsil was captured by insurgents who, for the first time, included Muhammad Hasan. Forty troopers of the irregular cavalry, who had been detached for the protection of the tahsil, here went over to the enemy. On the 13th matters were considered sufficiently threatening to justify the evacuation of the district. Its British officers and the Nepalese troops left together. But the joint magistrate, Mr. Bird, remained to supervise the labours of a committee of five r\u00e1jas to whom the management of Gorakhpur and Basti had been entrusted. This assembly, of which the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1ja was a member, proved unable to maintain order. Another member, the Kausik r\u00e1ja of Gop\u00e1lpur, tried in vain to restore the loyalty of his Gautam kinsmen in Nagar. So little, in truth, did his efforts succeed, that the uncle of the Nagar r\u00e1ja placed a guard over Mr. Bird's house. When that officer was at length forced to fly, the committee dissolved itself. On the following day Muhammad Hasan made his public entry into Gorakhpur, and rebel misrule was established.\n\nIn his administration Muhammad Hasan retained existing fiscal and judicial sub-divisions. But his conservatism in this matter disgusted many of the landholders, his partizans, who declared that under former Viceroys of Delhi police jurisdictions were unknown. Dresses of honour and salutes were bestowed on the r\u00e1ja of Nagar and other chiefs who furnished contingents to the rebel army. Within the limits of their respective domains, or what they claimed as such, they were allowed to exercise full civil and criminal powers. The r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi refused to recognize Muhammad Hasan's authority or to surrender the treasure at the B\u00e1nsi tahsil. He on one occasion defeated a large force which had\nbeen sent to coerce him. But hostile preparations which seemed irresistible at length constrained him to submit and receive a rebel tahsildar at Bansi. Being a woman and the niece of an important insurgent, the loyal rani of Basti was allowed a greater latitude of resistance. She succeeded in preventing the establishment of a rebel police at Basti.\n\nBut before January 1858 was in its teens the simultaneous arrival in Gorakhpur of British and Nepalese forces put Muhammad Hasan to flight. Such was his panic speed that on the very day of his rout at Gorakhpur he spurred across the south of Basti and passed over the Ghagra to Tanda. A Gurkha detachment was despatched through the district to Gonda. Crossing the Ghagra on the 18th February, at Phulpur of Mahauli, the field-force under Colonel Rowcroft again defeated the rebels. They were again worsted at Amorha on the 17th April. After this British order was rapidly restored. In the distribution of penalties and rewards that followed the Bakhira babu was hanged, while the Nagar raja probably escaped a similar fate only by suicide. The estates of both were confiscated; and those of the latter were bestowed on the raja of Bansi, who was afterwards created a Companion of the Star of India. The lands of the rani of Amorha, who had been implicated in the rebellion, were in the same manner granted to the rani of Basti. The revenue on all forfeited estates amounted to Rs. 65,135, the items for the different parganahs being these: Rasulpur, Rs. 3,225; Bansi, Rs. 4,626; Binayakpur Rs. 1,289; Amorha, Rs. 9,079; Nagar, Rs. 29,848; Basti, Rs. 4,722; Mahauli, Rs. 4,761; and Maghar, Rs. 7,585.\n\nThus ended the most important passage in the history of the district.\n\nFormation of the present district, 1865.\n\nLater events of note, such as the land-assessment and the visitations of drought, have been described elsewhere. But the most remarkable occurrence in the recent annals of the Basti parganahs was their severance from Gorakhpur and constitution into a new collectorate. This arrangement came into force on the 6th May, 1865. It has resulted in a vastly improved administration; and if the native rulers from whom the district was received could revisit the scene of their wilful failures, they would perforce confess the power of a good government \"to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land.\"\n\n1 Oudh Gazetteer, I. 547. 2 Colonel Rowcroft's letters, dated 22nd February and 19th April, respectively, preserved in station-staff office at Gorakhpur. 3 Government order No. 1596 (General Department) bearing that date.\nGAZETTEER\nOF THE\nNORTH-WESTERN PROVINCES,\nBASTI DISTRICT.\n\nCONTENTS.\u00b9\n\n| Amorha | ... | ... | 731 |\n|--------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Amorha parganah | ... | ... | 732 |\n| Bakhira | ... | ... | 737 |\n| Bankaon | ... | ... | 738 |\n| Bankata | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Bansil | ... | ... | 739 |\n| Bansil tahsil | ... | ... | 741 |\n| Bansil parganah | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Barakuni | ... | ... | 748 |\n| Basti | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Basti tahsil | ... | ... | 752 |\n| Basti parganah | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Belwa | ... | ... | 757 |\n| Bhadesar | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Bhapur | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Bhari | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Binayakpur parganah | ... | ... | 758 |\n| Birdpur | ... | ... | 761 |\n| Biskohar | ... | ... | 762 |\n| Buddhahand | ... | ... | 763 |\n| Captaignanj | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Chhoni | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Chhapia | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Chhapraghat or Dhanghata | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Chillis | ... | ... | ... |\n| Daldaha | ... | ... | 764 |\n| Debarua | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Domariaganj | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Domariaganj tahsil | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Dubaulia | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Dudhara | ... | ... | 765 |\n| Gaghat | ... | ... | ib. |\n\n| Ganeshpur | ... | ... | 765 |\n| Harsia | ... | ... | 766 |\n| Harsia tahsil | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Haribarpur | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Intwa | ... | ... | 767 |\n| Jignan | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Kalwari | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Kakrahaghat | ... | ... | 768 |\n| Khalilabad | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Khalilabad tahsil | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Kothia or Sonaha | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Lalganj | ... | ... | 769 |\n| Lautan | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Maghar | ... | ... | 770 |\n| Maghar parganah | ... | ... | 773 |\n| Mahuli | ... | ... | 777 |\n| Mahuli parganah | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Mahson | ... | ... | 782 |\n| Mehbdawal | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Misraulia | ... | ... | 784 |\n| Nagar | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Nagar parganah | ... | ... | 785 |\n| Narkatha | ... | ... | 789 |\n| Paikaulia | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Parasrampur | ... | ... | 790 |\n| Rasipur parganah | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Rudhuali | ... | ... | 795 |\n| Sirsi | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Sitarampur | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Tama | ... | ... | 796 |\n| Tilokpur | ... | ... | ib. |\n| Uska | ... | ... | ib. |\n\nAmorha, a village which gives its name to a parganah of tahsil Harsia, lies in tappa Ramgarh of that tract, 23 miles west-by-south of Basti. It adjoins the right bank of the Ramrekha rivulet, which is, however, known by different local names above and below the village. The population amounted in 1872 to 1,394 persons.\n\n\u00b9 This list contains the names of all tahsils, parganahs, tahsil capitals, house-tax towns, police-stations, post-offices, villages with over 3,000 inhabitants, and scenes of important fairs. One or two places of historical or commercial interest have been added.\nPassing north-westwards through their mud habitations, the unmetalled road from G\u00e1egh\u00e1t some three miles further on joins the metalled Basti-Faizabad highway. Amorha has an imperial post-office, and in March-April becomes the scene of a fair known as the R\u00e1mrekha.\n\nEver since Akbar's reign (1556-1605), and perhaps since earlier times, the village has been the capital of parganah Amorha. It was for three or four centuries the seat of the K\u00e1yath r\u00e1jas who disputed the sway of that parganah with the S\u00farajbansi R\u00e9jputs. Writing some forty-five years before the final extinction (1858) of the title, Buchanan seems to have imagined that the Amorha r\u00e1jas were themselves S\u00farajbansis, as will appear from his remarks on the local antiquities:\n\n\"There is,\" he says, \"a very long winding canal, extending from Amorha to R\u00fapnagar, another seat of the Suryabansi family. It is said to be 1\u00bd kos (about 8 miles) long and is about 30 yards wide, but in many places is nearly obliterated, and bears every mark of high antiquity. There are on its sides several heaps like the ruins of old buildings, but very much reduced by the action of time. The r\u00e1ja attributes the work to a person of his family named Radal Singh; but it seems much too old for his (i.e., Radal Singh's) time. In digging on the north side of the canal the r\u00e1ja's grandfather discovered an image which has been placed in a mud-walled hut called the Lord's house (Th\u00e1kurv\u00e1ri), and is grotesquely clothed, being now considered as the family deity. It is a complete image, and not a carving in relief as usual in Hindu images, nor has it any attendants. It is about the human size, nor have I before seen any such. The priest calls it the keeper of Bali r\u00e1ja.\"\n\nAfter explaining with perhaps needless length that Bali, a great-great-grandson of St. Kasyap, was driven to hell by Vamana, an incarnation of Vishnu\u2014\n\n\"Bali, however,\" the same writer adds, \"was of such consequence that after an incarnation of Vishnu sent him to hell, it was necessary for so great a deity to remain there and watch him; and the priest alleges that this image represents that incarnation. It has, however, no resemblance to the other images of Vamana that I have seen. The priest further says that this image was placed here by Ambarisha, a king of Ajudhya, of the family of the sun. The Muslins destroyed the temple and threw out the image; which was afterwards found by a potter, and placed where it now is by Ranjit Singh, uncle of the present r\u00e1ja.\"\n\nAmorha, the most western parganah of the district and the Haraia tahsil, is bounded on the east by parganahs Nagar and Basti; on the north and west by the Gonda district of Oudh; and on the south-west by the river Gh\u00e1gra, which severs it from the Oudh district of Faizabad. It is sub-divided into six tappas, named respectively Bangton, Purena, R\u00e1mgarh, Dubaulia, Belwa, and Sikandarpur; and contains 882 estates (mah\u00e1l), coinciding with the same number of parishes (mauza). Amorha had in 1878 an area of 171,456 acres, or nearly 268 square miles, and a land revenue (excluding cesses) of Rs. 1,62,070.\nAccording to the census of 1872 it contained 831 inhabited sites, whereof\n\nPopulation.\n\n511 had less than 200 inhabitants; 268 between 200 and 500; 39 between 500 and 1,000; and 13 between 1,000 and 2,000. The population numbered 17,409 souls (80,975 females), giving 652 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 162,753 Hind\u00fas, of whom 75,332 were females, and 11,956 Musalm\u00e1ns (5,643 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 31,106 Br\u00e1hmans (14,787 females), 14,600 R\u00e1jputs (5,912 females), and 6,283 Baniyas (2,898 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 110,764 souls (51,735 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (20,983), Kanaujia (297), Gaur (355), Gautam (253), P\u00e1nde, S\u00e1ras\u00fat, and Sangaldwipi. The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Ponw\u00e1r (116), Bais (1,378), Gautam (12), Parw\u00e1r (494), Chauh\u00e1n (339), S\u00farajbansi (7,096), Bh\u00e1reddhw\u00e1j (3,533), Raghubansi (179), Konohik, Shi\u00fabansi, R\u00e9jkum\u00e1r, Bh\u00e1la-Sult\u00e1n, Kinw\u00e1r, N\u00e1gbansi, Gaur, Baghel, Raikaw\u00e1r, and B\u00e1nsi clans; the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (258), Kasaudhan (3,432), K\u00e1ndu (547), Agarahri, (405), Gol\u00e1puri, Dh\u00fasar, S\u00e1ndel, and Rajjab sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Kah\u00e1r (4,623), Kurmi (12,044), Teli (3,936), Dhobi (2,824), N\u00e1i (3,116), Cham\u00e1r (20,073), Ah\u00edr (16,845), Gadariya (1,756), Barhai (3,426), Loh\u00e1r (1,852), K\u00e1yath (3,155), Khewat (1,732), Tamboli (2,718), Khatf\u00edk (1,390), Kumh\u00e1r (3,339), Nuniya (1,450), Bharbhunja (1,899), Koeri (9,258), and P\u00e1si (1,529). The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Bhar, Kalw\u00e1r, Dhark\u00e1r, B\u00e1ri, Atit, Ch\u00e1i, M\u00e1li, Sun\u00e1r, Manibe,\u00b9 Gos\u00e1in, Bair\u00e1gi, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Thathera, Koli, Lodha, R\u00e9jbhat,\u00b2 Halw\u00e1i, Babeliya, Sar\u00e1hiya, Dos\u00e1dh, Mariya, Mur\u00e1o, Godhania, and Darzi. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (475), Sayyids (100), Mughals (82), Path\u00e1ns (433), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 1,161 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,945 to the domestic class, which includes servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,907 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 41,673 to the agricultural class; and 4,372 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 3,984 persons\n\n\u00b9Probably a census misprint for Manihar. \u00b2There is a caste so called. But R\u00e9jbhar is probably intended.\nreturned as labourers and 593 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 28,741 as landholders, 105,906 as cultivators, and 40,062 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 747 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 93,734 souls.\n\nA rich and open plain, sloping gently towards the south-east, the parganah Physical and agricultural features. is in that direction traversed by two principal streams. The Manar\u00e1ma drains from end to end the centre of the tract; its affluent, the R\u00e1mrekha, flows further south, past the walls of the capital Amorha. Both brooks derive some portion of their names from that deified R\u00e1ma whose court lay just across the Gh\u00e1gra; but both have other titles. While the Manar\u00e1ma is often called Manwar or Manaur, the R\u00e1mrekha is above Amorha known as Tapha, and below that town as Nista. On the edge of the Manar\u00e1ma grow rushes which are woven into matting; on the edge of the R\u00e1mrekha flourishes khar grass, which is cut for thatching and fodder. The Gh\u00e1gra is outside the parganah rather than of it; but being fickle in its choice of a bed, it frequently swallows or throws up large plots of alluvial land. Its floods often overlay and sterilize with sand the fields which lie in its basin.\n\nBut Amorha is less rich in rivers than in lagoons. Of such fishy reservoirs the chief are at Sikandarpur, Pachos, Bhagansai, and Chinthi-bh\u00e1t. The first is remarkable for the wealth of winter rice which fringes its water; the second for the abundance of shells which it offers to the lime-burner. Most of the lagoons, whether large or small, produce wild rice (tina or tini). \"This,\" writes Mr. P. J. White, \"is by the higher castes eaten exclusively on fast days; and has popularly the credit of possessing eminent medicinal properties in diarrhoea, when the grain is administered mixed with tyre (curds). The rice is palatable, and though the superior orders are dainty about making it their daily food, the poorer classes are not so squeamish in taking advantage of the bounty of nature. The plants are not cut, but are tied together at top in bundles as they stand in the water; and in Ku\u00e1r (September-October), when the ears are ripe, the grain is brushed from them.\"\n\nThis tina is almost the only really important wild growth of the parganah. Of forest produce there is next to none. Mahua and sakhu trees are numerous, while patches of scrubwood are encountered in a few northern villages. But Amorha is as devoid of any plantation that can be called a forest as of any elevation that can be called a hill. To the absence of woodland is perhaps due the more than average salubrity. But beside the Gh\u00e1gra on the south, beside\nlagoons on the west, the climate is disagreeable and goitre disfigures the inhabitants. Towards the north, again, the neighbourhood of the Gonda forests has an evil effect on health.\n\nThe soils are as usual loamy (doras), clayey (mattiydr), and sandy (balua). In the north loam is intermixed with clay; eastwards loam prevails; southwards, beside the Ghagra, the mould is altogether sandy, and of that sandy alluvial kind called manjha; while westwards the surface consists of much clay and little loam. Easily first in point of fertility, the loam soil yields every crop; but rice can be grown only in its moister hollows. The production of rice is the specialty of the clay lands; but in years of favourable winter rain they will bear also pod crops, oil-seeds, and even sugarcane or wheat. Unless heavily manured, the sandy soil is unfit for any but the poorer growths, barley, millets, and the arhar pulse. The thickly falling leaves of the last-named crop afford a by no means contemptible manure. Speaking of manure generally, we may say that it is most often and most thickly applied to the goend zone immediately surrounding the village homesteads. The middle zone (miyano) is more, and the outer (palle) zone most, sparingly treated to compost. The same remarks apply with more or less truth to irrigation. For this process the streams and the lagoons afford great facilities.\n\nOf the total cultivated area, which at assessment was returned as 105,676 acres, 84,089 were tilled for the spring and the remainder for the autumn harvest. The principal spring growths are wheat, peas, and arhar, the two last covering almost equal spaces, and between them about the same space as the first. At the autumn harvest rice so far distances all other crops that those others need not even be mentioned. Of the more paying crops, indigo is quite, and cotton almost, unknown; but during the term of the last assessment sugarcane more than doubled its area, while from one-fiftieth opium advanced to cover one-thirty-seventh of the whole parganah acreage. The owners of the soil which produces all these staples are chiefly S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jputs, robust men who when poor sometimes enter the Native Army. Roughly noting, in thousands of acres, the distribution of the land amongst its various cultivating classes, we find 42\u00bd tilled by the landlords themselves, 24\u00bd by tenants with rights of occupancy, and 38\u00bd by tenants-at-will.\n\nThe metalled Basti and Faizabad road spans from east to west the whole breadth of the parganah. On it stands the tahsil capital Haraia; from it branch north-eastwards and south-\n\n---\n\n1 The Settlement Report (1861) does not show the extent of the irrigated area. That area is now said to amount to 97,738 acres.\neastwards respectively the unmetalled lines known as the Bikramjot-Bhampur and Gorakhpur-Gonda-frontiers roads. Another great trade route is cheaply supplied by the Ghagra; while for half the year and by small vessels the Manarama also is navigable. On or near the great river or the chief highways stand the parganah capital of Amorha and the marts of Belwa and Dubaulia. The markets held weekly at these places and Haraia provide a sale for those agricultural staples which are the one great product of the tract. From Belwa, a centre towards which gravitates the surplus grain of all the surrounding parganahs, that grain is exported across river to Oudh or down river to Calcutta. An occasional emporium for such commodities is supplied by neighbouring fairs, and chiefly by that held on the Ramnanami festival at Ajudhya, across the Ghagra. But within the parganah itself, at Sitarampur opposite Ajudhya, gather two great yearly meetings of the same kind, and these will be described in the article on the village where they take place. Smaller fairs are held in December-January at Pachos village; in November-December at Amaulipur; at Amorha and Pandol village in March-April.\n\nBeing singularly poor in manufactures, Amorha makes importations which are comparatively considerable. From Nep\u00e1l to Belwa, Dubaulia, and Haraia are brought iron, copper, and utensils of those metals, spices, ginger, and turmeric. Brass vessels are imported from Mirzapur. To Belwa and Dubaulia the Ghagra, and to Haraia the Manarama, bear cloths from the cities of Bengal. From Haraia these fabrics find their way to Bans\u00ed and the markets of Oudh. Raw cotton from Kanauj and Cawnpore is imported through Lucknow in carts.\n\nThe dues levied in markets by landlords seem to disturb trade little or nothing. \"The proprietors of bazars,\" writes Mr. White, \"customarily levy a duty known as chungi on all laden carts, sumpter cattle, and carriers. For example, they take $1\\frac{1}{2}$ sers of grain per cart, $\\frac{1}{2}$ ser per buffalo load, $\\frac{1}{2}$ ser per bullock, $\\frac{1}{8}$th or $\\frac{1}{8}$th ser per coolie, $\\frac{1}{2}$ ser per maund of ghi (clarified butter), 1 anna per bale of cotton, etc. These duties are quite willingly paid for the privilege of bringing goods to market.\" Under the same heading Mr. White mentions the ghardwari levied on shops. But this, as above shown, is merely a rent. The additional tax of from $\\frac{1}{2}$ anna to 8 annas monthly for \"watch and ward\" is perhaps not quite so defensible; but this too is paid without murmur.\n\nUntil the sixteenth century Amorha has no history of its own, as apart from that already given for the district at large. But in Akbar's Institutes (1596) we find it entered, under\n\n1 P. 688. 2 Pp. 715-30.\nthe name of Amordh or Amorha, as a part of the Haveli-Avadh district (dast\u0101r) of the Oudh division (sark\u0101r) and province (s\u012bb\u0101). It was at this time still held, or had been lately held, by Bhars. They were expelled, as above shown, by Jagat Singh K\u0101yath, first r\u0101ja of Amorha. But his S\u016brajbansi coadjutors soon picked quarrels with his descendants. His successor was forced to divide the parganah with the R\u0101jputs, the latter obtaining its eastern half. Saintly Br\u0101hmans were persuaded by grants of land to settle themselves on the K\u0101yath border, as a sort of breakwater against the flood of R\u0101jput invasion. But neither the compromise nor the precaution was of much avail. The S\u016brajbansi slowly but surely gained ground, and on the death (1855) of the last K\u0101yath r\u0101ja had already attained their present position as the predominant territorial caste.\n\nMeanwhile (about 1721) the viceroys of Oudh had assumed independence of the Dehli emperors. Amorha thereby became part of a new kingdom; and by its new kings was ceded (1801) to the East India Company. It was at once included in the Gorakhpur district, and has since been assessed with the following land revenues:\u2014in 1802 Rs. 1,10,431; in 1806 Rs. 1,06,226; in 1809 Rs. 1,09,651; in 1813 Rs. 1,13,052; in 1840 Rs. 1,34,729; and in 1860 Rs. 1,65,295. The collector in 1810 reported cultivation as sufficiently extensive to justify a permanent assessment; but luckily for the exchequer the parganah is still temporarily settled. In 1865 Amorha became a portion of the newly-formed district of Bast\u012b.\n\nSome account of the local antiquities will be found in the article on Amorha. The remains are, as a rule, too decayed for identification by even an expert, but by the country-folk are generally deemed the monuments of an ancient Th\u0101ru supremacy.\n\nBakhira or B\u0101ghnagar, a market-village in tappa Bakhira of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khalilabad, stands on the crossing of two unmetalled roads, 28 miles east-north-east of Bast\u012b. Bakhira and B\u0101ghnagar are in reality not one village, but two adjacent villages. Though held in the latter, the market usually takes its name from the former. Throughout this article, therefore, let B\u0101ghnagar be called Bakhira, and let Bakhira proper be left out of consideration.\n\nThe village had in 1872 a population of 358 only. It is bounded on the east by a great lake to which it gives its name. The Bakhira-tal has, however, other titles, being known also as the Bad\u0101nch and the Moti or Pearl lagoon. The last appellation was bestowed on it by naw\u0101b Sa\u0101dat Ali of Oudh (1797-\n\n1 Pp. 681, 722.\n1814), who used often to hunt on its banks. A general description of the lake will be found above. Legend relates that it was formerly the garden of a r\u0101ja called Mangal, and that it was excavated by the mischievous tusks of a mighty boar. Lying in wait with a spear, the king slew that boar; but the beast's wraith had its vengeance. Returning from his successful quest, Mangal met a band of women celebrating a festival wherein a thread is tied round the wrist, as in the marriage-rite. And he good-humouredly joined in the ceremony; but when he reached his palace his two wives saw the thread on his wrist, and cried\u2014\"Our husband has taken a third sharer of his bed.\" And in her wrath one of them, Chola-devi, broke the thread. Thereon the goddess in whose honour that thread had been tied turned Chola-devi's face into the face of a sow. And the deformed lady fled to the woods; but after some time spent in prayer and penance, the holy saint Angira cured her and restored her beauty. And in his gratitude king Mangal built a fair staircase descending into that lake which once had been his garden.\n\nOn the feast of the Shi\u00far\u00e1ttri is held a small fair; and an unsuccessful attempt was in the beginning of the century made to remove the scene of this gathering to the site of the staircase just mentioned. But more important in a commercial aspect are those weekly markets where the agricultural produce of the surrounding country is exchanged for coarse cloth and other simple manufactures. Bakhira was formerly the capital of a large domain granted by a r\u0101ja of B\u00e1nsi to his illegitimate kinsman. In 1813 the mud rampart, ditch, and bambu hedge with which its chiefs had surrounded it still made it \"very inaccessible.\" But for his rebellion in 1857-58 the last b\u0101bu of Bakhira was hanged, and his lands became forfeit to Government. Meanwhile the domain had been recognized as a separate parganah; but this was early during British rule re-absorbed in parganah Maghar.\n\nBang\u00e1on, a village in tappa Bang\u00e1on of parganah Amorha and tahsil Haraia, stands in the extreme north-western corner of the latter, 29 miles west-north-west of Basti. But this distance is measured as the crow flies, for Bang\u00e1on is approached by no road. Its population amounted in 1872 to but 493 souls; and the village is remarkable only as the site of a district post-office.\n\nBankata, a village of tappa Majora, in the extreme north of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khalilabad, stands beside an unmetalled road, 32 miles north-east of Basti. Here are a third-class police-station and a population, according to the last census, of 324 inhabitants. Within a few yards of the\n\n---\n\n1 P. 568. 2 Eastern India, II., 395. 3 Supra, p. 676.\npolice-station may be seen a district post-office, which for some reason unknown appears to be called Daldalha.\n\nB\u00e1nsi, the capital of the tahsil and the pargana so named, crowns the right or south bank of the R\u00e9pti, 32 miles north-north-east of Basti. Several unmetalled roads from Basti, Domariaganj, Nep\u00e1l, Bankata, and elsewhere converge upon the town; and the R\u00e9pti is crossed by a ferry belonging to the local r\u00e1ja. During the rainy season the surrounding country is flooded far and near by that river. At other times, between the high bank of the river and the raised site of the town intervenes a narrow stretch of cultivated land. But on the east, during most months, lies an accumulation of water left by the floods; and into the depression which it occupies flows most of the town's surface drainage.\n\nBut B\u00e1nsi should perhaps be called an overgrown village rather than a town. It had in 1872 a population of 3,391 persons only. And it is a settlement of the somewhat squalid type usual in rural India: a mass of mud hovels, dotted here and there with a temple, a mosque, or the brick-built house of some grain-dealer. Its northern suburb Narkatha, the seat of the r\u00e1ja, lies across the R\u00e9pti; and will be mentioned in a separate article. But the r\u00e1jas of B\u00e1nsi used once to live in B\u00e1nsi itself, and the remains of their castle may still be seen on a high site in the south-east corner of the town. In the midst of the ruins rises a great p\u0101kar fig, the supposed abode of a demon who did a former r\u00e1ja to death; and this tree is now an object of worship. Buchanan, who thought that the castle was originally reared on a heap of Th\u00e1ru remains, adds that the demon was the ghost of a Br\u00e1hman. Another foundation of the r\u00e1jas is the temple of Tegdhar, which, built in 1767-68, is still one of the most noted Hindu places of worship in Basti.\n\nThe town may be divided into two parts, B\u00e1nsi proper and Sitalganj. The former, which is also the older, has a narrow and somewhat tortuous main street running from south to north, and rising rather suddenly towards the river. From this street, which is the artery of business, diverge on east and west other narrow roadways. Though lying close south of B\u00e1nsi proper, Sitalganj is divided therefrom by a plot of low ground. Much smaller than its northern neighbour, it is also far neater. Built on a well-raised site, it has four wide roads, meeting in a centre which is used as a market-place on Saturdays. Another market is held just east of B\u00e1nsi proper on Tuesday.\n\nAbout a hundred yards north-west of B\u00e1nsi stands the small and fort-like tahsili, to which is attached a garden. The other public buildings of the place are the first-class police-\nstation, the munsif's court, the imperial post-office, the tahsili school, the hostelry (sarai) for natives, the staging-bungalow, and the branch dispensary. In this goitre-stricken neighbourhood the institution last named is felt to be a great boon. In 1870 Dr. Planck saw \"quite a little line\" of sufferers sitting patiently outside in the sunshine, \"awaiting the drying of the red iodide of mercury applied to their swollen throats.\" While on the subject of sanitation, we may mention that the water of the Bans\u00ed wells is, as a rule, bad, discoloured, and often unpleasant to the taste. Three or four only of such reservoirs supply water fit for drinking; and the people slake their thirst chiefly from the R\u00e1pti. How damp the locality is in the rainy season is proved by the fact that the water in these wells then rises to within seven feet of the surface.\n\nDuring the past quarter century the prosperity of Bans\u00ed would seem to have declined. It was once an important entrep\u00f4t for grain, which passed through it for shipment on the R\u00e1pti. Since 1855, however, when the R\u00e1pti proper shot its deep stream across country to join the Burhi R\u00e1pti, this traffic has dwindled. The Ahwa channel, which now connects the two rivers, is narrow, winding, and impetuous. The difficulty of its navigation somewhat deters merchandise from passing down stream by way of the Burhi R\u00e1pti; while below Bans\u00ed the bed of the R\u00e1pti itself has become almost too shoal to bear any cargoes save those of the rainy season. The house-tax, which was formerly levied in the town under Act V. of 1861, has been abolished. But a fair local business in grain is still carried on at the weekly markets; and Bans\u00ed has also two yearly fairs, which, though theoretically religious, are practically mercantile.\n\nLike Bans-Bareli in Rohilkhand, commonly called Bareilly, Bans\u00ed probably derives its name from some ancient plantation or plantations of bamboos (bans); but like Bans-Bareli, it is reputed to take its title from a founder styled R\u00e1ja Bansdeo. The name of this prince was perhaps invented, as usual in ancient legends, to account for that of his foundation. The site of the town is said to have before his time been called the promontory (komar), because it protruded into the R\u00e1pti. And there is probably this amount of truth in the tradition, that about 1570 a raja of Maghar was driven northwards by Muslim invasions to take refuge at Bans\u00ed, whence ever since his descendants have taken their titles.\n\nThe further history of the town coincides with that of its r\u00e1jas, and the latter has been told above. Though he now bears, in the Government\n\n---\n\n1 There is still on the north-eastern outskirt of Bans\u00ed a village called Baghaua Komar.\n2 Pp. 672-76.\ntahsild\u00e1r, \"a brother near the throne,\" the r\u00e9ja is still the great local magnate.\n\nB\u00e1nsi, a tahsil with headquarters at the place just described, is bounded on east-south-east by the Gorakhpur district, the border being supplied chiefly by the Gh\u00fanghi and Dhamela rivers; on the north-east and north by Nep\u00e1l; on west-north-west by the Domari\u00e1ganj tahsil; and on its rather irregular southern frontier by the Basti and Khal\u00edabad tahsils. Tahsil B\u00e1nsi contains the parganah of Bin\u00e1yakpur and the 29 eastern and southern tappas of parganah B\u00e1nsi. It had in 1878 a total area of 389,931 acres, or over 609 square miles, and a total land revenue of Rs. 2,43,545. Its population in 1872 was 287,681, or 472 persons to the square mile. But a detailed account of the tahsil will be found in the articles on its two parganahs.\n\nB\u00e1nsi or Ratanpur-B\u00e1nsi, the most northern and the largest parganah of the district, forms part of the Domari\u00e1ganj and B\u00e1nsi tahsils. It is bounded on the east by the Gorakhpur district and parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur; on the north by Nep\u00e1l. Its north-western and south-western sides are indented by the Gonda district and parganah Ras\u00falpur respectively. It marches on the south with parganah Maghar. The boundary with Gorakhpur is provided mostly by the Gh\u00fanghi and Dhamela rivers; the boundary with Gonda mostly by the Budhi R\u00e1pti and its affluent, the Arra. B\u00e1nsi is divided into 40 tappas. Of these the 11 western\u2014Budhi, Kop, Hir, Kot, Kh\u00e1nkot, Dew\u00e1ichp\u00e1r, Dhebarua, Khajahni, Khira, B\u00e1r\u00edkp\u00e1r, and Kuni\u00e1on\u2014belong to the Domari\u00e1ganj tahsil. The eastern remainder, which belongs of course to tahsil B\u00e1nsi, consists of tappas Banjara, Ghos, Bargadoa, Tharauli, Sirwant, Aikhin, Barhon, Dabra, Pachahr, Kundri, N\u00e1nd\u00e1p\u00e1r, Gharw\u00e1sp\u00e1r, Soh\u00e1s, Suhela, Unt\u00e1p\u00e1r, Nagwa, Naksauli, H\u00e1ta, Chaur, Kud\u00e1ran, Chhatt\u00edsi, Beson, Bh\u00edr, Patharhat, Patna-Hasanpur, Gulaur, Kesarha, Asn\u00e1r, and Masna. The parganah contains 1,791 estates (mah\u00e1l), coinciding with the same number of villages (mausa); and of these 452 lie in the Domari\u00e1ganj tahsil. It had in 1878 an area of 519,527 acres or about 811\u00be square miles, and a land revenue of Rs. 3,38,230. Of the former somewhat over 251 square miles, and of the latter Rs. 1,12,155, belong to Domari\u00e1ganj.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah B\u00e1nsi contained 1,842 inhabited sites, of which 1,263 had less than 200 inhabitants; 496 between 200 and 500; 62 between 500 and 1,000; 10 between 1,000 and 2,000; and 11 between 3,000 and 5,000. The population numbered 361,604 souls (170,339 females), giving 854 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 292,322 Hind\u00fas,\n\n1 Sometimes divided into four, viz., Birdpur, Alid\u00e1pur-north, Alid\u00e1pur-south, and Neora.\nof whom 137,569 were females, 69,278 Musalm\u00e1ns (32,768 females), and 4 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 35,134 Br\u00e1hmans (16,651 females), 3,444 R\u00e1jputs (1,558 females), and 8,381 Baniyas (3,083 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 245,363 souls (115,477 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (7,119), Kanaujia (350), Gaur (220), Gautam (127), Sangaldw\u00edpi, Lohma, Shukul, Tiw\u00e1ri, Kunjal, Sankah\u00e1r, and Balodra. The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Panw\u00e1r (115), Bais (819), Gautam (98), Parw\u00e1r (10), Chauh\u00e1n (296), S\u00farajbansi (176), Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j (10), Raghubansi (92), Kunwar, Sirnet, Kharog, Bhimla, and Katehriya clans; the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,071), Kasaudhan (2,890), K\u00e1ndu (1,193), Agarahri (1,062), Gol\u00e1puri, Kasarw\u00e1n\u00ed, Jaisw\u00e1r, Ummar, and Bahwar sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (3,949), Kah\u00e1r (7,473), Kurmi (15,591), Teli (6,191), Dhobi (9,937), N\u00e1i (3,746), Cham\u00e1r (46,451), Ah\u00edr (39,456), Gadariya (2,093), Barhai (5,451), Loh\u00e1r (4,183), K\u00e1yath (3,137), Khewat (10,707), Tamboli (4,551), Kalw\u00e1r (3,607), Dhark\u00e1r (1,747), Kumh\u00e1r (6,447), Atit (1,069), Ch\u00e1i (4,225), M\u00e1li (4,808), Sun\u00e1r (1,800), Nuniya (5,791), Bharbhunja (2,339), Kooria (4,577), P\u00e1si (9,870), Koli (2,487), Lodha (12,388), R\u00e1jbhat\u00b9 (2,281), and Arakh (1,669).\n\nThe following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Khatik, B\u00e1ri, Manibe,\u00b2 Gos\u00e1\u00edn, Bair\u00e1gi, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Thathera, Koli, Lodha, Halw\u00e1\u00ed, Patwa, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1rhi, Baheliya, Sar\u00e1hiya, Mur\u00e1o, Darzi, Bhuf\u00edhar, Gound,\u00b3 Rangwa, Fak\u00edr, Dhuna, Bind, Suthra, Taw\u00e1\u00edf, Dom, K\u00e1ndu, J\u00e1t, K\u00e1pri, Musahar, and Bahr\u00fapiya. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (11,536), Path\u00e1ns (7,443), Sayyids (899), Mughals (560), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population, not less than 15 years of age, 434 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 5,392 to the domestic class, which includes servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 3,737 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 87,049 to the agricultural class; and 12,138 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 6,418 persons returned as labourers and 1,573 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 20,862 as landholders,\n\n\u00b9 See article on parganah Amorha, \"population,\" note. \u00b2 Vid. ibid. \u00b3 Probably a census misprint for Gond or Gaunr. The latter is a subdivisional title of several castes, such, for instance, as the Halw\u00e1\u00eds.\n261,116 as cultivators, and 79,616 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 842 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 191,265 souls.\n\nLike all the rest of the district, B\u00e1nsi is a plain. But in some respects, of degree rather than quality, it differs from its sister parganahs. It is slightly less devoid of forest than they, and it is far moister. Flowing east-south-eastwards through the south of the parganah, the river R\u00e1pti divides it into two very unequal portions. The northern or larger tract may be considered part of the marshy submontane country called the Tar\u00e1i; and here the salient geographical feature is the multitude of streams.\n\nThe R\u00e1pti is itself directly fed only by a few petty watercourses which drain the hollows of tappa Pachahr. In former days it was replenished by the Par\u00e1si,\u00b9 a stream whose chief tributaries are the Ikr\u00e1ri and the Bankasiha. But the Par\u00e1si now falls into the Chaur T\u00e1l, largest of the many weedy lagoons with which the parganah is studded; and, except in the rainy season, no outlet conveys its waters from that lagoon to the R\u00e1pti. Yet if the R\u00e1pti absorbs few streams, another river which is supposed to occupy its ancient bed absorbs a host of streams. Itself sluggish and meandering, the old (Burhi) R\u00e1pti acts as a great catchment drain for the reception of many a dashing brook from the Nep\u00e1lse mountains or the country near their foot. It swallows in succession the Arra, the Charangahwa or Chhagrihwa, the Awinda or Aondahi, the Ghurhisotwa, and the Debil\u00e1ti. It next receives on its opposite or right bank the Sikri watercourse, and finally unites with the rapid B\u00e1nganga at Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t. Into the streams already mentioned flow many others. Thus the Awinda is reinforced by the Sarohi, and the Sarohi by the Kurma and the Satohi. But the enumeration of all such minor rivulets would swell the present article to a length which, even if permissible, would be harassing. The rivers of this tract, whether small or large, are constantly changing their courses. After its junction with the B\u00e1nganga the Burhi R\u00e1pti has of late years been joined, through the Ahwa watercourse, by the R\u00e1pti itself. The united stream floats on till, at the edge of the parganah and the district, it meets the Dhamela. And this introduces us to another system of northern drainage.\n\nOf the streams which compose that system we need here mention only those which cross the northern border. The less important brooks, which\n\n\u00b9 Called by Buchanan the Gh\u00e1gar or H\u00e1h\u00e1. But different local names, as in the case of Rhine and Scheidt, are here applied to many rivers in different parts of their courses.\nrise within the parganah itself, must for sake of brevity be omitted. The Masdi joins the Jamw\u00e1r; the Siswa and the Tinawa join the Til\u00e1r; the Jamw\u00e1r and Til\u00e1r combine to form a river known as the K\u00fanda or K\u00fara. The K\u00fara again is met by the Hagni; and after its later junction with the Ghunghi is styled the Dhamela.\n\nThe smaller geographical division of B\u00e1nsi, the division south of the R\u00e9pti, is far less swampy. Its greater distance from the Him\u00e1laya and the Tar\u00e1i forests render its rainfall far smaller; and its climate is far less feverish. Its streams are purely indigenous; for the exotic waters, those born outside the parganah, have been checked in their southward course by the R\u00e9pti. Of these homebred brooks the largest are the Bar\u00e1r and its affluent, the Budh. They are formed by the union of numerous channels which, rising sometimes less than a mile from the southern bank of the R\u00e9pti, suggest the idea of sluices or escapes from a canal flowing on a higher level. Clearcut, broad, and deep, the bed of the Bar\u00e1r favours the tradition that it was once a bed of the R\u00e9pti. After being joined on the southern frontier by the Budh, this Bar\u00e1r flows on to join the \u00c1mi in Maghar.\n\nThe soils of the parganah are classed as clay (mattiy\u00e1r), loam (doras), and sand (bahua). But of the clay there is a great deal, and of the sand there is probably very little. A limy-looking variety (bh\u00e1t) of the former is extremely common on the banks of the R\u00e9pti, and in the lowlying basins which convey northern streams towards that river. Being constantly flooded in the rainy season, it produces no autumn crop; but for the same reason it yields, without irrigation, a rich spring harvest. The people themselves less frequently name soil according to its natural composition than according to its position with regard to the village homestead. Land is generally called \"near\" (goenr), or surrounding that homestead; \"middling\" (miy\u00e1na), or surrounding the near; and \"far\" (pallu), or surrounding the middling.\n\nWhat proportion of the total area is cultivated cannot exactly be shown. Many of the villages are forest grants;\u00b9 and having thereby escaped re-assessment have also escaped survey. The principal grants are those of Alid\u00e1pur, Birdpur, and Neora in tappa Ghos; Katahla in tappa B\u00e1rikp\u00e1r; Sarauli in tappa Unt\u00e1p\u00e1r; and Soh\u00e1s in tappa Soh\u00e1s. None of these measures less than 3,000 acres, and they cover between them over 60,900. But of the assessed villages, which measured 409,096 acres, we know that 260,219 acres were cultivated and that 99,883 more were cultivable. Of the cultivated area, again, 111,126 acres were watered; while less than \u00b3\u2044\u2081\u2080th was occupied by\n\n\u00b9 Supra, pp. 286-88.\nmango groves. B\u00e1nsi is no doubt sufficiently moist to retain its moisture without the aid of trees; but so long as it produces more grain than it needs, one can hardly sympathize with Mr. Wynne's remark that such plantations are a deplorable waste of the best land. Since 1813 the \"very stately forest\" of sal and other trees on the banks of Burhi R\u00e1pti, the stunted woods on the banks of Jamw\u00e1r and Til\u00e1r, have been thinned with no sparing axe. And the plough has made great inroads on the dismal stretches of long coarse grass which, flooded in the rains and withered in summer, offended the eye of Buchanan.\n\nBesides the usual autumn and spring harvests, Mr. Wynne reckons a third, the winter or jarhan. But the only crop garnered at this intermediate reaping is rice, the staple grain not only of the northern clay lands but of the parganah at large. Rice is also the chief growth of autumn, covering more than thrice the ground occupied by the second great crop of that season, urd or m\u00e1sh pulse. The principal products of the spring harvest are wheat, and next, after a long interval, barley, peas, linseed, and arkar pulse. None of the crops hitherto mentioned covers less than 10,000 acres. The area occupied by the more paying staples\u2014poppy, sugarcane, tobacco, and vegetables\u2014is comparatively small. But in years just preceding assessment landlords strive to reduce the apparent value of the land, and such crops are sparsely grown. It is significant that within the two years immediately succeeding the assessment survey the cultivation of poppy had increased in the proportion of 84 to 137. The masters of the soil are chiefly Br\u00e1hmans.\n\nThe parganah has no manufactures worth mentioning. The crops, which are its only important product, find a sale at many villages where weekly markets are held. But if B\u00e1nsi is not a great producer, it is a great distributor. Its through-trade with Nep\u00e1l centres in the marts of Biskohar and Uska; and how considerable the traffic of these places is has been shown above. Fairs are held twice yearly at B\u00e1nsi; at Kakrah\u00edgh\u00e1t in October-November, and in March-April near Alid\u00e1pur. The gathering last named, which assembles on what is called the Dasahra of Chait (March-April), is the most important of its kind in the parganah. Lasting for about nine days, it is held in honour of a goddess named P\u00e1lta. Before her image are offered goats, rams, and even buffaloes; but the real object of the fair is commerce rather than religion. Buchanan (1813) estimated the number of visitors at 50,000, of whom some 300 or 400 were the usual itinerant tradesmen. Since his time, however, the attendance has greatly declined. A second and smaller fair was formerly held at the same place on the Dasahra of K\u00e1rttik (October-\n\n---\n\n1 P. 699.\nNovember). The principal road centres of the parganah are B\u00e1nsi and Dumdumwa. The principal roads are the unmetalled lines (1) from Domari\u00e1ganj to Nep\u00e1l by way of Intwa; (2) from Basti to Nep\u00e1l by way of B\u00e1nsi, Dumdumwa, and Birdpur; (3) from Dumdumwa to Lautan. But the parganah is intersected also by some four or five unmetalled lines of a poorer class. During the rainy season traffic is greatly impeded by the flooded state of the country. But several of the rivers, such as the two R\u00e1ptis and the Dhamela, are navigable; and were it not for numerous \"snags,\" the same might be said of many northern streams like the Jamw\u00e1r. The only places of importance, besides those already mentioned, are Chilia, Dhebarua, Misraulia, Sob\u00e1s, and Tharauli.\n\nTill the beginning of the present century the history of B\u00e1nsi is almost identical with that of the Sarnet r\u00e1jas, who derive their title from its capital. Little, therefore, need here be added to what has been said on pages 672-76. In Akbar's Institutes (1596) the parganah is entered as Ratanpur-Maghar or Ratanpur-B\u00e1nsi, the first part of this name being derived from that of its r\u00e1ja, Ratan; while Katahla, which was just afterwards absorbed within its limits, appears as a separate sub-division. But if B\u00e1nsi gained by the annexation of Katahla on the north, it lost by the gradual separation of Maghar on the south. The first to withdraw any part of the latter parganah from the rule of its Sarnet r\u00e1ja were the invading Musalm\u00e1ns; but large tracts were afterwards alienated by the act of the r\u00e1jas themselves. Thus, towards the end of last century 987 villages were made over to a cadet of the family, the ancestor of the rebel b\u00e1bu of Bakhira.\n\nAbout 80 years after B\u00e1nsi had fallen from the grasp of Akbar's successors into that of their now independent Oudh deputies, it was ceded (1801) by the latter to the English. B\u00e1nsi, Maghar, and Bakhira were recognized as separate parganahs of the newly-formed Gorakhpur district; and the first was included in the B\u00e1nsi tahsil. The demands with which it was assessed at successive settlements of land-revenue were: in 1802, Rs. 24,120; in 1806, Rs. 21,591; in 1809, Rs. 29,439; in 1813, Rs. 81,571; in 1840, Rs. 2,45,541; and in 1864, Rs. 3,05,127. From the three last sets of figures the advance which cultivation had made during 50 years of British rule is clearly apparent. In the year succeeding that last named B\u00e1nsi was severed from Gorakhpur, to form part of the newly-created Basti district.\n\n\"The chief remains of antiquity,\" writes Bachanau, \"is (sic) Katahla, in the forest on the southern bank of the Bash\u00ed R\u00e1pti. It is said to have originally been a seat of the Th\u00e1r\u00e1s, after which it became the chief residence of chiefs called the Katahla r\u00e1jas.\" They appear to have been totally exterminated by the\n\n1 Supra, pp. 674-75, 720, and 724.\nSarnet chief who took the place.\u201d But a legend asserts that \u201cthe family, having offended\nthe goddess of their city (Katahla Devi), was by her converted into stones, and that these\nstill remain in their original forms. The place seems to have been a town with many buildings\nof brick and small tanks, but no traces of fortification; and to have extended more than a\nmile each way, although I could not fully trace its outline. The brick buildings are reduced\nto mere heaps; but the bricks are not so much broken as in the ruins usually attributed to the\nTh\u0101r\u016bs, and they are quite in a different style. The ruins of Th\u0101r\u016bs usually consist of one\ngreat mass like what may be supposed to have been the remains of one great building, with\nsome small heaps adjacent; but Katahla consists of many small heaps scattered at irregular\ndistances over a great extent of ground.\n\n\u201cThere are few stones remaining. One, which is a flag smoothed on one side and cut into\nmouldings on the edges, is placed with one end in the ground and worshipped as Katahla Devi.\nMany offerings of potter\u2019s ware are placed around; for it is supposed that no cowherd or\nwoodcutter could safely enter the forest without procuring her favour by such an offering.\nThe Bhars of Sanauli are the priests; whence perhaps it may be inferred that the r\u0101jas of\nKatahla were of this tribe, which it is generally allowed to have succeeded the Th\u0101r\u016bs. Near\nthis stone, on the side of a tank, are the foundations of two small temples, the chamber in\neach of which has been only a few feet in diameter. In one is placed part of an image called\nBhaw\u0101ni; but it is the head and breast of a male, so far as can be judged from what remains.\nThe fragments worshipped in the ruin of the other temple are so small that it is impossible to say\nwhat they have been intended to represent. On a heap of brick, some way distant from thence,\nis lying a stone spout which terminates in a crocodile\u2019s head very rudely carved. It probably\nserved to convey out the water used in washing the image that stood in the temple. All the\npeople, however, with me worshipped it by prostration and by touching it with their foreheads.\n\n\u201cAfter the destruction of Katahla, the Sarnet built a large mud fort at Sanauli in the\nsame forest. It has a deep and wide ditch and a strong rampart; but\nwithin there was no considerable building. The town, however, was large,\nand has contained some buildings of brick; but it has long been deserted except by a few\nBhars, who cut wood. The village of Sarayat, about 10 or 11 miles north from B\u0101nsi, stands on\na heap attributed to the Th\u0101r\u016bs, but very small and not clearly marked: the quantity of rubbish\nbeing trifling. At the south end of the village is a li\u1e45ga (phallus) very much decayed. Under\na tree in the village are some stones. Neither the pandit of the survey nor I could learn any\ntradition concerning these images.\n\n\u201cThe chief object of worship is P\u0101lta Devi in the wood near the Jamw\u0101r. The chief of\nthe convent of Atiths at Bakhira is the priest of the goddess. There are\ntwo small temples, but quite modern, having been built by the prede-\ncessor of the present priest. They are in the Muhammadan style, that consist of a cubical\nchamber surmounted by a dome. They stand on the ruins of a large temple, the foundations of\nwhich in some places are still a few feet high; and a fragment of a stone pillar, and the images,\nstill remain. There is no doubt that the images are very ancient. In one temple a large an-\ngular stone projects from the floor, and is said to be a li\u1e45ga; nor has it a greater resemblance to\nanything else. In the other modern building is the image called P\u0101lta, exceedingly worn by\nthe lapse of ages, and the features totally obliterated. It represents the goddess destroying\na man who has sprung from the truncated neck of a buffalo, so common in the monuments of\nthe sect of Buddha in Bih\u0101r. Before the two modern temples, at the limits of the ancient\nbuilding, is a tree, under which are portions of two broken li\u1e45gas. At each Dasahra there is an\nassembly (the P\u0101lta Devi fair above mentioned.)\nAbout four or five miles east from Mahadewa I saw two elevations somewhat like the ruins attributed to the Thar\u00fas, but containing fewer bricks. They were called Trupasandh\u00ed and Trupasandh\u00ed-k\u00e1-Jh\u00faga, the latter word signifying a grove; for the ruin is covered with trees. On this latter is a small conical heap of bricks, which has evidently been a temple; and on its ruin have been placed two ling\u00e1s, which it probably once contained. On Trupasandh\u00ed, or the high place of the worshipper of three gods, there are in fact three ling\u00e1s placed under a tree. They are exceedingly weather-worn, and one of them, on the side of the phallus, has a human face. Besides these there are many fragments.\n\nThere are the ruins of some petty forts, erected by various rajas and thieves, especially one at Musharifa, about two miles from Mahadewa, which was a stronghold of the Banj\u00e1ra tribe, when these predatory merchants were in the habit of plundering B\u00e9n\u00e1si.\n\nB\u00e1rakuni, hamlet of Sunh\u00e1n a village, in tappa Seobakhri of parganah Mahauli and tahsil Basti, is noticeable only as the site of a third-class police station. It lies 24 miles south-south-east of Basti, and had in 1872 a population of 534 souls.\n\nBasti, the capital of the district, stands in north latitude 26\u00b0 49' and east longitude 82\u00b0 44', 112 miles by rail and road from Benares. It is the chief town not only of the district but of tahsil Basti, parganah Basti, and tappa Haveli. Its site has an area of 127 acres, with a population of 40 to the acre. Its inhabitants amounted in 1872 to 5,087 persons, of whom 3,723 were Hind\u00fas (1,660 females) and 1,361 were Musalm\u00e1ns (619 females). But as the people of Basti muster less than 10,000, the census report leaves their occupations undetailed. In 1847, 1853, and 1865, when they mustered less than 5,000, even their numbers are not mentioned.\n\nThe mud-built town of Basti stands on a site but little raised above the low green rice-lands which surround it. It consists chiefly of the old entrenched village whose citadel was the still existing castle of the raja. The fortifications of this village were constructed in much the same manner as those of a Roman camp. A square whose sides measured each about half a mile was enclosed within a wide ditch, and the earth dug from this excavation was thrown up on its inner side to form a wall or bank. The bank now appears as a weatherbeaten mound of varying height, but no value for the prevention of ingress or egress; while the ditch is a stagnation of broken margin and varying width. Thus the town is still surrounded by water, which is broadest on the eastern side. Near this eastern side, moreover, lies a rice-fringed lagoon. The site is not, on the whole, one which would have been chosen by a medical committee.\n\nMahadewa or Mahdewa of tappa Aikhin was in Buchanan's time the headquarters of a police circle named Dhuliya-Bhandar. Or rather a brushwood thicket. The details of this distance are these:\u2014By rail from Benares to Akbarpur, 84 miles; by road from Akbarpur to Basti, 28; total, 112. Another and longer route is as follows:\u2014By rail from Benares to Faizabad, 120 miles; by road from Faizabad to Basti, 40; total, 160.\nThrough the east of that site runs, wide and straight, a metalled road. This is merely the end of a branch which connects the town with the more southerly Gorakhpur and Faizabad highway; but it supplies Basti with a high street. Well raised and drained, and crossing the surrounding ditch on bridges, it is flanked on either side by houses which are chiefly shops. None of these houses is brick-built, and the great majority are one-storied. But their raised earthen floors and tiled roofs, with a few double-storied buildings of the same kind intermixed, give this street an appearance of neatness which is not encountered in other parts of the town. Off it Basti becomes a mass of crowded hovels which differs in no respect from an ordinary village. Even on the main road itself the only spot which suggests the idea of a brisk trade is the Chauk, or crossing where four roads meet. This is used as a marketplace on Tuesdays and Saturdays; and in its neighbourhood are most of the few good wells which the town can boast. The water in the Basti wells rises to within some 10 or 11 feet of the surface, but is seldom sweet enough for healthy drinking.\\(^1\\) It is almost a case of \"water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drink.\"\n\nFrom the statement that the main road passes through the east of the town it may be inferred that most of the houses lie west of that highway. And this western portion of Basti is, like that of London, the most aristocratic quarter. Here stands, high-raised and strongly built, the castle (kot) of the raja. Covering almost the whole of the mound which it adorns, it occupies about 4 acres of ground. It is girt on all sides save the east by one of those thick and lofty quickset hedges of male bambu\\(^2\\) which once formed so impenetrable a barrier round all the baronial strongholds of the district. Outside all lies a ditch which is never very poor in water. The building has a picturesque frontage, with a steep entrance-way rising to the main gate; while opposite this fa\u00e7ade is a small open plain, used as a picket for the wealthy owner's elephants, horses, and cattle. Elsewhere in the town are several other breathing-holes of the same kind. Adjoining the castle is the Paithan-tola quarter, a widespread congergy of poor mud houses which has a little bazar of its own.\n\nEast of the main road the only building that need be mentioned is the old hostelry (sarai). This is a large quadrangle of the usual untidy type, but shaded within by some good trees. The main road is met at its north-eastern end by the unmetalled lines from Menhdawal, Banshi, and Domariaganj. On its south-western exit from the town it travels on through Nay\u00e1 B\u00e1zar to the civil station.\n\n\\(^1\\) Sanitary Commissioner's Report, 1870.  \n\\(^2\\) Dend rocalamus strictus.\nNaya Baz\u00e1r or Newmarket, so called in contradistinction to the old Basti just described, is a modern growth of shops and other buildings which has sprung up along the road on the lands of 5 different villages. On the same highway, between the town and the civil-station, stand the central (sadr) dispensary and the new hostelry. The former was once the tahsild\u00e1r's office; the latter is a large masonry building, greatly frequented by travellers passing through Basti on their way to or from Faizabad.\n\nThe civil station clusters around the point where the road just mentioned joins the Gorakhpur-Faizabad line. The site is on the lands of Amhat village, some three miles south-west of the town; and, being well-raised, drains readily towards the neighbouring Ku\u00e1na. The station crowns, in fact, the slope which rises north-eastwards from that river; and the name of Machhova, sometimes borne by the latter, is perhaps suggestive of the excellent fishing with which its flowing waters provide the European residents. Of European dwellings there are some half-dozen only, but more are hardly required. There are also a church, a library, and a swimming-bath. The principal public buildings are the court, office, and treasury of the magistrate-collector; the court where the judge of Gorakhpur holds occasional sessions; a large tahsild\u00e1r\u00ed; the central post-office; the tahs\u00edli school; the district jail; the staging bungalow; and the Government opium store-house, which lies east of the station. This European quarter is fairly planted with mahua and mango-trees. Indeed, the name of Amhat probably means mango-market.\n\nThe public institutions, not hitherto mentioned, are the two parganah schools in Old Basti and Naya Baz\u00e1r respectively; and the imperial post-office, the mun\u00edfa court, the first-class police-station, and two Anglo-vernacular schools, all in the former.\n\nBasti has no important manufactures. It is at best little more than the market-town of an agricultural tract. It has no municipality, no house-tax under Act V. of 1861. But it has for many years possessed a fine roadway; and a fine roadway is the beginning of improvement in all our North-Western towns. Like other mud-built settlements, Old Basti is disfigured by many stagnant waterholes, which have been dug to supply material for its dwellings. But these excavations can be filled in, and further buildings erected, with earth from the old embankment which surrounds the town. And improvements of this nature have been in progress for years.\nThe original village perhaps owed its first promotion to its selection as the seat of its first r\u0101ja. This event probably took place at some time in the seventeenth century. As the capital of the new principality Basti obtained an importance which it has never since lost. When, on its cession to the British (1801), it ceased being the capital of a principality, it became the capital of a tab\u1e63\u012bl. But, if still important, Basti was neither rich nor beautiful. Buchanan some years afterwards (1813) describes it as \"more sorry than any place of the size in the (Gorakhpur-Basti) district;\" and its people as seeming \"in the most abject state of poverty.\" He adds that the town then contained 500 houses, of which 110 were two-storied and two were built partly of brick. One of these two last was \"the very sorry mud-walled castle\" of the r\u0101ja. The mud wall of the village itself appears to have been supplemented by a bambu hedge which has since disappeared. For some time before the Great Rebellion (1857) Basti had been the site of an opium storehouse and treasury, which was guarded by a detachment of native infantry. But the place did not attain its present leading position until eight years later (1865), when it was chosen as the headquarters of the newly-established district. Since then it has steadily grown, both in population and in general importance.\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile south of the town, at Manhan, is a ruin attributed to the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. It consists of a heap of rubbish about 200 yards in diameter, irregular in form and surface, and without any trace of a ditch. Tradition says that its summit was once hallowed by a phallic emblem (linga) of Shiva; but this had, even before Buchanan's time, disappeared. Some three-quarters of a mile north-east of Old Basti, in Lakhnaura village, rises another mound of reputed Th\u00e1ru origin. \"It may,\" writes the author just mentioned, \"be 300 yards in diameter, but (is) of very little elevation; whether from having originally consisted of a number of small buildings, or from many of the bricks having been removed, I cannot say.\" About 1,000 yards beyond this, in Barwa village, is another ruin assigned to founders of the same race. \"Its diameter is smaller, but the elevation is more considerable, although it contains more earth than usual. On it is a linga very much decayed. About two miles beyond this, north and east, is another ruin called Arel, and attributed to the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. It is about 300\n\n---\n\n1 The first r\u0101ja of Basti seems to have flourished ten generations after his ancestor Sej, whose date may be placed about the middle of the fourteenth century (supra, p. 678). And ten generations may be set down as equalling something over 300 years. Had the Basti principality, moreover, been founded before the end of the sixteenth century, parganah Basti would probably have appeared in the Ain-i-Akbari under its present name and not under that of Mandwa.\nyards in diameter, but is higher than (that of) Lakhnanra. Some deep and large excavations have been made into it, probably in search of bricks.\"\n\nBasti, a tahsil with head-quarters at the place just described, is bounded on east-by-south by tahsil Khalfabad; on north-by-west by tahsils Bansi and Domariaganj; on west-by-north by the Haraia tahsil; and on south-south-west by the Ghagra, which divides it from the Faizabad district. Tahsil Basti contains the eastern parts of parganahs Nagar (7 tappas) and Basti (7); the north-western corner of parganah Maghar (3); and the western portion of parganah Mahauli (10). It had in 1878 a total area of 350,009 acres, or nearly 547 square miles; and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,82,738. Its population in 1872 was 313,327, or 571 persons to the square mile. But a detailed account of the tahsil will be found in the articles on its four parganahs.\n\nBasti or Mansurnagar-Basti, a parganah of the Basti and Haraia tahsils, is bounded on the east-north-east by parganah Maghar, a border being supplied by the Katnebia watercourse and its affluent, the Garehia; on the north-north-west by parganah Rasulpur and the Gonda district; on west-south-west by parganah Amorha; and on the south by parganahs Nagar and Mahauli, the boundary with the former being supplied chiefly by the Kuna river and its affluent the Rawai. The parganah is divided into 11 tappas. Of these the seven eastern\u2014Kothila, Umrah, Paria, Karar, Haveli, Deoragon and Sikan darpur\u2014belong to the Basti tahsil; the four western\u2014Shiupur-Gopalgur, Atroh, Ratanpur, and Hardi\u2014belong to the tahsil Haraia. Basti contains 926 estates (mahal), almost coinciding with the same number of villages (mauzas); and of these 578 lie in the Basti tahsil. The parganah had in 1878 an area of 181,389 acres, or nearly 283\u00bd square miles; and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,54,977. Of the former just over 171 square miles, and of the latter Rs. 98,185, belong to the Basti tahsil.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 Basti contained 796 inhabited sites, of which 507 had less than 200 inhabitants; 241 between 200 and 500; 43 between 500 and 1,000; and 6 between 1,000 and 2,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants was Basti, with a population of 5,087.\n\nThe population numbered 168,893 souls (90,225 females), giving 1,181 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 150,594 Hindus, of whom 70,224 were females; 18,295 Musalmans (8,443 females); and 4 Christians. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 20,205 Brahmins (9,440 females); 5,534 Rajputs (2,465 females); and 4,464 Baniyas (2,053 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 120,391 souls.\nThe principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (15,126), Kanaujia (188), Gaur (218), Gautam (46), Shukul, Mah\u00e1r\u00e1sht, and San\u00e1dh. The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Ponw\u00e1r (55), Bais (1,211), Gautam (348), Parw\u00e1r (350), Chauh\u00e1n (97), S\u00farajbansi (95), Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j (212), Raghubansi (273), Rajkum\u00e1r, Kulh\u00e1ns, Sakarw\u00e1r, Bachgoti, R\u00e1thor, Sarwar, and Kharog clans; the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (62), Kassaudhan (2,742), K\u00e1ndu (109). Agarahri (1,112), Panw\u00e1r, and Bandarw\u00e1r sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (3,982), Kah\u00e1r (4,012), Kurmi (23,940), Teli (3,174), Dhobi (3,166), N\u00e1i (2,316), Cham\u00e1r (27,428), Ah\u00edr (16,439), Barhai (3,037), Loh\u00e1r (1,739), K\u00e1yath (2,378), Khewat (1,487), Tamboli (2,488), Kalw\u00e1r (1,048), Khatik (1,437), Kumbh\u00e1r (3,465), Ch\u00e1i (2,703), M\u00e1li (2,997) and Nuniya (2,164). The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Gadariya, Dhark\u00e1r, B\u00e1ri, At\u00edt, Son\u00e1r, Manih\u00e1r, Bharbh\u00fanja, Koeri, Gos\u00e1in, Bair\u00e1gi, P\u00e1si, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Thathera, Koli, Lodha, Halw\u00e1i, Patwa, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1rhi, Arakh, Rangwa, Musahar, Kam\u00e1ngar, Tarkhar, Baisw\u00e1r, and Bhartiya. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (1,833), Path\u00e1ns (1,828), Sayyids (100), Mughals (47), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age) 427 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 3,339 to the domestic class, which includes servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 587 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 42,508 to the agricultural class; and 2,615 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 3,353 persons returned as labourers and 346 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 15,877 as landholders, 119,178 as cultivators, and 33,838 as engaged in occupations unconnected with the agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 538 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 90,225 souls.\n\nThe parganah is an alluvial and fairly fertile champaign, sloping imperceptibly towards the south-east. Shaded by many a sombre grove, it has, nevertheless, no woodland of sufficient continuity to be called a forest. In such a tract we should expect\n\nOf the extensive forest which in 1813 skirted the banks of the Ku\u00e1na little remains save the mahua trees. But even in 1813 this woodland is described as consisting largely of plantations that had run wild. The so-called forest grant of Hardi, in the tappa bearing that name, is now a great expanse of cultivation. Its area is over 13,000 acres. But for some account of such grants see pp. 286-88.\nthe chief natural features to be the rivers and lagoons, the chief artificial feature a high state of cultivation. And in Basti this expectation would be verified.\n\nThe principal river is the Ku\u00e1na, which flows south-south-eastwards across the whole breadth of the parganah. Its high and abrupt banks are throughout Basti fringed by a narrow belt of brushwood and trees. Steep also are the banks of the Raw\u00e1i, which, after an east-south-easterly course through the parganah and along its southern frontier, joins the Ku\u00e1na. The Garehia, a narrow channel in the centre of a broad depression, runs south-eastwards along the Maghar boundary. It at length joins the Katnehia, whose waters wander in the same direction to form the same border. Issuing from the Jasoia lagoon, between tappas \u00damr\u00e4h and Sikandarpur, this Katnehia is the only one of all the streams here mentioned which rises in Basti itself. Save only the Ku\u00e1na, whose bed lies too much below the level of the surrounding country, all these rivers are a fertile source of irrigation.\n\nThe same may be said of the lagoons, whereof the chief are Bhuila in tappa Atroh; Aila in tappa Shi\u00fapur; Saraini in tappa Kothila; Jasoia, Dudhrfs, and Pharendia in tappa \u00damr\u00e4h; Hasanpur and Kanethu-Buzurg in tappa Sikandarpur; Rasna, Majhaua, Jagat, and Bhartpur in tappa Paria; Karar-khas, T\u00e1l-khara, and T\u00e1l-Balaur in tappa Karar; and Nari\u00e1on, \u00darw\u00e1ra, Jokaila, Sengranula, and Mahdeo in tappa Haveli. But rivers and lagoons are not the only reservoirs which moisten and refresh the fields. The average depth of water is less than 10 feet from the surface; the soil favours the construction of wells; and at the land-assessment 2,845 of such excavations were found in working order. Of the total cultivated area, 118,146 acres, 95,773 were returned as irrigated.\n\nHere as elsewhere the soils are divided into clay, sand, and that loam which is a compound of both. The tappas east of the Ku\u00e1na, those in the Basti tahsil, have for the most part a loamy surface; but in some, as for instance in tappa \u00damr\u00e4h, fine clay-lands are often encountered. The Haraia or west-Ku\u00e1na tappas have a lighter and more sandy mould. Of the cultivated area 76,258 acres are recorded as tilled for the spring and 36,799 acres for the autumn harvest. Roughly noting in thousands of acres the space occupied by the principal crops of the former season, we get the following results:\u2014Wheat, 24\u00bd; peas, 12\u00bd; arhar pulse, 8\u00bd; linseed, 6; sugarcane, 4\u00bd; and barley, 4. Marked in the same manner, the chief autumn crops stand thus:\u2014Rice, 26\u00bd; and urd pulse, 4\u00bd. Of the more valuable agricultural staples cotton and indigo are unknown. The prejudice against the latter, which in\n1865 was still sparsely cultivated, seemed chiefly due to the \"inquisitorial interference\" of factory subordinates whose employers had granted advances for its growth. Poppy, which at the spring harvest covers an area next greatest to that of barley, is described as \"a mine of wealth to the parganah.\" How large the acreage occupied by sugarcane has been already shown. The owners of the soil are chiefly R\u00e1jputs, Br\u00e1hmans, and K\u00e1yaths.\n\nThe principal markets at which the grain of the parganah finds a sale are the district capital Basti, Deor\u00e1on, and Mans\u00farnagar.\n\nEconomical features. Being on the banks of the Ku\u00e1na river, writes Mr. P. J. White, \"Deor\u00e1on does a brisker export and import trade than Basti, which is more of a central market. From Deor\u00e1on grain is extensively exported by water to Gola-Gop\u00e1lpur\\(^1\\) on the Gh\u00e1ghra; and it receives thence, in return, all the usual native articles of luxury and necessity, excepting coarse cloth which is manufactured by Jul\u00e1h\u00e1s (Muslim weavers) in the parganah.\" The smaller marts are Bhair\u00faganj of tappa Hardi; Kusama and S\u00edswa in tappa Haveli; Sonaha and Kotheli of tappa Kothila; Majhaua-M\u00edr of tappa Paria; Sultaua and S\u00e1hi\u00faganj in tappa Sik\u00e1ndarpur; Mahu\u00e1dabar of tappa Atroh; and Kesr\u00e1i, Belgh\u00e1t, Tendna, Pagargh\u00e1t, Kachia, and Chhatra of tappa Shi\u00fapur. The four last named are modern foundations. But all these minor markets, whether old or new, open twice weekly. To them the villagers of the neighbourhood bring cotton, thread, tobacco, salt, vegetables, coarse cloth, ornaments and toys. A casual huckster sometimes appears with metal utensils. But at each place the main trade is the grain-trade, conducted by from 10 to 20 corn-chandlers. Several yearly fairs cause an occasional outflash of petty trade in places where at most times even petty trade is unknown. A large gathering of this kind takes place at Ajudhy\u00e1 gh\u00e1t on the Ku\u00e1na, beside a temple sacred to Shiva as Lord of Hardw\u00e1r (Hardw\u00e1rn\u00e1th). The assemblage is held on the full moon of Chait (March-April); and, like the great fair at Hardw\u00e1r itself, has sometimes been disturbed by outbreaks of cholera. Of manufactures deserving the name the parganah has absolutely none. Its principal road is the metalled highway from Gorakhpur to Faizabad, passing through Basti; but on Basti converge, chiefly from the north, several good unmetalled lines. Starting from Bh\u00e1nipur in Ras\u00falpur, another road of the latter class passes south-westwards, by Mans\u00farnagar and Paikaulia, to meet that first named at Bikramjot in Amorha. The Ku\u00e1na provides the tract with a small but central water-route.\n\n\\(^{1}\\) Supra, pp. 488-89.\nFrom its aboriginal Dom or half-aboriginal Domkatar masters parganah Basti seems to have been wrested in the fourteenth century by Kulhans Rajputs. For long an integral portion of the Kulhans principality of Gonda, it was at length granted to a cadet of the ruling house, the ancestor of the present raja of Basti. But towards the end of the sixteenth century it fell under the superior power of the Dehli emperors. In the Domesday-Book (1596) of Akbar it is entered as Mandwa, a part of the Gorakhpur district (dastar), Gorakhpur division (sarkar), and Oudh province (sitba). About 1720, when the power of Dehli had declined, their viceroy in this Oudh province assumed independence; and Basti continued under its new masters until 1801, when ceded by them to the British. It was now placed in the Gorakhpur district, of which it remained part until severed in 1865 to form with other parganahs the new district of Basti. Meanwhile it had been assessed with the following land-revenues:\u2014Rs. 29,741 in 1803; Rs. 28,533 in 1806; Rs. 28,425 in 1809; Rs. 43,061 in 1813; Rs. 1,02,855 in 1840; and Rs. 1,49,115 in 1865.\n\nThe rather insignificant antiquities of Basti have been described in the article on that town. The only other remains mentioned by Buchanan are those beside the Bhuila lagoon, some 15 miles west of Basti. Attributed as usual to the Tharus, they consist of a roundish heap of brick debris, some 1,200 yards in circumference, but of trifling elevation. \"The tops of the walls of several chambers may be traced on a level with the present surface, and these probably show that the building has been a house and not a temple, as the chambers are small. On the south side of the heap, adjacent to a tank nearly obliterated, there projects from the rubbish about 2\u00bd feet of an octagonal stone pillar, much weather-worn and having its sides alternately wider and narrower. It is called Sivawa, and is considered an object of worship. On a small heap of rubbish between the above-mentioned tank, the great ruin and the marshy lake are two places of worship. One, dedicated to an anonymous Muhammadan martyr (Bhuila Shahid), has no tomb; but images of potter's ware are placed under a tree to obtain his favour. The other is a linga (phallus) called the Bhuilesvar. North from the great heap are two smaller ones quite detached, but at a small distance.\n\n\"The Kulhans Rajputs, who now hold the country, had built about 100 forts, many of which had gone to ruin when Major Rutledge (Mr. Collector Routledge) destroyed the remainder. The chief seat of the tribe, in the woods about 7 kos (14 miles) north-west of Basti, was called Salanagar; but the Muhammadans changed its name into Mansurnagar, in honour of Mansur Ali.\"\nKh\u00e1n, father of Shuj\u00e1-ud-daula and vaz\u00edr of the empire.\u201d Buchanan goes on to describe this Mans\u00farnagar, which gives the pargana to its first name, as entirely deserted. It has since then been repeopled; and is now, as already mentioned, one of the principal markets in the tract.\n\nBelwa Bazar is a flourishing mart on the lands of Hanum\u00e1npur village in tappa Belwa of parganah Amorha and tahsil Haraia. Situated near the point where the metalled Gorakhpur and Faizabad road meets the Gh\u00e1gra, it stands some 28 miles west of Basti. The population amounted in 1872 to 757 persons only. But Belwa has a fourth-class police-station and some commercial importance. The market, which stands on land confiscated after the mutiny, is leased to the r\u00e1ja of Basti. Hither is brought, for export across or down the Gh\u00e1gra, nearly all the surplus grain of the surrounding parganahs. By the same river are imported brass vessels from Mirz\u00e1pur and cloth from the towns of Bengal. From Nep\u00e1l come by road iron, copper, vessels of those metals, spices, ginger, and turmeric. By road too, through Oudh, carts bring the raw cotton which has been collected at Kanauj and Cawnpore.\n\nBhadesar, a village in tappa Deor\u00e1on of parganah and tahsil Basti, is remarkable only as the scene of a large yearly fair. This takes place in February-March, lasts several days, and has an estimated attendance of 6,000 visitors. But the village, which is 4 miles south-south-west of Basti, had in 1872 a permanent population of 232 persons only.\n\nBh\u00e1npur, a village in tappa Chhapia of parganah Ras\u00falpur and tahsil Domariaganj, is remarkable only as the site of a tahs\u00edli school. Standing on the junction of two unmetalled roads, 19 miles north-north-west of Basti, it in 1872 had 930 inhabitants. The villagers hold market every Monday. This Bh\u00e1npur must not be confused with that other market-village which gives its name to tappa Bh\u00e1npur in the same parganah.\n\nBhari, in tappa Sagara of parganah Ras\u00falpur and tahsil Domariaganj, lies 28 miles north north-west of Basti; and had in 1872 only 539 inhabitants. But it must be noticed for the same reason as the place last named. It has a tank which is celebrated as one of Krishna\u2019s favourite bathing-places; and hereby is held, in the end of October-November (K\u00e1rtik), a fair which boasts some 50,000 attendants. The gathering lasts for about a fortnight. During its continuance the waterside is crowded with the booths of pedlars, confectioners, and other dealers in cheap trifles. But the ostensible object of the fair is the ceremonial bathing (ashn\u00e1n) which takes place on the full moon of the month.\nThe tank retains its shape too well to claim an antiquity of very many centuries. But beside it rises, to a height of some 18 feet above the surrounding plain, a mound of ruins; and if Mr. Wynne is right in calling these the d\u00e9bris of successive temples, Bh\u00e1ri must be a place of ancient sanctity. Around the mound are several smaller tanks and the remains of several detached buildings. The mound itself is a large heap of brick rubbish. Irregular in form and surface, it extends some 400 yards from north to south and some 350 from east to west. It \"has evidently been,\" writes Buchanan, \"a very large house, palace or castle, with several small tanks encroaching on the sides, but no traces of a ditch.\" The full name of the place is Bharat-bh\u00e1ri; that is, according to the villagers, the enclosure (b\u00e1ri) of Bharat, the brother of R\u00e1ma. But the towns-men of Domarir\u00e1ganj told the writer just quoted that the eponymous hero was a Th\u00e1ru called Bharatbh\u00e1ri.\n\nBin\u00e1yakpur, the smallest parganah of the district and the B\u00e1nsi tahsil, is sometimes, to distinguish it from its namesake in Gorakhpur, called Bin\u00e1yakpur West. Occupying the north-eastern corner of the district, it is itself bounded on the north-east by Nep\u00e1l; on the north-west, west, and south-south-west by parganah B\u00e1nsi; and on the south-east by the river Gh\u00fanghi, which severs it from the Gorakhpur district. Bin\u00e1yakpur has two tappas\u2014the northern named Bh\u00e1timp\u00e1r, the southern Netw\u00e1r or Nitw\u00e1l. It is divided into 107 estates (mah\u00e1l), coinciding as a rule with the revenue divisions known as villages (mauzu). It had in 1878 an area of 31,064 acres, or over 48\u00bd square miles; and a land-revenue of Rs. 17,470. But though recognized in fiscal and other documents as a separate parganah, Bin\u00e1yakpur is practically part of parganah B\u00e1nsi, and with it forms one great parganah-tahsil.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, Bin\u00e1yakpur contained 110 inhabited sites, of which 80 had less than 200 inhabitants; 26 between 200 and 500; 3 between 500 and 1,000; and one between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\nThe population numbered 21,023 souls (9,850 females), giving 429 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 18,865 Hind\u00fas, of whom 8,834 were females; and 2,158 Musalm\u00e1ns (1,016 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shews 1,945 Br\u00e1hmans (951 females); 370 R\u00e1jputs (164 females); and 741 Baniy\u00e1s (365 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 15,809 souls (7,354 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-division found in this parganah is the Sarwaria (348). The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Bais (173) and Kulh\u00e1ns clans; the Baniy\u00e1s to the\nKasaundhan (33), K\u00e1ndu (291), and Agarahri (120) sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Kurmi (1,150), Cham\u00e1r (2,465), Ahfr (1,273), Lodha (1,615), and R\u00e1jbhar (1,470). The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Bhar, Kah\u00e1r, Teli, Dhobi, N\u00e1i, Gadariya, Barhai, Loh\u00e1r, K\u00e1yath, Khewat, Tamboli, Kalw\u00e1r, Dhark\u00e1r, Khatk, Kumbh\u00e1r, B\u00e1ri, Atit, Ch\u00e1i, M\u00e1li, Sun\u00e1r, Nun\u00eda, Bharbhunja, Koeri, Gos\u00e1in, Bair\u00e1gi, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Koli, Halw\u00e1i, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1ri, Arakh, Bind, and Musahar. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (624), Path\u00e1ns (392), Mughals (48), Sayyids (34), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 29 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 199 to the domestic class, which includes servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 96 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 5,487 to the agricultural class; and 316 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 522 persons returned as labourers and 48 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 771 as landholders, 17,392 as cultivators, and 2,860 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 34 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 11,173 souls.\n\nLying in the Tar\u00e1i, in the great Sub-Him\u00e1layan marshland, Bin\u00e1yakpur is both flat and fenny. Its geographical features are less pronounced than those of its Gorakhpur namesake on the east and of B\u00e1hsi on the west. Though both moist and feverish, it is neither so moist nor so feverish as they. Like them it is well-wooded, but unlike them it has no regular forest. A fringe of spontaneous scrubwood still indeed skirts the south-south-western border; and in tappa Bh\u00e1-timp\u00e1r is a large forest grant (Dulha) of over 3,600 acres. But the former is not tall or continuous; and the latter, like most other holdings of the same nature, is now an almost unbroken expanse of cultivation. Cleared has been the stretch of fine timber which in 1813 decked the east of the parganah. That parganah\u2019s only plantations are fine and frequent mango-groves, the sure sign of a prosperous neighbourhood, but not, as Mr. Wynne opined, \u201ca waste of valuable land.\u201d\n\n1 Supra, pp. 473-74. 2 Supra, pp. 286-88.\nFrom the mountains some 15 miles distant on the north, or from springs in the intervening morasses, several streams flow rapidly past the north-eastern border. The Til\u00e1r bounds the parganah on its north-western and part of its western frontier; the Gh\u00fanghi on its south-eastern. The Tinawa flows westward across it to join the Til\u00e1r; while the Hagni runs through the south-eastern skirt of the tract almost parallel to the Gh\u00fanghi. Like many other sub-Him\u00e1layan streams, that last named has silted its bed up till now it flows, in places, above the level of the surrounding country. The parganah has a fair number of lagoons, but not so many in proportion to its area as B\u00e1nsi. Both rivers and lagoons are to some small extent utilized in irrigation, the former being dammed for that purpose. But the soil is by nature so moist that little watering is required. Of the total cultivated area, 19,121 acres, only 6,903 were at assessment returned as irrigated.\n\nThe soils and crops of Bin\u00e1yakpur are those already mentioned in the article on B\u00e1nsi. But the bh\u00e1t clay and the winter-rice which grows thereon here predominate more easily than in that parganah. If invidious comparisons need be drawn between the two tappas, Bh\u00e1timp\u00e1r is slightly less fertile than Nitwal. The principal proprietors of the former are the money-lending Shukul Br\u00e1hmans of B\u00fara and Khairauti; and of the latter, the Kulh\u00e1ns R\u00e9jputs of Ekdinga and Lautan.\n\nThe place last named is the only town or mart of the least importance.\n\nEconomical features. The only road, that on which Lautan stands, is merely an unmetalled line passing through the south-eastern corner of the parganah. The crops which are the one great product of Bin\u00e1yakpur find their way by cross-country tracks to the several villages where weekly markets are held. And hence the surplus stocks are exported, via Lautan, to Uska and other marts of adjoining parganahs. The absence of any manufactures deserving the name is inevitable in an agricultural tract which possesses no large towns.\n\nBin\u00e1yakpur is the fragment of an ancient and much larger parganah which, until the adjustment of boundaries (1816) after the Nep\u00e1lese wars, extended northwards to B\u00fatwal at the foot of the hills. The history of this tract and of the B\u00fatwal r\u00e1jas who ruled it has been told in the article on parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur East,\u00b9 but a few local details remain to be added. The eponymous village of Bin\u00e1yakpur is not in Basti or Gorakhpur, and must therefore be in Nep\u00e1l. During the last century constant struggles between the r\u00e1jas of B\u00e1nsi and B\u00fatwal laid waste the debateable\n\n\u00b9 Supra, pp. 474-75.\nland between this parganah and its larger sister of the same tahsil. In 1864 the frontier tappas are described as having only lately, and that not entirely, recovered. When it became British territory (1801), Binayakpur West was at once assessed with a small land-revenue; and did not, like its eastern namesake, remain exempt from taxation till the fourth assessment. The amounts imposed on the parganah at successive revisions of assessment were: Rs. 382 in 1803; the same in 1806; Rs. 679 in 1809; in 1813 Rs. 1,602; Rs. 10,613 in 1840; and in 1864, Rs. 16,020. The lightness of the demand at the earlier settlement was due to the fact that Binayakpur was then an almost unbroken forest. But even when the current assessment was framed it was deemed inadvisable to exact as revenue half the rental.\n\nThe only antiquities mentioned by Buchanan are a few ruined castles whose ruins must ere now have almost disappeared.\n\nBirdpur, a village in tappa Ghos of parganah and tahsil Bansri, stands beside the unmetalled road from Basti and Bansri to Nep\u00e1l, 57 miles north-north-east of the former town. Not far west of the village runs a little water-course called the Mekra, an affluent of the Jamw\u00e1r; and not far south a second unmetalled road crosses that first mentioned. In 1847 the inhabitants were returned as numbering over 7,500; in 1853 as over 11,700; in 1865 as over 13,600; and in 1872 as over 17,500. But in each case these startling results were obtained by confusing the village with its enclosing forest grant.\n\nThe village has a branch dispensary and an European dwelling-house belonging to Mr. Pepp\u00e9. He and others are lessees of the forest-grant just mentioned, whereof Birdpur is the headquarters. Leased in 1840 to Messrs. W. Gibbon and J. Clock, this grant has an area of 29,316 acres, or nearly 46 square miles. It has now been almost cleared of forest, and when the lease expires, in 1890, will probably boast but few trees save those of its fruit-groves. On the estate, in the neighbourhood of Birdpur itself, are some fine private irrigation channels.\n\nBirdpur was named after Mr. R. M. Bird, perhaps the most famous revenue official of these provinces, who in 1828 became first commissioner of the Gorakhpur division. About two years ago, when schemes were on foot for reducing the great size of the Gorakhpur district, it was proposed to make the place the capital of a new collectorate which should include the northern parganahs of both Gorakhpur and Basti. But this project may be now considered as finally abandoned.\n\n1 This Gorakhpur division survived till 1834 only, when the commissioner's headquarters were transferred to Ghazipur. In 1842 they were again removed to Benares.\nBISKOHAR, a flourishing mart in tappa Budhi of parganah B\u00e1nsi and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, stands on an unmetalled road or cart-track, 50 miles north-north-west of Basti. About a mile south-west of the place itself the frontiers of parganahs B\u00e1nsi and Ras\u00falpur meet that of the Gonda district. The population of Biskohar varies greatly, being largest during the trading season of winter; but by the census of 1872 was returned as 2,839.\n\nBiskohar has a district post-office. The Chaukid\u00e1ri Act (V. of 1861) is in force here; and during 1878-79 the house-tax thereby imposed, together with a balance of Rs. 176 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 897. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 264) and conservancy (Rs. 120), amounted to Rs. 419. In the same year the town contained 618 houses, whereof 162 were assessed with the tax; the incidence being Rs. 4-7-1 per house assessed and annas 4 per head of population.\n\nBut it is as an entrep\u00f4t for the Nep\u00e1l trade that Biskohar is chiefly remarkable. The imports which pass through it, for distribution to other places in British territory, consist chiefly of unhulled rice, wheat and other grains; drugs and spices; fibres and fibre manufactures; copper coinage and iron; oilseeds, clarified butter, timber, hides and blankets. The exports which through it find their way to Nep\u00e1l are cotton-twist, cotton-stuffs, cocoanuts, hardware, sugar, and tobacco. The business of Biskohar is, however, far smaller than it was before the Nep\u00e1lese placed on trade with British territory those vexatious restrictions which have been above described.\u00b9 Up to the autumn of 1861, writes Mr. Wynne, there were hardly ever less than from 300 to 400 hillmen encamped in the neighbouring grove. But the establishment just afterwards of certain privileged marts in the Nep\u00e1lese Tar\u00e1i, and the prohibition against trading through any other emporia, dealt a serious blow to the prosperity of the town. Many of the Biskohar tradesmen are forced to take houses in the Nep\u00e1lese marts by the fact that, if they do not, their merchandise is on its way through those marts taxed at some 25 per cent. above the ordinary rate. But during the rains the marshy and malarious climate of the Tar\u00e1i towns renders them almost uninhabitable; and those merchants who have temporarily shifted their quarters across the frontier gladly reseek their homes at Biskohar. The town is built on lands belonging to some H\u00e1ra\u00b2 R\u00e1jputs, who are the principal proprietors of the tapp\u00e1. The family is a branch of that settled at Mahn\u00e1ni, in tappa Kot of the same parganah.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, pp. 697-703, where the reader will find a detailed account of the Nep\u00e1lese trade in general.\n\u00b2 The H\u00e1ras or Jangh\u00e1ras are a sub-division of the Tomars. But none of these three names appears in the Basti census of 1872.\nBuddhaband or Budhab\u00e1ndh, a village in tappa Uj\u00ed\u00e1r of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khal\u00edlabad, lies 13 miles east of Basti. It had in 1872 but 744 inhabitants; and is noteworthy only as the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\nCaptainganj, or Captain's market, forms part of Rait\u00e1s village, in tappa Naw\u00e1i of parganah Nagar and tahsil Haraia. Standing on the metalled Basti-Faizabad road, 8 miles west-south-west of Basti, Rait\u00e1s had in 1872 a population of 748 souls.\n\nThe place (Captainganj) probably derives its name from the fact that in the first quarter of the century it was a small military station. Until within the last fifteen years it was the headquarters of a munsif and a tahsil. But in 1876, when the tahsild\u00e1r's office was removed to Haraia, and the tahsil renamed after that village, Captainganj began to lose importance. It is now merely the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office. In Buchanan's time it had but 25 shops; and it once more finds itself in about the same commercial position.\n\nChh\u00e1oni, a hamlet of Kh\u00e1nkal\u00e1n village, in tappa Sikandarpur of parganah Amorha and tahsil Haraia, is remarkable only as the site of a first-class police-station. By the police the neighbourhood has long been occupied. The next village Kh\u00e1nmaria, was as early as 1813 the head quarters of a large circle. Standing on the metalled Gorakhpur-Faizabad road, 22 miles west-by-south of Basti, Kh\u00e1nkal\u00e1n had in 1872 a population of 262.\n\nChhapia, which gives its name to the tappa thus called of parganah Ras\u00falpur and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, stands not far west of the unmetalled Basti-B\u00e1nsi road, 25 miles north-north-west of Basti. It is a mere village, which in 1872 had only 191 inhabitants; but must be mentioned as the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\nChhapr\u00e1gh\u00e1t, or Dhanghatta, in tappa Kuchri of parganah Mahauli and tahsil Khal\u00edlabad, is the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office. Here, 45 miles south-east of Basti, an unmetalled road from Menhd\u00e1wal to the Gh\u00e1gra crosses that connecting the Gorakhpur with the Gonda frontier. Dhanghata had in 1872 a population of 609. Chhapr\u00e1gh\u00e1t is, strictly speaking, the name of the landing-place where the Menhd\u00e1wal road reaches the Gh\u00e1gra several miles further south; and this landing-place, again, derives its name from the large village of Chhapra.\n\nChilia or Chilhia, a village in tappa Aikhin of parganah and tahsil B\u00e1nsi, stands on the junction of two unmetalled roads, 50 miles north-north-east of\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, p. 610.\nBasti. It is here noticed as the site of a second-class police-station and a district post-office; but had in 1872 only 969 inhabitants.\n\nDaldalha. See Bankata.\n\nDhebarua gives its name to tappa Dhebarua of parganah Bans\u00ed and tahsil Domariaganj. Standing beside a cart-track, in the fork between Chhagrihwa and Awinda rivers, it is 59 miles north of Basti. Dhebarua had in 1872 a population of 362 only; but is the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\nDomariaganj, the capital of the tahsil so named, is a village of tappa Halaur and parganah Rasulpur. Past it, on the north, flows the Rapti; and round it, on other sides, lie serpentine ponds which were once beds of that river. A good unmetalled road from Basti to Nep\u00e1l passes through the village, crossing the R\u00e1pti by the r\u00e1ja of Bans\u00ed's ferry. Both over the water and south of that village this highway is met by others of a less perfect kind. The distance north-north-west of Basti is 32 miles; the population amounted in 1872 to 1,145 souls.\n\nDomariaganj has a tahs\u00edli, a first-class police-station, and an imperial post-office. It was formerly surrounded, like Basti, with a ditch, a mud rampart, and a hedge of male bambu. In latter times its police-station was fortified. But all traces of these works, the monuments of an age when security was not, are fast disappearing. The place probably derives its name from the Doms or Domkat\u00e1s, who once ruled not only Ras\u00falpur but Gonda.\n\nDomariaganj, a tahsil with head-quarters at the place just described, is bounded on east-south-east by the Bans\u00ed tahsil and on north-north-east by Nep\u00e1l. On its irregular and often protrusive west-north-western border it marches with the Gonda district, and on its south-south-eastern frontier with tahsils Haraia and Basti. Domariaganj contains parganah Ras\u00falpur and the 11 north-western tappas of parganah Bans\u00ed. It had in 1878 a total area of 371,935 acres, or over 581 square miles; and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,65,346. Its population in 1872 was 259,047, or about 445 souls to the square mile. But a detailed account of the tahsil must be sought in the articles on its two parganahs.\n\nDubaulia or Dubauli, a small mart in tappa Dubaulia of parganah Amorha and tahsil Haraia, stands on the unmetalled road between G\u00e1egh\u00e1t and Amorha, 23 miles west-south-west of Basti. It in 1872 had 1,519 inhabitants.\n\nHere are a police outpost and a market, which, being not far from the Gh\u00e1gra, is an entrep\u00f4t for goods embarking on or disembarked from that river. But something more on this subject will be found in the article on parganah Amorha. The market-place was confiscated for the rebellion of its owners in 1857, and is now yearly leased by Government. The shops of Khush\u00e9lganj\nvillage, which adjoins Duhaulia on the west, may perhaps be considered an outlying portion of the same mart.\n\n**Dudhara**, a village in tappa Ujiar of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khalilabad, stands on the unmetalled road between Basti and Menhdawal, 15 miles east-north-east of the former. Its population amounted in 1872 to 903 persons only; but it is remarkable as the site of a second-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\n**Gaeghat**, or the cow\u2019s landing, is a village of tappa Charkaila, parganah Mahuli and tahsil Basti. After passing through it the unmetalled Gorakhpur and Gonda frontier road quits Mahuli and enters parganah Nagar. But not far west of the village this highway is crossed by another of a better class, running southwards from Basti to Tanda in Faizabad. The distance south of Basti is 16 miles. By the census of 1872 the population was 1,689.\n\nGaeghat has a district post-office. But it is noteworthy chiefly as one of those small marts which collect and distribute the merchandise imported or exported by the neighbouring Ghagra river. The amount of grain which passes through it for down-country exportation is considerable.\n\n**Ganeshpur**, which gives its name to tappa Ganeshpur of parganah Nagar and tahsil Haraia, lies near the right bank of the Kuana river, 4 miles west of Basti. It in 1872 had 2,550 inhabitants.\n\nHere markets are held twice weekly; but the place is chiefly remarkable as the head-quarters of a large and almost revenue-free domain known as the Pindari jagir. Comprising the bulk of the tappa, it was originally held by Gautam Rajputs, cadets of the family which supplied the parganah with its rajas. These Gautams fortified Ganeshpur, in the usual manner, with a ditch, a mud wall, and a quickset hedge of male bambu. Such bulwarks enabled them under native rule to hold their own. But under British sway their tenure no longer depended on the sword. They allowed their land-tax to fall into arrears; and to defray the debt Government in 1811-12 sold their domain. It appears to have been bought by Mrs. Fidden, widow of one of those trading civil surgeons who in the early days of the Company\u2019s rule did so much to promote the commercial prosperity of places where they happened to be posted. But Mrs. Fidden found herself unable to manage the property. She therefore either sold it herself, or, by defaulting in the payment of revenue, forced Government to sell it for her. In 1818 it was again sold on account of arrears, due from its then possessor, Bibi Moti Khnam. Now at this time the Company wished to provide for a turbulent cavalier of fortune who had distinguished\n\n---\n\n1 Supra, pp. 679-81, and Eastern India, II., 377.  \n2 Board\u2019s Records, 1811-12.\nhimself during the Marhatta wars; a man whom, though he might have been suppressed with a strong hand, it was cheaper to steady by the gift of a comfortable property. Government itself therefore bought in Ganeshpur for Rs. 8,343 and bestowed it in 1819 on the ex-colonel of Cossacks, the Pindari Kadir Bakhsh. The terms were that he should himself hold it revenue-free; and that his heirs should hold it after him, on payment of a light and never-enhanceable revenue.\\(^1\\) His descendants are still in possession. Their revenue is indeed almost nominal, amounting to Rs. 1,877\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) only. At the assessment of 1865 the settlement officer ruled that they were illegally holding, without additional payment, many villages besides those originally granted. He therefore imposed on their whole domain a revenue of Rs. 10,009\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). But the Pindaris successfully fought their case up to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and as a result of this appeal to Caesar the tax of Rs. 1,877\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) remains unaltered.\n\nHARAIA, the capital of the tahsil so named, lies in tappa Purena of parganah Amorha. Past it, on the south-west, flows the Manaur or Manarama river, which is here crossed by the metalled Basti and Faizabad road. Haraia is 17 miles west-by-south of Basti, and in 1872 had 840 inhabitants.\n\nHere are a tahsil, a second-class police-station, a tahsili school, and an imperial post-office. The present importance of the village dates from 1876, when the tahsil headquarters were removed hither from Captainganj, and the tahsil itself was renamed after Haraia. But, before this, Haraia was not altogether unknown to local commerce. The Manaur river is navigable, and here meets the only first-class road of the district. It results that the village is an emporium where goods passing up the river from the Ghagra, or down the river from the road, have their bulk broken. The principal export is grain; the principal import, cloth.\n\nHARAIA, a tahsil with headquarters at the place just described, is bounded on the east by tahsil Basti; on north-north-west and on west by the Gonda district; on south-west-by-south by the Ghagra, which divides it from the Faizabad district. Tahsil Haraia contains parganah Amorha, with the western tappas (4) of parganah Basti and (5) of parganah Nagar. It had in 1878 a total area of 317,176 acres, or over 495 square miles; and a total land-revenue of Rs. 2,73,203. Its population was in 1872 returned as 305,222, or 618 souls to the square mile. But further details concerning the tahsil must be gathered from the articles on its three parganahs.\n\nHARIHARPUR, a market village of tappa Aorad\u00e1nr, parganah Mahauli and tahsil Khalilabad, stands on the left bank of the Katnebia, about 18 miles\n\n\\(^1\\) Board's Records, 1818-19.\nsouth-east of Basti. It in 1872 had 2,194 inhabitants, and possesses a few good masonry houses. It seems to have formerly been a place of some commercial importance; but its trade, like that of most towns in parganah Mahauli, has waned. Its name, which means the town of Krishna and Shiva, was probably derived from that of some Br\u0101hma\u1e47 who was called Harihar after both divinities. Shiva being the destroying god, and Krishna an incarnation of the saving one, such names serve to propitiate at once two opposing principles.\n\nIntwa, a village in tappa Kot of parganah B\u00e1nsi and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, stands on the crossing of two unmetalled roads, 42 miles north-by-west of Basti. It has a police outpost; but its population amounted in 1872 to 310 only. Though its name seems to mean \"the place of bricks,\" Intwa is a mud built village.\n\nJign\u00e1n, in tappa Kop of parganah B\u00e1nsi and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, lies 46 miles north-by-west of Basti. It had in 1872 only 127 inhabitants, but is remarkable as the scene of a large yearly fair.\n\nThis takes place in November-December, or, as a Hindu would say, on the 5th of the bright half of the month Aghan. It lasts for two days, and its ostensible object is worship at the local Th\u00e1kurdw\u0101ra or shrine of Krishna. But the occasion is a festival connected with another of Vishnu's incarnations, R\u00e1ma. Pilgrims come hither from Ajudhya and less distant places to celebrate the Dh\u00e1nukjug, the feast of the Bow. This, the weapon of the god Shiva, was entrusted to Janaka, king of Mithila; and Janaka had promised his lovely daughter S\u012bta to the suitor who could bend it. Like the bow of Ulysses, it could be bent by but one person, and that was the fortunate R\u00e1ma of Ajudhya.\n\nBut though, as at all Hindu fairs, religion lends an excuse for the meeting, commerce is the real motive that inspires it. Though the festival here lasts but two days, the shop-keepers remain for about a fortnight. The total number of visitors is reckoned at about 35,000.\n\nKalw\u00e1ri, \"the town of distillers,\" is a flourishing little mart in tappa Kalw\u00e1ri of parganah Nagar and tahsil Basti. Through the parish (mausa) passes the unmetalled Gorakhpur and Gonda frontiers road. The distance south-south-west of Basti is 12 miles; the population in 1872 was 8,311.\n\nKalw\u00e1ri has a second-class police-station;\u00b9 but is remarkable chiefly as one of those emporia which, all along the same road, serve as brief resting-places for the merchandise imported or exported by the Gh\u00e1gra. This river flows a few miles distant on east and south. The principal exports are grain and spices; the\n\n\u00b9See note, p. 660.\nprincipal imports, cloths, tobacco, metal utensils, and cotton. But the last-named commodity comes chiefly from across the river, by way of Tanda in Faizabad.\n\nKakrahighat or Kakrahi, a village in tappa Hata of parganah and tahsil Bansi, stands on the junction of the Banganga and Burhi-Rapti rivers, some 37 miles north-north-east of Basti. Below that junction, but still within the village, the unmetalled road from Basti and Bansi to Nepal crosses the water by ferry or ford according to the season.\n\nThe village had in 1872 a population of 175 persons only. But in it an outpost of the Agriculture and Commerce Department registers the very considerable traffic which here passes from or towards Nepal. And Kakrahighat becomes in October-November the scene of a not unimportant fair.\n\nKhaliabad, the capital of the tahsil so named, is a village of tappa Churaib and parganah Maghar. The metalled road from Gorakhpur to Faizabad is here crossed by another wending northwards from Chhapraghat to Menhdawal. The distance east-by-south of Basti is 22\u00bd miles; the population amounted in 1872 to 1,943 souls.\n\nKhaliabad has a tahsil, a first-class police-station, and an imperial post-office. Its commercial importance is merely that of a market village which trades with the immediate neighbourhood. It derives its name from its founder, Kazi Khalil-ur-Rahman, who was appointed commissioner (chakladar) of the Gorakhpur division about 1680.\u00b9 His name, again, means the friend of God, which in oriental literature is only one of the many synonyms for Abraham.\n\nKhaliabad, a tahsil with headquarters at the place just described, is bounded on east by south by the Gorakhpur district; on the north by tahsil Bansi; on west-by-north by tahsil Basti; and on south-west-by-south by the Ghagra, which divides it from the Faizabad district. Tahsil Khaliabad contains the eastern tappas (17) of parganah Maghar and (22) of parganah Mahauli. It had in 1878 a total area of 354,998 acres, or over 554 square miles; and a total land revenue of Rs. 2,54,638. Its population was by the census of 1872 returned as 307,717, or 554 persons to the square mile. But further details concerning the tahsil must be gathered from the article on its two parganahs.\n\nKothila or Sonaha, a village in tappa Kothila of pargana and tahsil Basti, stands besides the Basti, Domariaganj, and Nepali road, 22 miles north-north-west of the district capital. Sonaha is in strict accuracy the name of a small village which adjoins Kothila on the east. The population of the two together amounted in 1872 to 907 persons. Here are a third class police-station and a district post-office.\n\n\u00b9 Supra, p. 724.\nLALGANJ, in tappa Bargaon-Pag\u00e1r of pargana Mahanli and tahsil Basti, stands on the junction of two unmetalled roads, about 10 miles south-east-by-south of Basti. It is built on the lands of Sar\u00e1igh\u00e1t village, which in 1872 had 989 inhabitants. Amongst the insignificant little marts of the parganah it is remarkable for its manufacture of sugar and printed cloths.\n\nLAUTAN, a town in tappa Netwar of parganah Bin\u00e1yakpur and tahsil B\u00e1nsi, stands on the west or right bank of the Gh\u00fanghi river, 56 miles north-east of Basti. That is, however, not the distance as the crow flies; but the distance by a good unmetalled road which from Basti passes through Lautan into Gorakhpur. From the latter district Lautan parish (mauza) is severed only by the Gh\u00fanghi. The population in 1872 reached 701.\n\nLautan has a third-class police-station, a district post-office, and a registration post of the Agriculture and Commerce Department. The little office last named was lately established to watch and estimate the very large traffic which here passes from or towards Nep\u00e1l. The main road is met and crossed at Lautan by a cart-track from the Nep\u00e1lese mart of B\u00fatwal. And it is as an entrep\u00f4t for Nep\u00e1lese goods that Lautan is chiefly remarkable.\n\nThe principal imports are unhulled rice, wheat, clarified butter, drugs and spices, fibres and fibre manufactures, iron, copper coinage, oilseeds, hides and horns. The grain is stored at Lautan and thence sent, if intended for Calcutta, down the R\u00e1pti and Gh\u00e1gra; or, if intended for consumption in these provinces, across the Gh\u00e1gra to T\u00e1nda and Faizabad. But it is not only Nep\u00e1lese grain which is collected and distributed by Lautan. The town offers a popular market to the rice of the surrounding country. It may be noticed that certain Nep\u00e1lese imports show a curious caprice in their choice of a distributing emporium. Thus amongst oilseeds, linseed chiefly affects Lautan, and mustard the more southern Uska. Lautan, again, is the favourite mart for drugs, and Uska for fibre manufactures. The principal exports to Nep\u00e1l are cotton-twist, cotton-stuffs, cocoanuts, hardware, salt, sugar, and tobacco. Many of these goods have of course travelled from places outside the district, outside the provinces, or even outside the country. The total value of the Nep\u00e1lese exports and imports which during 1878-79 passed the Lautan registration post was Rs. 5,04,475.\n\nThe prosperity of Lautan and its neighbourhood has indeed greatly advanced since the time of Buchanan's survey (1813). That writer describes the town itself as containing only 70 poor huts; the surrounding country as a dismal and ill-cultivated tract of forest and tall grass. For the huts of mud or wicker we must now substitute shops which, though still mud-built, have at least a fairly\nrespectable appearance. Instead of forests we have fruitful groves of mango-trees. And the unhealthy-looking grass, which withered brown in summer, has been replaced by broad expanses of green ricefields.\n\n**Maghar**, a village in tappa Kasba or Maghar of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khalilabad, stands on the metalled Gorakhpur and Faizabad road, 27 miles east-by-south of Basti. In the settlement maps it is entered as Kasba-Kh\u00e1s: that is, the town *par excellence*, the old chief town of the pargana. It in 1872 had 2,551 inhabitants. Just east of the village the road just mentioned crosses the Ami river on a fine bridge, thereby connecting the Gorakhpur with the Basti district.\n\nBut Maghar is now noteworthy only as a place of past importance and present pilgrimage. It is celebrated as containing the cenotaph and shrine of the prophet Kabir Shah. Some account of his life, his poetical precepts and the sect which he founded, has been given in the Mainpuri notice. All these subjects, however, are involved in some obscurity. Ab\u00fal Fazl calls him the Unitarian; but it is impossible to assert whether he was more Musalm\u00e1n than Hindu, more Hindu than Musalm\u00e1n. It is equally impossible to say that his doctrines were, like those of several other reformers, an attempt at compromise between Hinduism and Islam; for both faiths he attacked most unsparingly. Yet both Hindu and Muslim agree that he was a saint in whose creed there was something akin to their own; that he was a man worthy of worship. And both, when uncorrupted by theological education and theological hatred, flock with equal devotion to his shrine.\n\nThe local legends concerning his life, which have much in common with those elsewhere summarized, may be thus told: A Muslim weaver of Benares was bringing home his bride, when she went aside to slake her thirst at the Chanda tank near that city. What saw she on the water but a lovely child, floated lightly on a leaf of lotus. Though to outward seeming newly born, this boy had the perfect gift of speech. Water or milk from his nurse's hand he refused to drink. But he besought them that they should bring him a two-year heifer which had never bred, and this he sucked whenever he needed nourishment. Having thereby shown his aversion from Isl\u00e1m, he was deemed a Hindu; and a Br\u00e1hman named him Kabir. Some years afterwards the weaver wished him to undergo circumcision, but Kabir declined this rite. He wished, he said, to receive formal instruction (*upadesh*) from the Hindu doctors; but they refused to instruct him, saying that he herded with Muslims. Kabir therefore betook himself to stratagem. He one night laid himself across the\n\n---\n\n1 Gaz., IV., 562-64.\nthreshold of the cell where dwelt a holy pandit. Towards morning the saint came out and stumbled over Kab\u00edr, who thereon gave vent to the usual Hind\u00fast\u00e1ni oath of surprise, \"Oh father, father\" (B\u00e1pre b\u00e1p). \"Call not on your father,\" shouted the good man, \"but say R\u00e1m, R\u00e1m.\" Now \"R\u00e1m, R\u00e1m,\" is the ordinary form of Hindu salutation; and the sprawling divine had merely called attention to the deficiency in Kab\u00edr's manners. But the expression is literally an invocation of the name of R\u00e1ma; and in being told to utter it Kab\u00edr insisted that he had received religious instruction. His claim seems to have been admitted; and its plausibility was strong. The only religious instruction usually vouchsafed to the low-class Hindu is the instruction that, when he seeks to pray, he should mutter incessantly the name of some God.\n\nKab\u00edr now became renowned for his learning and sanctity. He journeyed to Jagann\u00e1th of \u00darisa, where king Indrayumna had long and vainly attempted to rear, beside the ocean, his celebrated temples. Since Kab\u00edr blessed the works the waves have never touched them; and beside them a monument was raised to his memory. After many other wanderings he reached Maghar, and there seemed to die. And his disciples disputed over his body, the Hind\u00fas wishing to have it burned according to their own rites, while the Muslims seized it and buried it according to the rites of Isl\u00e1m. Whilst hot words were still being bandied about, the saint, who was in fact at Brind\u00e1ban of Mathura and had but shaken off his old body, sent word that if they opened his grave they should find no further cause for quarrel. And they opened the grave and found nought save a delectable fragrance.\n\nThis is said to have happened in 1274; and though Kab\u00edr's real death was deferred until about 1450, his admirers at once reared above the sacred spot a shrine (rauza). The original building was replaced or restored by Naw\u00e1b Fid\u00e1\u00e9 Kh\u00e1n, who about 1567 garrisoned Maghar with an imperial force; but the tomb has always been in charge of the same Musalm\u00e1n family. The present sacristan, who, like the adoptive father of the saint himself, is a Musalm\u00e1n weaver (Jul\u00e1ha), holds for his services a revenue-free village in the par-ganah, and receives also an allowance of 4 annas daily, payable at the Gorakhpur treasury. These emoluments enable him, on nights of festival, to illuminate the shrine. About 1764 his ancestor was joined at that shrine, but not displaced, by a mahant, the prior of some Hindu order. This prior was a very holy\n\n---\n\n1 Readers of the old Household Words may remember an amusing article in which \"Laing the Mofussilite\" describes a day with the King of Oudh. Under the form of \"Boppery, boppery, bopp,\" this oath is very frequently placed in that monarch's mouth. 2According to H. H. Wilson the founder was one Bij\u00fa Kh\u00e1n Path\u00e1n.\nperson, and his presence added popularity to the spot. When he died his ashes and grilled bones were placed under a second shrine beside the first; and this Hindu erection is sometimes supposed sacred to Kabir. The mahant's successor has at least nominal charge of his tomb (samadh). The remuneration is in this case a revenue-free village in the Gorakhpur district, but no daily allowance. The last custodian, M\u00e1n D\u00e1s, was slain in an affray between certain members of Kabir's sect (panth). The sister shrines stand picturesquely east of the town, on the banks of the river \u00c1mi; but neither is architecturally striking, neither impressively large.\n\nBeside them is held in December-January (P\u00e1s) a fair which lasts almost the whole month. The ostensible object of the meeting is the oblation of gifts at the shrine of Kabir; but these are for the most part of the meanest description. Though superfluous copper coins are sometimes presented, the usual offering is a mixture of pulse and rice (khichri). The real convening motive is the love of cheap shopping. Petty tradesmen flock hither from Lucknow, Cawnpore, Benares, Gorakhpur and Mehnd\u00e1wal; and from 2 to 4 annas a booth is levied as the due of the township landlord. Nothing of much value is exposed for sale. The fair is not a market for horses or cattle. But its total attendance of visitors may perhaps be reckoned at 5,000.\n\nEast also of the town, on the lip of the same stream, rise another mosque and another temple. Some ten years ago a rich man of Gorakhpur built near the former a flight of steps (gh\u00e9t) descending to the river. In the town itself stand the biggish tomb of K\u00e1zi Khalil-ur-Rahm\u00e1n, a seventeenth-century governor; and some old but solid masonry houses, belonging to K\u00e1yaths and Bakk\u00e1ls. Westward may be traced the remains of a castle which is said to have been the stronghold of the Magbar r\u00e1jas. The fortifications were in the usual style of a quadrangle defended by a ditch, an earthen rampart, and a quickset bambu hedge; but covered some 16 acres and contained some brick buildings. West of this castle lies the village of Ghanshy\u00e1mpur, which, according to legend, contained a fortress of the Th\u00e1r\u00fas. Around the castle itself, and thence through the town to Kabir's tomb, may be seen spots covered with brick rubble. Buchanan suggests that these, \"if ever the Th\u00e1r\u00fas resided here, must be the remains of their town.\"\n\nBut the Th\u00e1r\u00fa occupation, if not altogether mythical, is at all events too uncertain to claim further notice here. The name of Maghar seems to be Hindi, meaning a kind of ricefield; and the first really tangible characters in its history were the Sarnet R\u00e1jputs, who about 1300 made it the capital of their principality. But about 1570 they fled before the Muslims to B\u00e1nsi;\nand Maghar, vacated by its r\u0101ja, was garrisoned by the imperial troops under Fid\u0101\u02bf Kh\u0101n. About 1610 the Sarnet chief, now called the r\u0101ja of B\u0101nsi, succeeded in expelling the Muhammadan garrison and resuming possession of the town. But some seventy years later, when the Dehli emperor was once more at leisure to make his power felt in this part of the country, K\u0101zi Khal\u012bl-ur-Rahm\u0101n was despatched from Faizabad with a force which easily re-occupied Maghar. Through it from Faizabad to Gorakhpur was made a new military road whose alignment must have much resembled that of the modern metalled highway between those places. From this time till 1801, when the district was ceded by Oudh to the Company, the Musalm\u0101ns never again lost their hold on the town. It became a military post of considerable importance; and the administrative division which included it was sometimes entered in official documents as Sark\u0101r-i Muazzim\u0101bd o Maghar, the Government of Gorakhpur and Maghar. Naw\u0101b Mans\u016br Ali Kh\u0101n of Oudh, better known under the title of Safdar Jang, carried his interest in the place so far as to set aside several villages for the support of Kabir\u2019s shrine.\n\nMaghar or Hasanpur-Maghar, a parganah of the Basti and Khal\u012blabad tahsils, twice protrudes its eastern border into the Gorakhpur district, where-with boundary lines are in places afforded by the R\u0101pti and \u0100mi rivers. On its equally irregular northern frontier it is bounded by parganah B\u0101nsi, the division being for some distance marked by the Budh and Bar\u0101r watercourses. For a few miles on the north-west it marches with parganah Ras\u016blpur; while for many on the south-west the Garebia and Katnehia brooks sever it from parganah Basti. Its neighbour on the south-south-west is parganah Mahauli. Maghar is divided into 20 tappas. Of these the seventeen eastern\u2014Gop\u0101lpur, Sakra, Majora, Belhar, Menhd\u0101wal, Bakhira, Bakochi, Am\u0101nabad, Phulethu, Dew\u0101p\u0101r, Churaib, R\u0101mp\u016br-Paili, South Haveli, Uji\u0101r, Maghar or Kasba, \u016an, and Atr\u0101wal\u2014belong to the Khal\u012blabad; the three western\u2014Rudhauli, Gusi\u0101ri, and B\u0101nskhor,\u2014to the Basti tahsil. The parganah contains 1,46 estates (mah\u0101l), coinciding as a rule with the same number of parishes (mauz\u0101); and of these 968 lie within tahsil Khal\u012blabad. Maghar had in 1878 an area of 289,661 acres, or over 452\u00bd square miles; and a land revenue of Rs. 2,14,168. Of the former above 342\u00bd miles, and of the latter Rs. 1,60,779, belong to the same Khal\u012blabad.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Maghar contained 1,147 inhabited sites, of which 705 had less than 200 inhabitants; 364 between 200 and 500; 66 between 500 and\n\n1 Safdar Jang died in 1756.\n1,000; 7 between 1,000 and 2,000; and 4 between 2,000 and 3,000. The only town containing more than 5,000 inhabitants was Menhd\u00e1wal, with a population of 8,124.\n\nThe total population numbered 253,533 souls (117,243 females), giving 1,092 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 199,466 Hind\u00fas, of whom 91,815 were females; and 53,867 Musalm\u00e1ns (25,428 females). Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 25,362 Br\u00fahmans (11,700 females); 4,864 Rajp\u00fatas (2,194 females); and 6,832 Baniy\u00e1s (3,083 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \"the other castes,\" which show a total of 162,408 souls (74,828 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (2,141), Kanaujia (9,803), Gaur (320), S\u00e1ras\u00fat, and Maithil. The R\u00e9jputs belong to the Ponw\u00e1r (123), Bais (691), Gautam (350), Chauh\u00e1n (71), S\u00farajbansi (92), Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j (33), Raghubansi (210), Jaisw\u00e1r, Kunw\u00e1r, Dikshit, Sakarw\u00e1r, Sirnet, R\u00e1thor, Bahmangaur, Orik, and Arail clans; the Baniyas to the Agarw\u00e1l (755), Kasaundhan (1,472), K\u00e1ndu (2,487), Agarahri (913), Panw\u00e1r, and Kasarw\u00e1n\u00ed sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (2,376), Kah\u00e1r (5,843), Kurmi (19,444), Teli (4,237), Dhobi (4,433), N\u00e1i (2,987), Cham\u00e1r (32,905), Ah\u00edr (25,689), Gadaria (1,050), Barhai (3,613), Loh\u00e1r (3,446), K\u00e1yath (1,977), Khewat (11,399), Tamboli (4,161), Kalw\u00e1r (2,054), Dhark\u00e1r (1,131), Kumbh\u00e1r (5,714), Ch\u00e1i (2,400), M\u00e1l\u00ed (1,507), Son\u00e1r (1,166), Nuniya (2,014), Bharbhunja (1,262), Koeri (6,837), P\u00e1si (1,807), and Lodha (4,302). The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Khatik, B\u00e1ri, At\u00edt, Manibe, Gos\u00e1in, Bair\u00e1g\u00ed, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Thathera, Koli, Halw\u00e1i, Patwa, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1rhi, Arakh, Mur\u00e1o, Jogi, Baheliya, Sar\u00e1hiya, Bhu\u00ednhar, Bind, Taw\u00e1if, Beld\u00e1r, Seori, Kasera, Barg\u00fahi, Sorath, and Tamera. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (5,834), Path\u00e1ns (5,050), Sayyids (401), Mughals (183), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 1,604 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 3,847 to the domestic class, including servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 837 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers and tradesmen of all sorts; 6,152 to the agricultural class; and 7,129 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 5,744 persons\n\n---\n\n1 See article on parganah Amorha, \"population,\" note.\nreturned as labourers and 742 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 20,707 as landholders, 185,004 as cultivators, and 47,622 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 984 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 136,091 souls.\n\nThe plain of Maghar has greatly changed since about 1815, when Buchanan describes it scantily cultivated and covered in great measure by trees. Trees are now no commoner and cultivation no thinner than in any other part of the district. The Ami meanders south-eastwards across the tract, to join the Rapti in Gorakhpur. It is itself joined within the parganah by various intermittent watercourses which serve as escapes for surface drainage. Of several large lagoons, the Bakhira Tal or Moti Jhil on the Gorakhpur frontier is easily the largest. Irrigation is obtained not only from these natural reservoirs, but from those wells in which the parganah is rich. Water seems to lie at an average depth of 13\u00bd feet from the surface.\n\nThe soils are chiefly loam (doras) and clay (mattiy\u00e1r). The richest loam tracts are tappas Am\u00e1nabad, Phulethu, Dew\u00e1p\u00e1r, South-Haveli, and Maghar, all in the south of the parganah; while the finest clay lands are those of tappas Uji\u00e1r, B\u00e1nskhor, Churaib, and R\u00e1mpur Paili, all on or near the south-western border. But though Maghar is as a rule fertile, it has wide regions of rather inferior productiveness. The tappas of the northern frontier, Gusi\u00e1ri, Gop\u00e1lpur, Sakra and Majora, are less thickly peopled and less profusely watered than other parts of the tract. Much of tappas Rudhauli, \u00dan, and Atr\u00e1wal consists of poor land shaded by mahua trees. And in tappas Bakhira and Menhd\u00e1wal, adjoining the Bakhira-t\u00e1l, cultivation is impeded by the dread of inundations from that lake.\n\nIn the tappas which at present compose the parganah 16,248 acres were at assessment (1862) returned as cultivated; and of these again 117,743 were recorded as watered.\u00b9 The spring crops seem to cover more than twice the ground occupied by those of the autumn. Chief amongst the former are wheat, barley, arhar pulse, purple peas (kir\u00e1o) and linseed; chief amongst the latter rice and urd pulse. In winter the white flowers of the poppy-field form a pleasant feature in the landscape. The opium crop cannot of course take its place beside wheat and rice as one of the staple growths of the parganah, but it is the most widely grown of all the more precious crops. Of sugarcane there is comparatively little, and cotton is almost unknown. The landlords are\n\n\u00b9 See above, p. 668, note.\nchiefly Bhunhars and Musalmans. Proprietary tenures are chiefly pattiddari, and of that form known as imperfect pattiddari.\n\nBesides its crops and a few unimportant manufactures, to be mentioned hereafter in the article on Menhdawal, Maghar has no remarkable products. Its surplus agricultural commodities find a sale not only at Menhdawal, but at Bakhira or Baghnagar, Hanuman-ganj, Rudhauli, Gusiari, the tahsil capital Khalilabad, the old parganah capital Maghar, and several other villages where weekly markets are held. The metalled road from Gorakhpur to Basti spans the south of the parganah, passing Maghar and Khalilabad. The unmetalled Karmainighat and Basti line, on which stands Menhdawal, runs south-westwards across the whole breadth of the tract. Two unmetalled highways cross at Rudhauli and two more at Bakhira.\n\nThe history of Maghar has been told with sufficient fulness in the article on the neighbouring but smaller parganah Maghar of Gorakhpur. It remains only to add a few local details.\n\nIn copies of Akbar's Institutes (1596) the two Maghars, undivided as yet from one another and from Banshi south of the Rapti, are entered as Ratanpur-Maghar or Ratanpur Banshi. Before their cession to the British (1801) they had lost their Banshi tappas, while the country around Bakhira had become recognized as a separate parganah. Bakhira was soon, however, absorbed in Maghar, and that parganah remained unsevered until 1865. It was then divided into two portions; about two-thirds of it being given to the new-born district of Basti and the remaining third going to form parganah Maghar of Gorakhpur.\n\nThere are few remains of antiquarian interest. Some of those that exist have been mentioned in the article on Maghar town. Buchanan refers to several ruinous castles of the Sarnets; but he names only that at Gusiari, which he deemed the most remarkable. Here lived for some time one Shiu Singh Kachhwaha, a cadet of the Jaipur family, who married a Sarnet noblewoman. The popular but comparatively modern temple of Shiva at Kop of tappa Bakhira, adjoins a mound of doris to which some ascribe a Dom or Domkatar and others a Tharu origin.\n\n\"The ruin is in the style of those attributed to the Tharus, being a large heap of brick rubbish, without any traces of a ditch. It is about a third of a mile in diameter, and very irregular in its shape, having many projecting corners. Its South-Western quarter is very high; but in other parts it is low, and north from it broken bricks are scattered to a considerable distance on some high land, although they do not form heaps. In that direction there probably have been some small houses, while the great mass was the chief's castle. This ruin\n\n1 Supra, p. 515.\n2 He was a grandson of the historical Jal Singh I. of Amber, who died in 1666; and a son-in-law, apparently, of Madhu II. of Banshi.\nis called Kopa. A little way east from the heap is the temple of Shiva. It is a small cubical building covered by a dome, in the Muhammadan style; and stands at the west end of a tank dug by that people, its longest diameter being from east to west.\\(^1\\)\n\nExcept the name Kopeshwar, the Lord of Kopa, there is nothing to denote a connection with the ruin, although the image may be old enough. About 200 votaries assemble on the Shur\u0101ttri.\n\nMahauli, a village in tappa Bankat of parganah Mahauli and tahsil Khalilabad, stands near the right bank of the Katneshia, about 18 miles south-east of Basti. That is the distance as the crow flies, for Mahauli is approached by no road. Its population amounted in 1872 to 2,414 souls.\n\nMahauli has a third-class police-station and an imperial post-office. It has also some historical associations which entitle it to notice. Whether its name, like that of the Mathura Maholi, is a corruption of Madhupuri matters little. But we know that it about 1580 became the stronghold of those S\u016brajbansi rajas who seized the surrounding country from the Bhars. Having thus become the capital of a principality, it is in 1596 recorded as the capital of the parganah which still bears its name; for in Akbar's Institutes and this part of India the terms principality (r\u0101j) and parganah (mah\u0101l) were generally synonymous. The Mahauli rajas continued to dwell at Mahauli till about 1780. But a great sickness which then fell upon the family, and was supposed to proceed from the wrath of a deity, caused their migration to Mahson. The remains of their castle were still distinctly visible in the second decade of this century. Built on a mound of broken brick, the reputed ruins of a Th\u0101ru fastness, it was surrounded by a brick rampart which enclosed several buildings of the same material. The village was in 1814 still surrounded by forests which had been planted as a defence against the Musalm\u0101n cavalry. But before the hunger of the plough and the demand for fuel these have long disappeared.\n\nMahauli, a parganah of the Khalilabad and Basti tahsils, occupies the south-eastern corner of the district. It juts on the east into Gorakhpur, from which it is for some miles divided by the Ku\u0101na river. It is bounded on the north-east by parganah Maghar, and on the north-north-west by parganah Basti. On its concave west-north-western side it is indented by parganah Nagar and again skirted for a while by the Ku\u0101na. The whole of the south-south-western frontier is supplied by the river Gh\u0101gra, which severs the parganah from the Faizabad district. Mahauli has 32 tappas. Of these the 22 eastern\u2014Karri, Tama, Aor\u0101d\u0101nr, M\u0101ndar, Fid\u0101ipur, Kars\u0101nd, Deokalli, Muhabra, Chandr\u0101oti, Bankat, Aj\u00e9on, Naud\u0101nr, Buzurgw\u0101r, Tari\u0101p\u0101r, Maithi, Kuchri, Sathara,\n\n\\(^1\\) The Muhammadans were not the only people who dug their tanks in this manner. Buchanan seems to have been unaware that the aboriginal races, his favourite Th\u0101ras probably included, made their reservoirs S\u016brajbedi, or longest from east to west. A Hindu tank is generally Chandrabedi, or longest from north to south.\nTaraf-Belghatia, Sirsi, Barg\u00e1on, East Mur\u00e1dpur, and Simri\u2014belong to the Khal\u00edabad tahsil. The remaining 10\u2014Kapri-Mahson, Kur\u00e1on, Dehi, Mahtoli, Barg\u00e1on-Pag\u00e1r, Jagann\u00e1thpur, Charkaila, Kudarha, Kabra, and Seobakhri,\u2014lie, of course, in tahsil Basti. The parganah contains 1,096 estates (mah\u00e1l), coinciding as a rule with the same number of parishes (mauza); and of these 601 are included in tahsil Khal\u00edabad. Mahauli had in 1878 an area of 245,153 acres, or somewhat over 383 square miles; and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,68,622. Of the former rather more than 212 miles, and of the latter Rs. 93,859, belong to the same Khal\u00edabad.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872 parganah Mahauli contained 952 inhabited sites, of which 608 had less than 200 inhabitants; 277 between 200 and 500; 50 between 500 and 1,000; 14 between 1,000 and 2,000; 2 between 2,000 and 3,000; and one between 3,000 and 5,000. The total population numbered 204,849 souls (95,604 females), giving 1,074 to the square mile. Classified according to religion, there were 184,762 Hind\u00fas, of whom 66,031 were females; and 20,087 Musalm\u00e1ns (9,573 females). Distributing the Hindu population amongst the four great classes, the census shows 24,936 Br\u00e1hmans (11,364 females); 7,000 R\u00e1jputs (3,223 females); and 8,451 Baniy\u00e1s (3,964 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in \u201cthe other castes\u201d of the census returns, which show a total of 144,375 souls (67,480 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (11,359), Kanaujia (10,360), Gaur (54), Gautam (127), and P\u00e1nde. The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Ponw\u00e1r (554), Bais (1,793), Gautam (301), Parw\u00e1r (207), Chauh\u00e1n (212), S\u00farajbansi (1,620), Bh\u00e1raddhw\u00e1j (213), Raghubansi (6), Konohik, R\u00e1jkum\u00e1r, Gaharw\u00e1r, R\u00e1jbansi, Punder, Sakarw\u00e1r, Sirnet, Gaur, and Bhu\u00ednh\u00e1r clans; the Baniy\u00e1s to the Agarw\u00e1l (1,314), Kasaudhan (1,871), K\u00e1ndn (2,476), and Agarahri (2,323) subdivisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (2,894), Kah\u00e1r (6,109), Kurmi (17,255), Teli (3,899), Dhobi (3,942), N\u00e1i (3,390), Cham\u00e1r (33,421), Ah\u00edr (28,214), Gadariya (1,586), Barhai (3,085), Loh\u00e1r (2,668), K\u00e1yath (2,839), Khewat (3,426), Tamboli (2,086), Kalw\u00e1r (1,130), Kumh\u00e1r (3,816), M\u00e1li (1,815), Sun\u00e1r (1,895), Nuniya (1,784), Manibe\u00b9 (1,278), Koeri (1,581), Koli (2,786), and R\u00e1jbhar (1,841). The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Dhark\u00e1r, Khatik, B\u00e1ri, Atit, Bharbhunja, Gos\u00e1in, Bair\u00e1gi, Pasi, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Thathera, Lodha, Halw\u00e1i, Patwa, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1rhi, Arakh, Baheliya, Sar\u00e1hiya, Gound,\u00b2 Dhuna, Bold\u00e1r,\n\n\u00b9 See article on parganah Amorha, \u201cPopulation,\u201d note. \u00b2 See similar note to article on parganah B\u00e1usi.\nSeori, Jaisw\u00e1r, Ramaiya, Kharw\u00e1r, and N\u00e1naksh\u00e1hi. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Path\u00e1ns (4,223), Shaikhs (2,770), Sayyids (656), Mughals (178), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 563 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,143 to the domestic class, including personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,591 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 52,003 to the agricultural class and 4,226 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 5,488 persons returned as labourers and 605 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 20,228 as landholders, 148,624 as cultivators, and 35,997 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 848 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 109,245 souls.\n\nThe Mahuli landscape has no special peculiarities. The parganah is a well-tilled alluvial plain of the appearance familiar elsewhere in the district. The flat horizon is shut in by thinkly-scattered mango-groves; in tappa Muhabra and elsewhere are found small patches of scanty brushwood jungle; and in the neighbourhood of the Gh\u00e1gra are long stretches of waste land waving with thatching-grass or studded with grazing cattle. But forest is just as absent as rock or hill. The salient feature of the tract is as usual its rivers, which creep in south-easterly or east-south-easterly courses towards the Gh\u00e1gra. In the direction last-mentioned flow the two principal streams, the Gh\u00e1gra itself and the Ku\u00e1na. About 1850 the former set northwards at the point where most nearly approached by the latter. It in three years cut through the four miles of intervening country, and at length burst into the Ku\u00e1na, which runs in a lower bed. The result was a connecting channel which, where it leaves the Gh\u00e1gra, is two or three miles wide. Every rainy season, when this channel is flooded, the autumn crops of eighteen southern tappas are more or less damaged. In many places the ground does not dry in time to be sown with a spring crop, or at least to be manured so as to produce a paying one. The expedient of growing the water-logged soil with winter-rice would probably have been tried if possible. The subsiding floods seldom leave behind any beneficial deposit, and too often a sterilizing deposit of sand. These facts will sufficiently explain the statement that during the term (1840-1862) of the last assessment\nnearly 10,000 acres were rendered unculturable by the action of the Gh\u00e1gra.\n\nFrom the point where reinforced by this channel, the once quiet Ku\u00e1na has during the rains become a great branch of the greater river. For navigation, except by the smallest craft, it was temporarily spoilt. When the floods subsided, they were found to have shoaled up the river with sand-banks or snagged its channels with uprooted trees. A southward movement of the Gh\u00e1gra has now somewhat reduced the evil. But one of the first results of the former change was the dilution of half Mukhlispur grain-mart. The principal affluents of the Ku\u00e1na are the Manwar, which joins it on the right bank just above L\u00e1lganj, near the Nagar frontier; and the Katneha, which after a long southeasterly course through the parganah finds a mouth just above Mukhlispur, in the eastern centre of the tract.\n\nThe two latter streams and others are utilised for purposes of irrigation, but the principal sources of water for the fields are lagoons, ponds, and wells. The lagoons seem during late years to have shrunk considerably. Not only does cultivation make far greater demands on their water than formerly; but into them, since the conversion of forests into fields, the rains wash more silt. The settlement report (1862) describes the distance of water from the surface as \"small;\" but of the watered area it gives more precise details. Of the total cultivation, 135,394 acres, no less than 104,182 are recorded as irrigated.\n\nThe soils are as usual called loam (dorae), clay (mattiy\u00e1r), and sand (balua). But here as elsewhere the settlement surveyors seem to have made their classification with no very scientific accuracy. It is often hard to decide when clay is sufficiently sandy to be styled loam; and they seem to have often evaded the difficulty by classing as the former all lands cropped in autumn, as the latter all lands cropped in spring. \"Much that appeared as mattiy\u00e1r and balua in the former papers,\" writes Mr. Wilson, \"is now recorded as doras. This is in many cases owing to the reduction of the harshness of the soil by manuring, irrigation, etc.\" But such processes are insufficient to turn clay or sand into loam. And the nomenclature adopted seems hardly less artificial than that of the people themselves, who class soils as near (goind) the village, midland (miy\u00e1na), and far (pallu) from the village.\n\nThe area sown for the spring harvest is more than five times as large as that sown for the autumnal. Noting roughly in thousands of acres the space occupied by each of the principal spring crops, we should get the following results:\u2014 Wheat, 38\u00bd; barley or mixed barley and wheat, 20\u00bd; mixed barley and purple peas (jaukir\u00e1t), 18\u00bd; arhar pulse 13\u00bd; and white peas, 11\u00bd. Marked in the\nsame manner, the chief autumn growths would stand thus: Rices, 13\u00bd; and urd pulse, 6. The owners of the soil which produces these crops are chiefly S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jputs; amongst their tenantry Kurmis, Ah\u00edrs, Koeris, and Cham\u00e1rs prevail.\n\nAn agricultural tract with no large towns, Mahauli has no important product, except its crops. Its only manufactures are the sugar and printed cloths of L\u00e1lganj and the coarse blankets of Hainsar. The parganah was formerly famed for its cattle; and though these have decreased as pasturage has been brought under the plough, the cattle-trade is still considerable. \"The only markets whose trade extends beyond the parganah,\" notes the writer last quoted, \"are G\u00e1egh\u00e1t and Mukhlispur for grain and L\u00e1lganj for sugar and cloths. On the whole the markets are not flourishing. The banks of the Gh\u00e1gra are low and present no site suitable for a b\u00e1z\u00e1r. G\u00e1egh\u00e1t, the nearest to the Gh\u00e1gra, suffered from attacks in the Mutiny; and L\u00e1lganj and Mukhlispur have suffered from the shoaling of the Ku\u00e1na, on which they are situate, a great part of their trade being taken up by the b\u00e1z\u00e1r of Dhakwa, lower down that river. This is not, however, very material. The country is so level that it can be crossed by carts in every direction, and the difference of a few miles in distance is scarcely felt.\" The parganah is, nevertheless, drained by four unmetalled roads. On one of these stands Mukhlispur; on a second, L\u00e1lganj; on the third, G\u00e1egh\u00e1t and Chhapr\u00e1gh\u00e1t; on the fourth, Mahson. Though unmentioned by Mr. Wilson, Chhapr\u00e1gh\u00e1t and Mahson are places of some importance. So are Hariharpur and the old parganah capital Mahauli, of which neither stands on any officially recognized highway.\n\nThe earliest traditional masters of Mahanli were R\u00e1jbhars and Th\u00e1r\u00fas. But about 1580 the aborigines were expelled by those S\u00farajbansi R\u00e1jputs who founded the Mahauli principality and who are still the chief landholders of the parganah. The new-comers made Mahauli village their capital; but the present r\u00e1ja, a descendant of the first, lives at Mahson. In the Institutes of Akbar (1596) the parganah is entered as a part of the Gorakhpur district (dast\u00far), Gorakhpur division (sark\u00e1r), and Oudh province (s\u00faba). About a century and a quarter afterwards the rule of the Dehli emperors gave place to that of their now independent Oudh viceroy. But it is probable that Mahanli still remained a part of the Gorakhpur district. And of the Gorakhpur district (zila), as remodelled by the British, it remained a part after its cession (1801) to the East India Company. The demands assessed upon the parganah at successive British settlements of land revenue have been: in 1803, Rs. 35,435; in 1806, Rs. 52,336; Rs. 55,109 in 1809;\nRs. 61,979 in 1813; in 1840, Rs. 1,34,090; and in 1862, Rs. 1,66,613. The enormous increase since the first decade of British rule shows the strides with which, under that rule, cultivation has advanced. During the second decade Buchanan notes the existence within the parganah of \"two long stunted forests, very ugly.\" But these have succumbed before the plough.\n\nThe only antiquities mentioned by the same author are the remains of three S\u00farajbansi castles. Of these one has been mentioned in the article on Mahanli village; and of all three it may now be said that perierunt etiam ruinae. When Buchanan wrote the parganah was included in the police-circle of San\u00edchara, a still existing village which has no other claim to mention.\n\nMahson, a large village in tappa Kapri-Mahson of parganah Mahauli and tahsil Basti, stands beside the unmetalled road from B\u00e1nsi to L\u00e1lganj, 7 miles south-south-east of the former. When we have said that it in 1872 sheltered 3,575 inhabitants, we have said almost all that can be said about it. It is, however, the seat of the Mahauli r\u00e1ja and a market of some local importance.\n\nMenhd\u00e1wal, the largest and commercially the most important town of the district, lies in tappa Menhd\u00e1wal of parganah Maghar and tahsil Khalilabad. Its north latitude is 26\u00b057'; its east longitude 89\u00b09'; and its distance north-east-by-east of Basti 27 miles. The unmetalled road from Basti to Karmaini-gh\u00e1t is here met by several others from Rudhaul\u00ed, B\u00e1nsi, Bakhira, and elsewhere. The population, being then short of 5,000, is not mentioned in the census report of 1847. But it amounted in 1853 to 7,273; in 1865 to 7,349; and in 1872 to 8,124. In the year last named the inhabited site was returned as measuring 180 acres, and as peopled at a density of 45 to the acre. Of the inhabitants as many as 6,842 were Hind\u00fas and as few as 1,282 Musalm\u00e1ns. The people are, writes Dr. Planck ten years ago, \"well dressed, prosperous in appearance.\"\n\nDistant some five miles only from the R\u00e9pti, about two from the edge of the Bakhira lagoon, and even less from the low country flooded during the monsoon by those waters, Menhd\u00e1wal stands in a rather damp and malarious locality. Issuing from its north-eastern and south-eastern outskirts respectively, two natural water-courses convey its surface drainage southwards towards the lagoon. The town itself consists mostly of mud huts, irregularly grouped about a winding road whose general direction is north-eastwards. This main street is joined or crossed by others, the chief quadrivium being that called the Chauk or Square,\n\n1Sanitary Commissioner's Report, 1870.\nthe principal market-place of Menhd\u00e1wal. Towards their junction in this centre all the roads are lined with fair shops. But the appearance of business is greater than the appearance of orderly arrangement in the buildings.\n\nWest of the Square one of the roads opens out into another market-place. This, a widish space flanked by excellent houses, while graced within by trees and wells, is devoted chiefly to cotton. Some of the buildings are fronted by palisaded enclosures for the storing of that commodity; but there are also good shops for the sale of other articles. Towards the north of the town are yet two more market-places\u2014one dealing chiefly in Nep\u00e1lese goods, the other in tobacco. The last, a square of goodly houses enclosing goodly trees, is perhaps the pleasantest part of Menhd\u00e1wal. But the bulk of the town is a rambling collection of hovels, accompanied by the usual complement of pits dug to supply material for mud-walls, tiles, and bricks. Numerous wells supply good drinking-water at a depth, in the cold weather, of 15 feet. But they are not always tended with the care they deserve. \"Mud and filthy water,\" wrote Dr. Planck some years ago, \"announced the neighbourhood of a well almost as surely as an unpleasant odour announced the neighbourhood of an excavation.\"\n\nOn an open space traversed by the main road stands the first-class police-station. Beside the same thoroughfare on the south rises a Th\u00e1kurdw\u00e1ra or temple of Krishna; whilst a second on the northern outskirts reminds one that Menhd\u00e1wal is above all things a town of Hind\u00fas. It is said that every house has its cow. The place boasts also an imperial post-office, a branch dispensary, and a tahs\u00edli school. The sard\u00ed or native hostelry is a shop-like building on the main road.\n\nThe Chauk\u00edd\u00e1ri Act (XX. of 1856) is in force. During 1878-79 the House-tax. house-tax thereby imposed, together with a balance of Rs. 717 from the preceding year, gave a total income of Rs. 2,604. The expenditure, which was chiefly on police (Rs. 797) and conservancy (Rs. 324), amounted to Rs. 1,193. The returns showed 1,400 houses, of which 432 were assessed with the tax: the incidence being Rs. 4-5-11 per house assessed and Re. 0-3-9' per head of population. Some idea of the town's growth during the past 65 years may be gathered from the statement that about 1815 it had but 500 houses.\u00b9\n\nMenhd\u00e1wal is now, as already mentioned, the principal mart of the district. Trade. Its trade consists chiefly in the exchange of goods from the Nep\u00e1l hills for goods from the Ganges plain.\n\n\u00b9 Eastern India, II., 392.\nBut in its markets may be seen also articles from the Nepalese Tarai and from England. The most considerable Nepalese imports brought as a rule from Butwal are iron, copper-coinage, unhusked rice and other grain, chiretta and other drugs, ginger and other spices (turmeric, cardamums, cloves, cinnamon, chilies, pepper, hill betel-nut, coriander-seed, etc.), fibre manufactures (tat and bhangra), vegetable dyes, bankas grass, and clarified butter. The imports from places in these provinces\u2014from Cawnpore, Allahabad, Mirzapur, and Gorakhpur\u2014are raw cotton, cotton-stuffs, English and native, salt, metal vessels, sugar, and hides. The last are exported chiefly to Patna in Bengal. From Saran in the same province are brought for local consumption large quantities of tobacco; and in the tobacco-market live several agents of Chhapra merchants, wholesale dealers in this solacing drug. The weekly market-days are supplemented by three yearly fairs: one held on the Ramliha festival in September-October (Ku\u00e1r); the second at the feast of the wedding of R\u00e1ma in November-December (Aghan); and last on the birthday of Shiva (Shi\u00far\u0101tri) in February-March. But at none of these meetings is the attendance large. The number of visitors is reckoned at 3,000 for the first and 1,000 each for the second and third.\n\nThe town was founded by one D\u00e1modar Singh, who received from his chieftain, the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1ja, a large fief in the neighbourhood. On this grant the original market was established by one of his descendants; but the warlike pedlars known as Banj\u00e1ras are perhaps entitled to some share of the credit. Menhd\u00e1wal parish (mausa) is still owned partly by Rajputs and partly by Banj\u00e1ras. The former gave some trouble during the Great Rebellion, when the lands of Hargovind Singh became forfeit for treason; the latter call themselves N\u00e1ik, a title which is properly due only to the chiefs of their clan.\n\nMisraulia, a village in tappa B\u00e9rikp\u00e1r of parganah B\u00e1nsi and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, stands about 34 miles in a direct line north-by-east of Basti. The distance by road and cross-country track is, however, some 20 miles greater. Not far from the village on the north-west lies an extensive forest tract; not far from it on the north-east the Sikri watercourse joins the Burhi R\u00e1pti river. The population amounted in 1872 to 166 persons only; and Misraulia is mentioned merely as the site of a third-class police-station and a district post-office.\n\nNagar, a village in tappa Nagar or Haveli of parganah Nagar and tahsil Basti, has some slight historical interest. A map in General Cunningham's Archaeological Survey Reports seems to identify it with the Kapila-nagara where\n\n1 Vol. I., plate 1.\nBuddha was born; but the real site of that prophet's birthplace is, as above shown, extremely doubtful. Buddha was probably a Gautam Rajput; and it is an odd coincidence, through nothing more, that Nagar in the fourteenth century became the capital of a Gautam principality. From that time until 1858 its castle remained the seat of those Gautam rajas who before the dawn of British sway were the practically independent rulers of parganah Nagar. Their history has been told elsewhere. It need only be added that Nagar, which in 1872 had 2,054 inhabitants, stands on the shore of the Chandu lake, 6 miles south-west of Basti; and that it holds a small fair in April-May (Baisakh).\n\nNagar or Aurangabad-Nagar, a parganah of the Haraia and Basti tahsils, is bounded on its convex east-south-eastern side by parganah Mahauli, the Kuana river forming a part of the boundary; on north-by-east by parganah Basti, the Kuana and its affluent, the Rawai, supplying most of the border; on west-north-west by parganah Amorha, the Manwar river being for a short distance the dividing-line; and on south-south-west by the Ghagra river, which severs it from the Faizabad district. Nagar has 12 tappas. Of these the 7 eastern\u2014Dobakhra, Nagar, Kura, Pipra, Pilai, Kanaila, and Kalwari\u2014belong to the Basti tahsil. The western and larger remainder, included in tahsil Haraia, consists of tappas Aujhi, Manwarpura, Nawai, Khuriar, and Ganeshpur. The parganah contains 670 estates (mahal), coinciding as a rule with the same number of parishes (mawza); and of these 348 are in the Haraia tahsil. Nagar had in 1878 an area of 134,524 acres, or nearly 210\u00bd square miles; and a land-revenue of Rs. 1,10,742. Of the former over 115\u00bd miles, and of the latter Rs. 54,341, belong to tahsil Haraia.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Nagar contained 586 inhabited sites, of which 387 had less than 200 inhabitants; 162 between 200 and 500; 28 between 500 and 1,000; 6 between 1,000 and 2,000; and 3 between 2,000 and 3,000.\n\nThe population numbered 124,482 souls (58,673 females), giving 1,199 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 112,164 Hindus, of whom 52,704 were females; 12,317 Musalmans (5,969 females), and one Christian. Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes, the census shows 16,984 Brahmins (8,155 females); 5,878 Rajputs (2,597 females); and 5,352 Banjyas (2,545 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which show a total of 83,950 souls (39,406 females). The principal Brahman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the\n\n1 P. 716. 2 Supra, pp. 679-81.\nSarwaria (8,590), Kananjia (197), Gaur (1,343), Gautam (6), Pande, Sangal-dwipi, Lohma, Gorakhbansi, Kashmiri, Sandel, Niwan, Vasisht, and Pachgoti. The Rajputs belong to the Panwar (35), Bais (241), Gautem (3,354), Parwar (134), Chauhan (60), Surajbansi (289), Bharaddhwaj (3,533), Raghubansi (22), Konohik, Jaiswar, Bachgoti, Bisen, Bhunihar, Mahrawar, and Raikawar clans; the Baniyas to the Agarwal (222), Kasaudhan (1,956), Kandu (559), Agarahri (2,054), Panwar, and Rastogi sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (1,675), Kahar (3,045), Kurmi (13,669), Teli (2,568), Dhobi (2,308), Nai (2,193), Cham\u00e1r (19,916), Ahir (14,372), Barhai (2,150), Lohar (1,729), Kayath (1,447), Tamboli (2,152), Kumhar (2,465), Chai (1,279), Nuniya (1,758), and Kori (1,691): The following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Gadariya, Khewat, Kalwar, Dharkar, Khatik, Bari, Attit, Mali, Sonar, Manibe, Bharbhunja, Gosain, Bairagi, Pasi, Bhat, Khakrob, Thathera, Koli, Lodha, Halwai, Patwa, Kanjar, Bhunihar, Gound, Jat, Bargahi, and Chhipi. The Musalmans are Shaikhs, (991), Pathans (1,328), Sayyids (47), Mughals (16), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 659 belong to the professional class of officials, priests, doctors, and the like; 2,217 to the domestic class, including personal servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,354 to the commercial class, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 28,910 to the agricultural class; and 3,249 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 2,929 persons returned as labourers and 312 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 14,577 as landholders, 80,710 as cultivators, and 30,195 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 438 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 65,309 souls.\n\nNagar slopes gently, with no sudden elevations or depressions, towards the east-south-east. Like the rest of the district, it is one vast mixture of field and fruit grove. Compared with that of surrounding parganahs, its soil is undoubtedly poor. But the poverty is merely comparative, for the average productiveness of the tract is not low. True that the only tappas which can be called pre-eminently fertile are\n\n1 See article on parganah Amorha, \"Population,\" note. 2 Corresponding note to article on pargana Banshi.\nthe southern tappas, Aujhi and Kalwari. But except on the sandy fields of the eastern Kura and Pipra, the crops are everywhere fair. \"The almost unbroken waves of cultivation,\" writes Mr. P. J. White, \"beautiful mango-groves, numerous reservoirs of water, many streams and streamlets; the villages safely enclosed by hedges of cactus and coolly sheltered by a dense shady belt of tamarind, bambu, pipal, or other large trees; cattle dotting the plain amid the limited waste-plots\u2014all combine to give a picturesque beauty and cheerfulness to the physical aspect of the parganah. The contrast is as emphatic as it possibly can be to the dull, bare, arid plains and uncomfortably exposed, hot-looking, red-brick villages of Bundelkhand.\"\n\nThe Ghagra and the Kuana merely bound the parganah. But the Rawai traverses its north-eastern corner, and the Manwar, with an east-south-easterly course, pierces it from end to end; a watercourse called the Manjhauri, an affluent of the Kuana, skirts for some distance the north of tappa Ganeshpur and the parganah. Another called the Machwai passes through the north-western tappas to fall into the Chandu-tal, the greatest of the local lagoons. The surplus waters of this reservoir find their way through an old canal into the Manwar, just below Nagahra village. The Chandu-tal lies in tappa Nagar or Haveli; the next largest lagoons are those at Marhni in tappa Khuriar and Som in tappa Kanaila. All these sheets of water are valuable fisheries. All are sown with water-nuts (singara) and spontaneously produce wild-rice (tina). But many smaller lakelets and ponds are scattered over the face of the country.\n\nIn the divara villages\u2014that is in the tract skirting the Ghagra and subject to its inundations\u2014the climate is unhealthy. Here goitre is not uncommon. About the middle of the parganah, again, on the brink of the Machwai water-course, the population suffers from fever in the months just succeeding the rainy season. But with these exceptions the parganah is fairly salubrious.\n\nThe total cultivated area, 86,465 acres, was at assessment divided into three classes of soil. These were loam or doras (55,792 acres), clay or mattiyar (16,541), and sand or balua (14,132). No less than 75,376 acres of the same area were returned as irrigated from the Manwar, water-courses, lagoons, ponds, and wells. In some other parts of these provinces irrigation from wells is considered the best, and the people ask \"what is better for the crop than the milk of the mother which bore it?\" Here however, being supposed to contain a fertilizing sediment, the water from the four first-named sources is preferred. Water lies at an average depth of less than 22 feet from the surface.\n\nThe area tilled for the spring harvest prevails over that tilled for the autumn harvest in the proportion of about 56 to 30. Roughly noting in\nthousands of acres the spaces occupied by the principal crops of the former, we get: wheat, $2\\frac{1}{2}$; arhar pulse, 9; mixed barley and purple peas (jaukirai), $7\\frac{1}{2}$; barley alone, $4\\frac{1}{2}$; sugarcane, 4; and gram pulse, 4. Marked in the same manner, the chief autumn growths stand as follows: Rices, $14\\frac{1}{2}$; urd or m\u0101sh pulse, $5\\frac{1}{2}$; mothi pulse, $4\\frac{1}{2}$; and kodo millet, $3\\frac{1}{2}$. Amongst the owners of the soils which produce these crops Gautam Rajputs are largely represented. The bulk of tappa Ganeshpur, with a few villages in tappas Dobakhra and Nawai, is held at a small quit-rent by a Musalm\u00e1n family still known as the Pindar\u00e1s. This ta'alluqa was granted to their ancestor Kadir Bakhsh, a Pindari chief whom the British Government wished to provide with sufficient means for a peaceful livelihood (1818-19).\n\nNagar has but one manufacture of any note\u2014the chintz and gilt cloths prepared by the cotton-printers (Chhipi) of Bahadurpur.\n\nEconomical features. These stuffs are extensively sold not only in the district itself, but even in Butwal of Nep\u00e1l. The main trade of the parganah is as usual its trade in grain; but there is also some commerce in home-made or imported cloth, and in imported spices, tobacco, cotton, copper and brass utensils. The principal marts are Bahadurpur, Pandar, Kalwari, and the old parganah capital Nagar, where a small yearly fair is held in April-May. The minor market villages are Behra, Ganeshpur, Gotwa, and Pipra. The larger markets (h\u0101th) are held twice, the smaller once weekly. The large external towns with which the places just named carry on their trade are Menhdawal of Maghar, Bisohar of Bans\u00ed, Belwa of Amorha, and Barhalganj of Gorakhpur. Water communication with the two last is provided by the Ghagra. Navigable also are the Kuana and, in the rainy season, the Manwar. The metalled Basti and Faizabad road spans the north of the parganah, passing the old tahsil capital Captainganj. From it branches near the Basti border an unmetalled line to Tanda of Faizabad. And this second highway is crossed at Kalwari by a third of the same class, running almost parallel to the Ghagra.\n\nThe earliest possession of parganah Nagar is by differing traditions assigned to both the Domkatars and the Bhars. But the aboriginal occupants, whoever they were, seem to have been ejected in the first half of the fourteenth century by Gautam Rajputs. The Gautams fixed their capital at Nagar, and until the rebellion of 1858 supplied the parganah with a raja. But though a separate principality, the tract does not appear under its own name in Akbar's Institutes (1596). It is generally identified with Rihlapara or Kihlapara, a parganah which that work places in the Gorakhpur\n\n1 Supra p. 398.\ndistrict (dast\u00e1r) and division (sark\u00e1r) of the Oudh province (s\u00faba). Since the beginning of the eighteenth century Nagar has passed through much the same vicissitudes as other parts of the district. It was usurped by the Oudh Viceroys of the Dehli emperors, and by its Oudh rulers was ceded to the British (1801). The land-taxes assessed at successive British settlements were:\u2014in 1803, Rs. 58,784; in 1806, Rs. 54,970; Rs. 55,483 in 1809; Rs. 54,243 in 1813; in 1840, Rs. 76,796; and in 1865 Rs. 1,17,814. The great increase since 1813 will not fail to arrest attention; for it means a vast advance in tillage as well as in State income. It is well that the parganah was not permanently settled three years earlier, when the Collector reported that cultivation was sufficiently extensive to justify such treatment.\n\nNagar seems indeed to have been cleared of forests earlier than the more northern parganahs of the district. In 1814 Buchanan describes \"the plantations as moderate, although many still are superfluous.\" The only antiquities which he mentions are the r\u00e1ja's castle at Nagar and the fortifications of Ganeshpur; the latter consisting as usual of a ditch, an earthen rampart, and a bambu hedge.\n\nNarkatha, a village in tappa Chanr of parganah and tahsil B\u00e1nsi, stands on the north or left bank of the R\u00e1pti river, some 33 miles north-north-east of Basti. Just opposite on the southern bank rises the town of B\u00e1nsi, whereof Narkatha may perhaps be considered a suburb. On the ferry which connects the village with the town converge two unmetalled roads from the north.\n\nNarkatha is remarkable for its population, which in 1872 numbered 3,808; and also as the present seat of the B\u00e1nsi r\u00e1jas. Scared out of Bansi-castle by the malevolent ghost of a Br\u00e1hman, they about 1760 migrated across the river and built here a new house. This at first consisted of an one-storied mud-built quadrangle flanked by two-storied towers of the same material. But for mud has since been substituted brick.\n\nPaikaulia, a village in tappa Ratanpur of parganah Basti and tahsil Haraia, forms the extreme end of the wedge between the Raw\u00e1i river and a southern tributary. Standing on a cart-track, 73 miles west-north-west of Basti, it had in 1872 a population of 498.\n\nHere are a third-class police-station and a district post-office. Paikaulia was in 1814 the only place in the parganah, except Basti, which could be\n\n---\n\n1 Letter in Board's Records, 9th March, 1810.  \n2 His description applies more strictly to the police circle of Mah\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1r, which almost, however, coincided with the existing parganah. The head-quarters of the circle, Mah\u00fad\u00e1b\u00e1r village, was destroyed during the Mutiny, and must not be confused with the small mart thus called in tappa Atroh of parganah Basti. The name simply means \"the pool of mah\u00fad trees;\" and should be common enough in a district where both mah\u00fads and pools are numerous.  \n3 Eastern India, II., 396.\ncalled a town. But its commercial importance, if it ever possessed any, has declined.\n\n**Parasrampur**, a village in tappa Bangawan of pargana Amorha and tahsil Haraia, is remarkable only as the site of a third-class police-station. The population amounted in 1872 to 332 persons only. The distance west-north-west of Basti is about 30 miles as the crow flies; for no road has as yet reached the village.\n\n**Rasulpur**, or Rasulpur-Ghaus, a parganah of the Domariaganj tahsil, is bounded on the east by parganah Bansi; on north-east-by-north again by Bansi, the Paras\u00ed and Ikr\u00e1ri watercourses supplying a partial boundary; on its jagged west-south-western side by the Gonda district, from which it is severed chiefly by the R\u00e1pti and Ku\u00e1na rivers; on south-east-by-south by parganahs Basti and Maghar. Rasulpur is sub-divided into 8 tappas, called Awania, Karhi, Halaur, Sagara, Chhapia, Adampur, Bh\u00e1npur, and Sehari. It contains 727 estates (mah\u00e1l), coinciding as a rule with the same number of parishes (mausa). The parganah had in 1878 an area of 211,275 acres, or somewhat over 330 square miles; and a land revenue (excluding cesses) of Rs. 1,53,191.\n\nAccording to the census of 1872, parganah Rasulpur contained 645 inhabited sites, of which 347 had less than 200 inhabitants; 239 between 200 and 500; 49 between 500 and 1,000, and 10 between 1,000 and 2,000.\n\nThe population numbered 164,101 souls (76,951 females), giving 495 to the square mile. Classified according to religion there were 126,275 Hind\u00fas, (59,109 females); and 37,826 Musalm\u00e1ns (17,842 females). Distributing the Hindu population among the four great classes the census shows 17,384 Br\u00e1hmans (8,172 females); 2,557 R\u00e1jputs (1,127 females); and 4,253 Baniy\u00e1s (2,025 females); whilst the great mass of the population is included in the \"other castes,\" which shew a total of 102,081 souls (47,785 females). The principal Br\u00e1hman sub-divisions found in this parganah are the Sarwaria (2,565), Kanaujia (947), Gaur (303), Gautam (10), P\u00e1nde, Sangaldw\u00edpi, Shukul, Tiw\u00e1ri, and Misr. The R\u00e1jputs belong to the Panw\u00e1r (60), Bais (906), Gautam (49), Parw\u00e1r (21), Chauh\u00e1n (238), S\u00farajbansi (123), Bh\u00e1radhw\u00e1j (3), R\u00e1ghubansi (113), Kulh\u00e1ns, Chandrabansi, and Barg\u00fajar clans; the Baniy\u00e1s to the Agarw\u00e1l (294), Kasaundhan (1,555), K\u00e1ndu (82), Agarahri (1,713), Dasa, and Bandarw\u00e1r sub-divisions. Those of the other castes which exceed in number one thousand souls each are the Bhar (1,569), Kah\u00e1r (3,228), Kurmi,\n\n---\n\n1 *Eastern India*, II., 390. The areas described by Buchanan were police circles. But this Basti police circle corresponded pretty closely with the modern parganah.\n(10,060), Teli (2,622), Dhobi (2,203), N\u00e1\u00ed (1,481), Cham\u00e1r (22,999); Ahir (16,424), Gadiya (1,079), Barhai (3,615), Loh\u00e1r (1,781), K\u00e1yath (3,457), Khewat (1,291), Tamboli (2,516), Kalw\u00e1r (1,185), Kumh\u00e1r (2,948), Ch\u00e1i (1,587), M\u00e1li (7,865), Sun\u00e1r (1,200), Nuniya (2,457), Koli (1,409), and Arakh (1,477).\n\nThe following have less than one thousand members each:\u2014Dhark\u00e1r, Khatik, B\u00e9ri, Atft, Manibe, Bharbh\u00fanja, Gos\u00e1n, Bair\u00e1gi, P\u00e1s\u00ed, Bh\u00e1t, Kh\u00e1krob, Tha-thera, Lodha, R\u00e9jbhar, Halw\u00e1\u00ed, Patwa, Kanjar, Dh\u00e1rhi, Dhuna, J\u00e1t, Orh, and Nat. The Musalm\u00e1ns are Shaikhs (6,919), Sayyids (1,745), Path\u00e1ns (1,594), Mughals (193), and unspecified.\n\nThe occupations of the people are shown in the statistics collected at the same census. From these it appears that of the male adult population (not less than 15 years of age), 341 belong to the professional class of officials, doctors, and the like; 2,841 to the domestic class, which includes servants, water-carriers, barbers, sweepers, washermen, &c.; 1,121 to the commercial, comprising bankers, carriers, and tradesmen of all sorts; 37,385 to the agricultural class; and 4,889 to the industrial or artisan. A sixth or indefinite class includes 4,137 persons returned as labourers and 640 as of no specified occupation. Taking the total population, irrespective of age or sex, the same returns give 13,214 as landholders, 1,09,477 as cultivators, and 41,410 as engaged in occupations unconnected with agriculture. The educational statistics, which are confessedly imperfect, show 708 as able to read and write out of a total male population numbering 87,150 souls.\n\nThe parganah is a level tract of ploughed fields interspersed with mango-groves. Turning eastwards across it after forming the Gonda border, the R\u00e1pti divides it into two not very unequal portions. But to the bed of that river the country slopes upwards rather than downwards. The R\u00e1pti seems to flow rather along the ridge of a watershed than in any depressed basin. And, except for a short distance along the northern bank, it receives almost none of the parganah drainage.\n\nThe remaining streams, rising near the R\u00e1pti and flowing away from it, suggest the idea of escape channels from that river. The surplus water of the northern tappas is carried off by the Par\u00e1si and its affluent, the Ikr\u00e1ri water-course, which, as already noted, supply for some distance the northern border. The southern tappas are drained into the Ku\u00e1na, which rises in the next district; into the Ami, which rises within the parganah; and into the Rih\u00e1wa watercourse, another home-bred stream which replenishes the Ku\u00e1na. The banks of these smaller rivers \"consist to a considerable distance of the most\n\n---\n\n1 See article on parganah Amorha, \"Population,\" note.\nimpracticable soil, very hard and often covered by a saline efflorescence that stops almost all vegetation.\"\u00b9 The Ku\u00e1na is fringed as usual with a stretch of scrubwood; but the parganah can boast no nearer approach to a forest.\n\nOf lagoons it has a large allowance. The greatest is the Pathra-t\u00e1l, which lies partly in tappa Sagara and partly in parganah B\u00e1nsi. Next in size are the Sewand and In\u00e1war t\u00e1lis of tappa Awainia, the Pipr\u00e1hia-t\u00e1l of tappa Chapiya, and two other sheets of water not far south-west of the Pathra-t\u00e1l itself. The field irrigation is of two kinds: by lift from lagoons and ponds and by lever and pot from wells. The latter method is seldom adopted except for the sake of the rarer and more valuable crops, such as poppy, sugarcane, and vegetables. But as water lies but 15 or 16 feet from the surface, lever-wells could, if needed, be dug on a far larger scale. Of the 141,379 acres returned at assessment (1863) as cultivated, 105,201 were also returned as watered.\n\nThe areas recorded as tilled for the different harvests were: for that of the spring 80,362 acres; for that of the autumn, 56,225; and for that of the transplanted winter rice, 30,784. Noting roughly in thousands of acres the space occupied by each of the principal spring crops, we get: wheat, 19; barley, 8\u00bd; arhar pulse, 6\u00bd; lentils (mas\u00far), 5; and mustard 3\u00bc. Marked in the same manner, the chief autumn growths stand in the following order:\u2014Broadcast rice, 19\u00bd; and urd or m\u0101sh pulse, 3\u00bc. But these figures show only the area temporarily monopolised by each crop; and except wheat, they are all sometimes mixed in the same field or followed in the same field and year by other staples. Let us take as an instance a spring crop not hitherto mentioned. Peas when grown alone occupy a comparatively small area, but when mixed with other crops have a large share in over 11,000 acres.\n\nThe soils which produce these crops are as usual divided into sandy (balua), clayey (mattiy\u00e1r), and loamy (dor\u00e1s). The sandy mould is of course unmistakeable; but the criterion which the assessment surveyors adopted for the distinction of clay and loam is very far from apparent. The difference between these two soils, writes Mr. Wynne, is \"absolutely inappreciable.\" But to the natural composition of the earth they plough the people themselves pay no heed. To them all soil is goenr, miy\u00e1na, or pallu: that is \"near the village,\" \"midland,\" and \"farthest from the village.\" A large proportion of the goenr lands are planted with mango-groves, which occupy .043 of the total cultivated area.\n\nTo plant such giant orchards has always been deemed a peculiarly meritorious action. The merit is perhaps greater because the fruit, being far more\n\n\u00b9 Mr. Wynne's Settlement Report (para. 2).\nthan sufficient for the planter's own family, is as a rule distributed gratis amongst the villagers. It is hardly necessary to note that the planter is almost always the village landlord. The landlords of Ras\u00falpur are chiefly Br\u00e1hmans and R\u00e1jputs. Next after long intervals stand K\u00e1yaths and Musalm\u00e1ns, Baniy\u00e1s and the monastic orders; whilst the rest belong to miscellaneous and generally lower castes. During the currency of the last settlement (1840-62) the villages in the hands of the trading community, a term which includes money-lending Br\u00e1hmans, increased largely. The tenures are mostly of the kinds known as perfect pattid\u00e1ri and zamind\u00e1ri, while the birt holdings are comparatively few. Amongst the tenantry the Musalm\u00e1ns, Kurmis, Koeris, Mur\u00e1os, and Lodhs are conspicuous as well for their numbers as for the excellence of their cultivation.\n\nIts cultivation is Ras\u00falpur's only remarkable industry. Its manufactures are almost limited to the necessaries of life, as that term is understood by a clownish folk spending most of their time out of doors. But even of these necessaries some are imported. Though the preparation of saltpetre is allowed, salt must be brought from elsewhere; and a considerable portion of the cloth and the metal vessels used is foreign. It may be noted that the principal mart for salt is Bay\u00e1ra of tappa Bh\u00e1npur. For the sale of the agricultural raw produce, which is the parganah's one important merchandise, weekly markets are held in many obscure villages. Such are Chaukanda of tappa Karhi, Bhaw\u00e1n\u00edganj of tappa Bh\u00e1npur, and Bhagobhar of tappa Sagara. The yearly fairs of Bh\u00e1ri in Sagara, Halaur in the tappa of that ilk, and Katesarn\u00e1th in Karhi, provide an occasional opportunity of buying and selling all commodities for which any demand exists. But there are a few marts of a somewhat more than merely local ambition\u2014marts which export to other parganahs and districts a little sugar and a great deal of grain. Amongst these may be mentioned Singarjot, Bh\u00edtaria, Bharautia, Gaura, and T\u00edghra, all on the R\u00e1pti. Their exports wend as a rule down-stream, to Barhaj of Gorakhpur; but the exports of all together are not equal to those of Uska, in\n\n1 Bair\u00e1g\u00eds and Gos\u00e1ins. 2 Supra, pp. 669-71. 3 The fair at Bh\u00e1ri has been mentioned in a separate article. The Katesarn\u00e1th assembly, held in honour of Mah\u00e1deo or Shiva, lasts for about a fortnight in February-March (Ph\u00e1lgun). Taking place on the very moveable Muhammadan feast of Muhurr\u00e1m, the Halaur gathering may according to the year take place in any one of the English months. It is held at the shrine (dargh\u00e1) of a saint named Hazrat Shah Sayyid Abd-ur-Ras\u00fal, who is said to have come from Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n in the reign of Alamgir (1658-1707). He planted here a sacred tree whose leaves and fruits visitors to the shrine carry off as relics (tabarr\u00fak). Over 1,000 Sayyids, claiming kinship with this 'Prophet of Khur\u00e1s\u00e1n,' divide the proceeds of the five revenue-free villages with which that shrine is endowed. These men are found all over the country, from Dehli to Bih\u00e1r, in every position and in every employment. But they still cling tenaciously to the infinitesimal and constantly diminishing dividends which mark their connection with a locally famous man.\nthe neighbouring B\u0101nsi. The taluk capital Domari\u0101ganj, also on the R\u0101pti, has perhaps a rich commercial future. The only obstacle which, in Mr. Wynne's opinion, prevents it from rivalling Ueka and becoming a first-rate grain mart is the want of local enterprise. He adds that the R\u0101pti is even now easily navigable; and that with a little care in removing sunken trees it might become a channel of communication not often equalled in the country. The Ku\u0101na also is navigable. The principal road of the parganah is the unmetalled line from Basti to Nep\u00e1l, by way of Domari\u0101ganj. This, which passes near Chaukanda and Katesarnath, is quitted south of the R\u0101pti by two easterly branches; north of the R\u0101pti by a north-westerly branch, near which stands Singarjot. But these branches, like the trunk itself, are unmetalled.\n\nThe parganah derives its name from Ras\u016blpur on the R\u0101pti, in tappa Halaur. In the first half of the fourteenth century History. it was still held by the Dom or Domkat\u0101r r\u0101ja of Gonda. But the territories of this aboriginal or half-aboriginal ruler were about that time annexed by the Kulh\u0101ns R\u0101jputs. The power of the Kulh\u0101ns tribe gradually dwindled until they had lost their domains in Gonda, and until their domains in this district had become divided into the two separate principalities of Ras\u016blpur and Basti. There is still a Kulh\u0101ns r\u0101ja of Basti. But about 1700 Ras\u016blpur was seized and the Kulh\u0101ns ejected by the B\u0101nsi r\u0101ja, chief of the Sarnet R\u0101jputs.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1596 and the Domesday-book of the emperor Akbar, Ras\u016blpur had been entered as a part of the Gorakhpur district (dast\u016br), Gorakhpur division (sark\u0101r), and Oudh province (s\u016bba). But the imperial rule was never very strong in this part of the country; and it was not till about 1720, when the Vicecroy of Oudh assumed independence, that the local r\u0101ja really felt his sway questioned by any superior power. Even then the B\u0101nsi r\u0101ja remained the great magnate. But in 1801 the parganah was ceded by Oudh to the East India Company, and the dominion of petty local rulers gave place to that of a strong central government. The demands assessed on the parganah at successive British settlements of land revenue were:\u2014 in 1803, Rs. 43,230; in 1806, Rs. 37,227; Rs. 50,135 in 1809; Rs. 62,456 in 1813; in 1840, Rs. 1,28,343; and in 1862, Rs. 1,50,251.\n\nThere are as usual few remains of antiquarian interest. Buchanan mentions Antiquities. mounds of broken brick attributed to the Th\u0101rus at Bh\u0101ri (q. v.) and at a village called \"the Elephant's Trunk\" (Hathsari or Hast\u012bsanda). Now at this village is said to have dwelt a Th\u0101ru chief or demigod named Samaya; and in the ruins of a temple called\nSamayasth\u00e1n, at another village called Penriya, was discovered during 1813 an image which was supposed to represent him. The sculpture differed little from those which, found in similar spots, are called Chaturbuj, Lachhm\u00ednar\u00e1yan, Gaj\u00e9dhar, and Basdeo (Vasudeva). There is some reason, therefore, to suspect, argues Buchanan, that such idols are in fact representations of the Samaya Devata of the Th\u00e1rus. \"The name implies\\(^1\\) the deity of the reason, time, or opportunity. In the present system, however, a goddess presides over the seasons (K\u00e1l\u00e1r\u00fapini).\" At Jamohana near Bh\u00e1npur\\(^2\\) were found some 11 years earlier two images named R\u00e1m and Lachhman. But there was some reason to suspect that the Br\u00e1hman who professed to have ploughed them up had in reality brought them from elsewhere, with a view of trading on their sanctity. The remains of several petty castles built by the Kulh\u00e1ns R\u00e1jputs and their successors, the Sarnets, are antiquities more undoubtedly genuine.\n\nRudhauli, the village which gives its name to tappa Rudhauli of parganah Maghar and tahsil Basti, stands besides the unmetalled Basti and B\u00e1nsi road, 19 miles north-by-east of the former town. It in 1872 had 2,092 inhabitants. Near it flows the river \u00c1mi; and near it is still left a considerable remnant of ancient woodland.\n\nRudhauli has a second-class police-station and a district post-office. It is the head village of a tract known as the Bajhera, which about 1300 was granted to the ancestor of its present landlords by r\u00e1ja Jai Singh of Maghar. The original grantee, Bijai Singh, is said to have been a brother of the grantor; and his descendants have sometimes been accused of turbulence. The Bajhera includes many villages in Ras\u00falpur as well as in Maghar.\n\nSirsi, in tappa Sirsi of parganah Mahauli and tahsil Khalilabad, is the scene of a large yearly fair. This, which takes place in March-April, is called the Makhaura, and has an estimated attendance of 10,000. The actual and permanent population of the village was in 1872 returned as only 365. That village stands on the right bank of the Ku\u00e1na, about 36 miles south-east of Basti.\n\nSit\u00e1r\u00e1mpur or Sit\u00e1r\u00e1mpur-Baburi, a village in tappa Belwa of pargana Amorha and tahsil Harais, is remarkable for the same reason as the place last mentioned. Standing on the banks of the Gh\u00e1gra, opposite Ajudhya of Faizabad, it is traversed by the metalled Gorakhpur and Faizabad road, which crosses the river by ferry. The distance west of Basti is 30 miles. The village had in 1873 only 1,387 inhabitants. But it boasts two great annual fairs, held ostensibly for the purpose of religious bathing in the river. The first, named\n\n---\n\n\\(^1\\) In Sanskrit and Hindi, which were probably unknown to the ancient Th\u00e1rus.  \n\\(^2\\) Jamohana and Bh\u00e1npur are neighbouring villages in tappas Adampur and Chhapia respectively.\nKamki-k\u00e1-Nih\u00e1n, takes place on the full-moon of K\u00e1rttik (October-November), and is attended by about 100,000 visitors. The second meeting is held in Chait (March-April), and has an estimated attendance of 10,000 only.\n\nTama, another village with a large yearly fair, lies in tappa south Haveli of pargana Maghar and tahsil Khafiabad. The distance east-by-south of Basti is 25 miles; and the population amounted in 1872 to 197.\n\nThe fair is held on the Shi\u00far\u00e1ttiri festival in February-March, and lasts for that one day only. The attendance is variously reckoned at from 9,000 to 40,000; but the business transacted is insignificant, being almost limited to the sale of sweetmeats. The primary object of the meeting is worship at the temple of Shiva. Legend relates that in the woody waste-lands which then surrounded the village sprang up many hundred years ago a phallus (pindi), the sacred emblem of that god. Discovered by shepherds who were grazing their flock, it has ever since been worshipped. Round the place of discovery was built a raised plinth, but for years no temple rose to shelter the miraculous stone. The defect was at last remedied by a r\u00e1ja of B\u00e1nsi, who constructed not only a temple but also a tank, a flight of steps descending thereto, and a masonry well. He, moreover, planted a mango-grove, placed some Gos\u00e1ins from Anola of Gorakhpur in charge of the temple, and endowed it with the whole village. The grant was at first untaxed; but in 1838-39 it was resumed by the British Government, the Gos\u00e1ins being admitted to engage for the revenue.\n\nTiokpur, a village in tappa Budhi of parganah B\u00e1nsi and tahsil Domari\u00e1ganj, lies about 44 miles north-north-west of Basti, but is approached by no road. It had in 1872 but 201 inhabitants, and is noticed merely as the site of a third-class police-station.\n\nUska, a flourishing mart in tappa Nagwa of parganah and tahsil B\u00e1nsi, stands on the right or western bank of the Dhamela, 50 miles north-east of Basti. The name of Uska belongs more strictly to a village on the opposite side of the river, in tappa Unt\u00e9p\u00e1r, but is now applied to the cluster of shops and houses which has sprung up on the lands of Parti, Rehra, and Mughalha villages. In 1872 the population of Uska proper amounted to 501 persons; that of united Parti, Rehra, and Mugh\u00e1lha to 2,711.\n\nThe market lies on the unmetalled route from Nep\u00e1l to Gorakhpur, by way of Dundumwa in this district. It is, moreover, built beside a stream which up to this point is navigable throughout the year. To these two circumstances Uska owes its great and increasing prosperity. It is one of the chief emporia\n\n1246 of the harvest area.\nfor merchandise passing between Nep\u00e1l and these provinces. Its exports and imports are those already enumerated in the article on the more northern Lautan (q. v.). But it is specially remarkable as the centre to which gravitates most of the Nep\u00e1lese mustard and Nep\u00e1lese fibre manufactures. It has a large export trade, not only in the grain of Nep\u00e1l, but also in that of the surrounding British territory. Consisting chiefly of unhulled rice, this grain is sent down the Dhamela and R\u00e1pti to Barhaj of Gorakhpur. Towards the close of the hot season, when the Dhamela begins to shallow, this journey is broken. As far as Moh\u00e1na, at the mouth of that river, the cargoes travel in small canoes, and are thence reshipped, in larger vessels, to accomplish the second stage. The agents employed in the exportation are known as tattidd\u00e1rs. In 1864, Mr. Wynne calculated that about 2,160 boatsearly conveyed about 648,000 maunds of grain from Uska down to Barhaj. The Uska registration post of the Agriculture and Commerce Department registered, in 1878-79, a greater amount of traffic with Nep\u00e1l than any similar office in the district. The total value of goods passing to or from that country was reckoned at Rs. 5,04,475. Uska has, besides this registration post, a third-class police-station, and an imperial post-office.\n\nThe market was founded about 45 years ago by Mr. Oelsen, a Danish grantee of waste-lands. The name Uska is perhaps a corruption of Oelsen-ka, or Oelsen\u2019s. The n may have become nasal and disappeared; the second vowel, being thus left unprotected, may have followed it. While chief officer of the district Mr. Percy Wigram suggested that the importance of the mart and the magnitude of its trade would justify the creation of a municipal committee and the imposition of an octroi-tax. But Uska is eminently an emporium, a town through which goods pass on their way to other markets. Any tax which in default of close supervision tended to become a transit duty would damage its prosperity. And it is perhaps for this reason that Mr. Wigram\u2019s proposition has as yet borne no fruit.\n\nEND OF VOLUME VI.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-04", "created": "2025-10-04", "metadata":
