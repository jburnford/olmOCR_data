Cotes exhibited a gold medal of the old College of Fort William.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. The original Rajah of Rajshaye: A forgotten episode in the history of Bengal.\u2014By H. Beveridge, Esq., C. S., with a note on the etymologies of Ambar and Rajshaye.\u2014By E. McL. Smith, Esq., Sub-divisional Officer of Pakour.\n\nIt is singular how the name Rajshaye has become transferred to a district east of the Ganges. In Rennell's Atlas it is marked as lying on the west bank, and as covering a large part of what is now Murshidabad. Grant, in his analysis of the revenues in the Fifth Report, tells\nus that Udai Narain, the original owner of Rajshaye, committed suicide, and that thereupon Murshid Quli Khan conferred his estates on the Nattore family. The estates seem to have been on the west side of the Ganges, and in what is now the Pakour Sub-division of the Sonthal Parganas. Perhaps it was their transfer to a family residing east of the Ganges which caused the name Rajshaye to be given to the present district of Rajshaye. Formerly it was known as Nattore or as Lashkarpur, and Bhituria. The name Rajshaye still adheres to the west side of the Ganges as that of a pargana. The Statistical Account of Bengal does not mention Rajshaye among the parganas on fiscal divisions of the district of Rajshaye, but includes in the lists of parganas for Birbhum and Murshidabad. In fact, however, pargana Rajshaye lies chiefly in the Sonthal Parganas, viz. in sub-division Pakour.*\n\nMr. Blochmann suggested that the name was connected with Rajah Kans or Gonesh, and alluded to his being half Hindu and half Muhammadan. It meant, he thought, the Rajah who was also a Sh\u00e1h, and observed that otherwise the compound was inapplicable. The hypothesis of a connection with Rajah Kans is, I think, inadmissible, for the name is comparatively modern, and was originally given, as we have seen, to a tract of country far away from Rajah Kans's territory of Bhituria, and on the other side of the Ganges or Padma Buti. Mr. Blochmann's remark may still be a key to the etymology. It is quite possible that the name alludes to the Rajahs of Birbhum who were originally Hindus. According to tradition the old Hindu family was supplanted by a couple of Afghan adventurers. But, even if this was the case, the members of the new dynasty also called themselves Rajahs, and their wives Ranis, and perhaps the true version is that given by the translator of Siyar Mutakherin when he says that the Rajahs of Birbhum were converts from Hinduism. It was a practice with Murshid Quli Khan to compel Hindu zamindars who fell into arrears of revenue to turn Muhammadans, and perhaps this is what happened to the Rajahs of Birbhum.\n\nIn the Riyaz-us-Salatin, p. 256, it is stated that Udai Narain was zamindar of Chakla Rajshaye in the time of Murshid Quli Khan. Udai Narain, the writer says, was an up-countryman and an able man and in charge of the Khalsa or Exchequer collections. He had 200 horsemen which were commanded by one Ghulam Muhammad. He rebelled and Murshid Quli sent his chela or disciple, Muhammad Jan against him with an army. A battle took place near Udai Narain's palace, and\n\n* In the Pandit's Chronicle, App. D. of the Rural Annals of Bengal, Birbhum is described, as bounded on the east by Rajshaye. This must be the original Rajshaye.\nGhulam Muhammad was killed. Thereafter, Udai Narain being in fear of Murshid Quli's displeasure committed suicide, and Murshid Quli gave the zamindari to Ram Jivan and Kala Kuar of Nattore. The story is told somewhat differently in the Narrative of Transactions in Bengal, translated by Gladwin. It is stated there, p. 61, that Udai Narain's family had long enjoyed the zamindari of Rajshaye, and that as Udai Narain had the management of the Khalsa collections Murshid Quli had placed under his orders Ghulam Muhammad jemadar with 200 horse. Ghulam Muhammad demanded his pay in a riotous manner, and Murshid Quli sent an army to punish him. In the battle that ensued Ghulam Muhammad was killed, and then Udai Narain committed suicide. I think that there is some confusion here. Probably Ghulam Muhammad demanded his pay from Udai Narain, and Murshid Quli sent troops to support him, and not to act against him.\n\nNeither of the above accounts tells us when the battle took place, further than that they say it was near the Rajbari. But this defect is supplied by the Chronicle of the Family of Raja Krishna Chandra of Nadiya, which has been edited and translated by Dr. Pertsch (Berlin, 1852). The story of the fight with Udai Narain is told there with great detail. At p. 41 of the translation we read as follows:\n\n\"At this time it happened that all kings having been one after another taken prisoners by J\u00e1far Khan, governor of Murshidabad, by the employment of treachery, Raghub\u00e1ma was present then in the city to attend upon his father who was likewise in prison. Just then the governor sent a General called L\u00e9hari Malla with a great army against Udayar\u00e1ja, king of R\u00e9j\u00e1s\u00e1r, who in consequence of a quarrel with the governor had taken his position with a considerable force near the village Virak\u00e1ti.\"\n\nThe date is not given, but it appears that the occurrence was before 1710.\n\nThere can be no doubt that Virak\u00e1ti is the same as Birk\u00e1ti, the Birkooty of Rennell, and which he places in Awmore (Ambar). I applied for information on the subject to my friend Mr. Carstairs, the Deputy Commissioner of the Sonthal Parganas, and he kindly inquired through the sub-divisional officer of Pakour. The latter gentleman Mr. E. McL. Smith, has sent me the following valuable note:\n\n\"The village Birkhiti derives its name from the Sanscrit word, Bir valour and Khiti land, i.e., the land of the brave (the same as Birbhum, bhu, bhum, or bh\u00e9m means land). In Sonthali bir means jungle and kati, clearing, but this village did not take its name from any sonthal word as it has been in existence long before the santhals emigrated into the country\u2014it is situated on the south-east of Mohespur and west of Murawi, and is in the Bengali tract of Pargana Sultanabad; the inhabitants are Mahomedans and Hindus, the former preponderate. In the 17th\u2020\n\n\u2020 It should rather be the 18th century.\ncentury Udai Narain was the Rajah of the country, his Rajbari was at Dehinagar, which is on the west of Birkhiti, and about 8 miles from it, he had fortresses at Dumdama (formerly called Jaggannathpur). Birkhiti and Naraingor\u2014all being on a line with Debinagor (the distance from Birkhiti to Naraingor being about 6\u00bd miles, and from Naraingor to Debinagor about 1\u00bd mile, it is possible that the village Dumdama or Jaggannathpur did not exist in those days, and that the portion now within Dumdama was in Birkhiti. There was also a fortress at Garbari, north of Birkhiti, but it is not known whether it was in existence in Udai Narain's time.\n\nThe soil in Dumdama and Birkhiti, where these trenches were excavated, is hard laterite, no bricks appear to have been used in these two places; the former appears to have been composed of earthen breast works forming a large square within which was a smaller square (a Pir's grave which is now in the centre, is kept in repairs by the Hindu zemindar, offerings are made at it both by Mussalmans and Hindus) the latter is much higher, but smaller in size, and the moats are deeper. The Rajah is supposed to have kept his treasure in the smaller entrenchment (the centre is now dotted with holes said to have been made by people in search of silver), but his forces remained in the larger one, which commanded the plains in front, as well as over-looked the outpost which was pushed out on a hillock on the side of a road leading from Murshidabad; a battle was fought in the plains close to this hillock (hence it is called to this day, \"Murmuriadanga,\" field of skulls or \"Munda Mala,\" garland of heads) between Murshid Quli Khan and Rajah Udai Narain in which the latter was victorious, the former sent a large force to subjugate him, fearing that another encounter might be disastrous to him. Udai Narain and his family entered a boat and drowned themselves in the centre of a lake, in Debinagor, which still exists. To this day cultivators find bullets-sling, stones and pellets made of burnt clay lying about in Birkhiti.\n\nThere is no village called Rajshaye in Pargana Sultanabad, but Pargana Rajshaye adjoins Sultanabad, and a village called Kanakpur is not far from the spot where the battle referred to above, was fought, a large tract of country beyond the borders of Sultanabad, which is now in Pargana Rajshaye belonged to Udai Narain. In a village called Kulla 6 miles north-east of Birkhiti, there is a tank called Kodar Roidighi, an outpost is said to have existed on its mound. Kodar Roi belonged to the family of Udai Narain, many tanks here are named after him. There is a detached village of Pargana Sultanabad called Rajbari on the south of Muraroi, and west of the Railway lines, it is about 6 miles from Birkhiti, but the people do not think any battle was fought there.\"\n\nIt will thus be seen how very remote from the present district of Rajshaye was the original pargana or chakla of that name. No doubt Murshid Quli had more trouble with the landholders on the west of the Ganges such as the Rajahs of Birbhum, and Rajshaye than with those on the east bank. The latter were under better discipline because the country was less hilly and wooded, and because it had been controlled from Dacca. The Persian work already referred to as having been translated by Gladwin, says that after Udai Narain had killed himself \"The zamudari of Rajshaye was then conferred upon Ramjewun and Kanookhanwar, two zamindars on the east side of the Ganges, in consideration of their having been more exact in the payment of their rents than the other zamindars of Bengal.\"\nThe name Ambar, as that of a pargana is the Sonthal Parganas, is interesting, as it seems to be a relic of the name Andambar which was a synonyme for Sarkar Tandar. Perhaps the first syllable is from Udai which may have been a family name of the Rajahs. The name Udai also may explain the title, land of Oedapore, given in Broucke's Map to the west side of the Bh\u00e1girath\u00ed. Ambar means a store house in Hindi so that the whole name may signify the storehouse and treasury of Udai. There is, however, also the direction from a species of big tree which has been mentioned by Sir A. Cunningham. Ambar is mentioned in the Ain Akbari, p. 403 as a Mehal, but it is placed in Sarkar Pinjra. In Rennell's Atlas, it appears under the spelling Awmore.\n\nIt may here be remarked that a difficulty occurs in identifying the names in Todar Mall's lists with those in Hunter owing to the fact that the former includes bazars and fisheries as well as tracts of country. In old revenue language all sources of income were called Mehals. It appears too that the distribution of Bengal into Sarkars was sometimes very arbitrary (perhaps from want of knowledge and want of maps) though it generally proceeded in second era with geography. For instance, though Sarkar Jinnatabad or Zahhnanta was for the most part confined to the east and north of the Ganges, yet we find Handoor in it, and even Garhi, i.e., Teliyagarhi which is south of the Ganges and a few miles east of Sahibganj, and which was known in Abul Fazl's time as the door of Bengal.\n\nNote by Mr. E. McL. Smith.\n\nPargana Ambar does not exist in the neighbourhood of Birkhiti, but is about 18 miles from its borders. Birkhiti is in Pargana Sultanabad and so are the villages Dumdama, Naraingor and Debinagor. Pargana Sultanabad adjoins on the east, Pargana Rajshaye, a village in Rajshaye called Kanakpur, is about half mile east of the battle-field referred to in my notes.\n\nPargana Ambar adjoins Pargana Sultanabad on the south. The last A in \u00c2mb\u00e2r is short. In a document of the year 1755 A.D. the name is entered as Ambari (i.e. \u00c2m-b\u00e2r\u00ee, a Mango garden, named after the numerous mango trees planted by the early settlers) and contracted to Ambar; it is sometimes pronounced by Bengalis \u00c2m\u00f4ir, as in Sanskrit the vowels o (\u0913) and u (\u0909) and the consonant b (\u092c) often change places, hence in Ambar, the letter b has been changed to o, and the akar in the joined letter \u0905\u092e\u094d has been dropped, thus the word \u0905\u092e\u094d\u092c\u0930\u093f is often pronounced \u0905\u092e\u094b\u0930\u093f or \u0905\u092e\u094b\u0930\u0941, possibly this is how it came to be written in Rennell's Atlas as Aumori, only Sonthals pronounce it as Amb\u00e1r\u2014a long.\nNo one can give me any information as regards the origin of the names Ambar and Audner and Rajshaye. Shaye was a title conferred by the Emperor of Delhi on one of the proprietors of Ambar, whose successors assumed it, till the time of the British accession, when the title, being no longer recognised by the Government, was retained as an appendage after the name (instead of as a prefix, as formerly) of each male descendent, who succeeded to the Zemindari, the last holder of the name having died without any male issue, the affix was dropped by his successors. The Ambar family had no connection with Rajshaye, but possibly the first proprietor of that Pargana similarly held the title of Shaye, as Rajshaye means dominion of a prince. Udai Narain was an up-country Kayastha, and is spoken of here as Lala Udai Narain.\n\n2. Notes on some old Mughal Mint Towns.\u2014By W. Irvine, Esq.\n\nOn p. 114 of the Proceedings of the Society for August 1891 (received by me a month or two ago) Dr. Hoernle expressed a doubt as to the identity of Aurangzeb's mint town Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d. I would suggest that it was the town of that name, the capital of \u0160\u00fabah Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d Bidar in the Dakkin. On page 62 of the index to the Ma'asir-i-'\u00c1lamg\u00edr\u00ed in the Bibliotheca Indica, there will be found three entries opposite the name of Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d Bidar (or sometimes in the text Bidar). One of the entries against Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d, that for page 158, year 1088 H., is really in the text \"Zafarabad Bidar,\" and I have little doubt that the other ten entries also refer to the same place, Bidar. According to Thornton's Gazetteer (Ed., 1862), p. 78, Bidar was once an important place. It is in Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d territory, 75 miles north-west of the city of Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d. The names of Bidar and Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d are also found coupled on p. 34 of James Fraser's \"History of N\u00e1dir Shah\" (London 1742).\n\nOn p. xxxi of the Introduction to Mr. S. Lane-Poole's \"Catalogue of Indian Coins in the British Museum,\" vol. 3, (a reprint of which has been published by A. Constable and Co., and from this I quote) I find that Mr. Poole without any hesitation places Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d in the province of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. He does not give his reasons, and although my opinion may possibly be held of little value against that of such an authority, I think he must be wrong. It is quite true that there is a Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d in the North-West Provinces; it lies 6 miles south-east of Jaunpur town. It was the name of a Mahal (or parganah) in Sirk\u00e1r Jaunpur of \u0160\u00fabah Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d (see Jarrett's translation of Vol. II of the 'A\u00edn-i-Akbar\u00ed, pp. 89 and 164). As Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d Bidar was not conquered by the Mughals till 1653, it naturally is not named in the 'A\u00edn, a work compiled about 1590. Is it probable that a mint would be established at\nZafarabad in Sirk\u00e1r Jaunpur, an obscure provincial town, quite close to three other mint towns, Jaunpur, Banaras, Allahabad? On the other hand, Zafarabad Bidar was the chief town of a recently conquered province, and, as Thornton says, the former \"capital of a principality and 'the residence of kings.'\" What would be more likely than that Alamgir should issue coins from such a place as one of the usual marks of conquest?\n\nOn p. liv Mr. Poole states that Akbarnagar is a name given to R\u00e1jmahal by Jah\u00e1ngir. Blochmann (\"Ain, Vol. I, p. 340), apparently quoting the Akbarn\u00e1mah, says that R\u00e1jah M\u00e1n Singh Kachhw\u00e1ha built Akbarnagar at R\u00e1jmahal in the 40th year of Akbar.\n\nI have only glanced through Mr. Poole's book, but I have noticed one or two slips or oversights.\n\nP. xxxvii. As the site of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h's battle against N\u00e1dir Sh\u00e1h he has Karn\u00f3l for Karn\u00e1l.\n\nP. xxxviii. A\u1e25mad Sh\u00e1h, son of Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, did not occupy the throne for fourteen but for six years. Mr. Poole's other dates show this, Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h's death being rightly given in April 1748, and 'Alamgir II's accession in June 1754 being also correctly stated.\n\nSame page. Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h is said to have died of grief. Did he not rather die of apoplexy or paralysis? See Elliott \"Historians,\" vol. viii, p. 111.\n\nP. xxxix. In a passage from Mr. H. G. Keene's \"Sketch of the History of Hindustan,\" Mr. Poole interpolates, after the name of Safdar Jang, the words [son of the Niz\u00e1m]. If by Niz\u00e1m he means Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk A\u1e63af J\u00e1h, it is quite erroneous to say that Safdar Jang (a Persian and a Shia') was his son.\n\nSame page. Gh\u00e1z\u00edudd\u00edn, that is Gh\u00e1z\u00edudd\u00edn Kh\u00e1n (III) 'Im\u00e1d-ul-mulk, grandson of Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk, is called the \"nephew of Safdar Jang.\" This again is a mistake.\n\nP. xxxvii. Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk A\u1e63af J\u00e1h is said to have been over 100 years of age when he died. There is some authority for this assertion, but I fancy it is founded on popular error. Beale (Oriental Biographical Dictionary, p. 212) gives him 104 lunar years, but a very competent authority, the Ma'asir-ul-Umr\u00e1 (printed text III, 838), says he was born in 1082 H. This gives him 79 years at his death in 1161 H. Another very good authority, a contemporary, Mirza Mu\u1e25ammad, in his T\u00e1rikh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi, makes Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk's age 77 years and a fraction. A modern work, published at Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d, the T\u00e1rikh-i-Khurshed J\u00e1h gives the year of his birth as 1082 H. as in the Ma'asir-ul-Umr\u00e1.\n\nThe T\u00e1rikh-i-Mu\u1e25ammadi states that Fir\u00faz Jang (Niz\u00e1m-ul-mulk's father) was 62 years of age at his death in 1122 H. Therefore he was\nborn about 1060 H. Reckoning Niz\u00e1m-ul-malk\u2019s birth from that year (1060), he would have been 101 at his death in 1161 H.

Reminiscences of Sea-voyage in ancient Bengali Literature.\u2014By Pandit Harapras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri.\n\nI have received five Bengali poems, two in manuscript and three in print, which contain description of sea-voyages. These poems were written between the years 1495 and 1595. The oldest of them, that by Biprad\u00e1s Pippal\u00e1\u00ed, of whom we heard something at the last meeting, gives the following description of a sea-voyage made by Ch\u00e1nd, the princely merchant of Champ\u00e1inagar. After storing his vessels with fresh water from the Badarik\u00e1 Kunda near S\u00e9gar Island, the merchant proceeded to Sankar M\u00e1dhab. Here is an exact translation of what followed:\n\n\u201cHe worshipped Sankar M\u00e1dhab with devotion, performed the Sr\u00e1dh ceremony, peculiar to holy places and offered Tarpana to the manes. In the vicinity of that place the fleet entered the confluence, where the king with great pleasure performed the ceremonies peculiar to holy places. The Madhukar, that is the chief vessel of the fleet, entered the sea, and they began to row day and night, all the 8 prahars or 24 hours. [There are two lines here which are unintelligible]. The king passed\nby the country of the kir\u00e1tas who ate living human beings. He passed the cities inhabited by people with faces like those of horses, and by people with faces like those of elephants. From these places he passed into the country inhabited by men with only one leg. He was disgusted with their manners, so contrary to those of his own country-men, and left the country as soon as possible. Then the fleet entered H\u00e1diadaha where no land could be perceived, the wide expanse of water surrounding the fleet on all sides. The gulf of leeches, the gulf of serpents, the gulf of cowries, and the gulf of conches, he passed merrily. He captured many cowrie and conch shells in the course of his voyage. He passed the gulf sacred to the goddess of serpents, as well as the gulf of Lions, and entered the Peerless city, his destination.\"\n\nThere is much that is fabulous in this, but in later works, the fabulous element appears in greater abundance.

It is called\nB\u00e1is Kabir Manasa Mangal, that is a poem in honor of the goddess of\nserpents, compiled from the works of 22 poets. It appears that all\nthese 22 had each a complete work in honor of Manasa, and a clever com-\npiler has put in the best things from the work of every one of these into\nhis collection. Two of these complete works are known to me; one is\nPadma Pur\u00e1n by N\u00e1r\u00e1yan Kavi, and the other by Dvija Bansid\u00e1s, who\nis the author of the worm-eaten manuscript just noticed. Some of the\nfacts in connection with the Sea-voyage in B\u00e1is Kabir Manasa Mangal\ncomes from Dvija Bansid\u00e1s; but the version of the manuscript and the\nversion of the printed work do not agree. The version of the manus-\ncript has been already given. In the printed work the merchant on\nentering the sea had to encounter obstacles thrown in his way by the\ngoddess of serpents whom he hated. The sea was covered with crabs, some of which were as big as mountains. They completely blocked the way of the fleet, Ch\u00e1nd held a council of the voyagers, and it was determined that as crabs were very much afraid of the barking of the jackals the whole crew should howl like them. The experiment proved successful, and the crab-difficulty was got over. Then came the leeches, of huge dimensions, and the fleet could not pass through them. Ch\u00e1nd was advised to throw lime on them, and they disappeared. Then came the crocodiles who fled away when Ch\u00e1nd began to fire his cannons. The fleet passed R\u00e1meswar and anchored off the island of Lank\u00e1 ruled by Bibhishan, the brother of the ten-headed monster R\u00e1vana killed by R\u00e1m. The merchant lulled the suspicion of Bibhishan by telling him that he came from Ajodhy\u00e1, and got rich presents from him.\n\nThe voyage from Ceylon to the Southern City is exceedingly interesting. Leaving Ceylon to the right, and the Malaya Hills, the Western Ghats (Sahyagiri) (here wrongly spelt as Satyagiri) with the land of Parasur\u00e1ma to the left, the fleet proceeded in a southerly direction. This is, by the bye, a geographical impossibility. Because if the fleet passed through the Pox\u2019s Channel, Ceylon would be on the left and India on the right. But the topographical idea of these poets was awfully confused. After a long voyage they arrive, at the Bay of Nilaksha, where nothing but water can be seen. The poet here gives the following description of the sea:\n\n\u201cIn a short time the fleet rowed to the Bay of Nilaksha. Fear took possession of the merchant\u2019s mind at the sight of this terrible bay. They could not distinguish to which quarter they were steering. It was all a wide expanse of water. They knew neither the east, nor the west, nor the north, nor the south. There was no distinction of day and night. People knew each other by the voice only. The terrible roaring of the water was heard on all sides. The peaks of submarine mountains were seen every now and then: and big marine animals such as the whales, the crocodiles, and the sharks roamed over the water in all their pride. Each wave of the sea gave a push to the vessel and it tossed to and fro as a lump of cotton in high wind. People despaired of their lives, and at this juncture Ch\u00e1nd was beside himself with fear. He sent for the Pandit and asked him to read the Chand\u00ed as quickly as possible. He entreated Captain Dulai, the commander of the fleet, to be careful, and to watch the direction of the Southern City. Dulai replied that he remembered on a previous occasion to have steered 13 vessels belonging to Ch\u00e1nd\u2019s father \u201cKot\u00ed\u015bvara,\u201d that is, the Millionaire, to the southern city. Keeping the points at which the sun rises and at which he sets at equal distance in the right and in the left, the vessel is to go direct to the\nsouth with the speed of a shooting star. So saying he ordered his rowers to do their best, and within a short time reached the Southern City.\"\n\nDulai's idea of navigation appears to be a very simple and primitive one. He considers the earth to be flat and fixed. The points in the horizon at which the sun rises and at which it sets are to him fixed forever, and so he calculates the point bisecting the line joining these two points, and gives direction to his rowers.\n\nThe writers had no idea of the sea, they were acquainted of course with river-navigation, and so were very fond of using the words Daha and B\u00e1nk. Daha is a small deep water in a shallow river; and the B\u00e1nk is the place where a river takes a turn. The sea is regarded by the authors, as a broad river, only much broader than the Padm\u00e1.\n\nThe king of the southern city got immensely frightened at the sight of so large a fleet, and considered it to belong to a foreign enemy. Without waiting to hold a council, he sought safety in flight, and hid himself in the women's apartments, where he considered himself safe, dressed in female attire. Ch\u00e1nd, of course, showed no disposition to fight. He gradually ingratiated himself in the favour of the king and succeeded in driving a very advantageous bargain. He gave the king cocoanut, bh\u00e1ng, plantains, and got in return plenty of valuables in gold, silver, jewellery, &c.\n\nThe second printed work also comes from Chittagong. It was written in the year 1579 at Saptagr\u00e1m, the great emporium of trade in Bengal at that time. The copy from which the book has been printed, seems to have been very defective. Leaving Hadiadaha, the fleet arrived at a B\u00e1nk named after that place. It was a wonderful place. There was pure water below, and the head of sand above. B\u00faran, the commander of the fleet, was very intelligent. He fixed swords in front of the boat, and thereby cut the head of the sand and made a passage for the vessels. Then the fleet came to where the river breaks into a hundred streams, and a little beyond that is Magr\u00e1. At Magr\u00e1 the fleet is overtaken by a severe storm, because the navigator had previously incurred the displeasure of the Goddess Chand\u00ed, six of his vessels were drowned; with one vessel, the Madhukar, he steers for Sinhal. After Magr\u00e1, is mentioned Gang\u00e1s\u00e1g\u00e1r, and then the broad sea. The merchant passed Setubandha R\u00e1me\u015bvar, the vessel being steered only by its oars; no sail is mentioned in any one of these books. The shell-fish, cowrie, as soon as they smelt the vessel, began to float on the surface of the sea. The merchant captured a large quantity of them, because cowrie was then a medium of exchange. As soon as he proceeded a little, he found conches floating on the sea. He captured some of them. Then came the leeches, as big as palm trees. They are made to go away by throw-\ning a quantity of lime on them. Then came big crabs which were propitiated with a sacrifice of goats to them. Then came the mosquitoes, as big as pigeons. The merchant threw arrows on them, which produced a large quantity of smoke and thus got rid of the mosquitoes. He then went to K\u00e1lidaha, and found there a beautiful girl, coming out of a lotus, and holding an elephant in her hand. She was swallowing the elephant and throwing it out again. In a short time she disappeared, and the vessel reached Ratnam\u00e1l\u00e1 Gh\u00e1t in Sinhal, whence the merchant Dhanapati proceeded to pay his respects to the king of the island.\n\nThe third printed work is Kavi kankan Chandi, written about the year 1595. In this work the sea-voyage of Dhanapati Sad\u00e1g\u00e1r commences at Magr\u00e1 as in the previous work. He is overtaken there by a storm, the consequence of the wrath of the Goddess Chandi, whom he hated. Six of his vessels are drowned, with one vessel he proceeds to the sea. He passes by Sanketa M\u00e1dhab, with its gold image of Mahesha. On his right he leaves M\u00e9dini malla, on his left B\u00edrkh\u00e1n\u00e1, covered with foam. He passes by K\u00e1nh\u00e1t\u00e1 and Dhuligr\u00e1m and Angarpur. Then came the country of the Firingis, the Portuguese pirates. They rowed day and night for fear of these non-believers. After a voyage of twenty days they reached Dr\u00e1vida where there was a temple with a disc of gold and a spire of silver. The merchant halted there in order to acquire the merit of eating the dainties offered to the deity, and to pay his respects to the king of the place. From Dr\u00e1vida he successively passes the fabulous gulfs of the shrimps, of the serpents, of crabs, of cowries (which he captured, and buried on the sea shore with a view to take them away on his return voyage) of conches, and of crocodiles. Then he comes to a place called Hadiadaha\u2014from Hrad, a lake. This is a lake completely covered over with weeds on which men and cattle can pass. The captain fastened axes and knives in front of the vessel and cut his way through the weeds. At the end of this region, is Buhit\u00e1la (\u092c\u0941\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0932\u093e) with Shetubandha on the left. Passing Shetubandha, the vessel reached Markut Chitrak\u00fat\u00e1, inhabited by Yakshas. The merchant halted at a gh\u00e1t belonging to the yakshas, and then entered the straits of Ceylon. It is called the Ananga S\u00e1g\u00e1r. After rowing day and night for sometime the merchant reached K\u00e1lidaha where he saw the same girl on the lotus as described above, and reached thence to Ratnam\u00e1l\u00e1 gh\u00e1t of the capital of Ceylon.\n\n5. Note on an inscribed gun in the armoury of the Nawab of Murshidabad,\u2014By Pandit Harapras\u00e1d S\u00e1stri. Communicated by H. Beveridge, Esq., C. S.\n\nMr. Beveridge found in the armoury of the Nawab of Murshidabad a brass gun of native manufacture. It is mounted on a carriage, and\nstands in the armoury on the ground floor of the palace. It is some three feet in length and is of small bore, 4 or 6 pounds. It has floral decorations. The head and the mouth are in the shape of a demon, or of a monster's head with long pointed ears, a human face and a crocodile's jaws. There is an inscription on it in raised Bengali letters in a shield on the upper part of the gun and about the middle. The inscription, as read on the gun by Babu Sasibhushan Datta, Deputy Magistrate, Berhampur, runs as follows:\n\n\u091c\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e \u092f\u0902 \u0924\u0924\u094d \u0938\u0924\u094d\u0964\n\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c\n\u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092f \u091a\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094d\u0930 \u0930\u093e\u092f\n\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\u093e\n\u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0930\u093e\u091c\n\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c\n\u0938\u0941\u092d\u093e\u0937\u093f\u0924\u0964\n\n\u0915\u093f\u0938\u094b\u0926 \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e\u0964\n\nFrom the rubbings that were sent to me, the reading appears to be tolerably correct, except in the third line. \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c was rarely used as a formula during the last century. \u091c\u092f \u0915\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0924\u093f\u0915\u093e is the formula used by Krishna Chandra in his prayers and invocations. What Babu Sasibhushan reads as \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c may be \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c because that is the corrupt form in which the word \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0940\u0930\u093e\u091c is sometimes spelt. It appears that the gun was cast by one Kisordas Karmakar, a blacksmith, and the inscription was put upon it by Rupram Chatterji. The gun belonged to Maharaja Krishna Chandra Ray of Nadia, who played an important part in the revolution which ended in the battle of Plassey. Mr. Beveridge thinks that the gun may have been presented to the Mahar\u00e1j\u00e1 by one of the Governors of Calcutta, who always held friendly relations with the Nadia family in whose extensive zamindaries Calcutta was situated. In the chronicles of the family of Raja Krishna Chandra Ray, translated by Dr. Putsch, Berlin, 1852, we read at page 39 that Ram Krishna, grandfather of Krishna Chandra, lived in friendship with the \"Baras\u00e1hib,\" i.e., the Governor of Calcutta, and that the latter showed continual friendship\ntowards him, and placed a garrison of 500 so-called soldiers who were skilled in the use of all kinds of missiles and weapons at Krishnaghar, to execute the plans of R\u00e2m Krishna. Perhaps the gun was sent to his successor Krishna Chandra on a similar occasion at a subsequent time. It is also a well-known fact that Lord Clive presented the Maharaja with five of the guns captured at Plassey. These are still to be found at Krishnaghar, and are exempted from the operation of the Arms Act.\n\nAs I am on the subject of inscribed guns, I should take this opportunity of informing the Society of the new light which has been thrown on the history of the gun which is lying in their compound by recent Assamese publications. Svargadev Jayadhvaaja Sinha mentioned in the inscription on the gun, was the reigning Ahom prince of Assam, when Mir Jumla, the Commander-in-chief of Aurangzebe's forces invaded that country. The result of that disastrous expedition is well known. Floods and epidemics compelled Mir Jumla to beat a hasty retreat, leaving everything behind; the king harassing him at every step. The gun was captured at that time; so says the inscription on it. It was perhaps plundered by the Burmese who took possession of Assam during the early years of this century, and the English got it from the Burmese during the first Burmese war. In the year 1838 it was brought to False Point where it was used to hold a flagstaff till it was brought by the Port Officer to Calcutta. I examined the inscription at Capt. Petley's compound whence it has since been transferred to the Society's premises.\n\n---\n\nLibrary.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in December last.\n\nTransactions, Proceedings and Journals,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBaltimore.

King, B.A., in the chair.\n\nThe following members were present:\u2014\nH. K. W. Arnold, Esq., B\u00e1bu Sarat Chandra Chatterjee, B\u00e1bu Sarat Chandra D\u00e1s, B\u00e1bu Bhupendra Sri Ghosha, Moulvie Golam Sarwar, B\u00e1bu Rajanik\u00e1nta Gupta, A. Hogg, Esq., T. H. Holland, Esq., W. A. Lee, Esq., C. Little, Esq., Kum\u00e1r Rameswar Mali\u00e1b, J. Mann, Esq., B\u00e1bu Panchanan Mukharji, L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., R. D. Oldham, Esq., The Hon. Dr. Mahendralal Sarkar, Pandit Hara Pras\u00e1d Sh\u00e1stri, C. R. Wilson, Esq.\n\nVisitor:\u2014Vety.-Capt. W. D. Gunn.\n\nAccording to the Bye-Laws of the Society, the President ordered the Voting papers to be distributed for the election of Office-Bearers and Members of Council for 1893, and appointed the Hon. Dr. Mahendralal Sarkar and L. de Nic\u00e9ville, Esq., to be Scrutineers.\n\nThe Chairman then called upon the Secretary to read the Annual Report.\n\nANNUAL REPORT FOR 1892.\n\nThe Council of the Asiatic Society have the honor to submit the following report on the state and progress of the Society's affairs during the past year.\nMember List.\n\nDuring the year under review 30 Ordinary Members were elected, 10 withdrew, 3 died, and two were removed from the list under Rule 40, being more than 3 years absent from India; of the Members elected, 1 was an old member who rejoined. The total number of Members at the close of 1892 was thus 310 against 295 at the end of the preceding year; of these, 115 were Resident, 127 Non-Resident, 11 Foreign, 22 Life, 33 absent from India, and 2 special non-subscribing Members, as will be seen from the following table which also shows the fluctuations in the number of Ordinary Members during the past six years:\n\n| Year | Paying | Non-Paying | Grand Total |\n|------|--------|------------|-------------|\n|      | Resident | Non-Resident | Foreign | Total | Life | Absent | Special Non-Subscribing | Total |             |\n| 1887 | ... 98 | 137 | 15 | 250 | 17 | 44 | 2 | 63 | 313 |\n| 1888 | ... 98 | 136 | 15 | 249 | 20 | 34 | 2 | 56 | 305 |\n| 1889 | ... 108 | 135 | 13 | 256 | 22 | 27 | 2 | 51 | 307 |\n| 1890 | ... 105 | 140 | 10 | 255 | 21 | 25 | 2 | 48 | 308 |\n| 1891 | ... 101 | 134 | 10 | 245 | 21 | 27 | 2 | 50 | 295 |\n| 1892 | ... 115 | 127 | 11 | 253 | 22 | 33 | 2 | 57 | 310 |\n\nThe three Ordinary Members, the loss of whom by death during the year we have to regret, were, Mr. Ashutosh Gupta, Mr. A. V. Nursing Rao, and Pandit Prannath Sarasvati.\n\nIntimation of one death amongst the Honorary Members was received, viz., Sir G. B. Airy. The number now stands at 23.\n\nTwo Associate Members were elected during the year. Pandit Satyavrata Samasrami, Calcutta, on account of his being a distinguished Vedic Scholar; and Mr. P. J. Br\u00fchl, Howrah, in recognition of his attainments in Physics and Botany. The number now stands at 10, there having been no casualties.\n\nThe lists of Special Honorary Centenary Members, and Corresponding Members continue unaltered from last year, their numbers standing at 5 and 6 respectively.\n\nDuring the year, one member, the Hon'ble Raja Ooday Pratab Singh, Raja of Bhinga, compounded for his future subscriptions.\n\nIndian Museum.\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Act XXII of 1876, a copper vessel sent by the Officiating Collector of Monghyr was presented to the Indian Museum.\nThere was only one change among the Trustees, caused by the resignation of the Hon'ble Sir A. W. Croft, in consequence of his leaving India on furlough, and the Hon'ble Dr. Mahendralal Sircar was appointed to fill the vacant place.\n\nThe other Trustees on behalf of the Society were:\u2014\n\nDr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nA. Pedler, Esq.\nDr. D. D. Cunningham.\nC. Little Esq.\n\nFinance.\n\nThe accounts of the Society are shown in Statement No. 1 in the Appendix under the usual heads.\n\nStatement No. 8 contains the Balance Sheet of the Society, and of the different funds administered through it.\n\nThe Budget Estimate for 1892 was taken at the following figures:\u2014\nReceipts Rs. 14,988. Expenditure Rs. 13,378.\n\nThe actual results were found to be:\u2014Receipts Rs. 15,599-6-9. Expenditure Rs. 13,670-11-9.\n\nThe Receipts thus show an increase of Rs. 611-6-9, and the expenditure an increase of Rs. 292-11-9 on the Budget Estimate, leaving a balance in favor of the Society of Rs. 1,928-11-0.\n\nThe increase in Receipts is under the head of \"Sales of Publications\" which were estimated at Rs. 400, whilst the actual receipts were Rs 1,698-12-0. This large increase is due to the adjustment of Messrs. Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner's account for two years and three months.\n\nThe number of absent or non-paying Members during the past year was somewhat larger than usual, consequently the receipts from subscriptions are below the estimated amount by Rs. 155-0-0.\n\nThe difference between the estimated and actual miscellaneous receipts is due to the refund of income tax not having been granted.\n\nOn the expenditure side, the items of \"Repairs,\" \"Books,\" \"Binding,\" \"Proceedings\" and \"Printing Circulars,\" &c., show an increase. No repairs were contemplated during the year and Rs. 25 was set aside for such petty repairs, as might prove necessary. During the rains, the roof was found defective in certain places, and Rs. 40-8-0 was spent in the stoppage of leaks. \"Books\" show an increase of Rs. 1,003-15-3. This also is due to the adjustment of Messrs Kegan Paul, Trench, Tr\u00fcbner's account for two years and three months for supplying new books to the Society during the period. \"Binding\" was estimated at Rs. 500, whilst the actual expenditure was Rs. 826-10-9. In September, the Council sanctioned a grant of Rs. 1,000 for four book cases for the\nLibrary. After re-arranging some old books according to sizes, only one new book case was found necessary, the cost of it being Rs. 250. The balance of Rs. 750 remains unexpended; but in carrying out the examination of the Library which has been in progress during the greater part of the past year, it was found that in numerous cases periodicals were still unbound, and that many old books required rebinding. The above balance has been freely drawn on for this purpose, and now about Rs. 400 remains. The binding is not yet completed, and on this account it is thought advisable to increase the usual allowance by what remains unspent from the special grant for the library, so that the sum set apart for the coming year is Rs. 900 instead of Rs. 500 the usual amount.\n\n\"Proceedings\" show an increase of Rs. 134-3-0, this is due to the payment of printing charges for twelve numbers of the Proceedings, instead of ten as usual, during the year. Owing to the proposed Investment of the Society's Permanent Reserve Fund, a larger number of circulars than usual, were required, and thus there is a slight increase of Rs. 25-15-0 under the head of \"Printing Circulars.\"\n\nThe actual expenditure on the \"Journal\" and \"Proceedings\" was as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Journal} & \\quad \\{ \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{Part I\u2014Rs. 1,631 2 0} \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{Part II\u2014,, 1,520 4 0} \\\\\n\\text{Proceedings} & \\quad ,, 1,194 3 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nmaking a total of Rs. 4,345 9 0\n\nwhich is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 854-7-0.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of Ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1893 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 16,236; Expenditure Rs. 15,698.\n\nOn the receipts side, the estimate for Interest on Investments has been slightly increased owing to purchase of Government Securities.\n\nThere is a new item of Rs. 2,000 in the receipts under the head of \"Government Allowances.\" This amount has been granted by the Government of Bengal for a third section of the Society's Journal dealing with Anthropology, Ethnography and Folklore.\n\nOn the expenditure side the items \"Stationery\" and \"Printing Circulars,\" &c., have been slightly increased.\n\nPostage has been reduced by Rs. 100. There will be a considerable reduction under this head as the postage on Foreign covers, book-packets, &c., has been greatly reduced. Rs. 600 has been fixed, as the amount is intended to cover postage for the third part of the Journal.\n\nThere will, however, be two extraordinary items of expenditure to be dealt with during the year 1893. Extensive repairs to the Society's building had to be undertaken at the end of last year.\nThe gas fittings in the Society's rooms are not very satisfactory, and it is intended to complete the necessary gas fittings at a total cost of Rs. 426-6-0.\n\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n### RECEIPTS\n\n| Description          | Amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions        | Rs. 7,400 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments | Rs. 5,456 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms        | Rs. 720 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances | Rs. 2,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous        | Rs. 350 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 16,326 0 0\n\n### EXPENDITURE\n\n| Description          | Amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| Salaries             | Rs. 3,400 0 0 |\n| Commission           | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Stationery           | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Lighting             | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes      | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage              | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight              | Rs. 10 0 0 |\n| Meeting              | Rs. 83 0 0 |\n| Contingencies        | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Books                | Rs. 1,800 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals    | Rs. 31 0 0 |\n| Binding              | Rs. 900 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I      | Rs. 4,200 0 0 |\n| \" Part II            | Rs. 2,000 0 0 |\n| \" Part III           | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings          | Rs. 125 0 0 |\n| Printing Circulars, &c. | Rs. 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 15,698 0 0\n\n### EXTRAORDINARY EXPENDITURE\n\n| Description          | Amount |\n|----------------------|--------|\n| For repairs to House | Rs. 9,480 6 6 |\n| Gas fittings         | Rs. 426 6 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 9,906 12 6\nLibrary.

Owing to the proposed Investment of the Society's Permanent Reserve Fund, a larger number of circulars than usual, were required, and thus there is a slight increase of Rs. 25-15-0 under the head of \"Printing Circulars.\"\n\nThe actual expenditure on the \"Journal\" and \"Proceedings\" was as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Journal} & \\quad \\{ \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{Part I\u2014Rs. 1,631 2 0} \\\\\n& \\quad \\text{Part II\u2014,, 1,520 4 0} \\\\\n\\text{Proceedings} & \\quad ,, 1,194 3 0 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nmaking a total of Rs. 4,345 9 0\n\nwhich is less than the Budget Estimate by Rs. 854-7-0.\n\nThe Budget Estimate of Ordinary Receipts and Expenditure for 1893 has been fixed as follows:\u2014Receipts Rs. 16,236; Expenditure Rs. 15,698.\n\nOn the receipts side, the estimate for Interest on Investments has been slightly increased owing to purchase of Government Securities.\n\nThere is a new item of Rs. 2,000 in the receipts under the head of \"Government Allowances.\" This amount has been granted by the Government of Bengal for a third section of the Society's Journal dealing with Anthropology, Ethnography and Folklore.\n\nOn the expenditure side the items \"Stationery\" and \"Printing Circulars,\" &c., have been slightly increased.\n\nPostage has been reduced by Rs. 100. There will be a considerable reduction under this head as the postage on Foreign covers, book-packets, &c., has been greatly reduced. Rs. 600 has been fixed, as the amount is intended to cover postage for the third part of the Journal.\n\nThere will, however, be two extraordinary items of expenditure to be dealt with during the year 1893. Extensive repairs to the Society's building had to be undertaken at the end of last year.\nThe gas fittings in the Society's rooms are not very satisfactory, and it is intended to complete the necessary gas fittings at a total cost of Rs. 426-6-0.\n\nThe details of the Budget Estimate are as follows:\n\n**Receipts**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Subscriptions          | Rs. 7,400 0 0 |\n| Sale of Publications   | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Interest on Investments| Rs. 5,456 0 0 |\n| Rent of Rooms          | Rs. 720 0 0 |\n| Government Allowances  | Rs. 2,000 0 0 |\n| Miscellaneous          | Rs. 350 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 16,326 0 0\n\n**Expenditure**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| Salaries               | Rs. 3,400 0 0 |\n| Commission             | Rs. 400 0 0 |\n| Stationery             | Rs. 100 0 0 |\n| Lighting               | Rs. 80 0 0 |\n| Municipal Taxes        | Rs. 819 0 0 |\n| Postage                | Rs. 600 0 0 |\n| Freight                | Rs. 10 0 0 |\n| Meeting                | Rs. 83 0 0 |\n| Contingencies          | Rs. 150 0 0 |\n| Books                  | Rs. 1,800 0 0 |\n| Local Periodicals      | Rs. 31 0 0 |\n| Binding                | Rs. 900 0 0 |\n| Journal, Part I        | Rs. 4,200 0 0 |\n| \" Part II              | Rs. 2,000 0 0 |\n| \" Part III             | Rs. 1,000 0 0 |\n| Proceedings            | Rs. 125 0 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 15,698 0 0\n\n**Extraordinary Expenditure**\n\n| Description            | Amount |\n|------------------------|--------|\n| For repairs to House   | Rs. 9,480 6 6 |\n| Gas fittings           | Rs. 426 6 0 |\n\nTotal Rs. 9,906 12 6\nLondon Agency.\n\nMessrs.

Mr. Crooke refers to them as flint, but they are, more properly speaking, chert or silicified argillaceous rock.\n\nThese scraps or fragments of stone have, at first sight, the appearance of being a collection of very ordinary bits of chert, such as may be picked up in any field where the rock of the country is of this kind; but a few of them show undoubted evidence of having been chipped by human hands with an intent to produce something in the shape of an implement for cutting or scraping purposes, while most of them show, at least, indications of having had portions or flakes knocked off them by other forces than any we know of in the domain of natural wear and tear; in other words, they show that man must have been tapping or pressing off flakes or longish chips of convenient form for implements, such as arrow heads, small knives, or scrapers, which he appears to have used in an early period of his history.\n\nThe essential feature about the kind of stone of which these fragments consist, and indeed of nearly all the stone which early men\nelected for this object, is the property of breaking with what is called a conchoidal fracture, which they, however, learned to adapt to their own ends: and it is in the resultant facets produced by their manipulation that we recognize a remarkable variation from the chips and flaked surfaces produced by natural blows or splittings-off by water or weather. Under the latter conditions the conchoidal surfaces are generally more roundly ovoid, and more regular in shape, while they have more of a family likeness on each fragment of stone: and that peculiar bulbous protuberance, continued sometimes into a re-entrant concave hollow which has been found to characterize surfaces produced by artificial fracture, is scarcely ever seen with any distinctness in natural stones. On the other hand, artificial flaking is productive of long or short chips, as convenience or the quality of the stone permits; and a bulb of percussion is very often present on the flake, or its complement, and well marked.\n\nSome of these specimens show this bulb of percussion very clearly, and the complements of the flakes, which have evidently been knocked off some of the larger fragments, have their axes in different and sometimes opposite directions.\n\nA further feature in some of these flakes, is a sort of supplementary smaller chipping along some of the edges of the larger flaked surfaces, giving a kind of saw-like edge, which is a common feature in some manifest arrow heads and other prehistoric weapons. It is notable that in these specimens the secondary small chipping is as old as the larger flaking, whereas, such newer fracturing as there is, is quite clearly new and unweathered; while this is, as it were, aimless in its regularity.\n\nI am unfortunately unable to specify any particular fragment in the lot as being certainly an implement, though there are one or two which might be considered very rude attempts at small hatchets or scrapers; so that the lot is not of value except as indicative of human manufacture, which perhaps hardly requires further corroboration, since better samples of such manufacture have already been found in the same neighbourhood. At best, we can only say from these specimens, that they are in part probably the refuse of pal\u00e6olithic implement manufacture which seems to have been an industry, however small and scattered, in a district where the raw product occurs in tolerable abundance.\n\nAt the same time I have thought that the receipt of them, afforded an opportunity for illustrating a few of the peculiarities which are considered as characteristic of stones bearing traces of human handiwork; and that such illustration will help to keep up the spirit of enquiry after the traces of early man in India.\nAn inscription in the Tughr\u00e1 character.\u2014Communicated by Henry Beveridge, Esq., I. C. S.:\n\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a rubbing of an inscription in the Tughr\u00e1 character received from Mr. H. Beveridge, I. C. S. It was found in the Masnad-i-auliya or shrine of the Apostles of Isl\u00e1m at Ch\u00fa\u00e1kh\u00e1l\u00ed, in the district of Murshid\u00e1b\u00e1d. It is of value, as it seems to be the only evidence we have to prove that the reign of Saifu\u2019d-d\u00edn Abu\u2019l-mu\u1e93affar Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h (II) extended into 896 A. H.

Study of Sanskrit in Ceylon.\u2014By Pandit Harimohan Vidy\u00e1-bh\u00fasan. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. A 16th Century Account of Indian Buddhist shrines by an Indian Buddhist Yogi, translated from the Tibetan.\u2014By L. A. Waddell, M.B., M.R.A.S.\n\nIt is now becoming more clearly evident that although Buddhism was forcibly expelled from its primitive home in the Gangetic Valley by the wholesale massacre of its monks, and the destruction of its monasteries by the Muhammedan invaders at the end of the twelfth century of the Christian era, it still continued to linger for several centuries longer in the more remote parts of India\u2014in the Dakhan, Central India, the Sub-Himalayan highlands, and in the more secluded parts of the Peninsula generally. In Orissa, it is specially stated by the great historian Lama T\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1tha,\u00b9 to have existed up till the middle of the fifteenth century A.D., and T\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1tha\u2019s information in regard to the later history of Indian Buddhism was largely derived from the lips of the Indian Yogi Buddhagupta N\u00e1tha, a disciple of Tirthi N\u00e1tha who visited Tibet at the end of the 16th century.\n\nThe account of the Indian wanderings of Buddhagupta Natha is a well-known though rare book in Tibet, and its publication is usually attributed to T\u00e1r\u00e1n\u00e1tha. As it indicates a survival of some living ves-\n\n\u00b9 Vassilief\u2019s Le Buddhisme: La Coinne\u2019s transl. p.\ntiges of Buddhism in India so late as the 16th century, and gives some descriptions of little known places, such as Uday\u0101na, the Indian Pot\u0101la, &c., and suggestive groupings of names of places, contemporary kings and Yogis, and also some notes on the School of Gorakhnath, which are of interest, I here present an abstract of its contents.\n\nFrom this it will be seen that while Tirthi N\u0101tha and Buddhagupta N\u0101tha are held by the Lamas to have been truly Indian Buddhists\u2014and they certainly were born in India, and made their pilgrimages chiefly to Buddhist shrines\u2014their form of religion was of the most highly Tantrik and Saiva type and scarcely recognizable as Buddhism, although it is practically, if not wholly, identical with the Buddhist Yoga in its latest development amongst the Northern Buddhists of Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet. These two Yogis indeed seem to belong to the same school as Gorakhnath or Gorakshanatha, noted leader of the K\u0101mp\u016bta or ear-slit Yogis, who is placed about the fourteenth or fifteenth century A.D., and usually considered a Buddhist Yogi. Like him these two Yogis possess the title N\u0101tha, or leader, a special title of Yoga teachers and Saivic leaders. And T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha's own religious name seems founded on the same model, and indicating his personal tendencies in the same direction. The date of the composition of this account is placed before the composition of T\u0101r\u0101n\u0101tha's History of Indian Buddhism, i.e., some years anterior to 1608 A.D.\n\nThe reverend Buddhagupta N\u0101tha, the pupil of the reverend Tirthin\u0101tha, was born in the city of Indralinga near Rasmi\u015bvara on the seacoast of the Dakhan, the youngest of eight sons of a merchant named Krishna. While a lad, he became a follower of Tirthin\u0101tha on the latter's visit to his native town, and he was then given the religious name of Buddh\u0101n\u0101tha. He accompanied Tirthin\u0101tha during several years in the countries of Kachali, Kongkum, and Tvasur\u0101ti, during which time he was instructed by Tirthin\u0101tha in the principles of yoga philosophy. He was also taught by Dipan\u0101tha, a Brahman yogi, the following books, viz. sGra-mdo-tsan-tra-pa, sDeb-sbyor-gyi-bstan bchos known as dmar-ser-snyan-snagags, Alan-kara, Amarakekha, &c.\n\nThe superior Tirthin\u0101tha ate nutritious food and had remarkably long hair and a beard. He went with his retinue to the Middle Country and stayed for a time at B\u0101nara\u015bi. From thence he went to Bikrama, the forest of wealth, near Dili, where he began to obtain behin-len upon which his hairs fell off.\n\nThe reverend master (Buddhagupta N\u0101tha) was empowered by the\n\n---\n\n2 H.H. Wilson, Asiatic Researches, xvii, p. 190. 5 Indian Antiquary, vii, p. 299.\n4 rje-btsm. 6 Skt. 7 Skt. 8 Blu-ma.\nSuperior (Tirthin\u0101tha) in Sanghyantaparama after the customs of Gorakhnath Sohoo obtaining 'those gods who have passed from this world.' He stayed for nine years, in Dili, Gorakhatari, and Haridvara meditating on the rlung-kyi-rnal-hbyor, and receiving advice from two yogis named Guru prahman\u0101tha and Kridhnan\u0101tha, (from whom he learned that) Goraksha had said that Mah\u0101bada and Svasi-bada are two theoretical treatises which show \"one's knowledge.\" Prana\u015bimkha is known in Tibetan as Srog-lu-khur-ragyad and shows the states of the world and the body; while Pranatantra is known as Srog-gi-rgyud. Following Goraksha were twelve orders of Yogis, viz., N\u0101thapanthi, Pawapanthi, Pakkhapanthi, Gop\u0101lapanthi, Pagalapanthi, Ayipanthi, Chalipanthi, Hetupanthi, Magalapanthi and Sattan\u0101thapanthi. There is another order called N\u0101desv\u0101ri Jogi which still exists in the Buddhist system. And the superior Tirthin\u0101tha, Pr\u0101man\u0101tha and Krishnan\u0101tha are of the N\u0101desv\u0101ri order.\n\nThe reverend (Buddhagupta) then six months in the country of Malawa obtaining the bchud-len of Nimba; and afterwards spent four months in each of the following places:\u2014Singaladvip, Jhamigiri and Jagatnatha, from which latter place he went to Maru.\n\nWhile staying at the great shrihe in the city of Nagarathatha in the western country of Sindh he was seized with an almost mortal sickness, on recovery from which he always practised the meditation of gdal-stong and the physical exercises of swimming &c. From Nagarathatha he went for nine days through a robber-haunted desert to the shrine of the goddess Hingalachi. On his return he proceeded northwards to the cities of Molatana, Kabhela, Khoras\u0101na, Bajas\u0101na, and Goshala, the inhabitants of which countries were Mongols, Turks, Savage Muhammadans and Persians.\n\nThence he went to the Western Uroyan country (the land of Padma sambhava or Urgyan Rimpoche the founder of Lamaism). In Sanskrit it is called Odiyana, but it is better known by its Muhammadan name of Gajani. Here are some remains of the cave grub-chhen-lta-wai-na gzah-chan and of the palace of King Indrabhuddha the father of Prince Ti-med-Kun-idan (Vessantara of the J\u0101taka Tales). Then he visited the great shrines of Ilo Carpata (parvata). The chief place in Urgyan is Dhumasthira. He first went to the city of Duba, and thence proceeding\n\n9 sGrub-thobs. 10 ?

It is for India a very small and narrow city resembling Gh\u0101gh\u0101 and had four gates. Although Urgyan is now under the Muhammadans there is still some observance of virtue by the inhabitants among whom are Yogis, Upas\u0101kas, Tirtankaras and Savage (Muhammadans). The female devotees were Khecharas (witches) who possessed the power of injuring people, working miracles, and changing their form. The place is bounded on the south, east and west by three lakes. By travelling between the south and east lake you reach Bhalagkha the country of the Savage Turks, where in a corner is an incarnation of Acharya \u00c1\u015bva. named Mabodus-pa.\n\nThence he went to Khachhe (Ka\u015bmir) passing through several countries of the Upper Turks. He visited the Tirthaka shrines of Sardha, and Daradhad. Thence he proceeded to those Upper Turk countries bordering on Tibet, viz., Dharatabhota and Kaskara. After which he returned to his master Tirthina\u00e1th in Central India.\n\nHe then went southwards to visit a temple of I\u015bvara named Bhise\u015bvara, and proceeding further south, reached U\u015bira where there was a celebrated temple of Vajra Bhairab (?) Thence he visited the temple of Hevajra erected by Padma Vajra. After which he went to the Tirthankara dwelling of Abhu (Mt. Abu). From Kadcharu, he went to Soban\u00e1tha or Isvara the country of Sora\u015bta, and the self-created stone images there. He thence visited the countries in and around the Central Dakhan, viz. Marthatta, khanddes, Ta\u1e45gala, Bidranagara, Kartanaka, Trilinga, Tripala, Chincha, Malajara, Charitra, Marwara, Ko\u1e45kunada, Janachambrahara, Chandradura, Panchabhajar, Charamandal, Mermandal, Jalapandala, Talamandal, Rundmandal, Bhogamalyara, Kalinka, &c. From Ko\u1e45kuna he went through the ocean in a ship to Damidovipa(?) called Samlornaso by the natives and the Muhammadans. In that Island the esoteric doctrine prospered exceedingly. They possessed the books named Phurbu. The ten phro tantras, Heruka tantra and Vajrapani. The clergy are numerous, but none observe the Vinaya. The monks wore black robes and many drank wine. During his stay in that island for one year, the chief priest died. Then he returned by way of Sa\u1e45khadwip or the Conch-shell island, there was a shrine in the hill named Mangalasambhava. In that island he saw visitors from the island of Gatjan\u0101sa.\n\n18 Litterally 'sky-goers.' 19 ? Balk. 20 rta-mehhoy. 21 In another place it is spelt Dhumasirira. 22 Skt. 23 Stod-hor. 24 ? Kasghar.\nThence he proceeded to the island of Palata, and thence to Ceylon.\n\nSingaladvip where he remained for five years. Singala religion prospered exceedingly. The clergy were rich and possessed of great comfort; quite in keeping with the saying:\u2014Jala mukkitalu manika! Rane bane kunja' gharighari padma\u00fa n\u00e1ri! Bhala des\u00e1 Singala! \"The waters are full of pearls, the earth of jewels. The forests teem with elephants, and the women are like lotus flowers. A truly blessed country is Ceylon!\" Buddh\u00e1n\u00e1tha prayed for seven days at Buddha's foot-print known as Sripaduka. In a retired corner of the country named Kardala Buddh\u00e1n\u00e1tha visited a cave which had formerly been occupied by Ma\u015bakara\u015banti, the pupil of the great teacher Santipa when he visited Ceylon. Buddh\u00e1natha preached the religion to R\u00e1hesingkhapandarala and afterwards departed in a merchant ship to the small island of Ugalinga, and thence to the small island of Amuka which took thirty days to reach.\n\nThence proceeding southwards after four months they reached Jamegiri, where Buddh\u00e1natha stayed for about a year. Here are many great stone-images of Buddha, and also the seat of Acharye Nagarjuna on his visit to this place. There are many temples where offerings are being largely made, and one of the temples was erected by Nagarjuna.\n\nFrom this, going in a merchant ship for about one month's journey he reached Potala 'the king of mountains.'\n\nThis Potala is by some said to be the smaller one, but it seems really to be the Potala of the Buddhist texts. Here the pilgrim visited the following shrines, namely: 'the crystal cave of Basubhadra,' T\u00e1ra, with the frowning brow, 'the golden......' cave of the Asuras,' T\u00e1ra the seng-ldeng-gi-nags and the shrines of Brahma, Vishnu and Maha Isvara, and the temple of the hill. Around Mounttain Potala were a few scattered towns containing Buddhists, Mohammadans and Toitankaras. Most of the people worshipped 'Ponala Kala.'\n\nFrom here he sailed northwards, and reached Javadvipa, Java, &c. where there were a great many classes of clergy. Without staying here he continued the voyage to another island in mid-ocean named Bandvipa or\n\n25 rdo-rje-hjiga-byed. 26 Hang-phagug-gi-ghug-pa.\n27 Hgro-lding-gi-ghing. 28 bde-libyung.\n'the forest island,' which had formerly been visited by Guru Padma Sambhava. Here amid hills is a square temple containing a self-created stone-image of Hevajra. Then sailing towards the north he returned to Ceylon and Konkuna, in which latter place he saw the self-sprung image of Manjusri called Gyannakaya.\n\nProceeding to Malyara southwards in a ship he reached Tipperah, &c., the small country of Sambudha which adjoins Malyara. Here he heard the Vajrayana for the King named\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 who was the uncle of the Yogu Dina ganga. Thence he went to Bha\u1e45gala via Jagan\u0101tha and Tril\u012bga. Thence to Pundavarta-gavasadni from which in twenty days he reached the shrines of Ka\u015baramgaram and Devikota in the upper part of Tripura (Tipperah) where he remained in the monastery (?) formerly built by the great Siddhi Krishnakara. He also visited Haribhanja, Phunkrad and Palgru. In these countries the clergy and holy books were numerous and the religion prosperous. While there he heard a variety of esoteric teachings from the life of a great pundit named Dharma of the Haribhanja Chaitya believed to be a pupil of the great Siddhi \u2026\u2026...\u2014and also found a pandit Upasika named Hetagarbghanna. He also learned here the original authorities of may of the Sutras. Then he visited the \u2026\u2026... Chaitya. And he saw the magic circles of Janakaya and Sidhanyakadaka.\n\nFrom there he went in a merchant ship through the ocean called Pegu, and Moulmain, Padala and visited the island of Paign &c. (Pegu) where nutmegs and cloves grew and several other islands named S\u0101dadvipa, Mahasiwarnabhumi, Suryadvipa, Chandradvipa, and Sarpadvipa. And in a small island in the Ganganagara formerly visited by Krishnacharinbala. and Bhuwa \u2026\u2026 he mediated one point of the Mahamudra for three months.\n\nOn returning to India proper Buddhan\u0101tha visited Trilinga Bidyanagar, Karnadaka, (Karnatic) and Bhamdva. At the latter place he met the great Siddhi S\u0101ntagupta. Henceforth the pilgrim Buddhagupta known as Buddhagupta N\u0101tha. He was especially empowered by the yogini Dinakara and the great guru Gambhiramati. And he had taken instructions from the Superiors (Skt. Uttaru) Sudhigarbya, Gantapa, Betatikshana, Bhirabandhu, and Ghaghapa, all of whom were followers of the aforesaid\n\n---\n\n29 Nor-bzang. 30 Khre-gnyer-chan-ma. 31 sGo-gser. 32 seng-ldeng gi-nags.\n33 hphrog-byed hod. 34 gtsug-lag-knang.\ngreat Siddhi \u015a\u0101nta Gupta. He then went to the Mahabodhi in the Middle Country and made a small house for meditation close to the north of the Vajrasana. Afterwards he visited the eight great shrines and the Gridhakutigiri guha, and Prayaga. Forty-six years had now elapsed since his last meeting with Tirthin\u0101tha. Then he built an assembly house on Khagendri hill to which many yogis resorted, and he received royal patronage.\n\nAfterwards he proceeded by Jagat\u00f1\u0101tha to the country of Dhimig\u015bvara near Chigaipura where he stayed at the temple of ...... erected by Kayamtha. Thence he went to K\u0101maru (K\u0101marupa), whence he went to Lhasa visiting bSam-yas enroute. At Lhasa he saw Lord Sakye Muni\u2019s image; and he prayed to the eleven-headed (Avalokita) and to Kasarp\u0101si, and then went on to gTsang (Western Tibet). At this time he knew the following works:\u2014Kyevajra, Sam-buddha, Buddha..... Mah\u0101m\u0101ya, ........ Tarat\u0101nta, Sambh\u0101ramadala .......... k\u0101la. Vajr\u0101sanamula, ....... Kurnkulle, Mah\u0101kala and other tantras. After visiting several other parts of Tibet he left by skyid-grong to Nepal, where during two or three months he visited the chief shrines, and thence went to the country of Bhata also called Tsambrangna. After which he returned to Khagendra for about a month; and then proceeded by way of Bha\u1e45gala to Tripura and Devikota, in which last named place it is believed he died.\n\nLIBRARY.\n\nThe following additions have been made to the Library since the meeting held in January last.\n\nTRANSACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, AND JOURNALS,\n\npresented by the respective Societies and Editors.\n\nBombay.

Hughes, Esq.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following member:\n\nHenry F. Blanford, Esq., A.R.S.M., F.R.S., F.G.S.\n\nMr. Alex. Pedler, Vice-President, read a note on the death of Mr. Blanford:\n\nMr. Blanford was born in London in 1834, and was 58 years old when he died. He was one of the students who entered the Royal School of Mines at its commencement in 1851, and he had a distinguished career in that institution, taking the first Duke of Cornwall's scholarship. He subsequently studied at Freiburgh in Saxony, and in the year 1855 he came to Calcutta to take up an appointment in the Geological Survey of India. His connection with the Asiatic Society commenced soon after this, for he was elected a member in March, 1857. Mr. Blanford continued in the Geological Survey for about 6 years, and was engaged principally in investigating the geology of Southern India, and his most important work, while engaged in the Survey, was the examination of the cretaceous beds of the neighbourhood of Trichinopoly, and also separation of the Talchir strata, with their remarkable boulder bed, from the true coal-bearing or Damuda Rocks.\n\nIn 1862, owing mainly to ill-health, contracted during exposure incidental to geological surveying in India, he resigned his appointment, but when in England in the same year, he was offered an appointment in the Bengal Educational Department, and from 1862 to 1874 he was Professor of Physical Science at the Presidency College, Calcutta. Soon after his return to India, he became an active worker for the Society, and from 1863 to 1868 he acted as General Secretary to the Society, and it was during this period that he commenced the work by which his name will be best known. Mr. Blanford appears to have taken a keen interest in Meteorological matters from the time of his appointment to the Presidency College, and after the great Calcutta cyclone of 1864.\nhe, in conjunction with Col. Gastrell, prepared an exhaustive account of the storm, which was published in 1866. About this time he was appointed one of a small committee of three gentlemen, which organized The first system of storm warnings for the port of Calcutta, and made a commencement of the systematic study of Meteorology in Bengal, by establishing observatories and collecting Meteorological data. His services in this direction were shortly afterwards recognized by the Government of Bengal, who appointed him the first Bengal Meteorological Reporter in 1867, in which appointment he continued to work until in 1875 he was appointed to organise the Meteorological Department for the whole of India, and received the first Appointment of Meteorological Reporter to the Government of India, and he continued in this post up till the date of his retirement in May, 1889. The advance of Meteorological work in India during recent years is the best proof of the value of Mr. Blanford's labours in organizing and directing the Meteorological Department, and it is not too much to say that by his original Meteorological investigations Mr. Blanford also earned a well-deserved European reputation. During the whole of his career Mr. Blanford continued to take the greatest interest in the well-being of our Society, and he acted as Vice-President in 1882 and 1883, and again in 1885; while he was President of the Society in 1884. He was also elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London in the year 1880.\n\nHis principal original communications have been naturally in connection with Meteorology, and one of his latest and most valuable out of many very valuable investigations which he published, was an admirable Monograph on \"The Rainfall of India.\" His name will also be long remembered in connection with his work on cyclones, and their periodicity, and also from the fact that he found it possible to forecast the nature of the monsoon seasons in India, some months in advance. Even up to his last illness, Mr. Blanford was engaged in prosecuting original meteorological researches, and he had in the press at the date of his death a paper for the \"Indian Meteorological Memoirs\" called \"The Diurnal variation of the atmosphere in India;\" which, however, he did not live to finish.\n\nHis original communications to science were very numerous, and they are published, some by the Royal Society of London, a large number in the Asiatic Society's Journal and Proceedings, also a large number in the Indian Meteorological Memoirs, and in other places.\n\nThe extent of his communications, to the Asiatic Society may be judged by the fact that, in the \"Centenary Review,\" published by the Society at the beginning of 1884, the titles only of papers, &c., communicated by him to the Society, occupy nearly a whole page, and since\nthat date he has contributed three other papers. It is clear therefore, that to describe even the chief results of his investigations, would require a much longer space than is available. He was also the author of several valuable works, some of the best known of which are, the \"Physical Geography of India,\" \"The Climate of India,\" and \"The Indian Meteorologist's Vade Mecum.\"\n\nIn Mr. Blanford therefore, the Society has lost one of its most distinguished members and, one who did much towards its well-being.\n\nRESOLUTION\u2014\n\nThe Members of the Asiatic Society of Bengal desire to place on record their deep sense of the very great loss which the Asiatic Society of Bengal and Indian Physical Science have sustained by the death of their former President, and Vice-President, Mr. Henry F. Blanford, and to express their great sorrow at the sad event that has deprived the Society of one of its most active and enthusiastic supporters and its members of a much esteemed colleague and friend.\n\nThe Secretary read the names of the following gentlemen who had been appointed to serve on the various Committees for the present year:\n\nFINANCE AND VISITING COMMITTEE.\n\nH.

Further Antiquities in the Hutwa Raj and its vicinity.\u2014By Babu Gerindra Nath Dutt.\n\n(Abstract).\n\nBelwa Sirsea has been several times visited by me since it was last reported on to the Society. The place was excavated at the request of Dr. Hoernle but only a few fragments of mutilated figures were found in it. Photographs of the principal image and of the door-frames were taken by Babu Narendra N\u00e1th Dutt amidst a shower of rain and so they did not turn out as desired. The photographs are in the possession of the Society.\n\nWhen cleansing the well at a depth of three feet, I found walls probably those of the old temple which was divided into two rooms, the small one in which the big image was located and the larger one at the N. E. of the former enclosing the well and the peepul tree.\n\nCheroos' gh\u00e1t mentioned in my last paper is a silted up jhil of about one hundred bigh\u00e1s frequented by aquatic birds. Strong masonry works, still bristle on its sides. The Cheroos are the remnant of an aboriginal race still to be found in this part of the country. Many of them have got jagirs from the Bethia Raj for their services as guards and peons. There is another aboriginal race in these parts called Moosahars who were very fine huntsmen, who killed wild pigs and even fish with their bows and arrows.\n\nWhile digging a tank in the vicinity of Kusonndhee, a small figure was found. It has four hands, (chakra) and the small figure of Nri Sinha, tearing Hiranyakashipu, on his lap. The figure is placed outside Sivaji's temple at Kusondhee five miles from Hutwa. At a place\nbetween Gopalgung and Hutwa named Thaway there is a small image exactly resembling the big image of Belwa called alike Bhairoji's Murty by the people placed on the outer wall of the famous temple of Durg\u00e1. People cannot say whence the image was obtained. There is a fine legend in connection with the temple of Durg\u00e1.\n\nMah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 Jubar\u00e1j S\u00e1hi B\u00e1h\u00e1dur, ninety-fifth in descent from the founder of the Hutwa raj, was several times defeated in his wars with the neighbouring r\u00e1j\u00e1 Kabul Mahammed of Burhuria. After his last defeat the Maharaja was fleeing through the jungles with a handful of followers when the goddess Bhav\u00e1n\u00ed appeared to him in a dream and complained that she was very miserable under the Muhammadan rule. She encouraged the Maharaja to fight and promised her aid. \"The moment you commence your journey,\" she said, \"you will see a jackal and a serpent, bow down to the former and kill the latter.\" The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 acted according to her instructions and gained a complete victory over his adversary at the battle of Ramachandrapur, a mile east of Thaway. The image of Durg\u00e1 was found in the forest of Thaway under a singular and peculiar tree. The leaves of the tree were sent to the Society for identification. It is reported that one of the feet of the goddess has sunk to a fathomless depth and the other is out resting on the figure of a lion. The Mah\u00e1r\u00e1j\u00e1 of Hutwa has raised a splendid temple for the goddess and still regards the jackal with very kindly feelings. They are given Balibhog by the Raj on the Chaiti-navami day. The Maharaja still holds the pergunna Sipa which his ancestors conquered from Kabul Mahammed whose descendants still live in a decayed fort close by. Kabul Mahammed perhaps belonged to a Pathan family whom, it was the policy of Akb\u00e1r and his son, to suppress by encouraging neighbouring Hindu chiefs to quarrel with them.\n\nI often doubted whether these relics of antiquity were of Hindu or of Buddhistic origin. But an inspection of the Nirv\u00e1na statue of Buddha and other remains at Kushinagara leaves no doubt in my mind of their Buddhistic origin. These have been so well described by Cunningham, Carleyle and Garrick that I need not repeat the description here. The only thing that I wish to mention in connection with this is, that the temple has now found a guardian and small fee is levied from every visitor. Fixed on the walls of the temple is the mutilated figure of a female devotee in meditative posture. And on the outer side of the temple is fixed the image of Ganes\u00e1 with four hands elephantine proboscis and the rat as his conveyance. A slab containing an inscription lies close by. A few yards off a big statue of Buddha in meditative posture sitting on padm\u00e1sava, was found under a peepul tree. Its nose, eyes and chin are mutilated. The figure is enclosed in an arch\nresting on ornamented pillars on both sides, of which are figures of elephants ridden over by a form like the fabulous unicorn, which in its turn is again ridden over by male human figures by tight reins. On the head of elephants stands a human figure keeping one of its feet there and the other on the tusk. Both these figures are mutilated. Above the unicorn and on both the sides of the arch are figures of sharks with yawned mouth catching hold of the right legs of two human figures down to the knee. The whole figure is greatly mutilated. The whole image is cracked right through and daubed with vermilion by the villagers who call it Matha Kunwar as the image at Kushi Nagara is called Bodh Kunwar. Both as regards workmanship and arrangement of figures it resembles the Belwa Buddha figure.\n\nAt Garshikhal there is a finely chiselled phallus of Mahadeva quite unimpaired, of excellently polished black marble dug out of some four feet under-ground along with several Budhistic images.\n\nAt Bellia-Bhagalpur, there is an ancient pillar with an inscription which has already been given in Carlisle's report. The inscription is mutilated. The villagers say that a portion of it was cut away by the Emperor Akbar who was terrified to see blood coming out of it. They consider the pillar to have been the flag-staff of an ancient king named Bhagadanta.\n\nThe figure at Kushinagara is twenty-one feet long, and I think that as people believed Buddha to belong to the Dvapara age when men had a height of 14 cubits, his worshippers gave him exactly that dimension. It appears to have been erected not immediately after Buddha's death but at a much later date.\n\n2. Note on the Mausoleum of Job Charnock and the Bones recently discovered within it.\u2014By The Rev. H. B. Hyde, M. A.\n\nThe Charnock Mausoleum in St. John's Churchyard is a massive structure, octagonal in form with a double dome. In each face there is a low and narrow archway. It was placed so as immediately to front the original entrance to the Burying-ground, which opened north of it. It is fair to assume that the date of the structure, which has every appearance of great antiquity, is that of the cutting of the inscription in memory of Job Charnock himself. This date is ascertainable within narrow limits. There are 4 black stone slabs now within the tomb, two of them certainly removed thither from other parts of the ground. Of the remaining two, one, of surprising thickness, is to the memory of Catherine White, the youngest daughter of Job, who died on the 21st January 1709; to this slab a fellow is found outside the mausoleum, exactly like it in size and\ndetails of ornament; this latter is to the memory of Jonathan White, 2nd of Council, Catherine's husband, who died January 3rd, 1704. It is one of 30 or more monumental slabs which were removed from other parts of ground when the ruinous tombs were dismantled in 1802. As Catherine's epitaph and this one must have originally been set close together, we may therefore reject her's also from being, as is usually supposed, one of the proper occupants of the mausoleum. It must be acknowledged that this slab to Catherine is so strikingly like, both in size and ornament, to that of her father, beside which it is now fixed upright, that it would never occur to the casual observer, especially if he had not noticed her husband's epitaph outside, that the memorials to Job and Catherine were not originally intended to lie side by side. A closer observer will readily detect a striking difference in the style of lettering.\n\nOne slab only therefore now remains for consideration that which bears the name of the Father of Calcutta himself. This slab contains two inscriptions, the former is to Job Charnock, who died January 10th, 1693, and the latter to his eldest daughter, Mary, wife of Charles Eyre, Charnock's next successor but one in the Bengal agency; she died on February 19th, 1694. A close inspection of this slab and comparison of the lettering of the two inscriptions make it abundantly plain that they are not contemporaneous works but that the lower half of the slab had been purposely left blank to receive such an inscription as it now exhibits. Thus the mausoleum with originally one epitaph must have been completed some time prior to the year 1697, and the addition made to it prior to the early part of 1698 when Mr. Eyre returned home, for it is to be presumed, from the terms of the epitaph, that he was at the time when it was written actually \"prefect of the English.\" It is true he returned in 1700 and for a few months resumed his former charge, but it was with the title of knighthood which does not distinguish his name in the epitaph.\n\nCharles Eyre, as Charnock's son-in-law, and successor in the agency, is the likeliest person to have erected the mausoleum. It is possible that he may have done so at the charge of the Company, for the court had certainly a very high opinion of the worth of its old servant, but no evidence of this is forthcoming, and it is likely that so exceptional a testimonial of good opinion as the dedication to his memory of this costly monument by the company would have found some expression in the epitaph.\n\nAs an argument that the mausoleum is not likely to have been built within a good twelve month and more of Charnock's death, may be adduced the disorderly condition of the factory at that period. On the 12th of August 1693, Sir John Goldsborough, the Company's Supervisor,\nCommissary-General and Chief Governor in East India, visited the settlement, and has left an account of the deplorable state of affairs he found there. Charnock's place was filled by Mr. Francis Ellis, an old servant of the Company, who had done nothing to reform the licentious and riotous living of the resident English which had strangely disgraced the two years and five months of Charnock's government of his new settlement. These disorders require some explanation, seeing that Charnock in Hughli and Cossimbazar was certainly a man of will and of honour in his discharge of his duty towards his masters. They may be partly explained by supposing that his physical and mental constitution had, after an abnormally long and trying residence in Bengal, at length broken down. An indolence crept over him which became marked by a timorousness strange to his former self-reliant character. The expectation of the formation of the rival company daunted him. \"The law courts at Madras scared him exceedingly, so that he was afraid to think of meddling with any body.\" \"Everyone did that which seemed good in his own eyes.\" He never even planned out the premises of a factory: everyone built houses, enclosed lands, or dug tanks just as and when he chose. His feebleness was accompanied by a restless temper and savage moods. Tradition, as it came to Captain Hamilton a few years later, said that he loved to inflict the chabuk on his native subordinates for transgression of his arbitrary commands, and that \"the execution was generally done when he was at dinner, so near his dining room that the groans and cries of the poor delinquents served him for music.\" Some said he turned heathen and sacrificed a fowl on the grave of his native wife at each anniversary of her death. Sir John Goldsborough asserts that he developed a fancy for encouraging quarrels between his subordinates; and leaving his business affairs in the hands of the Captain of his little garrison, (now reduced to a sergeant, two drummers and twenty sepoys,) he used to amuse himself with the help of the said sergeant in arranging duels out of the quarrels he had fomented. While the worshipful agent led the disorders, the Captain pandered to the debaucheries. He kept, without being required to pay the fees for a license, a public punch-house and billiard table, and he let his wife turn papist without control.\"\n\nIt is quite likely that in the markedly devout mould in which Charnock's epitaph is couched, we should trace a strain of vindication on Eyre's part as against detractors of the estimable qualities which marked his father-in-law's true character ere his mind became clouded in his last two years. It is remarkable that the epitaph attributes his Christian burial to the will of the deceased himself and the Christian hope expressed is uttered in Charnock's name.\nThe epitaph reads as follows:\n\nD. O. M.\n\nJobus Charnock, Armiger\nAnglus; et nup. in hoc\nregno Bengalensi dignissim, Anglorum\nAgens. Mortalitatis suae exuvias\nSub hoc marmore depositit, ut\nin spe beat\u00e6 resurrectionis ad\nChristi judicis adventum obdormirent.\nQui postquam in solo non\nSuo peregrinatus esset dice.\nReversus est domum su\u00e6 \u00e6ternitatis decimo die Januarii 1692.\n\nMr. Eyre took charge of the agency on the 25th January 1694, and since the inscription slab was in situ, with its lower half vacant in February 1694, the erection of the mausoleum cannot therefore be dated many months earlier or later than the year 1695. We may certainly therefore claim it to be the oldest example of British masonry now existing in Calcutta. The original Fort William itself was not begun till 1696 and was 3 years in building.\n\nIn the year 1696, then, we may assume the mausoleum stood as we see it now and contained within it a table monument bearing on its upper face the black slab with the inscription, brought, it is usually thought, from Madras. We may assume that the monument was of table shape from the fact that the slab is worked in mouldings on the under-side of its edge, suggesting that it was to project somewhat all round beyond a base of masonry.\n\nThere can be no doubt therefore that whoever else may have been afterwards interred within the great tomb, the body of Charnock must have occupied the central position. It had been the general impression derived from the resonance of the floor of the mausoleum when struck by the foot about the centre that it contained a hollow vault. This floor having become decayed and the whole edifice being in November last under repair by the Department of Public Works, it was thought well to take advantage of the opportunity before a new floor was put in and ascertain by some small excavations whether such a vault existed or not. Legend affirmed that Charnock had been interred in the same grave with his native wife, and the vault might contain some evidence in support or refutation of this legend, or perchance coffin-plates or other objects that might afford historical interest. About 4 feet of earth was accordingly opened but no trace of a vault appeared except that the quantity of bricks mixed up with the earth suggested that a brick grave had origi-\nginally existed which might have been destroyed when Mr. Eyre opened\nthe tomb to lay the remains of his wife Catherine beside those of her\nfather in February 1694. The excavation was then ordered to be stopped,\nbut through some misunderstanding it was continued. On visiting the\nmausoleum next morning, viz.:\u2014on Tuesday, the 22nd of November last,\nI found that the grave had been opened to a depth of fully six feet, at\nwhich depth the diggers had stopped having met with a trace of human\nremains. The excavation was somewhat smaller than an ordinary grave\nand lay E. and W. in the centre of the floor. At the bottom of it the\nworkmen had cleared a level, at the western end of which they were be-\nginning to dig a little deeper when a bone became visible. This bone\nwas left in situ, undisturbed, and the digging had ceased on its discov-\nery. On seeing this bone I felt sure it could be no other than one of\nthe bones of the left forearm of the person buried, which must have lain\ncrossed upon the breast. A little beyond it I observed a small object in\nthe earth which I took at first for a large coffin nail, but on this being\nhanded up to me it was very apparent that it was the largest joint, of\nprobably a middle finger, and that, judging from its position relatively\nto the bone, of the left hand. This bone I replaced. I permitted no\nmore earth to be removed save only a little above and to the east of the\nremains, sufficient to reveal a black stratum in the soil which might have\nbeen the decayed coffin-lid. It was quite evident that a few more strokes\nof the spade would discover the rest of the skeleton, perhaps perfect\nafter just 200 years of burial. There can be no reasonable doubt, but\nthat arguing from the position of the body and the depth at which it lay,\nit was the very one, to enshrine which only, the mausoleum was ori-\nginally built. The mortal part of the Father of Calcutta himself.\n\nHaving seen what I did, I had the grave filled in, for I feared to leave\nit open lest the coolies might ransack its contents in search of rings or\nother valuables, and further I felt it improper, in view of the interest\nwhich must attach to such investigation, to permit myself to continue it\nalone. If it were to be prosecuted at all it should at least be in presence\nof a representative company of Englishmen. For my own part with the\nbones of the famous pioneer's hand accidentally discovered before me,\nand the strange and solemn statement of his epitaph just above them\nthat he had laid his mortal remains there himself\u2014\"ut in spe beat\u00e6 re-\nsurrectionis ad Christi judicis adventum obdormirent,\" I felt strongly\nrestrained from examining them further.\n\nThe discovery was at once duly reported to the several heads of the\ncivil and ecclesiastical departments of Government within whose jurisdic-\ntion it had been made.\nThe bones disclosed lie at a depth of six feet below the middle of a line drawn upon the floor between the innermost western edges of the S. W. and N. W. entrances to the mausoleum.\n\nThe epitaph added beneath Job Charnock's is:\n\nPariter jacet\nMaria, Jobi Primogenita, Caroli Eyre Anglorum\nhicce Prefecti Conjux Charissima.\nQue obit 19 die Februarii A.D. 1694.\n\nThat on the slab now beside the former is:\n\nHic jacet\nOatherina White\nDomini Jonathanis White, uxor dilectissima et\nro\u00fb \u03bc\u03b1\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1'\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 Jobi Charnock\nfilia natu minima;\nquae primo in partu et \u00e6tatis flore\nAnnum agens unum de viginti.\nMortem obit heu! immaturam 21 Januarii 1702\nSiste parumper, Christiane Lector\n(Vel quis es tandem) et mecum defle\nDuram sexus muliebris sortem\nQui per elapsa tot annorum millia\nCulpam prim' Eva luit Parentis\nEt luet usque; Dum oternum stabit\nIn dolore paries filios.\u2014Genesis iii. 16.\n\n3.

Peal, Esq.,\nB\u00e1bu Sarat Chandra Das, B\u00e1bu Raj Kumar Sarbadhikari,\nE. Thurston, Esq.\n\nThe Philological Secretary read reports on the following finds of Treasure Trove Coins:\n\n(I) Report on 30 old silver coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of K\u00e1mr\u00fap, with his No. 2789, dated the 9th September, 1892.\n\nIn his report, sent with his Memo. No. 4718, dated Gauhati, the 16th March 1892, the Officiating Deputy Commissioner of K\u00e1mr\u00fap, states that the coins were found on the 24th January 1892, by a cooly in the employment of the Bengal and Assam Railway, presumably in the course of some excavations made for the Railway, though no particulars as to the place and manner of finding are mentioned.\n\nSome of the coins are in a rather indifferent condition, and it was somewhat troublesome to identify them. But Bengal coins, of certain descriptions are not commonly found, and possess therefore an unusual numismatic interest. I have now ascertained that most of the coins are issues of the following of the so-called \"Independent Sult\u00e1ns,\" of Bengal: Fakhru-d-d\u00edn Mub\u00e1rak Sh\u00e1h (1338\u20131349 A.D.), Shamsu-d-d\u00edn Ily\u00e1s Sh\u00e1h (1339\u20131358 A.D.), Sikandar Sh\u00e1h (1359\u20131389 A.D.), and Ghiy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn 'Azam Sh\u00e1h (1389\u20131396 A.D.). But one coin belongs to the Imperial Delhi issue of Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h II (1392\u20131399 A.D.), and three others to that of one of the early Dependant Governors of Bengal, Ghiy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h (1310\u20131330 A.D.). Accordingly the coins of the find cover a period of nearly a century (from 1310 to 1399 A.D.).\n\nThe following is a detailed statement of them:\n\n| No. of specimens |\n|------------------|\n| A.

With the coins was also forwarded a \"metal plate image brass piece,\" which appears to have been found with the coins.\n\nOne of the coins is of pure gold; all the others are of a mixed metal containing gold in varying proportions, which could only be ascertained by means of a regular assay.\n\nThey are of two different sizes. Ten (incl. the pure gold coin) are of a large size, \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch in diameter, and 46 are of a small size, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch in diameter.\n\nThey all show on the obverse, the standing figure of Hanum\u00e1n, with body turned to front, but feet to right, and head to left. In the proper right hand he apparently holds a club. On the right and left, in the field, are two scrolls, one of which probably represents his tail. The whole is enclosed within a marginal circle of dots. The figure is fairly distinct on the gold coin, but very crude on those of mixed metal. The reverse, of all coins, shows the name of the king, in large N\u00e1gar\u00ed characters, peculiar to the time, and again enclosed within a marginal circle of dots.\n\nAll the coins belong to kings of the so-called Kalachuri dynasty of Chedi, who had their capital at Ratanpur (Ratanpur) in Northern Chhatisgarh. Information on this dynasty will be found in Sir Alexander Cunningham's Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. XVII, p. 71 fg. The coins represented in the find, belong to the following members of the dynasty: J\u00e1jalla Deva (26 specimens), Ratna Deva (29), Prithv\u00ed Deva (1 pure gold). In the Report, referred to, the following genealogical list is given:\n\n| Serial No. | Probable date of accession | Names of Kings | Actual dates from Inscriptions |\n|------------|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| 1          | 1000 A.D.                 | Kakalla       |                               |\n| 2          | 1030                      | Ratna R\u00e1ja    |                               |\n| 3          | 1060                      | Prithv\u00ed Deva  |                               |\n| 4          | 1090                      | J\u00e1jalla Deva  | 1115 A.D.                     |\n| 5          | 1120                      | Ratna Deva    |                               |\n| 6          | 1140                      | Prithv\u00ed Deva  | 1145, 1150, 1159, 1168 A.D.   |\n\nThe coins may belong either to Nos. 2, 3, 4 of the list, or to Nos. 4, 5, 6; more probably to the latter three kings.\nThe find is of considerable numismatic interest, for two reasons. In the first place: coins of the Chedi dynasty are very rare; of Gangeya Deva, gold, silver and copper coins are known (see Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. X, p. 25); and of Prithvi Deva, gold coins are \"sufficiently common\" (see Prinsep's Indian Antiquities, Vol. I, p. 292, and Thomas' Chronicles, No. 17, p. 19). But, so far as I know, no coins of any other king have become known.\n\nIn the second place, all coins of the Kalachuri dynasty which have hitherto become known show on the obverse \"the four-armed goddess Durg\u00e1, seated to front.\" On the other hand the Chandel kings show, on their coins, either the goddess Durg\u00e1 seated, or Hanum\u00e1n standing; and it has been, hitherto, supposed that the substitution of Hanum\u00e1n for Durg\u00e1 was due to the Chandel kings, who partly imitated the Kalachuri coinage, partly departed from it, in the obverse device of their own coinage (see Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. X, p. 25). The coins of the present find prove that this supposition is not any longer tenable, and that the Kalachuri kings, already, possessed a coinage with the obverse device of Hanum\u00e1n. The lists of Chandel kings (see Archaeological Survey Reports, Vol. XXI, p. 80, Journal As. Soc. Beng., Vol. L, p. 23) contain no names of J\u00e1jalla Deva and Ratna Deva. They contain a king Prithvi Varma, but no Prithvi Deva; and it may be noted that while the Kalachuris are always distinguished as \"Deva,\" the Chandels are always called \"Varma\"\u2014a circumstance which also proves that the \"Prithvi Deva,\" whose gold coins are described by Prinsep and Thomas (above referred to), is the Kalachuri king of that name, not the Chandel Prithvi Varma.\n\nThe following is a detailed list of the coins:\n\nI.

A pupil of mine, Mr. James Morison, has now studied the Sanskrit Prithivir\u0101ja-vijaya, which I found in 1875 in K\u0101shm\u012br, together with its commentary by Jonar\u0101ja, written between A.D. 1450-75. The author was certainly a contemporary of Prithivir\u0101ja and one of his court poets. He probably was a Kashmirian and was a thoroughly good Kavi and P\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dit. His account of the Chauh\u0101ns contradicts Chand's in every particular and agrees with that of the inscriptions of V.S. 1030 and V.S. 1225.* Prithivir\u0101ja's pedigree is exactly that given in these documents, and various synchronistic facts mentioned in the Vijaya also agree with what we know from other sources, e.g., the M\u0101lw\u0101 and Gujar\u0101t inscriptions.\n\nWith regard to Prithivir\u0101ja's father Some\u015bvara, we now learn that he was the son of Ar\u1e47or\u0101ja and his Chanlukya wife K\u0101\u00f1chana-devi, the daughter of the great King Jayasimha Siddhar\u0101ja of Gujar\u0101t. Ar\u1e47or\u0101ja's first wife was Sadhav\u0101, a princess of M\u0101rw\u0101r, who bore him two sons, one whose name is not given in the Vijaya or in the inscriptions and Vigrahar\u0101ja-Vi\u015baladeva.\n\nThe unnamed eldest son murdered his father, or as the poet says, 'rendered to him the same service which Bharigu's son (Parasur\u0101ma) rendered to his mother,' and 'then went out like a batt\u012b, leaving behind an evil smell.' Vigrahar\u0101ja succeeded his father. After him a son of his came to the throne, and then a son of the parricide, Prithivibh\u0101ja on Prithivir\u0101ja.\n\nThen Some\u015bvara was raised to the throne by the ministers. All this long time he had been in foreign countries. His maternal grandfather Jayasimha had educated him, and later on he had gone to Tripura, the capital of Chedi (the Jabalpur district,) and had married Kar\u1e47\u0101r\u0101devi, the daughter of the Chedi King. The latter bore to him Prithivir\u0101ja (the hero of the poem) and Harir\u0101ja. Some\u015bvara died soon after his accession to the gaddi of Ajayamera, and Kar\u1e47\u0101r\u0101devi governed during her son's minority, with the help of a minister K\u0101damba-V\u0101ma, i.e., V\u0101ma of the K\u0101damba race.\n\nThere is not a trace of a statement that Prithivir\u0101ja was the son of the daughter of Ana\u1e45gap\u0101la the king of Delhi, or that he was adopted by him; and it is remarkable that the old Muhammadan historians do not say that Prithivir\u0101ja ruled over Delhi. With them, he is sim-\n\n* Vide J.A.S.B., Vol. LV, Part I, for 1886, pp. 15 and ff.\u2014Ed.\nply king of Ajmer, and was slain in Ajmer for treason against his conquerors, who had left him some power in his own country.\n\nI am afraid that the history of this period sadly wants revision, and Chand's Rasau had better be left unprinted. It is a forgery as Marardhan of Jodhpur, and Syamaldas of Udaipur, have said long ago. According to the Vijaya, the name of Prithiviraja's Vadiraja, or chief bard, was Prithivibhata, not Chand Bardai.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited two rare gold Gupta Coins sent by Mr. Rivett-Carnac to be added to his well-known Gupta coin collection lately purchased by the Government of India for the Indian Museum. One of them, he said, was a coin of Kumara Gupta I, of the so-called \"Swordsman\" type. This was one of the rarest types of the Gupta class of coins. It will be seen by a reference to Mr. Smith's descriptive catalogue of those coins, published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1889 (p. 93), that hitherto only two coins of the Swordsman type were known to exist, one in the British Museum and the other in the Bodleian Library in Oxford. They are both said to have been found in the bed of the Ganges near Patna. Where the coin, now belonging to the Indian Museum was found, is not known. But it is a genuine specimen, and has a gold loop soldered to its rim, showing that it was used as an amulet or ornament. The name of Swordsman is given to the coin, because it shows on its obverse the standing figure of king Kumara Gupta, with his left hand resting on the hilt of a straight sword which hangs from his waist. The king's name is given in full on the reverse, and on the obverse under the abbreviation Ku. This is one of the most valuable additions made to the coin cabinet of the Indian Museum.\n\nThe other coin is one of Chandra Gupta II, of the so-called \"Umbrella\" type. It is fully described in Mr. Smith's Catalogue, p. 91, where seven known specimen are enumerated. It is therefore also one of the rarer types of the Gupta class of coins. The reverse figure (female goddess), is usually represented as standing on a low pedestal or on a monster (?); but in the present specimen she is not standing on anything at all, unless (which is possible) the object on which she stood, is entirely clipped away. This coin, too, has a loop attached to it, showing that it was used to be worn.\n\nDr. Hoernle, also, exhibited a gold Indo-Scythian coin, lately sent by Mr. Rivett-Carnac. It belongs to the well-known kind of which numerous specimens are known to exist, showing on the obverse the Nagari letters va and su, placed one above the other, in Chinese fashion. These probably give the name of the Indo-Scythian king Vasu Deva, who reigned towards the end of the 2nd cent. A.D.\nMr. C. R. Wilson exhibited two old plans of old Fort William and old Calcutta and read a short note on the subject by Dr. Buteed. The note will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. *On the Early Study of Indian Vernaculars in Europe.*\u2014By G. A. Grierson, Esq., C.

S.\n\nThe Secretary reported the death of the following members:\n\nJames Wood-Mason, Esq., (Ordinary Member).\nProfessor J. O. Westwood (Honorary Member).\nMons. E. Renan (Honorary Member).\n\nDr. A. W. Alcock read an obituary notice of the death of Mr. Wood-Mason:\n\nJames Wood-Mason was born in December 1846, and was educated at Charterhouse and Oxford. He early evinced an inclination towards Natural Science, being at first specially interested in Geology, and even before his twenty-third year he had published several palaeontological papers in the Proceedings and in the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society. In 1869 he came out to India as Assistant Curator of the Indian Museum, for which post he had been selected by Professor Huxley and Sir Joseph Hooker, and in 1870 he became a member of this Society.\n\nHis interest in Natural Science was shown immediately he joined the Society, when he contributed his first paper\u2014\"On Polydactylism in a Horse\"\u2014to the Proceedings, and was sustained throughout the whole twenty-two years of his membership, during the greater part of which period\u2014until he began to be incapacitated by serious organic disease\u2014he was a constant contributor to the Proceedings and Journal. His papers in the Society's publications exhibit the comprehensive extent of his attainments, embodying as they do the results of original investigation in most branches of Zoology and in Ethnology in its morphological and geological aspects. His most numerous and most important contributions however were upon Insects,\u2014especially the Mantid\u00e6 and Phasmid\u00e6\u2014and upon the general subject of the Crustacea, which early attracted him. In 1873 he became Natural History Secretary, and during the greater part of the next sixteen years, though not continuously, he edited Part II of the Society's Journal with conspicuous ability and success. In 1887 he was elected a Vice-President of the Society. Outside the limits of the Society his devotion to Zoology was marked with no less distinguished ability and success, and in the course of his\nofficial career he became Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Museum, Professor of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy in the Medical College, and finally, on the retirement of Dr. Anderson in 1887, Superintendent of the Museum. In 1888 he was made a Fellow of the University of Calcutta.\n\nHis record of work, outside his official routine, and beyond his connexion with the Society, is a long and varied one, and embraces explorations in the field, the publication of his scientific researches, and economic inquiries. Although his purely scientific work completely overshadows his economic work, yet his attitude to economics in the proper place was not unfriendly. With the more aggressive economists he had little sympathy, believing that science diligently and methodically pursued for its own sake would be far more likely to yield incidental benefits to civilization than would science studied disconnectedly for the sake of the practical man alone. In the field he explored, in 1872, the marine fauna of the Andamans, and again, in 1873, that of the Nicobars, and in 1888 he went for a time as Naturalist on board Her Majesty's Indian Marine Survey Steamer 'Investigator.' As a result of these field excursions he added largely to our knowledge of the life of the Bay of Bengal, and greatly enriched the collections in the Indian Museum. He also, in the course of economic inquiries into the Tea-bug, and into the Diseases of Silkworms, travelled and collected largely in Assam, Cachar and Lower Bengal.\n\nHe contributed a few papers to the Royal Zoological, and Entomological Societies, and a great many to the Annals and Magazine of Natural History, which embodied his original work not only in the field of systematic and descriptive zoology, but upon morphology\u2014especially the morphology of Arthropoda; upon phylogeny\u2014especially the phylogeny of Insecta; upon physiology, and upon the philosophy of zoology. It was in this last branch of the science that his inquiring, original genius found its happiest exercise, and he was particularly interested in all problems as to the significance of animal organs. More than most systematic zoologists was he dissatisfied with the dry facts of animal structure, and his desire to see through these facts into their origin and meaning\u2014to make zoology really a science of living beings\u2014may be said to have been a passion with him. Unfortunately his published work in this direction does not represent a fraction of his accumulated knowledge, principally because he had an almost fastidious objection to publishing anything that was not exhaustively complete. But this philosophical bent of his mind is amply illustrated by his papers on the claspers, and on the antenn\u00e6, and on the femoral brushes of the Mantid\u00e6; on the mode in which the young of Astacid\u00e6\nattach themselves to the mother; on the stridulating organs of Crustacea, of Arachnida, and of Myriapoda; on sexual characters in Mollusca; on Mimicry; on the scent-glands of Scorpion-spiders; on the meaning of Viviparity; etc. In purely systematic zoology his principal published works were:\u2014(1) A Catalogue of the Mantodea which was not completed at the time of his death, and (2) A series of papers on the Butterflies of the Andamans and Nicobars and of Cachar, written in collaboration with Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville. These papers were the result of work undertaken between the years 1880\u201383, when Mr. de Nic\u00e9ville was employed on the staff of the Museum, during which period he worked with that gentleman almost exclusively at the Lepidoptera of the Indian region, the result being to greatly increase the collections in the Indian Museum and to add largely to faunistic knowledge. In this series of papers must specially be mentioned a very curious case of mimicry between two distinct groups of Papilios, which he discovered. Another systematic work of considerable importance was his series of descriptions and illustrations of the Deep-Sea Crustacea dredged by the 'Investigator.' He also had in contemplation a complete catalogue of the Crustacea for which, however, he had only collected and systematized the bibliography.\n\nHis principal economic work consisted of Reports on the Tea-mite and other Insect-pests, and on certain diseases of Silkworms. He also formed for the Indo-Colonial Exhibition a collection illustrative of Indian sericulture, for which he received the thanks of Government.\n\nHis influence as a Naturalist extended far beyond the Museum and the realm of scientific literature: to beginners he was always ready to give advice and assistance at any sacrifice to himself: he had no contempt for amateurs, and no jealousy of fellow-workers: but he had truly and singly at heart the advancement of science, as is amply shown by his work upon the 'Investigator' Zoological Reports, and by his work in connexion with the establishment of the Calcutta Microscopical Society\u2014a Society mainly of amateurs.\n\nHis health seems never to have been really robust, and recent events show that he must for many years have been suffering from one of the most debilitating and enervating of all organic diseases. But it was not until quite the end of last year that the outward signs of it became so manifest as to arouse the anxiety of his friends.\n\nHe was in a critical state of health when he left Calcutta on the 5th of April, and he died on the 6th of May, just as he was nearing the shores of his native country. Although of late years, owing to his prolonged absence from England, he had no very active connexion with any of the learned societies there, yet he was a fellow of the Zoological\nand Entomological Societies of London and of the Zoological-Botanical Society of Vienna.\n\nThe Honorary Secretary read an obituary notice of the death of Professor Westwood prepared by Mr. E. C. Cotes:\n\nBy the death at a very advanced age of Professor J. O. Westwood the Asiatic Society of Bengal has lost an Honorary Member who was the most distinguished systematic Entomologist of his day. Besides being Hope Professor of Zoology in the University of Oxford, and a Gold Medallist of the Royal Society, Professor Westwood was appointed in 1883, as a special distinction, to be Honorary Life President of the Entomological Society of London; while scientific bodies in many parts of the world have vied with each other in conferring honorary membership upon him.\n\nProfessor Westwood's writings include papers upon almost every branch of the Arthropoda. Hagen, in his Bibliotheca entomologica, enumerates no less than three hundred and seventy-nine entomological papers which bear his name and which are all more or less valuable, but his greatest achievement is probably the general Manual of Entomology which he published under the unpretending title of \"An Introduction to the Modern Classification of Insects.\" At the time when it was written this work was far in advance of any treatise of its kind, and though half a century of unprecedented activity in Entomological research has since elapsed, it remains a standard authority which no student of the subject can afford to neglect. Previous to the appearance of Westwood's \"Introduction,\" no complete examination had been made of the relative position which the numerous families of insects occupy in the natural series; Westwood made a minute comparative study of the characters upon which the classification was based, and after a number of years of patient research, produced a work which at once placed the science of systematic Entomology upon a far sounder basis than it had previously occupied.\n\nAs a man he was unpretending in the extreme and was almost entirely wrapped up in his scientific pursuits. His outspoken criticism of everything he disapproved made him a few enemies, but no one who knew him intimately could avoid liking the transparent sincerity and kindliness of his rugged nature, however much they might differ from him in opinion.\nThe Philological Secretary read reports on the following finds of Treasure Trove Coins:\n\nReport on 148 old coins forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner, Hissar, with his No. 32 G, dated 7th January, 1893.\n\n1. The coins are stated to have been found in Masudpur, Tahsil Hansi, District Hissar, under circumstances not further specified. The list, transmitted with the coins, stated them to consist of coins of Muhammad Shah 58, Ghay\u0101s\u016b-d-in Tughlaq Sh\u0101h 55, F\u012broz Shah 4, Abu Zafar Muhammad Shah 12, Mu\u1e25ammad Tughlaq Sh\u0101h 1, Mub\u0101rak Sh\u0101h 4, Kutabu-d-d\u012bn 5, Balban Sh\u0101h 5, not known 2, Jal\u0101lu-d-d\u012bn 1; total 148.

It is not known how many coins were found, but thirty-two were recovered by the police from the finders; viz., 2 gold, and 30 silver coins. The two gold coins, and 15 of the silver coins, were at first forwarded to me by the Collector, but, on my request, the remainder (all silver) were sent for examination afterwards. Of the latter, I retained four coins on account of their numismatic value; on the other hand, I returned to the Collector one silver coin of the first-sent lot, as being of no numismatic value; I also returned to him eleven coins of the second lot. Altogether twelve coins were returned to the\nCollector, and twenty coins (viz., 2 gold and 18 silver,) were retained, to be dealt with under the Treasure-trove Act.\n\nOf these 20 coins, one gold coin is a Venetian ducat, of Aloys. Pisani, the remainder are coins of the following Moghul emperors of Dehli: Aurangzib, 'Alamgir Shani, Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n III, and Sh\u00e1h '\u00c1lam. The following is a detailed statement:\n\nI.

Police, Chanda, with his letters, dated 20th November 1888, 20th January 1889, 22nd January 1889, and 10th July 1889.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found in October 1888, in a field, in a village in the Bramapuri Tahsil, of the Chanda District, in the Central Provinces.\n\nThey are all of copper, and show on the obverse the figure of an elephant standing to the right, and carrying on his shoulders the figure of a mahaut; above him there is a legend, in ancient N\u00e1gar\u00ed characters, giving the name of the king that issued the coin. The reverse bears the well-known symbol of Ujain, i.e., four balls, or circles, joined by lines crosswise. They are coins of the Andhra, or Andhrabh\u1e5bitya\ndynasty, ruling on the south and north of the Narbada river. Their history and coinage is described by General Sir Alexander Cunningham, in his *Coins of Ancient India*, p. 102\u2013111. Mr. Thomas has also described their coins in the *Indian Antiquary*, Vol. VI, p. 276, and Vol. IX, p. 61. The exact period of their rule is still unsettled: Sir Alex. Cunningham places it from A. D., 78\u2013186. The coins of the present find belong to the following members of the dynasty: 1, Siri S\u00e1taka\u1e47i Gotam\u00edputra I, 78\u201399, A. D.; 2, Siri Pu\u1e0dum\u00e1vi V\u00e1sith\u00ed-putra (also called Pu\u1e0dumayi, or Pu\u1e0dumayi), 99\u2013127, A. D.; 3, Siriya\u00f1a S\u00e1taka\u1e47i Gotam\u00edputra II, 141\u2013170, A. D.\n\nThe following is a detailed statement of them:\n\nI. **Siri S\u00e1taka\u1e47i Gotam\u00ed-putra I.** The legend is *Siri S\u00e1taka\u1e47i*, or *S\u00e1taka\u1e47isa*; in the latter case, apparently, without *Siri* ... ...

Growse:\n\nThe Council regret to have to report the death on the 19th of last May of Mr. Frederick Salmon Growse C. I. E., M. A., at the age of 56, who was for thirty years a member of this Society. Mr. Growse was born in the year 1836 and was educated at Oriel and Queen's Colleges, Oxford, where he was a scholar of his College, and took the degree of M. A. He entered the Bengal Civil Service in 1860, was elected a member of this Society in the year 1861, and commenced contributing to the Journal and Proceedings some six years afterwards. His first paper, \"On the Transliteration of Indian Alphabets in the Roman Character,\" appeared in the Journal for the year 1867. For some years he principally devoted himself to assisting in the task then lately undertaken by the Society of producing a correct edition of the Prithiraj Ras\u0101l of Ch\u0101nd Bard\u0101f\u012b, his last paper on this subject appearing in the year 1878. In the course of his researches, he became involved in a controversy with Mr. John Beames, as to the principles on which a scientific edition and translation of the poem should be prepared. The arguments of both scholars will be found duly recorded in the Journal, but are now of little more than academical value, as it has since been ascertained that the poem is a modern forgery.\n\nIn the meantime the exigencies of the public service had taken Mr. Growse to Mathur\u0101, with which district his name is indissolubly connected. The Journal of the Society and the Indian Antiquary contain numerous papers on the holy land of Krishna-worshippers, full of most valuable information about the country and its people, their beliefs and religious customs. These papers were subsequently collected in one of his more important works, \"Mathur\u0101: a District Memoir.\" Mr. Growse was transferred to Bulandshahr in 1878, where he remained for some six years, being then transferred to Fatehpur where he finished his career of Indian service in the year 1891. On both of these districts he wrote admirable monographs, viz.\u2014\"Bulandshahr: or Sketches of an Indian District, Social, Historical, and Architectural,\" and \"A Supplement to the 'Fatehpur Gazetteer.'\"\nDuring his residence at Mathur\u00e1 Mr. Growse became an earnest student of Indian Architecture, and on his transfer to Bulandshahr he was enabled to put the lessons which he had learned into practice. He found Bulandshahr a mean little place, and left it in 1884, the most architectural modern town of its size in the North-Western Provinces. The improvements effected are recorded in a beautifully illustrated work published in 1886, entitled \"Indian Architecture of To-day, as exemplified in New Buildings in the Bulandshahr District.\"\n\nIn the year 1876, there appeared in the Journal of the Society from Mr. Growse's pen, an article entitled, \"The Prologue to the R\u0101m\u0101yana of Tulsi D\u0101s: a Specimen Translation.\" This was the first public intimation of the task to which Mr. Growse had lately applied himself\u2014the translation of the famous epic of the great poet of Oudh. It is on this translation that Mr. Growse's fame will rest in this country. It has made his name known wherever the worship of R\u0101ma prevails, and his translation, the first volume of which was issued in 1880, is eagerly sought for and bought by English-knowing natives throughout North-Western India. The work has been frequently re-printed, and the elegance of its style and the general accuracy which distinguishes it have been frequently publicly recognised by the best critics. To European students of the Hindi language the work has been invaluable, and it has materially assisted later labourers in their researches in the same field.\n\nWhen Mr. Growse retired from Government Service in 1891, his friends hoped that his newly-found leisure would enable him to continue those studies by which he had rendered his name conspicuous, and by which he had added lustre to the Society of which he was so long a member. In losing him, the world of Oriental literature has lost a fellow-labourer whose work, in its own peculiar sphere, was conscientious and thorough, and at the same time frequently graced by an eminently artistic style.\n\nThe Secretary read a circular from the Royal Society of New South Wales, enumerating prizes to be given for original researches on certain subjects connected with Australia. This can be seen in the Society's Office.\n\nThe Secretary stated that the Council proposed to discontinue the opening of the library between 7 to 9 A.M. The Assistant Librarian to attend the library from 10-30 A.M. to 5-30 P.M.\n\nMr. C. Little moved and Dr. A.W. Alcock seconded, that the question be postponed and that it be referred to the Council for reconsideration.\nThe Secretary read a circular from the Microscopical Society of Calcutta announcing the dates of their General Meetings to be, 10th July, 14th August and 11th September 1893.\n\nMr. L. de Nic\u00e9ville exhibited two boxes of butterflies collected by Mr. W. Doherty in New Guinea, also a pair of Pollinia of an Orchid removed from the eyes of one of the butterflies and mounted as a microscopic slide, and made some remarks on them:\n\n\"I pass round for the inspection of the members present this evening two boxes of butterflies collected in New Guinea by that intrepid traveller and naturalist, Mr. William Doherty, of Cincinnati, United States of America, who has devoted the last fifteen years of his life to collecting natural history objects in the East, more especially insects, and has in the course of his travels visited nearly every island in the Malay Archipelago, from Sumatra on the west to New Guinea on the east. The first box contains specimens from Humboldt's Bay, on the north of New Guinea at about the 141st E meridian; the second box specimens from Andai, N.-W. New Guinea. Comparatively few collections have been made on the north coast of this great island, so the specimens may perhaps be of interest to some of the members present.\n\nI also pass round a microscopic slide which contains two pollinia which I removed, one from the middle of the convex surface of each eye of one of the butterflies (Papilio pandion, Wallace) now exhibited from Andai. The butterfly is a male and must, one would think, have suffered considerable inconvenience from the presence of these pollinia attached to his eyes. As you will see, they are nearly half an inch in length (11 mms.), and consist of an oval disc by which they attach themselves firmly to any object which may touch them, the disc being covered with a viscid matter which dries in a very little while (Darwin says, in a few minutes); a lengthened straight stem called a caudicle; and the brush-like head which is composed of the pollen-grains proper. Considerable force was required to remove each pollinium, and from the fact of their being so firmly attached I very much doubt if any butterfly could unaided get rid of them. Each pollinium projected forwards from the eye in a line with the axis of the body of the insect, the two pollinia being placed symmetrically. I shewed the slide to Dr. David Prain of the Royal Botanic Garden, Shibpur, but all he could tell me about it is that the pollinia belonged to some Orchid, but he would not even guess as to the genus of the plant. A vast mass of most interesting information on the subject generally will be found in Mr. Charles Darwin's work, \"The various Contrivances by which Orchids are Fertilised by Insects,\" to which book\nDuring his residence at Mathur\u00e1 Mr. Growse became an earnest student of Indian Architecture, and on his transfer to Bulandshahr he was enabled to put the lessons which he had learned into practice.

I may add, in conclusion, that I have probably set out with my own hands 30,000 or 40,000 butterflies, but this New Guinea Papilio is the only one that I have found with the pollinia of an Orchid attached to it.\"\n\nThe following papers were read:\u2014\n\n1.

In March 1849, while holding this appointment, he was appointed a Deputy Magistrate in the 24-Pergannahs on a salary of Rs. 200 per mensem. Four years later he was promoted to a higher grade and placed in charge of the Sub-division of Kalaroa in the same district. The following year he was transferred to the Sub-division of Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d. Here he remained for about five years, and his administration was so successful that he was officially thanked by the Magistrate, while the leading Zamind\u00e1rs of the place presented him with a farewell address, expressing their satisfaction at his administration of the Sub-division and regret at his transfer from it. From Jah\u00e1n\u00e1b\u00e1d, he was transferred to Alipore in the 24-Pergannahs, and in 1867, the newly-created Suburban Police Court of that place was placed under his charge. After ten years of such incumbency, he was appointed to officiate as Presidency Magistrate in Calcutta. In October 1877, he was appointed to the Suburban Police Court at Sealdah and continued in this charge till the 31st December 1884, on which date he retired from the service of Government to enjoy the pension which he had so well earned.\n\n\"In 1863 Abdul Latif was appointed a Fellow of the Calcutta University. In 1877 he was created a Kh\u00e1n Bah\u00e1dur, three years later a Naw\u00e1b, and on the 1st January 1883 was decorated with the insignia of the Companionship of the Order of the Indian Empire. There has not been a single national or patriotic movement during the last thirty years in which Naw\u00e1b Abdul Lat\u00edf had not taken a prominent part. But it is as the pioneer of English education amongst the Muhammadans of these Provinces that the late Naw\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur will be best remembered by posterity. At a time when the Muhammadan gentry of Bengal had obstinately set their faces against English education, and Muhammadan...\"\nbigotry was supreme, it was Abdul Latif who alone had the courage and the foresight to come forward and hold aloft\u2014often in the face of bitter opposition\u2014the standard of English education, and he was thus the pioneer of a movement which has already brought much benefit to his hitherto benighted community, and promises to do still more good for them.\n\n\"As a man, the late Naw\u00e1b Bah\u00e1dur possessed many social and other qualities which made him the respected centre of a large number of friends.\"\n\nThe Philological Secretary (Numismatic) read reports on the following finds of Treasure Trove Coins:\n\n(I) Report on an old silver coin forwarded by the Deputy Commissioner of Gujranw\u00e1la, with his No. 327, dated the 5th June 1893.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner reports that 449 coins were found, of which only the one specimen forwarded for examination has been recovered from the finder. All the remainder have been disposed of by the finder for Rs. 440, for which a fine of Rs. 500 was inflicted on him. The time and place of finding are not specified in the Deputy Commissioner's report.\n\nThe single coin, forwarded, is a rupee of the Moghul Emperor, Ahmad Sh\u00e1h Bah\u00e1dur, of the mint D\u00e1ru-s-S\u00e1l\u1e6dan\u00e1t Ldhor (mutilated.) The date is lost, the regnal year is 3. An indifferent specimen.\n\n(II) Report on 115 old silver coins, forwarded by the Collector of Champaran, with his No. 233G, dated the 22 May 1893.\n\nThe Collector in his letter to the Commissioner of the Patna Division, No. 137G, dated the 26th April 1893, states that on the 12th March 1893, two boys of Tolah Dih, Soogaon Pergana, while digging, found a Kattia, containing some 500 or 600 Rupees. Of these only 115 were eventually recovered by the Collector and transmitted to the Asiatic Society of Bengal for examination.\n\nThe descriptive list of the coins in the Collector's letter to the Commissioner is altogether incorrect. The following is a correct list of them. There are, coins of Akbar, 23; of Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, 61; of Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n, 31. Total: 115.\n\nThe following is a detailed description of them:\n\n(1) Akbar, 963\u20131014 A. H. = 1556\u20131605 A. D.\n\n(a) Type: round, jaljal\u00e1d, months of Ilahi years;\nmints: Ahmad\u00e1b\u00e1d8, L\u00e1hor6, K\u00e1b\u00fal4,\nJah\u00e1ng\u00edrnagar1 (?) ; dates 401, 411, 421,\n431, 442, 461, 472, 491, others mutilated,\ntotal ... ... ... ... 19\n(b) Type: square, *jaljal\u00e1*, month Azr, date 32...\n(c) Type: square, Kalimah; date 999, mint?; and date *alif* (=1000), mint *Urd\u00fa Zafar qar\u00edn*...\n(d) Type: round, Kalimah, areas as in Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 108...\n\n(2) *Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr*, 1014\u20131087 A.H. = 1605\u20131627 A.D.\n\n(a) Type: round, lettered surfaces, months of Ilah\u00ed years; like Brit. Mus. Cat. Nos. 444, 467. Months: Farward\u00edn, Ardibihist, Kh\u00fard\u00e1d, T\u00edr, Amard\u00e1d, Shar\u00edwar, Mihr, Ab\u00e1n, Az\u00e1r, Z\u00e1\u00ed, Bahman, Isfand\u00e1rmiz.

Cat., Nos. 447, 455; months of Ilah\u00ed years: Kh\u00fard\u00e1d, Az\u00e1r, Bahman, Isfand\u00e1rmiz; all Mint L\u00e1hor...\n\n(c) Type: round, lettered surfaces...\n\n(3) *Sh\u00e1h Jah\u00e1n* 1037\u20131068 A.H. = 1627\u20131658 A.D.\n\n(a) Type: round, square areas, linear. In one specimen the area is double-lined...\n\n(b) Type: round, lettered surfaces...\n\nGrand total... 115\n\n(III) Report on 14 old silver coins forwarded by the Offg. Collector of Jessore, with his No. G 618, dated the 19th June 1893.\n\nIn his report to the Commissioner of the Presidency Division, No. G 618, dated the 19th June 1893, the Collector states, that the coins were found in Narail on the 7th April 1893, by a person while cutting the plinth of a dilapidated building. It appears that 60 coins were found, of which, however, only 14 have been recovered from the finder.\n\nThe identification of these 14 coins, given by the Collector in his letter to the Commissioner on the authority, I presume, of some Court Mohurir, is entirely wrong. They are said to be coins of a \"Sultan Abu Mazaf\u00e9r (King of Bagdad in Asiatic Turkey)\" and to be dated in \"681 Hijra.\" In reality, they are the coins of some of the so-called \"Independent Sult\u00e1ns of Bengal;\" viz., Sikandar Sh\u00e1h, bin Ily\u00e1s (1358-89), Gh\u00edy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn '\u00c1zam Sh\u00e1h (1389-1396), Saifu-d-d\u00edn Hamzah Sh\u00e1h (1396-1406), Shih\u00e1b-u-d-d\u00edn B\u00e1yaz\u00edd Sh\u00e1h (1409-1414),\nand Jal\u00e1lu-d-d\u00edn Muhammad Sh\u00e1h (1414\u20131431 A.D.) Accordingly they cover a period of about 42 years. (From 1389 to 1431 A.D.)\n\nThe following is a detailed description:\n\n(1) SIKANDAR SH\u00c1H BIN ILY\u00c1S\n\n(a) One coin, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 37, mint Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d, date lost ... 1\n(b) One coin, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 32, mint and date illegible, much cut by shroff-marks ... ... 1\n(c) One coin, like Brit. Mus.

No. 5; mint Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d, date 794 ... 1 3\n\n(3) SAIFU-D-D\u00cdN HAMZAH SH\u00c1H,\n\nTwo coins, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 65; mint Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d, date of one 814, other lost. 2 2\n\n(4) SHIH\u00c1BU-D-D\u00cdN B\u00c1Y\u00c1Z\u00cdD SH\u00c1H\n\n(a) Two coins, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 67, mints and dates lost ... ... 2\n(b) Two coins, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 68, mints lost, date 816 ... ... 1\n(c) One coin, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 71 ... 1 4\n\n(5) JAL\u00c1LU-D-D\u00cdN MU\u1e24AMMAD SH\u00c1H\n\n(a) One coin, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 77, mint lost, date 834 ... ... 1\n(b) One coin, like Brit. Mus. Cat., No. 72, mint Fir\u00faz\u00e1b\u00e1d, date illegible ... 1 2\n\nTotal ... 14\n\n(IV) Report on three gold coins, forwarded by the Political Agent, Chhattisgarh Feudatory States, Rajpur, with his No. 4562, no date, 1893.\n\nThe three coins are stated to have been found in the bed of the river Ang, in the Feudatory State of Patna.\n\nOne of the coins is of pure gold; the other two are of a mixed metal, with a large proportion of gold. They are of two different sizes; two are \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) inch, and one \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch in diameter.\nAll three coins belong to precisely the same class as those reported on by me about three months ago (see Proceedings for April 1893, p. 92). The latter were 56 in number, and had also been found in one of the Feudatory States, Sarangarh. The coins of the present find belong to J\u00e1jalla Deva, of the Kalachuri dynasty of Chedi, who is said to have reigned from about 1090\u20131120 A.D.\n\nThe figure on the reverse which I described in my previous report as that of Hanum\u00e1n, is more probably that of a recumbent bull, turned to the right. The legend on the obverse is S'ri Maj-J\u00e1jalla Deva. On the reverse, in front of the recumbent bull, there is found the syllable m\u00e1 or ma.\n\n(V) Report on 28 old Silver Coins forwarded by the Offg. Collector of Bhagalpur, with his No. 810G, dated 9th July 1892, No. 1036G, dated 10th August 1892, and No. 1359G, no date.\n\nThese coins are said to have been found by two boys in a hole enclosed in an earthen pot, in Mauza Kotia, Pergana Shophar, Thana Pratalganj, Subdivision Supaul of the Bhagalpur District.\n\nThey are rupees of the following independent Sult\u00e1ns of Bengal: Sikandar Sh\u00e1h (2 specimens), Ghiy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn 'Azam Sh\u00e1h (2), Saifu-d-d\u00edn Hamzah Sh\u00e1h (1), Jal\u00e1lu-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h (10) and N\u00e1siru-d-d\u00edn Ma\u1e25m\u00fad Sh\u00e1h I (13), covering a period of about 75 years, or from 1357 to 1430 A.D.\n\nThe following is a detailed Statement:\n\n1. **Sikandar Sh\u00e1h, bin Ily\u00e1s**, 759\u2013792 A.H. = 1357\u20131389 A.D.\n   Type as in Brit.

Report on 44 old silver coins forwarded by the Extra Asst. Commissioner, Sibsagar, with his No. 3754, dated 5th December 1891.\n\nThe coins are stated to have been found in the possession of a man on the Numogarh Tea Estate, but no information is given as to the circumstances under which they were found by him, or came into his possession.\n\nThey are of four different descriptions: One belongs to the Imperial Delhi issue of 'Al\u00e1u-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h (1295-1315 A.D.); another to one of the early Dependent Governors of Bengal, Ghiy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn Bah\u00e1dur Sh\u00e1h (1310-1330 A.D.); 38 to some of the so-called \"Independent Sult\u00e1ns of Bengal,\" (viz., Ghiy\u00e1su-d-d\u00edn 'Az\u00e1m Sh\u00e1h 1389-1396, Shih\u00e1bu-d-d\u00edn B\u00e1y\u00e1z\u00edd Sh\u00e1h, 1409-1414, Jal\u00e1lu-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h, 1414-1431, N\u00e1s\u00edra-d-d\u00edn Mahm\u00fad Sh\u00e1h, 1442-1459, Ruknu-d-d\u00edn B\u00e1rbak Sh\u00e1h, 1459-1474, Shamsu-d-d\u00edn Y\u00fasuf Sh\u00e1h, 1474-1481, Jal\u00e1lud-d\u00edn Fath Sh\u00e1h, 1481-1486, Saifu-d-d\u00edn Fir\u00faz Sh\u00e1h, 1486-1489, Shamsu-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e93affar Sh\u00e1h, 1490-1493, 'Al\u00e1u-d-d\u00edn \u1e24usain Sh\u00e1h, 1493-1518 A.D.), and 4 Hind\u00fa coins. So far as ascertainable, the coins of the find cover a period of nearly two centuries and a quarter. (From 1295 to 1518 A.D.) Regarding the items of the find, there is a curious resemblance between it and another from K\u00e1mr\u00e1p, a report on which is printed in the Proceedings of the Society, for April 1893.\n\nThe following is a detailed statement:\n\n(A) Imperial Delhi issue:\n\n(1) 'Al\u00e1u-d-d\u00edn Mu\u1e25ammad Sh\u00e1h\u2014\n\nA coin, like Brit.

The only two hitherto published (so far as I am aware) being those referred to by Blochmann (J. A. S. B., 1875, p. 306).\n\n\"Babu Madhab Chunder Bardaloi, E. A. C. at Barpeta, has just sent me eight coins which I enclose. Four of these are of the Koch dynasty and one of Jaintia.\n\n\"I have written asking him if the persons from whom he got them are willing to let me keep them, and if so, I shall be happy to give them to the Society. In any case, their examination will doubtless be of interest.\n\n\"In the course of next cold weather, I hope to add considerably to the number of coins now sent.\"\n\nDr. Hoernle said that of the coins forwarded by Mr. Gait, four were of Kuch Behar, one of Jayantipur, one of Assam, and two of Nepal. They were as follows:\n\n1. Kuch Behar; a large coin of Lakshm\u00ed N\u00e1r\u00e1ya\u00f1a, dated 1669, like No. MCCIII, in Marsden's Numismata Orientalia.\n\n2.

It contained lists and genealogies of the Mohammadan Empire (including India), from the first Caliphs to the Khedives and Amirs of Afgh\u00e1nist\u00e1n, together with historical introductions explaining their relative positions, &c., and geographical boundaries.\n\nThe Chairman announced that the Council had elected Mr. C. Little to officiate as Treasurer in the place of Dr. W. King.\n\nThe Secretary reported that B\u00e1bu Sambhu Nath Sukul had not paid his admission fee, and in accordance with Rule 9 of the Society's Bye-laws his election as a Member of the Society was cancelled.\n\nOn the motion of the Chairman, it was resolved by the meeting to purchase, at the cost of Rs. 200, three very old and important copper-plate grants in the well-known Gupta characters, which had been dug out near Faridpur in Eastern Bengal. They will form a valuable addition to the Society's collection of copper-plates.\n\nDr. Hoernle exhibited two curious dies which he had received from Mr. Ibbetson, the Deputy Commissioner of Jullundur. They had been found in the house of a man of that district together with a large number of so-called \"coins\" made in a cheap white alloy. Dr. Hoernle explained that these objects were not coins, but might be medals, though the occasion or object for which they were made was not known at present. They appeared to belong to the same class as the so-called and well-known Ramtinkis. The latter were made of gold, and were medals struck for ceremonial purposes. Silver medals of this kind were never known to exist, till three years ago, when one was presented to the Society by R\u00e1j\u00e1 Siva Pras\u00e1d of Benares. That specimen looked like a cast taken from some gold original. Silver medals struck from dies first appeared two years ago, since when they have been brought\nnumerously on the market, and can be obtained at most of the large towns in North India. In the Calcutta bazar they can be got for about Re. 1-8 each. The specimens obtainable here, however, seem to be made of real silver (Rupee-silver). They are occasionally palmed off on inexperienced coin-collectors as \"coins\" at extravagant prices. There are several varieties of them current. Dr. Hoernle himself had met with four varieties in Calcutta. The dies sent from Jullundur showed a fifth variety; and probably new varieties or new combinations of old varieties, were constantly made, as the demand for them increased. The general type of these silver medals showed figures of R\u00e1m and S\u00edt\u00e1 with attendants on both sides, with a legend in a species of rude modern N\u00e1gari round the margin. The four varieties, obtained in Calcutta were as follows: No. 1, obverse: R\u00e1m and S\u00edt\u00e1, seated on a throne under an umbrella, legend S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1ma five times repeated; reverse: R\u00e1ma and Hanum\u00e1n standing face to face, legend Hanum\u00e1n, six times repeated.\n\nNo. 2. Obverse: R\u00e1m, Lakshman and S\u00edt\u00e1, seated on a throne, and Hanum\u00e1n standing before them, holding an umbrella over them; legend: S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1ma five times repeated. Reverse: same as on No. 1.\n\nNo. 3. Obverse: same as on No. 2. Reverse: R\u00e1m and Lakshman standing in file, beside one another; legend S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1ma (again) five times repeated.\n\nNo. 4. Obverse: Horseman followed by a groom on foot, and a dog; legend: R\u00e1ja [Vika]ramajit, three times repeated. Reverse: A man standing, feeding two peacocks out of a vessel, and a bull sitting; legend: as on obverse.\n\nThe Jullundur medal shows on the obverse: R\u00e1m and S\u00edt\u00e1 seated on a throne; Hanum\u00e1n standing in front in respectful attitude; Lakshman standing behind, holding umbrella over throne; legend: S\u00edt\u00e1 R\u00e1ma, three times repeated. Reverse: like reverse of No. 3, but legend: R\u00e1ma n\u00e1ma, four times repeated.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. On the relationship between Tibetan Orthography and the Original Pronunciation of the Language.\u2014By The Rev. F. B. Shawe, Moravian Missionary in Ladak.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nIt is well-known that the orthography and the pronunciation of the Tibetan language are widely discrepant, so much so that it has been doubted whether \"the Tibetans ever pronounced their words as they wrote them.\" The author produces facts and reasons to show that the\ndoubt is not well founded, but that, on the contrary, there is much probability that at the time the Tibetan alphabet was \"invented,\" in the 7th century A.D., the actual pronunciation of the language corresponded to the orthography. The evidence for this is mainly summarised from J\u00e6schke's Essays on the subject, supplemented by observations made by Mr. Shawe himself. The evidence from the literary language is summed up thus: \"Whilst many identically pronounced words are spelled identically, many more are spelled in a more or less widely differing manner in accordance with the differing signification; and whilst certain rules of language cause a modification in pronouncing certain syllables, the identical rule prevents the modification from taking place in writing.\" But the most striking evidence is afforded by the dialects. In these, not unfrequently, consonants which are mute in the ordinary (literary) pronunciation are distinctly sounded. This practice is most marked in the most westerly provinces of Purig and Balti, that is, in those provinces which are most widely distant from the seat of Buddhistic and literary culture. Thus in Purig, people pronounce sgrom \"a box,\" gri \"a knife,\" etc., just as written \u0f42\u0f7c\u0f58\u0f0b and \u0f42\u0fb2\u0f72\u0f0b, which in the ordinary Tibetan are pronounced dom, di. This practice can only be a survival of a former universal mode of pronunciation.\n\nThis paper will be published in Part I of the Journal.\n\n2. The Koch Kings of Kamrup. By E. A. Gait, Esq., C.S.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author first enumerates the extant accounts of the Koch dynasty. The best of these is a Manuscript history in Sanskrit, called the Vamsaval\u00ed, or Purushan\u00e1ma, and written about 1806 A.D., by a certain S\u00farya Hari Ganak. It is now in the possession of R\u00e1j\u00e1 Lakshm\u00ed Nar\u00e1yan Kuar, the leading representative of the Darrang branch of the Koch family. An abstract of it is given, supplemented by information derived from inscriptions and other sources. The early history of K\u00e1mar\u00fapa is, as usual, semi-mythical. The earliest kings are said to have been Mahirang D\u00e1nab, Gha\u1e6dak Kir\u00e1t, Narak Asur and Bhogadatta, and others of the latter's line. The 19th in it was Sub\u00e1lhu, who resigned in favour of his son Sapar\u1e47a, who was killed by his ministers. After this, three kings are mentioned, Jit\u00e1ri, Arimat, and Jong\u00e1l Balahu. Four other kings are also mentioned as having reigned for 300 years at Lohityapur, viz., Mimang, Gajang, Sribang and Mrigang. The earliest authentic accounts commence with Hiuen Tsiang who visited K\u00e1mar\u00fapa about 640 A.D., at which time a Hind\u00fa\nor Hinduised prince, Kum\u00e1r Bh\u00e1skara Varman, was on the throne. Later it appears that the country belonged to the dominions of the well-known P\u00e1la kings. Seventeen princes of this name are mentioned, but some of them may not have belonged to the P\u00e1la dynasty. Later on we come on more certain ground with the Khyen dynasty, the founder of which was Niladhvaj. He was succeeded by his son Chakradhaj and his grandson Nilambar. In the latter's reign, his capital Kamatapur was captured by Hussain Sh\u00e1h of Bengal, in 1498 A.D. Some other Muhammadan invasions, earlier as well as later, are here noticed. In the meantime the Koch chiefs were gradually rising to power. Their founder is one Haria Mandal, to whom a mythological Kashatriya origin is assigned. He had two sons, Sib Singh and Biswa Singh, who defeating all the Bhuiyas, built a magnificent city in Kuch Behar. In their days, Rangalug\u00e1\u00f1 was the eastern boundary. Biswa Singh was succeeded by the two brothers, Malla Deo and Sukladhaj, who are known by the names of Nar Nar\u00e1yan and Silar\u00e1\u00ed. Nar Nar\u00e1yan fought many successful wars, and it was he who greatly extended and consolidated the kingdom. He divided finally his kingdom in two parts. The portion west of the river Sankosh was given to Lakshmi, the son of Nar Nar\u00e1yan, while the country to the east of that river, with the capital at Barnagar, was allotted to Raghu, the son of Silar\u00e1\u00ed. The latter was succeeded by his son Parikhit, who quarrelled with Lakshmi and annexed his dominions. Lakshmi appealed to the Mogul emperor Jah\u00e1ng\u00edr, who sent a force to reinstate him. Parikhit was defeated and died soon afterwards in 1614 A.D. But a brother of his, Bali Nar\u00e1yan, succeeded, for a time, in recovering his kingdom from the Muhammadans, with the help of the Ahom King, Svarga Nar\u00e1yan. He reigned till 1637 A.D. So far the history of the Koch family is related in the Vams\u00e1val\u00ed. The subsequent history may be found in Hunter's Statistical Account of Koch Behar, supplemented by the statements on the Fathiyah i Ibriyah, published by Blochmann in the Journal of this Society for 1872.\n\nThis paper will be published in Part I of the Journal.\n\n3. Origin of the Baluch.\u2014By Colonel M\u00f6ckler. Submitted through Colonel T. H. Haldich.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper is mainly concerned with the Rind, one of the tribes or clans inhabiting Balochistan. Their name signifies \"a turbulent, reckless, daring man.\" They have never acknowledged the authority of any ruler in the country. They claim to be the true Bal\u00f4ch, and assert that\nthey originally came from \"Alaf,\" which is supposed, by themselves and most other people, to be Haleb or Aleppo, in Syria. They say that they are Arabs of the tribe of Koreish, and were driven out from Alaf by Yezeed I, for assisting Husain, the martyr nephew of the Prophet Muhammad, in 61 Hijrah. The author shows, however, from some Arab authorities that the Baloch were established in Makran more than a century before the commencement of the Muhammadan era, certainly so, if, as Firdusi relates, Nowshirwan punished them in Makran in 550 A.D.,\u2014and still more certainly that they were located there within 22 years after its commencement,\u2014and that therefore, if the Rinds left Aleppo in the time of Yezeed I, about 61 H., the Baloch were in Makran before that date. But it is doubtful whether the Rinds ever came from Aleppo or that they are Baloch at all. It is much more probable that they are the descendants of a certain al Harith al 'Alafi, that is, of Harith of the 'Alafi tribe and of the Kahtanic stock of Arabs. He was the father of two men, who, according to Tabari, in a blood-feud killed an officer who had been appointed by Al Hajjaj, the governor of Irak, to the charge of Makran, in 65 H. They had come from 'Umran, and after the murder took possession of Makran. Subsequently, about 86 H. they retired before a punitive force of Al Hajjaj into Sindh, where their name is conspicuous in the annals of the country for the next 200 years or so. This, and other facts, show that the Rinds really are of Arab descent, but that they did not come from Aleppo, but are descended from a man of the Alafi tribe who came from 'Umran; and that they are not of the Koreish, but the Kahtan stock. On account of their undoubted Arab descent, the Rinds are held in very high respect by the other clans of Balochistan who, therefore, all claim to be related to them, through one Jalal Khan, an ancestor of the Rinds. Among the sons of this Jalal, Makran is said to have been divided after the death of Al Hajjaj. With regard to the name Baloch, Col. Moeckler suggests its identity with the Gedrosii of the Greeks. He says that the Baloch themselves explain their name by the phrase \"Baloch Badroch\" (or Badrosh). Here bad means 'evil,' and roch or rosh means 'day.' In Pahlavi or Zend gad is synonymous with bad; therefore Badrosh=gadr\u00f4sh or gadros, whence the Greek Gedrosii. By the interchange of the liquids r and l, badroch would become badloch, out of which the d must naturally drop, leaving the Baloch=the Gedrosii. Or, on the other hand, the proverbial expression Baloch-Badr\u00f4ch may have been current in the time of the Greeks in the form Baloch-Gadr\u00f4sh, and the Greeks confused the epithet with the name. The latter would then be derived from Belus king of Babylon, a derivation which is adopted by Prof. Rawlinson.\n\nThis paper will be published in Part I of the Journal.\n4. Note on the Official Reckoning of the reigns of the later Mogul Emperors, and on some of their Mint-towns.\u2014By W. Irvine, Esq., C.S., (retired).\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThe author begins by showing that all the information of European and Native Indian historians regarding the initial date of Aurangzib's reign is ultimately traceable to the 'Alamgirn\u00e1mah of Muhammad Q\u00e1zim. This writer states that in the time of the real enthronement of Aurangzib, with full ceremonials, on the 24th Ramaz\u00e1n 1069 (=15th June 1659), it was decided to antedate the commencement of his reign from the 1st of Ramaz\u00e1n 1068, when he made the first attempt to assume the imperial power. Mr. Irvine says that for chronological purposes it is best to accept the officially fixed date, though it may be a fictitious one. He then shows from certain coins in the British Museum which are dated 1118 Hijrah, and the 51st year regnal, that they only agree with the official reckoning; for Aurangzib, as generally admitted, died in 1118, after a reign of 50 years (lunar), 2 months and 27 days.\n\nSome further remarks, then, follow on the official initial date of the reigns of some of Aurangzib's successors. The author concludes with some notes on the identity of the mint-towns 'Alamg\u00edrpur, Mu'azzam\u00e1b\u00e1d, Naqrat\u00e1b\u00e1d, Sh\u00e1h\u00e1b\u00e1d Qans\u00faj, and Zafar\u00e1b\u00e1d.\n\nDr. Hoernle remarked that he agreed with Mr. Irvine that the officially fixed date of Aurangzib's reign must be accepted. He pointed out, however, that there were certain coins, dated in 1070 H. and the 1st year (ahad) regnal, which did not accord with the official reckoning, and suggested a solution of the difficulty.\n\nThe paper, with Dr. Hoernle's note, will be published in Part I of the Journal.\n\n5.

W. Oliver, Esq.\n\nThe President announced that Mr. G. A. Grierson had returned from leave and had taken charge of the Philological Secretaryship from Dr. A. F. R. Hoernle.\nThe Philological Secretary exhibited a number of rubbings of inscriptions lately found by Captain Deane near Peshawar. Some of them appear to be in a hitherto unidentified alphabet.\n\nThe original stones have been sent by the finder to M. Senart for decipherment.\n\nMr. de Niceville exhibited a single male specimen of a very rare butterfly, Charaxes kadenii, Felder, captured in Sumatra. He received it from Hofrath Dr. L. Martin, of Deli, Sumatra, who possesses two other specimens caught also in the Battak Mountains, in the north-east of the island. It was described by Dr. Felder in the Wien. Ent. Monatsch. for 1861, from a specimen caught in Eastern Java by Dr. A. R. Wallace, and is roughly figured. A second and better woodcut of this unique example is given in Wallace's \"Malay Archipelago,\" where he calls it the \"Calliper Butterfly,\" from the peculiarity of the pair of tails present on each hindwing which converge at the tips, this being a feature unknown to a like extent in any other species in the genus.\n\nThe following papers were read:\n\n1. A translation of the Inscription on the Chinese Stone lately dug out of St. John's Churchyard.\u2014By the Rev. H. B. Hyde, M.A.\n   The paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n2. The Philological Secretary read a paper by Mr. H. Beveridge, I.C.S. (Retd.), on The Site of Kar\u1e47a Suvar\u1e47a.\n\nThe Chinese Pilgrim Hiuen Tsiang visited a town in Bengal which he calls Kie-lo-no-su-fa-la-na, that is, being transliterated, Kar\u1e47a-suvar\u1e47a. The site has not hitherto been satisfactorily identified, and has been conjecturally located in B\u012brbh\u016bm, in Singhbh\u016bm, and quite recently by Dr. Waddell, in Burdwan. Mr. Beveridge's object is to prove that the place is probably identical with the town of R\u0101\u1e45g\u0101mat\u012b in the Murshidabad district.\n\nWe have two accounts of Hiuen Tsiang's travels,\u2014that given by the Pilgrim himself, and that given in his 'Life' by the Shaman Yen Tsung. After dealing with discrepancies between these two accounts, Mr. Beveridge comes to the conclusion that the latter, in this case, is the more trustworthy of the two, and that it naturally takes the Pilgrim's itinerary through R\u0101\u1e45g\u0101mat\u012b.\n\nThe Pilgrim describes the kingdom of Kar\u1e47a-suvar\u1e47a as having a circumference of about 900 miles and the capital as being about four miles round. The inhabitants were well off and had literary tastes, but they were a mixture of true believers (Buddhists), and heretics. By the side of the capital there was the monastery called Lo-to-wei-chi\n(the name of which has been restored to Rakta-viti, (? Raktamrittika) or Redlands, of which the word R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101\u1e6di is a literal translation. It is well known that R\u0101ng\u0101m\u0101\u1e6di (which is situated on the Bh\u0101girathi river about six miles above Berhampur), was once a great city. According to Lassen, it was formerly known as Karna-suvar\u1e47a-ga\u1e47a, and is said to have been so called because Vibhisana, the brother of R\u0101vana, the demon king of Ceylon, visited the place on the occasion of the king's son's first meal of rice, and caused a shower of gold to fall on the land. Hiuen Tsiang gives a curious legend regarding the introduction of Buddhism into the kingdom.\n\nShortly before Hiuen Tsiang's time, the king of Karna-suvar\u1e47a was the well-known S\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ka, who was so strongly opposed to Buddhism that he cut down the sacred Bodhi tree at Bodh Gay\u0101. He died about the year 613 A.D., after having been overcome by \u015a\u012bl\u0101ditya of Kannanju, in revenge for the murder of his brother and predecessor, R\u0101javardhana. This king favoured Buddhism, and it was during his reign that the pilgrim visited the locality.\n\nMr. Beveridge gives strong reasons for believing that this S\u0101s\u0101\u1e45ka was the same as S\u0101s\u0101dhara of Ab\u016b'l Fazl, who was the immediate successor of \u0100di\u015b\u016bra who brought Br\u0101hmans from Kannauj to Bengal. This identification is most important, as it fixes \u0100di\u015b\u016bra as reigning in the early part of the 6th century A.D.\n\nFinally there is a local tradition that Karna-suvar\u1e47a was destroyed by an expedition from Ceylon, an event which Mr. Beveridge places as probably occurring about the 12th century A.D. It was the original home of the family of R\u0101ja R\u0101dh\u0101 K\u0101nta Deva, the author of the \u015aabda-kalpa-druma, whose ancestor \u015ar\u012b-hari-deva possibly lived there before its destruction by the Singhalese invaders.\n\n3. A Bijapur Inscription.\u2014By Professor F. Kielhorn, C.I.E., G\u00f6ttingen. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\nThe paper will be published in the Journal, Part I.\n\n4. Notes on early local silver coinages in Northern India and in the Konkan.\u2014By W. Theobald, M.N.S. and R.A.S., London. Communicated by the Philological Secretary.\n\n(Abstract.)\n\nThis paper is principally devoted to a minute description of eighteen silver coins which had been presented to the author by the late General Sir A. Cunningham. They formed part of the articles recovered from the wreck of the steamer in which the archaeological treasures of the General had been lost beneath the waters of the Bay of Bengal. These\nsilver coins belong to a type of great antiquity and intermediate in character between the well-known \"punch-marked\" coins and those of a later date impressed by a single \"die.\" They are square or polygonal or even rounded, and weigh on the average 26 grains. Some of them are quite blank on the reverse side, but mostly they are impressed with a varying number of symbols on both sides. The device on the obverse of eleven is made up of two principal symbols, and four or five smaller or accessory ones. Of the former, one is said to resemble a ninepin, placed horizontally. What this symbol is intended to represent, the author says he has not the faintest idea, but he suggests that it may represent a \"dug-out\" or fishing canoe. The other clearly represents some quadruped, which, to judge from its head and tail, the author thinks must be a horse. Here the author incidentally corrects an error in one of his previous papers regarding the so-called \"Coins of Kuninda.\" The animal represented on these coins is neither a \"deer\" nor a \"yak,\" but a \"buffalo.\" Two square coins, with blank reverses, entirely differ in their symbols from the rest. They are principally marked by a very obscure object, which the author suggests may possibly be intended for \"a human hand lightly grasping a human ear,\" as shown on a gem from Khorasan. The concluding portion of the paper refers to certain ancient coins from the Konkan, described by Sir Walter Elliot in the Numismata Orientalia, and corrects some errors in that description. The author shows that these coins bear no \"punch-marks,\" but are struck from a die, the principal devise on which is the figure of a humped bull, surrounded by a number of minor symbols.\n\nThis paper will be published in Part I. of the Journal.\n\n5. The Philological Secretary read a paper by Mr. W. Irvine, B.C.S. (Retd.), on an early translation into Hindustani of the Acts of the Apostles. The paper was as follows:\n\nReading Mr. Grierson's interesting paper \"On the early Study of Indian Vernaculars in Europe\" (Journal, Vol. LXII, Part I, pp. 41-52), has called to mind a little book, which I bought from a second-hand bookseller about a year ago. As Mr. Grierson does not mention it, although it seems to fall within the scope of his paper, it may be of interest to give a short description of this work. It is in 12 mo., $6\\frac{1}{2}$ inches x 4 inches, pp. 192, bound in full calf, with gilt edges. On the back are the letters\n\nG.\n\nN. J.\n\nand on the side are stamped the words\n\nA D\nC. R. ACADEMIAM\nLING: ORIENT:\n1755.\n\nOn the inside of the guard and fly-leaves are various press marks in pencil: also, on the fly leaf at the end (as we should deem it), is written in ink, facing the vernacular title page,\n\nActa Apostolorum\nin lingua Indostanicam\ntranslate\na Benj. Schulsio\neditit\nD, Jo. Henr. Callenbergius.\ndo lo cxxxviii.\n\nOn the other side of the same leaf are the words, in pencil, Ling. indostanica, and on the inside of the guard, at the bottom, Novum Testamentum; 1758 (should be 1748?) Hindustanice. There is no imprint of any press, European or Native, and no title-page in any European language. As a substitute is a vernacular title-page in Persian character (printed from a wood block, I think), the letters of which are so twisted and distorted that it is difficult to decipher them. All that I can read for certain is Hak\u00edkat k\u00e1 kit\u00e1b. As the pages are headed Hak\u00edkat, this must be the rendering of the word Acts. The book is in the Persian character and has been printed from type, somewhat similar in look to that still in use in Calcutta.\n\nThe language seems to be some form of dialect, possibly Dakhni. It is a very provincial jargon, as little like the Urd\u00fa of Dihl\u00ed or Lakhn\u00e1\u00fa as Chancer thought \u201cFrench of Stratford-atte-Bowe\u201d was to that of Paris. It begins\n\nAvval F\u00e1ziil.\n\n1.

Allahke mal\u00fakon z\u00e1har karko man\u00e1 n\u00e1 hoko s\u00e1ri himat son bh\u00ed kh\u00e1wand heso Ish\u00ed\u2019\u00e1 Mashi\u2019\u00e1ke l\u00e1ik heso mazk\u00far\u00e1n ta\u2019l\u00edm dete ihe.\n\n5a. THE PHILOLOGICAL SECRETARY adds the following note:\n\nSchnitz, the translator of the work mentioned by Mr. Irvine, has been already mentioned in my Essay above referred to. He corresponded with Bayer on the subject of the L\u00e1ntsha alphabet. In the year 1745, or four years before he published his translation of the Acts, he published the first grammar of the Hind\u00fast\u00e1n\u00ed language. In 1748 the Sprachmeister, which owes much to his assistance, was\nissued. He was a Madras Missionary, which fully accounts for the impure Hindustani used by him. His work must, I think, rank as the earliest known translation of any portion of the Bible into an Indo-Aryan vernacular.\n\nCallenberg's name occurs in LaCroze's Thesaurus Epistolicus. In the years 1724 and 1726 he was living at Halle, and corresponded with LaCroze, about Mongolian and the language of Greenland, of which a specimen is printed.* He was a friend of Gotthilf Franck, also of Halle, another learned man who interested himself in Oriental subjects and who obtained from the Danish Missionary Ziegenbalg, mentioned in my Essay,\u2020 a manuscript History and Genealogy of the Gods of India. I find this mentioned in a letter of LaCroze (to whom Franck had lent the MS.) to Bayer, written in the year 1717.\u00a7 It would be interesting, to know if this is now in the Berlin Library.\n\n6.
