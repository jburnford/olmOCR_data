ALLEN & CO., 13, WATERLOO PLACE, S.W.,\nPUBLISHERS TO THE INDIA OFFICE.\n1886.\nPREFACE.\n\nWhen Thornton's *Gazetteer of India* was originally presented to the public, it was the only compilation of its kind; and it was obviously desirable that, within reasonable limits, the work should afford information, not only on those subjects which ordinarily come within the range of a *Gazetteer*, but also on the history, antiquities, etc., of the various localities described. Since that time, however, Mr. Hunter's gigantic work, *The Imperial Gazetteer of India*, has been prepared under the auspices and at the cost of the Government of India, covering ground far more extensive than that of Thornton's *Gazetteer*; and it is understood that this vast official work will be still further enlarged in the New Edition now in course of production. In these circumstances it has been thought advisable, when issuing a New Edition of Thornton's *Gazetteer* corrected up to date, to modify in some measure the plan of the work, by omitting much of the detail, and giving only such leading facts and figures as will suffice for ordinary purposes of reference\u2014a plan which has the further advantage of reducing the work to one moderate-sized volume, notwithstanding the addition of many hundreds of articles on places not\nincluded in any former edition. The figures of area and population have been corrected by the Census Report of 1881; and care has been taken to render the work as far as possible accurate and trustworthy. As regards the numerous alterations and additions that have been made, the Imperial Gazetteer has of course been the main source of information, and has been freely used; the Editors desire to acknowledge the great advantage which they, in common with all that section of the public that is interested in India, have derived from the completion of this great national undertaking. The spelling is that adopted by the Government of India in Hunter's Gazetteer; the Editors must not therefore be held responsible for peculiarities which it was not within the scope of their labours to correct.\n\nRoper Lethbridge.\nA.

It is also a celebrated place of pilgrimage, especially for the Jains, who have a very magnificent place of worship at Dalwara, situate about the middle of the mountain, and five miles south-west of Gurusikar. The group consists of four temples, arranged in the form of a cross. Colonel Tod says, \u201cBeyond controversy, this is the most superb of all the temples in India, and there is not an edifice besides the T\u00e1j Mahal that can approach it.\u201d See also Fergusson\u2019s History of Indian and Eastern Architecture.

There are scarcely any manufactures, except of coarse cloth, dyed red with a colour obtained from the root of a plant called Morinda multiflora.

That district bounds the Cochin r\u00e1j on the west, north, and north-east sides; a small portion at the\nsouth-west angle is bounded by the Arabian Sea, and farther south is an isolated strip of territory of about thirty miles in length, bounded on the south-west by the same sea. On the south, and part of the east, Cochin is bounded by the territory of Travancore: it lies between lat. $9^\\circ 48'$\u2014$10^\\circ 50'$, long. $76^\\circ 5'$\u2014$76^\\circ 58'$. The area is 1361 sq. miles. Pop. (1881), 600,278. A considerable portion of this r\u0101j is mountainous, extending over the Western Gh\u0101ts. The most striking physical feature of the country is furnished by the series of shallow lagoons, called backwaters, receiving the drainage of the numerous streams descending from the Western Gh\u0101ts, and from this circumstance liable to rise enormously as these feeders swell, and to fall as they shrink or dry up. One of these feeders, the Alwai, has been known to rise nearly sixteen feet in twenty-four hours. This affects the backwater in the like degree, which sometimes continues swollen for months, but in the dry season shoals in many places to two feet, and even to six inches at the northern and southern extremities. The limits of the Cochin backwaters, distant north and south about 120 miles, pass considerably beyond the boundary of the state: the greatest breadth is about ten miles, but in some places the width is not more than a few hundred yards. The form is exceedingly irregular, branching into a great number of intricate and shallow channels, inclosing various low alluvial islands. The communication with the sea is at three points: one at the city of Cochin, another at Kodungalur or Cranganore, and a third at Chetuw\u0101i or Chatw\u0101i. Though in most places rather shallow, the backwater is navigable at all times from Cochin to Cranganore, and from Cochin to Aleppi, both for passage and cargo-boats. During the rains it is everywhere navigable for flat-bottomed boats; but for the conveyance of small merchandise, canoes drawing little water are preferred. The principal rivers are the Pon\u0101ni, the Tattamangalam, and the Karuwanur; the chief towns are Ernakollam (which is the capital) and Trichur. The chief, who has a salute of 17 guns, pays a yearly tribute of \u00a320,000 to the British Government.\n\n**COCHIN.**\u2014Subdivision of the Cochin State, Madras.\n\n**COCHIN.**\u2014Town in Cochin State.

The coast throughout is, with little exception, low and sandy, and the sea shallow near the shore, with sounding gradually increasing with the distance from land. The etymology of the name Coromandel has been variously explained, some tracing it to Karimanal (see next art.); but it appears that it was originally denominated Choramandal or Cholamandal, which is considered to mean the mandal or region of the Chola, an ancient dynasty of this part of India.\n\nCOROMANDEL.\u2014Town in Chengalpat district, Madras.

From this spot, which has an elevation of 13,800 feet, the stream holds a direction north-west for ten miles to Gangotri; the elevation of the latter is 10,800 feet, and the average descent of the river thereto, from the place where it emerges from the snow-bed, is 350 feet per mile. From Gangotri the Bh\u00e1girathi holds a course nearly north-west to Bhairogati, in lat. 31\u00b0 2', long. 78\u00b0 54', the point of confluence with the Jahnavi, holding its steep and foaming course from the north-east. The latter is considerably the larger river. The distance is seven miles from Gangotri to Bhairogati; and as this latter place has an elevation of 8511 feet, the average descent of the river in this part of its course is 255 per mile. The united stream holds a course first westerly, and then south-westerly, for thirteen miles, as far as Sukhi, in lat. 30\u00b0 59', long. 78\u00b0 45', where it may be said to \"break through the Him\u00e1laya Proper.\" At Deo Pray\u00e1g, in lat. 30\u00b0 8', long. 78\u00b0 39', it is joined on the left side by the Alaknanda, a large stream formed by the union of the Vishnu and the Dhauli. From Deo Pray\u00e1g, the united stream, now called the Ganges, flows south-west to Hardw\u00e1r, in lat. 29\u00b0 57', long. 78\u00b0 14'. From Hardw\u00e1r the general course of the Ganges is nearly south for about 130 miles, as far as Anupshahr, in the British district of Bulandshahr, in lat. 28\u00b0 31', long. 78\u00b0 20', where it turns to the south-east, and 160 miles lower down, in lat. 27\u00b0 7', long. 80\u00b0 3', receives on the left side the R\u00e1mganga, a considerable river flowing from the north-west. Eight miles lower down, it on the right side receives the K\u00e1li Nadi, flowing likewise from the north-west; and twenty miles beyond, the Isan Nadi. One hundred and seventy miles lower down, at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, in lat. 25\u00b0 26', long. 81\u00b0 45', it is joined, also on the right side, by the Jumna, from the north-west. From Hardw\u00e1r to Cawnpore, the distance is about 348 miles. From Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d the stream meanders in a direction generally easterly for 270 miles, to M\u00e1njh\u00ed, near which, in lat. 25\u00b0 46', long. 84\u00b0 40', it is joined on the left side by the Gogra. Between Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d and M\u00e1njh\u00ed, it on the left side receives the Gumti, and on the right, the Tons and Karamn\u00e1sa; besides many smaller streams right and left. In the dry season, near Kachw\u00e1, thirty-five miles above Benares, a shoal extends completely across the river, having only two feet six inches of water on its lowest part. Eighteen miles below the junction of the Gogra, opposite to the town of Cherand, in lat. 25\u00b0 39', long. 84\u00b0 53', it on the right side receives the Son, a large\nriver flowing from the south-west. At H\u00e1jipur, on the left side, twenty miles below the confluence of the Son, the Ganges receives the Gandak, a large river from the north-west, and continues to flow eastward for 160 miles, to Katr\u00ed, in lat. $25^\\circ 20'$, long. $87^\\circ 17'$, where, on the left side, it receives the Kus\u00ed, also a large river flowing from the north, having in its course between the junctions of these two great rivers received right and left several streams of less importance. In lat. $24^\\circ 44'$, long. $87^\\circ 59'$, the Bh\u00e1girathi, a great watercourse, parts on the right side from the main stream; and seventy miles lower down, the Jalang\u00ed, another watercourse, also of considerable dimensions, diverges on the same side, in lat. $24^\\circ 9'$, long. $88^\\circ 40'$. The Bh\u00e1girathi proceeding southward for 120 miles, is then rejoined by the Jalang\u00ed, after a course of about the like distance, and the united stream, called the H\u00fagl\u00ed, continuing to hold the same direction for forty-eight miles, becomes navigable for vessels of considerable burthen at Chandanagar, in lat. $22^\\circ 50'$, long. $88^\\circ 24'$, at the distance of 115 miles from the sea, into which it falls about lat. $21^\\circ 40'$, long. $88^\\circ$; its estuary being considered the termination of the sacred stream. Below the divergence of the Bh\u00e1girathi and the Jalang\u00ed, the main stream is called the Padma (Padda) or Ganges; and from that point the joint delta of the Ganges and Brahmaputra may be considered to commence. The Ganges, flowing south-east, receives some considerable streams on the left side; and on the right, besides the Jalang\u00ed, it throws off, five miles lower down, the M\u00e1t\u00e1bh\u00e1ng\u00e1; forty miles below this latter divergence, the Gorai; and forty miles still further, the Chandni. At Go\u00e1landa it is joined by the Jamun\u00e1, the main stream of the Brahmaputra; and enters the sea by a great estuary called the Meghna. Total course of main river to mouth of H\u00fagl\u00ed, 1509 miles; to mouth of Meghna, 1557 miles.\n\n**GANGES CANAL.**\u2014Canal-system between Hardw\u00e1r and Cawnpore, N.W.P.; traversing, with its branches, the districts of Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, Fatehgarh, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Al\u00edgarh, Muttra, Et\u00e1wah, Etah, M\u00e1inpuri, Farrukh\u00e1b\u00e1d, and Cawnpore.

From this centre the chain of the Him\u00e1layas stretches to nearly an equal distance in a north-westerly direction on the one hand, and a south-easterly on the other, throwing off at right angles lateral ranges sloping southward to the plains of India. Deep narrow valleys, separated from each other by these meridional ranges, contain the sources of the numerous rivers which constitute the drainage system of the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra. Among the tributaries of the Indus may be enumerated the Jhelum, Chen\u00e1b, Beas, R\u00e1vi, and Sutlej; the principal feeders of the Ganges are the Junna, Gogra, Gandak, and Kosi; the Tist\u00e1 and some others fall into the Brahmaputra. The elevation of the culminating range of the Him\u00e1laya is probably at a mean about 18,000 or 20,000 feet. The passes are rarely under 17,000 or 18,000 feet. The greater number of the giant peaks, which rise to an elevation of 26,000 or 28,000 feet, are situated, not on the central axis, but to the south of it. The length of the western division of the culminating range of the Him\u00e1layas, from the source of the Sutlej to the peaks of Dayamur on the Indus, is nearly 700 miles. The limits of the snow-line on the southern slope have a height of about 18,500 feet. The length of the eastern section of the culminating range of the Him\u00e1-\nlayas, from the confluence of the Dihong with the Brahmaputra in the east, to the river K\u00e1li, forming the boundary of Nep\u00e1l on the west, is about 800 miles. This portion supports the lofty peaks of K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1 and Dhaul\u00e1giri. The latter, having an elevation of 27,600 feet, is in lat. 29\u00b0 11', long. 82\u00b0 59'. The lofty peak of K\u00e1nchanjang\u00e1 rises to the height of 28,176 feet; and between this summit and Khatmandu is the mountain that has a greater elevation than any other in the world, hitherto discovered, Mount Everest, 29,002 feet. The entire chain may be said to have an average breadth of 150 miles; its length is computed at about 1500.\n\n**HIMATGANJ (HIMMUTGANG).**\u2014Village in Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d district, N.W.P.; on the route from the cantonment of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d to Jabalpur, and four miles south of the former.

It is the most important feeder of the Ganges, which river it joins at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. It rises at the south-western base of the group called the Jamnotri Peaks, at an elevation of 10,849 feet, and in lat. 31\u00b0, long. 78\u00b0 32\u2032. The stream holds a course generally\nsouth-westerly for about eight miles, when the Barai-Ganga, a stream which down to this point surpasses the Jumna in length and volume of water, joins it on the left side, in lat. $30^\\circ 56'$, long. $78^\\circ 27'$. The declivity of the bed of the stream in this part of its course is enormous, as in a distance of sixteen miles, between its source and Kotnur, the fall is 5036 feet, being at the rate of 314 feet to the mile. About five miles below this, and in lat. $30^\\circ 49'$, long. $78^\\circ 19'$, it receives on the right the Badiar, a great torrent, descending from the mountain Ked\u00e1r-K\u00e1nta. On the same side, about three miles farther, the Ban\u00e1l joins it, and, eight miles beyond, it is increased by the accession (also on the right side) of the Kamal\u00e1da, the largest of its tributaries above the Tons. About four miles lower down, it receives the Rikn\u00e1, and ten miles farther, the Khutni, both on the right side. About fifteen miles below this, it is joined on the left side by the Aglar or Agilwar, a considerable torrent. In addition to those above enumerated, numerous streams of less importance flow into the Jumna on both sides, between the source and this confluence. At the latter point, in lat. $30^\\circ 31'$, long. $78^\\circ 3'$, the course of the river, previously for the most part south-westerly, turns due west, which direction it keeps for thirteen miles, to the confluence of the Tons, in lat. $30^\\circ 30'$, long. $77^\\circ 53'$, and at an elevation of 1686 feet above the sea. About ten miles farther down, on the same side, the Jumna receives the Giri, a small river; and a mile below this place, it receives on the left side, and at an elevation of 1470 feet, the Asan, flowing from the south-east, and draining or irrigating the western part of the Dehra D\u00fan.\n\nTaking from this point a direction first westerly, then southerly, it flows through a ravine in the Siw\u00e1lik Mountains; and enters the plains near Faiz\u00e1b\u00e1d in Sah\u00e1ranpur district, where it gives off the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals. From Delhi, the course turns a little to the east; but though in many places extraordinarily circuitous, it holds generally a south-easterly direction to its confluence with the Ganges at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, a distance from Delhi, by the river's course, of 619 miles. Between Delhi and Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, the Jumna receives on the right side the following rivers: the Utanghan, in lat. $26^\\circ 59'$, long. $78^\\circ 31'$; the Chambal, in lat. $26^\\circ 30'$, long. $79^\\circ 19'$; the Sind, eight miles below; the Betwa, in lat. $25^\\circ 55'$, long. $80^\\circ 17'$; the Ken, in lat. $25^\\circ 47'$, long. $80^\\circ 35'$, all considerable streams; besides some others of less importance. The chief streams which fall in on the left side are, the Hindan, in lat. $28^\\circ 28'$, long. $77^\\circ 30'$; and the Sengur, in lat. $26^\\circ 9'$, long. $79^\\circ 59'$.\n\nThe total length of the river, from its source to its confluence with the Ganges at Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d, is 860 miles. On the rocky point where the waters meet, stands the fort of Allah\u00e1b\u00e1d. The streams at the junction are nearly equal in volume; the Ganges, the deeper, with yellow water; the Jumna, the more rapid, with water as clear as crystal.\n\n**JUMNA CANAL, EASTERN.**\u2014Canal in Sah\u00e1ranpur, Muzaffarnagar, and Meerut districts, N.W.P.; it is drawn from the Jumna, and joins that river again in lat. $28^\\circ 36'$\u2014$30^\\circ 19'$, long. $77^\\circ 19'$\u2014$77^\\circ 38'$.\n\n**JUMNA CANAL, WESTERN.**\u2014Canal in Umballa, Karn\u00e1l, Delhi, and Rohtak districts, Punjab; it is taken out of the Jumna just below the head of the Eastern Jumna Canal, one branch going to Delhi, others to Rohtak, But\u00e1na, and Hiss\u00e1r.

It is generally supposed to rise at Sar-i Chasmah, in lat. $34^\\circ 17'$, long. $68^\\circ 14'$, where at a height of 8400 feet above the sea, a very copious spring bursts from the ground, and forms the chief source of the principal stream. But the extreme head is about twelve miles farther west, on the eastern declivity of the Un\u00e1i ridge. It is at first an inconsiderable stream, everywhere fordable for sixty miles, as far as K\u00e1b\u00fal; at a short distance beyond which place it receives the river of Logar, and thenceforward is a rapid river. About forty miles below K\u00e1b\u00fal it receives the Panjsh\u00edr river, which has a course of 120 miles. About fifteen miles below this, it receives the Tagao river, having a course of about eighty miles. The united streams of the Alishang and Alingar join the K\u00e1b\u00fal river about twenty miles farther down, after a course each of about 120 miles. At the distance of about twenty miles more, the Surkh-\u00e1b, or Red River, so called from the colour which its water derives from the earth suspended in it, falls into the K\u00e1b\u00fal river after a course of seventy miles. Twenty miles further east, the K\u00e1b\u00fal river receives the river K\u00e1m\u00e1, called also the river of Kunar, which, rising in Chitral, flows through K\u00e1f\u00edrist\u00e1n. Eastward of the Khaibar Mountains, and in lat. $34^\\circ 10'$, long. $71^\\circ 27'$,\nit enters the British territory, and divides into three branches, which, at Duobandi, twelve miles lower down, reunite, and thence the river is navigable for boats of forty or fifty tons to Attock, near which it joins the Indus. Just below Duobandi, it is joined from the north by the river of Sw\u00e1t. After this confluence, the K\u00e1b\u00fal river continues to flow eastward for forty miles, and falls into the Indus on the western side, nearly opposite Attock, in lat. $33^\\circ 54'$, long. $72^\\circ 16'$, having a total course of about 320 miles.\n\n**KABUL.**\u2014A division of Afgh\u00e1n\u00edst\u00e1n.

For a considerable period the appointment was not refilled, but eventually a native gentleman was sent to the capital to represent the British Government.

It is bounded on the north by the presidency of Bombay, the Haidar\u00e1b\u00e1d State, the Central Provinces, and the Orissa division of Bengal; on the east and south-east by the Bay of Bengal; on the south by the Indian Ocean; and on the south-west and west by the Arabian Sea. It extends from Cape Comorin, in lat. $8^\\circ 4'$, to the northern extremity of the district of Ganj\u00e1m, in lat. $20^\\circ 15'$; and from the north-west point of the district of South K\u00e1nara, in long. $74^\\circ 1'$, to the eastern extremity of the district of Ganj\u00e1m, in long. $85^\\circ 15'$. Its greatest length, measured from north-east to south-west, is about 950 miles; and its greatest breadth, measured at right angles to the direction of that line, is about 400. Its sea-coast on one face, measured in a south-eastern direction, and subsequently eastward to Cape Comorin, extends 540 miles, being nearly throughout washed by the Arabian Sea, and for a short distance by the Indian Ocean. On the other face, measured from Cape Comorin north-east to the north of Ganj\u00e1m, along the shore of the Bay of Bengal, its length is about 1187 miles; and consequently the total extent of the sea-coast of the Presidency is 1727 miles; being much greater than that of the two others combined.\n\nAs regards harbours, that at Cochin, on the Malabar coast, which has the greatest depth of water, is, during several months of the year, closed by the south-west monsoon. The port of Mangalore admits with safety only vessels having not more than ten or twelve feet draught. About fifty-six miles north-west of the city of Madras, the Eastern Gh\u00e1ts form a junction with the range, which, sweeping irregularly inland, crosses the peninsula in a south-west direction; and in the vicinity of the Nilgiris, joins the Western Gh\u00e1ts, which extend to Cape Comorin on the one side, and to the northern frontier of the presidency on the other. The Eastern and Western Gh\u00e1ts unite in the Nilgiris, of which one peak, Dodabetta (8640 ft. high), is the highest mountain in Southern India. Besides these may be mentioned the Shevaroy Hills in Salem district, the Anamalai Hills in Coimbatore, and the Palni Hills in Madura.\n\nThough the great table-land of the Deccan rises considerably towards the south, it has a general slope of surface to the east or south-east, all the streams of any considerable magnitude flowing in that direction, and being ultimately emptied into the Bay of Bengal. The principal rivers are the God\u00e1vari, Krishna, K\u00e1veri, North Penn\u00e1r or Pin\u00e1kini, the South Penn\u00e1r or Pin\u00e1kini, and the P\u00e1l\u00e1r. The two great railway systems of the Presidency are the Madras Railway and the South Indian Railway. The former, with a total length of 857 miles (1880), joins R\u00e1ichor (on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway of Bombay) with Madras, and proceeds thence westward to the west coast of Beypur, with branches to Bellary and Bangalore. The latter railway, with a total length of 633 miles (1880), joins Madras with Tuticorin. The area of the Presidency is 138,856 sq. miles, and the pop. (1881), 31,170,631, exclusive of the Native States, which have an area of 9192 sq. miles, and a pop. (1881) of 3,303,563.

The city of Madras, including the whole of the various divisions of which it is composed, contained, according to the census of 1881, a total population of 405,848.

The most remarkable anecdote of this part of his journey is concerning the prosecution of the Jews, for an alleged insult to Mohammedanism, not unlike the pretext of Christian persecutors in the days of the Crusaders.\n\nFrom St Petersburgh, Captain Abbott returned to England, where he gives an amusing account of the difficulties, and mental and physical distresses of his Afghan follower.

He explains that the object of the book is to supply a succinct account of the chivalric orders in a convenient form. The literary form of the work is amply convenient for reference and study. Its material form could be convenient only to some knight of the times when armour was worn in the field, and men were stronger in the arm than they are now. It is a handsome volume. The size of the book is doubtless due to the introduction of a series of engraved plates of the badges and crosses of the various orders described. These plates are executed in a finished style, and give the work an exceptional value for students of heraldic symbolism. The author may be congratulated on the successful issue of a laborious and useful task.\"\u2014Scotsman, 14th May 1888.\n\nSIR EDWIN ARNOLD, M.A., Author of \"The Light of Asia,\" &c.\n\nThe Book of Good Counsels, Fables from the Sanscrit of the Hitopad\u00e9sa.

Superior Edition, beautifully bound, 7s. 6d.\n\n\"It is so long since Sir Edwin Arnold's Indian fables were in print that they may practically be regarded as a new book. In themselves they are almost the fathers of all fable, for whereas we know of no source whence the 'Hitopad\u00e9sa' could have been borrowed, there are evidences of its inspiration and to spare in Bidpai, in Aesop, and in most of the later fabulists.\"\u2014Pall Mall Gazette.\n\n\"These curious and fascinating stories from the Sanskrit which Sir Edward Arnold has retold in 'The Book of Good Counsels' give us the key to the heart of modern India, the writer tells us, as well as the splendid record of her ancient gods and glories, quaint narratives, as full of ripe wisdom as the songs of Hiawatha, and with the same curious blending of statecraft and wood-magic in them.\"\u2014Daily Telegraph.\n\n\"A new edition comes to hand of this delightful work\u2014a fit companion to 'Aesop's Fables' and the 'Jungle Book.' Sir Edwin has done well to republish this record of Indian stories and poetical maxims from the Sanskrit. And the illustrations, a specimen of which we give here, what shall we say of them? Simply that they are equal to the text. No more pleasant series of 'Good Counsels' is it possible to find, and we are convinced that it is not an ill counsel\u2014far from it\u2014to advise our readers to forth-with get this charming work. They will derive not a little pleasure, and perchance instruction, from a perusal of the story of the jackal, deer, and crow, of the tiger and the traveller, of the lion, the jackals, and the bull, of the black snake and golden chain, of the frogs, and the old serpent, and of all the other veracious chronicles herein set forth.\"\u2014Whitehall Review.\n\nS.

Other temples and monasteries were visited and Lamas employed for copying manuscripts, and searching for texts bearing upon the author\u2019s researches.

As to accuracy no one can be a more competent judge than Sir Frederick, and his testimony stamps the book before us as constituting especially trustworthy material for history. Of much that he relates Mr Hensman was an eye-witness; of the rest he was informed by eye-witnesses immediately after the occurrence of the events recorded. There could, therefore, be little doubt as to the facts mentioned. Credibility might be concurrent with incorrect deductions, but we are assured by Sir Frederick Roberts that Mr Hensman's accuracy is complete in all respects. Mr Hensman enjoyed singular advantages during the first part of the war, for he was the only special correspondent who accompanied the force which marched out of Ali Kheyl in September 1879. One of the most interesting portions of the book is that which describes the march of Sir Frederick Roberts from Cabul to Candahar. The description of the Maiwand disaster is given with combined clearness, simplicity, and power, and will be read with the utmost interest. Indeed, the book is in every respect interesting and well written, and reflects the greatest credit on the author.\"\u2014Athen\u00e6um.\n\nSIR JOHN F. W.

On every one of the numerous heads (over fifty) into which the book is divided, Mr Hughes furnishes a large amount of very valuable information, which it would be exceedingly difficult to collect from even a large library of works on the subject. The book might well be called a 'Dictionary of Muhammadan Theology,' for we know of no English work which combines a methodical arrangement (and consequently facility of reference) with fulness of information in so high a degree as the little volume before us.\"\u2014The Academy.\n\n\"It contains multum in parvo, and is about the best outlines of the tenets of the Muslim faith which we have seen.

It deals with more than one branch of what is commonly known as spiritualism. The introduction gives a brief resum\u00e9 of various forms of magic and divination which have obtained credence in all ages, and later on we find well-authenticated accounts of apparitions, supernatural warnings, hypnotic experiments, and miracles of healing. Mr Lee evidently believes that 'there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy,' and few sane people will disagree with him, though they may not be inclined to accept all his opinions and assertions as they stand.\"\u2014Lady.\n\n\"Here we have ghostly stories galore, which believers in supernatural visitations will welcome as upholders of the faith that is in them. Dr Lee is a hard hitter and a vigorous controversialist, with a righteous contempt for your Darwins and Stuart Mills, and such like folk, and is not above suggesting that some of them have a decided worship of the god Self. As for 'the pompous jargon and silly cynicism which so many public scribes again and again make use of to throw discredit upon any phase of the supernatural,' I have nothing to say.

Mr Montagu has much that is interesting to tell about the horrors of the siege of Kars and the prowess of the fair young Amazon who commanded a troop of Bash-Bazouks, and even seduced a Russian general to her side. How he got to the front in spite of Russian prohibition, disguised as a camp follower, how his portmanteau was shelled a few inches behind his back, what he risked and what he saw in the memorable lines before Plevena, will be read with great interest.

Mr Rogers now presents a comprehensive view of the land administration of Bombay as a whole, the history of its rise and progress, and a clear statement of the results which it has attained. It is a narrative of which all patriotic Englishmen may feel proud. The old burdens of native rule have been lightened, the old injustices mitigated, the old fiscal cruelties and exactions abolished. Underlying the story of each district we see a perennial struggle going on between the increase of the population and the available means of subsistence derived from the soil. That increase of the population is the direct result of the peace of the country under British rule. But it tends to press more and more severely on the possible limits of local cultivation, and it can only be provided for by the extension of the modern appliances of production and distribution. Mr Rogers very properly confines himself to his own subject. But there is ample evidence that the extension of roads, railways, steam factories, and other industrial enterprises, have played an important part in the solution of the problem, and that during recent years such enterprises have been powerfully aided by an abundant currency.\" \u2014The Times.\n\nROBERT SEWELL.\n\nAnalytical History of India, from the earliest times to the Abolition of the East India Company in 1858.

At the same time he has attempted to render it interesting to the general reader by preserving a medium between a bare analysis and a complete history; so that, without consulting the eminent authorities mentioned above, the mind may readily grasp the principal outlines of the early condition of India, and the rise and progress of the East India Company. For the more full comprehension of these facts the author has provided, in addition to a table of contents and a chronological index, an index to the geographical position of the places to which reference is made in the text, bearing the latitudes and longitude as given in Thornton's 'Gazetteer of India.' This will be found not only to aid the student who is but partially acquainted with the map of India, but also by means of occasional accents to guide him in the ordinary pronunciation of the names.\" \u2014Preface.\n\nAny Bookseller at Home and Abroad.\nG.

Though he met with and shot many other kinds of wild beasts, the bulk of the volume, well written, well illustrated, and generally well got up, deals chiefly with the elephant, the tiger, the bison, the leopard, and the bear. Mr Sanderson, with exceptional powers of observation, cultivated friendly intercourse with the natives; and he was consequently able to utilise to the utmost the singularly favourable opportunities enjoyed by him as director of elephant-capturing operations in Mysore and Chittagong. The result is a book which to graphic details of sporting adventures far surpassing the common, adds a correct natural history of the animals chiefly dealt with, and particularly the elephant. From this real king of beasts, Mr Sanderson carefully removes every exaggeration made both for or against him, which had been repeated without any good foundation by one writer after another; he substitutes for fables a description of elephantine anatomy, size, habits, and character which may be said to sum up all that we know for certain about the animal, and nearly all that one can wish to know.

Like a watchman he stands upon his tower\u2014and when asked, What of the night? he disavows not that we are in the night, but earnestly declares that the morning cometh apace. The professor is an optimist; he does not believe that the country is done, and still less does he favour the idea that, taking a wide survey, the former days were better than these. On the contrary, he urges that the way out of the wilderness is not by any by-path, but by going right ahead; and, ere long, the man who holds the banner high will emerge triumphant.\"\u2014Scottish Farmer.\n\nJ.

Its object is to place within reach of the general public in an agreeable form the results of the most recent and comprehensive botanical research. The author is so bold as to ask why flowers were made, and is not without means to answer the question reverently and truthfully. He connects them by the aids that science supplies with the history of creation, and the records of the rocks, and with the history of man, and the progress of the agricultural and horticultural arts. He tells us how they are influenced by soil and climate, how changed and multiplied by insects and other agencies, how their seeds are blown about the world, and how by innumerable divine appointments it at last comes about that the life of a man is environed and beautified with flowers. The work is rich in the results of travel, and it happily connects the vegetable products of the globe with the conditions that favour them and the wants they satisfy.

Now, in addition to being very tastefully and prettily reissued, it contains numerous illustrations by Mr Gordon Browne. As some few may remember, it is a book of Indian stories and poetical maxims from the Sanskrit of the Hitopad\u00e9sa. The book is almost a volume of fairy tales, and may pass for that with the younger generation, but it is a little too heavily overlaid with philosophy to be dismissed wholly as such.

Over the whole narrative, the naivet\u00e9 and frankness of the writer cast a charm that far more than covers its occasional eccentricities of style and language. It has seldom fallen to our lot to read a more interesting narrative of personal adventure. Rarely, indeed, do we find an author whose constant presence, through almost the whole of two large volumes, is not only tolerable, but welcome. Few readers will rise from a perusal of the narrative without a strong feeling of personal sympathy and interest in the gallant Major; even though here and there unable to repress a smile at some burst of ecstasy, some abrupt apostrophe, such as would never have been perpetrated by a practical writer, and a man of the world.\n\nSIR E.

As a work of reference it is doubtless useful. Regarding the way in which its learned translator and editor has acquitted himself of his task it is scarcely necessary to write; a profound scholar and painstaking investigator, his labours are unusually trustworthy, and the world of letters will doubtless award him that meed of praise, which is rarely withheld from arduous and conscientious toil, by assigning him, in death, a niche in the temple of fame, side by side with his venerated master, Sir Henry Elliott.\"\u2014Academy.\n\n\"This book may be considered the first of a series designed rather as a supplement than complement to the 'History of India as Told by its own Historians.' Following the Preface, a necessarily brief biographical notice\u2014written in the kindly and appreciative spirit which ever characterises the style of the learned editor of Marco Polo, whose initials are scarcely needed to confirm his identity\u2014explains how on Professor Dowson's death, Sir Edward Clive Bayley was induced to undertake an editorship for which he was eminently qualified by personal character and acquaintance with the originator of the project which constituted his raison d'\u00eatre. But the new editor did not live to see the actual publication of his first volume. Scarcely had he completed it for the press, when his career was brought to a close. A singular fatality seems to have attended the several able men who have taken the leading part in preserving this particular monument of genuine history.

Mr Danvers, whose devotion to the duties of the Record Department is well known, hastened to carry out his instructions, and his report fully attests the earnestness with which he pursued his task. The documents range in date from 1500 to the present date, and contain clusters of documents numbering 12,465 and 5,274, and 1,783 in extent, besides many other deeply interesting batches of smaller bulk.

Records, a selected list of Letters in the Board of Revenue, Calcutta, 1782-1807, with an Historical Dissertation and Analytical Index. 4 vols. Demy 8vo, 30s.\n\n\"This is one of the small class of original works that compel a reconsideration of views which have been long accepted and which have passed into the current history of the period to which they refer. Sir William Wilson Hunter's exhaustive examination of the actual state of the various landed classes of Bengal during the last century renders impossible the further acceptance of these hitherto almost indisputable dicta of Indian history. The chief materials for that examination have been the contemporary MS. records preserved in the Board of Revenue, Calcutta, of which Sir William Hunter gives a list of 14,136 letters dealing with the period from 1782 to 1807. Nothing could be more impartial than the spirit in which he deals with the great questions involved. He makes the actual facts, as recorded by these letters, written at the time, speak for themselves. But those who desire to learn how that system grew out of the pre-existing land rights and land usages of the province will find a clear and authoritative explanation. If these four volumes stood alone they would place their author in the first rank of scientific historians; that is, of the extremely limited class of historians who write from original MSS. and records. But they do not stand alone. They are the natural continuation of the author's researches, nearly a generation ago, among the District Archives of Bengal, which produced his 'Annals of Rural Bengal' in 1868 and his 'Orissa' in 1872. They are also the first-fruits of that comprehensive history of India on which he has been engaged for the last twenty years, for which he has collected in each province of India an accumulation of tested local materials such as has never before been brought together in the hands, and by the labours, of any worker in the same stupendous field, and which, when completed, will be the fitting crown of his lifelong services to India. These volumes are indeed an important instalment towards the projected magnum opus; and in this connection it is of good augury to observe that they maintain their author's reputation for that fulness and minuteness of knowledge, that grasp of principles and philosophic insight, and that fertility and charm of literary expression which give Sir William Hunter his unique place among the writers of his day on India.\"\u2014The Times.\n\nAny Bookseller at Home and Abroad.\nMRS GRACE JOHNSON, Silver Medallist, Cookery Exhibition.\n\nAnglo-Indian and Oriental Cookery.

Crown 8vo, with Maps, 16s.\n\n\"The main merit of Mr Keene's performance lies in the fact that he has assimilated all the authorities, and has been careful to bring his book down to date. He has been careful in research, and has availed himself of the most recent materials. He is well known as the author of other works on Indian history, and his capacity for his self-imposed task will not be questioned. We must content ourselves with this brief testimony to the labour and skill bestowed by him upon a subject of vast interest and importance. Excellent proportion is preserved in dealing with the various episodes, and the style is clear and graphic. The volumes are supplied with many useful maps, and the appendix include notes on Indian law and on recent books about India.\"\u2014Globe.\n\n\"Mr Keene has the admirable element of fairness in dealing with the succession of great questions that pass over his pages, and he wisely devotes a full half of his work to the present century. The appearance of such a book, and of every such book, upon India is to be hailed at present. A fair-minded presentation of Indian history like that contained in Mr Keene's two volumes is at this moment peculiarly welcome.\"\u2014Times.\n\n\"In this admirably clear and comprehensive account of the rise and consolidation of our great Indian Empire, Mr Keene has endeavoured to give, without prolixity, a statement of the relevant facts at present available, both in regard to the origin of the more important Indian races and in regard to their progress before they came under the unifying processes of modern administration.\" To this undertaking is, of course, added the completion of the story of the \"unprecedented series of events\" which have led to the amalgamation of the various Indian tribes or nationalities under one rule. In theory, at least, there is finality in history. Mr Keene traces the ancient Indian races from their earliest known ancestors and the effect of the Aryan settlement. He marks the rise of Buddhism and the great Muslim Conquest, the end of the Pathans, and the advent of the Empire of the Mughals. In rapid succession he reviews the Hindu revival, the initial establishment of English influence, and the destruction of French power. The author records the policy of Cornwallis, the wars of Wellesley, and the Administration of Minto\u2014the most important features in Indian history before the establishment of British supremacy. It is a brilliant record of British prowess and ability of governing inferior races that Mr Keene has to place before his readers. We have won and held India by the sword, and the policy of the men we send out year by year to assist in its administration is largely based on that principle. The history of the land, of our occupation, and our sojournings, so ably set forth in these pages, is inseparable from that one essential fact.\"\u2014Morning Post.\n\nAn Oriental Biographical Dictionary.

The Mirror of British Museum.\n\n\"Mr Rogers has produced a continuous and an authoritative record of the land changes and of the fortunes of the cultivating classes for a full half-century, together with valuable data regarding the condition and burdens of those classes at various periods before the present system of settlement was introduced. Mr Rogers now presents a comprehensive view of the land administration of Bombay as a whole, the history of its rise and progress, and a clear statement of the results which it has attained. It is a narrative of which all patriotic Englishmen may feel proud. The old burdens of native rule have been lightened, the old injustices mitigated, the old fiscal cruelties and exactions abolished. Underlying the story of each district we see a perennial struggle going on between the increase of the population and the available means of subsistence derived from the soil. That increase of the population is the direct result of the peace of the country under British rule. But it tends to press more and more severely on the possible limits of local cultivation, and it can only be provided for by the extension of the modern appliances of production and distribution. Mr Rogers very properly confines himself to his own subject. But there is ample evidence that the extension of roads, railways, steam factories, and other industrial enterprises, have played an important part in the solution of the problem, and that during recent years such enterprises have been powerfully aided by an abundant currency.\"\u2014The Times.\n\nFor the Reduced Prices apply to\nG.

In these circumstances it has been thought incumbent, when issuing a New Edition of Thornton's \"Gazetteer\" corrected up to date, to modify in some measure the plan of the work by omitting much of the detail and giving only such leading facts and figures as will suffice for ordinary purposes of reference, a plan which has the additional advantage of reducing the work to one moderate-sized volume.\n\nIt is obvious that the value of the New Edition must depend in a large measure upon the care and judgment which have been exercised in the preparation of the letterpress. The task was, in the first instance, undertaken by Mr Roper Lethbridge, whose literary attainments and acquaintance with India seemed to qualify him to a marked degree for an undertaking demanding considerable knowledge and experience. But in order further to render the work as complete and perfect as possible, the publishers deemed it prudent to subject the pages to the scrutiny of a second Editor, in the person of Mr Arthur Wollaston, whose lengthened service in the Indian Branch of the Civil Service of this country, coupled with his wide acquaintance with Oriental History, gives to his criticism an unusual degree of weight and importance. The joint names which appear on the title-page will, it is hoped, serve as a guarantee to the public that the \"Gazetteer\" is in the main accurate and trustworthy, free alike from sins of omission and commission. It will be found to contain the names of many hundreds of places not included in any former edition, while the areas and populations have been revised by the data given in the Census Report of 1881.\n\nThe chief objects in view in compiling this Gazetteer are:\n\n1st. To fix the relative position of the various cities, towns, and villages with as much precision as possible and to exhibit with the greatest practicable brevity all that is known respecting them; and\n\n2ndly.
